    "main_text": "Technical Problems\n3. Technical Problems\n\nThere are a variety of technical objections to modal fictionalism, and\nif these objections succeeded they would derail specific proposals\nlike that of Rosen 1990 and perhaps cause difficulties for modal\nfictionalism in general. The most discussed of these objections is the\nBrock/Rosen objection, an objection to the theory of Rosen 1990,\npublished independently in Brock 1993 and Rosen 1993. (In the case of\nRosen 1993, a variety was also leveled at the fictionalism of\nArmstrong 1989).\n",
