    "main_text": "Worship Lishmah and the Meaning of Mitzvoth\n5. Worship Lishmah and the Meaning of Mitzvoth\n\nLeibowitz cannot make sense of the divinity of the mitzvoth by\nclaiming that God is their source in any straightforward sense. Having\nreduced all meaningful discourse about God and faith to halakhic\npractice, one might thus look to the meaning of the practice for some\nsuch mark of divinity. As we have noted earlier, talk of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d for Leibowitz is bound up with that of value and\npurpose, so it is to these that we must look for the meaning of the\ndivinity of the mitzvoth, and Leibowitz has much to say about the\npurpose of the mitzvoth, particularly as they relate (or not) to human\nvalues, based on a basic Talmudic distinction between two forms of\nreligious worship \u2013 worship that is\n\u201clishmah,\u201d or \u201cfor its own sake,\u201d and\nworship that is \u201cNot-lishmah,\u201d or \u201cnot for\nits own sake.\u201d\n\nWorship that is \u201cNot-lishmah\u201d Leibowitz characterizes in\nteleological terms. It begins with a set of human values and beliefs,\nand understands religion as the instrument for the realization of\nthese values. Thus religious acts will be derived from this set of\nvalues, as the acts that best achieve them. These values, therefore,\nare prior to the religious act, much in the way utilitarian ethical\ntheory prioritizes a definition of the good and defines right action\nin terms of what maximizes that good. Religious action then is at base\nmotivated by human needs and the problem with such worship for\nLeibowitz is that it renders God the servant of man. It is what he\nterms \u201can endowing religion \u2013 a means of satisfying\nman\u2019s spiritual needs and of assuaging his mental conflicts. Its\nend is man, and God offers his services to man\u201d\n(Judaism, 14).\n\nReflecting an ambivalence that runs through statements in the Jewish\ntradition regarding such worship, Leibowitz vacillates between\nrecognizing worship \u201cNot-lishmah\u201d as a genuine if flawed\nform of worship and as not seeing it as worship at all \u2013 indeed,\nseeing it as idolatrous in its reduction of worship of God to worship\nof man, thus implying that man is\n holy.[14]\n Philosophically speaking, his negative attitude can again be traced\nback to his strictly scientific approach to the world and his views\nconcerning God\u2019s transcendence. Regarding the former, Leibowitz\ndismisses the idea that human beings exist at some supra-natural\nlevel. As creatures of flesh and blood, we are governed by the same\nnatural laws as the rest of nature. Human beings have no special\nendowment that transcends their physical nature. Given that this is\nthe case, human needs cannot be sacred, and thus the service of human\nneed cannot be the purpose of the mitzvoth. Coming from the opposite\ndirection, given that God is transcendent and cannot be related to any\nform of concrete reality, including human reality, how could the\nservice of our own needs, which are a function of our humanity,\nconstitute worship of God? God must be the exclusive locus of\nreligious value, to the exclusion of human values. Man, in comparison,\nis but human, and a part of nature. Thus, while Medieval Jewish\nphilosophers usually take the statement at Genesis 1:27 that man was\ncreated \u201cin the image of God\u201d as placing man on a pedestal\nby somehow comparing him to God, for Leibowitz, the verse should be\ntaken to indicate that man is a mere \u201cimage\u201d in its more\nprosaic, if not pejorative Platonic sense (Judaism, 90).\n\nIn marked contrast to all of this, Leibowitz presents the idea of\nworship \u201clishmah,\u201d which is the mark of a\ndemanding religion. Here, the religious act is prior to any set of\nhuman needs or values. It is characterized by acts of worship demanded\nby God, where the demands made, and the motivations for serving, are\nsimply that \u2013 they are Gods\u2019 demands. Here man is\n\u201can instrument for the realization of an end which transcends\nman \u2026 [who] serves his God lishmah \u2013 because He is worthy\nof worship\u201d (Judaism, 14). Essentially, Judaism is a\nreligion that demands that man serve God, not that God serve man.\nMitzvoth, for Leibowitz, are not therefore based on human needs and\ndesires since that would subordinate God to human values, rendering\nGod a slave to humanity, and placing humanity at the pinnacle of all\nvalue. Most mitzvoth for Leibowitz must therefore \u201cbe\nmeaningless except as expressions of worship. They have no utility in\nterms of satisfaction of human needs\u201d (Judaism, 16).\nRelatedly, he therefore sees much of halakhah as constitutive of\nreligious \u201creality\u201d rather than as regulating a\npre-existing reality. The dietary laws, to take an obvious example,\nare not there to regulate some form of pre-existing sacred reality.\nReality is equivalent to physical reality and the dietary laws are\nnothing more (nor less) than requirements of worship constituting a\nhalakhic \u201creality,\u201d which is a reality that has no\nreferent beyond itself.\n\nThis sui generis understanding of halakhah is important if we\nare to understand Leibowitz\u2019s retreat from facts to values in\nthe realm of faith. We have seen that to speak of any factual reality\nas divine impugns God\u2019s transcendence for Leibowitz. But one\nmight ask why speaking of God as a source of values within our world\nis any less of an intrusion upon his transcendence. Leibowitz\u2019s\npoint is that God is not a source of values within our world,\nsince halakhah is not a function of any human values, indeed not a\nfunction of any set of values to which we have any independent access.\nIn this way Leibowitz retains the transcendence of God in the\nevaluative realm of faith commitments in a way that is not possible in\nthe realm of facts. Nonetheless, the question of how such transcendent\nvalues entered human history, in essence, the problem of revelation\ndiscussed at the end of the previous section, rears its head once\nmore. It is impossible to claim that mitzvoth were literally revealed\nby God given His radical transcendence, yet if we simply regard them\nas human, whence their divinity?\n\nIt is noteworthy that here a Kierkegaardian interpretation could offer\na solution. While one can find comparisons with Kierkegaard in Sigad\n1977, Harvey 2002, and scattered throughout Sagi 2009 (to name but a\nfew such sources), it is Roi Benbassat who argues for a\n\u201cfundamental analogy between the two thinkers\u201d such that\nhe sees Leibowitz\u2019s \u201creligious position as a variation of\nKierkegaard\u2019s faith in the absurd developed from the same\ntypical existentialist conception of ethics\u201d (2015, 143). We\nwill investigate the specifically ethical bent of Benbassat\u2019s\nclaim presently, but we here note that when we remarked earlier that\nLeibowitz retreated from his claim that Jewish faith was based on a\nparadox, he may have spoken too soon. For what, other than a paradox,\ncould account for the actual divinity of mitzvoth in the absence of\nany possibility of divine incursion into the human arena? According to\nBenbassat, \u201cto claim there is no paradox is to disregard the\nvery essence of Leibowitz\u2019s position\u201d (Benbassat 2015,\n151), and it might be that only a paradox will allow the ultimate\nconative commitment that is Leibowitzian faith to truly be worship of\nGod. Whether this picture can indeed be assimilated to that drawn by\nLeibowitz \u2013 and his strong scientific grounding certainly leaves\nroom for doubt \u2013 it does, at this stage, seem to be the only way\nfor him to maintain that performance of mitzvoth constitutes genuinely\ndivine service. \n",
