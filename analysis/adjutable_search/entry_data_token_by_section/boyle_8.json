    "main_text": "Boyle\u2019s World View || Final causes\n3.3 Final causes\n\nAs for teleology, Boyle wrote an influential treatise entitled A\nDisquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things which\nappeared in 1686. In opposition to Epicurus, he argued that there are\nfinal causes and in opposition to Descartes, he claimed that in many\ncases we can have epistemic access to these final causes, though he\nagreed that we ought not be presumptuous in these matters. According\nto Boyle, there are four types of final cause that we can know. First,\nthere are the \u201cgrand and General Ends of the whole World, such\nas the Exercising and Displaying the Creators immense Power\n\u2026.\u201d Second, are the ends in the nature and motions of the\ncelestial objects and the Earth. Third, there are the ends that\npertain to the parts of animals and fourth there are human ends (BW,\n11:87). Boyle was quite adamant that there are no ends that pertain to\ninanimate objects. In particular, he rejects any form of immanent\nteleology in virtue of which material objects are able to direct their\nbehaviour: \u201cFor inanimate Agents act not by choice, but by a\nnecessary impulse, and not being endow\u2019d with Understanding and\nWill, cannot of themselves be able to moderate or to suspend their\nactions\u201d (BW, 4:267. See Carlin 2011, 2012, 2020).\n",
