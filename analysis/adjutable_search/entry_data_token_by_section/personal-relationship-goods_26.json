    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || The Bads of Personal Relationships?\n5.8 The Bads of Personal Relationships?\n\nA topic so far not discussed by philosophers is that of the fair\ndistribution of the bads of personal relationship goods. We are,\nneuro-biologically, prone to connect to other people, but relationship\noften go badly, creating bads as well as goods\u2014especially when\npeople\u2019s attachments to others are dysfunctional (Bowlby 1968,\n1973, 1980). In particular, bad relationships early in life\u2014with\nparents and parental figures\u2014can make people unable to form and\nmaintain healthy relationships, and this generates relationship bads.\nPsychological evidence indicates that insecure attachment and the\nensuing relationship dysfunctions is inter-generationally transmitted\n(Jones et al. 2015). Whose obligation is it to address the possible\nunfairness that some people, out of no fault or choice of their own,\nhave to shoulder a much larger share of relationship bads than others?\nObviously, we cannot directly distribute relationship bads. And it is\nnot obvious how we could legitimately restrict childrearing to prevent\nthe creation of any such bads, as some of the philosophical literature\non licensing parents suggests (see the discussion in 6.2). Maybe\njustice requires that we share the costs of helping people to overcome\nbad relationship dynamics\u2014for instance through psychotherapy and\ncounseling? This, however, will lead to a fair redistribution only if\nit leaves everybody having (equally good) relationships. If not, it\nwill only be an improvement in the quality of relationships. Such\nimprovement seems desirable, in spite of possible distributional\ncomplaints; this is likely to be an area where leveling down is,\nall-things-considered, undesirable.\n",
