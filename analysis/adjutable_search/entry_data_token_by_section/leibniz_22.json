    "main_text": "Epistemology || Truths of Reason and Truths of Fact\n6.2 Truths of Reason and Truths of Fact\n\n\nWhile Leibniz's Principle of Contradiction and Principle of Sufficient\nReason were discussed above, it was not mentioned that these two\nprinciples are employed in the service of Leibniz's distinction\nbetween truths of reasoning and truths of fact, that\nis, between necessary truths and contingent truths.\nLeibniz's account of modality is treated elsewhere, but a\nshort account of this distinction is here required. In the case of a\ntruth of reasoning, its reason or explanation can be discovered by\nanalysis of the notions or concepts, \u201cresolving it into simpler ideas and\nsimpler truths until we reach the primitives\u201d (G VI 612/AG 217).\nUltimately, all truths of reasoning will be resolvable into primitives\nor identities, and the Principle of Contradiction is thereby\noperative. In the case of a truth of fact, on the other hand, its\nreason cannot be discovered through a finite process of\nanalysis or resolution of notions. However, there must be a reason\nthat some particular fact is so and not otherwise (PSR), and,\naccording to Leibniz, this reason is found outside the series of\ncontingent things. (See below.)\n",
