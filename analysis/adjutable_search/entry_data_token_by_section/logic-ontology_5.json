    "main_text": "Ontology || How the different conceptions of ontology are related to each other\n3.2 How the different conceptions of ontology are related to each other\n\nThe relationship between these four seems rather straightforward. (O4)\nwill have to say how the other three are supposed to be understood. In\nparticular, it will have to tell us if the question to be answered in\n(O2) indeed is the question what there is, which was taken above to be\nonly a first approximation for how to state what ontology is supposed\nto do. Maybe it is supposed to answer the question what is real\ninstead, or what is fundamental, some other question. Whatever one\nsays here will also affect how one should understand (O1). We will at\nfirst work with what is the most common way to understand (O2) and\n(O1), and discuss alternatives in turn. If (O1) has the result that\nthe beliefs we share commit us to a certain kind of entity then this\nrequires us either to accept an answer to a question about what there\nis in the sense of (O2) or to revise our beliefs. If we accept that\nthere is such an entity in (O2) then this invites questions in (O3)\nabout its nature and the general relations it has to other things we\nalso accept. On the other hand, investigations in (O3) into the nature\nof entities that we are not committed to and that we have no reason to\nbelieve exist would seem like a rather speculative project, though, of\ncourse, it could still be fun and interesting.\n",
