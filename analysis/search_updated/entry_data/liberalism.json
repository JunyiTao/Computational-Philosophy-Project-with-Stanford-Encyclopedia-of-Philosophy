    "main_text": "\n1. The Debate About Liberty\n1.1 The Presumption in Favor of Liberty\n\n\u201cBy definition,\u201d Maurice Cranston says, \u201ca liberal\nis a man who believes in liberty\u201d (1967: 459). In two ways,\nliberals accord liberty primacy as a political value.\n\n(i) Liberals have typically maintained that humans are naturally in\n\u201ca State of perfect Freedom to order their\nActions\u2026as they think fit\u2026without asking leave, or\ndepending on the Will of any other Man\u201d (Locke, 1960 [1689]:\n287). Mill too argued that \u201cthe burden of proof is supposed to\nbe with those who are against liberty; who contend for any restriction\nor prohibition\u2026. The a priori assumption is in favour\nof freedom\u2026\u201d (1963, vol. 21: 262). Recent liberal\nthinkers such as as Joel Feinberg (1984: 9), Stanley Benn (1988: 87)\nand John Rawls (2001: 44, 112) agree. Liberalism is a philosophy that\nstarts from a premise that political authority and law must be\njustified. If citizens are obliged to exercise self-restraint, and\nespecially if they are obliged to defer to someone else\u2019s authority,\nthere must be a reason why. Restrictions on liberty must be\njustified.\n\n(ii) That is to say, although no one classifies Hobbes as a liberal,\nthere is reason to regard Hobbes as an instigator of liberal\nphilosophy (see also Waldron 2001), for it was Hobbes who asked on\nwhat grounds citizens owe allegiance to the sovereign. Implicit in\nHobbes\u2019s question is a rejection of the presumption that\ncitizens are the king\u2019s property; on the contrary, kings are\nempowered by citizens who are themselves, initially, sovereign in the\nsense of having a meaningful right to say no. In the culture at large,\nthis view of the relation between citizen and king had been taking\nshape for centuries. The Magna Carta was a series of agreements,\nbeginning in 1215, arising out of disputes between the barons and King\nJohn. The Magna Carta eventually settled that the king is bound by the\nrule of law. In 1215, the Magna Carta was part of the beginning rather\nthan the end of the argument, but by the mid-1300s, concepts of\nindividual rights to trial by jury, due process, and equality before\nthe law were more firmly established. The Magna Carta was coming to be\nseen as vesting sovereignty not only in nobles but in \u201cthe\nPeople\u201d as such. By the mid-1400s, John Fortescue,\nEngland\u2019s Chief Justice from 1442 to 1461, would write The\nDifference Between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy, a plea for\nlimited monarchy that arguably represents the beginning of English\npolitical thought (Schmidtz and Brennan, 2010: chap. 2).\n\nHobbes generally is treated as one of the first and greatest social\ncontract thinkers. Typically, Hobbes also is seen as an advocate of\nabsolute sovereignty. On Hobbes\u2019s theory, Leviathan\u2019s\nauthority is almost absolute along a particular dimension: namely,\nLeviathan is authorized to do whatever it takes to keep the peace.\nThis special end justifies almost any means, including drastic\nlimitations on liberty. Yet, note the limitations implicit in the end\nitself. Leviathan\u2019s job is to keep the peace: not to do\neverything worth doing, but simply to secure the peace. Hobbes, the\nfamed absolutist, in fact developed a model of government sharply\nlimited in this most important way.\n\nParadigmatic liberals such as Locke also maintain that justified\nlimitations on liberty are fairly modest. Only a limited government\ncan be justified; indeed, the basic task of government is to protect\nthe equal liberty of citizens. Thus John Rawls\u2019s\nparadigmatically liberal first principle of justice: \u201cEach\nperson is to have an equal right to the most extensive system of equal\nbasic liberty compatible with a similar system for all\u201d (Rawls,\n1999b: 220).\n1.2 Negative Liberty\n\nLiberals disagree, however, about the concept of liberty, and as a\nresult the liberal ideal of protecting individual liberty can lead to\ndifferent conceptions of the task of government. Isaiah Berlin\nfamously advocated a negative conception of liberty:\n\nI am normally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of\nmen interferes with my activity. Political liberty in this sense is\nsimply the area within which a man can act unobstructed by others. If\nI am prevented by others from doing what I could otherwise do, I am to\nthat degree unfree; and if this area is contracted by other men beyond\na certain minimum, I can be described as being coerced, or, it may be,\nenslaved. Coercion is not, however, a term that covers every form of\ninability. If I say that I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the\nair, or cannot read because I am blind\u2026it would be eccentric to\nsay that I am to that degree enslaved or coerced. Coercion implies the\ndeliberate interference of other human beings within the area in which\nI could otherwise act. You lack political liberty or freedom only if\nyou are prevented from attaining a goal by human beings (Berlin, 1969:\n122).\n\n\nFor Berlin and those who follow him, then, the heart of liberty is the\nabsence of coercion by other agents; consequently, the liberal\nstate\u2019s commitment to protecting liberty is, essentially, the\njob of ensuring that citizens do not coerce each other without\ncompelling justification. So understood, negative liberty is a matter\nof which options are left to our discretion, or more precisely, which\noptions are foreclosed by the actions of others, and with what\nwarrant, and this is so regardless of whether we exercise such options\n(Taylor, 1979).\n1.3 Positive Liberty\n\nMany liberals have been attracted to more \u2018positive\u2019\nconceptions of liberty. Although Rousseau (1973 [1762]) seemed to\nadvocate a positive conception of liberty, according to which one was\nfree when one acted according to one\u2019s true will (the general\nwill), the positive conception was best developed by the British\nneo-Hegelians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nsuch as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet (2001 [1923]). Green\nacknowledged that \u201c\u2026it must be of course admitted that\nevery usage of the term [i.e., \u2018freedom\u2019] to express\nanything but a social and political relation of one man to other\ninvolves a metaphor\u2026It always implies\u2026some exemption\nfrom compulsion by another\u2026\u201d(1986 [1895]: 229).\nNevertheless, Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree in\nanother way, a psychological rather than political way, if he is\nsubject to an impulse or craving that cannot be controlled. Such a\nperson, Green argued, is \u201c\u2026in the condition of a bondsman\nwho is carrying out the will of another, not his own\u201d (1986\n[1895]: 228). Just as a slave is not doing what he really\nwants to do, one who is, say, an alcoholic, is being led by a craving\nto look for satisfaction where it cannot, ultimately, be found.\n\nFor Green, a person is free only if she is self-directed or\nautonomous. Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of\na free person as one whose actions are in some sense her own.\nIn this sense, positive liberty is an exercise-concept. One\nis free merely to the degree that one has effectively determined\noneself and the shape of one\u2019s life (Taylor, 1979). Such a\nperson is not subject to compulsions, critically reflects on her\nideals and so does not unreflectively follow custom, and does not\nignore her long-term interests for short-term pleasures. This ideal of\nfreedom as autonomy has its roots not only in Rousseau\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s political theory, but also in John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nOn Liberty. And today it is a dominant strain in liberalism,\nas witnessed by the work of S.I. Benn (1988), Gerald Dworkin (1988),\nand Joseph Raz (1986); see also the essays in Christman and Anderson\n(2005).\n\nGreen\u2019s autonomy-based conception of positive freedom is often\nrun together with a notion of \u2018positive\u2019 freedom: freedom\nas effective power to act or to pursue one\u2019s ends. In the words\nof the British socialist R. H. Tawney, freedom thus understood is\n\u2018the ability to act\u2019 (1931: 221; see also Gaus, 2000; ch.\n5.) On this positive conception, a person not prohibited from being a\nmember of a Country Club but too poor to afford membership is not free\nto be a member: she lacks an effective power to act. Positive freedom\nqua effective power to act closely ties freedom to material\nresources. (Education, for example, should be easily available so that\nall can develop their capacities.) It was this conception of positive\nliberty that Hayek had in mind when he insisted that although\n\u201cfreedom and wealth are both good things\u2026they still\nremain different\u201d (1960: 17\u201318). To Hayek, wealth implies\ncapability in a way that freedom does not.\n1.4 Republican Liberty\n\nAn older notion of liberty that has recently resurfaced is the\nrepublican, or neo-Roman, conception of liberty, which has roots in\nthe writings of Cicero and Niccolo Machiavelli (1950 [1513]).\nAccording to Philip Pettit,\n\nThe contrary of the liber, or free, person in Roman,\nrepublican usage was the servus, or slave, and up to at least\nthe beginning of the last century, the dominant connotation of\nfreedom, emphasized in the long republican tradition, was not having\nto live in servitude to another: not being subject to the arbitrary\npower of another (Pettit, 1996: 576).\n\n\nOn this view, the opposite of freedom is domination. To be unfree is\nto be \u201csubject to the potentially capricious will or the\npotentially idiosyncratic judgement of another\u201d (Pettit, 1997:\n5). The ideal liberty-protecting government, then, ensures that no\nagent, including the government, has arbitrary power over any citizen.\nThis is accomplished through an equal disbursement of power. Each\nperson has power that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily\ninterfere with her activities (Pettit, 1997: 67).\n\nThe republican conception of liberty is distinct from both Greenian\npositive and negative conceptions. Unlike Greenian positive liberty,\nrepublican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational autonomy,\nrealizing one\u2019s true nature, or becoming one\u2019s higher\nself. When all dominating power has been dispersed, republican\ntheorists are generally silent about these goals (Larmore 2001).\nUnlike negative liberty, republican liberty is primarily focused upon\n\u201cdefenseless susceptibility to interference, rather than actual\ninterference\u201d (Pettit, 1996: 577). Thus, in contrast to the\nordinary negative conception, on the republican conception the mere\npossibility of arbitrary interference is a limitation of\nliberty. Republican liberty thus seems to involve a modal claim about\nthe possibility of interference, and this is often cashed out in terms\nof complex counterfactual claims. It is not clear whether these claims\ncan be adequately explicated (Gaus, 2003; cf. Larmore, 2004).\n\nSome republican theorists, such as Quentin Skinner (1998: 113),\nMaurizio Viroli (2002: 6) and Pettit (1997: 8\u201311), view\nrepublicanism as an alternative to liberalism. When republican liberty\nis seen as a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society,\nthis is plausible (Gaus, 2003b). However, when liberalism is\nunderstood more expansively, and not so closely tied to either\nnegative liberty or market society, republicanism becomes\nindistinguishable from liberalism (Ghosh, 2008; Rogers, 2008; Larmore,\n2001; Dagger, 1997).\n2. The Debate Between the \u2018Old\u2019 and the \u2018New\u2019\n2.1 Classical Liberalism\n\nLiberal political theory, then, fractures over how to conceive of\nliberty. In practice, another crucial fault line concerns the moral\nstatus of private property and the market order. For classical\nliberals \u2014 \u2018old\u2019 liberals \u2014 liberty and\nprivate property are intimately related. From the eighteenth century\nto the present day, classical liberals have insisted that an economic\nsystem based on private property is uniquely consistent with\nindividual liberty, allowing each to live her life \u2014including\nemploying her labor and her capital \u2014 as she sees fit. Indeed,\nclassical liberals and libertarians have often asserted that in some\nway liberty and property are really the same thing; it has been\nargued, for example, that all rights, including liberty rights, are\nforms of property; others have maintained that property is itself a\nform of freedom (Gaus, 1994; Steiner, 1994). A market order based on\nprivate property is thus seen as an embodiment of freedom\n(Robbins, 1961: 104). Unless people are free to make contracts and\nsell their labour, save and invest their incomes as they see fit, and\nfree to launch enterprises as they raise the capital, they are not\nreally free.\n\nClassical liberals employ a second argument connecting liberty and\nprivate property. Rather than insisting that the freedom to obtain and\nemploy private property is simply one aspect of people\u2019s\nliberty, this second argument insists that private property\neffectively protects liberty, and no protection can be effective\nwithout private property. Here the idea is that the dispersion of\npower that results from a free market economy based on private\nproperty protects the liberty of subjects against encroachments by the\nstate. As F.A. Hayek argues, \u201cThere can be no freedom of press\nif the instruments of printing are under government control, no\nfreedom of assembly if the needed rooms are so controlled, no freedom\nof movement if the means of transport are a government monopoly\u201d\n(1978: 149).\n\nAlthough classical liberals agree on the fundamental importance of\nprivate property to a free society, the classical liberal tradition\nitself is a spectrum of views, from near-anarchist to those that\nattribute a significant role to the state in economic and social\npolicy (on this spectrum, see Mack and Gaus, 2004). At the libertarian\nend of the classical liberal spectrum are views of justified states as\nlegitimate monopolies that may with justice charge for essential\nrights-protection services: taxation is legitimate if necessary and\nsufficient for effective protection of liberty and property. Further\n\u2018leftward\u2019 we encounter classical liberal views that allow\ntaxation for public education in particular, and more generally for\npublic goods and social infrastructure. Moving yet further\n\u2018left\u2019, some classical liberal views allow for a modest\nsocial minimum.(e.g., Hayek, 1976: 87). Most nineteenth century\nclassical liberal economists endorsed a variety of state policies,\nencompassing not only the criminal law and enforcement of contracts,\nbut the licensing of professionals, health, safety and fire\nregulations, banking regulations, commercial infrastructure (roads,\nharbors and canals) and often encouraged unionization (Gaus, 1983b).\nAlthough classical liberalism today often is associated with\nlibertarianism, the broader classical liberal tradition was centrally\nconcerned with bettering the lot of the working class, women, blacks,\nimmigrants, and so on. The aim, as Bentham put it, was to make the\npoor richer, not the rich poorer (Bentham, 1952 [1795]: vol. 1, 226n).\nConsequently, classical liberals treat the leveling of wealth and\nincome as outside the purview of legitimate aims of government\ncoercion.\n2.2 The \u2018New Liberalism\u2019\n\nWhat has come to be known as \u2018new\u2019,\n\u2018revisionist\u2019, \u2018welfare state\u2019, or perhaps\nbest, \u2018social justice\u2019, liberalism challenges this\nintimate connection between personal liberty and a private property\nbased market order (Freeden, 1978; Gaus, 1983b; Paul, Miller and Paul,\n2007). Three factors help explain the rise of this revisionist theory.\nFirst, the new liberalism was clearly taking its own distinctive shape\nby the early twentieth century, as the ability of a free market to\nsustain what Lord Beveridge (1944: 96) called a \u2018prosperous\nequilibrium\u2019 was being questioned. Believing that a private\nproperty based market tended to be unstable, or could, as Keynes\nargued (1973 [1936]), get stuck in an equilibrium with high\nunemployment, new liberals came to doubt, initially on empirical\ngrounds, that classical liberalism was an adequate foundation for a\nstable, free society. Here the second factor comes into play: just as\nthe new liberals were losing faith in the market, their faith in\ngovernment as a means of supervising economic life was increasing.\nThis was partly due to the experiences of the First World War, in\nwhich government attempts at economic planning seemed to succeed\n(Dewey, 1929: 551\u201360); more importantly, this reevaluation of\nthe state was spurred by the democratization of western states, and\nthe conviction that, for the first time, elected officials could truly\nbe, in J.A. Hobson\u2019s phrase \u2018representatives of the\ncommunity\u2019 (1922: 49). As D.G. Ritchie proclaimed:\n\nbe it observed that arguments used against \u2018government\u2019\naction, where the government is entirely or mainly in the hands of a\nruling class or caste, exercising wisely or unwisely a paternal or\ngrandmotherly authority \u2014 such arguments lose their force just\nin proportion as the government becomes more and more genuinely the\ngovernment of the people by the people themselves. (1896: 64)\n\n\nThe third factor underlying the currency of the new liberalism was\nprobably the most fundamental: a growing conviction that, so far from\nbeing \u2018the guardian of every other right\u2019 (Ely, 1992: 26),\nproperty rights foster an unjust inequality of power. They entrench a\nmerely formal equality that in actual practice systematically fails to\nsecure the kind of equal positive liberty that matters on the ground\nfor the working class. This theme is central to what is now called\n\u2018liberalism\u2019 in American politics, combining a strong\nendorsement of civil and personal liberties with indifference or even\nhostility to private ownership. The seeds of this newer liberalism can\nbe found in Mill\u2019s On Liberty. Although Mill insisted\nthat the \u2018so-called doctrine of Free Trade\u2019 rested on\n\u2018equally solid\u2019 grounds as did the \u2018principle of\nindividual liberty\u2019 (1963, vol. 18: 293), he nevertheless\ninsisted that the justifications of personal and economic liberty were\ndistinct. And in his Principles of Political Economy, Mill\nconsistently emphasized that it is an open question whether personal\nliberty can flourish without private property (1963, vol. 2;\n203\u2013210), a view that Rawls was to reassert over a century later\n(2001: Part IV).\n2.3 Liberal Theories of Social Justice\n\nOne consequence of Rawls\u2019s great work, A Theory of\nJustice (1999 [first published in 1971]) is that the \u2018new\nliberalism\u2019 has become focused on developing a theory of social\njustice. Since the 1960s when Rawls began to publish the elements of\nhis emerging theory, liberal political philosophers have analyzed, and\ndisputed, his famous \u2018difference principle\u2019 according to\nwhich a just basic structure of society arranges social and economic\ninequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least\nwell off representative group (1999b:266). For Rawls, the default is\nnot liberty but rather an equal distribution of (basically) income and\nwealth; only inequalities that best enhance the long-term prospects of\nthe least advantaged are just. As Rawls sees it, the difference\nprinciple constitutes a public recognition of the principle of\nreciprocity: the basic structure is to be arranged such that no social\ngroup advances at the cost of another (2001: 122\u201324). Many\nfollowers of Rawls have focused less on the ideal of reciprocity than\non the commitment to equality (Dworkin, 2000). Indeed, what was\npreviously called \u2018welfare state\u2019 liberalism is now often\ndescribed as liberal egalitarianism. However, see Jan Narveson\u2019s\nessay on Hobbes\u2019s seeming defense of the welfare state (in\nCourtland 2018) for historical reflections on the difference.\n\nAnd in one way that is especially appropriate: in his later work Rawls\ninsists that welfare-state capitalism does not constitute a just basic\nstructure (2001: 137\u201338). If some version of capitalism is to be\njust it must be a \u2018property owning democracy\u2019 with a wide\ndiffusion of ownership; a market socialist regime, in Rawls\u2019s\nview, is more just than welfare-state capitalism (2001: 135-38). Not\ntoo surprisingly, classical liberals such as Hayek (1976) insist that\nthe contemporary liberal fixation on \u2018the mirage of social\njustice\u2019 leads modern liberals to ignore the extent to which, as\na matter of historical observation, freedom depends on a decentralized\nmarket based on private property, the overall results of which are\nunpredictable.\n\nThus, Robert Nozick (1974: 160ff) famously classifies Rawls\u2019s\ndifference principle as patterned but not historical: prescribing a\ndistribution while putting no moral weight on who produced the goods\nbeing distributed. One stark difference that emerges from this is that\nRawlsian liberalism\u2019s theory of justice is a theory about how to\ndistribute the pie while old liberalism\u2019s theory of justice is a\ntheory about how to treat bakers (Schmidtz, 2022).\n\nThe problem with patterned principles is that, in Nozick\u2019s\nwords, liberty upsets patterns. \u201cNo end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continuously\nrealized without continuous interference with people\u2019s\nlives\u201d (1974: 163). To illustrate, Nozick asks you to imagine\nthat society achieves a pattern of perfect justice by the lights of\nwhatever principle you prefer. Then someone offers Wilt Chamberlain a\ndollar for the privilege of watching Wilt play basketball. Before we\nknow it, thousands of people are paying Wilt a dollar each, every time\nWilt puts on a show. Wilt gets rich. The distribution is no longer\nequal, and no one complains. Nozick\u2019s question: If justice is a\npattern, achievable at a given moment, what happens if you achieve\nperfection? Must you then prohibit everything\u2014no further\nconsuming, creating, trading, or even giving\u2014so as not\nto upset the perfect pattern? Notice: Nozick neither argues nor\npresumes people can do whatever they want with their property. Nozick,\nrecalling the focus on connecting property rights to liberty that\nanimated liberalism in its classical form, notes that if there is\nanything at all people can do, even if the only thing they\nare free to do is give a coin to an entertainer, then even that\ntiniest of liberties will, over time, disturb the favored pattern.\nNozick is right that if we focus on time slices, we focus on isolated\nmoments, and take moments too seriously, when what matters is not the\npattern of holdings at a moment but the pattern of how people treat\neach other over time. Even tiny liberties must upset the pattern of a\nstatic moment. By the same token, however, there is no reason why\nliberty must upset an ongoing pattern of fair treatment. A moral\nprinciple forbidding racial discrimination, for example, prescribes no\nparticular end-state. Such a principle is what Nozick calls weakly\npatterned, sensitive to history as well as to pattern, and prescribing\nan ideal of how people should be treated without prescribing an\nend-state distribution. It affects the pattern without\nprescribing a pattern. And if a principle forbidding racial\ndiscrimination works its way into a society via cultural progress\nrather than legal intervention, it need not involve any interference\nwhatsoever. So, although Nozick sometimes speaks as if his critique\napplies to all patterns, we should take seriously his concession that\n\u201cweak\u201d patterns are compatible with liberty. Some may\npromote liberty, depending on how they are introduced and maintained.\nSee Schmidtz (2006: chap.6). For work by modern liberals that\nresonates with Nozick\u2019s dissection of the dimensions of equality\nthat plausibly can count as liberal, see also Anderson (1999), Young\n(1990), and Sen (1992).\n\nAccordingly, even granting to Nozick that time-slice principles\nlicense immense, constant, intolerable interference with everyday\nlife, there is some reason to doubt that Rawls intended to embrace any\nsuch view. In his first article, Rawls said, \u201cwe cannot\ndetermine the justness of a situation by examining it at a single\nmoment\u201d (1951: 191) Years later, Rawls added, \u201cIt is a\nmistake to focus attention on the varying relative positions of\nindividuals and to require that every change, considered as a single\ntransaction viewed in isolation, be in itself just. It is the\narrangement of the basic structure which is to be judged, and judged\nfrom a general point of view\u201d (1999b: 76). Thus, to Rawls, basic\nstructure\u2019s job is not to make every transaction work to the\nworking class\u2019s advantage, let alone to the advantage of each\nmember of the class. Rawls was more realistic than that. Instead, it\nis the trend of a whole society over time that is supposed to benefit\nthe working class as a class. To be sure, Rawls was a kind of\negalitarian, but the pattern Rawls meant to endorse was a pattern of\nequal status, applying not so much to a distribution as to an ongoing\nrelationship. This is not to say that Nozick\u2019s critique had no\npoint. Nozick showed what an alternative theory might look like,\nportraying Wilt Chamberlain as a separate person in a more robust\nsense (unencumbered by nebulous debts to society) than Rawls could\ncountenance. To Nozick, Wilt\u2019s advantages are not what Wilt\nfinds on the table; Wilt\u2019s advantages are what Wilt\nbrings to the table. And respecting what Wilt brings to the\ntable is the exact essence of respecting him as a separate person. In\npart due to Nozick, today\u2019s egalitarians now acknowledge that\nany equality worthy of aspiration will focus less on justice as a\nproperty of a time-slice distribution and more on how people are\ntreated: how they are rewarded for their contributions and\nenabled over time to make contributions worth rewarding.\n(Schmidtz, 2006).\n3. The Debate About the Comprehensiveness of Liberalism\n3.1 Political Liberalism\n\nAs his work evolved, Rawls (1996: 5ff) insisted that his liberalism\nwas not a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 doctrine, that is, one which\nincludes an overall theory of value, an ethical theory, an\nepistemology, or a controversial metaphysics of the person and\nsociety. Our modern societies, characterized by a \u2018reasonable\npluralism\u2019, are already filled with such doctrines. The aim of\npolitical liberalism is not to add yet another sectarian doctrine, but\nto provide a political framework that is neutral between such\ncontroversial comprehensive doctrines (Larmore, 1996: 121ff).\nRawls\u2019s notion of a purely political conception of liberalism\nseems more austere than the traditional liberal political theories\ndiscussed above, being largely restricted to constitutional principles\nupholding basic civil liberties and the democratic process.\n\nGaus (2004) argues that the distinction between\n\u2018political\u2019 and \u2018comprehensive\u2019 liberalism\nmisses a great deal. Liberal theories form a broad continuum, from\nthose that constitute full-blown philosophical systems, to those that\nrely on a full theory of value and the good, to those that rely on a\ntheory of the right (but not the good), all the way to those that seek\nto be purely political doctrines. Nevertheless, it is important to\nappreciate that, though we treat liberalism as primarily a political\ntheory, it has been associated with broader theories of ethics, value,\nand society. Indeed, many believe that liberalism cannot rid itself of\nall controversial metaphysical (Hampton, 1989) or epistemological\n(Raz, 1990) commitments.\n3.2 Liberal Ethics\n\nFollowing Wilhelm von Humboldt (1993 [1854]), in On Liberty\nMill argues that one basis for endorsing freedom (Mill\nbelieves there are many), is the goodness of developing individuality\nand cultivating capacities:\n\nIndividuality is the same thing with development, and\u2026it is\nonly the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce,\nwell-developed human beings\u2026what more can be said of any\ncondition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings\nthemselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or what worse can be\nsaid of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? (Mill,\n1963, vol. 18: 267)\n\n\nThis is not just a theory about politics: it is a substantive,\nperfectionist, moral theory about the good. On this view, the right\nthing to do is to promote development or perfection, but only a regime\nsecuring extensive liberty for each person can accomplish this (Wall,\n1998). This moral ideal of human perfection and development dominated\nliberal thinking in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and\nmuch of the twentieth: not only Mill, but T.H. Green, L.T. Hobhouse,\nBernard Bosanquet, John Dewey and even Rawls show allegiance to\nvariants of this perfectionist ethic and the claim that it provides a\nfoundation for endorsing a regime of liberal rights (Gaus, 1983a). And\nit is fundamental to the proponents of liberal autonomy discussed\nabove, as well as \u2018liberal virtue\u2019 theorists such as\nWilliam Galston (1980). That the good life is necessarily a freely\nchosen one in which a person develops his unique capacities as part of\na plan of life is probably the dominant liberal ethic of the past\ncentury.\n\nThe main challenge to Millian perfectionism\u2019s status as the\ndistinctly liberal ethic comes from moral\ncontractualism/contractarianism, which can be divided into what might\nvery roughly be labeled \u2018Kantian\u2019 and\n\u2018Hobbesian\u2019 versions. According to Kantian contractualism,\n\u201csociety, being composed of a plurality of persons, each with\nhis own aims, interests, and conceptions of the good, is best arranged\nwhen it is governed by principles that do not themselves\npresuppose any particular conception of the good\u2026\u201d\n(Sandel, 1982: 1). On this view, respect for the personhood of others\ndemands that we refrain from imposing our view of the good life on\nthem. Only principles that can be justified to all respect the\npersonhood of each. We thus witness the tendency of recent liberal\ntheory (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1998) to transform the social contract\nfrom an account of the state to an overall justification of morality,\nor at least a social morality. This is not to deny, however, that\nliberalism is, after all, essentially a view that there is such a\nthing as minding one\u2019s own business, and that there is a sphere within\nwhich we have the right to say \u201cIt\u2019s my life\u201d while politely declining\ninvitations to justify ourselves. Liberalism is the idea that there\nare limits to any need for public justification.\n\nIn contrast, distinctively Hobbesian contractarianism supposes only\nthat individuals are self-interested and correctly perceive that each\nperson\u2019s ability to effectively pursue her interests is enhanced\nby a framework of norms that structure social life and divide the\nfruits of social cooperation (Gauthier, 1986; Hampton, 1986; Kavka,\n1986). Morality, then, is a common framework that advances the\nself-interest of each. The claim of Hobbesian contractarianism to be a\ndistinctly liberal conception of morality stems from the importance of\nindividual freedom and property in such a common framework: only\nsystems of norms that allow each person great freedom to pursue her\ninterests as she sees fit could, it is argued, be the object of\nconsensus among self-interested agents (Courtland, 2008; Gaus, 2012;\nRidge, 1998; Gauthier, 1995). The continuing problem for Hobbesian\ncontractarianism is the apparent rationality of free-riding: if\neveryone (or enough) complies with the terms of the contract, and so\nsocial order is achieved, it would seem rational to defect, and act\nimmorally when one can gain by doing so. This is essentially the\nargument of Hobbes\u2019s \u2018Foole\u2019, and from Hobbes (1948\n[1651]: 94ff) to Gauthier (1986: 160ff), Hobbesians have tried to\nreply to it.\n3.3 Liberal Theories of Value\n\nTurning from rightness to goodness, we can identify three main\ncandidates for a liberal theory of value. We have already encountered\nthe first: perfectionism. Insofar as perfectionism is a theory of\nright action, it can be understood as an account of morality.\nObviously, however, it is an account of rightness that presupposes a\ntheory of value or the good: the ultimate human value is developed\npersonality or an autonomous life. Competing with this objectivist\ntheory of value are two other liberal accounts: pluralism and\nsubjectivism.\n\nIn his famous defence of negative liberty, Berlin insisted that values\nor ends are plural, and further, the pursuit of one end necessarily\nimplies that other ends will not be achieved. In this sense ends\ncollide. In economic terms, the pursuit of one end entails opportunity\ncosts: foregone pursuits which cannot be impersonally shown to be less\nworthy. There is no interpersonally justifiable way to rank the ends,\nand no way to achieve them all. Each person must devote herself to\nsome ends at the cost of ignoring others. For the pluralist, then,\nautonomy, perfection or development are not necessarily ranked higher\nthan hedonistic pleasures, environmental preservation or economic\nequality. All compete for our allegiance, but because they are\nincommensurable, no choice can be interpersonally justified.\n\nThe pluralist is not a subjectivist: that values are many, competing\nand incommensurable does not imply that they are somehow dependent on\nsubjective experiences. But the claim that what a person values rests\non experiences that vary from person to person has long been a part of\nthe liberal tradition. To Hobbes, what one values depends on what one\ndesires (1948 [1651]: 48). Locke advances a \u2018taste theory of\nvalue\u2019:\n\nThe Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will\nas fruitlessly endeavour to delight all Man with Riches or Glory,\n(which yet some Men place their Happiness in,) as you would satisfy\nall men\u2019s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which, though very\nagreeable and delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous\nand offensive: And many People would with reason preferr [sic] the\ngriping of an hungry Belly, to those Dishes, which are a Feast to\nothers. Hence it was, I think, that the Philosophers of old did in\nvain enquire, whether the Summum bonum consisted in Riches,\nor bodily Delights, or Virtue, or Contemplation: And they might have\nas reasonably disputed, whether the best Relish were to be found in\nApples, Plumbs or Nuts; and have divided themselves into Sects upon\nit. For\u2026pleasant Tastes depend not on the things themselves,\nbut their agreeableness to this or that particulare Palate, wherein\nthere is great variety\u2026(1975 [1706]: 269).\n\n\nThe perfectionist, the pluralist and the subjectivist concur on the\ncrucial point: the nature of value is such that reasonable people\npursue different ways of living. To the perfectionist, this is because\neach person has unique capacities, the development of which confers\nvalue on her life; to the pluralist, it is because values are many and\nconflicting, and no one life can include them all, or make the\ninterpersonally correct choice among them; and to the subjectivist, it\nis because our ideas about what is valuable stem from our desires or\ntastes, and these differ from one individual to another. All three\nviews, then, defend the basic liberal idea that people rationally\nfollow different ways of living. But in themselves, such notions of\nthe good are not full-fledged liberal ethics, for an additional\nargument is required linking liberal value with norms of equal\nliberty, and to the idea that other people command a certain respect\nand a certain deference simply by virtue of having values of their\nown. To be sure, Berlin seems to believe this is a very quick\nargument: the inherent plurality of ends points to the\npolitical preeminence of liberty (see, for example, Gray:\n2006). Guaranteeing each a measure of negative liberty is, Berlin\nargues, the most humane ideal, as it recognizes that \u2018human\ngoals are many\u2019, and no one can make a choice that is right for\nall people (1969: 171). It is here that subjectivists and pluralists\nalike sometimes rely on versions of moral contractualism. Those who\ninsist that liberalism is ultimately nihilistic can be interpreted as\narguing that this transition cannot be made successfully: liberals, on\ntheir view, are stuck with a subjectivistic or pluralistic theory of\nvalue, and no account of the right emerges from it.\n3.4 The Metaphysics of Liberalism\n\nThroughout the last century, liberalism has been beset by\ncontroversies between, on the one hand, those broadly identified as\n\u2018individualists\u2019 and, on the other,\n\u2018collectivists\u2019, \u2018communitarians\u2019 or\n\u2018organicists\u2019 (for skepticism about this, though, see\nBird, 1999). These vague and sweeping designations have been applied\nto a wide array of disputes; we focus here on controversies concerning\n(i) the nature of society; (ii) the nature of the self.\n\nLiberalism is, of course, usually associated with individualist\nanalyses of society. \u2018Human beings in society\u2019, Mill\nclaimed, \u2018have no properties but those which are derived from,\nand which may be resolved into, the laws of the nature of individual\nmen\u2019 (1963, Vol. 8: 879; see also Bentham: 1970 [1823]: chap. I,\nsec. 4). Herbert Spencer agreed: \u201cthe properties of the mass are\ndependent upon the attributes of its component parts\u201d (1995\n[1851]: 1). In the last years of the nineteenth century this\nindividualist view was increasingly subject to attack, especially by\nthose who were influenced by idealist philosophy. D. G. Ritche,\ncriticizing Spencer\u2019s individualist liberalism, denies that\nsociety is simply a \u2018heap\u2019 of individuals, insisting that\nit is more akin to an organism, with a complex internal life (1896:\n13). Liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and Dewey refused to adopt\nradically collectivist views such as those advocated by Bernard\nBosanquet (2001), but they too rejected the radical individualism of\nBentham, Mill and Spencer. Throughout most of the first half of the\ntwentieth century such \u2018organic\u2019 analyses of society held\nsway in liberal theory, even in economics (see A.F Mummery and J. A.\nHobson, 1956: 106; J.M. Keynes, 1972: 275).\n\nDuring and after the Second World War the idea that liberalism was\nbased on inherently individualist analysis of humans-in-society arose\nagain. Karl Popper\u2019s The Open Society and its Enemies\n(1945) presented a sustained critique of Hegelian and Marxist theory\nand its collectivist and historicist, and to Popper, inherently\nilliberal, understanding of society. The reemergence of economic\nanalysis in liberal theory brought to the fore a thoroughgoing\nmethodological individualism. Writing in the early 1960s, James\nBuchanan and Gordon Tullock adamantly defended the\n\u2018individualistic postulate\u2019 against all forms of\n\u2018organicism\u2019: \u201cThis [organicist] approach or theory\nof the collectivity\u2026.is essentially opposed to the Western\nphilosophical tradition in which the human individual is the primary\nphilosophical entity\u201d (1965: 11\u201312). Human beings,\ninsisted Buchanan and Tullock, are the only real choosers and\ndecision-makers, and their preferences determine both public and\nprivate actions. The renascent individualism of late-twentieth century\nliberalism was closely bound up with the induction of Hobbes as a\nmember of the liberal pantheon. Hobbes\u2019s relentlessly\nindividualistic account of society, and the manner in which his\nanalysis of the state of nature lent itself to game-theoretical\nmodeling, yielded a highly individualist, formal analysis of the\nliberal state and liberal morality.\n\nOf course, as is widely known, we have recently witnessed a renewed\ninterest in collectivist analyses of liberal society \u2014though the\nterm \u2018collectivist\u2019 is abjured in favor of\n\u2018communitarian\u2019. Writing in 1985, Amy Gutmann observed\nthat \u201cwe are witnessing a revival of communitarian criticisms of\nliberal political theory. Like the critics of the 1960s, those of the\n1980s fault liberalism for being mistakenly and irreparably\nindividualistic\u201d (1985: 308). Starting with Michael\nSandel\u2019s (1982) famous criticism of Rawls, a number of critics\ncharge that liberalism is necessarily premised on an abstract\nconception of individual selves as pure choosers, whose commitments,\nvalues and concerns are possessions of the self, but never constitute\nthe self. Although the \u2018liberal-communitarian\u2019 debate\nultimately involved wide-ranging moral, political and sociological\ndisputes about the nature of communities, and the rights and\nresponsibilities of their members, the heart of the debate was about\nthe nature of liberal selves. For Sandel the flaw at the heart of\nRawls\u2019s liberalism is its implausibly abstract theory of the\nself, the pure autonomous chooser. Rawls, he charges, ultimately\nassumes that it makes sense to identify us with a pure capacity for\nchoice, and that such pure choosers might reject any or all of their\nattachments and values and yet retain their identity.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s onwards various liberals sought to show how\nliberalism may consistently advocate a theory of the self which finds\nroom for cultural membership and other non-chosen attachments and\ncommitments which at least partially constitute the self (Kymlicka,\n1989). Much of liberal theory has became focused on the issue as to\nhow we can be social creatures, members of cultures and raised in\nvarious traditions, while also being autonomous choosers who employ\nour liberty to construct lives of our own.\n4. The Debate About The Reach of Liberalism\n4.1 Is Liberalism Justified in All Political Communities?\n\nIn On Liberty Mill argued that \u201cLiberty, as a\nprinciple, has no application to any state of things anterior to the\ntime when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and\nequal discussion\u201d (1963, vol. 18: 224). Thus \u201cDespotism is\na legitimate form of government in dealing with barbarians, provided\nthe end be their improvement\u2026\u201d (1963, vol. 18: 224). This\npassage \u2014 infused with the spirit of nineteenth century\nimperialism (and perhaps, as some maintain, latent racism) \u2014 is\noften ignored by defenders of Mill as an embarrassment (Parekh, 1994;\nParekh, 1995; Mehta, 1999; Pitts, 2005).This is not to say that such\nMillian passages are without thoughtful defenders. See, for example,\nInder Marawah (2011). Nevertheless, it raises a question that still\ndivides liberals: are liberal political principles justified for all\npolitical communities? In The Law of Peoples Rawls argues\nthat they are not. According to Rawls there can be a \u2018decent\nhierarchical society\u2019 which is not based on the liberal\nconception of all persons as free and equal, but instead views persons\nas \u201cresponsible and cooperating members of their respective\ngroups\u201d but not inherently equal (1999a: 66). Given this, the\nfull liberal conception of justice cannot be constructed out of shared\nideas of this \u2018people\u2019, though basic human rights,\nimplicit in the very idea of a social cooperative structure, apply to\nall peoples. David Miller (2002) develops a different defense of this\nanti-universalistic position, while those such as Thomas Pogge (2002:\nch. 4) and Martha Nussbaum (2002) reject Rawls\u2019s position,\ninstead advocating versions of moral universalism: they claim that\nliberal moral principles apply to all states.\n4.2 Is Liberalism a Cosmopolitan or a State-centered Theory?\n\nThe debate about whether liberal principles apply to all political\ncommunities should not be confused with the debate as to whether\nliberalism is a state-centered theory, or whether, at least ideally,\nit is a cosmopolitan political theory for the community of all\nhumankind. Immanuel Kant \u2014 a moral universalist if ever there\nwas one \u2014 argued that all states should respect the dignity of\ntheir citizens as free and equal persons, yet denied that humanity\nforms one political community. Thus he rejected the ideal of a\nuniversal cosmopolitan liberal political community in favor of a world\nof states, all with internally just constitutions, and united in a\nconfederation to assure peace (1970 [1795]).\n\nOn a classical liberal theory, the difference between a world of\nliberal communities and a world liberal community is not of\nfundamental importance. Since the aim of government in a community is\nto assure the basic liberty and property rights of its citizens,\nborders are not of great moral significance in classical liberalism\n(Lomasky, 2007). In contrast under the \u2018new\u2019 liberalism,\nwhich stresses redistributive programs to achieve social justice, it\nmatters a great deal who is included within the political or moral\ncommunity. If liberal principles require significant redistribution,\nthen it is crucially important whether these principles apply only\nwithin particular communities, or whether their reach is global. Thus\na fundamental debate between Rawls and many of his followers is\nwhether the difference principle should only be applied within a\nliberal state such as the United States (where the least well off are\nthe least well off Americans), or whether it should be applied\nglobally (where the least well off are the least well off in the\nworld) (Rawls, 1999a: 113ff; Beitz, 1973: 143ff; Pogge, 1989: Part\nThree).\n4.3 Liberal Interaction with Non-Liberal Groups: International\n\nLiberal political theory also fractures concerning the appropriate\nresponse to groups (cultural, religious, etc.) which endorse illiberal\npolicies and values. These groups may deny education to some of their\nmembers, advocate female genital mutilation, restrict religious\nfreedom, maintain an inequitable caste system, and so on. When, if\never, should a liberal group interfere with the internal governance of\nan illiberal group?\n\nSuppose first that the illiberal group is another political community\nor state. Can liberals intervene in the affairs of non-liberal states?\nMill provides a complicated answer in his 1859 essay \u2018A Few\nWords on Non-Intervention\u2019. Reiterating his claim from On\nLiberty that civilized and non-civilized countries are to be\ntreated differently, he insists that \u201cbarbarians have no rights\nas a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the\nearliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral\nlaws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government,\nare the universal rules of morality between man and man\u201d (1963,\nvol. 21: 119). Although this strikes us today as simply a case for an\nobjectionable paternalistic imperialism (and it certainly was such a\ncase), Mill\u2019s argument for the conclusion is more complex,\nincluding a claim that, since international morality depends on\nreciprocity, \u2018barbarous\u2019 governments that cannot be\ncounted on to engage in reciprocal behavior have no rights\nqua governments. In any event, when Mill turns to\ninterventions among \u2018civilized\u2019 peoples he develops an\naltogether more sophisticated account as to when one state can\nintervene in the affairs of another to protect liberal principles.\nHere Mill is generally against intervention. \u201cThe reason is,\nthat there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that\nintervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people\nthemselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a\npeople\u2019s having become fit for popular institutions, is that\nthey, or a sufficient proportion of them to prevail in the contest,\nare willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation\u201d\n(1963, vol. 21: 122).\n\nIn addition to questions of efficacy, to the extent that peoples or\ngroups have rights to collective self-determination, intervention by a\nliberal group to induce a non-liberal community to adopt liberal\nprinciples will be morally objectionable. As with individuals,\nliberals may think that peoples or groups have freedom to make\nmistakes in managing their collective affairs. If people\u2019s\nself-conceptions are based on their participation in such groups, even\nthose whose liberties are denied may object to, and perhaps in some\nway be harmed by, the imposition of liberal principles (Margalit and\nRaz, 1990; Tamir, 1993). Thus rather than proposing a doctrine of\nintervention, many liberals propose various principles of\ntoleration which specify to what extent liberals must\ntolerate non-liberal peoples and cultures. As is usual, Rawls\u2019s\ndiscussion is subtle and enlightening. In his account of the foreign\naffairs of liberal peoples, Rawls argues that liberal peoples must\ndistinguish \u2018decent\u2019 non-liberal societies from\n\u2018outlaw\u2019 and other states; the former have a claim on\nliberal peoples to tolerance while the latter do not (1999a:\n59\u201361). Decent peoples, argues Rawls, \u2018simply do not\ntolerate\u2019 outlaw states which ignore human rights: such states\nmay be subject to \u2018forceful sanctions and even to\nintervention\u2019 (1999a: 81). In contrast, Rawls insists that\n\u201cliberal peoples must try to encourage [non-liberal] decent\npeoples and not frustrate their vitality by coercively insisting that\nall societies be liberal\u201d (1999a: 62). Chandran Kukathas (2003)\n\u2014 whose liberalism derives from the classical tradition \u2014\nis inclined to almost complete toleration of non-liberal peoples, with\nthe non-trivial proviso that there must be exit rights.\n4.4 Liberal Interaction with Non-Liberal Groups: Domestic\n\nThe status of non-liberal groups within liberal societies has\nincreasingly become a subject of debate, especially with respect to\nsome citizens of faith. We should distinguish two questions: (i) to\nwhat extent should non-liberal cultural and religious communities be\nexempt from the requirements of the liberal state? and, (ii) to what\nextent can they be allowed to participate in decision-making in the\nliberal state?\n\nTurning to (i), liberalism has a long history of seeking to\naccommodate religious groups that have deep objections to certain\npublic policies, such as the Quakers, Mennonites or Sikhs. The most\ndifficult issues in this regard arise in relation to children and\neducation (see Galston, 2003; Fowler, 2010; Andersson, 2011) Mill, for\nexample, writes:\n\nConsider \u2026 the case of education. Is it not almost a\nself-evident axiom, that the State should require and compel the\neducation, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is born\nits citizen? Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognize and\nassert this truth? Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of\nthe most sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand,\nthe father), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to\nthat being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life\ntowards others and towards himself \u2026 . that to bring a child\ninto existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to\nprovide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind,\nis a moral crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and against\nsociety \u2026 . (1963, vol. 18)\n\n\nOver the last thirty years, there has been a particular case that is\nat the core of this debate \u2014 Wisconsin vs. Yoder: [406\nU.S. 205 (1972)]. In this case, the United States Supreme Court upheld\nthe right of Amish parents to avoid compulsory schooling laws and\nremove their children from school at the age of 14 \u2014 thus,\naccording to the Amish, avoiding secular influences that might\nundermine the traditional Amish way of life. Because cultural and\nreligious communities raise and educate children, they cannot be seen\nas purely voluntary opt-outs from the liberal state: they exercise\ncoercive power over children, and so basic liberal principles about\nprotecting the innocent from unjustified coercion come into play. Some\nhave maintained that liberal principles require that the state should\nintervene (against groups like the Amish) in order to [1] provide the\nchildren with an effective right of exit that would otherwise be\ndenied via a lack of education (Okin, 2002), [2] to protect the\nchildren\u2019s right to an autonomous and \u2018open future\u2019\n(Feinberg, 1980) and/or [3] to insure that children will have the\ncognitive tools to prepare them for their future role as citizens\n(Galston, 1995: p. 529; Macedo, 1995: pp. 285\u20136). Other liberal\ntheorists, on the other hand, have argued that the state should not\nintervene because it might undermine the inculcation of certain values\nthat are necessary for the continued existence of certain\ncomprehensive doctrines (Galston, 1995: p. 533; Stolzenberg, 1993: pp.\n582\u20133). Moreover, some such as Harry Brighouse (1998) have\nargued that the inculcation of liberal values through compulsory\neducation might undermine the legitimacy of liberal states because\nchildren would not (due to possible indoctrination) be free to consent\nto such institutions.\n\nQuestion (ii) \u2014 the extent to which non-liberal beliefs and\nvalues may be employed in liberal political discussion\u2014 has\nbecome the subject of sustained debate in the years following\nRawls\u2019s Political Liberalism. According to\nRawls\u2019s liberalism \u2014 and what we might call \u2018public\nreason liberalism\u2019 more generally \u2014 because our societies\nare characterized by \u2018reasonable pluralism\u2019, coercion\ncannot be justified on the basis of comprehensive moral or religious\nsystems of belief. But many friends of religion (e.g., Eberle, 2002;\nPerry, 1993) argue that this is objectionably\n\u2018exclusionary\u2019: conscientious believers are barred from\nvoting on their deepest convictions. Again liberals diverge in their\nresponses. Some such as Stephen Macedo take a pretty hard-nosed\nattitude: \u2018if some people\u2026feel \u201csilenced\u201d or\n\u201cmarginalized\u201d by the fact that some of us believe that it\nis wrong to shape basic liberties on the basis of religious or\nmetaphysical claims, I can only say \u201cgrow up!\u201d\u2019\n(2000: 35). Rawls, in contrast, seeks to be more accommodating,\nallowing that arguments based on religious comprehensive doctrines may\nenter into liberal politics on issues of basic justice \u201cprovided\nthat, in due course, we give properly public reasons to support the\nprinciples and policies that our comprehensive doctrine is said to\nsupport\u201d (1999a: 144). Thus Rawls allows the legitimacy of\nreligious-based arguments against slavery and in favor of the United\nStates civil rights movement, because ultimately such arguments were\nsupported by public reasons. Others (e.g., Greenawalt, 1995) hold that\neven this is too restrictive: it is difficult for liberals to justify\na moral prohibition on a religious citizen from voicing her view in\nliberal political debate.\n5. Conclusion\n\nGiven that liberalism fractures on so many issues \u2014 the nature\nof liberty, the place of property and democracy in a just society, the\ncomprehensiveness and the reach of the liberal ideal \u2014 one might\nwonder whether there is any point in talking of\n\u2018liberalism\u2019 at all. It is not, though, an unimportant or\ntrivial thing that all these theories take liberty to be the grounding\npolitical value. Radical democrats assert the overriding value of\nequality, communitarians maintain that the demands of belongingness\ntrump freedom, and conservatives complain that the liberal devotion to\nfreedom undermines traditional values and virtues and so social order\nitself. Intramural disputes aside, liberals join in rejecting these\nconceptions of political right.\n",
