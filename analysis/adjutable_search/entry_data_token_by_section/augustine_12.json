    "main_text": "Ethics || Grace, Predestination and Original Sin\n7.6 Grace, Predestination and Original Sin).\n\nThe most lasting philosophical influence on Augustine is Neoplatonism.\nHe does not specify the authors and the exact subjects of the\n\u201cbooks of the Platonists\u201d (Confessiones 7.13)\ntranslated into Latin by the fourth century Christian Neoplatonist\nMarius Victorinus (ib. 8.3) he read in 386. In the twentieth century\nthere was an ongoing and sometimes heated debate on whether to\nprivilege Plotinus (who is mentioned in De beata vita 4) or\nPorphyry (who is named first in De consensus evangelistarum\n1.23 ca. 400) as the main Neoplatonic influence on Augustine (for\nsummaries of the debate see O\u2019Donnell 1992: II 421\u2013424;\nKany 2007: 50\u201361). Today most scholars accept the compromise\nthat the \u201cbooks of the Platonists\u201d comprised some\ntreatises of Plotinus (e.g., Enneads I.6, I.2, V.1,\nVI.4\u20135) and a selection from Porphyry (Sententiae and,\nperhaps, Symmikta Zetemata). In any event, the importance of\nthis problem should not be overrated because Augustine seems to have\ncontinued his Neoplatonic readings after 386. Around 400 he had\nPorphyry\u2019s Philosophy from the Oracles at his disposal;\nin De civitate dei 10 (ca. 417) he quotes from his Letter\nto Anebo and from an otherwise unattested anagogic treatise\ntitled, in the translation used by Augustine, De regressu\nanimae, the influence of which some have suspected already in\nAugustine\u2019s earliest works. For the philosophy of mind in the\nsecond half of De trinitate he may have turned to Neoplatonic\ntexts on psychology. While the exact sources of Augustine\u2019s\nNeoplatonism elude us, source criticism has been able to determine\nsome pervasive features of his thought that are doubtlessly\nNeoplatonic in origin: the transcendence and immateriality of God; the\nsuperiority of the unchangeable over the changeable (cf. Plato,\nTimaeus 28d); the ontological hierarchy of God, soul and body\n(Letter 18.2); the incorporeality and immortality of the\nsoul; the dichotomy of the intelligible and the sensible realms\n(attributed to Plato in Contra Academicos 3.37); the\nnon-spatial omnipresence of the intelligible in the sensible\n(Confessiones 1.2\u20134; Letter 137.4) and the\ncausal presence of God in his creation (De immortalitate\nanimae 14\u201315; De Genesi ad litteram 4.12.22); the\nexistence of intelligible (Platonic) Forms that are located in the\nmind of God and work as paradigms of the sensible things (De\ndiversis quaestionibus 46); the inwardness of the intelligible\nand the idea that we find God and Truth by turning inwards (De\nvera religione 72); the doctrine of evil as lack or privation of\ngoodness; the understanding of the soul\u2019s love of God as a\nquasi-erotic desire for true beauty (Confessiones 10.38; cf.\nRist 1994: 155). A distinctly Platonic element is the notion of\nintellectual or spiritual ascent. Augustine thinks that by turning\ninwards and upwards from bodies to soul (i.e., from knowledge of\nobjects to self-knowledge) and from the sensible to the intelligible\nwe will finally be able to transcend ourselves and get in touch with\nthe supreme being that is none other than God and Truth and that is\nmore internal to us than our innermost self (Confessiones\n3.11; MacDonald 2014: 22\u201326; Augustine\u2019s biblical proof\ntext is Romans 1:20, quoted, e.g., ib. 7.16). Ascents of this kind are\nubiquitous in Augustine\u2019s work (e.g., De libero\narbitrio 2.7\u201339; Confessiones 10.8\u201338;\nDe trinitate 8\u201315). Whether the condensed versions in\nthe Confessiones (7.16; 7.23; 9.24\u201326) should be read\nas reports of mystical experiences is difficult to determine (Cassin\n2017). An early version of the Augustinian ascent is the\nproject\u2014outlined in De ordine (2.24\u201352) but soon\nabandoned and virtually retracted in De doctrina\nchristiana\u2014of turning the mind to the intelligible and to\nGod by means of a cursus in the liberal (especially mathematical)\ndisciplines (Pollmann & Vessey 2005). It is remotely inspired by\nPlato\u2019s Republic and may have had a Neoplatonic precedent\n(Hadot 2005), though use of Varro\u2019s work on the disciplines\ncannot be excluded (Shanzer 2005). As late as De civitate dei\n8 (ca. 417) he grants, in a brief doxography organized according to\nthe traditional fields of physics, ethics and epistemology, that\nPlatonism and Christianity share some basic philosophical insights,\nviz. that God is the first principle, that he is the supreme good and\nthat he is the criterion of knowledge (De civitate dei\n8.5\u20138; cf. already De vera religione 3\u20137). In\nspite of these important insights, Platonism cannot however lead to\nsalvation because it is unable or unwilling to accept the mediation of\nChrist. It is, therefore, also philosophically defective (De\ncivitate dei 10.32).\n\nCicero is Augustine\u2019s main source for the Hellenistic\nphilosophies, notably Academic skepticism and Stoicism. As a part of\nhis cultural heritage, Augustine quotes him and the other Latin\nclassics as it suits his argumentative purposes (Hagendahl 1967). His\nearly ideal of the sage who is independent of all goods that one can\nlose against one\u2019s will is inherited from Stoic ethics (De\nbeata vita 11; De moribus 1.5; Wetzel 1992:\n42\u201355). Though the implication that the sage\u2019s virtue\nguarantees his happiness already in this life is later rejected as\nillusory (De trinitate 13.10; De civitate dei 19.4;\nRetractationes 1.2; Wolterstorff 2012), the Christian martyr\ncan be styled in the manner of the Stoic sage whose happiness is\nimmune to torture (Letter 155.16; Tornau 2015: 278).\nAugustine\u2019s Manichean past was constantly on his mind, as his\nincessant polemics shows; its precise impact on his thought is however\ndifficult to assess (van Oort (ed.) 2012; Fuhrer 2013; BeDuhn 2010 and\n2013). The claim of Julian of Aeclanum that with his doctrine of\npredestination and grace Augustine had fallen back into Manichean\ndualism has appealed to some modern critics, but Julian must ignore\nessential features of Augustine\u2019s thought (e.g., the notion of\nevil as privatio boni) to make his claim plausible\n(Lamberigts 2001).\n5. Theory of Knowledge\n5.1 Skepticism and Certainty\n\nAugustine\u2019s earliest surviving work is a dialogue on Academic\nskepticism (Contra Academicos or De Academicis, 386;\nFuhrer 1997). He wrote it at the beginning of his career as a\nChristian philosopher in order to save himself and his readers from\nthe \u201cdespair\u201d that would have resulted if it could not be\nproven that, against the skeptic challenge, truth is attainable and\nknowledge and wisdom possible (cf. Retractationes 1.1.1). The\nsense of despair must have been very real to him when, after having\nbroken with Manicheism but still being unable to see the truth of\nCatholic Christianity, he decided to \u201cwithhold assent until some\ncertainty lighted up\u201d (Confessiones 5.25). His\ninformation about skepticism does not come from a contemporary skeptic\n\u201cschool\u201d, which hardly existed, but from Cicero\u2019s\nAcademica and Hortensius. Much of the discussion in\nContra Academicos is thus devoted to the debate between\nHellenistic Stoics and skeptics about the so-called\n\u201cgrasping\u201d or kataleptic appearance, i.e., the problem\nwhether there are appearances about the truth of which one cannot be\nmistaken because they are evident by themselves (Bermon 2001:\n105\u2013191). Unlike the original Stoics and Academics, Augustine\nlimits the discussion to sense impressions because he wants to present\nPlatonism as a solution to the skeptic problem and to point out a\nsource of true knowledge unavailable to the Hellenistic\nmaterialists.\n\nUnlike modern anti-skeptical lines of argumentation, Augustine\u2019s\nrefutation of skepticism does not aim at justifying our ordinary\npractices and beliefs. To refute the Academic claim that, since the\nwise person can never be sure whether she has grasped the truth, she\nwill consistently withhold assent in order not to succumb to empty\nopinion, he thinks it sufficient to demonstrate the existence of some\nkind of knowledge that is immune to skeptical doubt. His strategy\ntherefore consists in pointing out 1) the certainty of\nself-referential knowledge (the wise person \u201cknows\nwisdom\u201d, Contra Academicos 3.6; the Academic skeptic\n\u201cknows\u201d the Stoic criterion of truth, ib. 3.18\u201321);\n2) the certainty of private or subjective knowledge (I am certain that\nsomething appears white to me even if I am ignorant\nwhether it is really white, ib. 3.26); 3) the certainty of formal,\nlogical or mathematical, structures (ib. 3.24\u201329), knowledge of\nwhich is possible independently of the mental state of the knower,\nwhereas the reliability of sense impressions differs according as we\nare awake or dreaming, sane or insane. Modern critics have not been\nvery impressed by these arguments (e.g., Kirwan 1989: 15\u201334),\nand an ancient skeptic would rightly have objected that being limited\nto subjective or formal knowledge, they could not justify the\ndogmatists\u2019 claim to objective knowledge of reality (cf. Sextus\nEmpiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.13). Yet this is not\nAugustine\u2019s point. To him it matters to have shown that even if\nmaximal concessions are made to skepticism concerning the\nunknowability of the external world attainable by the senses, there\nremains an internal area of cognition that allows for and even\nguarantees certainty. This is why Contra Academicos ends with\na sketch of Platonic epistemology and ontology and with an\nidiosyncratic if not wholly unparalleled reconstruction of the history\nof the Academy according to which the Academics were in fact\ncrypto-Platonists who hid their insight into transcendent reality and\nrestricted themselves to skeptical arguments to combat the materialist\nand sensualist schools dominant in Hellenistic times until authentic\nPlatonism emerged again with Plotinus (Contra Academicos\n3.37\u201343; the story is still told in Letter 118 of 410,\nwhere the renaissance of Platonism is however connected with the rise\nof Christianity). The only realities that meet the Hellenistic\ncriterion of truth and guarantee absolute certainty by being\nself-evident are the Platonic Forms (Contra Academicos 3.39;\ncf. De diversis quaestionibus 9; Cary 2008a: 55\u201360).\nThe \u201cobjects\u201d of knowledge that appear in\nAugustine\u2019s anti-skeptical arguments thus either are the\nPlatonic Forms themselves or at least point out the way of accessing\nthem. This squares with the early Augustine\u2019s tendency to\ninterpret the Forms, or at any rate the most basic among them, as\n\u201cnumbers\u201d, i.e., as the formal and normative structures\nand standards that govern all reality and enable us to understand and\nevaluate it (De ordine 2.14; 16; De musica\n6.57\u201358; O\u2019Daly 1987: 101\u2013102; see also\n 5.2 Illumination).\n Strictly speaking, Augustine\u2019s anti-skeptical arguments do not\njustify the claim that knowledge can be derived from the senses;\nhaving sensible and mutable objects, they cannot but yield opinion or,\nat best, true belief. The later Augustine, in a more generous way of\nspeaking, widens the term \u201cknowledge\u201d (scientia,\nto be distinguished from \u201cwisdom\u201d, sapientia) so\nas to include what we learn through sense perception and from reliable\nwitnesses (De trinitate 15.21; cf. De civitate dei\n8.7; Retractationes 1.14.3; Siebert 2018; see\n 5.3 Faith and Reason).\n\nAugustine\u2019s most famous anti-skeptical argument is what is\ncommonly called his \u201ccogito-like\u201d argument because it is\nsimilar to (and probably inspired) the Cogito of Descartes (Matthews\n1992; Menn 1998; Fuchs 2010). Like Descartes\u2019, Augustine\u2019s\ncogito establishes an area immune to skeptical doubt by inferring from\nmy awareness of my own existence the truth of the proposition \u201cI\nexist\u201d. Even if I were in error in uttering this proposition, it\nwould still be true that I, who am in error, exist (De civitate\ndei 11.26: si enim fallor, sum; for the exact\nreconstruction of this argument cf. Horn 1995: 81\u201387; Matthews\n2005: 34\u201342). The argument does not yet appear in Contra\nAcademicos but is easily recognized as a development of the\nargument from subjective knowledge (Contra Academicos 3.26);\nAugustine considers it a valid refutation of skepticism from his\nearliest (De beata vita 7) to his latest works (De\ntrinitate 15.21; for further attestations see Soliloquia\n2.1; De duabus animabus 13; De libero arbitrio 2.7;\nDe vera religione 73; Confessiones 7.5; 13.12). The\nscope of the argument in Augustine is both wider and narrower than in\nDescartes. The Augustinian cogito lacks the systematic importance of\nits Cartesian counterpart; there is no attempt to found a coherent and\ncomprehensive philosophy on it. On some occasions, however, it works\nas a starting point for the Augustinian ascent to God (De libero\narbitrio 2.7, where the ascent leads to an understanding of God\nas immutable truth and wisdom; for a condensed version, cf. De\nvera religione 72\u201373, where Augustine even makes\nsupra-rational Truth the source and criterion of the truth of the\ncogito itself). The most impressive example is the second half of De\ntrinitate. Here the attempt to reach a rational understanding of\nthe mystery of the Trinity by means of an inquiry into the structure\nof the human mind starts with an analysis of the mind\u2019s\ninalienable self-love and self-awareness (see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God;\n Augustine does not, however, claim that the mind\u2019s certainty\nabout itself entails a similar certainty about the nature of God).\nAugustine\u2019s cogito argument is not limited to epistemology but\ncan also be employed in an ethical context because it proves not only\nmy existence and my thinking (and, by implication, my being alive) but\nalso my loving and willing. I am as certain that I will as I am\ncertain that I exist and live, and my will is as undeniably mine as is\nmy existence and my life. Therefore, my volitions are imputable to me,\nand it is I who am responsible for my choices (and not some evil\nsubstance present in my soul but foreign to my own self, as, on\nAugustine\u2019s interpretation, Manichean dualism would have it; cf.\nDe duabus animabus 13; Confessiones 7.5; De\ncivitate dei 5.10).\n5.2 Illumination\n\nAugustine\u2019s theory of knowledge\u2014his so-called doctrine of\nillumination\u2014is a distinctly non-empiricist epistemology based\non a probably Neoplatonic reading of Plato\u2019s doctrine of\nrecollection (Burnyeat 1987; MacDonald 2012b; King 2014a:\n147\u2013152; Karf\u00edkov\u00e1 2017). Like Plato and his\nfollowers, Augustine thinks that true knowledge requires first-hand\nacquaintance; second-hand information, e.g., from reliable testimony,\nmay yield true and even justifiable belief, but not knowledge in the\nstrict sense.\n In the case of sensible objects\u2014which, strictly speaking, do\nnot admit of knowledge at all but only opinion\u2014such\n first-hand acquaintance is possible through sense perception.\nCognition of intelligible objects, however, can be neither reached\nempirically by means of abstraction nor transmitted to us\nlinguistically by a human teacher (see\n 5.4 Language and Signs);\n rather, such cognition requires personal intellectual activity that\nresults in an intellectual insight, which we judge by a criterion we\nfind nowhere but in ourselves. The paradigm of this kind of cognition\nare mathematical and logical truths and fundamental moral intuitions,\nwhich we understand not because we believe a teacher or a book but\nbecause we see them for ourselves (De magistro 40, cf. De\nlibero arbitrio 2.34). The condition of possibility and the\ncriterion of truth of this intellectual insight is none other than God\n(a view attributed, with explicit approval, to the Platonists in\nDe civitate dei 8.7), who, in the manner of a Neoplatonic\nimmaterial principle, is both immanent and transcendent in relation to\nour soul. Augustine mostly explains this Platonizing theory of a\npriori knowledge by means of two striking images: the inner teacher\nand illumination. The former is introduced in the dialogue De\nmagistro (ca. 390) and remains frequent especially in the sermons\n(e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 3.13;\nFuhrer 2018b); according to it, Christ is present in our souls and by\n\u201cpresiding over\u201d them like a teacher guarantees the\ntruthfulness of our understanding (De magistro 38\u201339,\ncf. Ephesians 3:17 for the image and, for the idea that truth\n\u201clives in the inner man\u201d, De vera religione 72).\nThe latter appears first in the Soliloquia (1.12\u201315)\nand is ubiquitous in Augustine\u2019s writings (cf. esp. De\ntrinitate 12.24). It is ultimately derived from the Analogy of\nthe Sun in Plato\u2019s Republic (508a-509b; cf. Rist 1994:\n78\u201379). In the Soliloquia Augustine says, in a manner\nstrongly reminiscent of Plato, that just as the sun is both visible\nitself and illumines the objects of sight so as to enable the eye to\nsee them, God is intelligible himself and illumines the intelligible\nobjects (which are here identified with the objects of the liberal\ndisciplines and subordinated to God) so as to enable reason (the\n\u201ceye\u201d of the soul) to activate its capacity for\nintellection. The later version in De trinitate explicitly\npresents divine illumination as an alternative to Platonic\nrecollection and situates it in the framework of a theory of creation.\nHere Augustine says that the human mind has been created by God in\nsuch a way as to be \u201cconnected\u201d to intelligible reality\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (subiuncta) and with a capacity\n(capacitas) that enables it to \u201csee\u201d the\nintelligibles in the light of intelligible truth, just as the eye is\nby nature able to see colors in the light of the sun. Obviously,\n\u201ccapacity\u201d in this case does not mean pure potentiality\n(as in the tabula rasa theory endorsed by Augustine\u2019s\ninterlocutor Euodius in De quantitate animae 34) but\ncomprises at least implicit or latent knowledge of moral and\nepistemological standards. Both images, if properly read, should\npreclude the misunderstanding that Augustine\u2019s gnoseology makes\nhuman knowledge entirely dependent on divine agency, with the human\nbeing becoming merely a passive recipient of revelation (cf. Gilson\n1943: ch. 4 and Lagouan\u00e8re 2012: 158\u2013180 for the debates\nabout Augustinian illumination in medieval and modern philosophy).\nCognition does not simply result from the presence of Christ in our\nsoul but from our \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner teacher, i.e.,\nour testing propositions that claim to convey a truth about\nintelligible reality (or even a general truth about sensible objects,\ncf. Letter 13.3\u20134) against the inner standards we\npossess thanks to the presence of Christ (De magistro\n37\u201338; this way of \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner truth is\nrepeatedly dramatized in the Confessiones, e.g., 11.10;\n11.31; Cary 2008b: 100). And while every human being is\n\u201cillumined\u201d by the divine light at least from behind so as\nto be able to pass true judgments about right and wrong or good and\nevil, in order to develop these natural intuitions to full knowledge\nor wisdom and to be able actually to lead a virtuous life, we need to\nconvert to God, the \u201csource\u201d of the light (De\ntrinitate 14.21). Thus, while all human beings are by nature\ncapable of accessing intelligible truth, only those succeed in doing\nso who have a sufficiently good will (De magistro\n38)\u2014presumably those who endorse Christian religion and live\naccordingly. This strong voluntary element intimately connects\nAugustine\u2019s epistemology with his ethics and, ultimately, with\nhis doctrine of grace (on the parallel structure of cognition and grace in Augustine\nsee Lorenz 1964). Like all human agency, striving for wisdom takes place\nunder the conditions of a fallen world and meets the difficulties and\nhindrances humanity is subject to because of original sin.\n\nIn order to illustrate what he means by \u201cseeing things by\nourselves\u201d \u201cin the light of truth\u201d, Augustine often\ncites the example of the Socratic maieutic dialogue (De\nmagistro 40; cf. De immortalitate animae 6; De\ntrinitate 12.24), and in some passages of his early work he seems\nto subscribe to the Platonic doctrine of recollection (familiar to him\nfrom Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 1.57) in such a way as to\nimply the preexistence of the soul (Soliloquia 2.35,\nretracted in Retractationes 1.4.4; De immortalitate\nanimae 6; De quantitate animae 34, retracted in\nRetractationes 1.8.2). It is difficult to tell whether the\nearly Augustine literally believed in recollection and preexistence\n(Karf\u00edkov\u00e1 2017; O\u2019Daly 1987: 70\u201375;\n199\u2013207), not least because he was aware that some Neoplatonists\ninterpreted Platonic recollection as an actualization of our\never-present but latent knowledge of the intelligible rather than as a\nremembrance of our past acquaintance with it (Letter 7.2, cf.\nPlotinus, Enneads IV.3.25.31\u201333; O\u2019Daly 1976).\nIf, as in De immortalitate animae 6, recollection is taken to\nprove the immortality of the soul (as it did in the Phaedo),\nit is hard to see how preexistence should not be implied. In any\nevent, it is imprecise to say, as it is sometimes done, that Augustine\ngave up the theory of recollection because he realized that\npreexistence was at variance with Christian faith. In De civitate\ndei (12.14 etc.) Augustine emphatically rejects\nPlatonic-Pythagorean metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls as\nincompatible with eternal happiness and the economy of salvation, and\nin De trinitate (12.24) the Meno version of the\nrecollection theory, which implies transmigration, is rejected in\nfavor of illumination. Yet it is a fallacy to claim that recollection\nentails transmigration. The early Augustine may have believed in\npreexistence (perhaps simply as a corollary of the immortality of the\nsoul), but there is no evidence that he believed in the transmigration\nof souls; conversely, his rejection of transmigration did not prevent\neven the late Augustine from considering preexistence\u2014at least\ntheoretically\u2014an option for the origin of the soul\n(Letter 143.6 from 412; cf.\n 6.1 Soul as a Created Being).\n5.3 Faith and Reason\n\nWhereas modern discussion tends to regard faith and reason as\nalternative or even mutually exclusive ways to (religious) truth, in\nAugustine\u2019s epistemological and exegetical program the two are\ninseparable. He rejects the rationalism of the philosophers and,\nespecially, the Manicheans as an unwarranted over-confidence into the\nabilities of human reason resulting from sinful pride and as an\narrogant neglect of the revelation of Christ in Scripture (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.56; 60; Confessiones 3.10\u201312).\nAgainst the fideism he encountered in some Christian circles (cf.\nLetter 119 from Consentius to Augustine) he insisted that it\nwas good and natural to employ the rational capacity we have been\ncreated with to search for an understanding of the truths we accept\nfrom the authority of the biblical revelation, even though a true\nunderstanding of God will only be possible after this life when we see\nhim \u201cface to face\u201d (Letter 120.3\u20134). In\nthis epistemological and exegetical program, which since Anselm of\nCanterbury has aptly been labeled as \u201cfaith seeking\nunderstanding\u201d (cf. De trinitate 15.2: fides\nquaerit, intellectus invenit) or \u201cunderstanding of\nfaith\u201d (intellectus fidei), faith is prior to\nunderstanding in time but posterior to it in importance and value\n(De ordine 2.26; De vera religione 45;\nLetter 120.3; van Fleteren 2010). The first step toward\nperfection is to believe the words of Scripture; the second is to\nrealize that the words are outward signs of an internal and\nintelligible reality and that they admonish us to turn to and to\n\u201cconsult\u201d inner truth so as to reach true understanding\nand, accordingly, the good life (cf.\n 5.2 Illumination;\n 5.4 Language and Signs). \nPhilosophical argument may be of help in this process;\nyet as Augustine notes as early as in Contra Academicos\n(3.43), it needs to be tied to the authority of Scripture and the\nCreed to prevent the frailty of human reason from going astray (cf.\nConfessiones 7.13). The Augustine of the earliest dialogues\nseems to have entertained the elitist idea that those educated in the\nliberal arts and capable of the Neoplatonic intellectual ascent may\nactually outgrow authority and achieve a full understanding of the\ndivine already in this life (De ordine 2.26, but contrast ib.\n2.45 on Monnica). In his later work, he abandons this hope and\nemphasizes that during this life, inevitably characterized by sin and\nweakness, every human being remains in need of the guidance of the\nrevealed authority of Christ (Cary 2008b: 109\u2013120). Faith is\nthus not just an epistemological but also an ethical category; it is\nessential for the moral purification we need to undergo before we can\nhope for even a glimpse of true understanding (Soliloquia\n1.12; De diversis quaestionibus 48; De trinitate\n4.24; Rist 2001). To a great extent, Augustine\u2019s defense of\nfaith as a valid epistemic category rests on a rehabilitation of true\nbelief against the philosophical (Platonic and Hellenistic) tradition.\nAugustine neatly distinguishes \u201cbelief\u201d (fides,\nthe word he also uses for religious faith), which entails the\nbeliever\u2019s awareness that he does not know, from\n\u201copinion\u201d (opinio), defined by the philosophers\nas the illusion of knowing what one in fact does not know (De\nutilitate credendi 25; Letter 120.3). Without belief in\nthe former sense, we would have to admit that we are ignorant of our\nown lineage (Confessiones 6.7) and of the objects of the\nhistorical and empirical sciences, of which, as Augustine asserts in a\ncritique of Platonism, first-hand knowledge is rarely possible (De\ntrinitate 4.21). The belief that a person we have not seen was or\nis just may trigger our fraternal love for him (De trinitate\n8.7; Bouton-Touboulic 2012: 182\u2013187; conversely, Augustine asks\nthose who are united with him in fraternal love to believe what he\ntells them about his life, Confessiones 10.3). And obviously,\nthe crucial events of the history of salvation, Jesus\u2019 death on\nthe cross and his resurrection, cannot be known but only believed qua\nhistorical events, even though qua signs they may lead to\nunderstanding by prompting us to an intelligible truth (De\ntrinitate 13.2). Thus, while no doubt faith in revelation\nprecedes rational insight into its true meaning, the decision about\nwhose authority to believe and whom to accept as a reliable witness is\nitself reasonable (De vera religione 45; Letter\n120.3). Even so, belief may of course be deceived (De\ntrinitate 8.6). In ordinary life, this is inevitable and mostly\nunproblematic. A more serious problem is the justification of belief\nin Scripture, which, for Augustine, is the tradition and authority\n(auctoritas, not potestas) of the Church (Contra\nepistulam fundamenti 5.6; Rist 1994: 245).\n5.4 Language and Signs\n\nAugustine\u2019s philosophy of language is both indebted to the\nStoic-influenced Hellenistic and Roman theories of grammar and highly\ninnovative (Rist 1994: 23\u201340; King 2014b). He follows the Stoics\nin distinguishing between the sound of a word, its meaning and the\nthing it signifies (De dialectica 5; De quantitate animae 66; cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus\nmathematicos 8.11\u201312 = 33B Long-Sedley), but he seems to\nhave been the first to interpret language as such as a system of signs\nand to integrate it into a general semiotics (Fuhrer 2018a: 1696; Cary\n2008b; Mayer 1969 and 1974). In his handbook of biblical exegesis and\nChristian rhetoric, De doctrina christiana (1.2;\n2.1\u20134), Augustine divides the world into \u201cthings\u201d\nand \u201csigns\u201d (i.e., things that, apart from being what they\nare, signify other things) and furthermore distinguishes between\n\u201cnatural\u201d or involuntary signs (e.g., smoke signifying\nfire) and voluntary or \u201cgiven\u201d signs (a distinction akin,\nbut not equivalent, to the older discussion about nature or convention\nas the origin of language). Language is defined as a system of given\nsigns by means of which the speaker signifies either things or her\nthoughts and emotions (Enchiridion 22). In the exegetical\nframework of De doctrina christiana, the \u201cthing\u201d\nsignified by the verbal signs of Scripture is God, the Supreme Being.\nAugustine therefore begins with a sketch of his theology and ethics\ncentered around the notions of love of God and neighbor before he sets out his biblical hermeneutics which,\nagain, posits love as the criterion of exegetical adequacy (Pollmann\n1996; Williams 2001). The words of the Bible are external signs\ndesigned to prompt us to the more inward phenomenon of love and,\nultimately, to God who is beyond all language and thought. This may be\ngeneralized to the principle that external\u2014verbal and\nnon-verbal\u2014signs operate on a lower ontological level than the\ninward and intelligible truth they attempt to signify and that they\nare superseded in true knowledge which is knowledge not of signs but\nof things. This holds not only for words, even the words of Scripture,\nbut also for the sacraments and for the Incarnation of Christ\n(Contra epistulam fundamenti 36.41). Augustine\u2019s most\nsustained discussion of language, the early dialogue De\nmagistro, asks how we learn things from words and relates\nlinguistic signification to the epistemology of illumination (Nawar\n2015). After a long discussion of how verbal signs signify things or\nstates of mind and how they relate to other signs, it turns out,\nrather surprisingly, that we do not learn things from signs at all\nbecause in order to understand the meaning of a sign we already have\nto be acquainted with the thing signified. This is ultimately a\nversion of Meno\u2019s paradox, and Augustine solves it by\nintroducing the metaphors of the inner teacher and of illumination,\ni.e., by means of an internalist theory of learning recognizable as a\nNeoplatonic interpretation of Platonic anamnesis (De magistro\n38\u201340).\n This does not mean that words are useless. They inform us about\nthings that are inaccessible to direct acquaintance and thus generate\ntrue belief; most importantly, they admonish us to\n\u201cconsult\u201d the inner teacher and to understand things by\nourselves (this, according to Augustine, is the whole point of the\nSocratic dialogue). This goes even for the acquisition of language\nitself: We understand the sign \u201cbird-catching\u201d, not simply\nby being shown a person engaged in that activity and being told that\nhe is signified by that name, but by observing him and figuring out\nfor ourselves what \u201cbird-catching\u201d means (ib. 32; on this\nand Wittgenstein\u2019s criticism of what he took to be\nAugustine\u2019s view of language acquisition, see Matthews 2005:\n23\u201333). In the later books of De trinitate and in the\nsermons on the Trinity, Augustine frequently refers to a phenomenon\ncalled \u201cinner word\u201d, which he uses to explain the relation\nof the inner-Trinitarian Word or Logos from the Prologue of John (John\n1:1) to Christ incarnate. Just as the spoken word signifies a concept\nthat we have formed within our mind and communicates it to others, so\nChrist incarnate signifies the divine Logos and admonishes and assists\nus to turn to it (cf. De trinitate 15.20; De doctrina\nchristiana 1.12; Sermon 119.7; 187.3). In De\ntrinitate Augustine expands this to a theory about how the inner\nword or concept is formed (14.10; 15.25; cf. 15.43). The inner word is\ngenerated when we actualize some latent or implicit knowledge that is\nstored in our memory. It is not a sign, nor of linguistic nature\n(Augustine insists that it is neither Latin nor Greek nor Hebrew), but\nrather seems to be a kind of a-temporal intellectual insight that\ntranscends language (cf. De catechizandis rudibus 3).\nProperly speaking, then, the theory of the inner word is not a\nlinguistic theory at all.\n6. Anthropology: God and the Soul; Soul and Body\n6.1 Soul as a Created Being\n\nLike most ancient philosophers, Augustine thinks that the human being\nis a compound of body and soul and that, within this compound, the\nsoul\u2014conceived as both the life-giving element and the center of\nconsciousness, perception and thought\u2014is, or ought to be, the\nruling part. The rational soul should control the sensual desires and\npassions; it can become wise if it turns to God, who is at the same\ntime the Supreme Being and the Supreme Good.\n In his Manichean phase, he conceived of both God and the soul as\nmaterial entities, the soul being in fact a portion of God that had\nfallen into the corporeal world where it remained a foreigner, even to\nits own body (De duabus animabus 1; Confessiones\n8.22). After his Platonist readings in Milan had provided him with the\nadequate philosophical means to think about immaterial, non-spatial\nreality (Confessiones 7.1\u20132; 7.16), he replaced this\nview, which he later represents as a rather crude dualism, with an\nontological hierarchy in which the soul, which is mutable in time but\nimmutable in space, occupies a middle position between God, who is\ntotally unchangeable immaterial being (cf. MacDonald 2014), and\nbodies, which are subject to temporal and spatial change\n(Letter 18.2). The soul is of divine origin and even god-like\n(De quantitate animae 2\u20133); it is not divine itself but\ncreated by God (the talk about divinity of the soul in the Cassiciacum\ndialogues seems to be a traditional Ciceronian element, cf. Cary 2000:\n77\u201389; for a Plotinian interpretation see O\u2019Connell 1968:\n112\u2013131). In De quantitate animae, Augustine broadly\nargues that the \u201cgreatness\u201d of the soul does not refer to\nspatial extension but to its vivifying, perceptive, rational and\ncontemplative powers that enable it to move close to God and are\ncompatible with and even presuppose immateriality (esp. ib.\n70\u201376; Brittain 2003). An early definition of soul as \u201ca\nrational substance fitted for rule over a body\u201d (ib. 22) echoes\nPlatonic views (cf. the definition of the human being as \u201ca\nrational soul with a body\u201d in In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 19.15; O\u2019Daly 1987: 54\u201360). Later on, when\nthe resurrection of the body becomes more important to him, Augustine\nemphasizes\u2014against Porphyry\u2019s alleged claim that in order\nto be happy, the soul must free itself from anything\ncorporeal\u2014that it is natural and even desirable for a soul to\ngovern a body (De Genesi ad litteram 12.35.68), but he\nnevertheless remains convinced that soul is an incorporeal and\nimmortal substance that can, in principle, exist independently of a\nbody. In the Soliloquia (2.24), following the tradition of\nPlato and of Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, he\nproposes a proof for the immortality of the soul which he expressly\nintroduces as an alternative to the final proof of the Phaedo\n(Soliloquia 2.23, cf. Phaedo 102d-103c). The proof\nis constructed from elements from Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\nand his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories (rather\nelementary texts that Augustine would have encountered long before his\nPlatonic readings at Milan) and seems to be original with him (Tornau\n2017). It says that since truth is both eternal and in the soul as its\nsubject, it follows that soul, the subject of truth, is eternal too.\nThis is fallacious, because if truth is eternal independently of the\nsoul it cannot be in the soul as in its subject (i.e., as a property),\nand if it is a property of the soul, it cannot ensure its eternity. In\nthe incomplete draft of a third book of the Soliloquia\npreserved under the title De immortalitate animae, Augustine\ntherefore modifies the proof and argues that soul is immortal because\nof the inalienable causal presence of God (= Truth) in it. It turns\nout however that even if this version of the proof is successful, it\nonly demonstrates the soul\u2019s eternal existence as a (rational)\nsoul but not its eternal wisdom (De immortalitate animae 19;\nZum Brunn 1969: 17\u201341 [1988: 9\u201334]), in the hope of which the\ninterlocutors had set out to prove the immortality of the soul in the\nfirst place (Soliloquia 2.1). After De immortalitate\nanimae, Augustine never returned to his proof. But neither did he\ndisown it; as late as De trinitate (13.12), he endorses the\nPlatonic axiom that soul is by nature immortal and that its\nimmortality can, in principle, be proven by philosophical means. He\nalso sticks to his conviction that immortality is a necessary\ncondition of happiness but insists that it is not a sufficient\ncondition, given that immortality and misery are compatible (cf.\nDe civitate dei 9.15 on the misery of the wicked demons).\nTrue happiness will only be realized in the afterlife as a gift of\nGod\u2019s grace, when, thanks to the resurrection of the body, not\njust the soul but the human being as a whole will live forever.\nResurrection, however, is not susceptible of rational proof; it is a\npromise of God that must be believed on Scriptural authority (De\ntrinitate ib.).\n\nTogether with an essentially Platonic notion of the soul, Augustine\ninherits the classical problems of Platonic soul-body dualism. How can\nsoul fulfil its task of \u201cgoverning\u201d the body (cf. De quantitate\nanimae 22) if it is incorporeal itself? And how are\ncorporeal and psychic aspects related to each other in phenomena that\ninvolve both body and soul, especially if, like passions and desires,\nthese are morally relevant? These problems are further complicated by\nthe Platonic axiom that incorporeal entities, being ontologically\nprior to corporeal ones, cannot be causally affected by them.\nAugustine\u2019s solution is indebted to Plotinus\u2019 strategy of\nmaking the relation of the soul to the bodily affections an\nessentially cognitive one (O\u2019Daly 1987, 84\u201387;\nH\u00f6lscher 1986, ch. 2.2.1; Nash 1969, 39\u201359; Bermon 2001:\n239\u2013281). With Plotinus, he insists that sense perception is not\nan affection which the soul passively undergoes (as Stoic materialism\nwould have it, where sensory perception was interpreted as a kind of\nimprint in the soul) but its active awareness of affections undergone\nby the body (De quantitate animae 41; 48; De Genesi ad\nlitteram 7.14.20; Plotinus, Enneads I.4.2.3\u20134;\nBrittain 2002: 274\u2013282). In De quantitate animae, the\nframework of this theory is the general argument that the relation of\nsoul to body must be conceived of not in terms of space but of\n\u201cpower\u201d (see above). In De musica (6.11), this is\ndeveloped into the idea that sense perception is the soul\u2019s\nawareness of modifications of its own formative and vivifying\nactivities that result from its reacting to the external impulses\nundergone by the body. In addition to the usual five senses, Augustine\nidentifies a sensory faculty that relates the data of the senses to\neach other and judges them aesthetically (but not morally; De musica 6.5; 19);\nin De libero arbitrio (2.8\u201313) he calls this the\n\u201cinner sense\u201d (on the Aristotelian background cf.\nO\u2019Daly 1987: 102\u2013105).\n\nIn Neoplatonism it was disputed how soul, being immortal, immaterial\nand ontologically superior to body, came to be incorporated\nnevertheless. The basic options, present already in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, were either that the disembodied soul had\n\u201cfallen\u201d into the corporeal world because of some error\n(as in the Phaedrus myth) or that it had been sent into the\ncosmos by God to impart life and order to it (as in the\nTimaeus; for harmonizing Neoplatonic exegeses, see Plotinus,\nEnneads IV.8, and Macrobius, Commentary on Cicero\u2019s\nSomnium Scipionis 1.10\u201314). Augustine addresses the issue\nin the horizon of his doctrine of creation and, in the period of the\nPelagian Controversy, of the debate about the transmission of original\nsin (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality).\n In De libero arbitrio (3.56\u201359), he distinguishes the\nthree options of creationism (God creates a new soul for every newborn\nbody), traducianism (the soul is transmitted from the parents to the\nchild like corporeal properties), and preexistence, which is\nsubdivided into the Platonic options of voluntary or god-sent descent.\nAfter 412 all these options come to the fore again (Letters\n143.5\u201311; 166; 190; and the treatise De anima et eius\norigine). Augustine discards none of them officially except for\nthe notion, wrongly associated with Origenism, which was considered a\nheresy at the time, that incorporation was a punishment for a sin\ncommitted by the pre-existent soul (De civitate dei 11.23).\nIn practice, he narrows the debate down to the alternative between\ncreationism and traducianism, which appear to have been the only\noptions taken seriously by his Christian contemporaries. Augustine\nrefused to take a stand till the end of his life, probably because\nneither option really suited his purposes (Rist 1994: 317\u2013320;\nO\u2019Connell 1987; Mendelson 1998): Creationism made original sin\nvery difficult to explain; traducianism was functional in this\nrespect, but it was a materialist and even biologist theory that ran\ncounter to Augustine\u2019s Platonism and was further compromised\nbecause it had been brought up by his African predecessor Tertullian\n(d. c. 220 CE), a Stoicizing corporealist who had ended his life as a\nheretic (Rist 1994: 123).\n6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God\n\nAugustine deploys what we may call his philosophy of the mind most\nfully in his great work on Nicene Trinitarian theology, De\ntrinitate. Having removed apparent Scriptural obstacles to the\nequality and consubstantiality of the three divine persons (bks.\n1\u20134) and having set out the grammar, as it were, of adequate\nspeaking about the Trinity by distinguishing absolute and relative\npropositions about God and the three Persons (bks. 5\u20137; King\n2012), he turns to an analysis of the human mind as an image of God\n(bks. 8\u201315; Brachtendorf 2000; Ayres 2010; Bermon &\nO\u2019Daly (eds.) 2012). The basis for this move is, of course,\nGenesis 1:26\u201327. Augustine follows a long-standing Jewish and\nPatristic tradition, familiar to him from Ambrose, according to which\nthe biblical qualification of the human being as an image of God\nreferred not to the living body (a literalist reading vulnerable to\nthe Manichean charge of anthropomorphism, cf. Confessiones\n6.4) but to what is specifically human, i.e., the \u201cinner\nman\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:16, quoted, e.g., in De trinitate\n11.1) or the mind (mens). Assuming, in a Platonist manner,\nthat \u201cimage\u201d in this case does not merely mean an analogy\nbut a causal effect of the original that reflects the essential\nfeatures of the latter on a lower ontological level,\nhe scrutinizes the human mind for triadic structures that meet the\nNicene requirements of equality and consubstantiality and may thus\ngive a\u2014however faint\u2014understanding of the Triune God. The\ngeneral pattern of his argument is the Augustinian ascent from the\nexternal to the internal and from the senses to God; but since human\nreason is, whether by nature or due to its fallen state, hardly\ncapable of knowing God, Augustine this time is obliged to interrupt\nand re-start the ascent several times. The final book shows that the\nexercise of analyzing the human mind does have preparatory value for\nour thinking about the Trinity but does not yield insight into the\ndivine by being simply transferred to it (De trinitate\n15.10\u201311). The three elements Augustine discerns in all our\ncognitive acts from sense perception to theoretical reason or\ncontemplation are: [1] an object that is either external to the mind\n(as in sense perception) or internal to it, in which case it is an\nimage or a concept stored in our memory; [2] a cognitive faculty that\nmust be activated or \u201cformed\u201d by the object if cognition\nis to come about; [3] a voluntary or intentional element that makes\nthe cognitive faculty turn to its object so as to be actually formed\nby it. The last element ensures the active character of perception and\nintellection\n but also gives weight to the idea that we do not cognize an object\nunless we consciously direct our attention to it (MacDonald 2012b).\nThough this triadic pattern is operative on all levels of human\ncognition, Augustine contends that only the mind\u2019s intellectual\nself-knowledge on the level of contemplative reason (its \u201cmemory\nof itself, knowledge of itself and love of itself\u201d) qualifies as\nan image of God because only here are the three elements as closely\nrelated to each other as in the Nicene dogma and because they are as\ninalienable as the mind\u2019s immediate presence to itself (De\ntrinitate 14.19). This idea is carefully prepared in Book 10,\nwhich contains one of Augustine\u2019s most remarkable arguments for\nthe substantiality of the mind and its independence of the body\n(Str\u00f3\u017cy\u0144ski 2013; Brittain 2012a; Matthews 2005:\n43\u201352; Bermon 2001, 357\u2013404). Augustine begins by arguing\n(in a manner reminiscent of his cogito-like argument; see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n that the mind always already knows itself because it is always\npresent to and hence aware of itself. This pre-reflexive\nself-awareness is presupposed by every act of conscious cognition. If\nso, however, the Delphic command \u201cKnow thyself\u201d cannot\nmean that the mind is to become acquainted with itself as if it had\nbeen unknown to itself before, but rather that it must become\nconscious of what it knew about itself all along and distinguish it\nfrom what it does not know about itself. As the mind in its fallen\nstate is deeply immersed in sensible reality, it tends to forget what\nit really is and what it knows it is and confounds itself with the\nthings it attaches the greatest importance to, i.e., sensible objects\nthat give it pleasure. The result are materialist theories about the\nsoul, which thus derive from flawed morality (De trinitate\n10.11\u201312). If it follows the Delphic command, however, the mind\nwill realize that it knows with certainty that it exists, thinks,\nwills etc., whereas it can at best merely believe that it is air, fire\nor brain (ib. 10.13).\n And as the substance or essence of the mind cannot be anything other\nthan what it knows with certainty about itself, it follows that\nnothing material is essential to the mind and that its essence must be\nsought in its mental acts (ib. 10.16). Full self-knowledge is reached,\nthen, when the mind\u2019s inalienable self-awareness (se\nnosse, \u201cto be acquainted with oneself\u201d) is actualized\nto conscious \u201cself-thinking\u201d (se cogitare). How\nthis relates to the mind\u2019s pre-reflexive presence to itself is\nnot entirely clear (for problems of interpretation, see, e.g., Horn\n2012; Brittain 2012b), but Augustine seems to think that not only the\nmind\u2019s intellectual self-thinking but already its immediate\nself-awareness is triadically structured and an image of the Triune\nGod (De trinitate 14.7\u201314). Again, the ethical side of\nthe theory should not be overlooked. As a strong voluntary element is\npresent in and necessary for an act of cognition, what objects\n(imaginations, thoughts) we cognize is morally relevant and indicative\nof our loves and desires. And while the triadic structure of the mind\nis its very essence and hence inalienable, Augustine insists that the\nmind is created in the image of God, not because it is capable of\nself-knowledge, but because it has the potential to become wise, i.e.,\nto remember, know and love God, its creator (ib. 14.21\u201322).\n7. Ethics\n7.1 Happiness\n\nThe basic structure of Augustine\u2019s ethics is that of ancient\neudaimonism (Holte 1962), but he defers happiness to the afterlife and\nblames the ancient ethicists for their arrogant\nconviction\u2014resulting from their ignorance of the fallen\ncondition of humankind\u2014that they could reach happiness in this\nlife by philosophical endeavor (De civitate dei 19.4;\nWolterstorff 2012; for a more optimistic view, cf. the early De\nordine 2.26). He takes it as axiomatic that happiness is the\nultimate goal pursued by all human beings (e.g., De beata\nvita 10; De civitate dei 10.1; De trinitate\n13.7, quoting Cicero\u2019s Hortensius; for an interesting\ndiscussion of how the desire for happiness relates to our equally\nnatural desires for pleasure and for truth cf. Confessiones\n10.29\u201334; Matthews 2005: 134\u2013145; Menn 2014: 80\u201395).\nHappiness or the good life is brought about by the possession of the\ngreatest good in nature that humans can attain and that one cannot\nlose against one\u2019s will (e.g., lib. arb. 1.10\u201312;\nespecially in his early work Augustine shares the Stoics\u2019\nconcern about the self-sufficiency and independence of the wise and\nhappy person, cf. Wetzel 1992, 42\u201355). This structure Augustine\ninscribes into his Neoplatonically inspired three-tiered ontological\nhierarchy (Letter 18.2)\n and concludes that the only thing able to fulfil the requirements for\nthe supreme good set by eudaimonism is the immutable God himself. The\nSupreme Being is also the greatest good; the desire of created being\nfor happiness can only be satisfied by the creator. As Augustine puts\nin concisely in De beata vita (11): \u201cHappy is he who\nhas God\u201d. Alternative formulations are \u201cenjoyment of\nGod\u201d (De civitate dei 8.8; De trinitate\n13.10), \u201ccontemplation of God\u201d or \u201cenjoyment of\ntruth\u201d (De libero arbitrio 2.35). To \u201chave\u201d\nGod means in fact to know and, especially, to love God; Augustine\ntherefore interprets Psalm 72:28 (\u201cFor me it is good to cling to\nGod\u201d) as a biblical telos formula or definition of the\nsupreme and beatifying good (De civitate dei 10.18; Tornau\n2015: 265\u2013266). We are, in other words, happy, wise and virtuous\nif we turn to or \u201cconvert\u201d to God. If we turn away from\nhim and direct our attention and love to the bodies\u2014which are\nnot per se bad, as in Manicheism, but an infinitely lesser good than\nGod\u2014or to ourselves, who are a great good but still subordinate\nto God, we become miserable, foolish and wicked (Letter 18.2;\nDe libero arbitrio 2.52\u201354; In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 20.11). Virtue is \u201clove that knows its\npriorities\u201d (ordo amoris, De civitate dei 15.22)\nwhereas vice or sin perverts the natural order. Just as after the Fall\nall human beings are inevitably tainted by sin, we need to be purified\nthrough faith in order to live well and to restore our ability to know\nand love God (De diversis quaestionibus 68.3; Cary 2008a:\n12\u201313). Augustine does not discard the intellectual element\ninherited from the ancient (Socratic) ethical tradition, and his\nnotion of conversion is certainly inspired by Neoplatonist\n\u201creturn\u201d (epistrophe), but Augustine enhances the\nethical relevance of conversion and aversion by emphasizing their\nvoluntary character (cf. already De immortalitate animae\n11\u201312).\n The element of will or love is also crucial to the distinction between\n\u201cenjoyment\u201d (frui) and \u201cuse\u201d\n(uti) that is first fully developed in De doctrina\nchristiana, bk. 1 (c. 396) and remains basic for his ethical\nthought. Following the ancient insight that we pursue some goods for\ntheir own sake and others for the sake of other and greater goods,\nAugustine states that to \u201cenjoy\u201d a thing means to cling to\nit with love for its own sake whereas to \u201cuse\u201d it means to\nlove it for the sake of another thing which we want to enjoy. We love\nabsolutely only what we enjoy, whereas our love for things we use is\nrelative and even instrumental (De doctrina christiana 1.4).\nThe only proper object of enjoyment is God (cf. De civitate\ndei 8.8 where the same view is attributed to the Platonists).\nWickedness and confusion of the moral order results from a reversal of\nuse and enjoyment, when we want to enjoy what we ought to use (all\ncreated things, e.g., wealth, bodies or ourselves) and to use what we\nought to enjoy (this probably refers to the \u201ccarnal\u201d\nunderstanding of religion of which Augustine often accuses the Jews).\nAn obvious problem of this system is the categorization of the\nbiblically prescribed love of the neighbor. Are we to enjoy our\nneighbor or to use her? Whereas natural moral intuition suggests the\nformer, Augustine\u2019s systematic seems to require the latter. The\nproblem is inherited from ancient eudaimonism, where it takes some\nphilosophical effort to reconcile the intuition that concern for\nothers is morally relevant with the assumption that ethics is\nprimarily about the virtue and happiness of the individual. Augustine\nis aware of the problem and gives a differentiated answer. In De\ndoctrina christiana (1.20\u201321) he somewhat tentatively\nsuggests that to love our neighbor means to use him, not because he is\nmerely instrumental to our happiness but because we are enjoined to\nlove him as ourselves and because we love ourselves rightly only if we\nrefer our self-love to our desire to enjoy God. Love of the neighbor\nthus means to desire his true happiness in the same way as we desire\nour own. In substance, this remains Augustine\u2019s view also in his\nlater work (cf., e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus\ndecem 1.9), but he then prefers to avoid the counter-intuitive\nand potentially misleading talk about \u201cusing\u201d fellow\nhumans and replaces it by a description of fraternal love as\n\u201cmutual enjoyment in God\u201d (e.g., De trinitate\n9.13; cf. already De doctrina christiana 1.35; 3.16; Rist\n1994: 159\u2013168; O\u2019Donovan 1980: 32\u201336;\n112\u2013136). \u201cIn God\u201d is presumably added to prevent\nthe misunderstanding that we are to enjoy the neighbor \u201cin\nherself\u201d or \u201cin ourselves\u201d without reference to God.\nThis would mean that we expect our true happiness from her, which no\nhuman can give; the result of this misdirection would be extreme\nmisery in the case of the neighbor\u2019s loss (cf.\nConfessiones 4.9\u201311 on Augustine\u2019s excessive\ngrief after the death of his friend; Nawar 2014).\n7.2 Virtue\n\nIn principle Augustine follows the view of the ancient eudaimonists\nthat virtue is sufficient or at least relevant for happiness. There\nare however several important modifications. (1) The entire structure\nis made dependent on God\u2019s prevenient grace. True virtue\nguarantees true happiness, but there is no true virtue that is not a\ngift of grace.\n (2) Augustine accepts Cicero\u2019s definition of virtue as the art\nof \u201cliving well\u201d but emphatically rejects his equation of\nliving well and living happily, i.e., the Stoicizing claim that a\nvirtuous disposition is equivalent to happiness (De libero\narbitrio 2.50; De civitate dei 4.21; De moribus\n1.10; contrast Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.53). Our\npostlapsarian life on earth is inevitably the locus of sin and\npunishment, and even the saints are unable to overcome the permanent\ninner conflict between \u201cthe spirit\u201d and \u201cthe\nflesh\u201d, i.e., between good and evil volitions or rational and\nirrational desires in this life (De civitate dei 19.4,\nquoting Galatians 5:17). The perfect inner tranquility virtue strives\nfor will only be achieved in the afterlife. (3) Augustine replaces the\nancient definition of virtue as \u201cright reason\u201d (as in\nStoicism) or \u201cactivity in accordance with reason\u201d (as in\nthe Aristotelian tradition) with a definition of virtue as love of God\nor, in later texts, as love of God and neighbor. Virtue is an inner\ndisposition or motivational habit that enables us to perform every\naction we perform out of right love.\n There are several catalogues of the traditional four cardinal virtues\nprudence, justice, courage and temperance that redefine these as\nvarieties of the love of God either in this life or in the eschaton\n(De moribus 1.25; Letter 155.12; cf. Letter\n155.16 for the cardinal virtues as varieties of love of the neighbor;\nDe libero arbitrio 1.27 for descriptions of the virtues in\nterms of good will). His briefest definition of virtue is\n\u201cordered love\u201d (De civitate dei 15.22). This does\nnot mean that virtue becomes non-rational (for Augustine love and will\nare essential features of the rational mind; see\n 6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God),\n but it does mean that it becomes essentially intentional. The\ncriterion of true virtue is that it is oriented toward God. Even if\nAugustine occasionally talks as if the four cardinal virtues could be\nadded to the Pauline or theological virtues of love, faith and hope to\nmake a sum of seven (Letter 171A.2), they are best taken as a\nsubdivision of love, the only one of the Pauline virtues that persists\nin the eschaton (Soliloquia 1.14).\n\nThese modifications have several interesting consequences. Even though\nAugustine postpones the happiness that is the reward of virtue to the\nafterlife, he does not make virtue a means to an end in the sense that\nvirtue becomes superfluous when happiness is reached. To the contrary,\nhe insists that virtue will persist in the eschaton where it will be\ntransformed into eternal unimpeded fruition of God and of the neighbor\nin God. Then it will indeed be its own reward and identical with\nhappiness (Letter 155.2; 12). Both eschatological virtue and\nvirtue in this life are thus love of God; they only differ in that the\nlatter is subject to hindrances and temptation. For this reason, those\nwho have true love of God\u2014e.g., Christian martyrs\u2014are\nhappy already in this life, at least in hope (e.g.,\nConfessiones 10.29; Tornau 2015). Augustine\u2019s\ndescription of eschatological and non-eschatological virtues\n(Letter 155) is partly modelled on the Neoplatonic doctrine\nof the scale of virtues with its ascending hierarchy of social or\ncivic, purificatory and contemplative virtues (Tornau 2013; Dodaro\n2004a: 206\u2013212; Dodaro 2004b). When analyzing virtue in this\nlife, Augustine takes up the Stoic distinction, familiar to him from\nCicero (De officiis 1.7\u20138), between a virtue\u2019s\nfinal end (finis) and its appropriate action\n(officium; cf., e.g., Contra Iulianum 4.21; De\ncivitate dei 10.18). The appropriate action that characterizes\nvirtue in this life but is no longer needed in eternal bliss is to\nsubdue the lower parts of soul to reason and to resist the temptations\nthat emerge from the permanent conflict between good and bad volitions\n(as it were, a permanent \u201cakratic\u201d state; see\n 7.4 Will and Freedom)\n that results from our fallen condition (De civitate dei\n19.4). As the examples of the best philosophers and the heroes of\nRome\u2019s glorious past teach, whom Augustine regularly accuses of\nlove of glory, these actions may easily spring from other motivations\nthan the true love of God. Augustine therefore distinguishes between\ntrue (i.e., Christian) virtue that is motivated by love of God and\n\u201cvirtue as such\u201d (virtus ipsa: De civitate dei\n5.19) that performs the same appropriate actions but is, in the last\nresort, guided by self-love or pride (ib. 5.12; 19.25). Among other\nthings, this distinction underpins his solution of the so-called\nproblem of pagan virtue (Harding 2008; Tornau 2006b; Dodaro 2004a: 27\u201371; Rist 1994:\n168\u2013173) because it permits ascribing virtue in a meaningful\nsense to pagan and pre-Christian paradigms of virtue like Socrates\nwithout having to admit that they were eligible for salvation. If a\n\u201cteleological\u201d perspective on virtue is adopted that\nexclusively focuses on ends, the virtues of the pagan must be judged\nvices rather than virtues and will be punished accordingly (De\ncivitate dei 19.25, the passage from which the non-Augustinian\nphrase that pagan virtues are \u201csplendid vices\u201d seems to be\nderived; see Irwin 1999). An \u201coperative\u201d perspective\nhowever reveals that as far as appropriate actions are concerned,\nvirtuous non-Christians differ from the foolish and wicked but are\nindistinguishable from virtuous Christians. From this point of view,\nSocrates is closer to Paul than to Nero, even though his virtue will\nnot bring him happiness, i.e., eternal bliss. That he envisages a\nperspective on virtue that abstracts from the causal nexus of virtue\nand happiness is perhaps Augustine\u2019s most significant departure\nfrom ancient eudaimonism.\n7.3 Love\n\nLove is a crucial and overarching notion in Augustine\u2019s ethics.\nIt is closely related to virtue\n and often used synonymously with will (e.g., De trinitate\n15.38; in the cogito-like arguments, love and will are\ninterchangeable, cf. De civitate dei 11.27 with\nConfessiones 13.12) or intention (intentio).\nAugustine\u2019s basic text is, of course, the biblical command to\nlove God and neighbor (Matthew 22.37; 39), which he is however\nprepared, throughout his life, to interpret in terms of Platonic\nerotic love (Rist 1994: 148\u2013202). As in the Symposium\nand in Plotinus (Enneads I.6), love is a force in our souls\nthat attracts us to the true beauty we find nowhere else but in and\nabove ourselves; it drives us to ascend from the sensible to the\nintelligible world and to the cognition and contemplation of God\n(Confessiones 10.8\u201338, esp. 38). Even Christian\nfraternal love can be described, in a manner reminiscent of the\nPhaedrus, as a kind of seduction through another\u2019s real\nor assumed righteousness (De trinitate 9.11). In a more\ngeneral way, love means the overall direction of our will (positively)\ntoward God or (negatively) toward ourselves or corporeal creature\n(De civitate dei 14.7; Byers 2013: 88\u201399;\n217\u2013231). The former is called love in a good sense\n(caritas), the latter cupidity or concupiscence\n(cupiditas), i.e., misdirected and sinful love (De\ndoctrina christiana 3.16). The root of sin is excessive self-love\nthat wants to put the self in the position of God and is equivalent\nwith pride (De civitate dei 14.28). It must be distinguished\nfrom the legitimate self-love that is part of the biblical commandment\nand strives for true happiness by subordinating the self to God\n(O\u2019Donovan 1980). In his earlier work, Augustine has some\ndifficulties incorporating love of neighbor into the Platonic and\neudaimonist framework of his thinking (De doctrina christiana\n1.20\u201321, see\n 7.1 Happiness).\n After 400, in the context of his reflections on the Trinity and his\nexegesis of the First Epistle of John (esp. 1 John 4:8; 16, \u201cGod\nis love\u201d), he finds the solution that love is by its very nature\nself-reflexive. In loving our neighbors, we of necessity love that\nlove which enables us to do so itself, which is none other than God;\nlove of God and love of neighbor are, accordingly, co-extensive and,\nultimately, identical (De trinitate 8.12; In epistulam\nIohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 9.10). Right and perverse\nlove or intention\u2014charity or concupiscence\u2014thus becomes\nthe predominant and even the single criterion of moral evaluation;\nAugustine\u2019s ethics may in this sense be labeled intentionalist\n(cf. Mann 1999 on Augustine\u2019s \u201cinner-life ethics\u201d).\nHe keenly insists that each and every action, even if it is externally\ngood and impressive, can be motivated either by a good or an evil\nintention, by right or perverse love, by charity or pride. This goes\nfor the actions prescribed by the Sermon of the Mount and even for\nmartyrdom (In epistulam Iohannis tractatus decem 8.9, partly\nrelying on 1 Corinthians 13:3). It is therefore impossible to give\ncasuistic rules for external moral behavior. The only thing possible\nis the general recommendation to \u201cLove and do what you\nwill\u201d (ib. 7.8), i.e., to take care that the inner disposition\nor intention behind one\u2019s actions is love of God and neighbor\nand not self-love or pride. It is important not to misunderstand this\nas moral subjectivism, which Augustine\u2019s ontological and ethical\nassumptions exclude. He never excuses evil deeds done \u201cwith the\nbest intentions\u201d or with a subjectively pure conscience, and he\ndoes allow for actions that are always condemnable because they cannot\npossibly result from love, such as heresy. In a sense, his ideal agent\nis a successor of the Stoic and Neoplatonic sage, who always acts out\nof inner virtue or perfect rationality (the latter Augustine replaces\nwith true love) but adapts his outward actions to the external\ncircumstances (cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos\n11.200\u2013201 = 59 G Long-Sedley; Diogenes Laertius 7.121;\nPorphyry, Sententiae 32). Augustine\u2019s intentionalism\nhas, however, the ambivalent implication that, since love and will\ninevitably belong to the privacy of the mind, the inner motives for a\nperson\u2019s external agency are unknowable to anyone except the\nagent herself and God. On the one hand, this limits the authority of\nother people\u2014including those endowed with worldly power or an\necclesiastical office\u2014to pass moral judgments. Augustine\nrepeatedly recommends withholding judgment so as to preserve humility\n(De civitate dei 1.26; Sermon 30.3\u20134). On the\nother hand, Augustine makes our inner motivational and moral life\nopaque even to ourselves and fully transparent only to God\n(Confessiones 10.7; In Iohannis evangelium tractatus\n32.5). We can never be fully sure about the purity of our intentions,\nand even if we were, we could not be sure that we will persist in\nthem. All human beings are therefore called to constantly scrutinize\nthe moral status of their inner selves in a prayerful dialogue with\nGod (as it is dramatized in the Confessiones). Such\nself-scrutiny may well be self-tormenting; the obsession of Western\nChristianity with inner latent guilt here has its Augustinian roots.\nThe public staging of Augustine\u2019s confession before God in the\nConfessiones may, among many other things, represent an\nattempt to remedy the loneliness of Christian self-scrutiny (cf.\nConfessiones 10.1\u20137).\n\nAugustine\u2019s intentionalism also provides him with arguments in\nfavor of religious coercion. As the objective of right fraternal love\nis not the neighbor\u2019s temporal well-being but his eternal\nhappiness or salvation, we must not passively tolerate our\nfellow-humans\u2019 sins but should actively correct them if we can;\notherwise, our motivation would be inertia rather than love (In\nepistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 7.11; cf.\nLetter 151.11; Ad Simplicianum 1.2.18). Catholic\nbishops are therefore obliged to compel heretics and schismatics to\nre-enter the Catholic church even forcibly, just as a father beats his\nchildren when he sees them playing with snakes or as we bind a madman\nwho otherwise would fling himself down a precipice (Letter\n93.8; 185.7; and Letter 93.1\u201310 in general). Obviously,\nthis is a paternalistic argument that presupposes superior insight in\nthose who legitimately wield coercive power. While this may be\nacceptable in the case of the Church, which according to\nAugustine\u2019s ecclesiology is the body of Christ and the\nembodiment of fraternal love, it turns out to be problematic when it\nis transferred to secular rulers (Augustine rarely does this, but cf.\nLetter 138.14\u201315). And as even the Church in this world\nis a mixed body of sinners and saints (see\n ",
