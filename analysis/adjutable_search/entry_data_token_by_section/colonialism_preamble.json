    "main_text": "\n\nColonialism is a practice of domination, which involves the\nsubjugation of one people to another. At least since the Crusades and\nthe conquest of the Americas, political theorists have used theories\nof justice, contract, and natural law to both criticize and justify\nEuropean domination. In the nineteenth century, the contradiction\nbetween liberal ideals and colonial practice became particularly\nacute, as the dominion of Europe over the rest of the world reached\nits zenith. This entry begins with a definition of colonialism, and\nthe second section explains how European thinkers justified,\nlegitimized, and challenged the conquest of the Americas. The third\nsection focuses on liberalism and the fourth section briefly discusses\nthe Marxist tradition, including Marx\u2019s own defense of British\ncolonialism in India and Lenin\u2019s anti-imperialist writings. The\nfifth section provides an introduction to contemporary\n\u201cpost-colonial theory.\u201d This approach has been\nparticularly influential in literary studies because it draws\nattention to the diverse ways that postcolonial subjectivities are\nconstituted and resisted through discursive practices. The final\nsection will introduce Indigenous critiques of settler-colonialism\nthat emerge as a response to colonial practices of domination and\ndispossession of land, customs and traditional history and to\npost-colonial theories of universalism. The goal of the entry is to\nprovide an overview of the philosophical response to the experience of\nEuropean colonization.\n",
