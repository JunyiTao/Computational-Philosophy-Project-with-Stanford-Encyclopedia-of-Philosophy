    "main_text": "Socialist Critiques of Capitalism and their Grounds (Dimension DI) || Socialist Principles\n3.1 Socialist Principles\n\nSocialists have deployed ideals and principles of equality, democracy,\nindividual freedom, self-realization, and community or solidarity.\nRegarding equality, they have proposed strong versions of the\nprinciple of equality of opportunity according to which everyone\nshould have \u201cbroadly equal access to the necessary material and\nsocial means to live flourishing lives\u201d (Wright 2010: 12; Roemer\n1994a: 11\u20134; Nielsen 1985). Some, but by no means all,\nsocialists construe equality of opportunity in a luck-egalitarian way,\nas requiring the neutralization of inequalities of access to advantage\nthat result from people\u2019s circumstances rather than their\nchoices (G.A. Cohen 2009: 17\u20139). Socialists also embrace the\nideal of democracy, requiring that people have \u201cbroadly\nequal access to the necessary means to participate meaningfully in\ndecisions\u201d affecting their lives (Wright 2010: 12; Arnold n.d.\n [OIR]:\n sect. 4). Many socialists say that democratic participation should be\navailable not only at the level of governmental institutions, but also\nin various economic arenas (such as within the firm). Third,\nsocialists are committed to the importance of individual\nfreedom. This commitment includes versions of the standard ideas\nof negative liberty and non-domination (requiring security from\ninappropriate interference by others). But it also typically includes\na more demanding, positive form of self-determination, as the\n\u201creal freedom\u201d of being able to develop one\u2019s own\nprojects and bring them to fruition (Elster 1985: 205; Gould 1988: ch.\n1; Van Parijs 1995: ch. 1; Castoriadis 1979). An ideal of self-realization\nthrough autonomously chosen activities featuring people\u2019s\ndevelopment and exercise of their creative and productive capacities\nin cooperation with others sometimes informs socialists\u2019\npositive views of freedom and equality\u2014as in the view that there\nshould be a requirement of access to the conditions of\nself-realization at work (Elster 1986: ch. 3). Finally, and relatedly,\nsocialists often affirm an idea of community or\nsolidarity, according to which people should organize their\neconomic life so that they treat the freedom and well-being of others\nas intrinsically significant. People should recognize positive duties\nto support other people, or, as Einstein (1949) put it, a \u201csense\nof responsibility for [their] fellow men\u201d. Or, as Cohen put it,\npeople should \u201ccare about, and, where necessary and possible,\ncare for, one another, and, too, care that they care about one\nanother\u201d (G.A. Cohen 2009: 34\u20135). Community is sometimes\npresented as a moral ideal which is not itself a demand of justice but\ncan be used to temper problematic results permitted by some demands of\njustice (such as the inequalities of outcome permitted by a\nluck-egalitarian principle of equality of opportunity (G.A. Cohen\n2009)). However, community is sometimes presented within socialist\nviews as a demand of justice itself (Gilabert 2012). Some socialists\nalso take solidarity as partly shaping a desirable form of\n\u201csocial freedom\u201d in which people are able not only to\nadvance their own good but also to act with and for others (Honneth\n2015 [2017: ch. I]).\n\nGiven the diversity of fundamental principles to which socialists\ncommonly appeal, it is perhaps unsurprising that few attempts have\nbeen made to link these principles under a unified framework. A\nsuggested strategy has been to articulate some aspects of them as\nrequirements flowing from what we might call the Abilities / Needs\nPrinciple, following Marx\u2019s famous dictum, in The\nCritique of the Gotha Program, that a communist society should be\norganized so as to realize the goals of producing and distributing\n\u201cFrom each according to [their] abilities, to each according to\n[their] needs\u201d. This principle, presented with brevity and in\nthe absence of much elaboration by Marx (Marx 1875 [1978b: 531]) has\nbeen interpreted in different ways. One, descriptive interpretation\nsimply takes it to be a prediction of how people will feel motivated\nto act in a socialist society. Another, straightforwardly normative\ninterpretation construes the Marxian dictum as stating duties to\ncontribute to, and claims to benefit from, the social\nproduct\u2014addressing the allocation of both the burdens and\nbenefits of social cooperation. Its fulfillment would, in an\negalitarian and solidaristic fashion, empower people to live\nflourishing lives (Carens 2003, Gilabert 2015). The normative\nprinciple itself has also been interpreted as an articulation of the\nbroader, and more basic, idea of human dignity. Aiming at\nsolidaristic empowerment, this idea could be understood as\nrequiring that we support people in the pursuit of a flourishing life\nby not blocking, and by enabling, the development and exercise of\ntheir valuable capacities, which are at the basis of their moral\nstatus as agents with dignity (Gilabert 2017b).\n",
