    "main_text": "The Second Sex: Woman As Other\n7. The Second Sex: Woman As Other\n\nWhile writing America Day by Day, Beauvoir was beginning to\nwork out her ideas for what would become her most famous book, The\nSecond Sex. In her autobiography Force of Circumstance,\nBeauvoir looks back at The Ethics of Ambiguity and criticizes\nit for being too abstract. She does not repudiate the arguments of her\ntext, but finds that it erred in trying to define morality independent\nof a social context. The Second Sex may be read as correcting\nthis error, reworking and materially situating the analyses of The\nEthics of Ambiguity. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nconjured up images of ethical and unethical figures to make its\narguments tangible, the analyses of The Second Sex are\nmaterialized in Beauvoir\u2019s experiences as a woman and in\nwomen\u2019s lived realities. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nspeaks of mystification in a general sense, The Second Sex\nspeaks of the specific ways that the natural and social sciences and\nthe European literary, social, moral, political and religious\ntraditions have created a world where impossible and conflicting\nideals of femininity produce an ideology of women\u2019s\n\u201cnatural\u201d inferiority to justify patriarchal\ndomination.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s self-criticism suggests that her later works mark a\nbreak with her earlier writings. We should, however, resist the\ntemptation to take this notion of discontinuity too far. Rather than\nthinking in terms of breaks it is more fruitful to see The Second\nSex in terms of a more radical commitment to the phenomenological\ninsight that it is as embodied beings that we engage the world. Our\naccess to, awareness of, and possibilities for world engagement cannot\nbe considered absent a consideration of the body as it is lived in a\nconcrete situation.\n\nIt was in 1946, while at the Deux Magots cafe in Paris, that Beauvoir\nfirst came up with the idea for The Second Sex. Inspired by\nL\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019homme (1939) written by Michel\nLeiris, Beauvoir comes up with the question: \u201cWhat has it meant\nto me to be a woman?\u201d Beauvoir\u2019s immediate reflection\ndisregarded the significance of being a woman, but she soon realized\nthe world around her had always been a masculine one. Beauvoir then\npursued the question through an interdisciplinary study of the myths\nof femininity, while taking herself, her situation as a woman, and the\nsituation and embodiment of being a woman more generally as the\nsubjects of her philosophical reflections. It is Beauvoir\u2019s\ninitial interest in the myths of femininity and their role in\nwomen\u2019s lives that led her to develop the claim central to the\nbook: woman is the Other, man is the essential being.\n\nThe Second Sex is a deliberate feminist phenomenological\ninvestigation of the sexed/gendered body, and it is considered a\nfounding text in the field of feminist phenomenology. Beauvoir draws\nexplicitly on narrative accounts of women\u2019s lived experience and\nfocuses on the entanglement of the general and the particular, rather\nthan bracketing the contingent to arrive at pure experience. In doing\nso, she exposes how masculinist ideology exploits sexual difference to\ncreate a system of oppression that positions and traps women in the\nrole of the Other. Such entrapment is part of history and mythology\n(which she explores in Volume I) and lived experience (described in\nVolume II). Central to Volume I is her discussion of the myth of the\neternal feminine, a master myth that works to ensnare women in an\nunattainable ideal in order to undermine their existence as\nindividuals. For Beauvoir, the myth of the eternal feminine is\nsocially powerful and generative of \u201cfeminine existence\u201d.\nIt is through the sociohistorical creation and legacy of this myth and\nthrough lived experience that women become anchored to the realm of\nimmanence and are forced to relinquish their claim to transcendence.\nIn doing so, women become split subjects, namely those who have the\ncapacity for world-making activity but are pushed into the repetitive,\npassive, closed realm of existence.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s liberatory response to women\u2019s oppression is a\nfeminism of freedom. The Second Sex argues against the\neither/or frame of the woman question (either women and men are equal\nor they are different). It argues for women\u2019s equality, while\ninsisting on the reality of sexual difference. Beauvoir finds it\nunjust and immoral to use sexual difference as an argument for\nwomen\u2019s subordination. She insists that women and men must both\nhave the capacity to assume their existence as immanence and\ntranscendence, and therefore must treat each other as equal. Yet, such\ntreatment requires that their sexual differences be validated. She\nfinds it un-phenomenological, however, to ignore it. As a\nphenomenologist she is obliged to examine women\u2019s unique\nexperiences of their bodies and to determine how these experiences are\nco-determined by what phenomenology calls the everyday attitude (the\ncommon-sense assumptions that we unreflectively bring to our\nexperience). For Beauvoir, since the body is a situation, it is not\nmerely that a subject has a body. Rather, the body is lived and so it\nis experientially constituted, such that for Beauvoir, what it means\nto become a woman is to live or experience one\u2019s body in a\nparticular way.\n\nAs a phenomenologist, this experiential account of embodiment does not\ncommit her to a biological account of \u2018woman\u2019. Beauvoir\nexplores cultural and historical assumptions that frame women\u2019s\nexperience of their bodies and that alienate them from their\npossibilities. She draws attention to the experiential basis of facts,\nincluding biological, psychological, historical, and economic ones,\nand considers how they obscure the contingent articulation of\n\u2018woman\u2019 or account for women\u2019s experience as an\nessence. For example, it is assumed that women are weaker. What, she\ndirects us to ask, is the ground of this assumption? What criteria of\nstrength are used? Upper body power? Average body size? Is there a\nreason not to consider longevity a sign of strength? Using this\ncriterion, would women still be considered the weaker sex? A bit of\nreflection exposes the biases of the criteria used to support the\nsupposedly obvious \u201cfact\u201d of women\u2019s weakness and\ntransforms it from an unassailable reality to an unreliable\nassumption. Once we begin this questioning, it is not long before\nother so-called facts fall to the side of \u201ccommon sense\u201d\nin the phenomenological sense.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most famous line of The Second Sex,\n\u201cOn ne na\u00eet pas femme: on le devient\u201d (SS:1949, 13),\ntranslated in 1953 as \u201cOne is not born but becomes a\nwoman\u201d (SS:1953, 267) and in 2010 as \u201cOne is not born but\nbecomes woman\u201d (SS: 2010, 283), is credited by many as alerting\nus to the sex-gender distinction. Whether or not Beauvoir understood\nherself to be inaugurating this distinction, whether or not she\nfollowed this distinction to its logical/radical conclusions, or\nwhether or not radical conclusions are justified are matters of\nfeminist debate. What is not a matter of dispute is that The\nSecond Sex gives us the vocabulary for analyzing how societal\nnotions of femininity are lived and a method for critiquing them. In\nthis sense, Beauvoir offers a critical phenomenological analysis of\nthe socially constituted meanings of \u2018woman\u2019 and how one\ncomes to assume and negotiate those meanings experientially. For\nBeauvoir, one becomes a woman not just because others say so, but\nbecause she actively assumes her bodily existence in such a way.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s account of becoming is crucial to understanding how\nhuman beings called women come into existence. Beauvoir\u2019s target\nhere is essentialist arguments that view \u2018woman\u2019 as a\nbiological fact. Beauvoir believes it to be faulty to accept the\ncommon sense idea that to be born with certain genitalia or\nreproductive capacities is to be born a woman. In rejecting this\nposition, asserted in the most famous line of The Second Sex,\nshe pursues the first rule of phenomenology: identify your\nassumptions, treat them as prejudices and put them aside; do not bring\nthem back into play until and unless they have been validated by\nexperience. Accordingly, she offers a descriptive account of how some\nhuman beings become women as a matter of living an imposed social\ndestiny rooted in and generated by particular historical, economic,\nand political conditions, as well as social and moral conventions. On\nthis view, \u2018woman\u2019 is an invention, but also a lived,\nembodied reality. For Beauvoir, the social destiny those who become\nwomen are expected and often coerced to assume is bound up with\nheterosexism such that to become a woman is to be made and to make\noneself an object for men. The detriment of such self-making, Beauvoir\nshows, is that a woman comes to live an existence relative to men. In\ndoing so, a woman becomes the Other. Women, however, are usually\naccomplice to this self-making, as being made the Other, although a\ncondition of oppression, also bestows recognition and\nself-justification in a patriarchal milieu.\n\nA brief but packed sentence that appears early in the The Second\nSex alerts us to the ways that Beauvoir used existential and\nMarxist categories to analyze the unique complexities of women\u2019s\nsituation as the Other. It reads,\n\n\nHence woman makes no claim for herself as subject because she lacks\nthe concrete means, because she senses the necessary link connecting\nher to man without positing its reciprocity, and because she often\nderives satisfaction from her role as the Other. (SS: 2010, 10, cf.\nSS: 1949, 24)\n\n\nWho becomes a woman in the way Beauvoir describes is an important\nquestion. Scholars have noted the impact of Richard Wright\u2019s\nintellectual influence on Beauvoir\u2019s account of women\u2019s\nsituation and oppression, and Beauvoir herself makes direct reference\nto Wright in The Second Sex, yet her treatment of race in the\nbook is vexed. Scholars have pointed out that her treatment of\nwomen\u2019s situation focuses explicitly on becoming a woman, thus\nprivileging an analysis of patriarchal oppression as the most\nsignificant form of oppression, and have noted that she generalizes\nfrom a white, bourgeois perspective. At the same time, as other\nscholars have noted, at the beginning of The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir argues that the patriarchal subjection of women is distinct\nin kind from racial subjection. While discrete historical events have\nbeen generative of other forms of oppression, she describes the\nsubjection of women as feature of human existence across time and\nplace and so not identifiable by a discrete historical event. So, for\nBeauvoir, it is not that women\u2019s subjection is the only form of\noppression or that it is more significant than other forms of\nsubjection. Rather, the formation, structure and effects of the\nsubjection of women is distinct and therefore, on her account,\nrequires a focused investigation. \n\nTo account for what it means to become a woman, Beauvoir introduces\nthe concept of the Other early in the text and it drives her entire\nanalysis. She uses it again in her last major work, The Coming of\nAge (1970), to structure her critique of the ways that the\nelderly are othered by society. In The Second Sex,\nBeauvoir\u2019s notion of the Other is based on the Hegelian\nmaster-slave dialectic. Unlike Hegel who universalized this dialectic,\nBeauvoir distinguishes the dialectic of exploitation between\nhistorically constituted Subjects and Others from the exploitation\nthat ensues when the Subject is Man, a sovereign existence, and the\nOther is Woman, a relative existence. In the first case, the Other\nexperiences their oppression as a communal reality. They see\nthemselves as part of an oppressed group. Here, oppressed Others may\ncall on the resources of a common history and a shared abusive\nsituation to assert their subjectivity and demand recognition and\nreciprocity. The situation of women is comparable to the condition of\nthe Hegelian Other in that men, like the Hegelian Master, identify\nthemselves as the Subject, the absolute human type, and, measuring\nwomen by this standard of the human, identify them as inferior.\nWomen\u2019s so-called inadequacies are then used as justification\nfor seeing them as the Other and for treating them accordingly. Unlike\nthe Hegelian Other, however, women are unable to identify the origin\nof their otherness. They cannot call on the bond of a shared history\nto reestablish their lost status as Subjects. Further, dispersed among\nthe world of men, women identify themselves in terms of the\ndifferences of their oppressors (e.g., as white or black women, as\nworking-class or middle-class women, as Muslim, Christian, Jewish,\nBuddhist or Hindu women) rather than with each other. According to\nBeauvoir, they lack the solidarity and resources of the Hegelian Other\nfor organizing themselves into a \u201cwe\u201d that demands\nrecognition. Unlike the Other of the master-slave dialectic, women are\nnot positioned to rebel. Beauvoir uses the category of the Inessential\nOther to designate the unique situation of women as the ambiguous\nOther of men. As Inessential Others, women\u2019s routes to\nsubjectivity and recognition cannot follow the Hegelian script.\n\nFor Beauvoir, women\u2019s conflict with men is ambiguous. She calls\nthe relation between men and women a \u201cprimordial\nMitsein\u201d (SS:2010, 9, cf. 1949, 22) in order to make a\nclaim about their original togetherness in the world. For Beauvoir,\nthis relationship between women and men draws attention to the\ninterdependence between the Subject and his Other and is the unique\ntie that binds women to their oppressors. As such, it is generative of\nwomen\u2019s inability to identify a common history. This assertion\nthat women live a necessary bond with men regardless of a lack of\nreciprocity draws on the notion of appeal developed in The Ethics\nof Ambiguity: in making an appeal to others to join me in my\npursuit of justice I validate myself and my values. Given that my\nappeal must be an appeal to the other in their freedom, I must allow\nfor the reality that the other may reject it. When this happens, I\nmust (assuming that the rejection is not a threat to the ground value\nof freedom) recognize the other\u2019s freedom and affirm the bond of\nhumanity that ties us to each other. In the case of women, Beauvoir\nnotes, this aspect of the appeal (the affirmation of the bond between\nus) dominates. She does not approve of the way that women allow the\naffirmation of the bond to eclipse the requirement that they be\nrecognized as free subjects. But, she does alert us to the fact that\nrecognition in itself is not the full story of the ethical\nrelationship. To demand recognition without regard for the bond is\nunethical; it is the position of the Subject as master. What is\nneeded, Beauvoir argues, is a reconstitution of the bond that enables\nwomen to accomplish themselves.\n\nSuch change does not concern women\u2019s happiness. Happiness may be\nchosen or accepted in exchange for the deprivations of freedom.\nRecalling the argument of The Ethics of Ambiguity we know\nwhy. As Others, women are returned to the metaphysically privileged\nworld of the child. They experience the happiness brought about by bad\nfaith\u2014a happiness of not being responsible for themselves, of\nnot having to make consequential choices. From this existential\nperspective women may be said to be complicit in their subjugation.\nBut this is not the whole story. If women are happy as the Other, it\nmay be because, given the material and ideological realities of their\nsituation, this is the only avenue of happiness open to them.\nBeauvoir\u2019s existential charge of bad faith must be understood\nwithin her Marxist analysis of the social, economic and cultural\nstructures that frame women\u2019s lives. Though Beauvoir does not\nargue that these structures deprive women of their freedom, neither\ndoes she ignore the situations that make the exercise of that freedom\nextremely difficult.\n\nFor Beauvoir, the work of liberation will not be easy. It is work that\nwill cause conflict because it requires refusing and ultimately\nsacrificing norms and customs of femininity and masculinity, the very\nones that are, for many, sources of happiness and self-justification.\nLiberation is also not a matter of appealing to men to give women\nfreedom; it is a matter of women discovering their solidarity,\nrejecting the bad faith temptations of happiness and discovering the\npleasures of freedom. While Beauvoir alerts us to the tensions and\nconflicts that this will create between men and women, she does not\nenvision a permanent state of hostility. Here her Hegelian-Marxist\noptimism prevails. Men will (ultimately) recognize women as free\nsubjects, but only when both commit to sacrificing patriarchal\nmyths.\n\nSpeaking in reference to sexual difference, Beauvoir notes that\ndismantling patriarchal mythology is not a recipe for androgynous\nsubjects. Given the realities of embodiment, there will be sexual\ndifferences. Unlike today, however, these differences will appear\ndifferently. They will not be used to justify the difference between a\nSubject and his Inessential Other. Ultimately, according to her, the\ngoal of liberation is our mutual recognition of each other as free and\nas other.\n\nDespite the heterosexist structure of the myth of the eternal\nfeminine, Beauvoir describes one situation in which mutual recognition\nsometimes exists: the intimate heterosexual erotic encounter. Speaking\nof this intimacy, she writes, \u201cthe dimension of the other\nremains; but the fact is that alterity no longer has a hostile\ncharacter\u201d (SS: 2010, 415, cf. 1949, 189). Why? Because\nauthentic lovers experience themselves and each other ambiguously,\nthat is, as both subjects and objects of erotic desire rather than as\ndelineated according to institutionalized positions of man and woman.\nIn Beauvoir\u2019s words,\n\n\nThe erotic experience is one that most poignantly reveals to human\nbeings their ambiguous condition; they experience it as flesh and as\nspirit, as the other and as subject (SS: 2010, 416, cf. SS: 1949,\n190).\n\n\nThe concept of ambiguity, developed abstractly in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, is erotically embodied in The Second Sex and\nis identified as a crucial piece of the prescription for transcending\nthe oppressions of patriarchy. This description of the liberating\npossibilities of the erotic encounter is also one of those places\nwhere Beauvoir reworks Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology of\nembodiment. By drawing on Merleau-Ponty\u2019s descriptions of the\nways that we are world-making and world-embedded subject-objects, she\nreveals the ways that it is as subject-objects \u201cfor the\nworld\u201d, \u201cto the world\u201d, and \u201cin the\nworld\u201d that we are passionately drawn to each other.\n\nThe last chapters of The Second Sex, \u201cThe Independent\nWoman\u201d and the \u201cConclusion\u201d, speak of the current\n(1947) status of women\u2019s situation\u2014what has changed and\nwhat remains to be done. Without ignoring the importance of women\ngaining the right to vote and without dismissing the necessity of\nwomen attaining economic independence, Beauvoir finds these liberal\nand Marxist solutions to women\u2019s situation inadequate. They\nignore the effects of women\u2019s socialization (the subject of\nVolume II) and they are inattentive to the ways that masculine norms\nand the masculinist, sovereign subject remain the standard of the\nhuman. The liberated woman must free herself from two shackles: first,\nthe idea that to assume herself as a freedom and be independent she\nmust be like men, and second, the socialization through which she\nbecomes feminized. The first alienates her from her existence as a\n(sexual) subject. The second makes her averse to risking herself for\nher ideas/ideals. Attentive to this current state of affairs, and to\nthe phenomenology of the body, Beauvoir lays out a few prerequisites\nfor liberation. Women must be socialized to engage the world. And,\nthey must be allowed to discover the unique ways that their embodiment\nengages the world. In addition, there must be a complete overhaul of\npatriarchal morality, affective dispositions, and customs that demand\ngirls\u2019 and women\u2019s passivity and deny them their bodily\nautonomy. In short, the myth of the eternal feminine must be\ndismantled. So long as it prevails, economic and political advances\nwill fall short of the goal of liberation.\n\nControversial from the beginning, The Second Sex\u2019s\ncritique of patriarchy continues to challenge social, political and\nreligious categories used to justify women\u2019s inferior status.\nUltimately, what was a phenomenological breakthrough became in The\nSecond Sex a liberatory tool: by attending to the ways that\npatriarchal structures use sexual difference to deprive women of their\n\u201ccan do\u201d embodiment, Beauvoir made the case for declaring\nthis deprivation oppressive. Taken within the context of the feminist\nmovement, this declaration of oppression was an event. It opened the\nway for the consciousness-raising that characterized second-wave\nfeminism. It has and continues to validate the injustices experienced\nby girls and women. What was, from an existential-phenomenological\nperspective, a detailed analysis of the lived body and an ethical and\npolitical indictment of the ways that patriarchy alienates women from\ntheir embodied capacities, was, from a feminist perspective, an appeal\nthat called on women to take up the politics of liberation.\n",
