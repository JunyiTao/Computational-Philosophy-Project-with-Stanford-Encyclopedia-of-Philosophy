    "main_text": "The Varieties of Contemporary Deflationism || Minimalism\n3.1 Minimalism\n\nMinimalism is the version of deflationism that diverges the least from\ninflationism because it accepts many of the standard inflationary\npresuppositions, including that \u2018is true\u2019 is a predicate\nused to describe entities as having (or lacking) a truth property.\nWhat makes minimalism a version of deflationism is its denial of\ninflationism\u2019s final assumption, namely, that the property\nexpressed by the truth predicate has a substantive nature. Drawing\ninspiration from Leeds (1978), Horwich (1982, 182) actually coins the\nterm \u2018deflationism\u2019 while describing \u201cthe\ndeflationary redundancy theory which denies the existence of surplus\nmeaning and contends that Tarski\u2019s schema [\u201d\\(p\\)\u201c\nis true iff \\(p\\)] is quite sufficient to capture the concept.\u201d\nMinimalism, Horwich\u2019s mature deflationary position (1998a [First\nEdition, 1990]), adds to this earlier view. In particular, Horwich\n(ibid., 37, 125, 142) comes to embrace the idea that \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 does express a property, but it is merely a \u201clogical\nproperty\u201d (cf. Field 1992), rather than any substantive or\nnaturalistic property of truth with an analyzable underlying nature\n(Horwich 1998a, 2, 38, 120\u20131).\n\nOn the basis of natural language considerations, Horwich (ibid.,\n2\u20133, 39\u201340) holds that propositions are what the alethic\nlocutions describe directly. Any other entities that we can properly\ncall true are so only derivatively, on the basis of having some\nrelation to true propositions (ibid., 100\u20131 and Horwich 1998b,\n82\u20135). This seems to position Horwich well with respect to\nexplaining the instances of truth-talk that cause problems for Quine\nand Leeds, e.g., those about beliefs and theories. Regarding truth\napplied directly to propositions, however, Horwich (1998a, 2\u20133)\nstill explicitly endorses the thesis that Leeds emphasizes about the\nutility of the truth predicate (and, Horwich adds, the concept it\nexpresses), namely, that it \u201cexists solely for the sake of a\ncertain logical need\u201d. While Horwich (ibid., 138\u20139) goes\nso far as to claim that the concept of truth has a\n\u201cnon-descriptive\u201d function, he does not follow Quine and\nLeeds all the way to their rejection of the assumption that the\nalethic predicates function to describe truth-bearers. Rather, his\n(ibid., 31\u20133, 37) point of agreement with them is that the\nmain function of the truth predicate is its role in providing\na means for generalizing on embedded sentence positions, rather than\nsome role in the indication of specifically truth-involving states of\naffairs. Even so, Horwich (ibid., 38\u201340) still contends that the\ninstances of truth-talk do describe propositions, in the sense that\nthey make statements about them, and they do so by\nattributing a property to those propositions.\n\nThe version of (ES) that Horwich (1998a, 6) makes the basis of his\ntheory is what he also calls \u201cthe equivalence schema\u201d,\n\n(E)\nIt is true that \\(p\\) if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nSince he takes truth-talk to involve describing propositions with a\npredicate, Horwich considers \u2018it is true that \\(p\\)\u2019 to be\njust a trivial variant of \u2018The proposition that \\(p\\) is\ntrue\u2019, meaning that his (E) is a version of (ES-prop) rather\nthan of Ramsey\u2019s (ES-op). He also employs the notation\n\u2018\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\)\u2019 as shorthand specifically for\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, generating a further\nrendering of his equivalence schema (ibid., 10) that we can clearly\nrecognize as a version of (ES-prop), namely\n\n(E)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true iff \\(p\\).\n\n\nHorwich considers the instances of (E) to constitute the axioms of\nboth an account of the property of truth and an account of the concept\nof truth, i.e., what is meant by the word \u2018true\u2019 (ibid.,\n136). According to minimalism, the instances of (E) are explanatorily\nfundamental, which Horwich suggests is a reason for taking them to be\nnecessary (ibid., 21, n. 4). This, combined with his view that the\nequivalence schema applies to propositions, places his minimalism in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) in the chart given in Section 1.1. The\ninstances of (ES-prop) are thus explanatory of the functioning of the\ntruth predicate (of its role as a de-nominalizer of\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses (ibid., 5)), rather than being explained by\nthat functioning (as the analogous equivalences are for both\ndisquotationalism and prosententialism). Moreover, Horwich (ibid., 50,\n138) claims that they are also conceptually basic and a\npriori. He (ibid., 27\u201330, 33, 112) denies that truth admits\nof any sort of explicit definition or reductive analysis in terms of\nother concepts, such as reference or predicate-satisfaction. In fact,\nHorwich (ibid., 10\u20131, 111\u20132, 115\u20136) holds that these\nother semantic notions should both be given their own, infinitely\naxiomatized, minimalist accounts, which would then clarify the\nnon-reductive nature of the intuitive connections between them and the\nnotion of truth.\n\nHorwich (ibid., 27\u201330) maintains that the infinite axiomatic\nnature of minimalism is unavoidable. He (ibid., 25) rejects the\npossibility of a finite formulation of minimalism via the use\nof\n substitutional quantification.\n On the usual understanding of this non-standard type of\nquantification, the quantifiers govern variables that serve to mark\nplaces in linguistic strings, indicating that either all or some of\nthe elements of an associated substitution class of linguistic items\nof a particular category can be substituted in for the variables.\nSince it is possible for the variables so governed to take sentences\nas their substitution items, this allows for a type of quantification\ngoverning sentence positions in complex sentences. Using this sort of\nsentential substitutional quantification, the thought is, one can\nformulate a finite general principle that expresses Horwich\u2019s\naccount of truth as follows:\n\n(GT)\n\\(\\forall x\\, (x\\) is true iff \\(\\Sigma p (x = \\langle p\\rangle\n\\amp p)),\\)\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 is the existential substitutional\nquantifier. (GT) is formally equivalent to the formulation that Marian\nDavid (1994, 100) presents as disquotationalism\u2019s definition of\n\u2018true sentence\u2019, here formulated for propositions instead.\nHorwich\u2019s main reason for rejecting the proposed finite\nformulation of minimalism, (GT), is that an account of substitutional\nquantifiers seems (contra David 1994, 98\u20139) to require an appeal\nto truth (since the quantifiers are explained as expressing that at\nleast one or that every item in the associated substitution class\nyields a true sentence when substituted in for the governed\nvariables), generating circularity concerns (Horwich 1998a,\n25\u20136).\n\nMoreover, on Horwich\u2019s (ibid., 4, n. 1; Cf. 25, 32\u20133)\nunderstanding, the point of the truth predicate is to provide a\nsurrogate for substitutional quantification and sentence-variables in\nnatural language, so as \u201cto achieve the effect of generalizing\nsubstitutionally over sentences \u2026 but by means of ordinary\n[quantifiers and] variables (i.e., pronouns), which range over\nobjects\u201d (italics original). Horwich maintains that the\ninfinite \u201clist-like\u201d nature of minimalism poses no problem\nfor the view\u2019s adequacy with respect to explaining all of our\nuses of the truth predicate, and the bulk of Horwich 1998a attempts to\nestablish just that. However, Anil Gupta (1993a, 365) has pointed out\nthat minimalism\u2019s infinite axiomatization in terms of the\ninstances of (E) for every (non-paradox-inducing) proposition makes it\nmaximally ideologically complex, in virtue of involving every other\nconcept. (Moreover, the overtly \u201cfragmented\u201d nature of the\ntheory also makes it particularly vulnerable to the Generalization\nProblem that Gupta has raised, which we discuss in Section 4.5,\nbelow.)\n\nChristopher Hill (2002) attempts to deal with some of the problems\nthat Horwich\u2019s view faces, by presenting a view that he takes to\nbe a newer version of minimalism, replacing Horwich\u2019s\nequivalence schema with a universally quantified formula, employing a\nkind of substitutional quantification to provide a finite definition\nof \u2018true thought (proposition)\u2019. Hill\u2019s (ibid., 22)\nformulation of his account,\n\n(S)\nFor any object \\(x\\), \\(x\\) is true if and only if \\((\\Sigma p)((x\n=\\) the thought that \\(p)\\) and \\(p)\\),\n\n\nis formally similar to the formulation of minimalism in terms of (GT)\nthat Horwich rejects, but to avoid the circularity concerns driving\nthat rejection, Hill\u2019s (ibid., 18\u201322) idea is to offer\nintroduction and elimination rules in the style of Gerhard Gentzen\n(1935 [1969]) as a means for defining the substitutional quantifiers.\nHorwich (1998a, 26) rejects even this inference-rule sort of approach,\nbut he directs his critique against defining linguistic\nsubstitutional quantification this way. Hill takes his substitutional\nquantifiers to apply to thoughts (propositions) instead of sentences.\nBut serious concerns have been raised regarding the coherence of this\nnon-linguistic notion of substitutional quantification (cf. David\n2006, Gupta 2006b, Simmons 2006). As a result, it is unclear that\nHill\u2019s account is an improvement on Horwich\u2019s version of\nminimalism.\n",
