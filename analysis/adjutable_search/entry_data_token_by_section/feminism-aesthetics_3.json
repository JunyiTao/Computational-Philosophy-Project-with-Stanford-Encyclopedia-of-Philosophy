Feminist Practice and the Concept of Art\n\nFeminist analyses of aesthetic practices of the past have influenced\nthe production of feminist art of our own times, and the latter in\nturn has contributed to a dramatic alteration of the climate of the\nart world. The changes that have beset the worlds of art in the\ntwentieth century, perhaps most dramatically in the fields of the\nvisual arts, are frequently the subject of philosophical discussions\nin the analytic tradition regarding the possibility of defining art\n(Danto 1981; Davies 1991; Carroll 2000). One challenge to defining art\nstems from the fact that contemporary artists frequently create with\nthe intention of questioning, undermining, or rejecting values that\ndefined art of the past. The early and mid-twentieth century\nextravagances of Dada and Pop Art are most often the target of\nphilosophical inquiries, which seek to discover commonalities among\nartworks that have few to no perceptible defining similarities.\n\nAs we have seen, the category of fine art has been a focus of feminist\nscholarly scrutiny because its attendant values screened out much of\nwomen\u2019s creative efforts or actively dissuaded their attempts to\npractice certain genres. However, the dissolution of the values of\nfine art long preceded the art scene that feminists entered in the\n1970s. In spite of sweeping changes in the concepts of art and its\npurposes that characterize much art of the last century, the numbers\nof women practitioners in arts such as painting, sculpture, and music\nremained small. Therefore, while fine art may have historical\nimportance for women\u2019s artistic influence, it clearly was not\nthe perpetuating cause of their exclusion from the worlds of art. The\nanti-art and avant garde movements so frequently discussed by\ncontemporary analytic philosophers were just as male-dominated as\nclassical music or Renaissance sculpture. Moreover, values surrounding\nthe artistic \u201cgenius\u201d were just as vigorous as ever.\nTherefore, feminist art practices began as activist movements (such as\nthe Guerrilla Girls of New York City) to secure women more visibility\nand recognition in the artworld (Guerrilla Girls 2020). Feminist\nartists not only demanded that their work be taken seriously, they\nmounted a critique of the traditional thinking that lay behind their\nexclusions from the powerful centers of culture.\n\nFor these reasons, feminist art itself also furnishes numerous\nexamples that subvert older models of fine art, but with added layers\nof meaning that distinguish it from earlier iconoclastic movements.\nBecause of the gendered significance of the major concepts of the\naesthetic tradition, feminist challenges often systematically\ndeconstruct the concepts of art and aesthetic value reviewed above.\nFeminist art has joined\u2014and sometimes has led\u2014movements\nwithin the artworld that perplex, astound, offend, and exasperate,\nreversing virtually all the aesthetic values of earlier times. As art\ncritic Lucy Lippard put it, \u201cfeminism questions all the percepts\nof art as we know it\u201d (Lippard 1995: 172). Feminist artists have\nchallenged the ideas that art\u2019s main value is aesthetic, that it\nis for contemplation rather than use, that it is ideally the vision of\na single creator, that it should be interpreted as an object of\nautonomous value (Devereaux 1998). Feminism itself came under internal\ncriticism for its original focus on white, western women\u2019s\nsocial situations, a familiar critique in feminist circles that has a\npresence in aesthetic debates. By the late twentieth and early\ntwenty-first centuries, the energies of feminist and postfeminist\nartists of diverse racial and national backgrounds have made the\npresence of women in the contemporary artworld today powerful and\ndramatic (Deepwell 2020). Self-referential explorations of identity\nand agency\u2014often through performance art\u2014have been led by women of\ncolor such as Adrian Piper, who is also a philosopher (Piper 1996), as\nwell as by lesbian and trans artists whose work gives rise to queer\nfeminist art histories (Jones and Silver 2015).\n\nIn many discussions of contemporary art, \u201cfeminist\u201d is a\nlabel for work produced during the active phase of second-wave\nfeminism from the later 1960s to about 1980. The term\n\u201cpostfeminist\u201d is now in use for a subsequent generation\nof artists who pursue some of the ideas and interests of the earlier\nperiod. These terms are far from precise, and there are many artists\npracticing today who continue to identify themselves with the term\n\u201cfeminist.\u201d Perhaps an even larger group does not attend\nparticularly to labels, but their work is so provocative about the\nsubjects of gender and sexuality that it has become a focus for\nfeminist interpretation. (The photographic art of Cindy Sherman is a\ncase in point.)\n\nIn brief, feminist artists share a political sense of the historic\nsocial subordination of women and an awareness of how art practices\nhave perpetuated that subordination\u2014which is why the history of\naesthetics illuminates their work. The more politically-minded\nartists, especially those who participated in the feminist movement of\nthe 1970s, often turned their art to the goals of freeing women from\nthe oppressions of male-dominated culture. (Examples of such work\ninclude the Los Angeles anti-rape performance project of Suzanne Lacy\nand Leslie Leibowitz, In Mourning and in Rage (1977), and\nWomanhouse (1972), a collaboration of twenty-four artists.)\nFeminist artists opened up previously taboo subjects such as\nmenstruation and childbirth for artistic presentation, and they began\nto employ female body images widely in their work. All of these moves\nwere controversial, including within the feminist community. For\nexample, when Judy Chicago made her large collaborative installation\n\u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d in the early 1970s, she was both\npraised and criticized for the thematic use of vaginal imagery in the\ntable settings that represented each of thirty-nine famous women from\nhistory and legend (Chicago and Lucie-Smith 1999). Critics objected\nthat she was both essentializing women and reducing them to their\nreproductive parts; admirers praised her transgressive boldness. Since\nthat time, the increasing numbers of artistic portrayals of the female\nbody and its cycles has rendered these subjects less taboo and\ntransgressive, although they remain provocative and sometimes\ndisturbing. Early in his writing of feminist criticism for The\nNation, Arthur Danto characterized such work by feminist artists\nas \u2018disturbatory\u2019 (Arg\u00fcello 2017; Brand Weiser\n2021).\n\nPostfeminist artists, such as Kiki Smith and Jenny Saville, build upon\nthe efforts of their predecessors in exploring the body, gender, and\nsexual identity. Postfeminist art, often highly theoretical and deeply\nserious, also tends to be playful and parodic in style, such as the\nwork of Vanessa Beecroft. It tends to be less overtly political than\nthe art of earlier feminists. Influenced by postmodern speculations\nthat gender, sexuality, and the body itself are creations of culture\nthat are malleable and performative, postfeminist art confounds and\ndisrupts notions of stable identity (Grosz 1994; Butler 1990, 1993).\nSuch art can be seen as individualistic compared to the social agendas\nof earlier feminism, but perhaps for this reason this sort of art is\nalso more attuned to differences among women. These presentations of\nthe female body tend to draw attention to the position it has in\nculture: not only the sexed body, but also bodies marked by racial and\ncultural differences (James 2010). In the 1970s and 80s,\nCuban-American artist Ana Mendieta produced a series of works making\nuse of her own body to form silhouettes and shapes. All of this\nactivity is theoretically charged and often philosophically motivated\n(Reckitt 2001, Heartney 2013). At the same time, it should be stressed\nthat the kinds of art that qualify to be labeled\n\u201cfeminist\u201d are hugely varied and heterogeneous. And as\ntime passes and political climates shift, the interventions of artists\nand their visionary critiques alter accordingly. Twenty-first century\ntheorizing about feminist art now includes acknowledgement of the many\nforms of global feminisms and increased frequency of feminist content\nthat deals with war and politics. Robinson and Buszek offer a\nrefreshed definition of \u201cfeminist art\u201d that is not a simple\nclassification of a type of art, but rather indicates the space where\nfeminist politics and the domain of art-making intersect (Robinson and\nBuszek 2019; also Armstrong and de Zegher 2006).\n",
