    "main_text": "Contemporary Compatibilism || The Reason View\n4.3 The Reason View\n\nIn Freedom within Reason (1990), as well as in several\nprovocative papers (1980, 1987), Susan Wolf develops a theory of free\nwill and moral responsibility that highlights a mesh between an\nagent\u2019s action and what she (correctly) regards as valuable. For\nWolf, free will concerns an agent\u2019s ability to act in accord\nwith the True and the Good. Unlike Frankfurt\u2019s, the conditions\nof Wolf\u2019s mesh theory require an anchor external to the\nagent\u2019s internal psychological states (the True and the Good).\nThe crucial question for Wolf concerns whether an agent is able to act\nupon moral reasons. Hence, Wolf embraces the title, The Reason\nView. A related, though importantly different version of the\nReason View has more recently been defended by Nelkin (2011).\n\nIn her effort to make free will track moral reasons, Wolf (and later\nNelkin) develops a surprising asymmetry thesis according to which\npraiseworthy conduct does not require the freedom to do otherwise but\nblameworthy behavior does (1980; and 1990, pp.79\u201381). Put in\nterms of guidance and regulative control, only blameworthy conduct\nrequires regulative control. Guidance control is sufficient for\npraiseworthy conduct. Wolf\u2019s reasoning is that, if an agent does\nact in accord with the True and the Good, and if indeed she is so\npsychologically determined that she cannot but act in accord with the\nTrue and the Good, her inability to act otherwise does not threaten\nthe sort of freedom that morally responsible agents need. For how\ncould her freedom be in any way enhanced simply by adding an ability\nto act irrationally? But blameworthy behavior, Wolf reasons, does\nrequire regulative control since, if an agent acts contrary to the\nTrue and the Good, but is so psychologically determined that she\ncannot act in accord with it, then, being unable to act as reason\nrequires, it would be unreasonable to blame her.\n\nBecause Wolf\u2019s asymmetrical view requires regulative control in\nthe case of blameworthy actions, her compatibilism is open to\nrefutation by incompatibilist arguments designed to show that\ndeterminism is incompatible with freedom involving alternative\npossibilities. As a result, Wolf argues that physical determination\ndoes not entail psychological determination. She then argues that\nphysical determination is consistent with the ability to do otherwise\nbecause the relevant ability is one that only requires the falsity of\npsychological determinism, which is a thesis she takes to have no\nsupport. (Interestingly, this means that although Wolf is a\ncompatibilist about blameworthiness and physical determinism, she is\nan incompatibilist about blameworthiness and psychological\ndeterminsim.)\n\nWhat about the Source Incompatibilist Argument? On Wolf\u2019s view,\nif an agent does act from reasons, and if her reasons are (or are\nsusceptible to) the True and the Good, then she as an agent is a\nsource of conduct that carries with it (or is able to carry with it)\nthe stamp of moral reason. Enough said. But what about the Source\nIncompatibilist Argument, and the premise concerning ultimacy that\nseems to plague most every brand of compatibilism: A person acts of\nher own free will only if she is its ultimate source? Like\nFrankfurt\u2019s mesh theory, Wolf\u2019s too is endangered by the\nthought that an agent could be artificially manipulated in a\nresponsibility-undermining manner into satisfying the mesh\nWolf\u2019s theory demands. And mightn\u2019t such manipulation be\nno different than the manner in which a deterministic world shapes an\nagent to have the psychological structure and motives she has? Does\nnot the prospect of manipulation cases show that without ultimacy, an\nagent cannot be the proper source of her action? So it appears that\nWolf is at the same crossroads as is Frankfurt. Either she must show\nwhat is defective in the manipulation cases so as to distinguish\nagents so manipulated from the sort of proper mesh demanded by her\ntheory, or she must bite the same bullet and accept that these sorts\nof manipulated agents, by the conditions of her theory, do act of\ntheir own free wills and are morally responsible for their\nconduct.\n",
