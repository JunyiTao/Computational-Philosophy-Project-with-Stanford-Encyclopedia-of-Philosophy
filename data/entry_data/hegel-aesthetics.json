    "preamble": "\n\n\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, or philosophy of art, forms part of\nthe extraordinarily rich German aesthetic tradition that stretches from\nJ.J. Winckelmann\u2019s Thoughts on the Imitation of the Painting\nand Sculpture of the Greeks (1755) and G.E. Lessing\u2019s\nLaocoon (1766) through Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment (1790) and Friedrich Schiller\u2019s\nLetters on the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795) to Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s Birth of Tragedy (1872) and (in the\ntwentieth century) Martin Heidegger\u2019s The Origin of the Work\nof Art (1935\u20136) and T.W. Adorno\u2019s Aesthetic Theory\n(1970). Hegel was influenced in particular by Winckelmann, Kant and\nSchiller, and his own thesis of the \u201cend of art\u201d (or what\nhas been taken to be that thesis) has itself been the focus of close\nattention by Heidegger and Adorno. Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art is a\nwide ranging account of beauty in art, the historical development of\nart, and the individual arts of architecture, sculpture, painting,\nmusic and poetry. It contains distinctive and influential analyses of\nEgyptian art, Greek sculpture, and ancient and modern tragedy, and is\nregarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been\nproduced since Aristotle\u2019s Poetics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Hegel\u2019s Knowledge of Art\n\n\nHegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) contains\nchapters on the ancient Greek \u201creligion of art\u201d\n(Kunstreligion) and on the world-view presented in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone and Oedipus the King. His\nphilosophy of art proper, however, forms part of his\nphilosophy (rather than phenomenology) of spirit. The\nPhenomenology can be regarded as the introduction to\nHegel\u2019s philosophical system. The system itself comprises three\nparts: logic, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit, and is\nset out (in numbered paragraphs) in Hegel\u2019s Encyclopaedia of\nthe philosophical Sciences (1817, 1827, 1830). The philosophy of\nspirit is in turn divided into three sections: on subjective, objective\nand absolute spirit. Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art or\n\u201caesthetics\u201d constitutes the first sub-section of his\nphilosophy of absolute spirit, and is followed by his philosophy of\nreligion and his account of the history of philosophy.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art provides an a priori derivation\u2014from\nthe very concept of beauty itself\u2014of various forms of beauty and\nvarious individual arts. In marked contrast to Kant, however, Hegel\nweaves into his philosophical study of beauty numerous references to\nand analyses of individual works of art\u2014to such an extent,\nindeed, that his aesthetics constitutes, in Kai Hammermeister\u2019s words,\n\u201ca veritable world history of art\u201d (Hammermeister,\n24).\n\n\nHegel read both Greek and Latin (indeed, he wrote his diary partly in\nLatin from the age of fourteen); he also read English and French. He\nwas thus able to study the works of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles,\nEuripides, Virgil, Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re in the original\nlanguages. He never travelled to Greece or Italy, but he did undertake\nseveral long journeys from Berlin (where he was appointed Professor in\n1818) to Dresden (1820, 1821, 1824), the Low Countries (1822, 1827),\nVienna (1824) and Paris (1827). On these journeys he saw\nRaphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna and several paintings by\nCorreggio (in Dresden), Rembrandt\u2019s Night Watch (in\nAmsterdam), the central section of the van Eyck brothers\u2019\nAdoration of the Lamb (in Ghent)\u2014the wing panels were\nat that time in Berlin\u2014and \u201cfamous items by the noblest\nmasters one has seen a hundred times in copper engravings: Raphael,\nCorreggio, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian\u201d (in Paris) (Hegel: The\nLetters, 654). He liked to visit the theatre and opera, both\non his travels and in Berlin, and he was acquainted with leading\nsingers, such as Anna Milder-Hauptmann (who sang in the first\nproduction of Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio in 1814), as well as the\ncomposer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (whose revival of\nJ.S. Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion Hegel attended in March\n1829). Hegel was also on close personal terms with Goethe and knew his\ndrama and poetry especially well (as he did those of Friedrich\nSchiller).\n\n\nAdorno complains that \u201cHegel and Kant [ \u2026 ] were able to\nwrite major aesthetics without understanding anything about art\u201d\n(Adorno, 334). This may or may not be true of Kant, but it is clearly\nquite untrue of Hegel: he had an extensive knowledge and a good\nunderstanding of many of the great works of art in the Western\ntradition. Nor was Hegel\u2019s knowledge and interest restricted to\nWestern art: he read (in translation) works of Indian and Persian\npoetry, and he saw at first hand works of Egyptian art in Berlin\n(P\u00f6ggeler 1981, 206\u20138). Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art is\nthus an a priori derivation of the various forms of beauty that,\npace Adorno, is informed and mediated by a thorough knowledge\nand understanding of individual works of art from around the world.\n2. Hegel\u2019s Texts and Lectures on Aesthetics\n\n\nHegel\u2019s published thoughts on aesthetics are to be found in\npars. 556\u201363 of the 1830 Encyclopaedia. Hegel also held\nlectures on aesthetics in Heidelberg in 1818 and in Berlin in 1820/21\n(winter semester), 1823 and 1826 (summer semesters), and 1828/29\n(winter semester). Transcripts of Hegel\u2019s lectures made by his\nstudents in 1820/21, 1823, 1826 and 1828/29 have now been published (though so\nfar only the 1823 lectures have been translated into English) (see\nBibliography). In 1835 (and then again in 1842) one of Hegel\u2019s\nstudents, Heinrich Gustav Hotho, published an edition of Hegel\u2019s\nlectures on aesthetics based on a manuscript of Hegel\u2019s (now lost) and\na series of lecture transcripts. This is available in English as:\nG.W.F. Hegel,\nAesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T.M. Knox, 2 vols.\n(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975). Most of the secondary literature on\nHegel\u2019s aesthetics (in English and German) makes reference to\nHotho\u2019s edition. Yet according to one of the leading specialists\non Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert, Hotho\ndistorted Hegel\u2019s thought in various ways: he gave Hegel\u2019s\naccount of art a much stricter systematic structure than Hegel himself\nhad given it, and he supplemented Hegel\u2019s account with material\nof his own (PK\u00c4, xiii\u2013xv). Gethmann-Siefert argues,\ntherefore, that we should not rely on Hotho\u2019s edition for our\nunderstanding of Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, but should instead base our\ninterpretation on the available lecture transcripts.\n\n\nSince Hegel\u2019s manuscript, on which Hotho based much of his\nedition, has been lost, it is no longer possible to determine with\ncertainty to what extent (if at all) Hotho did in fact distort\nHegel\u2019s account of art. It should also be noted that\nGethmann-Siefert\u2019s own interpretation of Hegel\u2019s aesthetics\nhas been called into question (see Houlgate 1986a).\nNevertheless Gethmann-Siefert is right to encourage readers with a\nknowledge of German to consult the published transcripts, since they\ncontain a wealth of important material, and in some cases material that\nis missing from the Hotho edition (such as the brief reference to\nCaspar David Friedrich in the 1820/21 lectures [V\u00c4, \n192]).\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art has provoked considerable debate since his\ndeath in 1831. Does he believe that only Greek art is beautiful?  Does\nhe hold that art comes to an end in the modern age? The answers one\ngives to such questions should, however, be offered with a degree of\ncaution, for, sadly, there is no fully worked out philosophy of art by\nHegel that was officially endorsed by Hegel himself. The paragraphs in\nthe Encyclopaedia are written by Hegel, but they are very\nbrief and condensed and were intended to be supplemented by his\nlectures; the transcripts of the lectures are written by students of\nHegel (some taken down in class, some compiled afterwards from notes\ntaken in class); and the \u201cstandard\u201d edition of Hegel\u2019s\nlectures is a work put together by his student, Hotho (albeit using a\nmanuscript by Hegel himself). There is, therefore, no definitive\nedition of Hegel\u2019s fully developed aesthetic theory that would trump\nall others and settle all debate.\n3. Art, Religion and Philosophy in Hegel\u2019s System\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of art forms part of his overall philosophical\nsystem. In order to understand his philosophy of art, therefore, one\nmust understand the main claims of his philosophy as a whole. Hegel\nargues in his speculative logic that being is to be\nunderstood as self-determining reason or \u201cIdea\u201d\n(Idee). In the philosophy of nature, however, he goes on to\nshow that logic tells only half the story: for such reason is not\nsomething abstract\u2014is not a disembodied logos\u2014but\ntakes the form of rationally organized matter. What there is,\naccording to Hegel, is thus not just pure reason but physical,\nchemical and living matter that obeys rational principles.\n\n\nLife is more explicitly rational than mere physical matter because it\nis more explicitly self-determining. Life itself becomes more\nexplicitly rational and self-determining when it becomes conscious and\nself-conscious\u2014that is, life that can imagine, use language,\nthink and exercise freedom. Such self-conscious life Hegel calls\n\u201cspirit\u201d (Geist). Reason, or the Idea, comes to\nbe fully self-determining and rational, therefore, when it takes the\nform of self-conscious spirit. This occurs, in Hegel\u2019s view, with the\nemergence of human existence. Human beings, for Hegel, are\nthus not just accidents of nature; they are reason itself\u2014the\nreason inherent in nature\u2014that has come to life and come to\nconsciousness of itself. Beyond human beings (or other finite rational\nbeings that might exist on other planets), there is no self-conscious\nreason in Hegel\u2019s universe.\n\n\nIn his philosophy of objective spirit Hegel analyses the institutional\nstructures that are required if spirit\u2014that is,\nhumanity\u2014is to be properly free and self-determining. These\ninclude the institutions of right, the family, civil society and the\nstate. In the philosophy of absolute spirit Hegel then analyses the\ndifferent ways in which spirit articulates its ultimate,\n\u201cabsolute\u201d understanding of itself. The highest, most\ndeveloped and most adequate understanding of spirit is attained by\nphilosophy (the bare bones of whose understanding of the world have\njust been sketched). Philosophy provides an explicitly\nrational, conceptual understanding of the nature of reason or\nthe Idea. It explains precisely why reason must take the form\nof space, time, matter, life and self-conscious spirit.\n\n\nIn religion\u2014above all in Christianity\u2014spirit gives\nexpression to the same understanding of reason and of itself as\nphilosophy. In religion, however, the process whereby the Idea becomes\nself-conscious spirit is represented\u2014in images and\nmetaphors\u2014as the process whereby \u201cGod\u201d becomes the\n\u201cHoly Spirit\u201d dwelling in humanity. Furthermore, this\nprocess is one in which we put our faith and trust:\nit is the object of feeling and belief, rather than conceptual\nunderstanding.\n\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s view, philosophy and religion\u2014which is to say,\nHegel\u2019s own speculative philosophy and Christianity\u2014both\nunderstand the same truth. Religion, however, believes in a\nrepresentation of the truth, whereas philosophy understands that truth\nwith complete conceptual clarity. It may seem strange that we would\nneed religion, if we have philosophy: surely the latter makes the\nformer redundant. For Hegel, however, humanity cannot live by concepts\nalone, but also needs to picture, imagine, and have faith in the\ntruth.  Indeed, Hegel claims that it is in religion above all\nthat \u201ca nation defines what it considers to be true\u201d\n(Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, 105).\n\n\nArt, for Hegel, also gives expression to spirit\u2019s understanding of\nitself. It differs from philosophy and religion, however, by\nexpressing spirit\u2019s self-understanding not in pure concepts, or in the\nimages of faith, but in and through objects that have been\nspecifically made for this purpose by human beings. Such\nobjects\u2014conjured out of stone, wood, color, sound or\nwords\u2014render the freedom of spirit visible or audible to an\naudience.  In Hegel\u2019s view, this sensuous expression of free\nspirit constitutes beauty. The purpose of art, for Hegel, is\nthus the creation of beautiful objects in which the true character of\nfreedom is given sensuous expression.\n\n\nThe principal aim of art is not, therefore, to imitate nature, to\ndecorate our surroundings, to prompt us to engage in moral or\npolitical action, or to shock us out of our complacency. It is to\nallow us to contemplate and enjoy created images of our own spiritual\nfreedom\u2014images that are beautiful precisely because\nthey give expression to our freedom. Art\u2019s purpose, in other words, is\nto enable us to bring to mind the truth about ourselves, and so to\nbecome aware of who we truly are. Art is there not just for art\u2019s\nsake, but for beauty\u2019s sake, that is, for the sake of a distinctively\nsensuous form of human self-expression and self-understanding.\n4. Kant, Schiller and Hegel on Beauty and Freedom\n\n\nHegel\u2019s close association of art with beauty and freedom shows\nhis clear indebtedness to Kant and Schiller. Kant also maintained that\nour experience of beauty is an experience of freedom. He argued,\nhowever, that beauty is not itself an objective property of things.\nWhen we judge that a natural object or a work of art is beautiful, on\nKant\u2019s view, we are indeed making a judgment about an object, but\nwe are asserting that the object has a certain effect on us\n(and that it should have the same effect on all who view it). The\neffect produced by the \u201cbeautiful\u201d object is to set our\nunderstanding and imagination in \u201cfree play\u201d with one\nanother, and it is the pleasure generated by this free play that leads\nus to judge the object to be beautiful (Kant, 98, 102\u20133).\n\n\nIn contrast to Kant, Schiller understands beauty to be a property of\nthe object itself. It is the property, possessed by both living beings\nand works of art, of appearing to be free when in fact they are not. As\nSchiller puts it in the \u201cKallias\u201d letters, beauty is\n\u201cfreedom in appearance, autonomy in appearance\u201d (Schiller,\n151). Schiller insists that freedom itself is something\n\u201cnoumenal\u201d (to use Kant\u2019s terminology) and so can\nnever actually manifest itself in the realm of the senses. We can never\nsee freedom at work in, or embodied in, the world of space and time. In\nthe case of beautiful objects, therefore\u2014whether they are the\nproducts of nature or human imagination\u2014\u201cit is all that\nmatters [ \u2026 ] that the object appears as free, not that\nit really is so\u201d (Schiller, 151).\n\n\nHegel agrees with Schiller (against Kant) that beauty is an objective\nproperty of things. In his view, however, beauty is the direct sensuous\nmanifestation of freedom, not merely the appearance or\nimitation of freedom. It shows us what freedom actually looks like and\nsounds like when it gives itself sensuous expression (albeit with\nvarying degrees of idealization). Since true beauty is the direct\nsensuous expression of the freedom of spirit, it must be\nproduced by free spirit for free spirit, and so\ncannot be a mere product of nature. Nature is capable of a formal\nbeauty, and life is capable of what Hegel calls \u201csensuous\u201d\nbeauty (PK, 197), but true beauty is found only in works of\nart that are freely created by human beings to bring before\nour minds what it is to be free spirit.\n\n\nBeauty, for Hegel, has certain formal qualities: it is the unity or\nharmony of different elements in which these elements are not just\narranged in a regular, symmetrical pattern but are unified\norganically. Hegel gives an example of genuinely beautiful\nform in his discussion of Greek sculpture: the famous Greek profile is\nbeautiful, we are told, because the forehead and the nose flow\nseamlessly into one another, in contrast to the Roman profile in which\nthere is a much sharper angle between the forehead and nose\n(Aesthetics, 2: 727\u201330).\n\n\nBeauty, however, is not just a matter of form; it is also a matter of\ncontent. This is one of Hegel\u2019s most controversial\nideas, and is one that sets him at odds with those modern artists and\nart-theorists who insist that art can embrace any content we like and,\nindeed, can dispense with content altogether. As we have seen, the\ncontent that Hegel claims is central and indispensable to genuine\nbeauty (and therefore genuine art) is the freedom and richness of\nspirit. To put it another way, that content is the Idea, or absolute\nreason, as self-knowing spirit. Since the Idea is pictured in\nreligion as \u201cGod,\u201d the content of truly beautiful art is in\none respect the divine. Yet, as we have seen above, Hegel\nargues that the Idea (or \u201cGod\u201d) comes to consciousness of\nitself only in and through finite human beings. The content of\nbeautiful art must thus be the divine in human form or the divine\nwithin humanity itself (as well as purely human freedom).\n\n\nHegel recognizes that art can portray animals, plants and inorganic\nnature, but he sees it as art\u2019s principal task to present divine and\nhuman freedom. In both cases, the focus of attention is on\nthe human figure in particular. This is because, in\nHegel\u2019s view, the most appropriate sensuous incarnation of reason and\nthe clearest visible expression of spirit is the human form. Colors\nand sounds by themselves can certainly communicate a mood, but only\nthe human form actually embodies spirit and reason. Truly beautiful\nart thus shows us sculpted, painted or poetic images of Greek gods or\nof Jesus Christ\u2014that is, the divine in human form\u2014or it\nshows us images of free human life itself.\n5. Art and Idealization\n\n\nArt, for Hegel, is essentially figurative. This is not because it\nseeks to imitate nature, but because its purpose is to express and\nembody free spirit and this is achieved most adequately\nthrough images of human beings. (We will consider the exceptions to\nthis\u2014architecture and music\u2014below.) More specifically,\nart\u2019s role is to bring to mind truths about ourselves and our\nfreedom that we often lose sight of in our everyday activity. Its role\nis to show us (or remind us of) the true character of freedom.\nArt fulfills this role by showing us the freedom of spirit in its\npurest form without the contingencies of everyday life. That\nis to say, art at its best presents us not with the all too familiar\ndependencies and drudgery of daily existence, but with the\nideal of freedom (see Aesthetics, 1: 155\u20136). This\nideal of human (and divine) freedom constitutes true beauty and is\nfound above all, Hegel claims, in ancient Greek sculptures of gods and\nheroes.\n\n\nNote that the work of idealization is undertaken not (like modern\nfashion photography) to provide an escape from life into a world of\nfantasy, but to enable us to see our freedom more\nclearly. Idealization is undertaken, therefore, in the interests of a\nclearer revelation of the true character of humanity (and of the\ndivine). The paradox is that art communicates truth\nthrough idealized images of human beings (and indeed\u2014in\npainting\u2014through the\nillusion of external reality).\n\n\nIt is worth noting at this stage that Hegel\u2019s account of art is\nmeant to be both descriptive and normative. Hegel thinks that the\naccount he gives describes the principal features of the greatest works\nof art in the Western tradition, such as the sculptures of Phidias or\nPraxiteles or the dramas of Aeschylus or Sophocles. At the same time,\nhis account is normative in so far as it tells us what true\nart is. There are many things that we call \u201cart\u201d: cave\npaintings, a child\u2019s drawing, Greek sculpture,\nShakespeare\u2019s plays, adolescent love poetry, and (in the\ntwentieth century) Carl Andr\u00e9\u2019s bricks. Not everything\ncalled \u201cart\u201d deserves the name, however, because not\neverything so called does what true art is meant to do:\nnamely, give sensuous expression to free spirit and thereby create\nworks of beauty. Hegel does not prescribe strict rules for the\nproduction of beauty; but he does set out broad criteria that\ntruly beautiful art must meet, and he is critical of work\nthat claims to be \u201cart\u201d but that fails to meet these\ncriteria.  Hegel\u2019s critique of certain developments in\npost-Reformation art\u2014such as the aspiration to do no more than\nimitate nature\u2014is thus based, not on contingent personal\npreferences, but on his philosophical understanding of the true nature\nand purpose of art.\n6. Hegel\u2019s Systematic Aesthetics or Philosophy of Art\n\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophical account of art and beauty has three\nparts: 1) ideal beauty as such, or beauty proper, 2) the different\nforms that beauty takes in history, and 3) the different arts in which\nbeauty is encountered. We will look first at Hegel\u2019s account of\nideal beauty as such.\n6.1 Ideal Beauty as such\n\n\nHegel is well aware that art can perform various functions: it can\nteach, edify, provoke, adorn, and so on. His concern, however, is to\nidentify art\u2019s proper and most distinctive function. This, he claims,\nis to give intuitive, sensuous expression to the freedom of\nspirit. The point of art, therefore, is not to be\n\u201crealistic\u201d\u2014to imitate or mirror the contingencies\nof everyday life\u2014but to show us what divine and\nhuman freedom look like. Such sensuous expression of\nspiritual freedom is what Hegel calls the \u201cIdeal,\u201d or true\nbeauty.\n\n\nThe realm of the sensuous is the realm of individual things in space\nand time. Freedom is given sensuous expression, therefore, when it is\nembodied in an individual who stands alone in his or her\n\u201cself-enjoyment, repose, and bliss [Seligkeit]\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 179). Such an individual must not be abstract\nand formal (as, for example, in the early Greek Geometric style), nor\nshould he be static and rigid (as in much ancient Egyptian sculpture),\nbut his body and posture should be visibly animated by freedom and\nlife, without, however, sacrificing the stillness and serenity that\nbelongs to ideal self-containment. Such ideal beauty, Hegel claims, is\nfound above all in fifth- and fourth-century Greek sculptures of the\ngods, such as the Dresden Zeus (a cast of which Hegel saw in the early\n1820s) or Praxiteles\u2019 Cnidian Aphrodite (see\nPK\u00c4, 143 and Houlgate 2007, 58).\n\n\nAncient Greek sculpture, which Hegel would have known almost\nexclusively from Roman copies or from plaster casts, presents what he\ncalls pure or \u201cabsolute\u201d beauty (PK\u00c4, \n124). It does not, however, exhaust the idea of beauty, for it does not\ngive us beauty in its most concrete and developed form. This\nwe find in ancient Greek drama\u2014especially tragedy\u2014in\nwhich free individuals proceed to action that leads to conflict and,\nfinally, to resolution (sometimes violently, as in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone, sometimes peacefully, as in Aeschylus\u2019\nOresteian trilogy). The gods represented in Greek sculpture\nare beautiful because their physical shape perfectly embodies their\nspiritual freedom and is not marred by marks of physical frailty or\ndependence. The principal heroes and heroines of Greek tragedy are\nbeautiful because their free activity is informed and animated by an\nethical interest or \u201cpathos\u201d (such as care for the family,\nas in the case of Antigone, or concern for the welfare of the state,\nas in the case of Creon), rather than by petty human foibles or\npassions.  These heroes are not allegorical representations of\nabstract virtues, but are living human beings with imagination,\ncharacter and free will; but what moves them is a passion for an\naspect of our ethical life, an aspect that is supported and\npromoted by a god.\n\n\nThis distinction between pure beauty, found in Greek\nsculpture, and the more concrete beauty found in Greek drama\nmeans that ideal beauty actually takes two subtly different forms.\nBeauty takes these different forms because pure sculptural\nbeauty\u2014though it is the pinnacle of art\u2019s achievement\u2014has\na certain abstractness about it. Beauty is the sensuous\nexpression of freedom and so must exhibit the concreteness, animation\nand humanity that are missing, for example, in Egyptian sculpture. Yet\nsince pure beauty, as exemplified by Greek sculpture, is spiritual\nfreedom immersed in spatial, bodily shape, it lacks the more\nconcrete dynamism of action in time, action that is animated\nby imagination and language. This is what lends a certain\n\u201cabstractness\u201d (and, indeed, coldness) to pure beauty\n(PK\u00c4, 57, 125). If art\u2019s role is to give sensuous\nexpression to true freedom, however, it must move beyond\nabstraction towards concreteness. This means that it must move beyond\npure beauty to the more concrete and genuinely human beauty\nof drama. These two kinds of ideal beauty thus constitute the most\nappropriate objects of art and, taken together, form what Hegel calls\nthe \u201ccentre\u201d (Mittelpunkt) of art itself\n(PK\u00c4, 126).\n6.2 The Particular Forms of Art\n\n\nHegel also acknowledges that art can, indeed must, both fall short of\nand go beyond such ideal beauty. It falls short of ideal beauty when\nit takes the form of symbolic art, and it goes beyond such\nbeauty when it takes the form of romantic art. The form of\nart that is characterized by works of ideal beauty itself is\nclassical art. These are the three forms of art\n(Kunstformen), or \u201cforms of the beautiful\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 68), that Hegel believes are made necessary by\nthe very idea of art itself. The development of art from one form to\nanother generates what Hegel regards as the distinctive\nhistory of art.\n\n\nWhat produces these three art-forms is the changing relation between\nthe content of art\u2014the Idea as spirit\u2014and its\nmode of presentation. The changes in this relation are in turn\ndetermined by the way in which the content of art is itself conceived.\nIn symbolic art the content is conceived abstractly, such that it is\nnot able to manifest itself adequately in a sensuous, visible form. In\nclassical art, by contrast, the content is conceived in such a way\nthat it is able to find perfect expression in sensuous, visible\nform. In romantic art, the content is conceived in such a way that it\nis able to find adequate expression in sensuous, visible form and yet\nalso ultimately transcends the realm of the sensuous and visible.\n\n\nClassical art is the home of ideal beauty proper, whereas romantic art\nis the home of what Hegel calls the \u201cbeauty of inwardness\u201d\n(Sch\u00f6nheit der Innigkeit) or, as Knox translates it,\n\u201cbeauty of deep feeling\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 531).\nSymbolic art, by contrast, falls short of genuine beauty altogether.\nThis does not mean that it is simply bad art: Hegel recognizes that\nsymbolic art is often the product of the highest level of artistry.\nSymbolic art falls short of beauty because it does not yet have a rich\nenough understanding of the nature of divine and human spirit. The\nartistic shapes it produces are deficient, therefore, because the\nconceptions of spirit that underlie it\u2014conceptions that are\ncontained above all in religion\u2014are deficient\n(PK\u00c4, 68).\n6.2.1 Symbolic Art\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of symbolic art encompasses the art of many\ndifferent civilizations and shows his considerable understanding of,\nand appreciation for, non-Western art. Not all of the types of symbolic\nart Hegel discusses, however, are fully and properly symbolic.\nSo what connects them all? The fact that they all belong to the sphere\nof what Hegel calls \u201cpre-art\u201d (Vorkunst)\n(PK\u00c4, 73). Art proper, for Hegel, is the sensuous\nexpression or manifestation of free spirit in a medium (such as metal,\nstone or color) that has been deliberately shaped or\nworked by human beings into the expression of freedom. The\nsphere of \u201cpre-art\u201d comprises art that falls short of art\nproper in some way. This is either because it is the product of a\nspirit that does not yet understand itself to be truly free,\nor because it is the product of a spirit that does have a sense of its\nown freedom but does not yet understand such freedom to involve the\nmanifestation of itself in a sensuous medium that has been specifically\nshaped to that end. In either case, compared to genuine art,\n\u201cpre-art\u201d rests on a relatively abstract\nconception of spirit.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s intention in his account of symbolic art is not to\ncomment exhaustively on every kind of \u201cpre-art\u201d there is.\nHe says nothing, for example, about prehistoric art (such as cave\npainting), nor does he discuss Chinese art or Buddhist art (even though\nhe discusses both Chinese religion and Buddhism in his lectures on the\nphilosophy of religion). Hegel\u2019s aim in his account of symbolic\nart is to examine the various kinds of art that are made necessary by\nthe very concept of art itself, the stages through which art has to\npass on its journey from pre-art to art proper.\n\n\nThe first stage is that in which spirit is conceived as being in an\nimmediate unity with nature. This stage is encountered in the\nancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism. The Zoroastrians, Hegel\nclaims, believe in a divine power\u2014the Good\u2014but\nthey identify this divinity with an aspect of nature itself, namely\nwith light. Light does not symbolize or point to a separate God or\nGood; rather, in Zoroastrianism (as Hegel understands it) light\nis the Good, is God (Aesthetics, 1: 325).\nLight is thus the substance in all things and that which gives life to\nall plants and animals. This light, Hegel tells us, is personified as\nOrmuzd (or Ahura Mazda). Unlike the God of the Jews, however, Ormuzd is\nnot a free, self-conscious subject. He (or it) is the Good in the form\nof light itself, and so is present in all sources of light, such as the\nsun, stars and fire.\n\n\nThe question we have to ask, Hegel remarks, is whether seeing the Good\nas light (or giving utterance to such an intuition) counts as art\n(PK\u00c4, 76). In Hegel\u2019s view, it does not do so for two\nreasons: on the one hand, the Good is not understood to be free spirit\nthat is distinct from, but manifests itself in, the light; on the\nother hand, the sensuous element in which the Good is\npresent\u2014the light itself\u2014is understood not to be something\nshaped or produced by free spirit for the purpose of its\nself-expression, but simply to be a given feature of nature with which\nthe Good is immediately identical.\n\n\nIn the Zoroastrian vision of the Good as light, we encounter the\n\u201csensuous presentation [Darstellung] of the\ndivine\u201d (PK\u00c4, 76). This vision, however, does\nnot constitute a work of art, even though it finds expression\nin well-crafted prayers and utterances.\n\n\nThe second stage in the development of pre-art is that in which there\nis an immediate difference between spirit and nature. This is\nfound, in Hegel\u2019s view, in Hindu art. The difference between the\nspiritual and the natural means that the spiritual\u2014i.e., the\ndivine\u2014cannot be understood (as in Persia) to be simply\nidentical with some immediately given aspect of nature. On the other\nhand, Hegel claims, the divine in Hinduism is conceived in such an\nabstract and indeterminate way that it acquires determinate\nform only in and through something immediately sensuous, external and\nnatural. The divine is thus understood to be present in the\nvery form of something sensuous and natural. As Hegel puts it in his\n1826 lectures on aesthetics: \u201cnatural objects\u2014the human\nbeing, animals\u2014are revered as divine\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n79).\n\n\nHindu art marks the difference between the spiritual (or divine) and\nthe merely natural by extending, exaggerating and distorting the\nnatural forms in which the divine is imagined to be present. The divine\nis portrayed not in the purely natural form of an animal or human\nbeing, therefore, but in the unnaturally distorted\nform of an animal or human being. (Shiva is portrayed with many arms,\nfor example, and Brahma with four faces.)\n\n\nHegel notes that such portrayal involves the work of\n\u201cshaping\u201d or \u201cforming\u201d the medium of\nexpression (PK\u00c4, 78). In that sense, one can speak of\nHindu \u201cart.\u201d He claims, however, that Hindu art does not\nfulfill the true purpose of art because it does not give appropriate\nand adequate shape to free spirit and thereby create images of beauty.\nRather, it simply distorts the natural shape of animals and human\nbeings\u2014to the point at which they become \u201cugly\u201d\n(unsch\u00f6n), \u201cmonstrous,\u201d\n\u201cgrotesque\u201d or \u201cbizarre\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n78, 84)\u2014in order to show that the divine or spiritual, which\ncannot be understood except in terms of the natural and sensuous, is\nat the same time different from, and finds no adequate expression in,\nthe realm of the natural and sensuous. Hindu divinity is inseparable\nfrom natural forms, but it indicates its distinctive presence by the\nunnaturalness of the natural forms it adopts.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s judgment on Hindu art does not mean, by the way, that he\nfinds no merit at all in such art. He remarks on the splendor of Hindu\nart and on the \u201cmost tender feeling\u201d and the\n\u201cwealth of the finest sensuous naturalness\u201d that such art\ncan display. He insists, however, that Hindu art fails to reach the\nheight of art, in which spirit is shown to be free in itself and is\ngiven appropriate natural, visible shape (PK\u00c4, \n84).\n\n\nThe third stage in the development of \u201cpre-art\u201d is that of\ngenuinely symbolic art in which shapes and images are\ndeliberately designed and created to point to a determinate and quite\nseparate sphere of \u201cinteriority\u201d\n(Innerlichkeit) (PK\u00c4, 86). This is the\nprovince of ancient Egyptian art. The Egyptians, Hegel tells us, were\nthe first people to \u201cfix\u201d (fixieren) the idea of\nspirit as something inward that is separate and independent in itself\n(PK\u00c4, 85). (In this context he refers to Herodotus,\nwho maintained that the Egyptians were \u201cthe first people to put\nforward the doctrine of the immortality of the soul\u201d [Herodotus,\n145 [2: 123]].) Spirit, as Hegel understands it (in his philosophy of\nsubjective and objective spirit), is the activity of externalizing and\nexpressing itself in images, words, actions and institutions. With the\nidea of spirit as \u201cinteriority,\u201d therefore, there\nnecessarily comes the drive to give an external shape to this inner\nspirit, that is, to produce a shape for spirit from out of\nspirit itself. The drive to create shapes and images\u2014works of\nart\u2014through which the inner realm can make itself known is thus\nan \u201cinstinct\u201d in the Egyptians that is deeply rooted in the\nway they understand spirit. In this sense, in Hegel\u2019s view,\nEgyptian civilization is a more profoundly artistic civilization than\nthat of the Hindus (Aesthetics, 1: 354; PK\u00c4, \n86).\n\n\nEgyptian art, however, is only symbolic art, not art in its full sense.\nThis is because the created shapes and images of Egyptian art do not\ngive direct, adequate expression to spirit, but merely point\nto, or symbolize, an interiority that remains hidden from view.\nFurthermore, the inner spirit, though fixed in the Egyptian\nunderstanding as a \u201cseparate, independent inwardness\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 86), is not itself understood as fully\nfree spirit. Indeed, the realm of spirit is understood by the\nEgyptians to a large degree as the simple negation of the\nrealm of nature and life. That is to say, it is understood above all as the realm\nof the dead.\n\n\nThe fact that death is the principal realm in which the independence of the soul\nis preserved explains why the doctrine of the immortality of the soul\nis so important to the Egyptians. It also explains why Hegel sees the\npyramid as the image that epitomizes Egyptian symbolic art.\nThe pyramid is a created shape that hides within it something separate\nfrom it, namely a dead body. It thus serves as the perfect image of\nEgyptian symbols which point to, but do not themselves reveal\nand express, a realm of interiority that is independent but still lacks\nthe freedom and life of genuine spirit (Aesthetics, 1:\n356).\n\n\nFor Hegel, Greek art contains symbolic elements (such as the eagle to\nsymbolize the power of Zeus), but the core of Greek art is not the\nsymbol. Egyptian art, by contrast, is symbolic through and through.\nIndeed, Egyptian consciousness as a whole, in Hegel\u2019s view, is\nessentially symbolic. Animals, for example, are regarded as symbols or\nmasks of something deeper, and so animal faces are often used as masks\n(by amongst others, embalmers). Symbolism can also be multi-layered:\nthe image of the phoenix, Hegel claims, symbolizes natural (especially,\ncelestial) processes of disappearance and reemergence, but those\nprocesses are themselves viewed as symbols of spiritual rebirth\n(PK\u00c4, 87).\n\n\nAs noted above, the pyramid epitomizes the symbolic art of the\nEgyptians. Such art, however, does not just point symbolically to the\nrealm of the dead; it also bears witness to an incipient but still\nundeveloped awareness that true inwardness is found in the living human\nspirit. It does so, Hegel maintains, by showing the human spirit\nstruggling to emerge from the animal. The image that best depicts this\nemergence is, of course, that of the sphinx (which has the body of a\nlion and the head of a human being). The human form is also mixed with\nthat of animals in images of gods, such as Horus (who has a human body\nand a falcon\u2019s head). Such images, however, do not constitute art\nin the full sense because they fail to give adequate expression to free\nspirit in the form of the fully human being. They are mere\nsymbols that partially disclose an interiority whose true character\nremains hidden from view (and mysterious even to the Egyptians\nthemselves).\n\n\nEven when the human form is depicted in Egyptian art without\nadulteration, it is still not animated by a genuinely free and living\nspirit and so does not become the shape of freedom itself. Figures,\nsuch as the Memnon Colossi of Amenhotep III in Western Thebes, display\nno \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d (PK\u00c4, 89), in\nHegel\u2019s view, and other smaller figures, which stand with their arms\npressed to their sides and their feet firmly planted on the ground,\nlack \u201cgrace [Grazie] of movement.\u201d Egyptian\nsculpture is praised by Hegel as \u201cworthy of admiration\u201d;\nindeed, he claims that under the Ptolemies (305\u201330 B.C.)\nEgyptian sculpture exhibited great \u201cdelicacy\u201d (or\n\u201celegance\u201d) (Zierlichkeit). Nonetheless, for all\nits merits, Egyptian art does not give shape to real freedom and life\nand so fails to fulfill the true purpose of art.\n\n\nThe fourth stage of pre-art is that in which spirit gains such a degree\nof freedom and independence that spirit and nature \u201cfall\napart\u201d (PK\u00c4, 89). This stage is in turn\nsub-divided into three. The first sub-division comprises\nsublime art: the poetic art of the Jewish people.\n\n\nIn Judaism, Hegel maintains, spirit is understood to be fully free and\nindependent. This freedom and independence is, however, attributed to\nthe divine rather than the human spirit. God is thus conceived as a\n\u201cfree spiritual subject\u201d (PK\u00c4, 75), who is\nthe creator of the world and the power over everything natural and\nfinite. That which is natural and finite is, by contrast, regarded as\nsomething \u201cnegative\u201d in relation to God, that is, as\nsomething that does not exist for its own sake but that has been\ncreated to serve God (PK\u00c4, 90).\n\n\nJudaic spirituality, in Hegel\u2019s view, is not capable of producing\nworks of true beauty because the Jewish God transcends the world of\nnature and finitude and cannot manifest itself in that world\nand be given visible shape in it. Jewish poetry (the Psalms) gives\nexpression, rather, to the sublimity of God by praising and exalting\nHim as the source of all things. At the same time, such poetry gives\n\u201cbrilliant\u201d (gl\u00e4nzend) expression to the pain\nand fear felt by the sinful in relation to their Lord\n(PK\u00c4, 91).\n\n\nThe second sub-division of this fourth stage of pre-art comprises what\nHegel calls \u201coriental pantheism\u201d and is found in the poetry\nof Islamic \u201cArabs, Persians, and Turks\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n93), such as the Persian lyric poet Hafez (German: Hafis) (c.\n1310\u20131389). In such pantheism, God is also understood to stand\nsublimely above and apart from the realm of the finite and natural, but\nhis relation to that realm is held to be affirmative, rather\nthan negative. The divine raises things to their own magnificence,\nfills them with spirit, gives them life and in this sense is actually\nimmanent in things (Aesthetics, 1: 368;\nPK\u00c4, 93).\n\n\nThis in turn determines the relation that the poet has to objects. For\nthe poet, too, is free and independent of things, but also has an\naffirmative relation to them. That is to say, he feels an identity\nwith things and sees his own untroubled freedom reflected in\nthem. Such pantheism thus comes close to genuine art, for it uses\nnatural objects, such as a rose, as poetic \u201cimages\u201d\n(Bilder) of its own feeling of \u201ccheerful, blessed\ninwardness\u201d (PK\u00c4, 94\u20135). The pantheistic spirit remains, however, free within itself in distinction from and in\nrelation to natural objects; it does not create shapes of its\nown\u2014such as the idealized figures of the Greek gods\u2014in\nwhich its freedom comes directly into view. (Note, by the way, that in the Hotho edition of Hegel\u2019s lectures on aesthetics pantheistic Islamic poetry is placed before, rather than after, the poetry of Judaism; see Aesthetics, 1: 364\u201377.)\n\n\nThe third sub-division of the fourth stage of pre-art is that in which\nthere is the clearest break between spirit and the realm of the\nnatural or sensuous. At this stage, the spiritual aspect\u2014that\nwhich is inner and, as it were, invisible\u2014takes the form of\nsomething quite separate and distinct. It is also something finite and\nlimited: an idea or meaning entertained by human beings. The\nsensuous element is in turn something separate and distinct from the\nmeaning. It has no intrinsic connection to the meaning, but is, as\nHegel puts it, \u201cexternal\u201d to that meaning. The sensuous\nelement\u2014the pictorial or poetic image\u2014is thus connected\nwith the meaning by nothing but the subjective \u201cwit\u201d or\nimagination of the poet (PK\u00c4, 95). This occurs, Hegel\nmaintains, in fables, parables, allegories, metaphors and similes.\n\n\nThis third sub-division is not associated with any particular\ncivilization, but is a form of expression that is found in many\ndifferent ones. Hegel contends, however, that allegory, metaphor and\nsimile do not constitute the core of truly beautiful art, because they\ndo not present us with the very freedom of spirit itself, but point\nto (and so symbolize) a meaning that is separate and independent.\nA metaphor, such as \u201cAchilles is a lion,\u201d does not embody\nthe spirit of the individual hero in the way that a Greek sculpture\ndoes, but is a metaphor for something that is distinct from\nthe metaphor itself (see Aesthetics, 1: 402\u20138;\nPK\u00c4, 104).\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of symbolic art (or \u201cpre-art\u201d) draws\nwidely on the work of other writers, such as his former colleague at\nHeidelberg, Georg Friedrich Creuzer, the author of Symbolism and\nMythology of Ancient Peoples, especially the Greeks (1810\u201312).\nHegel\u2019s account is not meant to be strictly historical, but\nrather to place the various forms of pre-art discussed in a\nlogical relation to one another. This relation is determined\nby the degree to which, in each form of pre-art, spirit and nature (or\nthe sensuous) are differentiated from one another.\n\n\nTo recapitulate: in Zoroastrianism, spirit and nature are in immediate\nidentity with one another (as the Light). In Hindu art, there\nis an immediate difference between the spiritual (the divine)\nand nature, but the spiritual remains abstract and indeterminate in\nitself and so can be brought to mind only through images of natural\nthings (unnaturally distorted). In Egyptian art, the spiritual is again\ndifferent from the realm of the merely natural and sensuous.\nIn contrast to the indeterminate divinity of the Hindus, however,\nEgyptian spirituality (in the form of the gods and of the human soul)\nis fixed, separate and determinate in itself. The images of Egyptian\nart thus point symbolically to a realm of spirit that remains\nhidden from direct view. The spirit to which such symbolic images\npoint, however, lacks genuine freedom and life and is often identified\nwith the realm of the dead.\n\n\nIn the sublime poetry of the Jews, God is represented as transcendent\nand as a \u201cfree spiritual subject.\u201d Finite human\nbeings, however, are portrayed in a negative relation to God\nin that they are created to serve and praise God and are pained by\ntheir own sinfulness. In the sublime poetry of \u201coriental\npantheism\u201d God is once again portrayed as transcendent, but, in\ncontrast to Judaism, God and finite things are shown to stand in an\naffirmative relation to one another: things are infused with\nspirit and life by God. The poet\u2019s relation to things is,\naccordingly, one in which his own free spirit finds itself\nreflected in the natural things around him.\n\n\nIn the last stage of pre-art, the difference between the spiritual and\nthe natural (or sensuous) is taken to its limit: the spiritual element\n(the \u201cmeaning\u201d) and the sensuous element (the\n\u201cshape\u201d or \u201cimage\u201d) are now completely\nindependent of, and external to, one another. Furthermore,\neach is finite and limited. This is the realm of allegory and metaphor.\n6.2.2 Classical Art\n\n\nHegel does not deny the magnificence or elegance of pre-art, but he\nmaintains that it falls short of art proper. The latter is found in\nclassical art, or the art of the ancient Greeks.\n\n\nClassical art, Hegel contends, fulfills the concept of art in that it\nis the perfect sensuous expression of the freedom of spirit. It is in\nclassical art, therefore\u2014above all in ancient Greek sculpture\n(and drama)\u2014that true beauty is to be found. Indeed, Hegel\nmaintains, the gods of ancient Greece exhibit \u201cabsolute beauty\nas such\u201d: \u201cthere can be nothing more beautiful than the\nclassical; there is the ideal\u201d (PK\u00c4, 124, 135;\nsee also Aesthetics, 1: 427).\n\n\nSuch beauty consists in the perfect fusion of the spiritual and the\nsensuous (or natural). In true beauty the visible shape before us does\nnot merely intimate the presence of the divine through the unnatural\ndistortion of its form, nor does it point beyond itself to a hidden\nspirituality or to divine transcendence. Rather, the shape manifests\nand embodies free spirituality in its very contours. In true beauty,\ntherefore, the visible shape is not a symbol of, or metaphor for, a\nmeaning that lies beyond the shape, but is the expression of\nspirit\u2019s freedom that brings that freedom directly into view.\nBeauty is sensuous, visible shape so transformed that it stands as the\nvisible embodiment of freedom itself.\n\n\nHegel does not deny that Greek art and mythology contain many symbolic\nelements: the story, for example, that Cronus, the father of Zeus,\nconsumed his own children symbolizes the destructive power of time\n(Aesthetics, 1: 492; PK\u00c4, 120). In\nHegel\u2019s view, however, the distinctive core of Greek art consists\nin works of ideal beauty in which the freedom of spirit is made visible\nfor the first time in history. Three conditions had to be met for such\nbeautiful art to be produced.\n\n\nFirst, the divine had to be understood to be freely self-determining\nspirit, to be divine subjectivity (not just an abstract power\nsuch as the Light). Second, the divine had to be understood to take the\nform of individuals who could be portrayed in sculpture and\ndrama. The divine had to be conceived, in other words, not as sublimely\ntranscendent, but as spirituality that is embodied in many\ndifferent ways. The beauty of Greek art thus presupposed Greek\npolytheism. Third, the proper shape of free spirit had to be recognized\nto be the human body, not that of an animal. Hindu and Egyptian gods\nwere often portrayed as a fusion of human and animal forms; by\ncontrast, the principal Greek gods were depicted in ideal human form.\nHegel notes that Zeus would sometimes take on animal form, for example\nwhen he was engaged in seduction; but he sees Zeus\u2019\ntransformation of himself into a bull for the purpose of seduction as a\nlingering echo of Egyptian mythology in the Greek world (see\nPK\u00c4, 119\u201320, in which Hegel confuses Io, who in another story was\nherself changed into a white cow by Zeus to protect her from the jealous Hera, with Europa,\nwho was the object of Zeus\u2019 love in the story Hegel has in\nmind).\n\n\nNot only do Greek art and beauty presuppose Greek religion and\nmythology, but Greek religion itself requires art in order to\ngive a determinate identity to the gods. As Hegel notes (following\nHerodotus), it was the poets Homer and Hesiod who gave the Greeks their\ngods, and Greek understanding of the gods was developed and expressed\nabove all in their sculpture and drama (rather than in distinctively\ntheological writings) (PK\u00c4, 123\u20134). Greek religion\nthus took the form of what Hegel in the Phenomenology called a\n\u201creligion of art.\u201d Moreover, Greek art achieved the highest\ndegree of beauty, in Hegel\u2019s view, precisely because it\nwas the highest expression of the freedom of spirit enshrined in Greek\nreligion.\n\n\nAlthough Greek sculpture and drama achieved unsurpassed heights of\nbeauty, such art did not give expression to the deepest\nfreedom of the spirit. This is because of a deficiency in the Greek\nconception of divine and human freedom. Greek religion was so well\nsuited to aesthetic expression because the gods were conceived as free\nindividuals who were wholly at one with their bodies and their sensuous\nlife. In other words, they were free spirits still immersed in nature\n(PK\u00c4, 132\u20133). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, a\ndeeper freedom is attained when the spirit withdraws into itself out of\nnature and becomes pure self-knowing interiority. Such an understanding\nof spirit is expressed, according to Hegel, in Christianity. The\nChristian God is thus pure self-knowing spirit and love who created\nhuman beings so that they, too, may become such pure spirit and love.\nWith the emergence of Christianity comes a new form of art:\nromantic art. Hegel uses the term \u201cromantic\u201d to\nrefer not to the art of the late 18th- and early 19th-century German\nRomantics (many of whom he knew personally), but to the whole tradition\nof art that emerged in Western Christendom.\n6.2.3 Romantic Art\n\n\nRomantic art, like classical art, is the sensuous expression or\nmanifestation of the freedom of spirit. It is thus capable of genuine\nbeauty. The freedom it manifests, however, is a profoundly\ninward freedom that finds its highest expression and\narticulation not in art itself but in religious faith and philosophy.\nUnlike classical art, therefore, romantic art gives expression to a\nfreedom of the spirit whose true home lies beyond art. If\nclassical art can be compared to the human body which is thoroughly\nsuffused with spirit and life, romantic art can be compared to the\nhuman face which discloses the spirit and personality within.\nSince romantic art actually discloses the inner spirit,\nhowever, rather than merely pointing to it, it differs from symbolic\nart which it otherwise resembles.\n\n\nRomantic art, for Hegel, takes three basic forms. The first is that of\nexplicitly religious art. It is in Christianity, Hegel\ncontends, that the true nature of spirit is revealed. What is\nrepresented in the story of Christ\u2019s life, death and resurrection\nis the idea that a truly divine life of freedom and love is at\nthe same time a fully human life in which we are willing to\n\u201cdie\u201d to ourselves and let go of what is most precious to\nus. Much religious romantic art, therefore, focuses on the suffering\nand death of Christ.\n\n\nHegel notes that it is not appropriate in romantic art to depict Christ\nwith the idealized body of a Greek god or hero, because what is central\nto Christ is his irreducible humanity and mortality. Romantic art,\ntherefore, breaks with the classical ideal of beauty and incorporates\nreal human frailty, pain and suffering into its images of Christ (and\nalso of religious martyrs). Indeed, such art can even go to the point\nof being \u201cugly\u201d (unsch\u00f6n) in its depiction of\nsuffering (PK\u00c4, 136).\n\n\nIf, however, romantic art is to fulfill the purpose of art and present\ntrue freedom of spirit in the form of beauty, it must show the\nsuffering Christ or suffering martyrs to be imbued with a profound\ninwardness (Innigkeit) of feeling and a genuine sense\nof reconciliation (Vers\u00f6hnung)\n(PK\u00c4, 136\u20137): for such an inward sense of\nreconciliation, in Hegel\u2019s view, is the deepest spiritual\nfreedom. The sensuous expression (in color or words) of this inner\nsense of reconciliation constitutes what Hegel calls the \u201cbeauty\nof inwardness\u201d or \u201cspiritual beauty\u201d (geistige\nSch\u00f6nheit) (PK\u00c4, 137). Strictly speaking,\nsuch spiritual beauty is not as consummately beautiful as\nclassical beauty, in which the spirit and the body are perfectly fused\nwith one another. Spiritual beauty, however, is the product of, and\nreveals, a much more profound inner freedom of spirit than\nclassical beauty and so moves and engages us much more readily than do\nthe relatively cold statues of Greek gods.\n\n\nThe most profound spiritual beauty in the visual arts is found, in\nHegel\u2019s view, in painted images of the Madonna and Child, for in these\nwhat is expressed is the feeling of boundless love.  Hegel\nhad a special affection for the paintings of the Flemish Primitives,\nJan van Eyck and Hans Memling, whose work he saw on his visits to\nGhent and Bruges in 1827 (Hegel: The Letters, 661\u20132),\nbut he also held Raphael in high regard and was particularly moved by\nthe expression of \u201cpious, modest mother-love\u201d in\nRaphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna which he saw in Dresden in 1820\n(PK\u00c4, 39; P\u00f6ggeler et al 1981, 142). Greek\nsculptors portrayed Niobe as simply \u201cpetrified in her\npain\u201d at the loss of her children. By contrast, the painted\nimages of the Virgin Mary are imbued by van Eyck and Raphael with an\n\u201ceternal love\u201d and a \u201csoulfulness\u201d that Greek\nstatues can never match (PK\u00c4, 142, 184).\n\n\nThe second fundamental form of romantic art identified by Hegel depicts\nwhat he calls the secular \u201cvirtues\u201d of the free spirit\n(Aesthetics, 1: 553; PK\u00c4, 135). These are not\nthe ethical virtues displayed by the heroes and heroines of\nGreek tragedy: they do not involve a commitment to the necessary\ninstitutions of freedom, such as the family or the state. Rather, they\nare the formal virtues of the romantic hero: that is to say,\nthey involve a commitment by the free individual, often grounded in contingent choice or passion, to an object or another person.\n\n\nSuch virtues include that of romantic love (which concentrates on a\nparticular, contingent person), loyalty towards an individual (that can\nchange if it is to one\u2019s advantage), and courage (which\nis often displayed in the pursuit of personal ends, such as rescuing a\ndamsel in distress, but can also be displayed in the pursuit of\nquasi-religious ends, such as the hunt for the Holy Grail)\n(PK\u00c4, 143\u20134).\n\n\nSuch virtues are found primarily in the world of mediaeval chivalry\n(and are subjected to ridicule, Hegel points out, in Cervantes\u2019\nDon Quixote) (Aesthetics, 1: 591\u20132;\nPK\u00c4, 150). They can, however, also crop up in more\nmodern works and, indeed, are precisely the virtues displayed in an\nart-form of which Hegel could know nothing, namely the American\nWestern.\n\n\nThe third fundamental form of romantic art depicts the formal freedom\nand independence of character. Such freedom is not associated with any\nethical principles or (at least not principally) with the formal virtues just\nmentioned, but consists simply in the \u201cfirmness\u201d\n(Festigkeit) of character (Aesthetics, 1: 577;\nPK\u00c4, 145\u20136). This is freedom in its modern, secular\nform. It is displayed most magnificently, Hegel believes, by\ncharacters, such as Richard III, Othello and Macbeth, in the plays of\nShakespeare. Note that what interests us about such individuals is not\nany moral purpose (which they invariably lack anyway), but simply the energy and\nself-determination (and often ruthlessness) that they exhibit. Such\ncharacters must have an internal richness (revealed through imagination\nand language) and not just be one-dimensional, but their main appeal is\ntheir formal freedom to commit themselves to a course of action, even\nat the cost of their own lives. These characters do not constitute\nmoral or political ideals, but they are the appropriate objects of\nmodern, romantic art whose task is to depict freedom even in its most\nsecular and amoral forms.\n\n\nHegel also sees romantic beauty in more inwardly sensitive characters,\nsuch as Shakespeare\u2019s Juliet. After meeting Romeo, Hegel remarks,\nJuliet suddenly opens up with love like a rosebud, full of childlike\nnaivety. Her beauty thus lies in being the embodiment of love. Hamlet\nis a somewhat similar character: far from being simply weak (as Goethe\nthought), Hamlet, in Hegel\u2019s view, displays the inner beauty of a\nprofoundly noble soul (Aesthetics, 1: 583; PK\u00c4,\n147\u20138).\n6.2.4 The \u201cEnd\u201d of Art\n\n\nOne should note that the development of romantic art, as Hegel\ndescribes it, involves the increasing secularization and humanization\nof art. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (as in ancient Greece)\nart was closely tied to religion: art\u2019s function was to a large\ndegree to make the divine visible. With the Reformation, however,\nreligion turned inward and found God to be present in faith\nalone, not in the icons and images of art. As a result, Hegel\npoints out, we who live after the Reformation \u201cno longer venerate\nworks of art\u201d (VPK, 6). Furthermore, art itself was\nreleased from its close ties to religion and allowed to become fully\nsecular. \u201cTo Protestantism alone,\u201d Hegel states, \u201cthe\nimportant thing is to get a sure footing in the prose of life, to make\nit absolutely valid in itself independently of religious associations,\nand to let it develop in unrestricted freedom\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 598).\n\n\nIt is for this reason, in Hegel\u2019s view, that art in the modern\nage no longer meets our highest needs and no longer affords us the\nsatisfaction that it gave to earlier cultures and civilizations. Art\nsatisfied our highest needs when it formed an integral part of\nour religious life and revealed to us the nature of the divine\n(and, as in Greece, the true character of our fundamental ethical\nobligations). In the modern, post-Reformation world, however, art has\nbeen released (or has emancipated itself) from subservience to\nreligion. As a result, \u201cart, considered in its highest vocation,\nis and remains for us a thing of the past\u201d (Aesthetics,\n1: 11).\n\n\nThis does not mean that art now has no role to play and that it\nprovides no satisfaction at all. Art is no longer the highest and most\nadequate way of expressing the truth (as it was, according to Hegel, in\nfifth-century Athens); we moderns now seek ultimate or\n\u201cabsolute\u201d truth in religious faith or in philosophy,\nrather than in art. (Indeed, the considerable importance we assign to\nphilosophy is evident, in Hegel\u2019s view, in the prominence of the\nphilosophical study of art itself in modernity [Aesthetics, 1:\n11; VPK, 6].) Yet art in modernity continues to perform the\nsignificant function of giving visible and audible expression to our\ndistinctively human freedom and to our understanding of ourselves in\nall our finite humanity.\n\n\nHegel does not claim, therefore, that art as a whole simply comes to an\nend or \u201cdies\u201d in the modern age. His view is, rather, that\nart plays (or at least should play) a more limited role now\nthan it did in ancient Greece or in the Middle Ages. Yet Hegel does\nthink that art in modernity comes to an end in a certain\nrespect. To understand why he thinks this, we need to consider his\nclaim that art in modernity \u201cfalls apart\u201d\n(zerf\u00e4llt) into the exploration of everyday\ncontingencies, on the one hand, and the celebration of witty,\n\u201chumorous\u201d subjectivity, on the other (PK\u00c4,\n151).\n\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s view, much painting and poetry after the Reformation\nfocuses its attention on the prosaic details of ordinary daily life,\nrather than on the intimacy of religious love or the magnificent\nresolve and energy of tragic heroes. To the extent that such works of\nart no longer aim to give expression to divine or human freedom but\nseek (apparently at least) to do no more than \u201cimitate\nnature,\u201d they prompt Hegel to consider whether they still count\nas \u201cart works\u201d in the strictly philosophical (as opposed to\nthe more generally accepted) sense of the term. In the twentieth\ncentury it is the abstract creations of, for example, Jackson Pollock\nor Carl Andr\u00e9 that usually provoke the question: \u201cis this\nart?\u201d. In Hegel\u2019s mind, however, it is works that appear to\nbe purely naturalistic and \u201crepresentational\u201d that raise\nthis question. His view is that such works count as genuine works of\nart only when they do more than merely imitate nature. The\nnaturalistic and prosaic works that best meet this criterion, he\nmaintains, are the paintings of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nDutch masters.\n\n\nIn such works, Hegel claims, the painter does not aim simply to show us\nwhat grapes, flowers or trees look like: we know that already\nfrom nature. The painter aims, rather, to capture the\u2014often\nfleeting\u2014\u201clife\u201d (Lebendigkeit) of things:\n\u201cthe lustre of metal, the shimmer of a bunch of grapes by\ncandlelight, a vanishing glimpse of the moon or the sun, a smile, the\nexpression of a swiftly passing emotion\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n599). Often, indeed, the painter seeks to delight us specifically with\nthe animated play of the colors of gold, silver, velvet or fur. In such\nworks, Hegel notes, we encounter not just the depiction of things, but\n\u201cas it were, an objective music, a peal in colour [ein\nT\u00f6nen in Farben]\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n598\u2013600).\n\n\n A\ngenuine work of art is the sensuous expression of divine or human\nfreedom and life. Paintings that are no more than prosaic, naturalistic\ndepictions of everyday objects or human activity would thus appear to\nfall short of genuine art. Dutch artists, however, turn such depictions\ninto true works of art precisely by imbuing objects with \u201cthe\nfullness of life.\u201d In so doing, Hegel claims, they give expression\nto their own sense of freedom, \u201ccomfort\u201d and\n\u201ccontentment\u201d and their own exuberant subjective skill\n(Aesthetics, 1: 599; PK\u00c4, 152). The paintings\nof such artists may lack the classical beauty of Greek art, but they\nexhibit magnificently the subtle beauties and delights of everyday\nmodern life. \n\n\nA much more overt expression of subjectivity is found by Hegel in\nworks of modern humor. Such witty, ironic, humorous\nsubjectivity\u2014one we might now describe as\n\u201canarchic\u201d\u2014manifests itself in playing or\n\u201csporting\u201d with objects, \u201cderanging\u201d and\n\u201cperverting\u201d material and \u201crambling to and\nfro,\u201d and in the \u201ccriss-cross movement of subjective\nexpressions, views, and attitudes whereby the author sacrifices\nhimself and his topics alike\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n601). Hegel claims that works of \u201ctrue humour,\u201d\nsuch as Laurence Sterne\u2019s\nTristram Shandy (1759), succeed in making \u201cwhat is\nsubstantial emerge out of contingency.\u201d Their \u201ctriviality\n[thus] affords precisely the supreme idea of depth\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 602). In other works, by contrast\u2014such\nas those of Hegel\u2019s contemporary, Jean Paul Richter\u2014all\nwe encounter is the \u201cbaroque mustering of things objectively\nfurthest removed from one another\u201d and \u201cthe most confused\ndisorderly jumbling of topics related only in his own subjective\nimagination\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 601). In such works, we do\nnot see human freedom giving itself objective expression, but rather\nwitness subjectivity \u201cdestroying and dissolving everything that\nproposes to make itself objective and win a firm shape for itself in\nreality\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 601).\n\n\nTo the extent that works of humor do not give body to true\nself-determining freedom and life\u2014or afford \u201cthe supreme\nidea of depth\u201d\u2014but merely manifest the power of\narbitrary, subjective wit to subvert the settled order, such works, in\nHegel\u2019s view, no longer count as genuine works of art.\nConsequently, \u201cwhen the subject lets itself go in this way, art\nthereby comes to an end [so h\u00f6rt damit die Kunst\nauf]\u201d (PK\u00c4, 153). In this respect, Hegel\ndoes after all proclaim that art comes to an end in modernity. This is\nnot because art no longer performs a religious function and so no\nlonger fulfills the highest vocation of art; it is because there emerge\nin modernity certain \u201cart works\u201d that are no longer the\nexpressions of true human freedom and life and so no longer genuine\nart works at all.\n\n\nAs was noted above, however, this does not mean that art as a\nwhole comes to an end in the early nineteenth century. Art, in\nHegel\u2019s view, still has a future: \u201cwe may well hope,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cthat art will always rise higher and come to\nperfection\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 103). For Hegel, the\ndistinctive character of genuine art in contemporary\n(and future) modernity\u2014and thus of genuinely modern art\u2014is\ntwofold. On the one hand, it remains bound to give expression to\nconcrete human life and freedom; on the other hand, it is no longer\nrestricted to any of the three art-forms. That is to say, it does not\nhave to observe the proprieties of classical art or explore the\nintense emotional inwardness or heroic freedom or comfortable\nordinariness that we find in romantic art.  Modern art, for Hegel, can\ndraw on features of any of the art-forms (including symbolic art) in\nits presentation of human life. Indeed, it can also present human life\nand freedom indirectly through the depiction of nature.\n\n\nThe focus of modern art, therefore, does not have to be on one\nparticular conception of human freedom rather than another. The new\n\u201choly of holies\u201d in art is humanity itself\u2014\n\u201cHumanus\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe depths and\nheights of the human heart as such, mankind in its joys and sorrows,\nits strivings, deeds, and fates\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 607).\nModern art, in Hegel\u2019s view, thus enjoys an unprecedented freedom to\nexplore \u201cthe infinity of the human heart\u201d in manifold ways\n(V\u00c4, 181). For this reason, there is little that Hegel\ncan say about the path that art should take in the future; that is for\nartists to decide.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s judgment that modern artists are\u2014and are quite\nrightly\u2014free to adopt whatever style they please has surely\nbeen confirmed by the history of art since Hegel\u2019s death in 1831.\nThere is reason to suspect, however, that Hegel might not have welcomed\nmany of the developments in post-Hegelian art. This is due to the fact\nthat, although he does not lay down any rules that are to govern modern\nart, he does identify certain conditions that should be met if modern\nart is to be genuine art. Hegel notes, for example, that such art\nshould \u201cnot contradict the formal law of being simply beautiful\nand capable of artistic treatment\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 605;\nVPK, 204). He insists that modern artists should draw their\ncontent from their own human spirit and that \u201cnothing that can be\nliving [lebendig] in the human breast is alien to\nthat spirit.\u201d He also remarks that modern art may represent\n\u201ceverything in which the human being as such is capable of being\nat home [heimisch]\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n607). These may appear to be fairly innocuous conditions, but they\nsuggest that certain post-Hegelian art works would not count in\nHegel\u2019s eyes as genuine works of art. These might include works\nthat by no stretch of the imagination can be called\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d (such as some of the paintings of Willem De\nKooning or Francis Bacon), or works in which it is evidently hard to\nfeel very much \u201cat home\u201d (such as the writings of Franz\nKafka). Hegel\u2019s account of the different arts (such as sculpture\nand painting) also suggests that he would not have regarded the move\nfrom figurative to abstract visual art as appropriate: Netherlandish\nand Dutch painters excelled in the creating of \u201cobjective\nmusic\u201d through the play of colors, yet they did so not in the\nabstract but in the very depiction of concrete, identifiable objects.\n(Robert Pippin takes a different view on this last point; see Pippin\n2007.)\n\n\nFrom a twentieth- or twenty-first-century point of view, Hegel\u2019s\nstance may well look conservative. From his point of view, however, he\nwas trying to understand what conditions would have to be met for works\nof art to be genuine works of art and genuinely modern. The\nconditions that Hegel identified\u2014namely that art should present\nthe richness of human freedom and life and should allow us to feel at\nhome in its depictions\u2014are ones that many modern artists (for\nexample, Impressionists such as Monet, Sisley and Pissarro) have felt\nno trouble in meeting. For others, these conditions are simply too\nrestrictive. They have thus taken modern art in a direction in which,\nfrom a Hegelian perspective, it has ceased to be art in the\ntrue sense any longer.\n6.3 The System of the Individual Arts\n\n\nArt, in Hegel\u2019s account, not only undergoes a historical\ndevelopment (from symbolic art through classical art to romantic and\nthen modern art), but also differentiates itself into different arts.\nEach art has a distinctive character and exhibits a certain affinity\nwith one or more of the art-forms. Hegel does not provide an exhaustive\naccount of all recognized arts (he says little, for example, about\ndance and nothing, obviously, about cinema), but he examines the five\narts that he thinks are made necessary by the very concept of art\nitself.\n6.3.1 Architecture\n\n\nArt, we recall, is the sensuous expression of divine and human\nfreedom. If it is to demonstrate that spirit is indeed free, it must\nshow that spirit is free in relation to that which is itself unfree,\nspiritless and lifeless\u2014that is, three-dimensional, inorganic\nmatter, weighed down by gravity. Art must, therefore, be the\ntransformation of such brute, heavy matter into the expression of\nspiritual freedom, or what Hegel calls \u201cthe forming of the\ninorganic\u201d (VPK, 209). The art that gives heavy\nmatter the explicit form of spiritual freedom\u2014and so works\nstone and metal into the shape of a human being or a god\u2014is\nsculpture. Architecture, by contrast, gives matter an abstract,\ninorganic form created by human understanding. It does not\nanimate matter in the manner of sculpture but invests matter with\nstrict regularity, symmetry and harmony (PK\u00c4, 155,\n166). In so doing architecture turns matter not into the direct\nsensuous expression of spiritual freedom, but into an artificially and\nartfully shaped surrounding for the direct expression of\nspiritual freedom in sculpture. The art of architecture fulfills its\npurpose, therefore, when it creates classical temples to house statues\nof the gods (VPK, 221).\n\n\nHegel points out, however, that prior to the emergence of classical\narchitecture in ancient Greece, architecture took the more primitive\nform of \u201cindependent\u201d (selbst\u00e4ndig) or\n\u201csymbolic\u201d architecture (Aesthetics, 2: 635;\nPK\u00c4, 159). The constructions that fall into this\ncategory do not house or surround individual sculptures, like classical\nGreek temples, but are themselves partly sculptural and partly\narchitectural. They are works of architectural sculpture or sculptural\narchitecture. Such constructions are sculptural in so far as they are\nbuilt for their own sake and do not serve to shelter or enclose\nsomething else. They are works of architecture, however, in so far as\nthey are overtly heavy and massive and lack the animation of sculpture.\nThey are also sometimes arranged in rows, like columns, with no\ndistinctive individuality.\n\n\nSome of these works of independent architecture have regular inorganic,\ngeometrical shapes (such as the temple of Bel described by Herodotus)\n(see Herodotus, 79\u201380 [1: 181]); some are clearly embodiments of\nthe organic \u201cforce of life in nature\u201d (such as the phallus\nand the lingam) (Aesthetics, 2: 641); and some even have a\nhuman form, albeit one that is abstract and colossal (such as the\nEgyptian Memnons of Amenhotep III). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, all\nsuch constructions have a symbolic significance for those who built\nthem. They were not built simply to provide shelter or security for\npeople (like a house or a castle), but are works of symbolic art.\n\n\nThese \u201cindependent\u201d constructions are meaningful in\nthemselves: their meaning lies, for example, in their shape or in the\nnumber of their parts. By contrast, the Egyptian pyramids contain a\n\u201cmeaning\u201d that is separate from the construction\nitself. That \u201cmeaning,\u201d of course, is the body of the dead\npharaoh. Since they house within themselves something other than\nthemselves, pyramids, in Hegel\u2019s view, are, as it were, on the\nway to being properly architectural. They fall short of proper\nclassical architecture, however, because what they shelter within\nthemselves is death, not the embodiment of the living god: they are, as\nHegel puts it, \u201ccrystals that shelter within them a departed\nspirit\u201d (VPK, 218). Furthermore, the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d that they contain is completely hidden within\nthem, invisible to all. Pyramids thus remain works of symbolic\nart that point to a hidden meaning buried within them. Indeed, as was\nnoted above, Hegel claims that the pyramid is the image or symbol of\nsymbolic art itself (Aesthetics, 1: 356).\n\n\nThe epitome of symbolic art is symbolic architecture (specifically, the\npyramids). Architecture itself, however, comes into its own only with\nthe emergence of classical art: for it is only in the classical period\nthat architecture provides the surrounding for, and so becomes the\nservant of, a sculpture that is itself the embodiment of free\nspirit.\n\n\nHegel has much to say about the proper form of such a surrounding. The\nmain point is this: spiritual freedom is embodied in the sculpture of\nthe god; the house of the god\u2014the temple\u2014is something\nquite distinct from, and subordinate to, the sculpture it surrounds;\nthe form of that temple should thus also be quite distinct from that of\nthe sculpture. The temple, therefore, should not mimic the flowing\ncontours of the human body, but should be governed by the abstract\nprinciples of regularity, symmetry and harmony.\n\n\nHegel also insists that the form of the temple should be determined by\nthe purpose it serves: namely to provide an enclosure and\nprotection for the god (VPK, 221). This means that the\nbasic shape of the temple should contain only those features that are\nneeded to fulfill its purpose. Furthermore, it means (in Hegel\u2019s\nview) that each part of the temple should perform a specific\nfunction within the economy of the whole building and that different\nfunctions should not be confused with one another. It is this latter\nrequirement that makes columns necessary. There is a\ndifference, for Hegel, between the task of bearing the roof and that of\nenclosing the statue within a given space. The second task\u2014that\nof enclosure\u2014is performed by a wall. If the first task is to be\nclearly distinguished from the second, therefore, it must be performed\nnot by a wall but by a separate feature of the temple. Columns are\nnecessary in a classical temple, according to Hegel, because they\nperform the distinct task of bearing the roof without forming\na wall. The classical temple is thus the most intelligible of\nbuildings because different functions are carried out in this way by\ndifferent architectural features and yet are harmonized with one\nanother. Herein, indeed, lies the beauty of such a temple\n(VPK, 221, 224).\n\n\nIn contrast to classical architecture, romantic or \u201cGothic\u201d\narchitecture is based on the idea of a closed house in which Christian\ninwardness can find refuge from the outside world. In the Gothic\ncathedral columns are located within, rather than around the outside\nof, the enclosed space, and their overt function is no longer merely to\nbear weight but to draw the soul up into the heavens. Consequently, the\ncolumns or pillars do not come to a definite end (in a capital on which\nrests the architrave of the classical temple), but continue up until\nthey meet to form a pointed arch or a vaulted roof. In this way, the\nGothic cathedral not only shelters the spirit of the religious\ncommunity, but also symbolizes the upward movement of that spirit in\nits very structure (PK\u00c4, 170\u20131).\n\n\nHegel considers a relatively small range of buildings: he says almost\nnothing, for example, about secular buildings. One should bear in mind,\nhowever, that he is interested in architecture only in so far as it is\nan art, not in so far as it provides us with protection and security in\nour everyday lives. Yet it should also be noted that architecture, as\nHegel describes it, falls short of genuine art, as he defines it, since\nit is never the direct sensuous expression of spiritual freedom itself\n(in the manner of sculpture) (see Aesthetics, 2: 888). This is\na fundamental limitation of architecture: the structures of\n\u201cindependent architecture\u201d symbolize meanings that are more\nor less indeterminate; the pyramids indicate the presence of a hidden\nmeaning, namely death; and even in its classical and romantic forms\narchitecture remains a \u201csymbolic\u201d art, in so far as the\nstructures it creates remain separate from the spirit they house\n(Aesthetics, 2: 888). In no case is architecture the explicit\nmanifestation or embodiment of free spirituality itself. This does not,\nhowever, make architecture any less necessary as a part of our\naesthetic and religious life. Nor does it prevent Hegel from seeking to\nunderstand what distinguishes the \u201cart\u201d of architecture (as\nopposed to the more everyday practice or business of architecture) in\nboth the classical and romantic eras.\n6.3.2 Sculpture\n\n\nIn contrast to architecture, sculpture works heavy matter into the\nconcrete expression of spiritual freedom by giving it the shape of the\nhuman being. The high point of sculpture, for Hegel, was\nachieved in classical Greece. In Egyptian sculpture the figures often\nstand firm with one foot placed before the other and the arms held\ntightly by the side of the body, giving the figures a rather rigid,\nlifeless appearance. By contrast, the idealized statues of the gods\ncreated by Greek sculptors, such as Phidias and Praxiteles, are clearly\nalive and animated, even when the gods are depicted at rest. This\nanimation is apparent in the posture of the figure, in the nuanced\ncontours of the body and also in the free fall of the figure\u2019s\ngarments. Hegel greatly admired the sculpture of Michelangelo\u2014a\ncast of whose Piet\u00e0 he saw in Berlin\n(Aesthetics, 2: 790)\u2014but it was the Greeks, in his\nview, who set the standard for \u201cideal\u201d sculptural beauty.\nIndeed, Greek sculpture, according to Hegel, embodies the purest\nbeauty of which art itself is capable. (For a more detailed study\nof Hegel\u2019s account of sculpture, see Houlgate 2007, \n56\u201389).\n6.3.3 Painting\n\n\nHegel was well aware that Greek statues were often painted in quite\na gaudy manner. He claims, however, that sculpture expresses spiritual\nfreedom and vitality in the three-dimensional shape of the\nfigure, rather than in the color that has been applied to it. In\npainting, by contrast, it is color above all that is the medium of\nexpression. The point of painting, for Hegel, is not to show us what it\nis for free spirit to be fully embodied. It is to show us only\nwhat free spirit looks like, how it manifests itself\nto the eye. The images of painting thus lack the three-dimensionality\nof sculpture, but they add the detail and specificity provided by\ncolor.\n\n\nHegel acknowledges that painting reached a degree of perfection in the\nclassical world, but he maintains that it is best suited to the\nexpression of romantic, Christian spirituality (and the secular freedom\nof post-Reformation modernity) (PK\u00c4, 181). This is\nbecause the absence of bodily solidity and the presence of color allow\nthe more inward spirituality of the Christian world to\nmanifest itself as such. If sculpture is the material embodiment of\nspirit, painting gives us, as it were, the face of spirit in which the\nsoul within manifests itself as the soul within\n(PK\u00c4, 183).\n\n\nPainting, however, is also able\u2014unlike sculpture\u2014to set\ndivine and human spirit in relation to its external environment: it is\nable to include within the painted image itself the natural landscape\nand the architecture by which Christ, the Virgin Mary, the saints or\nsecular figures are surrounded (Aesthetics, 2: 854). Indeed,\nHegel argues that painting\u2014in contrast to sculpture, which\nexcels in presenting independent, free-standing individuals\u2014is\naltogether more suited to showing human beings in their\nrelations both to their environment and to one another: hence\nthe prominence in painting of, for example, depictions of the love\nbetween the Virgin Mary and the Christ child.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of painting is extraordinarily rich and\nwide-ranging. He has particular praise for Raphael, Titian and the\nDutch masters and, as noted earlier, is especially interested in the\nways in which painters can combine colors to create what he calls\n\u201cobjective music\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 599\u2013600). It\nshould be noted, however, that Hegel sees the abstract play of colors\nas an integral part of the depiction of free human beings and does not\nsuggest that painting should ever become purely abstract and\n\u201cmusical\u201d (as it did in the twentieth century).\n6.3.4 Music\n\n\nThe next art in Hegel\u2019s \u201csystem of the individual\narts\u201d is music itself. It, too, comes into its own in the period\nof romantic art. Like sculpture and painting, but unlike architecture,\nmusic gives direct expression to free subjectivity. Yet music goes even\nfurther in the direction of expressing the inwardness of\nsubjectivity by dropping the dimensions of space altogether. It thus\ngives no enduring visual expression to such subjectivity, but\nexpresses the latter in the organized succession of vanishing sounds.\nMusic, for Hegel, originates in the immediate uttering of feeling or\nwhat he calls \u201cinterjection\u201d\u2014\u201cthe Ah\nand Oh of the heart\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 903). Yet music is\nmore than just a cry of pain or a sigh; it is an organized, developed,\n\u201ccadenced\u201d interjection. Music is thus not just a sequence\nof sounds for its own sake, but is the structured expression in sounds\nof inner subjectivity. Through rhythm, harmony and melody music allows\nthe soul to hear its own inner movement and to be moved in turn by what\nit hears. It is \u201cspirit, soul which resounds immediately for\nitself and feels satisfied in hearing itself [in ihrem\nSichvernehmen]\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 939, translation\naltered).\n\n\nMusic expresses, and allows us to hear and enjoy, the movement of the\nsoul in time through difference and dissonance back into its unity with\nitself. It also expresses, and moves us to, various different\nfeelings, such as love, longing and joy (Aesthetics,\n2: 940). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, the purpose of music is not\nonly to arouse feelings in us, but\u2014as in all genuine art\n\u2014to enable us to enjoy a sense of reconciliation and\nsatisfaction in what we encounter. This, Hegel contends, is the secret\nof truly \u201cideal\u201d music, the music of Palestrina, Gluck,\nHaydn and Mozart: even in the deepest grief \u201ctranquillity of soul\nis never missing [ \u2026 ]; grief is expressed there, too, but it is\nassuaged at once; [ \u2026] everything is kept firmly together in a\nrestrained form so that jubilation does not degenerate into a repulsive\nuproar, and even a lament gives us the most blissful\ntranquillity\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 939).\n\n\n Hegel notes that music is able to express feelings with especial\nclarity when it is accompanied by a poetic text, and he had a\nparticular love of both church music and opera. Interestingly, however,\nhe argues that in such cases it is really the text that serves the\nmusic, rather than the other way around, for it is the music above all\nthat expresses the profound movements of the soul (Aesthetics,\n2: 934). Yet music does not have to be accompanied by a text; it can\nalso be \u201cindependent\u201d instrumental music. Such music also\nfulfills the aim of art by expressing the movements of the soul and\nmoving the soul in turn to \u201cemotions in sympathy with it\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 894). Over and above this expression, however,\nindependent music pursues the purely formal development of themes and\nharmonies for its own sake. This, in Hegel\u2019s view, is a perfectly\nappropriate, indeed necessary, thing for music to do. The danger he\nsees, however, is that such formal development can become completely\ndetached from the musical expression of inward feeling and subjectivity, and\nthat, as a result, music can cease being a genuine art and become mere\nartistry. Music, as it were, loses its soul and becomes nothing but\n\u201cskill and virtuosity in compilation\u201d (Aesthetics,\n2: 906). At this point, music no longer moves us to feel\nanything, but simply engages our abstract understanding. It thereby\nbecomes the province of the \u201cconnoisseur\u201d and leaves the\nlayman\u2014who \u201clikes most in music [ \u2026 ] the\nintelligible expression of feelings and ideas\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 953)\u2014behind.\n\n\nHegel admits that he is not as well versed in music as he is in the\nother arts he discusses. He has a deep appreciation, however, for the\nmusic of J.S. Bach, Handel and Mozart and his analyses of musical\nrhythm, harmony and melody are highly illuminating. He was familiar\nwith, though critical of, the music of his contemporary Carl Maria von\nWeber, and he had a particular affection for Rossini\n(Aesthetics, 1: 159, 2: 949). Surprisingly, he never makes any\nmention of Beethoven.\n6.3.5 Poetry\n\n\nThe last art that Hegel considers is also an art of sound, but sound\nunderstood as the sign of ideas and inner representations\u2014sound\nas speech. This is the art of poetry (Poesie) in the\nbroad sense of the term. Hegel regards poetry as the \u201cmost\nperfect art\u201d (PK\u00c4, 197), because it provides the\nrichest and most concrete expression of spiritual freedom (in\ncontrast to sculpture which, in its classical form, gives us the\npurest ideal beauty). Poetry is capable of showing spiritual\nfreedom both as concentrated inwardness and as action in space\nand time. It is equally at home in symbolic, classical and romantic art\nand, in this sense, is the \u201cmost unrestricted of the arts\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 626).\n\n\nPoetry, for Hegel, is not simply the structured presentation of ideas,\nbut the articulation of ideas in language, indeed in spoken\n(rather than just written) language. An important aspect of the art of\npoetry\u2014and what clearly marks it off from prose\u2014is thus\nthe musical ordering of words themselves or\n\u201cversification.\u201d In this respect, Hegel claims, there are\nimportant differences between classical and romantic art: the ancients\nplace more emphasis on rhythmic structure in their verse, whereas in\nChristendom (especially in France and Italy) greater use is made of\nrhyme (PK\u00c4, 201\u20134).\n\n\nThe three basic forms of poetry identified by Hegel are epic, lyric and\ndramatic poetry.\n6.3.5.1 Epic and Lyric poetry\n\n\nEpic poetry presents spiritual freedom\u2014that is, free human\nbeings\u2014in the context of a world of circumstances and events.\n\u201cIn the epic,\u201d Hegel states, \u201cindividuals act and\nfeel; but their actions are not independent, events [also] have their\nright.\u201d What is described in such poetry, therefore, is \u201ca\nplay between actions and events\u201d (PK\u00c4, 208).\nEpic individuals are situated individuals, caught up in a larger\nenterprise (such as the Trojan War in Homer\u2019s Iliad).\nWhat they do is thus determined as much by the situation in which they\nfind themselves as by their own will, and the consequences of their\nactions are to a large degree at the mercy of circumstances. Epic\npoetry thus shows us the worldly character\u2014and\nattendant limitations\u2014of human freedom. (In this respect, Hegel\nnotes, Alexander the Great would not have made a good subject for epic\npoetry, because \u201chis world was his army\u201d\u2014\nhis creation under his control\u2014and so was not\ntruly independent of his will [PK\u00c4, 213].)\n\n\nAmong the great epic poems Hegel discusses are Homer\u2019s\nOdyssey, Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy and the\nmediaeval Spanish poem El Cid. Much of what he has to say\nabout the epic, however, is based on his reading of Homer\u2019s\nIliad. In the modern period, Hegel maintains, the epic gives\nway to the novel (PK\u00c4, 207, 217).\n\n\nIn contrast to the epic hero, the subject of lyric poetry does not\nundertake tasks, journeys or adventures in the world but simply gives\nexpression\u2014in hymns, odes or songs\u2014to the self\u2019s\nideas and inner feelings. This can be done directly or via the poetic\ndescription of something else, such as a rose, wine, or another person.\nAs always, Hegel\u2019s remarks about lyric poetry bear witness to his\nextraordinary erudition and to his critical acumen. He lavishes\nparticular praise on Goethe\u2019s West-Eastern Divan (1819)\nbut criticizes the eighteenth-century poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock\nfor wanting to create a new \u201cpoetic mythology\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1154\u20137; PK\u00c4, 218).\n6.3.5.2 Dramatic Poetry\n\n\nDramatic poetry combines the principles of epic and lyric poetry. It\nshows characters acting in the world\u2014in a given situation\n\u2014but their actions issue directly from their own inner\nwill (rather than being co-determined by events beyond the\nagent\u2019s control). Drama thus presents the\u2014all too often\nself-destructive\u2014consequences of free human action\nitself.\n\n\nDrama, for Hegel, is the \u201chighest\u201d and most concrete art\n(PK\u00c4, 205)\u2014the art in which human beings\nthemselves are the medium of aesthetic expression. (Seeing a play\nperformed by actors, as opposed to hearing it read aloud or reading it\nfor oneself, is thus central, in Hegel\u2019s view, to the experience of\ndrama [Aesthetics, 2: 1182\u20135; PK\u00c4,\n223\u20134].) Drama, indeed, is the art in which all the other arts\nare contained (virtually or actually): \u201cthe human being is the\nliving statue, architecture is represented by painting or there is\nreal architecture,\u201d and\u2014in particular in Greek\ndrama\u2014there is \u201cmusic, dance and pantomime\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 223). At this point, it is tempting to say that,\nfor Hegel, drama\u2014to use Richard Wagner\u2019s expression\u2014is the\n\u201ctotal work of art\u201d (Gesamtkunstwerk). It is\ndoubtful, however, whether Hegel would have been sympathetic to\nWagner\u2019s project. Hegel remarks that drama takes the explicit form of\na \u201ctotality\u201d in opera, which belongs more to the\nsphere of music than to drama proper (PK\u00c4, 223). (He has\nin mind in particular the operas of Gluck and Mozart.) In drama as\nsuch, by contrast, language is what predominates and music plays\na subordinate role and may even be present only in the virtual form of\nversification. The Wagnerian idea of a \u201cmusic drama\u201d that\nis neither a straightforward opera nor a simple drama would thus\nappear, from Hegel\u2019s point of view, to confuse two distinct arts.\n\n\nDrama, for Hegel, does not depict the richness of the epic world or\nexplore the inner world of lyric feeling. It shows characters acting in\npursuit of their own will and interest and thereby coming into\nconflict with other individuals (even if, as in the case of Hamlet,\nafter some initial hesitation). Hegel distinguishes between tragic and\ncomic drama and between classical and romantic versions of each. (He\nalso notes that in some plays, such as Goethe\u2019s Iphigenie auf\nTauris, tragedy threatens but is averted by acts of trust or\nforgiveness [Aesthetics, 2: 1204].)\n\n\nIn classical Greek tragedy individuals are moved to act by an\nethical interest or \u201cpathos,\u201d such as concern for\nthe family or for the state. The conflict between Antigone and Creon in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone is of this kind, as is the conflict\nacted out in Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia. In Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus the King the conflict is not a straightforwardly\nethical one, but it is nonetheless a conflict between two\n\u201crights\u201d: the right of consciousness to accept\nresponsibility only for what it knows it has done, and the right of the\n\u201cunconscious\u201d\u2014of what we do not know\u2014to be\naccorded respect. The tragedy of Oedipus is that he pursues his right\nto uncover the truth about the murder of Laius without ever considering\nthat he himself might be responsible for the murder or, indeed, that\nthere might be anything about him of which he is unaware\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1213\u201314).\n\n\nGreek tragic heroes and heroines are moved to act by the ethical (or\notherwise justified) interest with which they identify, but they act\nfreely in pursuit of that interest. Tragedy shows how such\nfree action leads to conflict and then to the violent (or sometimes\npeaceful) resolution of that conflict. At the close of the drama, Hegel\nmaintains, we are shattered by the fate of the characters (at least\nwhen the resolution is violent). We are also satisfied by the outcome,\nbecause we see that justice has been done. Individuals, whose\ninterests\u2014such as the family and the state\u2014should be in\nharmony with one another, set those interests in opposition to one\nanother; in so doing, however, they destroy themselves and thereby undo\nthe very opposition they set up. In the self-destruction of such\n\u201cone-sidedly\u201d ethical characters, Hegel believes, we, the\naudience, see the work of \u201ceternal justice\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1198, 1215). This reconciles us to\nthe fate of the characters and so provides the sense of\n\u201creconciliation which art should never lack\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 2: 1173).\n\n\nIn modern tragedy\u2014by which Hegel means above all Shakespearean\ntragedy\u2014characters are moved not by an ethical interest, but by\na subjective passion, such as ambition or jealousy. These characters,\nhowever, still act freely and destroy themselves through the free\npursuit of their passion. Tragic individuals, therefore\u2014whether\nancient or modern\u2014are not brought down by fate but are\nultimately responsible for their own demise. Indeed, Hegel maintains,\n\u201cinnocent suffering is not the object of high art\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 231\u20132). Drama that sees people primarily as\nvictims of circumstance or oppression (such as Georg\nB\u00fcchner\u2019s Woyzeck [1836]) is thus, from a Hegelian point\nof view, drama without genuine tragedy.\n\n\nIn comedy individuals also undermine their own endeavors in some way,\nbut the purposes that animate them are either inherently trivial ones\nor grand ones which they pursue in a laughably inappropriate way. In\ncontrast to tragic characters, truly comic figures do not identify\nthemselves seriously with their laughable ends or means. They can thus\nsurvive the frustration of their purposes, and often come to laugh at\nthemselves, in a way that tragic figures cannot. In this respect, Hegel\nclaims, characters in many modern comedies, such as those by\nMoli\u00e8re, are frequently ridiculous, but not genuinely\ncomic, characters: we laugh at Moli\u00e8re\u2019s\nmiser or Shakespeare\u2019s Malvolio, but they do not laugh\nwith us at their own foibles. Truly comic figures are found\nby Hegel in the plays of the ancient Greek dramatist\nAristophanes. What we encounter in such plays, Hegel maintains, is\n\u201can infinite light-heartedness and confidence felt by someone\nraised altogether above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or\nmiserable in it at all: this is the bliss and ease of a man who, being\nsure of himself, can bear the frustration of his aims and\nachievements\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 1200). Modern equivalents\nof such Aristophanic light-heartedness may be found in\nVerdi\u2019s Falstaff (1893) and in the unrivalled comic genius of\nHomer Simpson, both of which, of course, were unknown to Hegel. \n\n\nComedy, in Hegel\u2019s view, marks the \u201cdissolution of\nart\u201d (Aesthetics, 2: 1236). Yet the way in which comedy\n\u201cdissolves\u201d art differs from the way in which modern ironic\nhumor does so. Ironic humor\u2014at least of the kind found in the\nwork of Jean Paul Richter\u2014is the expression of the \u201cpower\nof subjective notions, flashes of thought\u201d to \u201cdestroy and\ndissolve everything that proposes to make itself objective\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 601). It is the expression of the unchallenged\nmastery of wit. Since Hegel does not regard such arbitrary mastery as\ngenuine freedom, he argues that works of ironic humor in which this\nmastery is exhibited no longer count as genuine works of art. True\ncomedy, by contrast, is the expression of a sense of wholeness,\nself-confidence and well-being\u2014of subjective freedom and life\n\u2014that survives the loss of mastery and control over\none\u2019s life. Plays that express such freedom count as genuine\nworks of art. Yet they are works that show freedom to reside precisely\nnot in the works we undertake but within subjectivity\nitself, within subjectivity that happily endures the frustration of its\nlaughable aims.\n\n\nAccording to Hegel, the idea that true freedom is to be found in inner\nspirituality that is prepared to let go of, or to \u201cdie to,\u201d\nits own selfish purposes lies at the heart of religion,\nspecifically of Christianity. True comedy, therefore, implicitly points\nbeyond art to religion. It is in this way\u2014and not by\nceasing to be art\u2014that comedy \u201cdissolves\u201d art.\n\n\nComedy thus takes art to its limit: beyond comedy there is no further\naesthetic manifestation of freedom, there is only religion\n(and philosophy). Religion, in Hegel\u2019s view, does not make the\naesthetic expression of freedom redundant; indeed, it is often the\nsource of the greatest art. Yet religion provides a more profound\nunderstanding of freedom than art, just as philosophy provides a\nclearer and more profound understanding of freedom than religion.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nHegel\u2019s aesthetics has been the focus of\u2014often highly\ncritical\u2014attention since his death from philosophers such as\nHeidegger, Adorno and Gadamer. Much of this attention has been devoted\nto his supposed theory of the \u201cend\u201d of art. Perhaps\nHegel\u2019s most important legacy, however, lies in the claims that\nart\u2019s task is the presentation of beauty and that beauty is a\nmatter of content as well as form. Beauty, for Hegel, is not just a\nmatter of formal harmony or elegance; it is the sensuous manifestation\nin stone, color, sound or words of spiritual freedom and life.\nSuch beauty takes a subtly different form in the classical and romantic\nperiods and also in the different individual arts. In one form or\nanother, however, it remains the purpose of art, even in\nmodernity.\n\n\nThese claims by Hegel are normative, not just descriptive, and impose\ncertain restrictions on what can count as genuine art in the modern\nage. They are not, however, claims made out of simple conservatism.\nHegel is well aware that art can be decorative, can promote moral and\npolitical goals, can explore the depths of human alienation or simply\nrecord the prosaic details of everyday life, and that it can do so with\nconsiderable artistry. His concern, however, is that art that does\nthese things without giving us beauty fails to afford us the\naesthetic experience of freedom. In so doing, it deprives us\nof a central dimension of a truly human life.\n",
