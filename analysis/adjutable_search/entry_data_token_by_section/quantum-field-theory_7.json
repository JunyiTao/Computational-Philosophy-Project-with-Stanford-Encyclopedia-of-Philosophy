    "main_text": "Beyond the Standard Model || String Theory\n3.2 String Theory\n\n\nString theory is one of the most promising candidates for bridging\nthe gap between QFT and general relativity theory by supplying a\nunified theory of all natural forces, including gravitation. The\nbasic idea of string theory is not to take particles as fundamental\nobjects but strings that are very small but extended in one\ndimension. This assumption has the pivotal consequence that strings\ninteract on an extended distance and not at a point. This difference\nbetween string theory and standard QFT is essential because it is the\nreason why string theory also encompasses the gravitational force\nwhich is very difficult to deal with in the framework of QFT.\n\n\nIt is so hard to reconcile gravitation with QFT because the typical\nlength scale of the gravitational force is very small, namely at\nPlanck scale, so that the quantum field theoretical assumption of\npoint-like interaction leads to untreatable infinities. To put it\nanother way, gravitation becomes significant (in particular in\ncomparison to strong interaction) exactly where QFT is most severely\nendangered by infinite quantities. The extended interaction of\nstrings brings it about that such infinities can be avoided. In\ncontrast to the entities in standard quantum physics strings are not\ncharacterized by quantum numbers but only by their geometrical and\ndynamical properties. Nevertheless, \u201cmacroscopically\u201d\nstrings look like quantum particles with quantum numbers. A basic\ngeometrical distinction is the one between open strings, i.e., strings\nwith two ends, and closed strings which are like bracelets. The\ncentral dynamical property of strings is their mode of excitation,\ni.e., how they vibrate.\n\n\nReservations about string theory are mostly due to the lack of\ntestability since it seems that there are no empirical consequences\nwhich could be tested by the methods which are, at least up to now,\navailable to us. The reason for this \u201cproblem\u201d is that the\nlength scale of strings is in the average the same as the one of\nquantum gravity, namely the Planck length of approximately\n\\(10^{-33}\\) centimeters which lies far beyond the\naccessibility of feasible particle experiments. But there are also\nother peculiar features of string theory which might be hard to\nswallow. One of them is the fact that preferred models of string theory need\nspace-time with 10, 11 or even 26 dimensions. In order to explain the\nappearance of only four space-time dimensions string theory assumes\nthat the other dimensions are somehow folded away or\n\u201ccompactified\u201d so that they are no longer visible. An\nintuitive idea can be gained by thinking of a macaroni which is a\ntube, i.e., a two-dimensional piece of pasta rolled together, but\nwhich looks from the distance like a one-dimensional string.\n\n\nDue to the problems of string theory, many physicists have abandoned it, but not all. Some\n think that, among the numerous alternative proposals for reconciling quantum physics and general relativity theory, string theory is still the best candidate, with\n\u201cloop quantum gravity\u201d as its strongest rival (see the\nentry on\n quantum gravity). \nCorrespondingly, string theory has also received some attention within\nthe philosophy of physics community in recent years. Probably the\nfirst philosophical investigation of string theory is Weingard (2001)\nin Callender & Huggett (2001), an anthology with further related\narticles. Dawid (2003) (see Other Internet Resources below) argues\nthat string theory has significant consequences for the philosophical\ndebate about realism, namely that it speaks against the plausibility\nof anti-realistic positions. Also see Dawid (2009). Johansson and\nMatsubara (2011) assess string theory from various different\nmethodological perspectives, reaching conclusions in disagreement with\nDawid (2009). Standard introductory monographs on string theory are\nPolchinski (2000) and Kaku (1999). Greene (1999) is a very successful\npopular introduction. An interactive website with a nice elementary\nintroduction is \u2018Stringtheory.com\u2019 (see the Other Internet\nResources section below).\n",
