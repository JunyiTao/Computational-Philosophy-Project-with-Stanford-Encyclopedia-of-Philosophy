Connectionism and Semantic Similarity\n\nOne of the attractions of distributed representations in connectionist\nmodels is that they suggest a solution to the problem of providing a\ntheory of how brain states could have meaning. The idea is that the\nsimilarities and differences between activation patterns along\ndifferent dimensions of neural activity record semantical information.\nSo the similarity properties of neural activations provide intrinsic\nproperties that determine meaning. However, when it comes to\ncompositional linguistic representations, Fodor and Lepore (1992: Ch.\n6) challenge similarity based accounts, on two fronts. The first\nproblem is that human brains presumably vary significantly in the\nnumber of and connections between their neurons. Although it is\nstraightforward to define similarity measures on two nets that contain\nthe same number of units, it is harder to see how this can be done\nwhen the basic architectures of two nets differ. The second problem\nFodor and Lepore cite is that even if similarity measures for meanings\ncan be successfully crafted, they are inadequate to the task of\nmeeting the desiderata which a theory of meaning must satisfy.\n\nChurchland (1998) shows that the first of these two objections can be\nmet. Citing the work of Laakso and Cottrell (2000) he explains how\nsimilarity measures between activation patterns in nets with radically\ndifferent structures can be defined. Not only that, Laakso and\nCottrell show that nets of different structures trained on the same\ntask develop activation patterns which are strongly similar according\nto the measures they recommend. This offers hope that empirically well\ndefined measures of similarity of concepts and thoughts across\ndifferent individuals might be forged.\n\nOn the other hand, the development of a traditional theory of meaning\nbased on similarity faces severe obstacles (Fodor & Lepore 1999),\nfor such a theory would be required to assign sentences truth\nconditions based on an analysis of the meaning of their parts, and it\nis not clear that similarity alone is up to such tasks as fixing\ndenotation in the way a standard theory demands. However, most\nconnectionists who promote similarity based accounts of meaning reject\nmany of the presupposition of standard theories. They hope to craft a\nworking alternative which either rejects or modifies those\npresuppositions while still being faithful to the data on human\nlinguistic abilities.\n\nCalvo Garz\u00f3n (2003) complains that there are reasons to think\nthat connectionists must fail. Churchland\u2019s response has no\nanswer to the collateral information challenge. That problem is that\nthe measured similarities between activation patterns for a concept\n(say: grandmother) in two human brains are guaranteed to be very low\nbecause two people\u2019s (collateral) information on their\ngrandmothers (name, appearance, age, character) is going to be very\ndifferent. If concepts are defined by everything we know, then the\nmeasures for activation patterns of our concepts are bound to be far\napart. This is a truly deep problem in any theory that hopes to define\nmeaning by functional relationships between brain states. Philosophers\nof many stripes must struggle with this problem. Given the lack of a\nsuccessfully worked out theory of concepts in either traditional or\nconnectionist paradigms, it is only fair to leave the question for\nfuture research.\n",
