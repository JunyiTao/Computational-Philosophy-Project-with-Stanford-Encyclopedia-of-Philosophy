    "main_text": "Conversational and Conventional Implicature\n2. Conversational and Conventional Implicature\n\nThe implicatures in\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n are conversational. They depend on features of the\nconversational context, and are not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentences uttered. A key feature in (1) was\nAlan\u2019s question. Had he asked \u201cWhat are you going to do\ntoday?\u201d, Barb could have implicated something completely\ndifferent (that she is going to work) by saying the same thing (that\nshe has to work). Grice (1975: 25) contrasted a conversational\nimplicature with a conventional implicature, by which he\nmeant one that is determined by the meaning of the sentence\n used.[8]\n Here\u2019s a variant of Grice\u2019s example.\n\n(3)\n\n\na.\nThe queen is English and therefore brave.\nb.\nThe queen is English and brave.\nc.\nBeing brave follows from being English.\n\n\n\n\nWe will use parentheses to refer to the sentences in an example like\n(3), and brackets to refer to what the sentences express. So (3c) is\nthe sentence \u201cBeing brave follows from being English\u201d and\n[3c] is the proposition that being brave follows from being English.\nBy using (3a) to say and mean [3a], speakers implicate [3c]. That is,\nby using (3a) to say and mean that the queen is English and therefore\nbrave, speakers implicate that being brave follows from being English.\nThey imply rather than say that being brave follows\nfrom being English. In contrast, (3b) would rarely if ever be used to\nimplicate [3c]. The meaning of \u201ctherefore\u201d generates the\nimplicature of (3a). Other words \u201ctriggering\u201d conventional\nimplicatures are but, even, too, still, yet, already, again, stop,\nstart, know, and\n regret.[9]\n\nWhile Grice\u2019s examples were triggered lexically, other\nconventional implicatures are triggered syntactically. Speakers who\nassert Ravel, a Spaniard, wrote Spanish-style music implicate\nthat Ravel was a Spaniard\u2014they imply but do not say that Ravel\nwas a Spaniard. Hence their utterance is misleading but not a lie if\nthey know Ravel was French. The implicature is conventional in that it\nis determined by the meaning of the sentence via the appositive\nconstruction. Other constructions that generate conventional\nimplicatures are as-parentheticals (as a Spaniard) and\nparenthetical relative clauses (who was Spanish).\n\nAs\n (1)\n illustrates, when a conversational implicature is false, the\nspeaker\u2019s statement is misleading. Barb\u2019s utterance would\nnonetheless be linguistically flawless. Because [3c] is false, on the\nother hand, the use of\n (3a)\n to make a statement is infelicitous and improper as\nwell as misleading. The truth of [3c] is a precondition of properly\nusing\n (3a)\n to assert what it says. Conventional implicatures like [3c] are\npresuppositions in the non-technical sense in which the\nquestion \u201cHave you cheated again?\u201d presupposes that you\ncheated before. The question is inappropriate, and cannot be given a\nstraight \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answer, unless you did\ncheat before. For the same reason, the question Is the queen\nEnglish and therefore brave? is improper; answering either\n\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d implies a connection between\nbeing English and\n brave.[10]\n\nNot all conventional implicatures are presuppositions in the same way.\nFor example, Jack knows that 51 is prime entails and\nimplicates that 51 is prime. So it is false and possibly a lie because\n51 is not prime.  Nevertheless, it is linguistically proper and\nfelicitous.  That 51 is prime is an implicature because speakers\nwho use Jack knows that 51 is prime imply rather than say or\nassert that 51 is prime; they imply it by saying that Jack knows 51 is\nprime.  In both cases, if and that\u2019s  a good (or\nbad) thing is added, that will refer to what is said but\nnot what is implicated (cf. Geurts 2010:\n 6).[11]\n\nPotts (2005: 35\u20136) claimed that a sentence cannot be\nused with its conventional meaning without implicating its\nconventional\n implicatures.[12] \n While this is a natural way to interpret Grice\u2019s claim that\nconventional implicatures are determined by sentence meaning, examples\nlike (4) show that it is too\n strong.[13]\n\n(4)\n\n\na.\nIf the queen is English, and being brave follows from being\nEnglish, then the queen is English and therefore brave.\nb.\nTrump, the stable genius, started a trade war (said\n  ironically). \n\n\n\n(3a)\n is used with its conventional meaning in (4a) as the consequent of a\nconditional. But because\n (3c)\n is a conjunct of the antecedent of that conditional, (4a) itself does\nnot imply in any way that being brave follows from being English. A\nspeaker asserting [4a] does not say [3a] and does not mean [3c]. So\nthe speaker does not implicate that being brave follows from being\nEnglish. The antecedent of [4a] prevents the conversational\nimplicature of its consequent from \u201cprojecting\u201d. The\nimplicature triggered by the appositive in (4b) is not implicated for\na completely different reason. When this sentence is used ironically,\nthe speaker uses it with its conventional meaning and says that Trump,\nthe stable genius, started a trade war. But because it is used to mock\nTrump\u2019s claim that he is a stable genius, the speaker does not\nimplicate that Trump is a stable genius. Indeed, he implicates the\nvery opposite. The meaning of a sentence determines its conventional\nimplicatures, but whether a speaker implicates them depends on how the\nsentence is used. What does entail implicating a sentence\u2019s\nconventional implicatures is using it to assert what the sentence\nmeans or expresses.  Doing that does not necessitate any\nconversational implicatures. \n\nWhile Grice used \u201cconventional\u201d to denote an implicature\ndetermined by linguistic meaning, W. Davis (1998: Chs. 5\u20136) and\nLepore & Stone (2015: Pt. II) argue that even conversational\nimplicatures can be conventional in the non-technical sense in which\nit is conventional for women to wear a sari in India but not Mongolia,\nand for German speakers to use rot to mean \u201cred\u201d\nbut not English\n speakers.[14]\n Conventions in this sense are common practices that serve a social\ninterest, perpetuate themselves in certain ways, and are arbitrary in\nthat other practices could have served the same purposes and\nperpetuated themselves. New speakers pick up conventions from prior\nspeakers, often with no instruction. Consider (5):\n\n(5)\n\n\na.\nSome athletes smoke.\nb.\nNot all athletes smoke.\n\n\n\nIt would be unconventional (unusual, idiosyncratic, even\nunprecedented) for people who say \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d to\nconversationally implicate that some physically fit people will\ndevelop bladder cancer, but conventional (customary, normal, standard\npractice) for them to implicate that not all athletes smoke. The\ncustomary implicature is not conventional in Grice\u2019s sense,\nthough. For \u201cNot all athletes smoke\u201d is not determined by\nthe meaning of \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d. Speakers can and\noften do say and assert\n (5a)[15]\nwhile implicating something other than\n [5b],\n as\n (6)\n will illustrate. The practice of using sentences of the form\n\u201cSome NP VP\u201d to mean \u201cNot all\nNP VP\u201d is not a semantic or syntactic convention. It is\na pragmatic convention. To avoid confusion, I will describe\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice\u2019s sense as\nsemantic. When not modified by \u201cin Grice\u2019s\nsense\u201d, \u201cconventional\u201d will have the broader sense\nof\n customary.[16]\n\nGrice (1975: 37ff) called implicatures like\n [5b]\n generalized conversational implicatures\n(\u201cGCIs\u201d). The term is appropriate because\n (5a)\n can be used to implicate\n [5b]\n in a wide variety of contexts. Grice characterized generalized\nimplicatures as those that \u201cwould normally (in the absence of\nspecial circumstances)\u201d be carried by \u201cthe use of a\ncertain form of words\u201d. Levinson (2000: 11\u201312,\n16\u201322, 42\u201346) characterized GCIs similarly as\n\u201cdefault inferences\u201d\u2014implicatures we normally and\nautomatically infer in the absence of evidence to the\n contrary.[17]\n These characterizations are too strong in one respect. There is\nnothing abnormal about the use of\n (5a)\n in (6), where Gina would normally implicate [6a] rather than\n [5b].\n\n(6)\nFred: Do you know whether all athletes smoke?\n    Gina: Some athletes smoke.\n    \na.\nI do not know whether all athletes smoke.\n\n\n\nThe fact that \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d can be used to\nimplicate\n [5b]\n in some contexts and\n [6a]\n in others shows that neither is the default, especially given that\nfigurative use with a variety of implicatures is also\na possibility (\u00a74).  The same fact also shows that\nneither is a conventional implicature in Grice\u2019s sense. Having\nmore than one GCI is compatible with them all being conventional in\nthe broad sense, though. The word bank has several meanings\nin English, including \u201crow\u201d, as in bank of\nswitches. So it is conventional to use bank to mean\n\u201crow\u201d, even though this cannot be described as its normal\nor default use.\n\nFollowing Grice (1975: 39), it is widely accepted that generalized\nconversational implicatures differ from semantic implicatures in being\ncancelable, either explicitly or implicitly\n (contextually).[18]\nWhereas (3a) cannot be asserted without implicating [3c],\n (5a) can\n be asserted without implicating\n [5b].\n The speaker may do this explicitly by adding \u201cIndeed, all\ndo\u201d after uttering \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d.\nAlternatively, the implicature may be cancelled implicitly by the\nutterance context, as when it is obvious that the speaker is either\nengaging in understatement or ignorant of further facts.  An\nactual implicature is cancelable if it could have been canceled. \nIn example (1), Barb would not have implicated that she is not going\nto Paul\u2019s party if she had added \u201cBut I might be able to\nleave early.\u201d\n\nWhereas semantic implicatures are generally entailed by what is said,\nmany believe that conversational implicatures cannot\n be.[19]\n As\n (1),\n (2),\n (5),\n and\n (6) illustrate, conversational implicatures\n are typically not entailments. But exceptions have been\n noted.[20]\n When a speaker responds to \u201cIs Tom 65 or blind?\u201d by\n asserting \u201cTom is 65,\u201d the speaker may well have answered\n the question by implicating that Tom is 65 or blind.  That is, the\n speaker may have meant that disjunction by saying that Tom is 65.\n Neale (1992: 529) believes the cancelability of conversational\n implicatures prevents them from being entailments. But while an\n entailed implicature cannot be explicitly canceled if the result\n would be incoherent (\u201cTom is 65, but is not 65 or\n blind\u201d), it can at least be implicitly canceled.  This can\n happen if the speaker answers the simple question \u201cHow old is\n Tom?\u201d in a context in which no one is thinking about blindness.\n Even explicit cancellation is possible in some cases.  A\n mathematician could implicate that Tom\u2019s age is a prime number\n by saying that it is 67.  One form of explicit cancellation\n (\u201cTom\u2019s age is 67, but not prime\u201d) would be\n necessarily false, and indicate that the speaker is not a math whiz,\n but it is not incoherent.  Another form (\u201cTom\u2019s age is\n 67, but I don\u2019t know if that is prime\u201d) only indicates\n ignorance.\n\nGrice observed that conversational implicatures are typically\nconnected to what is said rather than the way it is said, so that\n\u201cit is not possible to find another way of saying the same\nthing, which simply lacks the implicature in question\u201d (1975:\n39). The implicature of\n (1)\n is thus said to be nondetachable. Grice allowed exceptions,\nthough, \u201cwhere some special feature of the substituted version\nis itself relevant to the determination of an implicature\u201d (see\nGrice\u2019s \u201cmaxim of Manner\u201d in\n \u00a76).\n Metalinguistic implicatures\u2014those that refer to the particular\nwords the speaker\n used[21]\u2014are\n also detachable.\n\n (7) \nHarry: What is this\nspecies of bird called in English?\n\nIrene: This is a widgeon.\n\n\nIn example (7), Irene used \u201cThis is a widgeon\u201d to\nimplicate that the English word for the species is\n\u201cwidgeon\u201d. Had Irene used a German sentence with the same\nmeaning (Dies ist eine Pfeife) she would have said the same\nthing while implicating something different (that it is called\n\u201cPfeife\u201d). Semantic implicatures, in contrast, are\nnondetachable because they are determined by what the sentence\nmeans.\n",
