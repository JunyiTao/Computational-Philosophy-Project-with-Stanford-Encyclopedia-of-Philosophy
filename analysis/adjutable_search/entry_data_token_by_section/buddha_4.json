    "main_text": "Karma and Rebirth\n5. Attitude toward Reason\n\nWhen the Buddha says that a person in one life and the person in\nanother life are neither the same nor different, one\u2019s first\nresponse might be to take \u2018different\u2019 to mean something\nother than \u2018not the same\u2019. But while this is possible in\nEnglish given the ambiguity of \u2018the same\u2019, it is not\npossible in the P\u0101li source, where the Buddha is represented as\nunambiguously denying both numerical identity and numerical\ndistinctness. This has led some to wonder whether the Buddha does not\nemploy a deviant logic. Such suspicions are strengthened by those\ncases where the options are not two but four, cases of the so-called\ntetralemma (catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di). For instance, when the\nBuddha is questioned about the post-mortem status of the enlightened\nperson or arhat (e.g., at M I.483\u20138) the possibilities\nare listed as: (1) the arhat continues to exist after death,\n(2) does not exist after death, (3) both exists and does not exist\nafter death, and (4) neither exists nor does not exist after death.\nWhen the Buddha rejects both (1) and (2) we get a repetition of\n\u2018neither the same nor different\u2019. But when he goes on to\nentertain, and then reject, (3) and (4) the logical difficulties are\ncompounded. Since each of (3) and (4) appears to be formally\ncontradictory, to entertain either is to entertain the possibility\nthat a contradiction might be true. And their denial seems tantamount\nto affirmation of excluded middle, which is prima facie\nincompatible with the denial of both (1) and (2). One might wonder\nwhether we are here in the presence of the mystical.\n\nThere were some Buddhist philosophers who took \u2018neither the same\nnor different\u2019 in this way. These were the Personalists\n(Pudgalav\u0101dins), who were so called because they\naffirmed the ultimate existence of the person as something named and\nconceptualized in dependence on the psychophysical elements. They\nclaimed that the person is neither identical with nor distinct from\nthe psychophysical elements. They were prepared to accept, as a\nconsequence, that nothing whatever can be said about the relation\nbetween person and elements. But their view was rejected by most\nBuddhist philosophers, in part on the grounds that it quickly leads to\nan ineffability paradox: one can say neither that the person\u2019s\nrelation to the elements is inexpressible, nor that it is not\ninexpressible. The consensus view was instead that the fact that the\nperson can be said to be neither identical with nor distinct from the\nelements is grounds for taking the person to be a mere conceptual\nfiction. Concerning the persons in the two lives, they understood the\nnegations involved in \u2018neither the same nor different\u2019 to\nbe of the commitmentless variety, i.e., to function like illocutionary\nnegation. If we agree that the statement \u20187 is green\u2019 is\nsemantically ill-formed, on the grounds that abstract objects such as\nnumbers do not have colors, then we might go on to say, \u2018Do not\nsay that 7 is green, and do not say that it is not green\neither\u2019. There is no contradiction here, since the illocutionary\nnegation operator \u2018do not say\u2019 generates no commitment to\nan alternative characterization.\n\nThere is also evidence that claims of type (3) involve\nparameterization. For instance, the claim about the arhat\nwould be that there is some respect in which they can be said to exist\nafter death, and some other respect in which they can be said to no\nlonger exist after death. Entertaining such a proposition does not\nrequire that one believe there might be true contradictions. And while\nclaims of type (4) would seem to be logically equivalent to those of\ntype (3) (regardless of whether or not they involve parameterization),\nthe tradition treated this type as asserting that the subject is\nbeyond all conceptualization. To reject the type (4) claim about the\narhat is to close off one natural response to the rejections\nof the first three claims: that the status of the arhat after\ndeath transcends rational understanding. That the Buddha rejected all\nfour possibilities concerning this and related questions is not\nevidence that he employed a deviant logic.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s response to questions like those concerning the\narhat is sometimes cited in defense of a different claim\nabout his attitude toward rationality. This is the claim that the\nBuddha was essentially a pragmatist, someone who rejects philosophical\ntheorizing for its own sake and employs philosophical rationality only\nto the extent that doing so can help solve the practical problem of\neliminating suffering. The Buddha does seem to be embracing something\nlike this attitude when he defends his refusal to answer questions\nlike that about the arhat, or whether the series of lives has\na beginning, or whether the living principle (j\u012bva) is\nidentical with the body. He calls all the possible views with respect\nto such questions distractions insofar as answering them would not\nlead to the cessation of the defilements and thus to the end of\nsuffering. And in a famous simile (M I.429) he compares someone who\ninsists that the Buddha answer these questions to someone who has been\nwounded by an arrow but will not have the wound treated until they are\ntold who shot the arrow, what sort of wood the arrow is made of, and\nthe like.\n\nPassages such as these surely attest to the great importance the\nBuddha placed on sharing his insights to help others overcome\nsuffering. But this is consistent with the belief that philosophical\nrationality may be used to answer questions that lack evident\nconnection with pressing practical concerns. And on at least one\noccasion the Buddha does just this. Pressed to give his answers to the\nquestions about the arhat and the like, the Buddha first\nrejects all the possibilities of the tetralemma, and defends his\nrefusal on the grounds that such theories are not conducive to\nliberation from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. But when his questioner\nshows signs of thereby losing confidence in the value of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings about the path to the cessation of suffering,\nthe Buddha responds with the example of a fire that goes out after\nexhausting its fuel. If one were asked where this fire has gone, the\nBuddha points out, one could consistently deny that it has gone to the\nnorth, to the south, or in any other direction. This is so for the\nsimple reason that the questions \u2018Has it gone to the\nnorth?\u2019, \u2018Has it gone to the south?\u2019, etc., all\nshare the false presupposition that the fire continues to exist.\nLikewise the questions about the arhat and the like all share\nthe false presupposition that there is such a thing as a person who\nmight either continue to exist after death, cease to exist at death,\netc. (An\u0101layo 2018, 41) The difficulty with these questions is\nnot that they try to extend philosophical rationality beyond its\nlegitimate domain, as the handmaiden of soteriologically useful\npractice. It is rather that they rest on a false\npresupposition\u2014something that is disclosed through the\nemployment of philosophical rationality.\n\nA different sort of challenge to the claim that the Buddha valued\nphilosophical rationality for its own sake comes from the role played\nby authority in Buddhist soteriology. For instance, in the Buddhist\ntradition one sometimes encounters the claim that only enlightened\npersons such as the Buddha can know all the details of karmic\ncausation. And to the extent that the moral rules are thought to be\ndetermined by the details of karmic causation, this might be taken to\nmean that our knowledge of the moral rules is dependent on the\nauthority of the Buddha. Again, the subsequent development of Buddhist\nphilosophy seems to have been constrained by the need to make theory\ncompatible with certain key claims of the Buddha. For instance, one\nschool developed an elaborate form of four-dimensionalism, not because\nof any deep dissatisfaction with presentism, but because they believed\nthe non-existence of the past and the future to be incompatible with\nthe Buddha\u2019s alleged ability to cognize past and future events.\nAnd some modern scholars go so far as to wonder whether non-self\nfunctions as anything more than a sort of linguistic taboo against the\nuse of words like \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 in the\nBuddhist tradition (Collins 1982: 183). The suggestion is that just as\nin some other religious traditions the views of the founder or the\nstatements of scripture trump all other considerations, including any\nviews arrived at through the free exercise of rational inquiry, so in\nBuddhism as well there can be at best only a highly constrained arena\nfor the deployment of philosophical rationality.\n\nNow it could be that while this is true of the tradition that\ndeveloped out of the Buddha\u2019s teachings, the Buddha himself held\nthe unfettered use of rationality in quite high esteem. This would\nseem to conflict with what he is represented as saying in response to\nthe report that he arrived at his conclusions through reasoning and\nanalysis alone: that such a report is libelous, since he possesses a\nnumber of superhuman cognitive powers (M I.68). But at least some\nscholars take this passage to be not the Buddha\u2019s own words but\nan expression of later devotionalist concerns (Gombrich 2009: 164).\nIndeed one does find a spirited discussion within the tradition\nconcerning the question whether the Buddha is omniscient, a discussion\nthat may well reflect competition between Buddhism and those\nBrahmanical schools that posit an omniscient creator. And at least for\nthe most part the Buddhist tradition is careful not to attribute to\nthe Buddha the sort of omniscience usually ascribed to an all-perfect\nbeing: the actual cognition, at any one time, of all truths. Instead a\nBuddha is said to be omniscient only in the much weaker sense of\nalways having the ability to cognize any individual fact relevant to\nthe soteriological project, viz. the details of their own past lives,\nthe workings of the karmic causal laws, and whether a given\nindividual\u2019s defilements have been extirpated. Moreover, these\nabilities are said to be ones that a Buddha acquires through a\nspecific course of training, and thus ones that others may reasonably\naspire to as well. The attitude of the later tradition seems to be\nthat while one could discover the relevant facts on one\u2019s own,\nit would be more reasonable to take advantage of the fact that the\nBuddha has already done all the epistemic labor involved. When we\narrive in a new town we could always find our final destination\nthrough trial and error, but it would make more sense to ask someone\nwho already knows their way about.\n\nThe Buddhist philosophical tradition grew out of earlier efforts to\nsystematize the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Within a century or two of\nthe death of the Buddha, exegetical differences led to debates\nconcerning the Buddha\u2019s true intention on some matter, such as\nthat between the Personalists and others over the status of the\nperson. While the parties to these debates use many of the standard\ntools and techniques of philosophy, they were still circumscribed by\nthe assumption that the Buddha\u2019s views on the matter at hand are\nauthoritative. In time, however, the discussion widened to include\ninterlocutors representing various Brahmanical systems. Since the\nlatter did not take the Buddha\u2019s word as authoritative, Buddhist\nthinkers were required to defend their positions in other ways. The\nresulting debate (which continued for about nine centuries) touched on\nmost of the topics now considered standard in metaphysics,\nepistemology and philosophy of language, and was characterized by\nconsiderable sophistication in philosophical methodology. What the\nBuddha would have thought of these developments we cannot say with any\ncertainty. What we can say is that many Buddhists have believed that\nthe unfettered exercise of philosophical rationality is quite\nconsistent with his teachings.\n",
