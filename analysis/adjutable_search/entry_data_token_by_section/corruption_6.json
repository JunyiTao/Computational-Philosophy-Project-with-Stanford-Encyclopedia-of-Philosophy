    "main_text": "Integrity Systems\n5. Conclusion\n\nCorruption is a highly diverse phenomenon, including bribery,\nnepotism, false testimony, cheating, abuse of authority and so on.\nMoreover, corruption takes different forms across the spectrum of\ninstitutions giving rise to political corruption, financial\ncorruption, police corruption, academic corruption and so on. The\ncausal theory of corruption is a sustained attempt to provide an\naccount which accommodates this diversity. In doing so it emphasizes\nthe causal as well as the normative dimension of institutional\ncorruption. The most influential contemporary philosophical theories\nof political corruption are those of Dennis Thompson and Lawrence\nLessig. Moreover, Lessig\u2019s notion of dependence corruptions\nlooks to be generalizable to a degree to institutions other than\npolitical institutions. Likewise the mechanism that lies at the heart\nof Thompson\u2019s theory may be generalizable to a degree to\ninstitutions other than political institutions. However, as they\nstand, neither of these theories provides a general or comprehensive\ntheory of institutional corruption (and Lessig\u2019s theory, at\nleast, is not intended to do so). The wide diversity of corrupt\nactions implies that there may well need to be a correspondingly wide\nand diverse range of specific anti-corruption measures to combat\ncorruption in its different forms, and indeed in its possibly very\ndifferent contexts. Recent decades have seen the rise of whole systems\nof anti-corruptions mechanisms encased in what are referred to as\nintegrity systems. Here we can distinguish reactive from preventive\nelements of an integrity or anti-corruption system and, arguably, an\neffective integrity system should integrate reactive and preventive\nelements in an overall holistic system.\n",
