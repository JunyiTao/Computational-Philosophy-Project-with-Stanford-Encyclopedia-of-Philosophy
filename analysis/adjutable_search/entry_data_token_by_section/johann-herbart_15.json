(SW I: 261)\n\n Character has an ineluctably ethical aspect: we\nwant (our) character not to be of just any sort, but good. Like\nAristotle, Herbart holds that we always stand in some relation to virtue\nand vice. While not by nature good or bad, our actions and character\nnecessarily fall somewhere on the spectrum of virtue and vice. Virtue\nis thus not something attached from the outside to an ethically\nneutral self; rather, it is a natural quality of man that will develop\nwell or poorly. So Herbart, like Aristotle and Plato, does not think\nthat education should aim to inculcate moral truths or commandments,\nso much as lead the \u201cmoral[ly constituted human being]\nto recognize his own value and dignity, and [then] to elevate\nit\u201d (PS I: 199). Here again we see the transition from the\nobjective facticity of one\u2019s constitution as a being\nwith some moral charge, to the subjective endorsement of it,\nof accepting responsibility for the excellence of one\u2019s moral\nconstitution as the source of one\u2019s value and dignity. It is a\nmovement of \u201cawakening self-reflection\u201d, in which the\nform-law governing our involuntary (aesthetic) approval or disapproval\nof human actions or situations is elevated to norm-law, i.e., is\naccepted as binding on me, and to which I have a responsibility that I\naccept (cf. Weiss 1928: 216).\nAs with character generally, moral character displays a kind of\nnatural memory, a \u201cperduring in simple willing [,] the natural\nbeginning of unity and consistency of moral willing\u201d, already\nevident in the small child\u2019s incipient moral feeling (PS I: 199;\ncf. SW II: 120\u20131). All this points to the fact that in the\nobjective or natural constitution of character, we already find\n\u201cconceptions of the good and right\u201d. This natural moral\nmemory shows itself in the fact that\n\nmoral judgment as the pure natural appearance of\nthe essence of humanity is not \u201cobscure\u201d and\n\u201cmutable\u201d, but [always] \u201cdecisive\u201d, that it\nalways appears as the same willing whenever the same stimulus is\nrenewed and nothing hinders or neutralizes a pure conception of the\nobject, [i.e.,] whenever the mind is in a state of pure\ncontemplation. (Weiss 1928: 217; cf. esp. PS I: 131)\nThis consistent, disinterested willing just is the phenomenon of\nconscience, which thus reveals itself as a form of willing, namely the\nnatural desire for the good as neutrally judged. As will, conscience,\ntoo, has an object, namely the moral ideal, i.e., its own relation to\nother wills. As we saw in our discussion of Herbart\u2019s ethics,\n\n[t]he judged [thing, sc. judged by\n\u201cconscience\u201d] is also [the] will, [only in this case] the\nwill in its relation to other wills (PS I: 202)\n\n Conscience as \u201cnatural\u201d or\n\u201cobjective\u201d will thus articulates the (moral) demands\nthat the human being makes of himself, the pursuit of which\ndetermines his moral character, now properly so\ncalled. Self-reflection at first notices objective as well as\nsubjective willing, but when the object has been completely\nrepresented, viz., the individual will as a member\nor relatum of a will-relation, then this complete\nrepresentation of the object also provokes approval or disapproval as an immediate\n\u201caesthetic\u201d effect . In other\nwords, the individual goes beyond merely registering how he feels or\nfinds himself, to positively approving or censuring that same inner\nstate.\nWe see here a special case of apperception as an interaction among\nconflicting representational masses, in which one representational\ngroup is not only \u201cnoticed\u201d but evaluated by another, held\nto what (from its perspective) is perceived as an alien claim. Now, on\nthe one hand, since the soul is postulated as a unity, the difference\nbetween how one is, and how one judges that one ought to\nbe, indicates an inner conflict. On the other hand, the moral\npersonality, as a manifestation of the integral soul, must or ought\nalso to be integrated. In short, the conflict must be resolved so that\nthe judged will is brought into agreement with the aesthetic\n(apperceiving, evaluating) will, and so \u201cmerge into a single\nperson\u201d: \u201c[T]his person represents the ideal of an\nethically self-determining will\u201d (PS I: 202; cf. 131). But since\nthis ideal is rarely if ever achieved, we constantly feel compelled to\n\u201cinterrupt our activity and alter our mental disposition from\nwithin\u201d. Thus, for the sake of the unity of the moral\npersonality, the human takes as a categorical imperative what\npreviously was but an aesthetic judgment.\nNow it is a presupposition of pedagogy that all human beings are\ncapable of living up to the ideal of an integrated, unified,\nautonomous personality (PS I: 202; 93). But how does the will become\ndecisive? In other words, how do we gain a moral character\nthat acts for the good? We may approach this problem by\nasking how those natures that successfully form themselves do so, and\nthrough what stages they must pass in \u201cgaining a\ncharacter\u201d (Weiss 1928: 221\u20132). This can help the\npedagogue develop a plan for optimizing what is otherwise a haphazard\nprocess. The resolute character depends, first, upon a\nmoral eros, and striving towards a representation. The will\ngenerates the act out of a desire (PS I: 360). But active deeds in\nturn depend on natural disposition\u2014including bodily health; the\nwill\u2019s memory; and the spirit\u2019s mobility or\n\u201cflexibility\u201d (PS I: 365). The less motile the spirit,\nthe firmer the will (PS I: 365;\n198).[77] Now\nnatural disposition develops very slowly and only fully matures in\nadults when they enter the world. Hence character-education has\nlittle latitude, since children rarely are placed in situations of\ntrue responsibility. At just the moment when the young adult takes up\nresponsibilities, his receptivity for education is exhausted (SW II:\n88, f.; PS I: 364).\nHerbart draws two conclusions: First, that character-formation must\nfocus on the young person\u2019s \u201csphere of desire\n[Begehrungskreis]\u201d, as the one aspect of character\napparently susceptible to \u201ca lasting influence\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 224). And since desires aim at goals, and goals are\nrepresentations, the educator can set to work upon the \u201csphere\nof representations\u201d, and thus shape the ultimate targets for the\nmature individual\u2019s future desire (SW II: 118, f.). Second,\nHerbart concludes that character-development gains stability and\nsecurity by being accelerated and integrated into the actual period\nand process of education. The teacher must keep in mind that character\n\u201cis solely formed through action out of one\u2019s own\nwill\u201d (PS I: 251). Therefore, Herbart\u2019s pedagogy\nemphasizes the importance of offering the child\u2019s will ample\nopportunity to express itself: \u201cBoys and youths must\nbe dared to become men\u201d (\u201cMa\u00dfregeln der\nKinderregierung\u201d; Herbart 1887b: 17). It is the work itself\nthat fixes the bounds of thought and action, not the teacher; within\nthose bounds the student is to be given maximal freedom (PS I:\n308). By frequently exercising the freedom of the will in purposeful\nactivity, the pedagogue is able to \u201charden\u201d the\npupil\u2019s will (PS I: 368\u20139).\nWe began by asking how moral character is to be formed. This\nquestion finally calls for consideration of the \u201cinfluences\nthat specially affect the moral features of character\u201d (Weiss\n1928: 225). Chief among these is aesthetic judgment, which must\ntherefore be constantly exercised, so as to become the power\nmastering desires. The pedagogue must therefore carefully attend to\nthe contents of the child\u2019s or sphere of thoughts. First, the\npupil should gain a clear and particularized familiarity with a\n\u201cwhole series of moral elements and their most common causes in\nlife\u201d, e.g., the main relationships of daily life, family,\ncountry, and their various conflicts and contradictions. Further,\nsince character ultimately depends on the integration of the person,\nall domains of human interest must be brought into relation with the\nideal: thus, for Herbart as for\nMontaigne,[78]\n history in the broadest sense provides an\nindispensable space in which to exercise the young person\u2019s\naesthetic and practical judgment. Since passive presentation of\nhistorical, literary, or philosophical pictures must be\navoided, the instructor must strive to bring peoples and persons of\nthe past to the fore as living people: practice in\nrecognizing many human types sharpens the pupil\u2019s\n\u201cethical eye\u201d, securing the child from dangerous\nsurprises in life (SW II: 50). Again, because historical figures\nappear at a distance, the pupil can contemplate them in a\ndisinterested fashion, letting \u201cpure taste\u201d rule action\nin his imagination. Such training is the best one can do in preparing\nthe person for adulthood.\n",
