    "main_text": "Pedagogy || Many-sidedness and \u201cinterest\u201d\n5.1 Many-sidedness and \u201cinterest\u201d\nInstruction aiming at many-sidedness has two main phases,\n\u201cengrossment\u201d (Vertiefung) and\n\u201creflection\u201d (Besinnung), each of which in turn\nhas a \u201cresting\u201d and a \u201cprogressive\u201d moment:\nresting engrossment is \u201cclarity\u201d; progressive engrossment\nis \u201cassociation\u201d; resting reflection is\n\u201csystem\u201d; progressive reflection is \u201cmethod\u201d\n(SW II: 38, ff.; cf. esp. Gl\u00f6ckner 1892; Beiser 2014:\n106\u20137). It is important to note that these phases of learning\nrecapitulate the process of apperception. That is, clarity occurs\nwhen a representation or representational series comes into full\nconsciousness, where it hovers in the full light of attention. One is\nengrossed in it, which is simply to say, one is not aware\nof anything else. But of course the child\u2019s mind rarely stays\noccupied with a single representation for long; its imagination\n(Phantasie) rapidly leads it, usually by association, to\nother, similar representations (SW II: 40).  This spontaneity of\nabsorption in environing objects is the source of a natural\nmany-sidedness, and thus the seed of the fully formed personality. While the phases of engrossment are natural to all human\nbeings, it is obvious that in themselves they have no direction or\norganizing \n principle.[71]\nThe teacher does not simply give the principle to the\nchild. Rather, his instruction aims to bring the child by stages to\nrecognize the principle on and as its own, by reflecting on\nits immediate experience. The child\u2019s maturity determines the\nscope of reflection, but she will always fall short of the full\nself-reflection characteristic of the adult. Since many-sidedness\ndepends on reflection for its full solidity, the child can also only\never approximate adult versatility and virtue (PS I: 149). For\nHerbart, the teacher promotes reflection by promoting what he calls\nthe child\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d (Interesse). Now,\nthe child\u2019s natural engrossment in its activities must be\nrespected as symbols of its individuality. At the same time,\nengrossment is a kind of seclusion, whereas interest is an opening up\nof the person in and to the \nworld.[72]\n Step by step, the teacher must lead the\npupil to become an interested, active learner, who desires not to\npossess knowledge, but to hover \u201cbetween merely\nspectating [on the one hand] and grasping [on the other]\u201d\n(cf. SW II: 42).\nThe first phase of interest is noticing objects:\n\nthe noticed object not only stands forth for a\ncertain duration from the flow of psychic activity, but also aids the\nreproduction of suppressed representations. (Weiss 1928: 194; cf. SW\nII: 42; 53)\n\n As other representations rise, new, imagined\nrepresentations are anticipated (as we saw frequently happens in\napperception). Should an imagined representation be perfectly\nrepresented, it will naturally provoke an aesthetic judgment of\napproval. This leads to a \u201cdemand\u201d for the imagined\nobject, i.e., an overpowering sense for its realization; and this\ndemand finally expresses itself in action in the world (SW II:\n42\u20133). It is thus clear that by \u201ccultivating\ninterest\u201d, Herbart does not mean simply getting the pupil\n\u201cto be interested in something\u201d. Rather, as these four\nphases of interest map onto the phases of engrossment and reflection,\ninterest is an expression of many-sidedness, namely its activity in\nthe world. For \u201cdemand\u201d here is not simply a strong\ndesire, but an apperceptive \u201cmental anticipation\u201d of the\nobject\u2019s realization. As such it is necessary for the pupil to\nadvance to a more perfect state of systematic and aesthetic\ncompleteness.[73]\n Thus by promoting interest and\nmany-sidedness, education primes the pupil for action (PS:\n181).[74]\nThus far, \u201cinterest\u201d has remained quite abstract: it\nis, in nuce, a questing openness towards certain objects,\nleading to action. Now the kind of action Herbart has in mind is not\nan instinctive reaction, but is integrated into a systematic plan. For\nthe totality of \u201cthe interesting\u201d is prescribed by\nculture,[75]\nand its divisions into the cultural and natural sciences (SW II: 44,\nf.).  Education must accordingly pursue in parallel the formation of\nthe pupil\u2019s imagination and understanding (PS I: 59; cf. 181).\nBecause all knowledge is rooted in experience, organized through\nspeculation, and grasped as a whole aesthetically, Bildung\nmust develop these three dimensions equally (SW II: 53). Equally\nimportant, however, is the pupil\u2019s constant, active\nparticipation in his surroundings, in order to develop an empathic\nunderstanding of her fellow human beings (PS I: 156; SW II: 51,\nff.). In all these cases, a teacher is needed to modify experience and\nhuman interaction in order to maximize the yield of knowledge. For\nexperience merely accumulates random representations;\ninstruction helps the person to analyze, organize and combine\nthese \u201cformless fragments\u201d (Weiss 1928:\n 200).[76]\n By the same token,\nmere everyday contact with others does not produce empathy.\nHence, the teacher must not be narrowly committed to his scientific\nexpertise, but demonstrate interest in the world and human beings (SW\nII: 50). While native taste and thoughtfulness cannot be taught, the\nteacher must be alert to these and fan such sparks in order\nto complete what nature has prepared (SW II: 46). Further, he\nmust respect the \u201cpersonal unity\u201d of the child:\nHerbart\u2019s rule:\n\nto give equal right to engrossment and reflection\nin every in area of inquiry, no matter how small; i.e., to tend in\norder to: clarity of the particular; association of\nthe many; coordination of what has been associated, as well\nas practice in progressing through this organization.\n\n In all this, the elements of\ninstruction\u2014\u201cfacts, information, ideas,\nknowledge\u201d\u2014are not negligible, but rather\n\nvitally important, for \u2026 they become built\nup into \u201capperception masses\u201d, which, in the process of\ntaking in more facts, information, ideas, knowledge, give\nrise to \u201capperceptive interest\u201d, this latter being itself\nof first importance in the character-forming process.
