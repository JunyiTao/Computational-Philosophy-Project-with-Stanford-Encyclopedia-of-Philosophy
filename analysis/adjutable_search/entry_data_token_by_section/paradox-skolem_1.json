    "main_text": "Mathematical Issues\n2. Mathematical Issues\n\n\nIn an introduction to the 1922 paper where Thoralf Skolem first\npresented Skolem's Paradox, Jean van Heijenoort writes that the paradox\n\u201cis not a paradox in the sense of an antinomy \u2026 it is a\nnovel and unexpected feature of formal\n systems.\u201d[12]\n This comment reflects the\ngeneral consensus on Skolem's Paradox within the mathematical\ncommunity. Whatever philosophical problems the paradox is supposed to\nengender, it just doesn't constitute a problem for\nmathematics.\n\n\nTo understand why the paradox doesn't constitute a problem for\nmathematics we need to ask two questions. In the simple formulation of\nthe paradox given above, we noted that there's a specific\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm\u02c6\nis\nuncountable.\u201d Literally, of course, this isn't quite right.\nWhat we really mean here is that there's a rather complicated formula\nin the language of formal set theory\u2014a formula which\nmathematicians sometimes find it convenient to abbreviate with the\nEnglish expression \u201cx is uncountable\u201d\u2014and\nthat M satisfies this particular formula at\nm\u02c6.\n For convenience, let's denote the relevant formula by\n\u201c\u03a9(x).\u201d Then we can rephrase the\nfact mentioned above by saying that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6].[13]\n Our two questions, then, are these:\n\nWhy is it so natural to abbreviate \u03a9(x) by\n\u201cx is uncountable\u201d? Why, in particular, would\nanyone even think that the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\nentails that m\u02c6 is uncountable?\nWhy doesn't the fact M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6] really entail that\nm\u02c6 is uncountable?\n\nIn effect, the first of these questions asks whether Skolem's Paradox\nis simply an artifact of our abbreviations, an artifact which\nwould disappear if Skolem's Paradox were formulated more carefully and\nperspicuously. Assuming that it wouldn't so disappear, the second\nquestion asks for a more-detailed explanation of how the paradox can\nreally be dissolved. \n",
