    "main_text": "\n\nThe humanist and classical scholar Justus Lipsius (Joost Lips)\n(1547\u20131606), described by his admiring correspondent Michel de\nMontaigne as one of the most learned men of his day (Essays\nII.12), was the founding father of Neostoicism, a key component of\nEuropean thought in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nHis famous and widely read Stoic dialogue De constantia was\nan attempt to combine Stoicism and Christianity, producing a new\nphilosophy that would help individuals to live through the difficult\nperiod of the religious wars and establishing constancy as\nthe most important of the virtues.\n\nLipsius\u2019s lifelong project was to transform contemporary moral\nphilosophy through a new reading of the Roman Stoic philosopher\nSeneca, while also revitalizing contemporary political practice by\ndrawing on the insights provided by the Roman historian Tacitus.\nBefore publishing his major edition of Seneca\u2019s philosophical\nwritings in the year before his death, he wrote two theoretical\ntreatises on Stoicism, which provided the philosophical foundation for\na new interpretation of Seneca and a new understanding of Stoic\ndoctrines.\n",
