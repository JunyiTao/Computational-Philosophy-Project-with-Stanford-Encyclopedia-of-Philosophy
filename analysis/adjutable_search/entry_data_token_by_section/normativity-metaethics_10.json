    "main_text": "Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation? || Primitivism: Non-Naturalism and Naturalism\n3.3 Primitivism: Non-Naturalism and Naturalism\n\nOne camp of realists holds that the nature of normativity\ncannot be fully explained. There is no correct constitutive\nexplanation of normativity. We might express their view by saying\nthat, for them, normativity is primitive. It is\nunanalyzable.\n\nWe distinguish primitivism about normativity as such from primitivism\nabout the normative properties or concepts. Primitivism about the\nnormative properties or concepts holds that the nature of these\nproperties or concepts cannot be fully explained. There is no correct\nconstitutive explanation of their nature. Primitivism about\nnormativity as such holds that the nature of normativity cannot be\nfully explained.\n\nIt seems, however, that primitivism about normativity as such commits\none to primitivism about the normative properties and concepts. For it\nis of the nature of the normative properties and concepts that they\nare normative. So primitivism about normativity implies that any\nconstitutive account of the nature of a normative property or concept\nwould have an unanalyzable constituent, the second-order normativity\nproperty. To illustrate, consider the view that all normative\nproperties can be reduced to some condition about reasons. Perhaps for\nan action to be wrong is, in part, for there to be reasons against it.\nBut reasons are normative considerations, so the primitivist about\nnormativity will say that the normativity of reasons is primitive.\nGeneralizing, according to primitivism about normativity, any\nconstitutive explanation of a normative property would have the\nnormativity property as an unanalyzable constituent. It therefore\nseems that primitivism about normativity implies or at least supports\na primitivism about the normative properties and concepts.\n\nPrimitivists typically are non-naturalists who hold that\nnormative properties belong to a metaphysically different kind than\nnatural properties. There is, however, room for a primitivism that is\nnaturalist. There might be natural properties the intrinsic nature of\nwhich is not open to analysis or to constitutive explanation, so we\nshould perhaps be open to the idea that the normative properties are\namong the primitive natural ones. Perhaps, too, the second-order\nproperty of being normative is a natural one, where there is no\ncorrect constitutive explanation of its nature. There are also\nprimitivist anti-realist theories, such as Parfit\u2019s cognitivist\nanti-realism and constructivist theories that deploy unanalyzed\nconceptions of rationality.\n\nThere is, then, a primitivism about normativity as such as well as a\nprimitivism about normative properties. There is also a primitivist\nview about normative concepts according to which these concepts are\nnot analyzable. Non-naturalists typically hold that both the\nnormative concepts and the normative properties are primitive and\nunanalyzable (see entry on\n moral non-naturalism).\n Further, naturalists who are primitivists about normative properties\nmight also be primitivists about the normative concepts. Indeed, even\nnaturalists who reject primitivism about normative properties might\nnevertheless accept primitivism about the normative concepts, and\nthereby hold that the normative concepts are unanalyzable (see Railton\n2003).\n\nIt is tempting to say that a theory that provided a constitutive\nexplanation of the nature of normativity would clearly be preferable\nto primitivism. For, we assume, the goal, in theorizing, is to explain\nthings. Accordingly, regardless of the subject matter, other things\nbeing equal, a theory that says that such and such cannot be explained\nis on that count alone less attractive than a theory that offers an\nexplanation, or that at least leaves open the possibility of an\nexplanation. Nevertheless, of course, in the absence of an\nexplanation, we need to be open to the possibility that one is not\ngoing to be found, and even, perhaps, to the possibility that, for\nsome reason, no explanation could be found. There are physical\nconstants that are unexplained in our best physical theories, for\nexample. Perhaps normativity similarly is not open to explanation.\n",
