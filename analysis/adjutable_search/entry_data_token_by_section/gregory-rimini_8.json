    "main_text": "Economic Thought\n7. Conclusion\n\nNow that Gregory\u2019s works are available in a reliable modern\nedition, he has begun receiving more direct attention, for example in\nthe collection of papers in Oberman 1981 and in the conference held in\nRimini in 2000 that was devoted to Gregory\u2019s life and thought\n(published as Gregorio da Rimini. Filosofo in Rimini in\n2003). It is to be hoped that further studies of his Parisian and\nOxford predecessors on various single issues will enable us to see his\ninnovations more clearly. Recent studies have shown that he was not\nalways as original as was once thought, but that does not diminish in\nany way his important position in the history of philosophy. Moreover,\nGregory sometimes did come up with new solutions to problems, and even\nwhere he did not, his treatments, because of their clarity and\ncomprehensiveness, often became the primary source for later thinkers\nof the ideas he adopted from his predecessors and developed.\n",
