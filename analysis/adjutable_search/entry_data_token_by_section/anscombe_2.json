    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n3. Metaphysics\n\nSome of Anscombe\u2019s most influential work was on the nature of\ncausation, a concept which is notoriously difficult to analyze. Part\nof her motivation for working on causation was to understand human\nfreedom. Her paper \u201cCausality and Determination\u201d [CAD]\nchallenged some of the empiricist orthodoxy of Hume\u2019s account.\nShe is concerned to distinguish causality from determination, arguing\nthat one event can cause another even if the latter isn\u2019t\ndetermined by its cause. When we note an event\u2019s cause, we note\nfrom what it derived. She writes \u201cCausality consists in the\nderivativeness of an effect from its causes\u201d (CAD, 136). But\nthat Y derives from X does not entail that\nX necessitated Y. So, we need not assume that every\ncause necessitates its effect. If causation always relates\ntypes of events (\u201cWhenever an X-like event\nhappens, a Y-like event happens\u201d), then it might look\nlike a cause necessitates its effect. But she challenged the view that\nthe causal relation is actually characterized by constant conjunction\nof types, and thus whether causation entails necessitation. Discussing\nFeynman\u2019s Geiger counter case, she writes:\n\nAn example of a non-necessitating cause is mentioned by Feynman: a\nbomb is connected to a Geiger counter, so that it will go off if the\nGeiger counter registers a certain reading; whether it will or not is\nnot determined, for it is so placed near some radioactive material\nthat it may or may not register that reading. (CAD, 145)\n\n\nAnd yet, if the bomb explodes it was caused by the Geiger counter\narrangement. Causation thus does not involve determination or\nnecessity. Since the radioactive decay was not sufficient for this\neffect, the case tells against viewing causes as sufficient\nconditions. There need be no general connection between cause and\neffect. This challenge to the Humean account would turn out to be very\ninfluential \u2013 it helped push philosophers towards the\ndevelopment of probabilistic accounts of causation to account for the\nabove type of case.\n\nInstead, Anscombe was a singularist about causation, since she further\nrejected the Humean view that causation is not observable in a single\ninstance. In her view, some perceivable events are themselves\ninstances of causation. Anscombe produced examples from ordinary\nlanguage that seem to show that we do perceive causation. Such\nexamples are abundant. \u201cI saw her clean the dishes\u201d\nreports the perception of a causal process.\n\nShe was also an indeterminist about freedom of action. Actions are\nmostly physical movements, and \u201cif these physical movements are\nphysically predetermined by processes which I do not control, then my\nfreedom is perfectly illusory\u201d (CAD, 146). Our actions are\nsurely caused, but not determined, and so there is still room for\nfreedom. Yet she also recognized that indeterminism does not suffice\nfor freedom; more is needed to establish that. We will need to\nunderstand what more is needed when we discuss her views about\naction.\n\nIn her paper \u201cThe First Person\u201d [TFP], originally\npublished in 1975, Anscombe argues for a thesis that seems patently\nfalse: the word \u201cI\u201d is not a referring expression. That\nis, while the function of a term like \u201cElizabeth\nAnscombe\u201d, or \u201cthe daughter of Allen Anscombe\u201d, or\n\u201cthat woman\u201d, or \u201cshe\u201d is\nreferential, the term \u201cI\u201d does not function in the same\nway. \u201cI\u201d thus refers to nothing at all. (Compare with the\nuse of \u2018It\u2019 in the thought \u201cIt is snowing.\u201d)\n\u201cThe First Person\u201d is probably Anscombe\u2019s most\ndifficult article \u2013 which is saying something \u2013 and even\nsympathetic scholars disagree about what the argument is supposed to\nbe. She was clearly influenced by Geach 1957, and by\nCaste\u00f1ada\u2019s various papers on the first person. Later,\nLewis 1979 discussed this issue in a distinct but by then familiar\nway.\n\nAnscombe focuses approvingly on some aspects of Descartes\u2019 use\nof \u2018I\u2019 in the Meditations. Famously, he cannot\ndoubt \u2018I exist.\u2019 But on the same grounds that he can doubt\n\u2018I have a body\u2019, he also can doubt \u2018I am\nDescartes.\u2019 After all, \u2018Descartes\u2019 is just the name\nof a human being, and he can doubt that he is any human being\nwhatsoever \u2013 he can wonder whether he\u2019s instead a brain in\na vat. So, if the argument indeed establishes the non-identity of\nhimself with this body, it likewise establishes the non-identity of\nhimself with Descartes!\n\nThis may seem strange, for this last thought may seem equivalent to\n\u201cDescartes was not Descartes\u201d, and that\ncan\u2019t be coherently denied. But Anscombe argues that these two\nthoughts are not equivalent. Why\u2019s that?\n\nWe do tend to think of \u2018I\u2019 as simply being that\nexpression people use to refer to themselves. However,\n\n\u201cWhen John Smith spoke of James Robinson he was speaking of his\nbrother, but he did not know this.\u201d That\u2019s a possible\nsituation. So similarly is \u201cWhen John Smith spoke of John\nHoratio Auberon Smith (named in a will perhaps) he was speaking of\nhimself, but he did not know this.\u201d If so, then \u2018speaking\nof\u2019 or \u2018referring to\u2019 oneself is compatible with not\nknowing that the object one speaks of is oneself. (TFP, 47)\n\n\nWe might then wish to say \u201cSmith can speak of himself without\nrealizing that he is speaking of himself.\u201d This shows\nthat there are two distinct kinds of reflexive pronouns: the ordinary\nreflexive pronoun and the indirect reflexive pronouns. The first\noccurrence of \u2018himself\u2019 immediately above is the ordinary\nreflexive pronoun, and it refers successfully just in case it picks\nout the same object as its antecedent. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhow it does so, nor must the antecedent and pronoun share a\nsense. When above we say \u201cSmith spoke of himself\u201d, we are\nusing the ordinary reflexive pronoun, for the person to whom Smith\nthereby referred was indeed the person who spoke.\n\nThings are different if we are tempted to say \u201cThe word\n\u2018I\u2019 is a word each of us uses in speaking of\nhimself.\u201d This use of \u2018himself\u2019 can\u2019t\nbe the ordinary reflexive, because, as we just saw, a person can speak\nof himself in cases where he wouldn\u2019t also use the word\n\u2018I\u2019 to refer to the same thing. The word\n\u2018himself\u2019 in this newer attempt at explaining the word\n\u2018I\u2019 gets its distinctive sense from that of the\nword \u2018I\u2019. But since the sense of the indirect reflexive\npronoun \u2018himself\u2019 depends upon that of the word\n\u2018I\u2019, we cannot use the indirect reflexive pronoun, as\nthough we understand it independently, to explain the word\n\u2018I\u2019. Things instead are the other way around. This\ndiscussion displays the problem that \u2018I\u2019 poses, but it\ndoesn\u2019t solve it.\n\nHow do we solve it? Anscombe thinks you can\u2019t. In the\nbulk of the paper, Anscombe argues that the word \u2018I\u2019\nisn\u2019t a referring expression in a few steps. First, she argues\nthat \u2018I\u2019 isn\u2019t like other referring expressions:\nproper names, other pronouns, demonstratives, definite descriptions,\nand so on. So we can\u2019t assimilate the use of the word\n\u201cI\u201d to other more tractable types of referring\nexpressions. Second, she argues that the only remaining possibility is\nthat the word \u201cI\u201d refers to an immaterial substance (a\nCartesian ego), or at least a stretch of such a substance that exists\nso long as one is thinking a thought. But that would still leave us no\nway to identify the same referent in different\n\u201cI\u201d-thoughts at different times, an\n\u201cintolerable\u201d result. Moreover, Anscombe explicitly denied\nthat there are immaterial substances. She described the very\nconception of an immaterial substance as \u201ca delusive one\u201d\n(IOS, 71).\n\nSo, having ruled out all the standard ways that terms refer, she\nconcludes that the function of the word \u2018I\u2019 is\nnon-referential. She says little about what its function is,\nalthough she notes that the word is dispensable \u2013 a language\nwhose verbs are conjugated to reflect what we call \u2018the first\nperson\u2019 (e.g. Latin, Spanish) can do without such a word. Her\nconclusion could be resisted if one produced a way of referring she\nhadn\u2019t considered, or if one rebutted any of her arguments\nagainst the possibilities she does consider. Important discussions of\nthis paper can be found in Doyle 2018, O\u2019Brien 1994, and many\nother places, and it has clearly inspired the work of R\u00f6dl\n2007.\n",
