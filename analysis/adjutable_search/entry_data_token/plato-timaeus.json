The universe, he proposes, is the product of\nrational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a\ndivine Craftsman (\u201cDemiurge,\u201d d\u00eamiourgos,\n28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes\nmathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordered\nuniverse (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of the\naccount is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its\nvarious parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good\neffects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome\nof the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),\nanthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who\nplans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature\npermits it to be.\n\nThe beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only the\nmanifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls to\nunderstand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restores\nthose souls to their original state of excellence, a state that was\nlost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical and\nreligious dimension to the discourse.\n\nThis picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial from\nthe start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and\nadmiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologians\nthrough the\n centuries.[1]\n Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as a\nmonologue\u2014by excluding exchanges between interlocutors the\ndiscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set of\nquestions to be investigated\u2014the Timaeus was generally\ntaken to be the culmination of its author\u2019s intellectual\nachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayal\nof the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons for\nits early translation into Latin. Calcidius\u2019 Latin translation\nin the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available in\nthe Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While it\nstill was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence began\nto wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlier\npart of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus was\nagain stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exact\nhistorical\n scholarship,[2]\n but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialogue\nwas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best and\nregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about the\ndevelopment of Plato\u2019s philosophy, but not much more. Recent\ndecades, however, have witnessed a strong revival of interest in the\nTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,\nand philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by the\ndialogue\u2019s bold claims, have been fascinated by its majestic\naccount and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate\nits conceptual structure.\n", "toc": [{"#OverDial": "1.

Overview of the Dialogue\n\nThe opening conversation (17a1\u201327d4) introduces the\ncharacters\u2014Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates\u2014and\nsuggests that the latter three would contribute to a reply to\nSocrates\u2019 speech allegedly given on the previous day, which\npresented an ideal political arrangement strongly reminiscent of the\n Republic.[3]\n This reply would start with an account of the creation of the\nuniverse down to the creation of human beings and, in a second step,\nshow an ideal society in motion. Critias is meant to provide the\nsecond step with his account of a war between ancient Athens and\nAtlantis, the beginning of which we find in Plato\u2019s\nCritias, while Timaeus is meant to deal with the first step\nin our dialogue. Timaeus begins the discourse (27d5\u201392c9) with a\nprologue (27d5\u201329d6) in which he sets out the metaphysical\nprinciples on which his account is based, introduces the figure of the\nCraftsman and his eternal model, and provides a brief comment on the\nstatus of the account he is about to provide. This prologue is\nfollowed by the discourse proper, which is uninterrupted to the end of\nthe dialogue (29d7\u201392c9). The discourse unfolds in three main\nstages: the first sets out the achievements of Intellect\n(29d7\u201347e2), the second gives an account of the effects of\nNecessity (47d3\u201369a5), and the third shows how Intellect and\nNecessity cooperate in the production of the psychophysical\nconstitution of human beings (69a6\u201392c9).\n\nThe first of the main sections of the discourse explains the existence\nof the universe and some of its most general features teleologically.\nThe universe exists and manifests goodness because it is the handiwork\nof a supremely good, ungrudging Craftsman, who brought order to an\ninitially disorderly state of affairs. It is a living thing\n(z\u00f4[i]on, also translatable as \u201canimal\u201d),\nbecause it is better for it to possess intelligence than to lack it,\nand the acquisition of intelligence requires the acquisition of soul.\nIt is complete, and thus it includes within itself all the species of\nliving things as its parts. It is unique, because its model is unique;\nthe uniqueness of the model follows from its completeness. The\nworld\u2019s body is composed of fire (for visibility) and earth (for\ntangibility), but these so-called elements require the mediation of\nair and water in a progression of proportion to bind them together\ninto a unified, concordant whole. The shape of the universe\u2019s\nbody\u2014a sphere\u2014and the characteristics it possesses or\nlacks are all explained in terms of their various purposes. The\ncomposition of the world\u2019s soul out of a harmonically\nproportionate series of portions of a mixture of both divisible and\nindivisible Sameness, Difference and Being, and the division of these\nportions into two intersecting circles (called the circle of the Same\nand of the Different) explain the cognitive powers of the soul in\nrelation to the different types of objects of cognition: those that\nare and those that become. When joined with the world\u2019s body,\nthey also explain the cosmological organization of the universe. The\nheavenly bodies are divine and move in their various orbits to serve\nas markers of time: the fixed stars to mark a day/night, the moon to\nmark the (lunar) month and the sun to mark the year. Time itself came\ninto being together with these celestial movements as an \u201cimage\nof\n eternity.\u201d[4]\n Individual souls are made up of the residue (and an inferior grade)\nof the soul stuff of the universe, and are eventually embodied in\nphysical bodies. This embodiment throws the previously regular motions\nof the soul into confusion as the soul is subjected to the forceful\ndisturbances of internal bodily processes as well as the impact of\nexternal bodies upon it, particularly in sense experience. These\ndisturbances gravely impair the soul\u2019s cognitive functioning;\nonly with appropriate nurture and education can its original motions\nbe reestablished and proper cognitive functioning be restored. The\nbody and its parts were designed to support that functioning, and\nTimaeus takes the design of the eyes and the mechanics of vision as an\nimportant case in point.\n\nTimaeus prepares for the transition to the second main part of his\ndiscourse by pointing out that while a causal story of the sort he has\nbeen telling so far is indeed concerned with what is properly the\ncause (aitia) of the universe\u2019s generation, that story\nis not by itself sufficient and must extend to an account of\n\u201ccontributing causes\u201d (sunaitiai or\nsummetraitiai, 46c7, 46e6, 68e4\u20135) as well. The\ndiscourse must provide an account of the various physical structures\nthat are necessary for and support the achievement of the purposes of\nIntellect. The properties possessed by these various structures are\ndetermined by their constitutions as a matter of\n\u201cNecessity,\u201d and it is not open to the Craftsman to change\nor eliminate the properties of these structures. The properties allow\n(or disallow) certain processes desirable to the Craftsman, and to the\nextent that Intellect achieves its desiderata, it succeeds in\n\u201cpersuading\u201d Necessity (48a2\u20135). It is the role of\nthe second major part of the discourse to set forth these contributing\ncauses.\n\nThe second main section begins with the introduction of the\nreceptacle, a \u201cthird kind\u201d alongside the familiar\nparadigmatic forms and the generated images of the forms\n(49a1\u20134, 52a8, d2\u20134). The receptacle has been seen as\nserving either as material substratum or as some form of space or as\ncombining both roles. Timaeus\u2019 account of the receptacle\npresents several interpretive difficulties, some of which will be\ndiscussed below. In the \u201cpre-cosmic\u201d state (the state\n\u201cprior to\u201d the intervention of the Craftsman) the\nreceptacle is subject to erratic and disorderly motions, and moves its\ncontents in turn. Its contents are mere \u201ctraces\u201d\n(ichn\u00ea, 53b2) of the subsequently articulated four\n\u201ckinds\u201d (the so-called \u201celements\u201d): fire, air, water and earth. Each\nof these four kinds is made up of geometrical bodies\u2014fire of\ntetrahedra, air of octahedra, water of icosahedra, and earth of cubes.\nThe Craftsman begins by constructing these four regular solids as the\nprimary corpuscles of each of the four kinds. These solids have faces\nthat are made up (ultimately) of two types of right-angled\ntriangles\u2014the half-equilateral and the isosceles\u2014and it is\nthese triangles that are the \u201csimples\u201d of the physics of\nthe dialogue. Because their triangles are similar (half-equilateral),\nonly corpuscles of fire, air and water may be transformed into one\nanother; while corpuscles of earth are made up of isosceles triangles\nand are thus excluded from such transformations. Each of the four\nkinds has properties that are determined by the constitution of their\nrespective corpuscles, and these properties in turn determine how the\nparticles act upon and react to one another. These actions and\nreactions are ongoing and perpetuate a state of non-uniformity which\nitself is a necessary condition for motion, i.e., the continuation of\nthe interactions. Although each of the four kinds has a tendency to\nmove toward its own region of space, their being squeezed together in\na spherical universe without any gaps leads to the inevitable\ntransformations that occur when their various corpuscles cut or crush\none another. Thus it is assured that these migrations are never\ncompleted in the sense that there would be a complete separation of\nthe four elements into separate regions. The account proceeds to\nexplain the various varieties of each of the four kinds, and the\nsensible properties that they and their compounds manifest. An account\nof sensible properties calls for a preliminary account of sensation\n(including pleasure and pain), and it is with that preliminary account\nthat this section of the discourse concludes.\n\nThe third main section of the discourse\u2014about the cooperation of\nIntellect with Necessity\u2014focuses primarily on the psychophysical\nconstruction of the human being. While the Craftsman has created the\nindividual souls, he delegates the creation of the human bodies to the\nlesser, created gods. As individual immortal (and rational) souls are\nembodied in mortal bodies, the embodiment requires the further\ncreation of the \u201cmortal\u201d parts of the soul\u2014the\nspirited and appetitive parts, familiar from the Republic and\nthe Phaedrus. These parts are assigned their respective\nlocations in the body: the immortal and rational soul in the head, and\nthe two parts of the mortal soul in the trunk: the spirited part in\nthe chest (nearer to the head) and the appetitive part in the belly.\nThe various organs in the trunk\u2014the lungs and heart in the chest\nand the liver in the belly\u2014support the functions of their\nresident soul parts. The account proceeds to describe the formation of\nthe various bodily parts, setting out in each case the purpose of the\npart in question and showing how its construction (out of the\nappropriately selected materials) serves that purpose. The purpose is\nprescribed by Intellect, and the properties of the\nmaterials\u2014selected because their properties render them\ncompliant to Intellect\u2019s purposes\u2014are the consequences\n(and thus contributions) of Necessity. For the most part, Necessity\nserves the purposes of Intellect well, but this is not always the\ncase. A notable example of them coming apart is the covering around\nthe brain. That covering needs to be massive to provide maximal\nprotection, but that very massiveness would impede sensation, and so a\npreferential choice must be made between the conflicting demands. Such\noccasional cases of resistance by Necessity to the\n\u201cpersuasion\u201d of Intellect limit the degree of excellence\nthe created world can attain. Timaeus\u2019 discourse moves on with\nan account of the mechanisms of respiration and digestion, and a\nclassification and etiological discussion of various diseases of both\nbody and soul. This is preparatory to an exhortation to properly\nexercise both the soul and the body to recover or maintain physical\nand psychic well being. The well being of the soul in particular is\nemphasized: it is through realigning the motions of our souls with\nthose of the universe at large that we achieve our goal of living\nvirtuously and happily. The discourse concludes with an account of the\ngeneration of women and non-human animals.\n2. An Interpretive Question\n\nEver since Aristotle rejected the cosmology of the Timaeus on\nthe ground that it required not just a beginning of the universe in\ntime, but a beginning of time itself (Physics\n251b14\u201326), defenders of the dialogue\u2014perhaps wishing\nto neutralize Aristotle\u2019s critique while conceding that the\nassumption of a beginning of time is problematic\u2014have claimed\nthat the creation story is not to be read literally, but\n metaphorically.[5]\n This metaphorical reading of the dialogue became the prevailing\n(though not exclusive) view among Platonists, from the Old Academy of\nPlato\u2019s immediate successors to Plotinus (third cent. CE). The\nquestion of how literally the creation story is to be interpreted\nremains an intriguing one that continues to interest (and divide)\nscholars to this day: if we follow the metaphorical interpretation, we\nwill read the account not as a process by which an intelligent\nCraftsman put the world together at some time in the past, but as a\nstatement of the principles that underlie the universe at all times of\nits existence. Key questions raised by this issue include the\nfollowing: (1) Is Intellect (personified by the Craftsman) literally\nan intelligent agent of some sort, an entity that is ontologically\ndistinct from both the model and its copy, or can the Craftsman be\nidentified with some aspect of either the copy or the model\u2014the\nworld soul, for example, or one or other of the forms\u2014and thus\nbe reducible to something else? (On this question, see more below,\nunder \u201cTeleology.\u201d) (2) How do we understand the relation\nof the \u201cpre-cosmic\u201d state of the universe to its finished\nstate? The account posits that pre-cosmic state \u201cbefore\u201d\nthe creative process by which the ordered universe comes into being.\nBut if there is no time apart from the measured celestial motions, how\nis that \u201cbefore\u201d to be understood? (3) If the creation\nstory is read literally, is it consistent with Plato\u2019s views on\nrelated subjects set forth in other dialogues?\n [6]\n3. Relation of the Timaeus to other Platonic Dialogues\n\nThe question of the place of the Timaeus relative to the\nother dialogues has given rise to an acrimonious but nevertheless\nfruitful debate, with far-ranging implications for our assessment of\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. In 1953, G. E. L. Owen published a\nprovocative article that challenged the orthodox view of the\nTimaeus as a work written during Plato\u2019s so called\n\u201clate\u201d period, and argued that it should be regarded as a\nmiddle dialogue instead, composed prior to the Theaetetus and\nthe Parmenides. Owen claimed to see in the Timaeus a\nreassertion of several metaphysical views familiar from the\nRepublic but (on the reading proposed by Owen) subsequently\nexposed for refutation in these two dialogues, both of which on the\northodox view precede the Timaeus. The orthodox view was\nbased on long-standing tradition, but had been confirmed by the\nstylometric studies of Plato\u2019s writings undertaken by late\nnineteenth- and early twentieth-century philologists. Owen called into\nquestion the assumptions and the results of these studies. Four years\nlater Owen\u2019s criticism of stylometry, as well as his\ninterpretation of the relevant arguments in the Theaetetus\nand the Parmenides, were in turn vigorously if not\nrancorously disputed by H. F. Cherniss in defense of the traditional\nview (Cherniss 1965, 1977). This debate between these two scholars of\nrenown whose approaches to the study of Plato\u2019s dialogues were\nso markedly different did much to bring a new level of acuity to the\nanalysis of Platonic texts. Over time the orthodox view appears to\nhave held its own. Both a more nuanced examination of the texts and\nmore recent computer-assisted stylometric studies have done much to\nreinforce\n it.[7]\n\nThe opening of the Timaeus, depicting it as a sequel to a\nconversation about the ideal city-state that resembles the\nkallipolis of the Republic in important points,\nconnects the project announced in the Timaeus to the\nRepublic. This opening also presents the Critias as\na sequel to the Timaeus. And Socrates\u2019 request in the\nPhaedo to provide teleological causes for the explanation of\nthe world, instead of the material causes employed in the cosmologies\nof the Presocratics (97b-99b), is answered by Timaeus\u2019\naccount of the rational cause of the universe (the Timaeus,\nhowever, points out that the material causes of the Phaedo\nalso have to be considered in order to explain the perceptible world).\n\n4. The Status of the Account\n\nIn his prefatory remarks Timaeus describes the account he is about to\ngive as a \u201clikely account\u201d (eik\u00f4s logos) or\n\u201clikely story\u201d (eik\u00f4s\n muthos).[8]\n The description is a play on words: the subject of the account is\nitself an \u201cimage\u201d (eik\u00f4n) and, Timaeus\navers, \u201cthe accounts we give of things [should] have the same\ncharacter as the subjects they set forth\u201d (29b3\u20135).\nFashioned after an unchanging and eternal model\u2014a possible\nsubject of a definitive and exact account\u2014the universe as a\nthing that becomes is shifting and unstable, and hence any account\ngiven of it will be similarly lacking in complete accuracy and\nconsistency (29c4\u20137). This may be read as lowering our\nexpectations\u2014the account is no more than likely. At the same\ntime, Timaeus says he will strive to give an account that is \u201cno\nless likely than anyone else\u2019s\u201d (or \u201cany other\n[account]\u201d) (29c7\u20138) and, while the account cannot be\ngrasped by understanding (nous, 29b6\u2014the faculty for\napprehending unchanging truths), it nevertheless merits our\n\u201cbelief\u201d (pistis, 29c3) and fulfills certain\nstandards. As Timaeus\u2019 account proceeds, we are frequently\nreminded of its \u201clikely\u201d\n character,[9]\n and both the negative and positive connotations of that\ncharacterization should be kept in mind.\n\nThe account, then, is presented as reasonable, thus meriting our\nbelief, but neither definitive nor complete (cf. 68b6\u20138), and\nthus open to possible revision (cf. 54b1\u20132, 55d4\u20136). A\ndefinitive account of these matters eludes humans (29d1) and is\navailable only to a god \u201cand those human beings dear to\nhim\u201d\n (53d4\u20137).[10]\n It has sometimes been argued that the qualification of the account as\n\u201cmerely likely\u201d supports a metaphorical reading of the\ncosmology. This, however, is a mistake; it is not easy to see how the\ndistinction between an exact and definitive versus a reliable but\nrevisable account maps on to the distinction between a literal versus\na metaphorical account. The contrast should rather be seen as one\nbetween apodeictic certainty (about intelligible matters) and\n plausibility[11]\n (about empirical matters). To the extent that the subject of the\naccount is a thing that becomes rather than a thing that is, as well\nas a thing that is perceptible rather than a thing that is\nintelligible, the account will be no more than likely. To the extent\nthat it is beautiful and ordered, modeled after a perfect reality and\nfashioned by a most excellent maker, the account will be no less than\nlikely.\n5. Being and Becoming\n\nThe account Timaeus gives of the generation of the universe is from\nthe outset based on metaphysical and epistemological principles\nfamiliar from the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period,\nparticularly the Republic. Introducing the subject of his\ndiscourse, Timaeus posits a distinction between what always is and\nnever becomes and what becomes and never is\n(27d5\u201328a1). He goes on to connect each with its familiar\nepistemological correlate (28a1\u20134): the former is grasped by\nunderstanding (no\u00easis) involving a reasoned account\n(logos), and the latter by opinion (doxa), which\ninvolves unreasoning sense perception (aesth\u00easis\nalogos). Although Timaeus does not here name the types of entity\nthat satisfy these descriptions, the reader familiar with the\nRepublic will call to mind the distinction between forms and\nsensibles (518c, 534a). The role of what is as the model\nafter which the Craftsman designs and constructs the universe (29a)\nrecalls the role of the forms as models for the philosopher-rulers to\nimitate in exercising their statecraft (Rep.\n500b\u2013501c). It is not until much later in Timaeus\u2019\ndiscourse (51b7\u2013e6) that forms are mentioned for the first time,\nand their existence is argued for on the basis of the distinction\n(itself supported by argument) between understanding and (true)\nopinion. And the identification of what becomes with\nsensibles (in this case the universe as an object of sense) is readily\nmade at 28b7\u2013c2 (see 5. in the argument below).\n\nTimaeus\u2019 opening question (\u201cWhat is that which always\nis and never becomes\u2026?\u201d) can be read\nextensionally (\u201cWhat entity or entities are such that they\nalways are and never become\u2026?\u201d) or\nintensionally (\u201cWhat is it for some entity always to be\nand never to become\u2026?\u201d). If read in the former\nway, the answer will be \u201cforms\u201d or \u201ca form.\u201d\nIf read in the latter way, the question is answered immediately in the\ntext \u00a0and hence this reading seems preferable : always to be is\nto be intelligible and unchanging.\n\nThe metaphysical being-becoming distinction and its epistemological\ncorrelate are put to work in an argument that establishes the\nframework for the cosmology to follow. The conclusion of that argument\nis that the universe is a work of craft, produced by a supremely good\nCraftsman in imitation of an eternal model. The reasoning may be\nrepresented as follows:\n\nSome things always are, without ever becoming (27d6).\nSome things become, without ever being (27d6\u201328a1).\nIf and only if a thing always is, then it is grasped by\nunderstanding, involving a rational account (28a1\u20132).\nIf and only if a thing becomes, then it is grasped by opinion,\ninvolving unreasoning sense perception\n (28a2\u20133).[12]\nThe universe is a thing that has become (28b7; from 5a\u2013c,\nand 4).\n\n\nThe universe is visible, tangible and possesses a body\n(28b7\u20138).\nIf a thing is visible, tangible and possesses a body, then it is\nperceptible (28b8).\nIf a thing is perceptible, then it has become (28c1\u20132; also\nentailed by 4).\n \nAnything that becomes is caused to become by something\n(28a4\u20136, c2\u20133).\nThe universe has been caused to become by something (from 5 and\n6).\nThe cause of the universe is a Craftsman, who fashioned the\nuniverse after a model (28a6 ff., c3 ff.; apparently from 7, but see\nbelow).\nThe model of the universe is something that always is\n(29a4\u20135; from 9a\u20139e).\n\n\nEither the model of the universe is something that always is or\nsomething that has become (28a5\u201329a2, also implied at\n28a6\u2013b2).\nIf the universe is beautiful and the Craftsman is good, then the\nmodel of the universe is something that always is (29a2\u20133).\nIf the universe is not beautiful or the Craftsman is not good,\nthen the model of the universe is something that has become\n(29a3\u20135).\nThe universe is supremely beautiful (29a5).\nThe Craftsman is supremely good (29a6).\n \nThe universe is a work of craft, fashioned after an eternal model\n(29a6\u2013b1; from 8 and 9).\n\n\nGiven familiar Platonic doctrines and assumptions, the argument up to\nthe intermediate conclusion that the universe has a cause of its\nbecoming (7) presents no particular difficulties. But 7 by itself\ngives only partial support to\n 8.[13]\n Here it helps to anticipate 9d as a fundamental premise in\nTimaeus\u2019 reasoning; it is not just the generation of any world,\nbut that of a supremely beautiful one that Timaeus\u2019 reasoning\nhere\u2014and in fact throughout the discourse\u2014attempts to\nexplain. That a world as beautiful as ours might be the effect of an\nunintelligent cause is a possibility that Plato does not discuss.\n\nOnce the conclusion that the universe is teleologically structured is\nsettled, the explanatory methodology of the discourse proceeds\naccordingly. The question that frames the inquiry is not the question:\nWhat best explains this or that observed feature of the world? It is\nrather the question: Given that the world as a whole is the best\npossible one within the constraints of becoming and of Necessity, what\nsorts of features should we expect the world to have? This question\ninvites a priori answers, and Timaeus\u2019 arguments about the most\ngeneral features of the universe as a whole (for example, why it\nexists, why it is alive and intelligent, why it is unique, why it is\nshaped and composed as it is) are derived wholly a priori. The answers\nto these questions are not open to empirical confirmation. But clearly\nthe inquiry is also constrained by features of the universe that are\nactually observed, and this gives rise, secondly, to questions about\nthe good purposes that are being served by these features (for\nexample, the motions of the heavenly bodies, the psychophysical\nconstitutions of human beings, etc.), and how the features in question\naccomplish those purposes. For the most part there is a happy\ncoincidence between the features that are required (in answer to the\nfirst question), and the features that are actually observed (in\nanswer to the second), and it is part of the genius of the discourse\nthat these are so well woven together. Occasionally, however, the\nmethodology leads to conclusions apparently at odds with\nobservation\u2014for example, the exemption of earth from\ninter-elemental transformation (see further under\n\u201cPhysics\u201d\n below).[14]\n\nThe model that serves the Craftsman is regularly named the\n\u201cLiving Thing (Itself),\u201d and this is either a form, or an\nappropriately organized constellation of forms. It is the Ideal (or\nbetter: Real) Universe; the object of what Plato had called\n\u201creal astronomy\u201d (as opposed to empirical astronomy) in\nthe Republic (527d\u2013531d, esp. 530a3). The Craftsman\ndoes not\u2014indeed logically cannot\u2014copy by replicating the\nLiving Thing; his challenge rather lies in crafting an image of it\nthat is subject to the constraints of becoming: unlike the model, it\nmust be visible and tangible (28b7), hence three-dimensional\n(solid\u2014stereoeid\u00ea, 32b1). This constraint in turn\nrequires the postulation of something three-dimensional in\nwhich the created universe may subsist, what Timaeus initially\nnames the \u201creceptacle (hupodoch\u00ea) of all\nbecoming\u201d (49a5\u20136) and subsequently calls\n\u201cspace\u201d (ch\u00f4ra, 52a8, d3).\n\nThe imitative activity of the Craftsman, who forms the universe as an\nimitation of an eternal model, is unlike that of a builder who\nreplicates a larger- or smaller-scale three-dimensional structure as\nmodel, but like that of a builder who follows a set of instructions or\nschematics. That set is the intelligible, non-material and non-spatial\nmodel that prescribes the features of the structure to be built; it is\nnot a structure itself. It is a matter of debate whether Plato\u2019s\nmiddle-period metaphysics included the view that forms were, or\nexhibited, some grander, unalloyed version of some of the properties\nexhibited by sensible objects. Arguably such a view (call it\n\u201ccrude paradeigmatism\u201d) was refuted by the \u201cThird\nMan\u201d argument of the Parmenides (132a). As invisible,\nintangible, and non-spatial entities forms are excluded from\npossessing properties that only visible, tangible and spatial object\nmay possess. Nevertheless, in so far as they are or exhibit\nintelligible natures forms may, like a set of instructions or\nschematics, serve as models to be \u201clooked at\u201d (28a7, 29a3)\nby anyone who understands those natures and is in a position to\nconstruct a world in accordance with them. (This view of the\nCraftsman\u2019s imitative activity might by contrast be described as\n\u201crefined\n paradeigmatism.\u201d[15])\n6. The Receptacle\n\nTimaeus introduces the receptacle as a \u201cthird kind\u201d\n(triton genos, 48e4) alongside forms and their imitations. He\napologizes for the obscurity of the concept, and attempts to explicate\nits role by means of a series of analogies: it is variously compared\nto a lump of gold (50a4\u2013b5), a mother that together with a\nfather produces offspring (50d2\u20134, 51a4\u20135), a plastic,\nimpressionable stuff (50c2\u20136, e7\u201351a1), and an ointment\nthat serves as a neutral base for various fragrances (50e5\u20138).\nThese images suggest that it is devoid of any characteristics in its\nown right (except those formal characteristics necessary to its role,\nsuch as malleability). The receptacle is posited as the solution to a\nproblem: none of the observable particulars persists as this or that\n(for example as fire or water) over time. We observe the very thing\nthat is fire at one time becoming air, and subsequently becoming\nwater, etc., \u201ctransmitting their becoming to one another in a\ncycle, so it seems\u201d (49c6\u20137). Thus the thing that appears\nas fire here and now is not fire in its own right: its fieriness is\nonly a temporary characterization of it. What, then, is that thing in\nits own right? In a difficult and controversial passage Timaeus\nproposes a\n solution:[16]\n In its own right it is (part of) a totally characterless subject that\ntemporarily in its various parts gets characterized in various ways.\nThis is the receptacle\u2014an enduring substratum, neutral in itself\nbut temporarily taking on the various characterizations through traces\nof the four elements in it. The observed particulars just are parts of\nthat receptacle so characterized (51b4\u20136).\n\nThe above analogies may be seen as suggesting that the receptacle is a\nmaterial substratum: as gold qua gold is the material substratum for\nthe various geometrical configurations it is shaped into, the ointment\nbase for the fragrances, or the impressionable stuff for the various\nimpressions, so the receptacle serves as the \u201cstuff\u201d that\ngets characterized in various ways. But Timaeus does not use any\ndescriptive word that can suitably be translated as\n\u201cmatter\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d; he does, however, use\nthe word, \u201cspace\u201d (ch\u00f4ra). And its function\nof providing a \u201cseat\u201d (hedra, 52b1) reinforces\nthe conception that its role is to provide a spatial location for the\nthings that enter it and disappear from it (49e7\u20138,\n50c4\u20135, 52a4\u20136).\n\nThere has been considerable discussion about whether the receptacle is\nto be thought of as matter, or as space, and whether it is possible to\nthink of it coherently as having both of those roles. And there is\nalso ongoing disagreement about the nature of the entities that are\nsaid to enter into and disappear from the receptacle. They are clearly\nnot forms (52a4). Some interpreters have suggested that these are\ncharacter types (or character tokens) derived from the forms, and that\nthese types (or tokens) are properly the form copies\n(mim\u00eamata) that have a prominent place in the argument\nfor the receptacle (49c7\u201350a4). Whatever the merits of this\nreading, the things the receptacle is said to \u201creceive\u201d\nare \u201call the bodies (s\u00f4mata)\u201d (50b6).\nBodies are three-dimensional entities, and this makes it likely that\nit is the emergence and disappearance of the variously characterized\nobservable particulars as such, and not their properties (types or\ntokens), that are mentioned in these passages (49e7\u20138,\n50c4\u20135, 52a4\u20136). But the particular bodies have a\ngeometrical underpinning\u2014the four \u201celements\u201d,\nwhich are the building blocks of the physical world, are made up of\nthe so-called Platonic solids; and these solids, in turn, are made up\nof two kinds of triangles (cf. below). \n\nThe complete metaphysical scheme of the Timaeus that is summed up at\n50c7\u2013d4 and again at 52a1\u2013b5 is thus as follows: (i) the\neternal and unchanging forms, the \u201cmodel,\u201d or\n\u201cfather\u201d; (ii) the receptacle, or \u201cmother,\u201d\nand (iii) the copies of the model or \u201coffspring\u201d of the\nfather and the mother. These three are the components of Plato\u2019s\nanalysis; they are not three ontologically distinct ingredients. The\nreceptacle is introduced not as a distinct entity newly superadded to\nparticulars and forms, but as a new and essential component in the\nanalysis of what it is to be a spatio-temporal particular. What is\nmissing from that analysis, however, is any mention of character types\nor tokens, and while later philosophers might see a use for such\nconcepts in elucidating the metaphysical scheme of the\nTimaeus, it is not clear that Plato himself makes any use of\nthem there.\n\nThe introduction of the receptacle is an important innovation in\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics, and clearly a development that takes him\nbeyond the metaphysics of the middle\n dialogues.[17]\n Little attention was given in those dialogues to the question of what\nit is to be a sensible particular (other than being something that\nparticipates in forms), or what is required of particulars to be such\nthat forms may be exemplified in them. In order to be effective in\ntheir role of exemplifying forms, particulars must possess certain\ngeneral characteristics qua particulars: they must be spatially\nextended and spatially situated, and they must be constituted of some\nindeterminate but determinable \u201cstuff\u201d that is subject to\ndetermination by way of participating in forms. Although the\nreceptacle does not appear by name in any other of the later\ndialogues, it clearly has affinities to the concept of the\napeiron (indefinite or indeterminate) of the metaphysical\nscheme in the Philebus. It is impossible, however, to\ndetermine the chronological relation between these two dialogues with\ncertainty (see note 7), and thus impossible to infer which of the two\nschemes Plato might have thought to be the more definitive.\n7. Teleology\n\nMany commentators on the Timaeus have pointed out that the\nteleological account set out in the Timaeus is the\nfulfillment of a quest for teleological explanations related in the\nPhaedo (see, e.g., Strange 1999). In that dialogue the\ncharacter Socrates describes his foray into causal questions in the\nrealm of natural science and recounts both his high expectations of\nand disappointment with Anaxagoras\u2019 concept of Intellect\n(nous) as providing the true cause of natural phenomena.\nSocrates expected the use Anaxagoras made of Intellect to provide\nteleological explanations; instead, Anaxagoras employed the concept to\nprovide the same sort of causal explanation\u2014in terms of physical\ninteractions\u2014that Socrates had found confusing. Continuing to\nhope for teleological causal explanations but finding them elusive,\nSocrates settles for a second best account: offering causal\nexplanations in terms of participation in Forms (Phaedo 99c6\nff.).\n\nIt is not entirely clear by what avenue of reasoning Plato found what\nhis character Socrates failed to find in the Phaedo, but it\nis reasonable to assume that the role of the form of the Good,\nintroduced in the Republic, assisted in the discovery.\nAlthough the character Socrates in that dialogue declines to offer an\naccount of the nature of the Good, it is not unreasonable to connect\nthat form, as some have done, with rational, mathematical\n order.[18]\n Such order as the expression of goodness is arguably for Plato the\nultimate metaphysical datum; forms other than the Good are good in so\nfar as they possess such intelligible order, and they do so perfectly.\nSensibles are good in so far as they participate in these forms,\nthough they fail to do so completely. What is left to be explained,\nthen, is how such order is manifested in the visible universe, however\nimperfectly. The explanation offered in the Timaeus is that\norder is not inherent in the spatio-material universe; it is imposed\nby Intellect, as represented by the Craftsman.\n\nWhile the figure of the Craftsman seems to be an anthropomorphic\nrepresentation of\n Intellect,[19]\n it remains to ask what the ontological status of Intellect is, in\nrelation to the division between being and becoming\u2014a\ndistinction that appears to be exhaustive. Some interpreters, relying\non Timaeus\u2019 claim (at 30b3) that intellect cannot become present\nto anything apart from soul, have argued that Intellect is (part of)\nthe world\u2019s\n soul.[20]\n This cannot be correct: like the rest of becoming, the world\u2019s\nsoul is a product of the Craftsman, and hence neither it nor anything\nelse on the side of becoming can be identified with Intellect.\nAlternatively, either Intellect is a form, or the distinction between\nbeing and becoming is not exhaustive. Some have argued that Intellect\nis to be identified with the entire realm of\n forms,[21]\n or the form of the\n Good,[22]\n while others, understanding \u201cnous\u201d to name a\nvirtue, have opted for the form of Intelligence (a substance in virtue\nof its status as a\n form).[23]\n More recently, it has been suggested that the figure of the Craftsman\nis a personification of\n craftsmanship.[24]\n None of these accounts seem adequate either: if Intellect were a form\nof any kind, it would be an intelligible object, not a subject that\npossesses cognition and efficient causal\n agency.[25]\n Intellect, then, cannot be placed either on the side of being or on\nthat of becoming, and that dichotomy is thus not\n exhaustive.[26]\n It is reasonable to conclude that Intellect is a sui generis\nsubstance that transcends the metaphysical dichotomy of being and\nbecoming\u2014possibly not unlike the Abrahamic conception of\n God.[27]\n\nThe teleology of the Timaeus may be usefully compared to that\nof Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature. What is immediately\nstriking in that comparison is the absence from Aristotle\u2019s\nnatural philosophy of a purposive, designing causal agent that\ntranscends nature. Aristotelian final causes in the formation of\norganisms and the structures of the natural world are said to be\nimmanent in nature (i.e., the nature or \u201cform\u201d of the\norganism or structure) itself: it is not a divine Craftsman but nature\nitself that is said to act\n purposively.[28]\n Such an immanent teleology will not be an option for Plato.\nAristotle\u2019s teleology is local, with no more than a few hints at\na global level : while it makes sense to ask Aristotle for a\nteleological explanation of this or that feature of the natural world,\nit makes little sense to ask him for a teleological explanation of the\nworld as a whole. Moreover, for Aristotle the development of an\nindividual member of a species is determined by the form it has\ninherited from its (male) parent: the goal of the developing\nindividual is to fully actualize that form. For Plato the primeval\nchaotic stuff of the universe has no inherent preexisting form that\ngoverns some course of natural development toward the achievement of\nsome goal, and so the explanatory cause of its orderliness must be\nexternal to any features that such stuff may possess.\n8. Physics\n\nWhile the receptacle has an obvious metaphysical role in the\nTimaeus, its primary role after its introduction is in the\nphysical theory of the dialogue. The argument from 47e3 to 52d4\nprepares the ground for both the spatial matrix in which to situate,\nand the material substratum from which to constitute, the universe\nthat he will fashion after its eternal model. The fashioning, however,\nis the process of bringing order to what was, prior to and apart from\nthe Craftsman\u2019s intervention, a thoroughly disorderly state of\naffairs, and so the physical account begins with a description of that\ndisorderly, \u201cgod-forsaken\u201d (53b3\u20134) initial\nstate.\n\nIn that state, dramatically described at 52d4\u201353c3, the filled\nspace that is the receptacle undergoes constant, erratic motion: it is\nsubject to forces (dunameis, 52e2) that are dissimilar to and\nout of balance with each other, and thus, as each spastic movement\nproduces its chain of spastic reactions, it is perpetually unstable\n(52e1\u20135). These motions may accidentally produce manifestations\nthat to a would-be observer look like fire or any of the so-called\nfour elements, or \u201ckinds\u201d (gen\u00ea). Timaeus\ncalls these manifestations \u201ctraces\u201d (53b2) of the four\nkinds, and states that even as inarticulate traces, they tended to\nbehave in the ways in which the subsequently articulated kinds would\ncome to behave by necessity: each trace type would gather to its own\nregion, with the heavier to one region and the lighter to another.\nThese migrations are the effect of the ceaseless agitation of the\nreceptacle, which acts like a \u201cwinnowing sieve\u201d (52e6),\nseparating the heavy from the light. The result is a pre-cosmic\ninchoate stratification of these traces, which anticipates the\n(perpetually incomplete, 58a2\u2013c4) stratification of the finished\nuniverse.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements for the construction of the body\nof the universe previously set out at 31b4\u201332c4, the Craftsman\nbegins by fashioning each of the four kinds \u201cto be as perfect\nand excellent as possible\u2026\u201d (53b5\u20136). He selects as\nthe basic corpuscles (s\u00f4mata, \u201cbodies\u201d)\nfour of the five regular solids: the tetrahedron for fire, the\noctahedron for air, the icosahedron for water, and the cube for earth.\n(The remaining regular solid, the dodecahedron, is \u201cused for the\nuniverse as a whole,\u201d [55c4\u20136], since it approaches most\nnearly the shape of a sphere.) The faces of the first three of these\nare composed of equilateral triangles, and each face is itself\ncomposed of six elemental (scalene) half equilateral right-angled\ntriangles, whose sides are in a proportion of 1:\u221a3:2. Timaeus\ndoes not say why each face is composed of six such triangles, when in\nfact two, joined at the longer of the two sides that contain the right\nangle, will more simply constitute an equilateral triangle. The faces\nof the cube are squares composed of four elemental isosceles\nright-angled triangles and again, it is not clear why four should be\npreferred to two. Given that every right-angled triangle is infinitely\ndivisible into two triangles of it own type (by dropping a\nperpendicular from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse, the\nresulting two smaller right triangles are both similar to the original\ntriangle) the equilateral or square faces of the solids and thus the\nstereometric solids themselves have no minimal size. Possibly, then,\nthe choice of six component triangles for the equilateral and four for\nthe square is intended to prevent the solid particles from becoming\nvanishingly\n small.[29]\n\nSince each of the first three of the regular solids has equilateral\nfaces, it is possible for any fire, air or water corpuscles to come\napart in their interactions\u2014they cut or crush each\nother\u2014and their faces be reconstituted into corpuscles of one of\nthe two other sorts, depending on the numbers of faces of the basic\ncorpuscles involved. For example, two fire corpuscles could be\ntransformed into a single air corpuscle, or one air corpuscle into two\nfire corpuscles, given that the tetrahedron has four faces and the\noctahedron eight (other examples are given at 56d6\u2013e7). In this\nway Timaeus explains the intertransformation that can occur among\nfire, air and water. On the other hand, while the faces of the cube\nparticles may also come apart, they can only be reconstituted as cubes\nsince they are based on isosceles right-angled triangles; and so earth\nundergoes no intertransformation with the other\n three.[30]\n Having established the construction and interaction of the basic\nparticles, Timaeus continues the physical account of the discourse\nwith a series of applications: differences among varieties of each of\nthe primary bodies are explained by differences in the sizes of the\nconstituent particles (some varieties consisting of particles of\ndifferent sizes), and compounds are distinguished by their\ncombinations of both different sorts and different sizes of particles.\nThese various arrangements explain the perceptible properties\npossessed by the varieties of primary bodies and their compounds. An\nobject\u2019s particular arrangement of triangles produces a\nparticular kind of \u201cdisturbance\u201d or\n\u201cexperience\u201d (pathos) in the perceiving subject,\nso that the object is perceived as having this or that perceptible\nproperty.\n\nIt is a fair question to ask how the physics of the discourse relates\nto its metaphysics\u2014for example, how the perceptible properties\nof observable instances of fire (its brightness, lightness and heat,\nlet us say) relate to the form of Fire, an intelligible reality that\nhas no perceptible properties at all. The form of Fire is the\nnon-spatial, non-material, non-perceptible intelligible, eternal and\nunchanging nature of fire that the Craftsman \u201cimitates,\u201d\nand in so doing produces spatially extended, material, perceptible,\ntransient and variable instances of fire. Although we are not told\nwhat it is about the nature of fire that requires observable instances\nof it to have just these properties, it is presumably that knowledge\nthat guides the Craftsman to select and assign the four regular solids\nas he does. Given that the nature of fire is such that any\n\u201cimitations\u201d of it that appear in the Receptacle must be\nperceptible as bright, light and hot, the type of solid body that best\nsupports these properties\u2014the tetrahedron, it turns\nout\u2014should be assigned to fire. And so with the other three\nkinds (see 55d7\u201356c7).\n9. Ethics\n\nPlato inherited from Socrates the conviction that knowledge of\ngoodness has a salvific effect upon human life. That knowledge\nremained elusive to Socrates. As Plato continues the Socratic quest,\nhe expands the scope of the search beyond ethical matters. In the\nPhaedo, as we saw earlier, the character Socrates expresses\nthe conviction that goodness is the true cause (aitia) of the\nbeneficent arrangement of the natural world, though the nature of\ngoodness continues to elude him as well. The causal supremacy of\ngoodness is recognized in the metaphysical and epistemological roles\nassigned to the Republic\u2019s form of the Good, and it is\nthe understanding of that form that constitutes the culmination of the\neducation of the philosophical statesman, the paragon of the virtuous\nand happy person. What remains to be articulated is a conception of\nhow cosmic goodness is manifested in the universe so that human beings\nwill recognize it, understand it, and emulate it in order that their\nlives may become truly virtuous and\n happy.[31]\n\nWe saw above that in its dramatic context, the Timaeus is the\nsecond of a series of three or possibly four (see Critias\n108a\u2013b) speeches exchanged by four or possibly five (see\nTimaeus 17a) friends during one of the yearly Athenian\nPanathenaic festivals. It is sandwiched between Socrates\u2019\nRepublic-like speech, which is briefly summarized at the\nbeginning of the Timaeus (17c\u201319b), and Critias\u2019\nspeech, the unfinished sequel to the\n Timaeus,[32]\n which was intended to recount and celebrate the great victory of\nancient, prehistoric Athens over the vast military might of\n Atlantis.[33]\n The stated thematic purpose of Timaeus\u2019 discourse is to provide\nan account of human nature in the context of the nature of the\nuniverse as a whole. Conjoined with Socrates\u2019 previous account\nof education (\u00e0 la Republic) this account will provide\nthe basis for Critias\u2019 forthcoming account of human virtue in\naction, as displayed by the deeds of the ancient Athenians\n (27a7\u2013b1).[34]\n If we take this stated purpose seriously, we will expect the entire\ncosmological account to culminate in human psychology and ethics. And\nthat is indeed what we find.\n\nIn the passage that may fairly be taken as the climax of\nTimaeus\u2019 discourse (90a2\u2013d7), human beings are urged to\ndevote their utmost attention to the cultivation and preservation of\nthe well being of their immortal, rational souls. The well being of a\nrational soul consists in its being well ordered (eu\nkekosm\u00eamenon, 90c5), and so the goal of human life, given\nthe fact that the soul\u2019s revolutions were thrown off course\naround the time of birth (43a6\u201344b1), is to realign\n(exorthounta, 90d3) those revolutions with those of the\nuniverse at large. Such realignment is achieved by a study of the\nrevolutions and harmonies of the universe and, once achieved, restores\nthe soul to its original condition and thereby brings to fulfillment\n\u201cthat most excellent life offered to humankind by the gods, both\nnow and forevermore\u201d (90d5\u20137).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Archer-Hind, R.
