    "main_text": "Action and Mind || The Anomalism of the Mental\n2.2 The Anomalism of the Mental\n\nThe more developed argument for this latter claim, and for the more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind, of which it forms a part,\nappears at several places in Davidson\u2019s work. The first and\nbest-known presentation is that of \u2018Mental Events\u2019 (1970b)\nin which Davidson argues for the compatibility of three principles\n(all three of which are adumbrated in various ways in the argument of\n\u2018Actions, Reasons and Causes\u2019): (i) that at least some\nmental events interact causally with physical events \u2013 The\nPrinciple of Causal Interaction; (ii) that events related as\ncause and effect fall under strict laws (that is, laws that are\n\u2018precise, explicit and as exceptionless as possible\u2019)\n\u2013 The Principle of the Nomological Character of\nCausality; and (iii) that there are no strict laws (as opposed to\nmere generalisations) relating mental and physical events \u2013\nThe Anomalism of the Mental. Of these principles the first\ntwo would ordinarily be held to be incompatible with the third, and to\nimply, not the \u2018anomalism\u2019 of the mental, but rather, in\nthe case of mental and physical events related as cause and effect,\nthe existence of strict laws relating those events. To argue, as does\nDavidson, for the compatibility of the original principles is thus\nalso to argue for the truth of the third, that is, for the truth of\nanomalous monism.\n\nDavidson holds that events are particulars such that the same event\ncan be referred to under more than one description. He also holds that\nevents that are causally related must be related under some strict\nlaw. However, since Davidson takes laws to be linguistic entities, so\nthey can relate events only as those events are given under specific\ndescriptions. Thus, as was already evident in Davidson\u2019s\napproach to the theory of action, the same pair of events may\ninstantiate a law under one description, but not under others. There\nis, for example, no strict law that relates, under just those\ndescriptions, the formation of ice on the surface of a road to the\nskidding of a car on that road, and yet, under a different description\n(a description that will employ a completely different set of\nconcepts), the events at issue will indeed be covered by some strict\nlaw or set of laws. But while nomological relations between events\n(relations involving laws) depend on the descriptions under which the\nevents are given, relations of causality and identity obtain\nirrespective of descriptions \u2013 if the icing-up of the road did\nindeed cause the skid, then it did so no matter how the events at\nissue are described (the form of description, whether mental or\nphysical, is thus irrelevant to the fact that a particular causal\nrelation obtains). It follows that the same pair of events may be\nrelated causally, and yet, under certain descriptions (though not\nunder all), there be no strict law under which those events fall. In\nparticular, it is possible that a mental event (an event given under\nsome mental description) will be causally related to some physical\nevent (an event given under a physical description) and yet there will\nbe no strict law covering those events under just those\ndescriptions. My wanting to read Tolstoy may lead me to take\nWar and Peace from the shelf, and so my wanting may cause a\nchange in the physical arrangement of a certain region of space-time,\nbut there is no strict law that would relate my wanting to the\nphysical change. Similarly, while any mental event will be identical\nwith some physical event \u2013 it will indeed be one and the same\nevent under two descriptions \u2013 it is possible that there will be\nno strict law relating the event as described in mentalistic terms\nwith the event as physically described. In fact, Davidson is explicit\nin claiming that there can be no strict laws that relate the\nmental and the physical in this way. Thus, in the example just cited,\nthere is no strict law that relates wanting to read with a particular\nkind of brain activity.\n\nDavidson\u2019s denial of the existence of any strict\n\u2018psycho-physical\u2019 laws follows from his view of the mental\nas constrained by quite general principles of rationality that do not\napply, at least not in the same way, to physical descriptions:\nnormative considerations of overall consistency and coherence, for\ninstance, constrain our own thinking about events as physically\ndescribed, but they have no purchase on physical events as such. This\ndoes not mean, of course, that there are no correlations whatsoever to\nbe discerned between the mental and the physical, but it does mean\nthat the correlations that can be discerned cannot be rendered in the\nprecise, explicit and exceptionless form \u2013 in the form, that is,\nof strict laws \u2013 that would be required in order to achieve any\nreduction of mental to physical descriptions. The lack of strict laws\ncovering events under mental descriptions is thus an insuperable\nbarrier to any attempt to bring the mental within the framework of\nunified physical science. However, while the mental is not reducible\nto the physical, every mental event can be paired with some physical\nevent \u2013 that is, every mental description of an event can be\npaired with a physical description of the very same event. This leads\nDavidson to speak of the mental as \u2018supervening\u2019 on the\nphysical in a way that implies a certain dependence of mental\npredicates on physical predicates: predicate p supervenes on\na set of predicates S \u2018if and only if p does\nnot distinguish any entities that cannot be distinguished by\nS\u2019 (see \u2018Thinking Causes\u2019 [1993]). Put more\nsimply, events that cannot be distinguished under some physical\ndescription cannot be distinguished under a mental description\neither.\n\nOn the face of it, anomalous monism appears a highly attractive way to\nthink about the relation between the mental and the physical \u2013\ninasmuch as it combines \u2018monism\u2019 with\n\u2018anomalism\u2019 so it seems to preserve what is important\nabout physicalism while nevertheless retaining the ordinary language\nof so-called \u2018folk-psychology\u2019 (the language of beliefs\nand desires, actions and reasons). Yet anomalous monism has proved to\nbe a highly contentious position drawing criticism from both\nphysicalists and non-physicalists alike. The nomological conception of\ncausality (the second of the three principles defended in\n\u2018Mental Events\u2019) has often been seen as something for\nwhich Davidson fails to supply any real argument (a criticism he has\nattempted to address in \u2018Laws and Cause\u2019 [1995]); the\nDavidsonian account of supervenience has been viewed as incompatible\nwith other aspects of his position and sometimes as simply mistaken or\nconfused (the idea of supervenience is itself the focus for what is\nnow a very large body of discussion); and, perhaps the most serious\nand widespread criticism, anomalous monism has been seen as making the\nmental causally inert. These criticisms have not, however, gone\nunanswered (see especially \u2018Thinking Causes\u2019), and\nalthough Davidson modified aspects of his position over the years, he\ncontinued to hold to, and to defend, the basic theses first made\nexplicit in \u2018Mental Events\u2019.\n",
