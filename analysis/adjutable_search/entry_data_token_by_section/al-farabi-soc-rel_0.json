    "main_text": "Conceptual Background\n1. Conceptual Background\n\nTo our knowledge, al-Farabi was the first philosopher in the Islamic\nworld who not only displayed a serious interest in philosophy of\nsociety and religion, but also developed a highly differentiated\naccount thereof. He did not, however, start from scratch. At his time,\nthe majority of those philosophical texts which were actually\ntranslated from Greek (mostly through Syriac) into Arabic were\navailable, and al-Farabi was obviously an avid reader of his\npredecessors. Accordingly, his writings display (a) intimate\nfamiliarity with Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics;\n(b) acquaintance with the essentials of Plato\u2019s\nPoliteia (probably mediated by Galen\u2019s\nCompendium; cf. Gutas 2012: 85); and, apparently,\n(c) some knowledge of Aristotle\u2019s Politica, of\nwhich only parts were available in Arabic (Pines 1975).\nAl-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion can be described\nas an intelligent and original synthesis, particularly, of these\noeuvres, a synthesis which shares the late-ancient commentators\u2019\nconcern for harmonizing the positions of Aristotle and Plato.\nMoreover, al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society and religion turns\nout to be a clever adaptation of Greek ethico-political thought to the\nneeds and demands of its new context, the Islamic world of the\n10th century.\n\nAl-Farabi\u2019s Greek heritage is already visible on the most basic\nconceptual level. A society, on his account, is an association of\nhuman beings collaborating \u201c[i]n order to preserve [themselves]\nand to attain [their] highest perfections\u201d (Perfect\nState V, 15, 1: 229). Without collaboration, he insists,\n\u201cman cannot attain the perfection, for the sake of which his\ninborn nature [fitra] has been given to him\u201d (ibid.).\nIn function of their size, associations can or cannot furnish the\nbasis for a \u201cperfect [kamil] society\u201d\n(Perfect State V, 15, 2: 229\u201331). Thus, the smallest\nunit suited to harbor a perfect society is a city (madina).\nSmaller associations, such as villages, quarters, streets, and houses\nare per se imperfect; larger ones, like nations and the\n\u201cunion of all the societies in the inhabitable world\u201d\n(ibid.), by contrast, are perfect.\n\nThe dependence of al-Farabi\u2019s thought thus far, particularly on\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics and Politica is\nobvious. Both the notion that societies only of a certain size can\naccommodate their members independent of external supplies, and the\nidea that human beings strive for some sort of perfection, can be\ntraced back to the Stagirite\u2019s work. Moreover, just like\nAristotle, al-Farabi is convinced that attaining the highest possible\ndegree of perfection entails happiness, a key concept of his thought.\nInspired perhaps by the Politica, he further elaborates on\nthe concept of human perfection: first, he links it with the notion\nthat people live in societies and, second, draws the conclusion that\nthese societies serve a specific purpose, beyond the mere allocation\nof daily needs, such as food, shelter, and protection. Societies have\ntheir own \u2018natural telos\u2019 which consists,\naccording to al-Farabi, in guiding their members towards their end:\ntrue felicity. As a consequence, a city\n\n\n\u2026 in which people aim through association at co-operating for\nthe things by which felicity in its real and true sense can be\nattained, is the excellent city [madina fadila], and the\nsociety in which there is a co-operation to acquire felicity is the\nexcellent society [ijtima\u2018 fadil]. (Perfect\nState V, 15, 3:\n 231)[2]\n\n\n[Unless indicated otherwise, material within square brackets in\nquotations is added by the author of this entry.]\n\nIt is for this reason that society for al-Farabi constitutes an\nindispensable object of philosophical inquiry. Basically, along with\nanthropology (\u2018ilm al-insan, a term al-Farabi himself\noccasionally employs) and cosmology, philosophy of society seeks to\nreveal humanity\u2019s final end as well as the means required to\nachieve this goal (cf. Enumeration 1: 76). Accordingly, this\nnew \u2018discipline\u2019 is the main branch of practical\nphilosophy, centered on some core elements which, therefore, shall be\ndiscussed in more detail in this entry, more precisely: the notions of\nhappiness and the afterlife; the idea of a similitude between society\nand natural organisms as well as the cosmos as a whole; the moral\nobligations, both cognitive and practical, entailed by the natural\ngivens; and the methods of directing the citizens of the madina\nfadila towards their natural telos, the most prominent\nof which being religion.\n",
