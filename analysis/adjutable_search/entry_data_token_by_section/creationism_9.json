    "main_text": "Mutually Exclusive?\n10. Mutually Exclusive?\n\nThe key assumption being made by Dembski is that design and law and\nchance are mutually exclusive. This is the very essence of the\nexplanatory filter. But in real life does one want to make this\nassumption? Suppose that something is put down to chance. Does this\nmean that law is ruled out? Surely not! If one argues that a Mendelian\nmutation is chance, what one means is with respect to that particular\ntheory it is chance, but one may well believe that the mutation came\nabout by normal regular causes and that if these were all known, then\nit would not longer be chance at all but necessity. The point is that\nchance in this case is a confession of ignorance not, as one might\nwell think the case in the quantum world, an assertion about the way\nthat things are. That is, claims about chance are not ontological\nassertions, as presumably claims about designers must be. \n\nMore than this, one might well argue that the designer always works\nthrough law. This may be deism and hence no true Christianity \u2013\nsome Christians would insist that God does sometimes intervene in the\nCreation. But truly Christian or not, a deity who always works through\nlaw is certainly not inconsistent with the hypothesis of a designing\nintelligence. The designer may prefer to have things put in motion in\nsuch a way that his/her/its intentions unfurl and reveal themselves as\ntime goes by. The pattern in a piece of cloth made by machine is as\nmuch an object of design as the pattern from cloth produced by a hand\nloom. In other words, in a sense that would conform to the normal\nusage of the terms, one might want to say of something that it is\nproduced by laws, is chance with respect to our knowledge or theory,\nand fits into an overall context of design by the great orderer or\ncreator of things. In short, Dembski\u2019s filter does not let Behe\u2019s\ndesigner off the hook. \n\nIf the designer can make \u2013 and rightfully takes credit for\n\u2014 the very complex and good, then the designer could prevent\n\u2014 and by its failure is properly criticized for \u2013 the very\nsimple and awful. The problems in theology are as grim as are those in\nscience. (The intelligent design theorists have provided work for many\nphilosophers eager to refute them. Pennock 1988 and Sober 2000 are\ngood places to start. See the entry on \n teleological notions in biology.)\n",
