    "main_text": "Kinds of Evil: Metaphysical and Empirical || Empirical Evil\n3.2 Empirical Evil\n\nEmpirical evil is a capacious category: it covers bodily\npain, damage, and disease as well as the psychological\nconcomitants or effects of these physical\nphenomena\u2014suffering, terror, depression, mental illness.\nTraditionally, it has also included social ills such as oppression,\npoverty, and structural injustice (see Sharpe 1909). Philosophers who\nbelieve in metaphysical evil often take them to manifest in empirical\nevils. Philosophers who reject metaphysical evil, by contrast, take\nthe empirical kind to be fundamental.\n\nCalling pain an evil might raise eyebrows, since clearly some pain is\nbeneficial: it protects us from collisions, diseases, and predators.\nBut the idea is that, whatever instrumental uses it has, pain qua\nphenomenal quality\u2014the feeling of it\u2014is\nintrinsically bad (setting aside for these purposes tricky\ncases like that of the masochist who takes pleasure in experiencing\npain). Pain in the horrendous amounts and kinds that we encounter in\nhuman history as well as in the \u201ccharnel house\u201d of\nevolutionary history is sickeningly and obviously bad (Murray 2008;\nMartin & Watkins 2019).\n\nThe templates used to characterize metaphysical evil above can be\napplied to empirical evil, too. An Absence Theory of\nempirical evil construes it simply as the absence of\nphysical-psychological states of pleasure, health, stability, justice,\nand even life. Matter Theory regards pain, disease, mental\nmalaise, and social ills as effects of our standing as material\nbeings, vulnerable to the \u201cmatter\u201d in our organism\nbreaking down or coming into conflict with other parts of material\ncreation. Privation Theory says that empirical evil is the\nabsence of some such good which ought to exist. There will\nthen be different accounts of why the good ought to exist, and why it\ndoesn\u2019t\u2014some of these will be based in a theory of\nmetaphysical evil.\n\nA Real Property Theory of empirical evil, by contrast,\ninsists that pain and suffering are positive realities and not mere\nabsences (it is thus compatible with Matter Theory, but not with\nAbsence or Privation Theory). As Malebranche notes, this is\nproblematic in theological contexts, since God is supposed to be the\nground of all positive beings (see Malebranche 1674\u20135 [1997: 348\nand 392]). In a letter to a mathematician named Arnold Eckhard, G.W.\nLeibniz discusses this issue, and suggests \u201cwith some\nscruples\u201d that \u201cpain too is a perfection\u201d (1677\n[1969: 177]). That is a fairly unusual view, one that is made\nparticularly poignant by the fact that Leibniz himself spent the last\nfew years of his life in immense pain. He apparently had a habit of\nsleeping in a chair near his writing desk, and it\n\n\nled to his having an open sore on his right leg. This caused him\ndifficulty in walking; he tried to remedy it, but only by putting\nblotting paper on it. Later, to reduce the pain and to make the nerves\ninsensitive he had a number of wooden clamps made, and these he\nscrewed onto himself wherever he felt pain. I suspect that by doing\nthis he so damaged his nerves that eventually he could no longer use\nhis feet and had to stay in bed. (Guhrauer 1842 [1966: vol 2, p.336];\nquoted in Mates 1989: 29)\n\n\nAlthough such pain is a \u201cperfection\u201d and thus a real\nproperty, for Leibniz, it still involves a kind of weakness or\nimperfection in the person who has it, and so God cannot, in\nthe end, exemplify this \u201cperfection\u201d. Rather, God\u2019s\npossession of maximal pleasure is somehow sufficient to ground the\n\u201creality\u201d that is found in both pleasure and pain (Leibniz\n1677 [1969: 177]). This seems fishy, and other philosophers argue\nagainst Leibniz that if pain is a real property (rather than a mere\nabsence), then God as the \u201cground of all reality\u201d must\nindeed exemplify it. Some recent theologians and philosophers even\nwelcome this idea, arguing that a conception of God as grounding\nempirical evil by suffering it has advantages for projects in\ntheodicy (Hartshorne 1984; Wolterstorff 1988).\n\nMental illnesses can be classified as \u201cempirical evils\u201d if\nwe assume that they have empirical causes and neural bases\n(Bhattacharjee 2018). Such illness often generates further empirical\nevil in the form of inexplicably cruel or destructive behavior to self\nand others, as will be familiar to anyone who has tried to live (or\nlove someone) with mental illnesses like posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and so on. It\nis unclear whether the theologians just mentioned would want to say\nthat this kind of empirical evil, too, must have its ground in the\ndivine by way of exemplification. The theological consequences of such\na suggestion seem unattractive, to say the least.\n",
