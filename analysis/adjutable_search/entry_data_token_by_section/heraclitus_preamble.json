    "main_text": "\n\nA Greek philosopher of Ephesus (near modern Ku\u015fadas\u0131,\nTurkey) who was active around 500 BCE, Heraclitus propounded a\ndistinctive theory which he expressed in oracular language. He is best\nknown for his doctrines that things are constantly changing (universal\nflux), that opposites coincide (unity of opposites), and that fire is\nthe basic material of the world. The exact interpretation of these\ndoctrines is controversial, as is the inference often drawn from this\ntheory that in the world as Heraclitus conceives it contradictory\npropositions must be true.\n",
