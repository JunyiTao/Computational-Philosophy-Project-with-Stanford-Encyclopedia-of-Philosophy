    "main_text": "The Berlin School of Physics: 1878\u20131894\n7. Epistemology\n\nIn 1921, 100 years after Helmholtz was born, Paul Hertz and Moritz\nSchlick brought out an edition of Helmholtz\u2019s epistemological\nwritings: Schriften zur Erkenntnistheorie. This edition made\navailable \u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d \u201cOn the Facts Underlying Geometry,\u201d\n\u201cNumbering and Measuring from an Epistemological\nViewpoint,\u201d and \u201cThe Facts in Perception.\u201d\nSchlick\u2019s part in the selection of work having to do with\ngeometry and empirical measurement is significant. Schlick, a close\nassociate of Einstein\u2019s, saw the relevance Helmholtz\u2019s\nwork had for Einstein\u2019s theory. For a discussion of the\ninfluence of Helmholtz on the early career of Einstein, see Cahan\n2000, 70ff.\n\nSchlick and Paul Hertz assess the relevance of Helmholtz\u2019s work\nas follows: Helmholtz\u2019s \u201cclassic works on physics \u2014\none may for example recall the energy principle or his work on vortex\nmotions \u2014 stand at the end of lines of\ndevelopment\u2026 his work seems for science at its present stage to\nbe something completed and left behind. There is only one field, but a\nvery important one, to which this does not apply: it does not hold for\nHelmholtz\u2019s epistemological studies\u201d (Hertz and Schlick\n1977 [1921], xxxiv). In his Notes on \u201cOn the Origin and\nSignificance of the Axioms of Geometry,\u201d Schlick sees the\n\u201cchief epistemological result\u201d of Helmholtz\u2019s work\nin the replacement of the Kantian necessary a priori with a judgment\nthat \u201cEuclidean space is not an inescapable form of our\nfaculty of intuition, but a product of experience\u201d\n(Schlick\u2019s note to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 35).\n\nFor a thorough discussion of the anti-Kantian implications of\n\u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d see DiSalle 1993, 516ff. DiSalle discusses\nHelmholtz\u2019s famous debate with the Kantian J. P. N. Land, as\ndoes David Hyder (Hyder 2006, Land 1877). DiSalle also mentions that\nin 1972, J\u00fcrgen Ehlers, Felix Pirani, and Alfred Schild\n\u201cderived the metric of general-relativistic spacetime from\nassumptions about falling bodies and light rays\u201d (DiSalle 1993,\n520n). Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild note that their method \u201chas\nsome similarity to Helmholtz\u2019s derivation of the metrics of\nspaces of constant curvature\u201d (Ehlers et al. 1972, 65).\n\nDespite Schlick\u2019s conviction that Helmholtz\u2019s view is\nantithetical to Kantianism, Helmholtz\u2019s notion that the a priori\nin space consists of the manifold of possible orientations in space\nhas inspired new readings of Kant\u2019s a priori. This influence\ncomes partly through the mediation of Hans Reichenbach, whose reading\nof Helmholtz was significantly different from Schlick\u2019s\n(Reichenbach 1920). Reichenbach and Schlick both pointed out the\nrelationship between the views of Helmholtz and those of\nPoincar\u00e9, though Schlick realizes that Helmholtz is not a\nconventionalist and Reichenbach may not have done (see Schlick\u2019s\nnote 40 to Helmholtz 1921 [1868], 34). For a discussion of\nHelmholtz\u2019s influence on Michael Friedman\u2019s reading of\nKant, also influenced by Robert DiSalle, see Friedman 2000. Also see\nFriedman 2001, Chapter One.\n\nIn The Mechanics of Meaning, David Hyder traces discussions\nof Helmholtz\u2019s theory regarding \u201csensation-spaces and\ntheir relation to the philosophy of space and perception\u201d by\nBoltzmann, Poincar\u00e9, Carnap, Russell, and Weyl (Hyder 2002,\n19n). De Kock 2013 is an analysis of the problem of externality in\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory of perception. Biagioli (2014) analyzes\nHelmholtz\u2019s debate with Albrecht Krause over the status of\ngeometrical axioms; more generally, Biagioli\u2019s work illuminates\nHelmholtz\u2019s relationship to Poincar\u00e9 and to Holder.\nDarrigol 2003 also places Helmholtz\u2019s work in context, including\nwith respect to related work by Grassmann, Fechner, and Wundt.\nDarrigol\u2019s focus is Helmholtz\u2019s theory of number and\nmeasure in physics and mathematics.\n\nIn Hermann von Helmholtz\u2019s Mechanism, Gregor Schiemann\nsees Helmholtz\u2019s work in the sciences as characteristic of a\nshift from the early modern to the modern tradition, as emblematic of\nthe \u201crelativization of claims to validity\u201d of scientific\nknowledge, the \u201closs of certainty\u201d characteristic of the\nmodern attitude toward science.\n\nThe influence of Hertz, and indirectly Helmholtz, on Wittgenstein is\nargued by many. Brian McGuinness, Wittgenstein\u2019s biographer, and\nPeter Hacker, in Insight and Illusion, are perhaps the first\nto have so argued (see, e.g., Grasshoff 1993, 243, Hacker 1986,\n2\u20134). Gerd Grasshoff traces the development in Grasshoff 1993,\narguing that Hertz and Boltzmann were the first to develop a\n\u201cpicture theory,\u201d according to which physical and\nlinguistic theories give us pictures [Bilder in the original\nGerman] of the world. Hertz\u2019s and Boltzmann\u2019s picture\n(Bild) theories go well beyond Helmholtz\u2019s view.\nHelmholtz argues that the constraints on using Bilder to\nconstruct scientific explanations are given by physical experience and\nnatural science, and Hertz and Boltzmann argue that these constraints\nare determined mathematically. However, according to this\ninterpretation, the historical roots of the picture theory can be\nfound in Helmholtz\u2019s substitution of the \u201csign\ntheory\u201d for nativistic explanations (see, e.g., Schiemann 1998,\nPatton 2009). According to Helmholtz\u2019s \u201csign\u201d\ntheory, our physical perceptions are images or symbols that do not\nresemble their objects directly. Michael Heidelberger and Jean Leroux\nargue as well for the influence of Helmholtz\u2019s sign theory on\nHertz\u2019s picture theory in Heidelberger 1998 and Leroux 2001. See\nsection 2 for a detailed discussion of the sign theory.\n\nIn his early writings, Helmholtz defends a broadly Kantian methodology\nagainst a more far-reaching idealism. In \u201cOn the Relation of\nNatural Science to Science in General\u201d, Helmholtz opposes Kant\nto Hegel. Helmholtz argues that for Kant \u201ca principle discovered\na priori was a rule applicable to the method of pure thought, and\nnothing further; it could contain no real, positive knowledge\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 79). For Hegel, on the other hand, \u201cnot\nonly the physical phenomena, but even the actual world\u2026were the\nresult of an act of thought on the part of the creative mind\u201d\n(ibid.). As a result, according to Helmholtz, Hegel attempted\nto unify the human and the natural sciences (the Geistes- and the\nNaturwissenschaften).\n\nThe question of the independence of the methods of the human sciences,\nprominently including history, from the physical sciences became the\ntheme of heated debate over the 19th century. Wilhelm Dilthey (1883\n[1989]) defended the independence of the methods of the human\nsciences, while Wilhelm Windelband (1980/1894) argued that only the\nnatural, physical sciences are \u201cnomothetic,\u201d or\nlaw-governed, and thus genuinely scientific (see Beiser 2012 and\nPatton 2019 for more detail on this debate and its history).\n\nIn an essay on the relation of the natural sciences to science in\ngeneral, Helmholtz observes that it is true that the human sciences\nbecame increasingly scientific over the first half of the 19th\ncentury. As a result, \u201cthe opposition between them and the\nphysical sciences has become less and less marked\u201d (Helmholtz\n1995 [1862], 81). Helmholtz argues that nonetheless there is a\nprofound difference, and that,\n\nIn short, there is no denying that, while the moral sciences deal\ndirectly with the nearest and dearest interests of the human mind, and\nwith the institutions it has brought into being, the natural sciences\nare concerned with dead, indifferent matter, obviously indispensable\nfor the sake of its practical utility, but apparently without any\nimmediate bearing on the cultivation of the intellect (Helmholtz 1995\n[1862], 81).\n\n\nHelmholtz then addresses the old question of the \u201cdispute of the\nfaculties\u201d \u2014 is it better to separate the study of the\nnatural sciences from all others? He concludes that the logical\ninduction characteristic of natural sciences must always be\nsupplemented with the aesthetic induction of the human\nsciences, which draws conclusions about human character and behavior\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 85). Helmholtz concludes that the best outcome\nfor human knowledge is to encourage the strengths of aesthetic and\nlogical induction, to maintain the presence of both in the same\nacademy, while keeping their foundations and methods strictly\nseparate. The Hegelian program of methodological and conceptual\nunification must give way to a separation between the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften.\n\nHelmholtz observes that what he sees as the attempt by the Hegelian\nphilosophy to legislate for natural science resulted in the following\nimpasse:\n\nThat in the moral sciences traces of the activity of the human\nintellect and of the several stages of its development should present\nthemselves, was a matter of course; but surely, if nature really\nreflected the result of the thought of a creative mind, the system\nought, without difficulty, to find a place for her comparatively\nsimple phenomena and processes. It was at this point that\nHegel\u2019s philosophy, we venture to say, utterly broke down. His\nsystem of nature seemed, at least to natural philosophers, absolutely\ncrazy\u2026. The philosophers accused the scientific men of\nnarrowness; the scientific men retorted that the philosophers were\ncrazy. And so it came about that men of science began to lay some\nstress on the banishment of all philosophical influences from their\nwork\u2026 Thus, it must be confessed, not only were the\nillegitimate pretensions of the Hegelian system to subordinate to\nitself all other studies rejected, but no regard was paid to the\nrightful claims of philosophy, that is, the criticism of the sources\nof cognition, and the definition of the functions of the intellect.\n(Helmholtz 1995 [1862], 79\u201380)\n\n\nHelmholtz concludes that once natural scientists, physiologists of\nperception such as himself, entered the philosophical fray, \u201cthe\npath of future investigation was basically prescribed by the inductive\nmethods of the natural sciences\u201d (ibid. 394).\nHelmholtz\u2019s work in epistemology epitomizes the return to the\nmethods of the natural sciences in the mid-19th century. See Patton\n(2019) and Schiemann (2013) for more on the background of changes to\nthe approach to the sciences over the 19th century.\n",
