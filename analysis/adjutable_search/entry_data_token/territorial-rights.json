This interest is hardly\nsurprising. The state is not simply a membership organization: it\nexercises authority over a geographical domain and this naturally\ngives rise to questions about how state authority over place can be\njustified, and how different claims to this authority can be assessed\nfairly. Moreover, many of the most pressing questions facing the\ncontemporary interstate order are connected to\nterritory\u2014questions such as how to resolve disputes where more\nthan one state makes claims to the same territory, how to draw\nboundaries in the case of secession or when borders are contested.\nIndeed, many of the major issues of the day\u2014such as migration,\nresources and self-defense\u2014have important territorial\ndimensions, so that a complete normative understanding of these issues\nrequires a normative theory of territory. \n\nWhat is perhaps more surprising is that territory has been relatively\nneglected. Until recently, most debates in political philosophy have\nfocused on the rights and duties of citizens toward the state, and\nvice versa, but relatively little was written about how to justify, or\nconceptualize, the territory of the state. This neglect was not\nconfined to political philosophy: it was a feature of all three\ntraditions that were influential in thinking about the state. In\ninternational law, the territorial dimension of the state was taken\nfor granted. The 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties\nof States defines states as territorial entities, which\nsuggests that the first order of business is to explain, theorize and\njustify states and that the territory of the state can be simply\nassumed. This assumption was also made by political scientists,\nwriting in both the comparative politics and international relations\ntraditions. They offered explanatory and descriptive theories of the\nstate but paid scant attention to the spatial element, largely\nassuming that the territory of the state is the product of history and\npast coercion which can be taken for granted as a basic feature of the\nstate. One might have thought that normative political philosophers\nwould be more interested in the question of how political authority\ncan be wielded over territories and not just not over persons.\nHowever, political philosophers were also guilty of this blind spot,\nin part perhaps because of the extraordinary influence of Rawls in\ncontemporary political philosophy. Rawls\u2019s task in A Theory\nof Justice was to theorize the domestic justice of the basic\nstructure of the state, and he therefore assumed, arguendo,\nthat \u201cpolitical society is closed\u201d (Rawls 1971: 4), by\nwhich he meant that we should conceive of it in the first instance as\na self-sufficient entity that we happen to be in and cannot leave. He\nthen tackled the question of the legitimacy of the state\nvis-\u00e0-vis the international order at a later stage of the\nanalysis (Rawls 1999). The closed society assumption obscured many\nimportant issues from view, and has meant that political philosophers\nwho adopt this methodological strategy have nothing to say in a range\nof cases that are very important for resolving questions of importance\nto inter-state peace and stability, as discussed above.\n", "toc": [{"#ConcIssu": "1.

Conceptual Issues\n1.1 What is territory?\n\nOne common preliminary distinction is between territory and land. Land\nis that part of the earth\u2019s surface that is not covered by\nwater. Territory is a political and geographic concept. It refers to\nthe spatial area of jurisdictional authority. States have territory:\nit is the geographical extent of their jurisdictional authority. This\nusually covers the land within the borders of the state, but it can\nand does in the modern world extend off shore into the sea, below the\nearth\u2019s surface (to control resources) and above the\nearth\u2019s surface, as most states also claim jurisdiction over\ntheir air space. Territory, then, is not co-extensive with land,\nalthough all (or almost all) land on this planet is divided up into\ndifferent jurisdictional units, or territories. The critical geography\nliterature on \u2018territory\u2019 tends to primarily conceive of\n\u2018territory\u2019 as a geographical area that is controlled, or\nover which power is exercised (Elden 2013); whereas the political\nphilosophy literature tends to be more interested in territory as the\ndomain of legitimate jurisdictional control and associated rights\n(Miller 2012; Nine 2012; Banai 2014; Moore 2015; Angeli 2015; Stilz\n2019). Territory is also distinct from property as will be explained\nbelow.\n1.2 Territorial rights\n\nThe political philosophy literature on territory makes use of the idea\nof territorial rights. This is often done in a way that is analogous\nto how we think about property rights\u2014viz., as a bundle of\ndifferent liberties, powers, immunities, and claims, which, when held\ntogether with respect to a material thing, constitutes what we mean by\nproperty rights. In the case of property, the fullest form of\nnormative control over that thing was what Honor\u00e9 (1961) called\n\u2018full liberal ownership\u2019, but he also recognized that\nproperty rights can be parcelled out and held by different agents and\nthat each right within the bundle may have its own, separate\njustification.\n\nIn the case of territorial rights, the central and fundamental right\nis the right of jurisdiction, which is the right to create and enforce\nlaws within the domain in question. However, there are other related\nrights (powers, immunities) related to jurisdiction, which we also\nlump together as part of \u2018territorial right\u2019. It includes\nthe power to make changes to the territory\u2019s status, for example\nby incorporating it into some larger entity such as the EU, and the\npower to create sub-jurisdictional units of a federal system. It\nincludes the right to do business in the world as a legal\nentity\u2014to make war and peace, to conclude treaties, and enter\ninto alliances. And it includes rights against other similar entities\nnot to be interfered with in the exercise of this power.\n\nTerritorial rights are also normally understood to include other\nrights beyond jurisdiction and the associated claims, powers and\nimmunities: rights to control resources within the geographical area,\nrights to control borders and regulate the flow of people and goods\nacross them and rights to defend the territory against outside\naggression (Simmons 2001; Miller 2012). Although these are often\nassumed to be inherent in the very idea of a sovereign state, we can\nenvisage entities that have some rights of jurisdiction but lack other\nelements in the territorial bundle. Consider the members of the\nEuropean Union which have significant jurisdictional powers at the\nmember state level, but no border checks between member states in the\nSchengen area. Most federations are structured in this way. In Canada,\nprovinces exercise wide powers of jurisdiction (over education,\nhealth, roads, natural resources) but there are no border controls\nbetween provinces. Thus, each element in the bundle that make up what\nwe might loosely call \u2018territorial rights\u2019 needs to be\nexamined, related to other elements, and justified, if we are to have\na full normative theory of territorial rights or territorial\njustice.\n\nThe structural similarities between property rights and territorial\nrights should not blind us to their differences. Territory is not the\nsame as property, because it has, as its primary element, a right of\njurisdiction. Some of the rights that are included in rights over\nterritory look as though they\u2019re concerned with the claims to\nregulate and control a particular territory, which we think of as\nprimarily rights of jurisdiction; and other rights are much more\nproperty-like, because they involve exclusionary claims over a region,\nand claims about how to use resources and land located within the\nboundaries of the state. However, these rights are mainly conceived of\nas secondary to that of jurisdiction, and of meta-jurisdictional\npowers such as the power to secede from a state or merge with another\none.\n\nOne of the fundamental divisions in theories of territorial justice\nconcerns the question of the relationship between territory and\nproperty, with theorists of a more Lockean or libertarian bent arguing\nthat there are natural rights to property, which can give rise to\nrights over territory. On this story, property-holders consent to\ncreate a state and bring their property with them. Other theorists,\nincluding justice theorists, self-determination theorists and liberal\nnationalists, view rights of jurisdiction as both prior and\nfundamental, since it is through the exercise of jurisdiction that the\nrules according to which people can acquire and transfer property are\ndetermined.\n1.3 What is a theory of territorial justice?\n\nA theory of territorial justice has to explain and justify rights over\nterritory. It has to explain what rights there are, the limits of\nthese rights, and who holds these rights. In doing so, it has to\nexamine and justify the relationship between three different elements:\nthe people (or individual persons); land; and the regime, government\nor state. There are different ways in which these elements are related\nand different justificatory values may undergird these different\nconfigurations, but all extant theories offer an argument that relates\nthese different elements and justifies their particular\nconfigurations. \n\nThe main differences among these theories tend to track the following\ndimensions: (1) the putative territorial right-holder; (2) the value\nthat explains and justifies rights over territory and which limits the\nscope of each of these rights; and (3) the argument for connecting\nboth the justifying value and the rights to the particular\ngeographical area. Let\u2019s take these different dimensions in\norder. The first key difference among rival theories concerns their\nconception of the appropriate (or justified) territorial right-holder:\nis it the nation? the people? or the state? They also offer different\naccounts of the underlying value that justifies these rights: the main\ncontenders are peace and stability; justice; and self-determination.\nThe underlying value also affects the scope of the rights being\nclaimed, and indeed which set of rights in the bundle of rights can be\nso justified. A theory of territory has to explain how we can\ndemarcate the geographical domain that the rights range over. It is\nnot sufficient to explain in general that states need to be\nterritorial in order to realize whatever value is supposed to justify\nthem. The theory should explain which particular bits of territory are\nconnected to which states. This is called in the literature \u2018the\nparticularity question\u2019. To address this question, the theory\nneeds an argument that relates people and land to the state in ways\nthat justify rights over particular bits of territory, and\nthis is a difficult problem for one of the most prominent theories of\nterritory\u2014justice theories.\n2. Theories of Territory in Historical Perspective\n\nThere are a number of historical theories which have presented\narguments about territory that have been relatively neglected in the\nscholarship on these theories, which has tended to focus on other\naspects of their argument. Three key traditions are the natural law\ntradition, in particular Grotius and Pufendorf; the social contract\ntradition, and particularly Locke, who offered a theory of political\nobligation and a justification for limited constitutional government;\nand the justice tradition, associated with Kant, which identifies the\nstate with the achievement of justice. None of these offered a\ncomplete theory of territory, but they did, in the course of\ntheorizing the state and the international order, connect territory in\ncrucial ways to their overall argument, such that it is extremely\nuseful to focus on how they conceptualized territory, how they argued\nfor it, and how it was related to other key elements in their\npolitical theory. Contemporary theories, which will be discussed in\nsect. 3, mainly build on these earlier theories.\n2.1 Natural law theories: Hugo Grotius (1583\u20131645) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131694)\n\nBoth Grotius and Pufendorf operated in a natural law tradition. They\nboth assumed that natural laws, which can be rationally apprehended,\napply to all human beings, are invariable across time and space, and\nconstitute the fundamental bonds of human society. Both theorists made\nroom for conventional law but argued that these were constrained by\nthe precepts of what both referred to as \u2018right\nreason\u2019.\n\nWriting in a period of initial imperial expansion and discovery,\nGrotius in Mare Liberum (1609) defended the idea of common\nownership of resources. By the term \u2018common ownership\u2019,\nGrotius meant that God granted all humans a right (a liberty right) to\nuse objects or resources in the world to satisfy basic needs. In\nrelation to the ocean, Grotius argued that no state or common power\ncould claim exclusive dominion over it because the sea is not\nconfinable within fixed boundaries and also is not amenable to\ntransformation through human labor and so not an appropriate object of\nproperty rights. For these reasons, it should remain a relatively\nundisturbed commons; human beings would be free to travel on it and\nengage in mutual exchange, and to fish (the resources of the sea\nbeing, in his view, almost limitless). Although this view was\nchallenged in his own day by John Selden in Mare Clausum\n(1635), who pointed out that geographical coordinates could enclose\nthe sea, and in our own day by the recognition that the resources of\nthe ocean and the seabed are not limitless, the idea of international\nrights over a global commons was very influential in the creation of\nmodern international law, and was also important to the development of\nsea empires shortly thereafter (see Armitage 2012: 54\u201356). This\nidea is applied to many areas today as part of the idea of\n\u2018common heritage of mankind\u2019.\n\nIn relation to land Grotius argued that all individuals have a natural\nright to use objects that are held in common, but this right lacks\nsome of the incidents that we associate with ownership proper. There\nis no right to exclude or to have a thing when it was no longer in\none\u2019s possession. He then elaborates a genealogical argument,\naccording to which, in the early period of human existence, we lived\nin a simpler state where \u201cthe great extent of land was\nsufficient for the use of all occupants, as yet but few in number,\nwithout their incommoding each other\u201d (Grotius RWP: II,\n2, ii). However, as people became more ambitious and more acquisitive\nin meeting their needs, they began to interact more extensively with\nresources, and so came to possess moveable things and to cultivate and\noccupy immoveable resources, like land. As population increased in\nnumber and spread throughout the world, it didn\u2019t make sense to\nhave a common right in objects many miles distant from where people\nlive (Grotius RWP: II, 2, ii). Grotius appealed to the idea\nof consent, capaciously understood to include the gradual\nestablishment of rules of acquisition, use and transfer. He also\nargued that possession would be converted to jurisdiction through a\npublic act which allows all to recognize who possesses what, which is\nimportant to ensure peaceful possession and reconcile the division of\nthe world with human sociability. \n\nBecause Grotius conceives of natural rights (including our rights as\ncommon owners in things) as potentially transferable, he is able to\nexplain and defend different kinds of government\nsystems\u2014democracies, oligarchies, even absolute monarchies.\nSince, for Grotius, the natural rights that a person has over his or\nher own person are alienable, he is able to argue that the source of\nthe state\u2019s authority stems from the transferability of this\nright to a sovereign authority through consent, including conventions\ndeveloped over a long period of time, which represents an implicit\nexchange for a peaceful and stable society. He also argues that civil\nauthority can also be acquired through conquest (Grotius RWP:\nII.3.viii), although this aspect of his theory is not emphasized by\ncontemporary scholars.\n\nMost criticisms of Grotius\u2019 theory focus on his defense of\nabsolute sovereignty, but the focus here is on his account of\ngroup-based possession implicit in his justification for territory.\nThe central difficulty is that Grotius\u2019s account of possession\ndoes not have a scope limitation. It\u2019s not clear that he has the\nconceptual resources to establish limits to the area that a group can\nclaim (or possess). He did, however, recognize a right of necessity\nand other moral rights (to passage, settlement, commerce, use of\nwater, rights of refuge), which means that some sharing would be\nrequired by an appropriator. For their part, incomers would be\nrequired to submit to the sovereign (Grotius DJB II,2,\nxvii). This suggests that\nhe envisions state jurisdiction as encompassing large areas that are\nnot possessed or occupied in the normal sense, and some might argue\nthat it is counter-intuitive that a single group should be able to\nclaim sovereignty over vast tracts of land, as the European empires\ndid in the \u2018Age of Discovery\u2019, and require that all\npeoples and migrants simply submit to their rules. \n\nThe scope limitation for sovereignty authority is described more\nclearly in Pufendorf\u2019s natural law theory. Like Grotius, whose\npolitical philosophy he was attempting to defend, Pufendorf\n(DMC) believed in natural law and also laws derived in more\nconventional ways\u2014such as civil laws, or laws between nations.\nHe builds on Grotius\u2019 account in two ways. First, Pufendorf\nrightly pointed out that the ocean could be subject to the exercise of\njurisdiction. Second, and more significantly, his account provides the\nconceptual resources to recognize not only collective title, but it\nincorporates the idea of fair rules and fair terms in his account of\nthe establishment of property regimes. For Pufendorf, the state of\nnature was a state of social living, and our claims to resources of\nthe commons were rights held in a negative community in the sense that\nthe natural world was equally open to everyone, but that, in order to\nappropriate land or property, one needed the consent of other\nco-owners. Pufendorf did not specify what kind of consent ought to\ncount. However, he suggests that it would take the form of collective\nproperty or property held by communities, and that, from this,\nindividual claims could be derived. Cara Nine (2019) has argued that\nhis account has the conceptual resources to explain the limits of the\nstate\u2019s territorial domain in a non-arbitrary way, because he\nlimits both individual and collective title by invoking moral\nprinciples such as non-domination and need.\n2.2 Consent and property theories: John Locke (1632\u20131704).\n\nJohn Locke\u2019s central concern was to justify a limited\n(rights-respecting) constitutional government, and, like Grotius and\nPufendorf, he appeals to consent. Locke\u2019s argument proceeds by\nfirst defending the idea of natural rights to property, which he\ngrounded in the fundamental importance of private holdings to the\nexercise of liberty, i.e., to the ability of persons to engage in\nindividual or collective projects. He argued that individuals can\nacquire property in land and other external material objects by\n\u2018mixing their labor\u2019 with it and thereby improving it\n(Locke ST: V,27). He then argues that the difficulties that\nwould be attendant on such an arrangement could only be solved by\ncreating a jurisdictional authority to govern such people and protect\ntheir rights. Individuals in the state of nature, or loosely\nassociated persons (e.g., families), many of whom have property in\nland, would, Locke argued, combine together to form a state to protect\ntheir rights. They would consent to majority rule, to obedience to and\nsupport for law (within the limits of natural law) and, importantly,\nconsent to incorporate one\u2019s rightful landholdings into the\nterritory over which the government has jurisdiction. Locke connects\nthe creation of authority over persons and authority over territory in\nthis way:\n\n\nBy the same Act therefore, whereby any one unite his Person, which was\nbefore free, to any Commonwealth; by the same he unites his\nPossessions, which were before free, to it also; and they become, both\nof them, Person and Possession, subject to the Government and Dominion\nof the Commonwealth, as long as it hath a being. (Locke ST:\nVIII, 120)\n\n\nThere are two justifications for the state: one is functional, since\nthe creation of political authority is necessary to solve the\ndeficiencies of the state of nature at least as regards the protection\nof people\u2019s natural rights; and the other is consent, as people\nin the state of nature are imagined to agree to a political order, an\nact which reconciles man\u2019s natural liberty with subjection to\ncommon authority. The natural right to property, on this argument, is\nconceived of as prior to the state, and an essential building block\nfor justifying the domain of state jurisdiction. By linking people and\nland together prior to the creation of political authority,\nLocke\u2019s theory can explain the domain of jurisdictional\nauthority. The boundaries of the state are coextensive with the\nboundaries of property that individual property holders incorporated\nwhen political society was created.\n\nAlthough this theory is able to explain how there might be legitimate\njurisdictional authority over various chunks of land, it also seems\nlikely that these would be perforated by land held by dissenters, or\nat the least non-continuous boundaries. This means that the theory is\nof limited usefulness in justifying the contiguous jurisdictional\nauthority of territorial states, where the writ of the law applies to\nall those contained within the external boundaries but there is no\nun-owned or un-consented interior land. In other words, this argument\ndoes not justify territorial right as we know it, where\nterritorial rights and especially jurisdictional authority are\nconsistently or evenly applied across the territory. This is not a\nflaw in itself. We shouldn\u2019t think of normative theory as intent\non justifying contemporary practices. However, it is a problem in so\nfar as that does not seem compatible with the performance of functions\nrelating to the exercise of jurisdictional authority, and\nfunctionality was also an important element in Locke\u2019s argument\nfor why individuals would seek to create a political order that has\nauthority over them in the first place and can adequately protect\ntheir natural rights.\n2.3 Justice theories: Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804)\n\nIn some respects, Kantian arguments for territorial rights are the\nexact reverse of Locke\u2019s. Kant offers a general justification of\nthe state as necessary to the pursuit of justice, but then, having\nshown that the state is necessary to justice, this argument has\ndifficulty in explaining which bits of territory each state ought to\nhave.\n\nKant first defends the right to occupy and appropriate objects as\nimplicit in, and justified by, the exercise of individual freedom. He\nthen points out that removing things from common use prevents other\npeople from enjoying the object in question, and this unilateral\nexercise of one\u2019s freedom is therefore incompatible with the\nexercise of other people\u2019s freedom. The only way out of this\ndilemma is through the multilateral recognition of \u2018rights of\nproperty\u2019 (by which he means agreement on the obligation to\nrespect the acquisition, transfer and use of objects in the external\nworld) and institutions of justice to set and enforce these\nmultilateral rights. This provides an argument for why people who live\nin close proximity to one another, and therefore cannot avoid\ninteracting, are morally obliged to enter the civil condition and\nacknowledge a political authority whose coercive law can guarantee\ntheir property rights. On Kant\u2019s account, everyone in the state\nof nature has an obligation to leave a \u2018a state devoid of\njustice\u2019 and replace it with \u2018a rightful\ncondition\u2019.\n\nThis theory successfully justifies the exercise of jurisdictional\nauthority\u2014indeed, the argument that we are subject to authority\nbecause it is required by justice is probably the most compelling\njustification of state power on offer. However, there are difficulties\nfor this theory in explaining and justifying why that authority is\nheld over particular areas of the earth. It is a short step from this\ntype of argument to appeal to a principle of proximity to mark out a\ndomain in which people are unavoidably interacting with one another,\nand then explain why people who are proximate must be under the same\nauthority, because likely to fall into disputes (Waldron 2009).\nHowever, since there are many possible domains of possible\ninteraction, the argument does not tell us which territorial unit we\nshould join in cases where we stand midway between one group of\nproximate people who are in the process of creating state A,\nand a second group who are creating state B; and some members\nof our group seek to create state C (Miller 2011). It\u2019s\nclear that we should join a political community, so that we are not in\na lawless condition, and indeed it appears that all the contenders\nmight be justified in compelling us to join their political community,\nbut it is indeterminate about which political community ought to\nexercise rightful authority over us. Kant\u2019s argument avoids\ndiscussing this dilemma only by appealing to considerations which fall\noutside of the Kantian theory itself: he points out that people tend,\nas an empirical fact, to be naturally grouped along linguistic or\nreligious lines, and that membership in these cultural groups helps to\ndefine particular jurisdictional domains (Kant PP: I, first\nsupp., para. 2). This empirical assumption helps Kant to escape what\nmight appear to be the cosmopolitan logic of his account: without\nappeal to that purely contingent fact of people\u2019s preference to\nassociate politically with others who are religiously or culturally\nsimilar, it seems that the logic of his account is universal. Although\nKant himself offered various reasons for opposing a world state (Kant\nMM: II; 53\u201361) it is not clear that these reasons are\nconsistent with the logic of his theory. \n\nOne could, of course, accept a universalist, Kantian account of state\nauthority, but supplement that account with subsidiary principles,\nwhich help to define the boundaries of particular authorities. But if\nthose subsidiary principles are more than principles of convenience or\naffirmations of the status quo, both of which are problematic, then it\nmeans that Kant\u2019s theory can\u2019t be a stand-alone successful\naccount, but has to be hybridized with another account. This is\nbecause Kant\u2019s theory provides a successful justification for\nstate authority but needs another account to justify each\nstate\u2019s particular territory.\n3. Contemporary Theories of Territory\n\nMost contemporary theorists of territory build on the historical\narguments of Grotius and Pufendorf, Locke and Kant, or are a hybrid of\nthese historical accounts. Some\u2014like Risse in relation to\nGrotius, Stilz in relation to Grotius and Kant, Nine in relation to\nPufendorf and Locke, Simmons in relation to Locke, and Waldron and Ypi\nin relation to Kant\u2014are explicitly based on earlier theorists,\nand offer ways to improve some of the difficulties that beset the\noriginal account. Others\u2014like Miller in relation to nationalist\ntheory\u2014offer a philosophical version of a popular nationalist\nbelief in relation to homelands, which has historical roots in the\nnineteenth century, but lacked a clear philosophical defense.\nContemporary accounts that ground territorial rights on\nself-determination and peoplehood are not based on a single\nidentifiable theorist, though this version attempts to define\nterritorial right\u2014holder and the justificatory value in a way\nthat avoids some of the problems of earlier theorists.\n3.1 Natural law theories updated\n\nAs noted above, one of the key problems with Grotius\u2019s account\nof territory is that it failed to explain the scope of the\nstate. Jurisdiction was based on possession but possession was defined\ndescriptively: a group could come to possess land through force or\nthrough public claims, but it was not clear how the scope or extent of\nthe possession was defined normatively or how it could be limited. One\nof the key contemporary defenders of Grotius\u2014Mathias\nRisse\u2014attempts to update Grotius\u2019s account by developing a\nprinciple or set of principles designed to address this problem.\n\nIn a series of articles with Michael Blake and a book Global\nJustice and Common Ownership of the Earth, Risse argues that the\nkey Grotian insight is that our institutional practices should reflect\nthe \u201ccore idea\u201d of common ownership, which \n\n\nis that all co-owners ought to have an equal opportunity to satisfy\nbasic needs to the extent that this turns on collectively owned\nresources. (Risse 2012; 2014: 112) \n\n\nHe then addresses the key deficiency in Grotius\u2019 theory of\nterritory: he proposes a scope limitation on possession, which limits\nthe amount possessed by requiring that it be justified from a global\nperspective. Risse\u2019s distinctive proposal is a proportionality\nprinciple to explain how much each group is entitled to. Grotius\nhimself did not endorse proportionality, but he did believe in common\nownership, combined with a right of necessity, which Risse says\nimplies the following disjunctive right: each individual has the right\n\n\n\neither to use (in the narrow sense) resources and spaces to satisfy\none\u2019s basic needs or else to live in a society that does not\ndeny one the opportunity to satisfy one\u2019s basic needs in ways in\nwhich it otherwise could have been done through original resources and\nspaces. (Risse 2014: 112)\n\n\nHow does the proportionality principle work? The idea is that\npotential migrants can be excluded from states or areas of the world\nwhere people are over-using (or using at the average level) the\nresources, but they cannot be excluded from the areas where the\nresources are \u2018under-used\u2019. This brings in a rather\ntechnical discussion of what constitutes \u2018over-use\u2019 and\n\u2018under-use\u2019, but the most consistent formulation is that\none is \u2018underusing\u2019 a territory when the ratio of a\nstate\u2019s population to the value of its natural resources is low\ncompared to the other states, and \u2018over-using\u2019 it when the\nration is high (see Blake & Risse 2008; Risse 2012:\n158\u2013166).\n\nCritics of this view allege that there is a very basic difficulty with\nthe proportionality principle, which is that it is insensitive to the\nmyriad ways in which people interact with place, which ought to be\nrelevant to a theory of territorial justice. It relies on a\nhomogeneous and undifferentiated view of resources as existing in the\nworld, and thereby raising property and distributive justice\nquestions. This treats \u2018resources\u2019 as equivalent to\nnatural things which can be brought under an ownership relation. Both\nKolers (2009) and Moore (2012, 2015) have argued that the concept of\n\u2018resource\u2019 does not refer to a natural kind, but contains\nan important relational element, such that something gets transformed\nfrom being part of the natural world to a resource by being viewed\ninstrumentally and that this relational character is part of how we\nindividuate resources and distinguish resources from things in the\nphysical world that are not resources. This means that what counts as\na resource is historically, culturally and individually variable.\nSomething can be a resource for one person or one group, because\ninstrumental to the satisfaction of his or her purposes or needs, but\nnot a resource for someone else, because that person does not view the\nobject instrumentally. For example, the Lakota Sioux believe that the\nBlack Hills are sacred, which means that they don\u2019t view them\ninstrumentally. When in 1980, they won a U.S. Supreme Court award,\ncompensating them for the unlawful taking of Sioux lands, they\nrejected the award: they didn\u2019t want compensation; they wanted\nthe mining stopped. This highlights the problem with the\nproportionality principle and common ownership: it is biased towards\nintensive uses relative to population. It wrongly assumes that we view\nall things in the natural world from the same instrumental\nperspective, such that the ideas of trade-offs, compensation and\nuse-value are obviously applicable and neutral terms to use. What is\nneeded, critics allege, is a set of principles to adjudicate\nterritorial claims that better respect cultural variability with\nrespect to land.\n\nCara Nine has also updated the natural law tradition, focusing on\nSamuel Pufendorf\u2019s theory. In a series of well-known articles\nand her 2012 book, she relied on a particular interpretation of\nLockean arguments, but more recently she has argued that\nPufendorf\u2019s natural law/ common ownership argument is\ninstructive for our thinking about what we now think of as the global\ncommons. She examines the ocean as a common pool resource and the test\ncase of rival claims in Arctic waters (Nine 2019). She argues that\nPufendorf\u2019s appeal to conventional agreements and a system of\ncollective dominium may be the best way for assessing whether there is\nreal benefit from exclusive use of an object (thereby potentially\ngiving rise to property claims) and the role of necessity in\nadjudicating between rival claims. Nine argues that Pufendorf\u2019s\nmore social, conventional and collective account of our relations to\nthe world contains a discussion of inherent limits of jurisdictional\ncontrol. The claims to common pool resources, are, she argues, limited\nin three ways: the need to avoid domination among claimants, thus\nsetting the stage for a deliberation amongst claimants from a position\nof equal status; avoiding greed,; and avoiding taking what is already\nused by others, which implies a recognition of the needs, commitments\nand expectations of others (see also Mancilla 2012). Although this is\nnot presented as a full territorial theory, it does indicate the rich\nnuances of some exponents of that tradition and the way that the\nconcepts they deployed can be serviceable to contemporary problems. It\nalso points to a conventional account of the limits of such rights,\nwhere the conventions have to be sensitive to the equal standing of\nparties, and their needs and commitments. Nine then usefully discusses\nhow this could be applied to places that we think of as part of the\nglobal commons as well as its implications for a hybrid (conventional\ncombined with moral principles) theory of boundaries.\n3.2 Consent and Natural Property Theories\n\nThere are many internal disputes amongst contemporary Lockean-inspired\ntheorists concerning the appropriate understanding of Locke\u2019s\nargument and the extent to which Locke is vulnerable to some of the\nstandard objections. An objection was raised earlier that might be\ncalled the Swiss cheese objection: it seems unlikely that a consent\nargument can justify the contiguous territorial control that we might\nexpect of a state. Some Lockean theorists, such as Hillel Steiner\n(1996: 144), are happy enough to accept this as an implication of a\nLockean theory, but deny that it is a problem, or anyway not a fatal\nproblem. A. John Simmons, however, has argued that the functional\nstrand in Locke\u2019s theory does important work, so that, \n\n\nwhen people consent to make or join a political society, their consent\nshould normally be understood as consent to whatever arrangements are\nnecessary for a peaceful, stable society. (Simmons 2001: 313) \n\n\nOn his view, Locke\u2019s argument has the conceptual resources to\nlimit the ability of property-owners to exit or sell their land to\npeople who do not accept the sovereign\u2019s jurisdictional\nauthority, and to ensure that all subsequent holders of the land will\nbe bound by the obligations of state membership. In this way, Simmons\ncontends, the Lockean argument can address two of the most important\nsources of non-contiguity. \n\nThere is however a rival interpretation of Locke\u2019s theory,\nadvanced by Bas van der Vosssen (2015), according to which\nstates\u2019 external boundaries are conceived of as the product of\nconsent amongst sovereign authorities themselves, thus developing a\ntwo-stage argument for territorial rights. It is, however, not clear\nwhether this interpretation can be easily reconciled with the\ndistinctive feature of Locke\u2019s account, which is the idea of\nproperty-holders consenting to create territory.\n\nCara Nine\u2019s early articles and her 2012 book Global Justice\nand Territory also make use of Locke\u2019s theory to explain\nhow a state can gain entitlement to a territory. She argues that a\nstate improves its territory, adding value to the area via the\nenforcement of jurisdictional rules about property, contract, and so\non. This use of Locke to justify territory by a corporate agent is\ncoherent but it is purely retrospective: it tells us that a state can\nbe entitled to an area on the basis of what it has done, but since the\nstate excludes other potential claimants it cannot really show that it\nhas done more than other contending territorial agents would have\ndone, nor does it offer the resources to decide between two contending\ngroups, each aspiring to create a state in the region (and thereby\nengage in the value-enhancing jurisdictional activity). Nine\u2019s\nrecent work on Pufendorf and her emphasis on conventional agreements\nunder certain conditions is focused on addressing that problem.\n\nA. John Simmons, in his book Boundaries of Authority (2016),\noffers a more self-consciously Lockean theory of territory. Simmons\ncomplains that all existing territorial theories\u2014nationalist,\nself-determination theories, justice theories\u2014tend to accept a\nversion of Waldron\u2019s (1992) supersession thesis, which is the\nview that historic rights (to land) weaken over time. Simmons rejects\nthis view, arguing, like Locke, that all political authority, to be\nrightful, has to be grounded in consent. He holds that indigenous\npeople were doubly wronged, because not only did they not consent to\nthe state, but their collectively owned property was also wrongfully\nannexed. This line of argument reveals a significant difference\nbetween Lockeans (who have an historical argument about justice) and\nother theorists. Lockeans tend to think that rights in\nthings\u2014including rights in land\u2014are heritable and do not\ndisappear as the specific right-holders and wrongdoers die off, or\nwhen the property that they had is wrongfully taken from them.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that Simmons\u2019 position is\ncounter-intuitive, because we often do feel that the passage of time\nmatters to the existence of rights. After all, if the interests that\ngrounded the right no longer apply (due to changes wrought by the\npassage of time), then it seems that this will affect the right (which\nwas designed to protect said interest). It\u2019s hard to avoid this\nconclusion if we think of rights as protecting human interests, some\nof which may be relational or contingent. A deeper problem, to which\nthis point gives rise, is that Simmons presents his Lockeanism as\n\u201can ideal theory\u201d. However, almost everything that we are\ninterested in\u2014wrongful political incorporation, theft of land\nand then subsequent transfer\u2014are instances of non-ideal theory,\nand it is not fully clear how Simmons\u2019 Lockean insights are\nmeant to apply in the real world. It does suggest that we need a\nprocess of apology or rectification, but Simmons does not elaborate on\nthe form that rectification in the present should take, and how it\nmight be reconciled with the claims, if any, of descendants of\nwrongful settlers, or of settler states. \n3.3 Justice accounts\n\nThere are many theorists of justice and political obligation who adopt\na Kantian view of the justification of the state, but fewer who try to\napply this theory to justify territory. A fairly typical view is\nexpressed by Allen Buchanan who argues that \u201cthe chief moral\npurpose of endowing an entity with political power is to achieve\njustice\u2026\u201d (Buchanan 2003a: 247; Waldron 2009). He then\nclarifies that justice involves acceptance of human rights, due\nprocess and the rule of law. This basically Kantian view is very\nhelpful for explaining why we need states, but, like Kant\u2019s own\naccount, has difficulty explaining where the state ought to wield that\npower (the particularity problem). This in turn gives rise to three\ndistinct, but inter-related, problems, and manoeuvres to deal with\nthat problem.\n\nBecause Kantian theory has no internal mechanism to address the\nparticularity problem, it accords rights over territory\nretrospectively, after some group or agent has succeeded in gaining\npolitical power. This seems unacceptable for a theory that, in other\nways, is guided by the importance of justice and the rule of law, and\ndeeply sub-optimal for a theory of territory, which ought to be able\nto adduce normative principles to adjudicate cases where more than one\npolitical community has claims to the same territory.\n\nAnother problem is that, as a theory of territory, it seems very\ndemanding. If states do not have rights over territory unless they are\njust states, then, one implication of the argument is that even on a\nrelatively minimalist view of justice (involving guarantees of human\nrights and due process), no state legitimately exercised territorial\nrights over its political community at any time prior to the twentieth\ncentury, and most states, even now, do not have legitimate territorial\nrights over their area (Banai 2014). But this seems counter-intuitive.\nOne of the reasons why imperialism was thought to be wrong is that it\nrepresents a violation of the colonized state\u2019s territorial\nrights. But if, say, Morocco had no territorial rights over its\nterritory in the nineteenth Century, when it was colonized by France\n(on the reasonable assumption that Morocco was not, at the time, human\nrights-respecting), then there was no specific wrong about\nimperialism, or indeed any specific violation in French governance\nover that territory. Of course, we could just say that French rule\nturned out to be wrongful because it turned out to be unjust, but that\nargument would also apply to the rule that preceded imperialism and\nthe rule after decolonization, which some have argued is\ncounter-intuitive (Moore 2014, 2015, 2019a).\n\nA third problem, which is closely related to the two difficulties\nabove, is that most theorists who adopt this line of argument tend to\ndistinguish full justice from legitimacy, and so confer territorial\nrights on less-than-ideally just states. This means that while the\ntheory seems to set the bar quite high in terms of the justification\nof the state, it is low when it is applied to actual states,\nespecially when we examine the historical trajectory that enabled the\nstate to gain rights over that geographical space. Many states have\noriginated in deeply unjust practices: they gained territory through\nconquest, trickery and other forms of brutality. This sits uneasily\nwith the overall emphasis on justice in the theory. It also introduces\na problematic, because very status quo-oriented realpolitik\nelement into the theory, and so tends to justify existing territorial\norders, including ones that gained their territory through conquest\nand deceit. This may be a problem in Lea Ypi\u2019s justice based\naccount (Ypi 2014), which contends that states are only\n\u201cprovisionally\u201d as opposed to \u201cconclusively\u201d\njustified until we have an international agreement on existing\nterritory. But since having a universal agreement on territory is very\nunlikely in the medium to long-term future, this amounts to accepting\n(albeit with the adjective \u2018provisionally\u2019) whatever\nterritorial entities there currently are, and treating these as\n\u2018provisionally\u2019 rightful.\n3.4 Nationalist theories\n\nNationalism has been identified as a relatively modern\nphenomenon\u2014with some theorists pinpointing its rise with the\nFrench Revolution, and the associated principle of self-determination;\nand others with the rise of print media, which created a community of\npeople who shared similar political values and aspirations and\nidentities, but were not related in a face-to-face way (Anderson\n1983). Nationalism, even in its earliest versions, appealed to the\nidea of a \u2018national homeland\u2019, but this was not defended\nphilosophically, nor grounded in terms of any particular values. More\nrecently, several theorists (Miller 2007; Meisels 2009; Gans 2003)\nhave sought to defend liberal nationalism, which involves articulating\nan account of how a nation can come to have a particular territory.\nThe structure of this argument\u2014identifying a link between the\nright-holding group (the nation) and the land\u2014has a Lockean\nstructure, but the right-holder is not the individual person, but\ninstead a collective\u2014the nation. \n\nWhat is a nation? David Miller defines a nation as \n\n\na community (1) constituted by shared beliefs and mutual commitments,\n(2) extended in history, (3) active in character, (4) connected to a\nparticular territory, and (5) marked off from other communities by its\ndistinct public culture. (Miller 1995: 27) \n\n\nThe connection to land is definitional of a nation. The\nrelationship between people and land is not simply assumed: rather, an\naccount is given of the inter-relationship between group culture and\nland. People who inhabit a certain territory shape the land that they\noccupy; their culture is mixed with the physical characteristics of\nthe land, and the physical characteristics shape the culture that they\ndevelop. Land has value for the people, both objective value, because\nthey improve it in various ways, building places of religious worship\nand developing cities and irrigating farmland; and subjective value,\nbecause the land comes to have symbolic significance for them, as they\nbury their dead in certain places, build monuments to significant\nhistoric achievements or losses, and so on. (Miller 2007:\n217\u2013218). In this way, a group comes to have a special\nrelationship to land that they occupy, and can make a better claim to\nthat land than any other group. This argument does not yet justify\nterritorial rights, however. This is established via a further\nargument that in order to maintain value (subjective and objective) in\nland, the people need to have jurisdictional authority over it (Miller\n2012: 263).\n\nThis argument has no difficulty explaining the wrong of conquest (even\nif the conquering state is more effective or objectively just than the\npolitical order that it replaces), since the link between the group\nand the land is established prior to the political order. Therefore\nany conquest of the land represents a violation of the interests,\nsubjective and objective, of group members. Although the contours or\nprecise boundaries of the nation are somewhat permeable, this type of\nargument is able to identify a group and then define the land to which\nthe group is entitled. It is not clear how exactly we are to\nadjudicate cases where two groups are subjectively and objectively\nattached to the same territory\u2014as with Jerusalem\u2014although\nMiller seems to think that a comparative assessment of the claims will\nbe able to yield conclusions in most cases, and in some cases will\nendorse a shared sovereignty arrangement (Miller 2014).\n\nOne key problem with this theory is that the territorial right-holder\nis conceived of as a \u2018nation\u2019, and some have argued that\nthis is problematic because potentially exclusionary. Proponents of\nthis argument endorse a liberal form of nationalism, so conceive of\nthe culture as a thin, public culture potentially inclusive of many\ndifferent groups in society. Nevertheless, one might think that any\nreference to a cultural nation suffers from both over-inclusion and\nunder-inclusion. The over-inclusion problem is that the actual\n\u2018cultural mixing\u2019 which is supposed to explain rights to\nland could also apply to cultural groups that are not nations, such as\nneighborhood cultures or sub-cultures in society. Do they not also mix\ntheir culture with the geographical area and so have right to protect\nthe value so created? Another sort of problem is that any reference to\n\u2018cultural nation\u2019 might seem to raise the problem of\nessentialism, which is that it rests on particular (essential)\nfeatures as necessary or important to the culture or nation, which\nthen has the effect of marginalizing people who do not share in that\nfeature (Moore 2019b). Miller is careful to offer a Wittgensteinian\nfamily resemblance conception of nations, which is designed to address\nthe problem of essentialism by not specifying that any particular\nfeature or value is necessary, but one may wonder whether this\nconceptual move is consistent with the account of \u2018value\u2019\nin the land, which may reify certain properties. \n3.5 Ethnogeographic Group Theory of territory\n\nAvery Kolers, in his book Land, Conflict and Justice, puts\nforward a theory of territory that has the same structure as\nnationalist theories, in linking (unstructured) groups with land first\nand then describing the state later, but he identifies the territorial\nright-holding group as an \u2018ethnogeographic community\u2019\nrather than a nation. By this term, Kolers means a group of people\nthat (i) share a specific social ontology of land, and he clarifies\nthat this means \u201ca culturally specific conception of land, what\nland is, what about it is valuable\u201d (Kolers 2009: 3\u20134) and\n(ii) a specific material relationship with land, so that the community\nin question is characterized by pervasive material interaction between\nthe land and the community. The two criteria\u2014one subjective, the\nother objective\u2014are somewhat different, since the former seems to\ninclude cultural significance and meanings, whereas the latter tracks\neconomic and functional considerations. However, as Kolers notes,\nthere are reasons to believe that our ideas about land often reflect\nour material interests and material relationship with it. In his\nexamples, most cases exemplify both conditions. As these can come\napart, we could suppose that they are jointly necessary and sufficient\nconditions.\n\nKolers\u2019 theory appeals to the notion of \u2018plenitude\u2019\nto explain how a group can be attached to an area, and this seems like\nit ought to be able to adjudicate rival claims, and potentially limit\nthe scope of territorial rights. Plenitude, for Kolers, involves (1)\ninternal diversity, (2) external distinctness, each from the\nperspective of the claimants, and (3) feasible plans for maintaining\nthese in perpetuity (Kolers 2009: 115). Plenitude is claimed to be\nvalue-neutral in the sense that it does not rest on a normatively\ncontested theory of appropriate use, and is compatible with an\necologically sensitive commitment to keeping some areas in their\nnatural state without reverting to common ownership in the sense of a\nlibertarian free-for-all. \n\nHowever, since \u2018plenitude\u2019 has a number of different\ndimensions, it\u2019s not clear that it represents an authoritative\nmechanism to decide between rival claims. More than one group can make\nclaims on those bases to the same piece of land. What if one group\nrecognizes its internal diversity and a different group its external\ndifferentiation? What if neither has feasible plans for maintaining\nthem in perpetuity? Since this is not a single criterion at all, but\nembodies at least three different requirements, it\u2019s possible\nthat all could be met by more than one group, or that some elements\ncould be met different groups. Unfortunately, Kolers does not indicate\nwhat to do in this situation, which means that Kolers\u2019 theory is\nless precise in addressing rival claims and conflict than it initially\nseems to be. \n3.6 Self-determination theories\n\nSelf-determination theories of territory have the same overall shape\nas nationalist theories, but they seek to avoid the difficulties of\nassuming culturally homogeneous nations by ascribing territorial\nrights to a \u2018people\u2019 understood as a politically-organized\nrather than cultural group. Anna Stilz (2019: 10) argues that her\naccount is built on three pillars: a property-like right of occupancy;\nthe value of \u2018basic justice\u2019, conceptualized in Kantian\nterms of the requirements of an \u2018omnilateral will\u2019; and\nthe value of collective self-determination. Margaret Moore (2015: 66)\nappeals to the first and third: that a state holds territorial rights\n(by acting as a vehicle of self-determination\u201d for a group; and\nthat the group must \u201clegitimately occupy\u201d the territory.\nAlthough Moore does not emphasize basic justice as a requirement for\nholding territorial rights (though she claims it is necessary for\nlegitimate governance), she argues that there are functional and\njustice reasons why the state should be organized\nterritorially\u2014to secure equal treatment for all citizens of the\nstate, justice, and the rule of law. Stilz deploys more Kantian\nlanguage, to describe her commitment to justice, but this isn\u2019t\ncentral to her theory of territory, in the sense that it does not help\nto define the boundaries of particular territories, nor does this\nargument contribute to the justification for particular\nterritories.\n\nBoth Moore and Stilz explore the moral relationship between people and\nplace through invoking the idea of what it means for a people to\noccupy a place. The central difference between Moore\u2019s and\nStilz\u2019s accounts are the different accounts of the holders of\noccupancy rights. Both agree that the occupancy right-holder must\noccupy the land legitimately (meaning that it has not displaced\nsomeone else) and it must be rooted in that geographical space by the\nlife-plans and projects of the group\u2019s members. However,\nStilz\u2019s theory describes the holder of occupancy rights as the\nindividual; and Moore disaggregates different \u2018incidents\u2019\nof occupancy rights, so that some are held by individuals (which she\ncalls individual residency rights) and some are held by groups (which\nshe calls a group-based occupancy right). The key element, for Moore,\nin the transition to territorial rights is the group-based occupancy\nright. Both argue that occupancy requires more than physical presence:\nthe individual and/or group must be rooted in that geographical space\nby the individual life-plans, and, for Moore, the collective projects\nof the group\u2019s members.\n\nThere are three important challenges to self-determination theories.\nBoth Stilz and Moore can explain why people should not be expelled or\nrelocated\u2014because it will disrupt their located life plans\u2014but\nneither can offer precise guidelines for boundary\u2013drawing. This\nis because Moore\u2019s group occupancy principle can only identify\nheartlands of groups, but as she concedes, in many cases, this does\nnot draw precise boundaries because often groups overlap on the same\nland. It does not therefore provide an easy solution to border\ndisputes. In many cases, territories cannot be parcelled into discrete\nunits and power-sharing forms of self-determination between groups are\nnecessary in particular areas. Stilz\u2019s theory seems to be even\nless determinate with respect to identifying the location and scope of\nterritorial rights because it\u2019s not clear that individual\nlocated life plans would converge on the same place at all. Although\nStilz uses the case of Navajos as a case of a group that was wrongly\nexpelled, it\u2019s not clear where the individual Navajos are\nentitled to return to, and why their claims are any different from any\nother person, who has plans with respect to a place, and in which,\nindividual variation being as it is, there may or may not be overlap\namong different individual Navajos. \n\nSecond, the emphasis on collective self-determination as the value\nthat territorial rights realize seems to apply most straightforwardly\nto groups that engage in democratic self-determination, because then\nwe can then be confident that the state is the vehicle of the group\nself-determination. If this is so, then, both Moore and Stilz are\nvulnerable to the criticism that is parallel to one that is levelled\nagainst justice theorists, viz., that either the bar to being a\nterritorial right-holder is so high that many states would not meet it\n(which seems somewhat counter-intuitive); or the bar is so low that it\nraises questions whether such an entity could be justified on a\nself-determination argument. Both Moore and Stilz partially avoid the\nmost troubling implication of this as they argue that the appeal to\nself-determination distinguishes between internal and external threats\nto state territorial integrity and that they can thereby explain the\nvalue that is lost by external intervention. \n\nThird, whether self-determination could be realized or not depends on\nwhether the occupancy group (in Moore\u2019s theory) or the aggregate\nindividuals who have occupancy rights (in Stilz\u2019s theory) have\nthe capacity to be the right kind of agent to exercise jurisdiction.\nHowever, the capacity condition is normatively problematic. If we\ndefine capacity broadly, it suggests that any state that is conquered\nor failed lacks capacity and is therefore not an appropriate agent for\nterritorial rights. This is counter-intuitive, because many groups\nlack capacity because they have been denied it through previous\ninjustice. Thus it seems that this condition is too sensitive to power\nconfigurations for a normative theory of territorial rights. Moore\nattempts to avoid this problem by emphasizing that there are\nthird-party duties to refrain from interference and to assist groups\nthat suffer from burdened conditions. However, this strategy could be\ncriticized as being ad hoc, in the sense that it is not based\non a principled definition of what counts as\n\u2018capacity\u2019.\n4. Future Directions\n\nThe recent surge of interest in territorial justice and territorial\nrights may be attributed to the fact that it has become clear that the\ndifferent elements of the bundle of territorial rights are connected\nto a wide range of increasingly important and pressing debates, such\nas resource justice, migration and secession. Some of the most\ninteresting work on migration justice takes into account the issue of\nrights over territory (Ochoa Espejo 2016; Song 2018). The interest in\nresource justice may be connected to the obvious fact that there are\nmany different claims for common pool resources and some of these are\nbeing increasingly degraded. This makes more pressing the question of\nwho has entitlement to control resources and what are the terms under\nwhich individuals or groups should interact with such places\n(Armstrong 2017; Nine 2014, 2019; Banai 2016). Armstrong (2017, 2018),\nhas focused on resource justice and on the special case of the oceans\nwhich is a particularly significant common pool resource. Some of this\ninterest is connected to technological innovations which make possible\nharvesting resources in the seabed, or potentially in space. \n\nAnother area of recent interest has been the implications of occupancy\nrights, which are discussed in self-determination theories, and has\nrecently been deployed in relation to indigenous land rights (Colburn\n2019), gentrification (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018), wrongful\nexpulsion from land (Moore 2013), and people who inhabit islands which\nare doomed to sink with the effect of climate change (Blomfield 2019;\nKolers 2012a; Nine 2019). If these theorists are correct to theorize a\nmoral relationship between people and place, then, the loss suffered\nby people who are displaced by climate change cannot be redressed\nfully simply by allowing them to migrate to another place: they have\nlost their home and community, and the place that they are attached\nto. \n\nThere is also a burgeoning literature on territorial rights that\nquestion the fixity of current theories, and give greater attention to\nthe overlapping and fluid nature of human\u2019s relations to the\nnatural world and its implications for governance, resources, and\ndiverse claims (see Mancilla forthcoming; Nine forthcoming). This is\nanother instance of the way in which focus on territory and\nterritorial justice has implications for a wide set of literatures in\nquite different areas, and potentially gives rise to a host of related\narguments on diverse topics.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Select Bibliography"], "cat_ref_text": {"Select Bibliography": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anderson, Benedict, 1983, <em>Imagined Communities: Reflections on\nthe Origin and Spread of Nationalism</em>, London: Verso.", "Angeli, Oliviero, 2015, <em>Cosmopolitanism, Self-Determination\nand Territory</em>, London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.\ndoi:10.1057/9781137004956", "Angell, Kim, forthcoming, \u201cNew Territorial Rights for\nSinking Island States\u201d, <em>European Journal of Political\nTheory</em>, first online: 16 November 2017.\ndoi:10.1177/1474885117741748", "Armitage, David, 2012, <em>Foundations of Modern International\nThought</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\ndoi:10.1017/CBO9781139032940", "Armstrong, Chris, 2015, \u201cAgainst \u2018Permanent\nSovereignty\u2019 over Natural Resources\u201d, <em>Politics,\nPhilosophy &amp; Economics</em>, 14(2): 129\u2013151.\ndoi:10.1177/1470594X14523080", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, <em>Justice and Natural Resources: An\nEgalitarian Theory</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2018, \u201cResources Outside of the\nState: Governing the Ocean and Beyond\u201d, <em>Philosophy\nCompass</em>, 13(11): e12545. doi:10.1111/phc3.12545", "Banai, Ayelet, 2014, \u201cThe Territorial Rights of Legitimate\nStates: A Pluralist Interpretation\u201d, <em>International\nTheory</em>, 6(1): 140\u2013157. doi:10.1017/S1752971914000074", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cSovereignty over Natural\nResources and Its Implications for Climate Justice: Sovereignty over\nNatural Resources\u201d, <em>Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate\nChange</em>, 7(2): 238\u2013250. doi:10.1002/wcc.383", "Blake, Michael and Mathias Risse, 2008, \u201cMigration,\nTerritoriality and Culture\u201d, in <em>New Waves in Applied\nEthics</em>, Jesper Ryber, Thomas Petersen, and Clark Wolf (eds),\nLondon: Palgrave: 53\u201381.", "Blomfield, Megan, 2019, <em>Global Justice, Natural Resources, and\nClimate Change</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.\ndoi:10.1093/oso/9780198791737.001.0001", "Buchanan, Allen, 2003a, <em>Justice, Legitimacy, and\nSelf-Determination: Moral Foundations for International Law</em>,\nOxford: Oxford University Press. doi:10.1093/0198295359.001.0001", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2003b, \u201cThe Making and Unmaking of\nBoundaries: What Liberalism Has to Say\u201d, in Buchanan and Moore\n(eds.) 2003, pp. 231\u2013261. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511613937.012", "Buchanan, Allen and Margaret Moore (eds.), 2003, <em>States,\nNations and Borders: The Ethics of Making Boundaries</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511613937", "Coburn, Veldon, 2019, \u201cPartition, Secession, Annexation:\nReframing the Algonquins of Ontario Modern Treaty Process\u201d Paper\npresented to the <em>Conference on Indigenous Land Rights and\nReconciliation,</em> Queen\u2019s University, Sept. 5\u20136.", "Elden, Stuart, 2013, <em>The Birth of Territory</em>, Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press.", "Gans, Chaim, 2003, <em>The Limits of Nationalism</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511490231", "Grotius, Hugo, c. 1615 [2004], \u201cDefense of Chapter V of the\n<em>Mare Liberum</em>\u201d, Reprinted in <em>The Free Sea</em>,\nDavid Armitage (ed.), Herbert F.
