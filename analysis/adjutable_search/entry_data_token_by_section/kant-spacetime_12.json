    "main_text": "What is transcendental idealism? || Kant\u2019s criticisms of Berkeley\n6.2 Conclusions\n\nThe reading (provided above) of what makes transcendental idealism\ntranscendental hints at a further way of clarifying\nKant\u2019s overarching position. His view is not just that space is\nnot a property of things independent of intuition per se, but\nthat space is not a property of things independent of a\npriori intuition. That distinguishes Kant\u2019s conception from\nthe idealism of a thinker like Berkeley, for Kant denies, as we have\nseen, the view that space is somehow dependent upon empirical\nintuition. This point, in turn, highlights a significant parallel\nbetween the first and second arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition\nand its third and fourth arguments. Just as the latter two arguments\nallow Kant to distinguish his idealism from Leibniz\u2019s based on\nthe notion that the representation of space is non-conceptual, the\nformer two arguments allow him to distinguish his idealism from\nBerkeley\u2019s based on the notion that the representation of space\nis non-empirical. Hence the \u201cdogmatic\u201d idealism of\nBerkeley and the \u201cempirical\u201d idealism of Leibniz are each\nruled out by considering the content and origin of the representation\nof space. That, at least, would seem to form part of Kant\u2019s\nintention in the Transcendental Aesthetic, especially in the\nMetaphysical Exposition. This indicates that Berkeleyan and Leibnizian\nidealist views can be construed as conceptions of the relation between\nspace and intuition. Whereas Berkeley takes space to be dependent on\nempirical intuition, Leibniz takes it to be independent of\nintuition per se. This illuminates Kant\u2019s concern in\nthe Transcendental Aesthetic with our representation of space:\nconsidering that representation in particular allows Kant to tackle\nother conceptions of the relation between space and intuition.\n\nFinally, transcendental idealism, in so far as it concerns space and\ntime, has the following essential component: we have a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. Part of Kant\u2019s\ninnovation is to introduce into the philosophical lexicon the very\nidea that we can have non-empirical intuition. It is improbable that\nwe can interpret this idea correctly unless we remind ourselves that\nKant rigorously distinguishes between sensation and intuition. That\ndistinction, in turn, forms a crucial component in Kant\u2019s\nextensive rejection of the Leibnizian doctrine of perception. It is\nonly with the rejection of that doctrine that we can understand\nKant\u2019s break with the Leibnizian view of space and time in the\nright light.\n",
