When Iberians arrived at the Americas,\nAmerindians were scattered throughout an enormous territory, divided by\nsubstantially different cultures, including numerous languages.\nIberians imposed a colonial unity on them, but the question of their\nidentity became critical, particularly after Africans were brought in\nto make up a labor deficit in the Caribbean and the East coast of South\nAmerica. How do all these peoples fit together as a people or a nation,\nand how are they to be conceived? The question of identity first\nsurfaced in the discussions about the rights of Amerindians, and later\nof African slaves, but extended to Iberian born versus American born\nEuropeans. \n\nThe issue became critical during the period of independence, when those\nwho fought against the Spanish domination in particular faced the task\nof forming nations of a population that was diverse in race, culture,\nand origin. Liberators such as Bol\u00edvar and Mart\u00ed\nunderstood well the challenge and rejected race in particular as a\ndivide among the different populations from which they sought to forge\nunified nations (see Aguilar Rivera and Schutte in Gracia, 2011). They\nproposed notions of national unity based on a mixed population under\nideals of political self-determination.\n\nThis emphasis changed after independence, in response to the pressing\nneeds for national development and progress. Positivist philosophers,\nsuch as Sarmiento, frequently advocated national policies that favored\nEuropean immigration as a way of undermining the racial and ethnic\ndifferences that divided the population (see Burke and Humphrey in\nGracia, 2011). These policies were often based on a negative view of\nboth Amerindians and Africans. Moreover, these policies failed to\nachieve the goals their proponents sought. The failure of positivist\nideas to help define the identity of the populations of the various\nnations gave rise to a reaction, most evident in the Mexican\nRevolution, to turn back to the Amerindian past as a way to find a\nunity that would make nations of the diverse population. Notions of\nboth national and Latin American unity were proposed on various grounds\nat this time. For some, as is the case with Vasconcelos, the unity is\nracial, a result of the mixing of the various races that constitute the\nLatin American populations (see von Vacano in Gracia, 2011). For\nothers\u2014such as Zea\u2014the cultural unity of these populations\nprovided the basis of national or Latin American identity (see Oliver\nin Gracia, 2011).\n\nThe efforts to find an effective way to define the identity of Latin\nAmericans has continued unabated in Latin America, and has found\nfertile ground in the work of Latino/a philosophers working in the\nUnited States. Efforts to define the racial, ethnic and national\nboundaries of the identity of Latin Americans and of Latinos/as in the\nUnited States have been pursued by such authors as Alcoff, Corlett, and\nGracia (see Mill\u00e1n and Vel\u00e1squez in Gracia, 2011).\n",
