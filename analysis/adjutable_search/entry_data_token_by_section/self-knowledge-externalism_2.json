    "main_text": "The Reductio to Armchair Knowledge of the External World || Reply 1: Environmental Implications are Empirical\n2.1 Reply 1: Environmental Implications are Empirical\n\nYet it may remain unclear whether EXT is committed to (1). For the\nthought experiments alone do not assume that water is\nnecessary for water thoughts (Brueckner 1992). The thought\nexperiments indeed assume that suitable interaction with water is\nsufficient for Oscar to have water thoughts. They also assume\nthat Twin Oscar\u2019s interactions with XYZ are insufficient. But\nthis does not yet imply that interacting with water is the\nonly way that someone can arrive at water thoughts.\n\nHowever, this assumes that E is a condition where water exists\n(or existed at one time). Yet the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio\nneed not assume that (McKinsey 1994; 2002; 2007). One can first see\nthe incompatibilist as presenting a dilemma, corresponding to two ways\nthat EXT might be interpreted. On the first reading, EXT holds that a\nwater thought logically or conceptually implies some\nenvironmental condition E. Yet for the incompatibilist, logical\nor conceptual implications are apriori. So if EXT on this first\nreading is true, (1) is apriori (and nothing here prejudges what\nE\n is).[12]\n\nEven so, the first reading is not the usual interpretation of EXT. On\na more standard construal, EXT holds that a water thought\nmetaphysically implies some environmental condition E.\nYet metaphysical implications, e.g., that\u201cwater is wet\u201d\nimplies \u201cH2O is wet,\u201d are not always apriori.\n(See Kripke 1972 and the entry on\n Rigid Designators).\n So the apriority of (1) is not guaranteed here, and the reductio\nseems in doubt.\n\nYet incompatibilists reply that the second reading cannot be what is\nreally intended. For it renders EXT into something\ntrivial\u2014it is obvious that Oscar\u2019s water thoughts\nmetaphysically imply a number of external conditions, e.g., that Oscar\nwas born (McKinsey, 1994; 2002; 2007, Rowlands 2003). But EXT is\nsupposed to be more substantive than that. Compatibilists reply,\nhowever, that the thought experiments suggest that a water thought\nmetaphysically implies some content specific environmental\ncondition, such as the existence of water (Brueckner\n1995).\n\nSo the way seems clear for the compatibilist to reject the apriority\nof (1). But as before, the incompatibilist may respond that we are\nillicitly assuming E to be the condition simply that water\nexists. Yet the strongest version of the reductio may not assume that.\nOne might instead understand E as follows:\n\nE = Water or a community using the water concept exists\n(or, existed) (Brown 1995, Boghossian 1997).\n\n\nIf E is identified as this disjunctive condition, it is more\nbelievable that (1) is apriori under EXT. And if that is believed, the\nreductio then presses that EXT permits apriori knowledge that\neither water or a community exists. Yet that too\nshould not be apriori.\n\nBut assuming (4), why would EXT render (1) apriori? Granted, many\nexternalists find it apriori plausible that besides interacting with\nwater, Oscar could acquire the water concept from other community\nmembers. That suggests that if Oscar has acquired the concept, (4)\nmust be true. However, some externalists conjecture that there are\nother conditions under which the water concept can be acquired. Even\nif Oscar is socially isolated and lives in a waterless environment, he\ncan conceivably arrive at the concept by hypothesizing the\nH2O molecule (Burge 1982). If this cannot be ruled out\napriori, then EXT does not secure the apriority of (1)\u2014even if\n(4) is assumed.\n\nYet incompatibilists reply that (ironically) these very\nreflections reveal apriori something that should not be apriori\n(Brown 1995, Boghossian 1997). Namely: If Oscar is aware that\nhe has no such hypotheses (i.e., if he is \u201cagnostic\u201d about\nchemical essences), then (1) must be knowable apriori. In more detail,\nif Oscar is agnostic about chemistry and knows that apriori about\nhimself, he can use the reflections above to know apriori that his\nwater thoughts metaphysically require the existence of water or a\ncommunity. From there, apriori knowledge of E seems\nimminent.\n\nNevertheless, the compatibilist\u2019s opening objection lingers:\nNothing yet shows that the only ways to acquire water\nthoughts, under EXT, are in the ways catalogued so far (Ball 2007).\nFor all that has been shown, it remains possible that essence-agnostic\nOscar is socially isolated and his water thoughts reference no natural\nkind. (See also Gallois & Hawthorne 1996, Gallois 2008, and\nMcLaughlin & Tye 1998a, b, c.)\n\nBut perhaps additional apriori considerations can rule this out (Brown\n1995). Suppose that Oscar has the concept of a sofa and knowledgeably\napplies the concept in a variety of cases. Yet assume he is agnostic\non whether the concept applies to broad overstuffed armchairs. Then,\nif Oscar has no community to settle the matter, EXT may suggest that\nOscar\u2019s concept is indeterminate in what it refers to.\nAnd that seems odd.\n\nHowever, the compatibilist may ask why this is supposed to be a\nproblem (McLaughlin & Tye, 1998a, b, c). The indeterminacy may\nshow only that Oscar\u2019s concept is vague and not that\nOscar fails to possess any concept whatsoever. (Brown 2001 replies by\ndefining \u2018agnostic\u2019 so it applies only if the concept is\nnon-vague. Yet Brown 2004, ch. 8 concedes that Oscar then can no\nlonger know apriori if he is \u201cagnostic.\u201d) So, here too, it\nseems that EXT does not reveal apriori that water thoughts\nmetaphysically require a content specific environmental condition.\n",
