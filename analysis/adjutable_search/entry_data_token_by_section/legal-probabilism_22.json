    "main_text": "Standards of Proof || Alternatives to probabilistic thresholds\n5.4 Alternatives to probabilistic thresholds\n\nThere exist several theoretical alternatives to the probabilistic\ninterpretation of proof standards in the scholarly literature.\nPennington and Hastie (1991, 1993) have proposed the story\nmodel according to which judges and jurors first make sense of\nthe evidence by constructing stories of what happened, and then select\nthe best story on the basis of multiple criteria, such as coherence,\nfit with the evidence and completeness.  Pardo and Allen (2008) argue\nthat the version of the facts that best explains the evidence should\nprevail in a court of law. On the role of coherence and story\nconstruction in evidence assessment and decision-making at trial, see\n(Amaya 2015; Griffin 2013; Simon 2004).\n \n\nAnother approach is due to Gordon, Prakken, and Walton (2007) and\nPrakken and Sartor (2009) who view the trial as a place in which\narguments and counterarguments confront one another. The party that\nhas the best arguments, all things considered, should prevail. On this\nview, probability estimates can themselves be the target of objections\nand counterarguments. Along these lines, Stein (2008) argues that, in\norder to warrant a verdict against the defendant, the evidence should have survived individualized scrutiny, not merely support a high probability of liability.\n\nPhilosophers and legal theorists have also leveled distinctively\nepistemological critiques. Ho (2008) and Haack (2014) hold that\ndegrees of epistemic warrant for a claim, which depend on multiple\nfactors\u2014such as the extent to which the evidence supports the\nclaim and it is comprehensive\u2014cannot be equated to\nprobabilities. Gardiner (2019) argues that standards of proof should\nrule out all error possibilities that are relevant and these need not\ncoincide with error possibilities that are probable. Finally, some\nepistemologists argue that a belief that is assigned high probability, no matter how high,\nis not enough to warrant knowledge, and knowledge should be the\nstandard for trial verdicts (Blome-Tillmann 2017; Duff et al. 2007; Levanon 2019; Littlejohn 2020; Moss\nforthcoming).\n\nScholars and commentators have also voiced more specific objections\nthat need not invalidate the probabilistic framework but rather call\nfor refinements. Nance (2016) argues that the evidence on which to\nbase a trial decision should be reasonably complete\u2014it should be\nall the evidence that one would reasonably expect to see from a\nconscientious investigation of the facts. A similar argument can be\nfound in Davidson and Pargetter (1987). Arguably, probability-based\ndecision thresholds can accommodate these considerations, for example,\nby lowering the probability of civil or criminal liability whenever\nthe body of evidence is one-sided or incomplete (Friedman 1996;\nKaye 1979c, 1986). Another strategy is to give a probability-based\naccount of the notion of completeness of the evidence and other\nseemingly non-probabilistic criteria (Urbaniak 2018).\n\nThere are a plethora of other objections. The puzzles of naked\nstatistical evidence and the conjunction paradox are two of the most\nwidely debated in the literature. These and other objections are\nexamined in the sections that follow.\n",
