Since the philosopher uses only sense data\nand self-evident propositions, his inquiry may come to different\nconclusion than that of the theologian, who has additional knowledge\nfrom Scripture. The philosopher makes judgments about the world from a\nlimited human perspective, whereas the theologian is helped by divine\n revelation.[19]\n Yet Marsilius took the task of the philosopher seriously because he\nthought the human mind has a natural tendency to search for truth,\nwhich is satisfied (although not ultimately satisfied) in natural\nphilosophy and\n metaphysics.[20]\n2.2.1 Creation\n\nAccording to the principles of natural philosophy, creation from\nnothing is impossible. The senses show that things always come from\nother things. Because there is no serious reason to doubt the\ninformation given by the senses, the human mind legitimately jumps to\nthe universal principle that nothing can come from nothing, driven by\nthe natural tendency to search for truth. Consequently, for the human\nmind creation from nothing is impossible. It contradicts the universal\nprinciple that nothing comes from nothing. That God has created the\nworld from nothing is therefore only a matter of faith (sola fide\nest creditum). Revelation shows that human knowledge of creation\nis limited, but it cannot be aided by natural philosophy at this\n point.[21]\n2.2.2 Theory of the Human Soul\n\nIn the later Middle Ages the study of the soul was part of natural\nphilosophy. Marsilius treated the human soul in his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima, in which he followed the Parisian\ntradition of Buridan and Oresme concerning the particular questions\naddressed. Following Buridan, he argued that there is no natural proof\nof the immortality of the human soul. For the human natural mind,\nunaided by revelation, the theory of Alexander of Aphrodisias that the\nhuman soul is corruptible is the most probable. That Alexander of\nAphrodisias is mistaken and that the soul continues to exist after the\ndeath of the body is known through revelation alone. Faith has more\nauthority than human reason and must be accepted in all cases where\nthe two conflict since the things we believe on faith come from God,\nwho cannot\n err.[22]\n",
