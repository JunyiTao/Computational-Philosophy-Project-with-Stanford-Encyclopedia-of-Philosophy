    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Action || Action, Freedom, and Plurality\n4.1 Action, Freedom, and Plurality\n\n\nAction, the only activity that goes on directly between men without\nthe intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human\ncondition of plurality \u2026 this plurality is specifically the\ncondition \u2014 not only the conditio sine qua non, but the\nconditio per quam \u2014 of all political life. (HC,\n7)\n\n\nFor Arendt, action is one of the fundamental categories of the human\ncondition and constitutes the highest realization of the vita\nactiva. Arendt analyzes the vita activa via three\ncategories which correspond to the three fundamental activities of our\nbeing-in-the-world: labor, work, and action. Labor is the activity\nwhich is tied to the human condition of life, work the activity which\nis tied to the condition of worldliness, and action the activity tied\nto the condition of plurality. For Arendt each activity is autonomous,\nin the sense of having its own distinctive principles and of being\njudged by different criteria. Labor is judged by its ability to\nsustain human life, to cater to our biological needs of consumption\nand reproduction, work is judged by its ability to build and maintain\na world fit for human use, and action is judged by its ability to\ndisclose the identity of the agent, to affirm the reality of the\nworld, and to actualize our capacity for freedom.\n\n\nAlthough Arendt considers the three activities of labor, work and\naction equally necessary to a complete human life, in the sense that\neach contributes in its distinctive way to the realization of our\nhuman capacities, it is clear from her writings that she takes action\nto be the differentia specifica of human beings, that which\ndistinguishes them from both the life of animals (who are similar to\nus insofar as they need to labor to sustain and reproduce themselves)\nand the life of the gods (with whom we share, intermittently, the\nactivity of contemplation). In this respect the categories of labor\nand work, while significant in themselves, must be seen as\ncounterpoints to the category of action, helping to differentiate and\nhighlight the place of action within the order of the vita\nactiva.\n\n\nThe two central features of action are freedom and\nplurality. By freedom Arendt does not mean the\nability to choose among a set of possible alternatives (the freedom of\nchoice so dear to the liberal tradition) or the faculty of liberum\narbitrium which, according to Christian doctrine, was given to us\nby God. Rather, by freedom Arendt means the capacity to begin, to\nstart something new, to do the unexpected, with which all human beings\nare endowed by virtue of being born. Action as the realization of\nfreedom is therefore rooted in natality, in the fact that\neach birth represents a new beginning and the introduction of novelty\nin the world.\n\n\nTo be sure, Arendt recognizes that all activities are in some way\nrelated to the phenomenon of natality, since both labor and work are\nnecessary to create and preserve a world into which new human beings\nare constantly born. However, of the three activities, action is the\none most closely connected with natality, because by acting\nindividuals re-enact the miracle of beginning inherent in their\nbirth. For Arendt, the beginning that each of us represents by virtue\nof being born is actualized every time we act, that is, every time we\nbegin something new. As she puts it: \u201cthe new beginning inherent\nin birth can make itself felt in the world only because the newcomer\npossesses the capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting\n\u201d (HC, 9).\n\n\nArendt also stresses the fact that since action as beginning is rooted\nin natality, since it is the actualization of freedom, it carries with\nit the capacity to perform miracles, that is, to introduce what is\ntotally unexpected. \u201cIt is in the nature of beginning\u201d\n\u2014 she claims \u2014 \u201cthat something new is started which\ncannot be expected from whatever may have happened before. This\ncharacter of startling unexpectedness is inherent in all beginnings\n\u2026 The fact that man is capable of action means that the\nunexpected can be expected from him, that he is able to perform what\nis infinitely improbable. And this again is possible only because each\nman is unique, so that with each birth something uniquely new comes\ninto the world \u201d (HC, 177\u20138).\n\n\nThe birth of every individual is thus the promise of a new beginning:\nto act means to be able to disclose one\u2019s self and to do the\nunanticipated; and it is entirely in keeping with this conception that\nmost of the concrete examples of action in the modern age that Arendt\ndiscusses are cases of revolutions and popular uprisings. Her claim is\nthat \u201crevolutions are the only political events which confront\nus directly and inevitably with the problem of beginning,\u201d (OR,\n21) since they represent the attempt to found a new political space, a\nspace where freedom can appear as a worldly reality. The favorite\nexample for Arendt is the American Revolution, because there the act\nof foundation took the form of a constitution of liberty. Her other\nexamples are the revolutionary clubs of the French Revolution, the\nParis Commune of 1871, the creation of Soviets during the Russian\nRevolution, the French Resistance to Hitler in the Second World War,\nand the Hungarian revolt of 1956. In all these cases individual men\nand women had the courage to interrupt their routine activities, to\nstep forward from their private lives in order to create a public\nspace where freedom could appear, and to act in such a way that the\nmemory of their deeds could become a source of inspiration for the\nfuture. In doing so, according to Arendt, they rediscovered the truth\nknown to the ancient Greeks that action is the supreme blessing of\nhuman life, that which bestows significance to the lives of\nindividuals.\n\n\nIn the book On Revolution Arendt devotes much attention to\nthe rediscovery of this truth by those who participated in the\nAmerican Revolution. In her view the Founding Fathers, although they\nmight have pretended that they longed for private life and engaged in\npolitics only out of a sense of duty, made clear in their letters and\nrecollections that they had discovered unexpected delights in action\nand had acquired a taste for public freedom and for earning\ndistinction among their peers.\n\nPlurality, to which we may now turn, is the other\ncentral feature of action. For if to act means to take the initiative,\nto introduce the novum and the unexpected into the world, it\nalso means that it is not something that can be done in isolation from\nothers, that is, independently of the presence of a plurality of\nactors who from their different perspectives can judge the quality of\nwhat is being enacted. In this respect action needs plurality in the\nsame way that performance artists need an audience; without the\npresence and acknowledgment of others, action would cease to be a\nmeaningful activity. Action, to the extent that it requires appearing\nin public, making oneself known through words and deeds, and eliciting\nthe consent of others, can only exist in a context defined by\nplurality.\n\n\nArendt establishes the connection between action and plurality by\nmeans of an anthropological argument. In her view just as\nlife is the condition that corresponds to the activity of\nlabor and worldliness the condition that corresponds to the\nactivity of work, so plurality is the condition that\ncorresponds to action. She defines plurality as \u201cthe fact that\nmen, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world,\u201d and says\nthat it is the condition of human action \u201cbecause we are all the\nsame, that is, human, in such a way that nobody is ever the same as\nanyone else who ever lived, lives, or will live \u201d (HC,\n7\u20138). Plurality thus refers both to equality and\ndistinction, to the fact that all human beings belong to the\nsame species and are sufficiently alike to understand one another, but\nyet no two of them are ever interchangeable, since each of them is an\nindividual endowed with a unique biography and perspective on the\nworld.\n\n\nIt is by virtue of plurality that each of us is capable of acting and\nrelating to others in ways that are unique and distinctive, and in so\ndoing of contributing to a network of actions and relationships that\nis infinitely complex and unpredictable. This network of actions is\nwhat makes up the realm of human affairs, that space where individuals\nrelate directly without the intermediary of things or matter \u2014\nthat is, through language. Let us examine briefly this connection\nbetween action and language.\n\n In The Human Condition Arendt stresses repeatedly that\naction is primarily symbolic in character and that the web of human\nrelationships is sustained by communicative interaction (HC,\n178\u20139, 184\u20136, 199\u2013200). We may formulate it as\nfollows. Action entails speech: by means of language we are\nable to articulate the meaning of our actions and to coordinate the\nactions of a plurality of agents.  Conversely, speech entails\naction, not only in the sense that speech itself is a form of\naction, or that most acts are performed in the manner of speech, but\nin the sense that action is often the means whereby we check the\nsincerity of the speaker. Thus, just as action without speech runs the\nrisk of being meaningless and would be impossible to coordinate with\nthe actions of others, so speech without action would lack one of the\nmeans by which we may confirm the veracity of the speaker. As we shall\nsee, this link between action and speech is central to Arendt\u2019s\ncharacterization of power, that potential which springs up between\npeople when they act \u201cin concert,\u201d and which is actualized\n\u201conly where word and deed have not parted company, where words\nare not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil\nintentions but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to\nviolate and destroy but to establish relations and create new\nrealities \u201d (HC, 200).\n",
