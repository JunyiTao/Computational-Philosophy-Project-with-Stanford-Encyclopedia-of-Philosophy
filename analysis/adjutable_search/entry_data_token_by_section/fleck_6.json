How a Thought Collective Transforms What Is Socially Constructed Into \u201cReality\u201d?\n\nAs explained above, what and how we see and what and how we think\ndepends on a collectively created thought style assimilated through\ncontacts with others. However,\n\nThe individual within the collective is never, or hardly ever,\nconscious of the prevailing thought style, which almost always exerts\nan absolutely compulsive force upon his thinking and with which it is\nnot possible to be at variance (1935a, II.4).\n\n\nIt is peculiar that those who participate in social creation of a\nthought style do not sometimes realize it either. After years they do\nnot remember that once they perceived and thought differently, and\nthey recall their research not as a winding road, full of turns, blind\nsteps, successes resulting from compensation of accidental errors,\netc. And above all they do not record in their memory those moments\nwhen new ideas appeared as a result of misunderstandings between\nresearchers. Fleck compares Wassermann\u2019s texts from different\nperiods and his memories on the road which his team took and which\nfinally led him to the discovery of reaction that now carries his\nname. This comparison shows that after years Wassermann did not\nrealize how in the past, during collective debates and research, facts\nand meanings of words, research problems and methods of solving them\nhad changed. \u201c(\u2026) after fifteen years an identification\nbetween results and intentions had taken place in Wassermann\u2019s\nthinking. The meandering process of development (\u2026) had become\na straight, goal-directed path\u201d (1935a, III).\n\nScientists also do not see the changes of facts and concepts that had\nhappened in their discipline. Since they perceive the world\ndifferently than their predecessors and they think on the basis of\ndifferent assumptions, they are not able to understand the meanings of\nwords from old texts. They do not know that in the past one not so\nmuch thought differently (for incorrectly) about what they now think\nabout, and perceived differently (for incorrectly) what they perceive,\nas one thought of and perceived something else. They instinctively\nunderstand old books and papers according to their own thought style\nand consider those texts as steps\u2014although sometimes\nerroneous\u2014towards this world-view which they possess now.\n\nThe next aspect of social nature of cognition is the phenomenon that\nmembers of a thought collective mutually reinforce themselves in the\nconviction that their thought style is true. Members of religious\ncommunities under group pressure do not consider their faith as one of\nmany, but as the definite truth; they do not consider the principles\nof conduct which their faith imposes on them as the principles of one\nof many ways of living, but as those grasping of the essence of\nmorality etc. Also scientists are convinced that their thought style\nis at least partially true today, and with time, when they work\ntogether, it will get closer and closer to being true. Yet, one may\nsay, the conviction as to the truth of a thought style can break down\nunder the pressure of facts that contradict it, and also as a result\nof confrontation with those who think differently. The remarks given\nabove quite clearly show that this is not the case. Nonetheless let us\nsummarize Fleck\u2019s views on those matters.\n\n\n\nA thought style is included already in meanings of words, and those\nmeanings are considered by members of the collective not as something\nformed by people but as \u201cobjective\u201d. Thus, opposing a\nsystem is unthinkable: someone who opposes it is considered to be the\none who does not understand meanings of the words used (1935a, IV.5;\n1936, VI).\n\n\nScientific instruments which embody some results of a thought style,\n\u201cdirect our thinking automatically on to the tracks of that\nstyle\u201d (1936, VI).\n\n\nForming our cognitive activity, our perception and thinking,\n\u201c[c]ognition modifies the knower so as to adapt him harmoniously\nto his acquired knowledge\u201d (1935a, IV.2). Since everybody sees\nthe world in a way imposed by one\u2019s thought style, in every step\none notices facts corresponding with that style and does not notice\nwhat does not fit active assumptions of it.\n\n\nEven if facts incoherent with a given thought style are noticed, one\nignores them as unimportant. For example, for several decades\nphysicists knew that Mercury had not moved as it should according to\nNewton\u2019s mechanics, but they failed to mention this fact to the\ngeneral public. Only today one precisely describes those facts because\nthey confirm a new thought style: the general theory of relativity\n(1935a, II.3).\n\n\nCognitive problems we choose to solve do not come from a neutral\nreservoir of problems which existed prior to the development of\nsciences, but we choose those which are born on the ground of a\nthought style imposed on us\u2014and they are usually successfully\nsolved within its confines. And we do not work with problems which are\nborn within other styles\u2014our collective considers them not\nworthy of attention or even senseless (1935a, IV.3).\n\n\nWhen anomalies can be no longer ignored, one attempts to show that\nthey are not incompatible with one\u2019s thought style (1935a,\nII.3). (Today we would say one adds to the system various ad\nhoc hypotheses.)\n\n\nSometimes in old texts we find descriptions of results of experiments\nwhich we, as the users of another thought style, consider illusions.\nIt happens that somebody sees something what corresponds with\nprevailing views and other members of a collective confirm his\nexperiences (1935a, II.3).\n\n\nSo it is not possible to compare a theory with \u201creality in\nitself\u201d. It is true that those who use a thought style give\narguments for their views, but those arguments are of restricted\nvalue. Any attempt to legitimize a particular view is inextricably\nbound to standards developed within a given style, and those who\naccept those standards accept also the style. So legitimization is\nactually unnecessary, for it occurs within a collective with more or\nless similar education and a thought-stylized intellectual\nconstitution. \u201cIn science, as in art and in life, only that\nwhich is true to culture is true to nature\u201d (1935a, II.3).\n\nOne may however insist, that not only reality exists but also other\npeople with other thought styles. Can they not convince us that our\nthought style is erroneous? No\u2014for every human thinks that those\nwho belong to the same thought collective as she does are\n\u201cnormal\u201d and authoritative, and everybody else is\ndisregarded as more or less \u201cabnormal\u201d (1938). Since\neverybody\u2019s attention is directed at members of one\u2019s\ncollective, one finds confirmation of one\u2019s own views\neverywhere. Moreover, the conviction that we have possessed truth is\nempowered by the circulation of thoughts between esoteric and exoteric\ncircles. Laymen accept a specialist\u2019s opinion as revelation, and\nwhen that opinion returns from laypersons to the specialist, she\nconsiders it the people\u2019s voice confirming her achievements.\n\nWhen members of various thought collectives meet, a peculiar\nphenomenon occurs. One sees passive elements in one\u2019s thought\nstyle, but the active ones remain almost unnoticed. However,\n\u201cany alien thought style appears like a free flight of fancy,\nbecause he can see only that which is active and almost arbitrary\nabout it\u201d (1935a, IV.5). Since passive results obtained within\nanother thought style appear to her as erroneous \u2013 as they are\nbuilt on an arbitrary and false basis\u2014she is not able to see\ntheir merits and does not understand that people thinking differently\nsuccessfully use their own world view. This leads us to the phenomenon\ncalled \u201cincommensurability\u201d.\n",
