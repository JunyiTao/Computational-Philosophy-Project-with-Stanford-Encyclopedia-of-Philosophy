    "main_text": "Religious Belief\n15. Marcel in Dialogue\n\nFour decades after his death, Marcel\u2019s philosophy continues to\ngenerate a steady stream of creative scholarship that, if modest in\nvolume, nevertheless attests to his continued relevance for the\ncontemporary philosophical landscape. Marcel\u2019s influence on\ncontemporary philosophy is apparent, for example, in the work of Paul\nRicoeur, his most famous student. Through Ricoeur, Marcel has\ninfluenced contemporary philosophy in and around the hermeneutic\ntradition. The pattern of \u201cdetour and return\u201d that\ncharacterizes Ricoeur and some of his students closely resembles\nMarcel\u2019s dialectic of primary and secondary\n reflection.[13]\n Likewise, Marcel\u2019s understanding of otherness\u2014illustrated\nby his image of \u201cconstellations,\u201d conglomerations of\nmeaningfully connected but non-totalizable beings\u2014is an explicit\nchallenge to philosophers of absolute otherness including Emmanuel\nLevinas, Jacques Derrida, and John D. Caputo, and a valuable resource\nfor philosophers with a chiastic understanding of otherness, including\nRicoeur and Richard Kearney. In addition, Marcel\u2019s philosophy\noffers rich possibilities for dialogue with contemporary ontologies\nstruggling to address the problem of \u201cbeing\u201d without\nsuccumbing to ethical \u201cviolence\u201d or\n\u201contotheological\u201d conceptions of God. As such, his\nphilosophy should be of interest to scholars interested in the work of\nMartin Heidegger, Jean-Luc Marion, Merold Westphal and others\nphilosophizing at the intersection of philosophy and theology.\nFinally, his insistence that philosophy should illuminate our lived\nexperience and his insistence on concrete examples have much in common\nwith thinkers who view philosophy as a \u201cway of life,\u201d\nincluding Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault. The resources of\nMarcel\u2019s philosophy have only begun to be tapped, and one may\nhope that the recent republication of what are arguably Marcel\u2019s\ntwo most important works, The Mystery of Being (by St.\nAugustine\u2019s Press) and Creative Fidelity (by Fordham\nUniversity Press), will help to fuel a renaissance in scholarship\nconcerning this remarkable thinker.\n\nMarcel\u2019s thought continues to endure and a steady stream of\nstudies regularly appear in different disciplines that draw attention\nto the relevance of Marcel\u2019s central ideas for our concerns in\ntwentieth first century philosophy, theology and culture. These works\ninclude Sweetman (2008), an analysis of Marcel\u2019s view of the\nperson and its implications for issues in epistemology and philosophy\nof religion; and Hernandez (2011), a detailed study of Marcel\u2019s\nreligious philosophy from the point of view of his reflections on\nethics. Traenor\u2019s work (2007) places Marcel into dialogue (and\ndebate) with Levinas on the question of the other, while at the same\ntime arguing that their views on the other are incompatible; Tunstall\n(2013) discusses and develops Marcel\u2019s ideas about\ndehumanization with regard to the topic of racism; Tattum (2013)\nplaces Marcel in dialogue with thinkers such as Bergson, Levinas,\nRicoeur and Derrida on the concept of time, while Pierre Colin (2009)\nreturns to Marcel\u2019s views of the experience of hope.\n\nMarcel remains one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth\ncentury, and his major themes continue to be relevant for the plight\nof humanity in the twentieth first century. Many find Marcel\u2019s\nthought attractive because he emphasizes a number of significant ideas\nthat have been influential in twentieth century thinking in both\nphilosophy and theology: the attempt to preserve the dignity and\nintegrity of the human person by emphasizing the inadequacy of the\nmaterialistic life and the unavoidable human need for transcendence;\nthe inability of philosophy to capture the profundity and depth of key\nhuman experiences, and so the need to find a deeper kind of\nreflection; the emphasis on the human experience of intersubjectivity,\nwhich Marcel believes is at the root of human fulfillment; and a\nseeking after the transcendent dimension of human experience, a\ndimension that he believes cannot be denied without loss, and that\noften gives meaning to many of our most profound experiences. Marcel\nis also regarded as important by a range of thinkers in different\ndisciplines because he presents an alternative vision to challenge the\nmoral relativism and spiritual nihilism of his French rival, Jean Paul\nSartre, and other representative existentialist philosophers (Marcel,\n1995, pp. 47-90). For this important reason, his work continues to\nspeak to many of our concerns today in ethics, politics, and\nreligion.\n",
