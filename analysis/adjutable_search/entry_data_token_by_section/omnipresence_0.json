Some Issues involving Omnipresence and Historical Background\n\nAccording to classical theism, God is omnipresent, that is, present\neverywhere. But classical theism also holds that God is immaterial.\nHow can something that is not, or does not have, a body be located in\nspace? Early discussions of divine presence typically began by\ndistinguishing God\u2019s presence in space from that of material\nbodies.\n Augustine\n (354\u2013430) writes,\n\nAlthough in speaking of him we say that God is everywhere present, we\nmust resist carnal ideas and withdraw our mind from our bodily senses,\nand not imagine that God is distributed through all things by a sort\nof extension of size, as earth or water or air or light are\ndistributed (Letter 187, Ch. 2).\n\n\nElsewhere Augustine continues this theme and introduces a new element,\nnamely, the suggestion that divine presence might be understood by\nanalogy with the presence of the soul:\n\n[Some people] are not able to imagine any substance except what is\ncorporeal, whether those substances be grosser, like water and earth,\nor finer, like air and light, but still corporeal. None of these can\nbe wholly everywhere, since they are necessarily composed of\nnumberless parts, some here and some there; however large or however\nsmall the substance may be, it occupies an amount of space, and it\nfills that space without being entire in any part of it. Consequently,\nit is a characteristic of corporeal substances alone to be condensed\nand rarified, contracted and expanded, divided into small bits and\nenlarged into a great mass. The nature of the soul is very different\nfrom that of the body, and much more different is the nature of God\nwho is the Creator of both body and soul (Letter 137).\n\n\nAugustine adds two further points: First, God \u201cknows how to be\nwholly everywhere without being confined to any place\u201d\n(Letter 137). In contrast to material objects, which, having\nparts in various parts of the space they occupy, are not wholly\npresent at any of those regions, God is wholly present\nwherever he is. Second, God is not contained in or confined\nby any of the places at which he exists. Augustine is thus explicit\nthat God is not present in the way corporeal substances are present,\nbut his positive proposal for divine presence is less well developed.\nHe notes that God\u2019s light, strength, and wisdom reach everywhere\n(Letter 187, Ch. 7), and he holds that \u201cGod so\npermeates all things as to be not a quality of the world, but the very\ncreative substance of the world ruling the world without labor,\nsustaining it without effort.\u201d Rather than going on to explain\nthese ideas, however, this passage simply ends with what became a\nfamiliar formula:\n\nNevertheless, he [God] is not distributed through space by size so\nthat half of him should be in half the world and half in the other\nhalf of it. He is wholly present in all of it in such wise as to be\nwholly in heaven alone and wholly in the earth alone and wholly in\nheaven and earth together; not confined in any place, but wholly in\nhimself everywhere.\n\n\nAnselm\n (1033\u20131109) also distinguishes God\u2019s presence from the\nway in which material objects are contained in space, and he, too,\nappeals to the concept of being wholly present. In his\nMonologion Anselm discusses omnipresence in a series of\nchapters with paradoxical titles. In chapter 20 he states that\n\u201cthe Supreme Being exists in every place and at all\ntimes.\u201d But in the following chapter, he argues that God\n\u201cexists in no place and at no time.\u201d Finally, he attempts\nto reconcile these \u201ctwo conclusions\u2014so contradictory\naccording to their utterance, so necessary according to their\nproof\u201d, by distinguishing two senses of \u201cbeing wholly in a\nplace.\u201d In one sense those things are wholly in a place\n\u201cwhose magnitude place contains by circumscribing it, and\ncircumscribes by containing it.\u201d In this sense, an ordinary\nmaterial object is contained in a place. God, however, is not thus\ncontained in space, for it is \u201ca mark of shameless impudence to\nsay that place circumscribes the magnitude of Supreme Truth.\u201d\nInstead, God is in every place in the sense that he is present at\nevery place. According to Anselm, \u201cthe Supreme Being must be\npresent as a whole in every different place at once.\u201d Like\nAugustine, then, Anselm denies that God is contained in space. Also,\nlike Augustine, he seems to leave unexplained this second relation of\nbeing \u201cpresent as a whole\u201d in every place.\n\nIn his (1988) Edward Wierenga attempts to supply the missing details.\nHe notes that Anselm holds that souls could be wholly present in more\nthan one place, provided that they sensed in more than one place, and\nthat Anselm (in his Proslogion) adds that perception for God\nis a matter of having direct or immediate knowledge. Combining these\ntwo ideas, Anselm could say that God is present everywhere in virtue\nof having immediate knowledge of what is happening everywhere. Brian\nLeftow (1989) objects to the details of this interpretation and\nproposes instead that, for Anselm, God is everywhere in virtue of his\npower. We will explore the combination of knowledge and power below.\nIt should be noted, however, as Christopher Conn (2011) emphasizes,\nthat Anselm himself discusses time in conjunction with space; perhaps\nan adequate interpretation of Anselm would exploit this idea and\ndevelop an account, as Conn suggests, according to which God\n\u201ccontains\u201d all of space-time.\n\nThe two ideas of knowledge and power figure prominently in the account\nof omnipresence given by\n Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u20131274), which we will take up in the next section. Section\n3 will consider two 20th century proposals very much in the spirit of\nAquinas\u2019s. Some treatments of the problem of omnipresence seem\nto have the consequence that God is related to the world as though it\nis his body. That will be the subject of Section 4. In Section 5\nwe will consider several recent proposals that depart from the\ntraditional formula.\n",
