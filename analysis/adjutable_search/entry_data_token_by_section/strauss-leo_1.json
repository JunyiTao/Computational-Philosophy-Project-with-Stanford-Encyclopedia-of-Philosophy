    "main_text": "Controversies\n2. Controversies\n\nA number of controversies surround Strauss and his work. First, in\nrecent years, Strauss has been accused of being the intellectual\ngodfather of the neo-conservative political movement and thus of being\nthe intellectual force behind the Bush administration\u2019s plan to\ninvade of Iraq. Second, no aspect of Strauss\u2019s work is as hotly\ncontested as his claims about esotericism. Interpretations of\nStrauss\u2019s view of esotericism include: that Strauss advocates\nclandestine cabals with secrets imparted from teacher to disciple;\nthat Strauss\u2019s writings are themselves esoteric documents; that\nStrauss thinks that all thinkers write esoterically; that Strauss\nclaims to know a secret; that, Strauss promoted mass deception and\nperpetual war; and that, in one particularly crude rendering, Strauss\nused his esoteric methods to hide his fascist sympathies, if not his\nsecret Nazism. After exploring the broad themes and context of\nStrauss\u2019s work, this article will return to reconsider these\nvarying claims about Strauss.\n",
