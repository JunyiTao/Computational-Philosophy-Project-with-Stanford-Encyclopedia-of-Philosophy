    "main_text": "\n\nCertainty, or the attempt to obtain certainty, has played a central\nrole in the history of philosophy. Some philosophers have taken the\nkind of certainty characteristic of mathematical knowledge to be the\ngoal at which philosophy should aim. In the Republic,\nPlato says that geometry \u201cdraws the soul towards truth and produces\nphilosophic thought by directing upwards what we now wrongly direct\ndownwards\u201d (527b). Descartes also thought that a philosophical method\nthat proceeds in a mathematical way, enumerating and ordering\neverything exactly, \u201ccontains everything that gives certainty to the\nrules of mathematics\u201d (Discourse on the Method, PW 1, p.\n121). Other philosophers have adopted different models for how to best\nunderstand certainty. For example, Aristotle and Aquinas take\nscientific explanation to be essential to certainty (see Pasnau 2017,\npp. 5\u20137), while Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b thought that certainty\narose out of religious practice (see Albertini 2005). For many\nempiricists, certainty with respect to empirical matters is to be\nfound in basic beliefs that are grounded in some fundamental aspect of\nperceptual experience (see, e.g., Lewis 1952).\n\nLike knowledge, certainty is an epistemic property of beliefs. (In a\nderivative way, certainty is also an epistemic property of subjects:\nS is certain that p just in case S\u2019s\nbelief that p is certain.) Although some philosophers have\nthought that there is no difference between knowledge and certainty,\nit has become increasingly common to distinguish them. On this\nconception, then, certainty is either the highest form of knowledge or\nis the only epistemic property superior to knowledge. One of the\nprimary motivations for allowing kinds of knowledge less than\ncertainty is the widespread sense that skeptical arguments are\nsuccessful in showing that we rarely or never have beliefs that are\ncertain (see Unger 1975 for this kind of skeptical argument) but do\nnot succeed in showing that our beliefs are altogether without\nepistemic worth (see, for example, Lehrer 1974, Williams 1999, and\nFeldman 2003; see Fumerton 1995 for an argument that skepticism\nundermines every epistemic status a belief might have; and see Klein\n1981 for the argument that knowledge requires certainty, which we are\ncapable of having).\n\nAs with knowledge, it is difficult to provide an uncontentious\nanalysis of certainty. There are several reasons for this. One is that\nthere are different kinds of certainty, which are easy to conflate.\nAnother is that the full value of certainty is surprisingly hard to\ncapture. A third reason is that there are two dimensions to certainty:\na belief can be individually certain at a particular moment, or it can\nbe certain over some greater length of time in a system of\nbeliefs.\n",
