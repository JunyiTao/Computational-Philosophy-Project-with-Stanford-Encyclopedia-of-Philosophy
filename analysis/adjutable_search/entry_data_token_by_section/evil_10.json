Attempted Total Refutations\n\nThere are at least three main ways in which one might attempt to show\nthat the argument from evil does not succeed in establishing that\nevil is even prima facie evidence against the existence of\nGod, let alone that the existence of God is improbable relative to\nour total evidence. The first appeals to human epistemological\nlimitations; the second, to the claim that there is no best of all\npossible worlds; and the third, to the ontological argument.\n",
