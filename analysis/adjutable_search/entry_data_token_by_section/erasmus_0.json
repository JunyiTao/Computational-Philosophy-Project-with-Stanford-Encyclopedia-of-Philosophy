    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nErasmus was born in Rotterdam on 27 October 1467 (?) as the\nillegitimate son of a priest. He attended a school at Deventer which\nwas regarded as progressive and had capable teachers who introduced\nErasmus to \u201csomething of a higher standard of literature\u201d\n(CWE 4: 405). Orphaned in 1483, he came into the care of guardians who\nsent him to a school run by the Brethren of the Common Life in the\nspirit of the Devotio Moderna. Since Erasmus\u2019 inheritance was\nsmall, his guardians persuaded him to enter the monastery of the\nAugustinian Canons Regular at Steyn. He was ordained priest in\n1492.\n\nIn later years Erasmus alleged that he had been pressured into taking\nthe vows. His misgivings found expression in one of his first works,\nDe Contemptu Mundi (On disdaining the World, written in the\n1490s, published 1521). Ostensibly a praise of monastic life, it began\nby recommending seclusion and withdrawal from the world but ended in a\nlament about the decline of monasticism and a warning to postulants\nnot to take the vows rashly. Erasmus himself discovered that he was\nconstitutionally and psychologically unsuited to the monastic life. He\nwould have preferred to go to university. In 1495 he saw a chance to\nrealize this goal when Bishop Hendrik of Bergen sent him to the\nColl\u00e8ge de Montaigu in Paris and promised him financial\nsupport. It is uncertain how much, if any, theological training\nErasmus received during his brief stay at the college. In any case, he\ndid not find the Parisian brand of theology to his liking, declaring\nthat scholasticism \u201crepelled him\u201d (CWE 4: 408).When the\npromised financial support did not materialize, Erasmus left the\ncollege, then renowned for its strict discipline and harsh living\nconditions, and supported himself by tutoring well-to-do young men.\nThis experience produced a number of educational handbooks and aids,\namong them De Epistolis Conscribendis, a letter-writing\nmanual (1522); De Copia, a handbook of style (1502);\nColloquia, a collection of dialogues meant to teach correct\nLatin (1518), and the Adagia , an anthology of proverbs to be\nused as rhetorical tools to embellish style (1500). All of these books\nsaw multiple editions, some of them expanded and given a larger\npurpose. Thus some of the proverbs provided starting points for\nessays, and many of the colloquies likewise became opinion pieces on\nissues of the day.\n\nIn 1499 Erasmus accompanied one of his pupils, William Blount, Lord\nMountjoy, to England. The visit led to important connections. He made\nlife-long friends, among them the humanists William Grocyn and Thomas\nLinacre, who inspired him to take up the study of Greek, and John\nColet who shared his scorn for scholastic theology and drew him toward\nbiblical studies. He was on close terms also with Thomas More, later\nLord Chancellor of England, with whom he collaborated on translations\nof Lucian, and he found a patron in William Warham, archbishop of\nCanterbury, who granted him an ecclesiastical benefice in Aldington,\nKent. His illegitimate birth disqualified Erasmus from taking up\nbenefices, but he received a papal dispensation through the\nintervention of the nuncio Andrea Ammonio, another of his English\nconnections. Eventually he drew a steady income from pensions and\nbenefices. A stipend, which he received as councilor to Charles V, was\npaid only irregularly, however.\n\nOver the next two decades Erasmus traveled extensively. He returned to\nFrance for a time, made two more journeys to England, and traveled to\nItaly where he obtained a doctorate in theology at the University of\nTurin. In 1517 he finally settled in Leuven. By that time he had made\na name for himself. He had published a number of bestsellers: the\nwitty satire Encomium Moriae  (The Praise of Folly, 1511);\nthe Adagia, which he enriched and expanded to more than 4000\nproverbs; and the devotional Enchiridion Militis Christiani\n(Handbook of the Christian Soldier, 1503). In 1516, he published his\nmagnum opus, an edition of the Greek New Testament, the first\nto reach the market. It anticipated the Complutensian\nPolyglot, which was already in print but still awaiting the papal\nimprimatur. Thus Erasmus found success in four different genres:\nliterature, education, religion, and theology. In a catalogue he\npublished in 1523, Erasmus arranged his writings under nine headings:\nworks furthering language arts, that is, literary and educational\nwritings; his collection of adages; his correspondence; works\nfurthering moral education (he noted that their content overlapped\nwith works in the first category); works promoting piety; the\nannotated edition of the New Testament; paraphrases on the New\nTestament; polemics; and editions and translations of patristic\nworks.\n\nWhile Erasmus was revered among humanists, his biblical scholarship\nsoon came under attack from theologians. They refused to acknowledge\nhim as a colleague and derided his doctorate, which had been granted\nper saltum, that is, without fulfilling the residence\nrequirements or passing the usual examinations. In their eyes, Erasmus\nwas merely a \u201ctheologizing humanist\u201d, as the prominent\nParis theologian No\u00ebl Beda put it (Preface to\nAnnotations 1526). Erasmus was not the first humanist to\ntreat the New Testament in a text-critical fashion and to compare the\nLatin Vulgate with the Greek original, although none of his\npredecessors had dared to use their findings to publish an amended\nedition of the text. Erasmus had discovered a manuscript of Lorenzo\nValla\u2019s annotations on the New Testament and originally planned\nto publish notes of a similar nature, that is, observations of errors,\ndiscrepancies, and mistranslations. He expanded the scope of his\nproject on the urging of his publisher, Johann Froben, and rather\nhastily assembled a text based on the biblical manuscripts he had been\nable to consult. In the resulting edition, the Greek text was faced by\na lightly amended Vulgate, with Erasmus\u2019 editorial changes\nexplained in annotations following the text. The reception of the\nedition varied. Humanists generally praised it as an exceptional\nachievement; a considerable number of theologians disapproved of it\nand not only impugned Erasmus\u2019 scholarship but also questioned\nhis orthodoxy. Their attacks must be seen in the context of\nLuther\u2019s coincidental rise to prominence and the resulting\nreligious debate which cast a long shadow over state and church and\nover society at large. Erasmus\u2019 move from Leuven to Basel in\n1521 was partly motivated by a desire to escape the hostile climate at\nthe University of Leuven, but his opponents were not limited to the\nLow Countries. He had critics in Italy and was formally investigated\nby ecclesiastical authorities in Spain and in France. In 1531the\nprestigious faculty of theology at the University of Paris publicly\ncensured and condemned numerous passages in his works as unorthodox.\nErasmus responded to his critics with lengthy polemics, which fill two\nfolio volumes in the Leiden Opera Omnia. He also published\nfour revised editions of his New Testament (1519, 1522, 1527, 1531)\nwith corrections and expanded notes.\n\nCritics of Erasmus\u2019 New Testament edition accused him of\nintroducing changes to a sacred text and thus challenging the\nprinciple of inspiration. Erasmus denied these charges. On the\ncontrary, he said, his edition restored the original text and\ncorrected the errors introduced by translators and scribes.\nTheologians questioned Erasmus\u2019 qualifications to tackle Holy\nWrit, but he insisted that editing and textual criticism did not\nrequire a degree in theology. They were tasks proper to philologists.\nThe prefaces he added to successive editions of the New Testament\nattempted to clarify his aims and methods. He somewhat ingenuously\nclaimed that he was only doing philological work and ignored\nthe fact that a change in words frequently also shifted the meaning.\nIndeed, some of his critics acknowledged the usefulness of his work,\nbut took issue with specific editorial choices. Thus they protested\nagainst Erasmus replacing the traditional poenitentiam agite\n(do penance) at Matt. 3:2 with poeniteat vos (repent), in\nwhich they saw a Lutheran slant. There was an uproar also about his\nomission of the so-called Comma Johanneum at I John 5:7, one of the\nproofs for the divine trinity, for which Erasmus had found no evidence\nin the Greek manuscripts or support in the Fathers. The biblical\ncommentaries of the Church Fathers and their quotations from the bible\nwere important sources for Erasmus in establishing the text of the New\nTestament. He read widely and published numerous editions and\ntranslations of patristic writings, among them Jerome, Augustine,\nChrysostom, and Origen, and in many cases established the first\nreliable critical text of their works (see B\u00e9n\u00e9 1969 and\nGodin 1982).\n\nIn the last two decades of his life, Erasmus wrote numerous apologiae,\nrefuting critics of his New Testament edition and battling the\naccusation that he had inspired the Reformation and was a supporter of\nLuther. It was difficult, however, to change an opinion that was so\nentrenched that it had become proverbial and issued in the popular\nsaying \u201cErasmus laid the egg, and Luther hatched it\u201d.\nErasmus\u2019 critics demanded proof of his orthodoxy in the form of\na direct attack on Luther. For some years Erasmus held out and refused\nexplicitly to endorse any religious party. Maintaining scholarly\ndetachment was, however, impossible in the militant climate of the\nConfessional Age. In 1524 Erasmus reluctantly published De Libero\nArbitrio Diatribe (Discussion of Free Will). A politely worded\ndisquisition addressed to Luther, it showed their fundamental\ndisagreement on a crucial theological question. The ensuing polemic\nfailed to convince Erasmus\u2019 critics of the orthodoxy of his\nviews. It was undeniable that Erasmus had been in sympathy with the\nreformers for a time, although he was not prepared to challenge the\nauthority of the church and never promoted schism. Erasmus\u2019\ncriticism concerned abuses rather than doctrine, and although his\nannotations on the New Testament show that he disagreed with certain\ntraditional interpretations, he always emphasized his willingness to\ndefer to the judgment of the Church.\n\nIn 1529 when the city of Basel, where he resided at the time, turned\nProtestant, he voted with his feet and moved to Catholic Freiburg.\nQuestions about Erasmus\u2019 orthodoxy persisted, however, even\nafter his death in 1536. In the wake of the Council of Trent, which\ndefined articles of faith more rigidly, Erasmus\u2019 works were\nplaced on the Index of Prohibited Books.\n",
