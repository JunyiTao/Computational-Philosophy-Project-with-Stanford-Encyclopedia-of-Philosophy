    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea of a private language was made famous in philosophy by Ludwig\nWittgenstein, who in \u00a7243 of his book Philosophical\nInvestigations explained it thus: \u201cThe words of this\nlanguage are to refer to what only the speaker can know \u2014 to his\nimmediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the\nlanguage.\u201d This is not intended to cover (easily imaginable)\ncases of recording one\u2019s experiences in a personal code, for such a\ncode, however obscure in fact, could in principle be deciphered. What\nWittgenstein had in mind is a language conceived as\nnecessarily comprehensible only to its single originator\nbecause the things which define its vocabulary are necessarily\ninaccessible to others. \n\nImmediately after introducing the idea, Wittgenstein goes on to argue\nthat there cannot be such a language. The importance of drawing\nphilosophers\u2019 attention to a largely unheard-of notion and then\narguing that it is unrealizable lies in the fact that an unformulated\nreliance on the possibility of a private language is arguably\nessential to mainstream epistemology, philosophy of mind and\nmetaphysics from Descartes to versions of the representational theory\nof mind which became prominent in late twentieth century cognitive\nscience.\n",
