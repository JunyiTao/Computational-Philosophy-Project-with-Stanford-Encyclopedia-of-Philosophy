    "main_text": "\n\nGiovanni Battista Vico (1668\u20131744) spent most of his\nprofessional life as Professor of Rhetoric at the University of\nNaples. He was trained in jurisprudence, but read widely in Classics,\nphilology, and philosophy, all of which informed his highly original\nviews on history, historiography, and culture. His thought is most\nfully expressed in his mature work, the Scienza Nuova or\nThe New Science. In his own time, Vico was relatively\nunknown, but from the nineteenth century onwards his views found a\nwider audience and today his influence is widespread in the humanities\nand social sciences. \n",
