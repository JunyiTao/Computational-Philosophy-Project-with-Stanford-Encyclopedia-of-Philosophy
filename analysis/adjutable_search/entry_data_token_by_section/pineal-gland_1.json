    "main_text": "Pre-Cartesian Views on the Pineal Gland || Antiquity\n1.1 Antiquity\nThe first description of the pineal gland and the first speculations about its functions are to be found in the voluminous writings of Galen (ca. 130-ca. 210 CE), the Greek medical doctor and philosopher who spent the greatest part of his life in Rome and whose system dominated medical thinking until the seventeenth century.\nGalen discussed the pineal gland in the eighth book of his anatomical work On the usefulness of the parts of the body. He explained that it owes its name (Greek: k\u00f4narion, Latin: glandula pinealis) to its resemblance in shape and size to the nuts found in the cones of the stone pine (Greek: k\u00f4nos, Latin: pinus pinea). He called it a gland because of its appearance and said that it has the same function as all other glands of the body, namely to serve as a support for blood vessels.\nIn order to understand the rest of Galen\u2019s exposition, the following two points should be kept in mind. First, his terminology was different from ours. He regarded the lateral ventricles of the brain as one paired ventricle and called it the anterior ventricle. He accordingly called the third ventricle the middle ventricle, and the fourth the posterior one. Second, he thought that these ventricles were filled with \u201cpsychic pneuma,\u201d a fine, volatile, airy or vaporous substance which he described as \u201cthe first instrument of the soul.\u201d (See Rocca 2003 for a detailed description of Galen\u2019s views about the anatomy and physiology of the brain.)\nGalen went to great lengths to refute a view that was apparently circulating in his time (but whose originators or protagonists he did not mention) according to which the pineal gland regulates the flow of psychic pneuma in the canal between the middle and posterior ventricles of the brain, just as the pylorus regulates the passage of food from the esophagus to the stomach. Galen rejected this view because, first, the pineal gland is attached to the outside of the brain and, second, it cannot move on its own. He argued that the \u201cworm-like appendage\u201d [epiphysis or apophysis] of the cerebellum (nowadays known as the vermis superior cerebelli) is much better qualified to play this role (K\u00fchn 1822, pp. 674\u2013683; May 1968, vol. 1, pp. 418\u2013423).\n",
