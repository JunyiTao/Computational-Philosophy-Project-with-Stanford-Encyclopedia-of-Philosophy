    "main_text": "The Scope of Medieval Political Philosophy\n1. The Scope of Medieval Political Philosophy\n\n\u201cMedieval\u201d refers primarily to Europe (the term being\napplied to other cultures by analogy). Medieval philosophy includes\nthe \u201cpre-scholastic\u201d, \u201cscholastic\u201d and\n\u201clate scholastic\u201d periods.\n\n\u201cScholasticism\u201d refers to the intellectual culture\ncharacteristic of the medieval schools. In the twelfth century\nschooling became a flourishing industry in Paris, Bologna and many\nother places. By the early thirteenth century the masters of the\nschools in some places had formed corporations generally called\n universities.[3]\n The working language of the schools was Latin, and teachers and\nstudents were clergy. The universities got a great boost from the\ntranslation into Latin of the works of\n Aristotle,\n commentaries on Aristotle and related works in Greek or Arabic. These\ntranslations were made and copied because there was a public whose\ninterest in Aristotle had been formed by the schools of the twelfth\ncentury, in which some works of Aristotle that had been translated\nearlier (part of the logica vetus, the \u201cold\nlogic\u201d) were already objects of close study. In the\nuniversities, philosophy was studied in the Arts faculties, but\nphilosophy was developed and employed also in the faculties of\ntheology. The study of law was important in medieval universities and\nideas derived from the law were influential in political thinking.\nWriters on political philosophy used a number of the literary genres\ncharacteristic of scholasticism, such as the commentary, the disputed\nquestion, the dialogue, and the treatise (see the entry on\n literary forms of medieval philosophy).\n\n\u201cLate scholasticism\u201d conventionally begins with the\nfourteenth century and overlaps with the early modern period. The\npeople we think of as the early modern philosophers were trained in\nthe universities (or, in Descartes\u2019 case, in a Jesuit school),\nbut they wrote mostly outside the universities and mostly in\nvernacular languages. Philosophy of the scholastic kind continued,\ntaught and written in Latin, throughout the seventeenth century in the\nuniversities, especially in Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, in the\nJesuit schools in many countries, and in some Protestant schools.\n\nThe \u201cpre-scholastic\u201d medieval period includes\n Abelard\n (1079\u20131142), and\n Anselm\n (1033\u20131109) and the writers of the Carolingian age, but it is\ndifficult to say how far back this period should be traced. Perhaps it\nshould include\n Boethius\n (c. 475/7\u2013526) and Augustine, who were deeply influential in\nEurope from their own time until the end of the middle ages (and\nbeyond), though they might also be regarded as belonging to late\nAntiquity. Boethius had written or translated from Greek into Latin\nsome of the logical works studied in the twelfth century schools;\nAugustine was the dominant influence in medieval theology. Boethius\nwrote nothing directly relevant to political philosophy, but Augustine\ncertainly did, so for the purposes of this article\n\u201cmedieval\u201d begins with Augustine.\n\nBy medieval political philosophy we understand the medieval\nwritings on politics that are recognizably akin to the modern writings\nwe class as political philosophy. Their authors were usually academics\nwho wrote with university-educated readers in mind; they drew upon\nideas explored in the schools and they wrote in an academic way. Some\nwrote commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Politics and academic\n\u201cdisputed questions\u201d related to topics of political\nphilosophy. However, political philosophy was not part of the\nuniversity core curriculum (Miethke 2000b). The authors of political\nwritings generally did not write these works in the course of their\nteaching duties. Generally they wrote in response to some political\nevent. Some wrote for the edification of a king or other ruler, others\nsought to influence conflicts between the Church and secular rulers,\nothers were concerned with conflicts within the Church about the\nconstitution of the Church and the powers of popes and councils. Often\nthey were committed to one or other side in these conflicts\u2014many\nclerics supported secular rulers in their conflicts with the\nChurch.\n\nThis article describes the most important sources of medieval\npolitical ideas and the work of some of the most interesting writers.\nThe main sources were the Bible, the Fathers of the Church, the\ntextbooks of canon and civil law, and the works of Aristotle,\nespecially the Politics. Sections 2 and 3 will outline what\nmedieval political thought took from the Bible and the Fathers.\nSections 4 and 5 will sketch the ideas of political thinkers of the\npre-scholastic period, including Augustine. Sections 6 and 7 will\nsketch the sources that became influential during the twelfth and\nthirteenth centuries, namely Aristotle and the law textbooks. Section\n8 will outline one of the main issues of medieval political thought\nfrom the thirteenth century onwards, namely the political power of the\npope. Section 9 will outline the work of a major thirteenth century\nwriter, Thomas Aquinas. Sections 10\u201314 will be concerned with\nwriters on political philosophy during the 14th and\n15th centuries, including Marsilius of Padua and William of\nOckham.\n",
