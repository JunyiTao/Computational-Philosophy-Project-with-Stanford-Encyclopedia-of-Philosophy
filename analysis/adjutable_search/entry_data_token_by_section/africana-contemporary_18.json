It reflects the imperatives of a philosophy born of\nstruggle, it draws out and builds on the core idea of problematicity,\nand it reflects the ongoing effort, just discussed, to find ever more\nadequate conceptual tools for engaging deep problems. This\ntheme\u2014call it a focus on Black life and social\ndeath\u2014unites several different currents of thought and activism,\nall radically distinct but all interested in the ethical and\nexistential stakes of Black life in a world that remains anti-Black\nnot just at the level of individual prejudices but also at the level\nof sociopolitical, epistemic, axiological, and ontological\nstructures.\n\nOne approach to this work eventuates in the Afro-pessimism of Frank\nWilderson, Saidiya Hartman, and others, or in the debates about the\nview between its advocates and those who decline to claim it, like\nMoten. This is a notoriously difficult approach to pin down, in small\npart because a very different view, much more prominent in\ninternational relations than in political theory and philosophy, goes\nby the same\n name.[14]\n With respect to the philosophical view that is our concern here,\nJared Sexton, quoting Bryan Wagner, describes it as \u201camong other\nthings, an attempt to formulate an account of [Black] suffering\n\u2026 \u2018without recourse to the consolation of\ntranscendence\u2019\u201d (Wagner 2009, 2, as quoted in Sexton 2016,\npar. 8). Elsewhere in this remarkable essay, aimed at clearing away\nthe misconceptions and misguided criticisms that swirl around the\nview, Sexton explains:\n\n\nAfro-pessimism is not an intervention so much as it is a reading or\nmeta-commentary\u2026 . It is a reading of what is gained and lost\nin the attempt\u2014the impulse\u2014to \u2026 delimit the\n\u201cbad news\u201d of black life, to fix its precise scope and\nscale, to find an edge beyond or before which true living unfolds.\n(Sexton 2016, par. 16)\n\n\nThe content of and motivation for this reading involves \u201cboth an\nepistemological and an ethical project\u201d (Sexton 2016, par. 15).\nThe ethical project involves resisting a lazy, bad faith optimism that\nbases struggle and activism on hope rather than on a clear-eyed\nconfrontation with the challenges of Black life in an anti-Black\nworld. The epistemological project involves finding the tools for\nachieving this clear-eyed confrontation. In the hands of figures like\nHartman and Christina Sharpe, this means enacting certain vital\nconceptual reorientations, like insisting on the afterlife of the\ntransatlantic slave trade in contemporary modes of social\norganization.\n\nA second way of engaging black life and social death philosophically\ncrystallizes in the various organizational forms and\nanti-organizational tendencies that constitute the Black Lives Matter\nmovement. This is of course not an academic enterprise, but it grows\nfrom many of the same roots, intellectually and ethically, as much of\nthe work under consideration here. The driving forces behind the\nmovement\u2014people like Alicia Garza, Patrice Cullors-Khan, and\nOpal Tometi, the authors of the phrase-cum-social media archiving tool\nthat gives the movement its name\u2014take up expressly philosophical\nquestions about, for example, the requirements of justice, the role of\nthe state (and the legitimacy of state violence), the workings of\npower, and the meaning of the human. What\u2019s more, they often do\nso in ways informed by figures like Fanon, Audre Lorde, Steve Biko,\nand Cedric Robinson. This is philosophy in action: it is \u201cabout\nfinding, articulating, and promoting answers to philosophical\nquestions\u201d as well as about \u201cmodeling a kind of\nphilosophical responsiveness to the conditions of human\nstriving\u201d\u2014call this a robustly engaged version of the art\nof living well (Taylor 2019,\n 297).[15]\n\nA third approach to the questions of black life and social death\nactually runs through both of the approaches mentioned so far. The\nstudy of Black aesthetics and of African-derived cultural practices\nhave become scholarly growth areas thanks in part\u2014but only in\npart\u2014to the central role that aesthetic practices play in the\nwork of antiracist resistance. I say \u201conly in part\u201d\nbecause some of the most interesting work in this area prominently\nresists the temptation to reduce aesthesis to anti-racism. Life in\ncommunities of African-descended persons and others racialized as\nBlack, like life everywhere, has its irremediably aesthetic dimensions\nand resources. These resources are sometimes invested in defensive\nefforts, warding off assaults on Black or African humanity. But they\nare much more often invested in celebrations of life, reflections on\ncommunity, parables of love, provocations for the mind and senses, and\nso on. In fact, a plausible reading of the transnational,\ntranshistorical tradition of Black aesthetics suggests that this work\nroutinely circles around the tension between responsibly facing\nlife\u2019s problems and celebrating and enjoying life\u2019s\npossibilities (Taylor 2016). This tension motivates Albert\nMurray\u2019s charges against Toni Morrison (and others), it inspires\nWest\u2019s critique of Du Bois, and it runs through, without quite\ndefining, Moten\u2019s refusal of Afro-pessimism.\n\nThe contemporary concern with aesthetics in and near Africana thought\nextends a long tradition. Frederick Douglass, for example,\ncomplemented his achievements as a writer and orator with vigorous\nefforts to construct his public image through photography, thereby\nmaking a germinal contribution to modern transatlantic visual culture\n(Gates 2016). The U.S. \u201cNew Negro\u201d movement (usually\nassociated with the Harlem Renaissance), the Negritude movement, and\nthe various Black arts movements around the world were all animated by\nphilosophical commitments, and in the first two cases prominently\nfeatured philosophers (Alain Locke and Leopold Senghor, to start).\nMoving closer to the present, the companion volumes that marked\nAfricana philosophy\u2019s establishment feature contributions on art\nand aesthetics by Nzegwu (2004) and others. Contemporary thinkers\nfollow in their footsteps with special issues on race and aesthetics,\nsymposia on Black aesthetics, and studies of the philosophical import\nof memorials and monuments in racialized\n spaces.[16]\n",
