    "main_text": "Causation and Defeasible Reasoning || Causally Grounded Independence Relations\n6.2 Causally Grounded Independence Relations\n\nHans Reichenbach, in his analysis of the interaction of causality and\nprobability (Reichenbach 1956), observed that the immediate causes of\nan event probabilistically screen off from that event any\nother event that is not causally posterior to it. This means that,\ngiven the immediate causal antecedents of an event, the occurrence of\nthat event is rendered probabilistically independent of any\ninformation about non-posterior events. When this insight is applied\nto the nonmonotonic logic of extreme probabilities, we can use causal\ninformation to identify which defaults function independently of\nothers: that is, we can decide when the fact that one default\nconditional has an exception is irrelevant to the question of whether\na second conditional is also violated (see Koons 2000, 320\u2013323).\nIn effect, we have a selective version of Independence of Defaults\nthat is grounded in causal information, enabling us to dissolve the\nDrowning Problem.\n\nFor example, in the case of Pearl\u2019s sprinkler, since rain is\ncausally prior to the sidewalk\u2019s being wet, the causal structure\nof the situation does not ensure that the rain is probabilistically\nindependent of whether the sprinkler is on, given the fact that the\nsidewalk is wet. That is, we have no grounds for thinking that the\nprobability of rain, conditional on the sidewalk\u2019s being wet, is\nidentical to the probability of rain, conditional on the\nsidewalk\u2019s being wet and the sprinkler\u2019s being on\n(presumably, the former is higher than the latter). This failure of\nindependence prevents us from using the (Wet \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nRain) default, in the presence of the additional fact that\nthe sprinkler is on. \n\nIn the case of the Yale shooting problem, the state of the gun\u2019s\nbeing loaded in the aftermath of waiting,\nLoaded\\((s_1)\\), has at its only causal\nantecedent the fact that the gun is loaded in \\(s_0\\).\nThe fact of Loaded\\((s_0)\\) screens off the\nfact that the victim is alive in \\(s_0\\) from the\nconclusion Loaded\\((s_1)\\). Similarly, the\nfact that the victim is alive in \\(s_0\\) screens off\nthe fact that the gun is loaded in \\(s_0\\) from the\nconclusion that the victim is still alive in \\(s_1\\).\nIn contrast, the fact that the victim is alive at\n\\(s_1\\) does not screen off the fact that the\ngun is loaded at \\(s_1\\) from the conclusion that the\nvictim is still alive at \\(s_2\\). Thus, we can assign\nhigher priority to the law of inertia with respect to both\nLoad and Alive at \\(s_0\\), and we can\nconclude that the victim is alive and the gun is loaded at\n\\(s_1\\). The causal law for shooting then gives us the\ndesired conclusion, namely, that the victim is dead at\n\\(s_2\\).\n",
