    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Nation-state in global context\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn presenting the claims that the pro-nationalists defend, we have\nproceeded from the more radical towards more liberal nationalist\nalternatives. In examining the arguments for these claims, we have\npresented metaphysically demanding communitarian arguments resting\nupon deep communitarian assumptions about culture, such as the premise\nthat the ethno-cultural nation is the most important community for all\nindividuals. This is an interesting and respectable claim, but its\nplausibility has not been established. The moral debate about\nnationalism has resulted in various weakenings of culture-based\narguments, typically proposed by liberal nationalists, which render\nthe arguments less ambitious but much more plausible. Having abandoned\nthe old nationalist ideal of a state owned by a single dominant\nethno-cultural group, liberal nationalists have become receptive to\nthe idea that identification with a plurality of cultures and\ncommunities is important for a person\u2019s social identity. They\nhave equally become sensitive to trans-national issues and more\nwilling to embrace a partly cosmopolitan perspective. Liberal\nnationalism has also brought to the fore more modest, less\nphilosophically or metaphysically charged arguments grounded in\nconcerns about justice. These stress the practical importance of\nethno-cultural membership, ethno-cultural groups\u2019 rights to have\ninjustices redressed, democratic rights of political association, and\nthe role that ethno-cultural ties and associations can play in\npromoting just social arrangements.\n\nThe events in the current decade, the refugee crisis and the rise of\nright-wing populism, have dramatically changed the relevant practical\nand theoretical playground. The traditional nationalism is still\nrelevant, but populist nationalism attracts much more attention: new\ntheories are being produced and debated, coming to occupy the center\nstage. On the other hand, migration crisis has replaced the typical\ncosmopolitan issue of solidarity-with-distant-strangers with burning\nissues of helping refugees present at our doors. Of course, the causes\nof the crisis are still the same ones that cosmopolitans have been\nworrying about much earlier: wars and dramatically unequal global\ndistribution of goods, and of threats, like illnesses and climate\ndisasters. The task of the theory is now to connect these deeper\nissues with the new problems occupying the center-stage of the new\nplayground; it is a challenge now formulated in somewhat different\nvocabulary and within different political conceptual frameworks than\nbefore.\n",
