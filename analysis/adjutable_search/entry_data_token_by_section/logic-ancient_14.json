    "main_text": "The Stoics || Logical Achievements Besides Propositional Logic\n5.1 Logical Achievements Besides Propositional Logic\n\n\nThe subject matter of Stoic logic is the so-called sayables\n(lekta): they are the underlying meanings in everything we\nsay and think, but\u2014like Frege\u2019s \u2018senses\u2019\u2014also subsist \nindependently of us. They are distinguished from spoken and written\nlinguistic expressions: what we utter are those expressions,\nbut what we say are the sayables (D. L. 7.57). There are\ncomplete and deficient sayables. Deficient sayables, if said, make the\nhearer feel prompted to ask for a completion; e.g. when someone says\n\u2018writes\u2019 we enquire \u2018who?\u2019. Complete sayables,\nif said, do not make the hearer ask for a completion (D. L.7.63). They\ninclude assertibles (the Stoic equivalent of propositions),\nimperativals, interrogatives, inquiries, exclamatives, hypotheses or\nsuppositions, stipulations, oaths, curses and more. The accounts of\nthe different complete sayables all had the general form \u2018a\nso-and-so sayable is one in saying which we perform an act of\nsuch-and-such\u2019. For instance: \u2018an imperatival sayable is\none in saying which we issue a command\u2019, \u2018an interrogative\nsayable is one in saying which we ask a question\u2019, \u2018a\ndeclaratory sayable (i.e. an assertible) is one in saying which we\nmake an assertion\u2019. Thus, according to the Stoics, each time we\nsay a complete sayable, we perform three different acts: we utter a\nlinguistic expression; we say the sayable; and we perform a\nspeech-act. Chrysippus was aware of the use-mention distinction\n(D. L. 7.187). He seems to have held that every denoting expression is\nambiguous in that it denotes both its denotation and itself (Galen,\nOn ling. soph. 4; Aulus Gellius 11.12.1).  Thus the\nexpression \u2018a wagon\u2019 would denote both a wagon and the\nexpression \u2018a\n wagon\u2019.[2]\n\n\nAssertibles (axi\u00f4mata) differ from all other complete\nsayables in their having a truth-value: at any one time they are\neither true or false. Truth is temporal and assertibles may change\ntheir truth-value. The Stoic principle of bivalence is hence\ntemporalized, too. Truth is introduced by example: the assertible\n\u2018it is day\u2019 is true when it is day, and at all\nother times false (D. L. 7.65). This suggests some kind of deflationist\nview of truth, as does the fact that the Stoics identify true\nassertibles with facts, but define false assertibles simply as the\ncontradictories of true ones (S. E. M 8.85).\n\n\nAssertibles are simple or non-simple. A simple predicative\nassertible like \u2018Dion is walking\u2019 is generated from the\npredicate \u2018is walking\u2019, which is a deficient assertible\nsince it elicits the question \u2018who?\u2019, together with a\nnominative case (Dion\u2019s individual quality or the correlated sayable),\nwhich the assertible presents as falling under the predicate\n(D. L. 7.63 and 70). There is thus no interchangeability of predicate\nand subject terms as in Aristotle; rather, predicates\u2014but not\nthe things that fall under them\u2014are defined as deficient, and\nthus resemble propositional functions. It seems that whereas some\nStoics took the\u2014Fregean\u2014approach that singular terms had\ncorrelated sayables, others anticipated the notion of direct\nreference. Concerning indexicals, the Stoics took a simple\ndefinite assertible like \u2018this one is walking\u2019 to\nbe true when the person pointed at by the speaker is walking (S. E.\nM 100). When the thing pointed at ceases to be, so does the\nassertible, though the sentence used to express it remains\n(Alex. Aphr. An. Pr. 177\u20138). A simple\nindefinite assertible like \u2018someone is walking\u2019\nis said to be true when a corresponding definite assertible is true\n(S. E. M 98). Aristotelian universal affirmatives\n(\u2018Every A is B\u2019) were to be rephrased as\nconditionals: \u2018If something is A, it is\nB\u2019 (S. E. M 9.8\u201311). Negations of simple\nassertibles are themselves simple assertibles. The Stoic negation of\n\u2018Dion is walking\u2019 is \u2018(It is) not (the case that)\nDion is walking\u2019, and not \u2018Dion is not walking\u2019. The\nlatter is analyzed in a Russellian manner as \u2018Both Dion exists\nand not: Dion is walking\u2019 (Alex. Aphr. An. Pr.\n402). There are present tense, past tense and future tense\nassertibles.  The\u2014temporalized\u2014principle of bivalence\nholds for them all. The past tense assertible \u2018Dion\nwalked\u2019 is true when there is at least one past time at which\n\u2018Dion is walking\u2019 was true.\n",
