    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Psychology (Empirical and Rational)\n5.3 Psychology (Empirical and Rational)\n\nWhile the soul, as a simple substance, is understood to be a part of\nthe world, and so is implicated in the treatment of cosmology, this\ndoes not exhaust what can be known of it, a fact that leads Wolff to\ntreat it as a separate topic of metaphysics. Indeed, Wolff\u2019s\npsychology constitutes one of his signal and most historically\ninfluential innovations. Most generally, insofar as Wolff seeks to\noffer a scientific account of the human soul specifically,\nand indeed with a focus on its cognitive and conative functions, his\npsychology represents a significant, and distinctly modern, departure\nfrom both the treatment of the soul in the context of a generic\nscience of living things, still prevalent among Aristotelian natural\nphilosophers in seventeenth century Germany, and from the metaphysical\ntreatment of the soul in the context of a pneumatology, or doctrine of\nfinite and infinite spirit (Stiening 2003, Vidal 2011). More\nnarrowly, Wolff\u2019s principal, and best-known innovation in\npsychology consists in his clear separation between two distinct\ninvestigations of the soul, the first based on the observation of\none\u2019s own mind, identified as empirical psychology, and\nthe second which seeks to use reasoning to uncover truths about the\nsoul that are not readily disclosed by experience, identified as\nrational psychology.\n\nWolff\u2019s distinction between empirical and rational psychology\nproved to be enormously consequential, but no less important (if less\nwell attended to) is the fact that these disciplines remain\nintrinsically connected. For Wolff, the observations catalogued in the\ncourse of empirical psychology serve as principles for the inferences\nof rational psychology, and the resulting findings on the part of\nrational psychology serve to guide our empirical observation in search\nof confirmation. Thus, Wolff writes, that which everyone can\nexperience of themselves will serve \u201cas a principle for deriving\nsomething else that not everyone can immediately see for\nthemselves\u201d (GM: \u00a7191), and that which is known of the soul\nfrom experience \u201cis the touchstone [Probier-Stein] of\nthat which is taught [in rational psychology] of its nature and\nessence\u201d (GM: \u00a7727). Rather than constituting distinct\ndisciplines, empirical and rational psychology amount to complementary\nparts of a single science, working together in the same way\nin which observation and theory co-operate in astronomy (EP: \u00a75).\nConsequently, Wolff\u2019s rational psychology is not to be\nidentified as a narrowly rationalistic psychology, insofar as\nthe latter is taken to intend a science of the soul that proceeds\ncompletely independently of experience. Nor is this\ninterdependence of the two parts of psychology an aberration as Wolff\ntakes their union as exemplifying his ideal for science of a\nconnubium rationis et experientiae (EP: \u00a7497; cf., Dyck\n2014, Rumore 2018).\n\nTurning first to empirical psychology, Wolff\u2019s treatment can be\ndivided into four parts: (1) the initial consideration of the human\nsoul in an attempt to arrive at an initial definition; the\nconsideration of the soul\u2019s (2) cognitive faculty and (3)\nappetitive faculty; and (4) a consideration of what can be known of\nthe soul\u2019s relation to the body through experience. In the first\npart, Wolff begins, in Cartesian fashion, by first considering the\ngrounds for our certainty in the existence of the soul (EP:\n\u00a711\u201314). Wolff begins by asserting that we are conscious of\nourselves and other things, which he takes to be confirmed by our own\nindubitable experience (for to doubt it would presuppose such\nconsciousness), and inasmuch as anything that is so conscious must\nexist, a claim Wolff identifies as an identical proposition or axiom\n(cf. GL: c. 3, \u00a713), it follows that we can be certain that we\nexist. Wolff conveniently reconstructs this as a syllogism:\n\n\nWhatever being is conscious of its self and of other things\noutside of it, exists.\nWe are actually conscious of ourselves and of things outside of\nus.\nTherefore, we exist. (EP: \u00a716)\n\n\n\nIn addition to assuring ourselves of the indubitability of the\nknowledge of our own existence (cf. Euler 2003), this initial\nconsideration supplies a touchstone for what will count as\ndemonstratively certain, but also provides the elements for a nominal\ndefinition of the soul. Thus, the soul is identified just as\n\u201cthat being in us which is conscious of itself and other things\noutside of it\u201d (EP: \u00a720) which, as an existing thing, can\nserve as the object of empirical psychology.\n\nThe next task for empirical psychology consists in cataloguing the\nvarious capacities that the soul has, which Wolff brings under two\ngeneral headings: the cognitive faculty (facultas\ncognoscendi) and the appetitive faculty (facultas\nappetendi). Relevant to the distinction between (sub-)faculties\nin both cases is the distinction, borrowed from Leibniz, between\nobscure and clear perception (where the latter but not the former\nsuffices for recognition of the perceived thing), and (clear but)\nconfused and (clear and) distinct perception (where the latter but not\nthe former involves the ability to explicate what serves to\ndistinguish the perceived thing from others). Accordingly, both the\ncognitive and appetitive faculty are distinguished into lower and\nhigher parts, where the lower includes capacities relating to ideas\nand notions that are obscure or clear but confused, and the higher\nthose relating to ideas and notions that are distinct (EP:\n\u00a7\u00a754\u20135, 584). (It bears noting that Wolff also\ndistinguishes between obscure and clear perceptions inasmuch as the\nformer are not apperceived but the latter are; cf. EP:\n\u00a7\u00a725, 35; RP: \u00a720, and for discussion see Wunderlich\n2005 and Thiel 2011).\n\nAmong the faculties Wolff considers within the lower cognitive faculty\nare the faculty of sense, imagination, the fictive faculty, and\nmemory. Sense, which includes the five sensory modalities, is\nunderstood as the capacity for sensations, where these are perceptions\nthe reason for which is contained in the organs of our bodies, given\nthe presence of an external thing (EP: \u00a7\u00a767, 65).\nImagination, by contrast, is the faculty for producing perceptions in\nthe absence of sensible things. Wolff further claims that the\nimagination\u2019s activity is guided by a general (associative) law\nthat, when we have perceived things together (as parts of a whole, for\ninstance, or as contiguous in space), if the perception of one is\nproduced, then the imagination supplies the perception of the other\n(EP: \u00a7117). It is the imagination that is likewise responsible\nfor the order of ideas in dreams. The fictive faculty (facultas\nfingendi) is our capacity to combine or divide the products of\nthe imagination to create new representations (\u00a7144), and memory\nis defined as the faculty through which we recognize\nreproduced ideas as previously had (\u00a7175).\n\nWhere the lower cognitive faculty handles the generation and\n(re)production of obscure and confused ideas, the higher cognitive\nfaculty encompasses the capacities and operations through which we\nintroduce clarity and distinctness into those ideas. Accordingly,\nWolff first considers the faculties of attention, whereby we introduce\nmore clarity into a part of a composite perception (EP: \u00a7237),\nand reflection, through which we successively direct attention to what\nwe perceive (as well as, in a Lockian vein, to the soul and its\noperations\u2014\u00a7261) and thereby make distinct perception\npossible (\u00a7266). The capacity for distinct representation in\ngeneral is identified as the understanding, which can be pure or\nnon-pure depending on whether it admits confused representations,\nthough since these are unavoidable in the case of the human being, our\nunderstanding is never pure (EP: \u00a7\u00a7313\u20134; for general\ndiscussion see Chance 2018). With an eye to his discussion of logic, Wolff further\ndistinguishes three operations of the intellect with respect to its\ncognitions: simple apprehension (through which notions or\nrepresentations of what is common to multiple things are formed),\njudgment (through which agreement or disagreement between\nrepresentations is asserted), and discursion or reasoning (where\njudgments are formed on the basis of previous judgments) (EP:\n\u00a7\u00a7325, 366\u20137; cf. Dyck 2016, Rumore 2018). This latter\noperation informs Wolff\u2019s definition of the faculty of\nreason as the capacity to perceive the interconnection among universal\ntruths (\u00a7483), though Wolff again emphasizes that our reason is\nnever pure but is always to some extent reliant upon\nexperience (\u00a7\u00a7495\u20137).\n\nWhere the discussion of the cognitive faculty is relevant to\nWolff\u2019s aims in logic and metaphysics, the treatment of the\nappetitive faculty in empirical psychology is significant for\nWolff\u2019s practical philosophy. Wolff likewise distinguishes the\nappetitive faculty into lower and higher parts, where the distinction\nturns on whether there is an obscure or confused cognition of the good\nor evil (grounding a sensory desire or aversion), or a distinct\ncognition of the good or evil (grounding our act of willing or not\nwilling). In connection with the latter, Wolff takes up the issue of\nfreedom. He rejects the conception of freedom in terms of a capacity\nto act contrary to determining motives as counter to our experience\nand to the principle of sufficient reason (EP: \u00a7944), and instead\ndefends a (Leibnizian) compatibilist conception, in accordance with\nwhich a freely willed act involves a distinct cognition of the\nperfection of some thing (which generates a motive to act in its\nfavor); is spontaneous, or has its reason within the agent (insofar as\nthe agent chooses it because it is pleasing); and is contingent, or\nthe agent is not determined to choose it through its essence (EP:\n\u00a7\u00a7933\u201341; cf. Kawamura 1996; Dyck forthcoming[a]).\n\nLastly, but importantly, empirical psychology takes up the\ndistinctively early modern problem of what can be experienced of the\nsoul\u2019s relation to the body. Here Wolff notes that we experience\nthat some states of the soul depend upon the body (such as\nsensations), and some states of the body depend upon the soul (such as\nvoluntary actions), such that the body and soul stand in a union or\ncommercium. Nonetheless, Wolff contends (following\nMalebranche and in anticipation of Hume) that we have no experience of\nthe causal power through which the soul influences the body and vice\nversa, but rather that our experience only confirms the general\nagreement between the states of each without penetrating to its ground\n(EP: \u00a7\u00a7961\u20132).\n\nIn turning to the rational consideration of the soul, Wolff\u2019s\naim is not to determine what can be known completely independently of\nexperience but rather to employ what has been discerned in empirical\npsychology as principles from which its demonstrations proceed and as\ncognitions for which reasons are to be given (RP:\n\u00a7\u00a73\u20134; Richards 1980). Conforming to this, the topics\nof rational psychology proceed from those which are closest to and\ndraw most heavily from empirical psychology, such as the account of\nour soul\u2019s nature and essence, to the increasingly more\nspeculative topics, such as the defense of the pre-established harmony\nto the demonstration of the soul\u2019s immortality and consideration\nof its state after death.\n\nThe determination of the soul\u2019s nature and essence sets out from\nthe definition of the soul given in empirical psychology as that in us\nwhich is conscious of itself and other things. Wolff argues that this\nconsciousness is the result of a complex activity that involves\nreflection on and comparison of parts of a given perception as well as\nattention and memory (RP: \u00a7\u00a722\u20133, 25). Given this,\nWolff contends, the soul must be distinct from body since such an act\ncannot be explained in terms of a change in figure, magnitude, or the\nlocation of parts, through which alone changes in body are possible.\nSimilar considerations serve to show that no composite can think, and\nthus that the soul, as conscious, must not be composite and is\ntherefore simple, and indeed, a simple substance, since it perdures\nthrough changes in its thoughts (RP: \u00a7\u00a744, 47\u20138). That\nthe soul is a substance further implies for Wolff (as it did for\nLeibniz) that it is endowed with a power, understood as a sufficient\nreason for the actuality of the states that are possible for it\nthrough its faculties (RP: \u00a7\u00a754\u20135; cf. Blackwell 1961,\nHe\u00dfbr\u00fcggen-Walter 2004). Wolff proceeds to determine the\ncharacter of this power (which must be a single one given the\nsoul\u2019s simplicity), and he concludes that, because sensations\nare representations of the world in accordance with the position of\nthe organic body, and because all of the representations the soul is\ncapable of are derived from sensations, it follows that the\nsoul\u2019s power is just a power of representing the world in\naccordance with the position of the body, which power Wolff finally\nidentifies as the essence and nature of the soul (RP:\n\u00a7\u00a764\u20139).\n\nRational psychology also takes up the question of what best explains\nthe agreement between the states of the soul and the body. Wolff\nconsiders three possible systems that purport to explain this\nagreement: (i) the system of physical influx, according to which one\nsubstance produces a state in another directly through its own\nactivity (RP: \u00a7\u00a7558\u201360), (ii) the (Cartesian) system\nof occasional causes, according to which God modifies one substance on\nthe occasion of some state arising in another\n(\u00a7\u00a7589\u201391); and (iii) the (Leibnizian) system of\npre-established harmony, where the agreement between states of\nsubstances is the result of God\u2019s initial activity in\nactualizing this world of substances (\u00a7\u00a7612\u201313). Wolff\nprovides a number of familiar objections to the first two systems,\nclaiming for instance, that physical influx conflicts with the laws of\nphysics (cf. \u00a7\u00a7578\u20139), and that occasionalism relies\non what amounts to a perpetual miracle (cf. \u00a7603), while\ndefending the pre-established harmony from similar criticisms (cf.\nWatkins 2005: 45\u201351). Even so, given that any possible\nexplanation cannot be confirmed or rejected by experience (as was\ndisclosed at the conclusion of empirical psychology), each of these\nsystems amounts to a mere hypothesis, and Wolff\u2019s\nconclusion is only that the pre-established harmony is a more\nprobable hypothesis than the other two (RP: \u00a7\u00a7503,\n685; cf. Dyck 2014: 34\u20136), though he thinks that nothing\nsignificant turns on settling this contentious issue.\n\nThe last major topic Wolff turns to is the most speculative, namely,\nthe demonstration of the soul\u2019s immortality of the soul and its\nstate after death. Immortality is taken to presuppose the\nincorruptibility of the soul, that is, that the soul does not\nnaturally pass away after the death of the body, but (contrary to the\nCartesians) Wolff does not think that this is all that is involved as\nany immortality worth having (and that would be consistent with\nScripture) must also extend to the preservation of the soul\u2019s\ncapacity for distinct perception (that is, its spirituality) and its\nconsciousness that it is the same being in the afterlife as it was\nbefore the body\u2019s death (or its personality). The\nsoul\u2019s incorruptibility follows straightforwardly from the fact\nthat it is simple (and so incapable of decomposition); inductive\ngrounds are offered in favor of the soul\u2019s preservation of its\nspirituality (namely, that the clarity of the soul\u2019s perceptions\nis enhanced in all \u201cgreat changes\u201d\u2014RP: \u00a7745);\nand the soul\u2019s maintenance of its personality is shown by\nreference to the law of imagination in accordance with which its\nsubsequent perceptions will lead it to recall previous ones. The\nrelative merits of these arguments were hotly debated, with especially\nnotable contributions by Wolff\u2019s colleague in Halle, G. F.\nMeier, and later by Mendelssohn (in his famous Phaedo), and\nultimately Kant (for discussion, see Sassen 2008; Dyck 2014:\n141\u201372).\n",
