    "main_text": "What Kind of Power Is Domination? || Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n4.2 Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n\nNorm-independent, moralized theories of domination are less\ninfluential than non-moralized varieties. Even so, their appeal is\neasy to see. There is straightforward reason to moralize domination:\ni.e., dominators use their power to do bad things. Slave masters rape\nand assault their slaves. Men within patriarchy rape and assault\nwomen. Domination allows evil deeds go unpunished. This impunity is\nperhaps what matters most to those who think of domination in a\nmoralized way. To be sure, not that every act of moral wrong manifests\ndomination. When a master tortures his slave, this is domination; but\nwhen a slave gets the drop on his master and tortures him it may not\nbe, even on the assumption that both cases of torture are wrong. Why?\nThe difference is in what the master will face as a consequence for\ntorturing the slave, as opposed to what the slave will face for\ntorturing the master. The master wrongs the slave with impunity; the\nslave wrongs the master only at grave risk from the enforcers of the\nsystem that enslaves him. To get domination instead of\nwrongdoing, it is necessary to include a requirement like\nthis: as a first pass, A dominates B just because\nA can wrong B in the context of an asymmetric power\nrelation favoring A. If A can wrong B with\nimpunity, and B knows this, A will be well-positioned to\nexercise control over B. B will know that refusal to\ncomply with A may result in violation of B\u2019s\nrights or interests.\n\nThe most common approaches to moralization without norm-dependence\ncouch domination in terms of violating \u201cbasic\u201d or\n\u201cbest\u201d interests. Allen (1999), Lukes (2005), and Wartenberg\n(1990) are primary advocates of a \u201cbasic\u201d interests\napproach. Kittay (1999: 34), Laborde (2013: 285), and Shapiro\n(2012: 310; 2016: 23) share an emphasis on \u201cbest\u201d\ninterests. Shapiro looks to local custom for guidance about the\nstandard for legitimate power, unless those customs dramatically\nundercut the interests of the less powerful. For example, he is happy\nto leave judgments of legitimate parental power to parents, except for\nthose who would deny their children education and healthcare. The\nbaseline is what is necessary to live as \u201ca normal adult\u201d\nin the context of contemporary democracies (2012: 294). Laborde\nmoralizes basic interests by appeal to what \u201cwe have reason to\nvalue\u201d (2013: 285), as opposed to what people might actually\nvalue. A non-moralized account of basic interests, of course, might\nconnect interests to what people actually value, regardless of what\nthey have reason to value. But this would leave us in the awkward\nposition of being unable to recognize domination in brainwashed slaves\nwho value their subordination. \n",
