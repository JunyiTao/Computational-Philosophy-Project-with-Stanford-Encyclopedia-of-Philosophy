    "main_text": "Judgment Sentimentalism || Hybrid and Pluralist Approaches\n3.5 Hybrid and Pluralist Approaches\n\nHybrid theories solve the problem of fitting together the\nrepresentational and practical aspects of moral judgment by arguing\nthat both cognitive and non-cognitive states are in play somehow:\nmoral judgments have both a sentimental and a non-sentimental aspect.\nSeveral options have been explored recently, including hybrid\nexpressivism, hybrid state theories, and moral thought pluralism,\nwhich will be discussed below.\n\nHybrid expressivism comes in many varieties. Perhaps the\nbest-known is Michael Ridge\u2019s \u2018ecumenical\nexpressivism\u2019 (Ridge 2006). Take the judgment that I must tell\nthe truth to the judge. As a first approximation, such judgment\nconsists in approval of actions of a certain kind, and the belief that\ntelling the truth to the judge is an action of that kind (cf. Barker\n2000). Maybe I approve of actions that maximize utility, and believe\nthat telling the truth to the judge maximizes utility. For Ridge\n(2014), the non-cognitive element is embracing a normative perspective\nthat admits a set of standards as authoritative for practical\nreasoning (in this case, a utilitarian one), and the cognitive one an\nordinary belief to the effect that those standards require telling the\ntruth.\n\nRidge argues that this type of view accounts for the attractions of\nnon-cognitivism, chiefly avoiding problematic ontological commitment\nto non-deflationary moral facts and explaining practicality. When they\nhave a normative perspective that involves a desire-like attitude\ntowards what they believe to be required by certain standards,\npractically rational agents form an instrumental desire to perform\nsuch actions. The cognitive element of the judgment, in turn, serves\nto explain the compositionality and inferential features of moral\nlanguage in the familiar truth-conditional fashion. For other versions\nof expressivism that involve expressing suitably related desire-like\nstates and beliefs, see especially Boisvert (2008), Toppinen (2013),\nand Schroeder (2013), and Fletcher and Ridge (eds.) (2014).\n\nJesse Prinz\u2019s (2007) account of moral judgment can be classified\nas a hybrid state theory. The key to his view is his theory\nof emotions (Prinz 2004), according to which they are perceptions of\npatterns of bodily changes that represent what they are \u201cset up\nto be set off by\u201d \u2013 what it is their function to detect\n\u2013 just the same way as any other psychological states do on\nteleological theories of representation. For Prinz, a moral\nsentiment is a disposition to respond to certain actions with\na range of self- and other-directed blame- or praise-constituting\nemotions, such as guilt, contempt, anger, and gratitude. A moral\njudgment consists in the emotion that results from activating\na sentiment, such as anger at stealing or shame for fleeing. The anger\nrepresents stealing as being such as to cause disapprobation in the\njudge \u2013 that is, as morally wrong, according to Prinz\u2019s\nrelativist moral metaphysics\n (see Section 4.1).\n This means the judgment can be true or false (relative to a judge).\nIt also motivates punishing the agent. Other emotions, and hence\njudgments, have different motivational effects \u2013 disgust may\nmotivate to avoid the agent instead. An evident challenge to this view\nis thus the seeming possibility of our making non-emotional moral\njudgments, as well as having non-judgmental moral emotions.\n\nFinally, moral thought pluralism, according to which\ndifferent moral thoughts are constituted by different kinds of\npsychological state, is a very new approach, although Elizabeth\nRadcliffe (2006) argues that already Hume distinguished between two\nkinds of moral thought. Linda Zagzebski (2003) and Uriah Kriegel\n(2012) argue in different ways that there are two kinds of moral\njudgment, one of which contains an affective element. Kriegel\u2019s\nsuggestion is that moral judgments that result from automatic,\nnon-conscious Type I processes consist in what Tamar Gendler (2008)\nlabeled \u201caliefs\u201d, cognitive states that affect our\nbehavior even if they go against our conscious judgments. Moral\njudgments that result from conscious, effortful Type II thought are\nfor Kriegel ordinary beliefs with an objectivist phenomenology. Since\nKriegel accepts that ordinary beliefs don\u2019t motivate on their\nown, on his view internalism is true only of moral aliefs. (For\nskepticism about aliefs, see Sinhababu 2017: 129\u2013134.)\n\nIn a similar vein, Kauppinen (2013; 2015) distinguishes between moral\nintuitions or appearances, which are constituted by\n(typically emotional) manifestations of sentiments we expect others to\nshare, and moral judgments, which are (implicitly) beliefs\nabout what would be permitted, required, or recommended by standards\nan ideal subject would endorse. As with other appearances, the\nexistence of moral thoughts that are not judgments is clearest in\ncases in which they clash with judgment, such as when it appears to\nHuck Finn that it is wrong to reveal where Jim is, though he believes\nhe ought to do so. Kauppinen maintains that moral seemings have a\ndistinctive and diverse phenomenological and motivational character\n(in contrast to, say, mathematical intuitions), which is best\nexplained by their being sentimental in nature. Motivational\ninternalism is thus true of moral appearances, as Kriegel holds for\nmoral alief.\n\nOne important contrast with Kriegel is that for Kauppinen, moral\nappearances are not themselves judgments, but explain and potentially\njustify moral beliefs. Moral appearances are thus taken to be in this\nrespect parallel to perceptual appearances \u2013 non-doxastic states\nthat attract assent to their propositional contents\n (see Section 5.1).\n (Graham Oddie (2005) defends a view according to which\ndesires constitute appearances of value, and play a similar\nepistemic role.) Since appearances often cause moral beliefs, the two\nkinds of thought often co-occur. But moral beliefs can be arrived at\nand held independently of moral appearances. This accounts for the\nforce of motivational externalist objections and the possibility of\namoralism (though on Kauppinen\u2019s view, fully competent moral\nagents are motivationally and deliberatively sensitive to beliefs with\nsuch contents). Since the beliefs expressed by moral judgments are\nordinary descriptive ones, there is no need for a separate moral\nsemantics. Pluralist views thus split the difference between\nnon-cognitivist and cognitivist sentimentalism: each is, broadly\nspeaking, true of one important kind of moral thought (in contrast to\nhybrid views, according to which each thought has both\nnon-cognitive and cognitive elements).\n",
