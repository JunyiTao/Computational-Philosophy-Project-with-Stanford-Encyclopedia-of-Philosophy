    "main_text": "Methodology || Differences from and Affinities to Plato\n3.2 Differences from and Affinities to Plato\n\nRead in this way, Aristotle is engaged in a project similar in some\nrespects to the one Plato carried out in the Republic. One of\nPlato\u2019s central points is that it is a great advantage to\nestablish a hierarchical ordering of the elements in one\u2019s soul;\nand he shows how the traditional virtues can be interpreted to foster\nor express the proper relation between reason and less rational\nelements of the psyche. Aristotle\u2019s approach is similar: his\n\u201cfunction argument\u201d shows in a general way that our good\nlies in the dominance of reason, and the detailed studies of the\nparticular virtues reveal how each of them involves the right kind of\nordering of the soul. Aristotle\u2019s goal is to arrive at\nconclusions like Plato\u2019s, but without relying on the Platonic\nmetaphysics that plays a central role in the argument of the\nRepublic. He rejects the existence of Plato\u2019s forms in\ngeneral and the form of the good in particular; and he rejects the\nidea that in order to become fully virtuous one must study mathematics\nand the sciences, and see all branches of knowledge as a unified\nwhole. Even though Aristotle\u2019s ethical theory sometimes relies\non philosophical distinctions that are more fully developed in his\nother works, he never proposes that students of ethics need to engage\nin a specialized study of the natural world, or mathematics, or\neternal and changing objects. His project is to make ethics an\nautonomous field, and to show why a full understanding of what is good\ndoes not require expertise in any other field.\n\nThere is another contrast with Plato that should be emphasized: In\nBook II of the Republic, we are told that the best type of\ngood is one that is desirable both in itself and for the sake of its\nresults (357d\u2013358a). Plato argues that justice should be placed in\nthis category, but since it is generally agreed that it is desirable\nfor its consequences, he devotes most of his time to establishing his\nmore controversial point\u2014that justice is to be sought for its\nown sake. By contrast, Aristotle assumes that if A is\ndesirable for the sake of B, then B is better than\nA (1094a14\u201316); therefore, the highest kind of good\nmust be one that is not desirable for the sake of anything else. To\nshow that A deserves to be our ultimate end, one must show\nthat all other goods are best thought of as instruments that promote\nA in some way or other. Accordingly, it would not serve\nAristotle\u2019s purpose to consider virtuous activity in isolation\nfrom all other goods. He needs to discuss honor, wealth, pleasure, and\nfriendship in order to show how these goods, properly understood, can\nbe seen as resources that serve the higher goal of virtuous activity.\nHe vindicates the centrality of virtue in a well-lived life by showing\nthat in the normal course of things a virtuous person will not live a\nlife devoid of friends, honor, wealth, pleasure, and the like.\nVirtuous activity makes a life happy not by guaranteeing happiness in\nall circumstances, but by serving as the goal for the sake of which\nlesser goods are to be pursued. Aristotle\u2019s methodology in\nethics therefore pays more attention than does Plato\u2019s to the\nconnections that normally obtain between virtue and other goods. That\nis why he stresses that in this sort of study one must be satisfied\nwith conclusions that hold only for the most part (1094b11\u201322).\nPoverty, isolation, and dishonor are normally impediments to the\nexercise of virtue and therefore to happiness, although there may be\nspecial circumstances in which they are not. The possibility of\nexceptions does not undermine the point that, as a rule, to live well\nis to have sufficient resources for the pursuit of virtue over the\ncourse of a lifetime.\n",
