Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity\n\nIn order to explain what normativity consists in, philosophers have\npursued just a few basic strategies. First, it is evident that there\nis a close relationship between normative beliefs and decisions or\nactions, at least when a person is rational. Given this, some theories\npropose a kind of constitutive relationship between normativity and\nmotivation, or between normativity and intentions to act, or between\nnormativity and agency. Second, it has seemed evident to some\nphilosophers that normativity must somehow have a deep psychological\nground if normative demands are not to seem alien to people. So some\ntheories propose that normativity is tied to the essential nature of\npersons as rational, or to what is essential to agency, or at least to\nthe \u201cidentity\u201d of agents, or their \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d. Third, some theories look at the role of normative\nbeliefs in the lives of human beings, in orienting humans to what will\nmake for flourishing lives, or in coordinating and organizing human\nbeings in joint activities in their societies in ways that allow their\nsocieties to flourish.\n\nThis entry will briefly introduce eight kinds of theory. Be aware,\nthat these will be merely sketches of the basic ideas. Note also that\nthe theories are not all intended as examples of reductive normative\nnaturalistic realism. In some cases, the intention is merely to\nilluminate the nature of normativity without achieving a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity. Some of the examples are realist, but some\nare anti-realist, expressivist or constructivist. And among the\nrealist cases are examples of both mind-independent normative realism\nand of basic normative realism. We begin with a perspective on the\nnature of normativity that has been taken to support non-cognitivist\nexpressivism, although it can also be interpreted in a way that is\nfriendly to realism. We then sketch two ideas that are examples of\nbasic-realist approaches, but that eschew mind-independence. They are\nsometimes classified as \u201cconstructivist\u201d and anti-realist.\nIt is not until we reach the final two cases, in\n section 4.7\n and\n section 4.8,\n that we find clear examples of naturalistic constitutive explanations\nof robust normativity that are also examples of mind-independent\nrealism. What follows, then, are eight strategies that have been\nused in attempting to explain normativity.\n",
