    "main_text": "Metaphysical Holism\n3. Metaphysical Holism\n\nThe metaphysical holist believes that the nature of some wholes is not\ndetermined by that of their parts. One may distinguish three varieties\nof metaphysical holism: ontological, property and nomological\nholism.\n\nOntological Holism:\n Some objects are not wholly composed of basic physical parts.\n\n\nProperty Holism: Some objects have properties that are not\ndetermined by physical properties of their basic physical parts.\n\n\nNomological Holism: Some objects obey laws that are not\ndetermined by fundamental physical laws governing the structure and\nbehavior of their basic physical parts.\n\n\nAll three theses require an adequate clarification of the notion of a\n basic physical part.\n One way to do this would be to consider objects as basic, relative to\na given class of objects subjected only to a certain kind of process,\njust in case every object in that class continues to be wholly\ncomposed of a fixed set of these (basic) objects. Thus, atoms would\ncount as basic parts of hydrogen if it is burnt to form water, but not\nif it is converted into helium by a thermonuclear reaction. But this\nway excludes consideration of time-slices and point events (for\nexample) as basic (spatio)temporal parts of an object. What counts as\na part, and what parts are basic, are matters best settled in a\nparticular context of enquiry.\n\nWeinberg\u2019s (1992) reductionism is opposed to nomological holism\nin science. He claims, in particular, that thermodynamics has been\nexplained in terms of particles and forces, which could hardly be the\ncase if thermodynamic laws were autonomous. In fact thermodynamics\npresents a fascinating but complex test case for the theses both of\nproperty holism and of nomological holism. One source of complexity is\nthe variety of distinct concepts of both temperature and entropy that\nfigure in both classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\nAnother is the large number of quite differently constituted systems\nto which thermodynamics can be applied, including not just gases and\nelectromagnetic radiation but also magnets, chemical reactions, star\nclusters and black holes. Both sources of complexity require a careful\nexamination of the extent to which thermodynamic properties are\ndetermined by the physical properties of the basic parts of\nthermodynamic systems. A third difficulty stems from the problematic\nstatus of the probability assumptions that are required in addition to\nthe basic mechanical laws in order to recover thermodynamic principles\nwithin statistical mechanics. (An important example is the assumption\nthat the micro-canonical ensemble is to be assigned the standard,\ninvariant, probability distribution.) Since the basic laws of\nmechanics do not determine the principles of thermodynamics without\nsome such assumptions (however weak), there may well be at least one\ninteresting sense in which thermodynamics establishes nomological\nholism. The related entry\n philosophy of statistical mechanics\n contains further discussion of these difficulties, especially in\nSection 6.\n",
