    "main_text": "Radical Concepts of Ideology\n2. Radical Concepts of Ideology\n\n\nA more critical understanding of law\u2019s relation to ideology, and the\nrole and purposes that ideology serves, is found in the writings of\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Like De Tracy, Marx and Engels contend\nthat ideas are shaped by the material world, but as historical\nmaterialists they understand the material to consist of relations of\nproduction that undergo change and development. Moreover, for Marx and\nEngels, it is the exploitative and alienating features of capitalist\neconomic relations that prompt ideas they dub \u2018ideology.\u2019\nIdeology only arises where there are social conditions such as those\nproduced by private property that are vulnerable to criticism and\nprotest; ideology exists to protect these social conditions from attack\nby those who are disadvantaged by them. Capitalist ideologies give an\ninverted explanation for market relations, for example, so that human\nbeings perceive their actions as the consequence of economic factors,\nrather than the other way around, and moreover, thereby understand the\nmarket to be natural and inevitable. Members of the Frankfurt School\nsuch as J\u00fcrgen Habermas drew on the Marxist idea of ideology as a\ndistortion of reality to point to its role in communication, wherein\ninterlocutors find that power relations prevent the open, uncoerced\narticulation of beliefs and values.\n\n\nThus ideology, far from being a science, as De Tracy contends, or\nany set of action-oriented beliefs as Bell puts it, is rather\ninherently conservative, quietist, and epistemically unreliable.\nIdeology conserves by camouflaging flawed social conditions, giving an\nillusory account of their rationale or function, in order to legitimate\nand win acceptance of them. Indeed, on this view of the ideological\nrole of law, in a just society there would be no need for a mystifying\naccount of reality, and thus no need for law. The concept of law as\nideology is thus central to the Marxist view that law will wither away\nwith the full flowering of communism (Sypnowich 1990, ch. 1).\n\n\nThe negative view of ideology taken by Marxists might suggest a crude\nconception where legal ideology is a tool cynically wielded by the\npowerful to ensure submission by the powerless. However, it offends\nthe \u201cconception of right,\u201d if \u201ca code of law is the\nblunt, unmitigated, unadulterated expression of the domination of a\nclass\u201d (Engels, letter to C. Schmidt, October 27, 1890). And\nbecause ideology such as law takes a formal and normative form, the\npowerful are in its grips too, persuaded by an account of the\ninevitable and just order from which they profit.  Moreover, ideology\nis no mere fiction; it is produced by real social conditions and\nreflects them. Ideology thus must succeed in constituting a consensus\nabout capitalism, and it must do so by giving expression to\ncapitalism\u2019s recognizable features. Equality before the law, for\nexample, is both elicited by, and reflects, the reality of capitalist\neconomic relations, even if it is an equality that is formal and\nincomplete. Consent will not be forthcoming if legal ideology bears no\nrelation whatsoever to the social conditions it seeks to justify.  The\nidea that ideology inverts reality is important here. In his camera\nobscura metaphor in The German Ideology, Marx contends that\nreality appears upside down in ideology, much like the photographic\nprocess provides an inverted image. The inverted image is telling; it\nis a recognisable depiction of reality, even if it is at the same time\na distorted one ((Marx and Engels [TGI], 25). Karl Mannheim (1936)\nelaborated further on the idea of the complex relation between reality\nand ideology by pointing to the human need for ideology. Ideologies\nare neither true nor false but are a set of socially conditioned ideas\nthat provide a truth that people, both the advantaged and the\ndisadvantaged, want to hear.\n\n\nIn the 1920s, American jurisprudence came under the influence of\nanother version of the critical view of ideology and law. The school of\nlegal realism abandoned Marx\u2019s specifically historical materialist\nexplanation, but took up the idea that social forces outside the law\nare central in determining what the law is (see Cohen 1935, 818\u201321). Realists opposed\ntraditional \u2018formalist\u2019 accounts of adjudication, where\njudges are understood to rely on uniquely and distinctively legal\nmaterials in rendering their judgments. Instead, the realists contended\nthat law is inherently indeterminate, and thus judicial decisions must\nbe explained by factors outside the law. Ideology emerges as one kind\nof realist explanation, where judicial decisions are the effect of\npolitical ideas, be they of the judge, the legal profession more\ngenerally, societal elites, or majority public opinion. The realists\naligned their critique of law with a progressive politics. The\ninevitable influence of factors external to the law meant that social\nand political changes augured by the emerging welfare state were no\nthreat to the purity of law. Indeed, the expanding regulative power of\nthe administrative state would make it more likely that the influences\non the law were now those of popular sovereignty and social justice,\nrather than the more nefarious influences of the past.\n\n\nThe view that law is a reflection of ideology was taken up again in\nthe 1970s and 80s, with the emergence of the Critical Legal Studies\nmovement. Critical Legal Studies was a radical school of thought\nshaped by a number of influences: the Marxist and realist traditions;\nthe philosophical perspective of \u2018deconstruction;\u2019 and the\npolitics of issues such as feminism, environmentalism and anti-racism.\nThe movement takes up the realist idea that law is fundamentally\nindeterminate, and echoes Marxist views about how the interests of the\npowerful shape law. Exponents offer some astute observations about the\nways in which law is taught and practiced in order to give the\nmisleading impression of law\u2019s certainty and legitimacy. Particular\nlegal doctrines are targeted for papering over the inconsistent and\narbitrary features of legal decision-making; the rule of law, for\nexample, is criticized for a na\u00efve view of the form of law as\nunaffected by law\u2019s content and the social context in which law\noperates. The indeterminacy of law can produce a variety of results;\nDuncan Kennedy, for example, points out the surprising ways in which\nthe ideology of formal legal reasoning can remedy injustice, even if\nideology often disables such remedies as well (Kennedy 1976). Thus the ideology view\ncan now be taken to reflect a consensus among radicals of all stripes\non the role of law as a dissembling force to safeguard the unjust\nrelations of the status quo.\n",
