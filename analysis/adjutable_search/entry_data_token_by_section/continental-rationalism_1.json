    "main_text": "Descartes and His Critics\n2. Descartes and His Critics\n\n\nThe rationalism of the most famous of the rationalists is problematic\non two counts. First, Descartes is known as the father of modern\nphilosophy precisely because he initiated the so-called\nepistemological turn that is with us still. Since Descartes,\nphilosophy has been especially concerned with the theory of knowledge,\nboth in itself and as it affects other areas of philosophy. Ethics,\nfor example, has often been concerned with how the good might be known\nrather than with what the good might be. With his fundamental\nobjective of achieving certainty for his beliefs, Descartes has thus\nbeen principally responsible for the incomplete characterization of\nrationalism as not just etymologically but essentially connected to\nthe claims of reason. While Descartes certainly sought to justify the\nclaims of reason and relied upon them, even for him there are\ncorresponding ontological views that are no less important to his\nsystem.\n\n\nThe second problematic aspect of Descartes\u2019s rationalism is more\ndifficult to resolve. Descartes was a radical voluntarist who thought\nthat all truth, including what we take to be necessary truth, depends\non the will of God. Care needs to be taken in how this view is\nexpressed, for Descartes did not hold simply that what we take to be\nnecessary in fact is contingent. He held that actually necessary truth\ndepends on God\u2019s unconstrained will, such that even propositions\nthat are logically contradictory might have been simultaneously\ntrue. Reason itself thus seems no longer reliable, and experience\nwould seem to be the only way of determining which of the worlds even\nbeyond logic such a powerful and unconstrained God has created. Not\nmany of the rationalists, even among the Cartesians, followed\nDescartes in this radical voluntarism, and some in recent times have\nseen the view as ultimately incoherent. Even so, Descartes seems to\nhave taken the view as the basis at least of his physics, and perhaps\nof his whole system. Indeed, on some accounts, it was this doctrine of\ncreated truth that enabled Descartes to frame the most radical doubt\nhitherto conceived, when in the Meditations he entertained\nthe possibility that he was always deceived by a mendacious deity,\neven when considering what appeared to him most obviously true, to\nwit, the existence of the \u201csimplest things\u201d that are the\nsubjects of arithmetic and geometry. (Against this view, Margaret\nWilson (1982, 105\u2013114), observes that, in Meditation 1, God need\nonly have the power to deceive me about the eternal truths, not to\ncreate them.) While a doubt (and a doctrine) this radical might lead\none to despair of ever achieving sure knowledge, for Descartes, it was\nthe catalyst for his discovery of the cogito, and with it,\nhis first indubitable truth\u2014the truth of his own existence.\n\n\nAt every stage of Descartes\u2019s argument in\nthe Meditations, there are ontological implications: the\nmind\u2019s independence of sensory perceptions (perceptions whose\nreliability is ultimately upset by the possibility that he is\ndreaming), the literally unimaginable sort of thing that a physical\nobject such as a piece of wax must be, the existence of a veracious\nGod, who provides a guarantee for the reliability of reason, and\nfinally the existence of a physical world consisting of extended\nthings. Arnauld immediately suggested to Descartes that his argument\ncontained a circle: we can rely on reason only if we know that God\nexists, but we know that God exists only by relying on reason. Thus,\nDescartes has established the certainty only of his own existence, but\nnothing beyond that. Descartes thought that he had a response to this\ncriticism, but whether he did, and how cogent it is as a rebuttal,\nhave been perennial questions of debate among Descartes scholars. One\nway to understand Descartes\u2019s procedure is that while he does\nnot claim to prove even that he exists, he does claim to show that it\nis unreasonable to think otherwise. That is, he shows that the\nargument of the skeptic fails because the consistent application of\nreason leads to the view not that reason is unreliable, but precisely\nthe opposite. The skeptic might be right, but he is unreasonable. A\nparallel case in the moral realm might be brought out here. Over the\ncourse of an exchange with Mesland about the nature of human freedom,\nDescartes notes that we can, absolutely speaking, act against against\nour reason and judgment. However, morally speaking, we cannot (CSM III\n245/AT 4:173). When explaining what he means by this, Descartes\nsuggests that we can only act against our better judgment and reason\nin the case where we take it to be a good thing to demonstrate our\nfreedom by doing so. This is what Kenny has called the \u201cfreedom\nof perversity\u201d (Kenny 1998). In other words, only with the\nattitude of perversion can we act against what we take to be best. So,\nas in the epistemological realm, so too in the moral realm: it is\nunreasonable or even perverse to deny the results of the consistent\nuse of reason. Descartes thus emerges at least as a bootstrap\nrationalist\u2014using innate reason and a disinclination to\nperversity to assert the truth of his own existence, which, in turn,\nserves as a foundation for a more extensive search after\ntruth\u2014in a way that mirrors the non-absolute status of his\nnecessary truths. The rationalist connection between the orders of\nbeing and knowing is thus preserved.\n\n\nBut what sense can be made of the doctrine of created truth? By what\nkind of causality did God create the eternal (necessary) truths? In\nresponse to this very question Descartes replied that God did so in\njust the way that He created everything else, that He is the total and\nefficient cause not only of the existence of created things, but also\nof their essence. The eternal truths are just this essence of created\nthings. As before, Descartes did not elaborate his answer, but, once\nagain, he provided enough elsewhere for us to do so. It is clear that\nfor Descartes, as for many other theologically orthodox thinkers, the\nexistence of things results from an unconstrained exercise of God\u2019s\nomnipotent will to create ex nihilo. What Descartes might be\nsaying, then, is that an eternal truth or essence is also something\nthat is created ex nihilo. The eternal truths might thus be\ninstances of what Descartes called substance.\n\n\nIn the Principles, Descartes defined \u201csubstance\u201d\nas a thing that exists such that its existence does not depend on any\nother thing. He immediately added that, strictly speaking, the term\napplies only to God, who, as uncreated, alone depends on nothing else\nto exist. However, he allowed that in an extended sense it applies to\nthings that depend only on God\u2019s creation and continuing\nconservation. These created substances are really distinct from other\nsubstances insofar as they are conceivable apart from each other. They\ndo not require a subject of inherence, and are thus ontologically, if\nnot causally, independent. These created substances are distinguished\nfrom other things, such as qualities, which not only depend on God\ncausally, but also depend ontologically on other things, ultimately on\ncreated substances, as subjects of inherence. In this sense, a created\nsubstance for Descartes is like the hypokeimenon of\nAristotle, playing both its roles, as individuator and bearer of\nqualities. However, with his definition of the real distinction, he\nbuilt in an unintended tendency toward monism\u2014a tendency that\nSpinoza exploited. For Descartes, one thing is really distinct from\nanother just in case it can be conceived apart from that other. But,\nif this test of independence is applied to causal relations, it\nproduces the result that there is but one substance, God.\n\n\nWhat types of things counted as created substances for Descartes?\nClearly, he takes an individual mind to be a created substance. If a\nmind did not have this status, then Descartes\u2019s argument for its\nimmortality, that it can be conceived apart from all else except God,\nand a fortiori from the body, would collapse. Beyond minds,\nhowever, an ambiguity appears. Although there are texts in which\nDescartes speaks of individual things like a piece of wax as\nsubstances, there are others\u2014most famously, the Synopsis to\nthe Meditations\u2014that indicate that there is but a\nsingle extended substance, of which individual things are the\nmodes. At a minimum, there is an asymmetry in his treatment of minds\nand material things, perhaps reflecting the tension between\na hypokeimenon, accounting for difference, and the other\nsense of ousia, accounting for sameness. To say that Peter\nand Paul are substances is to say that their minds are numerically\ndistinct; but to say that a piece of wax and a piece of wood are\nsubstances might be to say that they are both extended things.\n\n\nHowever many instances of each kind there might be, there is a\ndualism of two kinds of substance, according to Descartes: thinking\nthings, or minds, and extended things, or bodies. This dualism\ngenerated two well-known problems, resolved by Descartes with only\npartial success. One of his most incisive critics, Elisabeth of\nBohemia, wanted to know how in voluntary action the will, which is a\nproperty of the unextended mind, could have an effect on the body,\ngiven that, according to Descartes\u2019s mechanistic physics, a material\nthing can be affected only by what is in contact with it. Descartes\nreplied with a rather mysterious account of how the mind and body\nformed a unique kind of composite. Over the course of the letters of\ntheir correspondence that focus on this issue, Elisabeth presses\nDescartes for an explanation of how mind and body interact.\nDescartes\u2019s responses do not satisfy Elisabeth, and rightly so.\nFor, the mysterious composite that he suggests involves the concept of\na primitive notion (Shapiro, 65/AT 3:665), a concept that is\nnot present in any other of his writings. Descartes states that we have\nprimitive notions for the body, \u201cextension\u201d, for the mind,\n\u201cthought\u201d, and for the mind/body composite,\n\u201cunion.\u201d He explains that each of these notions is best\nunderstood by using a faculty that is particularly well-suited to grasp\nit. The primitive notion for the mind, he states, is best understood by\nthe understanding alone; the primitive notion of the body is best\nunderstood by the understanding aided by the imagination; and the\nprimitive notion of the composite is best understood by the senses\n(Shapiro, 69/AT 3:691). Armed with the distinction in methodology for\nknowing each of these notions, Descartes diagnoses Elisabeth\u2019s\ndifficulty in understanding his explanation in the following way: She\nis trying too hard to understand the union of her mind and body by her\nunderstanding alone. The remedy to this problem, he suggests, is for\nthe Princess to stop meditating on the problem, and to instead focus on\n\u201clife and ordinary conversations\u201d in order to conceive the\nunion (Shapiro, 70/AT 3:692). But, of course, this recommendation does\nnot adequately address Elisabeth\u2019s question. For, while focusing\non \u201clife\u201d and \u201cordinary conversations\u201d may well\nhelp to conceive that the mind and body interact, a point that\nElisabeth does not call into question, it furnishes nothing towards an\nanswer to the question of how such an interaction occurs. The\ndiscussion of this topic comes to an end with Elisabeth\u2019s\nsuggestion that she is better able to understand the how of\ninteraction by thinking that part of the soul is extended (Shapiro,\n72/AT 4:1). On this model, a necessary condition for motion, contact,\nis possible.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019s effort to resolve a second difficulty is more promising,\nand also exemplifies the rationalistic character of his thought. The\nproblem is to show how the mind can know something such as a material\nthing that is different in kind from it, given a longstanding principle\nthat only like can know like. He rejected this essentially Aristotelian\nprinciple, but still had to give an account of such knowledge. From\nscholastic sources, Descartes was able to construct a theory of ideas\naccording to which to know something is to have an idea of it, the idea\nbeing the very thing known in so far as it is known. He saw the term\n\u201cidea\u201d as ambiguous: taken materially, it has formal\nreality, as a mode of the mind; taken in another sense, it has\nobjective reality, as the thing represented. But there is no real\ndistinction between these realities, only a rational distinction. They\nare really the same thing considered differently. A welcome\nepistemological upshot of this rationalist gambit is that Descartes has\nno skeptical problems generated by ideas standing as a tertium\nquid between the knower and what is known.\n\n\nThis result is indicated by Descartes\u2019s use of the term, picked up\nand emphasized by Malebranche, according to which there are no\nfalse ideas; every idea in this sense is materially true in\nthat it has an object, and that is the object it appears to have. This\nconception of an idea is the basis for Descartes of what has been\ncalled the transparency of mind: I cannot be mistaken that I am\nthinking about what I am thinking about. Malebranche (whose entire\nphilosophy was colored by his struggles with Descartes\u2019s theory\nof ideas), in fact, later erected such incorrigible intentionality\ninto the fundamental principle of his epistemology. Meanwhile,\nDescartes\u2019s view that material or formal reality and objective\nreality are only rationally distinct might be taken to mean that minds\nare intrinsically intentional. A mind just is the sort of thing whose\nstates are about something else. Arnauld extended this thesis, which\nadumbrates later thinkers such as Brentano, to include all mental\nphenomena, even sensations.\n\n\nAnother line of discussion that relates to the problem of dualism and\nthe nature of ideas is advanced in 1734 by Ghanaian philosopher Anton\nAmo. An extraordinarily interesting thinker in his own right, Amo\nadvances a critique of Descartes\u2019s assertion that the mind can\nsense, that is, that the immaterial mind can passively receive sensory\ninformation. In his dissertation, On the Apatheia of the Human\nMind, or The Absence of Sensation and the Faculty of Sense in\nthe Human Mind and Their Presence in our Organic and Living Body,\nAmo states that the human mind is spirit, and that spirit is that\nsubstance that is purely active. Following the narrative of the\ncommitment to the metaphysical reality of substance as the common\nfeature of rationalists through this period, Amo sits firmly in the\nrationalist camp. But it is on the basis of this particular definition\nof substance that Amo distinguishes his view from\nDescartes\u2019s. According to Descartes, the mind can sense. For\nAmo, sensation, which is purely passive, cannot be a feature of the\nspiritual, purely active substance of mind. There are two threads of\nAmo\u2019s critique. First, he is concerned to uphold the soul in the\nlofty position that it deserves given its status as purely active. His\ncritique of Descartes on this point intersects with the objections\nraised by Elisabeth: the mind, being immaterial, cannot interact with\nmaterial things. Thus, the mind cannot have sensation of material\nobjects (Amo, 75). Second, Amo wishes to emphasize the essential\nnature of the body for human beings. On his view, \u201cto live and\nto have sensation\u201d are inseparable predicates. All living things\nfeel; all feeling things live. But, on his view, \u201cto live\u201d\nis to be embodied. This allows Amo to call into question\nDescartes\u2019s claim, in Meditations II, that he is\nnothing but a thinking thing. For Amo, it is impossible for the\n\u201cthinking thing\u201d to live without a body. Amo is thus a\ndualist, like Descartes, but with the important difference of removing\nsensation from the mind, and locating it in the body. This move\nsimultaneously preserves the pure activity of the mind and boosts the\nimportance of the body in the entity that is a human being.\n\n\nBut Amo\u2019s dualism faces the same problem as Descartes\u2019s:\nif we accept the fact that the body senses and the mind does not, then\nAmo must provide an explanation for how the mind and body communicate.\nIn particular, he must provide an explanation for how the body can\nsense, for instance, pain, and communicate this sensation to the\npurely active mind. While Amo might seem no better situated than\nDescartes to offer such an explanation, he does endorse an interesting\ndefinition of \u201cidea\u201d that may provide a starting point for\nsuch an explanation. Amo states that when we think of the manner in\nwhich a human being functions, there are four elements that must be\nkept separate: mind, the operation of the mind, idea, and immediate\nsensation. Both the mind and its operations are immaterial, he says,\nand immediate sensation is a property of body. However, on Amo\u2019s\nview, \u201cidea\u201d is to be understood as \u201ca composite\nentity; for there is an idea when the mind makes present to itself a\nsensation pre-existing in the body, and thereby brings the feeling\nbefore the mind\u201d (Amo, 74). If by \u201ccomposite\u201d, Amo\nmeans a composite of material and immaterial substance, then this\nsuggestion bears some resemblance to Elisabeth\u2019s claim, above,\nthat she thinks that there could be a material part of the soul that\ncould account for its ability to interact with the body. Of course,\nexplaining just how the mind makes a sensation present to itself and\nthus brings a feeling before it, will determine the success of any\nsuch explanation.\n",
