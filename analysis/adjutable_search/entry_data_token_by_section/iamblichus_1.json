    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nFew of Iamblichus\u2019 works are preserved in the direct manuscript\ntradition. Four of these texts pertain to a summa On\nPythagoreanism (conflicting testimonies exist about its title:\ncf. O\u2019Meara 1989: 32\u201333): On the Pythagorean\nLife; the Protrepticus; On General Mathematical\nScience; and an Introduction to Arithmetic based on\nNicomachus of Gerasa\u2019s treatise of the same name. Sadly, they\nare for the most part impersonal works: the Protrepticus\nconsists in lengthy quotations from previous hortatory literature, and\nits interest mostly lies in the fact that it provides evidence for\nvaluable lost works (most notably Aristotle\u2019s own\nProtrepticus and the so-called Anonymus Iamblichi),\nwhile On the Pythagorean Life plagiarizes previous\nbiographies of the master, although it certainly contains valuable\ninsights on Iamblichus\u2019 conception of the \u201cdivine\nman\u201d. Neither of these works seems to have had any impact over\nthe subsequent course of philosophy, whereas On General\nMathematical Science was at least a formative influence on\nProclus\u2019 commentary to Euclid\u2019s Elements, as well\nas on Syrianus\u2019 commentary on Metaphysics\n\u039c\u2013\u039d (see DGU-2020). It also provides the basic material\nfor the reconstruction of Iamblichus\u2019 philosophy of mathematics\n(see below,\n Section 4).\n For a general characterization of On Pythagoreanism and its\ncontext, see Huffman (2006 [2019: sect. 4.4]).\n\nThe most important extant treatise by Iamblichus, however, is the\nReply of Master Abamon to Porphyry\u2019s Letter to Anebo, and\nSolutions to the Difficulties Contained Therein (abbreviated to\nReply to Porphyry and traditionally known as De mysteriis\n\u00c6gyptiorum since Marsilio Ficino\u2019s original Latin\ntranslation: see SS-2013: ix\u2013xxi). The work is a defense of\nPagan religious practice (sacrifice, prayer, divination etc.; on the\nlatter, see Timotin 2022) against the objections raised by Porphyry,\nand to serve this purpose it introduces several philosophical\ndevelopments on the divine nature and orders, as well as the\npretensions of the human soul. The whole debate is framed with a\nfictional Egyptian scenario: Porphyry had raised his objections in an\nepistle addressed to Anebo, an Egyptian priest, while Iamblichus wrote\nhis reply under the assumed guise of the Egyptian prophet Abamon.\nWhile it had limited direct transmission (the only ancient testimonium\nbeing Proclus, In Timaeum I, 386.8\u201313 [D-1973: Fr. 38],\nalthough Taormina (2014) expressed reservations), its importance as a\ntouchstone against which one can safely compare what can be gathered\nfrom other sources is invaluable.\n\nThe bulk of what remains of Iamblichus\u2019 work consists in approx.\n800 fragments and testimonia. Of these, the extensive excerpts given\nby Stobaeus of a work On the Soul as well as a dozen\nLetters, which have been the object of multiple independent\neditions, stand out as the most coherent, if not necessarily the most\noriginal. By far the most influential part of his philosophical\noutput, his Commentaries on key works by Plato and Aristotle\nare all lost, although in almost two cases (his commentary on the\nCategories, transmitted by Simplicius; that on the\nTimaeus, transmitted by Proclus), quotations are so numerous\nthat one can safely establish the main features of the exegesis given.\nOf the other works Iamblichus wrote commentaries on, the most\nimportant ones are the Alcibiades, the Philebus and\nthe Parmenides, while the existence of a separate, continuous\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s De anima was questioned by\nBlumenthal (1974). A richly annotated edition of the Platonic\nfragments was given by D-1973, while DL-1972 collected all fragments\nknown to Dalsgaard Larsen as an appendix to his monograph, although\nhis work can barely be described as an edition. Another collection\nfocusing on Aristotelian exegesis was produced by Romano [R-2012].\n",
