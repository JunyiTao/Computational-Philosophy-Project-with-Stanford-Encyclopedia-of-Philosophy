    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Absolute and Infinite Space and Time\n3.1 Absolute and Infinite Space and Time\n\nAccording to Clarke, the ideas of space and time are the two\n\u201cfirst and most obvious simple Ideas, that every man has in his\nmind\u201d (D 114, W 2.752), anticipating the first step in an\nargument made famous by Kant. Drawing on an argument from Newton\n(1726, 410), he argued that while matter can be thought of as\nnon-existing, space exists necessarily because \u201cto suppose any\npart of space removed, is to suppose it removed from and out of\nitself: and to suppose the whole to be taken away, is supposing it to\nbe taken away from itself, that is, to be taken away while it still\nremains: which is a contradiction in terms\u201d (D 13, W 2.528).\nSpace is also not an aggregate of its parts but an essential whole\npreceding all it parts.\n\nAbsolute space was allegedly demanded by Newtonian physics. Space is\nan entity in which things are, and not the mere absence of matter. All\nfinite beings occupy an absolute position in space and time that we\nmay or may not be able to establish because we have no direct access\nto absolute space and time. Although space is not sensible, Clarke\nrejected its identification with nothingness, since space has\nproperties: quantity and dimension, and perhaps homogeneity,\nimmutability, continuity, and the ability to contain matter. Law\n(1758, 10) objects that this makes no more sense than saying that\ndarkness has qualities because it has the property of receiving\nlight.\n\nClarke believed that space is necessarily infinite because \u201cto\nset bounds to space, is to suppose it bounded by something which\nitself takes up space\u201d or else that \u201cit is bounded by\nnothing, and then the idea of that nothing will still be space,\u201d\nand both suppositions are contradictory (D 115, W 2.753). Clarke\napparently thought that what has a boundary must be bounded by\nsomething else. If so, the argument was not well taken because a\nsphere, for example, has a boundary which stems from its own nature,\nnot by the presence of something external bounding it (Vailati 2006,\n111). One possible solution is to appeal to space\u2019s peculiar\nnature as a property of an infinite God, which would require that it\nbe boundless in virtue of God\u2019s possible activity being\nboundless (W 1.47), but this might reverse the proper order of\nexplanation or beg the question. (For more on the relationship of God\nto space, see Section 4.2 below.) He also argues that because\nexistence or being is a perfection, existing in more places is a\ngreater perfection, so God (as the most perfect being) must exist in\nall places (W 1.46\u201347). Another possible solution is to appeal\nto the principle of sufficient reason: any finite limit would be\narbitrary, and thus in violation of the principle. Establishing the\ninfinity of space is important to Clarke\u2019s argument that space\nexists outside of us, because our ideas are always finite (Watts 1733,\n4).\n",
