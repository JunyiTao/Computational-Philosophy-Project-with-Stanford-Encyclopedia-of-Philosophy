That is, there will\nbe pervasion given co-locatedness so long as what the \\(S\\) is,\naccording to the definition, is not something that in serving as the\ncounterpositive of an absence\u2014specifically a counterpositive\nhaving shared locations, a universal, a class character, a repeatable\nproperty and not a particular instance (firehood as opposed to, say,\nkitchen fire)\u2014does not share any location that does not also\nhouse a \\(\\neg H\\). Goekoop (1967: 111) has a nice paraphrase that\nmakes the point a little clearer: \u201cThere is a pervasion of \\(H\\)\nby \\(S\\) if and only if \\(H\\) has a common locus with \\(S\\) in such a\nway that \\(S\\) is none of the things that qua class are completely\nabsent from some locus of \\(H\\).\u201d\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s definition is supposed to solve a problem\nconcerning inferences about non-locus-pervading properties, such as a\nmonkey-conjunction in a tree, a case on which many of the rejected\ndefinitions floundered. \u201cThis tree possesses a\nmonkey-conjunction, since it is this tree (which always has\nmonkeys)\u201d is a good inference even though the tree at its roots\nhas the ruled-out sort of counterpositive according to the definition.\nInferences involving conjunctions are ruled in if the \\(S\\) is a\nproperty that while not present at \\(l\\) along with the \\(H\\) in some\nspecified portion of \\(l\\) is not so overall, that is, at or in all\nportions of \\(l\\). The location \\(l\\) would be something that is\nindeed \\(S\\) in some portion, as a tree does have a monkey in its\nbranches though not at its roots.\n",
