The\nmethodology of rational analysis\n (section 3.3)\n likewise appeals to this trade-off.\n\nThe results surveyed in\n Section 5.2\n caution against blindly endorsing the accuracy-effort trade-off as\nuniversal, a point that has been pressed in the defense of heuristics\nas reasonable models for decision-making (Katsikopoulos 2010; Hogarth\n2012).\n\nSimple heuristics like Tallying, which is a type of improper\nlinear model\n (section 2.3),\n and Take-the-best\n (section 7.2),\n when tested against linear regression on many data sets, have been\nboth found to outperform linear regression on out-of-sample prediction\ntasks, particularly when the training-sample size is low (Czerlinski\net al. 1999; Rieskamp & Dieckmann 2012).\n",
