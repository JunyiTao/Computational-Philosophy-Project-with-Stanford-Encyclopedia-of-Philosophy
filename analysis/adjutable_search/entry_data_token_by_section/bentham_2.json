    "main_text": "Pains and Pleasures\n3. Pains and Pleasures\n\nAt the beginning of IPML Bentham offered the famous\ndeclamation that underscores the primacy of pains and pleasures in\nutilitarian theory:\n\nNature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign\nmasters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to\npoint out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall\ndo. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the\nchain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern\nus in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can\nmake to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and\nconfirm it. In words a man may pretend to abjure their empire: but in\nreality he will remain subject to it all the while. The principle\nof utility recognises this subjection, and assumes it for the\nfoundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric\nof felicity by the hands of reason and of law. (1970, 11)\n\n\nThere are two forms of hedonism expressed in this seminal passage: (1)\npsychological hedonism, which states that all motives of action are\ngrounded in the apprehension of pain or the desire for pleasure; and\n(2) ethical hedonism, which holds that pleasure is the only good and\nactions are right in so far as they tend to produce pleasure or avoid\npain. As Bentham went on to explain, allowing for \u201cimmunity from\npain\u201d, pleasure is \u201cthe only good\u201d, and pain\n\u201cwithout exception, the only evil\u201d (1970, 100). As such,\npain and pleasure are the final cause of individual action\nand the efficient cause and means to individual\nhappiness.\n\nNor were these observations restricted to humankind in Bentham\u2019s\nview\u2014the proposed penal code was to include a section on cruelty\nto animals. As he explained, \u201cthe question is not, Can they\nreason? Nor, can they talk? But, can they\nsuffer?\u201d (1970, 283n)\u2014a proposition that lies at the\nbeginnings of utilitarian arguments for the ethical treatment of\nanimals (see Singer 1975).\n\nSince each person\u2019s happiness is constituted of the aggregate\nbalance of pleasures over pains, this is \u201cthe sole end which the\nlegislator ought to have in view: the sole standard in conformity to\nwhich each individual ought, as far as depends upon the legislator, to\nbe made to fashion his behaviour\u201d (1970, 34). But how is the\nlegislator to influence individual actions and gain conformity to his\ndecisions? Bentham delineated four \u201csanctions\u201d or sources\nof pain and pleasure, which he may have learnt from Gay\u2019s essay\nConcerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality\n(1731): physical, political, moral, and religious. These sanctions (he\nlater added sympathy to the list) are available to the moralist and to\nthe legislator in guiding and determining an individual\u2019s moral\nconduct, and they explain how an essentially self-interested\nindividual may be encouraged and, where necessary, directed to perform\nactions that promote the greatest happiness of both himself and\nothers. It is incumbent on the utilitarian legislator, therefore, to\nunderstand the \u201cvalue\u201d of the pains and pleasures he must\nemploy to achieve this objective.\n\nWhile the consequences of an act often depend on the motives which\ngive rise to the act (and partly on the agent\u2019s intentions and\nthe circumstances in which the act is performed), in Bentham\u2019s\ntheory the utility of an act is independent of its originating\nmotive(s). In effect, there is no such thing as a good or bad motive.\nThe utility of an act\u2014its goodness or badness\u2014is\ndetermined solely by its consequences: the benefits and/or costs that\nresult. When deciding whether to act or which act to undertake, a\nperson must calculate as best as he can the pains and pleasures that\nmay reasonably be expected to accrue to the persons (including\nhimself) affected by the acts under consideration. A similar\ncalculation should guide the legislator in formulating laws. However,\nBentham recognised that it was not normally feasible for an individual\nto engage in such a calculation as a preliminary to undertaking every\nact. For this reason he spoke of the general tendencies of actions to\nenhance happiness (suggested by past experience) as a sufficient guide\nin most situations. On the other hand, the implicit consequentialism\nof utilitarian theory is central to Bentham\u2019s theory of\npunishment, in which the objective was to ensure that a punishment is\nin proportion to the mischief produced by a crime and sufficient to\ndeter others from committing the same offence. To this end he\ndeveloped rules to guide the lawmaker in the construction of a penal\ncode, including the elements involved in the calculation of the\nmischief caused by offences and the appropriate punishments.\n",
