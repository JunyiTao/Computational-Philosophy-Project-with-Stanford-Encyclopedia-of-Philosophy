    "main_text": "Thoughts and States of Affairs || Individuation and Existence Conditions\n2.1 Individuation and Existence Conditions\n\nThoughts can be the contents of propositional attitudes. When one says\n\u201cThere are three things that everyone who works on elementary\nphysics believes\u201d, one quantifies over things that everyone\nworking in elementary physics believes: thoughts (see Chisholm 1970:\n19). Thoughts are also truth-value bearers (\u201cThere are three\ntruths that everyone who works in elementary physics\nbelieves\u201d). How are thoughts related to states of affairs? For\ninstance, how is the thought that Socrates is wise related to the\nstate of affairs Socrates\u2019 being wise?\n\nPrima facie, thoughts are one thing, states of affairs\nanother. Thoughts and states of affairs differ in their individuation\nand existence conditions.\n\nIndividuation-conditions: Thoughts are supposed to be the\ncontents of propositional attitudes like belief and desire. Let\n\u201cj\u201d be shorthand for a propositional attitude verb\n(\u201cdesire\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d etc). If one can j\nthat p without eo ipso j-ing that q (and\nvice versa), the contents that p and that q are\ndifferent. Now I can believe, for instance, that Hesperus shines\nwithout believing that Phosphorus shines. Hence, if thoughts are the\ncontents of propositional attitudes, the thought that Hesperus shines\nis different from the thought that Phosphorus shines. If the thought\nthat Hesperus shines is different from the thought that Phosphorus\nshines, thoughts cannot be logical complexes whose constituents are\nparticulars and properties. Following Frege, many philosophers\ntherefore take thoughts to be complexes that are built up out of modes\nof presentation. Here \u201cthoughts\u201d only refers to such\ncomplexes. Since there are different modes of presentation of the same\nparticular (property), there can be different thoughts that concern or\nare about the same particulars and properties. In contrast,\nHesperus\u2019s shining and Phosphorus\u2019s\nshining are the same state of affairs, namely the complex that\ncontains only the planet Venus and the property of shining. We will\nsee in\n section 2.4\n that not all philosophers follow Frege\u2019s lead. If one has\narguments for a coarse-grained individuation of the objects of belief,\nstates of affairs may serve as contents of propositional\nattitudes.\n\nExistence-conditions: A thought is a complex whose\nconstituents are modes of presentation that purport to represent\nobjects. Standard accounts of modes of presentation allow for the\nexistence of modes of presentation that are empty. Hence, the\nexistence of a thought does not depend on the existence of the objects\nit purports to represent. For example, the thought that Pegasus is a\nhorse exists, although there is no such horse (for defense and\nelaboration see Sainsbury 2005: 86\u20139). This is different for\nstates of affairs. If a state of affairs is a complex that contains\nobjects and properties as constituents, it cannot exist if its\nconstituents don\u2019t exist. So while it is true that Pegasus does\nnot exist, there is no such state of affairs. This is unproblematic\nfor we have not been given any reason to think that such a state of\naffairs obtains or does not obtain. For the same reason states of\naffairs that contain contingently existing objects are themselves\ncontingent existents.\n\nPhilosophers often use the notion of a singular proposition. A\nsingular proposition is supposed to be (i) \u201cdirectly\nabout\u201d an object and (ii) evaluable as true or false. Direct\naboutness requires that what the proposition is directly about exists\nif the proposition exists. If one combines (i) and (ii) with the\nplausible assumption that the proposition that Superman does not exist\nis singular and true, one arrives at the conclusion that Superman\nexists. Similar problems arise for negative modal existential singular\npropositions such as the proposition that Socrates might not have\nexisted. Williamson 2002 argues on the basis of these problems that\neverything exists necessarily. Williamson\u2019s modus\nponens is Plantinga\u2019s (1983) and Merricks\u2019s 2015\n(chapt. 5) modus tollens: singular propositions can exist\nalthough the object they are directly about doesn\u2019t.\n\nIf one sides with Plantinga and Merricks, one can drive a wedge\nbetween truth and obtaining. We are not compelled to hold that there\nis a state of affairs Superman\u2019s non-existing because\nwe have no reason to say that such a state of affairs obtains or even\npossibly obtains, while we have a reason to say that it is true that\nSuperman does not exist. Hence, the (singular) proposition that\nSuperman does not exist can be true without the state of affairs\nSuperman\u2019s non-existing obtaining. Obtaining is indeed\nonly truth-like.\n\nChisholm held that propositions are those states of affairs such that\neither the state of affairs or its negation always occurs (on\nChisholm\u2019s notion of state of affairs, see Kim 1979). But, as we\nhave seen, the truth that Superman does not exist cannot be the state\nof affairs Superman\u2019s non-existing occurring or obtaining.\n",
