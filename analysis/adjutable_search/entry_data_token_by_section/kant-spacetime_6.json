    "main_text": "The \u201cTranscendental Exposition\u201d and Kant\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d || What is a transcendental exposition?\n4.1 What is a transcendental exposition?\n\nIn the B (1787) edition of the Critique, \u00a72 of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, the Metaphysical Exposition, is followed by\n\u00a73, the Transcendental Exposition. Whereas the Metaphysical\nExposition deals, as we have seen, with the origin and the content of\nthe representation of space, its transcendental cousin apparently\nattempts to provide an explanation of what Kant takes to be the\nsynthetic a priori knowledge (or cognition) available to us in\ngeometry. This raises very difficult interpretive issues that arise\nwith Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics\u2014such issues are\ndealt with in a separate entry in this Encyclopedia (see Lisa\nShabel\u2019s entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics).\n However, Kant may also be raising a related point in this\nsection\u2014consider the following passage, which is inserted within\nthe discussion of geometry (cf. section 2-b above):\n\nNow how can an outer intuition inhabit the mind, which precedes the\nobjects themselves, and in which the concept of the latter can be\ndetermined a priori? Obviously not otherwise than insofar as\nit has its seat solely in the subject, as its formal constitution for\nbeing affected by objects, and thereby gaining immediate\nrepresentation, i.e., intuition, of them, therefore only\nas the form of outer sense in general. (B41)\n\n\nWe have seen in the Metaphysical Exposition that we have a pure (or\na priori) intuition of space, that is, a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. But how is such a\nrepresentation so much as possible? If we are considering an\nempirical, singular, immediate representation, we can easily\nunderstand that in cases of ordinary perception, we can (e.g.) see a\nrose in a vase in front of us. Hence our perception may include a\nsingular, immediate representation\u2014that is, we may represent\nthat there, an object with a spatial location. This empirical\ncase is reasonably clear, but what does it mean to contend that we\nhave a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation? This cannot\nbe akin to a case of seeing an object directly in front of us, for one\nof Kant\u2019s points in the Metaphysical Exposition, as we have\nseen, is that the representation of places, and of objects as bearing\nspatial relations, presupposes the (non-empirical)\nrepresentation of space. But if our representation of space is not\nakin to seeing something directly in front of us, then what makes it\nimmediate and singular? Kant\u2019s suggestion in the passage above\nappears to be that intuition must somehow have its seat in the\nsubject\u2014it must somehow be a \u201cform\u201d of the mind, or\nmore precisely, of what Kant calls here \u201couter sense\u201d.\nThis obviously brings us very close to the formulation of\ntranscendental idealism\u2014that view is stated explicitly for the\nfirst time in the Critique in the very next paragraph of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic. But the paragraph quoted above, coupled with\nKant\u2019s discussion of what a Transcendental Exposition is meant\nto be, suggests that part of Kant\u2019s goal here is to explain\nhow a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation of space is\npossible. (This is parallel to explaining how synthetic a\npriori knowledge within geometry is possible.)\n\nSimilarly, some commentators have noted that the\n\u201cconclusions\u201d following the Transcendental Exposition (in\nthe very next paragraph following the one quoted above) are given no\nadditional argumentative support, and are therefore intended to follow\nfrom the arguments within the Metaphysical Exposition and the\nTranscendental Exposition. That is, the view that the representation\nof space is an a priori intuition is supposed to entail the rather\nrobust conclusions about space that Kant reaches in the Transcendental\nAesthetic. His first such conclusion\u2014labeled \u201ca\u201d and\nfollowed by another conclusion labeled \u201cb\u201d\u2014is rather\nstartling:\n\nSpace represents no property at all of any things in themselves, nor\nany relation of them to one another, i.e., no determination of them\nthat attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one\nwere to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. For\nneither absolute nor relative determinations can\u2014prior to the\nexistence of the things to which they pertain, thus a\npriori\u2014be intuited. (A26/B42)\n\n\nAmong other things, Kant returns here to the debate concerning space\nand time between the Leibnizians and the Newtonians mentioned at the\noutset of the Transcendental Aesthetic. It seems that Kant intends his\nview to be contrasted with the Newtonian view of space, which\napparently tells us something about its \u201cabsolute\u201d\ndeterminations, and also with the Leibnizian view, which apparently\ntells us something about its \u201crelative\u201d determinations.\nPerhaps Kant is suggesting here that the Newtonian and Leibnizian\nviews of space and time, despite their evident differences along\nvarious dimensions, each indicate that the representation of space\ncannot be a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation, or\nperhaps they tacitly suppose that it cannot be such a representation.\nIf he is suggesting that idea, one wonders why that would be the case.\nI discuss this issue in the next section.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs of the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant\nreaches the famous conclusions that we can speak of space \u201conly\nfrom the human standpoint\u201d (A26/B42) and that space has\n\u201ctranscendental ideality\u201d (A28/B44). This is the heart of\none of Kant\u2019s main positions in the Critique of Pure\nReason. In order to clarify these ideas, I first follow\nKant\u2019s suggestion in the passage above that he intends his\nposition to be contrasted in some respects with the positions of\nLeibniz and of Newton. This maneuver will place us in a position to\nunderstand transcendental idealism in a bit more depth.\n",
