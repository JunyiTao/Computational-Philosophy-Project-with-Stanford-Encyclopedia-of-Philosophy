Henry of Ghent and John Duns Scotus on Mental Content\n\nFor various reasons, the late thirteenth century saw an increased\ninterest in epistemology. One reason for this was the development of\nnew theories of mental representations and intentionality. Some of\nthese developments were due to problematic features of, on the one\nhand, Aquinas\u2019s view of mental representation and on the other,\nof Henry of Ghent\u2019s interpretation of Augustine\u2019s view of\ndivine cognition. Aquinas seems to have held that the intelligible\nspecies is supposed to play a dual role both as a universal common to\nall of us thinking it and as my individual thought. It is hard to see\nhow such a view can be maintained without the introduction of some\nkind of distinction. Henry on the other hand reinterprets\nAugustine\u2019s doctrine of divine ideas and introduces a\ndistinction between the ideas and the divine nature. The ideas are\npossibilia or the natures of possible things to be created (de Rijk\n2005: 81\u201384).\n\nBoth of these views contribute to the introduction of a distinction\nbetween the vehicle and the content of a representation. The\ndistinction developed by Henry in relation to the divine nature was\nalmost immediately taken up into the debates about human cognition. It\nwas applied to Aquinas\u2019s theory of mental representation, taking\nit a step further by introducing a distinction between the thing\nrepresenting and the thing represented. \n\nJohn Duns Scotus was instrumental in adapting this view to human\ncognition. Scotus\u2019s implemented Henry\u2019s distinction and\ntreated the thing that does the representing as a mental act or\nconcept, which ontologically speaking is an accident of the mind, and\nthe thing represented as the form of the object thought about. Scotus\nclaimed that the accident or mental act is subjectively in the soul,\nwhereas the object being represented is present objectively, or has\nobjective being in the mind. He also said that the object exists as\nrepresented to express the content side of the mental representation\n(Ord. I, d. 3, pars 3, q. 1, n. 382) Scouts can through this\ndistinction also maintain that all spiritual change supervenes on a\nreal change (see Cross 2014). \n\nScotus thus had a clear way of expressing what Brentano later called\nintentionality, that is, the way the object of thought exists in the\nmind. It has objective existence in the mind on his view, which later\ncame to be regarded as the mark of the mental (see Normore 1986;\nPasnau 2003; King 2007; Cross 2014). Although the advantages of this\napproach over Aquinas\u2019s are clear, problems remains concerning\nthe ontological status of these mental contents. The medieval debate\nhere is famous and features a wide variety of opinions (for a survey,\nsee Tachau 1988). Scotus himself says that thought objects have a\ndiminished kind of being, which is supposed to be a state between real\nbeing and no being at all. Although first accepting a similar view,\nOckham would later subject this view to much criticism.\n",
