    "main_text": "Beyond analogical arguments || Analogy and confirmation\n5.2 Conceptual change and theory development\n\nIn\n \u00a73.6,\n we saw that practice-based studies of analogy provide insight into\nthe criteria for evaluating analogical arguments. Such studies also\npoint to dynamical or programmatic roles for\nanalogies, which appear to require evaluative frameworks that go\nbeyond those developed for analogical arguments.\n\nKnuttila and Loettgers (2014) examine the role of analogical reasoning\nin synthetic biology, an interdisciplinary field that draws on\nphysics, chemistry, biology, engineering and computational science.\nThe main role for analogies in this field is not the construction of\nindividual analogical arguments but rather the development of concepts\nsuch as \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cfeedback loops\u201d. Such\nconcepts undergo constant refinement, guided by both positive and\nnegative analogies to their analogues in engineered and physical\nsystems. Analogical reasoning here is \u201ctransient, heterogeneous,\nand programmatic\u201d (87). Negative analogies, seen as problematic\nobstacles for individual analogical arguments, take on a prominent and\nconstructive role when the focus is theoretical construction and\nconcept refinement.\n\nSimilar observations apply to analogical reasoning in its application\nto another cutting-edge field: emergent gravity. In this area of\nphysics, distinct theoretical approaches portray gravity as emerging\nfrom different microstructures (Linneman and Visser 2018).\n\u201cNovel and robust\u201d features not present at the micro-level\nemerge in the gravitational theory. Analogies with other emergent\nphenomena, such as hydrodynamics and thermodynamics, are exploited to\nshape these proposals. As with synthetic biology, analogical reasoning\nis not directed primarily towards the formulation and assessment of\nindividual arguments. Rather, its role is to develop different\ntheoretical models of gravity.\n\nThese studies explore fluid and creative applications of analogy to\nshape concepts on the front lines of scientific research. An adequate\nanalysis would certainly take us beyond the analysis of individual\nanalogical arguments, which have been the focus of our attention.\nKnuttila and Loettgers (2014) are led to reject the idea that the\nindividual analogical argument is the \u201cprimary unit\u201d in\nanalogical reasoning, but this is a debatable conclusion. Linneman and\nVisser (2018), for instance, explicitly affirm the importance of\nassessing the case for different gravitational models through\n\u201cexemplary analogical arguments\u201d:\n\n\nWe have taken up the challenge of making explicit arguments in favour\nof an emergent gravity paradigm\u2026 That arguments can only be\nplausibility arguments at the heuristic level does not mean that they\nare immune to scrutiny and critical assessment tout court. The\nphilosopher of physics\u2019 job in the process of discovery of\nquantum gravity\u2026 should amount to providing exactly this kind\nof assessments. (Linneman and Visser 2018: 12)\n\n\nAccordingly, Linneman and Visser formulate explicit analogical\narguments for each model of emergent gravity, and assess them using\nfamiliar criteria for evaluating individual analogical arguments.\nArguably, even the most ambitious heuristic objectives still depend\nupon considerations of plausibility that benefit by being expressed,\nand examined, in terms of analogical arguments.\n",
