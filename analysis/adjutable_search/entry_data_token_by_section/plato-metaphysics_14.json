    "main_text": "The Method of Hypothesis\n15. The Method of Hypothesis\n\n\nHowever we account for the inadequacy of perception the task remains\nto explore how we get from perception, which stimulates the\nrecollective process, to belief and eventually to recollect or\notherwise know Forms. Plato is less than forthcoming about how one\nmoves from one stage to the next. The elenctic method probably plays\nsome role in advancing one's understanding, especially the step from\nperception to belief. At a certain point, we naturally begin to offer\nreasons for our beliefs. The elenchus questions our reasons, typically\nby revealing an inconsistency in our accounts of why we believe what we\ndo. But we can also place Plato in a tradition that seeks a systematic\nexplanation of the natural phenomena. One aim of the Presocratics, as\nSocrates narrates in the Phaedo (95a4ff), is to find a single\nexplanation, or a single kind of explanation, to save the phenomena.\nSocrates complains that the Presocratics had mistakenly looked to\nmaterial causes. Such explanations fail to meet minimal standards: the\nsame explanation (aitia) accounts for opposite phenomena,\ne.g., \u2018by a head\u2019 explains both why something is tall and\nsomething else is short; or sometimes the same phenomenon is subject to\nexplanations by opposite causes, being two by \u2018division and\naddition.\u2019 However, Socrates reports, Anaxagoras' nod towards\nMind was at least a step in the right direction (though Anaxagoras\nfailed to follow the path). The best account is teleological in nature,\nin terms of the Good. Thus the Phaedo gestures at the critical\nrole assigned to this Form in the Republic. In the\nPhaedo Plato begs off from directly investigating the nature\nof the good or teleological explanations. Instead he turns to what he\ndescribes as a method of hypothesis, the first of which is the\nhypothesis of Forms as causes (see $sect;2 supra), and its\n\u2018first corollary\u2019, that particulars are/come-to-be what\neach is in virtue of partaking in Forms.\n\n\nPrecisely what the connection is between the Phaedo's method\nof hypothesis (99eff) and the Republic's remarks on\nhypothesis and the ascent to an unhypothetical first principal is a\nsubject of controversy. Equally controversial is its connection within\nthe Phaedo to the method of recollection and to philosophical\npractice in general. In attempting to study what there is\n(onta), Socrates says that he shrinks from things\n(erga) to concentrate on propositions/accounts\n(logoi), which he denies are more images (of what there is)\nthan the physical things: \u201cI started in this manner: taking as\nmy hypothesis in each case the theory that seemed to me most\ncompelling, I would consider as true, about cause and everything else,\nwhatever agreed with this, and as untrue whatever did not\nagree.\u201d (99e-100a). Since the hypothesis of Forms is offered\nnext, with its corollary of participating particulars, it would seem\nthat the logoi are opinions about Forms. These logoi\nare to be treated as provisional. Socrates' is the\nstrongest logos and the safest, in explicit contrast to the\nwise explanations of others.  From the examples provided, it seems\nthat \u2018agreement\u2019 here is not a notion of entailment or\nlogical consequence. Rather, Plato directs us to posit initially a\ngeneral hypothesis and to determine whether there are particular cases\nwithin the target domain\u2014here the cause of generation and\ndestruction\u2014that are inconsistent with, i.e., not adequately\nexplained by, it (see Bedu-Addo 1991).\n\n\nComplicating matters is Plato's additional remark that one needs\nalso to examine the initial hypothesis to see whether there are\n\u2018higher\u2019 hypotheses that account for it:\nBut you would cling to the safety of your own hypothesis\nand give that answer. If someone then attacked your hypothesis itself,\nyou would ignore him and would not answer until you had examined\nwhether the consequences that follow from it agree with one another or\ncontradict one another. And when you must give an account of your\nhypothesis itself you will proceed in the same way: You assume another\nhypothesis, the one which seems to you best of the higher ones until\nyou come to something acceptable. (101d)\n\n\nSince the initial hypothesis is the theory of Forms, it is uncertain\nwhat Plato has in mind in mentioning hypotheses \u2018higher\u2019\nthan the theory or what sort of test he has in mind. The elenctic\npractice of Socrates would determine whether other accounts are\nconsistent with one another. But that still leaves the question of\nhigher hypotheses unanswered. One temptation here is to think that the\nteleological account of the Good is the higher/est hypothesis. While\nthis may well be so, there are perhaps intermediate accounts between\nthe full-blown teleology of the Good\u2014an account that Plato\nsteadfastly throughout his writings refuses to provide\u2014and the\ninitial statement of the theory of Forms and its corollary of\nparticipation (see Rowe 1993).  These intermediate stages might then\nbe viewed as different accounts of the nature of Forms, the nature of\nparticulars and of the participation relation itself. For instance,\nAristotle might offer a different account of \u2018Forms\u2019 than\nPlato, one that espouses an immanent realism wherein some particulars\nmight be said to have essential properties. Or, looking to the clever\nexplanations that follow, where perhaps Forms of Fire and Heat, Cold\nand Snow or Three and Odd are linked, one might ponder whether Forms\nare indeed utterly simple or monoeidetic, in contrast to an account of\nForms in which they may bear a special relation to their\nessence\u2014Three is what it is to be three\u2014and a different\nrelation to another property, e.g. oddness. Seen in this light, the\nTheory of Forms in the Phaedo (and Republic) is\nhypothetical or provisional, awaiting a defense in which the nature of\nForms, the role of the Good and the relations between Forms are\nexamined.\n\n\nWhen one turns from the Phaedo to the Republic,\nthe notion of hypothesis appears in the two \u2018upper\u2019\nsegments of the line. They are distinguished in part by the fact that\nthose considering their subject matter dianoetically still make use of\nhypotheses, whereas those using nous have arrived at an\nunhypothetical first principle and descending the line have destroyed\nthe hypotheses. It seems that the mathematicians, for example, use\ndiscursive thought because they assume the starting points, i.e., the\naxioms or definitions, of their sciences. In this respect, they are\nlike Socrates of the Phaedo positing the Forms to explain\ngeneration and corruption. In Plato's hands, scientific inquiry seems\nto emerge from reflection on the everyday material world. The step from\nconviction to dianoia, however, is taken by far fewer\nindividuals than those who step from eikasia to\nconviction.\n\n\nThe move from the second to the third level crosses the barrier\nbetween the visible and the intelligible. One derives \u2018images'\nfrom the objects of pistis or considers them differently,\ndeveloping different propositions about what one previously took for\ngranted. Perhaps the scientist describes these images in non-sensible\nterms, or perhaps he regards the \u2018image of triangle\u2019 apart\nfrom the particular, determinate angles or lengths that even any image\nmust have\u2014he abstracts away these features, treating the abstract\nimage as applying to all triangles. Or, similarly, the objects of\ndianoia and nous may be identical: the philosopher\nthinks about them differently from the scientist. If one assumes that\nhere Forms are first posited, as seems required if we are to understand\nthe descent from nous to secure the Forms, then the objects of\ndianoia and pistis cannot be the same. For the\nlatter are not Forms but ordinary particulars. We can then explain\n\u2018destroying the hypotheses\u2019 as similar to what, in the\nPhaedo, was described as finding the higher logoi.\nThe initial strongest hypothesis, i.e., the Theory of Forms, is then\nrendered non-hypothetical when, and only when, the philosopher has\ndetermined which of the many accounts of the general nature of\nForms, e.g., immanent vs. transcendent realism, simple versus complex\nForms, the nature of the Good and its relation to others forms, is\nbest. The same route would secure the hypotheses of the sciences, i.e.,\nthe various interpretations of the objects of the sciences would be\neliminated leaving only that one justified by the theory of Forms. The\npeculiar properties or axioms of the individual sciences would remain\nthe provenance of the scientists. Dialectic or understanding would\nconcern how we are to think about the nature of those properties and\nthe structure of the sciences.\n",
