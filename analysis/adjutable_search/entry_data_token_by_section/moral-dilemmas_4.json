And the inconsistency in the second\nargument can be averted if one gives up either the principle that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 or the agglomeration\nprinciple. There is, of course, another way to avoid these\ninconsistencies: deny the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas. It is\nfair to say that much of the debate concerning moral dilemmas in the\nlast sixty years has been about how to avoid the inconsistencies\ngenerated by the two arguments above.\n\nOpponents of moral dilemmas have generally held that the crucial\nprinciples in the two arguments above are conceptually true, and\ntherefore we must deny the possibility of genuine dilemmas. (See, for\nexample, Conee 1982 and Zimmerman 1996.) Most of the debate, from all\nsides, has focused on the second argument. There is an oddity about\nthis, however. When one examines the pertinent principles in each\nargument which, in combination with dilemmas, generates an\ninconsistency, there is little doubt that those in the first argument\nhave a greater claim to being conceptually true than those in the\nsecond. (One who recognizes the salience of the first argument is\nBrink 1994, section V.) Perhaps the focus on the second argument is\ndue to the impact of Bernard Williams\u2019s influential essay\n(Williams 1965). But notice that the first argument shows that if\nthere are genuine dilemmas, then either PC or PD must be relinquished.\nEven most supporters of dilemmas acknowledge that PC is quite basic.\nE.J. Lemmon, for example, notes that if PC does not hold in a system\nof deontic logic, then all that remains are truisms and paradoxes\n(Lemmon 1965, p. 51). And giving up PC also requires denying either OP\nor D, each of which also seems basic. There has been much debate about\nPD\u2014in particular, questions generated by the Good Samaritan\nparadox\u2014but still it seems basic. So those who want to argue\nagainst dilemmas purely on conceptual grounds are better off focusing\non the first of the two arguments above.\n\nSome opponents of dilemmas also hold that the pertinent principles in\nthe second argument\u2014the principle that \u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019 and the agglomeration principle\u2014are\nconceptually true. But foes of dilemmas need not say this. Even if\nthey believe that a conceptual argument against dilemmas can be made\nby appealing to PC and PD, they have several options regarding the\nsecond argument. They may defend \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019, but hold that it is a substantive normative\nprinciple, not a conceptual truth. Or they may even deny the truth of\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 or the agglomeration\nprinciple, though not because of moral dilemmas, of course.\n\nDefenders of dilemmas need not deny all of the pertinent principles.\nIf one thinks that each of the principles at least has some initial\nplausibility, then one will be inclined to retain as many as possible.\nAmong the earlier contributors to this debate, some took the existence\nof dilemmas as a counterexample to \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019 (for example, Lemmon 1962 and Trigg 1971); others,\nas a refutation of the agglomeration principle (for example, Williams\n1965 and van Fraassen 1973). A common response to the first argument\nis to deny PD. A more complicated response is to grant that the\ncrucial deontic principles hold, but only in ideal worlds. In the real\nworld, they have heuristic value, bidding agents in conflict cases to\nlook for permissible options, though none may exist (Holbo 2002,\nespecially sections 15\u201317).\n\nFriends and foes of dilemmas have a burden to bear in responding to\nthe two arguments above. For there is at least a prima facie\nplausibility to the claim that there are moral dilemmas and to the\nclaim that the relevant principles in the two arguments are true. Thus\neach side must at least give reasons for denying the pertinent claims\nin question. Opponents of dilemmas must say something in response to\nthe positive arguments that are given for the reality of such\nconflicts. One reason in support of dilemmas, as noted above, is\nsimply pointing to examples. The case of Sartre\u2019s student and\nthat from Sophie\u2019s Choice are good ones; and clearly\nthese can be multiplied indefinitely. It will tempting for supporters\nof dilemmas to say to opponents, \u201cIf this is not a real dilemma,\nthen tell me what the agent ought to do and\nwhy?\u201d It is obvious, however, that attempting to answer\nsuch questions is fruitless, and for at least two reasons. First, any\nanswer given to the question is likely to be controversial, certainly\nnot always convincing. And second, this is a game that will never end;\nexample after example can be produced. The more appropriate response\non the part of foes of dilemmas is to deny that they need to answer\nthe question. Examples as such cannot establish the reality of\ndilemmas. Surely most will acknowledge that there are situations in\nwhich an agent does not know what he ought to do. This may be because\nof factual uncertainty, uncertainty about the consequences,\nuncertainty about what principles apply, or a host of other things. So\nfor any given case, the mere fact that one does not know which of two\n(or more) conflicting obligations prevails does not show that none\ndoes.\n\nAnother reason in support of dilemmas to which opponents must respond\nis the point about symmetry. As the cases from Plato and Sartre show,\nmoral rules can conflict. But opponents of dilemmas can argue that in\nsuch cases one rule overrides the other. Most will grant this in the\nPlatonic case, and opponents of dilemmas will try to extend this point\nto all cases. But the hardest case for opponents is the symmetrical\none, where the same precept generates the conflicting requirements.\nThe case from Sophie\u2019s Choice is of this sort. It makes\nno sense to say that a rule or principle overrides itself. So what do\nopponents of dilemmas say here? They are apt to argue that the\npertinent, all-things-considered requirement in such a case is\ndisjunctive: Sophie should act to save one or the other of her\nchildren, since that is the best that she can do (for example,\nZimmerman 1996, Chapter 7). Such a move need not be ad hoc,\nsince in many cases it is quite natural. If an agent can afford to\nmake a meaningful contribution to only one charity, the fact that\nthere are several worthwhile candidates does not prompt many to say\nthat the agent will fail morally no matter what he does. Nearly all of\nus think that he should give to one or the other of the worthy\ncandidates. Similarly, if two people are drowning and an agent is\nsituated so that she can save either of the two but only one, few say\nthat she is doing wrong no matter which person she saves. Positing a\ndisjunctive requirement in these cases seems perfectly natural, and so\nsuch a move is available to opponents of dilemmas as a response to\nsymmetrical cases.\n\nSupporters of dilemmas have a burden to bear too. They need to cast\ndoubt on the adequacy of the pertinent principles in the two arguments\nthat generate inconsistencies. And most importantly, they need to\nprovide independent reasons for doubting whichever of the principles\nthey reject. If they have no reason other than cases of putative\ndilemmas for denying the principles in question, then we have a mere\nstandoff. Of the principles in question, the most commonly questioned\non independent grounds are the principle that \u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019 and PD. Among supporters of dilemmas, Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapters 4 and 5) has gone\nto the greatest lengths to provide independent reasons for questioning\nsome of the relevant principles.\n",
