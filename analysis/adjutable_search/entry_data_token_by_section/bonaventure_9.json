    "main_text": "Physical Creation || Sense Cognition\n3.7 Sense Cognition\n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the\nmeans for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things.\nFurthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher\nthings.\n\nPhysical things considered in their own right evidence \u201cweight,\nnumber, and measure\u201d (Psalm 83:8), thereby causing us to\ncontemplate their own measure, beauty, and order. These features are\ngrounded in the activities and natural powers of sensible substances.\nThe nature of sensible substances accordingly expresses in their\nactions and interactions the measure, beauty, and order of their\norigin and thereby attest to the power, wisdom, and goodness of the\nSource from which they spring (Journey cap. I, n. 11\n[Quaracchi V: 298b]). Likewise, the origin, size, number, beauty,\nfullness, function, and origin of physical things point to the Divine\nSource and its essential properties of power, wisdom, and goodness\n(Journey cap. I, n. 14 [Quaracchi V: 299a\u2013b]).\n\nThe pointing of physical things towards their Source finds its\nparallel in sense cognition itself, which also points towards that\nsame Source. Drawing his point of departure from the Neoplatonic theme\nof macrocosm and microcosm, Bonaventure discovers an analogy between\nAristotelian cosmology and the process of sensation. Each sensible\nobject generates a likeness of itself in the medium through which it\nis perceived, and that likeness in turn generates another likeness\nsuccessively in the sense organ, causing the sense power to apprehend\nthe sensible object. The process so described reflects the process of\nthe emanation of forms from the heavenly bodies and also the manner in\nwhich creatures, going forth from their Principle, return to their\nSource through the exercise of their natural activities. A similar\npattern emerges within the different acts exercised by each sense\npower: the sense apprehends (apprehensio) the object,\ndelights (delectatio) in its object, provided that the object\ndoes not exceed the natural limits of the organ, and judges\n(diiudicatio) or discriminates the quality of its object.\nThis last act, found in both the external senses and the internal\nsenses, takes on a special role for Bonaventure. Such a sense\njudgement, through comparative awareness, detaches the object from a\ngiven place and time, thereby preparing the way within the realm of\nsense cognition for intellectual cognition (Journey cap. II,\nn. 6 [Quaracchi V: 301a]).\n",
