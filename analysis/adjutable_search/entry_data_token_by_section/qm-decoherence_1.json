    "main_text": "Theory of Decoherence || Environmental decoherence\n1.1 Environmental decoherence\n\n\u2018Environmental\u2019 decoherence is decoherence that arises\nthrough suitable interaction of a system with its environment. The\nstudy of environmental decoherence consists to a large extent in the\nconstruction and investigation of concrete models of such\ninteractions. We have already mentioned taking an environment of\nrelatively light particles that scatter off a relatively heavy\nparticle. Such a model can be used to study e.g. chiral molecules. Or\none can take an atom in interaction with the electromagnetic field, or\na harmonic oscillator in a thermal bath of oscillators, and many more.\nVarious features of interest typically arise in such models: some are\nin common to most models, others are highly model-dependent.\n\nOne feature of these environmental interactions is that they suppress\ninterference between states from some preferred set\n(\u2018eigenstates of the decohering variable\u2019). This can be a\ndiscrete set of states, e.g. the upper and lower component of the wave\nfunction in our simple example of the two-slit experiment, or left-\nand right-handed states in models of chiral molecules; when an atom\ninteracts with the electromagnetic field, the preferred states will be\nthe stationary states (which are the states we observe in\nspectroscopy). Or it could be some continuous set, e.g. the\n\u2018coherent states\u2019 of a harmonic oscillator (in which case\nthe terminology of \u2018eigenstates\u2019 or\n\u2018eigenbasis\u2019 of a preferred observable is not quite\naccurate). The intuitive picture is one in which the environment\nmonitors the system of interest by spontanesouly and continuously\n\u2018measuring\u2019 some quantity characterised by the set of\npreferred states (i.e. the environment interacts with the system in\nsuch a way that it could in principle be used as a measuring\napparatus).\n\nSuch a \u2018measurement-like\u2019 interaction intuitively does not\ndisturb the eigenstates of the monitored observable. Thus these\npreferred states can in fact be characterised in terms of their\nrobustness or stability with respect to the interaction with the\nenvironment. The system gets entangled with the environment, but the\nstates between which interference is suppressed are the ones that\nwould themselves get least entangled with the environment\nunder this interaction. In this connection, one also says that\ndecoherence induces \u2018effective superselection rules\u2019,\nmeaning the following. A strict superselection rule applies when there\nare some observables \u2013 in technical terminology they are called\nclassical \u2013 that commute with all observables (for a review, see\nWightman 1995). Intuitively, these observables are infinitely robust,\nsince no possible interaction can disturb them (at least as long as\nthe interaction Hamiltonian is considered to be an observable). By an\neffective superselection rule one means, analogously, that\ncertain observables (e.g. chirality) will not be disturbed by the\ninteractions that actually take place.\n\nIn many models of decoherence, the preferred states are robust in an\neven stronger sense, because information about them is stored in a\nredundant way in the environment (say, because a Schr\u00f6dinger cat\nhas interacted with so many stray particles: photons, air molecules,\ndust). This information can later be acquired by an observer without\nfurther disturbing the system (we observe \u2013 however that may be\ninterpreted \u2013 whether the cat is alive or dead by intercepting\non our retina a small fraction of the light that has interacted with\nthe cat). \n\nWhat states are preferred will depend on the details of the\ninteraction, but in many cases, interactions are characterised by\npotentials that are functions of position, so preferred states are\noften related to position. For the chiral molecule, the left- and\nright-handed states are indeed characterised by different spatial\nconfigurations of the atoms in the molecule. For the harmonic\noscillator, one should think of the environment\n\u2018measuring\u2019 approximate eigenstates of position, or rather\napproximate joint eigenstates of position and momentum, so-called\ncoherent states (since information about the time of flight is also\nrecorded in the environment). \n\nThe resulting localisation can be on a very short length scale, i.e.\nthe characteristic length above which coherence is dispersed\n(\u2018coherence length\u2019) can be very short. A speck of dust of\nradius \\(a = 10^{-5}\\)cm floating in the air will have\ninterference suppressed between spatially localised components with a\nwidth of \\(10^{-13}\\)cm. Even more strikingly, the time scales for\nthis process are often minute. This coherence length is reached after\na microsecond of exposure to air, and suppression of interference on a\nlength scale of \\(10^{-12}\\)cm is achieved already after a\n nanosecond.[5]\n\n\nWithin the environmental decoherence literature, models tend to be\nformulated in terms of master equations for the evolution of the\ndensity operator describing the system. As a consequence of\ndecoherence this very quickly becomes (at least approximately)\ndiagonal in the basis of preferred states (whether discrete or\ncontinuous). Thus, the master equation for the density operator for\nthe system is essentially equivalent to an evolution equation for the\nprobability distribution over the preferred states. In models\nwhere coherent states are preferred, one can then compare this to the\nLiouville evolution of probability distributions over classical phase\nspace, and in fact one obtains extremely good quantitative agreement.\n\n\nThese features are not claimed to obtain in all cases of interaction\nwith some environment. It is a matter of detailed physical\ninvestigation to assess which systems exhibit which features, and how\ngeneral the lessons are that we might learn from studying specific\nmodels. One should thus beware of common overgeneralisations. For\ninstance, decoherence does not affect only and all\n\u2018macroscopic systems\u2019. It is true that middle-sized\nobjects, say, on the Earth\u2019s surface will be very effectively\ndecohered by the air in the atmosphere, and this is an excellent\nexample of decoherence at work. On the other hand, there are also very\ngood examples of decoherence-like interactions affecting microscopic\nsystems, such as in the interaction of \\(\\alpha\\)-particles with the gas\nin a bubble chamber. (Note, however, that this also relies on the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles being emitted in states that are superpositions of\nstrongly outward directed wavepackets.) Further, there are arguably\nmacroscopic systems for which interference effects are not suppressed.\nFor instance, it has been shown to be possible to sufficiently shield\nSQUIDS (a type of superconducting devices) from decoherence for the\npurpose of observing superpositions of different macroscopic currents\n\u2013 contrary to what one had expected (see e.g. Leggett 1984, and\nesp. 2002, Section 5.4). Anglin, Paz and Zurek (1997) examine some\nless well-behaved models of environmental decoherence and provide a\nuseful corrective as to its scope.\n",
