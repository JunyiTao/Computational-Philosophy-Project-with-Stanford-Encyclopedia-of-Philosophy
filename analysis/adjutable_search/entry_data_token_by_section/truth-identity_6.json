    "main_text": "Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions || The \u201cslingshot\u201d problem\n5.3 The \u201cslingshot\u201d problem\n\nIf the notorious \u201cslingshot\u201d argument worked, it would\npose a problem for the identity theory of truth. The argument exists\nin a number of different, though related, forms, and this is not the\nplace to explore all of these in\n detail.[14]\n Here we shall look briefly at what is one of the simplest and most\nfamiliar versions of the argument, namely Davidson\u2019s. This\nversion of the argument aims to show that if true declarative\nsentences refer to anything (for example to propositions or facts),\nthen they all refer to the same thing (to the \u201cGreat\nProposition\u201d, or to the \u201cGreat Fact\u201d). This upshot\nwould be unacceptable to an identity theorist of a Russellian cast,\nwho thinks that declarative sentences refer to propositions, and that\ntrue such propositions are identical with facts: any such theorist is\nnaturally going to want to insist that the propositions referred to by\ndifferent declarative sentences are, at least in general, distinct\nfrom one another, and likewise that the facts with which distinct true\npropositions are identical are also distinct from one another.\nDavidson expresses the problem that the slingshot argument purportedly\nthrows up as follows:\n\n\nThe difficulty follows upon making two reasonable assumptions: that\nlogically equivalent singular terms have the same reference; and that\na singular term does not change its reference if a contained singular\nterm is replaced by another with the same reference. But now suppose\nthat \u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d abbreviate any\ntwo sentences alike in truth value. (1984: 19)\n\n\nHe then argues that the following four sentences have the same\nreference:\n\n(13)\n \\(R\\)\n\n\n(14)\n \\(\\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\amp R) = \\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z)\\)\n\n\n(15)\n \\(\\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\amp S) = \\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\))\n\n\n(16)\n \\(S\\)\n\n\n(The hat over a variable symbolizes the description operator: so\n\u201c\\(\\hat{z}\\)\u201d means the \\(z\\) such that \u2026)\nThis is because (13) and (14) are logically equivalent, as are (15)\nand (16), while the only difference between (14) and (15) is that (14)\ncontains the expression (Davidson calls it a \u201csingular\nterm\u201d) \u201c\\(\\hat{z} (z\\! =\\! z \\amp R)\\)\u201d whereas (15)\ncontains \u201c\\(\\hat{z} (z\\! =\\! z \\amp S)\\)\u201d,\n\n\nand these refer to the same thing if S and R are alike\nin truth value. Hence any two sentences have the same reference if\nthey have the same truth value. (1984: 19)\n\n\nThe difficulty with this argument, as a number of writers have pointed\nout (see, e.g., Yourgrau 1987; Gaskin 1997: 153 n. 17; K\u00fcnne\n2003: 133\u201341), and the place where the identity theorist is\nlikely to raise a cavil, lies in the first assumption on which it\ndepends. Davidson calls this assumption \u201creasonable\u201d, but\nit has been widely questioned. It states \u201cthat logically\nequivalent singular terms have the same reference\u201d. But\nintuitively, the ideas of logical equivalence and reference seem to be\nquite distinct, indeed to have, as such, little to do with one\nanother, so that it would be odd if there were some a priori\nreason why the assumption had to hold. And it is not difficult to\nthink of apparent counterexamples: the sentence \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d is logically equivalent to the sentence \u201cIt is\nraining and (either Pluto is larger than Mercury or it is not the case\nthat Pluto is larger than Mercury)\u201d, but the latter sentence\nseems to carry a referential payload that the former does not. Of\ncourse, if declarative sentences refer to truth-values, as Frege\nthought, then the two sentences will indeed be co-referential, but to\nassume that sentences refer to truth-values would be question-begging\nin the context of an argument designed to establish that all true\nsentences refer to the same thing.\n",
