    "main_text": "Mystical Experiences\n1. Mystical Experiences\n\nBecause of its variable meanings, a definition of \u201cmystical\nexperience\u201d must be partly stipulative. It is common among\nphilosophers to refer to \u201cmystical experience\u201d in a\nnarrow sense: a purportedly nonsensory or\nextrovertive unitive experience by a subject of an\nobject granting acquaintance of realities or states of affairs that\nare of a kind not accessible by way of sense-perception, somatosensory\nmodalities, or standard introspection. A unitive experience\ninvolves the eradication of a sense of multiple discrete entities,\nand the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie\nprecisely in that phenomenological feature. Examples are experiences\nof \u201cunion with God,\u201d the realization that one is identical to the\nbeing shared with God or that one is identical to the\nBrahman of Advaita Vedanta (i.e., that the self/soul is identical\nwith the one eternal, absolute reality), experiencing a oneness\nto all of nature, and the Buddhist unconstructed extrovertive\nexperience devoid of a sense of any multiplicity of\nrealities (see Smart 1958, 1978; Wainwright 1981, chap. 1).\nHowever, as discussed in Section 2.2.1, few classical\nmystics refer to their experiences as the union of\ntwo realities: there is no literal \u201cmerging\u201d or\n\u201cabsorption\u201d of one reality into another resulting in only\none entity. Excluded from the narrow definition are, for example,\nexperiences of \u201ccontact\u201d with God in which the subject and\nGod remain ontologically distinct, even if there is a lessening of\nboundaries, or a Jewish Kabbalistic experience of a single\nsupernal sefirah.\n\nA more inclusive definition of \u201cmystical experience\u201d is:\n\nA purportedly nonsensory awareness or a nonstructured\nsensory experience granting acquaintance of realities or states\nof affairs that are of a kind not accessible by way of ordinary\nsense-perception structured by mental conceptions, somatosensory\nmodalities, or standard introspection.\n\n\n\u201cExperience,\u201d \u201cconsciousness,\u201d and \u201cawareness\u201d are\nnotoriously difficult to define and will be left unanalyzed here, but\nthe other key terms in the definition can be understood as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\u201cPurportedly\u201d allows the definition to be accepted without\nnecessarily accepting that mystics ever really do experience realities\nor states of affairs in the way they described. \n\n\n\u201cNonsenory awareness\u201d includes content of a kind not appropriate\nto sense-perception, somatosensory modalities (including the means for\nsensing pain and body temperature, and internally sensing body, limb,\norgan, and visceral positions and states), or standard introspection.\nSome mystics have referred to a distinct \u201cspiritual\u201d means of\nknowing appropriate only to a non-physical realm (nous,\nintellectus, buddhi). A super sense-perceptual mode\nof experience may accompany sense-perception as in the cases of\n\u201cnature mysticism\u201d or \u201ccosmic consciousness\u201d (Bucke 1901),\nas when, for example, a person has an awareness of God while\nwatching a setting sun. \n\n\n\u201cNonstructured sensory experience\u201d consists of phenomenological\nsensory content but lacks the conceptualization normally\nstructuring sense-perception. \n\n\n\u201cAcquaintance\u201d of realities in mystical experiences means the\nsubject is putatively aware of one or\nmore realities in a way that overcomes the normal subject/object\nduality: the \u201cacquaintance\u201d is \u201cknowledge by\nparticipation\u201d or \u201cknowledge by identity\u201d (Forman 1990,\nIntroduction). Mystical experiences are allegedly\n\u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cunmediated\u201d insights in that sense. \n\n\n\u201cStates of affairs\u201d include the impermanence of all reality and\nthat God is the ground of the self. \u201cAcquaintance\u201d of states of\naffairs comes in two forms. In one, a subject is aware of either\n(one or more) realities on which (one or more) states of affairs\nsupervene. An example would be an awareness of God (a reality)\naffording an awareness of one\u2019s utter dependence on God (a state\nof affairs). In its second form, acquaintance of states of affairs\ninvolves an insight directly, without supervening on acquaintance, of\nany reality. An example is coming to \u201csee\u201d the\nimpermanence of all that exists in the phenomenal world. \n\n\nHereafter \u201cmystical experience\u201d will be used in the broader\nsense, unless otherwise noted, not merely for unitive\nexperiences. Correspondingly, the term \u201cmysticism\u201d will refer to\npractices, discourse, texts, institutions, and traditions associated\nwith these experiences. The definition excludes paranormal\nexperiences such as visions, voices, out-of-body experiences,\nand powers such as telepathy. All of these are\n\u201cdualistic\u201d acquaintance of subjects with objects or qualities of\na kind accessible to the senses or to ordinary introspection.\n\nThe subject may not have the mental separation at the time of the\nexperience by which she could tell herself, as it were, what\nrealities or state of affairs were then being disclosed to her. The\nrealization may arise following the experience.\n\nMystical experiences occur within all world religions and\nprobably all primal religions. In some traditions, the experiences are\nallegedly of a supersensory reality, such as God or Brahman. Many\nBuddhist traditions, however, make no claim for an experience of a\nsupersensory reality but instead cultivate an experience of\n\u201cunconstructed awareness\u201d involving an awareness of the world on\na completely or partially non-conceptual level (see\nGriffiths 1993). The non-conceptual experience is thought to\ngrant knowledge of the true nature of phenomenal reality, such\nas the impermanent nature of all things. Prajnaparamita and\nMadhyamaka Buddhists refer to this as the experience of the\n\u201cthusness\u201d (tathata) or\n\u201cthatness\u201d (tattva) of reality that\nis accessible only in the absence of ordinary\nsense-perceptual cognition that is structured by cultural\nconceptions.\n\nIt should be emphasized that mystics value achieving enduring\nstates of consciousness over\ntransient experiences \u2014 in particular, they value\nthe personal transformation leading to the enlightened state free of a\nsense of a phenomenal \u201cself\u201d in which they are aligned with the way\nthings really are (as defined by their tradition). Mysticism is a\nmatter of practices and ways of life, not episodic experiences.\n\nCare should also be taken not to confuse \u201cmystical experience\u201d with\n\u201creligious experience.\u201d The latter refers to any experience\nhaving significance appropriate to a religious context. This includes\nmany instances of mystical experiences but also religious visions\nand voices, and various religious feelings, such as religious awe\nand sublimity. Also included is what Friedrich Schleiermacher\nidentified as the fundamental religious experience: the feeling of\n\u201cabsolute dependence\u201d (Schleiermacher 1963). Rudolf\nOtto reserved the term \u201cnuminous\u201d (from Latin \u201cnumen\u201d\nmeaning \u201cdivine\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d) for experiences allegedly of a reality\nperceived of as \u201cwholly other\u201d than the subject, producing a\nreaction of dread and fascination before an incomprehensible mystery\n(Otto 1957). In the sense of \u201cmystical\u201d used here,\nOtto\u2019s numinous experience is a dualistic experience\nand not thus mystical. Your garden-variety sense of God\u2019s\n\u201cpresence\u201d would count as a numinous experience. A\n\u201csecular\u201d mysticism is also possible (see Section 12). \n",
