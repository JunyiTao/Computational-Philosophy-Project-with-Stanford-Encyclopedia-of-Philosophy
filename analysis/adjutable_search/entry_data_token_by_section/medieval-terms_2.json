    "main_text": "Supposition and Copulation\n3. Supposition and Copulation\n\nJust as signification corresponds most closely \u2013 though not\nexactly \u2013 to contemporary ideas of meaning or sense, so\nsupposition corresponds in some ways to modern notions of reference,\ndenotation and extension. The comparison is far from exact, however.\nOne major difference is that the medievals distinguished many\ndifferent modes (modi) of supposition. Despite the difference\nbetween different authors\u2019 semantic theories, particularly as\nthey developed over the centuries, there is a remarkable consistency\nin the terminology and interrelation of the different modes.\n\nThe major division is between material, simple and personal\nsupposition. Material supposition is when a term stands for a\nlinguistic item as such. Often, of course, this will be a case of\nautonymy, when it stands for itself. William Sherwood writes:\n\u201cIt is called material when a word itself supposits either [A]\nfor the very utterance itself or [B] for the word itself, composed of\nthe utterance and the signification \u2013 as if we were to say [A]\n\u2018man is a monosyllable\u2019 or [B] \u2018man is a\nname\u2019\u201d (tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 107).[14]\n Writing in Paris nearly a hundred years later, Thomas Maulfelt put it\nlike this: \u201cMaterial supposition is a term standing for itself\nor for another similar to it in sound or writing suppositing in the\nsame way or otherwise which it was not imposed to signify or for some\nother sound which is not inferior to it, and which it does not signify\nnaturally and properly\u201d (my\n translation).[15]\n \u2018Noun\u2019 supposits materially for itself when we say\n\u2018Noun has four letters\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018The term\n\u201cnoun\u201d has four letters\u2019; it doesn\u2019t supposit\nmaterially, but personally for itself, when we say \u2018A noun is a\npart of speech\u2019.\n\nSimple and personal supposition are sometimes grouped together as\n\u201cformal supposition\u201d (in contrast to material). Simple\nsupposition is harder to characterize generally. A common description\nis to say it occurs when a term supposits for the universal or form\nwhich it signifies. However, not everyone believed that terms\nsignified universals. (See the entry on the\n Medieval Problem of Universals.)\n So whereas William of Sherwood wrote \u201cIt is simple when a word\nsupposits what it signifies for what it signifies\u201d (tr.\nKretzmann p.\n 107),[16]\n and Walter Burley likewise: \u201csupposition is simple when a\ncommon term or an aggregated singular term supposits for what it\nsignifies\u201d (tr. Spade p.\n 82),[17]\n William of Ockham appears to characterize simple supposition quite\ndifferently: \u201cSimple supposition occurs when a term supposits\nfor an intention of the soul and is not functioning\nsignificatively\u201d (tr. Loux p.\n 190).[18]\n But in fact, the difference between them is not in their theories of\nsupposition, but rather of signification. As we noted earlier, Ockham\nbelieves that a general term like \u2018man\u2019 signifies\nindividual men like Plato and Socrates; Burley that it signifies a\nsecond substance (the universal), man. Burley appeals to the authority\nof Aristotle: \u201c\u2018man\u2019 is the name of a second\nsubstance; therefore, the term \u2018man\u2019 signifies a second\nsubstance. And it does not signify a second substance that is a genus.\nTherefore, it signifies a species\u201d (De Puritate, tr.\nSpade p.\n 87).[19]\n Ockham, as a nominalist, however, dismissed real universals, and (at\nleast in his later theory represented in Summa Logicae)\nbelieved the only universals were words, including words of the inner\nmental language, mental acts. So for him, a spoken or written term has\nsimple supposition when it stands non-significatively for the mental\nact to which it is subordinated by the conventions of signification,\nthat is, the mental act and its natural signification abstracted from\nthose things which the word conventionally signifies.\n\nJohn Buridan (Summulae, tr. Klima, sec 4.3.2, p. 253)\nfamously eliminated simple supposition altogether, for this very\nreason, namely, that universals are words of a mental language, so\nterms suppositing for them are suppositing for a kind of linguistic\nitem, and so such a case should be included under material\nsupposition.\n\nMaterial and simple supposition are contrasted with personal\nsupposition, what we might call the standard case, where a term stands\nfor ordinary objects \u2013 the objects it signifies (for Ockhamists)\nor what fall under the universal or form that the term signifies, as\nfor example, Lambert (ed. Alessio, p. 209; tr. Maloney, p. 259) or\nBurley express it: \u201cSupposition is personal when a term\nsupposits for its suppositum or supposita or some singular of which\nthe term is accidentally predicated\u201d (tr. Spade p.\n 81).[20]\n The contrast is a useful one, as is shown in the following standard\nfallacies:\n\n\n\nHomo est dignissima creaturarum\n(Man is the worthiest of creatures) \n\nSortes est homo\n(Socrates is a man) \n\nErgo Sortes est dignissima creaturarum\n(So Socrates is the worthiest of creatures).  \n\n\nThe premises are true and the conclusion false, so wherein lies the\nfallacy? It is one of equivocation or \u201cfour terms\u201d:\n\u2018homo\u2019 (\u2018man\u2019) has simple supposition in the\nfirst premise and personal supposition in the second, so there is no\nunambiguous middle term to unite the premises. Again:\n\n\n\nCurrens est participium\n(Running is a participle) \n\nSortes est currens\n(Socrates is running) \n\nErgo Sortes est participium\n(So Socrates is a participle).  \n\n\nThis time, \u2018currens\u2019 (\u2018running\u2019) supposits\ndifferently in the two premises, materially in the first and\npersonally in the second, explaining why putting the two truths\ntogether fallaciously leads to the false conclusion. In earlier times,\nthese would have been called fallacies of univocation since what\nvaries is the supposition, not the signification, of \u2018man\u2019\nand\n \u2018running\u2019.[21]\n\nWhat determines whether a term has material, simple or personal\nsupposition? One view might be that it depends on the intention of the\nspeaker; another, that all propositions are ambiguous and the term can\nbe taken either way. However, the prevailing medieval view was that it\nwas determined by the predicate, so that, e.g., a predicate like\n\u2018is a noun\u2019 enforces material supposition for the subject,\nwhile \u2018is a species\u2019 requires simple supposition: \u201cA\nsubject, on the other hand, sometimes supposits a form separately and\nsometimes does not, depending on what the predicate demands, in\naccordance with the following [principle]: Subjects are of such sorts\nas the predicates may have allowed\u201d (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 113).[22]\n This slogan, talia subiecta qualia predicata permiserint\n(subjects are such as predicates permit), was commonly attributed to\nBoethius; but Sherwood correctly points out that Boethius\u2019 point\nwas different, and his phrase was the converse: \u201ctalia\n[predicata] qualia subiecta permiserint\u201d \u2013 see De\nRijk, Logica Modernorum II (1), p. 561.\n\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it became commonplace to\nrequire a nota materialitatis (a sign of the material use)\nfor a term in material supposition. Such a sign was to prefix\n\u2018iste terminus\u2019 (\u2018this term\u2019) or\n\u2018ly\u2019 (taken from the French definite article) to the term.\nWithout such an indication, the term was considered to have personal\nsupposition by\n default.[23]\n The use of inverted commas is a much later innovation, though some\nscribes indicate material supposition (or quotation) by surrounding\nthe term or phrase with a pair of dots (puncta).\n\nPersonal supposition is divided by most authors into discrete and\ncommon supposition, the first that of singular terms (proper names,\ndemonstrative phrases and so on), the latter that of general terms.\nCommon personal supposition is again divided, namely, into determinate\nand confused, and the latter into confused and distributive and merely\nconfused supposition. These three modes are well illustrated by the\nfour categorical forms (see the entry on the\n  Traditional Square of Opposition):\n\n\n(A) All A are B.\n\n(E) No A are B.\n\n(I) Some A are B.\n\n(O) Some A are not B.\n\n\nThe subject of (I)- and (O)-, and the predicate of (I)-propositions,\nhave determinate supposition; the subject and predicate of (E)-, the\nsubject of (A)-, and the predicate of (O)-propositions have confused\nand distributive supposition; and the predicate of (A)-propositions\nhas merely confused supposition. This is common doctrine; what varies\nis how these modes are characterised. \u201cIt is determinate\u201d,\nwrites William of Sherwood, \u201cwhen the locution can be expounded\nby means of some single thing\u201d (tr. Kretzmann, p. 108), but he\naddresses a doubt: \u201cIt seems that when I say \u2018a man is\nrunning\u2019 [i.e. an I-proposition] the term \u2018man\u2019 does\nnot supposit determinately, since [A] the proposition is indefinite,\nand [B] it is uncertain for whom the term \u2018man\u2019 supposits.\nTherefore it supposits [A] indefinitely and [B] uncertainly; therefore\nindeterminately\u201d (pp.\n 115\u20136).[24]\n But this is simply a matter of terminology, he replies \u2013\ndeterminate supposition means suppositing for one, not for many, but\nfor no particular one, for that would constitute discrete supposition.\nNote, however, that for Ockham, Burley and others, a term with\ndeterminate supposition supposits for everything of which it can be\ntruly predicated. The sense in which it is true of one, rather than\nmany, is that the proposition is true if true of one. The term still\nsupposits for all. As Burley says: \u201cThe supposition is called\n\u2018determinate\u2019, not because a term suppositing\ndeterminately in this way supposits for one suppositum and not for\nanother. Rather the supposition is called \u2018determinate\u2019\nbecause for the truth of a proposition in which the common term\nsupposits determinately it is required that the proposition be made\ntrue for some determinate suppositum\u201d (tr. Spade pp.\n 102\u20133).[25]\n\nAll that William of Sherwood can offer to characterize confused\nsupposition is to say that it is had when a term supposits for many,\nthen resorting to examples for its divisions. Peter of Spain tries\nharder: \u201cConfused supposition is taking a common term in place\nof many by means of a universal sign\u201d (tr. Copenhaver, p.\n 249),[26]\n and confused and distributive when it supposits for all. But this is\nstill unclear, and eventually a solution was found in the doctrine of\nascent and descent. Call the individual things falling under a general\nterm its \u201cinferiors\u201d, and call the singular proposition\nresulting from a general proposition by replacing a general term (with\nits qualifier) by a term with discrete supposition for one of its\ninferiors, one of the proposition\u2019s \u201csingulars\u201d.\nThen the inference from a general proposition to one of its singulars\nis called \u201cdescent\u201d, the converse inference,\n\u201cascent\u201d. If descent under a term is valid, or at least is\nvalid without changing the rest of the proposition, it is called\n\u201cmobile\u201d, otherwise \u201cimmobile\u201d. Walter Burley,\nWilliam of Ockham and their followers could then define the three\nmodes of common personal supposition as follows:\n\nAn occurrence of a general term in a proposition has determinate\nsupposition when one can descend validly from the proposition to the\ncomplete disjunction of its singulars with respect to that term, and\nconversely can ascend validly from any singular;\nOtherwise, it is confused, and (i) is confused and distributive if\none can validly descend from the proposition to the indefinite\nconjunction of its singulars with respect to that term; otherwise (ii)\nit is merely confused.\n\n\nIn this last case, 2 (ii), Ockham noted: \u201cit is possible to\ndescend by way of a proposition with a disjunctive predicate and it is\npossible to infer the original proposition from any [singular]\u201d\n(tr. Loux p.\n 201).[27]\n Thus the predicate of an A-proposition has merely confused\nsupposition since descents 1 and 2 (i) are invalid, but from\n\u2018Every man is an animal\u2019 one can validly infer\n\u2018Every man is this animal or that animal and so on for all\nanimals\u2019, and conversely, from \u2018Every man is this\nanimal\u2019 (were it ever true) one could infer that every man is an\nanimal.\n\nA final complication came at the end of the fourteenth century and\nsubsequently, when it was asked: \u201cAre there only three modes of\ncommon personal supposition?\u201d Some answered, \u2018Yes\u2019;\nbut others distinguished two modes of merely confused supposition, or\nequivalently distinguished a fourth case, 2 (iii), collective\nsupposition, where descent was permissible to a proposition with a\nconjunctive term. The standard example was \u2018All the apostles of\nGod are 12\u2019, which entails \u2018Matthew and Mark and so on are\n12\u2019, with a conjunctive\n subject.[28]\n\nSeveral recent commentators have asked what the medieval theory of\nmodes of common personal supposition was for: was it a theory of\ninference, of quantification, of truth-conditions, of fallacies, or\nwhat? Asking these questions may help us to come to terms with the\ntheory; but if pressed too hard, they are unhelpful. The\nmedievals\u2019 theory was none of these things; it was their\ntheoretical basis with which to pose and answer certain semantic\nquestions.\n\nAll modes of supposition so far described fall under what was\nvariously called proper supposition or accidental supposition or,\nexcluding material supposition, formal supposition. Distinct from\nthese were what Peter of Spain called natural supposition, mentioned\nearlier in the discussion of signification, and what Ockham and others\ncall improper supposition, covering metaphor and other figures of\nspeech.\n\nMoreover, various authors before the fourteenth century, and at least\none fourteenth century author too (namely, Vincent Ferrer) differed a\nlittle from what has been said in not attributing supposition to\npredicate terms, calling the corresponding property of predicates,\n\u201ccopulation\u201d. However, even in the early thirteenth\ncentury, this distinction was fading. William of Sherwood makes it\nclearly: substantive names and pronouns supposit, whereas adjectives,\nparticiples and verbs copulate \u2013 all those terms which are\nattributed to something by means of the copula \u2018is\u2019. Only\nthe modes of common personal supposition are repeated for copulation:\n\u201cevery copulating word signifies in adjunction to a substantive\nand thus is copulated personally \u2026 [and] every copulating word\nis the name of an accident, but every name of an accident is common;\ntherefore no copulation is discrete\u201d (Sherwood, tr. Kretzmann,\np.\n 121).[29]\n However, even in Lambert and Peter of Spain, there is only an empty\nnod towards copulation. Lambert notes that properly speaking,\nsupposition attaches to substantives, while copulation is appropriate\nfor adjectival terms. But broadly speaking, he says, supposition\nbelongs to both (ed. Alessio, p. 208; tr. Maloney, p. 258). The\ndistinction is clearly unnecessary and useless, and although the term\nis preserved in, e.g., Walter Burley\u2019s De Puritate, his\ndiscussion headed \u2018On Copulation\u2019 is in fact a discussion\nof the uses of the copula, \u2018est\u2019.\n",
