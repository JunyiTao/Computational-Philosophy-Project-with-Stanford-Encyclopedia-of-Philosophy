    "main_text": "\n\nTwo competing conceptions of fallacies are that they are false but\npopular beliefs and that they are deceptively bad arguments. These we\nmay distinguish as the belief and argument conceptions of fallacies.\nAcademic writers who have given the most attention to the subject of\nfallacies insist on, or at least prefer, the argument conception of\nfallacies, but the belief conception is prevalent in popular and\nnon-scholarly discourse. As we shall see, there are yet other\nconceptions of what fallacies are, but the present inquiry focuses on\nthe argument conception of fallacies.\n\nBeing able to detect and avoid fallacies has been viewed as a\nsupplement to criteria of good reasoning. The knowledge of fallacies\nis needed to arm us against the most enticing missteps we might take\nwith arguments\u2014so thought not only Aristotle but also the early\nnineteenth century logicians Richard Whately and John Stuart Mill. But\nas the course of logical theory from the late nineteenth-century\nforward turned more and more to axiomatic systems and formal\nlanguages, the study of reasoning and natural language argumentation\nreceived much less attention, and hence developments in the study of\nfallacies almost came to a standstill. Until well past the middle of\nthe twentieth century, discussions of fallacies were for the most part\nrelegated to introductory level textbooks. It was only when\nphilosophers realized the ill fit between formal logic, on the one\nhand, and natural language reasoning and argumentation, on the other,\nthat the interest in fallacies has returned. Since the 1970s the\nutility of knowing about fallacies has been acknowledged (Johnson and\nBlair 1993), and the way in which fallacies are incorporated into\ntheories of argumentation has been taken as a sign of a theory\u2019s\nlevel of adequacy (Biro and Siegel 2007, van Eemeren 2010).\n\nIn modern fallacy studies it is common to distinguish formal and\ninformal fallacies. Formal fallacies are those readily seen to be\ninstances of identifiable invalid logical forms such as undistributed\nmiddle and denying the antecedent. Although many of the informal\nfallacies are also invalid arguments, it is generally thought to be\nmore profitable, from the points of view of both recognition and\nunderstanding, to bring their weaknesses to light through analyses\nthat do not involve appeal to formal languages. For this reason it has\nbecome the practice to eschew the symbolic language of formal logic in\nthe analysis of these fallacies; hence the term \u2018informal\nfallacy\u2019 has gained wide currency. In the following essay, which\nis in four parts, it is what is considered the informal-fallacy\nliterature that will be reviewed. Part 1 is an introduction to the\ncore fallacies as brought to us by the tradition of the textbooks.\nPart 2 reviews the history of the development of the conceptions of\nfallacies as it is found from Aristotle to Copi. Part 3 surveys some\nof the most recent innovative research on fallacies, and Part 4\nconsiders some of the current research topics in fallacy theory.\n",
