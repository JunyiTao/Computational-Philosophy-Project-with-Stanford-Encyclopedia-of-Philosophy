    "main_text": "Ethical Hedonism || Other Arguments Against Ethical Hedonism\n2.3 Other Arguments Against Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nThere are many and varied arguments against ethical hedonism. Those\nthat appeal to claims about the nature of pleasure are canvassed in\nSection 2.1 above. Further arguments against ethical hedonism could be\nconstructed that broadly parallel the unification, motivation,\nscientific naturalist, doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, causal and\nepistemic arguments for ethical hedonism presented and examined in\nSection 2.2 above. That task is not pursued in this entry. The\nfollowing sub-sections instead review other objections to ethical\nhedonism.\n2.3.1 Non-Necessity Objections\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the thesis that all and only\npleasure is good non-instrumentally, and all and only pain or\ndispleasure is bad non-instrumentally. The non-necessity objection to\nthis rejects its claim that only pleasure is good, or its claim that\nonly displeasure is bad, or both of these claims. Its thesis is that\npleasure is not necessary for positive importance, or that displeasure\nis not necessary for negative importance, or both. Its basic idea is\nthat something other than pleasure has value, and/or that something\nother than displeasure has disvalue. Any cases that are hedonic equals\nbut value unequals would deliver what the non-necessity objector\nseeks.\n\n\nOne expression of the non-necessity objection is the following\narticulated \u2018incredulous stare\u2019 (after Lewis 1986). Why\nwould anyone think, even for a minute, that hedonism is a plausible\ntheory of value? Even if we focus very narrowly, just on those mental\nstates of ours that arguably are instances of pleasure or have pleasure\nas a higher-order property \u2013 contentment, delight, ecstasy,\nelation, enjoyment, euphoria, exhilaration, exultation, gladness,\ngratification, gratitude, joy, liking, love, relief, satisfaction,\nSchadenfreude, tranquility, and so on \u2013 each of these mental\nstates or events or properties also has one or more non-hedonic\nproperties that contribute to its importance. Beyond pleasure, our\nmental lives are full of significant and diverse thoughts, perceptions,\nemotions, imaginings, wishes, and so on. These engage with massively\nplural and diverse items in ourselves, in others, in myriad aspects of\nthe non-human world, and in the infinities of contingent future\npossibility. This is true also of our relationships with ourselves and\nwith others, and with multiple aspects of the wider world. It is true\nalso of our agency \u2013 our deliberations, choices, plans,\nintentions, and so forth. In the light of such reflections, an\nincredulous stare might be thought an apt response to a profession of\nbelief in ethical hedonism. This incredulous stare argument is far from\ndecisive, but perhaps it should disrupt any complacent presumption in\nfavour of hedonism.\n\n\nMany well-known criticisms of hedonism can reasonably be interpreted\nas non-necessity objections. A short survey of some of the more\nsignificant of these follows.\n\n\nPlato pointed out that if your life is just one of pleasure then it\nwould not even include any recollection of pleasure; nor any distinct\nthought that you were pleased, even when you were pleased. His\nconclusion was that \u201cyour life would be the life, not of a man,\nbut of an oyster\u201d (Philebus 21a). Similarly, on J.S.\nMill's account of him at least (Mill: ch. 2), Carlyle held that\nhedonism is a \u201cdoctrine worthy only of swine\u201d.\n\n\nNozick (1971) and Nagel (1970) present schematic descriptions of\nlives that have all the appearance but none of the reality of\nself-understanding, achievement, loving relationships,\nself-directedness, and so on, alongside lives that have these\nappearances and also the corresponding realities. On the face of it,\nhedonism is committed to the hedonic equality and thus the equal value\nof these lives. Commenting on his more fantastical and more famous\n\u2018experience machine\u2019 case, Nozick added further detail,\nclaiming that it is also good in itself \u201cto do certain things,\nand not just have the experience [as if] of doing them\u201d,\n\u201cto be a certain way, to be a certain sort of person\u201d and\nnot just to be an \u201cindeterminate blob\u201d floating in a tank,\nand \u201cto make a difference in the world\u201d rather than merely\nto appear to oneself to do so. He concluded: \u201csomething matters\nto us in addition to experience\u201d (Nozick 1974: 43\u201344).\n\n\nConsider further the idea that actually having certain relationships\nwith oneself (e.g., relations of self-understanding) and with others\n(e.g., mutual relations of interpersonal love) matters, in addition to\nthe value of any experience one has that is just as if one has such\nrelationships. The thought here is that the motto \u2018also\nconnect\u2019 expresses something important, even if novelist E.M.\nForster's more ambitious \u2018only connect\u2019 (Forster: ch.\n33) was an exaggeration.\n\n\nIn a famous case description, Moore argued that a world with beauty\nbut without its contemplation, and indeed without any mental states\nwhatever, is better than a world that is \u201csimply one heap of\nfilth\u201d (Moore: sec. 50; contrast Sidgwick: 114). If Moore is\nright about this \u2018beauty and the filth\u2019 case, then pleasure\nis not necessary for value.\n\n\nW.D. Ross (138) considered two worlds that are equals both\nhedonically and in character terms. In one world, the virtuous have the\npleasure and the vicious have the pain, while in the other the vicious\nhave the pleasure and the virtuous have the pain. To help secure across\nall plausible accounts of the nature of pleasure the \u2018equality of\npleasure\u2019 that is central to this case comparison, suppose that\nin each world the same pleasures are taken in the same objects.\nPleasure is equal across these two worlds, but Ross argues that the\nwell-matched world is better than the mis-matched world. If he is\nright, then this is a case of \u2018same pleasure, different\nvalue\u2019, and thereby also a case in which difference of pleasure\nis not necessary for difference of value.\n\n\nImagining oneself to have a hedonically perfect life, a\nnon-necessity objector is apt to respond along the lines of the popular\nPaul Jabara / Jo Asher song: \u2018Something's missing in my\nlife\u2019. One way to fill out the detail is with some variant of\nthat song's second premise: \u2018Baby it's you\u2019.\nThe objectors' claim is that there is something that is\nsufficient for value and that is missing from the life of perfect\npleasure. If the objection stands then pleasure is not necessary for\nvalue.\n\n\nThere is a range of possible hedonist responses to non-necessity\nobjections. One reply is that the allegedly non-hedonic item on which\nthe objector focuses just is an instance of pleasure, so its\nbeing valuable is just what a hedonist would expect. A related reply is\nthat the item to which the objector points is sufficient for value only\ninsofar as it is an instance of pleasure, so the thesis that pleasure\nis necessary for value again remains unscathed. Responses of these\nsorts are relatively easy for hedonists to make; but it is less easy to\nshow anyone who is not already a hedonist that these replies provide\ngrounds for taking the hedonist side of the arguments. A third reply\nhedonists might make to non-necessity objections is to allow that the\nitem in question is or includes non-pleasure that has value, but then\nto argue that this is merely instrumental value. A fourth and more\nconcessive reply is that the item in question might be a non-pleasure\nand might be sufficient for non-instrumental value of some sort (e.g.,\nmoral value), but to add that there is also at least one sort of value\n(e.g., prudential value) for which pleasure is necessary. For example,\nit might be claimed that self-sacrifice that protects the non-sentient\nenvironment has non-hedonic moral value but lacks prudential value for\nthe agent. An option that is yet more concessive is for hedonists is to\nagree that pleasure is not necessary for value or that displeasure is\nnot necessary for disvalue or both of these things, but to continue to\ninsist that pleasure is sufficient for value or that displeasure is\nsufficient for disvalue or both of these things.\n2.3.2 Insufficiency Objections\n\n\nAs noted above, the simplest form of ethical hedonism is the claim\nthat all and only pleasure is good non-instrumentally and all and only\npain or displeasure is bad non-instrumentally. The insufficiency\nobjection rejects the ethical hedonist claim that all pleasure is good,\nor that all displeasure is bad, or both claims. Its contrary thesis is\nthat pleasure is insufficient for good, and/or that displeasure is\ninsufficient for bad; some pleasure has no value, and/or some\ndispleasure has no disvalue. Any pair of cases that are value equals\nbut hedonic unequals would deliver what the insufficiency objector\nseeks.\n\n\nVarious insufficiency objections are outlined below. Each aims to\nshow that some pleasure is worthless or worse and is thus insufficient\nfor good or value. Some focus on the bad as cause of pleasure, others\non the bad as object of pleasure. A third possible focus is on pleasure\nunderstood as a property of something bad such as a sadistic thought or\nact, rather than as an effect of something bad.\n\n\nAristotle (Book x, ch. 3) argued that some pleasure is disgraceful\nor base. Brentano (1889/1969: 90) argued that \u201cpleasure in the\nbad\u201d both lacks value and has disvalue. Moore (sec. 56) expressed\nsimilar thoughts in a bracingly concrete manner by imagining the\npleasures of \u201cperpetual indulgence in bestiality\u201d and\nclaiming them to be not good but bad. Self-destructive or masochistic\npleasure, pleasure with a non-existent or false object, and\ncontra-deserved pleasure are some other targets of insufficiency\nobjections to hedonism about value.\n\n\nHedonists can respond in various ways to insufficiency objections.\nThese are canvassed below.\n\n\nOne sort of hedonist response to an insufficiency objection is to\naccept that the objector's case is an instance of pleasure, but\nthen to claim that it is sufficient for value. This response\nis underpinned by insistence on the wider thought that any pleasure is\nsufficient for value. Consistent with this, but rather concessively, it\ncould also be claimed that pleasure is sufficient for only very little\nvalue, and that substantial or major value is present only if further\nconditions are met. Such further conditions might concern the extent to\nwhich the pleasure is \u2018higher\u2019 rather than\n\u2018lower\u2019, whether its object exists, or whether its object\nmerits pleasure. Feldman (2004) has formulated and sympathetically\nexamined several views that have this sort of structure, including\nAltitude-Adjusted, Truth-Adjusted, and Desert-Adjusted forms of\nIntrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism.\n\n\nA second hedonist response is to accept that the insufficiency\nobjector has indeed found a case that is insufficient for value, but\nthen to claim that it is not an instance of pleasure. This\nsort of response is underpinned by the hedonist's insistence on\nthe wider thought that anything insufficient for value is not\npleasure.\n\n\nA third hedonist response is somewhat concessive. It distinguishes\nat least two basic kinds of value, and continues to insist that\npleasure is sufficient for one of these, while also accepting the\nobjector's thesis that there is at least one other sort of value\nfor which pleasure is not sufficient. One instance of this response is\nthe claim that sadistic pleasure adds prudential value for the sadist\nbut also lacks moral value and indeed has moral disvalue. But such a\nmove is more awkward in other cases, including those of pleasure that\nis self-destructive or masochistic.\n\n\nA fourth hedonist response is concessive. It abandons altogether the\nthesis that pleasure is sufficient for value, while also continuing to\ninsist that pleasure is necessary for value. Consistent with this\nresponse, one could claim that pleasure is conditionally valuable; that\nis, sufficient for value when and only when certain further conditions\nare met. These conditions could be specified either negatively (e.g.,\npleasure is valuable only when it does not arise from and is not\ndirected at a bad deed or character state or state of affairs), or\npositively (e.g., pleasure is valuable only when its object exists, or\nonly when its object is deserving of it). Modified forms of\nAltitude-Adjusted, Truth-Adjusted, and Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic\nAttitudinal Hedonism would have this structure (see Feldman 2004).\n",
