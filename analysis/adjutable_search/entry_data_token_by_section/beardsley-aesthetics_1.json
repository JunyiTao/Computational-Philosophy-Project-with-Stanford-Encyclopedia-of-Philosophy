    "main_text": "The Nature of Aesthetics\n2. The Nature of Aesthetics\n\nNot all the arts could be covered in detail in even so long a book as\nAesthetics\u2014it\u2019s over 600 pages\u2014so Beardsley\nhad to content himself with concentrating on three relatively\ndisparate arts:\u00a0literature, music, and painting. In keeping with\nthe conception of philosophy mentioned above, aesthetics was thought\nof as meta-criticism. \u201cThere would be no problems of\naesthetics\u201d, Beardsley says, \u201cif no one ever talked about\nworks of art\u2026. We can\u2019t do aesthetics until we have some\ncritical statements to work on\u201d (Aesth: 1, 4]).\nAesthetics is concerned with \u201cthe nature and basis of\ncriticism,\u2026 just as criticism itself is concerned with works of\nart\u201d (Aesth: 6). The then-current and still widespread\nview that philosophy is a second-order, meta-level, and essentially\nlinguistic activity, taking as its object of study the pronouncements\nof first-order activities, such as chemistry, religion, or history, is\nreflected in Beardsley\u2019s view on the nature of aesthetics.\n\nIt\u2019s a problematic view, however, and one somewhat belied by\nBeardsley\u2019s own philosophic practice. Questions like, What sort\nof being or existence do works of art have?\u2014a question of\nontology, and one of Beardsley\u2019s questions\u2014arise from the\nstatements of art critics only in that critics use the term\n\u2019work of art\u2019 and, with that concept available, inquiry\ninto the ontological status of the objects that answer to it is then\npossible. But the question isn\u2019t itself one that arises out of,\nor concerns the nature and basis of, critical practice, at least not\nin any significant sense of the term. For one thing, others besides\ncritics use the term \u201cwork of art\u201d\u2014art dealers and\nart suppliers, for example\u2014so the case could just as easily be\nmade that the ontological question arises out of, and concerns the\nnature and basis of, art dealership or art supply-manship. A related\npoint is that the same argument applies outside the arts. Farmers and\ngrocers speak of apples, and unless we had some such term as\n\u201capple\u201d, the question, What sort of being or existence do\napples have?\u2014again, a question of ontology\u2014couldn\u2019t\nbe posed. It isn\u2019t a question that arises out of the cultivation\nor sale of apples, however\u2014not in any very direct or meaningful\nway\u2014nor is it one that concerns the nature and basis of apple\nfarming or running a supermarket. Critics, like farmers and art\nsuppliers, do very well without ontological inquiries; ontological\nquestions don\u2019t lurk in the background, waiting to be asked. In\nshort, Beardsley\u2019s meta-philosophical view that aesthetics is\nmeta-criticism is underdetermined by the reasons that he advances for\nit, inaccurate or correct only if the term\n\u201cmeta-criticism\u201d is stretched beyond its usual bounds, and\nbelied to some extent by Beardsley\u2019s own\nphilosophic\u00a0practice. All of that is not to deny, however, that a\ngreat deal of aesthetics can be profitably viewed as meta-critical, as\na critical examination and evaluation of the nature and basis of at\nleast some of the statements that art critics make, at least if art\ncritics are conceived broadly enough to include almost everyone who\nhas ever stood before a painting, listened to a piece of music, or\nread a novel, and then ventured a judgment about it.\n\nCritical statements are of three kinds, Beardsley thinks: descriptive,\ninterpretative, and evaluative. The first concerns non-normative\nproperties of works of art that are simply in it, in some sense, and\nare available, at least in principle, to anyone of normal eyes and\nears if sufficiently sensitive, attentive, and experienced.\n\u201cThere is a small red patch in the upper right-hand corner of\nthe painting\u201d is a descriptive statement, but so is\n\u201cHaydn\u2019s 23rd Symphony abounds in\ndynamic tension\u201d. The philosophical problems that descriptive\nstatements give rise to involve the concept of form, Beardsley thinks.\nInterpretive statements are also non-normative but concern the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of a work of art, with \u201cmeaning\u201d\nhere referring to a semantic relation, or at least a purported\nsemantic relation, between the work and (a small number of exceptions\naside) something outside it. \u201cThat\u2019s a picture of Notary\nSojac\u201d is an interpretive statement, as are \u201cThat\u2019s\na picture of a unicorn\u201d, \u201cThe passage refers to\nBrutus\u2019s betrayal of Caesar\u201d, and \u201cThe thesis of\nMacbeth is exceedingly simple: Thou shalt not kill\u201d.\nLast, critical evaluations are normative judgments that basically say\nthat a work of art is good or bad, or how good or bad it is.\n\u201cMozart\u2019s \u2018Turkish March\u2019 is an excellent\nshort piano piece\u201d is a critical evaluation, and so is\n\u201c\u2018The Face on the Barroom Floor\u2019 is wretched\nverse\u201d. The judgment \u201cThis is beautiful\u201d\u2014the\nparadigm of a judgment of taste according to Kant\u2014is sometimes\nthought of as a critical evaluation (Aesth: 9), but more\noften (e.g., Aesth: 463, 507), and always in\nBeardsley\u2019s later writing, as a descriptive judgment, and one\nthat frequently forms at least a partial basis for a critical\nevaluation.\n",
