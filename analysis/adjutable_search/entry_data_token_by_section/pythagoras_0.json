    "main_text": "The Pythagorean Question\n1. The Pythagorean Question\n\n\nWhat were the beliefs and practices of the historical Pythagoras?\nThis apparently simple question has become the daunting Pythagorean\nquestion for several reasons. First, Pythagoras himself wrote nothing,\nso our knowledge of Pythagoras\u2019 views is entirely derived from the\nreports of others. Second, there was no extensive or authoritative\ncontemporary account of Pythagoras. No one did for Pythagoras what\nPlato and Xenophon did for Socrates. Third, only fragments of the\nfirst detailed accounts of Pythagoras, written about 150 years after\nhis death, have survived. Fourth, it is clear that these accounts\ndisagreed with one another on significant points. These four points\nwould already make the problem of determining Pythagoras\u2019 philosophical\nbeliefs more difficult than determining those of almost any other\nancient philosopher, but a fifth factor complicates matters even\nmore. By the third century CE, when the first detailed accounts of\nPythagoras that survive intact were written, Pythagoras had come to be\nregarded, in some circles, as the master philosopher, from whom all\nthat was true in the Greek philosophical tradition derived. By the end\nof the first century BCE, a large collection of books had been forged\nin the name of Pythagoras and other early Pythagoreans, which\npurported to be the original Pythagorean texts from which Plato and\nAristotle derived their most important ideas. A treatise forged in the\nname of Timaeus of Locri was the supposed model for Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus, just as forged treatises assigned to Archytas were\nthe supposed model for Aristotle\u2019s Categories. Pythagoras\nhimself was widely presented as having anticipated Plato\u2019s later\nmetaphysics, in which the one and the indefinite dyad are first\nprinciples. Thus, not only is the earliest evidence for\nPythagoras\u2019 views meager and contradictory, it is overshadowed by the\nhagiographical presentation of Pythagoras, which became dominant in\nlate antiquity. Given these circumstances, the only reliable approach\nto answering the Pythagorean question is to start with the earliest\nevidence, which is independent of the later attempts to glorify\nPythagoras, and to use the picture of Pythagoras which emerges from\nthis early evidence as the standard against which to evaluate what can\nbe accepted and what must be rejected in the later\ntradition. Following such an approach, Walter Burkert, in his\nepoch-making book (1972a), revolutionized our understanding of the\nPythagorean question, and all modern scholarship on Pythagoras,\nincluding this article, stands on his shoulders.
