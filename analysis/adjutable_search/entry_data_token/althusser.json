Life\n\nLouis Althusser was born on October 16th, 1918 in Bir\nMourad Ra\u00efs (formerly Birmandreis), a suburb of Algiers.\nHailing from Alsace on his father\u2019s side of the family, his\ngrandparents were French citizens who had chosen to settle in\nAlgeria. At the time of his birth, Althusser\u2019s father was a\nlieutenant in the French Military. After this service was up, his\nfather returned to Algiers and to his work as a banker. By all\naccounts save for the retrospective ones contained in his\nautobiographies, Althusser\u2019s early childhood in North Africa was\na contented one. There he enjoyed the comforts of the Mediterranean\nenvironment as well as those provided by an extended and stable\npetit-bourgeois family.\n\nIn 1930, his father\u2019s work moved the family to Marseille. Always\na good pupil, Althusser excelled in his studies and became active in\nthe Scouts. In 1936, the family moved again, this time to Lyon. There,\nAlthusser was enrolled in the prestigious Lyc\u00e9e du Parc. At the\nLyc\u00e9e, he began taking classes in order to prepare for the\ncompetitive entrance exams to France\u2019s grandes\n\u00e9coles. Raised in an observant family, Althusser was\nparticularly influenced by professors of a distinctly Catholic\ntendency. These included the philosophers Jean Guitton and Jean\nLacroix as well as the historian Joseph Hours. In 1937, while still at\nthe Lyc\u00e9e, Althusser joined the Catholic youth group\nJeunesse \u00e9tudiantes chr\u00e9tiennes. This interest\nin Catholicism and his participation in Catholic organizations would\ncontinue even after Althusser joined the Communist Party in 1948. The\nsimultaneous enthusiasm that Althusser showed in Lyon for Royalist\npolitics did not last the war.\n\nIn 1939, Althusser performed well enough on the national entrance\nexaminations to be admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in Paris. However, before the school year\nbegan, he was mobilized into the army. Soon thereafter, he was\ncaptured in Vannes along with the rest of his artillery regiment. He\nspent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war at a camp in\nNorthern Germany. In his autobiographical writings, Althusser credits\nthe experiences of solidarity, political action, and community that he\nfound in the camp as opening him up to the idea of communism. Indeed,\nhis prison writings collected as Journal de captivit\u00e9,\nStalag XA 1940\u20131945 evidence these experiences. They also\nprovide evidence of the cycles of deep depression that began for\nAlthusser in 1938 and that would mark him for the rest of his\nlife.\n\nAt the end of the war and following his release from the P.O.W. camp\nin 1945, Althusser took his place at the ENS. Now 27 years old, he\nbegan the program of study that was to prepare him for the\nagr\u00e9gation, the competitive examination which\nqualifies one to teach philosophy in French secondary schools and that\nis often the gateway to doctoral study and university employment.\nPerhaps not surprisingly for a young man who had just spent half a\ndecade in a prison camp, much happened during the three years he spent\npreparing for the exam and working on his Master\u2019s thesis.\nThough still involved in Catholic groups and still seeing himself as a\nChristian, the movements that Althusser associated with after the war\nwere leftist in their politics and, intellectually, he made a move to\nembrace and synthesize Christian and Marxist thought. This synthesis\nand his first published works were informed by a reading of\n19th Century German idealist philosophy, especially Hegel\nand Marx, as well as by progressive Christian thinkers associated with\nthe group Jeunesse de l\u2019\u00c9glise. Indeed, it was\n19th Century German Idealism with which he was most engaged\nduring his period of study at the ENS. In line with this interest (one\nshared with many other French intellectuals at the time), Althusser\nobtained his dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes\nsup\u00e9rieures in 1947 for a work directed by Gaston\nBachelard and titled \u201cOn Content in the Thought of G.W.F.\nHegel.\u201d In 1948, he passed his agr\u00e9gation,\ncoming in first on the written portion of the exam and second on the\noral. After this showing, Althusser was offered and accepted the post\nof agr\u00e9g\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur (director of\nstudies) at the ENS whose responsibility it was to help students\nprepare for their own agr\u00e9gations. In this capacity,\nhe began offering courses and tutorials on particular topics in\nphilosophy and on particular figures from the history of philosophy.\nAs he retained this responsibility for more than thirty years and\nworked with some of the brightest thinkers that France produced during\nthis time (including Alain Badiou, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel\nFoucault), through his teaching Althusser left a deep and lasting\nimpression on a generation of French philosophers and on French\nphilosophy.\n\nIn addition to inaugurating his extended association with the ENS, the\nfirst few years spent in Paris after the war saw Althusser begin three\nother long-lasting relationships. The first of these was with the\nFrench Communist Party, the second with his companion and eventual\nwife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien, and the third with\nFrench psychiatry. Begun to treat recurrent bouts of depression, this\nlast affiliation continued for the rest of his life and included\nfrequent hospitalization as well as the most aggressive treatments\npost-war French psychiatry had to offer such as electroconvulsive\ntherapy, narco-analysis, and psychoanalysis.\n\nThe second relationship begun by Althusser was little happier and no\nless dependent than the first. At its outset, Althusser\u2019s bond\nwith Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien was complicated by his almost\ntotal inexperience with women and by her being eight years older than\nhim. It was also made difficult by the vast differences in their\nexperience of the world and by her relationship with the Communist\nParty. Whereas Althusser had known only home, school, and P.O.W.\ncamp, Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien had traveled widely and had long\nbeen active in literary and radical circles. At the time the two met,\nshe was also embroiled in a dispute with the Party over her role in\nthe resistance during World War II.\n\nThough Althusser was not yet a Party member, like many of his\ngeneration, he emerged from the War deeply sympathetic to its moral\naims. His interest in Party politics and involvement with Party\nmembers grew during his time as a student at the ENS. However, the\nENS\u2019 suspicion of communists as well\nas Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien\u2019s troubles with the Party\ncomplicated Althusser\u2019s relationship with each of these\ninstitutions. Nonetheless, shortly after being offered the post of\nagr\u00e9g\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur (and thus safe\nfrom being bypassed for the position due to his membership), Althusser\njoined the Communist Party. For the next few years, Althusser tried to\nadvance the aims of the Communist Party as well as the goal of getting\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien accepted back into it. He\ndid so by being a good militant (going to cell meetings, distributing\ntracts, etc), by re-starting a Marxist study group at the ENS (the\nCercle Politzer), and by making inquiries into\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rytmann-L\u00e9gotien\u2019s wartime\nactivities in the hopes of clearing her name. By his own account, he\nmade a terrible activist and he also failed to rehabilitate\nher reputation. Nonetheless, his relationship with the Party and\nwith his future wife deepened during this period.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Althusser lived two lives that were only somewhat\ninter-related: one was that of a successful, if somewhat obscure\nacademic philosopher and pedagogue and the other that of a loyal\nCommunist Party Member. This is not to say that Althusser was\npolitically inactive at the school or that his communism did not\ninfluence his philosophical work. On the contrary, Althusser recruited\ncolleagues and students to the Party and worked closely with the\ncommunist cell based at the ENS. In addition, at mid-decade, he\npublished a few introductions to Marxist philosophy. However, in his\nteaching and advising, he mostly avoided bringing in Marxist\nphilosophy and Communist politics. Instead, he catered to student\ninterest and to the demands of each new agr\u00e9gation by\nengaging closely with classic philosophical texts and with\ncontemporary philosophy and social science. Further, the bulk of his\nscholarship was on 18th Century political philosophy.\nIndeed, the only book-length study Althusser published during his\nlifetime was a work on Montesquieu, which appeared at the end of the\ndecade. At the ENS, Althusser\u2019s professionalism as well as his\nability to think institutionally was rewarded in 1954 with a promotion\nto secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019\u00e9cole\nlitt\u00e9raire, a post where he had some responsibility for\nthe management and direction of the school.\n\nIt would have surprised no one if Althusser had continued to influence\nFrench political and philosophical life subtly, through the students\nthat he mentored, through his scholarship on the history of political\nphilosophy, through the colloquia among philosophers, scientists, and\nhistorians that he organized, and through his routine work as a Party\nmember. However, in 1961, with an essay titled \u201cOn the Young\nMarx,\u201d Althusser aggressively entered into a heated debate about\nthe continuity of Marx\u2019s oeuvre and about what constitutes the\ncore of Marxist philosophy. Appearing at a time of crisis in the\nFrench Communist Party\u2019s direction and seeming to offer a\n\u201cscientific\u201d alternative to Stalinism and to the humanist\nrevisions of Marxism then being proffered, the theoretical viewpoint\noffered by Althusser gained adherents. Invigorated by this recognition\nand by the possibility that theoretical work might actually change\nCommunist Party practice, Althusser began to publish regularly on\nMarxist philosophy. These essays occasioned much public discussion and\nphilosophical activity both in France and abroad. At the same time as\nthese essays began creating a stir, Althusser changed his teaching\nstyle at the ENS and began to offer collaborative seminars where he\nand his students attempted a \u201creturn to Marx\u201d and to\nMarx\u2019s original texts. In 1965, the fruit of one of these\nseminars was published as Reading Capital. That same year,\nthe essays on Marxist theory that had made such a sensation were\ncollected and published in the volume For Marx. Amplifying\nthese books\u2019 collective impact well beyond the realm of\nintra-party discussion was the general trend in literary and social\nscientific theory labeled \u201cstructuralism\u201d and with which\nAlthusser\u2019s re-reading of Marx was identified.\n\nAt mid-decade, Althusser seized on these works\u2019 popularity and\nthe fact that his arguments had created a faction within the French\nCommunist Party composed mostly of young intelligentsia to try and\nforce change. This gambit to have the Party directed by theorists\nrather than by a Central Committee, whose Stalinism remained\nentrenched and who believed in the organic wisdom of the worker, met\nwith little success. At the most, he succeeded in carving out some\nautonomy for theoretical reflection within the Party. Even though it\nis his most well-known intervention, this was not the first attempt by\nAlthusser to try and influence the Party (he had tried once before\nduring the mid 1950s from his position as cell leader at the ENS) and\nit would not be his last. While he lost much of the student support\nthat his work had created when he remained silent during the\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d events of May 1968 (he was in a\npsychiatric hospital at the time), he campaigned once more to\ninfluence the Party during the mid 1970s. This intervention occurred\nin response to the French Communist Party\u2019s decision to abandon\ntraditional Marxist-Leninist aspects of its platform so as to better\nally itself with the Socialist Party. Though Althusser\u2019s\nposition was well publicized and found its supporters, in the end, his\narguments were unable to motivate the Party\u2019s rank-and-file such\nthat its leadership would reconsider its decision.\n\nDuring the decades in which he became internationally known for his\nre-thinking of Marxist philosophy, Althusser continued in his post at\nthe ENS. There he took on increasing institutional responsibility\nwhile continuing to edit and, with Fran\u00e7ois Maspero, to publish\nhis own work and that of others in the series Th\u00e9orie.\nIn 1975, Althusser acquired the right to direct research on the basis\nof his previously published work. Shortly after this recognition, he\nmarried his longtime companion, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\nRytmann-L\u00e9gotien.\n\nFollowing the French Left\u2019s and the Communist Party\u2019s\nelectoral defeats in the 1978 elections, Althusser\u2019s bouts of\ndepression became more severe and more frequent. In November 1980,\nafter a painful surgery and another bout of mental illness, which saw\nhim hospitalized for most of the summer and whose symptoms continued\nafter his return to the ENS in the fall, Althusser strangled his wife.\nBefore he could be arrested for the murder, he was sent to a mental\nhospital. Later, when an examining magistrate came to inform him of\nthe crime of which he was accused, Althusser was in so fragile a\nmental state that he could not understand the charges or the process\nto which he was to be submitted and he was left at the hospital. After\nan examination, a panel of psychiatrists concluded that Althusser was\nsuffering at the time of the murder from severe depression and\niatrogenic hallucinations. Citing a French law (since changed), which\nstates that \u201cthere is neither crime nor delict where the suspect\nwas in a state of dementia at the time of the action,\u201d the\nmagistrate in charge of Althusser\u2019s case decided that there were\nno grounds on which to pursue prosecution.\n\nThe last ten years of Althusser\u2019s life were spent in and out of\nmental hospitals and at the apartment in Paris\u2019 20th\narrondissement where he had planned to retire. During this period, he\nwas visited by a few loyal friends and kept up some correspondences.\nGiven his mental state, his frequent institutionalizations, his\nanomie, and the drugs he was prescribed, these were not very\nproductive years. However, at mid-decade, he did find the energy to\nre-visit some of his old work and to attempt to construct from it an\nexplicit metaphysics. He also managed to write an autobiography, a\ntext he averred was intended to provide the explanation for the murder\nof his wife that he was never able to provide in court. Both texts\nonly appeared posthumously. When his mental and physical health\ndeteriorated again in 1987, Althusser went to live at a psychiatric\nhospital in La Verri\u00e8re, a village to the west of Paris. There,\non the 22nd of October, 1990, he died of a heart attack\n2. Early Work (1946\u201360)\n\nDespite its being anthologized and translated during the mid 1990s,\nthere has until recently been relatively little critical attention\npaid to Althusser\u2019s writings prior to 1961. Certainly, in terms\nof method, style, and inspiration, the Althusser found in these works\ndiffers significantly from the Althusser of For Marx and\nReading Capital. In his writings from the 1940s, for\ninstance, his method and conclusions resemble those of the Marxist\nHumanists of whom he would later be so critical, while texts from the\n1950s deploy without irony the Stalinist shibboleths he would later\nsubject to such castigation. Nonetheless, as these texts announce many\nof Althusser\u2019s perennial themes and because some of the\ncontradictions these works possess are shared with his classic texts\nand are repeated again in his late work, these early essays, books,\nand translations are worthy of examination\n2.1 Christianity and Marxism\n\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophical output between 1946 and 1961 can\nroughly be divided into four categories. The first category includes\nthose essays, mostly written between 1946 and 1951, where Althusser\nexplores possible rapports between Christianity and Marxism. In the\nfirst of these essays \u201cThe International of Decent\nFeelings,\u201d Althusser argues from what he takes to be \u201cthe\ntruth of Christianity\u201d against the popular post-war view that\nthe misery, guilt, and alienation of the human condition in the atomic\nage is equally experienced by all subjects. For him, this\nexistentialist diagnosis is a type of idolatry: it replaces\nrecognition of our equality before God with our equality before the\nfear of death. In that it does so, it is twice anti-Christian. For, in\naddition to the sin of idolatry (death equals God), it fails to\nacknowledge the existence of a particular class, the proletariat, for\nwhom anguish is not its lot and who is actually capable of delivering\nthe emancipation from fear by re-appropriating the products of human\nproduction, including the atomic bomb. A subsequent essay from 1947,\n\u201cA Matter of Fact,\u201d continues in this vein, suggesting the\nnecessity of socialist means for realizing Christian ends. It also\nincludes a Hegelian critique of the existing Catholic Church which\nsuggests that the church is incapable of such an alliance without a\ntheological revolution. Each of these essays includes the suggestion\nthat critique and reform will occasion a better church and a truer\nChristianity. By 1949, however, Althusser was totally pessimistic\nabout this possibility and, in a letter to his mentor Jean Lacroix, he\nargued that the sole possibility for realizing Christian values is\nthrough communist action. Though some critics have argued that\nChristian and Catholic values and modes of reasoning inform all of\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophy, any explicit consideration of a\npractical and theoretical reconciliation between the two was abandoned\nat this point in Althusser\u2019s development.\n2.2 Hegelian Marxism\n\nThe second category of Althusser\u2019s early work, one closely\nrelated to the first, are those texts that deal with Hegel. Written\nprimarily for an academic audience, they approach Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy either critically, in terms of the history of its reception\nand use, or exegetically, in terms of examining what possibility\nHegel\u2019s metaphysics, logic, politics, epistemology, and\nunderstanding of subjectivity offer to those interested in\nunderstanding and encouraging societal transformation. Between 1946\nand 1950, the results of Althusser\u2019s exegeses were positive:\nHegel indeed had something to offer. This judgment finds its most\ndetailed explanation in Althusser\u2019s 1947 thesis \u201cOn\nContent in the thought of G.W.F. Hegel.\u201d In addition to\ndetailing Hegel\u2019s relation to Kant and criticizing the\nsimplification of the dialectic by Hegel\u2019s commentators,\nAlthusser argues in this work that the dialectic \u201ccannot be\nattacked for its form\u201d (1947, 116). Instead, Hegel can only be\ncritiqued for a failure of the contents of the form (as these contents\nare specified in Hegel\u2019s historical and political works) to have\nactually fulfilled the absolute idea. Following the Young Hegelians,\nthen, Althusser uses Hegel\u2019s dialectic against itself to\ncriticize claims like the one made in The Philosophy of Right\nthat the Prussian state is the fulfillment of the dialectic. Though he\nuses Marx\u2019s Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of\nRight to make his points and though he is in agreement with Marx\nthat the Hegelian concept, realized in thought, must now be realized\nin the world, Althusser does not suggest in his thesis that\nMarx\u2019s philosophy leaves Hegel\u2019s insights about, history,\nlogic, and the subject behind. Instead, he contends that Marx is\nguilty of committing the same error as Hegel in mistaking historical\ncontent for the fulfillment of the dialectic. Because all knowledge is\nhistorical, Althusser argues, Marxists can only correct for this error\nby appeal to the idea of the dialectic and to its end in the absolute\nand the eternal, to a time \u201cwhen the human totality will be\nreconciled with its own structure\u201d (1947, 156). Something like\nthis argument will appear again in his classical work as a critique of\nthe empiricist tendency in Marxist philosophy.\n2.3 Marx not Hegel\n\nBy the early 1950s, Althusser\u2019s judgments that Marxism was, of\nnecessity, Hegelian and that it aimed at human fulfillment had\nundergone revision. This transition to thinking about Marx as the\noriginator of a philosophy totally distinct from Hegel\u2019s was\nsignaled in a review essay from 1950 which argued that the post-war\nmania for Hegel in France was only a bourgeois attempt to combat Marx.\nIn two short essays from 1953 on Marxist philosophy, this switch is\nfully apparent. In these texts, Althusser aligns himself with the\nposition advanced by Mehring and Lenin that, at a certain point in\nMarx\u2019s development, Hegel is left behind and that, afterwards,\nMarx forged his own original concepts and methodology. In his\ndescription of what these concepts and methodology are, Althusser\npretty much follows the Party line, insisting that Marx reversed the\nHegelian dialectic, that historical materialism is a science, that the\nsciences verify dialectical materialism, and that the proletariat\nneeds to be taught Marxist science from above. Though these essays\nrepeat the Party philosophy as formulated by Lenin, Stalin, and\nZhdanov, they also include recognizable Althusserian themes and show\nhis thinking about these themes to be in transition. For instance,\nboth essays retain the idea from Althusser\u2019s 1947 thesis about\nthe quasi-transcendental status of present scientific knowledge. Both\nalso anticipate future concerns in their speculations about the\nideological character of current scientific knowledge and in their\nincorporation of ideas from Mao about the relationship between theory\nand practice. Written as a response to Paul Ricoeur and representing\nthe last example of this third category of Althusser\u2019s early\nwork, a text from 1955 argues for the objectivity of historical\nscience. This is a theme to which he would return. Noticeably absent\nfrom this body of work, however, are the detailed and original claims\nAlthusser would make in the early 1960s about Marx\u2019s\nphilosophy.\n2.4 Historical Work: Montesquieu and Feuerbach\n\nTwo essays that Althusser wrote in the mid 1950s were the first to\nfocus exclusively on Marxist philosophy and are interesting inasmuch\nas they evidence his rejection of Hegel and his embrace of the\nParty\u2019s Marxism-Leninism. In addition, these texts suggest the\nneed for a thorough study of Marx. This study, however, would wait\nuntil the beginning of the next decade. For the rest of the 1950s,\nmost of Althusser\u2019s published work involved the study of\nphilosophical figures who preceded Marx. These figures included\nMontesquieu, on whose political philosophy and theory of history he\nwrote a book-length study, and Feuerbach, whose writings he translated\nand commented upon. The dual thesis of Althusser\u2019s Montesquieu\nbook: that, insofar as Montesquieu studies the \u201cconcrete\nbehavior of men\u201d he resists idealism and inaugurates the study\nof history as a science and that, insofar as Montesquieu accepts past\nand present political formations as delimiting the possibilities for\npolitical life, he remains an idealist, is one that will find echoes\nin Althusser\u2019s study of Marx during the next decade. Similarly,\ninasmuch as he makes the argument in a commentary (1960) that part of\nhis intention in translating Feuerbach is to show just what Marx owes\nin his early writings to the author of The Essence of\nChristianity so that these may be better seen as absent from\nMarx\u2019s mature work, these studies of Feuerbach can also be seen\nas propaedeutic to the study of Marx which Althusser inaugurated in\n1961 with his article \u201cOn the Young Marx\u201d.\n3. Classic Work (1961\u20131966)\n\nWith the perspective afforded by the mass of posthumous writings\npublished since the 1990s, it has become clear that Althusser was\nperennially concerned with important issues in metaphysics,\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, hermeneutics, and\npolitical philosophy. However, it is also true that the primary medium\nAlthusser employed for thinking through problems in these areas was\nMarxist philosophy. This is especially true of the period between 1961\nand 1966 when the majority of his published and unpublished work\nconcerned itself with how to read Marx, the definition of Marxist\nphilosophy, and how to understand and apply Marxian concepts. In\naddition, if we are to take Althusser\u2019s retrospective word for\nit, the pieces he published during this period were intended as\npolitical-theoretical acts, polemics meant to respond to contemporary\nopinions and policies and to shift the terms of these arguments as\nwell as the actions which were their results. For these reasons, it is\nnatural when discussing these texts to focus upon the contexts that\nengendered them and upon the positions within Marxist philosophy that\nAlthusser stakes out by their means. Alternatively, as Althusser\nindicates in many of these pieces his debts to contemporaneous\ntheorists and to philosophical predecessors such as Spinoza, there is\nthe temptation to understand his thought as a combination of the\ninsights contributed by these thinkers with Marxist philosophy. While\neach is a useful approach to understanding and explaining\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophy, when excessive attention is paid to one\nor another of them, one risks historicizing his contributions or\nsuggesting that they are merely derivative. Seeking to avoid either\nresult, even though the following discussion will note the context for\nAlthusser\u2019s work, its relation to Marxist philosophy, and the\nnon-Marxist philosophical insights that contribute to its method and\nconclusions, this account will also suggest the uniqueness of his\ncontributions to hermeneutics, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy\nof science, historiography, and political philosophy.\n\nFor multiple, overlapping, and complicated reasons of which the most\nrelevant may be the discrediting of Stalin\u2019s personage,\npolicies, and version of Marxist philosophy that followed\nKhrushchev\u2019s \u201cSecret Speech,\u201d Europe in the late\n1950s saw a blossoming of political and philosophical alternatives to\nthe version of Marxism-Leninism promulgated by the Soviet Union. This\nversion of Marxist philosophy had dominated European leftist thought\nand action since the dawn of the Cold War in 1947 and, in France, was\nwidely disseminated via Communist Party schools and literature. While\npolitical and philosophical change were slow to occur in the French\nCommunist Party, by the late 1950s, many intellectuals associated with\nthe Party began to ask questions about what constitutes the core of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy and about how this philosophy guides, relates\nto, or allows for political action.\n\nFor many of these intellectuals, answering this question meant a\nreturn to Marx\u2019s early work (those texts written before 1845) in\nthe hopes of finding the \u201ckey\u201d to his philosophy. In\npieces like \u201cContribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Right\u201d (1844), and the Economic and\nPhilosophic Manuscripts (1844), these thinkers found and\nchampioned a Marx obviously indebted to a Hegelian dialectical\nunderstanding of subjectivity and historical development and deeply\nconcerned about ending human alienation. It is to this\nproject\u2014that of finding the true method, aim, and intent of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy in his early work\u2019s emphasis on the\nrealization of full human freedom and potentials through dialectical\nhistorical change\u2014that Althusser made the first of his public\n\u201cinterventions\u201d into Marxist philosophy. He inaugurated\nthis effort with the essay \u201cOn the Young Marx\u201d (1961),\nwhich sought to demonstrate that this method of looking to\nMarx\u2019s early work for the key to his philosophy was\nmethodologically suspect and ideologically driven. Further, in this\nessay and in subsequent work, he developed an alternate method of\ninvestigation or \u201creading\u201d that would allow Marx\u2019s\ntrue philosophy to be revealed in its purity.\n\nFrom the fruits of this new method of reading, Althusser argued that\nnot only was Marx the originator of a new philosophy, Dialectical\nMaterialism, that had nothing to do with its Hegelian and Feuerbachian\npredecessors, but that he also founded a new science, Historical\nMaterialism, which broke with and superseded such ideological and\npre-scientific precursors as the political economics of Smith and\nRicardo. For the most part, the essays collected in For Marx\n(1965) and the seminar papers issued as Reading Capital\n(1965) develop and utilize this method of reading in order to justify\nand describe Marxist philosophy and Marxist science as well as to\ndistinguish between these two theoretical activities. In so doing,\nAlthusser says quite a bit about the nature of knowledge and the\ngeneral relations between philosophy, science, politics, and ideology.\nFurther, Althusser applies this hermeneutic method to argue against\nwhat he labeled \u201cempiricist\u201d understandings of Marx. These\nincluded the Humanist interpretations of Marx described above as well\nas variations on the orthodox Marxist-Leninist theory, which specified\nthe strict determination of culture and history by the existing modes\nof economic exchange and resulting class struggles. The following\nparagraphs discuss this theory of reading, how it produces a different\nunderstanding of Marx\u2019s philosophy than that which is derived\nfrom Humanist and Economist readings, and how it informs his\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, and political\nphilosophy.\n3.1 Hermeneutic Theory\n\nThe label that Althusser gave to the method by which he approached\nMarx\u2019s texts was that of a \u201csymptomatic reading.\u201d\nInstead of looking back at Marx\u2019s early work in order to find\nthe \u201cessence\u201d of his philosophy, one of whose expressions\nwas Capital, and also instead of trying to build a true or\nconsistent theory out of Marx\u2019s oeuvre by explaining away\ncontradictions within it and noting certain passages as key, Althusser\nargued that Marx\u2019s true philosophy was largely absent from his\nwork prior to 1845. Even in mature texts such as Capital,\nAlthusser maintained that Marx\u2019s philosophy remained largely\nimplicit, as the background system of concepts which allowed the\nscientific work Marx was involved in generating to take place. The\nsymptomatic method of reading was designed to make these concepts\nexplicit and \u201cto establish the indispensable minimum for the\nconsistent existence of Marxist philosophy\u201d\n(1965a [2005], 35).\n\nThe three inspirations Althusser gave for this interpretive method\nwere those provided by Spinoza, Freud by way of Lacan, and that\nprovided by Marx himself. In addition, he added to these examples\ninsights from the French tradition of historical epistemology about\nthe way in which sciences come to be constituted. One of the ideas\nborrowed from Spinoza was the contention that texts and authors are\nthe products of their times and that the thoughts authors set down on\nthe page cannot help but be a part of, and be affected by, the\nideological currents that accompany and allow for the satisfaction of\nneeds in a specific era. So then, similar to the way in which Spinoza\nargued in the Theological Political-Treatise that by engaging\nin a materialist historical study of the Bible one could disentangle\nthose prophetic laws and commands which were merely the result of\ntemporal exigencies and the prophet\u2019s imagination from those\nwhich represented the true word of God, so Althusser argued that one\ncould disentangle those concepts which were merely ideological in\nMarx\u2019s texts from those which comprised his true philosophy.\n\nThough this theory was later to be complicated and revised, during\nthis period, Althusser consistently argued that Marx\u2019s work\nprior to 1845 was ideological and that it was saturated with\nnon-Marxian concepts borrowed from Hegel\u2019s and Feuerbach\u2019s\nphilosophical anthropologies. Althusser did recognize that some of\nMarx\u2019s early work is marked by its rejection of idealist\npremises and concepts. However, inasmuch as this early work was seen\nto espouse a telic view of humanity in which the individual and\nsociety was said to undergo a necessary historico-dialectical\ndevelopment, Althusser identified it as fundamentally Hegelian. That\nthere was a materialist correction to this basic narrative with\nMarx\u2019s embrace of Feuerbach, Althusser also granted. However,\nthe replacement by Marx of a speculative anthropology which saw the\nhistorical development of society as the self-fulfillment of human\nfreedom with a materialist anthropology that cited the same logic of\ndevelopment but which specified that the motor of this development was\nhuman beings in their \u201csensuous life activity,\u201d was seen\nby Althusser to represent little conceptual and no logical advance\nfrom Hegel.\n\nThis \u201ctheory of the break,\u201d which held that Marx\u2019s\nearly work was Hegelian and ideological and that, after a decisive\nrupture in 1845 and then a long period of transition between\n1845\u20131857, his work became recognizably Marxist and scientific,\nwould seem to indicate that all one has to do to understand\nMarx\u2019s philosophy is to read this mature work. However, the\nactual case is not so simple. While reading Capital and other\nlate works is necessary for understanding Marx\u2019s philosophy, it\nis not sufficient. It is not sufficient, Althusser argued, because,\neven in his post-1857 writings, Marx provides no systematic exposition\nof his epistemology or his ideas about social structure, history, and\nhuman nature, all of which were necessary for Marxist\nphilosophy\u2019s consistent and continuing existence.\n\nMany interpreters of Marx, and not just those Althusser directly\nengaged with during the early 1960s, have maintained that such texts\nas the 1859 Preface and the 1844 Manuscripts provide\nkeys to understanding Marx\u2019s philosophy. However, Althusser made\nthe case that these texts were contradictory and insufficient for this\npurpose. It is with this contention that the models provided by\npsychoanalysis and by Marx\u2019s own critique of classical political\neconomy come to inform Althusser\u2019s overall hermeneutic strategy.\nPart of this strategy, Althusser maintains, is directly taken from\nMarx\u2019s own method. Thus, in a way parallel to Marx pointing out\nin Capital V.II (1885) that Adam Smith needed the concept of\nthe \u201cvalue of labor\u201d for his explanations of capitalist\neconomic activity but could not fully generate it out of the systems\nof ideas available to him, Althusser argued that, though Marx was\nrecognizably engaged in the work of Historical Materialism in\nCapital, the philosophical theory or background conceptual\nframework that allowed this investigation to proceed was not fully\narticulated.\n\nThe explicit project of Reading Capital and of many of the\nessays included in For Marx was to make these fundamental\nconcepts explicit. It was to do so by paying attention to the\ntheoretical \u201cproblematic,\u201d or background ideological\nframework in which the work was generated, by analyzing those passages\nwhere a philosophical concept had to have been in use but was not made\nexplicit, and by noting and explaining where and why one theoretical\npronouncement is in contradiction with itself or with another passage.\nFor Althusser, such areas of Marx\u2019s text are\n\u201csymptoms,\u201d in the psychoanalytic sense of the word, of\nthe necessary but unarticulated philosophical framework that\nunderwrites and allows his scientific investigations. Of these\nframeworks, Marx was not fully conscious. However, they were what\nallowed him to investigate and describe such socio-economic events as\nthe transformation of money into capital without recourse to Hegelian\nlogic and concepts. Althusser argues that by paying attention to these\npassages in Marx\u2019s text as well as by seeking out Marxist\nconcepts as these were developed during the course of practical\nMarxist activity by theorists such as Lenin and Mao, an attentive\nreader can render explicit Marx\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThat the concepts Althusser derived from his symptomatic reading of\nMarx, Lenin, and Mao were Marxist concepts was avowed. Nevertheless,\nAlthusser also acknowledged that some of the concepts found latent in\nthese texts were derived from and consistent with his philosophical\nand social scientific contemporaries as well as with those of Spinoza.\nOf course, this is not inconsistent with the theory of reading and\nauthorship that underwrites a symptomatic reading of a text. Inasmuch\nas authors and readers are always said to think with concepts borrowed\nfrom or supplied by the problematic that they inhabit, there is no\nsuch thing as an innocent or objective reading: we understand things\nwith and through the concepts available to us. Perhaps nowhere is this\nborrowing more evident than in Althusser\u2019s ideas about how\nscientific and philosophic knowledge is generated. Though Althusser is\nvery careful to back up his arguments about Marx\u2019s epistemology\nwith close analyses of Marx\u2019s work, it is apparent that the\nmodel for knowledge acquisition that is developed in Reading\nCapital owes much to Spinoza and to the French tradition of\nhistorical epistemology.\n3.2 Epistemology and Philosophy of Science\n\nWith his re-reading of Marx, Althusser wished to offer an alternative\nto the two then dominant understandings of Marx\u2019s philosophy.\nBoth understandings were charged with the same mistake. This mistake\nwas, fundamentally, an epistemological one: each cast Marx as an\nempiricist. At first glance, this charge might seem ridiculous. This\nis especially the case as, according to Althusser\u2019s own\ncritique, both understandings of Marx offered variants of the Hegelian\nclaim that there is a reason to history. For Althusser, however, both\nreadings were \u201cempiricist\u201d inasmuch as each ascribed to\nMarx a theory of knowledge in which the subject, by means of a process\nof observation and abstraction, comes to know what an object really\nand truly is, according to its essence. This is a definition of\nempiricism meant to include philosophers as diverse as Locke, Kant,\nand Hegel and traditions as varied as British Empiricism, German\nIdealism, Positivism, and Pragmatism. In the case of Humanist Marxism,\nthe object that comes to be known by its essence is the human subject\nin its full freedom. It does so by means of critique and by creatively\novercoming that which is alien to it or \u201cmerely\nhistorical.\u201d In the case of orthodox Marxism-Leninism, this\nobject is the economy, the reality that underlies, causes, and can\nexplain all historical structures and transformations. The economy\ncomes to be known as it truly is only by the proletariat, by those\nwhom the historical process has endowed with an objective gaze and who\npossess the ability to make this truth objective.\n\nIn opposition to the empiricist model of knowledge production,\nAlthusser proposes that true or scientific knowledge is distinguished\nfrom ideology or opinion not by dint of an historical subject having\nabstracted the essence of an object from its appearances. Instead,\nthis knowledge is understood to be produced by a process internal to\nscientific knowledge itself. Though this transformation takes place\nentirely in thought, Althusser does not maintain that scientific\nknowledge makes no use of facts. However, these facts or materials are\nnever brute. Rather, specific sciences start with pre-existing\nconcepts or genera such as \u201chumors,\u201d\n\u201cunemployment,\u201d \u201cquasars,\u201d or\n\u201cirrational numbers.\u201d These genera may be ideological in\npart or in whole. Science\u2019s job is to render these concepts\nscientific. This labor is what Althusser terms \u201ctheoretical\npractice.\u201d The result of this practice is scientific knowledge.\nScientific knowledge is produced by means of applying to these genera\nthe body of concepts or \u201ctheory\u201d that the science\npossesses for understanding them. This body of concepts may be more or\nless unified and consistent and it may be more or less consciously\narticulated. Further, the sum of the individual concepts that this\ntheory consists of delimits the possible ways in which the genera that\na science begins with can be understood.\n\nWhen applied, a science\u2019s theory weeds out ideological notions\nassociated with the original concept or genera. The result of this\napplication of theory to genera is the transformation of the\n\u201cideological generality into a scientific generality\u201d\n(1963b [2005], 185). An example of such a process is the\ntransformation in medical science of a concept like \u201cphlegmatic\nhumors\u201d into the idea of blood-borne pathogens by dint of the\ntheory of circulation and infectious disease. Once generated, such\nscientific concepts inform regular scientific practice, allowing\nspecific research programs within an individual science to progress.\nAlthusser himself gives examples of three such major transformations.\nThe first is the founding of modern physics by Galileo, the other that\nof Greek mathematics, and the third, that of Marx\u2019s founding of\nthe science of Historical Materialism out of Classical Political\nEconomy. Each of these foundings is marked by what Althusser terms an\n\u201cepistemological break,\u201d or a period when ideological\nconcepts are replaced by scientific ones. Any similarity here to\nKuhnian ideas about revolutionary and normal science is not\nsurprising. Both Canguilhem and Bachelard, from whom Althusser drew\ninspiration for his theory, were part of a dialogue that took in the\nwork of Alexander Koyr\u00e9 on scientific revolutions, a thinker\nfrom whom Kuhn, in turn, drew his inspiration.\n\nAlthusser\u2019s debt to the tradition of French historical\nepistemology in this account of knowledge production and philosophy of\nscience should now be evident. However, this epistemology\u2019s\nMarxian and Spinozistic elements may be less pronounced. The\nvocabulary adopted above to express this theory, however, gestures to\nboth influences. For Althusser, Marx\u2019s founding of the science\nof history is crucial not only to politics (as will be addressed\nbelow) but also to understanding all of human activity, including\nscientific activity. That there is a circular logic to this\nepistemological theory, Althusser readily admits, for it is only the\nscience of Historical Materialism that allows us to understand\nscientific practice in general. Althusser, though, is comfortable with\nthis circularity. This is because, insofar as this understanding of\nscientific practice in general allows us to understand how individual\nsciences produce their knowledge, Historical Materialism is a science\nthat functions like any other.\n\nFor Althusser, the concept that helps to produce this understanding of\nscientific practices is that of the \u201cmode of production.\u201d\nWith it, he argues, Marx supplied theorists with an idea sufficient to\ncomprehend the way in which we materially produce our selves, our\nenvironments, our knowledges, and our histories. Indeed, this concept\nmakes it possible to analyze all of our activities in their\nspecificity and to understand them in their relation to the totality\nof which they are a part. As it must be if we are to make sense of\nscientific practice as one aspect of the total mode of production,\nmuch more than the activity of economic production must be included in\nthis totality of productive practices. Added by Althusser to these two\naspects of the mode of production are those of ideological, political,\nand philosophical production, among others.\n\nIn each of the practices that together comprise, at any given time, a\nspecific mode of production, some form or forms of labor uses the\nexisting means of production to transform existing materials into new\nproducts. According to Althusser, this realization is Marx\u2019s\nbasic insight. In scientific production, for example, thinkers use\nexisting theories to transform existing concepts into new, scientific\nconcepts. However, and this is where Althusser\u2019s Spinozism\nbecomes apparent and also where he breaks with economistic\nunderstandings of Marx, it is not the case that the analysis of any\none mode of production within the totality of productive practices is\ncapable of generating an understanding of the way in which all rest of\nthe productive processes are causally determined. Rather, and in line\nwith the parallelism attributed by Leibniz to Spinoza, as each\nproductive process transforms a unique material (concepts in science,\ngoods in economics, social relations in politics), each process can\nonly be understood in terms of its unique causal structure. In\naddition, and again also in a way similar to Spinoza\u2019s account\nof substance as seen from different aspects, each productive process\nis understood to stand in relation to and play a part of a complexly\nstructured whole, none of which is reducible to being the simple or\nessential cause of the others.\n\nThat Althusser regards most, if not all, human activity as consisting\nof material processes of production and reproduction can be used as a\nkey to understanding other parts of his philosophy. These include his\nthoughts on the structure of the social and political world, the\nhistorical process, and philosophy. As philosophy is closely related\nto science and because it is charged with a task that allows the\nproduction of knowledge about the other socio-economic practices to be\ngenerated, it is probably best to start with Althusser\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy as a material practice of production\nbefore proceeding to a discussion of how Althusser understands the\nother practices listed above.\n3.3 The Role of Philosophy\n\nAccording to Althusser, most activity labeled \u201cphilosophy\u201d\nis really a type of ideological production. By this, he means to say\nthat most philosophy reproduces, in highly abstract form, notions\nabout the world whose effect is to sustain existing socio-economic\nrelations. As such, philosophy merely reflects the background values,\nattitudes, and ideas that allow the socio-economic world to function.\nHowever, for Althusser, genuine philosophy functions as a\n\u201cTheory of theoretical practice\u201d (1965b). In this mode, it\nworks to provide an aid to scientific practice by distinguishing\nbetween ideological concepts and scientific ones as well as by\nclarifying and rendering consistent the scientific concepts that\nenable a science to transforms existing ideas into scientific\nknowledge.\n\nFor Althusser, it is not necessary that this process of distinction\nand clarification be accomplished before a specific theoretical\npractice can generate scientific knowledge. In fact, scientific\nactivity often proceeds without a clear understanding of the concepts\nthat allow it to produce its knowledge. Indeed, Althusser maintained\nthat this was Marx\u2019s lot when he was writing Capital:\nscientific knowledge of the capitalist economic system was being\nproduced, but Marx did not possess a full awareness of the concepts\nallowing this production. According to this definition of philosophy\nas the Theory of theoretical practice, Althusser\u2019s re-reading of\nCapital and other texts was philosophical insofar as it was\nable to name and distinguish the concepts that allowed Marx\u2019s\nscientific analysis of history to proceed.\n3.4 Marxist Philosophy\n\nThe latent concepts rendered explicit by the practice of symptomatic\nreading were said by Althusser to constitute the theory of Dialectical\nMaterialism, or what is the same thing, Marx\u2019s philosophy. With\nthese concepts made explicit, Althusser believed that Marxist science,\nor Historical Materialism, could employ them in order to achieve\nbetter analyses of specific modes of production and better\nunderstandings of the opportunities that specific modes of production\npresented for political change. Some of these concepts have already\nbeen articulated in the discussion of the mode of production above,\nbut without being named. To label these concepts and then to add some\nmore, the idea that each individual productive process or element\nstands in relation to and plays a part of a complexly structured\nwhole, none of which is reducible to being the simple or essential\ncause of the others, is what Althusser terms the idea of\n\u201cstructural causality.\u201d This concept, in turn, is closely\nrelated to the idea of \u201coverdetermination\u201d or the theory\nthat every element in the total productive process constituting a\nhistorical moment is determined by all the others.\n\nAnother Marxist philosophical concept that allows the historical\nmaterialist scientist to understand the logic of a specific mode of\nproduction is that of \u201ccontradiction.\u201d This is the idea\nthat, at any given period, multiple, concrete and definite practices\ntake place within a mode of production. Among and within these\nspecific practices, there may or may not be tensions. To take an\nexample from Marx\u2019s chapter on \u201cPrimitive\nAccumulation\u201d in Capital V.I, at the same time as\npeasants holdings were being expropriated in the late 15th\nand early 16th centuries by a nascent bourgeoisie, the\nchurch and the aristocracy were passing laws against this\nappropriation. Any isolable element of the total structure, be it a\nperson, a social class, an institution, or the state, in some way\nreflects and embodies these practices and these antagonisms and as\nsuch each is said to be \u201coverdetermined.\u201d Further,\nAlthusser specifies that the development of productive practices\nwithin a specific mode of production is often \u201cuneven\u201d in\naddition to possibly being antagonistic. This means, for instance,\nthat some economic elements within a whole may be more or less\ncapitalistic while others simultaneously operate according to\nsocialist norms. Thus, the development within a mode of production of\nthe practices specific to it is not necessarily homogenous or\nlinear.\n\nAdded to the Marxian concepts of structural causality, contradiction,\nuneven development, and overdetermination is that of the\n\u201cstructure in dominance.\u201d This concept designates that\nmajor element in a structural whole that tends to organize all of the\nother practices. In much of the contemporary world and inasmuch as it\ntends to organize the production of moral values, scientific\nknowledge, the family, art, etc. this structure is the economic\npractice of commodity production and consumption. However, in another\nera and in other places, it may be the production and dissemination of\nreligious beliefs and practices that dominates and organizes the\nsocio-economic structure.\n3.5 Social and Political Philosophy, Historiography\n\nWith this understanding of the elements that compose any\nsocio-economic structure and their relations made explicit, something\ncan now be said about the social and political philosophies that\nfollow from it. First, with the idea that human individuals are merely\none of the sites at which the contradictory productive forces that\ncharacterize an era are enacted, Althusser signals that the primary\nobject of social philosophy is not the human individual. Second, with\nthe idea that the state produced by political activity is merely one\nproductive process among others, Althusser signals that the primary\nelement in political philosophy is not the state. Though both states\nand individuals are important elements of the socio-economic whole,\nnothing philosophical is learned by examining the essence of the\nindividual or the way in which justice is embodied by the state.\n\nAs Althusser understands them, whatever conceptions we have of the\nnature of human beings or about the proper function of the state are\nhistorically generated and serve to reproduce existing social\nrelations. In other words, they are ideological. Apart from the\nnecessity of human beings to engage in productive relations with other\nhuman beings and with their environment in order to produce their\nmeans of subsistence, there is no human nature or essence. This is the\ncore of Althusser\u2019s \u201canti-humanist\u201d position.\nFurther, though some order must exist in order to allow for the\nproduction and reproduction of social life, there is no essential or\nbest form that this order must take. This is not to say that human\nbeings do not conceive of or strive for the best order for social life\nor that they do not believe that they are essentially free or equal\nand deserving of rights. It also does not mean that all of our ideas\nare homogenous and that heterogeneous ideas about what is best cannot\nexist side by side in the same system without leading to conflict\n(though they sometimes do). However, the science of Historical\nMaterialism has revealed the desire for such orders to be historically\ngenerated along with the ideas about human nature that justify\nthem.\n\nThis account of the ideological role of our conceptions of human\nnature and of the best political arrangement shows Althusser to differ\nlittle from interpretations of Marx which hold that political\nideologies are the product of and serve existing economic relations.\nHowever, and as was detailed above, Althusser rejects the simple\nunderstanding of causality offered by this model in which economic\npractices order consciousness and our cultural practices. He also\nrejects the philosophy of history that often accompanies this model.\nThis philosophy has it that certain economic practices not only\ngenerate corresponding cultural practices, but that there is a pattern\nto economic development in which each economic order inexorably leads\nto its own demise and replacement by a different economic system. In\nthis understanding of history, feudalism must lead to capitalism and\ncapitalism to socialism. Althusser, however, argues against the idea\nthat history has a subject (such as the economy or human agency) and\nthat history has a goal (such as communism or human freedom). History,\nfor Althusser, is a process without a subject. There are patterns and\norders to historical life and there is historical change. However,\nthere is no necessity to any of these transformations and history does\nnot necessarily progress. Transformations do occur. However, they do\nso only when the contradictions and levels of development inherent in\na mode of production allow for such change.\n4. Revisions (1966\u201378)\n\nFrom the time of its initial dissemination, Althusser\u2019s\nre-reading of Marx was met by almost equal amounts of enthusiasm and\ncastigation. For every reader who found in his prose an explanation of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy and science that rendered Marx philosophically\nrespectable and offered renewed hope for Marxist theory, there were\ncritics who judged his work to be idealist, Stalinist, dogmatist, or\nexcessively structuralist, among myriad other charges. Though many of\nthe initial reactions were contradictory and evidenced\nmisunderstandings of what Althusser was up to, compelling criticisms\nwere also offered. One was that Althusser was only able to offer his\nreading by ignoring much of what Marx actually wrote about his logic\nand about the concepts important to his analysis. Another criticism,\nand one voiced to Althusser by leaders of the French Communist Party,\nwas that Althusser\u2019s reading of Marx offered little on the\nrelationship between Marxist theory and Marxist political\npractice.\n\nIt took a long time before Althusser explicitly addressed the charge\nthat he had ignored much of what Marx had to say about his own logic\nand concepts. However, buffeted by these criticisms and with a sense\nthat there were idealist or \u201ctheoreticist\u201d tendencies in\nhis reading of Marx and that the relationship between theory and\npractice was indeed under-developed, Althusser set out during the late\n1960s and 1970s to correct and revise his take on the relationships\namong philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. To some readers,\nthese revisions represented a politically motivated betrayal of his\ntheoretical accomplishments. For others, they simply revealed his\nproject as a whole to be untenable and self-contradictory. Some recent\ncritics, however, have argued that these revisions are consistent with\nand necessary to the development of what they view to be the overall\ngoal of Althusser\u2019s work: the development of a materialist\npolitical philosophy adequate for political practice.\n4.1 The Relationship between Theory and Practice\n\nAlthusser\u2019s initial revisions to his understanding of the social\nstructure and knowledge production were informed by a renewed\nattention to the works of Lenin and by a seminar he convened at the\nENS in 1967 for leading scientists and interested students. This\ncourse resulted in a series of papers, gathered together as\nPhilosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists\n(1967a), in which Althusser began rethinking the relations among\nphilosophy, science, ideology, and politics. Though this revision was\nlater to be made more explicit, one of the most striking aspects of\nthese papers was Althusser\u2019s abandonment of the Spinozistic\nclaim that the different levels of theoretical practice were\nautonomous. He now maintained that there was no criterion sufficient\nto demarcate scientific from ideological concepts and that all\ntheoretical concepts are marked by ideology. This did not mean,\nhowever, that any concept was as good as any other. Scientists,\nthrough their work on the material real, tended to generate better\nunderstandings of things than were available intuitively. Further, he\nargued that philosophy still had a role to play in the clarification\nof scientific concepts. This is the case because, no matter how much\nwork scientists do to understand the material real and to generate\nbetter concepts, they must always employ ideological concepts to frame\ntheir investigations and its results. Marxist philosophers, he\nmaintained, could be useful to scientists by pointing out, from the\nstandpoint of politics and by the method of historical critique, where\nand how some of the concepts scientists employed were ideological. The\nresult of this intervention of philosophy into politics would not be\n\u201ctruer\u201d concepts, but ideas that were more\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d in both the normative and\npositive senses of these words.\n\nParallel to this move, and motivated by the need to provide the link\nbetween philosophical theory and political practice that was largely\nmissing from his classic work, Althusser now argued that philosophy\nhad a useful role to play between politics and science. Political\npractice, Althusser maintained, was mostly motivated by ideological\nunderstandings of what the good is and how to accomplish it. Though he\ndid not argue that there was a way to leave ideology behind and to\nreveal the good in itself, he did maintain that science could help to\ncorrect ideological thinking about political means and ends. Social\nscience in particular could do so by showing how certain goals were\nimpossible or misguided given present socio-economic relations and by\nsuggesting that, at a certain time and in a certain place, other means\nand other ends might be more fruitfully adopted and pursued. As\nscientific knowledge does not speak directly to the public or to\npoliticians, Althusser assigned materialist philosophers the job of\ncommunicating scientific knowledge of the material real, its\nconditions, and its possibilities to politicians and the public. If\nthis communication is successful, Althusser maintained, one should not\nexpect all political activity to be successful. Instead, one should\nexpect a modest shift from an idealist ideology to one that is\nmaterialist and more scientific and which has a better chance of\nrealizing its goals.\n4.2 Theory of Ideology\n\nDuring the 1970s, Althusser continued the revisions begun in 1967 and\nelaborated other Marxian ideas he believed to be underdeveloped.\nPerhaps the best known of the new conceptual formulations resulting\nfrom these efforts is that of \u201cideological\ninterpellation.\u201d This account of how a human being becomes a\nself-conscious subject was published in an essay titled\n\u201cIdeology and Ideological State Apparatuses\u201d (1970). It\nwas excerpted from a larger essay titled \u201cOn the Reproduction of\nCapitalism.\u201d This work analyzed the necessary relationship\nbetween state and subject such that a given economic mode of\nproduction might subsist. It includes not only an analysis of the\nstate and its legal and educational systems but also of the\npsychological relationship which exists between subject and state as\nideology. This narrative of subjectification was intended to help\nadvance Althusser\u2019s argument that regimes or states are able to\nmaintain control by reproducing subjects who believe that their\nposition within the social structure is a natural one. Ideology, or\nthe background ideas that we possess about the way in which the world\nmust function and of how we function within it is, in this account,\nunderstood to be always present. Specific socio-economic structures,\nhowever, require particular ideologies. These ideologies are\ninstantiated by institutions or \u201cIdeological State\nApparatuses\u201d like family, schools, church, etc., which provide\nthe developing subject with categories in which she can recognize\nherself. Inasmuch as a person does so and embraces the practices\nassociated with those institutions, she has been successfully\n\u201chailed\u201d or \u201cinterpellated\u201d and recognized\nherself as that subject who does those kinds of things. As the effect\nof these recognitions is to continue existing social relations,\nAlthusser argued that a Dictatorship of the Proletariat is necessary\nso that Ideological State Apparatuses productive of the bourgeois\nsubject can be replaced with those productive of proletarian or\ncommunist subjects.\n 4.3 Aesthetic Theory\n\nAlthusser\u2019s engagement with aesthetic theory was not nearly\nso consistent as those with philosophy of science and social\nphilosophy. However, dramaturgical speculations from the\nearly 1960s were crucial to the development of his method of\nsymptomatic reading and forays into the criticism of\nvisual art beginning in the mid-1960s likewise proved of decisive\nimportance for the development of his theory of ideology. In\nparticular, Althusser\u2019s Brechtian musings on aesthetics\nprovide partial answers to the question of how criticism\nof ideological notions of the real as well as the\ndevelopment of revolutionary strategy is possible. Althusser does\nnot argue that art provides a glimpse of actual social conditions\nunfiltered by ideology. Indeed, he argues that art mostly\nreproduces ideology. Further, there is no formal way\nto distinguish between a work of art and other cultural\nproductions like advertising. A person can \u201csees\nherself\u201d in a pick-up truck advertisement as easily as a\nsubject can mis-recognize herself as the subject of a drama.\nHowever, some art, that which Althusser\ndeems \u201cauthentic\u201d (1996a), troubles a subject\u2019s\nusual relationship between herself and the world. This habitual\nrelation is one where the world is always seen to conform to and\nto confirm the subject\u2019s view of \u201cthe way\nthings are\u201d. Authentic art though makes felt or known the\ndistance between the real world and a subject\u2019s\nhabitual ideological view of it. In this moment, the space for\ncriticism, investigation, and, perhaps, the possibility for\nacting to change the world is inaugurated.\n\n\n4.4 Marx\u2019s Philosophy Redux\n\nIn 1978 and as a response to what he saw, yet again, as the\ntheoretical and political misdirection of the Communist movement,\nAlthusser authored a piece, \u201cMarx in his Limits,\u201d which\nwas intended to separate the good from the bad in Marx\u2019s\nphilosophy. In his classic work (1960\u201365), Althusser had tried to\naccomplish this goal by separating out ideological concepts and by\nbringing forth the scientific ones. However, in \u201cMarx in his\nLimits,\u201d he now argued that such a method of separation cannot\nwork because\u2014within Marx\u2019s writings and throughout his\noeuvre\u2014both good and bad, materialist and idealist concepts, are\nhopelessly intermixed and many are underdeveloped.\n\nInasmuch as Althusser admits in this piece that Marx never fully\nabandoned Hegel\u2019s logic, the concept of human alienation, or the\nidea that history has a goal, the inventory Althusser offers can be\nseen as an assenting response to the charge that he had ignored\nMarx\u2019s explicit statements in order to imagine for Marx a\nconsistent and \u201ctrue\u201d philosophy. Althusser does not give\nup on the task of articulating a better Marxist philosophy, however.\nInstead, he argues that there is another, \u201cmaterialist\u201d\ncriterion that allows us to see the limits of Marx\u2019s thinking\nand to recognize those points in his work where Marx was unable to\ntranscend his bourgeois background and his education in German\nIdealism. This criterion is that of the practical success or failure\nof Marx\u2019s concepts as each has been employed in the history of\nMarxist movements. When we have made this inventory and grouped\ntogether the successful concepts, what we are left with is a\nmaterialist Marxism, a Marxism which endorses the scientific method as\nthe best way for understanding ourselves and our potential but that\nalso understands that this method is fallible. Remaining also is a\nMarxism which does not subscribe to any philosophy of history and\nwhich certainly does not maintain that capitalism will inevitably lead\nto communism. This Marxism has no system of interrelated concepts that\nguarantee a scientific analysis. Further, it possesses no worked-out\ntheory of the relations between economic structures and cultural\nstructures but for that limited knowledge which scientific practice\nprovides. Finally, this Marxism has given up the dream of analyzing\nthe whole of culture and its movement from the outside; it realizes\nthat one thinks inside and about the culture one inhabits in order to\npossibly effect and change that culture.\n5. Late work (1980\u20131986): Aleatory Materialism\n\nAfter being interrupted by ill health and by the events following from\nthe murder of his wife, in 1982 Althusser returned to the question of\nwhat was essential to Marx\u2019s philosophy and expanded the scope\nof this inquiry to include speculation about the metaphysics that must\nunderlie it. Freed by his ignoble status from the task of influencing\nthe direction of the Communist movement, the texts associated with\nthis project and gathered together in the book Philosophy of the\nEncounter differ tremendously in subject matter, style, and\nmethod from his other writings. Whether these texts represent a\ncontinuation of, or even the key to his philosophy or whether they are\nan aberration is presently being debated in the secondary literature.\nHowever, as there is strong textural and archival evidence that many\nof the ideas explicitly expressed in these works had been gestating\nfor a long time, the contention that these writings are of a piece\nwith his earlier work seems to be gaining ground.\n\nThe principal thesis of Althusser\u2019s last philosophical writings\nis that there exists an \u201cunderground\u201d or little recognized\ntradition in the history of philosophy. Variously labeled a\n\u201cmaterialism of the encounter\u201d or \u201caleatory\nmaterialism,\u201d the method which he uses to articulate this\nphilosophy is to simply comment upon works by philosophers who\nexemplify this current and to point out where, how, and to what extent\nthey do so. In addition to Marx, the philosophers that he cites as\nbeing part of this underground tradition include Democritus, Epicurus,\nLucretius, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Montesquieu,\nHeidegger, Wittgenstein, and Derrida. From these readings in the\nhistory of philosophy, Althusser aims to suggest that this tradition\nexists and that it is both philosophically fecund and viable. He also\nwishes to return to and bolster the thesis he first ventured in the\nlate 1960s that there are really only two positions in philosophy:\nmaterialism and idealism. As he understood it, the two tendencies are\nalways in a war of opposition with the one functioning to reinforce\nthe status quo and the other to possibly overcome it.\n\nPerhaps because it functions in opposition to the idealist tendency in\nphilosophy, aleatory materialism is marked almost as much by its\nrejections as it is by the positive claims it contains about the world\nand about history. As Marx is included within this tradition, it is\nnot surprising that many of these rejections are also attributed to\nhim during the course of Althusser\u2019s earlier work. These include\na dismissal of what Althusser calls \u201cthe principle of\nReason,\u201d or the idea that the universe or history has an origin\nor an end. With this prohibition, Althusser means to exclude from this\ntradition not only the usual suspects in the rationalist tradition,\nbut also mechanical and dialectical materialisms with their logics of\ndetermination. Also dismissed, he maintains, is the myth that somehow\nphilosophy and philosophers are autonomous, that they see the world\nfrom outside and objectively. Though there is an objective world,\nphilosophy does not have knowledge of this world as its object for\nthere is no way for it to ground itself and the material it thinks\nwith and through arises historically. Philosophy is therefore not a\nscience or the Science of sciences and it produces no universal Truth.\nRather, the truths it produces are contingent and are offered in\nopposition to other competing truths. If philosophy does have an\nobject, it is the void, or that which is not yet but which could\nbe.\n\nThat the philosophy of the encounter lacks an object does not mean\nthat it lacks positive propositions. However, given the\nepistemological status attributed to philosophy by Althusser, these\nmetaphysical propositions or \u201ctheses\u201d are true only\ninsofar as they have explanatory or practical value. First among them,\nfollowing Democritus, is the thesis that matter is all that exists.\nSecond is the thesis that chance or the aleatory is at the origin of\nall worlds. That the patterns which constitute and define these worlds\ncan be known, described, and predicted according to certain laws or\nreasons is also true. However, the fact that these worlds ever came to\nbe organized in these patterns is aleatory and the patterns themselves\ncan only ever be known immanently. Third, new worlds and new orders\nthemselves arise out of chance encounters between pre-existing\nmaterial elements. Whether or not such orders emerge is contingent:\nthey do not have to occur. When material elements collide, they either\n\u201ctake\u201d and a new order is founded, or they do not and the\nold world continues.\n\nTo Althusser, the propositions which have explanatory value at the\nlevel of ontology and cosmology also have value at the level of\npolitical philosophy. After first citing Rousseau and Hobbes as\nexample of philosophers who recognized that the origin and continued\nexistence of political orders is contingent, Althusser turns to\nMachiavelli and Marx for his principal examples of how aleatory\nmaterialism functions in the political realm. The anti-teleological,\nscientistic, and anti-humanist, Marxist philosophy developed by\nAlthusser over the course of his career works well with the\nmaterialist metaphysics recounted above. In this understanding of\nMarxist philosophy, societies and subjects are seen as patterns of\nactivity that behave in predictable ways. Though scientists may study\nand describe these orders in their specificity, it does not at first\nappear that philosophy can do much except to categorize these\ninteractions at the most general level. However, citing Marx\u2019s\nwork again and taking inspiration from Machiavelli\u2019s project of\ninstalling \u201ca new prince in a new principality,\u201d Althusser\nargues that the materialist philosopher may accomplish somewhat more\nthan this with her descriptions, critiques, and predictions. This is\nbecause, by examining a political order not from the perspective of\nits necessity but with an awareness of its contingency, this\nphilosopher may be able think the possibility of its transformation.\nIf chance smiles on her, if someone listens and if effects occur, then\nelements might recombine and a new political might take hold. This is,\nto be sure, a very limited and unpredictable power attributed to the\nphilosopher. However, it is also the only one that Althusser in his\nlate works argues is adequate for political practice and that does\nnot, like idealism, merely serve to reproduce existing relations.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nThe following list owes much to the comprehensive bibliography of\nAlthusser\u2019s work compiled by Gregory Elliott in <em>Althusser:\nThe Detour of Theory</em>, New York: Verso, 2006 [1987].</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "(1940\u201345) <em>Journal de captivit\u00e9 (Stalag XA\n1940\u201345)</em>, (Paris: Stock/IMEC, 1992)", "(1946) \u201cL\u2019internationale des bons sentiments\u201d,\nin <em>Ecrits Philosophiques et Politiques I</em> (Paris: Stock/IMEC\n1994), 35\u201357; tr. as \u201cThe International of Decent\nFeelings,\u201d by G.M.
