Such a point was made already by E.A. Milne in 1935, and\nthen independently by Charles Misner in 1969. In particular, Misner\nreplaces the time parameter t with the negative of its\nlogarithm (i.e., \u2212log t) in order to assuage worries that\na bounded time parameter makes no sense. According to Misner (1969,\n1331), even in models that begin with singularities, \u201cthe\nUniverse is meaningfully infinitely old because infinitely many things\nhave happened since the beginning.\u201d Interestingly,\nMisner\u2019s move can hardly be motivated by a desire to obviate the\nneed for a creator: Misner is a self-described Catholic Christian.\n\nThe possibility that the finite/infinite time distinction is\nconventional was noted by the Catholic philosopher of science Ernan\nMcMullin, who concludes that the theological doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo must not be given a metric interpretation (McMullin 1981).\nRather, claims McMullin, the ex nihilo doctrine should be\ninterpreted order-theoretically: the time series has a first point.\nBut this order-theoretic criterion will not help theism, at least not\nin regard to current cosmological models. On the one hand, FRW\ncosmological models fail the order-theoretic criterion: they\nhave no first moment of time. On the other hand, an ideal first moment\nof time could be adjoined to any spacetime, even those that\nhave a metrically infinite past (see Earman 1995). Thus, a simple\norder-theoretic criterion is a bad guide to whether cosmological\nmodels are consistent with the doctrine of creation ex\nnihilo.\n\nA more adequate criterion of when a cosmological model is consonant\nwith creation ex nihilo would require a detailed analysis of\nsingular spacetimes (for extensive discussion of the latter topic, see\nEarman 1995). The best current account of when a spacetime is truly\nsingular (as opposed to merely being described with inadequate\ncoordinates) is when it contains inextendible geodesics of finite\nlength. Intuitively, a geodesic is the path that would be followed by\na clock in freefall. If a clock were travelling on a past-inextendible\ngeodesic, then at some finite time in the past, the clock did not\nexist; more strongly, spacetime itself did not exist. Thus, the\nbig-bang theologian would do best to claim that creation ex\nnihilo is confirmed precisely by those cosmological spacetimes\nthat have inextendible geodesics. (Indeed, this criterion does hold\nfor FRW models.) The main problem with such a proposal is that it ties\na robust, intuitive theological doctrine down to an extremely precise\ntechnical feature of Lorentzian manifolds (as described by\ndifferential geometry). The risk then is that by doing so, one would\nadd extraneous content to the theological doctrine: a future model\nmight fail the technical criterion while still being consistent with\nthe theological doctrine. Furthermore, many Christian theists claim\nthat core theological doctrines are perspicuous\u2014in particularly,\nnot understood exclusively by an elite class of priests or scholars.\nBut the notion of a Lorentzian manifold having incomplete geodesics\ncan hardly be said to be accessible to the average layperson.\n",
