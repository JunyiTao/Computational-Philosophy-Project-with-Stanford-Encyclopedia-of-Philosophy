    "main_text": "What sorts of entities are works of art? || Platonism and its critics\n3.1 Platonism and its critics\n\n\nPlatonism about works of art can be understood as the thesis that some\nor even all works of art are abstract entities that have no\nspatiotemporal location (for background, see the entry on platonism in\nmetaphysics). It is most common to conjoin a platonist account of\nworks in some art forms, such as music and literature, with a\ndifferent account, i.e. the physical object hypothesis, of works in\nother art forms, such as painting and dance. Recent advocates of\nplatonism in the ontology of art include Peter Kivy (1983, 1987) and\nJulian Dodd (2000, 2007, 2010). Noteworthy recent critiques of\nplatonist theses in the ontology of art include Stephen Davies (1993,\n2003b, 2008), Predelli (1995, 2001), Saam Trivedi (2002), Andrew Kania\n(2008a, 2008b, 2012), David Davies (2009a, 2009b), Marcus Rossberg\n(2012), Chris Tillman (2011), and Gary Ostertag (2012).\n\n\nSome of the objections to platonism in art ontology are versions of\nlongstanding criticisms of the postulation of abstract objects, such\nas the objection that the instantiation relation between universals\nand their particular manifestations leads to a regress, or is obscure\nor inexplicable. Other objections are raised by philosophers who do\nnot reject all postulations of knowable abstract objects, but who\nnonetheless find that works of art are not adequately classified as\nsuch items.\n\n\nOne worry about platonism with regard to music runs as follows: if a\nsound, and the hearing of a sound, are spatiotemporal events, and if a\nmusical work is an abstract type that has no spatiotemporal location\nand that exists independently of particular performances of it, how\ncould it be literally true to say that a musical work has\nsuch-and-such sounds? Do platonists about musical works have to accept\nthe conclusion that musical works are, strictly speaking, inaudible\n(Davies 2009b)? Another worry concerns performances and their relation\nto the abstract objects of which they are a performance: if a musical\nwork is a fully determinate abstract object, how could an\ninterpretative performance of it be necessary to its\nappreciation (Predelli 1995, 2001)?\n \n\nRudner raised another objection that is often taken up in the\nliterature (e.g., Caplan and Matheson 2004). If a work such as\nBeethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony is an abstract entity, this\nwould have \u201cas a counter-intuitive consequence a denial that\nBeethoven created the Fifth Symphony\u201d (1950, 385).\n\n\nHere we encounter a paradox, or incoherent conjunction of thoughts\neach of which has some intuitive appeal when examined separately.  As\nKania (2008a, 22) and Cameron (2008, 295) put it in the context of\ndiscussions of the ontology of musical works, the triad may be\nspecified as follows:\n\n(A) Works of art are created.\n\n(B) Works of art are abstract objects.\n\n(C) Abstract objects cannot be created.\n\n\n\n\nMany philosophers (e.g., Wolterstorff 1980, Kivy 1987, Currie 1989)\nhave thought that this paradox is best resolved by rejecting (A). For\nothers, such as Haig Khatchadourian (1960) and Ren\u00e9e Cox\n(1985), (A) is true; works of art should be recognized as items that\ncome into existence and can be destroyed. Given this premise, which is\ndefended at length by Charles Nussbaum (2003), the trio may be\ninterpreted as a reductio of (B). Yet giving up on (B) would\nseem to require us to overlook the obvious fact that we commonly speak\nof a musical work as being repeatable. Cannot the same recorded song\nbe replayed on multiple occasions? Another strategy is to restore\ncoherence by revising only (C). Margaret MacDonald (1952\u20131953)\nproposes that works are abstract types that are genuinely created by\nthe artist or author. Similarly, Thomasson argues that at least some\nworks of art (i.e., musical and literary works) are a kind of\n\u201cabstract artifact\u201d meriting recognition as genuine\ncreations (1999, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2010). Barry Smith (2008) also\nargues for what he calls \u2018quasi-abstract patterns\u2019, which\nlike numbers are nonphysical and nonpsychological, but which are tied,\nthrough the actions of agents, to a time and historical\ncontext. Anthony Ralls (1972) characterizes works as created\nuniversals concretely embodied through the intentional activities of\nartists. Peter Alward (2004) contends that the paradox is generated by\ninappropriate assumptions about types, and that genuine artistic\ncreation is compatible with a continuant/stage model of works and\nperformances. Lee Walters (2013) argues for a solution to the paradox\nbased on the thesis that works are created types. He responds to an\narray of objections to this approach, including those advanced in\nAllan Hazlett (2012).\n",
