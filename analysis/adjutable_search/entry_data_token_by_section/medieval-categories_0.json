    "main_text": "Issues\n1. Issues\n\n\nPhilosophers speak about categories in many different ways. There is\none initial, and rather substantial, difference between philosophers\nwho allow a very large number of categories and those who allow only a\nvery small number. The first include among categories such different\nthings as human, green, animal, thought, and justice; the second speak\nonly of very general things such as substance, quality, relation, and\nthe like, as categories. Among twentieth-century authors who allow\nmany categories is Gilbert Ryle (b. 1900, d. 1976). Roderick Chisholm\n(b. 1916, d. 1999) is an example of those who have only very\nfew. Medieval authors follow Aristotle's narrow\nunderstanding.\n\n\nThe disagreement concerning categories in the history of philosophy\ndoes not end there. Even if we restrict the discussion to a small\nnumber of items of the sort that Aristotle regards as categories, many\nissues remain to be settled about them, and philosophers frequently\ndisagree about how to settle them. These issues may be gathered into\nroughly ten groups.\n\n\nThe first group comprises what may be described roughly as extensional\nissues; they have to do with the number of categories. The extension\nof a term is comprised by the things of which the term can be\ntruthfully predicated. Thus the extension of \u2018cat\u2019\nconsists of all the animals of which it is true to say that they are\ncats.  Philosophers in general frequently disagree on how many\ncategories there are. For example, Aristotle lists up to ten, but\ngives the impression that the ultimate number is not settled at\nall. Plotinus (204/5\u2013270) and Baruch Spinoza (1632\u201377)\nreduce the number radically, but their views do not by any means\nestablish themselves as definitive.  In the Middle Ages the number of\ncategories is always small (ten or less) but it nonetheless\nvaries.\n\n\nThe second group is roughly intensional; they concern what categories\nare and the properties they have. The intension of a term is the set\nof properties that apply to the things of which the term is truthfully\npredicated and which are listed in its definition or taken to be\nimplied by it. Thus the intension of \u2018human\u2019 is, say,\nrational animal, and includes living and corporeal. Again,\nphilosophers disagree as to whether categories can be defined, and if\nthey can be, how they are to be defined. In general, medieval authors\nreject the possibility of defining them for various reasons.  One\nreason is that most of these authors conceive categories as divisions\nof being, and being for them is not a genus. Since a definition\nrequires a genus (\u201canimal\u201d in the definition of\n\u201chuman\u201d given earlier), the categories cannot be defined.\nAnother reason is that a definition requires a difference that\ndistinguishes what is being defined from other types of thing within\nthe genus (\u201crationality\u201d for humans, within the genus\n\u201canimal\u201d), but the categories are the highest kind of\nthings, so there is nothing outside of them that can be used to\ndistinguish them.\n\n\nThe third group is ontological; the issues here involve the place that\ncategories occupy in the map of all things that exist or can\nexist. Ontology is the sub-discipline of philosophy that deals with\nbeing and what exists. The three most common questions raised in this\ncontext are: (1) Are categories extra-mental entities, such as\nproperties, qualities, relations, structures, sets, classes, or forms?\n(2) Are categories intra-mental entities, such as phenomena, mental\nacts, mental contents, Gestalten, or mental structures? (3)\nAre categories linguistic entities, such as meanings, words, types,\ntokens, predicates, or syntactical places? Four views stand out.\nAccording to one, categories are linguistic entities\u2013call them\nwords\u2013such as the words \u2018quality\u2019 and\n\u2018relation,\u2019 with which we speak about things. According to\nanother, categories are mental acts\u2013call them\nconcepts\u2013such as the concept of quality or the concept of\nrelation, with which we think about things. Categories are also\nthought to be extra-mental features that things about which we think\nand speak have\u2013call them properties\u2013such as the properties\nof being a quality or of being a relation. Finally, there is an\ninclusive view that tries to integrate all of these three positions\ninto one, arguing that categories are words, concepts, and properties\nbut in different ways.  These four views are not the only choices\navailable (see Gracia 1999), but they are the most popular views\nconsidered in the Middle Ages.\n\n\nThe fourth group has to do with causes; they include questions about\nhow categories are established or brought about. These issues have\nattracted considerable attention in recent years, particularly among\npost-modern philosophers, such as Michel Foucault (1926\u201384). In\nthe Middle Ages the way this question is posed depends heavily on the\nontological status accorded to categories, particularly on whether\nthey are mental or extra-mental entities. The Foucauldian concern with\n\u201csocial construction,\u201d however, seems to be absent from\nmedieval discussions.\n\n\nThe fifth group involves epistemology; they concern primarily how we\nhave access to categories, that is, how we get to know them and under\nwhat conditions. Although this is not a widespread topic of discussion\nin the Early Middle Ages, later on there are various attempts to\ndetermine the number and identity of the categories and the basis on\nwhich this determination can be carried out. These attempts, and the\nassumptions which guide them, are closely related to an important\nissue for the Middle Ages in general that becomes critical toward its\nend: the relation of language, thought, and reality, or as it is also\nput, between signifying, thinking, and being, or between words,\nconcepts, and things. Some think the relation is isomorphic, whereas\nothers disagree.\n\n\nThe sixth group concerns language; they involve the terms used to talk\nabout categories and the way they function. These issues are\nparticularly relevant for the view that considers categories to be\nlinguistic entities, and therefore become central in twentieth-century\nAnglo-American philosophy. In the Middle Ages, they are especially\nimportant in the latter part of the period when issues of language\ntake center stage in philosophical discussions.\n\n\nThe seventh group falls within the philosophy of mind; they have to do\nwith the status of categories in the mind. Since we think about\ncategories and through categories, it is pertinent for a philosopher\nto ask questions of this sort. This topic is particularly pertinent\nfor those who think that categories are mental entities. In the\nMiddle Ages, the questions raised about the status of categories in\nthe mind are put generally in the context of other topics, such as the\nstatus of universals, but much of what medieval authors say about\nuniversals can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to\ncategories.\n\n\nThe eighth group may be characterized as social, political, and\naxiological; they have to do with the value and use of categories by\npersons, society, and the polity. Many contemporary philosophers have\nfound in this topic a way of undermining some traditional views of the\nworld that they consider oppressive or inaccurate. These issues do not\nseem to be explicitly raised in the Middle Ages and may indicate one\nimportant difference between medieval and contemporary philosophical\nthought.\n\n\nThe ninth group is meta-disciplinary; they involve the discipline that\nstudies categories. Obviously, how these issues are addressed depends\nto a great extent on the position one takes concerning the conception\nand ontological status of categories, as well as on how the various\ndisciplines of learning are understood. This is a topic of concern in\nthe Middle Ages, and is explicitly addressed by late medieval\nauthors. They identify various disciplines as the place to study\ncategories, ranging from grammar and logic to metaphysics.\n\n\nFinally, rather than discussing categories in general, one may deal\nwith particular categories, such as substance or relation. This is\nperhaps the most frequent way in which categories are discussed in the\nhistory of philosophy, including the Middle Ages.\n\n\nApart from these topics, there are others that are closely related to\ncategories and often discussed together with them. One involves\ntrans-categorial terms, such as \u2018being,\u2019\n\u2018one,\u2019 \u2018true,\u2019 and \u2018good,\u2019 which\napply to all categories and are predicable of every term that falls\nwithin the categories. In the Middle Ages, these are known as\n\u201cthe transcendentals\u201d and their status becomes\ncontroversial in the thirteenth century (see Gracia 1992b).\n\n\nA second topic concerns what are known as\n\u201cante-predicaments,\u201d and are introduced by Aristotle at\nthe beginning of Categories: univocity, equivocity, and\ndenomination. Univocity occurs when the same term is predicated in the\nsame sense, as \u2018animal\u2019 is of a man and an ox. Equivocity\nis dived into random equivocity and purposeful equivocity.  The former\noccurs when the same term is predicated in different senses, as\n\u2018animal\u2019 is of a person and a picture of a person. The\nlatter involves the broader issues of analogical predication.And\ndenomination occurs when the predicated term is derived from another,\nas \u2018grammarian\u2019 is from \u2018grammar\u2019 (see\nAshworth 1991).\n\n\nA third topic involves the \u201cpost-predicaments,\u201d a cluster\nof seemingly disparate notions treated by Aristotle in\nCategories after he discusses the categories proper. They\ninclude opposites (relatives, contraries, privation and possession,\nand affirmation and negation), priority (in time, in existence, in\norder, and in value) and simultaneity (in time and by nature), change\n(generation and corruption, increase and decrease, alteration and\nlocomotion), and several meanings of \u2018having.\u2019\n\n\nA fourth topic, also commonly discussed beginning in the thirteenth\ncentury, concerns what becomes known as \u201csyncategorematic\nterms.\u201d These are particles, such as \u2018every\u2019 and\n\u2018and,\u2019 which are not classifiable into any category (see\nWilliam of Sherwood 1968).\n\n\nA fifth topic of discussion introduced in the Middle Ages through\nBoethius' Commentaries on Porphyry's Isagoge involves the\n\u201cpredicables\u201d (praedicabilia), which are ways in\nwhich predicates relate to subjects. Examples are\n\u201caccident\u201d (\u2018black\u2019 in \u2018This cat is\nblack\u2019), \u201cspecies\u201d (\u2018man\u2019 in\n\u2018Socrates is a man\u2019), and \u201cdefinition\u201d\n(\u2018rational animal\u2019 in \u2018Man is a rational\nanimal\u2019) (see Porphyry 1975). Although these issues are\noriginally introduced by Aristotle in the Topics, this work\nwas not available in the Middle Ages until after the period of\ntranslations in the twelfth century.\n\n\nBecause of considerations of space, we shall not discuss these related\ntopics here, nor can we refer to all the issues about categories\nraised by medieval authors or mentioned above. However, the conceptual\nframework of issues we have introduced should help in the\nunderstanding of how categories are approached in the Middle Ages and\nthe differences between the medieval approach and those taken in other\nperiods of the history of philosophy. We begin with the classical\nbackground of the discussion of categories in the Middle Ages. This\nconsists primarily of Aristotle, who is responsible for the first\ntreatise on categories ever written.\n",
