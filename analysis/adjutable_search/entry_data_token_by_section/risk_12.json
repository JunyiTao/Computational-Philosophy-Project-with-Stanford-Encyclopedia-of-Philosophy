A person is pessimistic\nabout some future development to the extent that she assigns a higher\nprobability to undesired outcomes, and a lower probability to desired\nones, than the most plausible assignment. She is optimistic to the\nextent that she assigns higher probabilities to desired outcomes, and\nlower probabilities to undesired ones, than the most plausible\nassignment.\n\nCautiousness (risk aversion) and risk-seeking (risk affinity) concern\na person\u2019s decisions and actions, rather than her beliefs. When\nmaking a choice between different action alternatives, a cautious\n(risk-averse) person tends to choose an alternative with as small\nprobabilities as possible for the worst outcomes. She does so even if\nit prevents her from maximizing the expected utility of her choice. In\ncontrast, a risk-seeking person looks for options with a high\nprobability for the best outcomes, and she does this even at the\nexpense of not maximizing the expected utility of her choice. (See\nalso section 7.2.)\n\nThe precautionary principle is often believed to be a general\ninstruction to be cautious. However, this is not what is usually meant\nby the term \u201cthe precautionary principle\u201d. This is a\nprinciple that is defined in international treaties and in European\nlegislation. According to these definitions, the precautionary\nprinciple concerns how we should act when it is scientifically\nreasonable to suspect a risk to health or the environment, but the\nevidence is not strong enough to show conclusively that the risk\nexists. The precautionary principle says that in such cases we may,\nand often should, take measures against the potential danger. This\ndefinition has been the standard at least since 1992, when the\nprecautionary principle was included both in the United Nations\u2019\nRio Declaration and in the European Union\u2019s Treaty of Rome,\nwhich is now called the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion (Pyh\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2010). Its practical application\ndepends on the interpretation of scientific evidence that indicates\nthe presence of a danger, but is not strong enough for scientists to\ntreat the existence of that danger as known. The evaluation of such\nevidence raises methodological and epistemological issues that are in\nneed of further clarification, not least with conceptual tools\ndeveloped in the philosophy of science.\n\nThere is also a still ongoing philosophical discussion about other\ndefinitions of a precautionary principle. Many of these proposals are\ncloser to general (decision-theoretical) cautiousness than the more\nnarrowly defined legal concept (Munthe 2011).\n",
