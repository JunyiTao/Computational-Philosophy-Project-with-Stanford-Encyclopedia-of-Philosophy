    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art || Art and Nature\n3.1 Art and Nature\n\nArt is not a mere \u2018imitation\u2019 or\n\u2018representation\u2019 of nature; art is the product of a\ncreative force. This sentence, crystallizing one of the\nfundamental ideas of German Romantic aesthetics, constitutes the core\nof one of A.W. Schlegel\u2019s most well-known Berlin lectures. It\nwas published in the Viennese journal, Prometheus in 1808 and\nre-collected in his Kritische Schriften (1828) as\n\u00dcber das Verh\u00e4ltniss der sch\u00f6nen Kunst zur Natur;\n\u00dcber T\u00e4uschung und Wahrscheinlichkeit; \u00dcber Manier und\nStil (On the Relationship of Art to Nature; On Illusion and\nProbability; On Style and Manner). The importance of this essay\nlies not only in this thesis (an idea that we also find in other texts\nof that period, such as Schelling\u2019s 1807 essay \u00dcber das\nVerh\u00e4ltni\u00df der bildenden K\u00fcnsten zu der Natur (On the\nRelationship of Visual Arts to Nature), but rather in the way\nSchlegel developed his argument.\n\nIn this text, Schlegel argues in favor of a Modern (i.e., Romantic)\nart theory, in opposition to the representationalist and mimetic\ndoctrines that go back to Aristotle\u2019s Poetics and\nconceive the work of the artist as that of a craftsman copying the\nbeauty of nature (Abrams 1953: 48). But his critique of the classicist\nformula \u2018art imitates nature\u2019 was accompanied by a careful\nanalysis of the different meanings the term \u2018nature\u2019 had\ncome to assume within aesthetic discourses. This philological and\nhistorical approach is distinctive of Schlegel\u2019s writings and\nlends intelligibility and clarity to the texts without eroding their\nphilosophical sharpness. Undoubtedly, the Romantic notion of art goes\nhand in hand with a reevaluation of the concept of nature. Similar to\nother authors who also were inspired by Spinoza\u2019s distinction\nbetween natura naturans and natura naturata,\nSchlegel argues that, from a philosophical point of view, everything\nparticipates in an ongoing process of creation, whereas, from an\nempirical point of view, natural things are conceived as if they were\ndead, fixed and independent from the whole. This means that, in its\npurest and philosophical sense, nature is not perceptible in the same\nway the worldly objects are. However, unlike Schelling with his\n\u2018intellectual intuition\u2019 or intellektuelle\nAnschauung, Schlegel did not develop an elaborate theory to give\naccount of this different form of perception; he succinctly argued\nthat the comprehension of nature\u2019s true essence is more like a\npresentiment (ahnen) or an aesthetic contemplation,\nthan like scientific knowledge. In order to realize this\n\u2018Romantic\u2019 notion of nature, one needs to comprehend or\nrather feel oneself as an organic whole. One needs to achieve\nself-awareness and to recognize oneself as forming part of a larger\nunity. This resort to a non-theoretical or non-discursive plane as an\nessential constituent of human knowledge was also important in\nSchlegel\u2019s philosophy of language, which he already expounded in\nhis Letters on Poetry, Meter and Language (Briefe\n\u00fcber Poesie, Sylbenma\u00df und Sprache) in 1795. \n\nIn any case, the philosophical or Romantic notion of nature as an\nunfathomable unity and creative force that cannot be seen nor touched,\nand which is obviously a direct response to some of the many questions\nraised by Kant\u2019s three Critiques, is not to be\nunderstood as a mere intellection, an empty chimera: Nature is the\nproductive force pulsing in all living beings. For Schlegel, nature is\norganic in the sense that it is an organized and organizing principle,\ngranting intelligence to the totality of existing beings. It is a\ncreative force that produces independent living things, the life of\nwhich does not need any external mechanism to keep its autonomy, for\nit only depends on its inner, natural power to live (as is the case\nwith Leibniz\u2019 vis activa). At this point Schlegel\nmentions the astrological doctrines that claim that even the tiniest\natom is a mirror of the universe. The idea of Nature mirroring itself\nin each and every living organism is characteristic both of German\nIdealism and German Romanticism. The difference between human beings\nand other animals, plants, or mineral structures is that, (1) human\nbeings are able to understand the fact that they, as an organism,\nmirror Nature\u2019s organic structure; and furthermore, (2) that\nthey are capable of reproducing nature\u2019s creativity through art,\nas well as reflecting upon this fact. This reasoning induced Schlegel\nto define human genius and his/her poetical creativity as a whole\n(i.e., art and language) as the capability of producing a world within\na world (M\u00fcller-Vollmer 2000 [2002]: 317); a definition which is\nmost tangible in dramatic literature.\n\nSchlegel\u2019s criticism of the physicalists\u2019 conception of\nnature is surely the result of a very specific aesthetic and\nphilosophical perspective. But this particular viewpoint enabled him\nto reinterpret and give a new meaning to the old and criticized\nformula \u2018art imitates nature\u2019. Indeed, once we conceive of\nnature as an organic whole, constantly becoming and transforming\nitself, then the sentence is quite different and seems to capture not\nonly the true essence of (Romantic) art, but also its most fundamental\nprinciple. It is in this sense that Schlegel polemically will say that\n\u201cart should imitate nature\u201d (SW: III, 306). The\ndeficiency of the formula does not lie in the idea itself, but in the\nmeaning we give to its components. In a very precise sense, art\nimitates nature, because in his or her creativity, the\ngenuine artist (i.e., the Romantic artist) also seeks to\nproduce an organic whole and thereby embody an eternal truth. For\nSchlegel, it is only through art and through everything that art\nsignifies, that man is capable of attaining that seemingly\nlost unity.\n",
