    "main_text": "The Method in Mathematics\n9. The Method in Metaphysics\n\nDescartes employs the method of analysis in Meditations\n(Second Replies, AT 7: 155\u2013156, CSM 2: 110\u2013111). In\nmetaphysics, the method of analysis \u201cshows how the thing in\nquestion was discovered\u201d (ibid.). Descartes opposes analysis to\nsynthesis, in which first principles are not discovered, but rather\ngiven in the form of definitions, postulates, axioms, theorems, and\nproblems (ibid.), as in a Euclidean demonstrations. Synthesis\n\u201ccannot so conveniently be applied to [\u2026] metaphysical\nsubjects\u201d, Descartes writes. Why? \n\n\nThe difference is that the primary notions which are presupposed for\nthe demonstration of geometrical truths are readily accepted by\nanyone, since they accord with the use of our senses. [\u2026] In\nmetaphysics by contrast there is nothing which causes so much effort\nas making our perception of the primary notions clear and distinct.\n(AT 7: 156\u2013157, CSM 1: 111) \n\n\nIn metaphysics, the first principles are not provided in advance,\nbecause the mind must be habituated or learn how to perceive them\nclearly and distinctly, and habituation requires preparation (the\nrejection of preconceived opinions and the perfected employment of the\ncognitive faculties). Furthermore, the principles of metaphysics must\nbe indubitable, and since their indubitability cannot be assumed, it\nmust be shown. \n\nDescartes\u2019 analytical procedure in Meditations I\nconsists in enumerating3 his opinions and subjecting them\nto doubt, so that any proposition that survives these doubts can be\nsecurely accepted as true. Descartes also describes this as the\n\u201cmethod of universal doubt\u201d (AT 7: 203, CSM 2: 207). \n\n\n[For] the purpose of rejecting all my opinions, it will be enough if I\nfind in each of them at least some reason for doubt. And to do this I\nwill not need to run through them all individually, which would be an\nendless task. [\u2026] I will go straight for the principles. (AT 7:\n18, CSM 2: 17) \n\n\nInstead of running through all of his opinions individually, he\ndecides to place them in definite classes and examine one or two\nmembers of each particular class, in order to see whether he has any\nreason to doubt them. He defines the class of his opinions as those\n\u201cI have acquired either from the senses or through the\nsenses\u201d (AT 7: 18, CSM 1: 12) and proceeds to further divide the\nclass into (a) opinions about things \u201cwhich are very small or in\nthe distance\u201d, about which he frequently errs; (b) opinions\nabout his body and things that are in his immediate environment, which\nmay be little more than a dream; (c) opinions about things, which even\nif they are imaginary, are at least fashioned out of things that are\nreal, a \n\n\nclass [which] appears to include corporeal nature in general, and its\nextension; the shape of extended things; the quantity, or size and\nnumber of these things; the place in which they may exist; the time\nthrough which they may endure, and so on. \n\n\nHe then doubts the existence of even these things, since there may be\na God who \n\n\nbrought it about that there is no earth, no sky, no extended thing, no\nshape, no size, no place, while at the same time ensuring that all\nthese things appear to me to exist just as they do now. (AT 7:\n18\u201321, CSM 2: 12\u201314) \n\n\nDescartes completes the enumeration of his opinions in\nMeditations I by concluding that \n\n\nI have no answer to these arguments, but am finally compelled to admit\nthat there is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not\nproperly be raised. [\u2026] So in future I must withhold my assent\nfrom these former beliefs just as carefully as I would from obvious\nfalsehoods, if I want to discover any certainty. (AT 7: 21\u201322,\nCSM 2: 14\u201315) \n\n\nThe doubts entertained in Meditations I are entirely structured by\nenumeration3 (see Descartes\u2019 remarks on enumeration\nin Rule 7, AT 10: 391, CSM 1: 27 and\n Section 2.4\n above).\n\nThe famous intuition of the proposition, \u201cI am, I exist\u201d\nin Meditations II is discovered by means of\nenumeration3: the proposition \u201cI am, I exist\u201d,\ncannot be placed into any of the classes of dubitable opinions\nenumerated in Meditations I because not even the most\nmalicious demon \u201ccan bring it about that I am nothing so long as\nI think that I am something\u201d (AT 7: 25, CSM 2: 17). Here,\nintuition comes after enumeration3 has prepared the\nway.\n\nThese examples show that enumeration both orders and enables Descartes\nto solve a variety of problems in Meditations (see\n Section 2.4\n above and Dubouclez 2013: 307\u2013331). Intuition and deduction are\nmobilized only after enumeration has prepared the way. Descartes\neffectively deals with a series of imperfectly understood problems in\nMeditations, and he solves these problems by means of three\noperations: enumeration (principally enumeration2\u20134),\nintuition, and deduction.\n\nNot everyone agrees that the method employed in Meditations\nis the method described in the Discourse and the\nRules. Some scholars have very plausibly argued that the\n\u201cmethod of doubt\u201d in Meditations constitutes a\ndistinct method. In Meditations, Descartes actively resolves\n\u201cto doubt all previous beliefs by searching for grounds of\ndoubt\u201d (Curley 1978: 43\u201344; cf. Broughton 2002: 2\u20137). Descartes does\nnot resolve to doubt all of his former opinions in the Rules.\nFurthermore, in the case of the anaclastic, the method of the\nRules requires reducing complex problems to a series of\nsimpler problems; solving the simplest problem by means of intuition;\nand solving the more complex problems by means of deduction (see\n Section 3).\n It is difficult to discern any such procedure in Meditations\n(Garber 1992: 49\u201350 and 2001: 44\u201347; Newman 2019). Other\nscholars have argued that Descartes\u2019 method in the\nRules does play an important role in Meditations.\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysical principles are discovered by combining\nsimple natures, such as the combination of thought and existence in\nthe performance of the cogito in Discourse IV and\nMeditations II (see Marion 1992 and the examples of intuition discussed in\n Section 2.2\n above). A recent line of interpretation maintains more broadly that\nDescartes\u2019 method can be applied in different ways. Different\ntypes of problems must be solved differently (Dika and Kambouchner\nforthcoming). The method of doubt is not a distinct method, but rather\nan application of the same method to a different problem.\n",
