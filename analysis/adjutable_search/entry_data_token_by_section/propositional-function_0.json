    "main_text": "Pre-History\n1. Pre-History\nBefore we begin our discussion of propositional functions, it will\nbe helpful to note what came before their introduction. In\ntraditional logic, the role of propositional functions is\napproximately held by terms. In traditional logic, statements such as\n\u2018dogs are mammals\u2019 are treated as postulating a relation between the\nterms \u2018dogs\u2019 and \u2018mammals\u2019.\nA term is treated either extensionally as a class of objects or\nintensionally as a set of properties. The \u2018intent\u2019 of the\nterm \u2018dog\u2019 includes all the properties that are included\nin the intent of \u2018mammal\u2019. The intensional treatment of\n\u2018dogs are mammals\u2019 interprets this sentence as true\nbecause the semantic interpretation of the subject is a\nsuperset of the interpretation of the predicate. On the\nextensional treatment of the sentence, however, the sentence is true\nbecause the interpretation of the subject (the class of dogs) is a\nsubset of the interpretation of the predicate (the set of\nmammals).\nThese two treatments of the predicate are typical of the two\ntraditions in traditional logic\u2014the intensional and the\nextensional traditions. Logicians who can be counted among the\nintensional logicians are Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Lambert, William\nHamilton, Stanley Jevons, and Hugh MacColl. Among the extensional\nlogicians are George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, Charles Peirce, and\nJohn Venn.\nThe treatment of terms in the intensional logic tradition property\nof certain sentences might seem strange to modern readers. The\nintension of a predicate, in 20th Century philosophy, includes only\nthose properties that any competent speaker of a language would\nassociate with that predicate. These properties are not enough to\nmake true ordinary statements like \u2018every dog in my house is\nasleep\u2019. But we can make sense of the intensional view of terms by\nconsidering its origins. One of the founders of the intensional logic\ntradition is Leibniz, who thinks that all truths are grounded in the\nnature of individuals. The complete concept of an individual contains\neverything that is true of it. Building on this, we can see that the\ncomplete concept of a term will include enough to ground any truth\nabout it as well.\nIn both the intensional and extensional logic traditions, we see\ntheories of complex terms. In the extensional tradition, disjunctive\nand conjunctive terms are interpreted by taking the union and\nintersection of classes. The conjunctive term\nAB is interpreted as the intersection of the class A\nand the class\nB and the extension of the disjunctive term A+B is\nunderstood as the union of the extensions of\nA and B. \nIn the intensional tradition, the reverse holds. The\nterm AB is interpreted as the union of the properties in the\nintent of\nA and the intent of B and A+B is\ninterpreted as the intersection of the properties in\nA and B. This reversal makes sense, since more\nthings fit a smaller number of properties and fewer things fit a\nlarger number of properties.\nAlthough some of the logicians working in term logic have very\ncomplicated treatments of negation, we can see the origin of the\nmodern conception in the extensional tradition as well. In Boole and\nmost of his followers, the negation of a term is understood as the\nset theoretic complement of the class represented by that term. For\nthis reason, the negation of classical propositional logic is often\ncalled \u2018Boolean negation\u2019.\n",
