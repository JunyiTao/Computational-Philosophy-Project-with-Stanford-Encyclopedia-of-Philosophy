    "main_text": "Pornography and objectification\n2. Pornography and objectification\n\nLike Kant, anti-pornography feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea\nDworkin take inequality to be tightly linked to objectification. In\nthe eyes of both these feminists and Kant, there is the powerful\nobjectifier on the one hand, and on the other hand there exists his\npowerless victim. Due to their unequal power, the former objectifies\nthe latter.\n\nKant is concerned with inequality taking place within polygamous\nrelationships. MacKinnon and Dworkin, on the other hand, believe that\ninequality is a much more widespread and pervasive phenomenon. It\ncovers all aspects of our society. MacKinnon and Dworkin emphasise\nthat we live in a world of gender inequality. A\nperson\u2019s gender is, for MacKinnon, clearly\ndistinguished from a person\u2019s sex. Gender, being a man\nor a woman, is socially constructed, whereas sex, being male or\nfemale, is biologically defined. Within our patriarchal societies, men\nand women have clearly defined roles: women (all women, women as a\ngroup) are objectified, whereas men (all men, men as a group) are\ntheir objectifiers (MacKinnon 1987, 6, 32\u201345, 50; MacKinnon\n1989a, 113\u20134, 128, 137\u201340; Haslanger 1993, 98\u2013101)\n(For more on sex and gender, see also the entries\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender\n and\n feminist perspectives on power.)\n Even though MacKinnon does acknowledge that a female (sex) individual\ncan be an objectifier and a male (sex) individual can be objectified,\nshe takes it that the former is a man and the latter is a woman, since\nin her view a man (gender) is by definition the objectifier and a\nwoman (gender) is by definition the objectified.\n\nThis situation of gender inequality which troubles our societies and\nis so tightly linked to the objectification of women is, MacKinnon and\nDworkin believe, created and sustained by men\u2019s consumption of\npornography. MacKinnon defines pornography as \u201cthe graphic\nsexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words\nthat also includes women dehumanised as sexual objects, things, or\ncommodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape; being tied up, cut\nup, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in postures of sexual\nsubmission or servility or display; reduced to body parts, penetrated\nby objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of degradation,\ninjury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding, bruised, or\nhurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual\u201d (MacKinnon\n1987, 176).\n\nIn our society, MacKinnon holds, pornography defines women\u2019s\nrole as sexual objects available for men\u2019s consumption:\n\u201cPornography defines women by how we look according to how we\ncan be sexually used. \u2026 Pornography participates in\nits audience\u2019s eroticism through creating an accessible sexual\nobject, the possession and consumption of which is male\nsexuality, as socially constructed; to be consumed and possessed as\nwhich, is female sexuality, as socially constructed\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1987, 173). According to MacKinnon, pornography is\nresponsible for both men\u2019s and women\u2019s conception of women\nas objects available for men\u2019s consumption.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s and Dworkin\u2019s understanding of objectification\nis similar to Kant\u2019s. For both of them, as for Kant,\nobjectification involves treating a person, someone with humanity, as\nan object of merely instrumental worth, and consequently reducing this\nperson to the status of an object for use. The objectified individual\nis made into a tool for others\u2019 sexual purposes.\nObjectification, therefore, constitutes a serious harm to a\nperson\u2019s humanity.\n\nDworkin uses Kantian language to describe the phenomenon of sexual\nobjectification: \u201cObjectification occurs when a human being,\nthrough social means, is made less than human, turned into a thing or\ncommodity, bought and sold. When objectification occurs, a person is\ndepersonalised, so that no individuality or integrity is available\nsocially or in what is an extremely circumscribed privacy.\nObjectification is an injury right at the heart of discrimination:\nthose who can be used as if they are not fully human are no longer\nfully human in social terms; their humanity is hurt by being\ndiminished\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 30\u20131). When a person is treated\nas less than human, as merely an object for another\u2019s use, she\nbecomes, according to Dworkin, less than human. In this way, her\nhumanity is harmed by being diminished.\n\nHampton argues that Dworkin\u2019s view is upsetting, disturbing\nand indeed quite similar to the the view held by those who defend\npatriarchy. This is because, according to Dworkin, sex is necessarily\ndemeaning for the woman. Her humanity is denied altogether and she is\nliterally degraded and transformed into something less than\nhuman. Thus sex destroys a woman\u2019s humanity. Hampton explains\nthat Dworkin mistakes the social degradation and inferiority that\nwomen must endure in sexist societies with their real and equal value\nas people, which can never be degraded and must always be acknowledged\nno matter what wrongs have been inflicted on them. Consequently, for\nHampton, a distinction between degradation and diminishment would make\nDworkin\u2019s analysis more sound (Hampton 1999, 139\u2013143).\n\nMacKinnon describes objectification as follows. She writes:\n\u201c\u2026 A sex object is defined on the basis of its looks, in\nterms of its usability for sexual pleasure, such that both the\nlooking\u2014the quality of gaze, including its points of\nview\u2014and the definition according to use become eroticised as\npart of the sex itself. This is what the feminist concept of\n\u2018sex object\u2019 means\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 173). She\nfurthermore holds: \u201cA person, in one Kantian view, is a free and\nrational agent whose existence is an end in itself, as opposed to\ninstrumental. In pornography women exist to the end of male\npleasure\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 173). Insofar as an individual has\nonly instrumental value, she is clearly not regarded as an end in\nherself.\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin have argued that, even if women consent to their\nbeing used as mere means for men\u2019s sexual purposes, this is not\nsufficient to make such use permissible. For instance, these feminists\nclaim that women in the pornographic industry consent to be used as\nobjects simply out of lack of options available to them within our\npatriarchal society. Women\u2019s consent, therefore, is not true\nconsent. MacKinnon writes: \u201cThe sex is not chosen for the sex.\nMoney is the medium of force and provides the cover of consent\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1993, 28). This does not only hold for women in\npornography. For MacKinnon and Dworkin, all women\u2019s consent to\nbe sexually used by men cannot be true consent under the existing\nconditions of gender inequality. They hold that women are not truly\nblameworthy for their reduction to things of merely instrumental\nvalue. Women\u2019s objectification is demanded and inflicted by men\nin our societies. It is men who want, and also, Dworkin claims, need\nto use women as objects, and demand them to be object-like (Dworkin\n1997, 142\u20133).\n\nKant compares the objectified individual to a lemon, used and\ndiscarded afterwards, and elsewhere to a steak consumed by people for\nthe satisfaction of their hunger (Kant Lectures on Ethics,\n163 and 165). In a similar manner, MacKinnon blames pornography for\nteaching its consumers that women exist to be used by men. A woman,\naccording to MacKinnon, becomes comparable to a cup (a thing), and as\nsuch she is valued only for how she looks and how she can be used\n(MacKinnon 1987, 138). Similarly, Dworkin talks about men being the\nonly \u201chuman centre\u201d of the world, surrounded by objects\nfor use, including women. A man experiences his power, according to\nDworkin, in using objects, both inanimate objects and \u201cpersons\nwho are not adult men\u201d (Dworkin 1989, 104).\n\nKant took exercise of sexuality to be inherently problematic. For\nDworkin and MacKinnon, on the other hand, what is problematic is not\nsexuality per se, but rather sexuality as constructed through\npornography. These feminists believe that objectification is a\nconsequence of gender inequality and it is created and sustained by\npornography\u2019s existence and consumption. Pornography, according\nto MacKinnon, makes women\u2019s sexuality into \u201csomething any\nman who wants to can buy and hold in his hands\u2026 She becomes\nsomething to be used by him, specifically, an object of his sexual\nuse\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 138). MacKinnon fears that use can easily\nbe followed by violence and abuse. Since women are things (as opposed\nto human beings), it seems to men that there is nothing problematic\nwith abusing them. The object status of women, then, is the cause of\nmen seeing nothing problematic with violent behaviour towards\nwomen.\n\nMoreover, MacKinnon notes, women in pornography are presented as\nenjoying how they are being used and violated by men: \u201cIn\npornography, women desire disposition and cruelty. Men \u2026 create\nscenes in which women desperately want to be bound, battered,\ntortured, humiliated, and killed. Or merely taken and used. Women are\nthere to be violated and possessed, men to violate and possess\nus\u2026\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 148). Dworkin similarly writes:\n\u201cMen do not believe that rape and battery are violations of\nfemale will in part because men \u2026 have consumed pornography in\nthe private world of men for centuries. \u2026 The most enduring\nsexual truth in pornography is that sexual violence is desired by the\nnormal female, needed by her, suggested or demanded by her\u201d\n(Dworkin 1989, 166). Pornography, then, teaches its consumers that,\nnot only is it permissible to treat women in these ways, but also that\nwomen themselves enjoy being used, violated and abused by men. Watson\nfurthermore argues that use of pornography restricts the sexual\nautonomy of boys and men, due to pornography\u2019s pervasiveness as\na tool of sex education. Pornography consumption powerfully shapes its\nusers\u2019 beliefs, attitudes, preferences and desires. Pornography,\nshe argues, distorts these and in this way undermines people\u2019s\nsexual autonomy and restricts the development of authentic sexuality\nfor both women and men (Altman and Watson 284, 287\u20138).\n\nThe idea that pornography causes men to treat women as\nobjects to be used and abused has been defended by a number of\nfeminists. Alison Assiter argues that what is wrong with pornography\nis that it reinforces desires on the part of men to treat women as\nobjects (as mere means to achieve their purposes) (Assiter 1988, 68).\nRae Langton also discusses the possibility of such a causal connection\nbetween men\u2019s consumption of pornography and women\u2019s\nobjectification. She writes: \u201cAs a matter of human psychology,\nwhen men sexually use objects, pornographic artifacts, as women, they\ntend to use real woman as objects. One weaker variant of this causal\nclaim might be restricted to a subset of pornography\u2026 As a\nmatter of human psychology, when men sexually use objects as women,\nand those objects are pornographic artifacts, whose content is\nviolent or misogynistic, then they will tend to use real women as\nobjects\u201d (Langton 1995, 178).)\n\nMacKinnon, however, holds that the connection between men\u2019s use\nof pornography and women\u2019s objectification is not simply a\ncausal one. She has famously claimed that pornography involves\n\u201csex between people and things, human beings and pieces of\npaper, real men and unreal women\u201d. And, as a result for\nMacKinnon, \u201cthe human [women, in particular] becomes a\nthing\u201d (MacKinnon 1993, 109 and 25). Men\u2019s consumption of\npornography, then, is (constitutes) women\u2019s\nobjectification. (This is admittedly a puzzling claim, but one which I\nwill not delve into further here. Detailed defenses of the claim have\nbeen offered by Melinda Vadas (Vadas 2005) and Rae Langton (Langton\n1995), and a criticism has been put forward by Jennifer Saul (Saul\n2006).)\n\nKant thought that the solution to sexual objectification is marriage.\nThis is because he conceived this relationship as one of perfect\nequality and reciprocity between the spouses. Each of them surrenders\nhis or her person to the other and receives the person of the other in\nreturn. This way, Kant believed, neither of them is objectified by\nlosing his or her person. (For a detailed discussion of Kantian\nmarriage see Herman 1993 and Papadaki 2010b.) For Dworkin and\nMacKinnon, however, Kant\u2019s suggested solution is inappropriate.\nObjectification, according to these feminists, is present within all\nheterosexual relationships in our society and harms women\u2019s\nhumanity. Marriage, or any other heterosexual relationship for that\nmatter, is clearly not regarded as an exception by them. According to\nMacKinnon and Dworkin, the way to fight objectification is to fight\ngender inequality, which is created and sustained by men\u2019s\nconsumption of pornography. They take it that pornography has power\nand authority over its audience (men and boys). This view is also\ndefended by Langton, who argues that it does not matter that the\nspeech of pornographers is not generally held in high esteem. What\nmatters, rather, is that men and boys learn about sex primarily\nthrough pornography. Pornography passes the message to its audience\nthat women are objects readily available for men\u2019s consumption\n(Langton 1993, 312).\n\nThe view that pornography has this amount of influence over men and\nplays such a central role in women\u2019s objectification has\nreceived criticism. Deborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer question the\nidea that men are conditioned to behave in certain ways as a\nconsequence of pornography consumption. What is problematic with this\nidea, according to them, is that men are presented as incapable of\ncritically interpreting pornographic materials, and as simply\nimitating what they see in pornography (Cameron & Frazer 2000,\n248\u2013251). In a similar spirit, Altman argues that pornography\nconsumption cannot alter a person\u2019s preferences and desires,\nsexual or otherwise. He claims that men find women\u2019s\nsubordination arousing, not as a result of their having consumed\npornography. Rather, they enjoy pornography, which includes the\nsubordination of women, because they already find this subordination\narousing. Thus, pornography does not make anything sexy but it deals\nwith what its consumers already find sexy (Altman and Watson,\n68\u20139).\n\nEven assuming that pornography does indeed pass the message that women\nare object-like to its consumers, however, it has been suggested that\npornography is not special with respect to sustaining gender\ninequality and women\u2019s objectification. Leslie Green explains\nthat the idea that women are mere objects/tools is reinforced through\nparental pressure, television, popular novels, music videos, and\nfashion. What we need to do, Green says, is change our society, in a\nway that women\u2019s subjectivity will be acknowledged (Green 2000,\n43\u201352). Nussbaum too argues that we should not see pornography\nas the primary cause of women\u2019s objectification. Sexual\nobjectification is, according to Nussbaum, often caused by social\ninequality, but there is no reason to believe that pornography is the\ncore of such inequality (Nussbaum 1995, 286, 290).\n\nA similar view has been put forward by Ronald Dworkin, according to\nwhom: \u201cIt might be odd that feminists have devoted such energy\nto that campaign [the campaign for outlawing pornography]\u2026 No\ndoubt mass culture is in various ways an obstacle to sexual equality,\nbut the most popular forms of that culture\u2014the view of women\npresented in soap operas and commercials, for example\u2014are much\ngreater obstacles to that equality than the dirty films watched by a\nsmall minority\u201d (R. Dworkin 1993, 36). (For further discussions\nabout pornography, see also the entries on\n feminist perspectives on sex markets\n and on\n pornography and censorship.)\n",
