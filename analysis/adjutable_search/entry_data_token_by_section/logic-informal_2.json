    "main_text": "Standardizing Arguments\n3. Standardizing Arguments\n\nThe ultimate goal of informal logic is normative: i.e. systems of\nlogic that provide us with tools that can be used to evaluate real\nlife arguments and the key components they contain. Because real life\ndiscourse often fails to present the latter clearly, most systems of\ninformal logic prepare the way for argument evaluation by explicitly\nidentifying an argument\u2019s premises, conclusions, and inferences.\nThe process of doing so is commonly called \u201cstandardizing\u201d\n(S in the BLAST definition). \n\nIn the process of standardization, informal logics aim to untangle\nissues that obscure the structure and content of real life arguments.\nArguments in ordinary discourse are, for example, frequently vague,\nambiguous or in other ways unclear. Premises and conclusions can be\nconveyed by rhetorical questions (\u201cCan anyone seriously\nbelieve...?\u201d \u201cCould the defendant have been in two places\nat once?\u201d) and the key components of an argument may be\ninterspersed with irrelevant digressions and repetition. When we\nextract an argument from the context in which it occurs, it can be\nimportant to recognize what is implicit but relevant at the same time\nthat we discard what is explicit but irrelevant. \n\nStandardizing clarifies the structure of an argument in ordinary\ndiscourse by: \n\ndiscarding irrelevant and distracting digressions, repetition, and\nremarks (\u201cnoise\u201d) which do not play a role in the\nreasoning the argument contains;\nrestating the content of rhetorical questions and other stylistic\ndevices that may obscure the meaning of the argument\u2019s\ncomponents;\nclarifying incomplete, vague or ambiguous claims and utterances;\nand/or\nrecognizing components of the argument which are not explicitly\nexpressed.\n\n\nSystems of informal logic may standardize arguments in a variety of\nways. In its simplest form, a standardized argument is a list of\npremises and a conclusion (the argument\u2019s inference is the\nimplicit move from the premises to the conclusion). EXAMPLE 1 above\ncan be standardized as follows.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Small businesses are important because they provide\nopportunities for entrepreneurs and create meaningful jobs with\ngreater job satisfaction than positions with larger, traditional\ncompanies. \n\n\n\nPremise: [Small businesses] provide opportunities for\nentrepreneurs and create meaningful jobs with greater job satisfaction\nthan positions with larger, traditional companies. Conclusion:\nSmall businesses are important. \n\n\nIn this example, the word \u201cbecause\u201d functions as an\n\u201cinference indicator\u201d which tells us that the claim that\nfollows is a premise offered in support of the conclusion which\nprecedes it. In other cases, words like \u201cfor,\u201d\n\u201cgiven that,\u201d \u201csince,\u201d are ways of introducing\npremises, while words like \u201cso,\u201d \u201chence,\u201d\n\u201cthus,\u201d \u201ctherefore,\u201d are used to introduce\nconclusions. \n\nVerbal inference indicators are an important, but not necessary or\nsufficient, sign of argument. For indicator words can be used in other\nways (\u201cbecause\u201d may indicate an explanation rather than an\nargument, a causal connection, emphasis of some sort, a temporal\norder, etc.), and are not necessary when a context makes it clear that\nsomeone is providing reasons for a conclusion. \n3.1 Implicit Premises and Conclusions\n\nOne issue that is frequently addressed in standardization is an\nargument\u2019s dependence on premises and conclusions which are\nassumed but not explicitly stated. \n\nThe following report from the New Hampshire Rockingham News\n(30/8/2002) comments on a court case which sent the organizer of dog\nfights to jail for cruelty to animals. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: A co-ordinator for the Humane Society supported a prison\nsentence, claiming that the minor penalties normally associated with\nmisdemeanor convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this\ncase.\n\n\nWe can standardize the co-ordinator\u2019s argument as follows.\n\n\nPremise: The minor penalties normally associated with\nmisdemeanor convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this case.\n\nImplicit Premise 1: Penalties for crimes should have a\ndeterrent effect.\n\nImplicit Premise 2: Prison is a sufficient deterrent.\n\nConclusion: A prison sentence, but not the minor penalties\nnormally associated with misdemeanor convictions, is appropriate. \n\n\nIt is important to recognize the assumption which is rendered as\nImplicit Premise 1 (which is, in Toulmin\u2019s words,\n\u201ca warrant\u201d) for it is a claim that the argument depends\non when the arguer concludes that the penalties normally associated\nwith misdemeanors are not a sufficient deterrent in this case. The\nremaining part of the conclusion \u2014 the suggestion that a prison\nsentence is appropriate \u2014 depends on Implicit Premise\n2, which recognizes the further assumption that this will have a\ndeterrent effect. \n\nRecognizing the argument\u2019s implicit premises prepares the way\nfor argument evaluation, for they, like the argument\u2019s explicit\npremise, need to be evaluated when the argument is assessed. If we\nreject the implicit premises (by, e.g., arguing that the goal of\ncriminal penalties should be retribution, not deterrence), then the\nargument fails to provide convincing evidence for its conclusion. \n\nArguments with implicit premises or conclusions are recognized in\nancient discussions of enthymemes: syllogisms with unstated\npremises. A contemporary example is American Vice-President Dick\nCheney\u2019s defense of the Bush administration\u2019s decision not\nto try foreigners charged with terrorism offenses as prisoners of war\n(something that would guarantee legal protections for those accused of\nterrorism). \n\nEXAMPLE 7 (from a report in the New York Times, 15/11/2001):\n\n\u201cThe basic proposition here is that somebody who comes into the\nUnited States of America illegally ... is not a lawful combatant....\nThey don\u2019t [therefore] deserve to be treated as a prisoner of\nwar.\u201d\n\n\nWe can standardize the argument as: \n\nEXAMPLE 8:\n\nPremise: Somebody who comes into the United States of America\nillegally ... is not a lawful combatant.\n\nImplicit Premise: Someone who is not a lawful combatant\ndoesn\u2019t deserve to be treated as a prisoner of war.\n\nConclusion: They don\u2019t deserve to be treated as a\nprisoner of war.\n\n\n\nAs in many other cases, the argument\u2019s implicit premise\nidentifies the link that ties the explicit premise to the conclusion.\nWhen we evaluate the argument, it raises a number of questions. How\nshould a \u201clawful combatant\u201d be defined? Why are combatants\nwho illegally enter a country for the purpose of war (in undertaking\nsurveillance or going behind enemy lines) widely recognized as\nprisoners of war? What are our moral obligations to combatants, lawful\nand unlawful? \n\nIn other enthymemes, the conclusion of an argument may be unstated. In\na debate over the question whether witnesses to a crime can be\ntrusted, an arguer might state: \u201cThey are friends of\nthe accused, and no friends of the accused can be trusted.\u201d Such\nclaims clearly suggest that \u201cThey cannot be\ntrusted,\u201d a claim that needs to be recognized as an implicit\nconclusion in an attempt to standardize and evaluate the argument.\n\n\nAs in the case of verbal arguments, implicit premises and conclusions\nplay an important role in many visual and multimodal arguments. In\nEXAMPLE 9 (below), the title \u201cJust Add Vodka\u201d is\nsuperimposed over a gigantic bottle of vodka pouring its contents on\nthe scene below. Outside the vodka splash, one sees a sleepy hamlet.\nInside the vodka splash, it is transformed into a bustling cityscape\nwhich boasts skyscrapers and a nightlife with lights, people,\nnightclubs, bars, and restaurants. \n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nThe image in this advertisement is a visual metaphor which suggests\nthat vodka can transform one\u2019s life in the way that it\ntransforms the scene in the advertisement, turning the (dreary) life\none lives in a sleepy hamlet into the kind of exciting nightlife one\nfinds in a cosmopolitan urban center. Insofar as this message is\nfeatured in an advertisement, we can plausibly understand this message\nas a proposed reason to buy the vodka in question. \n\nWe might standardize the argument this implies as follows. \n\nEXAMPLE 9:\n\n(Visual) Premise: If you drink our vodka, it can transform\nyour night life in the way it transforms the village in the\nphotograph: into an exciting major city.\n\nImplicit Premise: A life of urban excitement is preferable to\nthe quiet life of a village.\n\nConclusion: You should \u201cJust Add Vodka\u201d to your\nlife.\n\n\nI have summarized the first premise in the argument in a way that\nrefers to the image because it is difficult to fully capture the\n(almost magical) transformation the advertisement promises if we try\nto translate it into words. The implicit premise in the\nstandardization is a key part of the argument because it is a key\nassumption made in the move from the (visually) explicit premise to\nthe conclusion. So understood the argument can be analyzed and\nevaluated as an argument which has a questionable explicit and\nimplicit premise (and an inference which is an instance of the fallacy\n\u201cAffirming the Consequent\u201d). \n\nThe attempt to identify implicit premises or conclusions in an\nargument can raise some significant theoretical questions when it is\nstandardized. All arguments rely on many assumptions, raising the\nquestion whether and when and how they should be recognized. In cases\nin which it is clear that an unstated premise or conclusion needs to\nbe recognized, it can often be interpreted in different ways. \n\nOne principle that many systems of informal logic use to choose\nbetween alternative interpretations of implicit argument components is\nthe \u201cPrinciple of Charity.\u201d It favors an interpretation of\nan argument which makes it as credible as possible. In many\nsituations, this can best be accomplished by attributing it a\n\u201clogical minimum,\u201d understood as the weakest implicit\ncomponent needed to successfully connect the argument\u2019s premises\nto its conclusion. \n3.2 Key Component Tables and Diagrams\n\nStandardizing arguments by listing their premises and conclusions is\none way to delineate the content of an argument and prepare it for\nevaluation. But standardizing of this sort has a major shortcoming,\nfor it does not distinguish between different kinds of inferences an\nargument may contain. One way to address the issues that this raises\nis by standardizing an argument with a table that catalogues an\nargument\u2019s premises and conclusions (a Key Component or\n\u201cKC\u201d table) and combining it with an argument diagram (a\n\u201cmapping\u201d) that depicts the structure of its inferences.\n\n\nIn EXAMPLE 10 (below), I have used this method to standardize an\nargument that Kretzmann uses in his account of the medieval\nphilosopher William of Sherwood, where he concludes that it is likely\nthat William was a Master at the University of Paris. The first column\nof the KC table lists the premises and conclusion of the argument; the\nsecond assigns them their role as premise or conclusion; the third\nlists the source from which they are derived. The diagram that follows\ndepicts the relationships between the argument\u2019s key components,\nusing arrows to indicate the inferences it includes. \n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nThis standardization shows that the Sherwood argument is supported by\nthree \u201cconvergent\u201d premises which provide three\nindependent reasons that support the argument\u2019s conclusion in\ndifferent ways. \n\nIn other instances of argument, two or more \u201clinked\u201d\npremises combine to support a conclusion with a single inference. The\nargument \u201cThe murderer was very strong, so George cannot be the\nmurderer.\u201d is an enthymeme which assumes that \u201cGeorge is\nnot very strong.\u201d Using square brackets ([ ]) to indicate this\nimplicit component, we can standardize the argument with the following\nKC table and diagram. In this case, the linked premises are indicated\nwith a plus sign (\u201c+\u201d) that connects them in the diagram.\nIt indicates that they support a conclusion (only) when combined. \n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nThe use of KC tables and diagrams is not limited to purely verbal\narguments. When arguments have non-verbal key components, visual and\nmultimodal premises and conclusions can be recognized in a key\ncomponent table by ostension, or by reproducing them in some way. Once\nthey are identified in a KC table, the inferences such arguments\ndepend on can be mapped in standard ways. \n\nThe following table and diagram standardizes EXAMPLE 3, which contains\nan inference from three linked premises (two visual and one verbal) to\nthe conclusion that there is water on the planet Mars. \n\n\n\n\nKC table are not the only way to diagram the structure of real life\narguments. Diagramming (mapping) has its own history, which\nincorporates many different ways of diagramming arguments. The\nusefulness of diagramming is already recognized in Whately 1826 and,\nin the early twentieth century, in Wigmore 1913, who develops a form\nof mapping (\u201cevidence charts\u201d) designed to portray and\nanalyze complex chains of judicial reasoning. \n\nThe development of informal logic has kindled a renewed interest in\ndifferent kinds of diagrams which are supported by the development of\nassociated software (Rationale, Reason!Able, Araucaria, Athena,\nCompendium, Theseus) and online aids (Debate Mapper, TruthMapping.Com,\nArgunet, Agora). \n3.3 Supplemented Diagrams\n\nKC tables and diagrams prepare the way for argument evaluation by\nclarifying the internal structure and content of an argument. Other\naspects of an argument that may need to be considered in argument\nassessment can be included in a \u201csupplemented\u201d diagram\nwhich adds an account of the context in which it is embedded. Three\naspects of arguments merit note in this regard. \n\nThe first is the audience to which an argument is addressed.\nMost real life arguments are used in an attempt to convince some\nintended audience of some point of view. In view of this, successful\narguments must be built with this in mind. \n\nA convincing argument for the conclusion that the United Nations\ncannot be trusted must address different issues when it is directed at\na Chinese, Norwegian, Kenyan, Israeli, Swiss, Palestinian, etc.\naudience. As rhetoric has emphasized since its beginnings, this means\nthat successful arguers must construct their arguments in ways that\nrecognize the beliefs, attitudes and values of their intended audience\n(and in this sense \u2018speak\u2019 to them). Tindale (1999, 2004,\n2010) has imported this notion into informal logic, advocating an\ninformal logic that incorporates an analysis of audience. \n\nA second contextual factor relevant to the evaluation of an argument\nis the goal of the arguer. As Hitchcock 2002 points out, acts of\narguing may make a declaration (\u201cThe evidence shows that you\ncommitted an assault, so I find you guilty as charged.\u201d);\ncommand or make a request (\u201cYou were there, so you must tell us\nwhat happened.\u201d \u201cThe children are shivering, so please\nclose the door.\u201d); make a promise (\u201cI know it matters to\nyou, so I promise to go tomorrow.\u201d); express a sentiment\n(\u201cWhat we did was inexcusable, so we beg your\nforgiveness\u201d); and function in many other ways. \n\nAs Pinto and Gilbert have emphasized, this means that a successful\nargument (which is successful in the sense that it accomplishes the\narguer\u2019s purpose in presenting the argument), may produce a\nwithholding of assent (or full assent) to some proposition, a\nparticular attitude, an emotional state like fear or hope, or a\ncertain kind of behavior (by, e.g., as when an argument demands that\npeople take up arms against a foe or take action in support of social\nchange). When one bargains, the goal of argument is not truth, but a\nbargain that serves one\u2019s interests. As Hoffman 2016 notes, an\nargument may not aim to resolve disagreement, but to promote\nreflection and the raising of important questions. \n\nThe different goals arguer\u2019s try to achieve via argument may\nmake their success and legitimacy turn on norms and rules that add to\n(or subtract from) the traditional strictures that guide argument\nevaluation. In some circumstances, it makes ultimatums, exaggerations,\nthreats and insults a permissible element of arguing. In sharp\ncontrast, they are unacceptable in attempts to determine what is true\nfrom a scientific point of view, where such behaviors are instances of\nthe fallacy ad baculum. \n\nWalton 2007 accommodates the different goals associated with real life\narguments by distinguishing between different kinds of\ndialogues in which arguing occurs. The rules for a particular\nkind of dialogue define what types of argumentative moves are allowed,\nwhat kinds of questions and responses are permitted, and what norms\narguments must adhere to. \n\nThe seven basic types of dialogue he distinguishes can be summarized\nas follows.\n\n\n\nType\nSituation\nArguers\u2019 Goal\nDialogue Goal\n\nPersuasion\nConflict of Opinion\nPersuade Other Party\nResolve Issue \n\nInquiry\nNeed to Have Proof\nVerify Evidence\nProve Hypothesis \n\nDiscovery\nNeed for Explanation\nFind a Hypothesis\nSupport Hypothesis \n\nNegotiation\nConflict of Interests\nSecure Interests\nSettle Issue \n\nInformation\nNeed Information\nAcquire Information\nExchange Information \n\nDeliberation\nPractical Choice\nFit Goals and Actions\nDecide What to Do \n\nEristic\nPersonal Conflict\nAttack an Opponent\nReveal Deep Conflict \n\n\n\nIn dialogues of inquiry, arguments are used as tools in an attempt to\nestablish what is true. So understood, arguments must adhere to strict\nstandards that determine what counts as evidence and counter-evidence\nfor some point of view. In eristic dialogue, arguing is combat and the\naim is to vanquish one\u2019s opponent (and humiliate them, ideally\nby wowing one\u2019s audience with one\u2019s mental gymnastics). In\ndoing so, sophistical tricks and fallacious reasoning are welcome if\nthey serve this end. \n\nWalton\u2019s dialogue typology leaves room for more narrowly defined\nkinds of dialogue. Collective bargaining is a specific kind of\nnegotiation dialogue which is governed by legal rules and well\nestablished practices that very precisely delineate what is and is not\nallowed in bargaining. Different subdialogues are associated with\ndifferent norms, rules and practices. \n\nA third contextual factor that may warrant comment in a supplemented\ndiagram is the dialectical context in which an argument occurs. In his\naccount of argument, Johnson 2000 distinguishes between the\n\u201cillative\u201d core of an argument and the argument\u2019s\n\u201cdialectical tier,\u201d understanding the former as a\n\u201cproto-argument\u201d which consists of a set of premises\noffered in support of some conclusion. It is the kernel of an\nargument, but he considers it an argument in the full sense only if it\nfully engages the dialectical tier, considering alternative points of\nview, addressing objections to the conclusion it proposes. \n",
