    "main_text": "Single Person Interpretations\n6. Single Person Interpretations\n\nThe PD is usually thought to illustrate conflict between individual\nand collective rationality, but the multiple player form (or something\nvery similar) has also been interpreted as demonstrating problems\nwithin standard conceptions of individual rationality. One such\ninterpretation, elucidated in Quinn, derives from an example of\nParfit's. A medical device enables electric current to be applied to a\npatient's body in increments so tiny that there is no perceivable\ndifference between adjacent settings. You are attached to the device\nand given the following choice every day for ten years: advance the\ndevice one setting and collect a thousand dollars, or leave it where\nit is and get nothing. Since there is no perceivable difference\nbetween adjacent settings, it is apparently rational to advance the\nsetting each day. But at the end of ten years the pain is so great\nthat a rational person would sacrifice all his wealth to return to the\nfirst setting.\n\nWe can view the situation here as a multi-player PD in which each\n\u201cplayer\u201d is the temporal stage of a single person. So\nviewed, it has at least two features that were not discussed in\nconnection with the multi-player examples. First, the moves of the\nplayers are sequential rather than simultaneous (and each player has\nknowledge of preceding moves). Second, there is the matter of\ngradation. Increases in electric current between adjacent settings are\nimperceptible, and therefore irrelevant to rational decision-making,\nbut sums of a number such increases are noticeable and highly\nrelevant. Neither of these features, however, is peculiar to\none-person examples. Consider, for example, the choice between a\npolluting and non-polluting means of waste disposal. Each resident of\na lakeside community may dump his or her garbage in the lake or use a\nless convenient landfill. It is reasonable to suppose that each acts\nin the knowledge of how others have acted before. (See\n\u201cAsynchronous Moves\u201d below.) It is also reasonable to\nsuppose that addition of one can of garbage to the lake has no\nperceptible effect on water quality, and therefore no effect on the\nwelfare of the residents. The fact that the dilemma remains suggests\nthat PD-like situations sometimes involve something more than a\nconflict between individual and collective rationality. In the\none-person example, our understanding that we care more about our\noverall well-being than that of our temporal stages does not (by\nitself) eliminate the argument that it is rational to continue to\nadjust the setting. Similarly, in the pollution example, a decision to\nlet collective rationality override individual rationality may not\neliminate the argument for excessive dumping. It seems appropriate,\nhowever, to separate this issue from that raised in the standard PD.\nGradations that are imperceptible individually, but weighty en masse\ngive rise to intransitive preferences. This is a challenge to standard\naccounts of rationality whether or not it arises in a PD-like\nsetting.\n\nA second one-person interpretation of the PD is suggested in Kavka,\n1991. On Kavka's interpretation, the prisoners are not temporal\nstages, but rather \u201csubagents\u201d reflecting different\ndesiderata that I might bring to bear on a decision. Let us imagine\nthat I am hungry and considering buying a snack. The options open to\nme are:\n\nBuy a scoop of chocolate gelato.\nBuy a scoop of orange sherbet.\nBuy a granola bar.\nBuy nothing.\n\n\nMy health-conscious side, \u201cArnold,\u201d orders these options\nin the following order: \\(c\\), \\(b\\), \\(d\\), \\(a\\). My taste-conscious\nside, \u201cEppie,\u201d ranks them: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(d\\), \\(c\\).\nSuch inner conflict among preferences might often be resolved in ways\nconsistent with standard views about individual choice. My overall\npreference ordering, for example, might be determined from a weighted\naverage of the utilities that Arnold and Eppie assign to each of the\noptions. It is also possible, Kavka suggests, that my inner conflicts\nare resolved as if they were a result of strategic interaction among\nrational subagents. In this case, Arnold and Eppie can each choose\neither to insist on getting their way \\((\\bI)\\) or to\nacquiesce to a compromise \\((\\bA)\\). The interaction between\nsubagents can then be represented by the following payoff matrix,\nwhere Arnold plays row and Eppie plays column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bA\\)\n\\(\\bI\\) \n\n\\(\\bA\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(a\\) \n\n\\(\\bI\\)\n\\(c\\)\n\\(d\\)  \n\n\nExamination of the table and preference orderings confirms that we\nagain have an intrapersonal PD. Kavka argues that a story like this\nmight \u201cprovide a psychologically plausible picture of how\ninternal conflict can lead to suboptimal action.\u201d It also\nundermines a standard view that choices reflect values in favor of one\nthat they partially reflect, \u201cthe structure of inner\nconflict.\u201d\n",
