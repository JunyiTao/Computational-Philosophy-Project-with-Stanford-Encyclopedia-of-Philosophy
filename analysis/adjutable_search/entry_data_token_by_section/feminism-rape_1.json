    "main_text": "Criteria: What Counts?\n2. Criteria: What Counts?\n\nFeminists are committed to ensuring that women\u2019s and\ngirls\u2019 experiences of sexual violation are taken seriously as\nsuch, that the harm they suffer therein is recognized, and that those\nwho inflict that harm are held accountable. Achieving these goals has\noften involved arguing that certain kinds of encounters that have\npreviously not been socially or legally recognized as rape should be\nso recognized\u2014thus, challenging overly restrictive ideas (often\nencoded in law) about what counts as rape (Burgess-Jackson 1996,\n77-86; Sanday 1996, 161-183; Bevacqua 2000). Obvious examples include\nthe abolition of marital-rape exemptions and the recognition of date\nand acquaintance rape. Feminists have also challenged the idea\n(derived from English common law) that, in order for an encounter to\ncount as rape, the victim must have displayed \u201cutmost\u201d (or\neven any) physical resistance, as well as the assumption that rape\nmust involve vaginal penetration by a penis (victims are raped orally,\nanally, and/or with fingers or objects).\n\nThere are varying feminist views about whether and how the concept of\nrape, and hence its framing in the law, requires further renegotiation\nor expansion.\n",
