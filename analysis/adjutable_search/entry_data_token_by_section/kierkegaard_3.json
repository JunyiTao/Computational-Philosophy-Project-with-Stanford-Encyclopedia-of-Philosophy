    "main_text": "The \u201cSpheres of Existence\u201d or \u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d || The Aesthetic\n3.1 The Aesthetic\n\nThe first volume of Either/Or consists of the papers of a\nnameless young man, known only as \u201cA\u201d, who in a series of\nsometimes witty, sometimes rambling, sometimes astute and sometimes\ndespairing writings, presents a view of what it means to live\n\u201caesthetically\u201d. As is clearest in his essay \u201cCrop\nRotation\u201d, he sets himself the task of living to avoid boredom\nat all costs. On one level, the aesthetic life can be understood as\nthe ceaseless pursuit of \u201cthe interesting\u201d. But there is\nan irony in this: paralleling Kant\u2019s notion of a judgment of\nbeauty as involving disinterested satisfaction, the aesthete\nultimately brings an attitude of disinterested, disengaged\ncontemplation to life as a whole, viewing it as a spectacle to be\nsavored rather than as involving \u201ctasks\u201d or projects to be\nfulfilled. His is the view of a spectator rather than a player. Often\nseen as a critique of German romanticism, this highlights a vital\ndistinction in Kierkegaard\u2019s thought, between the engaged and\ndisengaged perspectives. Kierkegaard thinks that the disengaged,\ntheoretical standpoint on life will necessarily overlook crucial\nexistential problems, since these only properly come into view from a\nfirst-person perspective. To draw on one of Climacus\u2019 examples,\nunderstanding in the abstract that since I am mortal, I will one day\ndie, is very different from earnestly confronting what my certain\ndeath means for how I should live my life.\n\nThe aesthete emerges as an isolated figure, recommending the reader of\n\u201cCrop Rotation\u201d to avoid boredom and preserve freedom by\nrejecting anything which involves the self in relationships of\ninter-dependence, such as marriage, friendship, or useful career.\nWhile recognizing most people\u2019s need to work for a living, he\nnevertheless counsels against allowing career or other people to be\npart of one\u2019s identity-conferring commitments. In his critique\nof the aesthetic life, the ethicist Judge William goes on to argue\nthat this is to cut oneself off from precisely the kind of freely\nchosen projects that give human life its value and purpose.\n\nThe two extremes of the aesthete life, contrasting sensuousness with\nmisused imaginative reflection, are illustrated by two kinds of\nseducer. The first, illustrated by Don Juan (which \u201cA\u201d\napproaches through the version of the character in Mozart\u2019s\nopera Don Giovanni in his essay \u201cThe Immediate Erotic\nStages or the Musical Erotic\u201d) has as the object of his desire\nthe sensual alone, as opposed to the features of a woman which make\nher a distinct individual. Nor, on this account, is Don Juan himself\nan individual, since to be so is to be determined \u201cby\nspirit\u201d. Indeed, \u201cA\u201d claims, once we think of Don\nJuan as an individual\u2014as opposed to a sensuous force that can\nonly properly be expressed in music\u2014he becomes a\ncomical figure.\n\nAs his papers reveal, one way in which \u201cA\u201d differs from\nDon Juan is that \u201cA\u201d sees a far greater use for the\nimagination. \u201cA\u201d contrasts a \u201cvulgar\u201d\nunderstanding of crop rotation\u2014always seeking new external\nstimuli\u2014with tackling boredom through utilizing the capacity of\nthe imagination. By standing back from the world, relating to it in a\ndisengaged manner, one\u2019s experiences become raw material for\nimaginative possibilities, such as by cultivating arbitrariness\n(reading part of a book; seeing the middle of a play). \u201cA\u201d\nhimself fully realizes (see for instance the section entitled\n\u201cDiapsalmata\u201d) that his lifestyle has led to a kind of\ndespair\u2014he claims that living \u201cartistically\u201d is only\npossible once \u201chope has been thrown overboard\u201d (EO I\n292/SKS 2, 282)\u2014but he sees aesthetic possibilities even in his\ndespair. After all, tragedy is one of the great categories of drama,\nand \u201cA\u201d seems to have the capacity to step back from and\nobserve his own life as a kind of tragic play. Perhaps \u201cA\u201d\nthinks that despair is preferable to boredom and can thus be a\nstrategy in its avoidance.\n\nThe flaws of his worldview are writ large in the demonic author of the\nlast and longest part of the first volume of Either/Or, the\n\u201cSeducer\u2019s Diary\u201d. (The text leaves unclear whether\nwe are supposed to take this to be \u201cA\u201d himself.) This\nsecond seducer\u2014another Johannes\u2014represents an extreme\nmisuse of the imagination: someone so far gone in the life of the\nimagination as to have become damaged by it. Johannes gains his\ngratification from the art of planning seduction, with ultimate\nsuccess sparking boredom and the desire to move on. The Diary\u2019s\npainstaking account of the details of a particular seduction plot\nreveal him as deeply manipulative; thoroughly disengaged (viewing\nwoman as\u2014merely\u2014an endlessly fascinating topic for his\nobservations and reflections); and ultimately self-deceived, both\nabout his motives and about whether a life lived almost entirely in\nthe realm of the imagination is a defensible human life. Johannes the\nSeducer has embraced a reflective type of enjoyment, including\n\u201creflective grief\u201d, as a form of aesthetic experience that\ncan be sustained, perhaps recognizing that the \u201cimmediate\u201d\nsensuousness of Don Juan cannot be realized in an actual person.\nNevertheless, his turn away from \u201cimmediacy\u201d does not seem\nto work; he constantly seems to need jolts of immediate enjoyment and\ndesire to rejuvenate his projects. When his seduction of his quarry\nCordelia finally succeeds, the actual sexual encounter seems strangely\nanti-climactic, and it is immediately followed by boredom and even\ncynicism. Yet one level of the Seducer\u2019s self-deception subtly\nindicates the demands of the ethical: by convincing himself that he\nhasn\u2019t really treated these women so badly, Johannes shows that\non some level he recognizes that the ethical does make demands on him.\nMany of these points are subtly elaborated in Karsten Harries\u2019\nrich commentary on Either/Or (Harries 2010).\n",
