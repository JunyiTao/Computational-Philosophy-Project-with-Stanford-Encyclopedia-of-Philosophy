    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nVarious classifications exist of Suhrawardi\u2019s works, with either\nthree (Massigon), four (Corbin, Walbridge and Ziai), five (Nasr 1964,\n58\u20139) or six (Kadivar 2011, 297\u20138) categories (Suh. 1993a,\nvii\u2013xvii, xviii\u2013xx). Although very few of his works can be\ndated, Walbridge (2017, 257\u20138), guided by indications found in\nhis works, established the following classification that takes into\naccount the overlapping redaction of some of the texts: (i)\njuvenilia (before ca. 1180), such as Temples of\nLight (Suh. 1996), his allegories (many in Persian) depicting the\njourney of the soul (Suh. 1976, 1993c, 1999b, 2001, 2007), but also a\ntranslation into Persian of Avicenna\u2019s Treatise of the\nBird, a commentary of the latter\u2019s Pointers and\nReminders, and his take on the latter\u2019s Treatise on\nLove; (ii) mature Peripatetic works (from 1180 to 1186), like\nFlashes of Light and Intimations (completed before\nPI), a pr\u00e9cis of Avicennan Peripatetic theses\n(Suh. 1993a, 1\u2013121 [metaphysics], 2009a [logic, physics,\nmetaphysics]; cf. Ibn Kammuna 2003, 2009); (iii) Philosophy of\nIllumination (completed in 1186) in which he details the main\nrules, principles and arguments of his ishraqi) philosophical\nsystem, the symbolism of Light resting at the heart of his\nreconfiguration of a number of cosmological and ontological\nPeripatetic theses put forward by Avicenna ; (iv) other Peripatetic\nworks (completed by 1186): Paths and Havens (completed when\nhe was almost 30; probably early 1180s) (Suh. 1993a, 194\u2013506\n[metaphysics], 2006 [logic], 2015 [physics]), and Opposites\n(Suh. 1993a, 124\u201392 [metaphysics], cf. 2009b), revisiting issues\ndiscussed in the Philosophy of Illumination; and (v) other\nshort works (from 1180 to 1185), such as Tablets for \u2018Imad (Suh.\n2001, 31\u201398 [Ar.], 1993c, 110\u201395 [Pers.], 1976,\n99\u2013116 [Corbin]), and his shorter Book of Hours-like\nArabic prayers, supplications (du\u2018a) and intimate\ndevotions (munajat), \u2018occult invocations\u2019\n(prayers to celestial bodies) (Walbridge 2011; Suh., 1976),\ncommentaries on some verses of the Qur\u2019an (Nurbakhsh 2007), and\npoetry (Suh. 2005). \n\nCorbin (d.1978) noted that there might not have been a purely\nPeripatetic intellectual period, though Suhrawardi asserts he defended\nthe approach in his youth (PI, \u00a7166), if, indeed, he\ncomposed most of his treatises over a very short span of time,\nprobably during the course of about ten years. Moreover, a number of\nhis works expound both Peripatetic and ishraqi principles,\nlike Tablets to \u2018Imad (written after PI,\nduring the last five years of his life) and Temples of Light\n(Suh. 1996, 1976, 139\u201347). Likewise, although\nIntimations is said to be written according to the\nPeripatetic tradition (PI, \u00a73) whose principles\nSuhrawardi\u2019s reexamined (Suh. 1993a, 2), it prepares the ground\nfor some of the Philosophy of Illumination\u2019s more\ndistinctive Illuminationist positions (Suh. 1993a, 70\u20138,\n105\u201321; (Walbridge 2017, 256\u20139). \n\nThus, one must take into account the interrelations between\nSuhrawardi\u2019s five major philosophical works, which contain\ncross-references, to grasp fully his system as a whole. Walbridge\n(2017, 258) proposes the following order of Suhrawardi\u2019s majors\nworks: (i) Intimations (completed before PI); (ii)\nPhilosophy of Illumination (completed in 1186); (iii)\nPaths and Havens and Flashes of Light (written\nsimultaneously with PI, but completed later, cf. Suh. 1991,\n142.10, 146.14 [Najafquli ed., 175.19-20], cf. 1988, 207.5, 215.6,\n2001, 241.2-4); and (iv) Opposites (written after the\ncompletion of PI and Paths and Havens) (cf.\nSuhrawardi\u2019s order: Intimations, then\nOpposites, followed by Paths and Havens, and ending\nwith PI). \n\nIn his quest to revive the intellectual heritage of all those who had\nmastered \u2018true\u2019 knowledge, i.e. that of the Ancients for\nthe East and the West, Suhrawardi tapped into an experiential-like\ntype of knowledge. In his \u2019s Philosophy of\nIllumination, he mentioned that the work was written with the\nobjective of disclosing what he says he \u201cobtained through my\nintuition during my retreats and visions. [\u2026] the present work has\nanother method and provides a shorter path to knowledge [\u2026] I did\nnot first arrive at it through cogitation; rather, it was acquired\nthrough something else. Subsenquently I sought proof for it, so that,\nshould I cease contemplating the proof, nothing would make me fall\ninto doubt. In all that I have said about the science of lights and\nthat which is and is not based upon it, I have been assisted by those\nwho have traveled the path of God. This science is the very intuition\nof the inspired and illumined Plato, the guide and master of\nphilosophy\u201d, and those who came before and after him\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a72\u20134). This is the ishraqi\nmethod, with all its principles and rules, that builds upon, modifies\nand complements the principles at the heart of the Peripatetic method\n(notably Avicenna\u2019s). It seems reasonable to cast\nSuhrawardi\u2019s project as a critique of Avicenna\u2019s Plato and\nNeoplatonizing brand of Peripateticism, similar to the various\ncritiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1142), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and al-Ghazali\n(d.1111), etc.\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s works circulated mainly within traditional circles\nof learning in the Islamic East. At the beginning of the\n20th century and in the wake of the works of Bernard Carra\nde Vaux (1902), Max Horten (1912), Otto Spies and Sarfaraz K. Khatak\n(1935), and Helmut Ritter (1938), the French Iranologist, Henry Corbin\nbegan to study Suhrawardi\u2019s works after having received, from\nLouis Massigion, a copy of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi\u2019s commentary\non the Philosophy of Illumination. Corbin embarked on a\nlifelong project of edition, translation and study of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s works. A first volume, published in Istanbul in\n1945 (Suh. 1993a), contained the metaphysics of three major Arabic\nworks of Suhrawardi. Corbin then edited, in 1952, the Arabic\nmagnum opus, the Philosophy of Illumination (Suh.\n1993b, 1999a, 1986), together with two minor works. He went on to\nwrite a number of translations and studies, namely Suhrawardi et\nles platoniciens de Perse (Corbin 1971; cf. Abu Rayyan 1969; Suh.\n1999b). In 1970, Hossein Nasr edited fourteen of his Persian texts\n(two attributed to him), many allegorical or mystical in nature (Suh.\n1976, 1993c, 1999b). \n",
