    "main_text": "Forgiveness as a Response to Wrongdoing\n1. Forgiveness as a Response to Wrongdoing\n\nAn inevitable and unfortunate fact of life is that we are often\nmistreated by others. Forgiveness concerns one kind of response to\nthose who wrong us. From the ancient Greeks to the present day,\nforgiveness has typically been regarded as a personal response to\nhaving been injured or wronged, or as a condition one seeks or hopes\nis bestowed upon one for having wronged someone else.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines\n\u2018forgivable\u2019, the first entry under the general term\n\u2018forgive\u2019, as that which \u201cmay be forgiven,\npardonable, excusable\u201d, referring thereby to the quality of\ndeserving to be forgiven. Notwithstanding the association with\nexcusing conditions, forgiving is not, strictly speaking, equivalent\nto excusing. For wrongdoing that is excused entirely, there is nothing\nto forgive, since (as we shall see) agents who are fully excused are\nnot blameworthy or culpable. Moreover, the application of the concept\nof forgiveness to non-moral behavior, as in the case of a forgivably\npoor musical performance by a pianist, shows that forgiveness is not\nalways or necessarily a moral term. For this reason, there may be\nsimilar practices of forgiveness in non-moral arenas of normative\nappraisal (Haji 1998). However, we shall focus here on forgiveness as\nit pertains to moral appraisal and moral responsibility. Further,\nwhile most of our discussion will be focused on forgiveness for\nconduct, we note the possibility that one may also be forgiven for\none\u2019s character or the kind of person one is (Bell 2008).\n",
