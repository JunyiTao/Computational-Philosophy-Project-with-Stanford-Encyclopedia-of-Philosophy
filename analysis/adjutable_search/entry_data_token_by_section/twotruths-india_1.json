We\nwill examine conventional truth first. This will provide the argument\nin support of the second claim. In the Abhidharmako\u015ba\nVasubandu defines conventional truth/reality as follows: \u201cAn\nentity, the cognition of which does not arise when it is destroyed\nand, mentally divided, is conventionally existent like a pot and\nwater. Ultimate existence is otherwise.\u201d ([AK] 6.4, Mngon\npa khu 7ab) Whatever is, on this definition, designated as\n\u201cconventionally existent\u201d is taken to be\n\u201cconventionally real\u201d or conventional truth when the idea\nor concept of which ceases to arise when it is physically destroyed,\nby means of a hammer for instance. Or its properties such as shape are\nstripped away from it by means of subjecting it under analysis,\nthereby conceptually excluding them. A pot and water are designated as\nconventionally existent therefore conventionally real for the concept\n\u201cpot\u201d ceases to exist when it is destroyed physically, and\nthe concept \u201cwater\u201d no longer arises when we conceptually\nexclude from it its shape, colour etc.\n\nOn the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din definition, for an entity to be real,\nit does not need to be ultimately real, exclusively. For a thing to be\nultimately real is for that thing to be \u201cfoundationally\nexistent\u201d (dravya-sat / rdzas\n yod)[3]\n in contrast with being \u201ccompositely existent\u201d\n(avayavidravya / rdzas grub). By \u201cfoundationally existent\u201d\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din refer to the entity which is fundamentally\nreal, the concept or the cognition of which is not dependent on\nconceptual construction, hence not conceptually existent\n(praj\u00f1aptisat) nor a composition of the aggregative phenomena.\nIn the case of foundational existent there always remains something\nirreducible to which the concept of the thing applies, hence it is\nultimately real. A simple entity is not reducible to conceptual forms,\nor conventional designations, nor is it compositely existent entity.\nWe will have lot more to say on this point shortly.\n\nPot and water are not the foundational entities. They are rather\ncomposite entities (avayavi-dravya / rdzas grub). By composite entity,\nwe mean an entity or existent which is not fundamental, primary or\nsimple, but is rather a conceptually constructed\n(praj\u00f1aptisat), composition of various properties, and is thus\nreducible both physically and logically.\n\nHence for the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din, conventional reality\n(samv\u1e5btisatya), composite-existence (avayavi-dravya / rdzas\ngrub), and the lack of intrinsic reality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va) are\nall equivalents. A conventional reality is therefore characterised as\na reducible conventional entity on three grounds: (i) conventional\nreality is both physically and logically reducible, as it\ndisintegrates when it is subjected to physical destruction and\ndisappears from our minds when its parts are separated from it by\nlogical analysis; (ii) conventional reality borrows its identity from\nother things including its parts, concepts etc., it does not exist\nindependently in virtue of its intrinsic reality\n(ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va), the exclusion of its parts and concepts thus\naffects and reduces its inherent nature; and (iii) conventional\nreality is a product of mental constructions, like that of\nconventionally real wholes, causation, continuum etc, and it does not\nexists intrinsically.\n",
