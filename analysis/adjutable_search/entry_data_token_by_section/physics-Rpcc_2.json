    "main_text": "Historical Background\n3. Historical Background\n\nThe Direction of Time (Reichenbach 1956) was unfinished at\nthe time of Reichenbach\u2019s death in 1953. The manuscript was\nedited by his wife Maria Reichenbach, and published posthumously in\n1956. The book was concerned with temporally asymmetric\nphenomena\u2014phenomena that we associate with the distinction\nbetween the past and the future. It included major sections on the\nrole of time in classical physics, thermodynamics, statistical\nmechanics, and quantum mechanics. It also included a section on\ntemporal asymmetries in macrostatistics. Reichenbach had plans to\ninclude a final section on the subjective experience of time.\n\nThe book makes a number of important and original contributions. It\ncontains a detailed investigation into the philosophical foundations\nof statistical mechanics, especially examining the status of the\nsecond law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a\nclosed system can increase, but never decrease. Reichenbach explored\nconnections between statistical mechanics and the new field of\ninformation theory\u2014Shannon and Weaver\u2019s classic book\n(1949) on the topic had been published just a few years earlier. In\naddition to the asymmetry of entropy increase described by the second\nlaw of thermodynamics, the book examined other temporally asymmetric\nphenomena. One of these was the asymmetry of records: We have detailed\nrecords of past events, including human memories and human made\ndocuments such as records and history books, but also including\nnatural phenomena such as fossils, tree rings, and geological strata.\nThese records provide us with a rich source of information about the\npast. We have no comparable source of information about the future,\nalthough we can reliably predict certain events, such as solar\neclipses.\n\nA third important temporal asymmetry is the asymmetry of cause and\neffect. Causes invariably precede their effects in time. Reichenbach\nattempted to analyze causal direction in terms of macrostatistics or\nprobability. He appealed to his notion of screening-off to define a\nrelation of causal betweenness, and also to define causal direction.\nIt is in this latter context that the RCCP was introduced. The\nconnection between RCCP and causal direction will be discussed in\n Section 6\n below. Reichenbach also formulated a probabilistic theory of\ncausation, and explored the connections between these new ideas and\nthe mark method for distinguishing causal direction, which he\nhad proposed much earlier (Reichenbach 1958).\n\nRCCP connects with a number of threads in Reichenbach\u2019s thought.\nReichenbach had developed and defended a frequency interpretation of\nprobability (Reichenbach 1949), as well as a thoroughgoing\nprobabilistic epistemology (Reichenbach 1938) He had also explored the\nconnection between probability and causation in earlier works\n(Reichenbach 1925 [1978], 1930 [1978]). The Direction of Time\ntakes the project further in developing a probabilistic metaphysics.\nReichenbach had also explored the connection between causation and the\ndirection of time in Reichenbach (1925 [1978]) and Reichenbach (1958).\nThe latter work developed a causal theory of time in the context of\nrelativity theory.\n",
