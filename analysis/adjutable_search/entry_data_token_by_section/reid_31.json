    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || Arguments for God's Existence\n8.3 Arguments for God's Existence\n\n\nReid's treatment of arguments for God's existence is for the most part\nunoriginal, and freely makes use of ideas of many previous Christian\nthinkers along this well-worn trail. Reid's cosmological argument\nstems from Samuel Clarke's and features a priori justification of the\nprinciple, \u201cThat whatever begins to exist, must have a cause\nwhich produced it\u201d (EIP 6.6, 497). Reid defends this against a\nfew attacks associated with Hume. For example, if Hume's skepticism\nabout causation undermines this principle, Reid says that many\neveryday inferences would become unjustified (EIP 6.6, 497\u20138). Reid\nuses this principle in a cosmological argument, but only as recorded\nin his lecture notes (Natural Theology 66\u20137), which leaves\nmuch to be desired. Every being must be either contingent or\nnecessary. \u201cWe call that contingent which either might\nor might not be and that necessary which must be. Whatever\neither might or might not be depends on the will of some agent with\npower to bring it to pass or not...\u201d (Natural Theology\n66). Reid is then recorded to argue that to suggest that the\n\u201cSupreme Being\u201d exists contingently \u201cevidently would\nbe absurd\u201d (Natural Theology 66). He does not here\ndiscuss the unintelligibility of a one-directional infinite series of\ncontingent causes or of a circular series of contingent causes.\n\n \nReid gives the design argument more discussion (EIP 6.6,\n508\u20139). One first principle of necessary truth is \u201cthat\ndesign, and intelligence in the cause, may be inferred, with\ncertainty, from marks or signs of it in the effect\u201d (EIP\n6.6, 503). This is an unusual principle to denominate as a\nnecessary \u201cmetaphysical\u201d truth because it is an\nepistemic thesis about what it is permissible for one to\ninfer. He labors to show that this is a necessary first\nprinciple by saying, for example, that it is \u201ctoo\nuniversal to be the effect of reasoning\u201d (EIP 6.6,\n504). The first necessary principle serves as an opening\npremise in the argument, to which Reid adds some empirical\ndata. The second premise says, \u201cThat there are in fact\nthe clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of\nNature\u201d (EIP 6.6, 509). From these two premises Reid\nconcludes \u201cthat the works of Nature are the effects of a\nwise and intelligent cause\u201d (EIP 6.6, 510). \n\n\nTo the \u2018single-case\u2019 objection often credited to Hume, that\nthe design argument is not cogent since this is the only\nuniverse of which we are aware, Reid replies that the\nobjection \u201cis build on the supposition, that our\ninferring design from the strongest marks of it, is entirely\nowing to our past experience of having always found these two\nthings conjoined\u201d (EIP 6.6, 511). But if Hume's\ncriticism does pose a problem for the design inference, it\nalso undermines our belief in other minds. This is because\nReid also does not witness the intelligence of another person\nbringing about some effect (EIP 6.6, 511).\n\n\nThe first principle of necessary truth licensing inferences\nfrom signs of intelligence to intelligence pairs with another\nthat states that the belief in other minds is also a first\nprinciple (EIP 6.5, 484). Reid knows well how these two work\ntogether (EIP 6.5, 511\u201312) and as a result he unambiguously\nforeshadows the epistemological parity argument to be found in\nPlantinga's God and Other Minds (1990).\n",
