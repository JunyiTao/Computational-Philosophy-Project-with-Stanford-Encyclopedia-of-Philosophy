    "main_text": "Moral Risk and Special Obligations\n8. Moral Risk and Special Obligations\n\nSpecial relationships take many forms, and the parties to those\nrelationships range across the entire spectrum of moral character (at\nleast according to some views), from the extremely virtuous to the\ndownright bad, with most of us falling somewhere in the middle of that\nrange. This fact about the human beings who make promises, stand in\nfamilial relationships, and have friends, leads to the worry that\nspecial obligations, in certain circumstances, will license, and\nperhaps even require, very bad behavior.\n\nDean Cocking and Jeanette Kennett, in their \u201cFriendship and\nMoral Danger,\u201d offer a case in which one friend, Carl, calls\nupon another, Dave, to help him to hide the body of someone whom he\nhas killed (279\u2013280). What ought Dave to do in such a\ncircumstance? The worry is that if Dave has special obligations to his\nfriend Carl, then it seems that Dave ought to help Carl to hide the\nbody. But, in the absence of special obligations, it seems clear that\nDave ought to alert the police to what Carl has done. Does the\nfriendship between Dave and Carl provide them with a license or even a\nrequirement to act immorally (or, in a way such that in the absence of\nthe friendship, it would count as immoral) in order to protect one\nanother? Similarly, do Nazis have special obligations to one another\nto help each other with their genocidal plans? Do parents have\nobligations to protect their children, no matter what terrible crimes\ntheir children have committed?\n\nCocking and Kennett regard the claims or obligations of friendship as\nnon-moral claims. They use the likelihood of \u2018moral\ndanger\u2019 within friendship to undermine what they call\n\u201chighly-moralized\u201d accounts of friendship (280ff). Thus,\nfor them, the demands created by special relationships are not moral\ndemands. So, on their view, the non-moral special obligations of\nfriendship may certainly conflict with moral obligations, just as,\npresumably, reasons of self-interest or prudence may conflict with\nmoral demands. We then are left with the familiar problem of how we\nought to balance moral and non-moral reasons against one another.\n\nIn \u201cMoral Permissibility Constraints on Voluntary\nObligations,\u201d Alistair Macleod argues for the claim that there\nare moral limits on the types of voluntary actions that can give rise\nto special obligations: \u201cActions \u2026 must survive moral\nscrutiny \u2013 which means, in effect, that it must be possible to\ncharacterize them as morally permissible actions \u2013 if the duties\nthat are generated by the acts in question are to be given recognition\nas  moral duties \u201d (132; emphasis in original). Special\nmoral obligations can only arise from voluntary actions and choices\nthat are morally justifiable (135). Of course, Macleod could then take\nthe Cocking and Kennett route and still regard those voluntary actions\nwhich are not morally justified as creating reasons of some kind, or\nhe could deny that morally impermissible choices, such as, perhaps,\nbecoming friends with a Nazi, create any sort of reasons whatsoever.\nIn his discussion of \u201cReasonable Partiality Towards\nCompatriots,\u201d David Miller claims that special obligations\n\u201carise only from relationships that are intrinsically\nvaluable\u201d (65), and \u201cthe attachments that ground them\n[cannot] inherently involve injustice\u201d (66). So membership in\nthe Nazi party will not generate special obligations, because that\ngroup does \u201cinherently involve injustice.\u201d\n\nWhat is important is not whether we decide to call the demands arising\nfrom special relationships \u2018moral obligations\u2019 or\n\u2018non-moral obligations.\u2019 What matters is whether these\ndemands are actually reasons, or whether they are mere obligations of\nrole or position, where the latter are really just shorthand for\nsocial expectations or understandings. If special obligations are\ngenuine reasons, we need to decide whether they can only arise from\nrelationships or commitments that satisfy independent moral criteria,\nor whether they can arise from friendships, promises, etc., which are\nsuch that we might very well have had moral reasons not to enter or to\nmake. Even, however, friendships, for example, that were morally\nacceptable for us to enter may place demands upon us that run counter\nto impartial moral demands. After all, even good people can require\nhelp in getting themselves out of bad situations. It is always\nimportant to remember, however, that no plausible account of special\nobligations will view them as always being all-things-considered\nreasons for action. So even if special obligations can direct us to do\nthat which is wrong or bad on other grounds, it does not immediately\nfollow that we ought to act on our special obligations. It seems quite\nclear that if I learn that my dearest friend in the world is a serial\nkiller, even though I have an obligation to protect him, I also have\nvery strong reason to turn him in to the police, and that what I ought\nto do is to act on that latter reason.\n\nHowever, there will be other times such that our special obligations\nare weighty enough that we ought to do that which, in other\ncircumstances, would be immoral for us to do. But this should not be\nsurprising or troubling to us, if we accept that friendship, promises,\ncollegial relationships, etc., have moral, or at least rational,\nsignificance. Such significance inevitably changes the landscape of\nreasons.\n",
