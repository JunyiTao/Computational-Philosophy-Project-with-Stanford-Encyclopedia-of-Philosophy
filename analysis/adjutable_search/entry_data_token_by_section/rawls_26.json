Not to do so, Rawls says, would be to fail to express\nsufficient respect for acceptable ways of ordering a society. Liberal\npeoples should recognize the good of national self-determination, and\nlet decent societies decide their futures for themselves. The\ngovernment of a liberal people should not criticize decent peoples for\nfailing to be liberal, or set up incentives for them to become more\nso. Criticism and inducements may cause bitterness and resentment\nwithin decent peoples, and so be counter-productive.\n\nIndeed public reason imposes duties of civility upon the members of\ninternational society, just as it does upon members of a liberal\nsociety. Government officials and candidates for high office should\nexplain their foreign policy positions to other peoples in terms of\nthe principles and values of the law of peoples, and should avoid\nreliance on contentious parochial reasons that all peoples cannot\nreasonably share.\n\nOne major reason that liberal peoples tolerate decent peoples, Rawls\nsays, is that decent peoples secure for all persons within their\nterritory a core list of human rights. These core human rights include\nrights to subsistence, security, personal property, and formal\nequality before the law, as well as freedoms from slavery, protections\nof ethnic groups against genocide, and some measure of liberty of\nconscience (but not, as we have seen, a right to democratic\nparticipation). These core human rights are the minimal conditions\nrequired for persons to be able to engage in social cooperation in any\nreal sense, so any well-ordered society must protect them.\n\nThe role of human rights in the law of peoples is thus to set limits\non international toleration. Any society that guarantees Rawls\u2019s\nlist of human rights is to be immune from coercive intervention from\nother peoples. Societies that violate human rights overstep the limits\nof toleration, and may rightly be subject to economic sanctions or\neven military intervention.\n",
