    "main_text": "Deity, Nature, and Society || The Cosmos\n2.1 The Cosmos\n\nLike many other contemporaries he read\u2014e.g., Hutcheson, Kames,\nBolingbroke, Tracy, and Hume\u2014Jefferson was an empiricist, and in\nkeeping with Isaac Newton, a dyed-in-the-wool materialist. To John\nAdams (15 Aug. 1820), he writes, \u201cA single sense may indeed be\nsometimes\n decieved,[1]\n but rarely: and never all our senses together, with their faculty of\nreasoning.\u201d Jefferson continues: \u201c\u2018I feel: therefore\nI exist.\u2019 I feel bodies which are not myself: there are other\nexistencies then. I call them matter. I feel them changing place. This\ngives me motion. Where there is an absence of matter, I call it void,\nor nothing, or immaterial space.\u201d Given matter and motion,\neverything else, even thinking, is explicable. As all loadstones are\nmagnetic, matter too is merely \u201can action of a particular\norganization of matter, formed for that purpose by it\u2019s\ncreator.\u201d Even mind and god are material. \u201cTo talk of\nimmaterial existences is to talk of nothings.\u201d\n\nTo Massachusetts politician Edward Everett (24 Feb. 1823), Jefferson\nsays that observed particulars are found to be nothing but\nconcretizations of atoms. He cautions, \u201cBy analyzing too\nminutely we often reduce our subject to atoms, of which the mind loses\nhold.\u201d That suggests a sort of pragmatic\natomism\u2014viz., atoms being merely arbitrary\nepistemological stopping points in the analysis of matter to keep the\nmind from entertaining the dizzying thought of dividing without\nend.\n\nJefferson, however, was not a metaphysical atomist of the Epicurean\nsort, but a nominalist like philosopher John Locke (1690). To New\nJersey politician Dr. John Manners (22 Feb. 1814), he says:\n\n\nNature has, in truth, produced units only through all her works.\nClasses, orders, genera, species, are not of her works. Her creation\nis of individuals. No two animals are exactly alike; no two plants,\nnor even two leaves or blades of grass; no two crystallizations. And\nif we may venture from what is within the cognizance of such organs as\nours, to conclude on that beyond their powers, we must believe that no\ntwo particles of matter are of exact resemblance. \n\n\nHumans categorize out of need, for the \u201cinfinitude of units or\nindividuals\u201d outstrips the capacity of memory. There is grouping\nand subgrouping until there are formed classes, orders, genera, and\nspecies. Yet such grouping is man\u2019s doing, not\n nature\u2019s.[2]\n Jefferson begins with biota\u2014the system he questions is the\nSwedish botanist Carl Linnaeus\u2019\u2014and works his way down to\n\u201cparticles of matter.\u201d\n\nIn Jefferson\u2019s cosmos, which is Stoic-like in etiology, all\nevents are linked. The hand of deity is manifestly behind the\netiological arrangements. Jefferson writes to Adams (11 Apr.\n1823):\n\n\nI hold (without appeal to revelation) that when we take a view of the\nuniverse; in it\u2019s parts general or particular, it is impossible\nfor the human mind not to percieve and feel a conviction of design,\nconsummate skill, and indefinite power in every atom of it\u2019s\ncomposition. The movements of the heavenly bodies, so exactly held in\ntheir courses by the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces;\nthe structure of our earth itself, with its distribution of lands,\nwaters, and atmosphere; animal and vegetable bodies, each perfectly\norganized whether as insect, man or mammoth; it is impossible not to\nbelieve, that there is in all this, design, cause and effect, up to an\nultimate cause, a Fabricator of all things from matter and motion,\ntheir preserver and regulator while permitted to exist in their\npresent forms, and their regenerator into new and other forms.\n\n\nThe language of perception is in keeping with his empiricism; the\nlanguage of feel, with his appropriation of philosophers Destutt de\nTracy\u2019s (1818/1827: 164) and Lord Kames\u2019 (1758: 250)\nepistemology. Appeal to an ultimate cause implies a demiurge, of whose\nnature little can be known other than its superior intelligence and\noverall\n beneficence.[3]\n There is nothing here or in any other cosmological letters to suggest\nthat deity privileges human life any more than, in David Hume\u2019s\nwords, \u201cthat of an oyster\u201d (1755 [1987]: 583).\n\nJefferson continues in his 1823 letter to Adams. Deity superintends\nthe cosmos. Some stars disappear; others come to be. Comets, with\ntheir \u201cincalculable courses\u201d, deviate from regular orbits\nand demand \u201crenovation under other laws.\u201d Some species of\nanimal have become extinct. \u201cWere there no restoring power, all\nexistences might extinguish successively, one by one, until all should\nbe reduced to a shapeless chaos.\u201d\n\nWhat precisely does divine superintendence entail?\n\nWilliam Wilson argues that the \u201c\u2018cut\u2019 of\nJefferson\u2019s mind\u201d demands theism\u2014divine\ninterpositionism. He writes:\n\nCalling him a deist registers great misunderstanding of that mind. But\nthe root of his thinking remained Newtonian, including its belief in\nan omnipresent divine activity in nature. The God of deism from this\npoint of view would be a complete abstraction. As the statistician\nreduces a person of flesh and blood to a mere integer, so the deist\nreduces God to a functionary of no real description who abandons\nnature to a well-ordered dust. (Wilson 2017, 122)\n\n\nHolowchak thinks that it is unlikely that divine\nsuperintendence\u2014i.e., extinction and restoration\u2014implies\nsupernatural intervention in the natural course of events (e.g., TJ to\nFrancis Adrian Van der Kemp, 25 Sept. 1816, and TJ to Daniel Salmon,\n15 Feb. 1808). It is probable, thinks Holowchak, that a natural\ncapacity for restoration exists in certain types of matter in the same\nway that mind, for Jefferson, is in certain types of matter (2013a).\nDeity\u2019s superintendence is likely the capacity for\npre-established cosmic self-regulation comparable in some sense to the\nwork of a thermostat in regulating the temperature of a\n building.[4]\n Following Lord Bolingbroke whose views from Philosophical\nWorks he \u201ccommonplaced\u201d early in life ([LCB]:\n40\u201355), Jefferson believed that to posit that God needed to\nintervene in cosmic events to keep aright them (e.g., by sending down\nJesus to save humanity) was to belie the capacities of deity. God,\nthought Bolingbroke, and Jefferson\u2019s god owed more to\nBolingbroke than to any other thinker, got things right the first\ntime.\n",
