Incommensurability of Thought Styles and the Problem of Truth\n\nAs explained above, when people with different thought styles meet,\nthey do not fully understand each other, and at the same time one\nperson thinks that the other is a fool and heretic. Fleck, using\nexamples from the history of medicine, shows that such a lack of\nunderstanding manifests itself not only where a physicist and a\nmetaphysician or astrologer meet, but also when today\u2019s\nscientists read works of their ancestors from the distant past. (Just\nlike Kuhn Fleck does not think that the history of physics as science\nstarted with Galileo and Newton, and the history of scientific\nchemistry with Lavoisier.) For us the views of medieval scholars seem\nfantastic, unjustified, useless, so \u201cnon-scientific\u201d. But\nwhat would happen if they read our \u201cscientific\u201d\ndissertations? They would probably consider them artificial,\narbitrary, meaningless. They understood each other well and together\ndeveloped their thought styles. Just like our views allow us to deal\nwith necessities of life, \u201ctheological\u201d views allowed our\nancestors to organize life and gave them an understanding of the sense\nof life (1935a, IV.5).\n\nOn several occasions, especially in (1927) and (1939a), Fleck uses the\nterm \u201cincommensurability\u201d\n(niewsp\u00f3\u0142mierno\u015b\u0107) of concepts or\nideas. He does not develop this issue. Yet it is easy\u2014by looking\nthrough the Kuhnian glasses\u2014to extract from his writings a quite\nwell developed theory of incommensurability of thought styles. Its\ncore is constituted by the claim that in the historical development of\nscience there are no invariants.\n\n(a) The language used to describe what to members of a collective\nappears as reality changes. Some words disappear, other appear, and\neven if words remain their meanings change to a greater or lesser\nextent. Fleck quotes some fragments of writings of a physicist James\nClerk Maxwell and a philosopher Henri Bergson on motion and knowledge\non motion and he concludes that the words \u201cmotion\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge\u201d have different meanings for them: \u201cit is\nnot as if the word of one of them meant a thing that the other would\ngive a different name, but that a thing to which one of them gave a\ncertain name does not exist at all for the other one\u201d (1936,\nII). We can find similar examples in writings of\n\u201cscientists\u201d. Heat in the second half of the 18th century\nwas on the list of chemical elements, and in the 19th century it\nbecame the motion of atoms. What Lavoisier or Carnot called\n\u201cheat\u201d, for Maxwell or Boltzmann did not exist and\nvice versa. So if they could meet and talk they would not\nmake inconsistent claims about the same phenomenon, but would speak of\nsomething different. \u201cIt is not possible to express with\ntoday\u2019s words the content of a view of a distant epoch since\nparticular notions of this epoch are incommensurable with the ones of\ntoday\u201d (1939a).\n\nObviously, it is not possible to explain to somebody outside of our\nthought collective the meanings of the concepts we use through verbal\ndefinitions, for we define words by other words which she does not\nunderstand to the same degree as she does not understand the defined\nword. It is not possible to define a word ostensively, for that person\ndoes not perceive in the world those objects which we perceive as\nbelonging to the scope of the term defined. The only thing we can do\nis to teach her the basis of our thought style, like we teach our\nchildren and the young. The first step sometimes consists in creating\na platform of partial understanding with a member of other collective\nfor the price of impoverishing content and some deformations. But this\nis not argumentation but propaganda (1936, III).\n\n(b) After passing from one thought style to another within \u201cthe\nsame\u201d scientific discipline, research problems change. Losses\nappear along with benefits. For example, when the contemporary concept\nof syphilis was created one learned very much, but many details of\nearlier theories were also lost. Earlier researchers did not know many\nof the details that we know, but knew more about what according to\nthem had a greater value. Later researchers see many problems which\ntheir predecessors treated as unimportant or senseless. \u201cThis\ncreates specialized valuation and characteristic intolerance, which\nare features shared by all exclusive communities\u201d (1935a, IV.3).\nThis valuation becomes stronger, for after passing from one thought\nstyle to another the research methods and standards for evaluating\nresearch results change to a greater or lesser extent.\n\n(c) Previous researchers\u2014looking from the same point to the same\ndirection\u2014did not see what we see, but they saw something we are\nnot able to see. Those people thought and saw differently than we do\n(1935a, IV.5). Their physical reality does not exist for us, and our\nphysical reality did not exist for them.\n\nThis all leads to an extremely anti-realistic standpoint. The thought\nstyle creates reality. Nowadays science is not closer to any objective\npicture of the world than the science of 100 years ago (1946). The\nonly difference is that there are now many more scientists than ever\nand as a result our picture of the world is richer in details than any\nprior picture. However, the fact that a certain view seems for us to\nbe true is only a sign of our education and not that of the\ncorrespondence to \u201can independently existing reality\u201d\n(1938). What members of a collective call truth, from the point of\nview of sociology of cognition is the up-to-date stage of changes of\nthought-style (1936, VI) or stylized thought constraint (1935a,\nIV.3).\n\nSince in the historical development of science there is no constant,\nunchanging part, since scientific knowledge changes continuously as a\nwhole, then science does not contain any objective picture of the\nworld, and it does not even contain any part of such a picture (1946).\nYet contrary to Kuhn, Fleck does not avoid using the term\n\u201ctruth\u201d in reference to scientific statements. And he\nemphasizes that truth is neither subjective nor relative:\n\nIt is always, or almost always, completely determined within a thought\nstyle. One can never say that the same thought is true for A and false\nfor B. If A and B belong to the same thought collective, the thought\nwill be either true or false for both. But if they belong to different\nthought collectives, it will just not be the same thought (1935a,\nIV.3).\n\n",
