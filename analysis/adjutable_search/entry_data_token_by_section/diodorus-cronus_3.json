    "main_text": "Philosophical position\n4. Philosophical position\n\n\nDiodorus was known as a great dialectician. Zeno of Elea had been\ncalled by Aristotle (in a lost work) the founder of dialectic, and the\nmotion paradoxes make it clear that Diodorus modelled himself to a\nconsiderable extent on Zeno.\n\n\nOn the other hand Diodorus\u2019s Dialectical school was Socratic in its\naffiliation (see the entry on\n Dialectical School \nin this encyclopedia, section 1). As mentioned above, it was a branch or\noffshoot of the Megaric school, founded by Euclides of Megara and\nrecognized as one of the minor \u2018Socratic\u2019 schools, thanks\nto Euclides\u2019s close association with Socrates.\n\n\nThe latter, Socratic link can be developed further. The Dialectical\nschool is listed by Diogenes Laertius (1.18) as one of the\n\u2018ethical\u2019 sects\u2014surprisingly, given that no ethical\ndoctrines or interests are recorded for any of its known members. The\nexplanation may lie in a well-known passage in Plato\u2019s\nApology (38a), where Socrates remarks that \u2018The greatest\ngood for man is to hold discussions every day about virtue and about\nthe other things about which you hear me conversing\n[dialegomenou, cognate with \u2018dialectic\u2019] and\nexamining myself and others. And the unexamined life is not worth\nliving for man\u2026\u2019 The Dialecticians may have concluded,\nfollowing Socrates, that the development and exercise of dialectical\nskills are themselves the supreme fulfilment of the human self. If so,\nit becomes that much easier to accept that Diodorus and his colleagues\ngave their philosophy a Socratic pedigree.\n\n\nHowever, there need be no tension between the Zenonian and the\nSocratic roots of Diodorus\u2019s philosophy. Indeed, in Plato\u2019s\nParmenides (135c\u2013d) a very young and still developing Socrates\nis advised by Parmenides to exercise his dialectical skills according\nto the model set by Zeno\u2014a method which, perhaps significantly\nfor Diodorus, involves systematically examining the consequences of a\n\u2018hypothesis\u2019.\n\n\nTo synthesize the methodologies of Zeno and Socrates may have seemed\nto Diodorus the ideal way to be a dialectician, and to achieve the\nhuman good.\n",
