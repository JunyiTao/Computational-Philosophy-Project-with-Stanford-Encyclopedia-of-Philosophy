    "main_text": "Clarifications || Meaning\n1.2 Meaning\n\nThe principle of compositionality is not committed to a specific\nconception of meaning. In fact, it is frequently announced as a\nprinciple that is applicable to whatever a semantic theory might\nassign to expressions of a language. Furthermore, although the\nreference of an arbitrary expression is definitely not\nsomething one would normally call its \u2018meaning\u2019, versions\nof the following principle are frequently called \u2018the\nprinciple of compositionality\u2019:\n\n(C\\(_{\\textit{ref}}\\))\nFor every complex expression e in L, the reference\nof e in L is determined by the structure of e\nin L and the references of the constituents of e in\nL.\n\n\n(I use the word \u2018reference\u2019 here roughly the way Frege\nused \u2018Bedeutung\u2019 after 1892. But it could also be\ntaken the way Lewis uses \u2018extension\u2019. The differences are\nsignificant, but they do not matter for present purposes.) To avoid\nconfusion, we should call this the principle of compositionality\nof reference, and\n (C)\n the principle of compositionality of meaning; when I speak\nof compositionality unqualified, what is meant is always the\nlatter. Since the arguments in favor of compositionality tend\nto be based on general considerations about linguistic\nunderstanding\u2014which, I shall suppose amounts to nothing more or\nless than understanding what linguistic expressions\n mean[4]\u2014proponents\n of (C\\(_{\\textit{ref}}\\)) have a choice to make. They can advocate\n(C\\(_{\\textit{ref}}\\)) on different grounds or they can claim that an\nappropriate theory of the sort that assigns (relative to a variety of\ncontextually determined\n factors[5])\n references to expressions can serve as a theory of meaning.\n\nFormalizations of\n (C)\n typically make no assumptions about what meanings are. This way we\nachieve generality and stay clear of dogmatic pronouncements. Still,\nit is a mistake to abandon all constraints for that turns\ncompositionality into a vacuous requirement. It is trivial that we can\ncompositionally assign something to each expression of a\nlanguage (for example, if expressions serve as their own meanings,\nsemantics is certainly compositional!) but it does not follow that it\nis trivial to adequately assign meanings to\nthem.\n\nThe point applies to more subtle attempts to trivialize\ncompositionality as well. Consider a famous result due to Zadrozny\n(1994). Given a set S of strings generated from an arbitrary\nalphabet via concatenation and a meaning function m which\nassigns the members of an arbitrary set M to the members of\nS, we can construct a new meaning function \\(\\mu\\) such that\nfor all \\(s, t \\in S \\mu(s{.}t) = \\mu(s)(\\mu(t))\\) and \\(\\mu(s)(s) =\nm(s)\\). What this shows is that we can turn an arbitrary meaning\nfunction into a compositional\n one,[6]\n as long as we replace the old meanings with new \u201cmeanings\u201d from which they\nare uniformly\n recoverable.[7]\nWhat is not clear is whether these new \u201cmeanings\u201d really are meanings. After all, someone ignorant of m could assign entities to members of S following \\(\\mu\\). Such a person would know what each expression in S \u201cmeans\u201d but would not necessarily know what any of them means. (For further discussion\nof Zadrozny\u2019s result, see Kazmi and Pelletier (1998),\nWesterst\u00e5hl (1998), Dever (1999).)\n\nCompositionality obviously constrains what meanings might be. But the\nconstraints apply only to the meanings of complex\nexpressions\u2014for all\n (C)\n tells us the meanings of simple expressions could be tables and\nchairs. For let the meanings of complex expressions be interpreted\nlogical forms, i.e., phrase structure trees with the meanings of the\nconstituent lexical items assigned to their terminal nodes. In a\nfairly straightforward sense the meanings of lexical items are then\nparts of the meanings of complex expressions in which they occur, and\nso the meanings of complexes are determined from the relevant tables\nand chairs together with their syntactic mode of composition; for\nsimilar remarks see Horwich (1997).\n\nThat compositionality does not constrain lexical meaning might appear\nparadoxical at first, but the source of paradox is just instability in\nhow the label \u2018compositionality\u2019 is used. Sometimes\ncompositionality is said to be that feature in a language (or\nnon-linguistic representational system) which best explains the\nproductivity and systematicity of our understanding; cf. Fodor 2001:\n6.\n (C)\n is but one of the features such explanations use\u2014others include\nthe context-invariance of most lexical meaning, the finiteness of the\nlexicon, the relative simplicity of syntax, and probably much else.\nThese features together put significant constraints on what\nlexical meanings might be; cf. the papers collected in Fodor and\nLepore (2002) and Szab\u00f3 (2004).\n",
