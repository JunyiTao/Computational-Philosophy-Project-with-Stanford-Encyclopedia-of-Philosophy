    "main_text": "Strategies for Determining Narrow Content || Diagonalization Strategy\n5.1 Diagonalization Strategy\n\nA first strategy fits neatly with the view of narrow content as a\ndiagonal proposition. If we want to know the narrow content of a\nparticular mental state, we simply construct the diagonal proposition.\nThat is, we first envision a variety of situations or environments in\nwhich the mental state could be embedded, i.e. a set of contexts or\ncentered worlds that contain, at the center, the very mental state\nwhose content we are interested in. For each of these contexts, we use\nour knowledge of broad content and how it is determined to discover\nthe broad content that the mental state would have in that context.\nAnd then we determine whether, in the world of that context, a belief\nwith that broad content would be true.\n\nThere are three main problems with this strategy. First, it treats\nbroad content as fundamental, and narrow content as derivative.\nHowever, for many advocates of narrow content (e.g. Chalmers 2002),\nnarrow content is at least as fundamental as broad content. In fact,\nit is tempting to regard broad content as determined by narrow content\nin conjunction with facts about context. But the strategy we are\nconsidering can only be applied to determine narrow content if we\nalready have an independent way of determining broad content.\n\nA second problem for the diagonalization strategy is a problem of\nscope (Chalmers, 2002). Although the diagonalization strategy yields a\ntruth-conditional notion of content, the only centered worlds at which\nthe diagonal proposition is evaluated will be worlds that contain at\ntheir center the mental state we are interested in. In effect this\nmeans that every mental state represents itself as existing. But it is\npuzzling why I could not have mental states whose content has nothing\nto do with their own existence. Chalmers offers these examples\n(Chalmers 2002, p. 625): it seems that my thought that I am a\nphilosopher should be true in worlds centered on a philosopher even if\nhe is not currently thinking that he is a philosopher. Again, it seems\nthat the thought that someone is thinking should be false, not\nundefined, at centered worlds that do not contain a thinking\nperson.\n\nThird, there is the problem of what to \u201chold constant\u201d in\ndetermining which possible contexts to consider (Block and Stalnaker\n1999). The strategy requires us to consider contexts that include the\nmental state whose content we are interested in. But exactly what\ncounts as a context that includes a particular mental state? And how\nclosely, and in which respects, must the version of the state in the\nother worlds resemble the version in the actual world?\n\nBlock and Stalnaker argue in some detail that the likely candidates\nfor what to hold constant all give the wrong results. Consider how we\nmight find the diagonal proposition associated with Oscar\u2019s\nbelief that water is wet. Suppose that a belief is, or is associated\nwith, a mental analog of a sentence. We will suppose that, like a\nsentence, a mental token can be identified separately from its\nmeaning. Then Oscar\u2019s mental token, like the sentence\n\u201cWater is wet,\u201d could, in some possible mental language,\nmean that dogs have fur. Now if in diagonalizing we consider all\npossible worlds centered on someone who possesses the same mental\nsentence as Oscar\u2019s water-sentence, regardless of its meaning,\nwe get a diagonal proposition that is much too unconstrained to serve\nas a narrow content. We surely do not want to say that the narrow\ncontent of Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet has the value True\nin a world that contains no remotely watery substance, but in which\ndogs are furry and the mental token in question means that dogs are\nfurry.\n\nSo it is not sufficient to hold a syntactically identified mental\ntoken constant in deciding which worlds to include in the diagonal\nproposition. We must somehow consider worlds in which the token\ncarries the same meaning it carries in the actual world. However, if\nwe consider only worlds in which the token has the broad\nmeaning that water is wet, the diagonal proposition will be too\nconstrained to play the role of narrow content: it will be false, not\ntrue, in a world centered on Twin Oscar.\n\nStill another possibility is to hold constant, not the broad content\nof the mental token, but its narrow content. This will give the\nresults we want, but at the cost of making the account completely\ncircular; diagonalizing cannot be a useful strategy for discovering\nnarrow contents if we must already know the narrow content of a mental\ntoken in order to apply the strategy.\n",
