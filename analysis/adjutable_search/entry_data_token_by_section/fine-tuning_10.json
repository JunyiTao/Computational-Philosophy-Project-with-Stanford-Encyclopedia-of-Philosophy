    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Design || Can We Expect a Designer to Design?\n3.4 Can We Expect a Designer to Design?\n\nThe likelihood inequality \\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\) on which the\nfine-tuning argument for design rests is based on the assumption that,\nreasonably, \\(P(R\\mid \\neg D)\\) is very small because life-friendly\nconditions are improbable if there is no designer. This assumption can\nbe challenged, as already discussed in\n 2.1.\n But the likelihood inequality \\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\) also rests on\nthe assumption that \\(P(R\\mid D)\\) is comparatively large, i.e., on\nthe view that, if there is indeed a designer, life-friendly conditions\nare more to be expected than if there is no designer. This assumption\ncan be challenged as well.\n\nReasonable assignments of \\(P(R\\mid D)\\) depend on how exactly the\ndesigner hypothesis \\(D\\) is spelled out. According to Swinburne, the\nmost promising candidate designer is \u201cthe God of traditional\ntheism\u201d whom he characterizes as \u201ca being essentially\neternal, omnipotent (in the sense that He can do anything logically\npossible), omniscient, perfectly free, and perfectly good\u201d\n(2003: 107). Swinburne argues that we can be at least moderately\nconfident that the God of traditional theism, if he exists,\n\u201cwill bring about an orderly, spatially extended, world in which\nhumans have a location\u201d (2003: 113; note that Swinburne operates\nwith a generalized, non-biological concept of \u201chumans\u201d).\nHence, according to Swinburne, life-friendly conditions, conditional\non the existence of the God of traditional theism, do not have very\nlow probability, i.e. \\(P(R\\mid D)\\), plausibly, is not many orders of\nmagnitude smaller than \\(1\\). According to Rota (2016: 119f.), even if\nwe assign to \\(P(R\\mid D)\\) a value as low as \\(1\\) in a billion, this\nsuffices for the fine-tuning argument for a divine designer to be\nstrong, simply because, in view of the fine-tuning considerations,\nlife-friendly conditions in the absence of a designer are so utterly\nunexpected. A similar point is made by Hawthorne and Isaacs\n(2018).\n\nCriticisms of the view that life-friendly constants are to be expected\nif there is a designer have a long tradition and go back to John Venn\n(1866) and John Maynard Keynes (1921). More recently, Sober has voiced\ngeneral reservations about our abilities to competently judge what a\ndivine designer, if real, would do:\n\n\nOur judgements about what counts as a sign of intelligent design must\nbe based on empirical information about what designers often do and\nwhat they rarely do. As of now, these judgements are based on our\nknowledge of human intelligence. The more our hypotheses of\nintelligent designers depart from the human case, the more in the dark\nwe are as to what the ground rules are for inferring intelligent\ndesign. (Sober 2003: 38)\n\n\nIn a similar spirit, Narveson complains that we are in no position to\npredict how a cosmic designer would behave because \u201c[b]odiless\nminded super-creators are a category that is way, way out of\ncontrol\u201d (Narveson 2003: 99). According to Sober and Narveson it\nis particularly problematic for theists to confidently assume that\nGod, if she/he exists, would create life-friendly conditions and, at\nthe same time, react to the problem of evil by highlighting our\ninability to understand \u201cthe mysterious ways of the Deity\u201d\n(Narveson 2003: 99). Manson (2020) provides an updated defense of the\nposition of Sober and Narveson against the arguments of Rota (2016) as\nwell as Hawthorne and Isaacs (2018).\n\nOne can construct versions of the designer hypothesis \\(D\\) that are\ntailored to fulfil the likelihood inequality \\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\)\nby defining the designer as a being with both the intention\nand ability to create life-friendly conditions. However, one may\nquestion whether such tailored versions of the designer hypothesis\nhave sufficient independent motivation and plausibility to deserve\nserious consideration in the first place. To use Bayesian terms, one\nmay hesitate to ascribe them non-negligible prior probabilities\n\\(P(D)\\).\n\nMotivating a non-negligible prior \\(P(D)\\) for design is especially\nchallenging in the framework of the ur-probability solution to the\nproblem of old evidence because it constrains the background evidence\nto facts that do not entail the existence of life. Collins argues that\nif we focus only on a limited class of constants \\(C\\), the background\nevidence that we can use to motivate the prior \\(P(D)\\) is allowed to\n\u201cinclud[e] the initial conditions of the universe, the laws of\nphysics, and the values of all the other constants except C\u201d.\nBut appeals to the sacred texts of religions cannot be used to\nmotivate the ascription of a non-negligible ur-prior \\(P(D)\\) because\nthey presuppose, and thus entail, the existence of life. Notably, as\npointed out by Monton, \u201c[i]n formulating an urprobability for\nthe existence of God, one cannot take into account Biblical accounts\nabout Jesus\u201d (2006: 418). According to Monton (2006: 419),\nproponents of the argument from fine-tuning for design may, however,\ntry to motivate a non-negligible ur-prior \\(P(D)\\) by resorting to\narguments for the existence of God that are either a priori, e.g.,\nontological argument, or appeal only to very general empirical facts\nthat do not entail that the conditions are right for life, e.g., the\ncosmological argument. According to Swinburne (2004: ch. 5), the\nhypothesis of traditional theism is a simple one and, as such,\nwarrants the ascription of a non-negligible prior.\n",
