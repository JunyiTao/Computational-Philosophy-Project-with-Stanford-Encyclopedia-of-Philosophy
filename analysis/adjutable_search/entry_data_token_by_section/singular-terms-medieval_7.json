    "main_text": "Singular Terms in Theology\n8. Singular Terms in Theology \n\n\nProblems of naming often arose in theological contexts, and Aquinas\u2019s\nown list of reasons for giving proper names is part of his discussion\nof whether Christ was appropriately named \u2018Jesus\u2019.  The\nword \u2018God\u2019 was the focus of particular\nattention. Praepositinus of Cremona said that properly speaking it was\nneither a proper name nor a common term, while other early theologians\napparently suggested that it was a proper name, because it referred to\na reality that could only be singular. The majority view was expressed\nby Aquinas, who argued that the word \u2018God\u2019 was much like\nthe word \u2018sun\u2019. We know that this word has only one\nreferent, and in the case of God, we know that the word can\nhave only one referent; nonetheless, \u2018God\u2019 is a common\nterm. In many later logicians \u2018God\u2019 appears along with\n\u2018sun\u2019 and \u2018moon\u2019 as an example of words that\nare not singular terms, despite the fact that they supposit for only\none thing.\n\n\nThe Trinity caused particular problems for logicians because of the\nunique relation between the three persons and the one divine essence\nwhich is, as Ockham put it in his Summa logicae, \u201cone and\nsimple and one in number and singular to the highest degree, and yet\nis several things.\u201d Such inferences as \u201cThis divine\nessence is the Father, this divine essence is the Son, therefore the\nFather is the Son\u201d seem to have true premises which assert an\nidentity between singular things, yet the conclusion is\nunacceptable. Various solutions were found, including an exploration\nof different senses of identity and of different types of\npredication. In his Perutilis logica Albert of Saxony\nsuggested that in expository syllogisms the middle term should always\nbe qualified by the phrase, \u201cEverything which is,\u201d which\nmakes the premises false in the divine case. In the Summa\nlogicae, Ockham preferred to say that a singular proposition of\nthe sort required for expository syllogisms could not have a subject\nwhich supposited for a reality that was both one and many, as occurs\nin the Trinitarian example.\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic doctrine of transsubstantiation led to a discussion\nof demonstrative phrases. When during the Eucharist the priest takes\nthe bread and utters the words \u201cThis is my body,\u201d the\nsubstance is said to change from bread into the body of Christ. What\nthen is the referent of the word \u2018this\u2019? It cannot be the\nbread, for that would falsify the sentence, but it cannot be the body\nof Christ, for the change of substance only occurs when the utterance\nis complete. In their solutions, theologians discussed a wide range of\ntopics, including the relation between the use and mention of a\nproposition, the relation of a proposition to the stretch of time\nduring which it is uttered, and the difference between factual and\nperformative utterances, but what concerns us here is their treatment\nof the word \u2018this\u2019. Priscian\u2019s reference to intellectual\ndemonstration was found useful, and the thought that a demonstrative\ncould refer either to something absent or to something spiritual was\nsupplemented by a further kind of intellectual demonstration in which\nthe thing actually pointed to is not numerically identical to the\nthing signified and to which the predicate applies. \u201cThis herb\ngrows in my garden,\u201d said while in someone else\u2019s garden, was\nthe standard example here. Aquinas seized on Priscian\u2019s further claim\nthat demonstratives signify substance without quality, and argued that\n\u2018this\u2019 refers to something indeterminate which is first\nqualified by the properties of bread and then by the properties of\nChrist\u2019s body. \n",
