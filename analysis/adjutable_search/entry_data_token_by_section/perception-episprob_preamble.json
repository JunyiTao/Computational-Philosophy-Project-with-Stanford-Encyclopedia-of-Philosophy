    "main_text": "\n\nThe central problem in the epistemology of perception is that of\nexplaining how perception could give us knowledge or justified belief\nabout an external world, about things outside of ourselves. This\nproblem has traditionally been viewed in terms of a skeptical argument\nthat purports to show that such knowledge and justification are\nimpossible. Skepticism about the external world highlights a number of\nepistemological difficulties regarding the nature and epistemic role\nof experience and the question of how perception might bring us into\ncontact with a mind-independent reality. The issues that arise are of\ncentral importance for understanding knowledge and justification more\ngenerally, even aside from their connection to skepticism.\n\nTwo main types of response to the skeptical argument have\ntraditionally been given: a metaphysical response that focuses on the\nnature of the world, perceptual experience, and/or the relation\nbetween them, in an effort to show that perceptual knowledge is indeed\npossible; and a more directly epistemological response that focuses on\nprinciples specifying what is required for knowledge and/or\njustification, in an effort to show that skepticism misstates the\nrequirements for knowledge.\n\nMuch of the philosophical tradition has viewed the central\nepistemological problems concerning perception largely and sometimes\nexclusively in terms of the metaphysical responses to skepticism. For\nthat reason, these will be addressed before moving on to the more\nexplicitly epistemological concerns.\n",
