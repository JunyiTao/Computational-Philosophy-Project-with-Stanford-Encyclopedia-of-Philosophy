    "main_text": "Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century || Progress in Organic Chemistry Using Chemical Formulae\n4.3 Progress in Organic Chemistry Using Chemical Formulae\n\n\nThe period from the third to the sixth decades of the nineteenth\ncentury witnessed spectacular advances in the area of organic\nchemistry and it is uncontroversial to observe that these advances\nwere facilitated by the use of chemical formulae. Inorganic chemistry\ndiffers from organic chemistry insofar as the former involves simple\narrangements of a large number of elements whereas organic chemistry\ninvolves complicated arrangements of just a few elements, mainly\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen and to a lesser extent, nitrogen.\n\n\nIt was soon to become apparent that the specification of the\nproportions of the elements in an organic compound was not sufficient\nto identify it or to give an adequate reflection of its properties.\nProgress became possible when the arrangements of the symbols\nrepresenting the elements in formulae were deployed to reflect\nchemical properties. The historical details of the various ways in\nwhich chemical properties were represented by arrangements of symbols\nare complex. (For details see Rocke (1984) and Klein (2003)). Here we\nabstract from those details to illustrate the kinds of moves that were\nmade.\n\n\nThe simplest formula representing the composition of acetic acid is\nCH2O using modern atomic weights. This formula cannot\naccommodate the fact that, in the laboratory, the hydrogen in acetic\nacid can be replaced by chlorine in four distinct ways yielding four\ndistinct chemical compounds. Three of those compounds are acids that\nhave properties very similar to acetic acid, and in which the relative\nweights of chlorine vary as 1:2:3. The fourth compound has the\nproperties of a salt rather than an acid. These experimental facts can\nbe captured in a formula by doubling the numbers and rearranging the\nsymbols, so that we have C2H4O2,\nrearranged to read C2H3O2H. The\nexperimental facts can now readily be understood in terms of the\nsubstitution of one or more of the hydrogens by chlorine, with the\nthree chloro-acetic acids represented as\nC2H2ClO2,\nC2HCl2O2H and\nC2Cl3O2H and the salt, acetyl\nchloride, as C2H3O2Cl. Such formulae\ncame to be known as \u2018rational formulae\u2019 as distinct from\nthe \u2018empirical formula\u2019 CH2O. Representing the\nreplacement of one element in a compound by another in the laboratory\nby the replacement of one symbol by another in a chemical formula\nbecame a standard and productive device that was to eventually yield\nthe concept of valency in the 1860s. (Oxygen has a valency of two\nbecause two hydrogens need to be substituted for each oxygen.)\n\n\nOther devices employed to fashion rational formulae involved the\nnotion of a radical, a grouping of elements that persisted through a\nrange of chemical changes so that they play a role in organic\nchemistry akin to that of elements in inorganic chemistry. Series of\ncompounds could be understood in terms of additions, for example to\nthe methyl radical, CH3, or to the ethyl radical,\nC2H5, and so on. \u2018Homologous series\u2019\nof compounds could be formed by repeatedly adding CH2 to\nthe formulae for such radicals so that the properties, and indeed the\nexistence, of complex compounds could be predicted by analogy with\nsimpler ones. Another productive move involved the increasing\nrecognition that the action of acids needed to be understood in terms\nof the replacement of hydrogen. Polybasic acids were recognised as\nproducing two or more series of salts depending on whether one, two or\nmore hydrogens are replaced. Yet another important move involved the\ndemand that rational formulae capture certain asymmetric compounds,\nsuch as methyl ethyl ether, CH3C2H5O,\nas distinct from methyl ether, (CH3)2O, and\nethyl ether, (C2H5)2O. By 1860, the\nidea of tetravalent carbon atoms that could combine together in chains\nwas added. By that stage, the demand that rational formulae reflect a\nwide range of chemical properties had resulted in a set of formulae\nthat was more or less unique. The under-determination problem that had\nblocked the way to the establishment of unique formulae and atomic\nweights had been solved by chemical means.\n",
