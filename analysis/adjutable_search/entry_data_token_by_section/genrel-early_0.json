    "main_text": "The Search for Philosophical Novelty\n1. The Search for Philosophical Novelty\n\nExtraordinary public clamor greeted an announcement of the joint\nmeeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical\nSociety on the sixth of November 1919. Astronomical observations made\nby a British team during the solar eclipse on May 29 comprised the\nfirst empirical test of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\nLengthy data analysis of the observations over the summer had shown\nthat within acceptable margin of error, light from distant stars\npassing near the solar surface was displaced by the tiny amount (1.75\narcseconds, corresponding to the angle of a right triangle of height 1\ninch and base nearly 2 miles in length) predicted by Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory of curved spacetime. By dint of having\n\u201coverthrown\u201d such a permanent fixture of the cognitive\nlandscape as Newtonian gravitational theory, the general theory of\nrelativity at once became a principal focus of philosophical interest\nand inquiry. Although some physicists and philosophers initially\nopposed it, mostly on non-physical grounds, surveyed here are the\nprincipal philosophical interpretations of those accepting the theory\nas a revolutionary advance in physical knowledge. Even so, these\ninclude positions ill-informed as to the mathematics and physics of\nthe theory. Further lack of clarity stemmed from the scientific\nliterati who provided differing, and at times, conflicting\nmathematical or physical accounts of the theory\u2019s fundamental\nprinciples. These are (see below): the principles of equivalence and\nof what Einstein misleadingly termed \u201cgeneral relativity\u201d\n(i.e., general covariance), and finally one he baptized as\nMach\u2019s Principle, of the complete relativization of\ninertia. In one or another form, these controversies have largely\ncontinued into the present literature of physics and philosophy of\nphysics (see, e.g., Stachel 1980; Friedman 1983; Norton 1993; Barbour\n& Pfister 1995; Ohanian 2008; Janssen 2014; Ryckman 2017). This is\nnot unusual: physical theories, if sufficiently robust, are rarely, if\never, without ambiguous or problematic aspects, and are often taken to\nsay different things at different stages of development. But the very\nfluidity of physical and mathematical meaning lent interpretative\nlatitude for inherently antagonistic philosophical viewpoints seeking\nvindication, confirmation or illumination by the revolutionary new\ntheory. Perhaps only semi-facetiously, Bertrand Russell observed\nthat\n\n\nThere has been a tendency, not uncommon in the case of a new\nscientific theory, for every philosopher to interpret the work of\nEinstein in accordance with his own metaphysical system, and to\nsuggest that the outcome is a great accession of strength to the views\nwhich the philosopher in question previously held. This cannot be true\nin all cases; and it may be hoped that it is true in none. It would be\ndisappointing if so fundamental a change as Einstein has introduced\ninvolved no philosophical novelty. (1926: 331)\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that general relativity proved a considerable\nstimulus to philosophical novelty. But then the question whether it\nparticularly supported any one line of philosophical interpretation\nover another must take into account the fact that schools of\ninterpretation in turn evolved to accommodate what were regarded as\ngeneral relativity\u2019s philosophically salient features. A classic\ninstance is the assertion, to become a cornerstone of logical\nempiricism, that relativity theory had shown the untenability of any\n\u201cphilosophy of the synthetic a priori\u201d, despite\nthe fact that early works on relativity theory by both Hans\nReichenbach and Rudolf Carnap were written from within that broad\nperspective. It will be seen that, however ideologically useful, the\nclaim by no means follows from relativity theory although, as\nphysicist Max von Laue noted in his early text on general relativity\n(1921: 42), \u201cnot every sentence of The Critique of Pure\nReason\u201d might still be held intact. What does follow from\nscrutiny of the various philosophical appropriations of general\nrelativity is a consummate illustration that, due to the evolution and\nmutual interplay of physical, mathematical and philosophical\nunderstandings of a revolutionary physical theory, philosophical\ninterpretations often are works in progress, extending over many\nyears.\n",
