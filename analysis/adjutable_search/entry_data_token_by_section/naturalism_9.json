    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || The Canberra Plan\n2.2 The Canberra Plan\nOne influential strand in contemporary philosophy is quite explicit in claiming that analytic intuitions play a central role in philosophy. Inspired by David Lewis, and led by Frank Jackson and David Chalmers, this is widely known as the \u201cCanberra Plan\u201d. On this conception, philosophy starts with an initial analysis\nof concepts employed by everyday thought, such as free will,\nsay, or knowledge, or moral value, or conscious\nexperience. Once this stage has been completed, philosophy\ncan then turn to \u201cserious metaphysics\u201d to demonstrate how\na limited number of ingredients (for example, physical ingredients)\nmight satisfy these everyday concepts. This second stage is likely to\nappeal to synthetic a posteriori scientific knowledge about\nthe fundamental nature of reality. But the purely analytic first\nstage, according to the Canberra plan, also plays an essential part in setting the\nagenda for the subsequent metaphysical investigation.(Jackson 1998, Braddon-Mitchell and Nola 2009, Chalmers 2012.)\nAn initial question about this programme relates to its scope. It\nis by no means clear that all, or indeed any, philosophically\ninteresting concepts can be subject to the relevant kind of\nanalysis. Jackson himself assumes that pretty much all everyday\nconcepts can be analysed as equivalent to \u201cthe kind which\nsatisfies such-and-such folk\nassumptions\u201d.[11] \nBut it is arguable that many everyday\nconcepts are not so constituted, but rather have their semantic\ncontents fixed by observational, causal or historical relations to\ntheir referents.\nStill, we can let this point pass. Even if we suppose, for the sake\nof the argument, that a range of philosophically interesting everyday\nconcepts do have their contents fixed in the way the Canberra\nprogramme supposes, there are further objections to its understanding\nof philosophical method.\nLet us look a bit more closely at the posited initial\nagenda-setting stage of the Canberra programme. Upon closer\nexamination, it is not clear that this makes any essential appeal to\nanalytic knowledge.  Defenders of the Canberra plan\ncharacteristically explain their strategy in terms of \u201cRamsey\nsentences\u201d (e.g., Jackson 1998: 140). Suppose \\(T(F)\\) is the\nset of relevant everyday assumptions involving some philosophically\ninteresting concept. For example, F may be the concept\nbelief, and the assumptions in T may include\n\u201ccharacteristically caused by perceptions\u201d,\n\u201ccombines with desires to generate actions\u201d, and\n\u201chas causally significant internal structure\u201d. Then the\nRamsey sentence corresponding to \\(T(F)\\) is \u201c\\(\\exists!\\Phi\n(T(\\Phi))\\)\u201d.[12] \nFor the concept belief, this would say: there is some unique kind that is characteristically caused by perceptions, combines with desires to generate actions, and has causally significant internal structure.\n The Canberra suggestion is then that, once we\nhave articulated the relevant Ramsey sentence, we will be in a\nposition to turn to serious metaphysics to identify the underlying\nnature of the F that plays the relevant role.\nHowever, if this is the Canberra procedure, then there is no reason\nto think of it as appealing to analytic knowledge at any stage. A\nRamsey sentence of the kind at issue says that there actually exists\nsome entity satisfying certain requirements (there is a kind of state\nthat is caused by perceptions \u2026). Sentences like this make\neminently synthetic and falsifiable claims. It is not a matter of\ndefinition that humans actually have internal states that play the\ncausal role associated with the concept of belief. The Canberra\nstrategy thus seems no different from the prescription that philosophy\nshould start with the synthetic theories endorsed by everyday thought,\nand then look to our more fundamental theories of reality to see what,\nif anything, makes these everyday theories true. This seems entirely\nin accord with methodological naturalism\u2014philosophy is in the\nbusiness of assessing and developing synthetic theories of the\nworld.\nThe crucial point here is that Ramsey sentences don\u2019t define\nconcepts like belief, but eliminate them. They give us a way of saying\nwhat our everyday theories say without using the relevant concept\n(there is a kind of state that is caused by perceptions \u2026) If\nwe want definitions, then we need \u201cCarnap sentences\u201d, not\nRamsey sentences (Lewis 1970). The Carnap sentence corresponding to\n\u201c\\(\\exists!\\Phi(T(\\Phi))\\)\u201d is \u201cIf\n\\(\\exists!\\Phi(T(\\Phi)\\), then \\(T(F)\\)\u201d.  (If there is\na kind of state that is caused by perceptions \u2026, then\nit\u2019s belief.) Carnap sentences can plausibly be viewed as akin\nto stipulations that fix the reference of the relevant concepts, and\nto that extent as analytic claims that can be known a\npriori. But this certainly does not mean that Ramsey sentences,\nwhich make substantial claims about the actual world, are also\nknowable via a priori analysis. (Note how you can accept a\nconditional Carnap sentence even if you reject the corresponding\nunconditional Ramsey sentence. You can grasp the folk concept of\nbelief even if you reject the substantial folk theory of belief.)\nCan\u2019t defenders of the Canberra programme argue that it is\nthe analytic Carnap sentences that are crucial in setting\nphilosophical agendas, not the synthetic Ramsey sentences? But this\nseems wrong. We will want to know about the fundamental nature of\nbelief if we suppose that there is a kind of state that is\ncharacteristically caused by perceptions, and so on. That is certainly\na good motivation for figuring out whether and how the fundamental\ncomponents of reality might constitute this state. But the mere fact\nthat everyday thought contains a concept of such a state in itself\nprovides no motivation for further investigation. (In effect, the\nfunction of a Carnap sentence is to provide a shorthand for talking\nabout the putative state posited by the corresponding Ramsey\nsentence. It is hard to see how any important philosophical issues\ncould hang on the availability of such a shorthand.)\nTo emphasize the point, consider the everyday concept of a soul,\nunderstood as something that is present in conscious beings and survives\ndeath. This concept of a soul can be captured by the analytic Carnap\nsentence: \u201cIf certain entities inhabit conscious beings and\nsurvive death, then they are souls\u201d. Accordingly, this Carnap\nsentence will be agreed by everybody who has the concept of soul,\nwhether or not they believe in souls. Yet this Carnap sentence will\nnot per se raise any interesting metaphysical questions for\nthose who deny the existence of souls. These deniers won\u2019t start\nwondering how the fundamental constituents of reality realize\nsouls\u2014after all, they don\u2019t believe in souls. It is only\nthose who accept the corresponding Ramsey sentence (\u201cThere are\nparts of conscious beings that survive death\u201d) who will see a\nmetaphysical issue here. Moreover, the Ramsey sentence will pose this\nmetaphysical issue whether or not it is accompanied by some analytic\nCarnap sentence to provide some shorthand alternative terminology. In\nshort, the methodological naturalist can insist that anybody\ninterested in \u201cserious metaphysics\u201d should start by\narticulating the substantial existential commitments of our folk\ntheories, as articulated in their synthetic Ramsey sentences. Any\nfurther analytic conceptual commitments add nothing of philosophical\nsignificance.\nThe point generalizes beyond the contrast between Ramsey and Carnap\nsentences. On reflection, it is hard to see why any purely\ndefinitional analytic truths should matter to philosophy. Synthetic\neveryday truisms can certainly be philosophically significant, and so\ntheir articulation and evaluation can play an important philosophical\nrole. But there is no obvious motive for philosophy to concern itself\nwith definitions that carry no implications about the contents of\nreality. \n",
