The name is somewhat misleading, for in a single\nsection of his Pens\u00e9es, Pascal apparently\npresents\u00a0four\u00a0such arguments, each of which might\nbe called a \u2018wager\u2019\u2014it is only the third\u00a0of\nthese that is traditionally referred to as \u201cPascal\u2019s\nWager\u201d. We find in it the extraordinary confluence of several\nimportant strands of thought: the justification of theism; probability\ntheory and decision theory, used here for almost the first time in\nhistory; pragmatism; voluntarism (the thesis that belief is a matter\nof the will); and the use of the concept of infinity.\n\nWe will begin with some brief stage-setting: some historical\nbackground, some of the basics of decision theory, and some of the\nexegetical problems that the Pens\u00e9es pose.

Background\n\nIt is important to contrast Pascal\u2019s argument with various\nputative \u2018proofs\u2019 of the existence of God that had come\nbefore it. Anselm\u2019s ontological argument, Aquinas\u2019\n\u2018five ways\u2019, Descartes\u2019 ontological and cosmological\narguments, and so on, purport to prove that God exists. Pascal is\napparently unimpressed by such attempted justifications of theism:\n\u201cEndeavour \u2026 to convince yourself, not by increase of\nproofs of God\u2026\u201d Indeed, he insists that \u201cwe do not\nknow if He is \u2026\u201d. Pascal\u2019s project, then, is\nradically different. He aims to show that we\u00a0ought to\nbelieve in God, rather than that God\nexists.\u00a0And\u00a0he seeks to provide prudential\nreasons rather than evidential reasons\u00a0for believing in\nGod. To put it simply, we should wager that God exists because it is\nthe best bet. Ryan 1994 finds precursors to this line of\nreasoning in the writings of Plato, Arnobius, Lactantius, and others;\nwe might add Ghazali to his list\u2014see Palacios 1920. Franklin\n2018 presents striking parallels to Pascal\u2019s Wager by Sirmond\nand Chillingworth from 1637 and 1638 respectively, thus predating\nPascal by a few years. But what is distinctive is Pascal\u2019s\nexplicitly decision-theoretic formulation of the reasoning. In fact,\nHacking 1975 describes the Wager as \u201cthe first well-understood\ncontribution to decision theory\u201d (viii). Thus, we should pause\nbriefly to review some of the basics of that theory.\n\nIn any decision problem, the way the world is, and what an agent does,\ntogether determine an outcome for the agent. We may assign\nutilities to such outcomes, numbers that represent the degree\nto which the agent values them. It is typical to present these numbers\nin a decision table, with the columns corresponding to the various\nrelevant states of the world, and the rows corresponding to the\nvarious possible actions that the agent can perform.\n\nIn decisions under uncertainty, nothing more is\ngiven\u2014in particular, the agent does not assign subjective\nprobabilities to the states of the world. Still, sometimes rationality\ndictates a unique decision nonetheless. Consider, for example, a case\nthat will be particularly relevant here. Suppose that you have two\npossible actions, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), and the worst outcome\nassociated with \\(A_1\\) is at least as good as the best outcome\nassociated with \\(A_2\\); suppose also that in at least one state of\nthe world, \\(A_1\\)\u2019s outcome is strictly better than\n\\(A_2\\)\u2019s. Let's say in that case that \\(A_1\\)\nsuperdominates \\(A_2\\). Then rationality seems to require you\nto perform\n \\(A_1\\).[1]\n\nExample. A magician will toss a coin. You know\nnothing about the coin\u2014it might be a normal coin, it might be\ntwo-headed, it might be two-tailed, and it might be biased to any\ndegree. Suppose that in this state of complete ignorance about the\ncoin, you do not assign any probability whatsoever to its landing\nheads. Suppose that you can either bet on heads or on tails; it costs\nnothing to bet, and you will win $1 if you bet correctly. But I will\npay you an extra $1 if you bet on heads (I especially like bets on\nheads). Your possible total pay-offs are given by this decision\ntable:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nBet on heads\n2\n1 \n\nBet on tails\n0\n1  \n\n\nBetting on heads superdominates betting on tails. The worst outcome\nassociated with betting on heads (which pays $1)\u00a0 is at least as\ngood as the best outcome associated with betting on tails (which pays\n$1); and if the coin lands heads, the outcome associated with betting\non heads pays more than that associated with tails ($2 >\n$0). Moreover, it seems clear that you should bet on heads.\n\nIn decisions under risk, the agent assigns subjective\nprobabilities to the various states of the world. Assume that the\nstates of the world are independent of what the agent does. A figure\nof merit called the expected utility, or the\nexpectation of a given action can be calculated by a simple\nformula: for each state, multiply the utility that the action produces\nin that state by the state\u2019s probability; then, add these\nnumbers. According to decision theory, rationality requires you to\nperform the action of maximum expected utility (if there is one).\n\nExample. Suppose that the utility of money is linear\nin number of dollars: you value money at exactly its face value.\nSuppose now that you know that a fair\u00a0coin will be\ntossed, and so you assign probability 1/2 to heads and 1/2 to tails.\nIt costs a dollar to play the following game. If the coin lands heads,\nyou will win $3; if it lands tails, you will get nothing.\u00a0\n(Including the initial cost of playing, the total possible payoffs are\n$1 less than these respective amounts.) Should you play? Here is the\ndecision table:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nPlay\n2\n\u20131 \n\nDo not play\n0\n0  \n\n\nThe expectation of playing is (2 x 1/2)\u00a0 + (\u20131 x 1/2) =\n1/2. This exceeds the expectation of not playing\u2014namely\n0\u2014so you should play.\n\nAnd now suppose that the the payoff if the coin lands heads is reduced\nby $1, so that the decision table becomes:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nPlay\n1\n\u20131 \n\nDo not play\n0\n0  \n\n\nThen consistent with decision theory, you could either play or not,\nfor either way your expectation would be 0.\n\nConsiderations such as these will play a crucial role in\nPascal\u2019s arguments. It should be admitted that there are certain\nexegetical problems in presenting these arguments. Pascal never\nfinished the Pens\u00e9es, but rather left them in the form\nof notes of various sizes pinned together. Hacking 1972 describes the\n\u201cInfinite\u2014nothing\u201d as consisting of \u201ctwo\npieces of paper covered on both sides by handwriting going in all\ndirections, full of erasures, corrections, insertions, and\nafterthoughts\u201d\n (24).[2]\n This may explain why certain passages are notoriously difficult to\ninterpret, as we will see. Furthermore, our formulation of the\narguments in the parlance of modern Bayesian decision theory might\nappear somewhat anachronistic. For example, Pascal did not distinguish\nbetween what we would now call objective and\nsubjective probability, although it is clear that it is the\nlatter that is relevant to his arguments. To some extent,\n\u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d now has a life of its own, and our\npresentation of it here is perfectly standard. Still, we will closely\nfollow Pascal\u2019s text, supporting our reading of his arguments as\nmuch as possible. (See also Golding 1994 for another detailed analysis\nof Pascal\u2019s reasoning, broken down into more steps than the\npresentation here.)\n\nThere is the further problem of dividing the Infinite-nothing\ninto separate arguments. We will locate three arguments that each\nconclude that rationality requires you to wager for God, although they\ninterleave in the\n text.[3]\n Finally, there is some disagreement over just what \u201cwagering\nfor God\u201d involves\u2014is it believing in God, or\nmerely engendering belief? We will conclude with a discussion\nof what Pascal meant by this.\n2. The Argument from Superdominance\n\nPascal maintains that we are incapable of knowing whether God exists\nor not, yet we must \u201cwager\u201d one way or the other. Reason\ncannot settle which way we should incline, but a consideration of the\nrelevant outcomes supposedly can. Here is the first key passage:\n\n\u201cGod is, or He is not.\u201d But to which side shall we\nincline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos\nwhich separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this\ninfinite distance where heads or tails will turn up\u2026 Which will\nyou choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which\ninterests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the\ngood; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your\nknowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun,\nerror and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one\nrather than the other, since you must of necessity choose\u2026 But\nyour happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that\nGod is\u2026 If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose\nnothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.\n\n\nThere are exegetical problems already here, partly because Pascal\nappears to contradict himself. He speaks of \u201cthe true\u201d as\nsomething that you can \u201close\u201d, and \u201cerror\u201d as\nsomething \u201cto shun\u201d. Yet he goes on to claim that if you\nlose the wager that God is, then \u201cyou lose nothing\u201d.\nSurely in that case you \u201close the true\u201d, which is just to\nsay that you have made an error, and since this is something \u201cto\nshun\u201d, it is presumably a cost.\u00a0Pascal believes, of course,\nthat the existence of God is \u201cthe true\u201d\u2014but\nthat is not something that he can appeal to in this argument.\nMoreover, it is not because \u201cyou must of necessity choose\u201d\nthat \u201cyour reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than\nthe other\u201d. Rather, by Pascal\u2019s own account, it is because\n\u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here\u201d. (If it could, then it\nmight well be shocked\u2014namely, if you chose in a way contrary to\nit.)\n\nFollowing McClennen 1994, Pascal\u2019s argument seems to be best\ncaptured as presenting the following decision table:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\nGain all\nStatus quo \n\nWager against God\nMisery\nStatus quo  \n\n\nWagering for God superdominates wagering against God: the worst\noutcome associated with wagering for God (status quo) is at least as\ngood as the best outcome associated with wagering against God (status\nquo); and if God exists, the result of wagering for God is strictly\nbetter than the result of wagering against God. (The fact that the\nresult is much better does not matter yet.) Pascal draws the\nconclusion at this point that you should wager for God.\n\nWithout any assumption about your probability assignment to\nGod\u2019s existence, the argument is invalid. Rationality does\nnot require you to wager for God if you assign probability 0\nto God existing, as a strict atheist might. And Pascal does not\nexplicitly rule this possibility out until a later passage, when he\nassumes that you assign positive probability to God\u2019s existence;\nyet this argument is presented as if it is self-contained. His claim\nthat \u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here\u201d may suggest that\nPascal regards this as a decision under uncertainty, which is to\nassume that you do not assign probability at all to\nGod\u2019s existence. If that is a further premise, then the argument\nis apparently valid; but that premise contradicts his subsequent\nassumption that you assign positive probability. See McClennen for a\nreading of this argument as a decision under uncertainty.\n\nPascal appears to be aware of a further objection to this argument,\nfor he immediately imagines an opponent replying:\n\n\u201cThat is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager\ntoo much.\u201d\n\n\nThe thought seems to be that if I wager for God, and God does not\nexist, then I really do lose something. In fact, Pascal himself speaks\nof staking something when one wagers for God, which\npresumably one loses if God does not exist. (We have already mentioned\n\u2018the true\u2019 as one such thing; Pascal also seems to regard\none\u2019s worldly life as another.) In that case, the table is\nmistaken in presenting the two outcomes under \u2018God does not\nexist\u2019 as if they were the same, and we do not have a case of\nsuperdominance after all.\n\nPascal addresses this at once in his second argument, which we will\ndiscuss only briefly, as it can be thought of as just a prelude to the\nmain argument.\n3. The Argument From Expectation\n\nHe continues:\n\nLet us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you\nhad only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But\nif there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you\nare under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when\nyou are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a\ngame where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there is an\neternity of life and happiness.\n\n\nUnderstanding \u201cequal risk\u201d here\u00a0as \u201cequal\nprobability\u201d, the probability of gain (winning the wager) and of\nloss (losing the wager) must each be 1/2.\u00a0His hypothetically\nspeaking of \u201ctwo lives\u201d and \u201cthree lives\u201d may\nstrike one as odd. It is helpful to bear in mind Pascal\u2019s\ninterest in gambling (which after all provided the initial motivation\nfor his study of probability) and to take the gambling model quite\nseriously here. Indeed, the Wager is permeated with gambling\nmetaphors: \u201cgame\u201d, \u201cstake\u201d, \u201cheads or\ntails\u201d, \u201ccards\u201d and, of course, \u201cwager\u201d.\nNow, recall our calculation of the expectations of the two dollar and\nthree dollar gambles. Pascal apparently assumes now that utility is\nlinear in number of lives, that wagering for God costs\n\u201cone life\u201d, and then reasons analogously to the way we did\nin our expectation calculations above! This is, as it were, a warm-up.\nSince wagering for God is rationally required even in the hypothetical\ncase in which one of the prizes is three lives, then all the more it\nis rationally required in the actual case, in which one of the prizes\nis an eternity of life (salvation).\n\nSo Pascal has now made two striking assumptions:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1). The probability of God\u2019s existence is\n1/2.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2). Wagering for God brings infinite\nreward if God exists.\n\nMorris 1994 is sympathetic to (1), while Hacking 1972 finds it\n\u201ca monstrous premiss\u201d (189). One way to defend it is via\nthe classical interpretation of probability, according to which all\npossibilities are given equal weight. The interpretation seems\nattractive for various gambling games, which by design involve an\nevidential symmetry with respect to their outcomes; and Pascal even\nlikens God\u2019s existence to a coin toss, evidentially speaking.\nHowever, unless more is said, the interpretation yields implausible,\nand even contradictory results. (You have a one-in-a-million chance of\nwinning the lottery; but either you win the lottery or you\ndon\u2019t, so each of these possibilities has probability 1/2?!)\nPascal\u2019s argument for (1) is presumably that \u201c[r]eason can\ndecide nothing here\u201d. (In the lottery ticket case, reason can\ndecide something.) But it is not clear that complete\nignorance should be modeled as equiprobability. Morris imagines,\nrather, an agent who does have evidence for and against the existence\nof God, but it is equally balanced. In any case, it \\(is\\) clear that\nthere are people in Pascal\u2019s audience who do not assign\nprobability 1/2 to God\u2019s existence. This argument, then, does\nnot speak to them.\n\nHowever, Pascal realizes that the value of 1/2 actually plays no real\nrole in the argument, thanks to (2). This brings us to the third, and\nby far the most important, of his arguments.\n4. The Argument From Generalized Expectations: \u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d\n\nWe continue the quotation.\n\nBut there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if\nthere were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you,\nyou would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act\nstupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against\nthree at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one\nfor you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to\ngain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to\ngain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and\nwhat you stake is finite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is\nand there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain,\nthere is no time to hesitate, you must give all\u2026\n\n\nAgain this passage is difficult to understand completely.\nPascal\u2019s talk of winning two, or three, lives is a little\nmisleading. By his own decision theoretic lights, you would\nnot act stupidly \u201cby refusing to stake one life against\nthree at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one\nfor you\u201d\u2014in fact, you should not stake more than an\ninfinitesimal amount in that case (an amount that is bigger than 0,\nbut smaller than every positive real number). The point, rather, is\nthat the prospective prize is \u201can infinity of an infinitely\nhappy life\u201d. In short, if God exists, then wagering for God\nresults in infinite utility.\n\nWhat about the utilities for the other possible outcomes? There is\nsome dispute over the utility of \u201cmisery\u201d. Hacking\ninterprets this as \u201cdamnation\u201d (188), and Pascal does\nlater speak of \u201chell\u201d as the outcome in this case. Martin\n1983 among others assigns this a value of negative infinity.\nSobel 1996, on the other hand, is one author who takes this value to\nbe finite. There is some textual support for this reading: \u201cThe\njustice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now justice to the\noutcast is less vast \u2026 than mercy towards the elect\u201d. As\nfor the utilities of the outcomes associated with God\u2019s\nnon-existence, Pascal tells us that \u201cwhat you stake is\nfinite\u201d. This suggests that whatever these values are, they are\nfinite.\n\nPascal\u2019s guiding insight is that the argument from expectation\ngoes through equally well whatever your probability for\nGod\u2019s existence is, provided that it is non-zero and finite\n(non-infinitesimal)\u2014\u201ca chance of gain against a finite\nnumber of chances of\n loss\u201d.[4]\n\nPascal\u2019s assumptions about utilities and probabilities are now\nin place. In another landmark moment in this passage, he next presents\na formulation of expected utility theory. When gambling, \u201cevery\nplayer stakes a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a\nfinite certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing\nagainst reason\u201d. How much, then, should a player be prepared to\nstake without transgressing against reason? Here is Pascal\u2019s\nanswer: \u201c\u2026 the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to\nthe certainty of the stake according to the proportion of the chances\nof gain and loss \u2026\u201d It takes some work to show that this\nyields expected utility theory\u2019s answer exactly, but it is work\nwell worth doing for its historical importance and is included in \na footnote.[5].)\n\nLet us now gather together all of these points into a single argument.\nWe can think of Pascal\u2019s Wager as having three premises: the\nfirst concerns the decision table\u00a0of rewards, the second concerns\nthe probability that you should give to God\u2019s existence, and the\nthird is a maxim about rational decision-making. Specifically:\n\n\n\nEither God exists or God does not exist, and you can either wager for\nGod or wager against God. The utilities of the relevant possible\noutcomes are as follows, where \\(f_1, f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\) are numbers\nwhose values are not specified beyond the requirement that they be\nfinite:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\\(f_1\\) \n\nWager against God\n\\(f_2\\)\n\\(f_3\\)  \n \nRationality requires the probability that you assign to God\nexisting to be positive (and finite).\nRationality requires you to perform the act of maximum expected\nutility (when there is one).\nConclusion 1. Rationality requires you to wager for\nGod.\nConclusion 2. You should wager for God.\n\n\nWe have a decision under risk, with probabilities assigned to the ways\nthe world could be, and utilities assigned to the outcomes. In\nparticular, we represent the infinite utility associated with\nsalvation as \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019. We assume that the real line is\nextended to include the element \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019, and that the\nbasic arithmetical operations are extended as follows:\n\nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty + r = \\infty\\).\n\nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty \\times r = \\infty\\) if \\(r \\gt\n0\\).\n\nThe first conclusion seems to follow from the usual calculations of\nexpected utility (where \\(p\\) is your positive (and finite)\nprobability for God\u2019s existence): \n\\[ \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager for God}) = \\infty \\times p + f_1 \\times(1 - p) = \\infty \\]\n\n\nThat is, your expected utility of belief in God is infinite\u2014as\nPascal puts it, \u201cour proposition is of infinite force\u201d. On\nthe other hand, your expected utility of wagering against God is\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager against God}) = f_2 \\times p + f_3 \\times(1 - p) \\]\n\n\nThis is\n finite.[6]\n By premise 3, rationality requires you to perform the act of maximum\nexpected utility. Therefore, rationality requires you to wager for\nGod.\n\nWe now survey some of the main objections to the argument.\n5. Objections to Pascal\u2019s Wager\n5.1 Premise 1: The Decision Table\n\nHere the objections are manifold. Most of them can be stated quickly,\nbut we will give special attention to what has generally been regarded\nas the most important of them, \u2018the many Gods objection\u2019\n(see also the link to footnote 7).\n\n1. Different decision tables for different people. The argument\nassumes that the same decision table\u00a0applies to everybody.\nHowever, perhaps the relevant rewards are different for different\npeople. Perhaps, for example, there is a predestined infinite reward\nfor the Chosen, whatever they do, and finite utility for the rest, as\nMackie 1982 suggests. Or maybe the prospect of salvation appeals more\nto some people than to others, as Swinburne 1969 has noted.\n\nEven granting that a single \\(2 \\times 2\\)\u00a0table\u00a0applies to\neverybody, one might dispute the values that enter into it. This\nbrings us to the next two objections.\n\n2. The utility of salvation could not be infinite. One might\nargue that the very notion of infinite utility is suspect\u2014see\nfor example Jeffrey 1983 and McClennen\n 1994.[7]\n Hence, the objection continues, whatever the utility of salvation\nmight be, it must be finite. Strict finitists, who are suspicious of\nthe notion of infinity in general, will agree\u2014see Dummett 1978\nand Wright 1987. Or perhaps the notion of infinite utility makes\nsense, but an infinite reward could only be finitely appreciated by a\nhuman being.\n\n3. There should be more than one infinity in the table. There\nare also critics of the Wager who, far from objecting to infinite\nutilities, want to see more of them in the table. For\nexample, it might be thought that a forgiving God would bestow\ninfinite utility upon wagerers-for and wagerers-against\nalike\u2014Rescher 1985 is one author who entertains this\npossibility. Or it might be thought that, on the contrary, wagering\nagainst an existent God results in negative infinite utility.\n(As we have noted, some authors read Pascal himself as saying as\nmuch.) Either way, \\(f_2\\) is not really finite at all, but \\(\\infty\\)\nor \\(-\\infty\\) as the case may be. And perhaps \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_3\\)\ncould be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\). Suppose, for instance, that God\ndoes not exist, but that we are reincarnated ad infinitum,\nand that the total utility we receive is an infinite sum that diverges\nto infinity or to negative infinity.\n\n4. The table\u00a0should have more rows. Perhaps there is more\nthan one way to wager for God, and the rewards that God bestows vary\naccordingly. For instance, God might not reward infinitely those who\nstrive to believe in Him only for the very mercenary reasons that\nPascal gives, as James 1956 has observed. One could also imagine\ndistinguishing belief based on faith from belief based on evidential\nreasons, and posit different rewards in each case.\n\n5. The table\u00a0should have more columns: the many Gods\nobjection. If Pascal is really right that reason can decide\nnothing here, then it would seem that various other theistic\nhypotheses are also live options. Pascal presumably had in mind the\nCatholic conception of God\u2014let us suppose that this is the God\nwho either \u2018exists\u2019 or \u2018does not exist\u2019. By\nexcluded middle, this is a partition. The objection, then, is that the\npartition is not sufficiently fine-grained, and the \u2018(Catholic)\nGod does not exist\u2019 column really subdivides into various\nother theistic hypotheses. The objection could equally run\nthat Pascal\u2019s argument \u2018proves too much\u2019: by\nparallel reasoning we can \u2018show\u2019 that rationality requires\nbelieving in various incompatible theistic hypotheses. As Diderot\n(1746) puts the point: \u201cAn Imam could reason just as well this\n way\u201d.[8]\n\nSince then, the point has been presented again and refined in various\nways. Mackie 1982 writes, \u201cthe church within which alone\nsalvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but\nperhaps that of the Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or\nthe worshippers of Kali or of Odin\u201d (203). Cargile 1966 shows\njust how easy it is to multiply theistic hypotheses: for each real\nnumber \\(x\\), consider the God who prefers contemplating \\(x\\) more\nthan any other activity. It seems, then, that such \u2018alternative\ngods\u2019 are a dime a dozen\u2014or \\(\\aleph_1\\), for that\nmatter.\n\nIn response, some authors argue that in such a competition among\nvarious possible deities for one\u2019s belief, some are more\nprobable than others. Although there may be ties among the expected\nutilities\u2014all infinite\u2014for believing in various ones among\nthem, their respective probabilities can be used as tie-breakers.\nSchlesinger (1994, 90) offers this principle: \u201cIn cases where\nthe mathematical expectations are infinite, the criterion for choosing\nthe outcome to bet on is its probability\u201d. (Note that this\nprinciple is not found in the Wager itself, although it might be\nregarded as a friendly addition. Askell 2018 proposes a similar\nprinciple.) Are there reasons, then, for assigning higher probability\nto some Gods than others? Jordan (1994a, 107) suggests that some\noutlandish theistic hypotheses may be dismissed for having \u201cno\nbacking of tradition\u201d. Similarly, Schlesinger maintains that\nPascal is addressing readers who \u201chave a notion of what genuine\nreligion is about\u201d (88), and we might take that to suggest that\nCargile\u2019s imagined Gods, for example, may be correspondingly\nassigned lower probability than Pascal\u2019s God. Franklin (2018,\n41) writes that \u201c[Pascal's] rhetoric is addressed to real\nagents, namely \u201dmen of the world\u201c in the Paris of 1660\u201d\u00a0for\nwhom \u201cthe spectrum of religious theories to which they attached\ngrounded subjective non-zero probability consisted of just Catholicism\nand atheism\u201d. Saka (2018, 190\u2013191) replies to various authors\nwho relativise the Wager to Pascal's intended audience that\n\u201cPascal's peers knew of Greco-Roman paganism, Judaism, Islam,\nnew-world paganism, and multiple brands of Protestantism; they knew of\nalleged Satanism \u2026 and they knew, from their acquaintance with the\nforegoing, that still other religions could readily be\nhypothesized.\u201d\u00a0But still there is the issue of what\nprobabilities should be assigned to alternative deities.\u00a0Lycan\nand Schlesinger 1989 give more theoretical reasons for favoring\nPascal\u2019s God over others in one\u2019s probability assignments.\nThey begin by noting the familiar problem in science of\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence. Faced with a multiplicity of\ntheories that all fit the observed data equally well, we favor the\nsimplest such theory. They go on to argue that simplicity\nconsiderations similarly favor a conception of God as\n\u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d, \u201cwhich is theologically unique\nin that it implies all the other predicates traditionally ascribed to\nGod\u201d (104), and we may add that this conception is\nPascal\u2019s. Conceptions of rival Gods, by contrast, leave open\nvarious questions about their nature, the answering of which would\ndetract from their simplicity, and thus their probability.\n\nFinally, Bartha 2012 models one\u2019s probability assignments to\nvarious theistic hypotheses as evolving over time according to a\n\u2018deliberational dynamics\u2019 somewhat analogous to the\ndynamics of evolution by natural selection. So understood,\nPascal\u2019s Wager is not a single decision, but rather a sequence\nof decisions in which one\u2019s probabilities update sequentially in\nproportion to how choiceworthy each God appeared to be in the previous\nround. (This relies on a sophisticated handling of infinite utilities\nin terms of utility ratios given in his 2007; see below.) He argues\nthat a given probability assignment is choiceworthy only if it is an\nequilibrium of this deliberational dynamics. He shows that certain\nassignments are choiceworthy by this criterion, thus providing a kind\nof vindication of Pascal against the many Gods objection.\n5.2 Premise 2: The Probability Assigned to God\u2019s Existence\n\nThere are four sorts of problem for this premise. The first two are\nstraightforward; the second two are more technical, and can be found\nby following the link to footnote 9.\n\n1. Undefined probability for God\u2019s existence. Premise 1\npresupposes that you should have a probability for\nGod\u2019s existence in the first place. However, perhaps you could\nrationally fail to assign it a probability\u2014your\nprobability that God exists could remain undefined. We cannot\nenter here into the thorny issues concerning the attribution of\nprobabilities to agents. But there is some support for this response\neven in Pascal\u2019s own text, again at the pivotal claim that\n\u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos\nwhich separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this\ninfinite distance where heads or tails will turn up\u2026\u201d The\nthought could be that any probability assignment is inconsistent with\na state of \u201cepistemic nullity\u201d (in Morris\u2019 1986\nphrase): to assign a probability at all\u2014even 1/2\u2014to\nGod\u2019s existence is to feign having evidence that one in fact\ntotally lacks. For unlike a coin that we know to be fair, this\nmetaphorical \u2018coin\u2019 is \u2018infinitely far\u2019 from\nus, hence apparently completely unknown to us. Perhaps, then,\nrationality actually requires us to refrain from assigning a\nprobability to God\u2019s existence (in which case at least the\nArgument from Superdominance would apparently be valid). Or perhaps\nrationality does not require it, but at least permits it.\nEither way, the Wager would not even get off the ground.\n\n2. Zero probability for God\u2019s existence. Strict atheists\nmay insist on the rationality of a probability assignment of 0, as\nOppy 1990 among others points out. For example, they may contend that\nreason alone can settle that God does not exist, perhaps by\narguing that the very notion of an omniscient, omnipotent,\nomnibenevolent being is contradictory. Or a Bayesian might hold that\nrationality places no constraint on probabilistic judgments beyond\ncoherence (or conformity to the probability calculus). Then as long as\nthe strict atheist assigns probability 1 to God\u2019s non-existence\nalongside his or her assignment of 0 to God\u2019s existence, no norm\nof rationality has been violated.\n\nFurthermore, an assignment of \\(p = 0\\) would clearly block the route\nto Pascal\u2019s conclusion, under the usual assumption that\n\n\\[ \\infty \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\n\nFor then the expectation calculations become: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager for God}) &= \\infty \\times 0 + f_1 \\times(1 - 0) \\\\\n &= f_1 \\\\\n &\\\\\n \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager against God}) &= f_2 \\times 0 + f_3 \\times(1 - 0) \\\\\n &= f_3 \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nAnd nothing in the argument implies that \\(f_1 \\gt f_3\\). (Indeed,\nthis inequality is questionable, as even Pascal seems to allow.) In\nshort, Pascal\u2019s wager has no pull on strict\n atheists.[9]\n5.3 Premise 3: Rationality Requires Maximizing Expected Utility\n\nFinally, one could question Pascal\u2019s decision theoretic\nassumption that rationality requires one to perform the act of maximum\nexpected utility (when there is one). Now perhaps this is an\nanalytic truth, in which case we could grant it to Pascal without\nfurther discussion\u2014perhaps it is constitutive of\nrationality to maximize expectation, as some might say. But this\npremise has met serious objections. The Allais 1953 and Ellsberg 1961\nparadoxes, for example, are said to show that maximizing expectation\ncan lead one to perform intuitively sub-optimal actions. So too the\nSt. Petersburg paradox, in which it is supposedly absurd that one\nshould be prepared to pay any finite amount to play a game with\ninfinite expectation. (That paradox is particularly apposite\n here.)[10]\n\nVarious refinements of expected utility theory have been suggested as\na result of such problems. For example, we might consider expected\ndifferences between the pay-offs of options, and prefer one\noption to another if and only if the expected difference of the former\nrelative to the latter is positive\u2014see H\u00e1jek and Nover\n2006, H\u00e1jek 2006, Colyvan 2008, and Colyvan & H\u00e1jek\n2016. Or we might consider suitably defined utility ratios,\nand prefer one option to another if and only if the utility ratio of\nthe former relative to the latter is greater than 1\u2014see Bartha\n2007. If we either admit refinements of traditional expected utility\ntheory, or are pluralistic about our decision rules, then premise 3 is\napparently false as it stands. Nonetheless, the door is opened to some\nsuitable reformulation of it that might serve Pascal\u2019s purposes.\nIndeed, Bartha argues that his ratio-based reformulation answers some\nof the most pressing objections to the Wager that turn on its\ninvocation of infinite utility.\n\nFinally, one might distinguish between practical rationality\nand theoretical rationality. One could then concede that\npractical rationality requires you to maximize expected utility, while\ninsisting that theoretical rationality might require something else of\nyou\u2014say, proportioning belief to the amount of evidence\navailable. This objection is especially relevant, since Pascal admits\nthat perhaps you \u201cmust renounce reason\u201d in order to follow\nhis advice. But when these two sides of rationality pull in opposite\ndirections, as they apparently can here, it is not obvious that\npractical rationality should take precedence. (For a discussion of\npragmatic, as opposed to theoretical, reasons for belief, see Foley\n1994.)\n5.4 Is the Argument Valid?\n\nA number of authors who have been otherwise critical of the Wager have\nexplicitly conceded that the Wager is valid\u2014e.g. Mackie 1982,\nRescher 1985, Mougin and Sober 1994, and most emphatically, Hacking\n1972. That is, these authors agree with Pascal that wagering for God\nreally is rationally mandated by Pascal\u2019s decision table\u00a0in\ntandem with positive probability for God\u2019s existence, and the\ndecision theoretic account of rational action.\n\nHowever, Duff 1986 and H\u00e1jek 2003 argue that the argument is in\nfact invalid. Their point is that there are strategies besides\nwagering for God that also have infinite expectation\u2014namely,\nmixed strategies, whereby you do not wager for or against God\noutright, but rather choose which of these actions to perform on the\nbasis of the outcome of some chance device. Consider the mixed\nstrategy: \u201cToss a fair coin: heads, you wager for God; tails,\nyou wager against God\u201d. By Pascal\u2019s lights, with\nprobability 1/2 your expectation will be infinite, and with\nprobability 1/2 it will be finite. The expectation of the entire\nstrategy is: \n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\times [f_2 \\times p + f_3 \\times(1 - p)] = \\infty \\]\n\n\nThat is, the \u2018coin toss\u2019 strategy has the same expectation\nas outright wagering for God. But the probability 1/2 was incidental\nto the result. Any mixed strategy that gives positive and finite\nprobability to wagering for God will likewise have infinite\nexpectation: \u201cwager for God iff a fair die lands 6\u201d,\n\u201cwager for God iff your lottery ticket wins\u201d, \u201cwager\nfor God iff a meteor quantum tunnels its way through the side of your\nhouse\u201d, and so on.\n\nIt can be argued that the problem is still worse than this, though,\nfor there is a sense in which anything that you do might be\nregarded as a mixed strategy between wagering for God, and wagering\nagainst God, with suitable probability weights given to each. Suppose\nthat you choose to ignore the Wager, and to go and have a hamburger\ninstead. Still, you may well assign positive and finite probability to\nyour winding up wagering for God nonetheless; and this probability\nmultiplied by infinity again gives infinity. So ignoring the Wager and\nhaving a hamburger has the same expectation as outright wagering for\nGod. Even worse, suppose that you focus all your energy into\navoiding belief in God. Still, you may well assign positive\nand finite probability to your efforts failing, with the result that\nyou wager for God nonetheless. In that case again, your expectation is\ninfinite again. So even if rationality requires you to perform the act\nof maximum expected utility when there is one, here there isn\u2019t\none. Rather, there is a many-way tie for first place, as it were. All\nhell breaks loose: anything you might do is maximally good by expected\nutility\n lights![11]\n\nMonton 2011 defends Pascal\u2019s Wager against this line of\nobjection. He argues that an atheist or agnostic has more than one\nopportunity to follow a mixed strategy. Returning to the first example\nof one, suppose that the fair coin lands tails. Monton\u2019s thought\nis that your expected utility now changes; it is no longer infinite,\nbut rather that of an atheist or agnostic who has no prospect of the\ninfinite reward for wagering for God. You are back to where you\nstarted. But since it was rational for you to follow the mixed\nstrategy the first time, it is rational for you to follow it again\nnow\u2014that is, to toss the coin again. And if it lands tails\nagain, it is rational for you to toss the coin again \u2026 With\nprobability 1, the coin will land heads eventually, and from that\npoint on you will wager for God. Similar reasoning applies to wagering\nfor God just in case an n-sided die lands 1 (say): with probability 1\nthe die will eventually land 1, so if you repeatedly base your mixed\nstrategy on the die, with probability 1 you will wind up wagering for\nGod after a finite number of rolls. Robertson 2012 replies that not\nall such mixed strategies are (probabilistically) guaranteed to lead\nto your wagering for God in the long run: not ones in which the\nprobability of wagering for God decreases sufficiently fast on\nsuccessive trials. Think, for example, of rolling a 4-sided die, then\na 9-sided die, and in general an \\((n+1)^2\\)-sided die on the\n\\(n\\)th trial \u2026, a strategy for which the\nprobability that you will eventually wager for God is only 1/2, as\nRobertson shows. However, Easwaran and Monton 2012 counter-reply that\nwith a continuum of times at which the dice can be rolled, the\nsequence of rolls that Robertson proposes can be completed in an\narbitrarily short period of time. In that case, what should you do\nnext? By Monton\u2019s argument, it seems you should roll a die\nagain. Easwaran and Monton prove that if there are uncountably many\ntimes at which one implements a mixed strategy with non-zero\nprobability of wagering for God, then with probability 1, one ends up\nwagering for God at one of these times. (And they assume, as is\nstandard, that once one wagers for God there is no going back.) They\nconcede that imagining uncountably rolls of a die, say, involves an\nidealization that is surely not physically realizable. But they\nmaintain that you should act in the way that an idealized version of\nyourself would eventually act, one who can realize the rolls\nas described\u2014that is, wager for God outright.\n\nThere is a further twist on the mixed strategies objection. To repeat,\nthe objection\u2019s upshot is that even granting Pascal all his\npremises, still wagering for God is not rationally required. But we\nhave seen numerous reasons not to grant all his premises.\nVery well then; let\u2019s not. Indeed, let\u2019s suppose that you\ngive tiny probability p to them all being true, where \\(p\\)\nis positive and finite. So you assign probability \\(p\\) to your\ndecision problem being exactly as Pascal claims it to be. But if it\nis, according to the mixed strategies objection, all hell breaks\nloose. Yet again, \\(p\\) multiplied by infinity gives infinity. Hence,\nit seems that each action that gets infinite expected utility\naccording to Pascal similarly gets infinite expected utility according\nto you; but by the previous reasoning, that is anything you\nmight do. The full force of the objection that hit Pascal now hits you\ntoo. There are some subtleties that we have elided over; for example,\nif you also assign positive and finite probability to a source of\nnegative infinite utility, then the expected utilities\ninstead become \\(\\infty\\) \u2013 \\(\\infty\\), which is undefined. But\nthat is just another way for all hell to break loose for you: in that\ncase, you cannot evaluate the choiceworthiness of your possible\nactions at all. Either way, you face decision-theoretic paralysis. We\nmight call this Pascal\u2019s Revenge. See H\u00e1jek\n(2015) for more discussion.\n\nJackson and Rogers (2019), developing points in Jackson (2016), argue\nthat the mixed-strategies objection is a \u201cstructural, but not\nsubstantive\u201d (61) objection to Pascal's Wager. They provide\ncases in which it is clearly rational to prefer one infinite good to\nanother. They suggest a reformulation of how prospects of infinite\nrewards should be compared. (This also provides a response to the many\nGods objection.) H\u00e1jek (2003 and especially 2018) offers many\nvalid reformulations of the Wager with more nuanced representations of\nthe utility of salvation, such that the lower the probability of\nwagering for God, the lower the expected utility. See \n footnote 11 for\nfurther discussion.\n5.5 Moral Objections to Wagering for God\n\nLet us grant Pascal\u2019s first conclusion for the sake of the\nargument: rationality requires you to wager for God. The second\nconclusion, that you should wager for God, does not obviously\nfollow. All that we have granted is that one norm\u2014the norm of\nrationality\u2014prescribes wagering for God. For all that has been\nsaid, some other norm might prescribe wagering against God.\nAnd unless we can show that the rationality norm trumps the others, we\nhave not settled what you should do, all things considered.\n\nThere are several arguments to the effect that morality\nrequires you to wager against God. Pascal himself appears to\nbe aware of one such argument. He admits that if you do not believe in\nGod, his recommended course of action \u201cwill deaden your\nacuteness\u201d (This is Trotter\u2019s translation. Pascal\u2019s\noriginal French wording is \u201cvous ab\u00eatira\u201d, whose\nliteral translation is even more startling: \u201cwill make you a\nbeast\u201d.) One way of putting the argument is that wagering for\nGod may require you to corrupt yourself, thus violating a Kantian duty\nto yourself. Clifford 1877 argues that an individual\u2019s believing\nsomething on insufficient evidence harms society by promoting\ncredulity. Penelhum 1971 contends that the putative divine plan is\nitself immoral, condemning as it does honest non-believers to loss of\neternal happiness, when such unbelief is in no way culpable; and that\nto adopt the relevant belief is to be complicit to this immoral plan.\nSee Quinn 1994 for replies to these arguments. For example, against\nPenelhum he argues that as long as God treats non-believers justly,\nthere is nothing immoral about him bestowing special favor on\nbelievers, more perhaps than they deserve. (Note, however, that Pascal\nleaves open in the Wager whether the payoff for non-believers \\(is\\)\njust; indeed, as far as his argument goes, it may be extremely\nunjust.)\n\nFinally, Voltaire protests that there is something unseemly about the\nwhole Wager: \u201cThat article seems a bit indecent and childish;\nthat notion of gambling, of losses and winnings, does not suit the\ngravity of the subject\u201d (Voltaire 1778 [1961, 123]). This does\nnot so much support wagering against God, as dismissing all talk of\n\u2018wagerings\u2019 altogether. Schlesinger (1994, 84) canvasses a\nsharpened formulation of this objection: an appeal to greedy,\nself-interested motivations is incompatible with \u201cthe quest for\npiety\u201d that is essential to religion. He replies that the\npleasure of salvation that Pascal\u2019s Wager countenances is\n\u201cof the most exalted kind\u201d, and that if seeking it counts\nas greed at all, then it is \u201cthe manifestation of a noble greed\nthat is to be acclaimed\u201d (85). Franklin (1998, 2018) regards\nVoltaire as caricaturing Pascal's Wager and missing his key point that\n\u201cyou must wager\u201d. Franklin argues that given that the\nchoice Pascal presents is unavoidable, it should be made on the basis\nof a rational calculation, and that his conclusion concerns\naction, not the truth of theism.\n6. A Fourth \u201cWager\u201d?\n\nWe have concluded our discussion of what is traditionally known as\n\u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d. But Pascal has one last twist in\nstore for us. In his \u201cEnd of this address\u201d he writes\nregarding wagering for God:\n\nNow, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be\nfaithful, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful.\nCertainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and\nluxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will\nthereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this\nroad, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in\nwhat you risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered\nfor something certain and infinite, for which you have given\nnothing.\n\nThis passage makes two further striking claims regarding wagering for\nGod: you will \u201cgain in this life\u201d, and \u201cyou have\nwagered for something certain\u201d. The decision table can be\npresented as follows (with the outcomes ranked):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\n\n\nGain all\n\n(Best) \n\n\nGain in earthly life\n\n(Second best)  \n\nWager against God\n\n\nMisery\n\n(Worst) \n\n\nEarthly life\n\n(Third best)   \n\n\nThis is again a decision under uncertainty (in our technical\nsense)\u2014it involves no considerations of probability. Indeed,\n\u201cthe wager\u201d dissolves, twice over: utilities alone\ndefinitively settle that you should wager for God, and in any case it\nis not really a gamble at all, since your gain is certain! (That is my\nunderstanding of \u201cyou have wagered for something certain\u201d;\nit is not God's existence itself that\nis\u00a0\u201ccertain\u201d.)\u00a0The worst outcome associated with\nwagering for God (gain in earthly life) is\u00a0strictly\nbetter\u00a0than the best outcome associated with wagering\nagainst God (earthly life). It follows immediately that you should\nwager for God. H\u00e1jek (2018) calls this an argument\nfrom\u00a0superduperdominance. This is a valid argument for\nwagering for God, even if we allow that God's existence might be\nimpossible.\n\nPascal has come full circle back to the first wager, and he now goes\neven beyond it. The solution to\u00a0this\u00a0decision\nproblem is trivial. The status of this \u201cwager\u201d\u2014the\nsoundness or otherwise of this argument\u2014turns on whether one's\nprospects are as this decision table portrays them. See Jordan (2006)\nand (2018, 108\u2013109) for further discusion.\n7. What Does It Mean to \u201cWager for God\u201d?\n\nLet us now grant Pascal that, all things considered (rationality and\nmorality included), you should wager for God. What exactly does this\ninvolve?\n\nA number of authors read Pascal as arguing that you should\nbelieve in God\u2014see e.g. Quinn 1994, and Jordan 1994a.\nBut perhaps one cannot simply believe in God at will; and rationality\ncannot require the impossible. Pascal is well aware of this objection:\n\u201c[I] am so made that I cannot believe. What, then, would you\nhave me do?\u201d, says his imaginary interlocutor. However, he\ncontends that one can take steps to cultivate such belief:\n\nYou would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would\nlike to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of\nthose who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their\npossessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow,\nand who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the\nway by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the\nholy water, having masses said, etc. \u2026\n\n\nBut to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will\nlessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.\n\n\nWe find two main pieces of advice to the non-believer here: act like a\nbeliever, and suppress those passions that are obstacles to becoming a\nbeliever. And these are actions that one can perform at\nwill.\n\nBelieving in God is presumably one way to wager for God. This passage\nsuggests that even the non-believer can wager for God, by striving to\nbecome a believer. Critics may question the psychology of belief\nformation that Pascal presupposes, pointing out that one could strive\nto believe (perhaps by following exactly Pascal\u2019s prescription),\nyet fail. To this, a follower of Pascal might reply that the act of\ngenuine striving already displays a pureness of heart that God would\nfully reward.\n\nAccording to Pascal, \u2018wagering for God\u2019 and\n\u2018wagering against God\u2019 are contradictories, as there is no\navoiding wagering one way or another: \u201cyou must wager. It is not\noptional.\u201d The decision to wager for or against God is one that\nyou make at a time\u2014at \\(t\\), say. But of course Pascal does not\nthink that you would be infinitely rewarded for wagering for God\nmomentarily, then wagering against God thereafter; nor that you would\nbe infinitely rewarded for wagering for God sporadically\u2014only on\nthe last Thursday of each month, for example. What Pascal intends by\n\u2018wagering for God\u2019 is an ongoing action\u2014indeed, one\nthat continues until your death\u2014that involves your adopting a\ncertain set of practices and living the kind of life that fosters\nbelief in God. The decision problem for you at \\(t\\), then, is whether\nyou should embark on this course of action; to fail to do so is to\nwager against God at \\(t\\).\n8. The Continuing Influence of Pascal\u2019s Wager\n\nPascal\u2019s Wager vies with Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument for\nbeing the most famous argument in the philosophy of religion. Indeed,\nthe Wager arguably has greater influence nowadays than any other such\nargument\u2014not just in the service of Christian apologetics, but\nalso in its impact on various lines of thought associated with\ninfinity, decision theory, probability, epistemology, psychology, and\neven moral philosophy. It has provided a case study for attempts to\ndevelop infinite decision theories. In it, Pascal countenanced the\nnotion of infinitesimal probability long before philosophers such as\nLewis 1980 and Skyrms 1980 gave it prominence. It continues to put\ninto sharp relief the question of whether there can be pragmatic\nreasons for belief, and the putative difference between theoretical\nand practical rationality. It raises subtle issues about the extent to\nwhich one\u2019s beliefs can be a matter of the will, and the ethics\nof belief.\n\nReasoning reminiscent of Pascal\u2019s Wager, often with an explicit\nacknowledgment of it, also informs a number of debates in moral\nphilosophy, both theoretical and applied. Kenny 1985 suggests that\nnuclear Armageddon has negative infinite utility, and some might say\nthe same for the loss of even a single human life. Stich 1978\ncriticizes an argument that he attributes to Mazzocchi, that there\nshould be a total ban on recombinant DNA research, since such research\ncould lead to the \u201cAndromeda scenario\u201d of creating a\nkiller strain of bacterial culture against which humans are helpless;\nthe ban, moreover, should be enforced if the \u201cAndromeda scenario\nhas even the smallest possibility of occurring\u201d (191), in\nMazzocchi\u2019s words. This is plausibly read, then, as an\nassignment of negative infinite utility to the Andromeda scenario.\nMore recently, Colyvan, Cox, and Steele 2010 discuss Pascal\u2019s\nWager-like problems for certain deontological moral theories, in which\nviolations of duties are assigned negative infinite utility. Colyvan,\nJustus and Regan 2011 canvas difficulties associated with assigning\ninfinite value to the natural environment. Bartha and DesRoches 2017\nrespond, with an appeal to relative utility theory. Stone 2007 argues\nthat a version of Pascal\u2019s Wager applies to sustaining patients\nwho are in a persistent vegetative state; see Varelius 2013 for a\ndissenting view. Pascal\u2019s Wager has even been appealed to in the\nmedical debate over whether antibiotics should be used to prevent a\ncertain kind of inflammation in the heart (Shaw and Conway 2010).\n\nPascal\u2019s Wager is a watershed in the philosophy of religion. As\nwe have seen, it is also a great deal more besides.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allais, Maurice, 1953. \u201cLe Comportment de l\u2019Homme\nRationnel Devant la Risque: Critique des Postulats et Axiomes de\nl\u2019\u00c9cole Am\u00e9ricaine\u201d, <em>Econometrica</em>,\n21: 503\u2013546.", "Askell, Amanda, 2019. \u201cPrudential Objections to\nAtheism\u201d, in Graham Oppy (ed.), <em>A Companion to Atheism and\nPhilosophy</em>, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.", "Bartha, Paul, 2007. \u201cTaking Stock of Infinite Value:\nPascal\u2019s Wager and Relative Utilities,\u201d <em>Synthese</em>,\n154: 5\u201352.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012. \u201cMany Gods, Many Wagers:\nPascal\u2019s Wager Meets the Replicator Dynamics\u201d, in Jake\nChandler and Victoria S.
