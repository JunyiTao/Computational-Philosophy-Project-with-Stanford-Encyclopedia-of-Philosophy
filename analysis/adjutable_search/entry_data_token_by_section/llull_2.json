During this first trip to Montpellier, Llull\nwould suggest that James II found a monastery in Miramar, Majorca,\nwhose main objective would be to teach languages, particularly Arabic,\nto missionaries. The project was approved and the Crown granted the\nnecessary funds to support the monastery, where 13 Franciscan brothers\nwould reside. The foundation of the monastery was confirmed by Pope\nJohn XXI in a papal bull from October 17, 1276.\n\nLlull would reach Paris at the end of 1287 and would stay there until\nthe summer of 1289. In spite of the limited information about his\nvisit to Paris, it is known that he frequently visited the\nColl\u00e8ge de Sorbonne. He established influential friendships\nwith two prominent members of the Sorbonne: Peter of Limoges and\nThomas Le My\u00e9sier, who would become his most important\ndisciple.\n\nSome references made in De vita point out that his stay in\nParis would encourage Llull to revise the structure of this\nArt, in the light of the difficulties discussed during his\npublic lectures.\n",
