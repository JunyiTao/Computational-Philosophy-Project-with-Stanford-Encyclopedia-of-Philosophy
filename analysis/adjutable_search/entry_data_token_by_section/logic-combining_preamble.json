    "main_text": "\n\nThe subject of combinations of logics is still a young topic in\ncontemporary logic. Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by\nthe possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct\noperators obey logics of different nature, as for instance erotetic\nlogics (the logical analysis of questions) which require combining\nepistemic and deontic logics, there also exist many pragmatical and\nmethodological reasons for considering combined logics. In fact, the\nuse of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer\nScience frequently requires the integration of several logic systems\ninto a homogeneous environment.\n\nImportant questions in the philosophy of logic such as: \u201cwhy are\nthere so many logics instead of just one?\u201d (or even, instead of\nnone), as for instance, raised in Epstein 1995, can be naturally\ncounterposed by several other questions: if there are indeed many\nlogics, are they excluding alternatives, or are they compatible? Is it\npossible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the\npurpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the\nproperties of complex logics? Moreover, if we can compose\nlogics, why not decompose them? And, if a logic is\ndecomposed into elementary sublogics, is it possible to recover it by\ncombining such fragments? What kind of properties of logics can be\ntransferred to their combinations? Questions of this kind have been\nonly partially tackled in the literature, and reflect challenges to be\nconfronted in the evolution of this topic.\n",
