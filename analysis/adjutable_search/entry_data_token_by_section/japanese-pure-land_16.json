    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues in Japanese Pure Land Buddhist Thought || Pure Land Buddhist Ethical Reflection\n4.4 Pure Land Buddhist Ethical Reflection\n\nThe disciples of H\u014dnen who pursued the teaching that birth in the\nPure Land became settled with a single utterance in trust explored the\nreasons this should be so and also its consequences for ongoing life\nin the present. As we have seen, H\u014dnen taught that the vocal\nnembutsu was qualitatively distinct from all other practices, being\neffective as practice because it has been fulfilled by Amida and given\nto beings. Precisely how it was given remained an issue. For disciples\nlike Sh\u014dk\u014d, the nembutsu was determined by Amida but\nretained its quality as practice in that it was to be repeated by a\nperson throughout life, even though a single utterance was taught to\nbe sufficient. Thinkers like Shinran and Sh\u014dk\u016b, however,\nboth understood the utterance of nembutsu to be fulfilled practice\nbecause it arises from the oneness of being and Buddha expressed as\nshinjin or taking refuge. Further, because of this oneness, a\nperson\u2019s attainment of birth in the Pure Land is completely\nsettled in the immediate present.\n\nThe effects of the oneness are manifested not only in the occurrence\nof birth in the Pure Land at death, but also in various ways in\npresent life. Sh\u014dk\u016b speaks of a variety of benefits received\nin the present by the person of the nembutsu, including the\nelimination of the effects of past evil acts, extension of life,\navoidance of various calamities, protection of buddhas, seeing of\nAmida, and so on. One should not pursue such benefits for their own\nsake, but they naturally come about for the person of the nembutsu\nwhose birth in the Pure Land is settled. Thus, to express the\ncondition of the nembutsu practitioner, Sh\u014dk\u016b even\ndistinguishes two types of Pure Land \u201cbirth,\u201d\n\u201cimmediate birth\u201d (sokuben \u014dj\u014d) while\nremaining burdened with afflicting passions in present life and birth\ninto the Pure Land at the time of death (t\u014dtoku\n\u014dj\u014d).\n\nSh\u014dk\u016b\u2019s thinking about ethical life reflects the same\nelements seen in relation to benefits in this life: the person\ncontinues to act out of ignorance and self-attachment, but conduct\nmanifesting oneness with Amida Buddha may also emerge spontaneously.\nHe speaks, for example, of the elimination of the effects of past evil\nacts through repentance (zange metsuzai). He distinguishes,\nhowever, between two kinds or stages of repentance, that which is\ndeliberately undertaken at particular times through ones own powers of\nself-reflection and contrition, but which is difficult to achieve\n(gy\u014dmon no zange), and that which arises spontaneously\nand immediately as the working of the vow (kanmon no zange).\nAs seen here, ethical behavior is not prescribed and undertaken as\nanother form of praxis, but Other Power may function of itself in the\nlife of the nembutsu practitioner to suppress evil and manifest\ncompassion action.\n\nSuch thinking may also be seen in Shinran, who includes, in his list\nof ten benefits obtained by the nembutsu practitioner in the present,\n\u201cconstantly enacting great compassion.\u201d In letters, he\nstates:\n\n\nThose who feel that their own birth is completely settled should,\nmindful of the Buddha\u2019s benevolence, hold the nembutsu in their\nhearts and say it to respond in gratitude to that benevolence, with\nthe wish, \u201cMay there be peace in the world, and may the\nBuddha\u2019s teaching spread!\u201d. (Shinran CWS I: 560)\n\n\nIn the face of the persecution of the nembutsu by local authorities,\nhe advises his disciples:\n\n\nThe people who are trying to obstruct the nembutsu are the manor\nlords, bailiffs, and landowners in the local areas \u2026 .\npracticers of the nembutsu should act with compassion for those who\ncommit such obstruction, feel pity for them, and earnestly say the\nnembutsu, thereby helping those who seek to hinder them. (Shinran CWS\nI: 563\u2013564)\n\n\nFor Shinran, the working of Other Power is precisely the falling away\nof one\u2019s own calculative thinking, seeking religious or worldly\nadvantage through one\u2019s own capacities. Thus, where self-power\nhas been \u201coverturned,\u201d acts spontaneously possessed of\ncompassion arise unprescribed and undeliberated.\n\nFor both Sh\u014dk\u016b and Shinran, the life of the nembutsu\npractitioner is informed by a transformed temporality. This is\nespecially clear in Shinran, who adopts the distinction of two\ndimensions or phases of Amida\u2019s activity\u2014that for\nbeings\u2019 birth in the Pure Land (\u014ds\u014d ek\u014d)\nand that for their immediate return from the Pure Land to this world\nin order to work for the liberation of all beings (gens\u014d\nek\u014d). The ethical ideal of genuinely compassionate\naction\u2014action that leads others to liberation from\nignorance\u2014exists in the present for the nembutsu practitioner as\na goal one looks forward to in the future, beyond all falsification by\nself-attachments. It is the teleological fulfillment of human\nexistence that unfolds only by Other Power. At the same time, that\ngoal, as the content of birth in the Pure Land that is already settled\nin the present, pervades present existence, interfused with the karmic\nburden of the samsaric past. What is authentically known of such a\nself by the nembutsu practitioner, according to both Sh\u014dk\u016b\nand Shinran, is the repentance that is also Amida\u2019s\nwisdom-compassion.\n",
