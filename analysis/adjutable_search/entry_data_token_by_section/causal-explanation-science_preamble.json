    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry discusses some accounts of causal explanation\ndeveloped after approximately 1990. For a discussion of earlier\naccounts of explanation including the deductive-nomological (DN)\nmodel, Wesley Salmon\u2019s statistical relevance and causal\nmechanical models, and unificationist models, see the general entry on\n scientific explanation.\n Recent accounts of non-causal explanation will be discussed in a\nseparate entry. In addition, a substantial amount of recent discussion\nof causation and causal explanation has been conducted within the\nframework of causal models. To avoid overlap with the entry on\n causal models\n we do not discuss this literature here.\n\nOur focus in this entry is on the following three accounts \u2013\nSection 1 those that focus on mechanisms and mechanistic explanations,\nSection 2 the kairetic account of explanation, and Section 3\ninterventionist accounts of causal explanation. All of these have as\ntheir target explanations of why or perhaps how some\nphenomenon occurs (in contrast to, say, explanations of what\nsomething is, which is generally taken to be non-causal) and they\nattempt to capture causal explanations that aim at such explananda.\nSection 4 then takes up some recent proposals having to do with how\ncausal explanations may differ in explanatory depth or goodness.\nSection 5 discusses some issues having to do with what is distinctive\nabout causal (as opposed to non-causal) explanations.\n\nWe also make the following preliminary observation. An account of\ncausal explanation in science may leave open the possibility that\nthere are other sorts of explanations of a non-causal variety (it is\njust that the account does not claim to capture these, at least\nwithout substantial modifications) or it may, more ambitiously, claim\nthat all explanations of the why/how variety are, at least in some\nextended sense, causal. The kairetic model makes this latter claim, as\ndo many advocates of mechanistic models. By contrast, interventionist\nmodels, need not deny that there are non-causal explanations, although\nthe version described below does not attempt to cover such\nexplanations. Finally, we are very conscious that, for reasons of\nspace, we omitted many recent discussions of causal explanation from\nthis entry. We provide brief references to a number of these at the\nend of this article (Section 6).\n",
