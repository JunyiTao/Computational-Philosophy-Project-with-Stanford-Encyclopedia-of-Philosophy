    "main_text": "Disjunctivism and the Causal Theory of Perception\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nAs we have seen, there are a variety of different disjunctivist views,\noften motivated by quite different concerns, and the disagreements\nthat these disjunctivists have with their opponents are relevant to a\nnumber of debates in the philosophy of perception and\nepistemology\u2014debates about the metaphysics and phenomenology of\nperceptual experience, our concept of perception, the epistemological\nrole of perceptual experience, and self-knowledge. Many of the\ndisjunctivist views and arguments that have been outlined here have\nbeen proposed relatively recently, and the debates they have inspired\nseem set to continue. In a further recent development disjunctive\ntheories of perception have inspired similar disjunctive approaches in\nthe philosophy of action\u2014concerning both the ontology of action\nand a subject\u2019s reasons for performing actions. (For discussion of\ndisjunctive approaches to action see Haddock and McPherson 2008b,\nRuben 2008, Hornsby 2008 and Dancy 2008.)\n",
