Preliminaries\n\nThe connectives of the formal languages of propositional logic are\ntypically expected to exhibit salient features of the\nsentence-connecting devices of natural languages, and especially such\ndevices as are regarded as items of logical vocabulary (and,\nor, not, if\u2013then,\u2026), though it\nwill be no part of our concern to inquire as to what their\n\u2018logicality\u2019 consists in. This is an issue which arises\nfor expressions and constructions such as quantifiers, the identity\npredicate, and so on, and not just for sentence connectives; for this\nissue the entry \u201cLogical Constants\u201d by John MacFarlane\n(2015) should be consulted. The formal languages concerned may be\ntaken to agree in constructing their formulas ultimately on the basis\nof the same countably infinite supply of propositional\nvariables\u2014or \u2018sentence\nletters\u2019\u2014p1,\np2,\u2026, the first three of which we write for\nconvenience as p, q, r. Where they differ\nis in respect of their stock of primitive connectives. So for example,\nwe have the language L = (L, \u2227,\n\u2192, \u00ac, \u22a5) with (set of) formulas L and\nconnectives as indicated, of arities 2, 2, 1 and 0. (We have no qualms\nin the last two cases in speaking of connectives, even when there are\nnot two or more formulas to \u2018connect\u2019. Note that 0-ary or\nnullary connectives are already formulas\u2014sometimes called\nsentential constants\u2014in their own right.) As the notation\nsuggests (with boldface capitals for algebras and the corresponding\nitalic capitals for their universes), we are thinking\u2014in the\nPolish tradition\u2014of languages as algebras, identifying the\nprimitive connectives with the fundamental operations of such\nalgebras, and in particular, as absolutely free algebras of their\nsimilarity types (in the present instance, \u27e82,2,1,0\u27e9) with\nthe pi as free generators. This allows us\nto speak in the usual fashion of the main connective of a\ngiven formula, the variables occurring in and more generally\nthe subformulas of such and such a formula, and so on,\nwithout restricting ourselves to construing the formulas as obtained\nspecifically by concatenating various symbols.\n\nAlongside this \u2018syntactic operation\u2019 sense of\nconnective\u2014explained above for the primitive\nconnectives and extended to derived connectives\npresently\u2014another use of the term is indispensable: to refer to\na connective with particular logical behaviour, as when people want to\ncompare the behaviour of intuitionistic and classical implication. In\ndue course we will see the notion of a consequence relation as one way\nof specifying such behaviour. If \u22a2 is such a relation there is a\nunique language in the above sense which is the language of \u22a2\nand we can think of this \u2018logically loaded\u2019 sense of\nconnective as applying to the ordered pair \u27e8#,\n\u22a2\u27e9; thus in the case of intuitionistic implication this\nwould be \u27e8\u2192,\n\u22a2I\u2009L\u27e9, where\n\u22a2I\u2009L is the consequence relation of\nintuitionistic logic. (In fact it would be preferable to take\nequivalence classes of such pairs under a relation of translational\nequivalence but we will make no further explicit use of these ordered\npairs or any such equivalence classes, and keep this aspect of the\ndiscussion relatively informal. Instead of saying \u201c\u27e8#,\n\u22a2\u27e9\u201d, we will say things like \u201c# as it behaves\naccording to \u22a2\u201d. It would be better still to use not\nconsequence relations\u2014or the later introduced generalized\nconsequence relations\u2014as the second coordinate of the\nrepresentatives \u27e8#, \u22a2\u27e9 but instead to insert here a\nreference to a proof system\u2014a set of sequent-to-sequent rules of\nthe kind introduced below, that is\u2014since important differences\nbetween logics fail to show up at the level which would individuate\nthem merely as consequence\n relations.[1])\n\nThe \u2018languages as algebras\u2019 perspective also allows us the\nconvenience of defining matrix evaluations (see Section\n 5)\n as just homomorphisms from the algebra of formulas to the algebra of\nthe matrix in question, of defining derived connectives and\n(sentential) contexts as term functions (formerly known as polynomial\nfunctions) and algebraic functions (now commonly called polynomial\nfunctions) respectively, and so on. This treatment would need some\nemendation were the discussion to embrace infinitary connectives,\nbranching connectives, and various other exotic devices, but there\nwill be enough to consider without touching on these.\n\nFor example, there is the issue raised by the use of the notation\nabove for the operations of L. Such a choice suggests that\n\u2227, \u2192, \u00ac will represent conjunction, implication (or the\nconditional) and negation\u2014that is, be intended to capture some\naspect of the behaviour of and, if\u2013then, and\nnot, respectively\u2014and that \u22a5 will be some kind of\nfalsity constant. (Similarly, while we are fixing notation, if we had\nwritten \u201c\u2228\u201d, \u201c\u2194\u201d, or\n\u201c\u22a4\u201d, we would be arousing expectations of\ndisjunction, equivalence\u2014or biconditionality\u2014and a truth\nconstant, respectively.) We can think of this as a matter of the\ninference patterns to be sanctioned by some proof system offered for\nL, or as a matter of how the formulas of this language are to\nbe interpreted by assigning suitable semantic values to them\n(truth-values being the simplest candidates here). We refer to the\nformer as a proof-theoretic or syntactical characterization of the\nlogic and the latter as a semantical characterization. The terminology\nis somewhat unfortunate in that a perfectly respectable view in the\nphilosophy of logic (going back at least to Gentzen) has it that the\nmeanings of items of logical vocabulary, such as the\nconnectives of current concern, for a particular reasoner, are given\nby a specification of the set of primitive rules, or a\nfavoured subset thereof, governing those items in a proof system\nrepresenting that reasoner\u2019s (perhaps idealized) inferential\n practices.[2]\n We take up some of those issues later, beginning with a reprise of\nthe semantical side of the story at the start of the following\nsection.\n\nWe need first some general preliminaries, and forgetting the intended\napplication(s) for a moment, let us define, given sets S and\nT, a pair of functions (f, g) to be a\nGalois connection between S and T when\n\u2009f: \u2118(S) \u2192\n\u2118(T) and g:\n\u2118(T)\u2192 \u2118(S), and for all\nS0, S1 \u2286 S,\nT0, T1 \u2286 T, we\nhave S0 \u2286\ng(f(S0)), T0\n\u2286 f(g(T0)),\nS0 \u2286 S1 \u21d2\nf(S1) \u2286\nf(S0), and T0\n\u2286 T1 \u21d2\ng(T1) \u2286\ng(T0). It is well known that the\ncomposition of g with f (respectively, f\nwith g) in such a case is a closure operation on\nS (respectively, on T) in the sense of being a\nfunction (we do the S case) C:\n\u2118(S) \u2192 \u2118(S) satisfying,\nfor all subsets S0, S1, of\nS:\n\nS0 \u2286 C(S0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C(S0) \u2286\nC(S0 \u222a S1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C(C(S0))\n\u2286 C(S0).\n\n\nFurther, where R \u2286 S \u00d7 T, the\ntriple \u27e8R, S, T\u27e9, which we may\ncall a binary relational connection (between S and\nT), induces a Galois connection (fR,gR)\nbetween S and T when we put, for all\nS0 \u2286 S, T0\u2286\nT:\n\n\u2009fR(S0) =\n{t \u2208 T : for all s \u2208\nS0 R(s, t)}\n\ngR(T0) = {s\n\u2208 S : for all t \u2208 T0\nR(s, t)}.\n\n\n(\u201cS\u201d and \u201cT\u201d here are\nmnemonic for \u201cSource\u201d and \u201cTarget\u201d\nrespectively; note that we do not require S \u2229 T\n= \u2205, or even that S \u2260 T.) Suppose we\nconsider, not the sentential languages of our opening paragraph but\nrather first-order languages, and take S as the set of closed\nformulas of such a language and T as the set of models\n(interpretations, structures,\u2026) for that language, then with\nR as the relation holding between a closed formula \u03c6 and\na structure M when M\n\u22a8 \u03c6,\nfR(S0) and\ngR(T0) are usually\ndenoted by Mod(S0) and\nTh(T0). (The labels are intended to\nsuggest \u201cclass of all models of\u201d and \u201ctheory\nof\u201d, respectively.) In this case the derived closure operations\nTh\u2009\u25cb\u2009Mod (mapping\nS0 to\nTh(Mod(S0))) and\nMod\u2009\u25cb\u2009Th (understood\nanalogously) on S and T respectively deliver the set\nof first-order consequences of S0 and the set of\nall models verifying all the sentences verified by every M\n\u2208 T0. When there is\nonly one such M in the latter case, what\nis delivered is the class of structures elementarily equivalent to\nM. (Here we are thinking of classical\nfirst-order model theory.)\n\nReturning to the former case: as this use of the term\n\u2018consequences\u2019 reminds us, a closure operation on the set\nof formulas of some language is conventionally called a\nconsequence operation, and perhaps to use the notation\nCn(\u22c5) rather than simply C(\u22c5), though it\nis often more convenient to talk in terms of the corresponding\nconsequence relation, holding between a set of formulas\n\u0393 and an individual formula \u03c6\u2014notated in some such way\nas \u201c\u0393 \u22a9 \u03c6\u201d, \u201c\u0393 \u22a2\n\u03c6\u201d, etc.\u2014when \u03c6 \u2208 Cn(\u0393); when\nthe relation has been defined semantically it is not uncommon to press\n\u201c\u22a8\u201d into service in this role. (This will occur once\nor twice below.) Certain shortcuts are usually taken with this\nnotation, so that one writes, for example \u201c\u0393, \u0394,\n\u03c6, \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7\u201d and \u201c\u22a2 \u03c6\u201d to\nmean \u201c\u0393 \u222a \u0394 \u222a {\u03c6,\u03c8} \u22a2\n\u03c7\u201d and \u201c\u2205 \u22a2 \u03c6\u201d, respectively.\n(For the moment, capital Greek letters range over sets of formulas.)\nThe conditions given earlier for C\u2019s being a closure\noperation can be recast as conditions definitive of a consequence\nrelation, conditions we do not give explicitly here. A consequence\nrelation \u22a2 on some language is finitary if whenever\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 then we have \u03930 \u22a2 \u03c6\nfor some finite \u03930 \u2286 \u0393; to be\nsubstitution-invariant whenever \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 then\ns(\u0393) \u22a2 s(\u03c6) where s is any\nsubstitution, i.e., any endomorphism of the algebra of formulas (and\ns(\u0393) is {s(\u03c8) | \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393});\nand, finally, to be congruential when \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8 implies \u03c7(\u03c6) \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c7(\u03c8), in which the\nnotation is to be understood as follows. \u201c\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8\u201d abbreviates \u201c\u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c8 and \u03c8\u22a2 \u03c6\u201d\n(and if we are decorating the turnstile \u201c\u22a2\u201d with\nsuperscripts or subscripts, these are written only on the \u22a2 and\nnot also on the \u22a3 part of the composite notation); \u03c7 is some\nformula constructed from propositional variables including at least\none, pk, say\u2014to indicate which we\nmay sometimes write \u03c7 =\n\u03c7(pk)\u2014and \u03c7(\u03c6), for a\nformula \u03c6, is the result of substituting \u03c6 for all occurrences\nof pk in \u03c7. (So \u03c7(\u03c6) is\ns(\u03c7) for the unique substitution s for which\ns(pi) =\npi for i \u2260 k and\ns(pk) = \u03c6.) The\n\u03c7(\u22c5) notation amounts to thinking of \u03c7 as a (sentential)\ncontext, and putting \u03c6 into this context amounts to\nproducing the formula \u03c7(\u03c6); more generally, we can think of an\nn-ary context as a formula containing n\ndistinguished propositional variables\npk1,\u2026,\npkn, say\u2014and\nperhaps additional variables\n too.[3]\n If there are no additional variables, then the formula\n\u03c7(pk1,\u2026,\npkn) can be thought\nof as a derived or composite connective of the language under\nconsideration. Returning to the 1-ary case, when \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8 we describe \u03c6 and \u03c8 as equivalent according to\n\u22a2, and, following Smiley (1962), when for all \u03c7(\u22c5), the\nformulas \u03c7(\u03c6) and \u03c7(\u03c8) are equivalent according to\n\u22a2, we describe \u03c6 and \u03c8 as synonymous (according\nto \u22a2). Thus a congruential consequence relation is one for which\nany equivalent formulas are synonymous.\n\nThe characterization of the (classical first-order) consequence\nrelation given above was semantic, in that we described it in terms of\nthe consequence operation\nTh\u2009\u25cb\u2009Mod which invokes the\nstructures for the language and what is true in them. A proof system\nfor first-order logic provides a direct syntactic account of when\n\u03c6 is a consequence of \u0393, in terms of derivability using\nrules (and perhaps axioms) sensitive only to the form of the formulas\ninvolved. We could discuss the properties of sentence connectives in\nterms of such quantified languages (in which open as well as closed\nsentences can be their arguments) but to avoid extraneous\ncomplications prefer the setting of the propositional languages with\nwhich we began. And, as in the discussion to this point, we will\ngenerally just say \u201cconnective\u201d, rather than\n\u201csentence connective\u201d.\n\nAny binary relational connection \u27e8R, S,\nT\u27e9, as above, will be said to have conjunctive\ncombinations on the left (right) if for any\ns0, s1 \u2208 S there\nexists s2 \u2208 S such that for all\nt \u2208 T, R(s2,\nt) just in case R(s0,\nt) and R(s1,\nt) (respectively, for any t0,\nt1 \u2208 T there exists\nt2 \u2208 T such that for all s\n\u2208 S, R(s, t2) just\nin case R(s, t0) and\nR(s, t1)); we call\ns2 (respectively, t2) a\nconjunctive combination of s0 and\ns1 (t0 and\nt1) in this case. Replacing the two\n\u201cand\u201ds after the words \u201cjust in case\u201d by\n\u201cor\u201d gives the notion of disjunctive combinations\non the left and right of \u27e8R,\nS, T\u27e9. Both notions admit of an obvious\ngeneralization to the case in which {s0,\ns1} is replaced by an arbitrary subset\nS0 of S, and similarly on the T\nside. We write \u220fL S0 and\n\u2211L S0 for conjunctive and\ndisjunctive combinations, respectively, in this case, and similarly on\nthe right (with an \u201cR\u201d subscript), when we know\neither that such a combination is unique or that, while not unique,\nwhat is being said would be correct however a representative\ncombination were chosen. The subscript is omitted when no confusion is\nlikely. If, as above S0 = {s0,\ns1}, instead of writing\n\u220fS0 (respectively,\n\u2211S0), we write s0 \u22c5\ns1 (respectively, s0 +\ns1), and similarly on the right. To illustrate\nthese concepts, consider the connection \u27e8R, S,\nT\u27e9 with S some non-empty set, T its\npower set, and R the relation of membership (\u2208). There\nare conjunctive combinations and disjunctive combinations on the\nright, being intersections and unions respectively, but there are in\ngeneral neither conjunctive nor disjunctive combinations on the left.\nTaking the former case, a conjunctive combination of\ns0 and s1, where these are\ndistinct elements of S, would be an element of S\nbelonging to precisely those subsets of S to which each of\ns0, s1, belongs\u2014which is\nimpossible since the unit set of this element\u2014as with any unit\nset\u2014contains only one element, and so not both of\ns0, s1. By analogy with the\nabove definitions of conjunctive and disjunctive combinations we can\nalso consider the existence of negative objects on the left and right\nof a relational connection, and note that again the set-theoretic\nexample just given presents is with negative objects on the right (for\nS0 \u2286 S, the corresponding negative\nobject is S \u2216 S0), but not on the\nleft (\u201cno negative individuals\u201d, as philosophers might put\nit, and the point would stand if we switched to the case in which\nT comprised properties\u2014rather than sets\u2014of\nindividuals, reconstruing R accordingly). This absence of\ncombinations simultaneously on the left and right of a relational\nconnection is typical of non-degenerate cases, in that one can easily\nverify that if a relational connection has conjunctive combinations on\nthe left and disjunctive combinations on the right, or vice versa,\nthen it satisfies the following (rather strong) crossover\ncondition:\n\nfor all s0, s1 \u2208\nS, all t0, t1 \u2208\nT, if R(s0,\nt0) and R(s1,\nt1), then either\nR(s0, t1) or\nR(s1, t0).\n\n\n(To see this, assume the antecedent and consider the relation\nR as it relates s0 +\ns1 and t0 \u22c5\nt1\u2014or, for the \u201cvice versa\u201d,\ns0 \u22c5 s1 and\nt0 + t1.)\n",
