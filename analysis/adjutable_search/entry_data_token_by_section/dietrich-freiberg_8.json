    "main_text": "Conceptional Being\n9. Conceptional Being\n\n\nThe tie between the intellect and the rest of Dietrich\u2019s universe is\nthus very close. This explains why the treatise on the intellect and\nthe intelligibles is of such importance in understanding his\nmetaphysics and cosmology. The identity of ens reale and\nens conceptionale is essential to the very nature of things\nas Dietrich understands them. Dietrich tells us in the De visione\nbeatifica, that the distinction between conceptional and real\nbeing is the first division of being. Furthermore, conceptional being\nincludes for Dietrich not just the objects of the intellectual act but\nthe act itself. This act is not simply a reception or a reproduction\nin some fashion of an object coming to it from outside, but is what\nmight be called semi-creative, that is, the act of the intellect is\nthe act of conceiving its object. Intellectual conception is analogous\nto the conception of offspring by living things in the sense that a\nnew reality is brought into being. Of course the intellective act is\nalso reproductive, it does establish a mirror of external reality (the\nmeaning of ens reale for Dietrich). T\u00e9treau points out\nthat ens conceptionale is really coextensive with the\nuniverse of beings because it exemplifies in itself all the modes of\nnatural being. That is, intellect exhibits the distinctions of act and\npotency, oneness and multiplicity, cause and effect and so\non. Furthermore, ens conceptionale forms a conceptional\nhierarchy of its own, a hierarchy which mirrors the greater one and at\nthe same time causes and participates in it. At the bottom of this\nconceptional order are the external senses, followed by the interior\nsenses, the discursive power, the possible intellect, and finally the\nagent intellect at the very top.\n\n\nThe procession of creatures in the order of conceptional reality moves\nthrough three modes of being (specific character, ideal form, and\nimage) culminating in beings that are specific in character, and are\nimages, but without the proper character of individuation. These are\nthe intelligences. They proceed from God as an image of God and\nconstitute the very flower of the universe. The agent intellect of\nman, Dietrich tells us, belongs to this mode of being. The various\nmodes of being within the entire hierarchy of being as well as the\nthree kinds of beings subordinate to the first being all bear a\nlikeness to God; indeed, intellect, the very apex of the universe, is\nan image of God.  But the various members of Dietrich\u2019s hierarchy of\nbeing are also bound together into a universe of beings by the\nsimilitude they bear to each other. This similitude, however, is the\nresult of the essential order of causation, according to which every\nbeing in the universe of beings is ordered to every other being either\nas cause or effect. Thus the totality of beings are bound together\nmaking up a universe where every creature bears a relation of\nsimilitude to every other creature and to the primary unifying\nprinciple from which they emanate, God.\n\n\nGod\u2019s power of emanation, which is creative, although simple in its\norigins and principle, is complex in its effects. Divine emanation\ngives rise to the vast complexity of both ens reale and\nens conceptionale. We have already seen that Dietrich viewed\nthis vast complexity as itself a likeness to God\u2014the world in\nall of its wonderful complexity revealed something of God to a mind\nwilling to inquire into it. It gives glory to God in its very\ncomplexity. Perhaps Dietrich\u2019s metaphysical vision of the universe\nexplains his keen interest in science, an interest that led him to\nwrite treatises summing up his research into light and color and into\nthe material elements of the universe. All these things revealed\nsomething of the first cause to him. There was no chasm between his\nmetaphysics and his science. The link between the two is perhaps\ndiscovered in his theory of mind. For it is mind that is most like\nGod. And thus, just as God as first cause is the source of a creative\nemanation so is the intellect.\n\n\nIntellect gives rise to an order of emanation that is just as vast as\nthat of the creative emanation of God in the order of real beings.  In\nfact intellect mirrors this order perfectly. It is itself identified\nwith the universe of beings. Furthermore, it is like God\u2019s creativity\nin that it does not depend upon a pre-existing material substratum\nfrom which ideas are formed by abstraction. But it does depend upon\nGod having made it the kind of being that in the order of\nunderstanding, the ens conceptionale, is able to\n\u201cconceive\u201d being. For no other being except God can do\nthis.\n",
