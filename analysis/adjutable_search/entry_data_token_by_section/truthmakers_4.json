    "main_text": "What is a Truth-maker? || Axiomatic Truth-making\n1.5 Axiomatic Truth-making\n\nThe difficulties that have beset the definitions of truth-making\nproffered so far have suggested to some philosophers that a\npessimistic induction is in order: that the project of defining\ntruth-making in more basic terms is misconceived, much as the project\nof defining knowledge in more basic terms has come to seem\nmisconceived because e.g., of the Gettier cases. But there\u2019s no\ngain to be had from, doing nothing more than declaring the notion of a\ntruth-maker to be primitive. If it\u2019s primitive then we also need\nto know how the notion may be fruitfully applied in association with\nother concepts we already deploy\u2014entailment, existence, truth\netc.\u2014to describe the interplay of truth-bearers and the\nworld. As Simons remarks, \n\n\nThe signs are that truth-making is not analysable in terms of anything\nmore primitive, but we need to be able to say more than just that. So\nwe ought to consider it as specified by principles of truth-making.\n(2000: 20) \n\n\nIn other words, the notion needs to be introduced non-reductively but\nstill informatively and this is to be achieved by appealing to its\nsystematic liaisons with other concepts.\n\nThis is the approach that was originally shared by Mulligan, Simons\nand Smith (1984: 312\u20138). The principal schemata they employed to\nconvey to us an articulate grasp of what truth-making means\nin non-reductive terms included:\n\n(i)\n(Factive) If A makes it true that p, then\np\n(ii)\n(Existence) If A exists, then A makes it true\nthat A exists\n(iii)\n (Entailment) If A makes it true that p, and\nthat p entails that q, then A makes it true\nthat q\n\n\nEach of these schemata specifies a definite linkage between the\napplication of the notion of truth-making and some other\ncondition. Truth-making is introduced as the notion that\nsustains all of these linkages. Putting the schemata together what it\nis to be a truth-maker is then definable intra-theoretically as\nfollows,\n\n(Axiomatic-T) \nA truth-maker is something x such that (i) if x\nmakes it true that p then p, (ii) if x\nexists then x makes it true that x exists\u2026\nand so on for each of the axiom schemata of our favoured theory of\ntruth-makers.\n\n\nIt is important to appreciate that adopting this approach to\ntruth-making doesn\u2019t have the benefits of theft over honest\ntoil. For one thing it doesn\u2019t obviate the threat of superfluous\ntruth-makers for necessary truths. (Entailment) is the\nprinciple that truth-making tracks entailment: if A makes\np true then it makes all the consequences of p true\ntoo. It\u2019s a principle that recommends itself irrespective of\nwhether truth-making can be defined. This is because it dovetails\nsmoothly with the idea that one truth-maker can make many truths true.\nFor example, suppose that a particular a has some absolutely\ndeterminate mass. It is entailed by this description that various\ndeterminable descriptions are also truly predicable of a.\nSome of these truths say more than others, nonetheless they all have\nthe same truth-maker. Why so? Because they are entailed by\na\u2019s having the mass it does (Armstrong 1997: 130; 2004:\n10\u201311). To answer so is to appeal to (Entailment). But\nif the entailment that truth-making tracks is classical then we are\nback to flouting (Relevance). If q is necessary then\nany contingent p classically entails q. So if\nsomething at the back of your refrigerator makes it true that\np then by (Entailment) it makes q true too.\nTo avoid flouting (Relevance) in this way\n(Entailment) had better be a principle that links\ntruth-making to a more restrictive, non-classical notion of entailment\n(Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 316). So we won\u2019t be saved\nthe logical labour of figuring out which non-classical connective it\nis that contributes to capturing what it is to be a truth-maker. Nor\nwill appealing to (Axiomatic-T) save us the hard work of\nfiguring out what truth-makers and truth-bearers must be like in order\nto collectively realise the structure described by the axiom schemata\nfor truth-makers we favour. But there is nothing about these schemata\nthat demands truth-bearer and truth-maker be internally related.\n\nIt is striking that the Axiomatic approach to truth-making has proved\nless popular in the recent literature than other more\nmetaphysically-loaded conceptions, in terms of necessitation, essence\nor grounding. A principal attraction of the approach is its\nmetaphysical neutrality. By contrast, in more recent debate,\nphilosophers have preferred approaches which rely upon a distinctive\nmetaphysical vision.\n",
