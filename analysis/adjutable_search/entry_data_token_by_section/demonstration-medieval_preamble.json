    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the theory of demonstration, developing the theory\nfound in Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, was considered the\nculmination of logic, bringing all the other parts of the discipline\nto bear on the task of developing scientific knowledge.  Elaborated\nlargely in commentaries and discussions of the Posterior\nAnalytics itself, but also sometimes in independent opuscula on\nspecific problems, or in discussions of the knowledge of God in\ncommentaries to the prologue of the Sentences, this body of\nphilosophical literature corresponds to modern Philosophy of\nScience. In particular, the problems how we come to know causal laws,\nhow scientific knowledge differs from other sorts of cognition, how\nmathematical knowledge differs from other sorts of scientific\nknowledge, and why mathematical knowledge is more certain, are\nexplored in this literature. Although the discussion followed\nAristotle's views closely, each interpreter read his views in a way\nthat would square them with his own metaphysical system, so that the\nmost important Aristotelian writers of the thirteenth century, Albert\nthe Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, revised the initial,\nAugustinian, reading of Robert Grosseteste's commentary. Aristotle\nhimself was obscure on a number of points, and so radical Aristotelian\nauthors fell into disputes among themselves over the exact character\nof the \u201chighest sort of demonstration\u201d (demonstratio\npotissima), and the nature of the scientific knowledge resulting\nfrom it. These disputes were rooted in part in earlier disputes among\nthe Arabic commentators, as reported in Averroes's\ncommentaries. Ockham and his followers developed yet another reading\nof the science of demonstrations to fit their nominalist\nmetaphysics in the fourteenth century, and in the later Middle Ages\ntheir views and those of Aquinas dominated the scene. In later\nTerminist commentaries, such as that of Antony Coronel in 1510, it is\nassumed that scientific knowledge is a natural form caused in the mind\nby knowledge of the premisses of a demonstration, and it is treated as\na subject of puzzles concerning beginning and ceasing, and the like,\ntypical of the sophismata discussed in that school. In the sixteenth\ncentury other controversies moved to the fore, over the application of\nthe \u201cScience of Demonstration\u201d to mathematics, and\nconcerning the manner of discovery of a demonstration through\n\u201canalysis and synthesis.\u201d In the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, with the new Platonisms, the anti-Aristotelian\nbias of the new science, and developing empiricism, the theory of\ndemonstration came to be ignored in mainstream philosophy, although it\npersists as an element of Thomism. Moreover, though the theory\ndisappeared, much of the new Empiricist viewpoint in fact carries over\nfrom the Ockhamist version of it.\n",
