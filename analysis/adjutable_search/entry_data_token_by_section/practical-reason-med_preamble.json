    "main_text": "\n\nMedieval theories of moral reasoning have their origins in the moral\ntheology of St. Augustine and the rational ethics of Aristotle. Until\nthe thirteenth century Augustine\u2019s responses to questions\nconcerning free will, predestination, the nature of goodness, and\ndivine freedom dominated moral speculation in the Latin West. For\nAugustine morality demands the human will\u2019s conformity to the\nprescriptions of the immutable, necessary and eternal law. Augustine\nargues in his work on free will that the eternal law \u201cis called\nsupreme reason, which must always be obeyed, and through it the evil\ndeserve an unhappy life and the good a blessed life; and through this\nlaw we have derived temporal laws rightly constructed and correctly\nemended.\u201d The ideals of eternal law are universally imprinted\nupon human intellects and are the immutable standards by which human\nactions may be judged.\n\nThe earliest medieval commentators on the Nicomachean Ethics analyzed\nonly the first three books of the work for reasons yet unexplained\n(Celano, 2022). The medieval authors of the first half of the 13th\ncentury, while aware of the existence of the remaining books of the\nNicomachean Ethics generally had only the partial text at their\ndisposal. Aristotle\u2019s discussion of phronesis was mostly unknown\nuntil Robert Grosseteste\u2019s complete translation of\nAristotle\u2019s text and the accompanying Greek commentaries\nappeared about 1248. During this period theologians such as Philip the\nChancellor and William of Auxerre examined the nature of the moral act\nin their theological Summas. Like many medieval authors, William of\nAuxerre considered the Aristotelian virtue of phronesis\n(prudentia) to have both an intellectual component as a type of\nknowledge as well as a moral function in its ability to prescribe\nproper actions. Both William of Auxerre and Philip the Chancellor were\ninstrumental in introducing into moral theory the concept of\nsynderesis which they viewed as an innate human ability to recognize\nthe eternal first principles of moral reasoning. Rather than leave the\nguiding principles of human actions to human experience they anchored\nmoral decisions in the eternal law of God. Synderesis displays a\nuniversal code of correct actions to the moral agent (Eardley, 2021).\nAlthough their interpretation was decidedly un-Aristotelian it did\ninfluence the conclusions of later commentators, such as Albert the\nGreat and Thomas Aquinas. After the appearance of Grosseteste\u2019s\ntranslation Albert the Great composed the first Latin medieval\ncommentary on the entire text of the Nicomachean Ethics. His\ntreatment of the prudence as a virtue with both intellectual and moral\ncomponents, his acceptance of universal moral principles in the\nnatural law, and his understanding of practical reason and its\nrelation to human happiness had a profound effect upon the writings of\nhis student, Thomas Aquinas.\n",
