    "main_text": "The Nature of Envy || Defining Envy\n1.1 Defining Envy\n\nThis entry follows the widespread assumption that envy is an\n emotion.[1]\n That is not to say that it is a mere feeling. Emotions are generally\nagreed to be more than feelings. Most emotion theorists could agree on\nthis vague characterization: emotions are syndromes of thoughts,\nfeelings, motivations, and bodily movements, loosely enough bound\ntogether that a given emotional episode may not require the occurrence\nof every element in the syndrome. Most theories of emotion privilege\none of these elements as central, or even essential, to emotion.\nCognitive theories identify a defining thought or judgment. Feeling\ntheories and Motivational theories respectively take a particular\naffective experience or a distinctive motivational role as central or\nessential to a given emotion type.\n\nThe specific contours of the emotional syndrome of envy are\ncontroversial. It is agreed that envy involves an envier\n(\u201cSubject\u201d), a party who is envied\n(\u201cRival\u201d)\u2014this may be a person or group of\npersons\u2014and some possession, capacity or trait that the subject\nsupposes the rival to have (the \u201cgood\u201d). The good might be\nsomething that only one party could possibly possess (the crown\njewels, or being the world\u2019s best go player), or it might be something\neasily duplicated. It is sometimes held that the good may even be\nutility, happiness, or some psychological state that Subject could\nattribute to Rival even if there were no material difference in their\npossessions or capacities. Most philosophers who have sought to define\nenvy agree in treating it as a form of distress experienced by the\nsubject because he does not possess the good and the rival does, and\nin attributing a desire for the good to Subject. Many, but not all, go\non to add that envy involves a desire that the rival not have the\ngood. This disagreement is explored below, [see benign and invidious\nenvy]. Envy is widely but not universally agreed to be a symptom or\ninstance of the human tendency to evaluate one\u2019s well-being\ncomparatively, by assessing how well one is doing in comparison with\nothers. Influential definitions of envy include:\n\n\nEnvy is pain at the good fortune of others. (Aristotle,\nRhetoric, Bk II, Chapter 10) \n\nEnvy is a propensity to view the well-being of others with distress,\neven though it does not detract from one\u2019s own. [It is] a reluctance\nto see our own well-being overshadowed by another\u2019s because the\nstandard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth\nof our own well-being but how it compares with that of others. [Envy]\naims, at least in terms of one\u2019s wishes, at destroying others\u2019 good\nfortune. (Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals 6:459)\n\nEnvy is that passion which views with malignant dislike the\nsuperiority of those who are really entitled to all the superiority\nthey possess. (Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, p.\n244)\n\n",
