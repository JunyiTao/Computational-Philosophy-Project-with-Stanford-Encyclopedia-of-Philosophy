    "main_text": "Perfectly natural properties and relations\n3. Perfectly natural properties and relations\n\nRemember that laying out the foundations of one\u2019s ontology\nrequires two things: to say what, fundamentally, there is;\nand to say what it is like, presumably by stating some\nfacts about the fundamental entities. But not just any facts\nmatter. For example, it may be true of some of the fundamental\nentities that they coexist with at least one pig; but saying so does\nnothing to help articulate the fundamental structure of\nreality. To do that, Lewis thinks, one needs a distinction\namong the properties and relations: some are special, in that it is\ntheir pattern of instantiation among the fundamental entities\nthat constitutes the fundamental structure of reality\u2014the\n\u201cjoints\u201d along which nature is to be ultimately carved.\nThese special properties and relations are the \u201cperfectly\nnatural\u201d ones.\n\n(There are a variety of other uses to which Lewis puts the notion of\n\u201cnatural\u201d properties, some of which show that what he\nneeds is a distinction that admits of gradations, with the\nperfectly natural properties at one extreme. See the\n\nSupplement on\n The Natural/Non-natural Distinction\n\n\nfor an overview.)\n\nIt is not enough merely to appeal to such a distinction; for\nmetaphysics to do its job properly, it must also provide an\naccount. Now, one way to proceed would be to provide a theory\nof what properties and relations are, in which it is stipulated that\nall such things are to count as \u201cperfectly natural\u201d. On\nsuch an approach, while there may well be a property corresponding to\nthe predicate \u201chas mass 5 kg\u201d (for example), there will\nalmost certainly be no property corresponding to the predicate\n\u201cis green\u201d (let alone that familiar gerrymander, \u201cis\ngrue\u201d). Lewis favors a different approach. Given his commitment\nto set theory, he already believes in things that, by his\nlights, deserve to be called the property of being green, and indeed\nthe property of being grue: these are merely certain\nsets\u2014sets of actual and possible objects. (See the\nsection on Lewis\u2019s modal metaphysics in the entry on\n David Lewis,\n and the supplement on\n The Natural/Non-natural Distinction.)\n The question for him, then, is how to distinguish among\nthese sets those that are perfectly natural. Here I will present\nAlmost-Lewis as being, almost like Lewis, agnostic as between four\nbroad alternatives. (Almost, because Lewis eventually decided that the\nfirst alternative, according to which natural properties and relations\nare Aristotelian universals, is unworkable; see his 1986f for the\nreasons.)\n\nOne could adopt a theory of universals of the kind\ndeveloped by David Armstrong (1978a,1978b): \u201c\u2026we could\ncall a property [viz., set of actual and possible objects]\nperfectly natural if its members are all and only those\nthings that share some one universal.\u201d (1999 p. 13)\nOne could treat \u201cnatural\u201d as a primitive\npredicate of sets of actual and possible objects: \u201c\u2026a\nNominalist could take it as a primitive fact that some classes of\nthings are perfectly natural properties; others are\nless-than-perfectly natural to various degrees; and most are not at\nall natural. Such a Nominalist uses \u2018natural\u2019 as a\nprimitive predicate, and offers no analysis of what he means in\npredicating it of classes.\u201d (1999, p.\n 14)[2]\nOne could define \u201cnatural\u201d in terms of a suitably\ncomplex, and primitive, notion of resemblance:\n\u201cAlternatively, a Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer\nto rest with primitive objective resemblance among things.\n\u2026Then he could undertake to define natural properties in terms\nof the mutual resemblance of their members and the failure of\nresemblance between their members and their non-members.\u201d (1999,\np. 14)\nOne could adopt an ontology of tropes\u2014roughly,\nproperty-instances, entities that occupy a sort of ontological halfway\nhouse between particulars and properties. (See Lewis 1986f, Williams\n1953, Campbell 1990.)\n\n\nReturning now to Almost-Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology, the options\nseem to be these: It might be that a spacetime point (or sequence of\npoints) instantiates a perfectly natural property (respectively,\nrelation) by instantiating a universal, in the sense of Armstrong. It\nmight be that it has it by having as one part a certain kind of trope,\nin roughly the sense of Williams. (Whence we must amend slightly, and\ntake these tropes to be the fundamental entities.) It might\nbe that it has it by belonging to a special sort of set of (actual and\nmerely possible) spacetime points\u2014special either on account of\nthe resemblances that unite its members and distinguish them from\nnon-members, or on account of simply being perfectly natural.\nRegardless of which one chooses, Lewis thinks, one\u2019s theory of\nnatural properties and relations ought to respect four\nphilosophically-motivated constraints:\n\nFirst, an adequate theory should be minimal, in the sense\nthat it posits just enough perfectly natural properties and relations\nfor their distribution among the fundamental particulars to fully and\ndeterminately fix the nature of all of reality: \u201cThe guiding\nidea, roughly, is that the world\u2019s universals should comprise a\nminimal basis for characterizing the world completely. Universals that\ndo not contribute at all to this end are unwelcome, and so are\nuniversals that contribute only redundantly.\u201d (1999, p. 12) It\nis clear from the surrounding text that Lewis takes this constraint to\ngovern the various alternatives to a universals account of\n naturalness.[3]\n\nSecond, perfectly natural properties and relations are, Lewis thinks,\nnon-modal. What, exactly, this means will need to come in for\nmore discussion. For the moment, we can take it to\nmean roughly this (though trouble for this characterization quickly\narises): the instantiation of a perfectly natural property by one\n(fundamental) particular, or of a relation by several, places\nabsolutely no constraints of a logical or metaphysical kind on the\ninstantiation of any other perfectly natural property or relation by\nthat or any other particular or particulars.\n\nThird, they are intrinsic to the particulars that instantiate\nthem\u2014which, all too roughly, means that they characterize what\nthose particulars are like, independently of what any other distinct\nparticular is like. More: The intrinsic nature of any particular is\nexhausted by what perfectly natural properties it\n instantiates.[4]\n This assumption also allows a theory of natural properties and\nrelations to yield, in a fairly simple way, a definition of\n\u201cperfect duplicate\u201d applicable to any possible objects\nx and y (not necessarily inhabiting the same\npossible world): x and y are perfect duplicates iff\nthey share exactly the same perfectly natural\n properties.[5]\n A definition of \u201cintrinsic\u201d follows: a property\nP is intrinsic iff any two duplicates x and\ny (taken from any possible worlds) either both have\nP or both fail to have P. Of course, what we really\nhave here is a tight circle that puts on display how the expressions\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d, \u201cperfect duplicate\u201d, and\n\u201cperfectly natural\u201d can be interdefined, with the help of\nthe modal notion of metaphysical possibility. (See Lewis 1983c and\nLangton & Lewis 1998 for discussion of various strategies for\nbreaking out of this circle.)\n\nThe fourth constraint is purely negative: it is that it should be left\nto the empirical sciences to fill in the details about which\nperfectly natural monadic properties there are (at least, in\nactuality: philosophy might teach us, or at least give us\nsome reason to believe, that there are, in other possible worlds,\nso-called \u201calien\u201d properties, perfectly natural properties\nnot instantiated in the actual world). Not just any empirical science\nwill do: given, in particular, the first of the four theses, it is\nreally the job of fundamental physics to fill in these details. The\nspecial sciences get no say.\n\nWhat about perfectly natural relations? Here matters are less clear.\nLewis certainly thinks that spatiotemporal relations are perfectly\nnatural; what is less obvious is whether, by his lights, physics could\nrationally lead us to reject this claim. For now I will\nsimplify, and have Almost-Lewis add a fifth\nconstraint\u2014one that is in tension at least with the spirit of\nthe fourth, and that the real Lewis certainly rejects. It is this: not\nonly are spatiotemporal relations perfectly natural, they are the\nonly perfectly natural relations. (The only possible\nones\u2014though remember that given Lewis\u2019s reductionism about\nmodality, that is an idle addition.)\n\nThe picture that emerges is this: Reality consists of a multitude of\nspacetime points. Each of these stands in spatiotemporal relations to\nsome others (though not to all others). Each instantiates various\nperfectly natural, non-modal monadic properties. That is all there is;\nanything putatively \u201cextra\u201d\u2014facts about laws of\nnature, or about persisting macro-objects, or about causation, or\nabout mentality, or about ethics, or about sets, etc.\u2014must\nsomehow reduce to that stuff. For Almost-Lewis, this picture captures\na fundamental truth about the nature of existence. It is roughly right\nthat it is also a necessary truth\u2014a status that would\nseem to fall out automatically, given Lewis\u2019s reductionist account\nof modality. The only unfinished philosophical business is to\nwork out the right theory of natural properties and relations, and to\nwork out the details of the reduction for particular cases.\n",
