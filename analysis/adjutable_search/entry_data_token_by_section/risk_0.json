Defining risk\n\nIn non-technical contexts, the word \u201crisk\u201d refers, often\nrather vaguely, to situations in which it is possible but not certain\nthat some undesirable event will occur. In technical contexts, the\nword has several more specialized uses and meanings. Five of these are\nparticularly important since they are widely used across\ndisciplines:\n\nrisk = an unwanted event that may or may not occur.\n\n\nAn example of this usage is: \u201cLung cancer is one of the major\nrisks that affect smokers.\u201d \n\nrisk = the cause of an unwanted event that may or may not\noccur.\n\n\nAn example of this usage is: \u201cSmoking is by far the most\nimportant health risk in industrialized countries.\u201d (The\nunwanted event implicitly referred to here is a disease caused by\nsmoking.) Both (1) and (2) are qualitative senses of risk. The word\nalso has quantitative senses, of which the following is the oldest\none:\n\nrisk = the probability of an unwanted event that may or\nmay not occur.\n\n\nThis usage is exemplified by the following statement: \u201cThe risk\nthat a smoker\u2019s life is shortened by a smoking-related disease\nis about 50%.\u201d \n\nrisk = the statistical expectation value of an unwanted\nevent that may or may not occur.\n\n\nThe expectation value of a possible negative event is the product of\nits probability and some measure of its severity. It is common to use\nthe number of killed persons as a measure of the severity of an\naccident. With this measure of severity, the \u201crisk\u201d (in\nsense 4) associated with a potential accident is equal to the\nstatistically expected number of deaths. Other measures of severity\ngive rise to other measures of risk.\n\nAlthough expectation values have been calculated since the\n17th century, the use of the term \u201crisk\u201d in\nthis sense is relatively new. It was introduced into risk analysis in\nthe influential Reactor Safety Study, WASH-1400 (Rasmussen et al.,\n1975, Rechard 1999). Today it is the standard technical meaning of the\nterm \u201crisk\u201d in many disciplines. It is regarded by some\nrisk analysts as the only correct usage of the term.\n\nrisk = the fact that a decision is made under conditions of\nknown probabilities (\u201cdecision under risk\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cdecision under uncertainty\u201d)\n\n\nIn addition to these five common meanings of \u201crisk\u201d there\nare several other more technical meanings, which are well-established\nin specialized fields of inquiry. Some of the major definitions of\nrisk that are used in economic analysis will be introduced below in\nsection 7.1.\n\nAlthough most of the above-mentioned meanings of \u201crisk\u201d\nhave been referred to by philosophers, a large part of the\nphilosophical literature on risk refers to risk in the more informal\nsense that was mentioned at the beginning of this section, namely as a\nstate of affairs in which an undesirable event may or may not occur.\nSeveral philosophers have criticized the technical definitions of risk\nfor being too limited and not covering all aspects that should be\nincluded in risk assessments (Buchak 2014; Pritchard 2015;\nShrader-Frechette 1991). Linguistic evidence indicates that technical\ndefinitions of risk have had virtually no impact on the non-technical\nusage of the word (Boholm et al. 2016).\n\nTerminological note: Some philosophers distinguish between\n\u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d probabilities.\nOthers reserve the term \u201cprobability\u201d for the subjective\nnotion. Here, the former terminology is used, i.e.\n\u201cprobability\u201d can refer either to subjective probability\nor to objective chances.\n",
