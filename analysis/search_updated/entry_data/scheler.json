    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nMax Scheler was born on August 22, 1874. He was raised in a\nwell-respected orthodox Jewish family in Munich. Although he was not a\nparticularly strong student, Scheler did show early promise and\ninterest in philosophy, particularly in the works of Friedrich\nNietzsche. As a youth, he identified himself as a social democrat and\nenthusiastic Marxist. In the fall of 1894, Scheler started his\nuniversity studies in Munich, but by the fall of 1895 had enrolled in\nBerlin. Although he had applied to study medicine in Berlin, he\nstudied primarily philosophy and sociology, attending most notably the\nlectures of Wilhelm Dilthey and Georg Simmel.\n\nFrom Berlin, Scheler moved to Jena in 1896 to finish his studies under\nthe guidance of Rudolf Eucken. Rudolf Eucken was a tremendously\npopular philosopher at the time, winning the Nobel Prize for\nliterature in 1908, but it was Eucken\u2019s ideas regarding the\ninner quest for a spiritual life of every human being that primarily\ndrew Scheler\u2019s attention. It was in Jena that Scheler completed\nboth his dissertation and habilitation, and where he began his career\nin philosophy. It was also during his time in Jena that he took a trip\nto Heidelberg in 1898 and met Max Weber, who also had a significant\nimpact on his thought.\n\nWhile holding his position as Privatdozent in Jena, Scheler met Edmund\nHusserl at a party in 1901 and then, a year later, read\nHusserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. The remainder of his\nlife would be dedicated to the development and the progress of\nphenomenology. During this time, Scheler was also reading much of\nFrench philosophy and was a major factor in introducing Henri\nBergson\u2019s work to Germany\u2019s intellectual circles.\n\nIn 1906, Scheler moved his family to Munich and started his position\nthere as Privatdozent. With Theodor Lipps, Scheler established a\ncircle of the \u201cMunich Phenomenologists.\u201d The early group\nconsisted of Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Moritz Geiger and Theodor Conrad,\nall of whom were students of Lipps. Dietrich von Hildebrand, Hedwig\nMartius, Herbert Leyendecker and Maximillian Beck later joined the\ngroup.\n\nDue to controversies surrounding the separation from his first wife\nand reported affairs with students, Scheler lost his teaching\nprivileges. From 1910 to 1919, he would have to earn a living as a\nprivate scholar, lecturer and freelance writer. Despite the economic\nhardships brought about by the loss of his position in Munich, these\nyears were some of Scheler\u2019s most productive: he published major\nworks such as Phenomenology and Theory of the Feeling of Sympathy\nand of Love and Hate (1913), Formalism in Ethics and\nNon-Formal Ethics of Value (Part 1 1913, Part 2 1916), The\nGenius of War and the German War (1915).\n\nA major contributing factor to Scheler\u2019s productivity at this\ntime was his introduction to the G\u00f6ttingen circle of\nphenomenology. Along with the great master, Husserl, this circle\nincluded such young and promising thinkers as Adolf Reinach, Hedwig\nMartius, Roman Ingarden, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 and Edith Stein. He\nmet and later joined the circle after the invitation in 1912 to give\nprivate lectures in G\u00f6ttingen. Because Scheler was forbidden to\nteach at a German university his lectures would often have to be held\nin hotel rooms rented by his close friend Dietrich von Hildebrand. It\nwas also at this time that Scheler became co-editor, along with\nHusserl, Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Moritz Geiger and Adolf Reinach, of\nthe greatly influential journal, Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und\nph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung.\n\nAfter years of struggling to make ends meet as a private lecturer and\nfreelance writer, Scheler received an invitation in 1918 from Konrad\nAdenaur to join the faculty of the newly founded research institute\nfor the social sciences in Cologne. The intent was to have Scheler\nserve as the Catholic thinker for the institute. Scheler, officially\njoining the faculty in 1919, was once again allowed to teach at a\nGerman university. During his time in Cologne, he wrote his major work\non religion, On the Eternal in Man (1921).\n\nThe circle of influence continued to grow for Scheler. During his time\nin Berlin and in Cologne, Scheler would meet and correspond regularly\nwith prominent, German intellectuals such as Max Brod, Franz Werfel,\nMartin Buber, Arnold Zweig, Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Sombart, Albert\nEinstein, Alfred Kerr, Walter Rathenau, Paul Tillich, Romano Guardini\nand Ernst Bloch. His circle of collaboration and discussion was not\nlimited to philosophy. Scheler corresponded with the leading\npsychologists and natural scientists such as Wertheimer, K\u00f6hler,\nBuytendijk, and Wasserman. Musicians, poets and literary scholars such\nas Eduard Erdmann, Otto Klemperer, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Rainer Maria\nRilke, Romain Rolland, Ernst Robert Curtius were also part of his\ncircle of influence. A very close friend of Scheler\u2019s in Cologne\nup until his death was the painter Otto Dix.\n\nThis diverse array of friends and collaborators is reflected in both\nthe diversity and originality of Scheler\u2019s thought at this time.\nFor example, Scheler\u2019s work, Die Wissenformen und die\nGesellschaft (The Forms of Knowledge and Society), was\nresponsible for the promulgation of a new field of study, the\nsociology of knowledge, and was one of the first works in Germany that\nprovided an in depth analysis of American pragmatism. As was common\nfor Scheler, he wrote many different manuscripts at once. While\nwriting on the sociology of knowledge, he was working on his\nphilosophical anthropology (Die Sonderstellung des Menschen\nand the manuscripts compiled in Gesammelte Werke 12),\nmetaphysics (Idealismus und Realismus and manuscripts\ncompiled in Gesammelte Werke 11), politics (Politik und\nMoral, Die Idee des Ewigen Friedens) and history\n(Der Mensch im Weltalter des Ausgleichs). During this time,\nScheler lectured extensively throughout Germany, focusing much of his\neffort to confront the rise of fascism in Germany and Europe.\n\nOnce again, Scheler\u2019s personal life (the divorce from his second\nwife and marriage to his third) conflicted with his position at the\nuniversity as the Catholic philosopher. The restrictions Scheler felt\nwere not merely personal, but also intellectual. Disappointed by the\nCatholic Church\u2019s conservatism and political failures in the\nreconstructive efforts after the war, Scheler became increasingly\ncritical of religious institutions and dogmas. He made considerable\neffort to distance himself from the Catholic Church and characterize\nhis work as philosophical, not religious, in nature. With the growing\ntensions at Cologne, Scheler welcomed the offer of a professorial\nposition in Frankfurt in 1927 and was eager to work with the Critical\nTheorists in Frankfurt such as Max Horkeimer and the young Theodor\nAdorno. During the spring of 1928, Scheler\u2019s health continued to\nworsen and he suffered from a series of heart attacks most likely due\nto the 60\u201380 cigarettes he smoked each day. His deteriorating\nhealth forced him to cancel his extensive travel plans abroad, and on\nMay 19, 1928 Scheler died in a hospital in Frankfurt from\ncomplications of a severe heart attack.\n2. The Meaning of Philosophy and Phenomenology\n\nAt the end of his life, Scheler wrote that the central issue in his\nthought and writing was the question regarding the meaning of the\nhuman being (GW IX, 9). This question not only guided his ever\nexpanding philosophical endeavors, but also defined his approach and\nunderstanding of philosophy. Like many of the Lebensphilosophen\n(philosophers of life) who had influenced him, Scheler strove to save\nphilosophy and thought from the reductive mindset of the positive\nsciences and to a degree, American pragmatism, a mindset that defined\nthe human being as mere homo faber (tool-maker). The human\nbeing is without a doubt a practical being, seeking to master and\nmanipulate his or her environment to achieve desired results and avoid\nfuture suffering. For Scheler, practical knowledge and practical\nconsciousness are genetically the first form of knowledge for the\nindividual. Yet, human beings are not necessarily tied to practical\naffairs and have the ability to comprehend and regard the world in\nterms of its essence or being. Philosophy, for Scheler, is the\n\u201cloving act of participation by the core of the human being\nin the essence of all things\u201d (GW V, 68). Practical\nknowledge is only the first of three types of knowledge. In addition\nto practical or mastery knowledge, Scheler describes two other types,\nerudition (Bildungswissen) and knowledge of revelation. All\nthree types have their own integrity and are irreducible to one\nanother. Each knowledge types thus has its own origin and is motivated\nby a different feeling. While practical knowledge is motivated by\nphysical pain or fear of error, erudition is motivated by wonder and\nknowledge of revelation by awe. Philosophical knowledge belongs to the\ntype, erudition.\n\nWonder is a loving concern for the world as it is in itself and marks\nthe transition from the practical to the philosophical (GW VIII, 208).\nThis \u201cloving participation\u201d of philosophy is, however,\ndistinct from the classical notion of love (eros) as a lack. Love is\nunderstood by Scheler here in terms of the Christian sense of\nagape, loving as giving. The human being as a loving,\nphilosophical being is not motivated to know by a sense of a lack, as\nis the case with eros, but is rather motivated by the abundance and\nsurfeit of the meaning of the world (GW VI, 84). Modernity\u2019s\nethos of control and domination has transformed the world into a mere\nobject of utility. As a means to reawaken a sense of wonder, Scheler\ncalled for a rehabilitation of virtue, in particular the virtues of\nhumility and reverence (GW III, 15). The philosopher lives in\nreverence of the world, in astonishment of the world\u2019s\ninexhaustible depth and secrets (GW III, 26).\n\nPhilosophical thought attends to the core meaning of knowledge as a\nSeinsverh\u00e4ltnis, an ontological relation. Knowledge,\naccording to Scheler, is a relation between beings, a relation wherein\na being \u2018participates\u2019 in what another being is in itself\n(GW VIII, 203). Scheler rejects the idea that knowledge is a an act of\nconstruction, as was the case for the neo-Kantians such as Ernst\nCassirer. Rather knowledge is a form of discovery, a discovery that\nrequires a humble divesting of oneself that opens one up to the other\n(GW VIII, 204) and presupposes the loving willingness to be open to\nthat which is other.\n\nFollowing Augustine, Scheler takes the emotional and affective life as\nfoundational for any form of knowledge (GW VI, 87). Before the world\nis known, it is first given. Love is that which opens the human being\nup to the world, to that which is other. This openness demonstrates\nthat there is a moral precondition for knowledge. Knowledge is\npossible only for a loving being (GW V, 83). This love is the movement\nof transcendence, a going beyond oneself, an opening to ever richer\nmeaning. Love is always already directed to the infinite, to absolute\nvalue and being (GW V, 90). With this understanding of the relation of\nlove to knowledge, Scheler declares that \u201cknowledge is\nultimately from the divine and for the divine\u201d (GW VIII,\n211).\n\nIt was not until he read Husserl\u2019s Logical\nInvestigations and learned of the idea of phenomenology, however,\nthat Scheler came upon a style of thinking that best captured for him\nthe loving disposition of philosophy. Although he was greatly indebted\nto Husserl\u2019s genius and originality, Scheler was often critical\nof Husserl when describing the nature of phenomenology. For Scheler,\nphenomenology is unequivocally not a method, but an attitude (GW X,\n380). Grasping the meaning or essence of an object has meant, since\nPlato, a type of disengagement from or suspension of an object\u2019s\nimmediate and present existence. The intent of this disengagement is\nnot to abstract from an object of cognition as it exists, but rather\nto look at the object as it is itself. The natural worldview or\nattitude presupposes the practical and habitual context in which the\nobject is given and thus uncritically assumes the meaning of the\nobject in this context. The scientific worldview assumes a particular\nunderstanding of the natural world in its investigations and\ndetermination of meaning, an atomistic or mechanistic conception of a\nliving being. In both cases, there is no reflection regarding the\nmeaning presupposed in the intention. The phenomenological attitude\ndoes not negate the practical or scientific world and way of being. It\nmerely holds them in abeyance, suspending judgment. Such a suspension\nis motivated not by a disdain or a devaluation of the practical life,\nbut by a love of the world. It is in this respect that Scheler\ndescribes phenomenological attitude as a psychic technique comparable\nto Buddhist techniques of suffering (GW VIII, 139).\n\nScheler shares the conviction with realist phenomenologists such as\nAdolf Reinach that there are essential intuitions\n(Wesensanschauungen) or essential insights\n(Wesenseinsichten) (GW X, 383), in which we have intuitive\nand immediate graspings of the essence of the being of the objects.\nThis grasping of the object is never complete and assumes merely a\npartial insight into the thing itself (GW V, 199). Modernity, for\nScheler, suffers from a fundamental mistrust of the world, a mistrust\nthat the world given in experience is not the world itself, but rather\nsome construct produced by the human mind. Phenomenology assumes a\ntrust in the world and in experience. It is the world that gives\nitself to intuition, beckoning us to participate ever more fully in\nits significance. By virtue of this loving trust, the world itself is\ngiven. The phenomenological attitude is an expression on this trust\nand seeks to describe the object as it gives itself, as it is brought\nto self-givenness. \n3. Value Personalism\n\nScheler\u2019s first and most influential work in phenomenology was\nhis study of ethics, Formalism in Ethics and a Non-Formal (or\nMaterial) Ethics of Value. This work was motivated in part by a\ncritique of the highly scientific or formalistic approaches to ethics\nintroduced by Immanuel Kant and then later developed by the\nNeo-Kantians during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.\nKant\u2019s influence on Scheler\u2019s thought cannot be\nunderestimated. With Kant, Scheler rejects both utilitarianism and\neudaimonism, and holds that ethics rests upon an a priori, an\nobligation non-relative to future consequences or happiness. For Kant,\nthe a priori is expressed in the form of a categorical imperative, an\nimperative that is universalizable. For Scheler, such a formulation of\nthe a priori is abstract and as a consequence, fails to account for\nboth the unique obligation one has to another person and the unique\ncall to responsibility given in the ethical imperative (GW II, 34).\nThe ethical imperative, Scheler insists, is given as what one ought to\nnecessarily do, but it is also experienced as what \u2018I,\u2019\nand not merely anyone, ought to do (GW II, 94).\n\nScheler argues that a material or a non-formal a priori arises in\nexperience, specifically in the experience of value. All experience is\nalready value latent (GW II, 35). An object of perception such as an\noak tree is not only green or large, but also pleasurable, beautiful\nand magnificent. Objects of experience are bearers of values.\nHistorical artifacts bear cultural values, religious icons bear the\nvalue of the \u201choly.\u201d To suggest that an object bears a\nvalue is not to imply that a value inheres in an object. Just as the\ncolor red does not inhere in the tricycle, but is only given in the\nact of perception, the beauty of the painting is only given in the act\nof valuing. The value an object bears is given intuitively through a\ntype of value-ception. We \u201csee\u201d the beauty of a painting\njust as we \u201csee\u201d its colors. The grasping of value is our\nmost original and primordial relation to the world. An object has\nvalue for us before it is perceived or known (GW II, 40).\n\nFollowing Franz Brentano, Scheler conceived of positive and negative\nvalues as given in a relation to being. Positive values are not only\ngiven as that which entices us, but also as that which ought to be.\nSimilarly, negative values are given as that which ought not to be (GW\nII, 100). In the relation values bear to existence, an ideal ought is\ngiven. What ought to be is not logically derived or categorical, but\nis felt, i.e., experienced. Values not only draw our attention to the\nworld and others, but they also bear an ideal \u201cought.\u201d\n\nValuing is an act of meaning giving or creation and is therefore an\nintentional act. The act of valuing is not an intellectual act, but an\nact of the \u201cheart,\u201d i.e., an emotional act. For Scheler,\nthere are two basic emotional acts, the act of love and the act of\nhate. These two acts found all value-ception and consciousness (GW\nVII, 185). Love and hate are further characterized by Scheler as\nmovements (GW VII, 191). In the act of love, the value of an object or\na person is deepened, revealing its highest or most profound\nsignificance. Hate, by contrast, is a movement of destruction, a\nmovement wherein the value of an object or a person is demeaned or\ndegraded.\n\nThe feelings of love and hate are the acts in which the world first\ncomes to have meaning for us and a preferencing is inherent in this\nprocess. We tend toward or are attracted to that which is of greater\nor positive value, and tend to move away from or are repelled by that\nwhich is of lesser or negative value. Present in every experience is a\nranking of values, a preference of certain values to others (GW II,\n104). That there is an order of preferencing in experience is perhaps\nbest demonstrated by the act of sacrifice. For the sake of a\nparticular life value such as health, we may sacrifice pleasurable\nexperiences such as an overindulgence of ice-cream. An order of value\npreferencing is present in every experience and every individual\npossesses such an ordering, what Scheler calls \u201can\nethos.\u201d\n\nIt is in the experience of value preferencing that Scheler further\nclarifies the ethical a priori. There is, according to Scheler, an\nobjective ranking of values, a ranking of the \u201clower\u201d to\nthe \u201chigher,\u201d or better expressed, a ranking of the more\nsuperficial to the deeper. The ranking of value types from lowest to\nhighest is as follows: pleasure, utility, vitality, culture, and\nholiness. How the different types of value stand in relation to one\nanother is grasped intuitively in the experience of value. Evidence of\nthis ranking is felt through experiences like duration (GW II, 108) or\ndepth of fulfillment (GW II, 113). Claiming that there is an objective\norder of values, or in Pascal\u2019s terminology, an \u201cordre du\ncoeur\u201d (order of the heart), necessarily entails that the higher\nvalues \u201cought\u201d to be preferred to the lower. We ought to\nact in such a manner that promotes the higher or positive values. This\nnon-formal or material a priori of value is not given prior to\nexperience, but it is present in the experience of the particular\nvalue modalities. A religious icon is given not only as holy, but also\nas that which is to be preferred to the merely useful or vital. What\ntypes of value an object has is relative to the individual or culture.\nA cow certainly has a different value for the Hindu than for the\nrancher. Nonetheless, that the holy is to be preferred to the vital is\nnot historically or culturally relative.\n\nBoth the experience of value and the objective rank ordering of values\nare felt by a distinctive type of being, what Scheler calls\n\u201cpersons.\u201d \u201cPerson\u201d is a notion that Kant also\nuses and this is one of the reasons why Scheler uses the term. In a\nmanner quite similar to the problem of the a priori, Scheler wants to\nretain Kant\u2019s understanding of \u201cperson\u201d as absolute\nvalue, an end in itself Scheler is critical of Kant in so far as Kant\ngrounds the absolute value of the person in the universal category of\nreason.\n\nScheler describes the person as the concrete unity of acts of\ndifferent types and nature (GW II, 382). The person is present in each\nand every act, but the person is not reducible to any one act.\n\u201cUnity\u201d here is meant as a particular style, a style of\nact execution and being. Every individual has his or her unique style\nof loving, of assigning meaning, and necessarily has his or her own\naccess to the world. When a person dies, not only is that unique style\nof loving and assigning meaning lost, but so is that world.\n\nUnderstood as the unity of acts or an act center, the person is\nnecessarily non-objectifiable (GW II, 386). Objects only take on the\nmeaning as objects through intentional acts. Persons execute\nintentional acts. The meaning of a person is determined by the way in\nwhich a particular person brings meaning to the world. It is never a\nquestion of what a person is, but who a person is. Scheler takes great\npains to distinguish his notion of person from the traditional notions\nof subject, ego, mind or psyche. All of these traditional,\nphilosophical notions are objectifications, i.e. names given to\nparticular states, functions or capacities. Who a person is cannot be\ncaptured by a definition and can only be grasped through value\ninsight, an immediate and direct grasping of the other as a person in\nand through the act of love (GW II,\n 483)[1].\n The human being is constituted as person most profoundly through\nloving. \n\nThe imperative that is given in the value a priori, the objective rank\norder of values, is only felt by persons and, consequently, persons\nare the only beings who are ethically responsible. Because every\nexperience is value latent, a person is responsible to love the object\nor a being of that experience most fully, realizing the highest or\ndeepest value of that being. In relation with other persons, this\nresponsibility is ethical. In loving another person, one is called\nethically to love ever more fully and deeply. Failing to do so and\nresponding to this calling through acts of hate is not only ethically\nirresponsible but it is also morally evil. Any act that compromises or\nreduces the person to a lower value such as mere pleasure or utility\nis pernicious and evil.\n\nThe good in itself is thus a movement and openness to the higher or\ndeeper values. In the experience of positive values, we, as persons,\nare called to love others ever more profoundly. In the experience of\nnegative values, we are called to act in such a manner that ends the\ndestructive acts of hate and consequently brings an end to negative\nvalues. The call to act for the sake of the good itself is, for\nScheler, not general or universal, but radically individual or rather,\nunique. There is no experience of the good in itself in general, but\nonly the good in itself for me, and this constitutes in part the\nexperience of vocation peculiar to each unique person as creatively\nbecoming (GW II, 482). The deeper the value, the more individual, the\nmore personal, the call to act for the sake of the good becomes.\nEthical experience, the experience of being called to act for the\ngood, is a process of individuation (GW II, 501). The call becomes\never more personal as the value deepens. In acting ethically, I come\nto realize my unique place and contribution, and as a result, I become\nmore conscious of my obligation and duties to the world and to others.\nA material value ethic, in contrast to a formal ethic, reveals both\nthe radically unique manner by which each person is called to act and\nthe radically unique value of each and every person.\n4. Others, Community and Solidarity\n\nThere is, for Scheler, no problem of the other. This is not to say\nthat he rejects the alterity or difference of the other. What Scheler\nrejects is the presumed starting point of the so-called other minds, a\nstarting point that posits one mind over and against another, assuming\nthat we are first alone and then enter into relationships with others.\nThe consciousness of oneself as a self and as a person is always\nexperienced within the context of a \u201cmember of a totality\u201d\n(GW II, 510). Every experience, in other words, assumes as background\nthe \u201cexperiencing with one another\u201d (Miteinander-erleben)\nas well as the responsibility for others and the co-responsibility for\nthe community. All investigations that begin with the problem of the\nother presuppose this primordial communal background.\nPhenomenologically, the task is not to take this background for\ngranted but to clarify the different types of experiences that\nconstitute this communal background and those experiences that give\nrise to a sense of mine-ness and otherness.\n\nScheler\u2019s investigation into this primordial background begins\nat the affective or emotional level of experience. The affective life\nprecedes the intellectual life. In the case of the experience of\nothers, there is an affective or emotional understanding of others\nprior to any intellectual or rational understanding. The work\ndedicated to this investigation is Scheler\u2019s The Nature of\nSympathy (original German title, Wesen und Formen der\nSympathie literally means the Essence and Forms of\nSympathy). His main intent in this work was to show that it is\nimpossible to derive an ethic from merely shared feelings and\nconsequently to show that ethics assumes as original an intention of\nlove. In order to demonstrate this point, Scheler provides a detailed\nanalysis of the different types of shared feelings, which are\nthemselves irreducible to loving.\n\nThere are at least five different types of shared or co-feelings:\n\n\n\nFeeling with one another (Miteinanderf\u00fchlen):\n\nTwo or more people feel the same feeling together. Scheler\ngives an example of two parents. They share a love for their child and\nthey also share the pain or joy felt for that child. In the tragic\ndeath of a child, parents share the same pain, feeling the same\nsadness and loss together. Certainly, parents of a child will have\nmany different feelings for their child between them. Scheler is only\ndescribing the phenomenon of when parents feel the same feeling\ntogether.\n\n\nVicarious feeling (Nachf\u00fchlen):\n\nScheler refers to this type of shared feeling throughout his analysis,\nbut does not include it in his discussion of the specific types of\nco-feelings. In vicarious feeling, there is no genuine sharing or\nco-experiencing of a feeling. It is a type of grasping a feeling in\nthe other without any subsequent feeling of the grasped pain or joy, a\nfeeling at a distance. This grasping is not necessarily an\nintellectual comprehension, but an emotional or bodily comprehension.\nAny recognition of the feeling of others, including empathy, assumes\nsome form of vicarious feelings.\n\n\nFellow feeling (Mitgef\u00fchl):\n\nThis form of co-feeling is often referred to as sympathy or pity. Here\nthere is the intention of the other, a feeling for the other. When a\nfriend is in pain, not only do I share his or her pain, but I feel for\nmy friend. The shared feeling is not the same and there remains a\nclear distinction between me and the other. To distinguish fellow\nfeeling from vicarious feeling, Scheler uses the example of cruelty\n(GW VII, 25). The reason why human beings are so good at torture is\nthat we can vicariously feel and comprehend what it would be like to\nbe harmed in such a manner. In vicarious feeling, we do not feel the\nother\u2019s pain. In genuine cases of fellow feeling, we not only\nshare in the suffering the other feels, but we also feel for the\nperson who suffers, often motivated to act to end the\nsuffering.\n\n\nPsychic Contagion (Gef\u00fchlansteckung):\n\nExperiences in which a person is overtaken by a feeling to such an\nextent that he or she gets lost in it with others is the phenomenon of\npsychic contagion. Scheler uses the example of being taken over by the\njoyous atmosphere in a bar to make his point. After a difficult day\n\u201cat the office,\u201d you walk into a bar and are immediately\novertaken by the celebratory atmosphere, completely forgetting your\nday and troubles. In contrast to the other types of co-feeling,\npsychic contagion is the experience of losing yourself in the feeling\nor mood of the group. The \u201cI\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d become\na \u201cwe.\u201d In the midst of this experience, we do things we\nwould not necessarily do in a different setting. Psychic contagion\ncan, thus, be quite dangerous, as is the case with mob violence, for\ninstance.\n\n\nIdentification (Einsf\u00fchlung):\n\nNot to be confused with Einf\u00fchlung (empathy),\nidentification is a limit case of psychic contagion. In\nidentification, the \u201cI\u201d is lost and literally becomes the\nother. I no longer feel the pain in me, but only in the other. There\nis no distance between the I and you and I am transported, so to\nspeak, into the other, inhabiting his or her body as if it were mine.\nI may identify with the experience so deeply that I live it in the\nother. The experiences Scheler has in mind here are mystical\nexperiences where a person \u201cbecomes\u201d the god or hypnotic\nexperiences where the individual thinks and wills according to the\nhypnotist. (GW VII, 31)\n\n\nAll of these experiences of co-feeling are involuntary and take place\nregardless of whether we want to experience them. We become conscious\nof them only after the fact, realizing perhaps that we are already\nlaughing or crying. They demonstrate that at the most basic level, we\nare drawn to others and are inclined to participate in the lives and\nfeelings of others (GW VII, 241). This is most clearly evident in\ncases of self-deception or confusion, cases when two or more persons\nconfuse their ideas and experiences with each other\u2019s,\nforgetting whose experiences or ideas they were originally.\n\nIn Formalism in Ethics and a Non-Formal Ethics of Value,\nScheler builds upon these analyses to describe the distinctive types\nof communities in which human beings participate. This description\nfalls under the heading of \u201cCollective Person\u201d\n(Gesamtperson). Persons are act-centers, the unity in the\nexecution of acts. \u201cCollective Person\u201d refers to a\ndistinctive unity of the execution, what Scheler calls \u201csocial\nacts.\u201d Social acts are inherently directed at other persons and\nare only fully executed in relation to others. Examples of social acts\nare acts of promising, commanding, and obeying. A promise is not a\npromise until the other accepts it; a command is not a command if the\nother does not hear it, etc. These acts are distinct from the intimate\nor singularizing acts, acts such as self-consciousness, self-love,\nself-respect, etc. (GW II, 511) They are directed at the self and are\nfulfilled with reference only to the self. These different types of\nacts show that the person is both an individual and a member of a\ncommunity or collectivity. Distinguishing between different types of\nacts does not entail that we are many different persons. It means,\nrather, that our person, our style of being, is expressed both as an\nindividual and as a member of a community.\n\nScheler identifies four different types of communities or social\nunities.\n\n\n\nThe Herd or Mass:\n\nThis community type refers to a group formed through psychic contagion\nand other forms of involuntary repetition. As a member of a herd, one\nhas no self-consciousness. In the herd, one\u2019s actions are\ndictated by the whims and the irrationality of the masses. Caught up\nin the excitement or throes of the herd, one is no longer fully\nresponsible for his or her actions. For this reason, mass movements\nare potentially liberating as well as dangerous and susceptible to\ndictatorship.\n\n\nLife-Community (Lebensgemeinschaft):\n\nThis community type is formed through genuine acts of co-feeling and\nco-living. The subject of these shared feelings and experiences is,\nhowever, the community and not the individual. There is a sense of the\nself and a sense of belonging to a community with the others. But this\nself is not radically distinct from the community and the others.\nOne\u2019s striving is the striving of the community, a shared\npreferencing and valuing developed through traditions, rites, norms,\netc. In a life-community, there is a sense of solidarity, a sense of\nbeing responsible for others and for the group. This responsibility\nis, however, not fully moral and the solidarity is a\n\u201crepresentable solidarity.\u201d By\n\u201crepresentable,\u201d Scheler means that anyone in the group\ncan represent the others, can take responsibility for the others in\nthe same manner.\n\n\nSociety (Gesellschaft):\n\nAll communal bonds in a society are formed artificially and\nconsciously by each member (in contrast to the organic and unconscious\nbonds of a life-community). A society is made up of individuals who\nchoose to form relations for the sake of personal welfare,\nparticularly at the level of pleasure and utility. It has no reality\nbeyond the individuals who make up the collectivity; the whole is\nequal to the sum of its parts (whereas a life-community is a whole\nthat is greater than the sum of its parts). The formation of society\nis motivated by a fundamental mistrust in others, creating bonds for\nthe sake of security.\n\nMuch of Scheler\u2019s characterization of society has a negative\nring, particularly in comparison to what he says of the\nlife-community. He does make clear that society is the introduction of\nthe mature individual and the self-conscious human being. A member of\nthe life-community, by contrast, is not yet an individual and is, in\nthis respect, immature (unm\u00fcndig). For Scheler, the rise\nof society is a genuine development in history. Nonetheless, the\nlife-community is foundational for society. This is shown by virtue of\nthe contracts forming the bonds of society. Contracts are grounded in\nthe promise and assume a level of trust, a trust that is first\ncultivated in the life-community.\n\n\nCollective Person:\n\n\u201cCollective Person\u201d is the deepest and the most profound\nlevel of community. To a certain extent, it is the evolutionary\noutcome of both the life-community and society. But\n\u201contologically\u201d speaking, the loving community\n(Liebesgemeinschaft) is foundational for the other forms\nlisted above. What most distinctively characterizes the collective\nperson is its sense of solidarity. Each member of the community is not\nonly fully responsible for his or her actions, but is also\nco-responsible for the actions of others and of the community. In\ncontrast to the life-community, each member is self-aware of him or\nherself as an individual, as a fully realized person. Yet, in contrast\nto society, the individual is caught up in a network of relations with\nothers. The sense of solidarity in the collective person is that of an\n\u201cunrepresentable\u201d solidarity. Every member of the\ncollective person is absolutely unique. No one can stand in for anyone\nelse and each bears responsibility for others and for the\ngroup.\n\n\nWithin the notion of the collective person, Scheler describes three\ndifferent types: the state (or nation), culture (or people) and the\nchurch. The main difference between these three types is the range or\nextent of responsibility. Every citizen of the state is co-responsible\nfor every other citizen, a limit defined by state or national borders\n(as well as recognized members of the citizenry). A culture is\ndemarcated by the borders created by shared values, beliefs, and\nideas. These borders are often more expansive than a state, but many\ndifferent cultures can be found in a state. The church is the most\nexpansive of the types of collective persons and includes all finite\npersons. It is the fullest realization of what Scheler calls\n\u201cthe love community\u201d (Liebesgemeinschaft). The\nsense of solidarity concerns the salvation of all finite persons,\npast, present and future. Although these different types of collective\npersons can be ranked with respect to their related values (life,\nspirit, holy), they enjoy their own autonomy and Scheler insists upon\na clear divide between not only church and state, but also culture and\nstate.\n\nThe most crucial notion that arises from Scheler\u2019s analysis of\nthe collective person is that of solidarity. Solidarity assumes two\ndistinct types of responsibility: a responsibility for one\u2019s own\nactions and a co-responsibility for the actions of others.\nCo-responsibility does not compromise the autonomy of the individual.\nEvery person is fully responsible for his or her actions. For Scheler,\nco-responsibility is a radical form of questioning. When another\nperson commits an act of hate or violence, the questions implied in\nsolidarity are how such acts are possible and how I have participated\nin creating a world wherein such acts are possible. The act of hate\ncommitted by another person signals that I (and each member of the\ngiven community) have not loved deeply enough and that we as a\ncommunity have failed to bring about a world wherein hate does not\nexist (GW II, 526). Solidarity assumes the manner in which we have\nshared our lives and feelings with one another in a community, but\nalso the necessity for a person to act to end evil and injustice. The\npresence of evil in one\u2019s community demonstrates that every\nmember ought to love more fully and act so that evil is not possible.\nAt the level of the collective person, this call to responsibility is\nfelt uniquely by each person, revealing the uniqueness of one\u2019s\nrole in and for the community.\n\nSharing a community with others and sharing the responsibility for the\ncommunity with others is the context in which the person is formed and\nrealized. It is not the answer to the epistemological question\nregarding the knowledge of the other or of other minds. In his\nrelatively brief analysis of this question, Scheler agrees that the\ncore of the person is not given in perception, at least not in the\nsense that his or her physical body is given as an object of\nperception (GW VII, 238). Perception, however, is only one means of\ngivenness and hence only one means of access to the other. It is only\nin the act of love that the other person is given (GW II, 483). The\ngivenness of the other is irreducible to any physical or psychic\ncharacteristics. In the act of love, there is an immediate intuition\nof the person, an \u201cungrounded\u201d plus (GW VII, 168).\nEvidence of this plus is our inability to state the reasons and prove\nwhy we love the other even though we are certain of our love.\n\nLove, therefore, does not afford us a rational understanding of the\nother person. What it offers is a means by which to participate in the\nway of being and loving of the other. In order to\n\u201cunderstand\u201d the other, we have to love like the other (GW\nII, 169). Afforded in this experience of loving is access to the world\nof the other and the moral (or ideal) value of the other. It is not a\nmatter of reading the other\u2019s mind, of knowing what the other is\nthinking. Rather, love grants us an understanding of who the other is.\nThe deepest experiences of love for the other reveals the absolute or\nholy value of the other, grasping who the other could be or ought to\nbecome. For Scheler, it is possible that another person may know me\nbetter than I know myself and he or she may be able to direct me to my\nideal way of being (GW II, 483). The understanding of the other\nthrough love is a value comprehension. This is not a full disclosure\nof the other, but a deepening of appreciation of who the other is, an\nappreciation that calls me to love the other ever more profoundly.\n5. Religious Experience\n\nScheler\u2019s work on the phenomenology of religious experience is\none of his most significant contributions to the phenomenological\ntradition. Contrary to his contemporaries such as Husserl and\nHeidegger who persist on bracketing out the question of God or the\nholy, Scheler examines the experience in a direct and explicit manner.\nScheler\u2019s insistence on the possibility of a phenomenology of\nreligious experience, an insistence that it is possible to provide a\ndescription of the essential qualities and conditions of the\nexperience of the holy, is itself a critique of modernity and of the\npositivistic tendencies growing in philosophical and scientific\nthought.\n\nAccording to Scheler, the modern worldview harbors a prejudice with\nrespect to what counts as an experience or what is evidential. For the\nmodern thinker, only those experiences that can be proven in a\nrational or logical manner are true or evidential experiences (GW V,\n104). The prejudice is not that matters of faith or religious\nexperience are not meaningful, but that they are not subject to\nrigorous scientific or critical investigation. Because they lie\noutside the bounds of reason, we are, as Wittgenstein would say, to\nremain silent. For Scheler, the problem in modernity is that only one\ntype or form of evidence is regarded as objective or true, the mode of\nrational proof. Inherent to the practice of phenomenology is the\nopenness to distinctive modes of evidence. Any presupposition about\nwhat counts as objective or subjective, as true or merely\npsychological must be held in abeyance. For Scheler, the experience of\nthe holy or of the absolute is not given through rational proof, but\nin the distinctive evidential mode of revelation (GW V, 150). All\nrational proofs already assume the experience or the revelation of God\nand thus come too late in the attempt to grasp how the holy or the\nabsolute is experienced (GW V, 249). Scheler\u2019s approach is to\ngrant revelation its own integrity and to treat it as a meaningful\nexperience subject to philosophical investigation.\n\nIt is important to note at the outset of a discussion of\nScheler\u2019s work on religious experience that he prefaces his\nmajor work on religious experience, Vom Ewigen des Menschens\n(On the Eternal in Man), with a description of the religious\nand existential crisis that humanity faced at the end of World War I.\nMany, including Scheler, had hoped that the Great War would reawaken a\nsense of dignity both in one\u2019s culture and in humanity in\ngeneral. The war failed miserably in this respect and has left\nhumanity only \u201cdrunk\u201d with suffering, death and tears (GW\nV, 103). In this moment of despair comes the call to a religious\nrenewal, a call that concerns the very meaning and purpose of human\nexistence. For Scheler, World War I was the first collective\nexperience of humanity as such, i.e., an experience shared by all (GW\nV, 104). Consequently, the call to renewal, the desperate seeking of\nthe meaning of existence, is a call experienced by all of humanity. It\nhas thus never been so crucial to understand the meaning of revelation\nand the experience of the absolute, for the danger of the rise of an\nidol or a false god has never been so imminent. Whoever or whatever\nmay step in to answer this call to renewal during these times of\ncrisis potentially has the power to determine the meaning and course\nof humanity.\n\nA phenomenology of religious experience is, for Scheler, a description\nof the essential characteristics and the meaning of revelation.\nScheler defines revelation simply as the specific type of givenness\nwherein the divine or the holy is given (GW V, 249).\n\u201cGivenness\u201d is a term used by Scheler and other\nphenomenologists to name that which is experienced in a particular\nact. It is, more precisely, the objective correlate of the intentional\nact. There is the intending on the part of the person and that which\nis given, the object or meaning. To suggest that revelation is a\npeculiar mode of givenness is to say that the divine or the holy is\ngiven to the person in a unique manner that is wholly distinct from\nperceived objects or rational judgments. The attempt to describe the\nessential characteristics of revelation, characteristics that show how\nrevelation is distinct from other modes of givenness, assumes that\nrevelation has its own particular sense of lawfulness (GW V, 242).\nThis means that the investigation into the nature of revelation must\nfollow the logic demonstrated in the revelatory experience itself and\non its own accord.\n\nScheler distinguishes three essential characteristics of the act of\nrevelation that are unique to the religious act.\n\n\n\nThe intention of the religious act is world transcendence. Scheler is\ncommitted to the idea that the religious act is an intentional act.\nThe intention is the so-called subject correlate of the act of\nintentionality. In the case of revelation, this intention is a\ntranscendence of anything finite (i.e.of this world) (GW V, 245). This\nis not to say that revelation is not of this world or does not take\nplace in this world, nor does it mean that the holy is not experienced\nin a finite object such as a religious icon or a finite person.\nRather, it means that what is posited in the act of revelation is\nalways other than this world, a meaning transcending the finite or the\nrelative.\n\n\nThe objective correlate of the religious intention is also infinite in\nits meaning and value. Only the divine or the holy fulfills the\nintention of the religious act. No finite thing of any kind, no finite\ngood or object of love can fulfill the religious act. This is not to\nsay that we are not at times mistaken and erringly take a finite\nobject as infinite, as in the case of idolatry. What is sought in the\nreligious act is precisely that which in principle could not be\nexperienced in this world. We are seeking a happiness that would never\nbe possible on earth and we are hoping in the religious act for that\nwhich is impossible and unimaginable (GW V, 246).\n\n\nFinally, the religious act is only fulfilled through a reception\n(Aufnahme) of the divine that reveals itself to another\nbeing. (GW V, 245). In revelation, something is given, i.e.,\nexperienced. Scheler rejects the idea that the experience of the\ndivine is wholly immanent and could be explained through an\nobjectivization of an immanent experience, an experience motivated by\nand in the person. For this reason, the religious act is not\nsubjective. It is a response to that which is given, a response to the\ndivine that gives itself. The essential difference between so-called\nnatural religion (where the world is given as God\u2019s creation)\nand positive religion (where the experience of the divine is personal)\nlies in the way that the divine reveals itself. The revelation found\nin natural religion is generic: God is given in nature for all to see.\nRevelation in positive religion is the experience of a wholly unique\nrelation. God gives him or herself to me in a manner that is\nparticular to me (GW V, 249).\n\n\nIt is this third and final aspect of the religious act that marks\nScheler\u2019s contribution to the investigation of revelation.\nScheler\u2019s claim is that for there to be a religious act, the\ndivine must be given in experience. The question that immediately\narises, particularly within the context of the modern worldview, is\nhow we know that this experience is real and not imaginary or merely\nsubjective. Scheler agrees that there is no way to prove deductively\nor rationally that this experience was indeed real or that the divine\nexists. The givenness of the divine is its demonstration. Scheler uses\nthe German term Aufweis to distinguish the particular way in\nwhich the reality or truth of the experience is given in revelation.\nAn Aufweis is a pointing out or a showing of. The divine\nshows itself in such a manner that its existence cannot be proven by\nthe use of reason. In the experience of the divine, the existence of\nthe divine is given. For this reason, it is impossible to prove to\nanyone who has not had a religious experience that God or a god\nexists.\n\nAs with much of his research, Scheler\u2019s investigation into the\nreligious act is ultimately rooted in a a study of the meaning of the\nhuman being. For Scheler, the religious act is a fundamental and\nessential aspect of being human (GW V, 261). Each and every human\nbeing executes the intending of the absolute or the divine and is\nalways a response to the givenness of the absolute. A human being is a\nGod-seeker. This is not to say that everyone believes that there is a\nGod, but only that each and every one of us executes the religious\nintention, an intending of the absolute.\n\nAtheism is not a disproof of Scheler\u2019s claim; it is only a\nrejection of God\u2019s existence. That there is a negation of the\ndivine in atheism only demonstrates that even the atheist executes the\nreligious act. The negation of the divine only makes sense in the\ncontext of the religious act. For the atheist, one may very well\nintend the divine, but such intentions are only met with great\ndisappointment. The agnostic, on the other hand, holds open the\npossibility that the divine exists. For Scheler, the agnostic is a\nmetaphysical nihilist, a person who rejects that we could ever know\nwith certainty that there is a God.\n\nScheler\u2019s claim that the human being is a God seeker allows for\nthe beliefs of atheists and agnostics, but it leads him to a much\nstronger claim: \u201cEvery finite spirit believes either in a God or\nin an idol\u201d (GW V, 261). An idol is a finite object that is\ntreated as if it were infinite, as if it were God (GW V, 263). The\natheist is not really, according to Scheler, a non-believer. Rather,\nthe atheist believes in a no-God, that there is no absolute value or\nmeaning. This is still a religious act and a religious belief.\nScheler\u2019s point is that there is always an intending of the\nabsolute, a seeking of a God. What is in question is necessarily the\nobject intended as absolute. In the act of idolatry, this God is a\nfinite object or a good such as wealth, fame or power. The risk of\nidolatry is ever present, a risk entailed in the radical openness of\nthe human being to absolute value. Whether God exists or not is\nirrelevant here. What the investigation of the religious act and\nreligious experience demonstrates is that being human is an opening; a\nhuman being is open to the absolute and the divine.\n\nA final note and a useful transition into the next subject heading\nconcerns the relation between religions themselves and the question\nconcerning the diversity or variety of religious experience. The image\nScheler uses to depict the relation that different religions and\ncultures bear to one another is that of a tributary all flowing into\nthe same river toward the same end point (GW XIII, 92). Religious\nexperience yields only a glimpse of the holy and provides only a\npartial, but original insight. Although all religious insight yields\nsuch a partial glimpse, not all insights are of the same depth. Some\nof the deepest insights into the holy have formed and led to the major\nreligions of the world. These rivers may intersect, divide or share\ncertain pathways, but none serves or can serve as the disproof of the\nother. Religious faith and beliefs are of the most deeply rooted and\nsignificant, and consequently can often lead to great conflict with\nother faiths. In his more hopeful moments, Scheler thought that the\nincreasingly shrinking world promised the opportunity to understand\nthe different religious insights and form a greater understanding of\nthe divine. Yet, he also warned that these conflicts of faith may\ncontinue to lead to the bloodiest of wars. Acknowledging a genuine\nreligious diversity does not commit one to the view that all religious\nideas or beliefs are of the same value, but rather to the realization\nthat there are genuine and irreconcilable differences between them.\nHow we reconcile and live in a smaller world with these differences\nwill determine whether the future will be one of war or one of\npeace.\n6. Social and Political Theory\n\nScheler\u2019s social and political thought matures in the fertile\nintellectual ground of the sociological and political debates of the\nearly 20th century. The context of Scheler\u2019s thought\nis the creation of sociology as a discipline and Scheler seeks to\nplace himself in the critical exchange with the major players of this\ntime in sociology and politics, such as Max Weber, Emile Durkheim,\nWilhelm Dilthey, Oswald Spengler, Herbert Spencer, Ferdinand\nT\u00f6nnies and Karl Schmitt. Scheler\u2019s socio-political thought\nwas born from within the cultural crisis experienced in Germany both\npreceding and most emphatically following World War I.\n\nEarly in his writings, Scheler represents the Christian voice of the\nleft. The central question for Scheler and for socio-political thought\nat this time in Germany was whether an alternative to either\nliberalism or socialism was possible. Scheler argues early that\nChristian democracy is the most profound and viable alternative,\nshowing how the resource for a cultural and political renewal is the\nChristian notion of love and solidarity. The explicitly religious\naspect of Scheler\u2019s socio-political thought lessens to a degree\nin the latter stages of his thought, but he never abandons the idea of\nsolidarity as the basis for a more just and peaceful future, a future\nwhere the people collectively and in solidarity take up the task of\ntransforming the world in which we live.\n\nScheler\u2019s premature death would prevent him from experiencing\nfirsthand the unthinkable and horrific consequences of the social and\npolitical crises Germany faced during the early 20th\ncentury. The crisis was for him not merely a German problem, but the\nproblem of modernity in general. Scheler did not hesitate to speak in\ngeneral and singularizing terms like \u201cthe German culture,\u201d\n\u201cthe European culture\u201d or even \u201cthe West.\u201d\nWith such generalities as \u201cthe modern worldview,\u201d Scheler\ncould identify the underlying ethos, i.e., the order of valuing, of a\nculture and describe the dominant tendencies responsible for the\nsocial and cultural crisis. However, Scheler used the terms \u201cthe\nGerman culture\u201d or \u201cthe European culture\u201d as a means\nto preserve a unique and irreplaceable spiritual development of a\npeople. The attempt to defend the meaning and culture of a people\ncontinued to be a cause for tension in Scheler\u2019s thought, a\ntension that would lead him to defend German aggression at the outset\nof World War I and a tension that motivated his critique of fascism\nand his support for the necessity of the ideal of peace.\n\nThe crisis of modernity was, for Scheler, the result of three central\nfactors or mindsets: (1) the rise of late capitalism, (2) the\nmechanization of nature, and (3) liberal individualism.\nScheler\u2019s description of these three as \u201cmindsets\u201d\n(Denkformen) is purposeful. Particularly in respect to\ncapitalism, he wants to distinguish his work from that of Weber and\nSombart, specifically from their work on the \u201cspirit\u201d of\ncapitalism. On the other hand, he wants to retain an understanding of\ncapitalism, for instance, as not merely an economic system, but as an\napproach and a way of configuring the world.\n\nCapitalism, the mechanization of nature and liberal individualism are\nreductive mindsets. A reductive mindset is a way of viewing the world\nthat devalues all other possible views. The mechanization of nature,\nfor example, becomes not merely one form of knowledge of nature, but\nthe only way in which to know it. All reductive mindsets are, for\nScheler, ultimately rooted in a value reversal. The value reversal\nthat all three of these mindsets share is the promotion of utility\nover the value of life. As a consequence, a living being only has\nvalue in so far as it is useful. Late capitalism is the economic\nexpression of the value reversal. All goods, objects and beings are\nvaluable only in so far as they are able to generate more wealth. The\nmechanization of nature is the reduction of a living being to a\nmechanism or a machine for the purposes of manipulation and control\nand for achieving some useful end for human beings. Liberal\nindividualism is the reduction of all forms of community to society.\nAs a result, all interpersonal relations are regarded as artificial\nand contractual, relations formed for the benefit of the\nindividual\u2019s interests.\n\nTogether these different but related mindsets create a worldview, the\nmodern Weltanschauung, and succeed in transforming the world\ninto an object of utility. The value reduction to utility poses not\nonly a threat to the life and the welfare of living beings, but also\nto the cultural and spiritual values. Utility, as the dominant value,\ndoes not destroy the higher values. It cultivates, rather, a type of\nvalue blindness. People lose sight of the value of spiritual pursuits\nsuch as the arts, philosophy and religion. Spiritual values are only\nnoticed through their usefulness. When a culture becomes blind to the\nhigher values, it also loses sight of its uniqueness as a culture and\nas a people. At the level of utility, people are more alike. Cultural\ndifferences matter very little when the goals become efficiency and\nproductivity. It is the higher, spiritual values that reveal the\nuniqueness of a specific culture. The end of the modern worldview,\nScheler maintains, is an internationalization of all cultures, a\nmaking of all peoples and cultures one and the same (GW IV, 600).\n\nScheler has little interest in merely remaining a spectator to the\ncrisis and his writing offers the means to overcome it. While he\nanalyzes the main factors responsible for the crisis of modernity,\nScheler\u2019s suggestions for overcoming it change dramatically. His\nfirst and most troublesome response to the crisis was war. During his\ntime earning a living as a freelance writer, Scheler worked for the\nstate\u2019s office of propaganda during the year leading up to and\nimmediately following the outbreak of World War I. Like many\nintellectuals at the time, Scheler was a vociferous defender of German\naggression and thought that the war could function as a means to\nawaken the German people from cultural slumber and value blindness. In\nhis major work on the war, Der Genius des Krieges und der deutsche\nKrieg (The Genius of War and the German War) Scheler\ndistinguishes three different levels on which war functions as a\ncultural renewal.\n\n\n\nScheler argues that war is quite natural to life as it is a natural\nconsequence of the organism\u2019s growth. More importantly, these\nconflicts among living beings function as an important reminder of the\nvalue of life and the types of trusting and communal relations that\nemerge through a sharing of life with other human beings.\n\n\nWar is also a significant factor in the growth of a culture. The Great\nWar was a war of culture and lifestyles. Through this conflict,\nGermany would be reminded of its uniqueness. Conflict serves as an\nincredibly stark reminder of how one\u2019s own culture differs from\nsomeone else\u2019s. This must not necessarily be a judgment of which\nculture is better, but rather functions as an awakening to one\u2019s\nown particular culture and one\u2019s particular role in preserving\nand promoting one\u2019s own culture.\n\n\nFinally, Scheler discusses the value level of the holy and it is at\nthis level that the war finds its greatest significance. Scheler\nbegins this analysis by showing first how war and violence are not\nanti-religious acts, but are very much a part of religious belief,\nattempting to make sense of loving one\u2019s enemy on the\nbattlefield. These remarks are only preparatory. The genuine holy\nsignificance of the war for Germany comes from the realization that\nthe war is a battle for justice. Scheler is not pro-war and argues\nthat the only justified war is a defensive war that defends against\nthe annihilation of the significant values of a culture (GW IV, 101).\nFor Scheler, Germany is not the aggressor, but England is. This\naggression is only made explicit through the type of worldview and\nmindset analysis that Scheler gives. At stake is the annihilation of\nthe German people, a wholly unjust act. Hence, when Germany rises to\nbattle, it is defending not only itself, but also justice, fighting\nagainst tyrannical forces aiming to destroy a culture and a\npeople.\n\n\nScheler\u2019s analysis and justification of German aggression\nleading to the war is confused for many reasons, many of which Scheler\nhimself acknowledges in his later writings. A central confusion\nScheler recognizes concerns the meaning and the possibility of\nrenewal. Renewal, as Scheler writes later, only takes place through an\nact of repentance and thus can never be motivated by hatred. Scheler\nwrites specifically with respect to the possibility of a political\nreconstruction that what is necessary is a collective proclamation of\nguilt, not merely for the war, but also for the cultural depression\nand value degradation for which every member of the German and\nEuropean community is responsible (GW V, 416). Acts of repentance,\nindividual or collective, assume a moral transformation. Whereas war\nfinds its resource for renewal through the violent conflict with the\nenemy, repentance grounds its renewal in the ethical insight into the\nperson I ought to be. The act of repentance and the expression of\nguilt are acts of disclosure, revealing what kind of person one ought\nto be in contrast to the kind of person one has been. These acts\ndemonstrate that the person has become a more loving human being.\nTransformation, either for the individual or for a people, is\nmotivated by this moral ideal disclosed in the act of repentance.\n\nScheler describes this sense of transformation as a transformation\n\u201cfrom above\u201d (GW IV, 397). It is a rejection of what\nScheler takes to be the socialist form of transformation, a\ntransformation from below. What Scheler thinks is lacking in socialism\nand Marxism is a sense of the absolute value of the person. A\ntransformation from below, a transformation fueled by class conflict\nor other economic factors, fails to recognize the uniqueness and the\nvalue of each person. Such recognition is possible only at the\nspiritual or ideal level of insight. Socialism, according to Scheler,\nregards the person only in terms of the basic life values and\nconsequently seeks only to transform the given social and political\ncontext from this perspective, a perspective which treats all person\nas if they were the same.. A transformation from above takes the\nperson as the highest value and transforms the given conditions in\naccord with uniqueness of each and every individual.\n\nScheler is not interested in a revolution and at no time speaks of a\npossible overthrow of the existing governments in Germany or in\nEurope. The revolutionary act comes in the form of an act of\nresurgence in the community and the specific sense of responsibility\ndeveloped through the bonds of solidarity. Solidarity is the principle\nthat guides the generation of a Christian community and it is on this\nform of community that Scheler hopes to found a new Germany and Europe\n(GW VI, 264). In this second phase of Scheler\u2019s social and\npolitical thought, he was attracted to the manner by which the person\nas absolute value was realized in the bonds of solidarity. In\nsolidarity, a person comes to realize not only his or her\nco-responsibility for every member of the group, but also his or her\nunique calling to act on behalf of the good and the just. The bonds of\nsolidarity not only overcome the individualism of liberalism and the\nvalue reduction of socialism, but they also reveal the call to act and\nthus to participate in the social and political reconstruction.\n\n\u201cChristian democracy\u201d is the title Scheler gives to the\npolitical expression of the sense of solidarity he develops in the\nsecond phase of his social and political thought (GW IV,\n676\u2013687). Scheler does not return to this notion again, but it\ndoes isolate the three basic aspects of his political thought that\ngrew out of this period of his thought and that informed his later\nthought as well. These three aspects of Christian democracy are as\nfollows: (1) Each and every member is called to act by virtue of a\nsense of co-responsibility for every other member and for the group as\na whole, an expression of collective self-governance, (2) the basic\nvital needs and goods are provided to all, preserving the\nlife-community of a people, and (3) dignity and humility are the\ncentral virtues that preserve the radical uniqueness of each and every\nperson. A Christian democracy is a model of collective governance\nwherein each person is concerned about the basic welfare of all while\npromoting what makes each person unique. Or, in Scheler\u2019s words,\nit maintains an aristocracy \u201cin the heavens\u201d and a\ndemocracy \u201con earth\u201d (GW II, 500).\n\nThe beginning of the third phase in Scheler\u2019s social and\npolitical thought is marked by the publication of his work,\nProblems of a Sociology of Knowledge. Although this idea of a\nsociology of knowledge is a new approach for Scheler, it does not\nraise a new question. In this work, Scheler investigates the manner in\nwhich values and ideals determine the course of history, i.e., what is\nboth possible and actual for a culture. This is the same concern that\nScheler raised in his work on value theory. What is novel about his\nlater approach is an understanding of history as an interplay between\ntwo wholly distinct factors, real and ideal. Whereas Scheler\u2019s\nearlier work focused primarily on the ideal or on the role of values\nin history, the later work places much greater emphasis on the\nso-called \u201creal\u201d factors or drives of life. This change of\nemphasis was motivated in part by his disappointment with the\nreconstructive efforts immediately after the war and the recognition\nthat ideals and values are incapable on their own of instituting\nchange.\n\nThere are, for a human society, three basic real factors: family,\npolitics and economics. These three factors are rooted in the basic\nlife-drive structure of the human being. The family is rooted in the\nsex drive, politics \u2013 in the power drive and economics \u2013\nin the appetitive or the acquisition drive (GW VIII, 19). Life or\nexistence is a basic urge to be (Drang) and in the human\nbeing, this urge to be is expressed in terms of the three basic\ndrives. These drives are what makes all that is possible and in terms\nof the development of history, the drives are what makes history\npossible.\n\nIdeal factors are activities such as art, philosophy, science and\nreligion. These factors are rooted in spirit, a movement expressed in\neach human being that discloses the higher values and ideals. The\nideal factors enjoy a development independent of the real and have\ntheir own logic of development. The real or actual does not determine\nwhat is or what can be thought. Culture is the arena in which spirit\nunfolds, but this unfolding is particular to each and every culture.\nScheler adamantly rejects any idea of a world-spirit or eternal\nobjective logos directing the course of human history and of every\nculture (GW VIII, 27). There is, by the very nature of spirit itself,\na diversity of cultures, each having its own organizational structure\nand function (GW VIII, 25). The development of a culture rests on the\nparticular insights of its people and proceeds along the course\nparticular to that culture.\n\nWith respect to existence, however, the ideal factors are powerless.\nThey cannot on their own accord realize any idea or value. Their power\nlies in their ability to direct and channel the real factors of\nhistory. They are parasitic in this manner upon the real factors,\nhaving power only in so far as they are able to determine the course\nof the real factors. The life drives are what gives spirit its power\nto exist. History, therefore, takes place through the interplay of the\nreal and the ideal factors. Its course is determined by which ideas\nand values become dominant in directing the life drives.\n\nThis process of determining the real factors and realizing the ideal\nis the process of spiritualization and it defines the task of being\nhuman. A sociology of knowledge is an examination of how certain ideas\nand values have shaped the real factors, giving rise to diverse\nexpressions of the family, politics and economics. Politically,\nspiritualization is not only the process by which the drive to power\nis directed by the higher values of spirit, the transformation of\nphysical power into political power, but also an understanding that\nideas alone do not change the course of history. Politics is an\nactivity that engages the real and thus must unfold through action.\nThe loving bonds of solidarity may give rise to deeper insights\nregarding the value of a person, but these insights only come to have\nan effective force if they are realized in the acts of persons.\n\nThroughout his political writings, Scheler was prone to raising\nultimatums for Germany and Europe. During the events leading up to\nWorld War I, either Germany would fight for its and Europe\u2019s\ncultural dignity, or Europe would cease to exist. Immediately after\nthe war, it was once again an \u201ceither/or\u201d frame in terms\nof the existence of Europe: either Europe would generate itself again\nfrom the loving bonds of community and solidarity, or it would\ncollapse under the pressures of capitalism, liberalism and the\nmechanization of nature. Scheler never stopped fearing the destructive\nideals and values inherent to modernity. Yet, his greatest political\nfear was political indifference (GW XIII, 72). Indifference leads only\nto despotism, he writes, and with the looming threat of fascism\nthroughout Europe it was more important than ever for the people of\nEurope to act. Despite a history that only knows violence and war,\npeace remains a possibility. In his essay on the eternal ideal of\npeace, Scheler writes that peace is always a future possibility, but\nthat this eternal ideal will not realize itself. The realization of\npeace requires direct political action that must spring collectively\nfrom each and every member (GW XIII, 121). Scheler\u2019s mature\nsocial and political thought demonstrates the necessity of action and\nthe possible terror that will ensue when indifference and apathy\nbecome the cultural norm.\n7. Philosophical Anthropology and Metaphysics\n\nIn the Preface to the volume, The Forms of Knowledge and\nSociety, Scheler remarks that the works contained in the volume,\nThe Sociology of Knowledge and Cognition and Work,\nare a means to understand both his philosophical anthropology and\nmetaphysics (GW VIII, 11). Many of the themes present in this volume\nare developed in a more speculative manner. Scheler has been often\ncriticized for taking this metaphysical turn, a turn apparently\ndefying his earlier phenomenological investigations and a turn taken\nat a time that many were declaring to be the end of the metaphysics\nand metaphysical systems. For Scheler, the move was necessary to\ncounteract the forces found in the mindsets that underpin those\npositive sciences that render metaphysical and philosophical\ninvestigations meaningless. More importantly, this metaphysical turn\nwas also necessary to grasp more profoundly the crisis haunting\nmodernity.\n\nThe social and political tensions erupting in Germany and Europe,\ntensions Scheler feared would lead to a second and even bloodier World\nWar, had their roots in a much deeper crisis, an ontological crisis, a\ncrisis of the human being. This crisis is perhaps best captured by\nScheler in his essay, The Human Being and History. Scheler\nwrites, \u201cIn our ten-thousand year history, we are the first time\nperiod in which the human being has become fully and totally\n\u2018problematic\u2019; the first time period in which the human\nbeing no longer knows who he or she is, but also knows that\nhe or she does not know\u201d (GW IX, 120). The purpose of the later\nspeculative work was not merely to clarify the nature of the crisis,\nbut also to problematize what had become unproblematic, to show that\nthe human being is a question that ought to be considered.\n\nPhilosophical anthropology is an attempt to provide a unified account\nof the meaning of the human being. In a much earlier work, The\nIdea of the Human Being, Scheler writes that the human being is\nundefinable (GW III, 186). The human being is no thing, but rather a\n\u201cbecoming,\u201d a \u201cbetween,\u201d a\n\u201cself-transcending being.\u201d An attempt at a unified account\nis thus not a search for a definition, but rather an attempt to\nclarify exactly that which makes the human being undefinable, that\nwhich reveals human being as a human becoming. A philosophical\nanthropology is historical in as much as it investigates the dominant\nworldviews that harbor a basic insight into the meaning of being\nhuman. The three dominant insights that Scheler wishes to unify are\n(1) the human being as \u201ctool maker\u201d (homo faber), the\ninsight of Darwinian evolution and science, (2) the human being as\nrational animal, the insight directing the ancient Greek worldview,\nand (3) the human being as child of God, the insight of the\nJudeo-Christian worldview. Each insight, for Scheler, reveals a\npeculiar aspect of the human being. The problem is that no one has yet\nshown how these insights are united to form a singular whole, the\nunity that is the human being.\n\nA rejection of any attempt to define the human being is a rejection of\nthe traditional attempt in philosophy to think of the human being as a\nsubstance. Scheler describes the human being not as a substance, but\nas the meeting point of two distinct movements (GW IX, 70). These\nmovements are life-urge (Lebensdrang) and spirit\n(Geist). The distinction between these two movements follows\nthe distinction between the real and the ideal factors introduced in\nthe sociology of knowledge. It is only in the human being that life\nand spirit find themselves in a process of becoming unified. In the\nhuman being, life becomes spiritualized and spirit becomes vitalized\nand embodied. Every act of the human being participates in this dual\nprocess, a process that is never completed, but is recreated in every\nnew act. Either this process participates in the realization of the\ndeeper, spiritual values, or it is a movement toward bestialization, a\nrealization of the more shallow and superficial values.\n\nLife-urge is the movement found in every living being, the movement or\ndrive to seek the greatest amount of fulfillment and vivacity with the\nleast amount of resistance. This urge can be found in the distinct\nstages of evolution, whether in the most basic living organism or in\nthe higher primates and human beings. It expresses itself in the\ninstinctual drives as well as in the highly sophisticated intelligence\nneeded to solve problems related to survival in an environment.\nScheler argues in Cognition and Work that pragmatism has\noffered to date the best and the most robust account of the human\nbeing as a living being who interacts with and learns from his or her\nenvironment.\n\nLiving beings relate to their environment and to other living beings\nerotically, through a type of cosmic love disclosed most emphatically\nin the person of Saint Francis of Assisi (GW VIII, 274). As\nerotic-vital beings, humans seek the most vivacious and beautiful of\nlives. A living being desires not merely to live, but to live most\nfully. As living beings, we bear an erotic relation to the natural\nworld. This loving relation to other living beings affords us a\nconnection to others as fellow living beings, an understanding of the\nother as living, as sharing in an environment. Having a body affords\nthe human being a privileged access to the living world and the\nenvironment, an access threatened by the mechanization of nature and\nthe modern drive to dominate it.\n\nWhat it means to be a living being takes on a much more complex and\nelevated significance in Scheler\u2019s later work and marks a\ngenuinely new avenue of investigation for him. Yet, the questions\nconcerning the meaning of being human remain very much the same. Are\nhuman beings merely intelligent living beings? Is the difference\nbetween the being human and being some other animal one of degree or\nis it a difference of kind? Is there anything \u201cspecial\u201d or\nunique about being human? The answer to these questions is decisive\nfor Scheler. At stake is the meaning of the human being as person, as\nabsolute value. In his philosophical anthropology, Scheler attempts to\ndemonstrate that the human being also participates in the movement of\nspirit and that spirit is essentially different from the movement of\nlife. The human being has a \u201cspecial\u201d place in the cosmos\nbecause the human being participates in both the movement of life and\nspirit, because each human being is an embodied spirit, i.e., a finite\nperson.\n\nThere are at least four ways in which Scheler distinguishes spirit\nfrom life.\n\n\n\nSpirit is the activity of objectivizing, a rendering of the world and\nof beings in terms of what they mean. Mere living beings, by contrast,\nrelate to objects in their environment not as objects, but as that\nwhich satisfies the drives. For example, for the living being, the\napple is experienced as merely something to fulfill one\u2019s\ndesire, whereas for the spiritual being, the apple is given as apple,\nas a kind of food.\n\n\nRelated to this first characteristic, is the value latent quality of\nspirit. The movement of spirit is the disclosure of value. According\nto Scheler, life-urge is value blind and is motivated solely by\ngreater fulfillment. Spirit is motivated by the good and is structured\naccording to agape, a charitable and self-sacrificing\nlove.\n\n\nSpirit is self-consciousness. Each living being, by virtue of having a\nbody, exhibits a type of body-consciousness, a relating of oneself to\nothers in a given environment. Spiritual beings not only can take\nthemselves to be objects of reflection, and thus can be critical of\nwho or what they have become, but are also aware of themselves as\nbeing seen by others, as having a different world of experience than\nothers.\n\n\nThe final distinguishing characteristic is spirit\u2019s quality of\nworld-openness. Spiritual beings are not restricted in their\nreflections to the here and now, or even to the specific context of\ntheir immediate life concerns. This type of world-openness is what is\ncaptured by the Greek sense of wonder, a metaphysical wonder and\nastonishment that there is something rather than nothing. Spiritual\nbeings are able to contemplate the meaning of being, time, death as\nwell as the purpose of existence itself. These are not merely\ntheoretical concerns, but that which transcends, or is beyond,\nlife.\n\n\nIt is the sense of spirit as world-open that leads Scheler to\nundertake his final reflections regarding the ground of all being or\nWeltgrund. These final reflections are taken not from a\nreligious perspective, but from a metaphysical one. In this final\nstage of his thought, Scheler becomes increasingly critical of\nreligion and finds that philosophy remains more true to the\nsignificance of the human being as world-open. Religion, writes\nScheler, tends to conceal this openness by positing some fixed or\nsecure notion of God (GW IX, 69). The radical openness that is spirit\nreveals, to the contrary, that the ground of all being is itself\ncaught up in a process of becoming. Scheler\u2019s understanding of\nGod also changes. In his later thought, God is a becoming that takes\nplace in and through the acts of all spiritual beings. It requires\ngreat courage to face a world that has no fixed meaning, a world whose\nmeaning hangs upon the actions of each and every human being.\n\nOutright rejected by Scheler is the creator God of the Judeo-Christian\ntradition. Spirit wholly lacks the power to create ex nihilo,\nand God as pure spirit is utterly powerless in this sense. The power\nof spirit lies in its ability to guide and direct the becoming of the\nworld. God did not create the world, but allowed it to become (GW XI,\n203). The world, i.e., life-urge, is the realizing factor of spirit\nand, in allowing the world to become, God makes it possible for\ngoodness to be realized. Hence, the becoming of the world is, by\nvirtue of God\u2019s love, agape. As the meeting place of\nspirit and life, the human being is responsible for the becoming of\nGod, and consequently for the realization of goodness. This task of\nthe realization of God is one and same as the task of the realization\nof the deeper spiritual values. As the deeper spiritual values are\nrealized, existence takes on a more meaningful form and ultimately\npoints to the deepest value, the divine. Scheler\u2019s metaphysics\nis the revelation of human responsibility in its most profound\ndesignation. Whether human existence is the expression of the divine\nor is merely relative to the basest of values depends solely on the\nmanner in which human beings take responsibility for a future that is\nopen. Rather than shift responsibility for the uncertain future to a\nparticular religious practice or dogma, each person must live out the\nwholly indeterminate becoming of the world, the human being and\nGod.\n\nScheler\u2019s commitment to the distinctive nature of the human\nbeing and to the two irreducible movements of the Weltgrund, spirit\nand life-urge, leaves his final thought in a kind of dualism. He is\nreadily aware of this and argues that his is a new type of dualism. It\ndoes not suffer from the problems introduced by the Cartesian dualism\nof mind and body. Yet, due in part to the unfinished nature of both\nhis philosophical anthropology and metaphysics, we are left with more\nquestions than answers about the relation between life and spirit. For\ninstance, how do spirit and life interact when life is value blind and\nspirit is powerless? How is the human being a unity when it\nparticipates in two essentially different movements? What is clear is\nthat these two movements constituting the unique place of the human\nbeing interpenetrate one another through a discourse of loving, the\neros of life and the agape of spirit. Through his or her\nexistence, the human beings is the unification of both forms of loving\nand is afforded the unique insights that arise through eros and\nagape. Scheler\u2019s attempt at a metaphysics is a more\nspeculative approach to an examination of human existence, but this\nspeculative move is motivated by a fuller understanding of the\noriginal and loving openness the human being bears to the world.\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nScheler occupies a precarious position in the history of the\nphenomenological movement. Unlike many of the giants in the tradition,\nScheler was not a student of the master, Husserl. Phenomenology is an\n\u201cattitude\u201d to which Scheler arrives after he completes his\nformal studies. His first published works are not, strictly speaking,\nphenomenological. Husserl and the phenomenological approach provided\nScheler access to phenomena he had previously only hinted at or viewed\nfrom afar, phenomena such as moral and emotional experience. When\nScheler was introduced to phenomenology, it was in its infancy, still\ndiscovering itself as a distinctive approach. Both of these factors,\nScheler\u2019s maturity as a philosopher and phenomenology\u2019s\nimmaturity as a movement, provided Scheler the freedom to develop\nphenomenology in his own unique style as well as to test its\nlimits.\n\nMany of the differences between Scheler and his fellow\nphenomenologists, whether in terms of style or content, could be\nattributed to a difference in their personalities. Yet, there are at\nleast notable and substantial differences between Scheler and other\nphenomenologists such as Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. For\nexample, Scheler draws a much sharper line between existence and\nspirit, between the real and the ideal, between object and act. This\ncan be seen most acutely in Scheler\u2019s understanding of the\nintuition of essences and how such an intuition participates in the\nbecoming-God. In terms of style, Scheler worked solely from insight\nand refused to follow any prescribed method or pedagogy. His tendency\nwas to move directly to the most profound or deepest of insights,\nrather than develop levels of phenomenological analysis, e.g., static\nand genetic, or hermeneutic. As a result, Scheler does not hesitate to\ntake up subjects such as ethics, politics and religion. This lack of\nmethod in Scheler is in part due to the foundational nature of the\nemotional life, his conviction that love is the ground for knowledge\n\u2013 a foundational relation in direct opposition to Husserl. If\nthere is a single point or thought that best captures the distinctive\nnature of Scheler\u2019s approach in contrast to that of his fellow\nphenomenologists, it is his notion of the human being as person. This\n\u201cchoice\u201d of human being as person in contrast to\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental ego, Heidegger\u2019s Dasein or\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s lived-body gives a particular directedness to\nScheler\u2019s thought, an emphasis on the personal dimension of\nexperience. Scheler\u2019s world is cast in a much different relief\nand as a consequence, is illuminated by such personal experiences as\nthe love of others and the divine.\n",
