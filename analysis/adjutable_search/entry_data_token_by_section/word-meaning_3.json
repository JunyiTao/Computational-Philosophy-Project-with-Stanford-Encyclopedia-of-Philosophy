Historical Background\n\nThe study of word meaning became a mature academic enterprise in the\n19th century, with the birth of historical-philological\nsemantics\n (Section 2.2).\n Yet, matters related to word meaning had been the subject of much\ndebate in earlier times. We can distinguish three major classical\napproaches to word meaning: speculative etymology, rhetoric, and\nclassical lexicography (Meier-Oeser 2011; Geeraerts 2013). We describe\nthem briefly in\n Section 2.1.\n",
