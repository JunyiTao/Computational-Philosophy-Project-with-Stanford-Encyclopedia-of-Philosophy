    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument || The Robot Reply\n4.2 The Robot Reply\n\nThe Robot Reply concedes Searle is right about the Chinese Room\nscenario: it shows that a computer trapped in a computer room cannot\nunderstand language, or know what words mean. The Robot reply is\nresponsive to the problem of knowing the meaning of the Chinese word\nfor hamburger \u2013 Searle\u2019s example of something the room\noperator would not know. It seems reasonable to hold that most of us\nknow what a hamburger is because we have seen one, and perhaps even\nmade one, or tasted one, or at least heard people talk about\nhamburgers and understood what they are by relating them to things we\ndo know by seeing, making, and tasting. Given this is how one might\ncome to know what hamburgers are, the Robot Reply suggests that we put\na digital computer in a robot body, with sensors, such as video\ncameras and microphones, and add effectors, such as wheels to move\naround with, and arms with which to manipulate things in the world.\nSuch a robot \u2013 a computer with a body \u2013 might do what a\nchild does, learn by seeing and doing. The Robot Reply holds that such\na digital computer in a robot body, freed from the room, could attach\nmeanings to symbols and actually understand natural language. Margaret\nBoden, Tim Crane, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, Stevan Harnad, Hans\nMoravec and Georges Rey are among those who have endorsed versions of\nthis reply at one time or another. The Robot Reply in effect appeals\nto \u201cwide content\u201d or \u201cexternalist semantics\u201d.\nThis can agree with Searle that syntax and internal connections in\nisolation from the world are insufficient for semantics, while holding\nthat suitable causal connections with the world can provide content to\nthe internal symbols. \n\nAbout the time Searle was pressing the CRA, many in philosophy of\nlanguage and mind were recognizing the importance of causal\nconnections to the world as the source of meaning or reference for\nwords and concepts. Hilary Putnam 1981 argued that a Brain in a Vat,\nisolated from the world, might speak or think in a language that\nsounded like English, but it would not be English \u2013 hence a\nbrain in a vat could not wonder if it was a brain in a vat (because of\nits sensory isolation, its words \u201cbrain\u201d and\n\u201cvat\u201d do not refer to brains or vats). The view that\nmeaning was determined by connections with the world became\nwidespread. Searle resisted this turn outward and continued to think\nof meaning as subjective and connected with consciousness. \n\nA related view that minds are best understood as embodied or embedded\nin the world has gained many supporters since the 1990s, contra\nCartesian solipsistic intuitions. Organisms rely on environmental\nfeatures for the success of their behavior. So whether one takes a\nmind to be a symbol processing system, with the symbols getting their\ncontent from sensory connections with the world, or a non-symbolic\nsystem that succeeds by being embedded in a particular environment,\nthe important of things outside the head have come to the fore. Hence\nmany are sympathetic to some form of the Robot Reply: a computational\nsystem might understand, provided it is acting in the world. E.g\nCarter 2007 in a textbook on philosophy and AI concludes \u201cThe\nlesson to draw from the Chinese Room thought experiment is that\nembodied experience is necessary for the development of\nsemantics.\u201d \n\nHowever Searle does not think that the Robot Reply to the Chinese Room\nargument is any stronger than the Systems Reply. All the sensors can\ndo is provide additional input to the computer \u2013 and it will be\njust syntactic input. We can see this by making a parallel change to\nthe Chinese Room scenario. Suppose the man in the Chinese Room\nreceives, in addition to the Chinese characters slipped under the\ndoor, a stream of binary digits that appear, say, on a ticker tape in\na corner of the room. The instruction books are augmented to use the\nnumerals from the tape as input, along with the Chinese characters.\nUnbeknownst to the man in the room, the symbols on the tape are the\ndigitized output of a video camera (and possibly other sensors).\nSearle argues that additional syntactic inputs will do nothing to\nallow the man to associate meanings with the Chinese characters. It is\njust more work for the man in the room.\n\nJerry Fodor, Hilary Putnam, and David Lewis, were principle architects\nof the computational theory of mind that Searle\u2019s wider argument\nattacks. In his original 1980 reply to Searle, Fodor allows Searle is\ncertainly right that \u201cinstantiating the same program as the\nbrain does is not, in and of itself, sufficient for having those\npropositional attitudes characteristic of the organism that has the\nbrain.\u201d But Fodor holds that Searle is wrong about the robot\nreply. A computer might have propositional attitudes if it has the\nright causal connections to the world \u2013 but those are not ones\nmediated by a man sitting in the head of the robot. We don\u2019t\nknow what the right causal connections are. Searle commits the fallacy\nof inferring from \u201cthe little man is not the right causal\nconnection\u201d to conclude that no causal linkage would succeed.\nThere is considerable empirical evidence that mental processes involve\n\u201cmanipulation of symbols\u201d; Searle gives us no alternative\nexplanation (this is sometimes called Fodor\u2019s \u201cOnly Game\nin Town\u201d argument for computational approaches). In the 1980s\nand 1990s Fodor wrote extensively on what the connections must be\nbetween a brain state and the world for the state to have intentional\n(representational) properties, while also emphasizing that\ncomputationalism has limits because the computations are intrinsically\nlocal and so cannot account for abductive reasoning.\n\nIn a later piece, \u201cYin and Yang in the Chinese Room\u201d (in\nRosenthal 1991 pp.524\u2013525), Fodor substantially revises his 1980\nview. He distances himself from his earlier version of the robot\nreply, and holds instead that \u201cinstantiation\u201d should be\ndefined in such a way that the symbol must be the proximate cause of\nthe effect \u2013 no intervening guys in a room. So Searle in the\nroom is not an instantiation of a Turing Machine, and\n\u201cSearle\u2019s setup does not instantiate the machine that the\nbrain instantiates.\u201d He concludes: \u201c\u2026Searle\u2019s\nsetup is irrelevant to the claim that strong equivalence to a Chinese\nspeaker\u2019s brain is ipso facto sufficient for speaking\nChinese.\u201d Searle says of Fodor\u2019s move, \u201cOf all the\nzillions of criticisms of the Chinese Room argument, Fodor\u2019s is\nperhaps the most desperate. He claims that precisely because the man\nin the Chinese room sets out to implement the steps in the computer\nprogram, he is not implementing the steps in the computer program. He\noffers no argument for this extraordinary claim.\u201d (in Rosenthal\n1991, p. 525)\n\nIn a 1986 paper, Georges Rey advocated a combination of the system and\nrobot reply, after noting that the original Turing Test is\ninsufficient as a test of intelligence and understanding, and that the\nisolated system Searle describes in the room is certainly not\nfunctionally equivalent to a real Chinese speaker sensing and acting\nin the world. In a 2002 second look, \u201cSearle\u2019s\nMisunderstandings of Functionalism and Strong AI\u201d, Rey again\ndefends functionalism against Searle, and in the particular form Rey\ncalls the \u201ccomputational-representational theory of thought\n\u2013 CRTT\u201d. CRTT is not committed to attributing thought to\njust any system that passes the Turing Test (like the Chinese Room).\nNor is it committed to a conversation manual model of understanding\nnatural language. Rather, CRTT is concerned with intentionality,\nnatural and artificial (the representations in the system are\nsemantically evaluable \u2013 they are true or false, hence have\naboutness). Searle saddles functionalism with the\n\u201cblackbox\u201d character of behaviorism, but functionalism\ncares how things are done. Rey sketches \u201ca modest mind\u201d\n\u2013 a CRTT system that has perception, can make deductive and\ninductive inferences, makes decisions on basis of goals and\nrepresentations of how the world is, and can process natural language\nby converting to and from its native representations. To explain the\nbehavior of such a system we would need to use the same attributions\nneeded to explain the behavior of a normal Chinese speaker.\n\nIf we flesh out the Chinese conversation in the context of the Robot\nReply, we may again see evidence that the entity that understands is\nnot the operator inside the room. Suppose we ask the robot system\nChinese translations of \u201cwhat do you see?\u201d, we might get\nthe answer \u201cMy old friend Shakey\u201d, or \u201cI see\nyou!\u201d. Whereas if we phone Searle in the room and ask the same\nquestions in English we might get \u201cThese same four walls\u201d\nor \u201cthese damn endless instruction books and notebooks.\u201d\nAgain this is evidence that we have distinct responders here, an\nEnglish speaker and a Chinese speaker, who see and do quite different\nthings. If the giant robot goes on a rampage and smashes much of\nTokyo, and all the while oblivious Searle is just following the\nprogram in his notebooks in the room, Searle is not guilty of homicide\nand mayhem, because he is not the agent committing the acts. \n\nTim Crane discusses the Chinese Room argument in his 1991 book,\nThe Mechanical Mind. He cites the Churchlands\u2019 luminous\nroom analogy, but then goes on to argue that in the course of\noperating the room, Searle would learn the meaning of the Chinese:\n\u201c\u2026if Searle had not just memorized the rules and the\ndata, but also started acting in the world of Chinese people, then it\nis plausible that he would before too long come to realize what these\nsymbols mean.\u201d(127). (Rapaport 2006 presses an analogy between\nHelen Keller and the Chinese Room.) Crane appears to end with a\nversion of the Robot Reply: \u201cSearle\u2019s argument itself begs\nthe question by (in effect) just denying the central thesis of AI\n\u2013 that thinking is formal symbol manipulation. But\nSearle\u2019s assumption, none the less, seems to me correct \u2026\nthe proper response to Searle\u2019s argument is: sure,\nSearle-in-the-room, or the room alone, cannot understand Chinese. But\nif you let the outside world have some impact on the room, meaning or\n\u2018semantics\u2019 might begin to get a foothold. But of course,\nthis concedes that thinking cannot be simply symbol\nmanipulation.\u201d (129) The idea that learning grounds\nunderstanding has led to work in developmental robotics (a.k.a.\nepigenetic robotics). This AI research area seeks to replicate key\nhuman learning abilities, such as robots that are shown an object from\nseveral angles while being told in natural language the name of the\nobject. \n\nMargaret Boden 1988 also argues that Searle mistakenly supposes\nprograms are pure syntax. But programs bring about the activity of\ncertain machines: \u201cThe inherent procedural consequences of any\ncomputer program give it a toehold in semantics, where the semantics\nin question is not denotational, but causal.\u201d (250) Thus a robot\nmight have causal powers that enable it to refer to a hamburger.\n\nStevan Harnad also finds important our sensory and motor capabilities:\n\u201cWho is to say that the Turing Test, whether conducted in\nChinese or in any other language, could be successfully passed without\noperations that draw on our sensory, motor, and other higher cognitive\ncapacities as well? Where does the capacity to comprehend Chinese\nbegin and the rest of our mental competence leave off?\u201d Harnad\nbelieves that symbolic functions must be grounded in\n\u201crobotic\u201d functions that connect a system with the world.\nAnd he thinks this counts against symbolic accounts of mentality, such\nas Jerry Fodor\u2019s, and, one suspects, the approach of Roger\nSchank that was Searle\u2019s original target. Harnad 2012 (Other\nInternet Resources) argues that the CRA shows that even with a robot\nwith symbols grounded in the external world, there is still something\nmissing: feeling, such as the feeling of understanding.\n\nHowever Ziemke 2016 argues a robotic embodiment with layered systems\nof bodily regulation may ground emotion and meaning, and Seligman 2019\nargues that \u201cperceptually grounded\u201d approaches to natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) have the \u201cpotential to display\nintentionality, and thus after all to foster a truly meaningful\nsemantics that, in the view of Searle and other skeptics, is\nintrinsically beyond computers\u2019 capacity.\u201d \n",
