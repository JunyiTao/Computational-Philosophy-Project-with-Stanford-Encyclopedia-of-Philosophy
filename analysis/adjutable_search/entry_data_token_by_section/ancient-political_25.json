    "main_text": "Political Philosophy in the Roman Empire || Later Stoicism\n7.1 Later Stoicism\n\nIf Cicero as a new man made senator had to contend with the\ncompetitive pressures of republican politics, Seneca (c. 3\nBCE\u201365 CE), as a new man (from Spain) made senator a century\nlater, had to contend with the problem of advising, and surviving, the\npoisonous politics of intimacy with the princeps. For Seneca,\nStoic philosophy (of which he was an avowed exponent, though other\nphilosophical influences can also be found in his ideas), can be best\nsquared with politics if the ruler is supremely virtuous: in that\ncase, the Stoic wise man is the king or prince.\n\nLike Cicero, Seneca wrote essays in natural as well as political\nphilosophy, including for example a significant analysis of the give\nand take of benefits or reciprocal gifts and favors in political life\n(De beneficiis, recently translated afresh by Griffin and\nInwood, 2011), and even a De officiis (which is lost). Like\nCicero, he wrote important collections of letters (and where Cicero\nwrote poetry, Seneca also wrote plays). The letters include his\ndistinctive \u201cconsolations\u201d which would inaugurate a new\nphilosophical and literary genre (see the entry on\n Seneca).\n\nIn this large corpus, arguably his most important surviving work for\npolitical philosophy is his De clementia (\u201cOn\nMercy\u201d), addressed to the emperor Nero whom he served as tutor\n(in rhetoric, not in philosophy) and later in the capacity of\nofficially designated amicus or friend (Veyne 2003, vii, 19).\nPresented as a \u201cmirror\u201d in which Nero could see himself\nand the consequences of his virtue (1.1.1), this text would become a\nfountainhead of the \u201cmirror for princes\u201d genre in\nsubsequent centuries. The challenge was how to reconcile the virtue of\njustice with that of clementia, clemency or mercy, a\ndistinctively Roman virtue (not corresponding exactly to any Greek\nword: Braund 2009, 33) that had been incorporated into public life as\na virtue of the Roman people (clementia populi Romani) and\nattributed specifically in cultic form to Caesar Augustus (previously\nOctavian) as clementia Caesaris (included as one of\n\u201cthe four virtues attributed to Augustus on an honorific\nshield,\u201d as observed by Griffin 2000: 540; see more generally\nFlamerie de Lachapelle 2011). Appealing to the related Stoic virtue of\nphilanthr\u00f4pia in Greek, humanitas in Latin, or\nlove of humankind, Seneca claimed that, by taking into account all the\ncircumstances of the affair, clemency can claim to embody, as it were,\na more perfect justice (iustissimum), than would the\nobservance of the strict letter of the law (2.7.3, as discussed by\nBraund 2009, 66\u201370).\n\nSeneca manages to defend clemency\u2019s claim to the rank of virtue\nby distinguishing it both from its opposite, crudelitas or\ncruelty, and from a related disposition, misericordia, pity\nor compassion, which for the Stoics counted as a vice (2.4.4). The\nStoic sage will exercise clemency by attending to the circumstances\nand causes of the criminal\u2019s act, but also by seeking in various\nways to improve the latter\u2019s character (1.14.1\u20133,\n1.16.1\u20133), an approach that goes back at least to Plato\n(Prt. 324a\u2013c, Grg.469a\u2013b), doing so with\nparsimony and discernment between those who are curable and those who\nare not (again with Plato, Grg.525a\u2013526b). Indeed,\nSeneca asserts that those who are curable will generally strive\nsubsequently to become worthy of the clemency shown to them by the\nprince (2.2.1), a principle illustrated by the story of\nAugustus\u2019 clemency toward the conspirator Cnaeus Cornelius\nCinna, who would become his lifelong friend (1.9). In good Stoic\nfashion, Seneca finally shows that the virtue of clemency is both\nvaluable in itself and also beneficial. It sustains the rule of a\nprince by inspiring love in his subjects (1.19.6), whereas cruelty\naugments the number of his enemies (1.8.7). And conversely, whereas\nmisericordia wallows in a wrongful and inefficient emotional\npity for the treatment that justice would prescribe of the criminal\n(2.6.1), clemency improves the criminal more efficiently than cruelty\nwould do (1.22.1), and for this and other reasons better aims at the\ngood of mankind. It is worth noting finally that, while Seneca\nspecifies that clemency should also extend to slaves, his\ncosmopolitanism stopped short of advocating their manumission or the\nabolition of slavery (Griffin 1992:\n 256\u201385).[15]\n\nSeneca did not limit himself to the political function of advising\nrulers. Instead, he conceived the role of philosophy as benefiting\npeople generally, in the widest sense of a cosmopolitan ethics and\neven politics. His De otio (\u201cOn Leisure\u201d)\ncontrasts the single commonwealth embracing gods and men in a cosmic\ncitizenship, with the ordinary multiple commonwealths to which the\naccidents of birth assign us (though these also rightly command\nallegiance) (4.1). Should such an ordinary regime turn lethal, the\nphilosopher remains a citizen of the cosmic commonwealth, and so his\nserenity can and should remain intact. That fate befell Seneca himself\nin 65 CE, when Nero accused him of conspiring in a planned\nassassination of the emperor and ordered him to commit suicide. To be\nsure, however, Seneca\u2019s suicide reflected not only political\nobedience, but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, the belief,\npreviously expressed in his writings (in particular De\nprovidentia and De ira, as well as his letters) that\nsuicide is a supreme mark of freedom. No tyranny can so enslave us as\nto take away this freedom: a freedom to act based on the inner\nliberation of realizing that death and other worldly losses are in\nfact indifferent and irrelevant to happiness (Inwood 2005:\n307\u20139).\n\nSeneca was far from the only Stoic politically active in his day or in\nsuccessive generations. Others like Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus\nunder Nero, Helvidius Priscus under Vespasian, and Paconius Agrippinus\nunder Tiberius, chose to defy those whom they saw as tyrannical\nrulers, becoming known as the so-called \u2018Stoic martyrs\u2019.\n(On the varieties of Stoicism under the principate, see the classic\nstudy of Brunt 2013, originally published in 1975.) Some Stoics spoke\nout against a wider range of customs that they took to be cruel or\nunfounded or otherwise irrational, most notably Musonius Rufus against\nsuch practices as the Athenians\u2019 holding of gladiatorial games\nin the same theatre of Dionysus where they celebrated religious\nfestivals (assuming that it is indeed he who is described in Dio\nChrysostom\u2019s Orationes XXXI, 122), and against the\nsocial convention of excluding women from philosophizing (for his\nfragments, see King 2011). Yet these later Stoics made rather few\ndetailed contributions to political philosophy, even if their\nfundamental analysis of living according to nature and reason, as\nfurther developed by figures ranging from the once-enslaved Epictetus\nto the emperor Marcus Aurelius, remained an important touchstone for\nthinking about politics.\n",
