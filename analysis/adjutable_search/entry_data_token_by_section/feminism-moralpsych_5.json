    "main_text": "Responsibility || Responsibility of the Oppressed for Immorality\n3.4 Responsibility of the Oppressed for Immorality\n\nThe issue of whether the oppressed are responsible for immorality can\nbe broken down into two questions: Are the oppressed free from\nresponsibility for immoral acts unrelated to their own oppression on\nthe grounds that their socialization plays some role in their acting\nimmorally? Are the oppressed responsible for contributing to their own\noppression by not resisting it? This section takes up the first\nquestion; Section 3.5 takes up the second question.\n\nWhile earlier, non-feminist philosophical treatments of an\nindividual\u2019s responsibility for her or his own behavior have\ntypically focused on the role an individual has played in causing a\ncertain outcome, more recent discussions, particularly by race\ntheorists and to a lesser extent feminists, shift away from causation\ntalk and acknowledge the significance of the influence of social\nforces on an agent\u2019s actions and the degree to which they might\nmitigate the agent\u2019s responsibility for her or his actions. It\nis striking, however, that feminists have had little to say about\nlessening women\u2019s responsibility for their immoral\nactions when the reasons women act are largely influenced by their\ntreatment under patriarchy. Some race theorists, though, have\ndiscussed this issue. I. A. Menkiti, for instance, explores how social\ndeviants, or, psychopaths come to be (1977\u20131978). Menkiti\ndefines a psychopath as one who is outside morality in the sense that\nhe does not care about others or accept responsibility, and feels no\nguilt, regret, shame, or remorse. Menkiti argues that some psychopaths\nhave been made into the beings they are by social injustice that\ngenerates economic deprivation for people in their group, which\nconstantly challenges their self-esteem, causing them to go through a\nseries of stages from that of resentment, to that of embitterment, to\nthat of moral death (227\u2013230). Menkiti argues that the community\nis at least partly responsible for the behavior of psychopaths who\nriot or gang bang in response both to unbearable poverty brought about\nby conscious discrimination directed at them in virtue of their group\nmembership, and to institutionalized racial exclusion. This is because\nthe community plays a significant role in their becoming psychopaths.\nMenkiti believes that it is unfair to blame individuals for primarily\ninstitutional failures (236). He muses that philosophers have shied\naway from this kind of collective responsibility because it traces the\ncausal connection too far, but he urges that it makes just as much\nsense to consider society a culprit as it does to say that societies\nare victims of crimes and that there are debts owed to society\n(237).\n\nThe paucity of feminist discussion of this kind of argument as applied\nto women may be due partly to the view that women\u2019s response to\ntheir oppression typically has been to internalize it by acquiring\ndeformed desires (see Section 2) and adopting stereotypical traits and\nroles such as becoming servile. Such behaviors do not strike many of\nus as being as immoral as rioting and gang banging, and if they are\nnot immoral, then the question about whether women are unfairly held\nresponsible for them does not even arise. Indeed, feminists have had\nto make a special case that, for instance, a woman\u2019s adopting\nstereotypical traits and roles is immoral because it harms women as a\ngroup (see Section 3.5), or that servility is immoral because it\nviolates a duty to be self-respecting, as Kant believed. Some\nfeminists even reject these views. Cynthia Stark argues against\nKant\u2019s view that any rational being would on reflection see\nhimself as an end in itself. Stark points out that characters like the\nDeferential Wife have deeply socially (patriarchally) constituted\nidentities that are often incompatible with a conception of themselves\nas persons (1997, 76\u201377). She argues that Kant\u2019s view is\ntoo harsh in not taking into account the agent\u2019s circumstances,\nexpecting everyone to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be\nself-respecting.\n\nPaul Benson is one feminist who makes this point about the\nagent\u2019s circumstances and relates it to women\u2019s\nresponsibility for immoral action (2000, 79\u201385). Benson argues\nfor imposing a self-worth condition on responsibility. He argues that\nin order for an agent to be morally responsible, it must be the case\nthat we can hold her responsible for her actions. For this, a person\nhas to be worthy of a social standing, that of an eligible participant\nin moral exchanges that involve, for example, offering reasons,\nseeking to be excused, begging forgiveness, and blaming someone. Being\na participant in such moral exchanges requires that the person respond\nto moral treatment such as blame, and that she recognize the\nlegitimacy of this demand. It is appropriate to hold someone\nresponsible just in case it is appropriate to hold the person to the\ndemand for a suitable response, but, significantly for feminist\npurposes, it requires that the person to whom the response is directed\ndoes not regard herself as unworthy of this kind of moral exchange.\nOne factor that can interfere with the agent\u2019s regard for her\nown worth, according to Benson, is the internalization of oppressive\nsocial norms. Not having proper regard for one\u2019s own worth may\ninvolve not believing that it is one\u2019s place to take\nresponsibility for one\u2019s actions. In such cases, it is not\nappropriate to hold these agents fully responsible for their actions.\nOne feature distinguishing Benson\u2019s account from non-feminist\naccounts of responsibility that determine responsibility on the basis\nof features like having a capacity for critical reflection, being able\nto make choices, and knowing what one is doing, is the fact that\nBenson\u2019s account is sensitive to a person\u2019s sense of her\nworth as it is affected by internalizing oppressive social norms.\n\nBenson himself believes that his account of responsibility is feminist\nbecause it is relational, which means that it reflects our connections\nto others instead of reflecting a view of persons that many feminists\nreject, namely, as abstract, individualistic, or atomistic\nself-governing and self-sufficient agents. Benson cites several ways\nin which his account is relational. One is that it requires that the\nagent have a sufficient account of her worth to be accountable to\nothers, and this requires that there be others. More specifically, the\naccount expects a person to speak for her own actions to others, which\nis necessary for becoming a responsible agent and acquiring the right\nsense of her worth. One \u201cmakes oneself\u201d in an\ninterpersonal context, which many feminists take to be necessary for\nmoral agency. A second reason Benson\u2019s account is relational,\nand so feminist, is that publicly shareable norms govern the\nagent\u2019s actions and her own account of them to others.\nSubordination and domination threaten this account of norms, Benson\nargues, by making it impossible for persons to understand how they\ncould defend or excuse their own conduct. Third, being responsible is\na matter of having the status of being an eligible participant in a\ncommunity of moral dialogue in which the parties regard themselves as\nbeing in a position to speak for their own agency in response to\ncriticism from others, and can hold themselves responsible. If we\nexempt women from responsibility, Benson worries, we fail at least in\nsome cases to respect their status as equal participants in this\ndialogue, which is sexist. So if a woman recognizes herself as having\nintrinsic worth and being able to speak for her own agency, it would\nbe disrespectful and sexist not to hold her responsible.\n\nBenson suggests that mitigating women\u2019s responsibility for\nimmoral action runs the risk of undermining women\u2019s moral\nagency. This might be another reason for the scarcity of feminist\ndiscussion about the role of socialization in women\u2019s\nresponsibility for immoral action. The worry is that if an agent is\nunder the sway of her socialization or circumstances, she seems to be\na mere pawn who does not or cannot take control over her actions.\nAbsolving women from responsibility for their behavior not only risks\ndenying their agency, but risks perpetuating sexist stereotypes. This\nis what worries Wanda Teays about using the excusing model of\nself-defense for abused women who kill their abusers (1998,\n61\u201364). Under this model, an abused woman is excused from\nkilling her abuser either because she did not realize that she was\nviolating the law, or because she could not prevent herself from\nbreaking it presumably because she was under the sway of her emotions.\nIn either case, the focus is on her, the actor, excusing her because\nof some characteristic she possesses or her state of mind, implying\nthat she is mentally impaired or not reasonable. Teays favors the\njustifying model, which acknowledges that the woman is reasonable in\nthe sense that there is nothing wrong with her or her reasoning\nskills, and that she responds appropriately, given her circumstances.\nThis model neither compromises the woman\u2019s agency nor\nperpetuates sexist stereotypes about women\u2019s mental states. It\ndescribes these women not as being under the sway of their emotions,\nbut as being able to determine in a rational way when self-defense is\nwarranted. Feminists might apply this model more generally to explain\nthe relevance of women\u2019s circumstances to their responsibility\nor blameworthiness for acting immorally.\n\nOne such view, though not put forward as a feminist one, is offered by\nSarah Buss in response to Susan Wolf\u2019s case of the Victim of a\nDeprived Childhood. Wolf argues that such a person, who was given no\nlove and was beaten by his father and neglected by his mother, is not\nresponsible for embezzling money later in life (1986). Although he has\nfeatures that typically would make him responsible, such as not being\ncoerced, being in control of his behavior, and having a normal faculty\nof reason, he is absolved from responsibility because he could not\nhave had reason to act morally instead of embezzling. This is\nbecause, despite there being reasons for acting morally, the reasons\nthe Victim of a Deprived Childhood has are determined by his\ncircumstances. That is, there are reasons not to embezzle, but this\nkind of agent, due to his circumstances, fails to see, and cannot\nreasonably be expected to see, that there are such moral reasons. To\novercome his background and see that there are moral reasons not to\nembezzle, he would have to have a certain kind of sensibility and\nperception that he lacks. Since we cannot reasonably expect this kind\nof agent to see that there is reason not to embezzle, and because the\nreasons he does see are determined by his circumstances, Wolf believes\nthat his actions stemming from these reasons are determined, so he is\nneither blameworthy nor responsible for embezzling. However, the view\nthat one\u2019s reasons are determined by one\u2019s circumstances\nthreatens a view of moral agency according to which a person can\nfreely choose among available reasons. Were feminists to draw the same\nconclusion about women who internalize their own oppression such as\nthe Deferential Wife described above (Section 1), they would run into\nthe worry about denying women moral agency.\n\nSarah Buss argues against Wolf\u2019s view in a way that is not\nagency-denying, because rather than appealing to the agent\u2019s\ncircumstances as determining his reasons, Buss believes that such\ncircumstances give this kind of agent a justified failure to\n\u201ctell right from wrong\u201d (1997). Buss embellishes\nWolf\u2019s example of the Victim, who as a child came into contact\nmostly with people who either beat him, supported those who beat him,\nor ignored his misery. Whenever the victim was beaten, he was first\ntaunted. Years later, when he is taunted with a threatening comment,\nhe hits his taunter. Buss believes that the Victim is responsible for\nhitting his taunter, since there are moral reasons not to hit one who\ntaunts you: hitting one\u2019s taunter is morally wrong. But Buss\nbelieves that the Victim is justified in hitting his taunter because\nhe has excusing reasons to act thusly, which are grounded in his\ncircumstances. Excusing reasons free him and other similar agents from\nblame, at least in certain circumstances, depending on the nature of\nthe wrongdoing, whether there are alternative actions available, and\nthe details of his background. Generally speaking, he can be absolved\nfrom blame because he has a justified failure to tell right\nfrom wrong\u2014anyone in his circumstances has reason to act the way\nhe does, even though they also have reason not to act immorally. Buss\ndefends what she calls \u201cthe Basic Intuition,\u201d according to\nwhich \u201csimply because they have exceptional backgrounds, certain\nwrongdoers have a different moral status from that of more\n\u2018privileged\u2019 wrongdoers who perform the very same type of\nacts\u201d (337). A person would have to be truly exceptional not to\nsee things as the Victim sees them and write off his experiences as\nones not indicative of human nature. Buss offers this analogy: the\nVictim no more has good reason for thinking that his taunter is not\nlike the hostile people he grew up around, than does the person who\nhas been bitten repeatedly by dogs has good reason to think that the\ngrowling dog in her path will not bite her (350). The Basic Intuition\nattributes to the victim not an incapacity for making the correct\nmoral distinctions, but a justified failure to \u201ctell right from\nwrong.\u201d He has excusing reasons for acting as he does.\nBuss\u2019s non-deterministic argument might be employed by feminists\nas an agency-protecting way of absolving women from blame for certain\nimmoral acts. They might also use it to absolve women from\nresponsibility, if they can show that the acts in question are in\nthemselves justified, perhaps by showing that they are legitimate\nresponses to threats to a person\u2019s intrinsic value (see Superson\n2010).\n",
