    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy in Chile, as in the rest of Latin America, has been an\nacademic pursuit ever since the conquest and settlement of the New\nWorld by Spain and Portugal in the early sixteenth century. Very few\nphilosophers ventured beyond the walls of academic or religious\ninstitutions (usually one and the same) during the entire colonial\nperiod, which ended in most Spanish American countries (the exceptions\nbeing Cuba and Puerto Rico) in the early nineteenth century. Even\nafter Independence, philosophy remained a fundamentally academic\nendeavor. Chile, in contrast to other nations in the region, has shown\nremarkable institutional continuity, with the exception of the years\nof military rule in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nThe academic context in which the discipline developed, however, has\nnot prevented philosophers from engaging in social and political\nactivities, and, especially, in debates concerning the history,\nculture and direction of the emerging nations. Philosophers have been\nimportant political figures since the early republic as well as\nleaders in the university reform processes that have taken place\nduring the country\u2019s modern history. During the period of\nmilitary rule (1973\u20131990) several became important opponents of\nthe regime. A concern for politics, in fact, has dominated the agenda\nof philosophers, including those who have denounced the encroachment\nof politics in the discipline.\n\nThe centrality of politics, even in cases of direct involvement in it,\nhas not distracted philosophers from their essential commitment to\nexploring different philosophical (predominantly European) schools,\nsome specific fields within the discipline, such as logic and\nmetaphysics, and some thematic concerns like the role of religion in a\nsecular state, the impact of modernity on self and society, and the\nrole of universities in the development of nationhood. Chilean\nphilosophy is characterized by a constant tension between academic\npursuits solely informed by developments within the discipline, and\ncritical outlooks that demand a closer philosophical engagement with\npolitics and society.\n",
