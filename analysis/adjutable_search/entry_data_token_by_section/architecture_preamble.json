    "main_text": "\nThis article offers an overview of issues in the philosophy of\narchitecture. Central issues include foundational matters regarding\nthe nature of:\n\nArchitecture as an artform, design medium, or other product or\npractice.\nArchitectural objects\u2014what sorts of things they are; how\nthey differ from other sorts of objects; and how we define the range\nof such objects.\nSpecial architectural properties, like the standard trio of\nstructural integrity (firmitas), beauty, and utility\u2014or\nspace, light, and form; and ways they might be special to\narchitecture.\nArchitectural types\u2014how to consider abstract groups of\narchitectural objects and their instances.\nMeaning and other language-like phenomena in architecture and its\nobjects.\nFormation of and warrant for our basic grasp, and considered\njudgment, of architectural objects.\nSocial and moral features of architectural objects and\narchitectural practice.\n\nYet other questions engage applied philosophical concerns regarding\narchitecture, such as the character of architectural notation;\nintellectual property rights; and client-architect obligations.\nA far-reaching philosophy of architecture extends beyond even a\nbroadly aesthetics-based assessment, to include considerations of\nethics, social and political philosophy, and philosophical reflections\non psychology and the behavioral sciences. The aesthetics of\narchitecture, by itself, spans traditional issues mooted in philosophy\nof art, as well as aesthetics of the everyday, and environmental\naesthetics. Such traditional issues include the nature of the work;\nthe possibility of classes, kinds, or types in the domain; the\ncharacter and roles of representation, intentionality, and expression;\nand the warranted foundations for criticism. The ethics of\narchitecture also addresses traditional issues, including delineation\nof rights, responsibilities, the good, virtues, and justice in\narchitectural milieus. Still other aspects of philosophy of\narchitecture concern social and technological characteristics.\n",
