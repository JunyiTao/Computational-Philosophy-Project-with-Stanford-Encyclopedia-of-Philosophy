Yet citizens are not indifferent to how the\nbenefits and burdens of cooperation will be divided amongst them.\nRawls\u2019s principles of justice as fairness articulate the central\nliberal ideas that cooperation should be fair to all citizens regarded\nas free and as equals. The distinctive interpretation that Rawls gives\nto these concepts can be seen as combining a negative and a positive\nthesis.\n\nRawls\u2019s negative thesis starts with the idea that citizens do\nnot deserve to be born into a rich or a poor family, to be born\nnaturally more or less gifted than others, to be born female or male,\nto be born a member of a particular racial group, and so on. Since\nthese features of persons are morally arbitrary in this sense,\ncitizens are not entitled to more of the benefits of social\ncooperation simply because of them. For example, the fact that a\ncitizen was born rich, white, and male provides no reason in itself\nfor this citizen to be favored by social institutions.\n\nThis negative thesis does not say how social goods should be\ndistributed; it merely clears the decks. Rawls\u2019s positive\ndistributive thesis is equality-based reciprocity. All social goods\nare to be distributed equally, unless an unequal distribution would be\nto everyone\u2019s advantage. The guiding idea is that since citizens\nare fundamentally equal, reasoning about justice should begin from a\npresumption that cooperatively-produced goods should be equally\ndivided. Justice then requires that any inequalities must benefit all\ncitizens, and particularly must benefit those who will have the least.\nEquality sets the baseline; from there any inequalities must improve\neveryone\u2019s situation, and especially the situation of the\nworst-off. These strong requirements of equality and reciprocal\nadvantage are hallmarks of Rawls\u2019s theory of justice.\n",
