    "main_text": "Epistemic Sentimentalism || The Perceptual Model\n5.1 The Perceptual Model\n\nTalk of a moral sense suggests an epistemic picture according to which\nmoral knowledge is similar to knowledge acquired by other senses. We\nsimply attend to something real or imagined, and immediately, without\nany kind of reasoning, just know whether it\u2019s right or wrong,\njust as we come to know the colour or shape of a car just by looking\nat it. And it is no doubt often the case that belief in the presence\nof the wrong-making natural properties (such as intentionally causing\nexcruciating pain to a whimpering dog) triggers an emotional reaction\nin us. It is plausible, and supported by empirical data\n (see Section 2.1),\n that the emotional response often precedes and perhaps causes the\nmoral judgment. But is it a perception or something analogous?\n\nIn the case of ordinary perceptual experience, an object instantiates\nan observable property, such as being red, and this causes us (in the\nright way) to have a corresponding phenomenal representation of the\nobject, such as a visual experience of a red object in front of us\n(Audi 2013). Many believe that this experience is not itself a belief:\nI can believe that a stick in the water is straight while it\nnevertheless perceptually appears to me that it is not straight.\nHowever, ordinarily having a perceptual experience provides\njustification for a corresponding belief, either because it presents\nor represents things as being in a particular way (as epistemological\ninternalists think) or because it reliably informs us of them being\nthat way (as epistemological externalists think), or a combination of\nthese. Epistemologists debate whether justification requires only the\nabsence of defeaters or also some type of warrant to rule out\nskeptical scenarios, and what needs to be added for a true belief to\namount to knowledge.\n\nSo is there such a thing as emotional moral perception? The answer\ndepends, in part, on the nature of emotions. On Hume\u2019s view, a\npassion is \u201can original existence\u201d which \u201ccontains\nnot any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other\nexistence\u201d (T 415). If this is the case, then emotional\nexperience cannot justify belief the same way contentful perceptual\nexperience does. However, most contemporary epistemic sentimentalists\nreject Hume\u2019s theory of emotions. Instead, they subscribe to\nsome variety of a representational theory of emotions, motivated by\nthe thought that emotions can be assessed as appropriate or fitting or\neven rational (de Sousa 1987). This suggests that emotions are\nabout something \u2013 that they have intentional\ncontent.\n\nOne representational theory holds that emotions involve or consist in\na judgment that the target of the emotion (such as flying on\nan airplane) has the property that is the formal object of\nthe emotion (such as being fearsome or dangerous in the case of fear)\n(Kenny 1963; Lyons 1980). Sabine Roeser (2011) defends this type of\naccount in the moral case. According to her, moral emotions are\n\u201cat the same time both value judgments and affective\nstates\u201d (Roeser 2011: 149). On her view, they constitute\nintuitions just in the same sense as traditional intuitionists claim:\nthey are direct apprehensions of non-natural states of affairs. (This\nis a clear case in which epistemic and metaphysical variants of\nsentimentalism come apart.) Any view of this type faces the challenge\nof explaining why our emotions would reliably track such non-natural\nfacts. The other worry is that value judgments in general are not\nself-justifying, so it is not clear why judgments embedded in emotion\nwould justify further belief.\n\nIn any case, it is a well-known problem with judgmental theories of\nemotion that emotions can be recalcitrant, that is, come\napart from our judgments. We can be worried in spite of judging that\neverything is alright. Moreover, many think that children or animals\ncan have emotions without possessing evaluative concepts, and thus\nwithout being capable of making evaluative judgments. Such\nconsiderations lead many to regard emotions as being or containing or\nbeing analogous to perceptual experiences (de Sousa 1987;\nTappolet 2000, 2011; Helm 2001; Prinz 2004, 2007; Zagzebski 2003;\nGoldie 2007; D\u00f6ring 2007; Wisnewski 2015). On this type of view,\nemotions and perceptual experiences have many common features: they\nare spontaneous (not under direct volitional control), informationally\nencapsulated (that is, relatively independent from the subject\u2019s\nbeliefs and desires), have a characteristic phenomenology, and have\nconceptual (and/or non-conceptual) content, thus representing or\nconstruing the world as being in a certain way without involving\njudgment or belief.\n\nOn perceptualist views, emotions are the closest thing we have to\nacquaintance with value \u2013 for example, as Adam Pelser puts it,\n\u201cto experience something as funny just is to be amused by\nit\u201d (2014: 112). Just as colour-blind people may know on the\nbasis of testimony that an object is red without being acquainted with\nits redness, a person who is incapable of awe may learn from others\nthat something is sublime while lacking an acquaintance with or direct\naccess to its sublimity (ibid.). Analogous claims have also been\ndefended about the nature of desire, which is held by many to\nbe a non-doxastic appearance of the good (Stampe 1987; Oddie 2005;\nTenenbaum 2007; Sinhababu 2017). Perceptualists tend to hold that the\ndistinctive feature of emotional perception is that the content is\nevaluative, which in turn is often thought to explain the special\nphenomenology. However, Julien Deonna and Fabrice Teroni (2015) have\nrecently argued that the evaluative character of emotions should be\nunderstood in terms of bodily attitudes rather than\nevaluative content (for criticism, see Mitchell forthcoming). (For\nmore on debates about the nature of emotion, see the\n entry on emotion.)\n\nGiven the perceptualist metaphysical claim about emotions, many have\nargued for the following kind of epistemic thesis:\n\n\nEpistemic Emotional Perceptualism (EEP): Emotions are sources of\nimmediate (non-inferential) prima facie (or defeasible) justification\nfor evaluative propositions. (cf. Carter 2019)\n\n\nIf Epistemic Emotional Perceptualism is true, emotions can play a\nfoundational role in moral epistemology - they (or their contents) can\npotentially justify belief in moral propositions independently of the\ncontents of one\u2019s other beliefs, just as my perceptual\nexperience as of a black dog in front of me can potentially justify\nbelief in the corresponding proposition, regardless of what I believed\nbefore (see e.g. D\u00f6ring 2007, Pelser 2014). To be sure, it is\npossible to hold a compromise position, according to which the\njustification provided by emotions is sufficient to justify belief\nonly if it also coheres with one\u2019s other beliefs, as van Roojen\n(2014) notes.\n\nHowever, as Robert Cowan (2016) emphasizes, EEP isn\u2019t entailed\nby perceptualism about emotion, since the metaphysical differences\nbetween emotions and paradigm perceptual experiences might make for an\nepistemic difference, as indeed many have argued. So it is worth\nasking just why emotions would be sources of justification, even if\nthey are analogous to, or a distinct species of, perceptual\nexperience. Christine Tappolet argues that since prima facie\njustification is such a minimal epistemic status, it is easy to\nattain: \u201cIf you are afraid of a dog, it is surely something that\nmakes your belief that the dog is fearsome prima facie\njustified.\u201d (Tappolet 2016: 40) However, if we are to be\njustified in believing on the basis of emotional experience, whatever\njustification they offer must be strong enough to suffice for belief.\nSome principled explanation for this is needed. The simplest way would\nbe to hold that any appearance of things being in a certain way can\nyield sufficient, if defeasible justification, as Michael\nHuemer\u2019s (2001) epistemic liberalism has it. Insofar as\nfear, for example, presents its target as being fearsome (or\ndangerous), it would justify the corresponding evaluative belief in\nthe absence of defeaters (see Tucker (ed.) 2013).\n\nWhile there is thus a plausible (if controversial) epistemic framework\nthat would account for EEP, there are a number of serious challenges\nto it. After all, even proponents of the perceptualist account of\nemotion grant that there are a number of notable differences between\nemotions and sensory perceptual experiences (Tappolet 2016). Some of\nthese differences may be epistemically relevant. To begin with, there\nseems to be an obvious difference in our everyday epistemic practice:\nwe don\u2019t typically ask for reasons for perceptual experiences,\nbut we do ask for reasons for emotions (Brady 2013). For example, if\nyou say you see a dog outside, I\u2019m unlikely to ask\n\u201cWhy?\u201d, while if you say you\u2019re afraid of the dog,\nit makes perfect sense to ask the question. Conversely, if I ask you\nwhy you think the bridge is dangerous, you\u2019re unlikely to say\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid of it\u201d, while you might well\nappealing to having seen the dog outside to justify your belief that\nit is there. As Michael Brady puts it, unlike sensory perceptions,\nemotions raise rather than silence justificatory demands (2013: 110).\nWhat\u2019s more, he maintains, if an emotion like fear justified\nbelief about dangerousness, it would be objectionably self-justifying,\nsince danger merits fear, and \u201cThe very fact that I am afraid of\nthe dog cannot, by itself, be evidence that it is fitting or\nappropriate to be afraid of the dog\u201d (Brady 2010, 123).\n\nHow might epistemic perceptualists respond? One possibility is to\nemphasize a salient difference between emotions and sense perceptions:\nemotions have cognitive bases in the subject\u2019s\nperceptions or beliefs (Deonna and Teroni 2012: 24\u201325). For\nexample, I\u2019m not afraid of the dog in front of me unless I think\nthere\u2019s a dog in front of me, and believe that it may well hurt\nme. My fear is grounded in part in those beliefs or perceptions. One\nconsequence is that the emotion itself is justified only if the\ncognitive bases are justified (even if not necessarily true)\n(Greenspan 1988). If so, emotional justification is dependent\n(Pelser 2014, Cowan 2018). Initially, this might look like bad news\nfor EEP, since it appears to conflict with the thesis that emotions\nprovide immediate justification for evaluative propositions. But note\nthat while emotional justification may presuppose justification for\nbelief in non-evaluative propositions (such as those\nconcerning a dog\u2019s proneness to attack), there is a gap between\nthese inputs and the evaluative proposition that is the\ncontent of the emotional experience itself according to perceptualism\n(see Etcheverri 2019). I might be angry with you because I believe you\ntold somebody about my peculiar hobby, but the anger itself\ndoesn\u2019t present you as having talked about my hobby, but rather\nyour having wronged me. Even if it is as a matter of fact the case\nthat my being wronged in this situation consists in your having\nrevealed an embarrassing fact about me, it doesn\u2019t follow that\nwhat justifies belief in the factual proposition suffices to justify\nthe belief in the moral proposition. For all that\u2019s been said\nabout epistemic dependence on cognitive bases, my anger might provide\nadditional, immediate justification for belief in the\nwrongness of your act. As Robert Cowan puts it, \u201cwhen the\ncognitive base of an emotion is justified then emotions can justify\nbeliefs with evaluative content, independently of having further\njustification for believing supporting evaluative propositions\u201d\n(2018: 229).\n\nThe upside of epistemic dependence, then, is that it allows epistemic\nperceptualists to give a natural answer to the why-question\nchallenges. If you ask me why I think the wolf is dangerous or why I\nthink my friend\u2019s act was wrong, I\u2019ll cite the salient\nnon-evaluative feature that makes the situation dangerous or the act\nwrong and thus justifies my emotion (as I see things), rather than the\nfact that I respond to it with an emotion. Through the lens of my\nemotion, so to speak, I regard this non-evaluative feature as\ngrounding an evaluative truth concerning the target \u2013 it will\nseem so obvious to me that it\u2019s not worth mentioning that, say,\na dog\u2019s being poised to attack merits fear.\n\nHow about the self-justification challenge? Jonathan Mitchell (2017)\npoints out that in non-pathological cases, fear, for example, does\npresent its target as calling for fear \u2013 otherwise the emotion\nisn\u2019t intelligible to the subject herself. Plausibly, Brady is\nright that the evidence for dangerousness (meriting fear) isn\u2019t\nthe fact that I\u2019m afraid, but the dog\u2019s posing a threat to\nmy interests. Nevertheless, my fear might make this fact\u2019s\nreason-giving status available to me in the good case. The\nfear still wouldn\u2019t be self-justifying, since the dog might not\nin fact pose a threat.\n\nThe problems for perceptualism don\u2019t end with dependence on\ncognitive basis, however. There is reason to believe that emotions\nalso depend on our desires or concerns (Roberts 2003).\nI\u2019m only sad when you break an old vase if I wanted to keep it,\nor afraid of the growling wolf if I don\u2019t want to be eaten. When\nit comes to belief or indeed perceptual experience, it\u2019s a\nstrike against justificatory standing if the state is influenced by a\ndesire \u2013 as Markie (2005) observes in criticizing epistemic\nliberalism, if a rock seems like a gold nugget to you just because you\nreally want it to be a gold nugget, this seeming doesn\u2019t justify\nbelief in its being a gold nugget. So why isn\u2019t this sort of\ncognitive penetrability a problem for EEP? A natural way to get around\nthe problem is to say that the desires or concerns underlying the\nemotional appearance must themselves be correct or justified. The\nproblem with this suggestion is that one then needs a story of how\ndesires are correct or justified that doesn\u2019t itself appeal to\nemotional experience, which doesn\u2019t seem compatible with\nemotions playing a foundational epistemic role (see Helm 2001 for a\ncoherentist take).\n\nFinally, while EEP tends to have an epistemological internalist\nflavor, perceptual experience in general is of course linked to the\nexternal world. In the case of sensory perception, causal links to the\nobjects of perception play a role in explaining the reliability, and\narguably the justificatory status, of perceptual experiences. Emotions\ndon\u2019t seem to be caused by the evaluative properties they\nrepresent, however \u2013 though if we consider how we go from\nproximal sensory stimulus to perception of objects, the difference\nbetween ordinary perceptual experiences and emotions may not be so\nlarge (Milona and Naar 2020). Causal relations may also explain why\nperceptual experiences have the contents they do.\n\nAn alternative line is to say that what causes the emotion isn\u2019t\nan evaluative feature of the object \u2013 rather, what we literally\nperceive is the property that grounds the wrongness of the action,\nsuch as the shooting of a peaceful demonstrator by a police officer,\nand then respond to it with an emotional reaction, which construes the\naction as wrong. Imagination would work as well. If so, perhaps it is\nbetter to think of emotions as quasi-perceptual appearances that\nconstitute moral intuitions rather than perceptions (Kauppinen 2013).\nThis goes naturally with a view on which emotions (re)present their\ntargets as having certain evaluative properties in virtue of their\nphenomenal character rather than etiology. The way an emotion feels is\nnot irrelevant to how it construes its object (cf. Goldie 2000 on\n\u2018feelings towards\u2019 an object). The feelings involved in\nanger, for example, aren\u2019t directionless sensations, but have a\nqualitative character in virtue of which anger presents its object as\noffensive (Kriegel 2014).\n\nWhat about reliability? Again, many believe that ordinary perceptual\nexperience justifies belief in part because it is generally reliable,\neven if its phenomenal features are also relevant to justification. In\nany case, moral knowledge requires more than justification\nand truth \u2013 as it is common to say these days, a belief must be\nsafe (such that it could not easily have been the case that\nthe person would have formed a false belief using the same method) to\namount to knowledge (Sosa 1999, Williamson 2000). As noted earlier,\nsome epistemic sentimentalists, such as Tappolet (2011), are not\nmetaphysical sentimentalists, but rather realists about value. Those\nwho hold a view of this type may argue, as Adam Carter (2019) does,\nthat for emotional experiences to justify belief they must issue from\na competence or skill, roughly a disposition to get it right\nwhen properly situated. Other epistemic perceptualists, such as Prinz\n(2007) subscribe to sentimentalist metaphysics. It is open to them to\noffer a constitutive explanation of the reliability of\nemotions: since the evaluative facts are constitutively linked to\nemotional responses, there is good reason to think emotional responses\ntrack them, at least in suitable conditions.\n\nTo be sure, even if moral perception (or sentimental intuition) is\nepistemically as good as sense perception, we know that in some\ncircumstances our senses are not reliable. But how do we know which\ncircumstances? This calibration challenge was already noted\nby Hutcheson:\n\n\nBut may there not be a right or wrong state of our moral sense, as\nthere is in our other senses, according as they represent their\nobjects to be as they really are, or represent them otherwise? So may\nnot our moral sense approve that which is vicious, and disapprove\nvirtue, as a sickly palate may dislike grateful food, or a vitiated\nsight misrepresent colours or dimensions? Must we not know therefore\nantecedently what is morally good or evil by our reason, before we can\nknow that our moral sense is right? (Hutcheson 1728: 177)\n\n\nHutcheson\u2019s response was to point out that even if moral sense\ncan mislead, it doesn\u2019t follow that reason is needed to\nprovide a standard for it, or that it\u2019s capable of doing so.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not by reasoning that we fundamentally correct\nmistakes of colour perception. Rather, we try to ascertain which\ncircumstances are conducive to properly functioning perception\n(perhaps by way of an a priori inquiry) and then try to place\nourselves in such circumstances and look again. What the suitable\ncircumstances in the moral case are like depends on the nature of\nmoral facts. For relativists like Prinz (2007), the only thing that\nmatters is that our reactions genuinely reflect our sentiments towards\nthe action. For ideal dispositionalists, David Lewis offers a basic\nrecipe:\n\n\nTo find out whether we would be disposed, under ideal conditions, to\nvalue it, put yourself in ideal conditions, if you can, making sure\nyou can tell when you have succeeded in doing so. Then find out\nwhether you value the thing in question, i.e., whether you desire to\ndesire it. If you do, that confirms that it is a value. (Lewis 1989:\n117)\n\n\nFor Lewis himself, the ideal conditions for valuing are those of full\nimaginative acquaintance with the object. For Hume and Smith, the\nideal conditions of moral judging involve occupying the \u2018common\npoint of view\u2019 or the perspective of an impartial and\nwell-informed spectator. As discussed in\n Section 2.2,\n they both believe that achieving this requires sympathizing (or\nempathizing) with the feelings or reactive attitudes of those\nimmediately affected while controlling for predictable distortions.\nUnless they are felt from the common point of view, our emotional\nresponses will not reliably track the response-dependent moral\nfacts.\n",
