    "main_text": "Theory of Values\n3. Theory of Values\nSoon after publishing his article on Gestalt qualities,\nEhrenfels produced a series of articles under the title\n\u201cWerttheorie und Ethik\u201d (1893\u20131894) which were followed by\nhis two-volume System der Werttheorie (1897\u20131898). The first\nvolume in particular, entitled Allgemeine Werttheorie, Psychologie\ndes Begehrens, concerns us in this section.\nIt is most appropriate, according to Ehrenfels, to begin a\nphilosophical investigation by taking into account what is indicated by\nordinary language. However, by no means is it obligatory to leave the\nmatter there. Sometimes a revision of the concept in question is\nneeded. Such a revision he finds to be necessary regarding the concept\nof value. While ordinary language seems to indicate that the value of\nsomething is among its objective properties, such a value-property is\nnot to be found in reality. Rather, as long as we adhere to such a\nconception of value, it seems to be mystical. Though we ordinarily\nthink that we desire objects because they are \u201cvaluable\u201d\n(i.e., because they supposedly have this \u201cmystical,\nincomprehensible essence\u201d), the fact of the matter, says\nEhrenfels, is that we ascribe value to objects because we desire them\n(Ehrenfels 1897, 2, also see Fabian in Albertazzi et al. 1996,\n166; Reicher 2017, 284 f.).\nBesides the view that value is some sort of mystical property of\nobjects, other ones are identified by Ehrenfels in opposition to his.\nAmong these views is the one put forward by the so-called \u201cfirst\nschool\u201d of Austrian value theory, as put forward by certain\noutstanding economists (specifically C. Menger, E. B\u00f6hm von\nBawerk, and F. von Wieser, as mentioned in Ehrenfels 1897, 3 n.). On\nthis view the value of objects \u201cis neither a property nor an\nessence of them, considered as such, but rather merely their\nindispensability in the satisfaction of our desires\u201d (Ehrenfels\n1897, 3). While Ehrenfels fully appreciates this school\u2019s\ncontribution to the understanding of value (Smith 1994, 282), he\nnonetheless thinks that it does not provide a satisfactory theory of\nvalue in general due to its narrow focus on economic value. There are\nfor him other types of value besides this, as exhibited by\ncounter-examples (as when the lock of hair belonging to one\u2019s\nmother is kept as a thing of value). A general theory of value on his\nview is to illuminate economic value and not vice versa.\nYet another attempt to characterize value without assigning it the\nstatus of a mystical property of certain objects is the one that had\nbeen put forward by Brentano, which Ehrenfels formulates as\nfollows:\nNot all desired things are valuable, but rather only those\nwhich are worthy of being desired. Whether this worthiness\nbelongs to a thing, however, is not in the particular case yielded from\nthe investigation of the objective nature of the thing, but rather from\nthe subjective consideration of the desire directed at the thing. From\nthe examination of our own mental activity in the act of desire we\ndiscern whether this is directed at something valuable or not.\n(Ehrenfels 1897, 3\u20134)\nIn contemporary terms, Brentano is a cognitivist, for he maintains\nthat loving and hating (the acts of valuing on his view) can be\ncharacterized as correct (Brentano 1889). The \u201csecond\nschool\u201d of Austrian value theory, to which the early Meinong\n(1894) as well as Ehrenfels belong, distanced itself from\nBrentano\u2019s cognitivism, while building on his method of\ndescriptive psychology (Grassl in PSI, 5). Here we should note,\nhowever, that Ehrenfels came to develop views in aesthetics that can be\ncontrasted with the non-cognitivism found in his early work. This later\ndevelopment will be discussed further at the end of the present\nsection.\nAn important aspect of Ehrenfels\u2019 value theory is his view\nregarding the relation of desire to feeling. He characterizes feeling\nas anything that occurs on the scale that ranges from pleasure to pain\n(Ehrenfels 1897, 5 ff.). Indifference is the central point in this\nscale. Desire also encompasses a range of phenomena, consisting of\nwishing, striving, and willing (Ehrenfels 1897, 6 ff.). There is,\naccording to Ehrenfels, clearly a difference between feeling and\ndesire, though they are also connected in a psychologically interesting\nway. While Brentano seems to think that his inclusion of feeling and\ndesire in a single class of psychical phenomena is supported by inner\nperception, Ehrenfels points out how ineffective an appeal to inner\nperception is in such matters of dispute (this, however, does not\nprevent Ehrenfels from making similar appeals at crucial junctures of\nhis value theory). Moreover, Brentano argues for his classification of\ndesire together with feeling by presenting us with a range of phenomena\nwhich seem to shade off into each other, beginning with a feeling and\nending with not only a desire, but with a full-fledged instance of\nwilling (Brentano 1874, 308 ff.; Brentano 1995, 183 ff.). Nevertheless,\nEhrenfels maintains that instances in which there occurs feeling\nwithout desire and desire without feeling serve to demonstrate that\nthey do not belong together in the same class of psychical phenomena\n(Ehrenfels 1897, 10 ff.). It is, in addition, on his view desire rather\nthan feeling that determines what is valuable. It was Meinong who first\ninsisted on the distinction between feeling and desire, although he\nregarded feelings rather than desires to be determinative of values\n(Meinong 1894, \u00a7\u00a7 5\u20136). Ehrenfels\u2019 general theory of\nvalue thus stands in contrast with those that were advocated by both of\nhis mentors (also see Reicher 2017, 285 f.).\nEhrenfels also criticizes the traditional view (especially prominent\nin Kantian ethics) that reason (Vernunft) can direct our\ndesires (Ehrenfels 1897, 8 ff.). On his view reason may be used to\nconstruct complexes of presentations, which are then set as goals by\nour desires, though reason itself is unable to set these as goals.\nEhrenfels also thinks that reason can determine the means whereby a\ngoal is to be achieved, but this is again not the same as setting\ngoals. Aside from its involvement in shaping the presentations of ends\nand the determination of the means to them, Ehrenfels rejects any\nsuggestion that reason plays any additional role in valuation.\nWhile the view that desire and not reason determines value will\nsuggest to many that Ehrenfels wants to assert that nothing is valuable\nfor each individual aside from its own pleasure, the underlying\nassumption that one desires only one\u2019s own feeling of pleasure.\nOur experience, however, shows us that this assumption is false.\n\u201cIn the most common circumstances of our everyday life our\ndesiring aims directly at certain routine external tasks such as\neating, drinking, waiting, sitting, sleeping, etc., without there being\npresented thereby the state of feeling which corresponds to\nthese\u201d (Ehrenfels 1897, 27; Smith 1994, 283 ff.). Nevertheless,\nobtaining what we desire does result in an increase of pleasure\nrelative to the state that would be experienced without the desire\nbeing satisfied (Ehrenfels 1897, 31 ff.).\nFar from desire being aimed at such concrete things as feelings, it\nis rather described by Ehrenfels in the following way:\nDesiring a thing means either desiring the existence of a\nthing, or possession of it, in which case the desire is directed at an\nexistence, though not of the thing itself, but rather of its\navailability, and at the same time at a non-existence, the absence of\nall disturbances which obstruct that availability. (Ehrenfels\n1897, 53)\nWe can of course have \u201cnegative\u201d desires that are as\nsuch directed at the non-existence of something. Though Ehrenfels does\nnot use any technical term in application to the correlate of desire,\nit is understandable to suggest that he has \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d (Sachverhalte) in mind here (Smith 1994,\n286).\nIt has been said that the theory of value that Ehrenfels developed\nin his early work was non-cognitivist in his general theory of values.\nIn his aesthetics, however, we find a very different view regarding\nvalues of works of art. This view is expressed in a posthumously\npublished dialogue, \u201cWas ist Sch\u00f6nheit?\u201d, where he\nsays \u201cthat absolute beauty is given and comes about wherever we\ngrasp with feeling or sensation a certain lawfulness\n[Gesetztm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit] that we cannot\nyet comprehend with the understanding\u201d (PSII, 164). There\nare, according to Ehrenfels, no differences in taste in art. As regards\nmusic, for instance, the apparent difference in taste among people is\ncharacterized as follows:\nMost fundamentally much rather difference in the capacity for\nmusical perception, that is to say, the faculty of apprehension, of\nimagination and memory for tonal forms [Tongestalten] \u2013\nfurthermore difference in inner rhythm and inner gestures with which we\nunconsciously accompany our speech, thoughts, and feelings \u2013\ndifference in our instinctual life [Triebleben], even in the\nformation of our senses. (PSII, 164\u2013165.)\nIn short, absolute beauty is the same for all of us, though our\ndifferences in the apprehension of works of art misleads us into\nthinking that beauty is merely relative, just \u201ca matter of\ntaste\u201d. While this development in Ehrenfels aesthetics away from\nhis earlier non-cognitivism has not gone unnoticed (Reicher 2006, 2009)\nit is a domain that he himself left open for further investigation. It\napparently calls for revision of his earlier non-cognitivism as well as\nexplorations of connections between the theory of Gestalt\nqualities and aesthetics.\nWhile Ehrenfels\u2019 early work on value theory and ethics remained\nfor the most part within the domain now called\n\u201cmetaethics\u201d, he did make an effort in his later work to\ndevelop a theory of normative ethics. His most passionate attempt to do\nso will be considered in the following section.\n",
