But critical questions about justice also pertain to\nwhether workers are entitled to work and whether they are obligated to\ndo so. Work thus raises questions of contributive and\nproductive justice respectively.\n\nFor one, do workers have a right to work in the first place? The\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights states as much, assuring each\nindividual \u201cthe right to work, to free employment, to just and\nfavorable conditions of work and to protection against\nunemployment.\u201d (United Nations 1948, Article 23) A right to work\nwould presumably be more than a negative liberty, i.e., not simply a\nright that others not interfere with one\u2019s attempts to work,\nsecure employment, etc., but a claim to be provided work if\none wishes (Schaff 2017). The right to work has been defended both for\nspecific populations (such as the disabled; see Kavka 1992) or for the\npopulace writ large (Tcherneva 2020). If there is such a right, it\nwill presumably be because work is an essential (or at least the\nprevailing) means for the acquisition of vital goods. Elster (1988)\nproposes a job guarantee on the grounds that work is essential to\nself-realization. Gomberg (2007) argues that work is a key social good\nbecause it is the primary path by which to make a socially validated\ncontribution to one\u2019s wider community, a contribution that can\nprovide us recognition and a sense of meaning. Two crucial questions\nthat arise in connection with the putative right to work are (a)\nagainst whom is this right held, i.e., who must provide work if\nworkers have a right to it, or (b) whether work provided so as to\nhonour this right will in fact provide the goods on which the right to\nwork is based (e.g., the work provided under a government-provided job\nguarantee could prove unfulfilling).\n\nA right to work would mean that any person (or at least any adult) who\nwished to work would be able to do so. But do individuals have a right\nnot to work, or is work in any sense morally obligatory? The\nmost obvious basis for such an obligation appeals to notions of\nfair play or reciprocity: Individuals act wrongly when they\nfail to contribute to social enterprises from which they benefit, and\nsince the productive economy benefits most everyone in a society,\nindividuals have an obligation to contribute to the productive economy\nby working. (Becker 1980, White 2003) Opponents of this fair play\nrationale argue that the conditions for just reciprocal relations\nbetween societies and particular groups (e.g., the ghetto poor; see\nShelby 2012) do not obtain, thereby exempting members of such groups\nfrom the obligation to work, or that contemporary economic\ndevelopments fail to provide the background conditions for the\nobligation to apply (Cholbi 2018a). Other opponents of an obligation\nto work argue that it represents a violation of the state\u2019s duty\nto treat citizens equally; citizens who are compelled to work are made\nto pursue a conception of the good life with which they may not agree,\nand a just state should treat citizens as equals by remaining neutral\namong rival conceptions of the good life (van Parijs 1991, Levine\n1995). An obligation to work would in effect amount to the\nstate\u2019s endorsement of the \u2018work ethic\u2019 and the\nrejection of ways of life (e.g., being a beachcomber) that themselves\noppose the work ethic. Other opponents of a duty to work argue that\nrequiring individuals to work is likely to stand in the way of\nself-realization for particular people (Maskivker 2012).\n\nAnother possibility is that even if there is not a general obligation\nto work, we might be subject to limitations on our work-related\nliberties in order to satisfy demands of distributive justice. Many of\nthe goods provided by a just society, including education and health\ncare, are labor-intensive. But societies often face shortfalls of\nworkers in the very occupations that provide these goods. Some\nphilosophers have argued that the demands of distributive justice may\npermissibly constrain our work choices, and in fact, may license\ngovernments conscripting labor in order to secure workers to provide\nthese goods, on the model of the military draft during wartime.\n(Fabr\u00e9 2008, Stanczyk 2012). Similar concerns arise concerning\nsocially necessary but undesirable \u2018dirty\u2019 work.(Walzer\n1983, Schmode 2019). Conversely, if justice can require individuals to\nperform certain kinds of work, this might speak against a right to\nstrike (Borman, 2017, Gourevitch 2018), particularly on the part of\nessential workers (Munoz 2014).\n\nHow one\u2019s choice of work contributes to justice and the overall\ngood is a moral question that individuals face as well. Some jobs\n(hired assassin, for example) seem immoral as such. But to what\nextent, if any, are we obligated to choose careers or jobs that\npromote justice or the welfare of others? On the one hand, choice of\njobs and careers does not appear exempt from moral considerations,\ninasmuch as the work one performs affects others and society at large,\nand given the often dismal state of the world, perhaps we are\nobligated to choose jobs and careers for moral reasons rather than\nsolely on the basis of self-interest. Norman Care (1984:285) proposes\n\u201cthat in today\u2019s world morality requires that service to\nothers be put before self-realization in the matter of career\nchoice.\u201d In contrast, some philosophers who believe that\nindividuals (and not merely institutions) within a society are subject\nto demands of justice nevertheless accord individuals discretion in\ntheir choices of occupation. G.A. Cohen, for instance, asserts that we\nshould each enjoy a \u201cpersonal prerogative\u201d that allows us\nto be something more than an \u201cengine for the welfare of other\npeople\u201d or \u201cslaves to social justice.\u201d (2008:10) We\nmight likewise worry that requiring that our job or career choices be\noptimal from the standpoint of justice or social welfare is\nexcessively demanding in light of how such choices both reflect and\nshape our identities (Cholbi 2020).\n",
