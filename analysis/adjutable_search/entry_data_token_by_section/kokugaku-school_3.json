    "main_text": "Philological Kokugaku || Kamo no Mabuchi 1697\u20131769\n3.1 Kamo no Mabuchi 1697\u20131769\n\nMabuchi was raised in Hamamatsu along the roadway linking Kyoto and\nEdo. Taught to read by Kada no Azumamaro\u2019s niece, he developed\nan early interest in Shinto and waka, which would become for\nhim an escapist passion. In 1728 he registered in Azumamaro\u2019s\nschool and moved there for full time study in 1733, which is where he\nreceived his introduction to the Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b\nincluding Keich\u016b\u2019s commentary and the full range of\nKokugaku topics taught there.\n\nMabuchi moved to Edo in 1737 and in 1746 replaced Kada Arimaro as the\nauthority on Japanese studies in service to Tayasu Munetake, the\nyounger brother of the feeble regnant shogun, a position Mabuchi\nretained until 1760. Mabuchi produced essays on a range of topics, but\nthe focus of his study during these years was a philological analysis\nof the Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b through which he believed\none could learn the words and spirit (kokoro) of Japan before\nthese were Sinified and thereby corrupted during the Nara period of\nthe eighth century. Mabuchi depicted the Japan of the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b as a natural arcadia ruled by the\ndescendants of the kami who governed in accordance with a Way\n(michi) that conformed to the natural rhythms and dictates of\nnature (literally, \u201cheaven and earth\u201d) itself:\n\n\nFrom the time when the imperial court was at \u014ctsu in \u014cmi\nthrough the period of the Fujiwara court at Yamato, grand august\ngovernment filled the heavens and reached to every nook and cranny of\nthe earth; and thanks to this glorious tranquility, literary\nexpression was blessed with beauty and elegance. (Engishiki norito\nkai jo, KKMZ:SH 1: 446 author translation)\n\n\nRetirement from service to Munetake in 1760 made Mabuchi less prone to\nthe charge of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, and he was free to\ngive rein to the implications of his earlier study. He began to\ndescribe his current age as one that had declined since ancient times\nbecause the old natural virtues had been crushed and catastrophically\nreplaced by the artificial morals of China:\n\n\nAncient Japan was governed well in accordance with the spirit of\nheaven and earth, and there was none of this petty sophistry; but then\nsuddenly when these convincing theories were imported from China,\nancient men in their straightforward fashion took these theories as\ntruth, and the theories spread far and wide\u2026. [and no sooner\nwere these theories introduced \u2026 than tremendous chaos erupted.\n(Kokui k\u014d, SJTa: 406)\n\n\nHe taught that if one will advance to the stage of being able to\nrecite the most ancient Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b verses\naloud, one will be affected to the point where only one\u2019s body\nremains mired in the here-and-now, as one\u2019s language and heart\n(kokoro) are transported back to the ancient past. In the\nprocess one will spontaneously acquire the virtues of that\npast\u2014truthfulness, directness, manliness, vitality, and native\nelegance\u2014which were the antithesis of the notoriously corrupt\npolitical culture of his times. He also became virulently\nanti-Chinese, insisting that the absence of native Japanese words for\nthe classic Confucian virtues was evidence that such teachings were\nunnecessary in ancient Japan when life enjoyed a morally and ethically\nuntutored order rooted in its conformity to the natural rhythms of\nheaven and earth.\n\nMabuchi began lecturing to hundreds of students, many of whom would\ngather by the veranda of his home on the fringes of Edo. His was the\nfirst successful Kokugaku private academy\u2014others would\nfollow\u2014and he was also a notorious antiquarian eccentric; years\nafter his death in 1769, Mabuchi\u2019s biography was the opening\nentry in Ban K\u014dkei\u2019s celebrated 1790 study of contemporary\neccentrics. Of his roughly three hundred students, none would achieve\ngreater renown as a scholar of Kokugaku than Motoori Norinaga, who\nonly met Mabuchi on one fateful evening in 1763 when Mabuchi stayed\nthe night in Matsusaka on a tour of Japan. \n",
