    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Fallibilism\n4.3 Fallibilism\n\nOne of Hume\u2019s great claims to fame is his articulation of what\nhas come to be known as the \u201cproblem of induction\u201d, or, to\nuse language closer to Hume\u2019s: the problematic status of\ninferences. An informal way to express his insight is that no claim to\nknowledge of matters of fact ought to be thought of as definitive\nbecause in all of our inductive reasoning (or inferences) we\npresuppose that the future will be the same as the past. But we can\nnever be certain that the future will be the same as the past because\nthe evidence for the assumption is based on the uniformity of nature\nin the past. The uniformity of nature is presupposed in our knowledge,\nbut our belief in it cannot be secured by reason. Infamously, Hume\nclaimed the source of the belief is not reason but habit and our\nconfidence in it is derived from instinct (see Millican 1995). While\nthere is ongoing scholarly debate over the extent of Hume\u2019s\nskepticism that follows from this insight, it is less controversial\nthat for Hume knowledge of matters of fact, whatever its ultimate\nstatus in Hume\u2019s thought, is always tentative, subject to\nrevision. This is known as fallibilism. While Hume\u2019s argument\nappears unique to him (although elements of it are prefigured in\nBerkeley and the Dutch Newtonian, Willem \u2019s Gravesande), the\nposition is anticipated by Newton.\n\nNewton\u2019s fourth rule of reasoning reads:\n\n\nIn experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by\ninduction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true\nnotwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena\nmake such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions.\n(Newton 2004, Principia, Book III, Rule IV)\n\n\nThe rule is that we should treat well-confirmed propositions as true\n(or nearly true) until there are deviations that promote new research,\nwhich, in turn, lead us to refine our original propositions or reject\nthem for new ones (Smith 2002). But while one has a theory, one must\nnot be distracted by possible differing explanations for the found\nregularities until one has empirical reason. One accepts a theory as\ntrue as a means to developing a better theory. As Newton writes in the\n\u201cPreface\u201d to the Principia, \u201cthe principles\nset down here will shed some light on either this mode of\nphilosophizing or some truer one\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, Newton accepts that\nphysical inquiry is forward-looking and may be open-ended; not only\nits theories may evolve, but also its methods. Rule IV implicitly\naccepts that the future may bring surprises and new evidence, and,\nthus, anticipates Hume\u2019s fallibilistic insights. As commentators\non Hume have noted, this strand of Hume\u2019s skepticism is shared\nby Newton. It is less clear if Hume learned it from Newton because\nthere is no evidence that he was acquainted with Newton\u2019s fourth\nrule of reasoning (added to the third edition of the\nPrincipia); there is no equivalent in Hume\u2019s rules of\nreasoning to Newton\u2019s fourth rule. In the section on\nHume\u2019s Rule of Reasoning\n (\u00a74.5),\n the significance of the absence of an equivalent to Newton\u2019s\nrule 4 in Hume\u2019s thought is explored.\n",
