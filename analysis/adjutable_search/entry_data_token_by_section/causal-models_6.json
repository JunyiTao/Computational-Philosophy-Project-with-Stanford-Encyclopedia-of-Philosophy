Consider a gas grill, used to cook meat. We can\ndescribe the operations of the grill using the following\nvariables:\n\nGas connected (1 if yes, 0 if no)\nGas knob (0 for off, 1 for low, 2 for medium, 3 for\nhigh)\nGas level (0 for off, 1 for low, 2 for medium, 3 for\nhigh)\nIgniter (1 if pressed, 0 if not)\nFlame (0 for off, 1 for low, 2 for medium, 3 for\nhigh)\nMeat on (0 for no, 1 for yes)\nMeat cooked (0 for raw, 1 for rare, 2 for medium, 3 for\nwell done)\n\n\nThus, for example, Gas knob = 1 means that the gas knob is\nset to low; Igniter = 1 means that the igniter is pressed,\nand so on. Then the equations might be:\n\nGas level = Gas connected \\(\\times\\) Gas\nknob\nFlame = Gas level \\(\\times\\)\nIgniter\nMeat cooked = Flame \\(\\times\\) Meat\non\n\n\nThe last equation, for example, tells us that if the meat is not put\non the grill, it will remain raw (Meat cooked = 0). If the\nmeat is put on the grill, then it will get cooked according to the\nlevel of the flame: if the flame is low (Flame = 1), the meat\nwill be rare (Meat cooked = 1), and so on.\n\nBy convention each equation has one effect variable on the left hand\nside, and one or more cause variables on the right hand side. We also\nexclude from each equation any variable that makes no difference to\nthe value of the effect variable. For example, the equation for\nGas level could be written as Gas level = (Gas\nconnected \\(\\times\\) Gas knob) \\(+\\) (0 \\(\\times\\) Meat\ncooked); but since the value of Meat cooked makes no\ndifference to the value of Gas level in this equation, we\nomit the variable Meat cooked. A SEM is acyclic if\nthe variables can be ordered so that variables never appear on the\nleft hand side of an equation after they have appeared on the right.\nOur example is acyclic, as shown by the ordering of variables given\nabove. In what follows, we will assume that SEMs are acyclic, unless\nstated otherwise.\n\nWe can represent this system of equations as a DAG\n (Figure 3):\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nAn arrow is drawn from variable X to variable Y\njust in case X figures as an argument in the equation for\nY. The graph contains strictly less information than the set of\nequations; in particular, the DAG gives us qualitative information\nabout which variables depend upon which others, but it does not tell\nus anything about the functional form of the dependence.\n\nThe variables in a model will typically depend upon further variables\nthat are not explicitly included in the model. For instance, the level\nof the flame will also depend upon the presence of oxygen. Variables that\nare not explicitly represented in the model are assumed to be fixed at\nvalues that make the equations appropriate. For example, in our model\nof the gas grill, oxygen is assumed to be present in sufficient\nquantity to sustain a flame ranging in intensity from low to high.\n\nIn our example, the variables Gas level, Flame, and\nMeat cooked are endogenous, meaning that their\nvalues are determined by other variables in the model. Gas\nconnected, Gas knob, Igniter, and Meat on are\nexogenous, meaning that their values are determined outside\nof the system. In all of the models that we will consider in\n section 3,\n the values of the exogenous variables are given or otherwise\nknown.\n\nFollowing Halpern (2016), we will call an assignment of values to the\nexogenous variables a context. In an acyclic SEM, a context\nuniquely determines the values of all the variables in the model. An\nacyclic SEM together with a context is a world (what Halpern\n2016 calls a \u201ccausal setting\u201d). For instance, if we add\nthe setting\n\nGas connected = 1\nGas knob = 3\nIgniter = 1\nMeat on = 1\n\n\nto our three equations above, we get a world in which Gas\nlevel = 3, Flame = 3, and Meat cooked = 3.\n\nThe distinctively causal or \u201cstructural\u201d content of a SEM\nderives from the way in which interventions are represented.\nTo intervene on a variable is to set the value of that variable by a\nprocess that overrides the usual causal structure, without interfering\nwith the causal processes governing the other variables. More\nprecisely, an intervention on a variable X overrides the normal\nequation for X, while leaving the other equations unchanged.\nFor example, to intervene on the variable Flame in our\nexample would be to set the flame to a specified level regardless of\nwhether the igniter is pressed or what the gas level is. (Perhaps, for\nexample, one could pour kerosene into the grill and light it with a\nmatch.) Woodward (2003) proposes that we think of an intervention as a\ncausal process that operates independently of the other variables in\nthe model. Randomized controlled trials aim to intervene in this\nsense. For example, a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy\nof a drug for hypertension aims to determine whether each subject\ntakes the drug (rather than a placebo) by a random process such as a\ncoin flip. Factors such as education and health insurance that\nnormally influence whether someone takes the drug no longer play this\nrole for subjects in the trial population. Alternately, we could\nfollow the approach of Lewis (1979) and think of an intervention\nsetting the value of a variable by a minor \u201cmiracle\u201d.\n\nTo represent an intervention on a variable, we replace the\nequation for that variable with a new equation stating the value to\nwhich the variable is set. For example, if we intervene to set the\nlevel of flame at low, we would represent this by replacing\nthe equation Flame = Gas level \\(\\times\\)\nIgniter with Flame = 1. This creates a new causal\nstructure in which Flame is an exogenous variable;\ngraphically, we can think of the intervention as \u201cbreaking the\narrows\u201d pointing into Flame. The new system of\nequations can then be solved to discover what values the other\nvariables would take as a result of the intervention. In the world\ndescribed above, our intervention would produce the following set of\nequations:\n\nGas connected = 1\nGas knob = 3\nIgniter = 1\nMeat on = 1\nGas level = Gas connected \u00d7 Gas\nknob\nFlame = Gas level \u00d7 Igniter\nFlame = 1\nMeat cooked = Flame \u00d7 Meat\non\n\n\nWe have struck through the original equation for Flame to\nshow that it is no longer operative. The result is a new world with a\nmodified causal structure, with Gas level = 3, Flame\n= 1, and Meat cooked = 1. Since the equation connecting\nFlame to its causes is removed, any changes introduced by\nsetting Flame to 1 will only propagate forward through the\nmodel to the descendants of Flame. The intervention changes\nthe values of Flame and Meat cooked, but it does not\naffect the values of the other variables. We can represent\ninterventions on multiple variables in the same way, replacing the\nequations for all of the variables intervened on.\n\nInterventions help to give content to the arrows in the corresponding\nDAG. If variable \\(X_i\\) is a parent of \\(X_j\\), this means that there\nexists some setting for all of the other variables in the model, such\nthat when we set those variables to those values by means of an\nintervention, intervening on \\(X_i\\) can still make a difference for\nthe value of \\(X_j\\). For example, in our original model, Gas\nlevel is a parent of Flame. If we set the value of\nIgniter to 1 by means of an intervention, and set Gas\nknob, Gas connected, Meat on, and Meat cooked to any\nvalues at all, then intervening on the value of Gas level\nmakes a difference for the value of Flame. Setting the value\nof Gas level to 1 would yield a value of 1 for\nFlame; setting Gas level to 2 yields a\nFlame of 2; and so on.\n",
