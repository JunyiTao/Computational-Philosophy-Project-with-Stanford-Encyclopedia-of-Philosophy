    "main_text": "Basic Principles || The Principle of Dependent-Arising\n2.2 The Principle of Dependent-Arising\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between thoughts, or even thoughts about\nthoughts, and actions? The Buddhist answers this question by\nintroducing a new theory of causality based on the principle of\ndependent-arising (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da). All things,\nincluding all cognitive events, arise in dependence upon a multitude\nof causes and conditions. Thus, the Buddhist appears to reject both\ntop-down (viz., cognitivist) and bottom-up (viz., strongly\ndeterminist) approaches to cognition: thoughts are neither prior to\nactions, and thus causally determine them, nor do they lack causal\nforce, and are thus epiphenomenal. The best known formulation of this\nprinciple captures the sense of transience and interdependence of all\nphenomena: \u201cThis being, that becomes; from the arising of this,\nthat arises; this not being, that does not become; from the ceasing of\nthis, that ceases\u201d (Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, II, 32).\n",
