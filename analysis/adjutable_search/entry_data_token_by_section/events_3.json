    "main_text": "Events and Other Categories || Events vs. Times\n1.4 Events vs. Times\n\nThe intuition that events are properties of times can also be fleshed\nout in terms of thinner metaphysical commitments, by construing events\nsimply as times cum description, i.e., as temporal instants\nor intervals during which certain statements hold (van Benthem 1983).\nOn this view, for example, this morning\u2019s rising of the sun is\nidentified by an ordered pair <i,\u03c6> where\ni is the relevant time interval (corresponding to the\ndescriptor \u2018this morning\u2019) and \u03c6 is the sentence\n\u2018The sun rises\u2019. Of course, this treatment does not do\njustice to some of the intuitions underlying the prima facie\ncommitments to events mentioned at the beginning\u2014for instance,\nevents can be perceived but times cannot (Gibson 1975). But because of\nthe availability of fully developed theories of intervals along with\nfully developed interval-based semantics (Cresswell 1979; Dowty 1979),\nand because of equally well worked-out traditional theories of\ninstants and instant-based semantics (Prior 1967), such accounts are\nespecially attractive from a reductionist perspective. One might even\nwant to construe events as spatiotemporal regions cum\ndescription, distinguishing, e.g., between this morning\u2019s rising\nof the sun in London and its rising in Paris.\n\nThe link between events and times has, however, been explored also in\nthe opposite direction. If events are assumed as a primitive\nontological category, then one may dispense with temporal instants or\nintervals and construe them as derived entities. The most classical\ntreatment of this sort proceeds by construing temporal instants as\nmaximal sets of pairwise simultaneous (or partially simultaneous)\nevents (Russell 1914; Whitehead 1929; Walker 1947), but other\ntreatments are possible. For example, it has been suggested that the\nmathematical connection between the way events are perceived to be\nordered and the underlying temporal dimension is essentially that of a\nfree construction (in the category-theoretic sense) of linear\norderings from event orderings, induced by the binary relation x\nwholly precedes y (Thomason 1984, 1989). Treatments such as these\nprovide a reduction of time in terms of relations among events and are\ntherefore especially germane to a relational conception of time (and,\nmore generally, of space-time). Modal variants (Forbes 1993) as well\nas mereotopological variants (Pianesi & Varzi 1996) of such views\nare also available.\n",
