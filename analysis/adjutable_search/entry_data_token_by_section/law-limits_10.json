    "main_text": "What is Harm? || A Setback to Autonomy/Prospect Harm\n5.3 A Setback to Autonomy/Prospect Harm\n\nAnother influential understanding of \u201charm\u201d is that\ninitially proposed by Raz: \u201cTo harm a person is to diminish his\nprospects, to affect adversely his possibilities\u201d (Raz 1986:\n414; Gardner & Shute 2000; Simester & von Hirsch 2011; Edwards\n2014, 2019). Harm is essentially understood not as a setback to\ninterests, but a setback to autonomy. Autonomy is essentially\nunderstood as the ability to choose between an adequate range of\nvaluable options, while in possession of the appropriate capacities to\nmake such choices and while sufficiently independent of others. There\nare plainly numerous ways one can set back such autonomy. The problem\nof explaining why pain is harmful raises its head again. Many would\ntake the infliction of pain on another to be harmful, without waiting\nto ask if the victim has suffered any setback in her ability to choose\nbetween an adequate range of valuable options, which surely, she will\noften not have done. And what of Devlin\u2019s case of harm to\nanimals? Devlin is likely to pop up at this point to repeat his view\nthat the reason we criminalize cruelty to animals is that it is\nmorally wrong and no potential defeating factor is strong enough to\noverturn that judgement for purposes of criminalization. There is no\nneed to establish any harm in the first place. Hart, as touched on\nabove, while accepting harm must be part of the story, offered the\navoidance of \u201csuffering\u201d as the ground for criminalizing\nanimal cruelty. Setback to autonomy or prospect-harm, however, looks\nlike a non-starter, for animals, though beings that can be harmed, are\nnot autonomous beings, at least on any standard account. Similarly,\nseverely mentally disordered persons may in some cases lack the\ncapacity for autonomy, but it is plain as day that they can be harmed,\nsomething the \u201csetback to autonomy\u201d or \u201cprospect\nharm\u201d conception seems ill equipped to account for (Stanton-Ife\n2010: 157\u2013162; Tadros 2011).\n\nOne upshot of the varying, sometimes implicit, understanding of harm\nis surely that anyone propounding an argument based on the harm\nprinciple needs to be clear about how they are using the term\n\u201charm\u201d. For the term may hide a host of questions that\nthemselves need to be resolved.\n",
