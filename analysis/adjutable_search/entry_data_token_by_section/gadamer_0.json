    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nBorn on February 11, 1900, in Marburg, in Southern Germany, Gadamer\ngrew up in Breslau (now Wroclaw in Poland), where his father was\nProfessor of Pharmacy at the University of Breslau, later taking the\nChair of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Marburg. Gadamer\u2019s family\nbackground was Protestant, and his father was sternly Prussian. His\nmother died of diabetes when Gadamer was only four, and he had no\nsurviving brothers or sisters. Showing an early interest in humanistic\nstudies, Gadamer began university studies in Breslau in 1918 (studying\nwith Richard Hoenigswald), moving to Marburg with his father in 1919.\nGadamer completed his doctoral studies at Marburg in 1922 (in his own\nwords, \u2018too young\u2019\u2014see Gadamer 1997b, 7) with a\ndissertation on Plato. In that same year, Gadamer also contracted\npoliomyelitis, from which he recovered only slowly, and the\nafter-effects of which remained with him for the rest of his life.\n\nGadamer\u2019s early teachers at Marburg were Paul Natorp and Nicolai\nHartmann. Paul Friedlander introduced him to philological study, and\nGadamer also received encouragement from Rudolf Bultmann. It was,\nhowever, Martin Heidegger (at Marburg from 1923\u20131928) who\nexerted the most important and enduring effect on Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical development. Gadamer had first met Heidegger in Freiburg\nin early 1923, having also corresponded with him in 1922. Yet although\nGadamer was a key figure in Heidegger\u2019s Marburg circle, working\nas Heidegger\u2019s unpaid assistant, by 1925 Heidegger had become\nquite critical of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical capacities and\ncontributions. As a result, Gadamer decided to abandon philosophy for\nclassical philology. (Gadamer was not alone in being the recipient of\nsuch criticism\u2014Heidegger was also unimpressed by Jacob Klein and\nwas certainly prone to deliver harsh judgments on his students and\ncolleagues\u2014but Gadamer seems to have been more particularly\naffected by it.) Through his philological work, however, Gadamer seems\nto have regained Heidegger\u2019s respect, passing the State\nExamination in Classical Philology in 1927, with Friedlander and\nHeidegger as two of the three examiners, and then going on to submit\nhis habilitation dissertation (\u2018Plato\u2019s Dialectical\nEthics\u2019, [1991]), in 1928, under Friedlander and\nHeidegger\u2019s guidance. Gadamer\u2019s relationship with\nHeidegger remained relatively close throughout their respective\ncareers, even though it was also a relationship that held considerable\ntension\u2014at least on Gadamer\u2019s side (of his difficulties in\nwriting in the late 1940s, Gadamer commented that \u2018I had the terrible\nfeeling that Heidegger was standing behind me and looking over my\nshoulder\u2019, Gadamer 1997b, 15).\n\nGadamer\u2019s first academic appointment was to a junior position in\nMarburg in 1928, finally achieving a lower-level professorship there\nin 1937. In the meantime, from 1934\u201335, Gadamer held a temporary\nprofessorship at Kiel, and then, in 1939, took up the Directorship of\nthe Philosophical Institute at the University of Leipzig, becoming\nDean of the Faculty in 1945, and Rector in 1946, before returning to\nteaching and research at Frankfurt-am-Main in 1947. In 1949, he\nsucceeded Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg, officially retiring (becoming\nProfessor Emeritus) in 1968. Following his retirement, he travelled\nextensively, spending considerable time in North America, where he was\na visitor at a number of institutions and developed an especially\nclose and regular association with Boston College in\nMassachusetts.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Gadamer was able to accommodate himself,\non his account, reluctantly, first to National Socialism and then\nbriefly, to Communism. While Gadamer did not identify himself strongly\nwith either regime (he was never a member of the National Socialist\nParty, although he did belong to the affiliated National Socialist\nTeachers Union), neither did he draw attention to himself by outright\nopposition. However some have seen his stance as too acquiescent, and\nothers have argued that he was indeed supportive of the Nazi\ndictatorship or of some aspects of it (see Wolin 2000 as well as the\nreply in Palmer 2002; see also the discussion in Krajewski 2003,\n169\u2013306; for Gadamer\u2019s own comments on this issue see the\ninterview/conversation, \u2018The real Nazis had no interest in us at\nall\u2019, Gadamer 2001).\n\nIn 1953, together with Helmut Kuhn, Gadamer founded the highly\ninfluential Philosophische Rundschau, but his main\nphilosophical impact was not felt until the publication of Truth\nand Method in 1960 (1989b). Gadamer\u2019s best known\npublications almost all date from the period after Truth and\nMethod (which did not appear in English translation until 1975),\nand in this respect much of his philosophical reputation rests on\npublications either after or in the decade just before his transition\nto emeritus status in 1968 (also the year in which he began regular\nvisits to the United States). The important debates in which Gadamer\nengaged with J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida took place in\nthis latter part of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical career, and it was\nnot until the 1970s and 1980s that Gadamer\u2019s work began to\nreceive widespread attention in English.\n\nGadamer was twice married: in 1923, to Frida Kratz (later divorced),\nwith whom he had one daughter (born in 1926), and, in 1950, to\nK\u00e4te Lekebusch. Gadamer received numerous awards and prizes\nincluding, in 1971, Knight of the \u2018Order of\nMerit\u2019\u2014the highest academic honor awarded in Germany.\nRemaining intellectually active until the very end of his life (he\nheld regular office hours even in his nineties), Gadamer died in\nHeidelberg on March 13, 2002, at the age of 102 (for a more detailed\nbiography, see Grondin 2003; see also Dostal 2021).\n",
