    "preamble": "\n\nGenerally, when a person knows some proposition or other, she does so\non the basis of something such as evidence, or good reasons, or\nperhaps some experiences she has had. The same is true of justified\nbeliefs that may fall short of knowledge. These beliefs are justified\non the basis of some evidence, or good reasons, or experiences, or\nmaybe on the basis of the manner in which the beliefs were\nproduced.\n\nInternalism in the first instance is a thesis about the basis of\neither knowledge or justified belief. This first form of internalism\nholds that a person either does or can have a form of access\nto the basis for knowledge or justified belief. The key idea is that\nthe person either is or can be aware of this basis. Externalists, by\ncontrast, deny that one always can have this sort of access to the\nbasis for one's knowledge and justified belief. A second form of\ninternalism, connected just to justified belief but probably\nextendable to knowledge as well, concerns not access but rather what\nthe basis for a justified belief really is. Mentalism is the thesis\nthat what ultimately justifies any belief is some mental state of the\nepistemic agent holding that belief. Externalism on this dimension,\nthen, would be the view that things other than mental states operate\nas justifiers. A third form of internalism concerns the very concept\nof justification, rather than access to or the nature of justifiers.\nThis third form of internalism is the deontological concept of\njustification, whose main idea is that the concept of epistemic\njustification is to be analyzed in terms of fulfilling one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. Externalism with respect to\nthe concept of epistemic justification would be the thesis that this\nconcept is to be analyzed in terms other than special duties or\nresponsibilities.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Awareness and Access\n\nIn an essay on Descartes, the British philosopher H.A. Prichard said\nthat,\n\nWhen we know something, we either do or can directly know that we are\nknowing it, and when we believe something we know or can know that we\nare believing and not knowing it, and in view of the former fact, we\nknow that in certain instances of its use our intelligence is not\ndefective\u2026 (Prichard 1950, 94)\n\n\nPrichard also characterized the point in terms of knowing by\nreflection:\n\n\u2026if there is to be such a thing as knowing that we know\nsomething, that knowing can be attained only directly, we in knowing\nthe thing knowing directly, either at the same time or on reflection,\nthat we are knowing it. (Ibid.)\n\n\nKnowing by reflection is knowledge one achieves merely by thinking\nabout the matter at hand. Further, even if one reflects a good deal,\nPrichard holds that the knowing thereby achieved is direct knowing,\npresumably because one need make no inferences from one belief to\nanother in the activity of reflecting.\n\nPrichard is here endorsing the KK-thesis, i.e., the thesis that\nknowing implies knowing that one knows. Philosophers who endorse what\nwe can call knowledge internalism accept something akin to what\nPrichard endorses, though their main focus is slightly different. That\nis, knowledge internalism concerns not knowing that one knows, as in\nPrichard, but rather knowing or being aware of that on the basis of\nwhich one knows. For example, imagine that you know that a flock of\nCanada geese has landed in a neighborhood park in your city; and\nsuppose that you came by this piece of knowledge on the basis of and\nas a result of some testimony from another person who has just\nreturned from that park. Then knowledge internalism would be the view\nthat in knowing that the geese are in the park, one also knows or is\naware of that on the basis of which one knows, namely, one is aware of\nthe testimony on the basis of which one has knowledge of the geese.\nOr, more plausibly, one could become aware merely by reflection of\nthat on the basis of which one knows about the geese.\n\nWe can use the term \u2018knowledge basis\u2019 for that on the\nbasis of which one knows something. A knowledge basis as here\nunderstood need not be restricted to other pieces of knowledge or\nbeliefs, but could also include experiences a person has had. Using\nthis terminology, we could say that knowledge internalism is the\nthesis that a person either is aware or can be become aware of the\nknowledge basis for each item of knowledge that person may have.\n\nIt is clear that when one is aware of the knowledge basis, or when one\ncan become aware of the knowledge basis, that one thereby has a kind\nof access to the knowledge basis. Accessibility, it is often said, is\nthe core idea behind internalism, and it is also usually supposed that\nthe sort of accessibility one has is pretty much what Prichard spoke\nof, namely a kind of direct awareness that one actually engages in or\ncould engage in merely by reflection. Using these ideas we can\ncharacterize two different forms of access knowledge internalism.\n\nActual Access KI:\nOne knows some proposition p only if one is also aware of\none's knowledge basis for p.\nAccessibility KI:\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of one's knowledge basis for p.\n\n\nHere we assume that the awareness spoken of in Actual Access knowledge\ninternalism is the direct sort that Prichard had in mind. It is an\nawareness that is not brought about by any calculation or\nreasoning.\n\nTo illustrate and partly defend Actual Access knowledge internalism,\nimagine that you look at a tree in the park, and thereby come to know\nthat there is a tree there. We can suppose for these illustrative\npurposes that your knowledge basis is the visual experience of the\ntree, and thus that you acquire direct, non-inferential knowledge of\nthe presence of the tree. In this example, when you acquire that\nknowledge, it seems plausible to also think that you are aware that\nyou are engaged in seeing, and that the content of the visual event is\na tree. Moreover, this same sort of point will hold for all manner of\neasily acquired perceptual knowledge, including that acquired by other\nsense modalities. So, for a very wide range of cases all involving, we\nare supposing, non-inferential perceptual knowledge acquisition,\nactual access will be quite plausible. In those cases it seems right\nto think that you are aware of the knowledge basis, the specific\nperceptual experience and its content, in which you engage when the\nknowledge is first secured.\n\nEven so, Actual Access knowledge internalism is not plausible when\ntaken in full generality, for these perceptual cases make up only a\nsmall portion of one's knowledge. We need only notice that most of\none's knowledge is stored knowledge, that is, knowledge one gained at\nan earlier time and has since retained. Imagine that a person knows\nthat Illinois was Abraham Lincoln's home state. She acquired this\nknowledge years before, while in elementary school, and has retained\nit ever since. It is most implausible to think that she is now aware\nof her knowledge basis for this knowledge about Lincoln, and this in\ntwo important senses. First, it is hardly likely that she is now aware\nof her original knowledge basis, whatever that may have been back in\nelementary school. Also, second, it is most likely that she has no\ncurrent awareness of her present knowledge basis, presumably something\nto do with ongoing stable memory. Of course, some people will have\nsuch awareness, but we should not let this fact lead us to the\nconclusion that every person with this knowledge of Lincoln's home\nstate will be aware of the workings of memory. We should, thus, reject\nActual Access knowledge internalism as implausible.\n2. Accessibility and Internalism\n\nMost likely, defenders of internalism about knowledge will be unfazed\nby this rejection. Much more plausible, and also much more likely to\nbe the actual view internalists have in mind, is Accessibility\nknowledge internalism. It requires only that one can become aware of\nthe knowledge basis, either by easy and quick reflection in some\ncases, or by more difficult and lengthy reflection in others. What\nmatters, however, is not the temporal length of the reflection, but\nrather that this is an awareness one can achieve merely by reflection.\nAnd there is something right about this, because we all engage in this\nsort of activity all the time, often with good success. We can, then,\nfocus attention on Accessibility knowledge internalism.\n\nAccess to a knowledge basis can itself be thought of in two ways. One\nmight be capable of attaining awareness of what is in fact one's\nknowledge basis, but without also being capable of being aware that\nthis item is one's knowledge basis. Or, one might actually be capable\nof attaining awareness that some item is one's knowledge basis. The\ndifference is this: in the first case, one might have an awareness\ndirected at what is in fact a knowledge basis, but without realizing\nthat it is one's knowledge basis; while in the second sort of case,\none's awareness is directed at the fact that some item is one's\nknowledge basis. \n\nBy making use of this distinction in the knowledge case, we can\nspecify two different versions of Accessibility knowledge internalism\n(AKI), a weak form and a strong form. (Hereafter it will be presumed\nthat we are speaking only of Accessibility knowledge internalism, and\nwe can speak of weak and strong AKI.)\n\nWeak AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of what is in fact one's knowledge basis for p.\nStrong AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection that some item is one's knowledge basis for p.\n\n\nIn the geese example, given earlier, the weak version would tell us\nthat one can become aware by reflection of the fact that someone has\ntestified to the presence of geese. By contrast, the strong version\nwould go beyond this and say that one can become aware by reflection\nthat this testimony counts as one's knowledge basis for one's belief\nabout the geese.\n\nThe two definitions as presently stated may be thought of as\ncomplete knowledge basis versions of knowledge\ninternalism, for they both demand a form of accessibility to all of\none's knowledge basis for any given piece of knowledge. There are,\nhowever, a great many cases where one has a multiplicity of knowledge\nbases for an item of knowledge. For instance, if one comes to know\nthat p as a result of a lengthy piece of reasoning, as in the\nconstruction of a mathematical proof with many steps, then one has\nmany knowledge bases standing behind one's knowledge that p.\nOr we can think of perceptual cases where one comes to have knowledge\nbased upon a complex assortment of perceptual cues, all of which count\nas knowledge bases, but only some of which are accessible by\nreflection. It would be much too stringent a requirement to insist\nthat a person must be capable of becoming aware by reflection of\nall of her knowledge bases, for every piece of knowledge she\nthen possesses. If that were a requirement, then probably neither weak\nnor strong AKI would have any plausibility at all. Hence, the two\ndefinitions require some amendment, which we can easily provide.\n\nWeak AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection of what is in fact some essential part of one's knowledge\nbasis for p.\nStrong AKI:\n\nOne knows some proposition p only if one can become aware by\nreflection that some item k is some essential part of one's\nknowledge basis for p.\n\n\nWe may think of these two definitions of knowledge internalism as\npartial knowledge basis accounts, for each requires\nonly some form of accessibility to some element or elements of one's\nknowledge basis. We will confine attention to these two partial\nknowledge basis accounts.\n\nThe use of the term \u2018essential\u2019 in weak and strong AKI is\nimportant. Imagine that one's knowledge basis for proposition\np is quite complex, including a number of different elements.\nPerhaps one has amassed a good bit of evidence concerning p,\nand the cumulative effect is to make up one's knowledge basis for\np. It may be that some element in this evidence base is\ninessential, in the sense that even if one were to delete\nthat element, the remaining evidence would still constitute a\nknowledge basis for p. A case like this might well arise when\none has amassed an over-abundance of evidence, perhaps with the aim of\nbeing especially careful and diligent. Without the use of the term\n\u2018essential\u2019 in the above definitions, we would allow for\ncases in which a person was capable of becoming aware of what was in\nfact an inessential part of her knowledge basis for\np. This would unfairly saddle the internalist with an\nunnecessarily implausible position, and the use of the term\n\u2018essential\u2019 is designed to avoid that consequence.\n\nKnowledge externalism, at least with respect to accessibility, is\ngenerally regarded as just the denial of knowledge internalism. If we\nhad rested content with knowledge internalism as we first stated it,\nwhich required some form of accessibility to all of one's\nknowledge basis, then knowledge externalism would just be the denial\nof that internalist position. But that would not be an interesting\nknowledge externalist position. For, denying that one can access by\nreflection all of one's knowledge basis for a proposition p\nis perfectly compatible with one being able to access some of one's\nknowledge basis for p, indeed some essential part of that\nbasis. Knowledge externalism, however, wants to incorporate the idea\nthat in some cases one cannot access any of one's knowledge\nbasis. Knowledge externalism, then, aims to deny the partial knowledge\nbasis accounts. As we have two of the latter we will naturally expect\nto find two versions of externalism with respect to accessibility. A\nweak version of accessibility externalism for knowledge will deny\nmerely the strong version of AKI, thus:\n\nWeak AKE:\n\nIt is false that: one knows some proposition p only if one\ncan become aware by reflection that some item or other k is a\nknowledge basis for p.\n\n\nWeak externalism of this variety is perfectly compatible with one form\nof accessibility internalism concerning knowledge, namely weak AKI.\nDefenders of externalism, however, most likely would be interested in\ngoing beyond this weak form to an externalist position that is more\nwide-ranging. This stronger version of externalism would be this:\n\nStrong AKE:\n\nIt is false that: one knows some proposition p only if one\ncan become aware by reflection of some essential knowledge basis for\np.\n\n\nThis position is thus denying that the ability to become aware of an\nessential knowledge basis is a necessary condition on having\nknowledge. The proponent of strong AKE can allow that in some cases\none might have this ability. Her denial is that one has it in all\ncases, for each piece of knowledge one happens to possess.\n\nStrong AKE is so called because it rejects even the weak version of\nknowledge internalism. And since weak knowledge internalism is\nincluded in strong knowledge internalism as a part, as per comments\nmade above concerning statements A and B, we may say that strong AKE\nalso rejects strong knowledge internalism. Put more generally, we can\nsay that strong AKE rejects knowledge internalism across the\nboard.\n3. Justification and Internalism\n\nKnowledge internalism and externalism have been less extensively\ndiscussed in recent literature than justification internalism and\nexternalism. These two opposing theses focus on justified belief\nrather than knowledge, though there are close parallels. Consider\nagain the Canada geese example, and suppose that the testimony you\nreceive from another person produces in you the justified belief that\nthere are geese in the park. We may also suppose that this justified\nbelief falls short of knowledge. We can say that a justifier\nfor this belief is the testimony one has received from the other\nperson. Here a justifier is an analog of what was termed above a\nknowledge basis and, as in the latter case, we will allow\nthat justifiers can be other beliefs, or experiences, or facts about\nthe production of the belief. Philosophers take different stances on\nwhat legitimate justifiers may be, so that it is difficult to come up\nwith an account of justifiers that is neutral between competing\ntheories of epistemic justification. It will not do to say that\neverything relevant to a person's justified belief at some time counts\nas a justifier for that belief. For that would count possession of the\nconcepts that are necessary for one to understand a belief that p as\namong the justifiers for that belief, and clearly that would be a\nmistake. Instead, we can say this: The justifiers for a given\njustified belief are those items that make up or constitute the\nperson's justification for that belief at that time. They are those\nitems, whether experiences, states of affairs, or other beliefs, on\nwhich the person's current justification is based. (the term\n\u2018justifier\u2019 comes from Alston 1989, 189).\n\nWhen one has a justified belief, one is sometimes also aware of the\njustifiers for that belief. And perhaps, for any justified belief and\naccompanying justifiers, one can become aware of the justifiers, and\ndo this merely by reflection. This is the core idea behind\njustification internalism. As with knowledge internalism, this core\nidea has to do with a form of access, in this case access to the\njustifiers. Further, continuing the parallel with knowledge\ninternalism, justification internalism can be construed as having weak\nand strong forms: weak and strong accessibility justification\ninternalism. We may here safely assume that access\ninternalism concerning justification will be no more plausible that\nits cousin regarding knowledge, discussed above; hence, access\ninternalism regarding justification will be passed over in favor of\nversions stressing accessibility rather than actual access.\n\nStill, there is the question of whether justification internalism\ndemands accessibility of all of the justifiers for a given\njustified belief or only some of them. Discussions of justification\ninternalism have tended to focus on the former of these. Here are some\npassages that point in this direction.\n\nInternalism\u2026treats justifiedness as a purely internal matter:\nif p is justified for S, then S must be\naware (or at least be immediately capable of being aware) of what\nmakes it justified and why. (Bach 1985, 250; quoted in Alston 1989,\n212)\n\n\nWe presuppose, second, that the things we know are justified for us in\nthe following sense: we can know what it is, on any occasion, that\nconstitutes our grounds, or reason, or evidence for thinking that we\nknow. (Chisholm 1977, 17; quoted in Alston 1989, 212.)\n\n\nThe most explicit statement of this view comes from Carl Ginet:\n\nEvery one of every set of facts about S's position that\nminimally suffices to make S, at a given time, justified in\nbeing confident that p must be directly recognizable to\nS at that time. (Ginet 1975, 34; quoted in Alston 1989, 213)\n\n\nIn line with these sentiments, we could define two concepts of\naccessibility justification internalism, analogous to knowledge\ninternalism that requires accessibility of the complete knowledge\nbasis. We would have these two theses:\n\nWeak AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection of all of one's justifiers for p.\nStrong AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection that some item j makes up all of one's\njustification for p.\n\n\nWith strong AJI as just given, the item j might be a single\njustifier, perhaps a single previously justified belief; or it might\nbe a complex, taking any number of contributing justifiers as\nelements, as would be the case with a complex of many previously\njustified beliefs making up one's evidence for p. What is to\nbe stressed is that in both weak and strong AJI as here defined,\nability to access all of the justifiers is required; this is a demand\nfor accessibility of the complete justification basis, we might say,\non a par with the earlier discussion of a complete knowledge basis.\nThese are, then, complete justifier accounts of weak and\nstrong AKI.\n\nIt is unlikely, however, that these two forms of justification\ninternalism will stand up to close scrutiny. To see this, consider a\ncase of rapid acquisition of many justified beliefs at a single moment\nor in a very short and hurried period of time. We need only think of\nsome emergency situation where very swift reactions are needed, and\nwhere the presence of the emergency is based upon a host of sensory\ncues. In such cases a person will often acquire a battery of justified\nbeliefs, all pretty much in an instant of time, and quick action on\nthose beliefs is necessary to avert some disaster or other unwanted\nconsequence. Certainly the person cannot access, at the acquisition\nmoment, all of the justifiers for each of these newly acquired\njustified beliefs; she is too busy taking steps to avert the disaster.\nNor should we think that she will be able to access all of the\njustifiers for those beliefs at a later, and calmer time; for, however\ngood her memory might be, it is just unrealistic to suppose that each\nperson will be able to recall all of those justifiers for every one of\nthose justified beliefs. This would be too great a demand to place on\nmemory in the interests of an epistemological theory. It is better to\ngive up the epistemological theory in favor of something more\nfeasible. Such a view is easy enough to come by; we simply weaken\nthings to yield partial justifier accounts of justification\ninternalism.\n\nWeak AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware by reflection of some essential justifier one then has for\np.\nStrong AJI:\n\nOne has a justified belief that p only if one can become\naware that some item j is an essential justifier one then has\nfor p.\n\n\nWe thus see that weak and strong internalism regarding justification\nare straight analogs of weak and strong internalism regarding\nknowledge. Further, these versions of justification internalism are\nmuch more plausible than the complete justifier versions of\njustification internalism. It is, after all, easier for just about any\ncognizer to access some essential justifier in any given case than it\nis to access all of them.\n\nAnother important point concerns the time at which one does or could\nbecome aware of essential justifiers. We have hitherto spoken as\nthough the internalist is demanding that each cognizer have the\nability at any given moment to then become aware of\nessential justfiers for each of her justified beliefs. There is no\nreason why internalism should be understood in this fashion. To see\nthe point, imagine that some essential justifier j, for\nbelief b, itself has five sub-elements, where each of these\nis an essential justifier. Perhaps the cognizer can become aware, by\nreflection, of two of these elements of j at a single time,\nbut become aware of the remaining three only after much reflection\nlasting some period of time. Nothing in the internalist picture should\nrule this out. What is essential is that the awareness be achieved by\ndirect reflection, and not that it all occur at a moment.\n\nMichael Bergmann (2009) gives a definition that is akin to Strong AJI.\nIt is this:\n\nPotential Doxastic Strong Awareness Requirement (PDSAR):\n\nS's belief B is justified only if (i) there is\nsomething, X, that contributes to the justification of B\nand (ii) S is able on reflection alone to be aware of X\nin such a way that S justifiably believes that X is in\nsome way relevant to the appropriateness of holding B.\n(Bergmann 2006, 16)\n\n\nWhat Bergmann takes as the relevant contributing factor is what was\ncalled in Strong AJI a justifier, though his definition does not\nrequire that the contributing factor be essential to the justification\nfor belief B. Some defenders of access internalism might object that\nthey are not committed to the potential awareness of a contributor to\njustification being relevant to the appropriateness of holding the\ntarget belief, as specified in PDSAR. However, this issue will not be\na factor in what follows.\n\nExternalism with regard to justification is also analogous to\nknowledge externalism. That is, the weak form of justification\nexternalism is a thesis that merely denies strong AJI, and is\nperfectly compatible with weak AJI. More interesting is strong\njustification externalism, or strong AJE, namely:\n\nStrong AJE:\n\nIt is false that: one has a justified belief that p only if\none can become aware of some justifier or other for one's belief that\np.\n\n\nThe idea here is that it is false that one is always in a position to\naccess at least one justifier for each one of one's justified beliefs;\nin some cases, one is unable to access by reflection any of the\njustifiers, and this fact does nothing to impugn or weaken one's\njustification for the belief. For an illustration, think again of the\nemergency situation where one gains a number of beliefs nearly all at\nonce, all of them justified by a number of different justifiers. It is\nplausible to think that in some cases of this sort, one is unable to\naccess merely by reflection any of the justifiers, either at the\nmoment of belief acquisition or at any later time. Notice that strong\nAJE does not contend that one is never able to access\nrelevant justifiers. It claims instead that there are some cases where\none cannot become aware by reflection of any of one's justifiers for a\nbelief that p, and that this fact does not undercut one's\njustification for believing that p.\n\nOne way to see the import of the externalist position regarding\njustification is by means of examples. The case described earlier\nwherein one gains a great number of justified perceptual beliefs all\nin a short and very compressed time span seems appropriate to this\npurpose. Another method for getting a sense of the externalist\nposition is by consideration of a theory of epistemic justification\nthat is consistent with it. A simple version of the reliable process\ntheory of justification will illustrate the point (see Goldman 1979,\nfor a classic statement):\n\nA person S is justified in believing a proposition p\nif and only if S's belief that p is produced or\nsustained by a process or method M and M is\nreliable.\n\nIn this illustrative context we may think of the reliability of\nM as the actual frequency with which true beliefs are\nproduced or sustained by M. If more true beliefs have been\nproduced or sustained by M than false beliefs, then\nM is reliable. The main point for present purposes is this:\nbeing so produced or sustained suffices for justification of belief.\nNothing more is required, either of the process M or the\nepistemic agent S. Since this is so, then nothing\nfurther is required concerning accessibility to S of\nany of her justifiers for belief that p. \n\nThis theory is illustrative only. No defender of a reliable process\ntheory of justification is apt to regard reliability as determined\nmerely by the actual frequency of true versus false belief production\nor sustenance. Instead, reliability would be thought of as a\npropensity that a method M has to produce or sustain\nmostly true beliefs. This important point about how to best understand\nreliability, however, will not affect the point just made concerning\nreliable process theories and externalism regarding justification.\nExactly the same argument will apply when reliability is understood as\na propensity. Reliability of that sort as applied to process\nM will suffice for the belief to be justified.. Accessibility\nvia reflection to any of the justifiers, if present as a capability in\nS, will not be relevant to her being justified in believing\np, and neither will the absence of such a capability. So, if\nthe reliable process theory as here depicted is correct as an account\nof justified belief, then internalism regarding justification would be\nfalse. This point about lack of access to justifiers is the main\ncontention of the externalist thesis regarding justification. (The\nactual long run frequency and propensity interpretations of\nreliability were clearly noted in Goldman 1979, 11. Reference to\njustifiers is not there made by Goldman; that term came into use about\na decade later in work by Alston. Goldman gives more refined and\ncomplex statements of the theory, making use of J-rules, in Goldman\n1986, 2009.) \n4. Other Forms of Internalism\n\nIt might be thought that one's view as to exactly what sorts of things\ncount as justifiers will also determine whether one is committed to\njustification internalism or justification externalism. This question\nis bound up with another way of drawing the distinction between\ninternalism and externalism, namely, with the view that restricts\njustifiers to items that are literally internal to the cognizer. One\nversion of this position is perspectival internalism, to use\na phrase coined by William Alston, which in one of his formulations\ncomes to this:\n\nPI: The only thing that can justify S's belief that\np is some other justified beliefs of S. (Alston,\n1989. Epistemic Justification, p. 191.)\n\n\nThese other justified beliefs, of course, would be the justifiers, and\nsince they are beliefs that the person S has, they count as\ninternal to S in the sense that they are internal to\nS's overall mental framework.\n\nClosely related to perspectival internalism is a somewhat broader\nthesis according to which all justifiers are mental states of\ncognizers. This thesis has been termed \u201cmentalism\u201d by Earl\nConee and Richard Feldman. Making use of some ideas suggested by\nMatthias Steup, John Pollock, and Ernest Sosa, they say that this\nversion of internalism,\n\n\u2026is the view that a person's beliefs are justified only by\nthings that are\u2026internal to the person's mental life. We shall\ncall this version of internalism \u201cmentalism.\u201d (Conee and\nFeldman 2001. p. 233)\n\n\nMentalism is broader than PI because it does not restrict the\njustifiers to justified beliefs, nor even to beliefs. So, mentalism\nbut not PI is perfectly compatible with a view that says that sensory\nstates that are themselves not beliefs and not things that can be\nappropriately said to be justified can nonetheless function as\njustifiers. A very simple example that illustrates the difference\nwould be one in which a person acquires a justified belief that there\nis a tomato in front of her on the basis of a perceptual experience of\nsomething looking red and spherical. Mentalism can allow that this\nvery experience of something looking red and spherical is a justifier\nfor the belief that there is a tomato present. For PI, by contrast, if\nthis experience is to contribute to the justified tomato belief, it\nwould have to be because one has a justified belief about something\nappearing red and spherical. In short, mentalism allows that the very\nexperience may count as a justifier, while PI requires that a\njustified belief, presumably about that experience, is the appropriate\njustifier.\n\nA somewhat weaker form of mentalism would maintain only that for each\njustified belief a person has, some essential justifiers for that\nbelief are mental states of that person, but that other essential\njustifiers for that belief need not be mental states. Such an account\nwould not be a wholly internalist account, of course, in either the\nmentalist sense or the accessibility sense, for these further\nessential justifiers need be neither mental states nor particularly\naccessible to reflective awareness. The account would rather be one\nthat contained both some internalist elements (some essential\njustifiers are mental states) and some externalist elements (some\nessential justifiers are not mental states). The result would count,\ntherefore, as a mixed theory, though the theory might be\notherwise perfectly viable as a general account of justified\nbelief.\n\nSince externalism with respect to justification contrasts with\ninternalism, we should expect there to be an externalist contrast to\nmentalism. The denial of mentalism would simply be the view that holds\nthat something other than mental states of a cognizer can qualify as\ngenuine justifiers. Once again we can illustrate such a position by\nconsidering a reliable process theory of justification. On that theory\nreliability is defined across mental states, so one might think that\nthe theory is either mentalist or that at least it strongly overlaps\nthe mentalist doctrine. That is, the theory directs our attention to\nbelief-formation processes and belief-sustaining processes, and both\nof them take some mental states as inputs and yield other mental\nstates as outputs. The simplest version of the former might be a\nperceptual case in which the inputs are sensory states and the outputs\nare beliefs. Or, if one thinks of the process of reaching a new belief\nthrough reasoning, the inputs are some prior beliefs and the outputs\nare new beliefs. The difference between this theory and mentalism\ncomes in the fact that for reliabilism the inputs and outputs, though\ncertainly mental, are not themselves justifiers. These inputs\nare, of course, highly relevant to the justification of the belief.\nHowever, this relevance does not suffice to make the inputs\njustifiers, any more than possession of relevant concepts needed to\nunderstand a belief would count as a justifier for that belief.\nRather, it is the reliability of the processes in which these inputs\nand outputs figure that count as appropriate justifiers. So, in\naddition to being an externalist theory with regard to accessibility,\nthe reliable process theory is externalist with regard to whether the\njustifiers for a belief are or have to be mental states. The\nexternalist with regard to this issue insists that they need not\nbe.\n5. Deontological Justification\n\nThere is one additional view that is often thought of as internalist\nin epistemology, namely the idea that the concept of justification is\na deontological concept. In saying this, what is meant is\nthat being epistemically justified in believing something is bound up\nwith, or to be analyzed in terms of, one's living up to one's\nintellectual duties or responsibilities. We can easily think of cases\nwhere justification and obligation seem to be closely connected. When\na scientist runs an elaborate experiment in the attempt to confirm\nsome hypothesis H, and she gathers more and more evidence\nthat tends to bear on and confirm H, we tend to suppose that\nshe has an intellectual duty or obligation to follow the evidence\nwherever it goes and to believe in accord with that evidence. She\nshould not tailor her beliefs, in other words, to non-evidential\nfactors such as her desire to believe something incompatible with\nH, or her emotional attachment to some proposition\nincompatible with H. Nor should one's religious or political\nbeliefs get in the way; one's intellectual duty is to follow the\nevidence and to believe in accord with it, even in cases where the\nevidence seems to overthrow a proposition one would dearly like to see\nconfirmed.\n\nOne may well wonder why the thesis that the concept of epistemic\njustification is deontological has any connection to internalism. That\nthe justification of a belief is a matter of living up to one's\nintellectual duties, after all, has no obvious bearing on\naccessibility to the justifiers for any given belief, nor to any\nspecial view as to the nature of those justifiers, such as may be\ngiven in mentalism. This question is addressed more fully below. At\nthis point what we can say is that the deontological concept of\njustification has some internalist component because it seems related\nto a kind of control over beliefs that the epistemic agent may be\nthought to have. If one is intellectually obligated to take on a\nbelief given one's evidence, then one must be capable of doing so.\nThis point is underwritten by the general principle that Ought\nimplies Can, i.e., one has an obligation to do action A\nonly if one can do A. If one has the ability to take on new\nbeliefs given one's evidence, then one has some form of control over\nbelief formation, a control that is lodged in the epistemic agent.\nThis is the sense of \u201cinternal\u201d ingredient in the\ndeontological conception of justification, and it is this that makes\nthat concept a species of epistemic internalism.\n\nIt is now easy to see what the corresponding form of externalism with\nrespect to the concept of justification would be. It would be an\naccount of that concept that steers completely clear of talk of\nintellectual duties or responsibilities, but instead analyzes the\nconcept of justification in some other way, perhaps in terms of degree\nof evidential support or in terms of being truth-conducive.\n6. Some Possible Interconnections\n\nWe have isolated three different forms of internalism regarding\njustification, and it is natural to ask how, if at all, they might be\nrelated to one another. Accessibility internalism, for example, seems\nto be strongly related to mentalism. If we ask, what might qualify as\naccessible by reflection, it is difficult to see what else there might\nbe except for one's own mental states. The relationship between these\ntwo forms of internalism is not apt to be entailment; for, it is at\nleast conceivable that one has access via reflection to some state of\naffairs in the non-mental world. Still, we may safely say that if\naccessibility internalism is true, this is evidence in favor of\nmentalism.\n\nThe evidence is particularly strong if we focus on complete\njustifier versions of accessibility internalism. On that view it\nis held that all of the justifiers for any given belief are\naccessible by reflection. If it is true in fact that\neverything that is accessible by reflection is a mental state, then\nmentalism will follow directly from this fact coupled with complete\njustifier internalism. With a partial justifier account of\naccessibility internalism, which we noted earlier is the more\nplausible internalist position, matters are different. On that view it\nis required that the cognizer merely be able to access by reflection\nsome of the justifiers for any given belief. Hence, this\nposition will permit cases in which the justifiers that are accessible\nby reflection are all mental states, but other inaccessible justifiers\nare not. Mentalism, though, is a view about the character of\nall of the justifiers, to the effect that all justifiers are\nmental states. So, while we can agree that a partial justifier account\nof accessibility internalism is evidence for mentalism, the evidence\nis not as strong as one might initially expect.\n\nNeither does mentalism entail accessibility internalism. It is a\nfamiliar point that not all of one's mental states are accessible, but\nthat some are only brought to conscious awareness by medical\nprocedures. Moreover, the example used earlier in which one gains a\nmultitude of new justified beliefs in a rapidly changing perceptual\ncontext, all backed by a variety of sensory justifiers, strongly\nsuggests that there will be many justifiers that will not be\naccessible via reflection even though they are mental states. So\nmentalism might well be correct even when accessibility internalism is\nnot.\n\nThere would be a tight connection between mentalism and accessibility\ninternalism if all of the mental states that are justifiers for\nbeliefs were occurrent mental states. That is, if all of these states\nwere attentively before the mind when one held a justified belief,\nthen those states would then be accessible via introspection. Here we\nassume that if some mental state occurrently exists or obtains at some\ntime, then one can turn one's attention to that state at that time.\nHowever, occurrent justifiers make up but a tiny percentage of the\njustifiers standing behind the large numbers of justified beliefs any\nperson will have at any time. Any adult cognizer, for instance, is apt\nto have many thousands of justified beliefs at any moment, with very\nfew if any of them occurrent at a given time, and all of them backed\nby justifiers. If all of these justifiers are mental states, as\nmentalism contends, most of them would be buried deep in one's mental\nstorehouse, beyond the reach of reflective awareness.\n\nA possible response to this line of thought would be to point out that\ntypically a person can think of a justification for her justified\nbeliefs, even for cases where one's justified beliefs and their\nrespective justifiers have been stored in the mind for a long time.\nConsider again the case of one's justified belief that Illinois was\nLincoln's home state. For most people this belief is justified, but\nhardly ever occurrent, and neither are its justifiers. On an occasion\nwhen the belief is occurrent one may be able to supply a\njustification for it. For instance one might note that one must have\nlearned this fact in elementary school, and that one had entertained\nthis fact on earlier occasions since the belief was first acquired.\nThese are thoughts one has on the present occasion and so are mental\nstates; and they are items of awareness and thus accessible to\nreflective awareness. So even when the justifiers that are mental\nstates are not directly accessible, we might think, some justifiers\nare always available to reflection, because we can think of what would\nserve to justify current beliefs. So mentalism does after all entail\naccessibility, because one can always provide or think of a\njustification.\n\nIt cannot be denied that people very often can supply justification\nfor their beliefs. It can be wondered, however, whether this is always\nso. Supplying a justification is a fairly sophisticated activity, and\nmany children would be poorly equipped to engage in it. Yet surely\nthese children have justified beliefs. Another perhaps more\nfundamental point is this: it is not clear that the justification one\nwould supply on some occasion constitutes the set of justifiers one\nthen has for that belief. In the case at hand, one is now justified in\nbelieving that Illinois was Lincoln's home state. Further, one has\nbeen justified in believing this for some time, including the time\nperiod immediately before one attempted to supply a justification.\nHence, prior to making that attempt, one already has, or there already\nare in place, some justifiers for that belief about Lincoln. The only\nalternatives to thinking this would be to say either that on this\noccasion, prior to supplying a justification, nothing justifies one's\nbelief about Lincoln, though the belief itself is justified\nnonetheless; or that the belief is not justified, contrary to\nappearances. Neither of these possibilities seems at all plausible,\nhowever, so we need to allow that there are some justifiers for the\nLincoln belief prior to and independently of one's attempt to think up\na justification. Indeed, the most natural thing to say about thesse\ncases of justified beliefs of long standing is that the fact that\nthese beliefs have been stored in memory is what makes up their\njustification. Thus, even if we presume that every cognizer is always\nin a position to provide a justification, this point does not serve to\nshow that mentalism entails accessibility internalism. (Goldman 2009,\n323, has a good discussion of memory preservation in relation to cases\nlike that of the belief that Illinois was Lincoln's home state.\nGoldman also discusses problems that may arise for the memory\npreservation account.)\n\nThe deontological concept of justification could be conjoined with\neither accessibility internalism or with mentalism. But these latter\ntwo forms of internalism are not logically connected to the\ndeontological concept. Advocates of the deontological concept of\njustification are defending a thesis concerning the meaning of the\nterm \u2018justified,\u2019 and by itself this thesis concerning the\nmeaning of the term has no implications for what the actual justifiers\nmay turn out to be. Hence, if it were a fact that the concept of\nepistemic justification is deontological, this fact would not imply\nmentalism. Nor does mentalism entail the correctness of the\ndeontological concept. For mentalism is compatible with a concept of\njustification defined in terms of degree of evidential support, or\nadequacy of evidential support, and there is nothing particularly\ndeontic about either of these ideas. Exactly the same may be said of\naccessibility internalism. It readily conjoins with a concept of\njustification of either of these evidential sorts, and so\naccessibility internalism does not entail that a deontological concept\nof justification is correct.\n\nThe reverse may be true, however. That is, if justification is really\na deontological concept, this fact may have implications for\naccessibility. Further, since we saw earlier that accessibility\ninternalism is some evidence for mentalism, the correctness of the\ndeontological concept would also have some bearing on mentalism. This\nline of thought is taken up in the next two sections, where arguments\nin favor of various forms of internalism are considered.\n7. Arguments For Internalism\n\nOne line of argument that can be offered in favor of accessibility\ninternalism, though one that has seldom found explicit expression in\nthe literature, trades on the idea that one is justified in believing\np only if one has justified the belief that\np. (Leite 2003 discusses the connection between being\njustified and justifying.) Justifying a belief, of course, is an\nactivity in which one adduces evidence or reasons in favor of the\nbelief, and when one is engaged in this activity one is actively aware\nof the evidence or reasons brought forward. Of course, if one actually\nis aware of these bits of evidence or reasons, then certainly one can\nbe aware of them. These items of evidence or reasons offered in the\nact of justifying, we may say, are the justifiers for the belief in\nquestion. Hence, if being justified implies having\njustified, then being justified implies that one can be aware of the\njustifiers. So, we might conclude, the mere fact that there are\njustified beliefs implies accessibility internalism.\n\nThere are, however, two important problems with this argument. First,\nthe major premise of the argument seems false. A very large percentage\nof one's of justified beliefs were never justified in the manner\nenvisioned. We need only recall the example of rapid acquisition of\nmany perceptual beliefs, all of them justified. But none were\njustified by any activity engaged in by the cognizer, either at the\nmoment of acquisition or at any later time. Moreover, second, even if\neach justified belief was at some time justified, this fact implies\nonly that there was some time at which the cognizer could be aware by\nreflection of the relevant justifiers. It hardly follows that the\ncognizer can be reflectively aware of these justifiers at any time she\ncares to try, and it is this sort of accessibility that internalism\nrequires. If accessibility internalism were merely the thesis that for\neach justified belief p, there is some time at which the\ncognizer can be aware of the essential justifiers for the belief that\np, then accessibility externalism would become the thesis\nthat there is never a time at which the cognizer can be\nreflectively aware of the relevant justifiers. Yet the externalist\nposition is the much more modest point that there are some cases of\njustified belief where the cognizer is unable to be reflectively aware\nof the essential justifiers. Defense of accessibility internalism on\nthe grounds that being justified implies having actually justified\nwould make externalism into far too strong a thesis.\n\nAnother possible argument for accessibility internalism trades on\nbeing able to justify one's belief. The idea is that one is justified\nin believing p only if one can justify the belief that\np. If one were to actually engage in justifying this belief,\nthen at that time one would be aware of the justifiers. So, if one can\njustify the belief that p, it is reasonable to think that one\ncan be reflectively aware of the justifiers for p.\n\nHere, again, we would have to contend with the examples of young\ncognizers who certainly have justified beliefs but are in no position\nintellectually to justify those beliefs. They simply lack the\ncognitive wherewithal to engage in that sort of activity, but this\nfact does not prevent them from having beliefs that are justified.\nThus, the core idea in this argument for internalism is false. There\nis also another problem, even if the core idea could be sustained. Any\nactivity of actually justifying a belief is context and audience\nsensitive. What one would say by way of justifying the belief that\np in a context of one sort, made up of an audience of highly\nsophisticated cognizers, is apt to be quite different from what one\nwould say in a different context and to an audience of quite\nna\u00efve cognizers. For this reason, it is difficult to say which if\nany of the things one would offer in an activity of justifying would\nactually constitute the set of justifiers for the given belief. What\none would identify as justifiers in such activities would be subject\nto such variability, that it is hard to see how we could select any\nsub-set of such items and safely maintain that they are the\njustifiers.\n\nThe last two arguments, making use of the idea, first, that being\njustified implies having justified, and then second, that being\njustified implies being able to justify, may be taken to show a key\nway that defenders of accessibility internalism may conceive of\njustified belief or knowledge. The paradigm they may have in mind is\nthat being justified in believing that p is a state one\nachieves by working things out, reasoning through some sequence of\nevidentiary steps and then drawing a conclusion that counts as the\njustified belief. When one engages in reasoning of this type one is\naware of the steps through which one reasons and, inter alia,\nalso aware of the justifiers that serve to support one's conclusion.\nFollowing this line of thought, it is perhaps natural to think that\none can recapitulate at a later time the reasoning one went through\nenroute to one's justified belief. If this is so, then surely one can\njustify one's belief, and thus be reflectively aware of the justifiers\nfor that belief.\n\nIt cannot be denied that one often arrives at beliefs, including\njustified ones, in just this fashion. It should also be clear,\nhowever, that a great many beliefs, including many justified ones, are\nnot acquired or sustained in this manner. We need only remind\nourselves of how much knowledge and justified belief is gotten from\nperceptual experience and we then realize that a great many items of\nknowledge and justified belief are not arrived at via reasoning,\nhowever generously we construe that operation.\n8. A General Argument for Internalism\n\nA general argument for accessibility internalism has been proposed on\nbehalf of the internalist, and this reconstructed argument has the\nmerit of being extendable to mentalism (Goldman 1999; note that\nGoldman is well-known for defending externalism and is thus no friend\nof internalism). Internalists often adopt a specific deontological\nposition, namely a \u201cbelief-guidance\u201d position, or a\nguidance deontological concept (GD concept). The idea behind\nGD is that one ought to guide the formation of one's beliefs by the\namount and strength of the evidence one has on hand, and this\ncertainly has a deontological ring to it. This guidance theme is\nslightly different from what we have identified as the deontological\nconcept of justification, for that is a thesis about what \u2018being\nepistemically justified\u2019 means. The GD conception, on the other\nhand, is a thesis about how a person ought to go about forming her\nbeliefs. With this distinction drawn, the general argument for\ninternalism is straightforward:\n\n\nThe guidance-deontological (GD) conception of justification is\nposited.\nA certain constraint on the determiners of justification is\nderived from the GD conception, that is, the constraint that all\njustification determiners must be accessible to, or knowable by, the\nepistemic agent.\nThe accessibility or knowability constraint is taken to imply that\nonly internal conditions qualify as legitimate determiners of\njustification. So, justification must be a purely internal affair.\n(Goldman 1999, 207-208.)\n\n\n\nIn the terms that have been used in this paper, what is gestured\ntoward in step (3) by saying that \u201cjustification must be a\npurely internal affair\u201d is just mentalism as we have construed\nit. And plainly a form of accessibility internalism is what is being\nnoted in (2), though this argument does not distinguish between\nwhether all or only some of the justifiers (determiners) are to be\naccessible. The inference from (2) to (3), however, certainly seems to\nsuppose that accessibility internalism implies mentalism, a move that\nwas found questionable earlier in this article.\n\nThe point about complete justifier accounts matters for the evaluation\nof this argument for internalism. As we noted earlier, complete\njustifier accounts of accessibility internalism provide strong support\nfor mentalism. If complete justifier accounts were considered, premise\n(3) would have some ring of plausibility. However, we have seen,\ncomplete justifier versions of accessibility internalism are too\nstrong; and, partial justifier accounts considerably weaken the\nsupport for mentalism. Considering premise (3) in the light of\npartial justifier accounts of accessibility, we would have to\nsay at once that (3) is false. Partial justifier accounts do not even\nprovide strong support for mentalism, let alone imply it.\n\nThere is also a problem with premise (1), concerning the GD conception\nof justification. While it is true that some philosophers who have\naccepted internalism, of either the accessibility or mentalist forms,\nhave also accepted this GD conception, they need not\ndo so. Indeed, some leading internalists explicitly reject the GD\nconception and any deontological concept that is proposed as an\nanalysis of the concept of justification, and yet this fact has no\neffect on their one important form of internalism, namely mentalism\n(Conee and Feldman 2001). These comments reinforce the comments made\nearlier to the effect that the deontological concept of justification\nis really independent of accessibility internalism and mentalism.\n\nIf accessibility internalism is not to be defended by means of\nsomething like the general argument presented here, then it is most\nlikely one would have to fall back on the arguments given earlier\nconcerning either actually justifying a belief or being capable of\njustifying that belief. As we saw, those arguments break down, thereby\nleaving accessibility internalism wholly unsupported.\n\nThere is another argument for access internalism, one which stresses\nhaving reasons. This argument is presented as a case against\nexternalist accounts of justification and it utilizes examples of\nsubjects who are clairvoyant. In one such example we have a person,\nNorman, who arrives at his belief that the President is in New York\nCity through some clairvoyance process, and we may presume that this\nbelief is true. Norman's exercise of clairvoyance may generally yield\ntrue beliefs in Norman, not just about the President's whereabouts,\nand so clairvoyance, for him, is a reliable belief-forming process,\nand the externalist would have to count Norman's belief about the\nPresident's location as justified. Even so, one can plausibly say,\nNorman is irrational in \u201caccepting beliefs whose provenance can\nonly be a total mystery to [him], whose status is as far as [he] can\ntell no different from that of a stray hunch or arbitrary\nconviction\u201d (BonJour and Sosa 2003, 32; quoted in Bergmann 2006,\n12)\n\nWhat would make the cognizer's belief rational would be if he or she\nwere to have good reasons for holding the believed proposition to be\ntrue. The cognizer may well have reasons for a belief, and these\nreasons may provide some measure of justification for that belief. If\nand maybe only if, the cognizer also has has some awareness of these\njustifying reasons, or the capacity to have such awareness of these\nreasons, will she have some reason to believe the believed proposition\nis true. So, we could conclude that access internalism is quite\nplausible after all, because it is quite plausible to maintain that a\nperson's justification for a belief depends squarely on having reasons\nto believe that the believed proposition is true. Possession of these\nreasons would insure that the belief is not merely a \"stray\nhunch.\"\n\nThe argument about having reasons for belief is thus both an argument\nagainst externalism, and also strong support for endorsing access\ninternalism. If we focus just on that aspect of this argument that is\naimed at externalism, we have what has been called the\n\u2018Subject's Perspective Objection\u2019 (SPO), viz.,\n\nIf the subject holding a belief isn't aware of what that belief has\ngoing for it, then she isn't aware of how its status is any different\nfrom a stray hunch or an arbitrary conviction. From that we may\nconclude that from her perspective it is an accident that her belief\nis true. And that implies that it isn't a justified belief. (Bergmann\n2006, 12)\n\n\nNevertheless, despite the great intuitive appeal of the SPO, and the\nsupport it provides for access internalism, a dilemmatic argument may\namount to an insurmountable obstacle for any form of access\ninternalism (Bergmann 2006).\n\nThis dilemmatic argument starts by distinguishing between\nnonconceptual awareness in which no concept is applied and no judgment\nmade; and strong awareness, which is conceptual. Strong awareness\ninvolves a knowing that or justifiably believing that something is the\ncase. We can adapt this distinction to the two cases of access\ninternalism distinguished earlier, namely weak and strong AJI. To do\nthis we presume that the awareness spoken of in weak AJI is weak,\nnon-conceptual awareness, and that the awareness noted in strong AJI\nis strong awareness. Then, the dillema for the access internalist, so\nadapted, is this: If the access internalist requires strong awareness\nas in strong AJI, then her position will lead to an infinite regress.\nIf, on the other hand, the access internalist settles for\nnon-conceptual awareness, as in weak AJI, then her position will fall\nprey to the SPO, thus undercutting the best case for access\ninternalism. Thus, access internalism should be rejected.\n\nThis dilemma argument can be aimed at both actual and potential\ninternalism awareness, as well as how those might be aligned with\neither propositional or doxastic justification (Bergmann 2006, chap.\n1). Here we will cover just potential awareness aligned with doxastic\njustification; that should be enough to show the strength of the\ndilemma argument.\n\nIf the access internalism understands awareness as non-conceptual\nawareness, then being aware of a justifier would be an event in which\nno concept is applied and no belief is acquired or judgment made. In\nthat case, the event of being aware of the justifier would be no\ndifferent from the cognizer's point of view from an event such as\nbelief acquisition by means of a reliable process. Thus, from that\ncognizer's standpoint, her true belief would be no more than a \"stray\nhunch or arbitrary conviction.\" In this way, the SPO would itself have\nforce against access internalism, rather than help to provide support\nand motivation for access internalism.\n\nGiven this result, the access internalist should, and no doubt would,\nopt for strong awareness, encapsulated here in strong AJI. Then, if a\ncognizer has a justified belief that p, she will be capable of\nknowing that, and so justifiably believing that there is some item\nj that is a justifier for her belief that p. In turn,\nthis will require that she be capable of knowing that, and thus\njustifiably believing that there is some item, j1,\nthat is a justifier for her belief that j is a justifier for\nher belief that p. Then her belief that j1 is\nthis sort of justifier will require that she be capable of knowing\nthat, and so justifiably believing that there is an item,\nj2, that is a justifier for her belief that\nj1 is a justifier for her belief that j is a\njustifier for her belief that p. This will then require that\nshe be capable of knowing that, and so justifiably believing that,\nthere is an item, j3, and so on to infinity. In\norder to have a single justified belief, the cognizer would have to be\ncapable of having an infinite number of further beliefs concerning\njustifiers. (Bergmann 2006; Wedgwood 2002, 352, gives a similar\nargument, though aimed at rational belief.)\n\nThis argument may be taken to show that strong AJI, making use of\nstrong awareness, leads to scepticism. More importantly, the argument\nshows that strong AJI requires that a cognizer with a justified belief\nbe capable of holding justified beliefs of \"ever increasing\ncomplexity\" (Bergmann 2006, p. 16) and this is psychologically\nunrealistic, maybe even psychologically impossible. So, strong AJI\nshould be rejected as untenable. Hence, access internalism is\nimplausible and should be rejected, because neither its weak nor its\nstrong form is acceptable.\n\nThere is a response to the dilemma argument, one that raises\nadditional interesting issues. We focus first on a case of a basic\nbelief. A person has in her visual field a green triangular shape;\nthis is what she experiences. The green triangular shape is the\nexperiential element, and the awareness this cognizer has of that\nelement is \"non-propositional and non-conceptual\" (BonJour 2006, 744).\nIt thus involves no belief or judgment, and no issue of justification\narises for this awareness. In such circumstances, a cognizer will\noften form a belief that there is a green triangular shape in her\nvisual field. The idea is that first the cognizer will entertain the\npropositional claim that there is a green triangular shape in the\nvisual field, and merely by entertaining this propositional claim she\ndoes not thereby have a belief. Rather, she comes to have a belief\nonce she accepts the propositional claim. This point concerning the\ntransition from merely entertaining the propositional claim to\nactually believing it, interesting though it may be, is one that will\nnot figure in the argument as given here.\n\nThere is a third element to be considered, namely the cognizer's\ndirect awareness of \"fit\" between the experiential element and the\npropositional claim. The point can be put this way:\n\nWhat is required \u2026 is that I recognize or apprehend the fit or\nagreement between the two sorts of content. Part of what this requires\nis picking out or noticing the particular experiential element that is\nrelevant. But in addition, having done this, I must also grasp or\nrecognize the agreement between the experiential element and the\nconceptual description embodied in the propositional claim. (BonJour,\n2006: 744)\n\n\nThe general thought is not that the experience of the experiential\nelement by itself justifies the belief in the propositional claim.\nWhat, though, of a position in which the direct awareness of the fit\nor agreement between the two elements does all of the justificatory\nwork? On this account, the experience of the experiential element\ntaken together with the belief in the propositional claim and the fact\nthat there is the relevant fit between these two elements \u2013 all\nof these things taken together provide no justification for the\nbelief. It is only when the cognizer directly recognizes the relevant\nfit that her belief about the green triangular shape is justified.\n\nThe problem with this interpretation of the argument in response to\nthe dilemma argument is that it would not count as a version of access\ninternalism. The reason should be clear: on the above described\naccount, the cognizer is not aware of any justifiers. So it seems best\nto understand this line of argument to be saying this: the fact that\nthe cognizer has the relevant experience of the green traingular\nshape, plus the fact the fact that there is a fit or agreement between\nthe experiential element and the propositional claim provides some\njustification for the belief in that proposition; and the direct\nrecognition of fit or agreement between those elements serves to\nenhance that degree of justification. In this way, the cognizer will\naccess some justifiers when she directly recognizes a fit or agreement\nbetween the experiential element and the propositional claim.\n(Bergmann 2006, 35-36, offers a similar interpretation, though he\nspeaks of contributors to justification rather than justifiers.)\n\nThus the general idea is that this account of the justification of a\nbasic belief avoids the dilemma argument. Part of the reason for\nthinking this is that direct recognition of fit between the\nexperiential element and the propositional claim \"\u2026grows out of\n[my] awareness of the content of the claim and of the corresponding\nexperience. To be sure, I must recognize the fit between the two, but\nthis recognition is not a further, cognitively independent judgment,\nwhich would then require further independent justification, but is\ninstead cognitively guided by and based on those experiences\nthemselves\" (BonJour 2006, 745-46). Another reason the regress is\navoided, according to BonJour, is that the direct recognition of fit\nis not strong awareness, something that is needed to initiate and fuel\nthe regress in the dilemma argument.\n\nPhilosophers who have discussed basic beliefs have often noted that no\nspecial evidence or reasons are needed beyond the having of the\nrelevant experience in order for the belief to count as justified. In\neffect, the response to the dilemma argument is telling us why this is\nis or may be the case. It is not, on this account, because the\nexperience alone justifies the belief, but rather because the\nexperience and the fact that there is a fit between the experiential\ncontent and the proposition believed enables the cognizer to recognize\nthe fit between those elements. This enabling is likely what is meant\nby saying that the direct recognition of fit \"grows out of\" the\nexperience. In that sense, no additional evidence or reasons are\nneeded to effect the justification, and so the regress does not\nbegin.\n\nThat leaves the direct recognition of fit. We know the regress will\nthreaten if direct recognition of fit is strong awareness. Weak\nawareness will not help, because that will lead straight back to the\nSPO, and in any case weak awareness is ruled out as not what is needed\n(BonJour 2003, 747). So, direct recognition of fit must be some form\nof awareness that is, so to speak, intermediate between weak and\nstrong awareness. It is something with some conceptual content, but\ndoes not collapse into strong awareness as one might be inclined to\nthink (Bergmann 2006, 35-38). Perhaps the best conclusion to draw at\nthis point is that this intriguing idea of a direct recognition of\nfit, if further developed and clarified, together with the point about\nenabling made above, will suffice to block the regress in the dilemma\nargument. Without that further clarification and development which\nwould differentiate recognition of fit from strong awareness, however,\nthe dilemma argument would seem to have full force against access\ninternalism.\n9. Attempts to Defend Mentalism\n\nA very strong argument for mentalism has been proposed (Conee and\nFeldman 2001). The argument has two prongs: first, we are given a\nnumber of cases in which the best explanation for why one person has a\nhigher degree of justification than another is that the first person\nhas some specific mental state; and then second, it is argued that the\nmentalist theory can satisfactorily deal with problem cases and\ncriticisms. One of the examples used in the first prong of the\nargument is this:\n\nBob and Ray are sitting in an air-conditioned hotel lobby reading\nyesterday's newspaper. Each has read that it will be very warm today\nand, on that basis, each believes that it is very warm today. Then Bob\ngoes outside and feels the heat. They both continue to believe that it\nis very warm today. But at this point Bob's belief is better\njustified.\n\n\nComment: Bob's justification for the belief was enhanced by his\nexperience of feeling the heat, and thus undergoing a mental change\nwhich so to speak \u201cinternalized\u201d the actual temperature.\nRay had just the forecast to rely on. (Conee and Feldman 2001, p.\n236)\n\n\nThe strength of this argument is that it makes use of something\nindisputable, viz., that Bob's justification is stronger than Ray's;\nand it is hard to think of any other difference between them except\nthat Bob has felt the heat and Ray has not. On the basis of this case\nand a number of similar ones, we can generalize to the conclusion that\n\u201c\u2026every variety of change that brings about or enhances\njustification either internalizes an external fact or makes a purely\ninternal difference\u201d (ibid., 238).\n\nIt is clear that this argument is not decisive, though neither is it\nclaimed to be. The number of cases it examines is very small, of\ncourse, but that is not the principal limitation. The important point\nis that enhancing one's justification, as in Bob's situation, is\ncompatible with the initial justifiers prior to enhancement being\nelements other than the mental states of the individuals involved. The\nexample of Ray and Bob, and the other examples Conee and Feldman give\nin which justification is enhanced, all assume that some degree of\njustification is already on hand before the enhancement event. Nothing\nin their examples gives us reason to suppose that initial\njustification is supplied by mental states. So, while it may be\ngranted that their argument provides some good evidence for mentalism,\nit does not go far enough by itself.\n\nThe second prong of the overall argument for menralism, however, may\nwell make up the difference. In this part of the case for mentalism, a\nnumber of important objections that have been lodged against\ninternalism are addressed, either of the accessibility or the\nmentalist variety, and it is argued that the mentalist position can\naccommodate the points made in the objections. The natural idea is\nthat meeting outstanding objections strengthens the overall argument\nfor mentalism.\n\nOne of these objections and the reply to it brings up what may be the\ndeepest and most fundamental issue dividing mentalist internalists and\nexternalists. First, the objection:\n\n\u2026every traditional form of internalism involves some appeal to\nlogical relations, probabilistic relations, or their ilk.\nFoundationalism requires that nonbasically justified beliefs stand in\nsome suitable logical or probabilistic relations to basic beliefs;\ncoherentism requires that one's system of beliefs be logically\nconsistent, probabilistically coherent, or the like. None of these\nlogical or probabilistic relations is itself a mental state, either a\nconscious or a stored state. So these relations do not qualify as\njustifiers\u2026. (Goldman 1999, 216-217)\n\n\nThe problem, in short, is that justifiers other than or in addition to\nmental states are needed if we are to explicate the justification of\nmany beliefs, and that even defenders of mentalism will have to\nrecognize this point. Not all justifiers, therefore, are mental\nstates, and so mentalism would have to be either abandoned or\nmodified.\n\nThe important question being raised by this objection is whether the\nlogical or probabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers;\nor are the justifiers confined to the entities over which the support\nrelations are to hold? If we think that these support relations\nholding between one's evidence and the beliefs are themselves\njustifiers, then mentalism is compromised (though the mixed mentalist\ntheory cited earlier as a possibility is not thereby affected). A way\nout of the difficulty would be to impose a \u201chigher order\nrequirement\u201d according to which one need be aware of these\nsupport relations. Then, one could say that being aware of these\nrelations is a justifier, as are the mental states making up one's\nevidence; and, of course, awareness is a mental state. Taking this\noption, however, leads to worries about whether all cognizers will be\nin a position to meet the high-order requirement. Recognition of\nlogical and probabilistic support relations, after all, is a fairly\nsophisticated act.\n\nA reply to this argument defends the higher-order requirement. This\nhigher order requirement, \n\n\u2026is not any implausible requirement that one have information\nabout justification. It is merely a requirement that one have evidence\nthat there is a supporting connection \u2014 for instance, the\nlogical consequence relation \u2014 between what is ordinarily\nregarded as one's evidence and what it is evidence for. This evidence\ncan come from direct insight or from any other source. This is\nevidence that people normally have in a variety [of] normal\nsituations. (Conee and Feldman 2001, 253)\n\n\nMany will think, however, that even this awareness of some support\nrelation vaguely characterized is beyond the grasp of some cognizers,\nsuch as young children, who nonetheless have perfectly justified\nbeliefs.\n\nThe other alternative would be to deny that the logical and\nprobabilistic support relations are themselves justifiers. This would\nprotect mentalism from criticism concerning logical and probabilistic\nrelations; the only justifiers would be the mental states themselves.\nJustification for a belief supported by evidence would \u201cgrow out\nof\u201d that evidence with no need for awareness of the support\nconnections.Here is a suggestion for how this might work for very\nsimple cases.\n\nThe general idea is that some propositions, p and q,\nhave a primitive or basic epistemic connection. If p and\nq have this connection, then, necessarily, if a person has a\njustified belief in p, then the person is also justified in\nbelieving q. Perhaps it is part of understanding p\nthat one grasps the connection between p and q.\nThere is, then, no need for additional information about the link\nbetween p and q that a person who is justified in\nbelieving p might lack. (ibid., 252)\n\n\nThe key idea here is what it is to understand a proposition\np. The suggestion is that in very simple cases, where the\nlogical connection between p and q is immediate,\npart of one's understanding of p is to also believe\nq.\n\nThis line of argument depends squarely on a concept of understanding a\nproposition, and its prospect for success awaits development of a\ntheory of understanding. Even if this can be developed in a promising\nway, however, it will work only for very simple logical connections.\nFor more complex logical relations and probabilistic ones holding\nbetween one's evidence and one's belief, the only available mentalist\nalternative would be to embrace the idea of awareness of the support\nrelations. This higher order requirement does not seem to be satisfied\nin all the remaining cases where the support relations have any degree\nof complexity.\n10. A Case for the Deontological Concept\n\nThe deontological concept of justification has not been supported by\nextensive argumentation, unlike the other internalist positions. But\nsome support for this concept can be provided, particularly from a\nclose examination of cases in which a person does not live up to\nsomething we regard as a norm, and with the result that justification\nis lacking. A striking example of just this sort concerns a\nclairvoyant named Maud.\n\nMaud believes herself to have the power of clairvoyance, though she\nhas no reasons for this belief. She maintains her belief despite being\ninundated by her embarrassed friends and relatives with massive\nquantities of apparently cogent scientific evidence that no such power\nis possible. One day Maud comes to believe, for no apparent reason,\nthat the President is in New York City, and she maintains this belief,\ndespite the lack of any independent evidence, appealing to her alleged\nclairvoyant power. Now in fact the President is in New York City, and\nMaud does, under the conditions then satisfied, have completely\nreliable clairvoyant power. Moreover, her belief about the President\ndid result from the operation of that power. (Bonjour 1980, 61)\n\n\nThe original aim in presenting this case, and other similar ones, is\nto criticize a reliabilist account of justification and knowledge. For\npresent purposes, interest in this example centers on a diagnosis of\nwhat has gone wrong with Maud's belief. The example indicates that\nMaud is being both irrational and irresponsible in maintaining belief\nin her clairvoyance when she has such powerful evidence to the\ncontrary. What Maud has done is to disregard evidence that she has on\nhand and that she either is or can easily be aware of, and it is this\nfact that leads us to the intuitively supported conviction that Maud's\nbelief about the President's whereabouts is not justified. It fails to\nbe justified precisely because Maud has been intellectually\nirresponsible in her belief formation.\n\nThis important example, and another concerning an individual,\nSamantha, who is also clairvoyant but who disregards a lot of evidence\nthat she has on hand to the effect that the President is not in New\nYork City (BonJour 1980), makes a strong case for the idea that there\nis some deontological component to the concept of epistemic\njustification. This deontological component may not be all there is to\nthe concept of justification, as defenders of the deontological\nconcept sometimes allege; but, these and related examples do strongly\nsupport the view that there is some deontological ingredient\nin our concept of justification.\n\nWe have seen that externalism is generally the denial of some\ninternalist position, typically regarding accessibility or mentalism\nas accounts of justifiers. It is not surprising, then, that major\narguments for externalism are, first, the failure or weakness in\narguments for either accessibility internalism or for mentalism.\nExternalism fares best on this count in regard to accessibility\ninternalism, since the arguments for that doctrine that we have\nconsidered are hardly compelling. Arguments for mentalism are in\nsomewhat better shape, for in many contexts it does appear that a\ndifference in mental states best explains a difference in the degree\nof justification for a belief. The support provided to mentalism by\nthis explanatory argument is limited, mainly because explaining a\ndifference in degree of justification falls short of\nestablishing that it is plausible to hold that all justifiers are\nmental items. But it cannot be denied that the explanatory argument\nconsidered earlier goes some way in this direction.\n\nExternalism is also supported to varying degrees by any cogent\ncriticisms that have been devised against internalism. On this score,\ntoo, it is accessibility internalism that is especially vulnerable,\nparticularly in the face of the perceptual examples already considered\nin which many justified beliefs are received either simultaneously or\nin rapid order.Further, there is the dilemma argument which poses a\nparticularly forceful challenge to access internalism. Mentalism is\nonly marginally better off in this regard, because as we noted\nearlier, the evidential support relations that obtain between\njustifiers and resulting beliefs seem themselves to be justifiers\nthough they are not mental states. Even if we allow that in simple\ncases one's justification for a belief that follows immediately from\none's understanding of simple premises from which the believed\nproposition follows, this sort of strategy will only work in a small\nclass of cases. Wherever the evidential support relations are more\ncomplex, mere understanding of the propositional content of the\njustifiers will not suffice to issue in justification for a resulting\nbelief. In other words, the above-discussed criticism of the mentalist\nposition concerning probabilistic relations, while perhaps not wholly\neffective, nonetheless has force against all but the simplest of\ncases, and to that extent the case for externalism is strengthened by\nthe weakening of the support for mentalism.\n\nExternalism is also supported by any general defense of theories which\nincorporate or imply it, such as the reliable process theory. This\nsort of defense of externalism, of course, is quite independent of\ncriticisms of accessibility internalism and of mentalism, and also\nindependent of critical attacks on arguments that support those\ninternalist positions.\n\nThere is, further, an important general argument for externalism\n(Goldman 2009). There is general agreement that certain epistemic\nprinciples concerning perception are correct. One such principle might\nbe,\n\nIf it seems to a subject S that she sees object O, then\nS is prima facie justified in believing that she sees O.\n\n\nWe then ask: Why do so many examples of noninferential J-principles\n(justification principles) center on perceptual experience...? Because\nthese are cases in which beliefs formed in accordance with these\nexperiences are usually true (Goldman 2009, 335). This\nperception-based principle is just one among many, such as those we\nmight adduce concerning memory, for example. In all of these cases,\nGoldman says, \u201cI claim that the underlying appeal of these\nJ-principles is a tacit recognition that they are truth conducive\n\u2026\u201d (ibid.). If this is correct, we are tacitly\nrecognizing a close connection between justification and truth\nconduciveness, which is a central tenet of the reliable process theory\nof justified belief. That theory thus provides a good explanation of\nwhy we regard such J-principles as correct, and this fact amounts to a\npositive argument in favor of the reliable process theory. That, in\nturn, is a positive argument in favor of externalism regarding\njustification. This line of argument, especially when extended to\ncases of inferentially justified beliefs, is of special significance,\nthen, because it is independent of arguments that criticize either\naccess internalism or mentalism. Externalism regarding justification,\nthus, need not be thought of as a perspective one \u201cbacks\ninto\u201d once one recognizes the shortcomings of internalist\npositions, but can be seen to stand on its own.\n",
