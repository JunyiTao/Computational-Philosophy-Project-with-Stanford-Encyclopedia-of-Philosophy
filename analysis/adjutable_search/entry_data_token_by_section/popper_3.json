    "main_text": "Basic Statements, Falsifiability and Convention\n4. Basic Statements, Falsifiability and Convention\n\nPopper draws a clear distinction between the logic of\nfalsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his\ntheory is utterly simple: a universal statement is falsified by a\nsingle genuine counter-instance. Methodologically, however, the\nsituation is complex: decisions about whether to accept an apparently\nfalsifying observation as an actual falsification can be problematic,\nas observational bias and measurement error, for example, can yield\nresults which are only apparently incompatible with the theory under\nscrutiny.\n\nThus, while advocating falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation\nfor science, Popper explicitly allows for the fact that in practice a\nsingle conflicting or counter-instance is never sufficient\nmethodologically for falsification, and that scientific theories are\noften retained even though much of the available evidence conflicts\nwith them, or is anomalous with respect to them.\n\nIn this connection, in the Logic of Scientific Discovery\nPopper introduces the technical concept of a \u201cbasic\nstatement\u201d or \u201cbasic proposition\u201d, which he defines\nas a statement which can serve as a premise in an empirical\nfalsification and which takes the singular existential form\n\u201cThere is an X at Y\u201d. Basic statements\nare important because they can formally contradict universal\nstatements, and accordingly play the role of potential falsifiers. To\ntake an example, the (putative) basic statement \u201cIn space-time\nregion k there is an apparatus which is a perpetual motion\nmachine\u201d contradicts the law of the conservation of energy, and\nwould, if true, falsify it (2002: 48). Accordingly, Popper holds that\nbasic statements are objective and are governed by two requirements:\n(a) the formal, that they must be both singular and\nexistential and (b) the material, that they must be\nintersubjectively testable.\n\nIn essence, basic statements are for Popper logical constructs which\nembrace and include \u2018observation statements\u2019, but for\nmethodological reasons he seeks to avoid that terminology, as it\nsuggests that they are derived directly from, and known by, experience\n(2002: 12, footnote 2), which would conflate them with the\n\u201cprotocol\u201d statements of logical positivism and\nreintroduce the empiricist idea that certain kinds of experiential\nreports are incorrigible. The \u201cobjectivity\u201d requirement in\nPopper\u2019s account of basic statements, by contrast, amounts to a\nrejection of the view that the truth of scientific statements can ever\nbe reduced to individual or collective human experience. (2002:\n25).\n\nPopper therefore argues that there are no statements in science which\ncannot be interrogated: basic statements, which are used to test the\nuniversal theories of science, must themselves be inter-subjectively\ntestable and are therefore open to the possibility of refutation. He\nacknowledges that this seems to present a practical difficulty, in\nthat it appears to suggest that testability must occur ad\ninfinitum, which he acknowledges is an operational absurdity:\nsooner or later all testing must come to an end. Where testing ends,\nhe argues, is in a convention-based decision to accept a basic\nstatement or statements; it is at that point that convention and\nintersubjective human agreement play an indispensable role in\nscience:\n\n\nEvery test of a theory, whether resulting in its corroboration or\nfalsification, must stop at some basic statement or other which we\ndecide to accept. If we do not come to any decision, and do\nnot accept some basic statement or other, then the test will have led\nnowhere. (2002: 86)\n\n\nHowever, Popper contends that while such a decision is usually\ncausally related to perceptual experience, it is not and\ncannot be justified by such experience; basic statements are\nexperientially underdetermined.\n\n\nExperiences can motivate a decision, and hence an acceptance\nor a rejection of a statement, but a basic statement cannot be\njustified by them\u2014no more than by thumping the table.\n(2002: 87\u201388)\n\n\nStatements can be justified only by other statements, and therefore\ntesting comes to an end, not in the establishment of a correlation\nbetween propositional content and observable reality, as empiricism\nwould hold, but by means of the conventional, inter-subjective\nacceptance of the truth of certain basic statements by the research\ncommunity.\n\nThe acceptance of basic statements is compared by Popper to trial by\njury: the verdict of the jury will be an agreement in accordance with\nthe prevailing legal code and on the basis of the evidence presented,\nand is analogous to the acceptance of a basic statement by the\nresearch community:\n\n\nBy its decision, the jury accepts, by agreement, a statement about a\nfactual occurrence\u2014a basic statement, as it were. (2002: 92)\n\n\nThe jury\u2019s verdict is conventional in arising out of a procedure\ngoverned by clear rules, and is an application of the legal system as\na whole as it applies to the case in question. The verdict is\naccordingly represented as a true statement of fact, but, as\nmiscarriages of justice demonstrate all too clearly,\n\n\nthe statement need not be true merely because the jury has accepted\nit. This \u2026 is acknowledged in the rule allowing a verdict to be\nquashed or revised. (2002: 92)\n\n\nThis is comparable, he argues, to the case of basic statements: their\nacceptance-as-true is also by agreement and, as such, it also\nconstitutes an application of a theoretical system, and\n\n\nit is only this application which makes any further applications of\nthe theoretical system possible. (2002: 93)\n\n\nHowever, the agreed acceptance of basic statements, like that of\njudicial verdicts, remain perennially susceptible to the requirement\nfor further interrogation. Popper terms this \u201cthe relativity of\nbasic statements\u201d (2002: 86), which is reflective of the\nprovisional nature of the entire corpus of scientific knowledge\nitself. Science does not, he maintains, rest upon any foundational\nbedrock. Rather, the theoretical systems of science are akin to\nbuildings in swampy ground constructed with the support of piles:\n\n\nThe piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to\nany natural or \u201cgiven\u201d base; and if we stop driving the\npiles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply\nstop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the\nstructure, at least for the time being. (2002: 94)\n\n",
