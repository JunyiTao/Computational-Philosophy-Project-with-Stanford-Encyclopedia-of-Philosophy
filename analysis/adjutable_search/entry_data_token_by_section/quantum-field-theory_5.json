    "main_text": "Beyond the Standard Model\n3. Beyond the Standard Model\n\nThe \u201cstandard model of elementary particle physics\u201d is\nsometimes used almost synonymously with QFT. However, there is a\ncrucial difference. While the standard model is a theory with a fixed\nontology (understood in a prephilosophical sense), i.e., three\nfundamental forces and a certain number of elementary particles, QFT\nis rather a frame, the applicability of which is open. Thus while\nquantum chromodynamics (or \u2018QED\u2019) is a part of the standard\nmodel, it is an instance  of a quantum field theory, or short\n\u201ca quantum field theory\u201d and not a part of QFT. This\nsection deals with only some particularly important proposals that go\nbeyond the standard model, but which do not necessarily break up the\nbasic framework of QFT.\n\n",
