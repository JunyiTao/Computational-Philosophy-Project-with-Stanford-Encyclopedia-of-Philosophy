    "main_text": "Constructivism\u2019s Place in Metaethics || Constructivism and the Realism-Antirealism Debate\n6.3 Constructivism and the Realism-Antirealism Debate\n\nBoth Rawls (1980) and O\u2019Neill (1989a) present Kantian\nconstructivism as a third option between realism and relativism (see\nalso Korsgaard 1996a: 36). However, not all constructivists share this\nview. In fact, some place constructivism in the realist camp (Copp,\nLeBar), and others in the antirealist camp (Lenman). Scanlon sides\nwith realism about reasons but defends a constructivist account of the\nnature and truth of moral judgments (Scanlon 1998, 2014, 2003b: 18).\nStreet admits to some kind of relativism. This shows that it would be\na mistake to judge constructivism\u2019s impact in metaethics solely\nin terms of its contribution to the realism-antirealism debate\n(Korsgaard 2008: 312, 325 n. 49; Copp 2013; Engstrom 2013: 138ff).\n\nEfforts to situate constructivism in relation to realism and\nantirealism are complicated by the fact that there are different\ndefinitions of \u2018realism\u2019 (e.g., Sayre-McCord 2015; Joyce\n2015; Miller 2014). Realists agree that (a) moral discourse is\ncognitivist like non-moral discourse, (b) there are moral properties,\nsuch as rightness, (c) moral properties are sometimes instantiated,\nand (d) moral predicates express properties. But there is a\ndisagreement as to whether in order to be a form of realism, a theory\nmust hold a stronger claim that (e) moral properties are\nmind-independent. A further division, internal to realism, concerns\nthe commitment to naturalism, which includes the claims that (f) moral\nproperties are like any ordinary property and have the same\nmetaphysical status as non-moral properties, whatever that is, and\nthat (g) moral assertions express ordinary beliefs regarding the\ninstantiation of these properties. All constructivists share a\ncommitment to naturalism, but reject (e), holding that the\ninstantiation of properties depend on features of our sensibility or\nrational agency, rather than being mind-independent. In general,\nconstructivism shares with both realist naturalism and antirealism\nbroadly defined the commitment to metaphysical parsimony. This is\nwhere it differs from classical and \u201crobust\u201d moral realism\n(Enoch 2011a).\n\nKorsgaard points to an assumption she believes that realists and\nantirealists share and that constructivists reject, namely, that the\nprimary function of concepts deployed in judgments that can be true or\nfalse is to represent things as they are, so if normative judgments\nare true, they must represent something real out there in the world.\nBy contrast, constructivists think that normative concepts, which are\ndeployed in judgments that can be true or false, have a practical\nfunction: they name solutions to practical problems, rather than\nrepresent features of reality (Korsgaard 2008: 302 ff.). For instance,\nthe concept equity does not stand for a property; instead, it proposes\na response to the practical problem of how to distribute goods.\nKorsgaard draws the contrast between constructivism and other\nmetaethical theories as follows. Unlike substantive realism, which\nholds that moral judgments are true insofar as they represent a\nmind-independent normative reality, and antirealism, which denies that\nthere are normative truths because it denies that there are normative\nproperties, constructivists hold that practical judgments can be true\nor false without representing mind-independent normative facts about\nthe world (Korsgaard 2003: 325 n 49).\n\nThis way of characterizing constructivism fails to neatly mark the\ncontrast between constructivism and other metaethical views. First,\nKorsgaard\u2019s characterization takes realism to be committed to\nclaim (e) about mind-independence. But not all define realism in this\nrestrictive way (Sayre-McCord 1988; Copp 2007: 7). When realism is\ndefined more capaciously, it includes views according to which moral\njudgments are made true by facts that depend on some mental states.\nSecond, Korsgaard\u2019s way of drawing the contrast seems to\noverlook the fact that some contemporary versions of antirealism do\nnot deny that moral judgments are truth-apt. Instead, they adopt a\ndeflationary conception of truth as a semantic notion (Ridge 2012;\nLenman & Shemmer 2012b). Constructivism stakes out a middle ground\nbetween forms of realism that are committed to mind-independent\nnormative truths and forms of antirealism that deny that there are any\nnormative truths. To this extent, it agrees with other kinds of\nmetaethics, which are qualified forms of realism or\n\u2018sophisticated forms of subjectivism\u2019 (Wiggins 1993;\nMcDowell 1985). However, sophisticated subjectivism importantly relies\non sensibility, while Kantian constructivism requires that normative\ntruths be dependent on features of rational agency. In this sense,\nthere is an interesting contrast to be drawn between Kantian\nconstructivism and reductivist versions of sophisticated subjectivism\nor response-dependent realism.\n\nSome say that constructivism is best understood as a form\n\u2018expressivism,\u2019 which holds that normative terms function\nto guide action rather than represent matters of fact and are used to\nexpress states of mind that differ from belief (Chrisman 2010; Lenman\n2012; Lenman & Shemmer 2012b; Meyers 2012). Furthermore, Lenman\nargues that embracing expressivism would promise to solve a basic\nproblem for constructivism, specifically, the problem of identifying\nthe kinds of mental state that normative judgments are (Lenman 2012).\nThis suggestion is not shared. Humean constructivist Street has\nforcefully argued that expressivism fails to fully explain the\nnormative function of normative discourse, which cannot be reduced to\nexpressing normative states (Korsgaard 2003, 2008: 312, 325 n. 49,\n2009: 309; Bagnoli 2002: 130\u2013132; Magri 2002; Street 2010:\n239\u2013242).\n",
