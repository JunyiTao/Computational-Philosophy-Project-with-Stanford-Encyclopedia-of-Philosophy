    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough empiricism is often thought to be a modern doctrine, it has\nancient roots, and its modern forms derive from late medieval\ndevelopments. This article will begin by outlining three different\nforms of empiricism. It will examine the Presocratic and Hippocratic\norigins of the empiricist attitude, and discuss its development in the\nwork of Aristotle, the Hellenistic medical writers, Epicureans,\nStoics, and Sceptics. It will then examine the combination of\nAristotelian and Augustinian views in the work of thirteenth and\nfourteenth-century philosophers and theologians, the association\nbetween the study of magic and empiricism, the eclipse of the doctrine\nof divine illumination, and the gradual downplaying of the role of the\nintellect in the acquisition of knowledge.\n\nWhy study these ancient and medieval thinkers? To those who believe\nthat \u201cno conception can be properly understood except through\nits history\u201d (Comte 1934: 2), the answer will seem obvious. But\neven those who prefer to engage more directly in philosophical\nanalysis may find these thinkers illuminating. Empiricists have always\nhad difficulty offering an account of key aspects of both everyday and\nscientific knowledge. They have found it hard to explain how we could\nknow about logical and mathematical truths, causal relations, and\n(more generally) the modal structure of the world (how things could\nbe). Since we are still faced with these questions, we may be able to\nlearn from the answers our predecessors gave.\n",
