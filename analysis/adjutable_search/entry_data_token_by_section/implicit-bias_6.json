    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Traits\n2.4 Traits\n\n\nAs is the case with terms like \u201cattitude\u201d and\n\u201cpropositional,\u201d psychologists and philosophers tend to use\nthe term \u201ctrait\u201d in different ways. In psychology,\ntrait-like constructs are stable over time and across situations. If\nyou have always disliked eating pork, and never eat it no matter the\ncontext, then your feelings toward pork are trait-like. If you\nsometimes decline to eat pork but sometimes indulge, depending on the\ncompany or your mood, then your feelings are more\n\u201cstate\u201d-like. In the psychologist\u2019s sense,\nsignificant evidence suggests that implicit bias is more state-like\nthan trait-like. Multiple longitudinal studies have found that\nindividuals\u2019 scores on implicit measures vary significantly over\ndays, weeks, and months, much more so than individuals\u2019 scores on\ncorresponding explicit measures (Cooley & Payne 2017; Cunningham et\nal. 2001; Devine et al. 2012; Gawronski et al. 2017). Of course, the\nsignificance of this depends on one\u2019s theory of implicit bias. If\nimplicit measures are theorized to capture spontaneous affective\nreactions (as APE suggests; \u00a72.2), then contextual and temporal\nvariability in performance should be predicted (because, for\nexample, one\u2019s immediate reactions to images of women leaders\nwill likely be different after watching a documentary about Ruth Bader\nGinsburg than after watching Clueless). However, if implicit\nmeasures are meant to \u201cdiagnose\u201d stable features of\nindividuals like political party affiliation, then far less variation\nshould be expected. Another possibility is that measurement error\ncontributes significantly to the instability of scores on implicit\nmeasures. The fact that methodological improvements have in some cases\nimproved the temporal stability of participants\u2019 performance\nsupports this idea (e.g., Cooley and Payne 2017).\n\n\nIn philosophy, \u201ctrait\u201d is used more often in the context\nof anti-representationalist, dispositional theories of mind. While\nrepresentationalists define concepts like \u201cbelief\u201d in terms\nof internal, representational structures of the mind, dispositionalists\ndefine concepts like \u201cbelief\u201d in terms of tendencies to\nbehave in certain ways (and perhaps also to feel and think in certain\nways). Building upon Ryle (1949/2009), Schwitzgebel (2006/2010, 2010,\n2013) advances a dispositional theory of attitudes (in the\nphilosophical sense, that is, a theory that claims that beliefs,\ndesires, hopes, etc. are dispositions). On his view, attitudes have a\nbroad (or \u201cmultitrack\u201d) profile, including dispositions to\nfeel, think, and speak in specific ways. The dispositional profile of a\ngiven attitude is determined by the folk-psychological stereotype for\nhaving that attitude, not by what\u2019s inside the agent\u2019s\nmetaphoric \u201cbelief box.\u201d For example, to establish that\nJordan believes that women make good philosophers, one would look to\nwhat Jordan says about women philosophers, to her judgments about which\nphilosophers are good and which aren\u2019t, to her hiring practices,\nher gut feelings around men and women philosophers, etc. Agents with\nimplicit biases pose an interesting challenge to dispositionalists,\nsince these agents often match only part of the relevant\nfolk-psychological stereotypes. For example, Jordan might say that she\nbelieves that women make good philosophers but fail to read any women\nphilosophers (or, recall Frank;\n \u00a71).\nOn Schwitzgebel\u2019s\n\u201cgradualist dispositionalism,\u201d Jordan and Frank would be\n\u201cin-between believers,\u201d agents who partly match the\nrelevant folk-psychological stereotypes for the attitudes in\nquestion.\n\n\nA related trait-based approach treats the results of indirect\nmeasures as reflective of elements of attitudes, rather than\nas assessing attitudes or biases themselves (Machery 2016, 2017). On\nMachery\u2019s view, attitudes (in the psychologist\u2019s sense,\nthat is, preferences) are dispositions and are comprised of various\nbases, including feelings, associations, behavioral impulses, and\npropositional states like beliefs. (In contrast to Schwitzgebel,\nMachery holds a representationalist view of belief, but a\ndispositionalist view of attitudes.) To have a racist attitude, on this\npicture, is to be disposed to display the relevant mix of these bases,\nthat is, to display the feelings, associations, etc. that together\ncomprise the attitude. Implicit measures, then, are said to capture one\nof the psychological bases (e.g., her associations between concepts) of\nthe agent\u2019s overall attitude. Explicit questionnaire measures\ncapture another psy\u00adchological basis of the agent\u2019s attitude,\nbehavioral measures yet another basis, and so on. Implicit measures,\nthen, do not assess \u201cimplicit attitudes,\u201d and indeed,\nMachery denies that attitudes divide into implicit and explicit kinds.\nRather, implicit measures quantify elements of attitudes. In part, this\nproposal is meant to explain some of the key psychometric properties of\nimplicit measures, such as their instability over time and the fact\nthat some implicit measures correlate poorly with each other (\u00a75).\nThese findings are consistent with the notion that different implicit\nmeasures quantify different psychological bases of attitudes, Machery\nargues.\n\n\nOne advantage of thinking of implicit biases as traits is that it is\nconsistent with the way in which personality attributions readily admit\nof vague cases. Just as we might say that Frank is partly\nagreeable if he extols the virtues of compassion yet sometimes\ntreats strangers rudely, we might say that Frank is partly\nprejudiced. Dispositional theories capture this intuition. On the\nother hand, trait-based theories of implicit bias face long-standing\nchallenges to dispositionalism in the philosophy of mind. One such\nchallenge is that traits are explanatory as generalizations, not as\ntoken causes of judgment and behavior\n(Carruthers 2013). Another is the specter of circularity arising from the simultaneous use of an agent\u2019s behavior to both define her disposition and to point to what her disposition predicts (Bandura,\n1971; Cervone et al. 2015; Mischel 1968; Payne et al. 2017). In both\ncases, the question for dispositionalism is whether it truly helps to\nexplain the data, or merely repackages outwardly observed\npatterns in new terms.\n",
