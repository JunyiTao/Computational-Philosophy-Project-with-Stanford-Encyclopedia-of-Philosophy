    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty || Use and Uselessness\n2.5 Use and Uselessness\n\nPhilosophers in the Kantian tradition identify the experience of\nbeauty with disinterested pleasure, psychical distance, and the like,\nand contrast the aesthetic with the practical. \u201cTaste\nis the faculty of judging an object or mode of representing it by an\nentirely disinterested satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The\nobject of such satisfaction is called beautiful\u201d (Kant\n1790, 45). Edward Bullough distinguishes the beautiful from the merely\nagreeable on the grounds that the former requires a distance from\npractical concerns: \u201cDistance is produced in the first instance\nby putting the phenomenon, so to speak, out of gear with our\npractical, actual self; by allowing it to stand outside the context of\nour personal needs and ends\u201d (Bullough 1912, 244).\n\nOn the other hand, many philosophers have gone in the opposite\ndirection and have identified beauty with suitedness to use.\n\u2018Beauty\u2019 is perhaps one of the few terms that could\nplausibly sustain such entirely opposed interpretations.\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, the ancient hedonist Aristippus of\nCyrene took a rather direct approach.\n\n\nIs not then, also, a beautiful woman useful in proportion as she is\nbeautiful; and a boy and a youth useful in proportion to their beauty?\nWell then, a handsome boy and a handsome youth must be useful exactly\nin proportion as they are handsome. Now the use of beauty is, to be\nembraced. If then a man embraces a woman just as it is useful that he\nshould, he does not do wrong; nor, again, will he be doing wrong in\nemploying beauty for the purposes for which it is useful. (Diogenes\nLaertius, 94)\n\n\nIn some ways, Aristippus is portrayed parodically: as the very worst\nof the sophists, though supposedly a follower of Socrates. And yet the\nidea of beauty as suitedness to use finds expression in a number of\nthinkers. Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia puts the view in the\nmouth of Socrates, with Aristippus as interlocutor:\n\n\nSocrates: In short everything which we use is considered both\ngood and beautiful from the same point of view, namely its use.\n\nAristippus: Why then, is a dung-basket a beautiful thing?\n\nSocrates: Of course it is, and a golden shield is ugly, if\nthe one be beautifully fitted to its purpose and the other ill.\n(Xenophon, Book III, viii)\n\n\nBerkeley expresses a similar view in his dialogue Alciphron,\nthough he begins with the hedonist conception: \u201cEvery one knows\nthat beauty is what pleases\u201d (Berkeley 1732, 174; see Carritt\n1931, 75). But it pleases for reasons of usefulness. Thus, as Xenophon\nsuggests, on this view, things are beautiful only in relation to the\nuses for which they are intended or to which they are properly\napplied. The proper proportions of an object depend on what kind of\nobject it is and, again, a beautiful car might make an ugly tractor.\n\u201cThe parts, therefore, in true proportions, must be so related,\nand adjusted to one another, as they may best conspire to the use and\noperation of the whole\u201d (Berkeley 1732, 174\u201375; see\nCarritt 1931, 76). One result of this is that, though beauty remains\ntied to pleasure, it is not an immediate sensible experience. It\nessentially requires intellection and practical activity: one has to\nknow the use of a thing and assess its suitedness to that use.\n\nThis treatment of beauty is often used, for example, to criticize the\ndistinction between fine art and craft, and it avoids sheer\nphilistinism by enriching the concept of \u2018use,\u2019 so that it\nmight encompass not only performing a practical task, but performing\nit especially well or with an especial satisfaction. Ananda\nCoomaraswamy, the Ceylonese-British scholar of Indian and European\nmedieval arts, adds that a beautiful work of art or craft expresses as\nwell as serves its purpose.\n\n\nA cathedral is not as such more beautiful than an airplane, \u2026 a\nhymn than a mathematical equation. \u2026 A well-made sword is not\nless beautiful than a well-made scalpel, though one is used to slay,\nthe other to heal. Works of art are only good or bad, beautiful or\nugly in themselves, to the extent that they are or are not well and\ntruly made, that is, do or do not express, or do or do not serve their\npurpose. (Coomaraswamy 1977, 75)\n\n\nRoger Scruton, in his book Beauty (2009) returns to a\nmodified Kantianism with regard to both beauty and sublimity, enriched\nby many and varied examples. \u201cWe call something\nbeautiful,\u201d writes Scruton, \u201cwhen we gain pleasure from\ncontemplating it as an individual object, for its own sake, and in its\npresented form\u201d (Scruton 2009, 26). Despite the\nKantian framework, Scruton, like Sartwell and Nehamas, throws the\nsubjective/objective distinction into question. He compares\nexperiencing a beautiful thing to a kiss. To kiss someone that one\nloves is not merely to place one body part on another, \u201cbut to\ntouch the other person in his very self. Hence the kiss is\ncompromising \u2013 it is a move from one self toward another, and a\nsummoning of the other into the surface of his being\u201d\n(Scruton 2009, 48). This, Scruton says, is a profound pleasure.\n",
