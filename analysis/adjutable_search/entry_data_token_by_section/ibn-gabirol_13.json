Taken in\ncontrast to the Aristotelian doctrine that each existent has a single\nsubstantial form (ensuring its unity as a substance), \u201cthe\nplurality of forms\u201d doctrine describes the Universal Hylomorphic\nsense in which each existent has a number of essential forms (and\nmatters). In our highly Neoplatonic Gabirolean context (but less so in\nRoger Bacon and other Christian Universal Hylomorphists), we can simply\ntake this doctrine as an extension of the standard Plotinian idea that,\nas part of the great chain of being, any given existent is saturated\nthrough with the reality of the hypostases Soul and Intellect: in this\nsense, each existent has a number of essences, corresponding to the\nvarious \u201clayers\u201d (for Ibn Gabirol,\n\u201cform+matter\u201d spiritual simples) in the great chain of\nbeing.\n",
