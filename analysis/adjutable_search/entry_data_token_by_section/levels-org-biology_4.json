    "main_text": "Philosophical accounts of levels of organization || Levels skepticism and deflationary accounts\n2.4 Levels skepticism and deflationary accounts\n\nDespite the familiarity of scientists and philosophers with the levels\nconcept, calls for its dismissal or de-emphasis in the scientific\nlexicon are increasingly common (Eronen 2013; Guttman 1976; Ladyman\n& Ross 2007; Potochnik 2017; 2021; Potochnik & McGill 2012;\nRueger & McGivern 2010; Thalos 2013). For one thing, nature may\nsimply be too messy to fit any layer-cake style picture. Consider as\nan illustration the putative level of \u201corganisms\u201d. Blue\nwhales and yeast cells are both clearly organisms and thus should\nnominally be located at this level, but each comprises radically\ndifferent kinds of entities with radically different properties\n(Potochnik & McGill 2012). Moreover, but when we consider the next\nlower level, namely the one indicated by the components of these\norganisms, the picture of levels as neat horizontal layers breaks down\ncompletely. The components of blue whales include things such as\norgans, tissues and cells, whereas yeast cells are composed of things\nlike the cell membrane, nucleus and mitochondria (cf. Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012). Furthermore, the whale is in part composed of various\nsymbionts, including gut bacteria which are at the same time\ncomponents of the whale and organisms in themselves. Thus, the\ncomponents of different kinds of organisms do not form any homogeneous\n\u201clevel\u201d.\n\nThese problems are not just due to the difficulties of defining what\nan organism is. Similar issues arise when we consider the components\nof cells, such as the cell membrane and mitochondria, and especially\ntheir subcomponents (e.g, lipid molecules and the outer mitochondrial\nmembrane respectively): they exhibit too much heterogeneity to form\nneat levels (Eronen 2021). Moreover, the same kinds of things can be\nparts in very different higher-level wholes: For example, hydrogen\nions are components of the lipid molecules that make up cell\nmembranes, but they can also be free-standing components in the\noxidative phosphorylation mechanism that involves the cell membrane as\nanother component (Bechtel 2008: 147).\n\nMore generally, Potochnik and McGill (2012; see also Potochnik 2021)\nargue that \u2018levels\u2019 imposes a radically false, rigid\nuniformity onto nature, and identify these problems with the basic\nidea of the levels concept itself:\n\n\nIndeed, the very notion of stratified levels depends on not only the\nubiquity, but also the uniformity, of part-whole composition. For\nstrata to emerge, atoms must always compose molecules, populations\nmust always compose communities, and so forth. But the uniformity of\ncomposition needed for stratified levels simply does not\nexist. (2012: 126; emphasis added; see also Guttman 1976: 113;\nThalos 2013: 10)\n\n\nThis comprehensive, uniform rigidity in turn undermines other features\nattributed to levels of organization. One of these features is the\nsupposed epistemic merit (or fault) inherently exhibited by natural\nconstituents due to their position at a particular level (Potochnik\n& McGill 2012: 129\u201330; Potochnik 2021). For instance,\nreductionists frequently argue that molecular-level explanations are\ngenerally more secure, more fundamental, or otherwise superior to\nexplanations citing higher-level structures like chromosomes or cells\n(and conversely, anti-reductionists claim that higher-level\nconstituents are often necessary for producing adequate explanations).\nHowever, as has been pointed out by many authors, blanket attributions\nof significance like these are deeply misleading (see\n section 4).\n One reason for this is that particular levels exhibit epistemic merit\nonly in regard to what is being investigated. As such, what is taken\nto be the relevant level will shift depending on what structures or\nprocesses comprise the focus of scientists\u2019 investigative tasks,\nand hence no level will have inherent or principled epistemic\nsuperiority. Moreover, epistemic products like explanations and\ntheories in biology rarely exhibit a monolevel structure, but rather\ninclude multiple levels simultaneously (e.g., Schaffner 1993:\n97\u20138, 387; Mitchell 2003: 147; Craver 2007).\n\nThe basic conclusion that Potochnik and other levels skeptics draw\nfrom this is the following. The levels concept precludes a\nsophisticated discussion of philosophical and scientific issues by\nimposing an overly simplistic representation of science and nature.\nSo, although perhaps no one would deny the attractiveness of\n\u2018levels\u2019 in seeking to make complex natural systems\ntractable to analysis, depicting these systems using the concept seems\nto do far more harm than good. Burton S. Guttman is very clear on\nthis, arguing that \u201cif it is stated in any but the sloppiest and\nmost general terms, [the concept of levels] is a useless and even\nmisleading concept\u201d (Guttman 1976: 112). Similarly, Miriam\nThalos colorfully names \u201cthe conceit of levels\u201d before\nstating that \u201cthe notion of levels provides no useful\nphilosophical ideas whatsoever\u201d (Thalos 2013: 13).\n\nThis levels-skepticism also possesses a more constructive side.\nSeveral authors have suggested replacing or reinterpreting levels talk\nin terms of other concepts (Eronen 2015; Noble 2012; Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012; see also P.S. Churchland & Sejnowski 1992; McCauley\n2009; Rueger & McGivern 2010). The motivation behind this\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d approach (Eronen 2013) is that the problems\nassociated with levels of organization can be avoided if more\nwell-defined notions are applied instead. For instance, the notion of\nscale arguably does not lead to the same kinds of problems as\nthe notion of levels of organization. All that is needed for arranging\nthings on a scale is measuring some quantitative property of those\nthings. Scales also have the advantage of being entirely continuous,\nwhile levels require placing things at distinct and discrete positions\nin the hierarchy (Potochnik & McGill 2012). The scale that is the\nmost obviously relevant one in this context is the size scale, which\nis based on how big things are: Organisms are usually (though not\nalways) bigger than cells, which are bigger than molecules, which are\nbigger than atoms, and so on.\n\nHowever, the time scale is also crucially important for understanding\nbiological organization (Simon 1962; DiFrisco 2017). Time scale can\nrefer to the rate at which a process occurs, but also to the frequency\nof a process, or to the rate of interactions between processes or\nentities, all of which are relevant scales in the context of biology\n(Baedke 2021). For example, interactions between organisms (e.g.,\nsexual reproduction) take place at much slower rates than interactions\nbetween cells (e.g., synaptic communication), which again are slower\nthan interactions between molecules (e.g., receptor binding). The idea\nof ordering biological processes based on time scale has a long\nhistory, going back at least to organicism (see\n section 1;\n Baedke 2021). Understanding levels in terms of scales is also\nconsistent with the idea that at some scales we may find peaks of\nregularity or predictability (Wimsatt 1994 [2007]), or clusters of\ncausal relationships (Potochnik & McGill 2012). Besides scales,\nalso other notions have been proposed to replace levels, such as\nnetworks (Potochnik 2021; see also Bechtel 2017) or explanatory styles\n(Potochnik & Sanches Oliveira 2020).\n\nAlthough these skeptical and deflationary approaches, where the notion\nof levels is reduced or deflated to more well-defined concepts,\nostensibly increase conceptual clarity, they may not be sufficient for\naccounting for the role of levels of organization in biological theory\nand practice (see also\n section 6).\n For example, the cellular level is a canonical level organization,\nbut cells come in many different sizes, and it is hard to identify a\nsize (or time) scale that would play a similar role as the notion of a\ncellular level. Moreover, skepticism regarding specific philosophical\nconceptions of levels, such as layer-cake-style levels or levels of\nmechanisms, leaves open the possibility that more piecemeal or\ncontext-specific approaches to levels may still be useful.\n",
