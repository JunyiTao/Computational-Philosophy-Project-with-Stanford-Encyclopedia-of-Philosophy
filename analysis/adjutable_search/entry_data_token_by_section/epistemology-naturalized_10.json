    "main_text": "Epistemology as \u201cThoroughly Empirical\u201d || Intuitions and the A Priori\n4.3 Intuitions and the A Priori\n\nAs we saw previously, one prevalent form of the\nself-defeat objection to NE is that it inevitably\nitself relies upon \u201c[t]he a priorism involved in the traditional\nsort of armchair methodological research\u201d (Kaplan 1994: 359) and\nthat it makes use of \u201cthe very sorts of epistemic intuitions which the\nnaturalists are so eager to disparage\u201d (ibid.: 360; cf.\nAlmeder 1990: 266\u2013267). In this way, EN itself requires or\npresumes the legitimacy of appeals to a priori or\n\u201carmchair\u201d intuition, such appeals being a key element of \u201cthe standard\njustificatory procedure\u201d in philosophy (Bealer 1992). So the\nposition of the proponent of NE is self-defeating\u2014\u201cit\nseeks to justify naturalized epistemology in precisely the way in\nwhich, according to it, justification cannot be had\u201d (Siegel\n1984: 675).\n\nAccording to the form of NE currently being considered, a reliance on\nintuitions, particularly in the early stages of inquiry, may be\npractically necessary. However, it may be argued that \u201cthe\nmethod of appeals to intuitions is\u2026easily accommodated within a\nnaturalistic framework\u201d (Kornblith 2002: 12). Thus, were you to\ndescribe to me a certain animal you observed in your back yard, I\nmight naturally and correctly judge it to have been a squirrel.\nClearly, this does not involve or require any a priori\ninsight on my part; it simply reflects some easily gotten knowledge\nabout the relevant local fauna. In the same way, Kornblith\nthinks, our seemingly spontaneous judgments about whether this or that\nactual or hypothetical case constitutes an instance of knowledge is an\na posteriori judgment, backed by our already-acquired\nknowledge of the relevant worldly epistemic phenomenon. So\n\u201cappeals to intuition do not require some non-natural faculty or\na priori judgment of any sort\u2026.The practice of appealing to\nintuition has no non-natural ingredients\u201d (2002:\n 21).[19]\n\nWhat of the charge that, in presenting various philosophical\narguments, the naturalist is tacitly relying upon various principles\nof good reasoning, themselves known only a priori (e.g.,\nBonJour 1994)? One obvious response is that this begs the question. On\na reliabilist view, the legitimacy of the relevant principles of\nreasoning\u2014what makes them good principles\u2014is a function of\nwhether they are, in fact, reliable. They needn\u2019t be known to be\nsuch, much less must they be known to be such a priori\n(Kornblith 2002: 21\u201323; 1995: 252). So the objector \u201cis\nsimply taking for granted certain constraints on good reasoning which\nthe naturalist rejects\u201d (1995: 253). Moreover, there is the\nconcern that such constraints, if consistently applied, would\nrarely if ever be satisfied. Insofar as they have such skeptical\nconsequences, such constraints cannot be reasonable (1995: 253; 2006:\n347\u2013348).\n\nAs with his response to the normativity problem, there are questions\nas to whether Kornblith\u2019s attempt to diffuse the self-defeat\nobjection is successful. For example, both BonJour (2006) and Siegel\n(2006) have replied to Kornblith\u2019s arguments, claiming that the\nthreat of self-defeat is as strong as ever. For instance, Siegel\nclaims that \u201cit is unclear how [Kornblith\u2019s] appeal to\nreliabilism can be justified without either contravening naturalism or\npresupposing it\u201d (2006: 246\u2013248; cf. Kappel 2010: 845).\nOr, to take another example, Kornblith at one point says in passing that \u201cknowledge is, surely, more than just true belief\u201d (2002:\n54), and a proponent of TE might wonder what justifies that\nclaim. Of course, it is not difficult to imagine how Kornblith is apt\nto respond to such worries\u2014that knowledge involves reliably\nproduced true belief is an empirical discovery, arrived at by\nstudying apparently clear cases of the phenomenon. There may be some\ncircularity here, but no more than is involved in Siegel\u2019s or\nBonJour\u2019s pointing to some cases and saying, with the presumed\nbacking of rational insight, that they reveal what knowledge\n(justification, rationality, etc.) really is.\n\nObviously, there is to be no fast and easy resolution of this\ndebate\u2014not least because the nature of status of the a\npriori, as well as what is required for knowledge, for example,\nare themselves hotly contested. (For general discussion of the a\npriori, see Russell 2014; for a representative sampling of\ncurrent work on the topic, see Casullo and Thurow 2013. Ichikawa and\nSteup 2014 provide an overview of issues surrounding knowledge.) For\nour purposes, however, what is especially noteworthy is that some of\nthe very same worries as Siegel and BonJour register about\nKornblith\u2019s attempt to cast epistemology as \u201cempirical all\nthe way down\u201d have been voiced by Alvin Goldman, himself an\nextremely prominent advocate of NE:\n\n\nWhere does the assertion that knowledge is \u201cmore than just true\nbelief\u201d come from? What licenses it? Surely it doesn\u2019t\ncome from cognitive ethology. It would have to come, one supposes,\nfrom a semantico-conceptual account of the term\n\u201cknowledge\u201d. But many would say that this is precisely\nwhat philosophy, in its analytic phase, aims to provide. So that job\nis not taken over by biological science, as Kornblith often suggests\nthat it is.
