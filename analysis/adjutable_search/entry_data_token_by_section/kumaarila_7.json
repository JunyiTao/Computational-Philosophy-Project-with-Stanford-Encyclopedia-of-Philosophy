    "main_text": "Metaphysics and philosophy of language || On the eternality of the Vedas, and of language in general\n3.1 On the eternality of the Vedas, and of language in general\n\n\nOf course, there are, in addition to the foregoing philosophical\nconsiderations in favor of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology,\nspecifically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka concerns driving the project. In\nthis regard, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi has a particularly cogent point in\nfavor of the interpretation on which Kum\u0101rila has, as suggested\nabove, effectively reversed the standard order of epistemological\nexplanation. Thus, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi urges that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas cannot proceed on the assumption\nthat Kum\u0101rila meant to ask about the status only of\npram\u0101\u1e47as (i.e., only of those cognitions that are\nalready known to be veridical); for that would effectively disqualify\nthe Vedas from coming under the purview of this discussion, since\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s opponents will not grant that the\nVedas count as epistemically reliable (as a\npram\u0101\u1e47a) in the first place. Indeed, whether or not\nwe are entitled to think the Vedas epistemically reliable is just\nthe issue in question; it would therefore be to little avail to\nask how it is simply that cognitions already known to be reliable have\nthe status they do, since it must first be established that Vedic\ninjunction is a rational basis for action in the first place. And the\nonly way to further this goal, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi argues, is to\nshow that all contentful cognitions (even those that turn out\nnot to have been veridical) should be recognized as immediately\nconferring justification. Aptly expressing the reversed direction of\nepistemological explanation commended by this interpretation, William\nAlston has asked to similar effect: if a subject\n\u201cwere not often really perceiving X why should the experience\ninvolved provide justification for beliefs about X?\u201d (1991: 10)\nSimilarly, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi can ask: if it were not really the\ncase that one desirous of heaven should perform a Vedic sacrifice, then\nwhy (as this epistemological program is concerned to show) would the\nexperience of a Vedic injunction to that effect provide justification\nfor that belief?\n\n\nOn the view, then, that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine reverses the\nusual order of epistemological explanation, the claim is that insofar\nas any cognition engendered by a Vedic injunction intrinsically confers\njustification simply in virtue of its being a cognition, Vedic\ninjunction first becomes a candidate for the status of \u201creliable\ndoxastic practice\u201d (pram\u0101\u1e47a)\u2014and the\npoint of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology is that this is a status\nthat any reliable doxastic practice should then be thought to enjoy\nuntil or unless it is overridden. Here, though, is where other\ncharacteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments significantly\ncome into play\u2014chiefly, the commitment to the view that the\nVedic texts are, like language itself, eternal or primordial.\nJaimini\u2019s fifth M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btra\nspecifies in this regard that \u201cthe relations between words and\ntheir referents are primordial (autpattika)\u201d\u2014a\nview meant to underwrite the claim that the Vedas themselves are\ntranscendent or \u201cimpersonal\u201d (apauru\u1e63eya).\nIt is, then, particularly together with this view that\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology can be taken to warrant the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka claim that the Vedas are, in fact,\nuniquely authoritative; for insofar as they are thus taken\nessentially to transcend any human perspective, Vedic injunctions,\nuniquely among reliable doxastic practices, therefore cannot\nbe falsified.\n\n\nThat the claims expressed by or implicit in Vedic texts cannot be\nfalsified has to do with the distinctive capacity of language to bear\non imperceptible states of affairs such as are not ready to hand, but\nalways \u201cgoing to be realized\u201d (bh\u0101vya or\nbhavi\u1e63yat). Thus, to the extent that any linguistic\nepisode reflects or expresses something of the epistemic perspective of\na particular language-user, the claim it makes is always such as can be\noverridden based on considerations involving that limited epistemic\nperspective\u2014based, e.g., on the speaker\u2019s mendacity, or\non his reporting a perceptual or inferential claim that turns out\nitself to be mistaken. Language itself, however, is not thus\nlimited by any particular perspective; to the extent, then, that one\njoins M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas (as Heidegger sometimes seems to do!)\nin finding intelligible the idea that language itself might,\nas it were, utter the Vedas, the fact of there being no epistemically\nlimited author whose intentions the Vedas would express means there\ncan, in this case alone, be no basis for overriding the claims that\nissue from these texts. (That M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas argued\nstrenuously against Buddhist and Jaina claims about the possible\ncultivation of omniscience reflects the stake they thus had in denying\nthat there could be any epistemically unlimited perspective;\nlanguage as such, in contrast to such individual knowers as\nthe Buddha and the Jina, is not itself a limiting perspective.)\n\n\nIt is important to note (what is sometimes overlooked) that the\nforegoing claims about the eternality of language and of the Vedas are\nlogically independent of the epistemological position Kum\u0101rila has\nelaborated; the epistemological doctrine of \u201cimmediate\njustification\u201d does not, that is, by itself support the claim\nthat the Vedas are uniquely authoritative. While Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemology may, then, by itself show that Vedic texts are\njustifiably credited as epistemically reliable (that, in other\nwords, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka beliefs are rationally held),\nit is logically independent claims about the eternality of the Vedas\nthat are taken by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas to warrant the stronger\nconclusion that Vedic injunctions are uniquely so. It is\nimportant to appreciate the independence of these positions from one\nanother, and accordingly to note that the assessment of\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology (both traditionally and among modern\nscholars) is sometimes driven more by resistance to the eternality\nclaim than to anything integral to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemology.\n\n\nThus, for example, the tenth-century Ny\u0101ya thinker Jayanta\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2014who was himself much influenced by the\nthought of Kum\u0101rila, and who was inclined to cede to\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas authority in hermeneutical\nmatters\u2014was worried, as a theist, about Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemological case for the authoritative status of the\nVedas. Jayanta thought Kum\u0101rila\u2019s defense of the Vedas\nproblematic, however, chiefly insofar as Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\ndovetails with claims about the eternality of the Vedas, thus making\nfor an essentially atheistic case for the eternality of the\nVedas.  So, while Ny\u0101ya thinkers like Jayanta characteristically\nheld that authorship of the Vedas is to be attributed to\n\u012b\u015bvara, \u201cGod,\u201d Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ndefense of the eternality of language involves critiques of\ntheism that are, indeed, very much like some characteristically\nBuddhist critiques of theism. (On this, see Krasser 1999.) But while\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemological doctrine is clearly meant to\ndovetail with these other commitments to secure a unique epistemic\nstatus for the Vedas, the claimed eternality of language (and the\nconsequent critique of theism) is not itself a point that is advanced\nby Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemological case for the immediately\njustificatory status of contentful cognitions; indeed, that there is\nnothing intrinsically anti-theistic about his epistemology is suggested\nby the fact that William Alston (1991) has elaborated a strikingly\nsimilar epistemology precisely in order to show specifically\ntheistic practices to be justified. To the extent, then, that\nJayanta attacks Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology chiefly by pressing\nthe point that it is problematic to suppose there could be authorless\ntexts (as, for example, in his philosophical play\n\u0100gama\u1e0dambara; see Dezso 2005, 213\u201317), it should\nbe recognized that he misses the mark.\n\n\nDespite the importance of thus distinguishing these two moments in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s case for Vedic authority\u2014the\nepistemological moment, that is, and the case for the\nessentially transcendent character of the Vedas\u2014it should be\nallowed that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments regarding the\neternality of language in general (and of the Vedas in particular) are\nhardly incidental to their overall position. While, however, few modern\nreaders are likely to be favorably inclined towards the view that the\nVedic texts are authorless, these commitments reflect often profound\nintuitions, elaborated by Kum\u0101rila and other\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, about the irreducibly linguistic character\nof thought, and about the reality of the kinds of universals that must\nbe posited to make sense of the objectivity of language. Arguing, in\nthis regard, for the eternality of language, Kum\u0101rila challenged\n(chiefly Buddhist and Ny\u0101ya) proponents of contract- or\nconvention-theories of linguistic origins to explain how any\nparticular linguistic act could coherently be imagined as\nthe first such act. The problem he raises is that any\nparticular linguistic act is intelligible as a linguistic\nact\u2014intelligible, that is, as instituting linguistic\npolicies\u2014only given the prior understanding that the\nmeaning-creating utterance itself means something. One person\ncould, that is, propose to another that (for example) this thing here\nbe called a \u2018cow\u2019 only by telling her\nso\u2014but the possibility of his doing so is just what we are in\nthis case trying to explain.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila can be said in this regard to share Wittgenstein\u2019s\nfamously expressed intuition about the problem with Augustine\u2019s\naccount of language-acquisition. With regard to Augustine\u2019s contention that language-learning is explicable in terms of foundational moments of deictic usage, Wittgenstein says that \u201cAugustine describes the\nlearning of human language as if the child came into a strange country\nand did not understand the language of the country; that is, as if it\nalready had a language, only not this one. Or again: as if the child\ncould already think, only not yet speak. And\n\u2018think\u2019 would here mean something like \u2018talk to\nitself\u2019.\u201d (Wittgenstein 1958, \u00a732) Kum\u0101rila can\nbe taken similarly to have urged, in pressing his case for the\neternality of language, that we can only imagine thinking to\nconsist in \u201ctalking to oneself\u201d\u2014and that to\nunderstand that is to understand something more than just\nwhat things are called. What Kum\u0101rila challenges his\nNy\u0101ya and Buddhist opponents to explain, then, is where we get the\nvery idea of meaning\u00a0 something, and in what that\nconsists.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila thus argues that the irreducible givenness of\nlanguage\u2014its always already being there\u2014is a condition\nof the possibility of there being any particular speech acts, and of\nany thought such as might explain these. Particularly as\nagainst the essentially psychologistic account of language to be\ngleaned from the Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s view\ncan be understood to credit something of the irreducibly social\ncharacter of language, which is to be understood on this view as having\nan essentially mind-independent reality; the possibility of\nmeaning anything cannot be explained with reference to the\ngoings-on in any particular minds. It might reasonably be\nsaid, then, that while Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s apoha doctrine\namounts to a paradigm case of what V. N. Volosinov characterized as\n\u201cindividualistic subjectivism,\u201d Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\naccount paradigmatically exemplifies the alternative pole that\nVolosinov characterized as \u201cabstract objectivism.\u201d (On\nthese arguments, see Arnold 2006, and 2012, Chapter 4; Taber\n[forthcoming]. See, as well, Volosinov 1986, 45\u201363.)\n",
