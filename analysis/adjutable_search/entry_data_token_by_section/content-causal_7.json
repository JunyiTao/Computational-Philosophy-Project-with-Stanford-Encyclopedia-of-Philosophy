    "main_text": "Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content || Best Test Theory\n3.5 Best Test Theory\n\nA relatively more recent causal theory is Robert Rupert\u2019s (1999)\nBest Test Theory (BTT) for the meanings of natural kind terms. Unlike\nmost causal theories, this one is restricted in scope to just natural\nkinds and terms for natural kinds. To mark this restriction, we will\nlet represented kinds be denoted by K\u2019s, rather than our usual\nX\u2019s.\n\nBest Test Theory: If a subject S bears no\nextension-fixing intentions toward \u201cX\u201d and \u201cX\u201d\nis an atomic natural kind term in S\u2019s language of thought (i.e.,\nnot a compound of two or more other natural kind terms), then\n\u201cX\u201d has as its extension the members of natural kind K if\nand only if members of K are more efficient in their causing of\n\u201cX\u201d in S than are the members of any other natural\nkind.\n\nTo put the idea succinctly, \u201cX\u201d means, or refers to, those\nthings that are the most powerful stimulants of \u201cX\u201d. That\nsaid, we need an account of what it is for a member of a natural kind\nto be more efficient in causing \u201cX\u201ds than are other\nnatural kinds. We need an account of how to measure the power of a\nstimulus. This might be explained in terms of a kind of biography.\n\n\n\n\n \n\u201cX1\u201d\n\u201cX2\u201d\n\u201cX3\u201d\n\u201cX4\u201d\n\u201cX5\u201d \n\nK1\n\n1\n1\n1\n \n\nK1\n1\n1\n1\n\n \n\nK1\n1\n1\n\n\n \n\nK1\n\n1\n1\n1\n \n\nK1\n1\n1\n1\n\n \n\nK1\n1\n1\n\n\n \n\nK2\n1\n\n\n\n \n\nK2\n1\n\n\n\n \n\nK2\n1\n1\n\n\n \n\nK3\n\n1\n\n\n \n\nK3\n\n1\n\n\n \n\nK3\n\n1\n\n\n \n\nK3\n1\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 1. A spreadsheet biography\n\n\nConsider an organism S that (a) causally interacts with three\ndifferent natural kinds, K1-K3, in its\nenvironment and (b) has a language of thought with five terms\n\u201cX1\u201d-\u201cX5\u201d. Further,\nsuppose that each time S interacts with an individual of kind\nKi this causes an occurrence of one or more of\n\u201cX1\u201d-\u201cX5\u201d. We can then\ncreate a kind of \u201cspreadsheet biography\u201d or \u201clog of\nmental activity\u201d for S in which there is a column for each of\n\u201cX1\u201d-\u201cX5\u201d and a row for\neach instance in which a member of K1-K3 causes\none or more instances of\n\u201cX1\u201d-\u201cX5\u201d. Each mental\nrepresentation \u201cXi\u201d that Ki triggers\nreceives a \u201c1\u201d in its column. Thus, a single spreadsheet\nbiography might look like that shown in Figure 1.\n\nTo determine what a given term \u201cXi\u201d means, we\nfind the kind Ki that is most effective at causing\n\u201cXi\u201d. This can be computed from S\u2019s\nbiography. For each Ki and \u201cXi\u201d, we\ncompute the frequency with which Ki triggers\n\u201cXi\u201d. \u201cX1\u201d is tokened\nfour out of six times that K1 is encountered, three out of\nthree times that K2 is encountered, and one out of four\ntimes that K3 is encountered. \u201cXi\u201d\nmeans that Ki that has the highest sample frequency. Thus,\nin this case, \u201cX1\u201d means K2. Just to\nbe clear, when BTT claims that \u201cXi\u201d means the\nKi that is the most powerful stimulant of \u201cX\u201d,\nthis is not to say that \u201cX\u201d means the most common\nstimulant of \u201cX\u201d. In our spreadsheet biography,\nK1 is the most common stimulant of\n\u201cX1\u201d, since it triggers\n\u201cX1\u201d four times, where K2 triggers\nit only three times, and K3 triggers it only one time. This\nis why, according to BTT, \u201cX1\u201d means\nK2, rather than K1 or K3.\n\nHow does the BTT handle our range of test cases? Consider, first, the\nstandard form of the disjunction problem, the case of \u201cX\u201d\nmeaning dog, rather than dog or fox-on-a-dark-night-at-a-distance.\nSince the latter is not apparently a natural kind, \u201cX\u201d\ncannot mean\n that.[10]\n Moreover, \u201cX\u201d means dog, rather than fox, because the\nonly times the many foxes that S encounters can trigger\n\u201cX1\u201ds is on dark nights at a distance, where\ndogs trigger \u201cX\u201ds more consistently under a wider range of\nconditions.\n\nHow does the BTT address the apparent problem of \u201cbrain\ninterventions,\u201d such as LSD, microelectrodes, or brain tumors?\nThe answer is multi-faceted. The quickest method for taking much of\nthe sting out of these cases is to note that they generally do not\narise for most individuals. The Best Test Theory relies on personal\nbiographies in which only actual instances of kinds triggering mental\nrepresentations are used to specify causal efficiency. The\ncounterfactual truth that, were a stimulating microelectrode to be\napplied to, say, a particular neuron, it would perfectly reliably\nproduce an \u201cX\u201d token simply does not matter for the\ntheory. So, for all those individuals who do not take LSD, do not have\nmicroelectrodes inserted in their brains, do not have brain tumors,\netc., these sorts of counterfactual possibilities are irrelevant. A\nsecond line of defense against \u201cbrain interventions\u201d\nappeals to the limitation to natural kinds. The BTT might set aside\nmicroelectrodes, since they do not constitute a natural kind. Maybe\nbrain tumors are; maybe not. Unfortunately, however, LSD is a very\nstrong candidate for a chemical natural kind. Still the BTT is not\nwithout a third line of defense for handling these cases. One might\nsuppose that LSD and brain tumors act on the brain in a rather diffuse\nmanner. Sometimes a dose of LSD triggers \u201cXi\u201d,\nanother time it triggers \u201cXj\u201d, and another time\nit triggers \u201cXk\u201d. One might then propose that,\nif one counts all these episodes with LSD, none of these will act\noften enough on, say, \u201cXi\u201d to get it to mean\nLSD, rather than, say, dog. This is the sort of strategy that Rupert\ninvokes to keep mental symbols from meaning omnipresent, but\nnon-specific causes such as the heart. The heart might causally\ncontribute to \u201cX1\u201d, but it also contributes to\nso many other \u201cXi\u201ds, that the heart will turn\nout not to be the most efficient cause of\n\u201cX1\u201d.\n\nWhat about questions? Presumably questions as a category will count as\nan instance of a linguistic natural kind. Moreover, particular\nsentences will also count. So, the restriction of the BTT to natural\nkinds is of little use here. So, what of causal efficiency? Many\nsentences appear to provoke a wide range of possible responses. In\nresponse to, \u201cI went to the zoo last week,\u201d S could think\nof lions, tigers, bear, giraffes, monkeys, and any number of other\nnatural kinds. But, the question, \u201cWhat animal goes \u2018oink,\noink\u2019?\u201d\u2014perhaps uttered in \u201cMotherese\u201d\nin a clear deliberate fashion so that it is readily comprehensible to\na child\u2014will be rather efficient in generating thoughts of a\npig. Moreover, it could be more efficient than actual pigs, since a\nchild might have more experience with the question than with actual\npigs, often not figuring out that actual pigs are pigs. In such\nsituations, \u201cpig\u201d would turn out to mean \u201cWhat\nanimal goes \u2018oink, oink\u2019?,\u201d rather than pig. So,\nthere appear to be cases in which BTT could make prima facie\nincorrect content assignments.\n\nWhat, finally, of proximal projections of natural kinds? One plausible\nline might be to maintain that proximal projections of natural kinds\nare not themselves natural kinds, hence that they are automatically\nexcluded from the scope of the theory. This plausible line, however,\nmight be the only available line. Presumably, in the course of\nS\u2019s life, the only way dogs can cause \u201cX\u201ds is by way\nof causal mediators between the dogs and the \u201cX\u201ds. Thus,\neach episode in which a dog causes an \u201cX\u201d is also an\nepisode in which a sensory projection of a dog causes an\n\u201cX\u201d. So, dog efficiency for \u201cX\u201d can be no\nhigher the efficiency of dog sensory projections. And, if it is\npossible for there to be a sensory projection of a dog without there\nbeing an actual dog, then the efficiency of the projections would be\ngreater than the efficiency of the dogs. So, \u201cX\u201d could not\nmean dog. But, this problem is not necessarily damaging to BTT.\n\nSince the BTT has not received a critical response in the literature,\nwe will not devote a section to objections to it. Instead, we will\nleave well enough alone with our somewhat speculative treatment of how\nBTT might handle our familiar test cases. The general upshot is that\nthe combination of actual causal efficiency over the course of an\nindividual\u2019s lifetime along with the restriction to natural\nkinds provides a surprisingly rich means of addressing some\nlong-standing problems.\n",
