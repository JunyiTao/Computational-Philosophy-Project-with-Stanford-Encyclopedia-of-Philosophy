    "main_text": "Philological Kokugaku || Motoori Norinaga 1730\u20131801\n3.2 Motoori Norinaga 1730\u20131801\n\nMotoori Norinaga made pioneering and lasting contributions in all\naspects of Kokugaku: he elevated literary criticism on The Tale of\nGenji to new heights, with an impact that endures into the\npresent; his magnum opus was a philological analysis of and\ncomplete commentary on the 712 CE Kojiki, which was the last\nof Japan\u2019s most ancient classics to be linguistically\ndeciphered; and he used that analysis to construct a new form of Shinto, the kami no michi or Way\nof the kami (deities) that he claimed to be the original. Furthermore, his\nscholarship was known to Kyoto courtiers, and his counsel sought\nby daimyo. Remarkably Norinaga accomplished all this while spending\nalmost his entire life in Matsusaka in the virtual shadow of the Ise\nShrines.\n\nNorinaga applied the concept of mono no aware (the\nsadness/pity of things) to The Tale of Genji as well as to\nthe waka of the Shin Kokinsh\u016b poetry anthology,\nworks that his teacher Mabuchi eschewed because of their alleged\nfemininity and artifice in contrast to the\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b\u2019s natural masculinity.\nNorinaga, by contrast, argued that The Tale of Genji\nrealistically depicts how emotions profoundly infuse life\u2019s\nmajor events, and how this contributed to the novel\u2019s uncanny\nability to inspire its readers to suspend didactic or moralistic\ninterpretation and instead to enter emotionally into the tenth-century\nworld that was its setting. From this perspective, when a character in\nGenji acts or emotes in a certain way, the reader is invited\nnot to enquire into the Confucian moral or ethical propriety of the events\ndepicted, but rather into whether the reader has ever shared the\nexperience. This also overturned centuries of didactic Buddhist criticism\nof the novel on the grounds that it failed to praise good and condemn\nevil, and to show evil\u2019s consequences. So Norinaga\u2019s\napproach opened the door to a more modern literary criticism. In his\nwords: \n\n\nThe novel is neither like the Buddhist Way\u2026 nor like the\nConfucian Way\u2026. It is simply a tale of human life that leaves\naside and does not profess to take up at all the questions of good and\nbad and that dwells only on the goodness of those who are aware of the\nsorrow of human existence. (Tama no ogushi, SJTa: 421)\n\n\nIn an analogous manner, Norinaga extolled the elegance and refinement\n(miyabiyaka) of the verses of Shin Kokinsh\u016b.\nThis, he explained, was the consequence of its many poets\u2019\nability to detach sufficiently from their individual circumstances so that\nthrough their artistry (waza) they could capture the essence\nof mono no aware in just thirty-one syllables. This\nappreciation of poetic sophistication also desanctified waka\nfrom the cosmological significance that Mabuchi had attached to the\noldest Japanese verses.\n\nNorinaga\u2019s work on Kojiki formed the basis for his\nunderstanding of Japan\u2019s Way of the kami (kami no\nmichi, or in its Sino-Japanese reading Shint\u014d).\nWith his fundamentalist confidence in the text as a True Book\n(makoto no fumi) Norinaga argued that, as described in\nKojiki, the native Way of Japan was a Way created not by\nhumans like the imported Chinese Ways, but by the native kami\nwho are ultimately responsible for all human action and activity. And,\nbecause of the centrality of kami to Norinaga\u2019s\nthoughts on a native Japanese Way, Kokugaku has at times been referred\nto as a Shinto Revival. \n\nNorinaga\u2019s definition of the notoriously difficult term\nkami was more comprehensive than that of any of his\npredecessors in Kokugaku and has stood the test of time:\n\n\n\u2026the word kami signifies first the deities of heaven\nand earth who appear in the ancient records and the spirits of the\nshrines where they are worshiped. It is unnecessary to add that it\nincludes birds and beasts, trees and plants, seas and mountains, and\nso forth. In ancient usage, anything whatsoever which was outside the\nordinary, which possessed superior power or was awe-inspiriting was\ncalled kami\u2026. Evil and mysterious things, if they are\nextraordinary and dreadful, are also called kami, and among\nhuman beings who are called kami, the successive generations\nof divine emperors are all included. (Kojiki-den\n adapted from Holtom, 1938, quoted in SJT, 2001, 18.) \n\n\nIn this kami-determined world, people are as varied as the\n\u201ceight million\u201d kami, who are themselves some\ngood and some wicked:\n\n\nThe true heart (magokoro) is that heart with which one is\nborn by virtue of the Musubi (creating) kami, and among true\nhearts some are wise and some clumsy, some are good and some\nbad\u2026. Thus even the kami of the divine age were some\ngood and some bad, for they all behaved in accordance with their\nindividual true hearts. (Kuzubana {1968\u20131975: 8:\n147]\n\n\nThis allowed for an acceptance of individual difference, but it also\ninhibited any doctrine of personal, moral and ethical responsibility.\n\n\nBecause of the all-pervasive influence of kami and the fact\nthat the operations of the kami are beyond human ken, the\nworld always retains a wondrous quality and is never fully\nknowable:\n\n\nConsider the human body: It has eyes to see, ears to hear, a mouth to\nspeak, feet to walk, and hands to do a thousand things. Are they not\ntruly wonderful? Birds and insects fly in the sky, plants and trees\nbloom and bear fruit\u2014they are all wonderful\u2026. Thus the\nuniverse and all things therein are without a single exception strange\nand wondrous when examined carefully\u2026. [And] one must\nacknowledge that human intelligence is puny while the acts of the\nkami are illimitable and wondrous. (Kuzubana\n{1968\u20131975: 8: 160]\n\n\nAll one can know with certainty, according to Norinaga, is what is\nrecorded in the Divine Age chapters of Kojiki, and this text\nrendered the Divine Age proximate and no longer remote as it was for\nMabuchi. One\u2019s human responsibility is to act\nkannagara, i.e., in conformity to the wishes of the\nkami, and Norinaga cast the monarch (tenn\u014d) in\nKyoto as the physical link in a metaphysical chain that connected the\nJapanese people with the solar deity Amaterasu. For Norinaga,\nAmaterasu was both sun goddess and the sun itself, and so the world as\na whole owed a daily debt of gratitude to this quintessential Japanese\ndeity for the very gift of solar warmth and light. Beyond this\nNorinaga claimed that on the basis of Japanese mythology, Japan was\nthe primal source of all the world\u2019s countries compounding the\nworld\u2019s obligation to Japan.\n\nFor Norinaga, the native Japanese Heart (mikunigokoro) is\ndamaged in every generation by contaminating exposure to Chinese\nmoralism as represented especially by Confucianism; in its place an\ninferior Chinese Heart takes shape with the same deleterious effects\nin Japan as what Norinaga claimed one could observe in Chinese\nhistory. As he expressed this in verse:\n\n\nThough he may think himself\n Karagokoro\n\nRid of the Chinese heart\n nashi to omoedo\n\nThe heart of a man\n fumira yomu\n\nWho reads Chinese\n hito no kokoro wa\n\nIs still Chinese\n nao zo Kara naru. \n\n(adapted from\nMuraoka 1964: 148)\n\n\nThe way to purify and reanimate one\u2019s Japanese Heart was not\nthrough the medium of an ancient text like\nMan\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b, but rather through exorcising\nChinese contamination through the mediation of the kami.\n\nToward the end of his life Norinaga composed a liturgy for personal\nmorning worship, which was his way of elevating his thoughts on\nJapan\u2019s native ancient Way into something approaching a\ncontemporary religion. If Norinaga was constrained in this regard,\nhowever, it was by Kojiki itself, which depicted life after\ndeath as an uninviting eternity in the depraved and polluted nether\nworld called Yomi. As he expressed this in verse:\n\n\nPolluted Yomi\n Kitanakuni\n\nBourne of darkness\u2014\n yomi no kunibe\n\nHow dirty and disgusting!\n inashikome\n\nI want to stay in this world\n chi yo toko to wa ni\n\nA thousand ages evermore!\n kono yonomogamo. \n\n(adapted from\nMuraoka 1964: 151)\n\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that after Norinaga\u2019s death the\norientation of his school inclined toward the literary. There were no\nmajor texts from Japan\u2019s ancient past that required deciphering,\nand the linguistic challenges to such enquiries were prohibitively\ndifficult for Kokugaku to reach a broader audience. The mantle to the\nmore religious side of his Kokugaku was, in turn, claimed by a student\nwhom Norinaga never met.\n",
