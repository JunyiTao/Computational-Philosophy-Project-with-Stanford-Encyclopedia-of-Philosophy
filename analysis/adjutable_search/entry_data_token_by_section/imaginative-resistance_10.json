    "main_text": "Imagination || No-Imagination Theories\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, in \u201cthe puzzle of imaginative resistance\u201d\nso far only the word \u201cof\u201d has been uncontentious. However,\nthis should not be taken as a sign of impasse. Instead of engendering\nconfusion and disorientation, the liveliness of the debate points to\nthe richness of the topic and openings for new fronts in imaginative\nresistance research. This area of inquiry is still in its early stages\nand further research is needed on all of the topics discussed above.\nSome of most pressing research questions include: Are there\nungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How can one\novercome ungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How\ncan we revise the extant theories to account for variation in\nresistance reactions and diversity of resistance-triggering claims?\nThere is much more we can gather from further empirical research on\nthe topic, and there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nthe broader implications imaginative resistance has for fields such as\nmoral psychology, aesthetic psychology, cognitive architecture,\nsemantics and pragmatics of evaluative terms, modal epistemology, and\nso on (building on the work of scholars such as Levy 2005, Driver\n2008, Levin 2012).\n",
