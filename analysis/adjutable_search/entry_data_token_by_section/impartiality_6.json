    "main_text": "Moral impartiality I: Consequentialist moral theories || Consequentialist impartiality and justice\n3.3 Consequentialist impartiality and justice\n\nIn addition to claiming that consequentialist impartiality is too\ndemanding, many critics have also argued that it is too permissive.\nSince consequentialism makes the permissibility of an action entirely\ndependent on the value of that action\u2019s consequences, it follows\nthat there is no type of action that can be prohibited on\nconsequentialist grounds (except, of course, for that\n\u2018type\u2019 which is defined explicitly in terms of sub-optimal\nconsequences.) Thus instances of torture, premeditated murder, rape,\nand other violations of fundamental human rights are at least\npotentially justifiable on a consequentialist basis; no such action\ncan be ruled out, morally speaking, until the comparative value of the\nstate of affairs it will bring about has been determined.\n\nThe effect of this complaint, like the previous one, is not to deny\nthe claim that consequentialism is a deeply impartial moral theory,\nbut rather to suggest that it incorporates the wrong sort of\nimpartiality. Suppose, to take an example common in the literature,\nthat consequentialism recommends that a person be convicted of, and\npunished for, a crime they did not commit, in order to prevent the\npublic from rioting (Nielsen 1972). Such an action would, according to\ncommon intuitions, constitute a gross violation of justice; and it\nseems a weak reply to point out that the recommendation was arrived at\nthrough an impartial calculation \u2013 a calculation that took the\ninterests of every individual (including the framed man) into equal\naccount. For while the claim is, strictly speaking, true, there is\nnevertheless a clear and compelling case in favor of concluding that\nthe framed person was not treated impartially, in the sense\nthat ought to matter here. We expect a judicial system to allocate\npunishments in accordance with degree of guilt, not in accordance with\nthe expected value to society of the consequences in each case; and\nthe fact that both methods constitute forms of impartial\ndecision-making does not imply that they are equally morally\nacceptable.\n\nAgain, there are many ways the consequentialist might respond. As with\nthe demandingness objection, perhaps the most common response is to\nargue that something resembling ordinary rules and practices can be\njustified on the basis of consequentialist considerations. The classic\nversion of this response dates back to Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism\n(1992 [1861]). If institutions of justice are to be given a general\njustification, Mill argues, this justification must find its ultimate\ngrounding in utility to society; for what else could explain why\njustice is valued at all, other than the fact that it serves and\nprotects our interests? But since a justice system will only succeed\nin this role if it is governed by common principles of justice \u2013\nprinciples including, for instance, that only the guilty should be\npunished, and that the punishment ought to be proportional to the\ncrime \u2013 it follows that such principles are not opposed to\nconsequentialism at all. Rather, at the deepest justificatory level,\nconsequentialism and the demands of justice coincide. (See also\nNeilsen 1972)\n\nThe claim that such a coincidence generally obtains is probably easy\nto establish. The challenge for Mill, and for other consequentialists,\narises in those particular cases in which the coincidence fails.\nAssuming that the possibility of such cases does not move one to\nsimply abandon consequentialism in favor of some more justice-friendly\nconception (such as the rule consequentialism Mill himself sometimes\nseems to find attractive), there are two general defense strategies\nfor consequentialists to employ. The first strategy argues that there\nare good consequentialist reasons for being the sort of agent who\nrespects the dictates of justice even in cases in which the\ncoincidence between the demands of justice and those of\nconsequentialism fails (Pettit 1997; cf. Railton 1986). The second\nstrategy admits that there are cases in which unjust actions can be\ngiven a consequentialist justification, but holds that when so much as\nit stake, justice must give way to consequentialism\u2019s demands\n(Smart 1973; Kagan 1989; Pettit 1997). Whether either approach is\nsufficient, given the apparent depth and force of our common\nintuitions about the requirements of justice, is a matter of ongoing\ndebate.\n",
