    "main_text": "Action and Freedom || Actions and Excuses\n4.1 Actions and Excuses\n\nLet\u2019s begin with\n (1).\n Austin holds that we can make progress on questions about freedom and\naction by descending from reflection at the general level\u2014i.e.,\nreflection on freedom and action, per se\u2014to reflection\non the more specific ways in which we characterize and appraise\nactions. Austin\u2019s view about the general notions of acting, and\nof acting freely or responsibly, is structurally similar to his view\nabout the general notion of truth: he thinks of such general notions\nas dimension words, grouping a range of more specific\ncharacterizations. The basic range here consists in the various\nspecific ways in which we can characterize happenings as\nactions\u2014for example, as someone running to the shop, or as their\nreading a book. In addition to that basic range are what Austin calls\naggravations: the various specific ways in which we\ncharacterize someone as distinctively responsible for\nsomething that happens\u2014for example, when we characterize someone\nas having done something on purpose, intentionally, or deliberately.\nThe latter three aggravations are the topic of his \u201cThree Ways\nof Spilling Ink\u201d (1966).\n\nIn his \u201cA Plea for Excuses\u201d (1957), Austin argues that the\nminimal requirement for an agent to be responsible for an action of\ntheirs is that it be incorrect to characterize the action in\none or another way as something for which they were not fully\nresponsible\u2014as something for which they have an excuse.\nWe might, for example, characterize a happening as an accident, a\nmistake, involuntary, unintentional, inadvertent, or as due (in part)\nto clumsiness, lack of appreciation of circumstances, or incompetence.\nWhere an act is performed, and where no excuse is available, the\naction is one for which the actor counts as fully responsible. Where\none or another type of excuse is available, the specific type\nof excuses that are available mitigate in one or another specific way\nthe subject\u2019s responsibility for the occurrence of an action or\nits consequences, and so the extent to which the action is to be\ncounted as free. An excuse may do this by mitigating in various ways\nthe subject\u2019s responsibility either for an action considered as\na whole, or for proper sub-components of the action, or for\nconsequences of the action, or by indicating ways in which a happening\nis not (a paradigmatic case of) an action. The varieties of\npretending that Austin discusses in his\n\u201cPretending\u201d (1958a) are of importance to him, at least in\npart, because they provide for some distinctive forms of excuse. For\ninstance, one might seek to excuse what appeared to be an action of\ntype A by claiming that the agent was only pretending to\nA, pretending to be A-ing, or pretending that they\nwere A-ing. (One of Austin\u2019s aims in the paper is to\ndistinguish those ways of pretending.)\n\nOne of Austin\u2019s central aims in considering the variety of\nexcuses and aggravations is to shed light on the inner composition of\nresponsible action: the division between an action and its\nconsequences; the decomposition of an action into its various\nsub-components or phases; and what Austin calls the machinery of\naction:\n\n\n\u2026the detail of the complicated internal machinery we use in\n\u201cacting\u201d\u2014the receipt of intelligence, the\nappreciation of the situation, the invocation of principles, the\nplanning, the control of execution and the rest. (1957: 179)\n\n\nTurning now to\n (2),\n Austin thinks that there is a range of normal or standard cases of\nattributions of action with respect to which modification, by appeal\neither to aggravations or excuses, is impermissible. With respect to\nsuch normal or standard cases, it suffices, in order to characterize\nthe agent\u2019s role within them, simply to say what the agent did.\nTo add that the agent did the thing, for example, either voluntarily\nor involuntarily would be inappropriate, incorrect, or even\nsenseless. Austin summarizes this idea in the slogan, \u201cNo\nmodification without aberration\u201d. Amongst the supporting\nexamples he gives are the following:\n\n\nI sit in my chair, in the usual way\u2014I am not in a daze or\ninfluenced by threats or the like: here, it will not do to say either\nthat I sit in it intentionally or that I did not sit in it\nintentionally, nor yet that I sat in it automatically or from habit or\nwhat you will. It is bedtime, I am alone, I yawn: but I do not yawn\ninvoluntarily (or voluntarily!), nor yet deliberately. To yawn in any\nsuch peculiar way is just not to just yawn. (1957:\n 190)[23]\n\n\nAustin holds that modifiers like \u201cvoluntarily\u201d and\n\u201cinvoluntarily\u201d are used to assert the respective presence\nand absence of specific elements in the general machinery of action.\n(He suggests that such apparent pairs do not invariably target the\nvery same specific elements. See 1957: 189\u2013193.) Austin thinks\nthat philosophers have tended to assume that, given that someone has\ndone a specific thing, it will always be a further question whether\nthose pieces of machinery are present or absent. Moreover,\nphilosophers have aligned that question with the question whether the\nactor was responsible for what they did or acted freely. Those\nphilosophers have in effect been making the following pair of\nassumptions. They\u2019ve assumed, first, that there is a single type\nof piece of machinery such that for any action, the action\nwill be free and responsible just in case it involves that machinery.\nSecond, they\u2019ve assumed that the various aggravations serve\nindiscriminately to mark the presence of the required type of\nmachinery, while the various excuses serve to mark its absence.\n\nCharacteristically, Austin suggests that the situation is more\ncomplicated. In particular, although he thinks that, in normal or\nstandard cases, actors are responsible for what they do and act\nfreely, he holds that what makes that so can vary from case to case:\ndifferent types of machinery can account for freedom and\nresponsibility with respect to different types of action. He holds\nmoreover that different aggravating and excusing modifiers target\ndifferent pieces of machinery. And, finally, he holds that the\nappropriate use of a modifier doesn\u2019t depend only upon the\npresence or absence of instances of the type of action-machinery that\nit targets. In addition, it depends upon whether the targeted\nmachinery figures in normal cases of actions of the type in\n question.[24]\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s views about actions and excuses see\nForguson 1969a; Heintz 1981; Holdcroft 1969; Laugier 2018; Narboux 2011; New 1966;\nPetrie 1971; Searle 1966; Zimmerman 2004; Warnock 1989: 65\u201379;\nWhite 1967.)\n",
