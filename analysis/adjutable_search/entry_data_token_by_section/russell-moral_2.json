Sidgwick\u2019s Problem and the Rejection of Idealism\n\n\u201cWe called him \u2018old Sidg\u2019 and regarded him as merely\nout of date\u201d (My Philosophical Development: 30). So\nsaid Russell of his teacher, the great Victorian moral philosopher,\nHenry Sidgwick (though he later thought that he and his contemporaries\n\u201cdid not give [Sidgwick] nearly as much respect as he\ndeserved\u201d). But though Russell may have regarded Sidgwick as an\nold fogey, he set the agenda for a lot of Russell\u2019s work on ethics in\nthe 1890s. For Russell was much exercised by a problem that also\nbothered Sidgwick: the Dualism of Practical Reason. (See Sidgwick\n1907: 496\u2013516; see also Schulz 2004: ch. 4, in which it becomes\nabundantly clear how very preoccupied Sidgwick was with this problem.)\nAccording to Sidgwick, it is rational to do what is morally right (by\nmaximizing pleasurable consciousness on the part of all sentient\nbeings) and rational to do what is prudentially right (by maximizing\npleasurable consciousness on the part of oneself), but, when the two\ncome into conflict, the one does not seem to be any more rational than\nthe other. If God exists, then He can ensure that it will pay in the\nlong term to promote the public interest, by rewarding the righteous\nin the life to come. What is morally right will coincide with what is\nprudentially right, and that, consequently, is what Practical Reason\nwill command. But if, as Sidgwick was reluctantly inclined to think,\nthere is no God, what is morally right and what is prudentially right\nwill sometimes come apart, and Practical Reason will speak with a\ndivided voice. If it does not always pay to be good, then it is not\nclear that is more rational to be good than to be bad, a conclusion\nthat Sidgwick found deeply disturbing. The rather priggish young\nRussell was bothered by the problem too (a solution, he said, would be\n\u201ca real solid addition to my happiness\u201d) because, like\nSidgwick, he did not believe in God. But as a fashionable young\nphilosopher of the 1890s he did believe in something that he thought\nwould do nearly as well, namely, the Absolute. For at this time,\nRussell, like most of his philosophical contemporaries in the\nEnglish-speaking world, was a neo-Hegelian or Absolute Idealist.\nThough we may seem to be living in a material world and to be\nmaterial boys and girls, this is an Appearance only. Reality, the\nAbsolute, is basically mental, a sort of timeless and harmonious group\nmind of which our separate selves are (perhaps delusory) aspects. As\nBradley put it,\n\n\nthe Absolute is one system, and \u2026 its contents are nothing but\nsentient experience. It will hence be a single and all-inclusive\nexperience, which embraces every partial diversity in concord. For it\ncannot be less than appearance, and hence no feeling or thought, of\nany kind, can fall outside its limits. (1930 [1893]: 129)\n\n\n(We stress that it is hard to present this doctrine concisely without\ngross caricature.) But there was a crucial difference between\nMcTaggart and Bradley, the two leading idealists of Russell\u2019s day.\nMcTaggart believed in personal immortality and claimed the harmony\nthat already exists timelessly (so to speak) \u201cmust some day\nbecome explicit\u201d (McTaggart 1996 [1893]: 210\u2013211). Bradley\ndid not.\n\nAt first Russell was an adherent of McTaggart. This afforded him a\nneat solution to Sidgwick\u2019s problem. The happy day when the harmony\nbecomes explicit can be promoted or retarded by human action. If I\nbenefit myself at your expense not only am I doing down a self with\nwhom I am, in Reality, intimately linked\u2014I am putting off the\nday when the harmony that Really Is becomes apparent. And since this\nharmony will be supremely pleasurable I am harming myself into the\nbargain. Hence morality and self-interest coincide and Practical\nReason is reunited with itself (Russell, 1893, \u201cOn the\nFoundations of Ethics\u201d, RoE:\n37\u201340/Papers 1: 206\u2013211). This illustrates the\npoint made by a number of unkind critics, that in the late\n19th century Absolute Idealism functioned as a sort of\nmethadone program for high-minded Victorian intellectuals, providing\nthem with moral uplift as they struggled to get off the hard stuff of\nofficial Christianity. (See Stove 1991: chs. 5 & 6; Allard 2003\nand, in more restrained language, Griffin 2003b: pp. 85\u201388.)\nBefore long however, Russell moved over to Bradley\u2019s camp and ceased\nto believe that the timelessly existing harmony would become manifest\nin time. Nevertheless, since we are all aspects of the Absolute, a\nsort of timeless super-self, there is essentially the same objection\nto indulging my desires at your expense as there is to indulging one\nof my own passions at the expense of others which are inconsistent\nwith it. I am hurting, if not myself, at least a larger whole of which\nwe are both parts (Russell, 1894, \u201cCleopatra or Maggie\nTulliver\u201d, RoE: 57\u201367/Papers I:\n92\u20138). But before long even this solution ceased to satisfy. In\na paper not published until 1957, \u201cSeems Madam? Nay It\nIs\u201d, Russell argued (as he put it to Moore) that \u201cfor all\npurposes that are not purely intellectual, the world of\nAppearance is the real world\u201d. In particular, the hypothesis\nthat there is a timeless and harmonious Reality provides no\nconsolation for our present pains since it is a Reality that we never\nget to experience. If \u201cthe world of daily life remains wholly\nunaffected by [Reality], and goes on its way just as if there were no\nworld of Reality at all\u201d, and if this world of Reality is a\nworld that we not only do not but cannot experience\n(since experience is necessarily temporal), how can its alleged\nexistence afford us any consolation for what seems to be (and\ntherefore is) evil in the world of Appearance? (Russell,\n1897, \u201cSeems, Madam? Nay, It Is\u201d, RoE:\n79\u201386/Papers 1: 105\u2013111/Why I am Not a\nChristian: 75\u201382).\n\nNow this argument has an interesting corollary which Russell does not\nexplicitly draw. It may be that in Reality the pains I inflict on you\naffect me\u2014or at least a larger mind-like thing in which we both\nparticipate\u2014but if I never experience those effects,\nhow can this give me a motive to do or forbear if my interests\nconflict with yours? How can the fact that you and I are in Reality\none (or at least part of one) give me a reason to look out for you, if\nthis oneness is something I never experience? If Absolute Idealism can\nprovide no consolation for life\u2019s disasters\u2014which is what\nRussell is explicitly arguing\u2014then it seems that it cannot\nsupply me with a reason not to visit those disasters on you, if doing\nso is likely to benefit me. It may be that I suffer in a metaphysical\nsort of way when I profit at your expence, but if this suffering is\nsomething I never feel (since I am effectively confined to\nthe world of Appearance) why should this bother me? Thus the Dualism\nof Practical Reason reasserts itself. Sometimes what is morally right\nis at odds with what is prudentially right and when it is, there seems\nno reason to prefer the one to the other.\n\nWhether Russell realized this is not entirely clear. What is clear is\nthat \u201cSeems, Madam? Nay, It Is\u201d marks the beginning of the\nend for Russell\u2019s Absolute Idealism. Once he realized that\n\n\nfor all purposes that are not purely intellectual [including\nperhaps the purpose of providing moral uplift] the world of Appearance\nis the real world,\n\n\nRussell came to feel that the world of Reality was no use for purely\nintellectual purposes either and soon resolved to do without it. A big\n\u201cR\u201d Reality, that could neither console us for life\u2019s\ntroubles nor reconcile Duty and Interest, was a big \u201cR\u201d\nReality that might as well not exist. The methadone of Absolute\nIdealism having failed, Russell was forced to accept appearances at\nface value.\n\nBut what about the problem of the Dualism of Practical Reason? In\nlater life, Russell ceased to worry about it perhaps because he\nrealized that it is a problem that cannot be resolved. The Cosmos of\nDuty really is a Chaos (as Sidgwick rather colorfully put it). Duty\nand Interest can come into conflict, and when they do, there\nis no decisive reason for preferring the one to the other. All you can\ndo is to try to instill moral and altruistic motivations, which is\nwhat Russell tried to do with his children. But when they asked\nwhy they should care about other people (as his daughter Kate\ndefiantly did) his response was rather lame.\n\n\nKate:\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to! Why should I?\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cBecause more people will be happier if you do than if you\ndon\u2019t.\u201d\nKate:\n\u201cSo what? I don\u2019t care about other people.\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cYou should.\u201d\nKate:\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cBecause more people will be happier if you do than if you\ndon\u2019t.\u201d (RoE: 16; Tait 1975: 185)\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t much of an answer, but since the Cosmos of Duty really is a\nChaos, it was perhaps the best that Russell could do.\n",
