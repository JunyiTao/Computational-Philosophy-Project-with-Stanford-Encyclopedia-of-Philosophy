    "main_text": "The metaphysics of agency || Three metaphysical frameworks\n3.1 Three metaphysical frameworks\nAccording to an event-causal approach, agency is to be\nexplained in terms of event-causal relations between agent-involving\nstates and events.[11]\nOn this view, actions are events, and an\nevent is an action just in case it has the right event-causal\nhistory.[12] We\nmay call this a reductive approach to agency, as it reduces\nthe agent\u2019s role in the exercise of agency to the causal roles\nof agent-involving states and events. Obviously, the standard theory\nbelongs to this reductive event-causal framework, because it explains\nagency in terms of causation by the agent\u2019s mental states and\nevents.[13]\n(Proponents include Davidson 1963, 1971; Goldman 1970; Brand 1984;\nBratman 1987; Dretske 1988; Bishop 1989; Mele 1992, 2003; En\u00e7\n2003.)\nAccording to an agent-causal approach, agency is to be\nexplained in terms of a kind of substance-causation: causation by the\nagent, construed as a persisting substance. On this view, actions are\nevents, and an event is an action just in case it has the right\nagent-causal history.[14]\nThis framework provides\na non-reductive account of agency insofar as it holds that an\nagent\u2019s role in the exercise of agency is to be construed in\nterms of the exercise of an irreducible agent-causal power (Chisholm\n1964; Taylor 1966; O\u2019Connor 2000; see also Clarke 2003; Lowe\n2008).\nAccording to a volitionist approach, agency is to be\nexplained in terms of acts of the will, usually called\n\u201cvolitions\u201d. On this view, volitions are the source of\nagency: an overt movement is an action just in case it is caused, in\nthe right way, by a volition. Volitions themselves are entirely\nuncaused and they are sui generis acts: they are acts in\nvirtue of their intrinsic properties, not in virtue of some extrinsic\nor relational property (such as having the right causal\nhistory). This is also a non-reductive approach to agency, but it\ndiffers sharply from both the event-causal and the agent-causal\nframework in the important respect that it rejects the suggestion\nthat all actions are events with a certain causal history (Ginet\n1990; McCann 1998; see also Lowe 2008).[15]\nThe event-causal framework is by far the most widely accepted view\nin the contemporary philosophy of mind and action. One reason for this\nis that the commitment to the event-causal framework is tantamount to\na commitment to a very minimal and widely endorsed kind of naturalism,\naccording to which any appeal to irreducible substance-causation or\nteleology is to be avoided. Further, this commitment to the\nevent-causal framework is sustained by a widespread dissatisfaction\nwith alternative agent-causal and volitionist theories of agency. Some\nobjections to agent-causal theories derive from more general\nobjections to the notion of substance-causation, others address more\ndirectly the agent-causal account of agency. It has been argued, for\ninstance, that appeal to substances leaves both the timing and the\nmanner of causation mysterious (Broad 1952). Further, it has been\nargued that substance-causation collapses into event-causation, once\nit is acknowledged that a substance has its causal powers in virtue of\nits properties (Clarke 2003: Ch. 10). Others have argued that an\nappeal to the agent as a cause is vacuous, because it has no\nexplanatory import (Davidson 1971), and because it cannot explain what\nan agent\u2019s exercise of control consists in (Schlosser 2010). A\ncommon objection to volitionist accounts is that they generate a\nregress of mental acts (Ryle 1949). Arguably, though, this objection\nbegs the question. The view holds that overt actions are to be\nexplained in terms of volitions. There is no need to appeal to further\nmental acts of the will in order to explain why volitions are actions,\nbecause volitions are actions sui generis (see En\u00e7\n2003 for discussion). This, however, points also to the reason why\nthe view is widely rejected. Volitionist theories stipulate as\nprimitive what appears to be in need of explanation. In particular,\nthey do not explain what an agent\u2019s exercise of control consists\nin, as the agent is merely the subject or the bearer of volitions\n(O\u2019Connor 2000: 25\u201326; Clarke 2003:\n17\u201324). Moreover, if, as most contemporary philosophers would\nassume, volitions are realized by events in the brain, the view\nappears to be in tension with the fact that there are no events in the\nbrain that are entirely uncaused.\n",
