    "main_text": "Four Traditions || Pragmatic Twist Accounts\n4.2 Pragmatic Twist Accounts\n\nPragmatic Twist Accounts maintain that when we resort to\nmetaphor, we use words and phrases with their standard literal\nmeanings to say one thing, put one thing into words, yet we\nare taken to mean, taken to assert or acknowledge or\notherwise indicate, something entirely different. Our sentence as used\nby us means one thing, we in using it mean or are properly construed\nas meaning something entirely different. Metaphor is a genre of\ndeliberate and overt suggestion, one by means of which speakers\ncommit themselves to, implicitly vouch for the truth\nof, the things they suggest. Paraphrase is an effort to get at\nwhat is metaphorically suggested by putting it (or some part of it, or\nsome approximation to it) directly into words, thereby explicitly\nsaying (more or less fully and more or less accurately) what was\nimplicitly vouched for by the original metaphorical utterance.\n\nThe thought that metaphor concerns what speakers mean as\nopposed to what their words mean is old and widespread. Often\nit comes with the further thought that metaphor reveals by\nconcealing\u2014revealing things in the end by concealing them at the\noutset.\n\nThe poet says B but he means A. He hides A\nin B. B is the normal everyday meaning that the\nwords so to speak \u201cought\u201d to have on the face of them, and\nA is what the poet really has to say to us, and which he can\nonly say through or alongside, or by modifying, these normal everyday\nmeanings. A is his own new, original, or poetic meaning.\n(Barfield, 1962)\n\n\nThe first concerted attempt to build a philosophical account of\nmetaphor around these familiar ideas was Grice\u2019s account of\nconversational implicature in the second of his 1967 William James\nLectures, which appeared with various supplementations and\nafterthoughts as Grice (1989).\n\nThe following exposition lightly modernizes Grice\u2019s own at\ncertain points. For fuller discussions of Grice\u2019s work as a\nwhole see the entries concerning\n Paul Grice,\n implicature, and\n pragmatics.\n Detailed elaborations of Grice\u2019s account of metaphor were\noffered by Searle (1979a) and Martinich (1984).\n\nA conversation is a loosely collaborative exchange of\ninformation having one or more mutually understood aims. Participants\npresume they share certain pertinent information already, but each is\npresumed to need further information the others might be in a position\nto provide. In conversations we can and regularly do hold the other\nparticipants responsible for the truth of both more and less\u2014in\nsome ways more, in other ways less\u2014than they explicitly put into\nwords. For once a conversation is under way, each of us is entitled to\ninterpret the words of the others in light of the supposition that\nthey are cooperative, rational, and unconfused about the current state\nof conversational play, even if there is good reason to doubt or\ndisbelieve this supposition, e.g. even if they exhibit troubling\nsigns of recklessness or deceitfulness. This is an application to\nspeech of a much more general principle: in improvised voluntary\ncollaborations of any sort, the responsibilities a given party\nshoulders are those he willingly lets himself seem ready to shoulder,\nno more and no less.\n\nSo my words may imply something I don\u2019t: if something my words\nimply is manifestly so firmly accepted already as to need no\ncertification from me, or so firmly rejected or patently unknowable by\nme as to be unable to benefit from any certification I might attempt,\nit forms no part of what I commit myself to in speaking my words. On\nthe other hand, I may imply something my words don\u2019t: I can\nand do vouch for the truth of a thing that isn\u2019t implied by the\nwords I speak when my audience can square my utterance of those words\nwith the supposition that I am cooperative, rational, and unconfused\nabout the state of conversational play only by assuming that I am in a\nposition to vouch for that thing\u2019s truth (in that I believe it\nand have good grounds for believing it) and am prepared to actually do\nso. Such, nearly enough, was how Grice defined the special kind\nof speaker meaning he dubbed conversational implicature.\n\nThis tells us what implicature is but not how it happens. For that we\nneed four more ideas. (1) Declarative sentences are standing equipment\nfor calling attention to the propositions they express: the\nproposition an uttered sentence calls to mind most immediately,\nreliably, and deliberately is the one it semantically expresses. (2)\nOnce a conversation is under way I can vouch for the truth of any\nproposition whatsoever by calling attention to it with a sufficient\nshow of deliberateness, if I am plausibly in a position to\nvouch for its truth and if no other plausible motive for\ncalling attention to it can be expected to come to mind. (3) Suppose I\ncall attention to a thing of any sort with a sufficient show\nof deliberateness. If the thing strikes my audience as a fully\nappropriate object of attention in its own right, their attention will\ndwell on it and go no further; they\u2019ll treat my drawing their\nattention to it as an end in itself, as it were. But if the thing\ndoesn\u2019t strike them as an appropriate resting place for\ntheir attention, they\u2019ll view my drawing their attention to it\nas a means to some further attentional end, an effort to refer\nattention onward to some further, ultimately more worthy object. (4)\nWhat a cooperative, rational, unconfused speaker is out to vouch\nfor as true in speaking as she does includes both what she is\nout to get across, the part expected to address her\nlistener\u2019s presumed informational needs, and a rudimentary\nrationale for speaking as she does, serving to reconcile the\nwords she produces with the supposition that she is cooperative,\nrational, and unconfused. For without a reputation for being\ncooperative, rational, and unconfused, a speaker simply won\u2019t be\nable to collaborate effectively with her audience. Of course, parts of\nwhat she is out to vouch for may do double duty, meeting the\nlistener\u2019s informational needs while at the same time helping to\npreserve or cultivate her own reputation.\n\nSo: if she is cooperative, rational, and unconfused, a speaker does\nher best to endow her contribution\u2014the content she is\nout to vouch for, the part of that content she is out to get across,\nand the verbal form she employs for these purposes\u2014with certain\nfeatures that are manifestly desirable from her listener\u2019s point\nof view. She does her best to comply with certain familiar\nconversational maxims:\n\nQuality: Be truthful: vouch only for what you believe and is\nwell supported by your evidence.\n\n\nQuantity: Make what you are out to get across informative\nbut not overinformative, appropriate in scope and shape to what a\nlistener can readily absorb in a single conversational turn.\n\n\nRelation: Make what you are out to get across\nrelevant to the listener\u2019s presumed informational\nneeds.\n\n\nManner: Manage the relation between what you are out to get\nacross and the words by means of which you endeavor to get it across\nso as to render your utterance clear, unambiguous, efficient,\nand orderly. (26\u20137)\n\n\n(The maxims concern characteristics that are matters of degree, so the\nbest way to read them is a matter of some controversy. On the\ninterpretation adopted here, I obey Relation if and only if what I am\nout to get across is both (a) adequately relevant and (b) about as\nrelevant as I can readily make it without sacrificing anything of\ncomparable importance. Similarly for the other maxims. On this\ninterpretation, Gricean maxims don\u2019t call on us to maximize\nanything.)\n\nListeners know that cooperative, rational, unconfused speakers do\ntheir best to comply with the maxims. So speakers can arrange\nfor a difference between what they express and what they are properly\ntaken to vouch for by speaking so as to put their reputation for\ncooperativeness, rationality, and unconfusedness in a kind of\ncontrolled short-term jeopardy from which their listeners can readily\nrescue them.\n\nSuppose speaker S expresses proposition P in words\nW. And suppose circumstances are such that if we\nwere to understand S as out to vouch for the truth of\nP and P alone, no more and no less, in uttering\nW, we would thereby portray S as avoidably violating\nmaxim M or at least, avoidably inviting the suspicion that\nshe is avoidably violating it, with the consequence that either her\ncontribution is gratuitously unresponsive to her audience\u2019s\ninformational needs or she is gratuitously neglecting to maintain her\nreputation as cooperative, rational, and unconfused. In either case,\nshe wouldn\u2019t be behaving as a cooperative, rational,\nunconfused speaker must. To clear her her of this charge, to\nsquare our interpretation of her words with the governing supposition\nthat she is behaving as a cooperative, rational, unconfused\nspeaker must, we need to find something more or\nsomething else she might be out to vouch for.\n\nFour basic scenarios are possible here.\n\n(1) Sometimes P and P alone is what S is\nout to get across, despite the fact that getting P and\nP alone across by means of W manifestly violates\nsome particular maxim. In that case S may be designedly\ncalling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the truth of, some\nplausible account of why her informational and expressive resources\nleave her in a position where some such violation couldn\u2019t be\nhelped\u2014confront her with a clash of maxims.\n\nA: Where does C live?\n\nB: Somewhere in the South of France.\n\n[B implicitly signals that he can\u2019t be adequately informative\nand truthful at the same time, hence implicates that he doesn\u2019t\nknow which town C lives in.] (32)\n\n\n(2) Sometimes getting P and P alone across by means\nof W would manifestly violate some maxim or other if\nS were in a position to vouch for any of various manifestly more\ndesirable propositions by expressing one of them via any of various\nmanifestly available sequences of words. In that case S may\nbe designedly calling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the\ntruth of, some plausible account of why she couldn\u2019t do\nthis\u2014why her respect for the maxims actually puts each of these\nmore desirable-looking contributions off limits.\n\nA: Some students passed. [A implicitly signals that he isn\u2019t in\na position to offer the more informative, equally compact All\nstudents passed, hence implicates that (for all he knows) some\nstudents didn\u2019t pass.]\n\n\n(3) Sometimes the expression of P by means of W\nwould manifestly violate some particular maxim if P and P\nalone were what S was out to get across, but the natural\ninference is that what she was out to get across was P and then\nsome: the expression of P by means of W readily\ncalls to mind some unique more inclusive story Q about the\nworld of which P forms an essential part, such that\nS might plausibly be in a position to vouch for\nQ\u2019s truth and such that doing so by means of\nW, if it could be managed, might plausibly comply\nwith all the maxims. In that case S may be designedly calling\nattention to, hence trying to vouch for the truth of, the whole of\nQ.\n\nA: I am out of petrol.\n\nB: There\u2019s a garage around the corner.\n\n[B implicates that the garage in question may be open and\nmay have gas to sell, hence may be an efficient way\nto satisfy A\u2019s declared need, since only against this background\ncould the expressed fact that the garage is around the corner be\nexpected to be relevant to A\u2019s informational needs.] (32)\n\n\n(4) Last but not least, sometimes the expression of P by\nmeans of W would manifestly violate some particular maxim if\nP formed any essential part of what S was\nout to get across, and the natural inference is that what she was out\nto get across is something entirely different: the expression\nof P by means of W readily calls to mind some unique\nalternative message Q about the world of which P\nforms no part whatsoever, such that S might plausibly be in a\nposition to vouch for Q\u2019s truth and such that doing so\nby means of W, if it could be managed, might\nplausibly comply with all the maxims. (Such is the residual force of\nthe idea that verbal expressions of P are equipment for\nasserting P that S will still be viewed as vouching\nfor the truth of P as well unless doing so is manifestly out\nof the question in the circumstances at hand, as it often will be.\nWhat she won\u2019t be vouching for is P\u2019s\nvalue or interest in the light of her\nlistener\u2019s presumed informational needs.)\n\nWhen such a Q readily comes to mind, S may be\ndesignedly calling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the truth\nof, Q. In such a case, S is enabled to fulfill a\nconversational maxim (by meaning something other than what she\nactually expresses) precisely by speaking in such a way that she would\nflout the maxim, blatantly violate it, if she were to mean what she\nsays. Grice speaks in such cases of exploiting the maxim in\nquestion. To exploit a maxim is to fulfill it \u201cat the level\nof\u201d what one means by manifestly and avoidably violating\nit\u2014flouting it\u2014\u201cat the level of\u201d what one\nexpresses.\n\nThere are two main ways to play out this scenario.\n\nOn the first, Q admits of intelligible and compact expression\nbut is something the speaker is understandably reluctant to assert\noutright. The notorious letter of recommendation example is of this\nkind.\n\nA: Dear Sir, Mr. X\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his\nattendance at tutorials has been regular.\n\n\u201c[A] cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the\nman is his pupil; moreover, he knows more information than this is\nwanted [and information of a different kind: A would be in violation\nof Quantity if what he said formed any part of what he\nmeant]. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information he is\nreluctant to write down. This supposition is only tenable if he thinks\nMr. X is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is\nimplicating.\u201d (33)\n\n\nOn the second, Q is so extensive or so resistant to\nintelligible compact expression for other reasons that the benefits to\nspeaker and listener alike of a terse and simple utterance outweigh\nthe inferential costs to the listener involved in extracting a large\nmessage from a small package. This is often the case with allusions,\nfor instance. Where outright explicit assertion can\u2019t be managed\nor can be managed only with excessive effort on both sides, suggestion\nhas to suffice and will violate no general conversational norms.\n\nGrice proposes that metaphor exemplifies this second way of playing\nout  the flouting scenario. Suppose I say to you,\n\u201cyou\u2019re the cream in my coffee.\u201d No human being\nliterally is or literally could be a dollop of viscous potable dairy\nproduct I could literally stir into a piping hot breakfast beverage.\nThis is a commonplace acceptance of which on your part isn\u2019t\nabout to be shaken by any words from me. So for you to take me as out\nto get that across, alone or in combination with other\nthings, would be for you to take me to be \u201cblatantly and\ninexplicably\u201d violating Quantity (and/or Relation); you\u2019d\nbe portraying me as being utterly, obviously, and to all appearances\npointlessly untruthful, uninformative, and irrelevant. But in\ncircumstances such as these, the proposition that you\u2019re the\ncream in my coffee reliably calls to mind a certain particular other\nproposition, \u201cattributing to [you] some feature or features in\nrespect of which [you] resemble (more or less fancifully) the\nmentioned substance.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the proposition that\nyou\u2019re such a comforting luxury (for me) that you\u2019ve\nbecome a necessity (for me) for most intents and purposes\u2014a\nproposition whose explicit expression is regrettably clumsy and\nlongwinded and ungenerous. (In fact the 1924 DeSylva, Brown, and\nHenderson lyric Grice is quoting from continues as follows:\n\u201cYou\u2019re the cream in my coffee, / You\u2019re the salt in\nmy stew, / You will always be / My necessity, / I\u2019d be lost\nwithout you\u2026\u201d) The only obvious reason I could have for\ncalling your attention to this proposition in these circumstances is\nin order to get it across and hence, vouch for its truth. So I do\nvouch for its truth.\n\nBy speaking of \u201cmore or less fanciful resemblance,\u201d Grice\nreinstated the ancient idea that metaphor is a special figure based in\nsome special way upon likeness or analogy. Subsequent advocates of an\nimplicature approach to metaphor were sometimes skeptical about this\nfeature of the account. Searle, for instance, found it hard to see any\nreal resemblance between literally cold things and metaphorically cold\npeople. After starting a long list of possible relations between what\na metaphorical speaker says about an object and what she should be\ntaken to mean, he despairs of completing it:\n\nThe question, \u201cHow do metaphors work?\u201d is a bit like the\nquestion, \u201cHow does one thing remind us of another thing?\u201d\nThere is no single answer to either question\u2026 (Searle,\nIntroduction to Expression and Meaning, 1979, x)\n\n\nThis registers an important general fact about pragmatic explanations\nin the Gricean style. Conversational implicatures can come off only if\nsomething in particular reliably comes to mind once there is an\nappearance of a maxim violation to explain or explain away. Often\nenough, something in particular does reliably come to mind,\nbut Gricean conversational principles in and of themselves do nothing\nto explain what comes to mind or why it does so.\n\nOne and the same metaphor can often be plausibly paraphrased in\nsubstantively different ways. Yet Grice\u2019s account appears to\ndepend on there being some unique alternative message that\nreliably comes to mind when the speaker\u2019s words are pondered. It\nhas struck some commentators that metaphorical interpretation involves\na kind of indeterminacy Gricean implicature theory can\u2019t readily\naccommodate. See Davis (1998), 70\u201374 and the response by Saul\n(2001) for the main arguments on both sides.\n\nThere is also the phenomenon of twice-apt metaphor (Hills,\n1997, 2008). Consider Romeo\u2019s death speech:\n\nRomeo: Here\u2019s to my love! [He drinks] O true apothecary!\n\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\u20145.3.119\u2013120\n\n\nWho\u2019s the true apothecary? The impoverished pharmacist who sold\nRomeo the poison, or death itself? Both, surely. From time to time we\nare induced to construe one and the same utterance both\nliterally and metaphorically. In such cases an utterance is\nalready apt, already in complete accord with\npertinent conversational norms, when regarded as an effort to mean\nwhat one says, no more and no less. Yet a metaphoric reconstrual of\nthe utterance comes to mind anyway, without the spur of any\nthreatened impropriety in the initial literal construal on which it is\nbased, and listeners view the speaker as vouching for the truth of\nboth construals at once.\n\nDeterminacy worries help motivate one influential and sweeping\nreworking of Gricean pragmatics, the relevance theory of\nSperber and Wilson (1995). In an early and somewhat simplified\nformulation (Sperber and Wilson 1985), relevance theory takes metaphor\nto be an especially dramatic form of loose talk and takes talk in\ngeneral to be at least somewhat loose most of the time. What is meant\ntypically departs from what is said, to the point where all a speaker\never commits herself to in expressing a proposition is a\nnoteworthy interpretive resemblance between this proposition\nand the one whose truth she is out to vouch for. (Two propositions\nbear an interpretive resemblance to one another in a given setting to\nthe extent that they have similar consequences, given whatever is\nmutually taken for granted in that setting.) And speakers can\nanticipate what competent listeners will take them to mean only up to\na point. What they can most firmly anticipate being taken to mean is\nstrongly implied by their utterance, what they may or may not\nbe taken to mean, depending on facts about the listeners they\naren\u2019t in a position to know, is only weakly implied.\nThe result is that what\u2019s meant by an utterance, what the\nspeaker vouches for in speaking as she does, isn\u2019t sharply\ndelimited but trails off, in much the way that good paraphrases\ntypically trail off.\n\nWhen a listener L provisionally decides that utterance\nU is worth processing, he goes into the deductive inference\nbusiness in the following highly specific manner:\n\n(a) L starts with U alone as his premise set\nP, but he gradually adds auxiliary\nassumptions to P, starting with what\u2019s\nmost salient (in the present context) and most firmly taken for\ngranted (for present conversational purposes), but proceeding\neventually to add assumptions that are progressively less and less\nsalient, less and less firmly taken for granted.\n\n\n(b) L proceeds to derive consequences from his slowly\nexpanding premise set P, starting with the\nmost immediate and easily derived ones, but proceeding eventually to\nderive others that are more and more remote, more and more difficult\nto derive.\n\n\n(c) As he does so, L retains any derived consequences he\njudges to be sufficiently novel, sufficiently credible, and\nsufficiently worthy of his attention, given an understanding of his\nneeds and interests and responsibilities as a consumer of information\nthat\u2019s presumptively shared by himself and the speaker,\naccumulating these consequences in a set C.\n\n\n(d) L continues until he finally harvests a set of\nconsequences C he regards as adequately\ncompensating him for the effort it took to obtain it\u2014or he\ndespairs of reaching such a point and casts about for some other\nstimulus to process instead.\n\n\nIn the former case, where L does eventually feel adequately\ncompensated for his processing of U, he stops processing\nU at this break-even point and takes U to properly\nconvey the consequence set C. In the latter\ncase, L doesn\u2019t treat U as properly conveying\nanything at all.\n\nIn general C will be in some ways stronger,\nin other ways weaker, than U itself. In some ways stronger,\nsince auxiliary hypotheses have got in on the act. In other ways\nweaker, since various parts of U\u2019s own content that\nhave been judged to be old news, obviously false, or simply not worth\nattending to have fallen by the wayside.\n\nSuppose this is how listeners always process utterances. Then\nto the considerable extent that speakers can anticipate the course of\nsuch processing (what will get added to the premise set, what\nconsequences will get drawn, what will get discarded along the way,\nwhere the break-even point will be reached), speakers can anticipate\nwhat listeners will make of their words. Yet they can\u2019t\nanticipate the course or extent of listeners\u2019 processing in\ncomplete detail, with the result that their responsibility for what a\nlistener makes of their words, the degree to which they can be said to\nhave vouched in advance for the results of the listener\u2019s\nprocessing, trails off as this processing continues. Sperber and\nWilson contend that this processing model accounts for standard\nGricean implicatures, metaphors included, without requiring\nthe listener to reconstruct the speaker\u2019s precise rationale for\nspeaking as she did and without a rich and contentious set of\nconversational norms.\n\nBut why should we believe that this is how listeners always\nprocess inferences?\n\nFirst, it is a general principle of human cognition (and one whose\ntruth we all implicitly recognize) that our attention always goes to\nwhatever stimulus in our environment (if any) looks to be most worth\nprocessing then and there, whatever looks then and there to be\n\u201coptimally relevant\u201d (if anything does). A stimulus counts\nas just plain relevant if it\u2019s worth processing at all, and how\nrelevant or worth processing a stimulus actually is depends jointly on\ntwo things about it:\n\n(a) how much novel and pertinent information one could extract by\nprocessing the stimulus, and\n\n\n(b) how little processing effort it would cost us to extract this\ninformation.\n\n\nThe processing of any stimulus takes the form of extracting more and\nmore remote consequences from the conjunction of it with less and less\nantecedently salient, less and less antecedently taken-for-granted,\nauxiliary assumptions. Such is the Cognitive Principle of\nRelevance.\n\nSecond, in claiming the attention of a listener at all, a speaker\nimplicitly assures him that the stimulus she\u2019s offering him is\nrelevant and indeed optimally relevant\u2014the most relevant\nstimulus within reach. (In view of the Cognitive Principle, he\nwouldn\u2019t process her utterance unless he took it to be the most\nrelevant stimulus within reach, so to induce him to process it, she\nmust get him to take it to be the most relevant stimulus within\nreach.) Such is the Communicative Principle of Relevance.\n\nFrom these principles, Sperber and Wilson deduce two key\ncorollaries:\n\n(I) When I provisionally deem a stimulus optimally relevant, I\nundertake to keep processing it until one of two things happens: (a) I\nreap a consequence set that strikes me as worth the effort I\u2019ve\nso far invested, or (b) I change my mind about whether the stimulus is\nindeed optimally relevant. Whether it would seem worth my while to\nprocess this stimulus any further once I reached the break-even point\nwould depend on further information available to me if and when I\nactually reach that point.\n\n\n(II) In claiming the attention of a listener for her utterance, and\nthus implicitly vouching for its optimal relevance, the speaker is\nimplicitly vouching for the truth of all the propositions she can\nexpect the listener to collect into his consequence set by processing\nthat utterance to the extent implicitly encouraged by deeming the\nutterance optimally relevant.\n\n\nIf we grant both (I) and (II), then we have at once a story about why\nlisteners process utterances as relevance theory claims and a story\nabout why speakers implicitly vouch for the results of such\nprocessing, insofar as these results are foreseeable. In claiming the\nattention of L for my utterance U, I\u2019m\nimplicitly vouching for the truth of whatever I can expect L\nto come up with if he processes U the way he\u2019d process\nany promising stimulus and continues to do so until it yields a result\nthat adequately repays his investment of effort to date. But this is\nall I implicitly vouch for in speaking as I do. After that, the\nlistener is on his own.\n\nThe trickiest part of this is the argument for (II). Suppose some\nsignificant part of the consequence set C\nthat L can be expected to extract from U is either\n(undetectably) false or (undetectably) undeserving of\nL\u2019s attention. This would detract in a very substantial\nway from the relevance of U: falsity of the part detracts\nvery substantially from overall truth, and lack of pertinence in the\npart detracts very substantially from overall pertinence. So\nsubstantially, in fact, that S will almost always have\navailable to her some other utterance U* the\nprocessing of which would have yielded L more in the way of\noverall pertinent truth than U does\u2014even if we make\nallowances for motives S may have to conceal part of what she\nknows from L. If this is the case, then U will\nscarcely be optimally relevant, the most relevant stimulus\nwithin reach, since U* is more relevant\nand it\u2019s definitely within reach as well.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to suspect that this argument equivocates in its\nfinal stages. Until then, \u201cU is optimally\nrelevant\u201d appears to mean:\n\nU is the most relevant to L of the various\nactual stimuli it is in L\u2019s power to\nattend to here and now, given L\u2019s presumed\ninformational needs.\n\n\nThis is what S implicitly claims in inviting L to\nattend to her utterance. Yet in those final stages, \u201cU\nis optimally relevant\u201d needs to mean instead:\n\nU is the most relevant to L among the various\npossible stimuli it\u2019s in S\u2019s power to\noffer L here and now, given S\u2019s information\nand L\u2019s presumed informational needs.\n\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been presenting the implicature-based view of\nmetaphor Sperber and Wilson expounded in the first (1986) edition of\nRelevance, a view on which metaphor involves literally saying or\nexpressing one thing while figuratively communicating something else.\nThereafter Sperber and Wilson moved to a \u201cdirect\nexpression\u201d view of metaphor and loose talk more generally, on\nwhich they involve pragmatically induced changes in what is said,\nresulting from pragmatically induced adjustments in the properties and\nrelations the certain particular focal expressions contribute to the\ntruth conditions of an uttered sentence. In Bezuidenhout (2001),\nWilson and Sperber (2002), and Sperber and  Wilson (2008),\nmetaphor ceases to be a matter of conversational implicature and\nbecomes a matter of conversational explicature instead. This blurs the\npreviously sharp line between semantic twist and pragmatic twist\napproaches to metaphor and commits relevance theory to a form of\ntruth-conditional pragmatics. An especially full defense and\ndevelopment of this new approach comes in Robyn Carston\u2019s\n(2002).\n\nRelevance theoretic accounts of metaphor and other forms of figurative\nlanguage remain under active development. Billy Clark (2013) provides\na comprehensive overview; Scott, Clark, and Carston (2019) collects\nrecent applications.\n",
