    "main_text": "The Case for Neutral Monism || The Mind-Body Problem\n3.2 The Mind-Body Problem\n\nMach, James, and Russell agree that neutral monism solves the\nmind-body problem. Russell\u2019s account of experience (of\nperceptual consciousness) may serve as an illustration of the point.\nRussell frequently emphasized the miracle or mystery involved in\ntraditional dualist accounts of perception (1927b: 147, 154; 1927a:\n275, 400). At the end of a purely physical chain of causes there\nmysteriously arises something of a completely different nature: an\nexperience (a sensation of red, say). This raises difficult questions\nabout how exactly these two seemingly different aspects of\nreality\u2014matter and mind\u2014are related to one another and how\nthey could be causes and/or effects of each other.\n\nMaterialism holds that mind is wholly grounded in basic material\nentities or features of reality and thus that mind-body causal\nrelations are ultimately a matter of physical causal relations. But\nthere are longstanding worries about whether properties of mental\nphenomena such as qualitativity, intentionality, and/or subjectivity\ncan be wholly grounded in material entities or properties. Idealism,\nin contrast, holds that matter is wholly grounded in basic mental\nentities or features of reality and that mind-body causation is\nultimately a matter of mental causal relations. But critics question\nwhether material phenomena can be adequately accounted for wholly in\nterms of mental phenomena.\n\nNeutral monism can be an attractive alternative for those who see the\nchallenges faced by these traditional positions as\n insurmountable.[14]\n In some cases, such interest in neutral monism is, perhaps, best seen\nas part of the general movement to explore all possible options in the\nmetaphysics of mind. As Jerry Fodor puts it, \u201cthe form of a\nphilosophical theory, often enough, is: Let\u2019s try looking\nover here\u201d (Fodor 1981: 31). But others see neutral monism\nas having resources the traditional positions lack and perhaps can\nmake use of themselves.\n\nNeutral monism addresses the mind-body problem by asserting that mind\nand matter are not as different as they might first appear. On the\nboth view, this is because the basic neutral entities are\nintrinsically both mental and material. But it is difficult to see how\nsuch a view avoids collapsing into a form of panpsychism, dual-aspect\ntheory, idealism, or materialism. On the neither view, the apparent\n\u201cgap\u201d between mind and matter is narrowed by the fact that\nboth are grounded in, or merely convenient groupings of, the same\nbasic entities which are themselves intrinsically neither mental nor\nmaterial. Accordingly, mind-body causal relations are ultimately just\na matter of causal relations among different groups of the basic\nneutral\n entities.[15]\n\nOne of the chief attractions of neutral monism is its promise for\nintegrating qualitative entities or properties into the natural world\nwithout positing experientiality among its most basic constituents. In\ndoing so, it has the potential to vindicate both naturalists who hold\nthat mental phenomena such as consciousness arise only in the context\nof complex systems of elements and those who see no hope of grounding\nthe qualitative aspects of consciousness wholly in non-qualitative\nmaterial entities or properties. There is, of course, an open question\nabout whether neutral monism can deliver on such promise.\n\nMany philosophers of mind who are in some ways sympathetic to neutral\nmonism also find Russell\u2019s views that physical theories\nabstractly describe the structure of physical reality while leaving us\nignorant about its intrinsic nature especially attractive. In fact,\nthis aspect of Russell\u2019s neutral monism is the primary\ninspiration for the assortment of \u201cRussellian monist\u201d\nviews that have been hotly debated in recent years (see 5.4\nbelow).\n",
