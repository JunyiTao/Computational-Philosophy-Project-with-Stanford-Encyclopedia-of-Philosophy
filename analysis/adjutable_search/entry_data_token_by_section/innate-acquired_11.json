    "main_text": "Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates || I-properties and the clutter hypothesis\n2.4 I-properties and the clutter hypothesis\n\nAs we discussed in Section 1, for more than 150 years there has been\ndisagreement over how to define instinctive (or innate) traits in a\nway that is useful to scientific psychology. Shortly after instinct\nhad become a topic of scientific study, C.L. Morgan (1896) identified\nseven \u201cdefinitional\u201d issues surrounding this term. Two\ndecades later, criticisms by Knight Dunlap (1919) and L.L. Bernard\n(1921) reveal that those ambiguities had not been resolved. It is also\ntelling that Lorenz continued to modify his definition of innateness\nin response to critics over the course of his career, while Tinbergen\neventually abandoned this term altogether. More recently, behavioral\nbiologist Patrick Bateson has observed that, \u201c[a]t least six\nmeanings are attached to the term [innate]: present at birth; a\nbehavioral difference caused by a genetic difference; adapted over the\ncourse of evolution; unchanging throughout development; shared by all\nmembers of a species; and not learned\u201d (1991, 21). His objection\nis not merely that the term \u201cinnate\u201d is ambiguous. Like\nDunlap (1919) and Bernard (1921), his complaint is that ambiguity\npromotes equivocation, encouraging researchers to draw faulty\ninferences as they slide between different senses of innateness. For\nexample, if a trait is deemed \u201cinnate\u201d because there is\nevidence that it is present at birth, psychologists will sometimes\ninfer (without further evidence) that it is therefore\n\u201cinnate\u201d in the sense of being insensitive to\nenvironmental influence. Developmental biologists since Kuo (1921)\nhave provided evidence against this easy inference. Bateson\u2019s\nown work on the phenomenon of parental imprinting in birds (Bateson,\n1966) showed that traits which appear early in life are often highly\nsensitive to specific environmental factors. The tendency for nativism\nto promote such unwarranted inferences has been one of the main\nreasons why many scientists have called for dramatic revision or even\nan elimination of this concept from scientific discourse (see Section\n4.5 of this entry).\n\nPaul Griffiths (2002) has clarified what is ontologically at stake in\nthis objection to nativism. Researchers who draw questionable\ninferences about the properties associated with innateness are\nassuming (implicitly, if not explicitly) that innateness is a natural\nkind. More specifically, they assume that innate traits form what\nRichard Boyd (1989) called a homeostatic property cluster.\nSuch property clusters require the existence of some causal process\nthat \u201cholds together\u201d the relevant properties in a\ncoherent bundle, so to speak. For example, Weismann assumed that the\nonly way for a trait to be modified by natural selection is if it\ndevelops \u201cdirectly\u201d from germline cells. He also assumed\nthat germline cells were the only possible source of developmental\nstability since environmental factors were seen exclusively as a\nsource of developmental noise (Johnston 1995). Thus, on\nWeismann\u2019s picture, the properties of being an adaptation and\nbeing developmentally stable were a part of the same homeostatic\ncluster. It turns out that Weismann\u2019s picture of development was\ntoo narrow. The environment is much more than just a source of noise.\nCertain environmental factors are a source of developmental stability\n(West-Eberhard 2003), acting as a \u201cscaffold\u201d for the\ndevelopment of particular traits (Sterelny 2003). The environment can\nalso store information that organisms rely on during development to\ngenerate adaptive phenotypes (Mameli 2004). So, contra Weismann, there\nis no distinct causal process associated with germline cells that\naccounts for developmental stability and adaptation. Without a known\nprocess to unify the various properties associated with innateness,\nGriffiths (2002) argues, the assumption that they form a homeostatic\ncluster is unwarranted.\n\nThis position was developed in Bateson\u2019s later work with\nphilosopher Matteo Mameli (Mameli and Bateson 2006; 2011; Bateson and\nMameli 2007). Expanding on Bateson\u2019s (1991) original list, they\nidentify a total of twenty-six candidate definitions of innateness in\nthe scientific and philosophical literature (Mameli and Bateson 2006).\nMany of these proposals are deemed unsatisfactory because \u201cthey\nappeal to unclear, unexplained, or controversial notions such as\n\u2018genetic information\u2019, \u2018learning\u2019,\n\u2018developmental induction\u2019, and \u2018normal\ndevelopment\u2019\u201d (2006, 176). Other candidate definitions are\nrejected by Mameli and Bateson because they fail to pick out any trait\nwhatsoever. For instance, no trait is (strictly speaking) genetically\ndetermined or unacquired. Other candidates are rejected because they\napply to all possible traits. For example, every trait is (to some\ndegree) genetically influenced or insensitive to the environment. By\nthe end of their analysis, Mameli and Bateson arrive at a shortlist of\njust eight candidates. These \u201ci-properties\u201d (as they call\nthem) are relatively promising definitions in that they suffer from no\nobvious conceptual or empirical shortcoming. Their shortlist of\ncandidate definitions for \u201cinnate\u201d are as follows:\n\nIt appears reliably at a particular stage of the lifecycle.\nIt develops abnormally in response to environmental manipulations\nwhich were not encountered in the organism\u2019s evolutionary\nhistory.\nIt is not produced by a developmental mechanism that evolved to\ngenerate different phenotypes in response to particular environmental\nconditions (i.e., adaptive phenotypic plasticity), and it is also not\nthe result of exposure to abnormal environmental conditions.\nAny modification to the trait would have a negative impact on the\ndevelopment of other traits (the \u2018generatively\nentrenchment\u2019 of Schank and Wimsatt 1986).\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes during\ndevelopment.\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes after\ndevelopment.\nThe trait is species typical.\nThe trait is a standard Darwinian adaptation.\n\n\nMameli and Bateson maintain that it is an empirical question whether\nany of these properties cluster together. Moreover, they propose that\nin the absence of a known unifying causal process, we should not\nassume that they do cluster. Mameli (2008) has dubbed this the\n\u201cclutter hypothesis\u201d (in contrast to \u201ccluster\nhypothesis\u201d). Their work has inspired some recent philosophical\ndiscussion over which hypothesis (clutter or cluster) is best\nsupported by available evidence and theory. For instance, Nicholas\nShea (2012) argues that recent developments in evolutionary and\ndevelopmental biology suggest that i-properties do not cluster. In\ncontrast, Muhammad Ali Khalidi (2016) argues that innateness\nproperties do cluster provided that we focus strictly on\npsychology and not biology (assuming that such a distinction can be\ndrawn). This question remains an important area for future\nresearch.\n\nAlthough the clutter hypothesis captures what is ontologically at\nstake in debates over nativism, it does not explain why the associated\nconceptual confusion has been so difficult to resolve. Admittedly,\nambiguities are by no means unknown to science (Cowie 2009; Samuels\n2007). However, the tenacity of nativism debates in psychology seems\nunusual. One might reasonably expect that psychologists would have, by\nnow, disambiguated this concept and developed experimental criteria\nfor detecting specific i-properties. Such questions as whether a trait\nis present at birth, a functional adaptation, developmentally\nsensitive to some environmental factor, and so on should be regarded\nby psychologists as independent research hypotheses (Griffiths 2002).\nOn the contrary, there is a stubborn tendency to conflate these issues\nby simply asking whether some trait is \u201cinnate.\u201d Even\namong researchers who acknowledge on the one hand that\n\u201cinnate\u201d is a multiply ambiguous term will, in other\ncontexts, slide between different i-properties apparently without\nrealizing it (Linquist et al. 2011). Such observations have prompted a\nnumber of recent questionnaire experiments, conducted largely by\nphilosophers, analyzing the \u201cfolk\u201d concept of innateness\nand comparing it to scientific conceptions.\n",
