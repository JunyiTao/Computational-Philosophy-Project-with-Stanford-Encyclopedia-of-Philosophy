    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Did Wigner Define the Particle Concept?\n5.2 Did Wigner Define the Particle Concept?\n\n\nWigner\u2019s (1939) famous analysis of the Poincar\u00e9 group is often\nassumed to provide a definition of elementary particles. The main\nidea of Wigner\u2019s approach is the supposition that each irreducible\n(projective) representation of the relevant space-time symmetry group\nyields the state space of one kind of elementary physical system,\nwhere the prime example is an elementary particle which has the more\nrestrictive property of being structureless. The physical\njustification for linking up irreducible representations with\nelementary systems is the requirement that \u201cthere must be no\nrelativistically invariant distinction between the various states of\nthe system\u201d (Newton & Wigner 1949). In other words the\nstate space of an elementary system shall have no internal structure\nwith respect to relativistic transformations. Put more technically,\nthe state space of an elementary system must not contain any\nrelativistically invariant subspaces, i.e., it must be the state space\nof an irreducible representation of the relevant invariance group. If\nthe state space of an elementary system had relativistically invariant\nsubspaces then it would be appropriate to associate these subspaces\nwith elementary systems. The requirement that a state space has to be\nrelativistically invariant means that starting from any of its states\nit must be possible to get to all the other states by superposition of\nthose states which result from relativistic transformations of the\nstate one started with. The main part of Wigner\u2019s analysis consists\nin finding and classifying all the irreducible representations of the\nPoincar\u00e9 group. Doing that involves finding relativistically\ninvariant quantities that serve to classify the irreducible\nrepresentations. Wigner\u2019s pioneering identification of types of\nparticles with irreducible unitary representations of the\nPoincar\u00e9 group has been exemplary until the present, as it is\nemphasized, e.g., in Buchholz (1994). For an alternative perspective\nfocusing on \u201cWigner\u2019s legacy\u201d for ontic structural realism\nsee Roberts (2011).\n\n\nRegarding the question whether Wigner has supplied a definition of\nparticles, one must say that although Wigner has in fact found a\nhighly valuable and fruitful classification of particles, his\nanalysis does not contribute very much to the question what a particle\nis and whether a given theory can be interpreted in terms of\nparticles. What Wigner has given is rather a conditional\nanswer. If relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted\nin terms of particles then the possible types of particles\nand their invariant properties can be determined via an analysis of\nthe irreducible unitary representations of the Poincar\u00e9\ngroup. However, the question whether, and if yes in what sense, at\nleast relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a particle\ntheory at all is not addressed in Wigner\u2019s analysis. For this reason\nthe discussion of the particle interpretation of QFT is not finished\nwith Wigner\u2019s analysis as one might be tempted to say. For instance,\nthe pivotal question of the localizability of particle states, to be\ndiscussed below, is still open. Moreover, once interactions are\nincluded, Wigner\u2019s classification is no longer applicable (see Bain\n2000). Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.1.2) offers an accessible introduction\nto Wigner\u2019s analysis and discusses its interpretive relevance.\n",
