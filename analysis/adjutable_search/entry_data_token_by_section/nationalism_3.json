    "main_text": "Varieties of Nationalism || Moral Claims, Classical Vs. Liberal: The Centrality of Nation\n2.2 Moral Claims, Classical Vs. Liberal: The Centrality of Nation\n\nWe now pass to the normative dimension of nationalism. We shall first\ndescribe the very heart of the nationalist program, i.e., sketch and\nclassify the typical normative and evaluative nationalist claims.\nThese claims can be seen as answers to the normative subset of our\ninitial questions about (1) pro-national attitudes and (2)\nactions.\n\nWe will see that these claims recommend various courses of action:\ncentrally, those meant to secure and sustain a political organization\nfor the given ethno-cultural national community (thereby making more\nspecific the answers to our normative questions\n (1e),\n (1f),\n (2b),\n and\n (2c)).\n Further, they enjoin the community\u2019s members to promulgate\nrecognizable ethno-cultural contents as central features of the\ncultural life within such a state. Finally, we shall discuss various\nlines of pro-nationalist thought that have been put forward in defense\nof these claims. To begin, let us return to the claims concerning the\nfurthering of the national state and culture. These are proposed by\nthe nationalist as norms of conduct. The philosophically most\nimportant variations concern three aspects of such normative\nclaims:\n\nThe normative nature and strength of the claim: does it promote\nmerely a right (say, to have and maintain a form of political\nself-government, preferably and typically a state, or have cultural\nlife centered upon a recognizably ethno-national culture), or a moral\nobligation (to get and maintain one), or a moral, legal, and political\nobligation? The strongest claim is typical of classical nationalism;\nits typical norms are both moral and, once the nation-state is in\nplace, legally enforceable obligations for all parties concerned,\nincluding for the individual members of the ethno-nation. A weaker but\nstill quite demanding version speaks only of moral obligation\n(\u201csacred duty\u201d). \nThe strength of the nationalist claim in relation to various\nexternal interests and rights: to give a real example, is the use of\nthe domestic language so important that even international conferences\nshould be held in it, at the cost of losing the most interesting\nparticipants from abroad? The force of the nationalist claim is here\nbeing weighed against the force of other claims, including those of\nindividual or group interests or rights. Variations in comparative\nstrength of nationalist claims take place on a continuum between two\nextremes. At one rather unpalatable extreme, nation-focused claims\ntake precedence over any other claims, including over human rights.\nFurther towards the center is the classical nationalism that gives\nnation-centered claims precedence over individual interests and many\nneeds, but not necessarily over general human rights (see, for\nexample, MacIntyre 1994, Oldenquist 1997). On the opposite end, which\nis mild, humane, and liberal, the central classical nationalist claims\nare accorded prima facie status only (see Tamir 1993, Gans\n2003, and Miller 2013; and for applications to Central Europe Stefan\nAuer 2004).\n For which groups are the nationalist claims, classical or\nliberal, meant to be valid? What is their scope? One approach claims\nthat they are valid for every ethno-nation and thereby universal. An\nexample would be the claim \u201cevery ethno-nation should have its\nown state\u201d. To put it more officially\n\n\n\nUniversalizing nationalism is the political program that\nclaims that every ethno-nation should have a state that it\nshould rightfully own and the interests of which it should\npromote.\n\n\nAlternatively, a claim may be particularistic, such as the claim\n\u201cGroup X ought to have a state\u201d, where this\nimplies nothing about any other group:\n\n\nParticularistic nationalism is the political program claiming\nthat some ethno-nation should have its state, without\nextending the claim to all ethno-nations. It claims thus either\n\nby omission (unreflective particularistic nationalism), or\nby explicitly specifying who is excluded: \u201cGroup X\nought to have a state, but group Y should not\u201d\n(invidious nationalism).\n\n\n\nThe most difficult and indeed chauvinistic sub-case of particularism,\ni.e., (B), has been called \u201cinvidious\u201d since it explicitly\ndenies the privilege of having a state to some peoples. Serious\ntheoretical nationalists usually defend only the universalist variety,\nwhereas the nationalist-in-the-street most often defends the egoistic\nindeterminate one. \n\n\nThe nationalist picture of morality traditionally has been quite close\nto the dominant view in the theory of international relations called\n\u201crealism\u201d. Put starkly, the view is that morality ends at\nthe boundaries of the nation-state; beyond there is nothing but\n anarchy.[16]\n It nicely complements the main classical nationalist claim about the\nnation-state, i.e., that each ethno-nation or people should have a\nstate of its own, and suggests what happens next: nation-states enter\ninto competition in the name of their constitutive peoples.\n",
