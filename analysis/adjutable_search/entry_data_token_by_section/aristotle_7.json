    "main_text": "Essentialism and Homonymy\n5. Essentialism and Homonymy\n\n           \nHowever we arrive at secure principles in philosophy and science,\nwhether by some process leading to a rational grasping of necessary\ntruths, or by sustained dialectical investigation operating over\njudiciously selected endoxa, it does turn out, according to\nAristotle, that we can uncover and come to know genuinely necessary\nfeatures of reality. Such features, suggests Aristotle, are those\ncaptured in the essence-specifying definitions used in science (again\nin the broad sense of epist\u00eam\u00ea). \n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s commitment to essentialism runs deep.   He\nrelies upon a host of loosely related locutions when discussing the\nessences of things, and these give some clue to his general\norientation. Among the locutions one finds rendered as\nessence in contemporary translations of Aristotle into English\nare: (i) to ti esti (the what it is); (ii) to einai\n(being); (iii) ousia (being); (iv) hoper esti (precisely\nwhat something is) and, most importantly, (v) to ti \u00ean\neinai (the what it was to be) (APo 83a7; Top.\n141b35; Phys. 190a17, 201a18\u201321; Gen. et Corr. 319b4;\nDA 424a25, 429b10; Met. 1003b24, 1006a32, 1006b13;\nEN 1102a30, 1130a12\u201313). Among these, the last locution\n(v) requires explication both because it is the most peculiar and\nbecause it is Aristotle\u2019s favored technical term for\nessence. It is an abbreviated way of saying \u2018that which it\nwas for an instance of kind K to be an instance of kind\nK,\u2019 for instance \u2018that which it was (all along)\nfor a human being to be a human being\u2019. In speaking this\nway, Aristotle supposes that if we wish to know what a human being is,\nwe cannot identify transient or non-universal features of that kind;\nnor indeed can we identify even universal features which do not run\nexplanatorily deep. Rather, as his preferred locution indicates,\nhe is interested in what makes a human being human\u2014and he\nassumes, first, that there is some feature F which all and only humans\nhave in common and, second, that F explains the other features which we\nfind across the range of humans. \n\n\n           \nImportantly, this second feature of Aristotelian essentialism\ndifferentiates his approach from the now more common modal approach,\naccording to\n which:[8]\n\nF is an essential property of\nx =df if x loses F,\nthen x ceases to exist.\n\n\n\n\nAristotle rejects this approach for several reasons, including most\nnotably that he thinks that certain non-essential features satisfy the\ndefinition. Thus, beyond the categorical and logical features\n(everyone is such as to be either identical or not identical with the\nnumber nine), Aristotle recognizes a category of properties which he\ncalls idia (Cat. 3a21, 4a10; Top. 102a18\u201330,\n134a5\u2013135b6), now usually known by their Medieval Latin rendering\npropria. Propria are non-essential properties which flow\nfrom the essence of a kind, such that they are necessary to that kind\neven without being essential. For instance, if we suppose that\nbeing rational is essential to human beings, then it will\nfollow that every human being is capable of grammar. \nBeing capable of grammar is not the same property as being rational,\nthough it follows from it. Aristotle assumes his readers will\nappreciate that being rational asymmetrically explains\nbeing capable of grammar, even though, necessarily, something\nis rational if and only if it is also capable of grammar. Thus,\nbecause it is explanatorily prior, being rational has a better\nclaim to being the essence of human beings than does being capable\nof grammar.   Consequently, Aristotle\u2019s\nessentialism is more fine-grained than mere modal essentialism. \nAristotelian essentialism holds:\n\nF is an essential property of x =df (i) if\nx loses F, then x ceases to exist; and\n(ii) F is in an objective sense an explanatorily basic\nfeature of x.\n\n\n\n\n In sum, in Aristotle\u2019s approach, what it is to be, for\ninstance, a human being is just what it always has been and always will\nbe, namely being rational.   Accordingly, this is\nthe feature to be captured in an essence-specifying account of human\nbeings (APo 75a42\u2013b2; Met. 103b1\u20132, 1041a25\u201332).\n\n\n           \nAristotle believes for a broad range of cases that kinds have essences\ndiscoverable by diligent research. He in fact does not devote\nmuch energy to arguing for this contention; still less is he inclined\nto expend energy combating anti-realist challenges to essentialism,\nperhaps in part because he is impressed by the deep regularities he\nfinds, or thinks he finds, underwriting his results in biological\n investigation.[9] \n Still, he cannot be accused of profligacy regarding the prospects\nof essentialism. \n\n\nOn the contrary, he denies essentialism in many cases where others\nare prepared to embrace it. One finds this sort of denial\nprominently, though not exclusively, in his criticism of Plato. \nIndeed, it becomes a signature criticism of Plato and Platonists for\nAristotle that many of their preferred examples of sameness and\ninvariance in the world are actually cases of multivocity, or\nhomonymy in his technical terminology. In the opening of the\nCategories, Aristotle distinguishes between synonymy\nand homonymy  (later called univocity and\nmultivocity). His preferred phrase for multivocity,\nwhich is extremely common in his writings, is  \u2018being spoken\nof in many ways\u2019, or, more simply, \u2018multiply meant\u2019\n(pollach\u00f4s legomenon). All these locutions have a\nquasi-technical status for him. The least complex is\nunivocity:\n\na and b are univocally F iff (i)\na is F, (ii) b is F, and (iii) the\naccounts of\nF-ness in \u2018a is F\u2019 and\n\u2018b is F\u2019 are the same.\n\n\n\n\nThus, for instance, since the accounts of \u2018human\u2019 in\n\u2018Socrates is human\u2019 and \u2018Plato is human\u2019 will\nbe the same, \u2018human\u2019 is univocal or synonymous in these\napplications. (Note that Aristotle\u2019s notion of the word \u2018synonymy\u2019 is\nnot the same as the contemporary English usage where it applies to\ndifferent words with the same meaning.)  In cases of\nunivocity, we expect single, non-disjunctive definitions which capture\nand state the essence of the kinds in question. Let us allow once\nmore for purposes of illustration that the essence-specifying\ndefinition of human is rational animal. Then,\nsince human means rational animal across the range of\nits applications, there is some single essence to all members of the\nkind.\n\n\n           \nBy contrast, when synonymy fails we have homonymy. According to\nAristotle:\n\na and b are homonymously F iff (i)\na is F, (ii) b is F, (iii) the\naccounts of F-ness in \u2018a is F\u2019\nand \u2018b is F\u2019 do not completely\noverlap.\n\n\n\n\nTo take an easy example without philosophical significance,\nbank is homonymous in \u2018Socrates and Alcibiades had a\npicnic on the bank\u2019 and \u2018Socrates and Alcibiades opened a\njoint account at the bank.\u2019  This case is illustrative, if\nuninteresting, because the accounts of bank in these\noccurrences have nothing whatsoever in common. Part of the philosophical \ninterest in Aristotle\u2019s account of homonymy resides in its\nallowing partial overlap. Matters become more interesting if we\nexamine whether\u2014to use an illustration well suited to\nAristotle\u2019s purposes but left largely unexplored by\nhim\u2014conscious is synonymous across \u2018Charlene was\nconscious of some awkwardness created by her remarks\u2019 and\n\u2018Higher vertebrates, unlike mollusks, are conscious.\u2019 \nIn these instances, the situation with respect to synonymy or homonymy\nis perhaps not immediately clear, and so requires reflection and\nphilosophical investigation. \n\n\n           \nVery regularly, according to Aristotle, this sort of reflection leads\nto an interesting discovery, namely that we have been presuming a\nunivocal account where in fact none is forthcoming. This,\naccording to Aristotle, is where the Platonists go wrong: they presume\nunivocity where the world delivers homonymy or multivocity. (For\na vivid illustration of Plato\u2019s univocity assumption at work, see\nMeno 71e1\u201372a5, where Socrates insists that there is but one\nkind of excellence (aret\u00ea) common to all kinds\nof excellent people, not a separate sort for men, women, slaves,\nchildren, and so on.)  In one especially important example,\nAristotle parts company with Plato over the univocity of goodness:\n\n\nWe had perhaps better consider the universal good and run through\nthe puzzles concerning what is meant by it\u2014even though this sort\nof investigation is unwelcome to us, because those who introduced the\nForms are friends of ours. Yet presumably it would be the better\ncourse to destroy even what is close to us, as something necessary for\npreserving the truth\u2014and all the more so, given that we are\nphilosophers. For though we love them both, piety bids us to\nhonour the truth before our friends. (EN\n1096a11\u201316)  \n\n\nAristotle counters that Plato is wrong to assume that goodness is\n\u2018something universal, common to all good things, and\nsingle\u2019 (EN 1096a28). Rather, goodness is different in\ndifferent cases. If he is right about this, far-reaching consequences\nregarding ethical theory and practice follow.\n\n\n           \nTo establish non-univocity, Aristotle\u2019s appeals to a variety of\ntests in his Topics where, again, his idiom is linguistic but\nhis quarry is metaphysical. Consider the following sentences:\n\nSocrates is good.\nCommunism is good.\nAfter a light meal, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is good.\nRedoubling one\u2019s effort after failure is always good.\nMaria\u2019s singing is good, but Renata\u2019s is sublime.\n\n\n\nAmong the tests for non-univocity recommended in the Topics\nis a simple paraphrase test: if paraphrases yield distinct,\nnon-interchangeable accounts, then the predicate is\nmultivocal.   So, for example, suitable paraphrases might\nbe:\n\nSocrates is a virtuous\nperson.\nCommunism is a just social\nsystem.\nAfter a light meal,\ncr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is tasty and satisfying.\nTrying harder after one has\nfailed is always edifying.\nMaria\u2019s singing\nreaches a high artistic standard, but Renata\u2019s\nsurpasses that standard by any measure.\n\n\n\nSince we cannot interchange these paraphrases\u2014we cannot say,\nfor instance, that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a just social\nsystem\u2014good must be non-univocal across this range of\napplications. If that is correct, then Platonists are wrong to\nassume univocity in this case, since goodness exhibits complexity\nignored by their assumption.\n\n\n           \nSo far, then, Aristotle\u2019s appeals to homonymy or multivocity are\nprimarily destructive, in the sense that they attempt to undermine a\nPlatonic presumption regarded by Aristotle as unsustainable. \nImportantly, just as Aristotle sees a positive as well as a negative\nrole for dialectic in philosophy, so he envisages in addition to its\ndestructive applications a philosophically constructive role for\nhomonymy. To appreciate his basic idea, it serves to reflect upon a\ncontinuum of positions in philosophical analysis ranging from pure\nPlatonic univocity to disaggregated Wittgensteinean family\nresemblance. One might in the face of a successful challenge to\nPlatonic univocity assume that, for instance, the various cases of\ngoodness have nothing in common across all cases, so that good things\nform at best a motley kind, of the sort championed by Wittgensteineans\nenamored of the metaphor of family resemblances: all good things belong\nto a kind only in the limited sense that they manifest a tapestry of\npartially overlapping properties, as every member of a single family is\nunmistakably a member of that family even though there is no one\nphysical attribute shared by all of those family members. \n\n\n           \nAristotle insists that there is a tertium quid between family\nresemblance and pure univocity: he identifies, and trumpets, a kind of\ncore-dependent homonymy (also referred to in the literature,\nwith varying degrees of accuracy, as focal meaning and\nfocal\n connexion).[10] \n Core-dependent homonyms exhibit a kind\nof order in multiplicity: although shy of univocity, because\nhomonymous, such concepts do not devolve into patchwork family\nresemblances either. To rely upon one of Aristotle\u2019s own\nfavorite illustrations, consider:\n\nSocrates is healthy.\nSocrates\u2019 exercise regimen is healthy.\nSocrates\u2019 complexion is healthy.\n\n\n\nAristotle assumes that his readers will immediately appreciate two\nfeatures of these three predications of healthy. First,\nthey are non-univocal, since the second is paraphraseable roughly as\npromotes health and the third as is indicative of\nhealth, whereas the first means, rather, something more\nfundamental, like is sound of body or is functioning\nwell. Hence, healthy is non-univocal. Second,\neven so, the last two predications rely upon the first for their\nelucidations: each appeals to health in its core sense in an\nasymmetrical way. That is, any account of each of the latter two\npredications must allude to the first, whereas an account of\nthe first makes no reference to the second or third in its\naccount. So, suggests Aristotle, health is not only a\nhomonym, but a core-dependent homonym: while not univocal\nneither is it a case of rank multivocity. \n\n\n           \nAristotle\u2019s illustration does succeed in showing that there is\nconceptual space between mere family resemblance and pure\nunivocity. So, he is right that these are not exhaustive\noptions. The interest in this sort of result resides in its\nexportability to richer, if more abstract philosophical concepts. \nAristotle appeals to homonymy frequently, across a full range of\nphilosophical concepts including justice, causation,\nlove, life, sameness, goodness, and\nbody. His most celebrated appeal to core-dependent homonymy\ncomes in the case of a concept so highly abstract that it is difficult\nto gauge his success without extended metaphysical reflection. This is\nhis appeal to the core-dependent homonymy of being, which has\ninspired both philosophical and scholarly\ncontroversy.[11]\nAristotle denies that there could be a science of being, on the\ngrounds that there is no single genus being under which all\nand only beings fall (SE 11\n172a13\u201315\u201315; APr. 92b14; Met. B 3,\n998b22; EE i 8, 1217b33\u201335). One motivation for his\nreasoning this way may be that he regards the notion of a genus as\n ineliminably taxonomical and contrastive,[12] \n so that it makes ready sense to speak of\na genus of being only if one can equally well speak of a genus of\nnon-being\u2014just as among living beings one can speak of the\nanimals and the non-animals, viz. the plant kingdom. Since there are\nno non-beings, there accordingly can be no genus of non-being, and so,\nultimately, no genus of being either.  Consequently, since each\nscience studies one essential kind arrayed under a single genus, there\ncan be no science of being either.\n\n\n           \nSubsequently, without expressly reversing his judgment about the\nexistence of a science of being, Aristotle announces that there is\nnonetheless a science of being qua being (Met. iv 4),\nfirst philosophy, which takes as its subject matter beings insofar as\nthey are beings and thus considers all and only those features\npertaining to beings as such\u2014to beings, that is, not insofar as\nthey are mathematical or physical or human beings, but insofar as they\nare beings, full stop. Although the matter is disputed, his\nrecognition of this science evidently turns crucially on his commitment\nto the core-dependent homonymy of being\n itself.[13] \n Although the case is not\nas clear and uncontroversial as Aristotle\u2019s relatively easy\nappeal to health (which is why, after all, he selected it as\nan illustration), we are supposed to be able upon reflection to detect\nan analogous core-dependence in the following instances of\nexists:\n\nSocrates exists.\nSocrates\u2019 location exists.\nSocrates\u2019 weighing 73 kilos exists.\nSocrates\u2019 being morose today exists.\n\n\n\nOf course, the last three items on this list are rather awkward\nlocutions, but this is because they strive to make explicit that we can\nspeak of dependent beings as existing if we wish to do so\u2014but\nonly because of their dependence upon the core instance of being,\nnamely substance. (Here it is noteworthy that \u2018primary\nsubstance\u2019 is the conventional and not very happy rendering of\nAristotle\u2019s prot\u00ea ousia in Greek, which\nmeans, more literally, \u2018primary\n being\u2019).[14] \n According to this\napproach, we would not have Socrates\u2019 weighing anything at all or\nfeeling any way today were it not for the prior fact of his\nexistence. So, exists in the first instance serves as\nthe core instance of being, in terms of which the others are to be\nexplicated. If this is correct, then, implies Aristotle,\nbeing is a core-dependent homonym; further, a science of\nbeing\u2014or, rather, a science of being qua\nbeing\u2014becomes possible, even though there is no genus of being,\nsince it is finally possible to study all beings insofar as they are\nrelated to the core instance of being, and then also to study that\ncore instance, namely substance, insofar as it serves as the prime\noccasion of being.\n",
