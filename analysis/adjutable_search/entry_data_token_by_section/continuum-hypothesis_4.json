    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || \u2119max\n3.1 \u2119max\nThe goal is to find a model in which CH is false and which is\ncanonical in the sense that its theory cannot be altered by set\nforcing in the presence of large cardinals. The background motivation\nis this: First, we know that in the presence of large cardinal axioms\nthe theory of second-order arithmetic and even the entire theory of\nL(\u211d) is invariant under set forcing. The importance of this is\nthat it demonstrates that our main independence techniques cannot be\nused to establish the independence of questions about second-order\narithmetic (or about L(\u211d)) in the presence of large\ncardinals. Second, experience has shown that the large cardinal axioms\nin question seem to answer all of the major known open problems about\nsecond-order arithmetic and L(\u211d) and the set forcing invariance\ntheorems give precise content to the claim that these axioms are\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d.[5]\n\n It follows that if \u2119 is any homogeneous partial order in\nL(\u211d) then the generic extension L(\u211d)\u2119\ninherits the generic absoluteness of L(\u211d). Woodin discovered\nthat there is a very special partial order\n\u2119max that has this feature. Moreover, the\nmodel L(\u211d)\u2119max satisfies ZFC +\n\u00acCH. The key feature of this model is that it is\n\u201cmaximal\u201d (or \u201csaturated\u201d) with respect to\nsentences that are of a certain complexity and which can be shown to\nbe consistent via set forcing over the model; in other words, if these\nsentences can hold (by set forcing over the model)\nthen they do hold in the model. To state this more precisely\nwe are going to have to introduce a few rather technical notions. \n There are two ways of stratifying the universe of sets. The first\nis in terms of \u27e8V\u03b1 | \u03b1\n\u2208 On \u27e9, the second is in terms of\n\u27e8H(\u03ba) | \u03ba \u2208 Card\u27e9, where H(\u03ba) is the set\nof all sets which have cardinality less than \u03ba and whose members\nhave cardinality less than \u03ba, and whose members of members have\ncardinality less than \u03ba, and so on. For example, H(\u03c9)\n= V\u03c9 and the theories of the structures\nH(\u03c91) and V\u03c9+1 are mutually\ninterpretable. This latter structure is the structure of second-order\narithmetic and, as mentioned above, large cardinal axioms give us an\n\u201ceffectively complete\u201d understanding of this structure. We\nshould like to be in the same position with regard to larger and\nlarger fragments of the universe and the question is whether we should\nproceed in terms of the first or the second stratification. \n The second stratification is potentially more\nfine-grained. Assuming CH one has that the theories of\nH(\u03c92) and V\u03c9+2 are mutually\ninterpretable and assuming larger and larger fragments of GCH this\ncorrespondence continues upward. But if CH is false then the structure\nH(\u03c92) is less rich than the\nstructure V\u03c92. In this event the latter\nstructure captures full third-order arithmetic, while the former\ncaptures only a small fragment of third-order arithmetic but is\nnevertheless rich enough to express CH. Given this, in attempting to\nunderstand the universe of sets by working up through it level by\nlevel, it is sensible to use the potentially more fine-grained\nstratification. \n Our next step is therefore to understand\nH(\u03c92). It actually turns out that we will be able to\nunderstand slightly more and this is somewhat technical. We will be\nconcerned with the structure \n\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, AG\u27e9\n\u22a7 \u03c6, where INS is the non-stationary ideal\non \u03c91 and AG is the\ninterpretation of (the canonical representation of) a set of\nreals A in L(\u211d). The details will not be important and\nthe reader is asked to just think of H(\u03c92) along with\nsome \u201cextra stuff\u201d and not worry about the details\nconcerning the extra stuff.[6]\n\n We are now in a position to state the main result: \n\nTheorem 3.1\n(Woodin 1999). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that\nA \u2208 P (\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d) and \u03c6 is a\n\u03a02-sentence (in the extended\nlanguage with two additional predicates ) and there\nis a set forcing extension V[G] such that\n\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, AG\u27e9\n\u22a7 \u03c6\n (where AG is the\ninterpretation of A in V\n[G]). Then\nL(\u211d)\u2119max \u22a7 \n\u201c\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A\u27e9\n\u22a7 \u03c6\u201d.\nThere are two key points: First, the theory of\nL(\u211d)\u2119max is \u201ceffectively\ncomplete\u201d in the sense that it is invariant under set\nforcing. Second, the model L(\u211d)\u2119max\nis \u201cmaximal\u201d (or \u201csaturated\u201d) in the sense\nthat it satisfies all \u03a02-sentences (about the relevant\nstructure) that can possibly hold (in the sense that they can be shown\nto be consistent by set forcing over the model). \n One would like to get a handle on the theory of this structure by\naxiomatizing it. The relevant axiom is the following: \n\nDefinition 3.2 (Woodin 1999).  Axiom\n(\u2217): ADL(\u211d) holds and\nL(P(\u03c91)) is a \u2119max-generic\nextension of L(\u211d). \n Finally, this axiom settles CH: \n\nTheorem 3.3\n(Woodin 1999). Assume\n(\u2217). Then 2\u03c9 =\n\u21352. \n",
