Understanding Creationism in its Cultural Context\n\nBefore moving on historically, it is worthwhile to stop for a moment\nand consider aspects of Creationism, in what one might term the\ncultural context. First, as a populist movement, driven as much by\nsocial factors \u2013 a sense of alienation from the modern world\n\u2014 one would expect to find that cultural changes in society\nwould be reflected in Creationist beliefs. This is indeed so. Take,\nabove all, the question of racial issues and relationships. In the\nmiddle of the nineteenth century in the South, biblical literalism was\nvery popular because it was thought to justify slavery (Noll 2002).\nEven though one can read the Christian message as being strongly\nagainst slavery \u2014 the Sermon on the Mount hardly recommends\nmaking people into the property of others \u2013 the Bible elsewhere\nseems to endorse slavery. Remember, when the escaped slave came to\nSaint Paul, the apostle told him to return to his master and to obey\nhim. Remnants of this kind of thinking persisted in Creationist\ncircles well into the twentieth century. Price, for instance, was\nquite convinced that blacks are degenerate whites. By the time of\nGenesis Flood, however, the civil rights movement was in full\nflower, and Whitcomb and Morris trod very carefully. They explained in\ndetail that the Bible gives no justification for treating blacks as\ninferior. The story of the son and grandson of Noah being banished to\na dark-skinned future was not part of their reading of the Holy\nScriptures. Literalism may be the unvarnished word of God, but\nliteralism is as open to interpretation as scholarly readings of Plato\nor Aristotle. That is why many refer to Creationists as\n\u201cinerrantists\u201d rather than \u201cliteralists.\u201d\n\nSecond, as noted above, both for internal and external reasons,\nCreationists realized that they needed to tread carefully in outright\nopposition to evolution of all kinds. Could it really be that Noah\u2019s\nArk carried all of the animals that we find on earth today? It would\nbe much easier if the Ark carried only the basic \u201ckinds\u201d\nof Creation, and then after the Flood the animals dispersed and\ndiversified. We find in fact then that although Creationists were (and\nare) adamantly opposed to unified common descent and to the idea of\nnatural change being adequate for all the forms we see today, from\nearly on they were accepting huge amounts of what can only truly be\ncalled evolution! This said, Creationists were convinced that this\nchange occurs much more rapidly than most conventional evolutionists\nwould allow. Although it took some time to formulate, gradually we see\nemerging the strategy of (what we have seen as) distinguishing between\nwhat is called \u201cmicroevolution\u201d and\n\u201cmacroevolution.\u201d Supposedly, microevolution is the sort\nof thing that brought diversification to Darwin\u2019s finches, and many\nCreationists \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that it is supposedly a\ntautology \u2013 are even prepared to put this down to natural\nselection. Macroevolution is what makes reptiles reptiles, and mammals\nmammals. This cannot be a natural process but required miracles during\nthe days of Creation. Although he was a lifelong opponent of\nCreationism (see below), forever committed to common descent, and\nthought that all changes must be natural, Creationists seized with\nglee on paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s claims that microevolution\nmust be selection-fueled and macroevolution might require other causal\nforces (Gould 1980).\n\nThird, and perhaps most significant of all, never think that\nCreationism is purely an epistemological matter \u2013 a matter of\nfacts and their understanding. Moral claims have always been\nabsolutely fundamental. Nearly all Creationists (in the Christian\ncamp) are what is known theologically as premillennialists, believing\nthat Jesus will come soon and reign over the world before the Last\nJudgement. They are opposed to postmillennialists who think that Jesus\nwill come later, and amillennialists who are inclined to think that\nperhaps we are already living in a Jesus-dominated era.\nPostmillennialists put a premium on our getting things ready for Jesus\n\u2013 hence, we should engage in social action and the like.\nPremillennialists think there is nothing we ourselves can do to better\nthe world, so we had best get ourselves and others in a state ready\nfor Jesus. This means individual behavior and conversion of others.\nFor premillennialists therefore, and this includes almost all\nCreationists, the great moral drives are to things like family\nsanctity (which today encompasses anti-abortion), sexual orthodoxy\n(especially anti-homosexuality), biblically sanctioned punishments\n(very pro-capital punishment), strong support for Israel (because of\nclaims in Revelation about the Jews returning to Israel before End\nTimes), and so forth. It is absolutely vital to see how this moral\nagenda is an integral part of American Creationism, as much as Floods\nand Arks. (Ruse 2005 discusses these matters in much detail.)\n",
