    "main_text": "Sequential decisions || Was Ulysses rational?\n6.1 Was Ulysses rational? \n\nA well-known sequential decision problem is the one facing Ulysses on\nhis journey home to Ithaca in Homer\u2019s great tale from antiquity.\nUlysses must make a choice about the manner in which he will sail past\nan island inhabited by sweet-singing sirens. He can choose to sail\nunrestrained or else tied to the mast. In the former case, Ulysses\nwill later have the choice, upon hearing the sirens, to either\ncontinue sailing home to Ithaca or to stay on the island indefinitely.\nIn the latter case, he will not be free to make further choices and\nthe ship will sail onwards to Ithaca past the sweet-singing sirens.\nThe final outcome depends on what sequence of choices Ulysses makes.\nUlysses\u2019 decision problem is represented in tree (or extensive)\nform in\n Figure 1\n (where the two boxes represent choice points for Ulysses).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Ulysses\u2019 decision\nproblem\n\n\nWe are told that, before embarking, Ulysses would most prefer to\nfreely hear the sirens and return home to Ithaca. The problem is that\nUlysses predicts his future self will not comply: if he sails\nunrestrained, he will later be seduced by the sirens and will not in\nfact continue home to Ithaca but will rather remain on the island\nindefinitely. Ulysses therefore reasons that it would be better to be\ntied to the mast, because he would prefer the shame and discomfort of\nbeing tied to the mast and making it home to remaining on the\nsirens\u2019 island forever.\n\nIt is hard to deny that Ulysses makes a wise choice in being tied to\nthe mast. Some hold, however, that Ulysses is nevertheless not an\nexemplary agent, since his present self must play against his future\nself who will be unwittingly seduced by the sirens. While Ulysses is\nrational at the first choice node by static decision\nstandards, we might regard him irrational overall by\nsequential decision standards, understood in terms of the relative\nvalue of sequences of choices. The sequence of choices that Ulysses\ninevitably pursues is, after all, suboptimal. It would have been\nbetter were he able to sail unconstrained and continue on home to\nIthaca. This sequence could have been achieved if Ulysses were\ncontinuously rational over the extended time period; say, if\nat all times he were to act as an EU maximiser, and change his beliefs\nand desires only in accordance with Bayesian norms (variants of\nstandard conditionalisation). On this reading, sequential\ndecision models introduce considerations of rationality-over-time.\n\nWhile rationality-over-time may have import in assessing an\nagent\u2019s preferences and norms for changing these preferences\n(one can read the discussion in\n Section 6.2\n below in this way), there remains the important question of how an\nagent should act in light of her preferences at any given point in\ntime. To this end, the sequential decision model can be\nfruitfully viewed as a tool for helping determine rational choice at a\nparticular time, just like the static decision model. The sequential\ndecision tree is effectively a way of visualising the temporal series\nof choices and learning events that an agent believes she\nwill confront in the future, depending on what part of the decision\ntree she will find herself. The key question, then, is: How should an\nagent choose amongst her initial options in light of her projected\ndecision tree? This question has generated a surprising amount of\ncontroversy. Three major approaches to negotiating sequential decision\ntrees have appeared in the literature. These are the\nna\u00efve or myopic approach, the\nsophisticated approach and the resolute approach.\nThese will be discussed in turn; it will be suggested that the\ndisputes may not be substantial but rather indicate subtle differences\nin the interpretation of sequential decision models.\n\nThe so-called na\u00efve approach to negotiating sequential decisions\nserves as a useful contrast to the other two approaches. The\nna\u00efve agent assumes that any path through the decision tree is\npossible, and so sets off on whichever path is optimal, given his/her\npresent attitudes. For instance, a na\u00efve Ulysses would simply\npresume that he has three overall strategies to choose from: either\nordering the crew to tie him to the mast, or issuing no such order and\nlater stopping at the sirens\u2019 island, or issuing no such order\nand later sticking to his course. Ulysses prefers the outcome\nassociated with the latter combination, and so he initiates this\nstrategy by not ordering the crew to restrain him. Table 5 presents\nthe static counterpart of na\u00efve Ulysses\u2019 decision problem.\nIn effect, this decision model does not take into account\nUlysses\u2019 present knowledge of his future preferences, and hence\nadvises that he pursue an option that is predicted to be\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nAct\nOutcome\n\norder tying to mast\nreach home, some humiliation\n\nsail unconstrained then stay with sirens \nlife with sirens\n\nsail unconstrained then home to Ithaca \nreach home, no humiliation\n\n\nTable 5. Na\u00efve Ulysses\u2019\ndecision problem\n\n\nThere is no need to labour the point that the na\u00efve approach to\nsequential choice is aptly named. The hallmark of the sophisticated\napproach, by contrast, is its emphasis on backwards planning: the\nsophisticated chooser does not assume that all paths through the\ndecision tree, or in other words, all possible combinations of choices\nat the various choice nodes, will be possible. The agent considers,\nrather, what he/she will be inclined to choose at later choice nodes\nwhen he/she gets to the temporal position in question. Sophisticated\nUlysses would take note of the fact that, if he reaches the island of\nthe sirens unrestrained, he will want to stop there indefinitely, due\nto the transformative effect of the sirens\u2019 song on his\npreferences. This is then reflected in the static representation of\nthe decision problem, as per Table 6. The states here concern\nUlysses\u2019 future preferences, once he reaches the island. Since\nthe second state has (by assumption) probability zero, the acts are\ndecided on the basis of the first state, so Ulysses wisely chooses to\nbe tied to the mast.\n\n\n\nAct\nlater choose sirens \\( (p = 1)\\)\nlater choose Ithaca \\( (p = 0)\\)\n\norder tying to mast \nhome, some humiliation \nhome, some humiliation\n\nsail unconstrained \nlife with sirens \nhome, no humiliation\n\n\nTable 6. Sophisticated Ulysses\u2019\ndecision problem\n\n\nResolute choice deviates from sophisticated choice only under certain\nconditions that are not fulfilled by Ulysses, given his inexplicable\nchange in attitudes. Defenders of resolute choice typically defend\ndecision theories and associated preferences that violate the\nIndependence axiom/Sure-Thing Principle (notably McClennen 1990 and\nMachina 1989; see also Rabinowicz 1995 and Buchak 2013 for\ndiscussion), and appeal to resolute choice to make these preferences\nmore palatable in the sequential-decision context (to be discussed\nfurther in\n Section 6.2\n below). According to resolute choice, in appropriate contexts, the\nagent should at all choice points stick to the strategy that was\ninitially deemed best. The question is whether this advice makes\nsense, given the standard interpretation of a sequential decision\nmodel. What would it mean for an agent to choose against her\npreferences in order to fulfill a previously-selected plan? That would\nseem to defy the very notion of preference. Of course, an agent may\nplace considerable importance on honouring previous commitments. Any\nsuch integrity concerns, however, should arguably be reflected in the\nspecification of outcomes and thus in the agent\u2019s preferences at\nthe time in question. This is quite different from choosing out of\nstep with one\u2019s all-things-considered preferences at a time.\n\nDefenders of resolute choice may have in mind a different\ninterpretation of sequential decision models, whereby future\n\u201cchoice points\u201d are not really points at which an agent is\nfree to choose according to her preferences at the time. If so, this\nwould amount to a subtle shift in the question or problem of interest.\nIn what follows, the standard interpretation of sequential decision\nmodels will be assumed, and accordingly, it will be assumed that\nrational agents pursue the sophisticated approach to choice (as per\nLevi 1991, Maher 1992, Seidenfeld 1994, amongst others).\n",
