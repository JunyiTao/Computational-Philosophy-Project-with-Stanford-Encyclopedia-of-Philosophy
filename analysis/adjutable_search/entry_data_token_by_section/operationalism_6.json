    "main_text": "Critiques of operationalism || Operational definitions are not required for all useful concepts\n2.2 Operational definitions are not required for all useful concepts\n\nSo far I have noted that an operational definition is not sufficient\nto express a concept\u2019s meaning fully. Going further than that,\nmany critics of operationalism have argued that not every good\nscientific concept needs to have an operational definition. If\noperationalism means demanding that every concept and every\ninferential step should have an immediate operational significance, it\nconstitutes an overly restrictive empiricism. At times Bridgman did\nappear to be making such a demand, as illustrated in the poignant\nepisode (discussed in Section 1.3 above) in which he criticized\nEinstein for betraying his own operationalist lesson in the general\ntheory of relativity. Einstein\u2019s view was that there was no\nreason for physicists to shrink from using a non-operational concept\nif that delivered good results.\n\nEinstein was self-consciously opportunistic in his methodological\neclecticism, but philosophers wanted to find a more general rationale\nfor freeing scientific theorizing from operationalist\nmicro-management. The crux of the problem here for the operationalist\nis that theoretical concepts are much too useful in science. Bridgman\nactually acknowledged from early on that there were good theoretical\nconcepts that were not amenable to direct operationalization,\nillustrating the point with the example of stress and strain inside a\nsolid body (1927, 53\u201354), and the wavefunction in quantum\nmechanics (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79). Bridgman saw clearly that\nthese theoretical concepts only had indirect connections with physical\noperations, but he did not see any problems with that. He in fact went\nso far as to say: \u201cthere need be no qualms that the operational\npoint of view will ever place the slightest restriction on the freedom\nof the theoretical physicist to explore the consequences of any free\nmental construction\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 79; see also\nBridgman 1949b, 256). All that was required was that the theoretical\nsystem touched the operational ground somewhere, eventually. However,\nin that case Bridgman\u2019s message was the same as\nEinstein\u2019s, as the physicist R. B. Lindsay pointed out (Lindsay\nin Frank 1956, 71\u201372).\n\nBridgman\u2019s position on the matter of theoretical concepts was\ncomplicated, and perhaps not entirely self-consistent (I will return\nto this point in Section 3.3). One common objection to operationalism\nis based on a misunderstanding that reveals an essential difference\nbetween Bridgman and most of his critics. It is often said that\noperationalism cannot be right because each scientific concept can be\nmeasured in various ways. This criticism is based on the presumption\nthat the concept in question has unity, which means that its\ndefinition must also be unified. If there are a variety of measurement\nmethods all of which apply to one concept, then measurement methods\ncannot be what supplies the unified definition; instead, some\ntheoretical account must be given as to how the variety of operations\nunder consideration serve to measure the same thing. Bridgman, in\ncontrast, had no such presumption of conceptual unity. For him, the\ninitial position to take was that if there are different methods of\nmeasurement we have different concepts, as he said about\n\u201ctactual\u201d and \u201coptical\u201d length being two\ndifferent concepts. Now, it could be that there is one aspect\nof reality that different measurement operations all get at, but that\nis something to be demonstrated, not to be assumed at the outset. The\npossibility of unity can be entertained if the minimum condition of\nnumerical convergence is met\u2014that is, if two measurement\noperations have an overlapping range and their results agree in the\noverlap. Still, Bridgman maintained some skepticism about whether it\nwas safe for us to infer real conceptual unity from such numerical\nconvergence.\n\nBridgman\u2019s ambivalence about conceptual unity elicited a serious\nworry about the systematic import of scientific concepts and theories,\nmost astutely expressed by Hempel (1966, 91\u201397).\nBridgman\u2019s skeptical caution would result in an intolerable\nfragmentation of science, Hempel argued. It would result in \u201ca\nproliferation of concepts of length, of temperature, and of all other\nscientific concepts that would not only be practically unmanageable,\nbut theoretically endless.\u201d Hempel\u2019s worry was that\nBridgman\u2019s quest for safety was blinding him to one of the\nultimate aims of science, \u201cnamely the attainment of a simple,\nsystematically unified account of empirical phenomena\u201d (Hempel\n1966, 94). Along similar lines, Lindsay (1937, 458) had earlier argued\nthat \u201csuch an isolation of concepts would defeat the very aim of\nphysical science, which is to provide a simple and economical\ndescription\u201d of physical experience \u201cin terms of a minimum\nnumber of concepts\u201d. Bridgman had serious doubts about the\nplausibility of such a simple, unified account of nature, as I will\nexplain further in Section 3.4. But Hempel and others could genuinely\nenvisage it. Hempel noted that with the development of science there\nwas a continually growing and thickening network of \u201cnomic\nthreads\u201d linking various \u201cknot-concepts\u201d with each\nother as further empirical laws were discovered. Hempel argued that it\nwas essential to keep this thickening conceptual network systematic\nand simple; to that end, \u201cconcept formation and theory formation\nmust go hand in hand\u201d (Hempel 1966, 97). That, in turn, often\nnecessitated \u201ca modification of the operational criteria\noriginally adopted for some of the central concepts\u201d (Hempel\n1966, 95). Operationalism would stand in the way of such\nflexibility.\n",
