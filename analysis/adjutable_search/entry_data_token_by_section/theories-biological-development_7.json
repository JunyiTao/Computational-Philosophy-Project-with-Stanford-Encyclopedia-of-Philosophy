Regulative Theories of Development\n\nThis \u201cepigenesis-first\u201d view of development set the stage\nfor a strand of theorizing that continued well into the twentieth\ncentury. The main theoretical tension in twentieth- and\ntwenty-first-century studies of development is not between classic\npreformation and epigenesis, but between different views about control\nof developmental processes. If genes are the primary source of\ncontrol, then organismal development is preformationist in an\nimportant sense: it is genetically determined. But if control is more\ndistributed or holistic, such that developing organisms are (in some\nsense) self-organizing, then the process is regulated in a way\nrecalling classic theories of epigenesis. Several influential theories\nof morphogenesis and pattern formation take the latter view.\nGene-based accounts of development take the former. In this way, the\nclassic theoretical opposition between preformation and epigenesis is\ntransformed and carried forward into the twentieth and twenty-first\ncenturies. In the first half of the twentieth century, theoretical\nconcepts associated with epigenesis played a significant role in\nstudies of development. This section surveys the main theoretical\nefforts along these lines.\n",
