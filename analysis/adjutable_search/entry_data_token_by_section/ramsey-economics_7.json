    "main_text": "The Problem of Optimum Saving || Discounted Utilitarianism\n3.4 Discounted Utilitarianism\n\n\nIt transpires the mathematics is a lot simpler if, instead of\nassuming time is continuous, time is taken to be discrete. Thus we now\nassume that \\(t = 0,1,2,\\ldots\\) . Assume also that\nintergenerational well-being at \\(t = 0\\) can be measured in terms\nof a numerical function \\(V\\). The idea is to require the\nfunction, which is defined on infinite well-being streams, to satisfy\nproperties that reflect ethical directives.\n\n\nLet \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\) be an infinite well-being stream, that is, \\(\\{U(t)\\}\n= (U(0),U(1),\\ldots ,U(t),\\ldots)\\).  We say \\(V(\\{U(t)\\})\\)\nis continuous if in an appropriate mathematical sense the\nvalues of \\(V\\) for well-being streams \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\) that don\u2019t\ndiffer much in the space of \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\)s are close to one another. A\nfurther condition on the \\(V\\)-function that is ethically attractive\nis \u201cmonotonicity\u201d. To define the notion let us say a\nwell-being stream is \u201csuperior\u201d to another if no\ngeneration enjoys less well-being along the former than along the\nlatter and if there is at least one generation that enjoys greater\nwell-being in the former than it does in the latter. We say that \\(V\\)\nis monotonic if \\(V\\) is larger for a well-being stream than\nit is for another if the former is superior to the latter.\n\n\nBoth properties are attractive. Lexicographic orderings\nnotwithstanding, there are not convincing arguments against continuity.\nOf course Rawls (1972) placed priority rules and the lexicographic\norderings on the objects of interest in his conception of justice that\ncome with them at the centre of his theory, but that has proved to have\nbeen one of his most contentious moves. The richness and depth of his\nanalysis would not be lessened if small tradeoffs were admitted between\nthe objects of justice. And it\u2019s hard to find reasons against\nmonotonicity. Even Rawls, whose work was so pointed toward distributive\njustice, insisted on monotonicity.\n\n\nBut it can be shown that any \\(V\\)-function that satisfies\ncontinuity and monotonicity must have generation discounting built into\nit. It would seem the real numbers are not rich enough to accommodate\ninfinite well-being streams in a manner that respects continuity and\nmonotonicity while awarding the well-beings of all generations equal\nweight. Proof of the proposition is in Diamond (1965), and was\nattributed by the author to Menahem Yaari. So we now introduce positive\nwell-being discounting in the \\(V\\)-function and formulate\nRamsey Mark III.\n\n\nReturn once again to the formulation where time is continuous. As\npreviously, we say a consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) is\nfeasible if it satisfies equation (1) with an initial capital\nstock of \\(K(0)\\). Ramsey Mark III (Ramsey 1928,\n553\u2013555) is then:\n\n\n\u201cFrom the set of all feasible consumption streams, find that\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) which maximizes\n\n\\[\nV(0) = \\int^{\\infty}_0 [U(C(t))e^{-\\delta t}]dt, \\delta \\gt 0.\u201d\n\\]\n\n\nIn Mark III the discount rate \\(\\delta\\) is a positive\nconstant. That means the corresponding discount factor\n\\(e^{-\\delta}\\) is less than 1. The latter in turn can be\nshown to mean that in a wide range of economic models\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}\\) tends to zero at so fast a rate\nthat Mark III has an answer.\n\n\nLet \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) be the solution of Ramsey Mark\nIII. Heuristically it is useful to imagine that there is a DM at\neach date. The measure of intergenerational well-being for the DM at\ndate \\(t\\) is the \\(V(t)\\) of equation (4). Notice that the ethical\nviews of the successive DMs are congruent with one another. There is\nthus no need for the DMs to draw up an \u201cintergenerational\ncontract\u201d. The DM at every date will want to choose the level of\nconsumption it deems to be optimum, aware that succeeding DMs will\nchoose in accordance with what she had planned for them. In modern\ngame theoretic parlance, Ramsey\u2019s optimum consumption stream\n\\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) is a \u201cnon-cooperative\u201d (Nash) equilibrium\namong the DMs.\n",
