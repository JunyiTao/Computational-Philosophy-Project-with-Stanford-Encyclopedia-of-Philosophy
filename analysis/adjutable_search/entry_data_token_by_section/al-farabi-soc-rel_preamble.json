    "main_text": "\n\nWhile al-Farabi does not have a specific term for \u2018philosophy of\nreligion\u2019, he does in fact have one which can more or less\nliterally be translated as \u2018philosophy of society\u2019,\nnamely, falsafa\n madaniyya.[1]\n Notably, this notion embraces two chief moments. First, in line with\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, it comprises an\nintrinsically anthropological and ethical element; accordingly,\nfalsafa madaniyya is the part of philosophy dedicated to an\ninquiry into the kamal al-insan, the perfection of man, as an\nindividual. Second, just like Plato\u2019s Politeia and\nAristotle\u2019s Politica, it moreover deals with the\nmadina, the polis, as a whole, taking into account\nits makeup and administration. However, it does so strictly from two\nangles: it assesses the madina and its regime with respect to\ntheir success, on the one hand, in guiding citizens towards their\nindividual perfection and, consequently, towards ultimate happiness;\nand on the other hand, in emulating society\u2019s normative model,\nnamely, the cosmic order, through the makeup of the city.\n\nIt is precisely in this connection that religion, milla, as\nal-Farabi views it, has its place. According to him, religion is the\nensemble of beliefs and rules of conduct governing a society. It is\nso-to-speak its ideological and legal constitution designed by its\nfirst ruler to direct its citizens towards human perfection and thus\nto contribute simultaneously to the attainment of individual happiness\nand the well-being of the city. As a consequence, on al-Farabi\u2019s\naccount, religion is essentially an instrument intended for\napplication; it cannot be considered a sphere of knowledge, wisdom,\nand truth on its own. This notion of religion and its place within the\nframe of falsafa madaniyya had a tremendous impact on\nsubsequent thinkers in the Islamic world\u2014such as Ibn Bajja, Ibn\nTufayl, and Ibn Rushd\u2014as well as on the manner in which\nal-Farabi\u2019s thought and, more particularly, what is usually\nreferred to as his \u2018political philosophy\u2019 have been\nassessed in Western historiography. In order to get a clearer idea of\nthese issues, they shall be examined in the sequence just indicated:\nfrom the foundation, al-Farabi\u2019s philosophy of society\n (section 2),\n across the principle of similitude determining the relation of man,\nsociety, and cosmos\n (section 3),\n towards religion and the art of ruling\n (section 4).\n",
