    "main_text": "Modern Forms of Civic Education || Service Learning\n4.1 Service Learning\n\nPutting students into the community-at-large is today called\n\u201cservice-learning.\u201d It is a common form of civic education\nthat integrates classroom instruction with work within the community.\nIdeally, the students take their experience and observations from\nservice into their academic work, and use their academic research and\ndiscussions to inform their service.\n\nJerome Bruner, the renowned educator and psychologist, proposed that\nsome classroom learning ought to be devoted to students creating\npolitical-action plans addressing significant social and political\nissues such as poverty or race. He also urged educators to get their\nstudents out into the local communities to explore the occupations,\nways of life, and habits of residence. Bruner is here following Dewey,\nwho criticized traditional education for its failure to get teachers\nand students out into the community to become intimately familiar with\nthe physical, historical, occupational, and economic conditions that\ncould then be used as educational resources (Dewey 1938, 40). Dewey\nwarned of the \u201cstanding danger that the material of formal\ninstruction will be merely the subject matter of the schools, isolated\nfrom the subject matter of life experience.\u201d This could be\ncountered by immersing students in \u201cthe spirit of\nservice,\u201d especially by learning about the various occupations\nwithin their communities (1916, 10\u201311,\n 49).[14]\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that experiential education may be most\neffective for civic learning. \u201cThe reason, again, is that\nstudents respond to experiences that touch their emotions and senses\nof self in a firsthand way\u201d (Damon, 2001, 141). Also, as Conover\nand Searing point out, \u201cwhile most students identify themselves\nas citizens, their grasp of what it means to act as citizens is\nrudimentary and dominated by a focus on rights, thus creating a\nprivately oriented, passive understanding\u201d (2000, 108). To bring\nthem out of this private and passive understanding, nothing is better,\nas Tocqueville noted, than political participation. The kind of\nparticipation here is political action, not simply voting or giving\nmoney. William Damon concludes that the most effective moral education\nprograms \u201care those that engage students directly in action,\nwith subsequent opportunities for reflection\u201d (2001, 144).\n\nAnother influence on service-learning is the theory of social capital,\ndescribed above. If a democracy depends on people serving one another\nand developing habits and networks of reciprocal concern--and if that\nkind of interaction is declining in a country like the United\nStates--then it is natural to encourage or require students to serve\nas part of their learning. \n",
