Feelings of altruism, jealousy,\netc. are ignored in order not to make the allocation of resources\ndepend on the contingent distribution of benevolent and malevolent\nfeelings among the population (see e.g. Goodin 1986, Harsanyi 1977).\nIt may be worth mentioning here that the no-envy criterion discussed\nabove has nothing to do with interpersonal feelings, since it is\ndefined only with self-centered preferences. When an individual\n\u201cenvies\u201d another in this particular sense, he simply\nprefers the other\u2019s consumption to his own, but no feeling is\ninvolved (he might even not be aware of the existence of the other\nindividual).\n\nBut positive economics is quite relevantly interested in studying the\nimpact of individual feelings on behavior. Homo \u0153conomicus may\nbe rational without being narrowly focused on his own consumption. The\nanalysis of labor relations, strategic interactions, transfers within\nthe family, generous gifts require a more complex picture of human\nrelations (Fehr and Fischbacher 2002). Reciprocity, in particular,\nseems to be a powerful source of motivation, leading individuals to\nincur substantial costs in order to reward nice partners and punish\nfaulty partners (Fehr and Gachter 2000). For an extensive survey of\nthis branch of the economic literature, see G\u00e9rard-Varet, Kolm\nand Mercier-Ythier (2004).\n",
