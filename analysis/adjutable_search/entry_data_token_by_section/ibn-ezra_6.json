    "main_text": "Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi\n7. Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi\n\n\nThe most interesting and truly philosophical chapters in his writings\nhave nothing to do with recycling and restyling doctrines of the soul,\nbut rather with frank discussions concerning fundamental questions of\nJewish identity. In a lengthy gloss to the first of the ten\ncommandments (Exodus 20:1), Ibn Ezra records a conversation he held\nwith his close friend and fellow poet Judah Halevi. Why, Halevi wants\nto know, did God choose to reveal himself on Mount Sinai as the God\nWho took the Jews out of Egypt? Why didn\u2019t He instead reveal\nHimself as the God Who created heaven and earth, and created man as\nwell? Why did He identify Himself with an event important to Israel\nalone, rather than with an event of universal significance? The\nimplied criticism of the standard philosophical viewpoint, to which\nIbn Ezra adheres consistently throughout his oeuvre, is\ntransparent. If Creation is the most manifest and convincing\nindication for the existence of the deity, as the philosophers aver;\nif God reveals Himself to us through His works\u2014why, then, does\nHe choose to reveal Himself at Sinai as the God of history, the God of\nthe Exodus?\n\n\nIbn Ezra begins his reply with the observation that people differ in\nthe nature of their belief. Some believe in God because they have\nheard about Him or read about Him in the Bible; but should that belief\nbe challenged in any way, they are immediately stymied. By contrast,\nthose who have chosen the path of knowledge will work their way up\nfrom the study of mineral and animal kingdoms to the structure and\nfunctions of the human body, and thence to a study of the\nheavens. Thus will the scholar ascend from God\u2019s \u201cways\u201d to\nan understanding of the divine name. According to Ibn Ezra, the first\ntwo words of the commandment (\u201cI [am] YHWH\u201d) hint at the\nknowledge of God that one obtains from creation; it would thus be\nsuperfluous to add \u201cWho made heaven and earth\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\nThus far Ibn Ezra has reiterated, and endorsed, the view of the\nphilosophers. Now, however, he parts ways with them; astrology plays a\nkey role in this turn of thought. The intellectuals who follow this\npath, observes Ibn Ezra, deny divine intervention in worldly matters.\nIsrael\u2019s astral destiny was such that she should not have been freed\nfrom bondage at that particular time. God however can overrule the\nstars, and His doing so precisely at that astrally inauspicious moment\nis compelling proof, not only for His existence, but for the operation\nof the cosmos that He created.\n\n\nGod\u2019s self-introduction as the One Who took you out of Egypt connects\nto the truth of God\u2019s existence, as evidenced by the cosmos.  It adds,\nhowever, the important detail that the Creator is also the\nRedeemer. In sum, God\u2019s self-revelation as \u201cthe one Who took you\nout of Egypt\u201d does not contradict the tenet that God reveals\nHimself through His works; it rather adds to it an important point,\neither overlooked or denied by the philosophers. Immediately\nafterwards, however, and quite characteristically, Ibn Ezra continues\nhis exposition in a somewhat different vein. He observes that the next\nword, \u201cyour God\u201d, conveys our obligation to worship;\nfinally, the remainder of the sentence, \u201cWho took you out of\nEgypt\u201d, simply hints at the miracles that are all the simple\nfolk have to lean upon in their belief.\n\n\nWe have extracted here the main points from one of the longest\nexcursuses in Ibn Ezra\u2019s biblical commentary. It does not require any\ngreat stretch of the imagination to suppose that the dry and concise\nresum\u00e9 that Ibn Ezra chose to include in his gloss summarizes\nwhat must have been a lengthy debate, perhaps even a series of\nencounters, between the two poets. In fact, in his commentary to\nDaniel 9:2, Ibn Ezra describes more fully an exchange with Halevi over\nan issue of biblical chronology, recording several barbs and retorts\nuntil, in the end, Halevi fell silent. Perhaps, then, Ibn Ezra chose\nto abridge the conversation over the first commandment because that\nencounter did not exactly leave Halevi speechless. Quite the contrary:\nHalevi expanded upon his theme of Jewish particularism in his\nKuzari, one of the most resonant works of Jewish\nthought  ever.\n\n\nArmchair philosophy this may be, but it concerns one of the most\nfundamental questions of the Jewish experience. Is Judaism just one\nset of directives among many for achieving one and the same spiritual\nobjective, which is the goal of all humans? Are Jews one people among\nmany, or do they occupy a special place in the scale of existents?\nBetter analytic minds may have been tested in replying to these\nquestions, but perhaps not two more vibrant, passionate souls than\nthese two Hebrew poets. The \u201cphilosopher\u201d of Halevi\u2019s\nKuzari presents a point of view that coincides on major\npoints with that of Ibn Ezra, most notably in the universalism of his\nprogram for humanity, and the relativism of his approach to ritual and\npraxis (Langermann 1993, 70\u201374). For his part, Halevi demands a much\nmore real and meaningful cleavage between Jews and the rest of the\nnations.\n",
