    "main_text": "\n\nQuestions about faith have inspired centuries of philosophical and\ntheological reflection, particularly, though by no means exclusively,\nas faith is understood within the Christian branch of the Abrahamic\nreligions. What is faith? What makes faith reasonable or unreasonable,\nvaluable or disvaluable, morally permissible or impermissible,\nvirtuous or vicious? How does faith relate to psychological states\nsuch as belief, desire, trust, and hope? How does faith relate to\naction? To what extent is faith under our voluntary control? Because\nanswers to these further questions depend on what faith is, as well as\non assumptions about relevant evaluative norms and the philosophical\npsychology and theory of action applicable to faith, this entry\nfocusses on the nature of faith, while also touching upon\nimplications of various models of faith for assessments of its\nreasonableness and value.\n\n\u2018Faith\u2019 is a broad term, appearing in locutions that point\nto a range of different phenomena. We speak of \u2018having faith\nthat you will succeed, despite setbacks,\u2019 \u2018having faith in\ndemocracy,\u2019 \u2018putting faith in God,\u2019 \u2018believing\nthat God exists by faith,\u2019 \u2018being a person of\nfaith,\u2019 \u2018professing and keeping the faith (or losing\nit),\u2019 \u2018keeping (or failing to keep) faith with\nsomeone\u2019, and so on. At its most general \u2018faith\u2019\nmeans much the same as \u2018trust\u2019. Uses of\n\u2018faith\u2019 and \u2018faithfulness\u2019 closely parallel\n\u2018trust\u2019 and \u2018trustworthiness\u2019 and these are\noften used interchangeably. Yet one of the striking and intriguing\nfacts about theorizing in this area (the study of faith, faithfulness,\nand related phenomena), is that people have offered radically\ndifferent accounts of what faith is\u2014to such an extent that there\nremains disagreement even about the basic ontological category to\nwhich faith belongs. Is it a psychological state and, if so, is it\ncognitive, affective/evaluative, or perhaps some combination of both?\nIs it an act or disposition to act\u2014or is there at least some\nsort of connection to action essential to faith and, if so, to what\nsorts of acts?\n\nThis entry will focus on religious faith as paradigmatic\u2014or,\nrather, it will focus on the kind of faith exemplified in theistic\nfaith (i.e., faith in God, faith that God exists, and commitment\nto a theistic interpretation of reality), while leaving open whether\nfaith of that same general kind also belongs to other,\nnon-theistic, religious contexts, or to contexts not usually thought\nof as religious at all. The question of faith outside of a theistic\ncontext, such as whether it is apt to speak of the faith of a\nhumanist, or even an atheist, using the same general sense of\n\u2018faith\u2019 as applies to the theist case, is taken up in the\nfinal Section (11).\n\nPhilosophical reflection on theistic religious faith has produced\nmarkedly different accounts or models of its nature. This entry\norganizes discussion of accounts or models of faith around key\ncomponents that feature in such accounts\u2014with varying emphases,\nand with varying views about how these components relate to one\nanother. These components are the cognitive, the\naffective, the evaluative, and the\npractical (volitional, actional and behavioural). Models of\nfaith may also be usefully categorized according to further\nprinciples, including\n\nhow the model relates faith as a state to the actional components\nassociated with faith;\nwhether the model takes the object of faith to be exclusively\npropositional (e.g., faith that such and such) or not (e.g., faith in\npersons or ideals);\nthe type of epistemology with which the model is\nassociated\u2014whether it is broadly \u2018internalist\u2019 or\n\u2018externalist\u2019, \u2018evidentialist\u2019 or\n\u2018fideist\u2019;\nwhether the model is necessarily restricted to theistic religious\nfaith, or may extend beyond it.\n\n\nThe entry proceeds dialectically, with later sections presupposing the\nearlier discussion.
