Life and Work\n\n\nGeorge Boole was born November 2, 1815 in Lincoln, Lincolnshire,\nEngland, into a family of modest means, with a father who was\nevidently more of a good companion than a good breadwinner. His father\nwas a shoemaker whose real passion was being a devoted dilettante in\nthe realm of science and technology, one who enjoyed participating in\nthe Lincoln Mechanics\u2019 Institution; this was essentially a community\nsocial club promoting reading, discussions, and lectures regarding\nscience. It was founded in 1833, and in 1834 Boole\u2019s father became the\ncurator of its library. This love of learning was clearly inherited by\nBoole. Without the benefit of an elite schooling, but with a\nsupportive family and access to excellent books, in particular from\nSir Edward Bromhead, FRS, who lived only a few miles from Lincoln,\nBoole was able to essentially teach himself foreign languages and\nadvanced mathematics.\n\n\nStarting at the age of 16 it was necessary for Boole to find gainful\nemployment, since his father was no longer capable of providing for\nthe family. After 3 years working as a teacher in private schools,\nBoole decided, at the age of 19, to open his own small school in\nLincoln. He would be a schoolmaster for the next 15 years, until 1849\nwhen he became a professor at the newly opened Queen\u2019s University in\nCork, Ireland. With heavy responsibilities for his parents and\nsiblings, it is remarkable that he nonetheless found time during the\nyears as a schoolmaster to continue his own education and to start a\nprogram of research, primarily on differential equations and the\ncalculus of variations connected with the works of Laplace and\nLagrange (which he studied in the original French).\n\n\nThere is a widespread belief that Boole was primarily a\nlogician\u2014in reality he became a recognized mathematician well\nbefore he had penned a single word about logic, all the while running\nhis private school to care for his parents and siblings. Boole\u2019s\nability to read French, German and Italian put him in a good position\nto start serious mathematical studies when, at the age of 16, he read\nLacroix\u2019s Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel, a gift from his friend\nReverend G.S. Dickson of Lincoln. Seven years later, in 1838, he would\nwrite his first mathematical paper (although not the first to be\npublished), \u201cOn certain theorems in the calculus of\nvariations,\u201d focusing on improving results he had read in\nLagrange\u2019s M\u00e9chanique Analytique.\n\n\nIn early 1839 Boole travelled to Cambridge to meet with the young\nmathematician Duncan F. Gregory (1813\u20131844), the editor\nof the Cambridge Mathematical Journal\n(CMJ)\u2014Gregory had co-founded this journal in 1837 and\nedited it until his health failed in 1843 (he died in early 1844, at\nthe age of 30). Gregory, though only 2 years beyond his degree in\n1839, became an important mentor to Boole. With Gregory\u2019s support,\nwhich included coaching Boole on how to write a mathematical paper,\nBoole entered the public arena of mathematical publication in\n1841.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s mathematical publications span the 24 years from 1841 to 1864,\nthe year he died from pneumonia. Breaking these 24 years into three\nsegments, the first 6 years (1841\u20131846), the \nsecond 8 years (1847\u20131854), and the last 10 years \n(1855\u20131864), we find that his published work on \nlogic was entirely in the middle 8 years.\n\n\nIn his first 6 career years, Boole published 15 mathematical papers,\nall but two in the CMJ and its 1846 successor, The\nCambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal. He wrote on standard\nmathematical topics, mainly differential equations, integration and the\ncalculus of variations. Boole enjoyed early success in using the new\nsymbolical method in analysis, a method which took a differential\nequation, say:\n\n\\[\nd^2 y/dx^2 - dy/dx - 2y = \\cos(x),\n\\]\n\n\nand wrote it in the form Operator\\((y) =\\) cos\\((x)\\). \nThis was (formally) achieved by letting:\n\n\\[\nD = d/dx, D^2 = d^2 /dx^2, \\text{etc.}\n\\]\n\n\nleading to an expression of the differential equation as:\n\n\\[\n(D^2 - D - 2) y = \\cos(x).\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow symbolical algebra came into play by simply treating the operator\n\\(D^2 - D - 2\\) as though it were an ordinary polynomial in\nalgebra. Boole\u2019s 1841 paper On the integration of linear\ndifferential equations with constant coefficients gave a nice\nimprovement to Gregory\u2019s method for solving such differential\nequations, an improvement based on a standard tool in algebra, partial fractions, \nwhich he applied to the reciprocal of differential operators like the above.\n\n\nIn 1841 Boole also published his first paper on invariants, a paper\nthat would strongly influence Eisenstein, Cayley, and Sylvester to\ndevelop the subject. Arthur Cayley (1821\u20131895), the future\nSadlerian Professor in Cambridge and one of the most prolific\nmathematicians in history, wrote his first letter to Boole in 1844,\ncomplimenting him on his excellent work on invariants. He became a\nclose personal friend, one who would go to Lincoln to visit and stay\nwith Boole in the years before Boole moved to Cork, Ireland. In 1842\nBoole started a correspondence with Augustus De Morgan\n(1806\u20131871) that initiated another lifetime friendship.\n\n\nIn 1843 the schoolmaster Boole finished a lengthy paper on\ndifferential equations, combining an exponential substitution and\nvariation of parameters with the separation of symbols method. The\npaper was too long for the CMJ\u2014Gregory, and later De\nMorgan, encouraged him to submit it to the Royal Society. The first\nreferee rejected Boole\u2019s paper, but the second recommended it for the\nGold Medal for the best mathematical paper written in the years\n1841\u20131844, and this recommendation was accepted. In 1844 the\nRoyal Society published Boole\u2019s paper and awarded him the Gold \nMedal\u2014the first Gold Medal awarded by the Society to a mathematician.\nThe next year Boole read a paper at the annual meeting of the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science at Cambridge in June 1845.\nThis led to new contacts and friends, in particular William Thomson\n(1824\u20131907), the future Lord Kelvin.\n\n\nNot long after starting to publish papers, Boole was eager to\nfind a way to become affiliated with an institution of higher learning.\nHe considered attending Cambridge University to obtain a degree, but\nwas counselled that fulfilling the various requirements would likely\nseriously interfere with his research program, not to mention the\nproblems of obtaining financing. Finally, in 1849, he obtained a\nprofessorship in a new university opening in Cork, Ireland. In the\nyears he was a professor in Cork (1849\u20131864) he would\noccasionally inquire about the possibility of a position back in\nEngland.\n\n\nThe 8 year stretch from 1847 to 1854 starts and ends with Boole\u2019s\ntwo books on mathematical logic. In addition Boole published 24 more\npapers on traditional mathematics during this period, while only one\npaper was written on logic, that being in 1848. He was awarded an\nhonorary LL.D. degree by the University of Dublin in 1851, and this was\nthe title that he used beside his name in his 1854 book on logic.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s 1847 book, Mathematical Analysis of Logic, will be\nreferred to as MAL; the 1854 book, Laws of Thought,\nas LT.\n\n\nDuring the last 10 years of his career, from 1855 to 1864, Boole\npublished 17 papers on mathematics and two mathematics books, one on\ndifferential equations and one on difference equations. Both books were\nhighly regarded, and used for instruction at Cambridge. Also\nduring this time significant honors came in:\n\n\n1857\u00a0Fellowship of the Royal Society\n1858\u00a0Honorary Member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\n1859\u00a0Degree of DCL, honoris causa from Oxford\n\n\nUnfortunately his keen sense of duty led to his walking through a\nrainstorm in late 1864, and then lecturing in wet clothes. Not long\nafterwards, on December 8, 1864 in Ballintemple, County Cork, Ireland,\nhe died of pneumonia, at the age of 49. Another paper on mathematics\nand a revised book on differential equations, giving considerable\nattention to singular solutions, were published post mortem.\n\n\nThe reader interested in excellent accounts of\nBoole\u2019s personal life is referred to Desmond MacHale\u2019s George\nBoole, His Life and Work, 1985/2014,\nand the more recent book \nNew Light on George Boole, 2018, by Desmond MacHale and Yvonne Cohen,\nsources to which this article is greatly\nindebted.\n\n1815 \u2014 Birth in Lincoln, England\n1830 \u2014 His translation of a Greek poem printed in a local paper\n1831 \u2014 Reads Lacroix\u2019s Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel\nSchoolmaster\n1834 \u2014 Opens his own school\n1835 \u2014 Gives public address on Newton\u2019s achievements\n1838 \u2014 Writes first mathematics paper\n1839 \u2014 Visits Cambridge to meet Duncan Gregory, editor of the\nCambridge Mathematical Journal (CMJ)\n1841 \u2014 First four mathematical publications (all in the\nCMJ)\n1842 \u2014 Initiates correspondence with Augustus De Morgan\n\u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1844 \u2014 Correspondence with Cayley starts (initiated by\nCayley) \u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1844 \u2014 Gold Medal from the Royal Society for a paper on\ndifferential equations\n1845 \u2014 Gives talk at the Annual Meeting of the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, and meets William Thomson\n(later Lord Kelvin) \u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1847 \u2014 Publishes Mathematical Analysis of Logic\n1848 \u2014 Publishes his only paper on the algebra of logic\nProfessor of Mathematics\n1849 \u2014 Accepts position as (the first) Professor of Mathematics at the new Queen\u2019s University in Cork, Ireland\n1851 \u2014 Honorary Degree, LL.D., from Trinity College, Dublin\n1854 \u2014 Publishes Laws of Thought \n1855 \u2014 Marriage to Mary Everest, niece of George Everest,\nSurveyor-General of India after whom Mt.

The Context and Background of Boole\u2019s Work In Logic\n\n\nTo understand how Boole developed his\nalgebra of logic, it is useful to review the broad\noutlines of the work on the foundations of algebra that had been\nundertaken by mathematicians affiliated with Cambridge University in\nthe 1800s prior to the beginning of Boole\u2019s mathematical publishing\ncareer. An excellent reference for further reading connected to this\nsection is the annotated sourcebook From Kant to Hilbert,\n1996, by William Ewald, which contains a complete copy of Boole\u2019s\nMathematical Analysis of Logic.\n\n\n\nThe 19th century opened in England with mathematics in the doldrums.\nThe English mathematicians had feuded with the continental\nmathematicians over the issues of priority in the development of the\ncalculus, resulting in the English following Newton\u2019s notation, and\nthose on the continent following that of Leibniz. One of the obstacles\nto overcome in updating English mathematics was the fact that the great\ndevelopments of algebra and analysis had been built on dubious\nfoundations, and there were English mathematicians who were quite vocal\nabout these shortcomings. In ordinary algebra, it was the use of\nnegative numbers and imaginary numbers that caused concern. \n\n\n\nThe first major attempt among the English to clear up the foundation\nproblems of algebra was the Treatise on Algebra, 1830, by\nGeorge Peacock (1791\u20131858). A second edition appeared as two\nvolumes, 1842/1845. He divided the subject into two parts, the first\npart being arithmetical algebra, the algebra of the positive\nnumbers (which did not permit operations like subtraction in cases\nwhere the answer would not be a positive number). The second part was\nsymbolical algebra, which was governed not by a specific\ninterpretation, as was the case for arithmetical algebra, but solely\nby laws. In symbolical algebra there were no restrictions on using\nsubtraction, etc.\n\n\nPeacock believed that in order for symbolical algebra to be a useful\nsubject its laws had to be closely related to those of arithmetical\nalgebra. In this connection he introduced his principle of the\npermanence of equivalent forms, a principle connecting results in\narithmetical algebra to those in symbolical algebra. This principle has\ntwo parts:\n\nGeneral results in arithmetical algebra belong to the laws\nof symbolical algebra.\nWhenever an interpretation of a result of symbolical algebra\nmade sense in the setting of arithmetical algebra, the result would\ngive a correct result in arithmetic.\n\n\n\nA fascinating use of algebra was introduced in 1814 by\nFran\u00e7ois-Joseph Servois (1776\u20131847) when he tackled\ndifferential equations by separating the differential operator \nfrom the subject, as described in an example given\nabove. This application of algebra captured the interest of Gregory\nwho published a number of papers on the method of the separation\nof symbols, that is, the separation into operators and objects,\nin the CMJ. He also wrote on the foundation of algebra, and\nit was Gregory\u2019s foundation that Boole embraced almost verbatim prior to writing LT.\nGregory had abandoned Peacock\u2019s principle of the permanence of\nequivalent forms in favor of three simple laws, one of which Boole\nregarded as merely a notation convention. Unfortunately these laws\nfell far short of what is required to justify even some of the most\nelementary results in algebra, like those involving subtraction.\n\n\n\nIn On the foundation of \nalgebra, 1839, the first of four papers on this \ntopic by De Morgan that appeared in the Transactions of the Cambridge\nPhilosophical Society, one finds a tribute to the separation of\nsymbols in algebra, and the claim that modern algebraists usually\nregard the symbols as denoting operators (e.g., the derivative\noperation) instead of objects like numbers. The footnote\nProfessor Peacock is the first, I believe, who distinctly\nset forth the difference between what I have called the technical and\nthe logical branches of algebra\n\n\ncredits Peacock with being the first to separate what are now called \nthe syntactic [technical] and the semantic [logical] aspects of algebra. \nIn the second\nfoundations paper (in 1841) De Morgan proposed what he considered to be\na complete set of eight rules for working with symbolical algebra.\n\nRegarding the origin of the name Boolean algebra, Charles\nSanders Peirce (1839\u20131914) introduced, among several other\nphrases, the name Boolian algebra for the algebra that\nresulted from dispensing with the arithmetical scaffolding of\nBoole\u2019s equational algebra of logic.  With the spelling\nBoolean algebra this was embraced by his close friend the\nHarvard philosopher Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916) around 1900, and\nthen by Royce\u2019s students (including Norbert Wiener, Henry\nM. Sheffer and Clarence I. Lewis) and in due course by other Harvard\nprofessors and the world. It essentially referred to the modern\nversion of the algebra of logic introduced in 1864 by William Stanley\nJevons (1835\u20131882), a version that Boole had rejected in their\ncorrespondence\u2014see Section 5.1. For this reason the word\nBoolean will not be used in this article to describe the\nalgebra of logic that Boole actually created; instead the name\nBoole\u2019s algebra will be used.  (See the 2015 article\n\u201cGeorge Boole and Boolean Algebra\u201d by Burris.)\n\n\nIn MAL, and more so in LT, Boole was interested in the insights\nthat his algebra of logic gave to the inner workings of the mind. This pursuit\nhas met with little favor, and is not discussed in this article.\n3. The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)\n\nIn New Light on George Boole (2018) by MacHale and Cohen one\nfinds, published for the first time, (an edited version of) the\nbiography by MaryAnn Boole (1818\u20131887) of her famous brother,\nand on p. 41 there is the following passage:\n \nHe told me that from boyhood he had had the conviction that Logic\ncould be reduced to a mathematical science, and that he had often made\nhimself ill on the attempt to prove it, but it was not until 1847 that\nthe true method flashed upon him.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s final path to logic fame occurred in a curious way. In\nearly 1847 he was stimulated to renew his investigations into logic by\na trivial but very public dispute between De Morgan and the Scottish\nphilosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788\u20131856)\u2014not to be\nconfused with his contemporary the Irish mathematician Sir William\nRowan Hamilton (1805\u20131865). This dispute revolved around who\ndeserved credit for the idea of quantifying the predicate (e.g.,\nAll \\(A\\) is all \\(B\\), All \\(A\\) is some \\(B\\),\netc.). MaryAnn wrote that when the true method flashed upon him in\n1847, \u201che was literally like a man dazzled with excess of\nlight\u201d.  Within a few months Boole had written his 82 page\nmonograph, Mathematical Analysis of Logic, first presenting\nan algebraic approach to Aristotelian logic, then looking briefly at\nthe general theory. (Some say that this monograph and De\nMorgan\u2019s book Formal Logic appeared on the same day in\nNovember 1847.)\n\nWe are not told what the true method was that flashed upon Boole. One\npossibility is the discovery of the Expansion Theorem and the\nproperties of constituents.\n3.1 Boole\u2019s Version Of Aristotelian Logic\n\n\nIn pages 15\u201359, a little more than half of the 82 pages in\nMAL, Boole focused on a slight generalization of Aristotelian\nlogic, namely augmenting its four types of categorical propositions by\npermitting the subject and/or predicate to be of the form\nnot-\\(X\\). In the chapter on conversions, such as Conversion by\nLimitation\u2014All \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\), therefore Some \\(Y\\) is\n\\(X\\)\u2014Boole found the Aristotelian classification defective in\nthat it did not treat contraries, such as not-\\(X\\), on the same\nfooting as the named classes \\(X, Y, Z\\), etc. For example, he converted No \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\) into All\n\\(Y\\) is not-\\(X\\), and All X is Y into All not-Y is not-X.\n\n\n\nFor his extended version of Aristotelian logic he stated (MAL, p. 30) a set\nof three transformation rules which he claimed allowed one to construct all valid\ntwo-line categorical arguments. These transformation rules did not appear in LT. \nIt is somewhat\ncurious that when it came to analyzing categorical syllogisms, it was only\nin the conclusion that he permitted his generalized categorical propositions\nto appear.\nAmong the vast possibilities for hypothetical syllogisms, the ones \n that he discussed were standard, with one new example added.\n3.2 Class Symbols and Elective Symbols\n\n\nThe Introduction chapter of MAL starts with Boole reviewing the\nsymbolical method:\n\nthe validity of the processes of analysis does not depend upon\nthe interpretation of the symbols which are employed, but solely upon\nthe laws of their combination.\n\n\n The second chapter, First\nPrinciples, lets the symbol 1 represent the Universe \n\u201ccomprehending every conceivable class of objects, whether\nactually existing or not.\u201d Capital letters \\(X, Y,\nZ,\\ldots\\) denoted classes. Then, no doubt heavily\ninfluenced by his very successful work using algebraic techniques on\ndifferential operators, and consistent with De Morgan\u2019s 1839 assertion\nthat algebraists preferred interpreting symbols as operators, Boole\nintroduced the elective symbol \\(x\\) corresponding to the class\n\\(X\\), the elective symbol \\(y\\) corresponding to\n\\(Y\\), etc. The elective symbols denoted elective\noperators\u2014for example the elective operator red\nwhen applied to a class would elect (select) the red items in the\nclass. \n\nThen Boole said \u201cWhen no subject is expressed, we shall \nsuppose 1 (the Universe) to be the subject understood\u201d. \nHe goes on to explain that \\(x(1)\\) is just \\(X\\). Evidently this means, aside\nfrom defining the elective symbol \\(x\\), when presented with the term \\(x\\) without\na subject one is actually dealing with \\(X\\).\n\n\n3.3 Operations and Laws for Elective Symbols\n\nThe first operation that Boole introduced was multiplication\n\\(xy\\). The standard juxtaposition notation \\(xy\\) for multiplication also \nhad a standard meaning for operators (for example, differential operators), \nnamely one applied \\(y\\) to an object and then \\(x\\) is applied to the\nresult.  As pointed out by \nTheodore Hailperin (1916\u20132014) \n(1981, p. 176; and 1986, pp. 67,68), \nthis established notation\nconvention handed Boole his interpretation of the multiplication \\(xy\\) of\nelective symbols as the composition of the two operators. Thus when \nencountering\nthe expression \\(xy\\) without a subject one was dealing with the class\n\\(x(y(1))\\), \u201cthe result being the class whose members \nare both Xs and Ys\u201d. We call this class the intersection\nof \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In LT Boole dropped the (unnecessary) use of elective \nsymbols and simply let \\(x\\), \\(y\\) denote classes, with \\(xy\\) being their \nintersection. \n\nThe first law in MAL (p. 16) was the distributive law\n\n\\[\nx(u+v) = xu + xv,\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere Boole said that \\(u+v\\) corresponded to dividing a class into two parts, \nevidently meaning \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are disjoint classes. \nThis was the first mention of addition in MAL. \n\n\nHe added (MAL, p. 17) the commutative law \\(xy =\nyx\\) and the index law \\(x^n = x\\)\u2014in LT the\nlatter would be replaced by the law of duality \\(x^2 = x\\)\n(called the idempotent law in 1870 by the Harvard\nmathematician Benjamin Peirce (1809\u20131880), in another\ncontext).\n\nAfter stating the above distributive and commutative laws, Boole\nbelieved he was entitled to fully employ the ordinary algebra of his\ntime, saying (MAL, p. 18) that\n\nall the processes of Common Algebra are applicable to the present system.\n\n Boole went beyond the foundations of symbolical algebra that\nGregory had used in 1840\u2014he added De Morgan\u2019s 1841 single\nrule of inference, that equivalent operations performed upon\nequivalent subjects produce equivalent results.\n3.4 Common Algebra\n It is likely more difficult for the modern reader to come to grips\nwith the idea that Boole\u2019s algebra is based on \nCommon Algebra, the algebra of numbers, than would have been the case with \nBoole\u2019s contemporaries\u2014the modern\nreader has been exposed to modern Boolean algebra (and perhaps Boolean\nrings). In the mid 1800s the word algebra meant, for most mathematicians, \nsimply the algebra of numbers. \n\nBoole\u2019s three laws for his algebra of logic are woefully inadequate\nfor what follows in MAL. The reader will, for the most part,\nbe well served by assuming that Boole is doing ordinary polynomial\nalgebra augmented by the assumption that any power\n\\(x^n\\) of an elective symbol \\(x\\) can be replaced by \\(x\\). \nOne can safely assume that any polynomial equation p = q that holds \nin Common Algebra is valid\nin Boole\u2019s algebra as is any equational argument\n\n\\[\np_1 = q_1, \\ldots, p_k = q_k \\therefore p = q\n\\]\n\n\nthat holds in Common Algebra.\n\n[A note of caution: the argument \n\u201c\\(x^2 = x \\therefore x = 1\\) or\n\\(x = 0\\)\u201d is valid in Common Algebra, but it is \nnot an\nequational argument since the conclusion is a disjunction of\nequations, not a single equation.] \n\nBoole\u2019s algebra\nwas mainly concerned with polynomials with integer coefficients, and\nwith their values when the variables were restricted to taking on only\nthe values 0 and 1.\nSome of the key polynomials in Boole\u2019s work, \nalong with their values\non \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), are presented in the following table:\n\n\n\\(x\\) \\(y\\)\n \\(1 - x\\) \n \\(x - x^2\\) \n \\(xy\\) \n \\(x + y\\) \n \\(x - y\\) \n \\(x+y - xy\\)\n \\(x+y - 2xy\\)\n\n\n1 1\n0 0\n1 2 0\n1 0\n\n\n1 0\n0 0\n0 1 1\n1 1\n\n\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1 \\(-1\\)\n1 1\n\n\n0 0\n1 0\n0 0 0\n0 0\n\n\n\n\nNote that all of the polynomials \\(p\\)(x,y) in the above\ntable, except for addition and subtraction, take values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) when\nthe variables take values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). Such polynomials are called\nswitching functions in computer science and electrical\nengineering, and as functions on \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) they are idempotent, that is,\np\\(^2 =\\) p. The switching functions are exactly\nthe idempotent polynomials in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n3.5 Impact of the Index Law\n\n\nIn Boole\u2019s algebra, any polynomial \\(p(x)\\)\nin one variable can be reduced to a linear polynomial \\(ax + b\\)\nsince one has\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\na_n x^n + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 &= a_n x + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\\\\n  &= (a_n + \\cdots + a_1)x + a_0.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nLikewise any polynomial \\(p(x, y)\\) can be expressed as \\(axy + bx +\ncy + d\\). Etc.\n\n\nHowever Boole was much more interested in the fact that \\(ax + b\\)\ncan be written as a linear combination of \\(x\\) and \\(1-x\\), namely\n\n\\[\nax + b = (a + b)x + b(1-x).\n\\]\n\n\nThis gives his Expansion Theorem in one variable:\n\n\\[\np(x) = p(1)x + p(0)(1-x).\n\\]\n\n\nThe Expansion Theorem for polynomials in two variables is\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(x,y) =& p(1,1)xy + p(1,0)x(1-y)\\ + \\\\\n        & p(0,1) (1 - x)y + p(0,0) (1 - x)(1 - y).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nFor example,\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx + y &= 2xy + x(1-y) + (1-x)y \\\\\nx - y &= x(1-y) - (1-x)y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe expressions \\(xy, \\ldots, (1 - x)(1 - y)\\), were called\nthe constituents of \\(p(x,y)\\)\u2014it would be better to\ncall them the constituents of the variables \\(x, y\\)\u2014and the\ncoefficients \\(p(1,1), \\ldots, p(0,0)\\) were the modulii of\n\\(p(x,y)\\).\n\n\nSimilar results hold for polynomials in any number of variables\n(MAL, pp. 62\u201364), and there are three\nimportant facts about the constituents for a given list of\nvariables:\n\neach constituent is idempotent,\nthe product of two distinct constituents is 0,\nthe sum of all the constituents is 1.\n\n3.6 Equational Expressions of Categorical Propositions\n\n\nIn the chapter Of Expression and Interpretation, Boole\nsaid \u201cthe class not-X will be determined by \nthe symbol \\(1-x\\)\u201d.\n This is the first appearance of subtraction\nin MAL. \nBoole\u2019s initial equational expressions of the\nAristotelian categorical propositions \n(MAL, pp. 21,22) will be called his\nprimary expressions. Then in the next several pages he adds\nsupplementary expressions; of these the main ones will be called the\nsecondary expressions.\n\n\nProposition\nPrimary Expression\nSecondary Expression\n\n\nAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(x = xy\\)\n\\(x = vy\\)\n\n\nNo \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(xy = 0\\)\n\\(x = v(1-y)\\)\n\n\nSome \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\\(v = xy\\)\n\\(vx = vy\\)\n\n\nSome \\(X\\) is not \\(Y\\)\n\\(v = x(1 - y)\\)\n\\(vx = v(1 - y)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe first primary expression given was for All \\(X\\) is\n\\(Y\\), an equation which he then converted into\n\\(x(1-y) = 0\\). This was the first appearance of\n0 in MAL. It was not introduced as the symbol for the empty\nclass\u2014indeed the empty class does not appear in MAL.\nEvidently \u201c\\(= 0\\)\u201d performed the role of a predicate in\nMAL, with an equation \\(E = 0\\) asserting that the class\ndenoted by \\(E\\) simply did not exist. (In LT, what we call the\nempty class was introduced and denoted by 0.)\n\n\n \nSyllogistic reasoning is just an exercise in elimination,\nnamely the middle term is eliminated from the premises to give the\nconclusion. Elimination is a standard topic in the theory of\nequations, and Boole borrowed a simple elimination result regarding\ntwo equations to use in his algebra of logic\u2014if the premises of\na syllogism involved the classes \\(X, Y\\), and\n\\(Z\\), and one wanted to eliminate the middle term \\(Y\\),\nthen Boole put the equations for the two premises in the form\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  ay + b &= 0 \\\\\n  cy + d &= 0\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(y\\) does not appear in the coefficients a,b,c,d.\nThe result of eliminating \\(y\\) in ordinary algebra gives the\nequation\n\n\\[\n  ad - bc = 0,\n\\]\n\n\n\nand this is what Boole used in MAL. Unfortunately this is a\nweak elimination result for Boole\u2019s algebra. One finds, using the\nimproved reduction and elimination theorems of LT, that the\nbest possible result of elimination is\n\n\\[\n(b^2 + d^2)[(a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 ] = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n \nApplying weak elimination to the primary equational expressions was not \nsufficient to derive all of the valid syllogisms. For example, in the cases \nwhere the premises had primary expressions \\(ay = 0\\) and \\(cy = 0\\),\nthis elimination gave \\(0 = 0\\), even when there was a non-trivial \nconclusion.  Boole introduced the alternative equational\nexpressions (see MAL, p. 32) of categorical propositions to\nbe able to derive all of the valid syllogisms. \n\n\nToward the end of the chapter on categorical syllogisms there is a\nlong footnote (MAL, pp. 42\u201345) claiming\n(MAL, pp. 42, 43) that secondary expressions alone are\nsufficient for the analysis of [his generalization of] Aristotelian\ncategorical logic. The footnote loses much of its force because the\nresults it presents depend heavily on the weak elimination theorem\nbeing best possible, which is not the case. Regarding the secondary\nexpressions, in the Postscript to MAL he says:\n\nThe system of equations there given for the expression of Propositions\nin Syllogism is always preferable to the one before\nemployed\u2014first, in generality\u2014secondly, in facility of\ninterpretation.\n\n\nHis justification of this claim would appear in LT. \nIndeed Boole used only the secondary expressions of MAL to \nexpress propositions as equations in LT, but there the \nreader will no longer find a leisurely and detailed treatment of Aristotelian logic\u2014the discussion of this subject is delayed until \nthe last chapter on logic, namely Chapter XV (the only one in LT to \nanalyze particular propositions). In this chapter the application of his\nalgebra of logic to Aristotelian logic is presented in such a compressed form \n(by omitting all details of \nthe reduction, elimination and solution steps), concluding with such long \nequations, that the reader is not likely to want to check that Boole\u2019s analysis is correct.\n\n3.7 Hypothetical Syllogisms\n\nOn p. 48 of MAL Boole said: \n\nA hypothetical Proposition is defined to be two or more\ncategoricals united by a copula (or conjunction), and the\ndifferent kinds of hypothetical Propositions are named from their\nrespective conjunctions, viz. conditional (if), disjunctive (either,\nor), &c.\n\n\nBoole analyzed the seven hypothetical syllogisms that were\nstandard in Aristotelian logic, from the Constructive and Destructive\nConditionals to the Complex Destructive Dilemma. Letting capital\nletters \\(X, Y, \\ldots\\) represent categorical propositions, the\nhypothetical propositions traditionally involved in\nhypothetical syllogisms were in one of the forms \\(X\\) is\ntrue, \\(X\\) is false, If \\(X\\) is true\nthen \\(Y\\) is true, \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true or \n\u2026, \nas well as \n\\(X\\) is true and \\(Y\\) is true and \u2026  \nAt the end of the\nchapter on hypothetical syllogisms he noted that it was easy to create\nnew ones, and one could enrich the collection by using mixed\nhypothetical propositions such as If \\(X\\) is true, then\neither \\(Y\\) is true, or \\(Z\\) is true. \n\nMost important in this chapter was Boole\u2019s \nclaim that his algebra of\nlogic for categorical propositions was equally suited to the study of\nhypothetical syllogisms. This was based on adopting the standard\nreduction of hypothetical propositions to propositions about classes\nby letting the hypothetical universe, also denoted by 1, \n\u201ccomprehend all conceivable\ncases and conjunctures of circumstances\u201d.\nEvidently his notion of a case \nwas an assignment of truth values to the propositional variables.\nFor \\(X\\) a categorical proposition Boole let \\(x\\) denote the elective\noperator that selects the cases for which \\(X\\) is true.  \n\n Boole said the universe of a categorical proposition has two\ncases, true and false. To find an equational\nexpression for a hypothetical proposition Boole resorted to a near\nrelative of truth tables (MAL, p. 50). To each case, that is,\nassignment of truth values to \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), he associated an\nelective expression as follows:\n\n\nCases\nElective Expressions\n\n\nX true, Y true\n\\(xy\\)\n\n\nX true, Y false\n\\(x(1- y)\\)\n\n\nX false, Y true\n\\((1 - x)y\\)\n\n\nX false, Y false\n\\((1 - x)(1 - y)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThese elective expressions are, of course, the constituents\nof \\(x\\), \\(y\\).\n\n\n\nBoole expressed a propositional formula \\(\\Phi(X,Y, \\ldots)\\) by\nan elective equation \\(\\phi(x,y, \\ldots)\\) = 1 by ascertaining all the\ndistinct cases (assignments of truth values) for which the formula\nholds,\nand summing their corresponding elective expressions to obtain \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\nFor example, the elective expression for \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true, with\nor inclusive, is thus \\(xy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 1\\),\nwhich simplifies to \\(x + y - xy = 1\\). \n\n\n\nBoole did not have the modern view that a propositional formula can be\nconsidered as a function on the truth values \\(\\{\\rT, \\rF\\}\\), taking \nvalues in \\(\\{\\rT,\\rF\\}\\).\n \nThe function viewpoint gives us an algorithm to determine which\nconstituents are to be summed to give the desired elective expression,\nnamely those constituents associated with the cases for which the\npropositional formula has the value \\(\\rT\\).  \n\n\nBy not viewing propositional formulas as functions on \\(\\{\\)T, F\\(\\}\\) Boole\nmissed out on being the inventor of truth tables. His algebraic\nmethod of analyzing hypothetical syllogisms was to transform each of\nthe hypothetical premises into an elective equation, and then apply\nhis algebra of logic (which was developed for categorical\npropositions). For example, the premises \\(X\\) is true\nor \\(Y\\) is true, with or inclusive, and \\(X\\) is false \nare expressed by the equations\n\\(x + y - xy = 1\\) and\n\\(x = 0\\). From these it immediately follows that\n\\(y = 1\\), giving the conclusion\n\\(Y\\) is true.\n\n\n\nBoole only considered rather simple hypothetical propositions on the\ngrounds these were the only ones encountered in common usage (see\nLT, p. 172). His algebraic approach to propositional logic\nis easily extended to all propositional formulas as follows. For\n\\(\\Phi\\) a propositional formula the associated elective function\n\\(\\Phi^*\\) is defined recursively as follows:\n\n\n\\(0^* = 0\\); \\(1^* = 1\\); \\(X^* = x\\);\n\\((\\text{not-}\\Phi)^* = 1 - \\Phi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ and } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ or } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* + \\Psi^* - \\Phi^* \\cdot\n\\Psi^*\\), \u00a0where \u201cor\u201d is inclusive;\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ or } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* + \\Psi^* - 2\\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^*\\),\n\u00a0where \u201cor\u201d is exclusive; \n\\((\\Phi \\text{ implies } \\Psi)^* = 1 - \\Phi^* + \\Phi^* \\cdot\n\\Psi^*\\);\n\\((\\Phi \\text{ iff } \\Psi)^* = \\Phi^* \\cdot \\Psi^* + (1 - \\Phi^*)\n\\cdot(1 - \\Psi^*)\\).\n\n\nThen one has:\n\n\\(\\Phi\\) is a tautology iff \\(\\Phi^* = 1\\) \nis valid in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n\\(\\Phi_1\\), ... , \\(\\Phi_k \\therefore \\Phi\\) is valid in\npropositional logic iff \\(\\Phi_{1}^* = 1, \\ldots , \\Phi_{k}^* = 1\n\\therefore \\Phi^* = 1\\) is valid in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n\n\n\nThis looks quite different from modern propositional logic where one\ntakes a few tautologies, such as \\(X \\rightarrow(Y \\rightarrow X)\\), as axioms, and inference rules such as modus ponens to\nform a deductive system. \n\nThis translation, from \\(\\Phi\\) to \\(\\Phi^*\\), viewed as mapping\nexpressions from modern Boolean algebra to polynomials, would be\npresented in the 1933 paper Characteristic functions and the algebra of logic\n by Hassler Whitney (1907\u20131989), with\nthe objective of showing that one does not need to learn the algebra\nof logic [modern Boolean algebra] to verify the equational laws and\nequational arguments of Boolean algebra\u2014they can be translated\ninto the ordinary algebra with which one is familiar. Howard Aiken\n(1900\u20131973), Director of the Harvard Computation Laboratory,\nwould use such translations of logical functions into ordinary algebra\nin his 1951 book Synthesis of Electronic Computing and Control\nCircuits, specifically stating that he preferred Boole\u2019s\nnumerical function approach to that of Boolean algebra or\npropositional logic.\n\n3.8 General Theorems of Boole\u2019s Algebra in MAL\n\n\nBeginning with the chapter Properties of Elective Functions, Boole \ndeveloped general theorems for working with elective functions and equations\n in his algebra of logic\u2014the Expansion (or Development) \nTheorem (described above in Section 3.5) and the properties of constituents \nare discussed in this chapter. \nHe used the power series expansion of an elective function in his proof of the \none-variable \ncase of the Expansion Theorem (MAL, p. 60), perhaps intending to apply it \nto rational elective functions. \n\nThe operation of division with polynomial \nfunctions was introduced in MAL but never successfully developed \nin his algebra of logic\u2014there are no equational \nlaws for how to deal with division. It was abandoned in LT \nexcept for being \nfrequently used as a mnemonic device when solving a polynomial equation. \n \nFrom the Expansion Theorem and the properties of constituents he showed that the\nmodulii of the sum/difference/product of two elective functions are\nthe sums/differences/products of the corresponding modulii of the two\nfunctions. \n\n\nThe Expansion Theorem is used (MAL, p. 61) to prove an important result, \nthat p(x) and q(x) are equivalent in Boole\u2019s algebra if and only if corresponding \nmodulii are the same, that is, \\(p(1)=q(1)\\) and \\(p(0)=q(0)\\). This result \ngeneralizes to functions of several variables. It will not be stated as such in \nLT, but will be absorbed in the much more general (if somewhat opaquely \nstated) result that will be called the Rule of 0 and 1.\n\n\nUsing the Expansion Theorem Boole showed (MAL, p. 64)\nthat every elective equation \\(p = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection\nof constituent equations \\(r = 0\\) where the modulus (coefficient) of\n\\(r\\) in the expansion of \\(p\\) is not zero, and thus every\nelective equation is interpretable. Furthermore this led\n(MAL, p. 65) to the fact that \\(p = 0\\) is equivalent to the\nequation \\(q = 0\\) where \\(q\\) is the sum of the constituents in the\nexpansion of \\(p\\) whose modulus is non-zero. \n\n  As examples, consider\nthe equations \\(x + y = 0\\) and \\(x - y = 0\\). The following table\ngives the constituents and modulii of the expansions:\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(y\\)\nconstituents\n\\(x + y\\)\n\\(x - y\\)\n\n\n1\n1\n\\(xy\\)\n2\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n\\(x(1 - y)\\)\n1\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n\\((1 - x)y\\)\n1\n\\(-1\\)\n\n\n0\n0\n\\((1 - x)(1 - y)\\)\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThus \\(x + y = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection of constituent\nequations \n\n\\[\nxy = 0,\\ x(1 - y) = 0,\\ (1 - x)y = 0\n\\]\n\nas well as to the single equation\n\n\\[\nxy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 0,\n\\]\n\nand \\(x - y = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection of constituent\nequations \n\n\\[\nx(1 - y) = 0,\\ (1 - x)y = 0\n\\]\n\nas well as to the single equation\n\n\\[\nx(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe Solution Theorem described how to solve an elective equation \nfor one of its symbols in terms of the others, often introducing constraint\nequations on the independent variables. In his algebra of logic he could always \nsolve an elective equation for any one of its elective symbols. For example, \nthe equation \\(q(x)y = p(x)\\) was solved by using formal division \n \\(y = p(x)/q(x)\\) and then using formal expansion to obtain \\(y = ax + b(1-x)\\)\nwhere \\(a = p(1)/q(1)\\) and \\(b = p(0)/q(0)\\), and then decoding the\nfractional coefficients. This theorem will be discussed in more detail in \nStep 7 of Section 6.2. \n\n\nBoole\u2019s final example (MAL, p. 78) was solving three\nequations in three unknowns for one of the unknowns in terms of the\nother two.  This example used a well known technique for handling side\nconditions in analysis called Lagrange Multipliers\u2014this method\n(which reduced the three equations in the example to a single equation\nin five unknowns) reappeared in LT (p. 117), but was only\nused once.  It was superseded by the sum of squares reduction\n(LT, p. 121) which does not introduce new variables.  Using\nthe Reduction and Elimination Theorems in LT one discovers\nthat Boole\u2019s constraint equations (3) (MAL, p. 80) for\nhis three equation example are much too weak\u2014each of the\nproducts should be 0, and there are additional constraint equations.\n\n\nMAL shows more clearly than LT how closely Boole\u2019s\nalgebra of logic is based on Common Algebra plus the idempotent law. \nThe Elimination Theorem that he borrowed from common algebra\nturned out to be weaker than what his algebra offered, and his method\nof reducing equations to a single equation was clumsier than the main\none used in LT, but the Expansion Theorem and Solution\nTheorem were the same. One sees that MAL contained not only\nthe basic outline for LT, but also some parts fully\ndeveloped. Power series were not completely abandoned in LT\u2014they\nappeared, but only in a footnote (LT, p. 72).\n4. The Laws of Thought (1854)\n\nThe logic portion of \nBoole\u2019s second logic book, An Investigation \nof The Laws of Thought\non which are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and\nProbabilities, published in 1854, \nwould \nbe devoted to trying to clarify and\ncorrect what was said in MAL, and providing more\nsubstantial applications, the main one being his considerable work in\nprobability theory.\n At the end of Chapter I Boole mentioned the theoretical\npossibility of using probability theory, enhanced by his algebra of\nlogic, to uncover fundamental laws governing society by analyzing large\nquantities of social data by large numbers of (human) computers. \n\n\n\nBoole used lower case Latin letters at the end of the alphabet, like \\(x,y,z\\), to represent classes. The universe was a class, denoted by 1; and there was\na class described as \u201cNothing\u201d, \ndenoted by 0,\nwhich we call the empty class. The operation of\nmultiplication was defined to be what we call intersection, and this led\nto his first law, \\(xy = yx\\), and then to the\nidempotent law \\(x^2 = x\\). Addition was introduced as\naggregation when the classes were disjoint. He stated the commutative\nlaw for addition, \\(x + y = y + x\\), and the distributive law \\(z(x +\ny) = zx + zy\\). Then followed \\(x - y = - y + x\\) and \\(z(x - y) = zx\n- zy\\). The associative laws for addition and multiplication were\nconspicuously absent. \n\n\nThe idempotent law \\(x^2 = x\\) was different from Boole\u2019s \nlaws for the common algebra\u2014it only applied to the\nindividual class symbols, not in general to compound terms that one\ncould build from these symbols.  For example, one does not have \n\\((x + y)^2 = x + y\\) in Boole\u2019s system, otherwise \n by ordinary\nalgebra with idempotent class symbols, this would imply \\(2xy = 0\\),\nand then \\(xy = 0\\), which would force \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to represent\ndisjoint classes. But it is not the case that every pair of classes is\ndisjoint. \n\n\nIt was this equational argument, that \\((x + y)^2 = x + y\\) implies \\(xy = 0\\), that  led Boole to view addition \\(x + y\\) as a partial operation, only defined \nwhen \\(xy = 0\\), that is, when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are disjoint classes. \nThe only place where he wrote down this argument was in his unpublished\nnotes\u2014see \nBoole: Selected Manuscripts \u2026, 1997,\nedited by Ivor Grattan-Guiness and G\u00e9rard Bornet, pp. 91,92.\nA similar equational argument, that \\((x - y)^2 = x - y\\) implies \\(y = xy\\), led \nto \\(x - y\\) being only defined when \\(y = xy\\), that is, when \\(y = x \\cap y\\), \nwhich is the same as \\(y \\subseteq x\\).\n\nIt was not until p. 66 of LT that Boole clearly informed the reader that \naddition, which had been introduced on p. 33, was a partial operation on \nclasses: \n\nThe expression \\(x+y\\) seems indeed uninterpretable, \nunless it is assumed that\nthe things represented by \\(x\\) and the things represented by \\(y\\) are entirely\nseparate; that they embrace no individuals in common.\n\n\nA similar statement about subtraction being a partial operation did not appear\nuntil p. 93:\n\nThe latter function presupposes, as a condition of its interpretation,\nthat the class represented by \\(y\\) is wholly contained in the class represented \nby \\(x\\).\n\n\nHere the \u201clatter function\u201d means\n\\(x-y\\). The dispersion of relevant facts about a topic, such as definitions of\nthe fundamental operations of addition and subtraction, is not helpful to the \nreader. \n\nAnother example of the need for caution when working with partial algebras is \nhow important it was that Boole chose the fundamental operation minus to be \nbinary subtraction, and not the unary operation of additive inverse that is \nstandard in ring theory. Note that the standard operations union, symmetric\ndifference, intersection \nand complement of the Boolean algebra of classes are definable in Boole\u2019s partial-algebra by totally defined terms\u2014he used these to be able to express propositions about classes by equations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx \\cup y &:= x + (1-x)y \\\\\nx \\triangle y &:= x(1-y) + (1-x)y \\\\\nx \\cap y &:= xy \\\\\nx' &:= 1-x.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSubtraction was needed to find a totally defined term, namely \\(1-x\\), \nthat expresses the complement of \\(x\\). The term \\(1+(-x)\\), like \\(-x\\),\n is only defined for \\(x=0\\) in Boole\u2019s \npartial-algebra. \n\nThe same three equations define the Boolean algebra of classes in the standard\nBoolean ring of classes where addition is symmetric difference, except in this \ncase subtraction is a derived operation, namely \\(1-x\\) is defined to be\n \\(1 + (-x)\\), the unary minus \nbeing a fundamental operation in the Boolean ring, indeed in any ring.\n\n\nOne might expect that Boole was building toward claiming an axiomatic\nfoundation for his algebra of logic that, as he had (erroneously)\nclaimed in MAL,\njustified using all the processes of common algebra.\nIndeed he did discuss the rules of inference, that adding or\nsubtracting equals from equals gives equals, and multiplying equals by\nequals gives equals. But then the development of an axiomatic\napproach came to an abrupt halt. There was no discussion as to whether\nthe stated axioms (which he called laws) and rules of inference (which he\ncalled axioms) were sufficient for  his algebra of\nlogic. (They were not.) Instead he simply and briefly, with\nremarkably little fanfare, presented a radically new foundation for\nhis algebra of logic (LT pp. 37,38):\n\nLet us conceive then of an algebra in which the \nsymbols \\(x, y, z\\), \n&c. admit indifferently of the values 0 and 1, and of \nthese values alone. The laws, the axioms, and the processes, of such an Algebra \nwill be identical in their whole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the processes \nof an Algebra of Logic. Difference of interpretation will alone divide them. \nUpon this principle the method of the following work is established.\n\n\nNote that this algebra restricted the values of the variables to 0 and 1,\nbut placed no such restriction on the values of terms. There was no assertion\nthat this was to be a two-element algebra. Burris and Sankappanavar (2013) \nviewed the quote as saying that this algebra was just the ordinary \nalgebra of numbers modified by restricting the variables to the values 0 and 1 \nto determine the validity of an argument. They called this \nBoole\u2019s Rule of 0 and 1, \nand said he used this Rule to justify three of his main theorems \n(Expansion, Reduction, Elimination). These main theorems \nalong with the Solution Theorem yielded Boole\u2019s\nGeneral Method for discovering the strongest possible consequences of\npropositional premises under certain desired constraints (such as\neliminating some of the variables). Further comments on this \nRule are below in Section 5.2. \n\n\nIn Chapter V he defended the use of uninterpretables in his\nwork; as part of his justification for the use of uninterpretable\nsteps in symbolic algebra he pointed to the well known use of\n\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) to obtain trigonometric identities. \nUnfortunately his Principles of Symbolical\nReasoning do not, in general, apply to partial algebras, that is,\nwhere some of the operations are only partially defined, such as\naddition and subtraction in Boole\u2019s algebra. \nNonetheless it turns out one can prove \nthat they do apply to his algebra of logic. In succeeding chapters he\ngave the Expansion Theorem, the new full-strength Elimination Theorem,\nan improved Reduction Theorem, and the Solution Theorem where formal division \nand formal expansion were used to solve an\nequation.\n\n\nBoole turned to the topic of the interpretability of a\nlogical function in Chapter VI Section 13. \nHe had already stated in MAL that every equation is\ninterpretable (by showing an equation was equivalent to a collection of\nconstituent equations). However algebraic terms need not be interpretable, e.g.,\n\\(1+1\\) is not interpretable. Some terms are partially interpretable,\nand equivalent terms can have distinct domains of interpretability.\n  In Chapter VI \nSection 13, he\ncomes to the conclusion that the condition for a polynomial \\(p\\) to be\nequivalent to a (totally) interpretable function is that it\nsatisfy \\(p^2 = p\\), in which case it is equivalent to a sum of\ndistinct constituents, namely those belonging to the non-vanishing\nmodulii of \\(p\\). A polynomial is idempotent if and only if\nall of its modulii are idempotent, that is, they are in \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\),\nin which case the expansion of the polynomial is a sum of distinct\nconstituents (or it is 0).\n\nBoole\u2019s Chapter XI Of Secondary Propositions is parallel to the treatment\nin MAL except that he changed from using the cases\nwhen \\(X\\) is true to the times when \\(X\\) is\ntrue. In Chapter XIII Boole selected arguments\nof Clarke and Spinoza, on the nature of an eternal being, to put under\nthe magnifying glass of his algebra of logic, starting with the\ncomment (LT, p. 185):\n\n2. The chief practical difficulty of this inquiry will\nconsist, not in the application of the method to the premises once\ndetermined, but in ascertaining what the premises\nare.\nOne conclusion was (LT, p. 216):\n\n19. It is not possible, I think, to rise from the\nperusal of the arguments of Clarke and Spinoza without a deep\nconviction of the futility of all endeavours to establish, entirely a\npriori, the existence of an Infinite Being, His attributes, and His\nrelation to the universe.\n\n\nIn the final chapter on logic, Chapter XV, Boole presented his\nanalysis of the conversions and syllogisms of Aristotelian logic. \n\nHe now considered this ancient logic to be a weak, fragmented attempt at a\nlogical system. \n\nThis neglected chapter is quite interesting\nbecause it is the only chapter where he analyzed particular\npropositions, making essential use of additional letters like\n\\(v\\) to encode some. \n\nThis is also the chapter where he stated (incompletely) the rules for working\nwith some.\n\n\nBoole noted in Chapter XV of LT that when a premise about \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nis expressed as an equation involving \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(v\\), the symbol \\(v\\) expressed some, but\nonly in the context in which it appeared in the premise. For example,\nAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\) has the \nexpression \\(x = vy\\), which implies \\(vx = vy\\). \nThis could be interpreted as Some \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\). \nA consequence of \\(vx = vy\\) is \\(v(1-x) = v(1-y)\\). \nHowever it was not permitted to read\nthis as Some not-\\(X\\) is not-\\(Y\\) since\n\\(v\\) did not appear with \\(1-x\\) or\n\\(1-y\\) in the premise. \n\n\n\nIn Chapter XV Boole gave the reader a brief summary of traditional\nAristotelian categorical logic, and analyzed some simple examples\nusing ad hoc techniques with his algebra of logic. Then he launched\ninto proving a comprehensive result by applying his General Method to\nthe pair of equations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= v'y \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis was the case of like middle terms.\nHe permitted some of the parameters \\(v, v', w, w'\\) to be replaced by 1,\nbut not both \\(v, v'\\) and not both \\(w, w'\\) can be replaced by 1.\nOne could also replace \\(y\\) by \\(1-y\\) in both equations, and independently \nreplace \\(x\\) by \\(1-x\\) and \\(z\\) by \\(1-z\\).\nThe premises of many categorical syllogisms can be expressed in\nthis form. His goal was to eliminate \\(y\\) and find expressions for\n\\(x, 1-x\\) and \\(vx\\) in terms of \\(z, v, v', w, w'\\). \n\nBoole omitted writing out the reduction of the pair of equations to a single\nequation, as well as the elimination of the middle term \\(y\\) from this \nequation and the details of applying the Solution Theorem to obtain the\ndesired expressions for \\(x, 1-x\\) and \\(vx\\), \nthree equations involving large algebraic expressions. \n\nHis summary of the interpretation of this rather complicated algebraic \nanalysis was simply that in the case of like middle terms with at least one\nmiddle term universal, equate the extremes. For example the premises\nAll \\(y\\) is \\(x\\) and Some \\(z\\) is \\(y\\) are expressed by the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= y \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus the conclusion equation is \\(vx = wz\\), which has the interpretation\nSome \\(x\\) is \\(z\\). \n\nThen he noted that the remaining categorical syllogisms are such that \ntheir premises can be put in the form:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nvx &= v'y \\\\\nwz &= w'(1-y).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is the case of unlike middle terms.\nThis led to another triple of large equations, again with details of the\nderivation omitted, but briefly summarized by Boole in two recipes.\n\nFirst, in the case of unlike middle terms with at least one universal\nextreme, change the quantity and quality of that extreme and equate it to \nthe other extreme. For example the premises\nAll \\(x\\) is not-\\(y\\) and Some \\(z\\) is \\(y\\) gives the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n x &= v'(1-y) \\\\\n wz &= w'y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus the conclusion equation is \\(v(1-x) = wz\\), which has the interpretation\nSome not-\\(x\\) is \\(z\\). \n\nSecondly, in the case of unlike middle terms, both of which are universal,\nchange the quantity and quality of one extreme and equate it to \nthe other extreme. For example the premises\nAll not-\\(y\\) is \\(x\\) and All \\(y\\) is \\(z\\) gives the \npair of equations \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n vx &= (1-y) \\\\\n wz &= y.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus one conclusion equation is \\(1-x = wz\\), which has the interpretation \nAll not-\\(x\\) is \\(z\\).\nThe other is \\(vx = 1-z\\), which has the interpretation\nAll not-\\(z\\) is \\(x\\). Each of these two propositions is just the\nconversion by negation of the other.\n \n\nBoole noted (LT p. 237) that: \n\nThe process of investigation by which they are deduced will probably\nappear to be of needless complexity; and it is certain that they might\nhave been obtained with greater facility, and without the aid of any\nsymbolical instrument whatever.\n\n5. Later Developments\n5.1 Objections to Boole\u2019s Algebra of Logic\n\nMany objections to Boole\u2019s system have been published over the years;\nfour among the most important concern:\n\nthe dependency on Common Algebra,\nthe use of uninterpretable expressions in derivations,\nthe treatment of particular propositions by equations, and\nthe method of dealing with division.\n\n\nFor example, Boole\u2019s use of \\(v\\) in the\nequational expression of propositions has been a long-standing bone of\ncontention. \nErnst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902) \nargued in Volume II of his\nAlgebra der Logik (1891, p. 91) that the particular \n propositions about classes simply could not be expressed by equations in the \nalgebra of logic. \n\n\nWe look at a different objection, namely at the Boole/Jevons dispute\nover adding \\(x + x = x\\) as a law. \n\n[The following details are from The development of the theories\nof mathematical logic and the principles of mathematics, William\nStanley Jevons, by Philip Jourdain, 1914.]\n\n\nIn an 1863 letter to Boole regarding a draft of a commentary on\nBoole\u2019s system that Jevons was considering for his forthcoming book\n(Pure Logic, 1864), Jevons said:\n\nIt is surely obvious, however, that \\(x+x\\) is equivalent only to\n\\(x,\\ldots\\);\n\nProfessor Boole\u2019s notation [process of subtraction] is\ninconsistent with a self-evident law.\n\nIf my view be right, his system will come to be regarded as a\nmost remarkable combination of truth and error.\n\nBoole replied:\n\nThus the equation \\(x + x = 0\\) is equivalent to the equation \\(x =\n0\\); but the expression \\(x + x\\) is not equivalent to the expression\n\\(x\\).\n\nJevons responded by asking if Boole could deny the truth of \\(x + x = x\\).\n\nBoole, clearly exasperated, replies:\n\nTo be explicit, I now, however, reply that it is not true that in\nLogic \\(x + x = x\\), though it is true that \\(x + x = 0\\) is\nequivalent to \\(x = 0\\). If I do not write more it is not from any\nunwillingness to discuss the subject with you, but simply because if\nwe differ on this fundamental point it is impossible that we should\nagree in others.\n\nJevons\u2019s final effort to get Boole to understand the issue was:\n\nI do not doubt that it is open to you to hold \u2026[that \\(x + x =\nx\\) is not true] according to the laws of your system, and with this\nexplanation your system probably is perfectly consistent with itself\n\u2026 But the question then becomes a wider one\u2014does your\nsystem correspond to the Logic of common thought?\n\nJevons\u2019s new law, \\(x + x = x\\), resulted from\nhis conviction that + should denote what we now call\nunion, where the membership of \\(x + y\\) is given by an\ninclusive or. Boole simply did not see any way to define\n\\(x + y\\) as a class unless \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nwere disjoint, as already noted.\n\nVarious explanations have been given as to why Boole could not\ncomprehend the possibility of Jevons\u2019s suggestion. Boole clearly had\nthe semantic concept of union\u2014he expressed the union\nof \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as \\(x + (1-x)y\\), a sum of two disjoint classes, and\npointed out that the elements of this class are the ones that belong\nto either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) or both. So how could he so\ncompletely fail to see the possibility of taking union for his\nfundamental operation + instead of his curious partial union\noperation?\n\nThe answer is simple: the law \\(x + x = x\\) would have destroyed his\nability to use ordinary algebra: from \\(x + x = x\\) one\nhas, by ordinary algebra, \\(x = 0\\). This would force every class\nsymbol to denote the empty class. Jevons\u2019s proposed law \\(x + x\n= x\\) was simply not true if one was committed to constructing the\nalgebra of logic on top of the laws and inference rules of ordinary\nalgebra. (Boolean rings satisfy all the laws of ordinary algebra, but not all\nof the inferences, for example, \\(2x = 0\\) implies \\(x = 0\\) does\nnot hold in Boolean rings.) It seems quite possible that Boole found\nthe simplest way to construct a model\u2014whose \ndomain was classes contained\nin the universe of discourse\u2014for an algebra of logic that\nallowed one to use all the equations and equational arguments\nthat were valid for numbers. \n5.2 Modern Reconstruction of Boole\u2019s System\n\nA popular misconception is that Boole\u2019s algebra of logic is the\nBoolean algebra of classes with the usual operations of union,\nintersection and complement. This error was forcefully pointed out by\nHailperin in his 1981 paper \u201cBoole\u2019s algebra isn\u2019t\nBoolean algebra,\u201d a theme repeated in his path-breaking book\nBoole\u2019s Logic and Probability (1986).  Nonetheless the\ngoal of the two algebras, Boole\u2019s algebra and Boolean algebra,\nis the same, to provide an equational logic for the calculus of\nclasses and for propositional logic.  Thanks to Hailperin\u2019s\nwritings, for the first time there was clarity as to why Boole\u2019s\nalgebra gave correct results. \n\nIn his 1959 JSL review article Michael Dummett said:\n\nanyone unacquainted with Boole\u2019s works will receive an\nunpleasant surprise when he discovers how ill constructed his theory\nactually was and how confused his explanations of it.\n\n\nFor example, one does not find a clear statement \n of what Boole meant by equivalent or interpretable. \nFor those familiar with partial algebras the latter word can easily \nbe taken to mean is defined\u2014the domain of\ndefinition of an algebraic term has a recursive definition, just as  \nalgebraic term has a recursive definition. After verifying examples like those\nin LT that show Boole\u2019s algebraic methods \ngive correct results for propositions about classes, the challenge for those\nwho want to make sense of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic\n is to make \nenough of the foundations of Boole\u2019s \nalgebra sufficiently precise so as to be able to justify the algebraic \nprocedures he used. \n\nIn LT Boole gave detailed instructions on how to use his algebra to obtain valid propositional conclusions from propositional premises about classes when the propositions were universal. (He avoided particular propositions until Chapter XV, the last chapter of  LT on logic.) He showed how to express English language propositions as equations, the steps needed to obtain desired conclusion equations, and how they are to be interpreted as conclusion propositions to the premises. The algebraic steps can be lengthy and he gave some shortcuts in Chapter IX, but we now know that any method to carry out such deductions will confront a complexity of computation that grows rapidly with the number of propositional variables. \n\nAs stated in Dummett\u2019s comment above, Boole was anything but clear as to why his algebra worked as claimed, to give best possible conclusions to premises. This has inspired considerable commentary on what Boole meant to say, or should have said, and to what extent his justifications are valid. \n\nJevons (1864) gave sharp criticisms on the shortcomings of \nBoole\u2019s algebra of logic and abandoned it to create the first\nversion of modern Boolean algebra. (He did not have the unary complement operation\nthat is now standard, but instead used De Morgan\u2019s convention that the complement of a class \\(A\\) is \\(a\\).)\nThe title of Jevon\u2019s 1864 book\nstarted out with the words Pure Logic, referring to the fact\nthat his version of the algebra of logic had been cleansed from\nconnections to the algebra of numbers. The same point would be made in\nthe introduction to Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica, that they had adopted the notation of Peano in part\nto free their work from such connections. \n\nAccording to Hailperin(1986), the proof-theoretic side of Boole\u2019s algebra is simply that of non-trivial commutative rings with unit and distinguished idempotent elements, but without non-zero additively or multiplicatively nilpotent elements. His favorite models were rings of signed multi-sets and he used them to \nexplain why Boole\u2019s theorems are correct for the algebra of \nlogic of universal propositions. (Hailperin\u2019s analysis did not apply to particular propositions.)\n\n Frank W. Brown\u2019s paper \nGeorge Boole\u2019s deductive system (2009) \nclaims that one can avoid Hailperin\u2019s signed multi-sets \nby working with the ring of polynomials Z[X] modulo a certain ideal. \n\nBurris and Sankappanavar (2013) use the fact that \nBoole\u2019s model, a partial-algebra, is isomorphic to the \nrestriction of the operations of addition, multiplication and subtraction in the\nring \\(Z^U\\) to the idempotent elements of the ring. Here \\(Z\\) is the ring of\nintegers, and \\(U\\) is the universe of discourse.\n\nFrom this one can deduce that any Horn sentence which holds in \\(Z\\) when the variables are restricted to 0 and 1 will hold in \\(Z^U\\) when the variables are restricted to idempotent elements, and thus will hold in Boole\u2019s partial-algebra.  This gives an expanded version of Boole\u2019s Rule of \n0 and 1, and since his main results (Expansion, Reduction, Elimination and Solution) can be expressed by such Horn sentences, one has a quick\nproof that they are indeed valid. \n\n6. Boole\u2019s Methods\n\n\nWhile reading through this section, on the technical details of\nBoole\u2019s methods, the reader may find it useful to consult the\n\nsupplement of examples from Boole\u2019s two books.\n\n\nThese examples have been augmented with comments explaining, in each\nstep of a derivation by Boole, which aspect of his methods is being\nemployed. \n6.1 The Three Methods of Argument Analysis Used by Boole in LT\n\nBoole used three methods to analyze arguments in LT:\n\nThe first was the purely ad hoc algebraic manipulations that\nwere used (in conjunction with a weak version of the Elimination\nTheorem) on the Aristotelian arguments in MAL.\nSecondly, in section 15 of Chapter II of LT, one finds\nthe method that, in this article, is called the Rule of 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nThe theorems of LT combine to yield the master result,\n\nBoole\u2019s General Method (in this article it will always be referred\nto using capitalized first letters\u2014Boole just called it \u201ca\nmethod\u201d).\n\n\n\nWhen applying the ad hoc method, he used ordinary algebra\nalong with the idempotent law \\(x^2 = x\\) to\nmanipulate equations. There was no pre-established procedure to\nfollow\u2014success with this method depended on intuitive skills\ndeveloped through experience.\n\n\nThe second method, the Rule of 0 and 1, is very powerful, but it\ndepends on being given a collection of premise equations and a\nconclusion equation. It is a truth-table like method (but Boole never\ndrew a table when applying the method) to determine if the argument is\ncorrect. He only used this method to establish the theorems that\njustified his General Method, even though it is an excellent tool for\nverifying simple arguments like syllogisms. Boole was mainly\ninterested in finding the most general conclusion from given premises,\nmodulo certain conditions, and aside from his general theorems, showed\nno interest in simply verifying logical arguments. The Rule of 0 and\n1 is a somewhat shadowy figure in LT\u2014it has no name,\nand is reformulated in Section 6 of Chapter V as a procedure to use when \ncarrying out a derivation and encountering uninterpretable terms. \n\n\nThe third method to analyze arguments was the highlight of Boole\u2019s\nwork in logic, his General Method (discussed immediately after this).\nThis is the one he used for all but the simplest examples in\nLT; for the simplest examples he resorted to the first method\nof ad hoc algebraic techniques because, for one skilled in algebraic\nmanipulations, using them is usually far more efficient than going\nthrough the General Method.\n\n\nThe final version (from LT) of his General Method for\nanalyzing arguments is, briefly stated, to:\n\nexpress the premise propositions as equations,\napply a prescribed sequence of algebraic processes to the\nequations, processes which yield desired conclusion equations, and\nthen\ninterpret the equational conclusions as propositional\nconclusions, yielding the desired consequences of the original\ncollection of propositions.\n\n With this method Boole had replaced the art of reasoning from\npremise propositions to conclusion propositions by a routine mechanical\nalgebraic procedure. On p. 240 of LT he said that it was always \ntheoretically possible to carry out elimination by piecing together \nsyllogisms, but there was no method (i.e., algorithm) given for doing this.\n\n\nIn LT Boole divided propositions into two kinds, primary\nand secondary. These correspond to, but are not exactly the same as,\nthe Aristotelian division into categorical and hypothetical\npropositions. First we discuss his General Method applied to primary\npropositions. \n6.2. Boole\u2019s General Method for Primary Propositions\n\nBoole recognized three \u201cgreat leading types\u201d of primary propositions (LT, p. 64):\n\nAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\nAll \\(X\\) is all \\(Y\\)\nSome \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\n\n\n\nThese were his version of the Aristotelian categorical propositions,\nwhere \\(X\\) is the subject term and \\(Y\\) the predicate term. The\nterms \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) could be complex, for example, \\(X\\) could\nbe \u201cEither \\(u\\) and not-\\(v\\), or else \\(w\\)\u201d. For Boole such terms were not very complicated, at most a disjunction  \nof conjunctions of simple terms and their contraries, no doubt a reflection\nof the fact that natural language terms are not very complex.\n\nSTEP 1: Propositional terms were expressed by algebraic terms as \nin the following; one can substitute more complex terms for \\(x\\), \\(y\\). Boole \ndid not give a recursive definition, only some simple examples:\n\n\nTerms\nMAL \nLT \n\n\nuniverse\n1\np.15\n1\np.48\n\n\nempty class\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n0\np.47\n\n\nnot \\(x\\)\n\\(1 - x\\)\np.20\n\\(1 - x\\)\np.48\n\n\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(xy\\)\np.16\n\\(xy\\)\np.28\n\n\n\\(x\\) or \\(y\\) (inclusive)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\\(x + y(1 - x)\\)\n\n\\(xy + x(1 - y) + y(1- x)\\)\n\np.56\n\n\n\\(x\\) or \\(y\\) (exclusive)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\\(x(1 - y) + y(1 - x)\\)\np.56\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: Having expressed the propositional terms as algebraic terms,\none then expressed the propositions as equations using the\nfollowing; again one can substitute more complex terms for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), but not for \\(v\\):\n\n\nPrimaryPropositions\nMAL (1847)\nLT (1854)\n\n\nAll \\(x\\) is \\(y\\)\n\\(x(1-y) = 0\\)\np.26\n\\(x = vy\\)\npp.64,152\n\n\nNo \\(x\\) is \\(y\\)\n\\(xy = 0\\)\n\n(not primary)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\nAll \\(x\\) is all \\(y\\)\n(not primary)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\\(x = y\\)\n\n\n\nSome \\(x\\) is \\(y\\)\n\\(v = xy\\)\n\n\\(vx = vy\\)\n\n\n\nSome \\(x\\) is not \\(y\\)\n\\(v = x(1-y)\\)\n\n(not primary)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\nIn LT, prior to chapter XV, the one on Aristotelian logic, Boole\u2019s\nexamples only used universal propositions. (One can speculate that he\nhad encountered difficulties with particular propositions and avoided\nthem.) Those of the form All x is y were first expressed\nas \\(x = vy\\), and then \\(v\\) was promptly eliminated, giving \\(x =\nxy\\). (Similarly if \\(x\\) was replaced by not-\\(x\\), etc.) Boole said\nthe elimination of \\(v\\) was a convenient but unnecessary step. For the examples of \nAll x is y in\nthe first fourteen chapters he could simply have used the expression\n\\(x = xy\\), skipping the use of the parameter \\(v\\). \n\n\nTo simplify the\nnotation he used the same letter, say \\(v\\), for some when there were\nseveral universal premises, an incorrect step if one accepts\nBoole\u2019s claim that it is not necessary to eliminate the\n\\(v\\)\u2019s immediately. Distinct universal propositions require\ndifferent \\(v\\)\u2019s in their translation; else one can run into\nthe following situation. Consider the two premises All \\(x\\) is\n\\(z\\) and All \\(y\\) is \\(z\\). Using the same\n\\(v\\) for their equational expressions gives \\(x = vz\\) and \\(y =\nvz\\), leading to the equation \\(x = y\\), and then to the false\nconclusion \\(x\\) equals \\(y\\). In chapter XV he was careful to use\ndistinct \\(v\\)\u2019s for the expressions of distinct premises.\n\n\n\nBoole used the four categorical propositions as his primary forms in\n1847, but in 1854 he eliminated the negative propositional forms,\nnoting that one could change not \\(y\\) to\nnot-\\(y\\). Thus in 1854 he would express No \\(x\\)\nis \\(y\\) by All \\(x\\) is not-\\(y\\), with the\ntranslation \\(x = v(1-y)\\), and then eliminating \\(v\\) to obtain\n\n\n\\[\nx(1 - (1 - y)) = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to \\(xy = 0\\).\n\nSTEP 3: After expressing the premises in algebraic form one has a\ncollection of equations, say\n\n\\[\np_1 = q_1, \\quad p_2 = q_2, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad p_n = q_n.\n\\]\n\n\nWrite these as equations with 0 on the right side, that is, as\n\n\\[\nr_1 = 0, \\quad r_2 = 0, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad r_n = 0,\n\\]\n\n\nwith \n\n\\[\nr_1 := p_1 - q_1, \\quad r_2 := p_2 - q_2, \\quad \\dots, \\quad r_n := p_n - q_n.\n\\]\n\nAn alternative way of forming the \\(r_i\\) to preserve the idempotent property,\nin case the \\(p_i\\) and \\(q_i\\) have this property, is given in Section 3 of\nChapter X. \n\nSTEP 4: (REDUCTION) [LT (p. 121) ]\n\nReduce the system of equations \n\n\\[\nr_1 = 0, \\quad r_2 = 0, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad r_n = 0,\n\\]\n\n\nto a single equation \\(r = 0\\). Boole had three different\nmethods for doing this\u2014one of them was only for\nthe case that the \\(r_i\\) were idempotent. He had a strong preference for\nsumming the squares: \n\n\\[\nr := r_1^2 + \\cdots + r_n^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nAn alternative way of forming \\(r\\) to preserve the idempotent property,\nin case the \\(r_i\\) have this property, is also given in Section 3 of\nChapter X. \n\nSteps 1 through 4 are mandatory in Boole\u2019s General Method. After\nexecuting these steps there are various options for continuing,\ndepending on the goal. \n\nSTEP 5: (ELIMINATION) [LT (p. 101)]\n\n\nSuppose one wants the most general equational conclusion derived\nfrom \\(r = 0\\) that involves some, but not all, of the class\nsymbols in \\(r\\). Then one wants to eliminate certain symbols. Suppose \\(r\\)\ninvolves the class symbols\n\n\\[\nx_1, \\ldots, x_j \\text{ and } y_1, \\ldots, y_k.\n\\]\n\n\nThen one can write \\(r\\) as \\(r(x_1, \\ldots, x_j, y_1, \\ldots ,y_k)\\).\n\nBoole\u2019s procedure to eliminate the symbols \\(x_1, \\ldots ,x_j\\)\nfrom\n\n\\[\nr(x_1, \\ldots, x_j, y_1, \\ldots, y_k) = 0\n\\]\n\nto obtain\n\n\\[\ns(y_1, \\ldots, y_k) = 0\n\\]\n\nwas as follows: \n\nform all possible expressions \\(r(a_1, \\ldots, a_j, y_1, \\ldots,\ny_k)\\) where \\(a_1, \\ldots, a_j\\) are each either 0 or 1, then\nmultiply all of these expressions together to obtain \\(s(y_1,\n\\ldots, y_k)\\).\n\n\nFor example, eliminating \\(x_1, x_2\\) from\n\n\\[\nr(x_1, x_2, y) = 0\n\\]\n\ngives\n\n\\[\ns(y) = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\ns(y) := r(0, 0, y) \\cdot r(0, 1, y) \\cdot r(1, 0, y) \\cdot r(1, 1, y).\n\\]\n\n\nSTEP 6: (DEVELOPMENT, or EXPANSION)\n[MAL (p. 60), LT (pp. 72, 73)].\n\n\nGiven a term, say \\(r(x_1, \\ldots, x_j, y_1, \\ldots, y_k)\\), one can\nexpand the term with respect to a subset of the class symbols.

Thus solving an equation \\(r = 0\\) for a\nclass symbol \\(x\\) gives an equation\n\n\\[\nx = s(y_1 ,\\ldots ,y_k),\n\\]\n\n\nperhaps with constraint constituent equations. On p. 92 Boole noted that the\nsolution plus constraint equations could be written simply as\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx  &= A + vB\\\\\nC &= 0,\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere A, B and C are each sums of distinct constituents. \n\nThis presentation gives exactly the same solution as that of Boole, but without \nthe mysterious use of fractions like \\(0/0\\) and \\(1/0\\). Boole used formal division\nto express \\(x\\) as \\(N\\) divided by \\(D\\), and then a formal expansion where \nthe coefficient of the constituent \\(C(a_1, y_1) \\cdots C(a_k,  y_k)\\) is the fraction  \n\n\\[\nN(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_k) / D(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_k) .\n\\]\n\n\nHe had the following rules for how to decode \nthe effect of the coefficients on their constituents: (1) for the coefficient\n\\(m/m\\) with \\(m \\neq 0\\) the constituent is kept in the solution;\n(2) for \\(0/m\\) with \\(m \\neq 0\\) the constituent is deleted;\n(3) the coefficient \\(0/0\\) is changed into an\n arbitrary parameter; and (4) any other coefficient indicated that the constituent \nwas to be removed and set equal to 0. This use of formal division and formal\nexpansion is best regarded as a clever mnemonic device.\n\nSTEP 8: (INTERPRETATION) [MAL pp. 64\u201365, LT\n(Chap. VI, esp. pp. 82\u201383)]\n\nAny polynomial equation \\(p(y_1 , \\ldots ,y_k) = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection of constituent equations\n\n\\[\nC(a_1, y_1) \\cdots C(a_k, y_k) = 0\n\\]\n\n\nfor which \\(p(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_k)\\) is not 0. A constituent equation\nmerely asserts that a certain intersection of the original classes and\ntheir complements is empty. For example,\n\n\\[\ny_1 (1-y_2)(1-y_3) = 0\n\\]\n\n\nexpresses the proposition All \\(y_1\\) is \\(y_2\\) or\n\\(y_3\\), or equivalently, All \\(y_1\\) and not \\(y_2\\) is\n\\(y_3\\). It is routine to interpret constituent equations as\npropositions.\n6.3. Boole\u2019s General Method for Secondary Propositions\n\n\nSecondary propositions were Boole\u2019s version of the propositions that\none encounters in the study of hypothetical syllogisms in Aristotelian\nlogic, statements like If \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true then\n\\(Z\\) is true. The symbols \\(X, Y, Z\\), etc. referred to primary propositions. In keeping with the\nincomplete nature of the Aristotelian treatment of hypothetical\npropositions, Boole did not give a precise description of possible\nforms for his secondary propositions.\n\nThe key (but not original) observation that Boole used was simply that\none can convert secondary propositions into primary propositions. In\nMAL he adopted the convention found in Whately (1826), that\ngiven a propositional symbol \\(X\\), the symbol \\(x\\) will\ndenote the cases in which \\(X\\) is true, whereas in\nLT Boole let \\(x\\) denote the times for which\n\\(X\\) is true. With this the secondary proposition\nIf \\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true then \\(Z\\) is true is expressed\nby All \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is \\(z\\). The\nequation \\(x = 1\\) is the equational translation of\n\\(X\\) is true (in all cases, or for all times), and\n\\(x = 0\\) says \\(X\\) is false (in\nall cases, or for all times). The concepts of all cases and\nall times depend on the choice of the universe of\ndiscourse. \n\n\nWith this translation scheme it is clear that Boole\u2019s treatment of\nsecondary propositions can be analyzed by the methods he had developed\nfor primary propositions. This was Boole\u2019s propositional logic.\n\n\nBoole worked mainly with Aristotelian propositions in MAL,\nusing the traditional division into categoricals and hypotheticals.\n In LT this\ndivision was replaced by the similar but more general primary versus\nsecondary classification, where the subject and predicate were allowed\nto become complex names, and the number of propositions in an argument\nbecame unrestricted. With this the parallels between the logic of\nprimary propositions and that of secondary propositions became clear,\nwith one notable difference, namely it seems that the secondary\npropositions that Boole considered always translated into universal\nprimary propositions.\n\n\nSecondary Propositions\nMAL (1847)\nLT (1854)\n\n\n\\(X\\) is true\n\\(x = 1\\)\np.51\n\\(x = 1\\)\np.172\n\n\n\\(X\\) is false\n\\(x = 0\\)\np.51\n\\(x = 0\\)\np.172\n\n\n\\(X\\) is true and \\(Y\\) is true\n\\(xy = 1\\)\np.51\n\\(xy = 1\\)\np.172\n\n\n\\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true (inclusive)\n\\(x + y -xy = 1\\)\np.52\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n\\(X\\) is true or \\(Y\\) is true (exclusive)\n\\(x -2xy+ y = 1\\)\np.53\n\\(x(1 - y) + y(1 - x) = 1\\)\np.173\n\n\nIf \\(X\\) is true then \\(Y\\) is true\n\\(x(1-y) = 0\\)\np.54\n\\(x = vy\\)\np.173\n\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Boole, G., 1841, \u201cOn the Integration of Linear\nDifferential Equations with Constant Coefficients,\u201d <em>The\nCambridge Mathematical Journal</em>, 2: 114\u2013119.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1841, \u201cResearches on the Theory of Analytical\nTransformations, with a special application to the Reduction of the\nGeneral Equation of the Second Order,\u201d <em>The Cambridge\nMathematical Journal</em>, 2: 64\u201373.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1841, \u201cOn Certain Theorems in the\nCalculus of Variations,\u201d <em>The Cambridge Mathematical\nJournal</em>, 2: 97\u2013102.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1847, <em>The Mathematical Analysis of\nLogic, Being an Essay Towards a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning</em>,\nCambridge: Macmillan, Barclay, &amp; Macmillan, and London: George\nBell; reprinted, Oxford: Blackwell, 1951.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1848, \u201cThe Calculus of Logic,\u201d\n<em>The Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal</em>, 3:\n183\u2013198.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1854, <em>An Investigation of The Laws of\nThought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and\nProbabilities</em>, London: Walton and Maberly, Cambridge: Macmillan\nand Co.; reprinted, New York: Dover, 1958.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1859, <em>A Treatise on Differential\nEquations</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, and London:\nMacmillan.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1860, <em>A Treatise on the Calculus of\nFinite Differences</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, and\nLondon: Macmillan.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1997, <em>Selected Manuscripts on Logic and its\nPhilosophy</em> (Science Networks Historical Studies: Volume 20),\nedited by Ivor Grattan-Guinness and G\u00e9rard Bornet.
