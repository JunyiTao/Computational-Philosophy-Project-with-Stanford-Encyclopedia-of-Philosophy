The History and Varieties of Phenomenology\n\n\nPhenomenology came into its own with Husserl, much as epistemology\ncame into its own with Descartes, and ontology or metaphysics came into\nits own with Aristotle on the heels of Plato. Yet phenomenology has\nbeen practiced, with or without the name, for many centuries. When\nHindu and Buddhist philosophers reflected on states of consciousness\nachieved in a variety of meditative states, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Descartes, Hume, and Kant characterized states of\nperception, thought, and imagination, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Brentano classified varieties of mental phenomena\n(defined by the directedness of consciousness), he was practicing\nphenomenology. When William James appraised kinds of mental activity in\nthe stream of consciousness (including their embodiment and their\ndependence on habit), he too was practicing phenomenology. And when\nrecent analytic philosophers of mind have addressed issues of\nconsciousness and intentionality, they have often been practicing\nphenomenology. Still, the discipline of phenomenology, its roots\ntracing back through the centuries, came to full flower in Husserl.\n\n\nHusserl\u2019s work was followed by a flurry of phenomenological writing\nin the first half of the 20th century. The diversity of\ntraditional phenomenology is apparent in the Encyclopedia of\nPhenomenology (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997, Dordrecht and\nBoston), which features separate articles on some seven types of\nphenomenology. (1) Transcendental constitutive phenomenology studies\nhow objects are constituted in pure or transcendental consciousness,\nsetting aside questions of any relation to the natural world around us.\n(2) Naturalistic constitutive phenomenology studies how consciousness\nconstitutes or takes things in the world of nature, assuming with the\nnatural attitude that consciousness is part of nature. (3) Existential\nphenomenology studies concrete human existence, including our\nexperience of free choice or action in concrete situations. (4)\nGenerative historicist phenomenology studies how meaning, as found in\nour experience, is generated in historical processes of collective\nexperience over time. (5) Genetic phenomenology studies the genesis of\nmeanings of things within one\u2019s own stream of experience. (6)\nHermeneutical phenomenology studies interpretive structures of\nexperience, how we understand and engage things around us in our human\nworld, including ourselves and others. (7) Realistic phenomenology\nstudies the structure of consciousness and intentionality, assuming it\noccurs in a real world that is largely external to consciousness and\nnot somehow brought into being by consciousness.\n\n\nThe most famous of the classical phenomenologists were Husserl,\nHeidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. In these four thinkers we find\ndifferent conceptions of phenomenology, different methods, and\ndifferent results. A brief sketch of their differences will capture\nboth a crucial period in the history of phenomenology and a sense of\nthe diversity of the field of phenomenology.\n\n\nIn his Logical Investigations (1900\u201301) Husserl outlined a\ncomplex system of philosophy, moving from logic to philosophy of\nlanguage, to ontology (theory of universals and parts of wholes), to a\nphenomenological theory of intentionality, and finally to a\nphenomenological theory of knowledge. Then in Ideas I (1913)\nhe focused squarely on phenomenology itself. Husserl defined\nphenomenology as \u201cthe science of the essence of consciousness\u201d,\ncentered on the defining trait of intentionality, approached explicitly\n\u201cin the first person\u201d. (See Husserl, Ideas I,\n\u00a4\u00a433ff.) In this spirit, we may say phenomenology is the\nstudy of consciousness\u2014that is, conscious experience of various\ntypes\u2014as experienced from the first-person point of view. In\nthis discipline we study different forms of experience just as\nwe experience them, from the perspective of the subject living through\nor performing them. Thus, we characterize experiences of seeing,\nhearing, imagining, thinking, feeling (i.e., emotion), wishing,\ndesiring, willing, and also acting, that is, embodied volitional\nactivities of walking, talking, cooking, carpentering, etc. However,\nnot just any characterization of an experience will do.\nPhenomenological analysis of a given type of experience will feature\nthe ways in which we ourselves would experience that form of conscious\nactivity. And the leading property of our familiar types of experience\nis their intentionality, their being a consciousness of or about\nsomething, something experienced or presented or engaged in a certain\nway. How I see or conceptualize or understand the object I am dealing\nwith defines the meaning of that object in my current experience. Thus,\nphenomenology features a study of meaning, in a wide sense that\nincludes more than what is expressed in language.\n\n\nIn Ideas I Husserl presented phenomenology with a\ntranscendental turn. In part this means that Husserl took on the\nKantian idiom of \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, looking for\nconditions of the possibility of knowledge, or of consciousness\ngenerally, and arguably turning away from any reality beyond\nphenomena. But Husserl\u2019s transcendental turn also involved his\ndiscovery of the method of\nepoch\u00e9 (from the Greek skeptics\u2019 notion of abstaining\nfrom belief). We are to practice phenomenology, Husserl proposed, by\n\u201cbracketing\u201d the question of the existence of the natural\nworld around us. We thereby turn our attention, in reflection, to the\nstructure of our own conscious experience. Our first key result is the\nobservation that each act of consciousness is a consciousness of\nsomething, that is, intentional, or directed toward\nsomething. Consider my visual experience wherein I see a tree across\nthe square. In phenomenological reflection, we need not concern\nourselves with whether the tree exists: my experience is of a tree\nwhether or not such a tree exists. However, we do need to concern\nourselves with how the object is meant or intended. I see a\nEucalyptus tree, not a Yucca tree; I see that object as a Eucalyptus,\nwith a certain shape, with bark stripping off, etc. Thus, bracketing\nthe tree itself, we turn our attention to my experience of the tree,\nand specifically to the content or meaning in my experience. This\ntree-as-perceived Husserl calls the noema or noematic sense of the\nexperience.\n\n\nPhilosophers succeeding Husserl debated the proper characterization\nof phenomenology, arguing over its results and its methods. Adolf\nReinach, an early student of Husserl\u2019s (who died in World War I),\nargued that phenomenology should remain allied with a realist ontology,\nas in Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. Roman Ingarden, a\nPolish phenomenologist of the next generation, continued the resistance\nto Husserl\u2019s turn to transcendental idealism. For such philosophers,\nphenomenology should not bracket questions of being or ontology, as the\nmethod of epoch\u00e9 would suggest. And they were not\nalone. Martin Heidegger studied Husserl\u2019s early writings, worked as\nAssistant to Husserl in 1916, and in 1928 succeeded Husserl in the\nprestigious chair at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger had his own\nideas about phenomenology.\n\n\nIn Being and Time (1927) Heidegger unfurled his rendition\nof phenomenology. For Heidegger, we and our activities are always \u201cin\nthe world\u201d, our being is being-in-the-world, so we do not study our\nactivities by bracketing the world, rather we interpret our activities\nand the meaning things have for us by looking to our contextual\nrelations to things in the world. Indeed, for Heidegger, phenomenology\nresolves into what he called \u201cfundamental ontology\u201d. We must\ndistinguish beings from their being, and we begin our investigation of\nthe meaning of being in our own case, examining our own existence in\nthe activity of \u201cDasein\u201d (that being whose being is in each case my\nown). Heidegger resisted Husserl\u2019s neo-Cartesian emphasis on\nconsciousness and subjectivity, including how perception presents\nthings around us. By contrast, Heidegger held that our more basic ways\nof relating to things are in practical activities like hammering, where\nthe phenomenology reveals our situation in a context of equipment and\nin being-with-others.\n\n\nIn Being and Time Heidegger approached phenomenology, in a\nquasi-poetic idiom, through the root meanings of \u201clogos\u201d\nand \u201cphenomena\u201d, so that phenomenology is defined as the\nart or practice of \u201cletting things show themselves\u201d. In\nHeidegger\u2019s inimitable linguistic play on the Greek roots, \u201c\n\u2018phenomenology\u2019 means \u2026\u2014to let that which\nshows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows\nitself from itself.\u201d (See Heidegger, Being and Time,\n1927, \u00a6 7C.) Here Heidegger explicitly parodies Husserl\u2019s call,\n\u201cTo the things themselves!\u201d, or \u201cTo the phenomena\nthemselves!\u201d Heidegger went on to emphasize practical forms of\ncomportment or better relating (Verhalten) as in hammering a\nnail, as opposed to representational forms of intentionality as in\nseeing or thinking about a hammer. Much of Being and Time\ndevelops an existential interpretation of our modes of being\nincluding, famously, our being-toward-death.\n\n\nIn a very different style, in clear analytical prose, in the text of a\nlecture course called The Basic Problems of Phenomenology\n(1927), Heidegger traced the question of the meaning of being from\nAristotle through many other thinkers into the issues of\nphenomenology.  Our understanding of beings and their being comes\nultimately through phenomenology. Here the connection with classical\nissues of ontology is more apparent, and consonant with Husserl\u2019s\nvision in the Logical Investigations (an early source of\ninspiration for Heidegger). One of Heidegger\u2019s most innovative ideas\nwas his conception of the \u201cground\u201d of being, looking to\nmodes of being more fundamental than the things around us (from trees\nto hammers). Heidegger questioned the contemporary concern with\ntechnology, and his writing might suggest that our scientific theories\nare historical artifacts that we use in technological practice, rather\nthan systems of ideal truth (as Husserl had held). Our deep\nunderstanding of being, in our own case, comes rather from\nphenomenology, Heidegger held.\n\n\nIn the 1930s phenomenology migrated from Austrian and then German\nphilosophy into French philosophy. The way had been paved in Marcel\nProust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time, in which the narrator\nrecounts in close detail his vivid recollections of past experiences,\nincluding his famous associations with the smell of freshly baked\nmadeleines. This sensibility to experience traces to Descartes\u2019 work,\nand French phenomenology has been an effort to preserve the central\nthrust of Descartes\u2019 insights while rejecting mind-body dualism. The\nexperience of one\u2019s own body, or one\u2019s lived or living body, has been\nan important motif in many French philosophers of the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\nIn the novel Nausea (1936) Jean-Paul Sartre described a\nbizarre course of experience in which the protagonist, writing in the\nfirst person, describes how ordinary objects lose their meaning until\nhe encounters pure being at the foot of a chestnut tree, and in that\nmoment recovers his sense of his own freedom. In Being and\nNothingness (1943, written partly while a prisoner of war),\nSartre developed his conception of phenomenological\nontology. Consciousness is a consciousness of objects, as Husserl had\nstressed. In Sartre\u2019s model of intentionality, the central player in\nconsciousness is a phenomenon, and the occurrence of a phenomenon just\nis a consciousness-of-an-object. The chestnut tree I see is, for\nSartre, such a phenomenon in my consciousness. Indeed, all things in\nthe world, as we normally experience them, are phenomena, beneath or\nbehind which lies their \u201cbeing-in-itself\u201d. Consciousness,\nby contrast, has \u201cbeing-for-itself\u201d, since each\nconsciousness is not only a consciousness-of-its-object but also a\npre-reflective consciousness-of-itself (conscience de\nsoi). Yet for Sartre, unlike Husserl, the \u201cI\u201d or self\nis nothing but a sequence of acts of consciousness, notably including\nradically free choices (like a Humean bundle of perceptions).\n\n\nFor Sartre, the practice of phenomenology proceeds by a deliberate\nreflection on the structure of consciousness. Sartre\u2019s method is in\neffect a literary style of interpretive description of different types\nof experience in relevant situations\u2014a practice that does not\nreally fit the methodological proposals of either Husserl or Heidegger,\nbut makes use of Sartre\u2019s great literary skill. (Sartre wrote many\nplays and novels and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.)\n\n\nSartre\u2019s phenomenology in Being and Nothingness became the\nphilosophical foundation for his popular philosophy of existentialism,\nsketched in his famous lecture \u201cExistentialism is a\nHumanism\u201d (1945).  In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nemphasized the experience of freedom of choice, especially the project\nof choosing one\u2019s self, the defining pattern of one\u2019s past\nactions. Through vivid description of the \u201clook\u201d of the\nOther, Sartre laid groundwork for the contemporary political\nsignificance of the concept of the Other (as in other groups or\nethnicities). Indeed, in The Second Sex (1949) Simone de\nBeauvoir, Sartre\u2019s life-long companion, launched contemporary feminism\nwith her nuanced account of the perceived role of women as Other.\n\n\nIn 1940s Paris, Maurice Merleau-Ponty joined with Sartre and\nBeauvoir in developing phenomenology. In Phenomenology of\nPerception (1945) Merleau-Ponty developed a rich variety of\nphenomenology emphasizing the role of the body in human experience.\nUnlike Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, Merleau-Ponty looked to\nexperimental psychology, analyzing the reported experience of amputees\nwho felt sensations in a phantom limb. Merleau-Ponty rejected both\nassociationist psychology, focused on correlations between sensation\nand stimulus, and intellectualist psychology, focused on rational\nconstruction of the world in the mind. (Think of the behaviorist and\ncomputationalist models of mind in more recent decades of empirical\npsychology.) Instead, Merleau-Ponty focused on the \u201cbody image\u201d, our\nexperience of our own body and its significance in our activities.\nExtending Husserl\u2019s account of the lived body (as opposed to the\nphysical body), Merleau-Ponty resisted the traditional Cartesian\nseparation of mind and body. For the body image is neither in the\nmental realm nor in the mechanical-physical realm. Rather, my body is,\nas it were, me in my engaged action with things I perceive including\nother people.\n\n\nThe scope of Phenomenology of Perception is characteristic\nof the breadth of classical phenomenology, not least because\nMerleau-Ponty drew (with generosity) on Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre\nwhile fashioning his own innovative vision of phenomenology. His\nphenomenology addressed the role of attention in the phenomenal field,\nthe experience of the body, the spatiality of the body, the motility of\nthe body, the body in sexual being and in speech, other selves,\ntemporality, and the character of freedom so important in French\nexistentialism. Near the end of a chapter on the cogito (Descartes\u2019 \u201cI\nthink, therefore I am\u201d), Merleau-Ponty succinctly captures his\nembodied, existential form of phenomenology, writing:\n\n\nInsofar as, when I reflect on the essence of subjectivity, I find it\nbound up with that of the body and that of the world, this is because\nmy existence as subjectivity [= consciousness] is merely one with my\nexistence as a body and with the existence of the world, and because\nthe subject that I am, when taken concretely, is inseparable from this\nbody and this world. [408]\n\n\nIn short, consciousness is embodied (in the world), and equally body\nis infused with consciousness (with cognition of the world).\n\n\nIn the years since Husserl, Heidegger, et al. wrote,\nphenomenologists have dug into all these classical issues, including\nintentionality, temporal awareness, intersubjectivity, practical\nintentionality, and the social and linguistic contexts of human\nactivity. Interpretation of historical texts by Husserl et al.\nhas played a prominent role in this work, both because the texts are\nrich and difficult and because the historical dimension is itself part\nof the practice of continental European philosophy. Since the 1960s,\nphilosophers trained in the methods of analytic philosophy have also\ndug into the foundations of phenomenology, with an eye to\n20th century work in philosophy of logic, language, and\nmind.\n\n\nPhenomenology was already linked with logical and semantic theory in\nHusserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. Analytic phenomenology\npicks up on that connection. In particular, Dagfinn F\u00f8llesdal\nand J.  N. Mohanty have explored historical and conceptual relations\nbetween Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and Frege\u2019s logical semantics (in\nFrege\u2019s \u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d, 1892). For Frege, an\nexpression refers to an object by way of a sense: thus, two\nexpressions (say, \u201cthe morning star\u201d and \u201cthe\nevening star\u201d) may refer to the same object (Venus) but express\ndifferent senses with different manners of presentation. For Husserl,\nsimilarly, an experience (or act of consciousness) intends or refers\nto an object by way of a noema or noematic sense: thus, two\nexperiences may refer to the same object but have different noematic\nsenses involving different ways of presenting the object (for example,\nin seeing the same object from different sides). Indeed, for Husserl,\nthe theory of intentionality is a generalization of the theory of\nlinguistic reference: as linguistic reference is mediated by sense, so\nintentional reference is mediated by noematic sense.\n\n\nMore recently, analytic philosophers of mind have rediscovered\nphenomenological issues of mental representation, intentionality,\nconsciousness, sensory experience, intentional content, and\ncontext-of-thought. Some of these analytic philosophers of mind hark\nback to William James and Franz Brentano at the origins of modern\npsychology, and some look to empirical research in today\u2019s cognitive\nneuroscience. Some researchers have begun to combine phenomenological\nissues with issues of neuroscience and behavioral studies and\nmathematical modeling. Such studies will extend the methods of\ntraditional phenomenology as the Zeitgeist moves on. We\naddress philosophy of mind below.\n",
