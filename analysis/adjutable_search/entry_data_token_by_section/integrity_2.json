    "main_text": "The Self-Constitution View of Integrity\n3. The Self-Constitution View of Integrity\n\nThe self-integration view of integrity and the identity view of\nintegrity, as we described them above, place only formal limits on the\nkinds of desires and projects that might constitute an integrated\nself. Christine Korsgaard (2009) develops a distinctive picture of\nintegrity that takes the self-integration and identity views in a\nconstructivist Kantian direction. According to Korsgaard, integrity is\nnot so much a condition of excellence we aspire to as a precondition\nof being an agent at all. To the extent that we fail to live with\nintegrity, we fail to live as persons: we fail to be a self, as\nopposed to a collection of strivings; we fail to exemplify human\nagency as opposed to the unreflective satisfaction of desire.\n\nTo live with integrity is not merely to have a coherent life-plan and\nthe courage to realise it, it is to act in a way that is rationally\nendorsed both by oneself as one acts and one\u2019s future self. To\ndo this, one must act on principles and these principles must be such\nthat they would be rationally endorsed by any future self who reflects\non the matter satisfactorily. Hypothetical imperatives tie our present\nplans and our future actions together; they are necessary for agency,\nbut not sufficient. Categorical imperatives must be brought to bear if\nthe tie between present and future self is to be appropriately\nbinding. A future self must be bound to a project in light of the same\nprinciples that illuminated the project\u2019s origin, endorsable in\na process of rational reflection parallel to that at work at the\nproject\u2019s origin.\n\nKorsgaard illustrates how this process may fail, and what is at stake\nin such a failure, with an example drawn from Derek Parfit (Korsgaard\n2009, 185\u201386). A Russian nobleman wants to create a fortune in\norder to give it away to others in need. But he thinks that by the\ntime he makes his fortune, he will not be idealistic and altruistic\nenough to give his fortune away. He will likely regard his plan as the\nfolly of youth. The nobleman therefore seeks a promise from his wife\nthat the fortune will be given away even if he protests. He seeks to\nuse an external force (his wife\u2019s agency) to secure his present\nplans against his future self\u2019s abandonment of them. In such a\ncase, the present self is treating the future self as a stranger, as a\ndistinct person. To overcome this, the nobleman must formulate his\nplan according to principles that are categorical in nature.\nHypothetical imperatives have no force once their antecedent condition\nis abandoned. Only a categorical principle of action will necessarily\nform a basis for endorsing a plan now and in the future. The nobleman\nmust formulate his plan in the light of such a principle and trust his\nfuture self to endorse the plan in the light of the same principle. It\nis a risk, of course. But integrity is born of this risk. And if\nKorsgaard is right, it is not just integrity that is constituted in\nthis way, but our becoming a distinctive self is constituted in this\nway too.\n\nAccording to Korsgaard, the categorical nature of the principles\nthrough which we endorse our projects ensures that they will be\nmorally satisfactory projects. Korsgaard sums up her thinking like\nthis:\n\nAnd in the course of this process, of falling apart and pulling\nyourself back together, you create something new, you constitute\nsomething new: yourself. For the way to make yourself into an agent, a\nperson, is to make yourself into a particular person, with a practical\nidentity of your own. And the way to make yourself into a particular\nperson, who can interact well with herself and others, is to be\nconsistent and unified and whole \u2013 to have integrity. And if you\nconstitute yourself well, if you are good at being a person, then\nyou\u2019ll be a good person. The moral law is the law of\nself-constitution. (2009, 214)\n\n\nThe self-constitution view of integrity inherits many of the\nchallenges encountered by the self-integration view and the identity\nview, described above. These challenges are not decisive objections,\nbut defence of the self-constitution view will need ultimately to take\naccount of them. In addition, the view appears to rely on a\nconstructivist account of normative reasons. (See Bagnoli, 2011.) In\nparticular, the kind of agency Korsgaard appeals to when she\nidentifies integrity with successful agency and self-constitution must\nbe inescapable if it is to constitute the very possibility of being a\nperson. David Enoch (2006) argues that this kind of agency is\noptional, and that one could coherently aspire to a distinct form of\nagency \u2013 he calls it \u201cshmagency\u201d \u2013 which\nallows one to act in a practically successful way without committing\noneself to universalizable, categorical norms of action. The issue\nturns on whether the account of agency developed by Korsgaard is\ninescapable; whether is must govern reflection on what to do by any\nrational self-conscious being and whether this inescapable\ncharacteristic of agency, if it exists, stretches to an ideal of a\ncomplete life of unified agency that Korsgaard identifies with\nintegrity.\n",
