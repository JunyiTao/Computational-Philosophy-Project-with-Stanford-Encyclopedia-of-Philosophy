    "main_text": "Perspectives on connexive logic || Conditional logic\n3.2 Conditional logic\n\nPrinciples of connexive logic have been discussed in conditional logic\n(see the entry\n logic: conditional),\n beginning with Ramsey\u2019s (1929) comments on what is now called\nthe Ramsey Test, as pointed out, e.g., in McCall 2012 and\nFerguson 2014:\n\nIf two people are arguing \u201cIf p will q?\u201d\nand are both in doubt as to p, they are adding p\nhypothetically to their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis\nabout q; so that in a sense \u201cIf p,\nq\u201d and \u201cIf p, ~q\u201d are\ncontradictories (notation adjusted).\n\n\nAngell (1966, 1967a, 1978) refers to AT\u2032 as the Law of\nConditional Non-Contradiction. Usually, Abelard\u2019s First\nPrinciple, ~((A \u2192 B) \u2227 (A \u2192\n~B)) is considered as a principle of conditional\nnon-contradiction and as such is endorsed by some philosophers, e.g.,\nGibbard (1981, p. 231), Lowe (1995, p. 47), and Bennett (2003, p. 84),\nwithout making any reference to connexive logic. Conditional\nnon-contradiction fails, however, to be a valid principle in the\nsemantics suggested by Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973), cf. the\ndiscussion in Unterhuber 2013. The restrictedly connexive logics\npresented in Weiss 2019 that validate Aristotle\u2019s theses, BTw,\nand BTw\u2032 stand in the tradition of Stalnaker and Lewis and are\ngiven an algebraic semantics that builds on the algebraic semantics\nfor conditional logics from Nute 1980.\n\nAnother motivation for connexive logic from the perspective of\nconditional logic has been presented by John Cantwell (2008) without\nnoting that the introduced propositional logic is a system of\nconnexive logic. Cantwell considers the denial of indicative\nconditionals in natural language and argues that the denial of, say,\nthe conditional \u2018If Oswald didn\u2019t kill Kennedy, Jack Ruby\ndid.\u2019 amounts to the assertion that if Oswald didn\u2019t shoot\nKennedy then neither did Jack Ruby. This suggests that (A\n\u2192 ~B) is semantically equivalent with ~(A\n\u2192 B). Also Claudio Pizzi\u2019s work on logics of\nconsequential implication has been motivated in the context of\nconditional logic, see Pizzi 1977 and section 5.\n",
