    "main_text": "The impact of information technology on privacy || Internet\n2.2 Internet\n\nThe Internet, originally conceived in the 1960s and developed in the\n1980s as a scientific network for exchanging information, was not\ndesigned for the purpose of separating information flows (Michener\n1999). The World Wide Web of today was not foreseen, and neither was\nthe possibility of misuse of the Internet. Social network sites\nemerged for use within a community of people who knew each other in\nreal life \u2013 at first, mostly in academic settings \u2013 rather\nthan being developed for a worldwide community of users (Ellison\n2007). It was assumed that sharing with close friends would not cause\nany harm, and privacy and security only appeared on the agenda when\nthe network grew larger. This means that privacy concerns often had to\nbe dealt with as add-ons rather than by-design.\n\nA major theme in the discussion of Internet privacy revolves around\nthe use of cookies (Palmer 2005). Cookies are small pieces of data\nthat web sites store on the user\u2019s computer, in order to enable\npersonalization of the site. However, some cookies can be used to\ntrack the user across multiple web sites (tracking cookies), enabling\nfor example advertisements for a product the user has recently viewed\non a totally different site. Again, it is not always clear what the\ngenerated information is used for. Laws requiring user consent for the\nuse of cookies are not always successful in terms of increasing the\nlevel of control, as the consent requests interfere with task flows,\nand the user may simply click away any requests for consent (Leenes\n& Kosta 2015). Similarly, features of social network sites\nembedded in other sites (e.g. \u201clike\u201d-button) may allow\nthe social network site to identify the sites visited by the user\n(Krishnamurthy & Wills 2009).\n\nThe recent development of cloud computing increases the many privacy\nconcerns (Ruiter & Warnier 2011). Previously, whereas information\nwould be available from the web, user data and programs would still be\nstored locally, preventing program vendors from having access to the\ndata and usage statistics. In cloud computing, both data and programs\nare online (in the cloud), and it is not always clear what the\nuser-generated and system-generated data are used for. Moreover, as\ndata are located elsewhere in the world, it is not even always obvious\nwhich law is applicable, and which authorities can demand access to\nthe data. Data gathered by online services and apps such as search\nengines and games are of particular concern here. Which data are used\nand communicated by applications (browsing history, contact lists,\netc.) is not always clear, and even when it is, the only choice\navailable to the user may be not to use the application.\n\nSome special features of Internet privacy (social media and big data)\nare discussed in the following sections.\n",
