    "main_text": "\n\nJacques Derrida (1930\u20132004) was the founder of\n\u201cdeconstruction,\u201d a way of criticizing not only both\nliterary and philosophical texts but also political institutions.\nAlthough Derrida at times expressed regret concerning the fate of the\nword \u201cdeconstruction,\u201d its popularity indicates the\nwide-ranging influence of his thought, in philosophy, in literary\ncriticism and theory, in art and, in particular, architectural theory,\nand in political theory. Indeed, Derrida\u2019s fame nearly reached\nthe status of a media star, with hundreds of people filling\nauditoriums to hear him speak, with films and television programs\ndevoted to him, with countless books and articles devoted to his\nthinking. Beside critique, Derridean deconstruction consists in an\nattempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-consciousness\n(the difference of the \u201cof\u201d in consciousness of oneself).\nBut even more than the re-conception of difference, and perhaps more\nimportantly, deconstruction attempts to render justice. Indeed,\ndeconstruction is relentless in this pursuit since justice is\nimpossible to achieve.\n",
