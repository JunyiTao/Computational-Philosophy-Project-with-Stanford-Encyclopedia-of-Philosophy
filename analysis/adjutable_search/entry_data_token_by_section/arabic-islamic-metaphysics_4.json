Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\n\nBesides more traditional overviews of the works of Aristotle and the\nplace of the Metaphysics among them (What Ought to be\nPremised to the Learning of Aristotle\u2019s Philosophy, M\u0101\nyanba\u0121\u012b an yuqaddama qabla ta\u02bfallum falsafat\nAri\u1e63\u1e6d\u016b; Aristotle\u2019s Philosophy and Its\nParts, Falsafat Aris\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d\u0101l\u012bs\nwa-a\u01e7z\u0101\u02be falsafatih\u012b),\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 950) also provided taxonomic accounts in\nwhich the Metaphysics is related to the system of the\nphilosophical and Islamic sciences, rather than to the Aristotelian\ncorpus of writings. In the most important and influential\nessay of this type, the Enumeration of the Sciences\n(I\u1e25\u1e63\u0101\u02be al-\u02bful\u016bm), he portrays\nmetaphysics as a discipline having a precise method (demonstration)\nand an articulated structure, in which a full-fledged ontology (the\nstudy of being qua being) in its different aspects precedes,\nfirst, a part dealing with the foundation of the other sciences and,\nsecond, a philosophical theology concerned, among other things, with\nIslamic issues such as God\u2019s attributes, divine names and\nactions. In all these classificatory treatises, the position of the\nMetaphysics with respect to the other works of Aristotle, or\nof metaphysics with respect to the other philosophical disciplines, is\nnot stable, but varies according to the particular perspective that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b adopts: significantly, in some of them\nmetaphysics is presented as the culmination of the entire system of\nknowledge, for example, in The Philosophy of Aristotle.\n\nThe consideration of the entire Metaphysics, and the view of\nmetaphysics as universal science, are the pivotal elements of the\nshort introduction to the Metaphysics written by\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, following the model of the Prolegomena of\nGreek Late Antiquity and the teaching of Ammonius Son of Hermeias and\nhis Aristotelian school in Alexandria. This essay, On the Goals of\nthe Sage [= Aristotle] in Each Treatise of the Book Marked by\nMeans of Letters [= Metaphysics] (Maq\u0101la\n\u2026 f\u012b A\u0121r\u0101\u1e0d al-\u1e25ak\u012bm f\u012b\nkull maq\u0101la min al-kit\u0101b al-maws\u016bm\nbi-l-\u1e25ur\u016bf), represents the first integral exegesis of\nthe Metaphysics extant in Arabic and reveals\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s dependence on the epistemology of the\nnewly translated Posterior Analytics.\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s use of a style of exegesis stemming from\nthe Peripatetic tradition is a manifestation of his affiliation with\nthe coeval school of Baghdad Aristotelians. The main point of the work\nis that metaphysics is more encompassing than, and not reducible to,\nthe philosophical theology of book Lambda. Following this aim,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b first rejects the attempts to interpret\nAristotle\u2019s work along Neoplatonic and monotheistic lines (in\nthis he has probably in mind al-Kind\u012b\u2019s theologizing\nconception of metaphysics), and advocates a type of explanation akin\nto that of the Greek commentators (Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius). Then he derives from the universal nature of metaphysics,\nunderstood as the science having being qua being as its\nsubject-matter, indications regarding its scope (it incorporates a\npart on philosophical theology, namely on the doctrine of the first\ncauses of being), as well as on its oneness as an universal science\n(there cannot be more than one universal science), its name (by being\nmore general than physics it is also \u201cafter\u201d physics) and\nits overall content. Finally, he concludes with a brief description of\neach of the books of Aristotle\u2019s work known to him, in which the\ncontent of book Lambda is summarized with no religious overtones. In\nthis way, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b extracts from Aristotle\u2019s\nwork a coherent and all-encompassing outline of an \u201cideal\u201d\nscience of metaphysics; this project will guide the following\ngenerations of Arabic metaphysicians, in particular Avicenna, to build\na new science of metaphysics according to Farabian parameters.\n\nIn al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s main works on political\nphilosophy, philosophical theology is the only part of metaphysics\nthat functions as preliminary\u2014together with human noetics,\nman\u2019s destiny in the after-life, and prophecy\u2014to the\naccount of the organization of the ideal state (Principles of the\nOpinions of the Inhabitants of the Virtuous City, Mab\u0101di\u02be\n\u0100r\u0101\u02be Ahl al-Mad\u012bna al-F\u0101\u1e0dila).\nOther works of his, on the other hand, deal specifically with\nontological themes. Among them, the Book of Letters\n(Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ur\u016bf, which is not, properly\nspeaking, a commentary on the Metaphysics, despite the title\nechoing one of the Arabic names of Aristotle\u2019s work) follows a\npattern analogous to that of Book Delta (V) of the\nMetaphysics; the treatise On One and Unity\n(F\u012b l-w\u0101\u1e25id wa-l-wa\u1e25da) is thematically\nlinked to Book Iota (X); the refutation of Philoponus\u2019 criticism\nof Aristotle is a reassessment of the thesis of the eternity of the\nworld. Scattered references to the Metaphysics, with regard\nto distinct topics, surface also in the famous Book on the\nAgreement of the Opinions of the Two Sages, the Divine Plato and\nAristotle (Kit\u0101b al-\u01e6am\u02bf bayna ra\u02beyay\nal-\u1e25ak\u012bmayn Afl\u0101\u1e6d\u016bn al-il\u0101h\u012b\nwa-Aris\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6d\u0101l\u012bs), which resumes the\nPorphyrian theme of the harmony between Aristotle\u2019s and\nPlato\u2019s views, that had been taken up by al-Kind\u012b and\n\u1e6e\u0101bit ibn Qurra, but seems alien to\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s conception of the history of philosophy.\nFor this and other reasons, the Farabian authorship of this treatise,\ndespite the manuscript evidence, has been repeatedly questioned in\nrecent scholarship.\n\nThe view that metaphysics is the universal science of being\nqua being, and thus exceeds the boundaries of philosophical\ntheology by including it as one of its parts, functions in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b to underscore the irreducibility of\nmetaphysics to Islamic religion: at the level of content, metaphysics\nranges over a thematic spectrum wider than the Muslim creed; on\nepistemic grounds, the demonstrative method of metaphysics (and of\nphilosophy in general) is superior not only to the rhetorical and\npoetical character of prophetic discourse, but also to the dialectical\nprocedures of Islamic theology (kal\u0101m). This helps to\nexplain why al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does not indulge in the\nphilosophical explanation of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, and why in\nthe political works does he treat topics pertinent to religion from a\nstrictly philosophical point of view, with no concession to religious\nterminology or theological motives.\n",
