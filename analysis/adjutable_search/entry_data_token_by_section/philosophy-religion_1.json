    "main_text": "The Meaning of Religious Beliefs\n2. The Meaning of Religious Beliefs\n\nPrior to the twentieth century, a substantial amount of philosophical\nreflection on matters of religious significance (but not all) has been\nrealist. That is, it has often been held that religious beliefs are\ntrue or false. Xenophanes and other pre-Socratic thinkers, Socrates,\nPlato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, the Stoics, Philo, Plotinus differed\non their beliefs (or speculation) about the divine, and they and their\ncontemporaries differed about skepticism, but they held (for example)\nthat there either was a divine reality or not. Medieval and modern\nJewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophers differed in terms of their\nassessment of faith and reason. They also faced important\nphilosophical questions about the authority of revelation claims in\nthe Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur\u2019an. In Asian\nphilosophy of religion, some religions do not include revelation\nclaims, as in Buddhism and Confucianism, but Hindu tradition\nconfronted philosophers with assessing the Vedas and Upanishads. But\nfor the most part, philosophers in the West and East thought there\nwere truths about whether there is a God, the soul, an afterlife, that\nwhich is sacred (whether these are known or understood by any human\nbeing or not). Realism of some kind is so pervasive that the great\nhistorian of philosophy Richard Popkin (1923\u20132005) once defined\nphilosophy as \u201cthe attempt the give an account of what is true\nand what is important\u201d (Popkin 1999: 1). Important philosophers\nin the West such as Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) and Friedrich\nNietzsche (1844\u20131900), among others, challenged classical\nrealist views of truth and metaphysics (ontology or the theory of what\nis), but the twentieth century saw two, especially powerful movements\nthat challenged realism: logical positivism and philosophy of religion\ninspired by Wittgenstein.\n\nAs a preface to addressing these two movements, let us take note of\nsome of the nuances in philosophical reflection on the realist\ntreatment of religious language. Many theistic philosophers (and their\ncritics) contend that language about God may be used univocally,\nanalogically or equivocally. A term is used univocally about God and\nhumans when it has the same sense. Arguably, the term \u201cto\nknow\u201d is used univocally of God in the claims \u201cGod knows\nyou\u201d and \u201cYou know London\u201d, even though how God\nknows you and how you know London differ radically. In terms of the\nlater difference, philosophers sometimes distinguish between\nwhat is attributed to some thing and the mode in\nwhich some state (such as knowledge) is realized. Terms are used\nanalogously when there is some similarity between what is being\nattributed, e.g., when it is said that \u201ctwo human persons love\neach other\u201d and \u201cGod loves the world\u201d, the term\n\u201clove\u201d may be used analogically when there is some\nsimilarity between these loves). Terms are used equivocally when the\nmeaning is different as in the statement \u201cAdam knew Eve\u201d\n(which in the King James\u2019 Bible meant Adam and Eve had\nintercourse) and \u201cGod knows the world\u201d (while some of the\nHomeric gods did have intercourse with humans, this was not part of\ntheistic worldviews). Theological work that stresses our ability to\nform a positive concept of the divine has been called the via\npositiva or catophatic theology. On the other hand,\nthose who stress the unknowability of God embrace what is called the\nvia negativa or apophatic theology. Maimonides\n(1135\u20131204) was a great proponent of the via negativa,\nfavoring the view that we know God principally through what God is not\n(God is not material, not evil, not ignorant, and so on).\n\nWhile some (but not all) philosophers of religion in the Continental\ntradition have aligned themselves with apophatic theology such as\nLevinas (who was non-theistic) and Jean-Luc Marion (1946\u2013), a\nsubstantial amount (but not all) of analytically oriented philosophy\nof religion have tended to adopt the via positiva One of the\nchallenges of apophatic theology is that it seems to make the\nphilosophy of God remote from religious practices such as prayer,\nworship, trust in God\u2019s power and goodness, pilgrimages, and\nreligious ethics. According to Karen Armstrong, some of the greatest\ntheologians in the Abrahamic faiths held that God\n\n\nwas not good, divine, powerful, or intelligent in any way that we\ncould understand. We could not even say that God\n\u201cexisted\u201d, because our concept of existence is too\nlimited. Some of the sages preferred to say that God was\n\u201cNothing\u201d because God was not another being\u2026 To\nthese theologians some of our modern ideas about God would have seemed\nidolatrous. (Armstrong 2009: x)\n\n\nA prima facie challenge to this position is that it is hard\nto believe that religious practitioners could pray or worship or trust\nin a being which was altogether inscrutable or a being that we cannot\nin any way understand. For a realist, via positiva\nphilosophy of God that seeks to appreciate the force of apophatic\ntheology, see Mikael Stenmark\u2019s \u201cCompeting conceptions of\nGod: the personal God versus the God beyond being\u201d (2015).\n\nLet us now turn to two prominent philosophical movements that\nchallenged a realist philosophy of God.\n",
