    "main_text": "Epistemological Approaches || Semantic Inheritance Networks\n4.2 Semantic Inheritance Networks\n\nThe system of semantic inheritance networks, developed by Horty,\nThomason, and Touretzky (1990), is similar to Pollock\u2019s system.\nBoth represent cognitive states by means of directed graphs, with\nlinks representing defeasible inferences. The semantic inheritance\nnetwork theory has a intentionally narrower scope: the initial nodes\nof the network represent particular individuals, and all non-initial\nnodes represent kinds, categories or properties. A link from an\ninitial (individual) node to a category node represents simply\npredication: that Felix (initial node) is a cat (category node), for\nexample. Links between category nodes represent defeasible or generic\ninclusion: that birds (normally or usually) are flying things. To be\nmore precise, there are both positive (\u201cis a\u201d) and\nnegative (\u201cis not a\u201d) links. The negative links are\nusually represented by means of a slash through the body of the\narrow.\n\nSemantic inheritance networks differ from Pollock\u2019s system in\ntwo important ways. First, they cannot represent one fact\u2019s\nconstituting an undercutting defeater of an inference,\nalthough they can represent rebutting defeaters. For example,\nthey do not allow an inference from the apparent color of an elephant\nto its actual color to be undercut by the information that my color\nvision is unreliable, unless I have information about the actual color\nof the elephant that contradicts its apparent color. Secondly, they do\nincorporate the principle of specificity (the principle that rules\nwith more specific antecedents take priority in case of conflict) into\nthe very definition of a warranted conclusion. In fact, in contrast to\nPollock, the semantic inheritance approach gives priority to rules\nwhose antecedents are weakly or defeasibly more specific. That is, if\nthe antecedent of one rule is defeasibly linked to the antecedent of a\nsecond rule, the first rule gains priority. For example, if Quakers\nare typically pacifists, then, when reasoning about a Quaker pacifist,\nrules pertaining to Quakers would override rules pertaining to\npacifists. For the details of semantic inheritance theory, see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n\nSemantic Inheritance Networks.\n \n\nDavid Makinson (Makinson 1994) has pointed out that semantic network\ntheory is very sensitive to the form in which defeasible information\nis represented. There is a great difference between having a direct\nlink between two nodes and having a path between the two nodes being\nsupported by the graph as a whole. The notion of preemption gives\nspecial powers to explicitly given premises over conclusions. Direct\nlinks always take priority over longer paths. Consequently,\ninheritance networks lack two desirable metalogical properties: cut\nand cautious monotony (which will be covered in more detail in the\nsection on Logical Approaches).\n\nCut: If \\(G\\) is a subgraph of \\(G'\\), and every\nlink in \\(G'\\) corresponds to a path supported by\n\\(G\\), then every path supported by \\(G\\) is also supported\nby \\(G'\\).\nCautious Monotony: If \\(G\\) is a subgraph of\n\\(G'\\), and every link in \\(G'\\) corresponds to\na path supported by \\(G\\), then every path supported by\n\\(G'\\) is also supported by \\(G\\).\n\n\nCumulativity (Cut plus Cautious Monotony) corresponds to reasoning by\nlemmas or subconclusions. The Horty-Thomason-Touretzky system does\nsatisfy special cases of Cut and Cautious Monotony: if \\(A\\) is\nan atomic statement (a link from an individual to a category), then if\ngraph \\(G\\) supports \\(A\\), then for any statement\n\\(B, G \\cup \\{A\\}\\) supports \\(B\\) if and\nonly if \\(G\\) supports \\(B\\).\n\nAnother form of inference that is not supported by semantic\ninheritance networks is that of reasoning by cases or by dilemma. In\naddition, semantic networks do not license modus-tollens-like\ninferences: from the fact that birds normally fly and Tweety does not\nfly, we are not licensed to infer that Tweety is not a bird. (This\nfeature is also lacking in Pollock\u2019s system.)\n",
