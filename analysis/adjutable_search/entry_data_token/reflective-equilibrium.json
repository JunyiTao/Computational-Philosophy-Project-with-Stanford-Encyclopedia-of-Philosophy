Perhaps you have many such judgments\nabout different cases. You might, nevertheless, consider that\njudgments alone do not justify the moral views they express.\nYou and your moral interlocutors might be concerned that \u201cwhat\nwe actually accept is fraught with idiosyncrasy and vulnerable to\nvagaries of history and personality\u201d (Elgin 1996: 108) or\ndisplays \u201cirregularities and distortions\u201d (Rawls 1971:\n48).\n\nJohn Rawls proposed to address these concerns through the method\nof reflective equilibrium. We first ensure that our judgments are\nconsidered, being made in circumstances appropriate for moral\ndeliberation. We are then to consider general principles that might\naccommodate our set of considered judgments\u2014and more than that,\nexplain and extend them. On the standard wide reflective\nequilibrium, we are to consider\n\n\nall possible descriptions to which one might plausibly conform\none\u2019s judgments together with all relevant philosophical\narguments for them. (Rawls 1971: 49)\n\n\nThis requires that we reflect on a wide range of principles,\narguments, and theories. Equilibrium is reached where principles and\njudgments have been revised such that they agree with each other. In\nshort, the method of reflective equilibrium is the mutual adjustment\nof principles and judgments in the light of relevant argument and\ntheory.\n\nReflective equilibrium is the dominant method in moral and political\nphilosophy (McPherson 2015: 652; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017: 444).\nIts advocates suggest that \u201cit is the only rational game in town\nfor the moral theorist\u201d or \u201cthe only defensible\nmethod\u201d (DePaul 1993: 6; Scanlon 2003: 149; see also Freeman\n2007: 35\u201336; Floyd 2017: 377\u2013378). Though often endorsed,\nit is far more frequently used. Wherever a philosopher presents\nprinciples, motivated by arguments and examples, they are likely to be\nusing the method. They are adjusting their principles\u2014and with\nluck, their readers\u2019\u2014to the judgments suggested by the\narguments and examples. Alternatively they might \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d by adjusting initially discordant judgments to\naccommodate otherwise appealing principles. Either way, they are\nusually describing a process of reflective equilibrium, with\nprinciples adjusted to judgments or vice versa. Reflective equilibrium\nis a formal expression of standard methodological practice in moral\nand political philosophy. (See Rawls 1971, e.g., 19\u201321, for a\nfamous application of reflective equilibrium, and Rechnitzer 2022 for\na reconstruction of Thomson 2008 in terms of reflective\nequilibrium.)\n\nThis entry first addresses the judgments that are the starting point\nfor reflective equilibrium, examining various interpretations of them\nfound in the literature. It then explores the principles and theories\nthat take us from merely having judgments to reaching reflective\nequilibrium. Finally, it considers some of the main objections to the\nmethod. Throughout the focus will be on reflective equilibrium in its\narchetypal setting of moral and political philosophy, especially as it\nhas been developed by Rawls and Norman Daniels, though with some\nreference to versions of the method developed in other branches of\nphilosophy (e.g., Goodman 1965; Lewis 1983; Elgin 1996).\n", "toc": [{"#Judg": "1.

Judgments\n\nWhile the distinction between judgments and principles may intuitively\ncorrespond to that between the particular and the general,\n\n\n[p]eople have considered judgments at all levels of generality, from\nthose about particular situations and institutions up through broad\nstandards and first principles to formal and abstract conditions on\nmoral conceptions. (Rawls 1974: 8)\n\n\nA first distinction is, then, that while principles necessarily\ngeneralize to more than one case (List & Valentini 2016; Slavny et\nal. 2021), judgments may be either general or particular. A second\ndistinction is that judgments express an agent\u2019s moral outlook\nwhile principles are candidate representations of that outlook (cf.\nBrun 2014). In reflective equilibrium, judgments are the views\nactually held by the moral deliberator while a \u201cscheme of\nprinciples represents their moral conception and characterizes their\nmoral sensibility\u201d (Rawls 1974: 7; see also Rawls 1971: 48).\nThis section examines judgments, while the next considers\nprinciples.\n1.1 Considered Judgments\n\nThe method of reflective equilibrium starts with judgments. An initial\nquestion is which of these judgments should be allowed entry to the\nprocess.\n\nAn obvious position with some appeal is to allow any\njudgments or intuitions. A permissive view says that\n\n\n[o]ur \u201cintuitions\u201d are simply opinions; our philosophical\ntheories are the same. Some are commonsensical, some are\nsophisticated; some are particular, some general; some are more firmly\nheld, some less. But they are all opinions, and a reasonable goal for\na philosopher is to bring them into equilibrium \u2026 If our\nofficial theories disagree with what we cannot help thinking outside\nthe philosophy room, then no real equilibrium has been reached. (Lewis\n1983: x; cf. Goodman 1965: 63\u201364)\n\n\nThis might seem cavalier, but we are at the moment only discussing the\nstarting point of the method. If reflective equilibrium does its job,\nour initial judgments may be transformed, and will at any rate cohere\nwith theoretical considerations.\n\nThe mainstream view, by contrast, suggests that only considered\njudgments should be used in reflective equilibrium. These are\n\u201cthose judgments in which our moral capacities are least likely\nto be displayed without distortion\u201d (Rawls 1971: 47). We should\n(1) be capable of reaching the right decision (e.g., be reasonably\nwell informed), (2) be in circumstances where we can do so (e.g., not\nbe scared or upset), and (3) be motivated to do so (e.g., not stand to\ngain or lose from the results of our deliberations). In short, we\nshould have the ability, opportunity, and desire to make the right\ndecision (Rawls 1971: 48). In moral and political philosophy, the\njudgments used in reflective equilibrium are usually these Rawlsian\nconsidered judgments.\n\nIntuitions are frequently used interchangeably with considered\njudgments in the critical literature on reflective equilibrium. But\nintuitions as typically described have characteristics that are not\ngenerally true of considered judgments, especially non-inferentiality\n(Brun 2014; Greenspan 2015; Cath 2016: 228\u2013229). This entry will\ntherefore focus on considered judgments rather than intuitions.\n1.2 The Confidence Constraint\n\nRawls proposes that \u201cwe can discard those judgments made with\nhesitation, or in which we have little confidence\u201d (Rawls 1971:\n47). In other words, considered judgments are subject to a\nconfidence constraint. Relatedly, Rawls frequently refers to\nconsidered judgments as \u201cconvictions\u201d (e.g., Rawls 1971:\n19\u201321, 45, 48, 53, 246, 318\u2013320, 447, 520, 580). The\nconfidence constraint extends to revisions of judgments,\nwhich must be made \u201cwith conviction and confidence\u201d (Rawls\n1974: 8). A more modest version of the confidence constraint is a\ncompromise between the ideal of accounting for all judgments and\npractical limitations (Scanlon 2003: 144).\n\nAn alternative view suggests that, if, as Rawls supposes, we are\ntrying to describe our moral capacity, it may appear self-defeating to\nexclude some of our moral judgments from consideration. Our lack of\nconfidence in some judgments means they are likely to be rejected\nduring the reflective process but gives no reason to dismiss them out\nof hand (Raz 1982: 318\u2013319). Such a move may increase rather\nthan decrease the distortion of moral sensibilities that reflective\nequilibrium is supposed to address (Knight 2017: 47\u201348).\nConsider someone with certain far right commitments, but not so far\ngone that they don\u2019t recognize some appeal to such values as\nequality and liberty, though they have little confidence in them or a\nclear idea of their contours. It may seem peremptory to exclude the\nunconfident judgments supporting these values from consideration in\nreflective equilibrium, where they might have found principled\nsupport.\n1.3 The Epistemic Constraint\n\nConsidered judgments, even those that satisfy the confidence\nconstraint, are not limited as to their content. One might have the\nability, opportunity, and desire to make the right decision, yet make\na grossly mistaken decision, and be confident in it (see Sternberg\n[ed.] 2002). This may motivate an epistemic constraint. A\nmodest version would exclude judgments that are logically inconsistent\nor founded on empirical error. A more ambitious constraint excludes\nany unjustified or unwarranted beliefs (Kelly & McGrath 2010). For\nexample, Gerald Gaus comments that \u201cclearly unjustified beliefs\nare, if anything, epistemic liabilities,\u201d approvingly quoting\nQuine and Ullian\u2019s suggestion that \u201cinsofar as we are\nrational, we will drop a belief when we have in vain tried to find\nevidence for it\u201d (Gaus 1996: 86; Quine & Ullian 1970:\n16).\n\nFriends of reflective equilibrium largely reject such a constraint.\nThe basic complaint is that it makes epistemological determinations in\nadvance of the reflective process where these are rather the proper\nupshot of that process. Reflective equilibrium can be viewed as a\nnegative method, i.e., as what we\u2019re left with when we decide\nthat positive criteria for epistemic success cannot be laid out prior\nto fully considering our substantive topics (Walden 2013: 255). On\nthis view, what counts as justification, warrant, or consistency\nshould be decided with all relevant theory on the table as part of the\nprocess of reflective equilibrium and is not prescribed by the method\nitself.\n1.4 Initial Judgments\n\nCutting across the issue of which constraints, if any, to put on\njudgments is the question of the priority of initial\njudgments over those arising during the reflective process.\n\nNarrow reflective equilibrium, described but not endorsed by Rawls and\nDaniels, matches principles to initial judgments, with only minor\nchanges allowed (Rawls 1971: 49; Rawls 1974: 8; Daniels 1996: 22, 49).\nA more moderate position is that \u201cinitially tenable commitments\nhave a presumption in their favor\u201d (Elgin 1996: 107). On this\nview, \u201cindependently motivated, initially tenable commitments\nmust underwrite coherence,\u201d for however coherent the components\nof reflective equilibrium may be, \u201ctheir mutual support may\nderive from a judicious disregard for contravening\nconsiderations\u201d (Elgin 1996: 107; see also Baumberger & Brun\n2021). Initial judgments anchor reflective equilibrium to something\noutside itself. A similar suggestion is that inchoate initial\njudgments are \u201ca central constraint\u201d (Schroeter 2004:\n122).\n\nAn opposing view gives initial judgments no priority over subsequent\njudgments. Moral beliefs may be formed that are not just different\nfrom but discontinuous with one\u2019s initial beliefs, which may be\nrejected. One may, for instance, undergo a moral conversion, becoming\nconvinced by the worldview of a Marx or Nietzsche (DePaul 1993: ch.\n1). This \u201cradical\u201d version of reflective equilibrium\nallows the moral deliberator to comprehensively change their mind.\n\nThough Michael DePaul states the radical position most clearly,\ncontrasting it with a \u201cconservative\u201d reflective\nequilibrium that he takes as dominant (DePaul 1993: 31), the radical\nview seems more in line with canonical reflective equilibrium, which\nencourages revision of judgment on theoretical grounds (see, e.g.,\nDaniels 1996: 2\u20134, 26\u201328, 60\u201361, 70\u201371). While\nRawls\u2019 applications of reflective equilibrium assume that we\nhave certain \u201cconvictions\u201d (such as those opposing racial\ndiscrimination or religious intolerance), in explaining the method he\nis clear that \u201ca person\u2019s sense of justice may or may not\nundergo a radical shift\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49)\u2014and on closer\ninspection we see that convictions are only\n\u201cprovisional fixed points\u201d (Rawls 1971: 20; Rawls\n2005: 8, emphasis added; see also Rawls 1974: 8). Even Elgin allows\nthat \u201cconsiderations with no initial tenability sometimes\ndislodge initially tenable commitments\u201d; it\u2019s just that\nthe latter \u201care not to be given up without reason\u201d (Elgin\n1996: 108, 107).\n\nThere is, then, significant agreement that initial judgments can be\noverridden by subsequent ones, with a residual disagreement as to\nwhether they nevertheless receive weak presumptive priority.\n2. Principles and Theories\n\nReflective equilibrium, at least on its classic construal, arises\nwhere judgments are brought together with their representation in\nprinciples. Theories play a dual role as agglomerations of the\nprinciples and priority rules that are the outputs of reflective\nequilibrium, and as sources of argument for selecting those\nprinciples. This section considers the role of principles and theories\nin reflective equilibrium.\n2.1 Wide Reflective Equilibrium\n\nAs mentioned above, a narrow reflective equilibrium is\nreached where principles are matched to initial judgments, allowing\nonly for the \u201csmoothing out of certain irregularities\u201d\n(Rawls 1971: 49). In moral and political philosophy this is of\ninterest mainly as a contrast with the wide reflective\nequilibrium endorsed by Rawls, Daniels, and many others in their wake\n(but see Beisbart, Betz, & Brun 2021). A wide reflective\nequilibrium is achieved where the deliberator has brought judgments\nand principles into agreement having reflected on a wide range of\nconsiderations. Wide reflective equilibrium contrasts with narrow\nreflective equilibrium in several respects.\n\nFirst, we are not merely looking for principles that look like our\ninitial judgments, giving our pre-theoretical opinions a philosophical\nsheen. Rather, a wide range of principles should be\nconsidered. Indeed, we should consider all principles to which our\njudgments might plausibly conform, though \u201cit is doubtful\nwhether one can ever reach this state\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49). We will\nreturn to this contrast between the ideal and the practical.\n\nSecond, our initial judgments are revisable. If you encounter\na principle that seems to fit many of your most important judgments,\nor even that does not fit them but has appeal nonetheless, you are\nfree to change judgments that disagree with that principle. Perhaps a\nprinciple even ranges over terrain on which you had no prior judgments\n(e.g., moral dimensions of generative AI), in which case you can make\nnew judgments that agree or disagree with it, as you see fit.\nEverything is up for grabs. (Note that this second feature is\nconsistent with giving initial judgments either no priority or weak\npresumptive priority as discussed earlier.)\n\nThird, we are to consider not just a very wide range of principles,\nbut a wide range of arguments for them. Ideally we\nshould consider all such arguments (Rawls 1971: 49). We are also to\nconsider arguments against principles. The arguments show the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the principles under consideration\n(Daniels 1996: 82). One important kind of argument is the thought\nexperiment. For instance, in relation to the principle of utility, one\nmight consider utilitarian sheriffs, utility monsters, experience\nmachines, trolley problems, and repugnant conclusions, among countless\nothers. A \u201cdirected reflective equilibrium\u201d offers a\nsequencing for consideration of such cases (Slavny et al. 2021). Note\nthat such arguments may not only support one principle over another,\nbut generate new principles, such as variant forms of\nutilitarianism\u2014and there will be new arguments for and against\nthese variants, which generate their own variants, and so on.\n\nFourth, as well as arguments, we should consider \u201cdevices of\nrepresentation\u201d (Rawls 2005: 23\u201328) or\n\u201cjustificatory devices\u201d (Daniels 1996: 59\u201360). It\nmay be that we have greater confidence in certain conditions on the\nselection of principles than we antecedently have in any particular\nprinciples. Prominent examples of such justificatory devices are\nRawls\u2019 original position, other contemporary (Scanlon 1998) and\nhistorical (Locke 1689; Rousseau 1762) contractualist devices, as well\nas their contractarian (Hobbes 1651; Gauthier 1986) and ideal observer\n(Hume 1740, book 3; Smith 1759) counterparts. Whether we find any such\ndevice useful is a matter of whether it fits our judgments in wide\nreflective equilibrium. If we do, we may have a powerful new argument\nfor the principles that the device supports.\n\nFinally, moral and non-moral background theories can inform\nour equilibrium. Arguments for and against principles referred to\nabove are \u201cinferences from relevant background theories\u201d\n(Daniels 1996: 82). Background theories can similarly be used to\ninform our assessment of justificatory devices. For instance, our view\nof Rawls\u2019 contract device may be informed by our view of\npersonal identity (Daniels 1996: 60). Indeed, Rawls\n\n\nwent to great lengths to insure that the principles of justice did\n\u2018fit\u2019 with what we know about psychology, biology,\nevolutionary theory, economics, and other social and natural sciences.\n(Freeman 2007: 40)\n\n\nA wide reflective equilibrium achieves coherence not only between\njudgments and principles regarding the issue at hand, but across the\nfull breadth of the deliberator\u2019s thought that might have\nimplications for it.\n\nTo summarize, wide reflective equilibrium consists of agreement\nbetween revisable judgments and principles following reflection on a\nwide range of principles, arguments, justificatory devices, and\nbackground theories. In its pure form, it is an impossibly demanding\nmethod, drawing a vast and ever-growing expanse of principles,\narguments and theories within its ambit. This exacting standard can\nnevertheless inform our approach to a more modest reflective\nequilibrium, as where Rawls compares his theory of justice\u2019s\n\u201cprinciples and arguments with a few other familiar\nviews,\u201d which \u201cmoves us closer to the philosophical ideal;\nit does not, of course, achieve it\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49, 50; see\nalso Rawls 2005: 97).\n2.2 The Independence Constraint\n\nA large part of the appeal of wide reflective equilibrium is its\nappeal to deeper background theories. For example, my principles of\njustice may depend in part on my views of individual agency; and my\nviews on agency may in turn depend on my views about free will and\ncausation. But isn\u2019t there a danger that this broad coherence is\nbought at the cost of circularity?\n\nSuppose, for instance, that I have the conviction that no one should\nbe very badly off. This judgment might support a sufficientarian\nprinciple of justice requiring that no one is very badly off (e.g.,\nFrankfurt 1987). But suppose I now claim that this principle is also\nsupported by the combination of the luck egalitarian background theory\nthat no one should be badly off through no genuine choice of their own\n(Cohen 1989) with the hard determinist background theory that no one\nis responsible for their choices, and my basis for the latter theory\nis the original judgment no one should be very badly off. In such a\ncase it seems that the background theories give no independent support\nfor the sufficientarian principle, i.e., no support that was not\nalready there in the bare judgment that no one should be very badly\noff. If it were not for that judgment, I would not have a basis for my\nhard determinist background theory, and the luck egalitarian\nbackground theory alone would not support the sufficientarian\nprinciple, as it is consistent with some being very badly off due to\nchoice.\n\nIn response to such cases we can utilize an independence\nconstraint (Daniels 1996: 22\u201324). Suppose we\ndistinguish principle judgments, which support the\nprinciples, from background judgments, which support the\nbackground theories. The independence constraint requires that\nprinciple judgments are not also background judgments. Background\ntheories must draw on their own judgments and cannot\n\u201crecycle\u201d principle judgments. As Daniels puts it,\n\n\n[t]he background theories in (c) should show that the moral principles\nin (b) are more acceptable than alternative principles on grounds to\nsome degree independent of (b)\u2019s match with relevant considered\nmoral judgments in (a). If they are not in this way independently\nsupported, then there seems to be no gain over the support the\nprinciples would have had in a corresponding narrow equilibrium, where\nthere never was any appeal to (c). (Daniels 1996: 22)\n\n\nHe applies this to Rawls\u2019 theory of justice, arguing that\nRawls\u2019 theories of the person and the role of morality are not\njust redescriptions of the judgments that support Rawls\u2019 two\nprinciples of justice and thereby satisfy the constraint (Daniels\n1996: 23\u201324, 50\u201362).\n\nSome commentators consider the independence constraint objectionable,\nfor instance suggesting that it encourages holding back some principle\njudgments so they can be used as background judgments to create a wide\nreflective equilibrium (Haslett 1987: 307\u2013308). Yet the\nindependence constraint doesn\u2019t allow judgments to be held back\nin this way\u2014if they support the principles they are necessarily\nprinciple judgments and cannot be used as background judgments (Knight\n2006: 211).\n\nOthers argue that the constraint is superfluous, as\n\n\n[a] person who explicitly cooked up all her relevant background\nbeliefs on the basis of her considered moral judgments would not be\nfollowing the method of reflective equilibrium in the first place.\n(DePaul 1993: 15)\n\n\nBut perhaps the more serious problem the constraint addresses is not\ndeliberate circularity. We want to ensure that our moral principles\nare not merely \u201caccidental generalizations\u201d of\n\u201cmoral facts,\u201d and we can do this by independently testing\nthem against background theories, just as scientific generalizations\nthat inadvertently correspond to observations can be distinguished\nfrom scientific laws by their lack of coherence with connected theory\n(Daniels 1996: 22). Critics suggest accidental generalizations might\nalternatively be weeded out simply by considering a sufficiently large\nnumber of cases (DePaul 1993: 15). A combination of the two approaches\nmay be preferable (Holmgren 1989: 59).\n2.3 Coherentist or Foundationalist?\n\nA commonsense form of justification is inferential and\nlinear. It is inferential because each belief is justified by\nanother, and it is linear because beliefs cannot justify any of their\nantecedent beliefs. A is justified by B, which is justified by C, and\nso on. The problem with such inferential and linear justification is\nthat it falls into infinite regress. For anything to be justified at\nall, it seems we have to give an endless chain of justification that\nwe cannot possibly proffer. The regress can be ended either by\npermitting non-inferential justification, as foundationalism\nproposes, or by permitting non-linear justification, as\ncoherentism proposes (Brink 1989: 105\u2013106). Some have\ninterpreted reflective equilibrium as foundationalist, but most\ninterpret it as coherentist.\n\nSupport for the foundationalist interpretation comes from considered\njudgments\u2019 clear justificatory role in reflective equilibrium.\nAll justification in reflective equilibrium relies on the\ndeliberator\u2019s actual considered judgments. The most powerful\nprinciple or elegantly coherent theory must be rejected if they do not\nagree with judgment. Principles and theories have no influence on the\nprocess except through the medium of considered judgments\u2014if the\ndeliberator is not won around to them, they do not move the\nequilibrium one iota. For the foundationalist, a judgment does not\nneed to prove itself as a principle or theory does. The mere fact that\nthe deliberator holds it is enough for it to guide equilibrium. That\nsaid, the kind of foundationalism at hand is clearly rather modest\n(Ebertz 1993; Cath 2016: 219\u2013220). Judgments are treated as\nrevisable even where they are viewed as empirical data (Floyd 2017).\nThe method, at least in its usual, wide form, gives no place to the\nunrevisable beliefs of traditional foundationalism or intuitionism\n(DePaul 1993: 34).\n\nThe prevalence of the coherentist interpretation is, in part, based on\nthe obvious contrast with this traditional foundationalism. Wide\nreflective equilibrium is, furthermore, an exemplar of the broadly\ncoherentist idea that beliefs can be justified by their coherence with\na system of beliefs (Rawls 1974: 8; Daniels 1996: 60\u201361; Tersman\n2008: 398\u2013400). The deliberator is not expected to consider a\nprinciple in isolation, but rather to consider its connections with\nother principles as well as a wide range of moral and non-moral\nbackground theories. A principle can be justified by its fit with a\ncomprehensive system of thought exhibiting logical, probabilistic, and\nexplanatory relations among its members (Brink 1989: 103). For\nexample, and as we have seen, Rawls\u2019 theory of justice justifies\nits principles of justice by appeal to theories of the person and of\nmorality, among other background theories. Coherentists claim that\nmoral beliefs alone are not enough for reflective equilibrium; they\nrely on theory-grounded second-order beliefs about the reliability of\nfirst order beliefs (Brink 1989: 127; Tersman 2008: 399).\n2.4 Reflective Equilibrium without Principles?\n\nThe standard construal of reflective equilibrium seeks a\ntheoretically-driven balance between judgments and principles. It is\ntherefore unsurprising that it has been opposed by\nanti-theorists, who set themselves against \u201can approach\nto ethical enquiry that seeks a systematizing account of correct\nethical thought and practice\u201d (Robertson 2017: 678). Bernard\nWilliams objected that Rawls\u2019 reflective equilibrium failed to\ndeliver mutually acceptable principles (Williams 1985: 110\u2013116),\nwhile Annette Baier was\n\n\nnot content, like Rawls (1971: 50) to retreat to the aim of finding a\ntheory that accommodates all my considered judgments, while\nresigning myself to the likelihood that yours are different and\nrequire a different theory. (Baier 1985: 140)\n\n\nThis criticism of reflective equilibrium may be misplaced. Williams\nappears to \u201cconflate Rawls\u2019s contractualism with his\ncoherentist justification\u201d (Clarke 1987: 243). It is\nRawls\u2019 original position, not his reflective equilibrium, which\naims to provide principles for a well-ordered society. Reflective\nequilibrium has no commitment to contractualism or justificatory\ndevices generally; these are useful, where they are, simply because\nthey place conditions on practical reason that the individual\ndeliberator finds appealing. This may, however, seem to put reflective\nequilibrium in Baier\u2019s sights, and in danger of solipsism; this\nconcern is addressed below in the discussion of public reflective\nequilibrium.\n\nWhile reflective equilibrium is not committed to devices of\njustification, it is usually understood as being committed to\nprinciples. Rawls and Daniels understand an equilibrium as between\njudgments and principles, so if there are no principles, there can be\nno equilibrium. This could, nevertheless, be seen as an arbitrary\nrestriction on moral deliberation. Someone might be convinced by\nanti-theory, so that their considered judgments will settle on no\nmoral principles, maintaining that ethics should be more local and\npractical. A supplementary line of thought inspired by foundationalism\nmight suggest that principles are superfluous to the method because\nthe real balance is struck between judgments. Such principle-less\nmoral conclusions do not seem admissible on the standard understanding\nof reflective equilibrium. It is not clear why the formal category of\nprinciples should be considered untouchable when everything else,\nincluding the entire content of all principles and the background\ntheories by which they are assessed, is available for revision.\n\nWe might, then, consider whether reflective equilibrium is possible\nwithout principles. On one view the core of reflective equilibrium is\ninspired by Socrates\u2019 transformation of his pupils\u2019\n\u201cinarticulate hunches into fully explicit beliefs\u201d\n(Schroeter 2004: 121). This \u201cmaieutic reflection\u201d makes\nour inchoate moral notions more precise; sometimes we will endorse\nthem, but at other times we may find they conflict and revise some of\nthem. Maieutic reflection is a valuable tool of moral enquiry even if\nthere is no \u201cstable resting point\u201d and no intention to\nbuild a moral theory (Schroeter 2004: 122). Even antitheorists could\nuse this method. An apparent qualification is that\nconstructivists\u2014those that hold that \u201cmoral facts are\nepistemically constrained\u201d (Schroeter 2004: 111)\u2014are\ncommitted to moral theory after all.\n\nCuriously, the index of Rawls\u2019 Political Liberalism\nprovides a concise statement of a principle-less method:\n\u201cReflective equilibrium: defined as when judgments at all levels\nof generality are in line on due reflection\u201d (Rawls 2005: 514).\nRather than bringing principles and judgments into agreement, as per\nRawls\u2019 official position, this variant would only bring\njudgments into agreement with each other. This would still allow us to\nretain major justificatory elements of wide reflective equilibrium,\narriving at a coherent set of considered judgments revised in light of\na wide range of competing principles, arguments, and background\ntheories. The only difference is that our judgments are not\nnecessarily represented in principles. Deliberators are free to follow\nthe classic mutual adjustment of principles and judgments should they\nwish, but the output that is measured is judgments alone, \u201cat\nall levels of generality\u201d: utilitarians\u2019 one big judgment,\nanti-theorists\u2019 countless smaller ones, and every position in\nbetween.\n2.5 Public Reflective Equilibrium\n\nThe mainstream reflective equilibrium of the early Rawls and Daniels\nis individualist. It is a method for a philosopher to work\nout her views (Rawls 1971; Daniels 1996). Further, they claim it is a\nmethod that makes those views reasonable or justified. Yet it might be\nclaimed that a single philosopher\u2019s views on a topic of public\ninterest, such as Rawls\u2019 and Daniels\u2019 main substantive\ntopic of social justice, cannot really be justified in that way. That\nindividual may have justified their view to themselves, but they have\nnot justified it to other people, who have different considered\njudgments and find different principles and theories appealing.\n\nOne response here is to insist that, if you have followed the method\ncorrectly, it does justify one\u2019s principles, and not only to\noneself (see the discussions of credibility and relativism below). It\nmight nevertheless be urged that, if our views are to have some impact\nin the real world, they should move other people as well as ourselves\n(Anderson 2015). This is a challenge to reflective equilibrium from\npolitical practice rather than moral epistemology, and philosophers\nmay feel it is not their role to address it\u2014it is enough for\nthem to set out justified views. Still, those with policy ambitions\nfor reflective equilibrium have described three broad forms of\npublic reflective equilibrium.\n\nThe first keeps individualist reflective equilibrium as its starting\npoint, but aims to achieve convergence between equilibria (Daniels\n1996: 33\u201339). The later Rawls particularly appeals to the idea\nof an \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d (Rawls 2005). The broad\nmotivation here is that in a plural society with a diversity of\ncomprehensive moral doctrines we cannot rely on any one comprehensive\ndoctrine, such as utilitarianism, Kantianism, or a specific religious\nfaith, to support our political principles. Rather, the reflective\nequilibria of adherents of each of these comprehensive doctrines can\nconverge on a specific set of liberal principles, each for different\nreasons. The later Rawls continues to assume that reflective\nequilibria are wide, but now maintains that they should be\ngeneral: \u201cthe same conception is affirmed in\neveryone\u2019s considered judgments\u201d (Rawls 2005: 384 n. 16).\nHe refers to wide and general reflective equilibrium as full\nreflective equilibrium.\n\nAn alternative form of public reflective equilibrium appears to reject\nindividualism even as a starting point, drawing on empirical work to\nform judgments and principles. One version of this approach is\nquantitative, drawing on survey data (Savulescu et al. 2021). Another\nversion is qualitative, using interviews or \u201csemi-structured\ndiscussions\u201d (Wolff & de Shalit 2007: 11). For instance, in\na study on social disadvantage, the researchers\n\n\nconsulted our interviewees about our views and we learnt from them. In\nthis process we revised and modified our theory according to the\ntheories and intuitions expressed by the interviewees. (Wolff & de\nShalit 2007: 12)\n\n\nThe specific topic might make particular interviewees\nappropriate\u2014in the disadvantage case, those that provide\nservices to the disadvantaged as well as disadvantaged people\nthemselves\u2014or more informal selection methods may be used:\n\n\nIf possible, the decision with whom to talk should be done by\nstrolling in different parts of the city, bumping into people every\nnow and then, and asking them to enter into a discussion. (de Shalit\n2020: 19)\n\n\nA difficulty with this approach is that it may be too ambitious in its\nexpectations of the general public\u2019s theorizing, as it takes not\nonly judgments but theories from consultees. Yet the general public\nmay not have moral and political principles, if they do have such\nprinciples they may conflict, and their views certainly do not mirror\ntheoretical divides in philosophy (e.g., between Kantians and\nutilitarians) (Baderin 2017: 11\u201312).\n\nThis may motivate a final form of public reflective equilibrium, which\nuses the public\u2019s judgments but not their theories, and in\nparticular their case-specific judgments (Baderin 2017; see also\nMiller 1999). The merit of using the public\u2019s judgments is that\nthey are independent of principles, which might be considered\nan essential requirement if a meaningful balance is to be struck\nbetween judgments and principles, but one which can hardly be met by\nphilosophers\u2019 judgments (Baderin 2017: 15\u201319). The point\nis similar to Elgin\u2019s reason for giving priority to initial\njudgments\u2014principles can enslave as well as enlighten. The\nphilosopher remains the one undergoing reflective equilibrium, and is\nfree to reject the public\u2019s judgments, but a persistent refusal\nto adapt theory to public judgment suggests a refusal to earnestly\nengage in reflective equilibrium (Baderin 2017: 19\u201320). Among\nchallenges for such a view are the lack of mutual adjustment\nof judgments and principles where judgments are the public\u2019s\nrather than the individual\u2019s.\n3. Objections\n\nGiven its central role in contemporary ethics, it is no surprise that\nreflective equilibrium has been confronted with many objections. Here\nwe will consider a selection of the main objections along with\nresponses put forward by reflective equilibrium\u2019s defenders.\n3.1 Initial Credibility\n\nCritics have queried the epistemic value of the considered judgments\nor \u201cintuitions\u201d that underpin reflective equilibrium\n(Williamson 2022: 246\u2013248). While reflective equilibrium may\ndeliver a coherent set of beliefs, the objection is that there are no\ngrounds for supposing that this set is credible:\n\n\nIn the case of normative beliefs, no reason has been offered why we\nshould think that initial credence levels, for a person, correspond to\ncredibilities. (Brandt 1979: 20)\n\n\nThe outcome of reflective equilibrium may be believed, but that is\nconsistent with it being coherent fiction. Indeed, some considered\njudgments seem plainly unreasonable. The judgment that killing at\nrandom is morally required would have to be accepted as a considered\njudgment on the standard account of reflective equilibrium that\nrejects an epistemic constraint on considered judgments (Kelly &\nMcGrath 2010).\n\nThis objection arguably foregrounds considered judgments to the extent\nof neglecting the justificatory heart of the method, which is its\nprocess. This\n\n\ninvolves identifying our considered judgments, learning more about\nthem, and perhaps modifying them in the process of considering\nprinciples that would account for them. (Scanlon 2014: 84)\n\n\nIndeed, the objection seems directed more at narrow reflective\nequilibrium, where the reflective process has little effect on the\noutcome. Consider the coherentist interpretation of reflective\nequilibrium discussed above, which highlights that judgments and\nprinciples in equilibrium cohere with the deliberator\u2019s entire\nsystem of thought, which has arisen from reflection on all relevant\nprinciples and argument. It is hard to claim that this is not at least\nsomething in favour of their position. Someone who has not followed\nthe method, and whose judgments and principles are only partially\nformed, extend only to a few cases, are flagrantly contradictory in\nsome of those cases, and result from consideration of a limited range\nof principles and argument, does not, at least typically, have a view\nthat is as credible.\n\nIt is true that there is little about wide reflective equilibrium that\nwould prevent implausible considered judgments from entering the\nprocess, but this is because it is supposed that this filtering is\nproperly conducted with all relevant theory on the table. Filtering in\nadvance would require epistemic and (given the above examples) moral\ncriteria that could well conflict with the theories accepted in wide\nreflective equilibrium.\n\nTo be sure, it is possible that some of those who claim to follow the\nmethod start with such unreasonable views (e.g., a cast iron\ncommitment to random killing) that they will still have unreasonable\nviews in equilibrium, but this could be seen as analogous to a\nscientist having such unreasonable views (e.g., a cast iron commitment\nto creationism or climate change denial) that their findings are\nunreasonable despite apparently following scientific procedure (Knight\n2017: 53\u201354). It might be held that, for people starting with\nsuch radically different beliefs from our own, it is not unreasonable\nto reach seemingly perverse equilibria (Cath 2016: 225\u2013226).\nAlternatively, and as explored below, the method might allow that\ntheir views are unjustified even though they are in equilibrium.\n3.2 Relativism\n\nSeveral critics object that there is no unique reflective\nequilibrium. There are two objections here, one interpersonal, one\nintrapersonal. The interpersonal objection is considered first.\n\nSome advocates of reflective equilibrium combine the view with moral\nrealism, maintaining that the method can provide evidence of objective\nmoral truth (Brink 1989 and more tentatively Daniels 1996:\n37\u201339). Rawls takes a less metaethically ambitious approach, his\nconstructivist theory providing \u201cobjectivity for its limited\npolitical purposes\u201d (Rawls 2005: 110; see also Nielsen 1993;\nBrandstedt & Br\u00e4nnmark 2020). On either view reflective\nequilibrium can offer objective support for moral principles.\n\nCritics disagree, claiming that reflective equilibrium falls victim to\nrelativism. The objection starts with the observation that\ndifferent people following the method may reach different, conflicting\nequilibria (Dworkin 1973 [1975: 34\u201336]; de Maagt 2017:\n450\u2013451). How can it be the case that each of two or more\nconflicting views are objectively justified? The justification rather\nlooks to be relative to the deliberator.\n\nBut reflective equilibrium is properly understood as a\npotential source of justification. There is no need to claim\nthat it always offers evidence of moral truth or practical guidance.\nHence, the mere existence of conflicting equilibria does not mark the\ndescent into relativism. As Scanlon notes,\n\n\naccepting that some person is well informed and has carried out the\nsearch for reflective equilibrium conscientiously does not even commit\none to the conclusion that this person is justified in accepting the\nprinciples that result, let alone the conclusion that those principles\nare justified. (Scanlon 2003: 152)\n\n\nHe asks us to enquire as to the reasons for divergences between our\nequilibrium and that of another. Did we start with different\nconsidered judgments? Did the divergence arise due to later\nadjustments in considered judgments? Is it due to consideration of\ndifferent moral principles? At each stage we are to ask whether we\nfeel we made the better decisions or whether we might now revise our\njudgments and principles (Scanlon 2003: 152\u2013153; Scanlon 2014:\n79\u201381).\n\nWhat if we are content with the decisions leading to both\nequilibria? Two conflicting views being equally justified is not\nreally suggestive of relativism, but rather supports a pluralistic\nposition (Scanlon 2014: 79). It seems no less objective to judge that\ntwo equilibria are equally justified than it is to judge that one is\nmore justified than the other.\n3.3 Indeterminacy\n\nOn, then, to the objection to the lack of a unique\nintrapersonal equilibrium. Just as different people may reach\ndifferent equilibria, the same person may reach different equilibria\nat different times, as their judgments are revisable. The ethical\ndeliberator can simply change their mind even if the relevant facts\nstay the same, the claimed standard of justification being a drifting\none (Copp 1985: 165). Alternatively, there may be multiple\nsimultaneous equilibria even for a single person, where principles and\njudgments can be made to fit each other in different combinations\n(Haslett 1987: 310). Critics worry that such an indeterminate\nprocedure cannot tell us what to believe or results in an arbitrary\noutcome (McPherson 2015: 662\u2013663; List & Valentini 2016:\n542).\n\nThis line of objection is largely anticipated by Rawls, who\nacknowledges that there may be no unique equilibrium even for one\nperson, and that the judgments we start with, or the \u201ccourse of\nreflection itself,\u201d may affect the principles we settle on\n(Rawls 1971: 50). He simply sets such questions aside, saying that\nreflective equilibrium \u201cis, if you wish, a kind of psychology\nand does not presuppose the existence of objective moral truths\u201d\n(Rawls 1974: 9). For reasons parallel to those in the interpersonal\ncase, it may also be that the truth of moral realism, and the\nexistence of objective moral facts, are compatible with drifting\nequilibria (Knight 2006: 220). Advocates of reflective equilibrium do\nnot claim that it gives direct access to or perfectly tracks moral\ntruth, only that it can justify moral beliefs. Even where the ultimate\nfacts are static, a belief can become more justified by becoming\nendorsed by the deliberators\u2019 judgments and cohering with their\nreflectively-derived system of beliefs.\n3.4 Bias\n\nThe further objection might then be raised that reflective equilibrium\nis vulnerable to arbitrary order or framing biases (McPherson 2015:\n662\u2013663; List & Valentini 2016: 542). One study found that\nprofessional philosophers were vulnerable to order and framing\neffects, and that this was not reduced by reflection or expertise on\nthe topics in question (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2015). The\njudgments of participants in reflective equilibrium might be\nconsidered unreliable in the sense that they vary with factors that\nthey themselves consider irrelevant (Paulo 2020: 335\u2013336).\n\nAdditional biases are suggested by experiments bringing out the\nemotional nature of moral reasoning. They show, for instance, that\nthere is greater activation of brain areas associated with emotional\nprocessing in personal cases, such as the variant of the trolley\nproblem where a large person is pushed from a footbridge, than in\notherwise similar impersonal cases, such as the original trolley\nproblem (Greene et al. 2001). Peter Singer suggests that considered\njudgments in such cases are emotionally-driven evolved responses to\ncircumstances that no longer obtain:\n\n\nthe salient feature that explains our different intuitive judgments\nconcerning the two cases is that the footbridge case is the kind of\nsituation that was likely to arise during the eons of time over which\nwe were evolving; whereas the standard trolley case describes a way of\nbringing about someone\u2019s death that has only been possible in\nthe past century or two, a time far too short to have any impact on\nour inherited patterns of emotional response. But what is the moral\nsalience of the fact that I have killed someone in a way that was\npossible a million years ago, rather than in a way that became\npossible only two hundred years ago? I would answer: none. (Singer\n2005: 348)\n\n\nHe therefore concludes that reflective equilibrium is mistaken in\ngiving considered judgments a central role in moral theorizing. Other\ncritics similarly suggest that considered judgments may be based on\nprejudice (Brandt 1979: 22; Hare 1981: 12; Anderson 2015).\n\nWide reflective equilibrium may be able to take on board these\nconcerns, and revise judgments accordingly. For instance, if we are\nmoved by Singer\u2019s argument about the strongly emotional and\nevolutionary character of some of our moral judgments, we could use a\nrevised conception of considered judgments that excludes judgments\ndistorted in this way (Tersman 2008: 398). Alternatively, we could\nallow such judgments to enter the process, but revise them given the\nbackground theory that Singer introduces (see Tersman 2008: 397).\nOrder or framing effects would similarly be highlighted by\npsychological background theories, allowing the deliberator to take\ncompensatory measures.\n3.5 An Empty Method?\n\nBy this point the critic may be exasperated. If you identify a problem\nwith someone\u2019s way of doing philosophy, and they agree that\nit\u2019s a problem, you might expect them to change how they do it.\nBut the adherent of wide reflective equilibrium accepts the criticism\nbut maintains their method, saying that they have adopted the\ncriticism within the method. To critics this suggests that the method\nis \u201cclose to vacuous\u201d (Singer 2005: 349), absorbing\nmethodological controversies rather than adjudicating them (McPherson\n2015: 661; Paulo 2020: 346; de Maagt 2017: 458). It just takes us\n\n\nback to the usual philosophical argument about the merits and demerits\nof various methods of argument and of various theories. The method of\nreflective equilibrium is then not a method in moral philosophy at\nall. (Raz 1982: 309)\n\n\nDefenders of wide reflective equilibrium describe it in similar terms\nto the critics, while rejecting their negative evaluation. Its ability\nto absorb apparent rivals is seen as a feature, not a bug:\n\n\nThis charge of emptiness seems to me to be largely correct, but\nnonetheless mistaken in one important respect, and therefore not as\ndamaging as it sounds. The charge is largely correct because the\nsearch for wide reflective equilibrium, as Rawls describes it, allows\nfor what might have been seen as alternative methods of justification\nto be incorporated within it. \u2026 What the method of reflective\nequilibrium prescribes is, so to speak, a level playing field of\nintuitive justification on which principles and judgments of all\nlevels of generality must compete for our allegiance. It thus allows\nall possible sources of justificatory force to be considered. But the\nmethod is not vacuous because it is incompatible with some views about\nthese sources. It is incompatible, first, with the idea that any\nparticular class of judgments or principles can be singled out in\nadvance of this process as justified on some other basis and, second,\nwith the idea that any class of considered judgments should be left\nout of this process. (Scanlon 2003: 151).\n\n\nIt might be added that critics of reflective equilibrium are rich\nsources of methods incompatible with reflective equilibrium. For\ninstance, Brandt\u2019s cognitive psychotherapy, Hare\u2019s\nuniversal prescriptivism, Anderson\u2019s pragmatism, or de\nMaagt\u2019s transcendentalism describe methods for justifying moral\nviews prior to, or without, reflective equilibrium (Brandt 1979; Hare\n1981; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017). Reflective equilibrium rules\nout\n\n\nmoral skepticism and nihilism and other doctrines that doubt our\ncapacities for morality altogether, as well as naturalism and other\nreductionist efforts to justify moral principles purely on the basis\nof factual, linguistic, or metaphysical claims. (Freeman 2007: 37; see\nalso Rawls 1971: 51)\n\n\nGiven the many methods and theories at odds with reflective\nequilibrium, it is hard to maintain that it is devoid of content, or\nnearly so. If it looks that way it may be because its assumptions are\nwidely accepted in moral and political philosophy, a victim of its own\nsuccess.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, Elizabeth, 2015, \u201cMoral Bias and Corrective\nPractices: A Pragmatist Perspective\u201d, <em>Proceedings and\nAddresses of the American Philosophical Association</em>, 89:\n21\u201347.", "Baderin, Alice, 2017, \u201cReflective Equilibrium: Individual or\nPublic?\u201d, <em>Social Theory and Practice</em>, 43(1):\n1\u201328. doi:10.5840/soctheorpract20174311", "Baier, Annette, 1985, <em>Postures of the Mind: Essays on Mind and\nMorals</em>, Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.", "Baumberger, Christoph and Georg Brun, 2021, \u201cReflective\nEquilibrium and Understanding\u201d, <em>Synthese</em>, 198(8):\n7923\u20137947. doi:10.1007/s11229-020-02556-9", "Beisbart, Claus, Gregor Betz, and Georg Brun, 2021, \u201cMaking\nReflective Equilibrium Precise: A Formal Model\u201d, <em>Ergo an\nOpen Access Journal of Philosophy</em>, 8: 441\u2013472 (article 15).\ndoi:10.3998/ergo.1152", "Brandstedt, Eric and Johan Br\u00e4nnmark, 2020, \u201cRawlsian\nConstructivism: A Practical Guide to Reflective Equilibrium\u201d,\n<em>The Journal of Ethics</em>, 24(3): 355\u2013373.\ndoi:10.1007/s10892-020-09333-3", "Brandt, Richard B., 1979, <em>A Theory of the Good and the\nRight</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.", "Brink, David O., 1989, <em>Moral Realism and the Foundations of\nEthics</em>, (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy), Cambridge\u202f; New\nYork/Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511624612", "Brun, Georg, 2014, \u201cReflective Equilibrium Without\nIntuitions?\u201d, <em>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice</em>, 17(2):\n237\u2013252. doi:10.1007/s10677-013-9432-5", "Cath, Yuri, 2016, \u201cReflective Equilibrium\u201d, in <em>The\nOxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodology</em>, Herman Cappelen,\nTamar Szab\u00f3 Gendler, and John Hawthorne (eds), Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 213\u2013230.\ndoi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.32", "Cohen, G.
