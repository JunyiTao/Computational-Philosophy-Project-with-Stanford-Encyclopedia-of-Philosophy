Inherentists and Attributionists\n\n\u201cInherentists\u201d believe that there are experiences that are\ninherently religious or mystical. \u201cAttributionists\u201d believe that there\nare no inherently religious or mystical experiences (see Proudfoot\n1985) \u2014 experiences are only deemed religious by\nthe subject or a group. Ann Taves contends that people or\ngroups have experiences of what afterward strikes them\nas \u201cspecial.\u201d Only then, depending on various factors, will\nthey attribute a religious or mystical meaning to\nthem (Taves 2009). Some neuropsychological\nresearch seems to support this position (Azari et\nal. 2001). Taves also rejects constructivism: constructivists\nsee religious or mystical experiences to be constituted from the\nvery start by cultural conditioning, but attributionists\ndeny this in favor of a tiered or\n\u201cblock-building\u201d approach from experiencing something\n\u201cspecial\u201d to a religious or mystical conclusion.\n\nWilliam Forgie (1984 and 1994) argues, as would an\nattributionist, that there could not be an \u201cexperience of God\u201d if\nwe understand \u201cexperience of God\u201d to mean that it is\nphenomenologically given in the experience itself that\nan experience is in fact of God. He argues that phenomenological\ncontent can consist only of general features and not features\nspecifically identifying God as the object of experience. He compares\nthis to seeing one of two identical twins. Which one of the two you\nperceive cannot be a phenomenological given. Likewise, that\nsomeone experiences precisely God and not something else cannot\nbe a phenomenological datum. Pike (1992, chap. 7) argues,\nagainst Forgie, that the individuation of an object can be a component\nof the phenomenological content of an experience, drawing on examples\nfrom sense-perception.\n\nWe can distinguish \u201cinherently religious\u201d from \u201cinherently\nmystical.\u201d Today it is increasingly becoming apparent that\nmystical experiences are real: there is evidence of distinctive\nconfigurations of brain activity uniquely associated with mystical\nexperiences (e.g., Newberg, d\u2019Aquili, and Rause\n2001, 143; Yaden et al. 2017, 60). However, by\n\u201creal,\u201d neuroscientists mean only that mystical experiences\ninvolve distinct neurological events and are not merely ordinary\nexperiences interpreted as mystical or products of the imagination,\nnot that they are necessarily cognitive. If unique patterns of\nbrain activity do underlie different mystical experiences,\nthen it may be that there are some experiences that are inherently\nmystical even though their significance varies\nbetween different religious and nonreligious experiencers and\nthus these experiences are not inherently\nreligious. \n",
