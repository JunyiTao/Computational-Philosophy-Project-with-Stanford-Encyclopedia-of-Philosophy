    "main_text": "Works || The Letters on Sympathy\n3.1 The Letters on Sympathy\n\nThe Letters on Sympathy were first drafted in 1791 or 1792,\nbut published in 1798 alongside a translation of Smith\u2019s\nTheory of Moral Sentiment and Origins of Language.\nAccording to Grouchy\u2019s daughter, Grouchy decided to translate\nSmith because she needed money. It also provided her with the\nopportunity to publish her own response to Smith. She ensured that it\ndid not get mistaken for a simple introduction by printing it at the\nend of the translations, rather than the beginning.\n\nGrouchy is enthusiastic about Smith\u2019s views\u2014she agrees\nwith him that moral sentiments and judgments can be derived from\nsympathy and that we need to develop our rational abilities in order\nto render this capacity useful. But she takes issue with certain\naspects of those views. In particular, she feels that he has not dug\nsufficiently deep in order to understand what sympathy is. He has\nnoted \u201cits existence, and its principal effects\u201d, but not\ngone back to \u201cits first cause, showing how it must belong to all\nsensible beings capable of reflection\u201d (Letter I, p.3). This\nfirst cause she traces back to infanthood, and to the very physical\nrelationship of a baby with its nurse. Grouchy does not talk about\nmothers there. She is careful to distinguish between the physical\nrelationship, skin on skin, feeding, and the moral one, the duty a\nmother may have to nurture her children, and the duties of the\nchildren to love and respect their mother. In that she differs from\nManon Roland and Mary Wollstonecraft who thought that an infant needed\nto be fed by his own mother in order to flourish morally. What Grouchy\nis looking for is a physical trigger to the sensations of pleasure and\npain that will eventually give rise to sentiments of sympathy, and\nthis trigger has to be common to all human beings in order to account\nfor the ubiquitous presence of sympathy in human societies. Every baby\nthat survives to an age where they may develop sentiments will have\nbeen fed by another human, and there will have been no previous\nuniversal experience suited to stimulate the sensations that can lead\nto these sentiments. Grouchy not only traces sympathy back to its\norigins, but her account is distinctly naturalistic. This cashes out\nin her description of the growth of sympathy and the birth of\nmorality.\n\nThe text takes the form of eight letters, addressed to C***. Although\nsome readers have conjectured that C*** was her husband, Condorcet,\nthere is evidence that the letters are addressed to her\nbrother-in-law, close friend and collaborator Pierre-George Cabanis.\nCabanis shared an interest with Grouchy on the role of physiology in\nhuman behavior and morality, as well as in social reforms.\n\nThe eight letters function like chapters and take the reader through\nthe argument, which starts with the origins of sympathy, and end with\nthe application of the theory developed to social, legal and political\nreform. Although the format is epistolary, there is no question that\nthese are not real letters but chapters of a short treatise. The\nargument sustained throughout the text and the addresses to C*** at\nthe beginning and at the end serve as transition passages from one\npart of the argument to the other.\n\nThe first letter explains how the author is going to depart from\nSmith\u2019s own argument. Smith, she says, has merely postulated\nsympathy as a human disposition, but what is needed in order to\nunderstand more fully the workings of sympathy is an inquiry into its\norigins. She then goes on to argue that these origins are\nphysiological in nature, arising from an infant\u2019s first human,\nskin on skin contact (with her nurse) and the discovery of pleasure\nand pain. The next two letters offer a theory of the development of\nsympathy through reason, showing how we extend our sympathy to a\ngreater circle as we develop, and distinguishing between different\nsorts of sympathies. Letters IV and V offer an account of the origins\nof morality out of sympathy, in which the author mostly agrees with\nSmith. In the final three letters Grouchy explores the implications of\nher theory for the legal, social, economic and political reforms\ncalled for, and made possible, by the French Revolution.\n",
