Ullmann-Margalit and Morgenbesser (1977) discuss\n\u201cpicking,\u201d which is characterized by indifference between\nalternatives, such as when one pick's between cans of the same flavor\nof Cambell's soup. By stipulation, picking can't appeal to values,\npreferences, or the sense of rationality discussed above\u2014those\nthings undertermine which alternative is optimal, which gives rise to\nthe indifference in the first place. Importantly for Ullmann-Margalit\nand Morgenbesser, picking extends beyond trivial \u201cCambell's soup\u201d\nchoices to bigger ones, including transformative experiences. Even our\nvalues and preferences  themselves (assuming we have control over\nthem) may be subject to picking, since it's would be circular\nto appeal to them in order to explain why we hold them. Thus,\nmany of our major life decisions, including potentially transformative\nones, are subject to picking, rather than rational choice.\n\nContinuing this line of thought, Ullmann-Margalit (2006) suggests that\nrather than focusing on acting rational in the sense of\n\u201coptimizing\u201d (as one does with standard\ndecision-procedures), one ought to focus on \u201cacting\nreasonably\u201d. For instance, transformation involves both\ndiscontinuity in one\u2019s life as well as a point of no return. A\nreasonable way of navigating choices that involve these two\nfeatures involves attempting to minimize those features. For instance,\na person contemplating a transformative decision like marriage might\ntry to ease into it by first moving in with their potential spouse.\nDoing so minimizes the discontinuity and gives them an out, which\nmakes the decision revocable. If Ullmann-Margalit is correct in\nsuggesting that one might be able to build up to a transformative\nexperience little by little, this raises an extremely interesting\nquestion for transformations that unfold gradually over time. Is it\npossible that each incremental step can be made rationally while a\ngiant leap to transformation cannot be made rationally?\n",
