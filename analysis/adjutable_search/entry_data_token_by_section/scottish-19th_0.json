    "main_text": "The Enlightenment Background\n1. The Enlightenment Background\n\nWhile the Scottish philosophers of the 18th century are\nstudied extensively, the philosophers who worked in Scotland's\nuniversities during the 19th century are generally\nneglected, and in many cases virtually unknown. Francis Hutcheson,\nDavid Hume and Thomas Reid and are names familiar to almost all\nphilosophers; Sir William Hamilton, James Frederick Ferrier, Alexander\nBain, Edward Caird and Andrew Seth to very few. Yet it is in the 19th\ncentury that something called \u201cScottish philosophy\u201d came\nto consciousness, and gained an honored place in the international\nacademy of its day. Across Europe and North America, and even in\nAustralasia, for most of the 19th century Scottish philosophy was held\nin very high regard.It was only with the turn of the 20th century that\nits star fell, and did so surprisingly rapidly. To understand this\ndecline in reputation, it is necessary to see 19th century\nScottish philosophy against the background of the century that\npreceded it.\n\nAccording to George Davie there is an\n\nopposition\u2026between\u2026two contrasting positions that in\ntheir tension provided Scottish philosophy with its central problem:\nthe Berkeleian system, according to which, in the interests of\nreconciling progress with traditional standards, we are to set aside\nthe instincts of the farmer in favour of the sophistication of the\nphilosopher and to think with the learned while we talk with the\nvulgar; and the Hutchesonian system, according to which, with the same\naim of reconciling material advance with the intellectual principle,\nwe are to respect the instincts of the farmer as against the\nsophistication of the philosopher and initiate a sort of dialogue\nbetween the vulgar and the learned, instead of talking down to the\nfarmer from the standpoint of the philosopher. (Davie 1994,\n41\u20132)\n\n\nCast in these terms it is easy to place the two most famous\nphilosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment on either side of the\ndivide. On the side of the first is Hume, whose skeptical conclusions\narise from the Berkeleyan presupposition asserted in the very first\nsentence of his Treatise of Human Nature:\n\nAll the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two\ndistinct kinds, which I shall call impressions and\nideas. The difference betwixt these consists in the degrees\nof force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind. (Hume\n1739, 1)\n\n\nOn the other side is Thomas Reid, for whom the errors of Hume result\nfrom the boldness of his starting point.\n\nIt is genius, and not the want of it, that adulterates philosophy, and\nfills it with error and false theory. A creative imagination disdains\nthe mean offices of digging for a foundation, of removing rubbish, and\ncarrying materials: leaving these servile employments to the drudges\nin science, it plans a design, and raises a fabric. (Reid 1764, 15)\n\n\nThe problem as Reid saw it was that a highly theoretical philosophy\nwas trying to run before it could walk, because in sharp contrast to\nsubjects that are \u201creally sciences\u201d\u2014mechanics,\nastronomy and optics are the examples he gives\u2014\n\nwhen we turn our attention inward and consider the phaenomena of human\nthoughts, opinions and perceptions, and endeavour to trace them to the\ngeneral laws and first principles of our constitution, we are\nimmediately involved in darkness and perplexity. And if common sense,\nor the principles of education, happen not to be stubborn, it is odds\nbut we end in absolute skepticism. (Reid 1764, 16)\n\n\nIt is well known that, on Reid's analysis, Hume's skepticism derives\nin large part from his implicit subscription to the \u201cway of\nideas\u201d, a conception of knowledge and experience that finds its\norigins in Descartes, Malebranche and Locke, and its most dramatic\nexposition in Berkeley who, though no skeptic, \u201cproved by\nunanswerable arguments what no man in his senses could believe\u201d\n(Reid 1997, 20). The antidote to such skepticism is common sense, but\nnot of the robust sort displayed by Dr. Johnson when he purported to\nrefute Berkeley by kicking a stone. \u201cCommon sense\u201d can\nmean two things, in fact: widespread popular conviction on the one\nhand, or on the other, the basic principles at work in human reasoning\nand belief formation. Widespread conviction can be false, of course,\nwhich is why the method of the School of Common Sense was thought\nsuspect by many, described by Kant, for example, as a stratagem by\nwhich \u201cthe stalest windbag can confidently take up with the\nsoundest thinker\u201d (Kant 1783, 259]). But in Reid at any\nrate, philosophical inquiry into the human mind is not a matter of\nmaking popular opinion the test of truth, but of initiating a\n\u201cdialogue between the vulgar and the learned\u201d (to repeat\nDavie's happy phrase) in which proper weight is attached to actual\nminds at work.\n\nThere is, then, this deep division within the philosophy of the\nScottish Enlightenment, yet it occurs within a context of striking\nunanimity also. \u201cWise men now agree, or ought to agree in this,\nthat there is but one way to the knowledge of nature's works; the way\nof observation and experiment\u201d Reid writes (Reid 1764, 11),\nthereby endorsing the express intention of Hume to \u201cintroduce\nthe experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects\u201d (the\nsubtitle of the Treatise). Both remarks reflect a commitment\nto the project of a \u201cscience of mind\u201d, a project common to\nall the major Scottish philosophers of the period. Thus George\nTurnbull (Reid's teacher) writing in 1740 says \u201cI was led long\nago to apply myself to the study of the human mind in the same way as\nto that of the human body\u201d (quoted in Davie 1994, 24)\n\nIn short, both division and unanimity are present within eighteenth\ncentury Scottish philosophy, unanimity with respect to aim\u2014a\nscience of mind\u2014and division with respect to method\u2014the\n\u201cprinciples of common sense\u201d versus \u201cthe way of\nideas\u201d. This is a tension, however, within only one part of\n18th century Scottish philosophy, namely the philosophy of\nsensation and perception, and not perhaps the most influential part.\nThe Scottish Enlightenment is in many ways more marked by the type of\nthinking about social and political topics that we find in Adam Smith\nand Adam Ferguson, as well as Hume, who in this respect take their cue\nfrom Hutcheson. The example par excellence is Smith's\nTheory of Moral Sentiments (1759; 6th edition\n1790), where the Humean ambition of countering the \u201cbooks of\ndivinity and abstruse metaphysics\u201d (Treatise) was\nfurthered by a sympathetic attention to how human beings in society\nactually are, and what social forms and political arrangements will\nbest work to their happiness and well being.\n\nIn the 19th century, this strand of Enlightenment thinking\nceased to be an important part of the philosophical agenda. That\nagenda was dominated, rather, by the \u201cscience of mind\u201d\nmore narrowly conceived, that is to say logic (i.e., the philosophy of\ntruth and reason) and the philosophy of perception.\n",
