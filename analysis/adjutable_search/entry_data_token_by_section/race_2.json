    "main_text": "Race versus Ethnicity\n3. Race versus Ethnicity\n\nStephen Cornell and Douglas Hartmann (1998) provide a helpful\ndiscussion of the differences between the concepts of race and\nethnicity. Relying on social constructivism, they define race as\n\u201ca human group defined by itself or others as distinct by virtue\nof perceived common physical characteristics that are held to be\ninherent\u2026Determining which characteristics constitute the\nrace\u2026is a choice human beings make. Neither markers nor\ncategories are predetermined by any biological factors\u201d (Cornell\nand Hartmann 1998, 24). Ethnicity, conversely, is defined as a sense\nof common ancestry based on cultural attachments, past linguistic\nheritage, religious affiliations, claimed kinship, or some physical\ntraits (1998, 19). Racial identities are typically thought of as\nencompassing multiple ethnic identities (Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n26). Thus, people who are racially categorized as black may possess a\nvariety of ethnic identities based either on African national or\ncultural markers (e.g., Kenyan, Igbo, Zulu) or the newer national,\nsub-national, or trans-national identities created through the mixing\nof enslaved populations in the Americas (e.g., African American,\nHaitian, West Indian).\n\nCornell and Hartmann outline five additional characteristics that\ndistinguish race from ethnicity: racial identity is typically\nexternally imposed by outsiders, as when whites created the Negro race\nto homogenize the multiple ethnic groups they conquered in Africa or\nbrought as slaves to America; race is a result of early globalization,\nwhen European explorers \u201cdiscovered\u201d and then conquered\npeoples with radically different phenotypical traits; race typically\ninvolves power relations, from the basic power to define the race of\nothers to the more expansive power to deprive certain racial groups of\nsocial, economic, or political benefits; racial identities are\ntypically hierarchical, with certain races being perceived as superior\nto others; and racial identity is perceived as inherent, something\nindividuals are born with (1998, 27\u201329).\n\nRace and ethnicity differ strongly in the level of agency that\nindividuals exercise in choosing their identity. Individuals rarely\nhave any choice over their racial identity, due to the immediate\nvisual impact of the physical traits associated with race. Individuals\nare thought to exercise more choice over ethnic identification, since\nthe physical differences between ethnic groups are typically less\nstriking, and since individuals can choose whether or not to express\nthe cultural practices associated with ethnicity. So an individual who\nphenotypically appears white with ancestors from Ireland can more\nreadily choose whether to assert their Irish identity (by celebrating\nSt. Patrick\u2019s Day) than whether to choose their white identity\n(Cornell and Hartmann 1998, 29\u201330). Moreover, Mary Waters (1990)\nargues that the high level of intermarriage among white Americans from\nvarious national ancestries grants their children significant\n\u201cethnic options\u201d in choosing with which of their multiple\nheritages to identify. Waters (1999) and Philip Kasinitz (1992)\ndocument how phenotypically black West Indian immigrants exercise\nagency in asserting their ethnic identity in order to differentiate\nthemselves from native-born African Americans, but discrimination and\nviolence aimed at all Black people, regardless of ethnicity, strongly\nconstrains such agency.The greater constraints on racial identity stem\nfrom the role of informal perceptions, discriminatory social action,\nand formal laws imposing racial identity, such as Census\ncategorization (Nobles 2000), the infamous \u201chypodescent\u201d\nlaws, which defined people as black if they had one drop of African\nblood (Davis 1991), and judicial decisions such as the\n\u201cprerequisite cases,\u201d which determined whether specific\nimmigrants could be classified as white and thus eligible for\nnaturalized citizenship (Lopez 1996).\n\nThe line between race and ethnicity gets blurred in the case of Asians\nand Latinos in the United States. Yen Le Espiritu (1992) notes that\nAsian American racial identity, which of course encompasses a\nremarkable level of ethnic diversity, results from a combination of\nexternal assignment and agency, as when Asians actively respond to\nanti-Asian discrimination or violence through political action and a\nsense of shared fate. Consequently, Espiritu uses the term\n\u201cpanethnicity\u201d to describe Asian American identity, a\nconcept which has racial connotations, given the role of \u201cracial\nlumping\u201d together of members of diverse Asian ethnicities into a\nsingle racial group defined by phenotypical traits. Thus, she declares\nthat \u201cAfrican Americans [are] the earliest and most developed\npan-ethnic group in the United States\u201d (1992, 174). Hispanic or\nLatino identity exhibits traits similar to pan-ethnicity. Indeed,\nunlike Asian identity, Hispanic identity is not even a formal racial\nidentity under the Census. However, informal perceptions, formal laws,\nand discrimination based on physical appearance nevertheless tend to\nlump together various nationalities and ethnicities that share some\nconnection to Latin America (Rodriquez 2000). Moreover, scholars have\nnoted that Jews (Brodkin 1998) and the Irish (Ignatiev 1995) were once\nwere considered distinct, non-white races but are now considered to be\nracially white ethnic groups, partly by exercising agency in\ndistancing themselves from African Americans exercising political\npower. Thus, it is conceivable that groups today considered to be\nsociological racial groups could transform into something more like an\nethnic group. For this reason, Blum describes Hispanics and Asians as\nincompletely racialized groups (Blum 2002, 149\u2013155).\n\nA robust philosophical debate has emerged regarding the status of\nHispanic or Latino identity. Jorge Gracia (2000) defends the utility\nof Hispanic ethnic identity as grounded primarily in the shared,\nlinguistic culture that can be traced to the Iberian Peninsula. Jorge\nGarcia (2001, 2006) challenges this approach, arguing that the\ndiversity of individual experiences undermines the use of Hispanic\nethnicity as a meaningful form of collective identity. Linda Martin\nAlcoff (2006) develops a \u201crealist\u201d defense of Latino\nidentity against charges of essentialism and views it as a category of\nsolidarity that develops in reaction to white privilege. Christina\nBeltran (2010), on the other hand, does not try to paper over the\ndiversity within Latinidad, which she instead portrays as a\npluralistic, fragmented, and agonistic form of political action.\n",
