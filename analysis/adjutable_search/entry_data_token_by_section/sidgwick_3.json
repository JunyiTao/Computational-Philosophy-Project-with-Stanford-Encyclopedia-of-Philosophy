    "main_text": "Epistemology and Chaos\n3. Epistemology and Chaos\n\nPerhaps no region of Sidgwick\u2019s work has been the subject of\ngreater interpretive controversy than his epistemology. The early work\nof Schneewind (1963), Rawls (1971, and Schultz ([ed.] 1992) played up\nthe dialectical side of Sidgwick\u2019s approach and the ways in\nwhich he anticipated the Rawlsian account of the method of reflective\nequilibrium. Reactions to any such interpretation, which supposedly\naccorded a too generous role to \u201creceived opinion\u201d in\nSidgwick\u2019s methodology, came from Peter Singer (1974) and many\nothers influenced by Hare\u2019s critique of Rawls (see also Sverdlik\n1985, and especially, Skelton 2007, 2008, 2010a,b). Rawls himself\nshifted his ground somewhat in later work, playing up Sidgwick\u2019s\n\u201crational intuitionism\u201d (Rawls 1993, 2007). But other\naccounts, notably Brink (1994), Shaver (1999, 2011, 2014) and Phillips\n(2022), have recognized that Sidgwick\u2019s approach contains both\ndialectical and more purely intuitionist elements, debating whether\nthese can be combined in a consistent or coherent way. Recent work on\nSidgwick has also benefited from the renaissance in and rehabilitation\nof intuitionism, evident in such works as Audi (1997), Parfit\n(2011\u20132017), and Stratton-Lake ([ed.] 2002); the latter contains\nan important contribution by Crisp that effectively distances\nSidgwick\u2019s views from cruder versions of intuitionism, though\nDeigh (2010) has argued forcefully that Sidgwick was too committed to\nan axiomatic approach that was undermined by developments in\nanalytical philosophy, a point in some ways reminiscent of\nDonagan\u2019s (1977) critique of Sidgwick\u2019s intuitionism.\nSchultz (2013, 2014a) surveys the development of some of these\ndebates, and emphasizes the role of consensus in Sidgwick\u2019s\nepistemology, a factor also figuring in the Sidgwickian methodology\ndeveloped by Parfit (2011\u20132017). But this is a very lively area\nof research in which the history of English moral philosophy from\nWhewell to Ross is still being actively rewritten in dramatic fashion\n(Hurka [ed.] 2011; 2014a). Yet it does appear that in the last decade,\nthe scholarly emphasis has been disproportionately on Sidgwick and his\nsuccessors, notably Ross, rather than Sidgwick and his predecessors,\nnotably Whewell, who remains a comparatively neglected figure (Snyder\n2001 [2019], 2006).\n\nSidgwick\u2019s epistemology is linked to other significant\ncontroversies as well, such as those concerning the degree to which he\ncan really be classified as a utilitarian, in any unqualified fashion.\nFor Sidgwick argues, over the course of the Methods, that\ncommon-sense or intuitional morality keeps giving way to more abstract\nformal principles as the better candidates for genuinely self-evident\ntruths. Although there is some controversy over just how many such\nprinciples he advances, at the least he defends a universalizability\nprinciple (one must be able to will one\u2019s maxim to be a\nuniversal law) and a principle of rational prudence (or temporal\nneutrality, such that one should be ceteris paribus equally\nconcerned with all parts of one\u2019s life), in addition to the\nutilitarian principle of rational benevolence. Controversially, he\nholds that the universalizability principle is merely formal and lacks\ncontent, being consistent with both egoism and utilitarianism, and\nthat temporal neutrality translates into a form of prudence. And in\nfact, even utilitarianism is actually derived from two more\nfundamental principles, and involves the \u201crelation of the\nintegrant parts to the whole and to each other\u201d in order to\nobtain \n\n\nthe self-evident principle that the good of any one individual is of\nno more importance, from the point of view (if I may say so) of the\nUniverse, than the good of any other; unless, that is, there are\nspecial grounds for believing the more good is likely to be realised\nin the one case than in the other. And it is evident to me that as a\nrational being I am bound to aim at good generally,\u2014so far as it\nis attainable by my efforts,\u2014not at a particular part of it.\n\n\n\nAnd from \n\n\nthese two rational intuitions we may deduce, as a necessary inference,\nthe maxim of Benevolence in an abstract form: viz. that each one is\nmorally bound to regard the good of any other individual as much as\nhis own, except in so far as he judges it to be less, when impartially\nviewed, or less certainly knowable or attainable by him. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 382]) \n\n\nThus, in his more careful statements of the candidates for\nself-evident truths, Sidgwick refrains from formulations directly\ninvoking \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d\nor hedonistic considerations. Some of the most sophisticated\ncommentary on the Methods, such as Schneewind (1977), Shaver\n(1999, 2014), Nakano-Okuno (2011), Parfit (2011\u20132017), Phillips\n(2011, 2022), de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2014, 2016), Hurka (2014a),\nand Crisp (2015), has highlighted the gap between these\n\u201caxioms\u201d and the substantive ethical theories derived or\ndeveloped from them. Sidgwick himself appreciated the irony of his\nposition, the way in which the hard-headed, reformist utilitarian\nemphasis on clarity and conclusiveness had dissipated in his work:\nthere are indeed \n\n\ncertain absolute practical principles, the truth of which, when they\nare explicitly stated, is manifest; but they are of too abstract a\nnature, and too universal in their scope, to enable us to ascertain by\nimmediate application of them what we ought to do in any particular\ncase; particular duties have still to be determined by some other\nmethod. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 379]) \n\n\nCommon-sense rules have their place, but are not even clear enough to\nserve as the \u201cmiddle axioms\u201d of the utilitarian theory. As\nhe put it to Dakyns: \n\n\nEthics is losing its interest for me rather, as the insolubility of\nits fundamental problem is impressed on me. I think the contribution\nto the formal clearness & coherence of our ethical\nthought which I have to offer is just worth giving: for a few\nspeculatively-minded persons\u2014very few. And as for all practical\nquestions of interest, I feel as if I had now to begin at the\nbeginning and learn the ABC. (Memoir: 277)\n\n\nWorse still, all was not happy even in the ethereal region of the\naxioms. The \u201cinsolubility\u201d of the \u201cfundamental\nproblem\u201d of ethics\u2014the key problem that had troubled\nSidgwick in the 1860s\u2014was indeed on display in Sidgwick\u2019s\ntreatise, in that he did not find the unified account of practical\nreason that he sought even at the more abstract level. As he had put\nit in an earlier letter to his friend Dakyns: \n\n\nYou know I want intuitions for Morality; at least one (of Love) is\nrequired to supplement the utilitarian morality, and I do not see why,\nif we are to have one, we may not have others. I have worked away\nvigorously at the selfish morality, but I cannot persuade myself,\nexcept by trusting intuition, that Christian self-sacrifice is really\na happier life than classical insouciance. (Memoir: 90) \n\n\nThe problem of self-sacrifice and the claims of rational egoism were\nnot, on Sidgwick\u2019s view, amenable to the same form of\nreconciliation with utilitarianism that intuitional morality was. In\nfact, the first edition of the Methods concludes that\nrational egoism and utilitarianism end up in a stand-off, that there\nis a \u201cdualism of the practical reason\u201d, and that as a\nresult, there is a \u201cfundamental contradiction in our apparent\nintuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct\u201d such that \n\n\nthe \u201cCosmos\u201d of Duty is thus really reduced to a Chaos,\nand the prolonged effort of the human intellect to frame a perfect\nideal of rational conduct is seen to have been foredoomed to\ninevitable failure. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 473]) \n\n\nLater editions of the work sounded a somewhat less bleak concluding\nnote, but did not differ in substance. The main possible solutions to\nthe problem that Sidgwick considered are two, a weakening of\nepistemological standards, or a Theistic postulate about the coherent\nmoral government of the universe. On the first, he suggests that if\n\n\n\nwe find that in our supposed knowledge of the world of nature\npropositions are commonly taken to be universally true, which seem to\nrest on no other ground than that we have a strong disposition to\naccept them, and that they are indispensable to the systematic\ncoherence of our beliefs,\u2014it will be more difficult to reject a\nsimilarly supported assumption in ethics, without opening the door to\nuniversal scepticism. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 509]) \n\n\nOn the second, he explains that if \n\n\nwe may assume the existence of such a Being, as God, by the\nconsensus of theologians, is conceived to be, it seems that\nUtilitarians may legitimately infer the existence of Divine sanctions\nto the code of social duty as constructed on a Utilitarian basis; and\nsuch sanctions would, of course, suffice to make it always every\none\u2019s interest to promote universal happiness to the best of his\nknowledge. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 506])\n\n\nSidgwick often departed from the pristine language of the axioms when\ndescribing this conflict. In another important essay on his own work,\nhe explained that along with \n\n\n(a) a fundamental moral conviction that I ought to sacrifice my own\nhappiness, if by so doing I can increase the happiness of others to a\ngreater extent than I diminish my own, I find also (b) a\nconviction\u2014which it would be paradoxical to call\n\u201cmoral\u201d, but which is none the less fundamental\u2014that\nit would be irrational to sacrifice any portion of my own happiness\nunless the sacrifice is to be somehow at some time compensated by an\nequivalent addition to my own happiness. (Sidgwick 1889: 483) \n\n\nHe urges that each of these convictions has as much clarity and\ncertainty \u201cas the process of introspective can give\u201d and\neach also finds wide assent \u201cin the common sense of\nmankind\u201d. Moreover, his account of rational egoism does not rely\non a narrow or low-minded account of self-interest. Besides\n\n\nadmitting the actual importance of sympathetic pleasures to the\nmajority of mankind, I should go further and maintain that, on\nempirical grounds alone, enlightened self-interest would direct most\nmen to foster and develop their sympathetic susceptibilities to a\ngreater extent than is now commonly attained. The effectiveness of\nButler\u2019s famous argument against the vulgar antithesis between\nSelf-love and Benevolence is undeniable: and it seems scarcely\nextravagant to say that, amid all the profuse waste of the means of\nhappiness which men commit, there is no imprudence more flagrant than\nthat of Selfishness in the ordinary sense of the term,\u2014the\nexcessive concentration of attention on the individual\u2019s own\nhappiness which renders it impossible for him to feel any strong\ninterest in the pleasures and pains of others. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n501])\n\n\nStill, he found it impossible to deny that even very high-minded\nversions of egoism posed a problem, prescribing actions conflicting\nwith the general good in such cases as heroic sacrifice of self in\nbattle, etc. This view, he suggested, could be found in Butler\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cReasonable Self-love and Conscience are the two\nchief or superior principles in the nature of man\u201d, each\ngenerating an obligation, though Frankena (1992), Darwall (2000) and\nCrisp (2019) have raised questions about the historical accuracy of\nthis attribution. But in any event, the basic point is that if \n\n\nthe Egoist strictly confines himself to stating his conviction that he\nought to take his own happiness or pleasure as his ultimate end, there\nseems no opening for an argument to lead him to Utilitarianism (as a\nfirst principle). But if he offers either as a reason for this\nconviction, or as another form of stating it, the proposition that his\nhappiness or pleasure is objectively \u201cdesirable\u201d or\n\u201ca good\u201d, he gives the requisite opening. For the\nUtilitarian can then point out that his happiness cannot be\nmore objectively desirable or more a good than the happiness of any\none else; the mere fact \u2026 that he is he can have\nnothing to do with its objective desirability or goodness. (Sidgwick\n1873: 259\u201360) \n\n\nBut the egoist need not make that move\u2014it is just as rational\nsimply to take one\u2019s own point of view as it is to take the\npoint of view of the universe\u2014of the utilitarian\nsuperperson.\n\nSidgwick\u2019s dualism has a long history of stimulating\ncontroversy, even leading some commentators to urge that he is better\ntermed a \u201cdualist\u201d or \u201cdual-source theorist\u201d\nthan a utilitarian (Crisp 2002, 2014, 2015). Moore (1903) famously\ndismissed the problem on the grounds that the notion of one\u2019s\n\u201cown good\u201d was nonsense, but Mackie (1976) sharply\ncountered that Moore was begging the question. Broad (1930) claimed\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s account was confused, since his proposed\nsolutions did not touch the problem of the inconsistent fundamental\nprinciples, though this has been effectively addressed by Coady\n(1994), Schneewind (1977) and many others. Brink (1988) has argued\nthat it is absurd to claim that two self-evident principles are\ninconsistent, but Shaver (1999) has replied that Sidgwick is for the\nmost part consistent in calling the principles at issue only\n\u201capparently\u201d self-evident, though Shaver also suggests\nthat Sidgwick did not present a compelling case for the egoistic side\nof the conflict. Skorupski (2000) has forcefully argued that there is\nno dualism of the \u201cpure\u201d practical reason, which is agent\nneutral, but there are many such conflicts in the larger field of less\nthan pure practical reason, not merely a conflict with egoistic\nreasons. Parfit, too, argued that Sidgwick\u2019s two standpoints\napproach failed to capture how egoistic reasons can be weaker than\nomnipersonal ones (Parfit 2011a,b), though Smith (2009) has defended\nSidgwick\u2019s construction of the problem. And Baier (1995) argued\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s account suffers from various ambiguities because\nhe does not clearly distinguish \u201crequiring\u201d reasons from\n\u201cpermissive\u201d ones, which would avoid the contradiction.\nIndeed, more generally, it is telling that many of Sidgwick\u2019s\nmost notable admirers, such as Larmore (1996) and Parfit\n(2011\u20132017), do not carry all the baggage of his epistemological\nintuitionism but prefer instead to translate his arguments into the\nidiom of objective normative \u201creasons\u201d. Indeed, Parfit\ncalled his deeply Sidgwickian view a form of non-naturalistic,\nnon-metaphysical moral rationalism. And in his major works on the\nMethods, Phillips (2011, 2022) reconstructs Sidgwick\u2019s\narguments in a similar, Parfitian way, while retaining more of\nSidgwick\u2019s terminology. He also, in Phillips (2022:\n210\u201331), provides an excellent overview of the various positions\non the Sidgwickian dualism. Thus, in one vocabulary or another, these\ncontroversies are likely to continue as long as there is such a thing\nas ethical philosophy.\n\nThe issue is worth illustrating in more detail, given the importance\nof recent work in this area. Thus, unlike Sidgwick, but like Crisp\n(2006b, 2015) and Phillips (2011, 2022), Parfit did not regard\npractical reason as teetering on chaos or think it a cosmic calamity\nif we could not demonstrate that we always have most objective reason\nto do what would be impartially best, or that impartial and egoistic\nreasons can be harmonized, though he did think it would be a cosmic\ncalamity if there were no objective normative reasons (Edmonds 2023).\nWhen it came to Sidgwick\u2019s dualism, he was content to sort out\nthe complex of objective reasons that we might have, without going so\nfar as to worry about the absurdity of a universe in which Own Good\nand Other Good might be left in conflict, and he even pronounced\nSidgwick\u2019s \u201csomber claims\u201d on this score\n\u201coverstatements\u201d, and the result of an unhelpful\n\u201ctwo standpoints\u201d framework of self and other that misses\nhow we can compare the strength of different reasons. Parfit urged\nthat Sidgwick\u2019s more plausible, revised claim is simply: \n\n\nWhen one of our two possible acts would make things go in some way\nthat would be impartially better, but the other act would make things\ngo better either for ourselves or for those to whom we have close\nties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of these two\nways. (Parfit 2011a: 137) \n\n\nThus, Sidgwick drew the conflict too narrowly, between impartial and\negoistic reasons; he failed to consider the full range of less than\nfully impartial reasons and how they may or may not be comparatively\nstronger than impartial ones. He also failed to consider the relevance\nof a Reductionist view of personal identity in undermining egoism.\nIndeed, Parfit went even further in elaborating the complex of\nobjective reasons, allowing not only that we might have personal and\npartial, but not self-interested reasons that could outweigh impartial\nreasons, but also that, if we are not act consequentialists, we might\nfind conflicts between impartial reasons and moral reasons, such as\ndeontological ones (Parfit 2017). As Crisp (2006b, 2015) has argued,\nand as Parfit clearly admitted, Sidgwick himself took a less elaborate\nview. But for all his revisionism, Parfit did reflect Sidgwick\u2019s\nviews at a great many points, not least in taking very seriously the\nconsensus of experts criterion, which pushed him to develop his\n\u201cTriple Theory\u201d, a consequentializing convergence of rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian universalizability, and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Although the Triple Theory is at some distance from\nSidgwick\u2019s form of utilitarianism, Parfit denied that he had\ndismissed the viability of act consequentialism (de Lazari-Radek &\nSinger 2020).\n\nIn fact, the works of de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2012, 2014, 2016)\nhave opened up some ingenious new lines of argument in this area,\narguments that, they claim, are more thoroughly Sidgwickian. As noted,\nSidgwick had argued that apparently self-evident claims had to be\nclear and precise, able to withstand critical reflection, consistent\nwith one another, and able to win a consensus of experts, though in\nother writings he collapsed the first two into just one condition. De\nLazari-Radek and Singer seem less concerned to reject any element of\nSidgwick\u2019s account than to add to it, such that the significance\nof evolutionary \u201cdebunking\u201d arguments is recognized, and\nthis leads them to reject Sidgwick\u2019s Dualism:\n\n\nWe might have become reasoning beings because that enabled us to solve\na variety of problems that would otherwise have hampered our survival,\nbut once we are capable of reasoning, we may be unable to avoid\nrecognizing and discovering some truths that do not aid our survival.\nThat can be said about some complicated truths of mathematics or\nphysics. It can also, as Parfit has suggested, be the case with some\nof our normative epistemic beliefs; for instance, the belief that when\nsome argument is valid and has true premises, so that this\nargument\u2019s conclusion must be true, these facts give us a\ndecisive reason to believe this conclusion. Parfit argues that this\nnormative claim about what we have decisive reason to believe is not\nitself evolutionarily advantageous, since to gain that advantage, it\nwould have been sufficient to have the non-normative beliefs that the\nargument is valid, and has true premises, and that the conclusion must\nbe true. Hence this and other normative epistemic beliefs are not open\nto a debunking argument. This may also hold for some of our moral\nbeliefs. One such moral truth could be Sidgwick\u2019s axiom of\nuniversal benevolence: \u201ceach one is morally bound to regard the\ngood of any other individual as much as his own, except in so far as\nhe judges it to be less, when impartially viewed, or less certainly\nknowable or attainable by him\u201d. (de Lazari-Radek & Singer\n2014: 182\u201383)\n\n\nThus, if, with Sharon Street (2006), one holds that in many cases \n\n\nit is more scientifically plausible to explain human evaluative\nattitudes as having evolved because they help us to survive and to\nhave surviving offspring, than because they are true, (de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014: 180) \n\n\none can debunk many of the beliefs competing with the Axiom of\nUniversal Benevolence, such as those purportedly justifying partial or\npersonal reasons for action. If Benevolence is not debunked, and if it\ncan in fact be accounted for straightforwardly as a result of reason\ncoming as a unity or package, such that either \n\n\nwe have a capacity to reason that includes the capacity to do advanced\nphysics and mathematics and to grasp objective moral truths, or we\nhave a much more limited capacity to reason that lacks not only these\nabilities, but others that confer an overriding evolutionary\nadvantage. If reason is a unity of this kind, having the package would\nhave been more conducive to survival and reproductions than not having\nit. (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 183) \n\n\nOf course, as Parfit commented, one might concede that this argument\nhas some force, but think other objections to egoism, say from a\nReductionist view of personal identity, or Present-Aim account of\nrationality, also matter (Parfit 2017: 339\u201340).\n\nThat Singer, in particular, should in this way have developed\ndefenses, not only of Sidgwickian hedonism, esotericism, and totalism\n(in population ethics), but also of Sidgwickian metaethical\ncognitivism (against his former commitment to Hare\u2019s\nprescriptivism), and used these to advance a form of utilitarianism\nthat, he holds, is more consistently utilitarian than Sidgwick\u2019s\nown position and in that way in line with Sidgwick\u2019s deeper\ntendencies, is illustrative of the increasingly important role that\nSidgwick\u2019s work is playing in cutting edge ethical theory.\nWhether the principle of Universal Benevolence really has the ability\nto withstand evolutionary debunking arguments, and whether such\narguments can really be made compelling in the first place, are open\nquestions, as is the question of whether Sidgwick himself would not\nhave found such gambits too narrow and unable to address his deeper\nworries about the religious significance of the dualism of practical\nreason (Schultz 2014b, 2017; Gray 2015). But even so, these recent\ndevelopments amount to something of a Sidgwickian counter-revolution\nto the Rawlsian Kantian revolution, an effort at both the meta and\nsubstantive ethical levels to provide an effective cognitive\nintuitionist and consequentialist alternative to Kantian\nconstructivist and proceduralist accounts of moral reasons.\n\nAlthough Sidgwick denied that it was his special purpose, in the\nMethods, to call attention to the dualism of practical\nreason, this problem clearly loomed very large for him and affected\nmany other aspects of his life and work, including his views on the\nhistory of ethics: he thought egoism the dominant view of the\nclassical Greek philosophers, the difference between ancients and\nmoderns having largely to do with the modern preoccupation with\n\u201cought\u201d rather than \u201cgood\u201d and the emergence\nof the dualism in Butler (Frankena 1992; Irwin 1992, 1994, 2011; Crisp\n2015). Again, arguably, he never did full justice to non-hedonistic,\nteleological forms of perfectionism (Hurka 2001, [ed.] 2011, 2014a;\nCrisp 2015) or to fully deontological, Kantian views (Schneewind 1977;\nKorsgaard 2009). However, as the remarks above underscore, the range\nof his arguments is richer and more fertile than many of his critics\nhave recognized. Indeed, in his own day, he advanced effective\ncriticisms of the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer, the idealism of\nGreen and Bradley, and most of the other currents of philosophical\nopinion that he encountered. Weinstein (2000) argues effectively that\non key points Spencer and Sidgwick had much in common; Brink (2003)\nindicates just how intelligent and penetrating the exchanges between\nSidgwick and Green were, though he concludes that Green scored an\neffective point in charging that Sidgwick\u2019s hedonism was\nimplausible, even if coherent, a point that the recent hedonists are\nof course not willing to concede (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014,\n2016).\n\nIn the end, however, at least on the topic of classifying\nSidgwick\u2019s Methods as a work of classical\nutilitarianism, it remains difficult to dissent from\nSchneewind\u2019s summary of its heterodoxy: the Methods\n\n\ncenters on an examination of the accepted moral opinions and modes of\nthought of common sense. It involves a rejection of empiricism and\ndismisses the issue of determinism as irrelevant. It emphasizes an\nattempt to reconcile positions seen by utilitarians as deeply opposed\nto each other. It finds ethical egoism as reasonable as\nutilitarianism; and it concludes with arguments to show that, because\nof this, no full reconciliation of the various rational methods for\nreaching moral decisions is possible and therefore that the realm of\npractical reason is probably incoherent. (Schneewind 1974 [1992:\n94])\n\n\nThis helps explain why the work continues to inspire both utilitarians\nand their critics.\n",
