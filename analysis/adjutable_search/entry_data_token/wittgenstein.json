Biographical Sketch\n\nWittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a\nwealthy industrial family, well-situated in intellectual and cultural\nViennese circles. In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical\nengineering at Manchester University where his interest in the\nphilosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege\u2019s\nadvice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand Russell.\nRussell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: \u201cAn unknown German\nappeared \u2026 obstinate and perverse, but I think not\nstupid\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was\ncommitted: \u201cI shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do\ngreat things \u2026 I love him and feel he will solve the problems I\nam too old to solve\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell\u2019s\ninsight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and\nway of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical\nsensitivity.\n\nDuring his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein\nconducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of\nlogic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense\nrelationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to\nisolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these\nphilosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he\nreturned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I\n(1914\u20131918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in\n1918 and spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It\nwas during the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first\nimportant work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. After the war\nthe book was published in German and translated into English.\n\nIn the 1920s Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to\nhis mind, solved all philosophical problems in the\nTractatus), gave away his part of his family\u2019s fortune\nand pursued several \u2018professions\u2019 (gardener, teacher,\narchitect, etc.) in and around Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he\nreturned to Cambridge to resume his philosophical vocation, after\nhaving been exposed to discussions on the philosophy of mathematics\nand science with members of the Vienna Circle, whose conception of\nlogical empiricism was indebted to his Tractatus account of\nlogic as tautologous, and his philosophy as concerned with logical\nsyntax. During these first years in Cambridge his conception of\nphilosophy and its problems underwent dramatic changes that are\nrecorded in several volumes of conversations, lecture notes, and\nletters (e.g., Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle,\nThe Blue and Brown Books, Philosophical Grammar,\nPhilosophical Remarks). Sometimes termed the \u2018middle\nWittgenstein,\u2019 this period heralds a rejection of dogmatic\nphilosophy, including both traditional works and the\nTractatus itself.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at Cambridge,\ndeveloping most of the ideas that he intended to publish in his second\nbook, Philosophical Investigations. These included the turn\nfrom formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on\npsychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning\nphilosophy\u2019s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final\nmanuscript of the Philosophical Investigations, but, at the\nlast minute, withdrew it from publication (and only authorized its\nposthumous publication). For a few more years he continued his\nphilosophical work, but this is marked by a rich development of,\nrather than a turn away from, his second phase. He traveled during\nthis period to the United States and Ireland, and returned to\nCambridge, where he was diagnosed with cancer. Legend has it that, at\nhis death in 1951, his last words were \u201cTell them I\u2019ve had\na wonderful life\u201d (Monk: 579).\n2. The Early Wittgenstein\n2.1 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\n\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus was first published in German\nin 1921 and then translated\u2014by C.K. Ogden (and F. P.\nRamsey)\u2014and published in English in 1922. It was later\nre-translated by D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming out of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Notes on Logic (1913), \u201cNotes\nDictated to G. E. Moore\u201d (1914), his Notebooks, written\nin 1914\u201316, and further correspondence with Russell, Moore, and\nKeynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other cultural influences, it\nevolved as a continuation of and reaction to Russell and Frege\u2019s\nconceptions of logic and language. Russell supplied an introduction to\nthe book claiming that it \u201ccertainly deserves \u2026 to be\nconsidered an important event in the philosophical world.\u201d It is\nfascinating to note that Wittgenstein thought little of\nRussell\u2019s introduction, claiming that it was riddled with\nmisunderstandings. Later interpretations have attempted to unearth the\nsurprising tensions between the introduction and the rest of the book\n(or between Russell\u2019s reading of Wittgenstein and\nWittgenstein\u2019s own self-assessment)\u2014usually harping on\nRussell\u2019s appropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda.\n\nThe Tractatus\u2019s structure purports to be representative\nof its internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic\npropositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1\u20137, with all\nother paragraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that,\ne.g., paragraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on\nproposition 1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on.\n\nThe seven basic propositions are:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOgden translation\nPears/McGuinness translation \n\n1.\nThe world is everything that is the case.\nThe world is all that is the case. \n\n2.\nWhat is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic\nfacts.\nWhat is the case\u2014a fact\u2014is the existence of states\nof affairs. \n\n3.\nThe logical picture of the facts is the thought.\nA logical picture of facts is a thought. \n\n4.\nThe thought is the significant proposition.\nA thought is a proposition with sense. \n\n5.\nPropositions are truth-functions of elementary\npropositions.\nA proposition is a truth-function of elementary\npropositions. \n\n\u00a0\n(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)\n(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)\n\n\n6.\nThe general form of truth-function is \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi},\nN(\\bar{\\xi})]\\).\nThe general form of a truth-function is \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi},\nN(\\bar{\\xi})]\\). \n\n\u00a0\nThis is the general form of proposition.\nThis is the general form of a proposition. \n\n7.\nWhereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\nWhat we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.\n \n\n\nClearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which\ndeal with the world, thought and language, and presents a\n\u2018solution\u2019 (as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems\nthat is grounded in logic and in the nature of representation. The\nworld is represented by thought, which is a proposition with sense,\nsince they all\u2014world, thought, and proposition\u2014share the\nsame logical form. Hence, the thought and the proposition can be\npictures of the facts.\n\nStarting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as\nconsisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic\nconception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of\naffairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of\nobjects. \u201cObjects are simple\u201d (TLP 2.02) but\nobjects can fit together in various determinate ways. They may have\nvarious properties and may hold diverse relations to one another.\nObjects combine with one another according to their logical, internal\nproperties. That is to say, an object\u2019s internal properties\ndetermine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;\nthis is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of\nobjects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs\nwhich do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of\naffairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality\nof states of affairs\u2014actual and possible\u2014that makes up the\nwhole of reality. The world is precisely those states of affairs which\ndo exist.\n\nThe move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with\nthe use of Wittgenstein\u2019s famous idea that thoughts, and\npropositions, are pictures\u2014\u201cthe picture is a model of\nreality\u201d (TLP 2.12). Pictures are made up of elements\nthat together constitute the picture. Each element represents an\nobject, and the combination of elements in the picture represents the\ncombination of objects in a state of affairs. The logical structure of\nthe picture, whether in thought or in language, is isomorphic with the\nlogical structure of the state of affairs which it pictures. More\nsubtle is Wittgenstein\u2019s insight that the possibility of this\nstructure being shared by the picture (the thought, the proposition)\nand the state of affairs is the pictorial form. \u201cThat\nis how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out to\nit\u201d (TLP 2.1511). This leads to an understanding of\nwhat the picture can picture; but also what it cannot\u2014its own\npictorial form.\n\nWhile \u201cthe logical picture of the facts is the thought\u201d\n(3), in the move to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the\npossibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,\nin the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein\nusing logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.\nExplaining that \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the\ncontext of a proposition has a name meaning\u201d (TLP 3.3),\nhe provides the reader with the two conditions for sensical language.\nFirst, the structure of the proposition must conform to the\nconstraints of logical form, and second, the elements of the\nproposition must have reference (Bedeutung). These conditions\nhave far-reaching implications. The analysis must culminate with a\nname being a primitive symbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic\nitself gives us the structure and limits of what can be said at\nall.\n\n\u201cThe general form of a proposition is: This is how things\nstand\u201d (TLP 4.5) and every proposition is either true\nor false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of\nmore complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional\noperators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the Tractatus, a\nvivid presentation of Frege\u2019s logic in the form of what has\nbecome known as \u2018truth-tables.\u2019 This provides the means to\ngo back and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since\n\u201cevery statement about complexes can be analyzed into a\nstatement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions\nwhich completely describe the complexes\u201d (TLP 2.0201).\nHe delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a\ntruth-function (6). This form, \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\),\nmakes use of one formal operation \\((N(\\bar{\\xi}))\\)and one\npropositional variable \\((\\bar{p})\\) to represent Wittgenstein\u2019s\nclaim that any proposition \u201cis the result of successive\napplications\u201d of logical operations to elementary\npropositions.\n\nHaving developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and relying\non the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can now\nassert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.\nSubsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what\ncan (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving\noutside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,\nand metaphysics.\n2.2 Sense and Nonsense\n\nIn the Tractatus Wittgenstein\u2019s logical construction of\na philosophical system has a purpose\u2014to find the limits of\nworld, thought, and language; in other words, to distinguish between\nsense and nonsense. \u201cThe book will \u2026 draw a limit to\nthinking, or rather\u2014not to thinking, but to the expression of\nthoughts \u2026. The limit can \u2026 only be drawn in language\nand what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply\nnonsense\u201d (TLP Preface). The conditions for a\nproposition\u2019s having sense have been explored and seen to rest\non the possibility of representation or picturing. Names must have a\nbedeutung (reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the\ncontext of a proposition which is held together by logical form. It\nfollows that only factual states of affairs which can be pictured can\nbe represented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be\nsaid are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the\nrealm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used\nin language.\n\nThere are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not\nrepresent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand\nfor objects. \u201cMy fundamental thought is that the logical\nconstants do not represent. That the logic of the facts\ncannot be represented\u201d (TLP 4.0312). This is not a\nhappenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits\nof sense rest on logic. Tautologies and contradictions, the\npropositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and\nthereby the limits of the world. Obviously, then, they do not picture\nanything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s terms, senseless (sinnlos). Propositions\nwhich do have sense are bipolar; they range within the\ntruth-conditions drawn by the truth-tables. But the propositions of\nlogic themselves are \u201cnot pictures of the reality \u2026 for\nthe one allows every possible state of affairs, the other\nnone\u201d (TLP 4.462). Indeed, tautologies (and\ncontradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or false)\n\u201cin the symbol alone \u2026 and this fact contains in itself\nthe whole philosophy of logic\u201d (TLP 6.113).\n\nThe characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the\npropositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form\nitself of the pictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies\nand contradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense.\n\nBeyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies\nanother group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical\n(unsinnig) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to\nsenselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more\nradically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of sense.\nUnder the label of unsinnig can be found various\npropositions: \u201cSocrates is identical,\u201d but also \u201c1\nis a number\u201d and \u201cthere are objects.\u201d While some\nnonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be\nmeaningful\u2014and only analysis carried out in accordance with the\npicture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is\n\u201cin\u201d the world can be described, anything that is\n\u201coutside\u201d is denied meaningfulness, including the notion\nof limit and the limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and\nthe propositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the\nworld as a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the\nvery notion of a subject, for it is also not \u201cin\u201d the\nworld but at its limit.\n\nWittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the\nbounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between\nsaying and showing which is made to do additional\ncrucial work. \u201cWhat can be shown cannot be said,\u201d that is,\nwhat cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only\nbe shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,\nthe pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of\n(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical\npropositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)\npropositions of philosophy belong in this group\u2014which\nWittgenstein finally describes as \u201cthings that cannot be put\ninto words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is\nmystical\u201d (TLP 6.522).\n2.3 The Nature of Philosophy\n\nAccordingly, \u201cthe word \u2018philosophy\u2019 must mean\nsomething which stands above or below, but not beside the natural\nsciences\u201d (TLP 4.111). Not surprisingly, then,\n\u201cmost of the propositions and questions to be found in\nphilosophical works are not false but nonsensical\u201d (TLP\n4.003). Is, then, philosophy doomed to be nonsense\n(unsinnig), or, at best, senseless (sinnlos) when it\ndoes logic, but, in any case, meaningless? What is left for the\nphilosopher to do, if traditional, or even revolutionary, propositions\nof metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, and ethics cannot be\nformulated in a sensical manner? The reply to these two questions is\nfound in Wittgenstein\u2019s characterization of philosophy:\nphilosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an activity. It\nis an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more so, of\ncritique (of language). Described by Wittgenstein, it should be the\nphilosopher\u2019s routine activity: to react or respond to the\ntraditional philosophers\u2019 musings by showing them where they go\nwrong, using the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words,\nby showing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense.\n\n\u201cAll propositions are of equal value\u201d (TLP\n6.4)\u2014that could also be the fundamental thought of the book. For\nit employs a measure of the value of propositions that is done by\nlogic and the notion of limits. It is here, however, with the\nconstraints on the value of propositions, that the tension in the\nTractatus is most strongly felt. It becomes clear that the\nnotions used by the Tractatus\u2014the logical-philosophical\nnotions\u2014do not belong to the world and hence cannot be used to\nexpress anything meaningful. Since language, thought, and the world,\nare all isomorphic, any attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language)\n\u201cthis and this there is in the world, that there is not\u201d\nis doomed to be a failure, since it would mean that logic has got\noutside the limits of the world, i.e. of itself. That is to say, the\nTractatus has gone over its own limits, and stands in danger\nof being nonsensical.\n\nThe \u201csolution\u201d to this tension is found in\nWittgenstein\u2019s final remarks, where he uses the metaphor of the\nladder to express the function of the Tractatus. It is to be\nused in order to climb on it, in order to \u201csee the world\nrightly\u201d; but thereafter it must be recognized as nonsense and\nbe thrown away. Hence: \u201cwhereof one cannot speak, thereof one\nmust be silent\u201d (7).\n2.4 Interpretative Problems\n\nThe Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative\ndifficulties. In the decades that have passed since its publication it\nhas gone through several waves of general interpretations. Beyond\nexegetical and hermeneutical issues that revolve around particular\nsections (such as the world/reality distinction, the difference\nbetween representing and presenting, the Frege/Russell connection to\nWittgenstein, or the influence on Wittgenstein by existentialist\nphilosophy) there are a few fundamental, not unrelated, disagreements\nthat inform the map of interpretation. These revolve around the\nrealism of the Tractatus, the notion of nonsense and its role\nin reading the Tractatus itself, and the reading of the\nTractatus as an ethical tract.\n\nThere are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing\nrealism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,\nstates of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a\nlinguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this\nlinguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is\nseen to start off the Tractatus (\u201cThe world is all that\nis the case\u201d) and to run throughout the text (\u201cObjects\nform the substance of the world\u201d (TLP 2.021)). Such\nrealism is also taken to be manifested in the essential bi-polarity of\npropositions; likewise, a straightforward reading of the picturing\nrelation posits objects there to be represented by signs. As against\nthese readings, more linguistically oriented interpretations give\nconceptual priority to the symbolism. When \u201creality is compared\nwith propositions\u201d (TLP 4.05), it is the form of\npropositions which determines the shape of reality (and not the other\nway round). In any case, the issue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in\nthe Tractatus must address the question of the limits of\nlanguage and the more particular question of what there is (or is not)\nbeyond language. Subsequently, interpreters of the Tractatus\nhave moved on to questioning the very presence of metaphysics within\nthe book and the status of the propositions of the book\nthemselves.\n\n\u2018Nonsense\u2019 became the hinge of Wittgensteinian\ninterpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.\nBeyond the bounds of language lies nonsense\u2014propositions which\ncannot picture anything\u2014and Wittgenstein bans\ntraditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning\nthe question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since\nWittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to\nbe shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the\n\u2018mystical.\u2019 The traditional readings of the\nTractatus accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the\nexistence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into\nwords, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense\nmore seriously as exactly that\u2014nonsense. This also entails\ntaking seriously Wittgenstein\u2019s words in 6.54\u2014his famous\nladder metaphor\u2014and throwing out the Tractatus itself,\nincluding the distinction between what can be said and what can only\nbe shown. The Tractatus, on this stance, does not point at\nineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),\nbut should lead us away from such temptations. An accompanying\ndiscussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what\nthis can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all.\n\nThis discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the\nethical reading of the Tractatus. Such a reading is based,\nfirst, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein\u2019s\nconstruction of a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of\nthe Tractatus, and several comments that are made about this\nconstruction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and\nin a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before\npublication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external\nto the content of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein preaches\nsilence as regards anything that is of importance, including the\n\u2018internal\u2019 parts of the book which contain, in his own\nwords, \u201cthe final solution of the problems [of\nphilosophy].\u201d It is the importance given to the ineffable that\ncan be viewed as an ethical position. \u201cMy work consists of two\nparts, the one presented here plus all that I have not\nwritten. And it is precisely this second part that is the important\npoint. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it\nwere, by my book; \u2026 I\u2019ve managed in my book to put\neverything firmly into place by being silent about it \u2026. For\nnow I would recommend you to read the preface and the\nconclusion, because they contain the most direct expression\nof the point\u201d (ProtoTractatus, p.16). Obviously, such\nseemingly contradictory tensions within and about a text\u2014written\nby its author\u2014give rise to interpretative conundrums.\n\nThere is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,\nwhich arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the\ncontinuity between the thought of the early and later Wittgenstein.\nAgain, the \u2018standard\u2019 interpretations were originally\nunited in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct stages of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought, even when ascertaining some\ndevelopmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent\ninterpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the\nfundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later\nWittgenstein should also be attributed to the early.\n3. The Later Wittgenstein\n3.1 Transition and Critique of Tractatus\n\nThe idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be\napproached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the\nTractatus. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to\nhis own early work as \u2018dogmatic\u2019 (\u201cOn\nDogmatism\u201d in VC, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term\nto designate any conception which allows for a gap between question\nand answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a\nlater date. The complex edifice of the Tractatus is built on\nthe assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the\nelementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the\ntransition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the\ntotal rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of\nall the consequences of this rejection. The move from the\nrealm of logic to that of the grammar of ordinary language as the\ncenter of the philosopher\u2019s attention; from an emphasis on\ndefinition and analysis to \u2018family resemblance\u2019 and\n\u2018language-games\u2019; and from systematic philosophical\nwriting to an aphoristic style\u2014all have to do with this\ntransition towards anti-dogmatism in its extreme. It is in the\nPhilosophical Investigations that the working out of the\ntransitions comes to culmination. Other writings of the same period,\nthough, manifest the same anti-dogmatic stance, as it is applied,\ne.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to philosophical\npsychology.\n3.2 Philosophical Investigations\n\nPhilosophical Investigations was published posthumously in\n1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated\nby Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693\nnumbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded\nfrom the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the\neditors, trustees of his Nachlass. In 2009 a new edited\ntranslation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;\nPart II of the earlier translation, now recognized as an essentially\nseparate entity, was here labeled \u201cPhilosophy of Psychology\n\u2013 A Fragment\u201d (PPF).\n\nIn the Preface to PI, Wittgenstein states that his new\nthoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the\nbackground of his old thoughts, those in the Tractatus; and\nindeed, most of Part I of PI is essentially questioning. Its\nnew insights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the\ntraditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,\nintentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is\nconceived of as a therapeutic work, viewing philosophy itself\nas therapy. (Part II (PPF), focusing on\nphilosophical psychology, perception etc., was different, pointing to\nnew perspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the\nearlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues. It is,\ntherefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein\u2019s other\nwritings of the later period.)\n\nPI begins with a quote from Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions which \u201cgive us a particular picture of the\nessence of human language,\u201d based on the idea that \u201cthe\nwords in language name objects,\u201d and that \u201csentences are\ncombinations of such names\u201d (PI 1). This picture of\nlanguage cannot be relied on as a basis for metaphysical, epistemic or\nlinguistic speculation. Despite its plausibility, this reduction of\nlanguage to representation cannot do justice to the whole of human\nlanguage; and even if it is to be considered a picture of only the\nrepresentative function of human language, it is, as such, a poor\npicture. Furthermore, this picture of language is at the base of the\nwhole of traditional philosophy, but, for Wittgenstein, it is to be\nshunned in favor of a new way of looking at both language and\nphilosophy. The Philosophical Investigations proceeds to\noffer the new way of looking at language, which will yield the view of\nphilosophy as therapy.\n3.3 Meaning as Use\n\n\u201cFor a large class of cases of the employment of the\nword \u2018meaning\u2019\u2014though not for all\u2014this word\ncan be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the\nlanguage\u201d (PI 43). This basic statement is what\nunderlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as\nrepresentation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the\ninvestigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of\nphilosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the\nproposition which endows it with sense. This \u2018something\u2019\ncould generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the\nmind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (The Blue\nBook) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,\narriving at the insight that \u201cif we had to name anything which\nis the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its\nuse\u201d (BB 4). Ascertainment of the use (of a\nword, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of\nconstructive theory building, as in the Tractatus. Rather,\nwhen investigating meaning, the philosopher must \u201clook and\nsee\u201d the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy\nwith tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools\nin a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the\n\u201cfunctions of words are as diverse as the functions of these\nobjects\u201d (PI 11). We are misled by the uniform\nappearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:\n\u201cEspecially when we are doing philosophy!\u201d (PI\n12)\n\nSo different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think, but look!\u201d (PI 66); and such\nlooking is done vis a vis particular cases, not\ngeneralizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory\ngeneralization should be replaced by a description of use. The\ntraditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a\nrestricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question, and\ncommand), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order\nto address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and\ntheir being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key\nconcept of \u2018language-game.\u2019 He never explicitly defines it\nsince, as opposed to the earlier \u2018picture,\u2019 for instance,\nthis new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more\ndiversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language.\nHence, indeed, the requirement to define harkens back to an old dogma,\nwhich misses the playful and active character of language.\n3.4 Language-games and Family Resemblance\n\nThroughout the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein\nreturns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make\nclear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive\nlanguage-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or\nthat characteristic of language. Thus, the builders\u2019\nlanguage-game (PI 2), in which a builder and his assistant\nuse exactly four terms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to\nillustrate that part of the Augustinian picture of language which\nmight be correct but which is, nevertheless, strictly limited because\nit ignores the essential role of action in establishing meaning.\n\u2018Regular\u2019 language-games, such as the astonishing list\nprovided in PI 23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event,\nspeculating about an event, forming and testing a hypothesis, making\nup a story, reading it, play-acting, singing catches, guessing\nriddles, making a joke, translating, asking, thanking, and so on),\nbring out the openness of our possibilities in using language and in\ndescribing it.\n\nLanguage-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by\nWittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of\nlanguage-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This\ndoes not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and\nevery language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this\nsort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,\nessential definition of \u2018game,\u2019 so we cannot find\n\u201cwhat is common to all these activities and what makes them into\nlanguage or parts of language\u201d (PI 65).\n\nIt is here that Wittgenstein\u2019s rejection of general\nexplanations, and definitions based on sufficient and necessary\nconditions, is best pronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the\nphilosopher\u2019s \u201ccraving for generality,\u201d he points to\n\u2018family resemblance\u2019 as the more suitable analogy for the\nmeans of connecting particular uses of the same word. There is no\nreason to look, as we have done traditionally\u2014and\ndogmatically\u2014for one, essential core in which the meaning of a\nword is located and which is, therefore, common to all uses of that\nword. We should, instead, travel with the word\u2019s uses through\n\u201ca complicated network of similarities overlapping and\ncriss-crossing\u201d (PI 66). Family resemblance also serves\nto exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from exactness that\ncharacterize different uses of the same concept. Such boundaries and\nexactness are the definitive traits of form\u2014be it Platonic form,\nAristotelian form, or the general form of a proposition adumbrated in\nthe Tractatus. It is from such forms that applications of\nconcepts can be deduced, but this is precisely what Wittgenstein now\neschews in favor of appeal to similarity of a kind with family\nresemblance.\n3.5 Rule-following and Private Language\n\nOne of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that\nof rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes\nanother central point of discussion in the question of what it is that\ncan apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as\nbefore has it that a rule is an abstract entity\u2014transcending all\nof its particular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping\nthat abstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it.\n\nWittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:\n\u201c\u2026 we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say \u2018+\n2\u2019) beyond 1000\u2014and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008,\n1012\u201d (PI 185). What do we do, and what does it mean,\nwhen the student, upon being corrected, answers \u201cBut I did go on\nin the same way\u201d? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in PI\n185\u2013243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of\nattendant questions: How do we learn rules? How do we follow them?\nWherefrom the standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?\nAre they in the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?\nDo we appeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and\npublicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the\nanswers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of\nthe questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to\nthe test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic\npictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and\nWittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such\nliberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of\nexternal or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the\nrule.\n\nThese considerations lead to PI 201, often considered the\nclimax of the issue: \u201cThis was our paradox: no course of action\ncould be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be\nmade out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to\nconflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict\nhere.\u201d Wittgenstein\u2019s formulation of the problem, now at\nthe point of being a \u201cparadox,\u201d has given rise to a wealth\nof interpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the\ncrux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a\nlanguage. One of the influential readings of the problem of following\na rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the\ninterpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a\nskeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,\nthere are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no\nreal grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and\nWittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other\nconditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following\na rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several\ninterpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell\n1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives\n(e.g., Diamond, \u201cRules: Looking in the Right Place\u201d in\nPhillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002).\n\nDirectly following the rule-following sections in PI, and\ntherefore easily thought to be the upshot of the discussion, are those\nsections called by interpreters \u201cthe private-language\nargument.\u201d Whether it be a veritable argument or not (and\nWittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections point out that\nfor an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible in principle to\nsubject it to public standards and criteria of correctness. For this\nreason, a private-language, in which \u201cwords \u2026 are to\nrefer to what only the speaker can know\u2014to his immediate private\nsensations \u2026\u201d (PI 243), is not a genuine,\nmeaningful, rule-governed language. The signs in language can only\nfunction when there is a possibility of judging the correctness of\ntheir use, \u201cso the use of [a] word stands in need of a\njustification which everybody understands\u201d (PI\n261).\n3.6 Grammar and Form of Life\n\nGrammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic\nand semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein\u2019s hands, the\nwider\u2014and more elusive\u2014notion which captures the essence\nof language as a special rule-governed activity. This notion replaces\nthe stricter and purer logic, which played such an essential role in\nthe Tractatus in providing a scaffolding for language and the\nworld. Indeed, \u201cEssence is expressed in grammar\n\u2026 Grammar tells what kind of object anything is. (Theology as\ngrammar)\u201d (PI 371, 373). As opposed to grammar-book\nrules, the \u201crules\u201d of grammar are not technical\ninstructions from on-high for correct usage and are not idealized as\nan external system to be conformed to, independently of context.\nTherefore, they are not appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but\nare only used in cases of philosophical perplexity to clarify where\nlanguage misleads us into false illusions. Thus, for example, \u201cI\ncan know what someone else is thinking, not what I am thinking. It is\ncorrect to say \u2018I know what you are thinking,\u2019 and wrong\nto say \u2018I know what I am thinking.\u2019 (A whole cloud of\nphilosophy condensed into a drop of grammar.)\u201d\n(Philosophical Investigations 1953, p.222). In this example,\nbeing sensitive to the grammatical uniqueness of first-person avowals\nsaves us from the blunders of foundational epistemology.\n\nGrammar is hence situated within the regular activity with which\nlanguage-games are interwoven: \u201c\u2026 the word\n\u2018language-game\u2019 is used here to emphasize the\nfact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or\nof a form of life\u201d (PI 23). What enables language to\nfunction and therefore must be accepted as \u201cgiven\u201d are\nprecisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein\u2019s terms, \u201cIt is\nnot only agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in\njudgments that is required\u201d (PI 242), and this is\n\u201cagreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life\u201d\n(PI 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly\u2014five times in\nthe Investigations\u2014this concept has given rise to\ninterpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms\nof life can be understood as constantly changing and contingent,\ndependent on culture, context, history, etc.; or as a background\ncommon to humankind, \u201cshared human behavior\u201d which is\n\u201cthe system of reference by means of which we interpret an\nunknown language\u201d (PI 206); or as a notion which can be\nread differently in different cases \u2013 sometimes as relativistic,\nin other cases as expressing a more universalistic approach.\n3.7 The Nature of Philosophy\n\nIn his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in the\nTractatus, that philosophers do not\u2014or should\nnot\u2014supply a theory, neither do they provide explanations.\n\u201cPhilosophy just puts everything before us, and neither explains\nnor deduces anything.\u2014Since everything lies open to view there\nis nothing to explain\u201d (PI 126). The anti-theoretical\nstance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but there are\nmanifest differences. Although the Tractatus precludes\nphilosophical theories, it does construct a systematic edifice which\nresults in the general form of the proposition, all the while relying\non strict formal logic; the Investigations points out the\ntherapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily instructing\nphilosophers in the ways of therapy. \u201cThe work of the\nphilosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular\npurpose\u201d (PI 127). Working with reminders and series of\nexamples, different problems are solved. Unlike the Tractatus\nwhich advanced one philosophical method, in the\nInvestigations \u201cthere is not a single philosophical\nmethod, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it\nwere\u201d (PI 133d). This is directly related to\nWittgenstein\u2019s eschewal of the logical form or of any\na-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in philosophy.\nTrying to advance such general theses is a temptation which lures\nphilosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to make us aware\nof the temptation and to show us how to overcome it. Consequently\n\u201ca philosophical problem has the form: \u2018I don\u2019t know\nmy way about.\u2019\u201d (PI 123), and hence the aim of\nphilosophy is \u201cto show the fly the way out of the\nfly-bottle\u201d (PI 309).\n\nThe refusal of theory goes hand in hand with Wittgenstein\u2019s\nobjection to have \u201canything hypothetical in our [philosophical]\nconsiderations\u201d (PI 109): \u201cAll\nexplanation must disappear, and description alone must take\nits place.\u201d In The Blue Book, Wittgenstein explained\nthe difficulty encountered by philosophers to work on a minor scale\nand to take seriously \u201cthe particular case\u201d as originating\nfrom their \u201ccraving for generality.\u201d This craving is\nstrongly influenced by philosophers\u2019 \u201cpreoccupation with\nthe method of science,\u201d a reductive and unifying tendency which\nis \u201cthe real source of metaphysics\u201d (BB 18).\nWittgenstein\u2019s determined anti-scientism should not be read as\nan opposition to science in itself; it is the insistence that\nphilosophy and science are to be kept apart \u2013 that (contrary to\nthe prevalent attitude of modern civilization) the scientific\nframework is not appropriate everywhere, and certainly not for\nphilosophical investigations.\n\nThe style of the Investigations is strikingly different from\nthat of the Tractatus. Instead of strictly numbered sections\nwhich are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the\nInvestigations fragmentarily voices aphorisms about\nlanguage-games, family resemblance, forms of life, \u201csometimes\njumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another\u201d\n(PI Preface). This variation in style is of course essential\nand is \u201cconnected with the very nature of the\ninvestigation\u201d (PI Preface). As a matter of fact,\nWittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages\nof his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order\nto make the contrast obvious and clear.\n\nStill, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy\nthat the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than\nthe discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy\nserves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing\nlanguage\u2019s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the\ntraps of meaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what\nwas formerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve\n\u201cand this simply means that the philosophical problems should\ncompletely disappear\u201d (PI 133). Two\nimplications of this diagnosis, easily traced back in the\nTractatus, are to be recognized. One is the inherent\ndialogical character of philosophy, which is a responsive activity:\ndifficulties and torments are encountered which are then to be\ndissipated by philosophical therapy. In the Tractatus, this\ntook the shape of advice: \u201cThe correct method in philosophy\nwould really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said,\ni.e. propositions of natural science \u2026 and then whenever\nsomeone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to\nhim that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his\npropositions\u201d (TLP 6.53) The second, more far-\nreaching, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the Investigations\n\u201cis the one that enables me to break off philosophizing when I\nwant to\u201d (PI 133). This has been taken to revert back\nto the ladder metaphor and the injunction to silence in the\nTractatus.\n3.8 Interpretative Problems\n\nWhereas the Tractatus has been interpreted in different ways\nright from its publication, for about two decades since the\npublication of Philosophical Investigations in 1953 there\nseemed to be wide agreement on the proper way to read the book (along\nwith the vast material from 1930 onwards in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nNachlass, gradually released over the years).\nWittgenstein\u2019s turn from his early emphasis on the role of\nlogical analysis in his philosophical method to the later preference\nof particular grammatical descriptions was read, quite unanimously, as\nmarking the two clearly distinct \u2013 \u201cearly\u201d and\n\u201clater\u201d \u2013 phases in his thought. The later phase, it\nwas agreed, consisted mainly of particular descriptions of our\nordinary uses of words \u2013 especially those words which tend to\ncreate the illusion that they represent something profound, words\nwhich seem to point at the \u201cessence of language.\u201d\n\u201cWhereas, in fact, if the words \u2018language,\u2019\n\u2018experience,\u2019 \u2018world\u2019 have a use, it must be\nas humble a one as that of the words \u2018table,\u2019\n\u2018lamp,\u2019 \u2018door\u2019.\u201d (PI 97)\n\nWith the publication of Stanley Cavell\u2019s Must We Mean What\nWe Say? (1969) and especially The Claim of Reason:\nWittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy (1979), it turned\nout that such notions as \u2018description,\u2019\n\u2018ordinary,\u2019 and \u2018usage\u2019 are not as innocuous\nas they had seemed. Cavell\u2019s reading of Philosophical\nInvestigations suggested a more radical emphasis on the\nparticularity of contexts and blocked the way to any general\ndescription of \u201cgrammatical rules.\u201d For Cavell,\nWittgenstein\u2019s idea that meanings are determined only\nwithin language games, i.e., only in particular cases, is the\nkey to reading his philosophy. When ignored, we are bound to import an\noutside requirement into our investigation and thus, favoring a\ndistilled and rigid account of our linguistic exchanges, miss (and\nmisrepresent) their vividness: \u201cAs if the meaning were an aura\nthe word brings along with it and retains in every kind of use\u201d\n(PI 117).\n\nIn 1980, Oxford philosophers G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker launched the\nfirst volume of an analytical commentary on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nInvestigations. This gigantic project, spanning over 4\nvolumes (the 3rd and 4th written by Hacker\nalone), advocated and developed the orthodox reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work, according to which a systematic\nmapping \u2013 an overview, or \u00dcbersicht (Cf.\nPI 122) \u2013 of the use of our words is not only possible\nbut also necessary, if we wish to dissolve the philosophical problems\narising from the traditional philosophical inattention to ordinary\nuse, due to a prior metaphysical requirement. For Baker and Hacker, a\nkey notion for reading Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy is that\nof philosophical \u2018grammar.\u2019 Acute attention to grammatical\nrules of use offers a way to elucidate meanings and thus to expose\nphilosophical blunders.\n\nGradually, these alternatives in reading Philosophical\nInvestigations came to form two schools of interpretation that\nare broadly parallel to the ones we encounter regarding\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus. As noted above (in section\n2.4), there is, first, the question of the continuity between\nWittgenstein\u2019s earlier and later writings. When emphasis is\ngiven \u2013 as in the orthodox reading \u2013 to\nWittgenstein\u2019s switch from logic to grammar, the break between\nthe philosophical stages is easily marked. When, on the contrary, it\nis the resistance to generalization (of any kind) that is emphasized,\nthen the similarity in Wittgenstein\u2019s therapeutic motivation\nthroughout his life is much more clearly seen.\n\nAs in the previous stage, the debate here has to do with the question\nof ethics and its centrality in reading Wittgenstein\u2019s oeuvre.\nAccording to the traditional approach, amplified in Hacker and\nBaker\u2019s interpretive project, Wittgenstein\u2019s main\nobjective is to resolve or dissolve general philosophical puzzles\n\u2013 concerning, e.g., the mind, the nature of color, perception,\nand rule-following \u2013 by clarifying, arranging, and contrasting\ndifferent grammatical rules relevant to the notion examined. This is\nan intellectual investigation and, apart from its being critical of\ntraditional philosophy and its reflection in contemporary science, it\nhas nothing particularly relevant to ethics and should not be read as\nan ethical endeavor. Readers taking their cue from Cavell, on the\nother hand, believe that the gist of the Wittgensteinian effort in\ntoto is ethical, cultural, or even political. They point at the\nInvestigations\u2019 motto (\u201cThe trouble about\nprogress is that it always looks much greater than it really is\u201d\n\u2013 Nestroy) and Wittgenstein\u2019s mention of \u201cthe\ndarkness of this time\u201d in the book\u2019s Preface; but more\nsubstantially, they argue that Wittgenstein\u2019s insistence on the\nordinary, the practice of every-day living, is ethical through and\nthrough. Our lives are saturated by ethics; we are members of a\nhistorically and culturally conditioned society; and our linguistic\npractices cannot but have an important ethical aspect. Ignoring this\naspect, according to these interpreters, entails a rejection of what\nis human in our linguistic exchanges.\n\nTo be sure, the interpretations\u2019 map is much more complicated\nthan what is briefly sketched here. There are philosophers who object\nto the characterization each side in the above debate attaches to the\nother. There are those who claim that while there is a genuine dispute\nabout the right interpretation of the Tractatus, the various\ninterpreters of Philosophical Investigations are much closer\nto one another than they are ready to acknowledge; and there are\nindependent readings of Wittgenstein which draw their clues from both\nsides and attempt a different path altogether.\n4. The Middle Wittgenstein\n\nIt is noteworthy that the conventional conceptualization of two\nWittgensteins, originally thought to be clearly demarcated between the\nearly and later Wittgensteins, has been repeatedly re-worked in the\nensuing interpretative project of understanding the\nphilosopher\u2019s writings, thoughts, and ideas, with no show of\nsubsiding. One of the natural outcomes of such intense investigation\nis the awareness that, indeed, understanding Wittgenstein means\nrecognizing other times and other developments, such as before the\nearly Wittgenstein (of the Tractatus), between the early\nWittgenstein and the later Wittgenstein (of Philosophical\nInvestigations), and following that later Wittgenstein.\n\nThe middle Wittgenstein, he of the period between the early\nWittgenstein and the later Wittgenstein, was, early on, identified as\nworthy of exposure and more interpretative work, but such a venture\nwas clearly a function of two mutually impactful grand questions: What\nis the relationship between the early and later Wittgenstein (as\nadumbrated in 2.4 and 3.8) and, following upon answers to that\nquestion, what is then the more exact time-frame that is worthy of the\nindependent label \u201cmiddle\u201d? Thus, there is presently much\nmore work being done on the middle Wittgenstein as the questions of\nthe relationship between the early and the later Wittgenstein have\ntaken center-stage and become a constant in Wittgenstein\nscholarship.\n\nHow, then, to best demarcate the middle Wittgenstein? The wide date\nrecognition, all along from 1929 (or even earlier) to 1944 (the time\nwhen Wittgenstein began the final revision of PI) might seem\ntoo obvious, though it can house readings of the\ncontinuity-between-early-and-later-Wittgenstein school persuasively.\nSuch is work by, for instance, Joachim Schulte (1992), who notes a\nmiddle Wittgenstein already in the TLP leading all the way to\nlater Wittgenstein\u2019s key treatments of grammar or mathematics.\nThe opposite extreme, of pinpointing one point in time as expressing a\nsole significant transformation, seems too summary. This strategy is\nadopted, for example, by the Hintikkas (1986b) regarding the year 1929\nor by Kienzler (1997) concerning a transitional break in 1931. Then\nthere are the various more moderate determinations, which adopt a\ntime-span of a few years, usually sometime between 1929 and 1935,\nexplaining their delineations by philosophical interpretations of the\ntexts and contexts of those times. Such are: O. K. Bouwsma (1961), who\npoints to the period of the Blue and Brown Books (1933\u201335);\nP. M. S. Hacker (1986), who follows a two year period \u2013\n1929\u20131930 \u2013 as the middle Wittgenstein \u201cbridge\u201d;\nAlois Pichler (2004), who recognizes a middle Wittgenstein in\n1930\u20131935 based on Wittgensteinian styles; or David Stern (1991), who\nbriefly gives the demarcation of \u201cthe late 1920s and early\n1930s.\u201d\n\nIf we adopt that last marker of dates, the late 1920s to the early (or\nmid-)1930s, we can address, in general, the objects of interpretation\nthat have provided the basis for a middle Wittgenstein. Although\neverything in the Nachlass is now digitally available to the\naspiring interpreter, the published versions of\ntypescripts/manuscripts of talks and notes (sometimes dictated to\nstudents) have been the evidence upon which middle Wittgenstein\ninterpretation has flourished. These are (in chronological order of\ntheir occurrence, not their publication) \u201cSome Remarks on\nLogical Form\u201d (1929), \u201cA Lecture on Ethics\u201d (1929),\nPhilosophical Remarks (1929\u20131930), Philosophical\nGrammar (1932\u201333), The Big Typescript\n(1932\u20131933); the Blue and Brown Books\n(1933\u20131935), and \u201cNotes for Lectures on \u2018Private\nExperience\u2019 and \u2018Sense Data\u2019\u201d\n(1935\u201336). Just as illuminating, even tantalizing, are the\npublications of notes taken by participants in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nclasses in those philosophically eventful years, since it was in those\nsurroundings that Wittgenstein was working out \u2013 live \u2013\nthe deliberations and moves into what would become the later\nWittgenstein. Supplied by Alice Ambrose, Desmond Lee, G. E. Moore,\nRush Rhees, and Friedrich Waismann (on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nconversations with members of the Vienna Circle), these are volumes\nreplete with questions of philosophy, meta-philosophy, method, and\nstyle that provide the Wittgensteinian interpreter with voluminous raw\ndata in order to characterize a middle Wittgenstein.\n\nThe themes that populate the texts above are wide and varied. Some\nharken back to Tractarian refrains, more appear to introduce later\nWittgensteinian terms; a number of subjects make transitory\nappearances, never to return. Phenomenology, for one, is a constant\nWittgensteinian concern, mostly for interpreters of all Wittgensteins\nwho bicker over the very ascription of phenomenology to\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought, accompanied by their attempt to define\nWittgenstein\u2019s use of the term. But it is in the middle\nWittgenstein that phenomenology makes a literal appearance,\nspecifically in the \u201cPhenomenology is Grammar\u201d chapter of\nThe Big Typescript. The questions then become whether\nphenomenology can be ascribed to the early Wittgenstein, whether it\nwas really only adopted in the later Wittgenstein, and most relevant\nhere \u2013 whether it can be identified as either vacating the scene\nin the middle Wittgenstein or, contrarily, there becoming\nterminologically and therefore significantly present. There is also\nthe option that phenomenology appears exclusively in the middle\nWittgenstein. These last options may then be seen as (at least partly)\ndefinitive of a middle period.\n\nMathematics, and Wittgenstein\u2019s original thoughts on it, can\nundoubtedly be seen as another investigative anchor of middle\nWittgenstein. Although it is clear that mathematics was of great\ninterest to him in TLP, his thoughts on it became more\nenigmatic precisely in the middle period. Several \u201cisms\u201d\nare attributed to his view(s) on mathematics here \u2013\nverificationism, formalism, and finitism, along with recognition of a\n\u201ccalculus conception\u201d of mathematics. (Intuitionism, a\nfavorite label for interpreters of Wittgenstein\u2019s mathematics,\nis only identified in the Remarks on the Foundations of\nMathematics (1937\u20131944) and after, i.e., in the later\nWittgenstein.) It appears, however, that middle Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndealings with mathematics in this period are, as claimed by Juliet\nFloyd (2005), constantly changing \u2013 and even that, not in any\nconsistent developmental way but in \u201cpiecemeal and uneven\u201d\nfashion. Indeed, along with written evidence of Wittgenstein's\ninfluence on and by mathematicians, we can identify the work on\nmathematics done particularly by the later Wittgenstein and even he of\nthe post-Investigations period, as a substantial overturning\nof his early and middle conceptions of mathematics.\n\nWhile phenomenology and mathematics stand out as almost quirky (and\nperhaps suspiciously unclear) subjects making their idiosyncratic\nappearance in the middle Wittgenstein, the more evident\nWittgensteinian constructs of this period are, of course, logic,\nlanguage, and method. Unsurprisingly, \u201cSome Remarks on Logical\nForm\u201d in 1929 heralds the transition from early to later\nWittgenstein, moving from (ideal, formal) logic to (the rules of use\nof) grammar. Language is also viewed as the connecting factor between\nthe early and later Wittgenstein, either by discovering still\n\u201crepresentational\u201d aspects in descriptions of its use or\nby deciphering roots of the private language arguments in this\nWittgenstein\u2019s musings. Other times, analysis of linguistic\nphenomena as language games rather than tools of logic provides what\nwe have always acknowledged as paradigmatic transitions from early to\nlater Wittgenstein. These all involve methodology \u2013 Wittgenstein\nespousing a method of doing philosophy that is different from that of\nTLP, but still not the plurality of methods proposed in\nPI. Furthermore, the method proposed is the turn to grammar\nas a back turning on dogmatism (and/of metaphysics). David Stern calls\nthe early Wittgenstein\u2019s views on logic, language, and method\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d and the later Wittgenstein\u2019s\n\u201cpractical holism,\u201d tagging the middle Wittgenstein as\n\u201clogical holism.\u201d Between logical atomism and practical\nholism seems to lie a drastic divide, but seeing logical holism as\nbridging the divide gives us the perception \u2013 and understanding\n\u2013 of a natural development between them. As spelled out by Mauro\nEngelmann (2013), this development can then also encompass all the\nabove elements in a comprehensive transition gesturing towards an\n\u201canthropological\u201d view.\n5. After the Investigations\n\nIt has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until\nhis death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought. These writings include, in addition to\nthe second part of the first edition of the Philosophical\nInvestigations (PPF), texts edited and collected in volumes such\nas Remarks on Colour, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, Zettel, On Certainty, and parts of\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics.\n\nPart II of the Philosophical Investigations was, in fact, an\nitem of contention ab initio. In Anscombe and Rhees\u2019s\nfirst edition of 1953 (translated by Anscombe), reasons were given for\nincluding it, admittedly as a differentiated part, in the book. In\nHacker and Schulte\u2019s (translated and edited) fourth edition of\n2009, its position was contrarily explained. It now became, instead of\nPart II, an almost independent entity \u2013 Philosophy of\nPsychology \u2013 A Fragment (PPF). It is also emphasized that\nit was a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Be that as it may, that\ninstallment of a post-Philosophical Investigations text\nexhibits all the vagaries of Wittgensteinian interpretation \u2013\nbehooving philosophers to attend to questions of placement (which\nWittgenstein is here represented, middle, later, or other?), affinity\n(how do these comments relate to Wittgenstein\u2019s later work in\ngeneral?), and topic (what is Wittgenstein dealing with here,\npsychology, epistemology, or the method of philosophy?).\n\nPPF is the locus classicus of a key Wittgensteinian term\n\u2013 \u201cseeing aspects\u201d (PPF xi), where\n\u201ctwo uses of the word \u2018see\u2019\u201d are elaborated.\nThe second use, where one \u201csees\u201d a likeness in two\nobjects, is the one that has given rise to the question of aspect\nperception and the attendant phenomena of aspect-dawning and change of\naspect. \u201cI observe a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness\nto another. I see that it has not changed; and yet I see it\ndifferently. I call this experience \u2018noticing an\naspect\u2019\u201d (113). Aspect seeing involves noticing something\nabout an object \u2013 an aspect of the object \u2013 that one\nhadn\u2019t noticed before and thereby seeing it as something\ndifferent. Importantly, it also arises as a result of a change of\ncontext of our perceptions. This immensely insightful discovery by\nWittgenstein, and its successive development, has been the source of a\nmultitude of discussions dealing with questions of objectivity vs.\nsubjectivity, conception vs. perception, and psychology vs.\nepistemology. It also highlights the move from dogmatic, formalistic\nuniversalism to open, humanistic context-laden behavior, aptly\nreverberating in the to-and-fro of seeing aspects.\n\nOn Certainty is generally accepted as a work of epistemology, as\nopposed to PPF, which is usually recognized as dealing with\npsychology (though even that distinction is called into question by\nsome interpretations). It tackles skeptical doubts and foundational\nsolutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a work of\ntherapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. As always\nbefore in the interpretative game, the general view sees Wittgenstein\nas landing on the non-skeptical side of the epistemological debate,\nchoosing instead to peruse \u201chinge propositions.\u201d These are\npropositions about which doubt cannot be entertained, but whether this\nbe due to their being epistemically foundational, naturally certain,\nor logically unavailable to doubt is still a matter for philosophical\nexplanation; as is the question of Wittgenstein\u2019s object of\ncritique \u2013 Cartesian or radical skepticism \u2013 or, in some\nquarters, the very assumption of his unequivocal anti-skepticism. This\nis intimately related to another of On Certainty\u2019s\nthemes\u2014the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s PI terminology, of form of life to\nlogos. Such a clearly delineated philosophical phase has garnered the\nrecognition of a \u201cthird Wittgenstein\u201d (initially by\nDani\u00e8le Moyal-Sharrock).\n\nRemarks on Colour is a collection of remarks, composed by\nWittgenstein during the last year and a half of his life. In these\nremarks he attempts to clarify the language we use in describing our\nexperience and impression of colours, sameness of colours, saturated\ncolours, light and shade, brightness and opaqueness of surfaces,\ntransparency, etc. These reflections present us with a \u201cgeometry\nof colours,\u201d though Wittgenstein makes it clear that due to\n\u201cthe indefiniteness in the concept of colour\u201d (III-78) the\n\u201clogic of colour concepts\u201d (I-22) should be given\npiecemeal. When we consider colours \u201cthere is merely an\ninability to bring the concepts into some kind of order\u201d\n(II-20). Philosophical attention should be given rather to such\nparticularities as the blending in of white (as opposed to blending in\nyellow), \u201cthe coloured intermediary between two colours\u201d\n(III-49), \u201c the difference between black-red-gold and\nblack-red-yellow\u201d (III-51), etc. The investigation is therefore\ndirected not merely to colour phenomena and the language we use to\ndescribe them but also to philosophical methodology, in comparison\nwith scientific inquiry, and to what is taken to be conceivable and\nwhat is not. It is also unique in reminding us of a hint, by\nWittgenstein, that it was prompted by Johann Wolfgang von\nGoethe\u2019s Zur Farbenlehre (On the Theory of\nColour, 1810)!\n\nThe general tenor of all the writings of this last period can thence\nbe viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical (some\nwould say destructive) positions of the Investigations to a\nmore positive perspective on the same problems that had been facing\nhim since his early writings; on the other hand, this move does not\nnecessarily bespeak a break from the later period but might be more\nproperly viewed as its continuation, in a new light. In other words,\nthe grand question of interpreting Wittgenstein, i.e., the question of\ncontinuities or breaks, remains at the forefront of understanding\nWittgenstein.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Wittgenstein\u2019s Works", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Wittgenstein\u2019s Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>The Big Typescript: TS 213, German English Scholars\u2019\nEdition</em>, 2005, C.
