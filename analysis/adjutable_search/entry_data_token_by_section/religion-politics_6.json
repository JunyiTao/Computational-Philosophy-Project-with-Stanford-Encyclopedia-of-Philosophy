    "main_text": "Liberal Critics of the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n4. Liberal Critics of the Doctrine of Religious Restraint\n\n\nIn the last section, we considered three arguments for the DRR and\nresponses to them offered by the liberal critics. In the course of our\ndiscussion, we began to see elements of the view that liberal critics\nof the standard view\u2014critics such as Christopher Eberle, Philip\nQuinn, Jeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff\u2014endorse. To get\na better feel for why these theorists reject the\nDRR, it will be helpful to step back for a moment to consider some\nimportant features of their view.\n\n\n Earlier we indicated that liberal critics\nof the standard view offer detailed replies to both the Argument from\nReligious Warfare and the Argument from Divisiveness. Still,\nfriends of the standard view may worry that there is something deeply\nproblematic about these replies. For by allowing citizens to\nsupport coercive laws on purely religious grounds, they permit\nmajorities to impose their religious views on others and restrict the\nliberties of their fellow citizens. But it is important to see\nthat no liberal critic of the standard position adopts an \u201canything\ngoes\u201d policy toward the justification of state coercion.\nCitizens, according to these thinkers, should adhere to several\nconstraints on the manner in which they support coercive laws,\nincluding the following.\n\n\n First, liberal critics of the\nstandard view assume that citizens should support basic liberal\ncommitments such as the rights to religious freedom, equality before\nthe law, and private property. Michael Perry argues, for example,\n\u201cthat the foundational moral commitment of liberal democracy is to the\ntrue and full humanity of every person\u2014and therefore,\nto the inviolability of every person\u2014without regard to\nrace, sex, religion\u2026 .\u201d This commitment, Perry continues,\nis \u201cthe principal ground of liberal democracy's further commitment to\ncertain basic human freedoms\u201d that are protected by law (Perry\n2003,\n 36).[13]\nMore generally, liberal critics maintain that citizens should support\nonly those coercive laws that they reasonably believe further the\ncommon good and are consistent with the demands of justice. These\ncommitments, they add, are not in tension with the claim that citizens\nmay support coercive laws that they believe to lack a plausible secular\nrationale. So long as a citizen is firmly committed to\nbasic liberal rights, she may coherently and without impropriety do so\neven though she regards these laws as having no plausible secular\njustification. More generally, liberal critics of the DRR\nmaintain that a citizen may rely on her religious convictions to\ndetermine which policies further the cause of justice and the common\ngood and may support coercive laws even if she regards them as having\nno plausible secular rationale.\n\n\n Second, liberal critics of the\nstandard view lay down constraints on the manner in which\ncitizens arrive at their political commitments (see Eberle 2002,\nWeithman 2002, and Wolterstorff 1997, 2012a). So, for example, each\ncitizen should abide by certain epistemic requirements: precisely\nbecause they ought not to support coercive laws that violate the\nrequirements of justice and the common good, citizens should take\nfeasible measures to determine whether the laws they support are\nactually just and good. In order to achieve that aim, citizens\nshould search for considerations relevant to the normative propriety of\ntheir favored laws, weigh those considerations judiciously, listen\ncarefully to the criticisms of those who reject their normative\ncommitments, and be willing to change their political commitments\nshould the balance of relevant considerations require them to do\nso. Again, liberal critics deny that even the most conscientious\nand assiduous adherence to such constraints precludes citizens from\nsupporting coercive laws that require a religious rationale. No\ndoubt, those who support coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale might do so in an insular, intransigent, irrational,\nor otherwise defective manner. But they\nneed not do so and, thus, their religiously-grounded support for\ncoercive laws need not be defective.\n\n\n Third, critics of the standard view\nneed have no aversion to secular justification and so need not object\nto a state of affairs in which each person, secular or religious, has\nwhat he or she regards as a compelling reason to endorse coercive laws\nof various sorts. (Indeed, they claim that such a state of\naffairs would arguably be a significant moral achievement\u2014a\ngood for all concerned.) According to the liberal critics,\nhowever, what is most important is that parity reigns: any\nnormative constraint that applies to the reasons on the basis of which\ncitizens make political decisions must apply impartially to both\nreligious and secular reasons. Many secular reasons employed to\njustify coercion\u2014ones that appeal to comprehensive perspectives\nsuch as utilitarianism and Kantianism, for example\u2014are highly\ncontroversial; in this sense, they are very similar to religious\nreasons. For this reason, some advocate for a cousin \u2014more or\nless distant, depending on the formulation\u2014of the DRR, namely, one\nthat lays down restrictions on all religious reasons and on some\nparticularly controversial secular reasons. (See section 6 below.)\nMoreover, the normative issues implicated by certain coercive laws are\nso complex and contentious that any rationale for or against\nthese laws will include claims that can be reasonably\nrejected\u2014secular or religious as the case might be.\n\n\n If this is right, according to the liberal\ncritics, equal treatment of religious and secular reasons is the order\nof the day: religious believers have no more, and no less, a\nresponsibility to aspire to persuade their secular compatriots by\nappeal to secular reasons than secularists have an obligation to aspire\nto persuade their religious compatriots by appeal to religious\nreasons. Otherwise put, according to the liberal critics, if we\naccept the claim that:\n\n\nIf a religious citizen finds herself in a position in which she has\nexcellent reason to believe that she cannot convince a fellow secular\ncitizen to support a coercive law that she deems just by appeal to\nreligious reasons, then she should do her best to appeal to secular\nreasons\u2014reasons that her cohort may find persuasive;\n\n\nwe should also accept:\n\n\nIf a secular citizen finds herself in a position in which she has\nexcellent reason to believe that she cannot convince a fellow religious\ncitizen to support a coercive law that she deems just by appeal to\nsecular reasons, then she should do her best to appeal to religious\nreasons\u2014reasons that her cohort may find persuasive.\n\n\nRecognizing parity of this sort, according to the liberal critics,\nlies at the heart of what it is to be a good citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy. For being a good citizen involves respecting one's\nfellow citizens, even when one disagrees with them. In a wide\nrange of cases, however, an agent exercises respect not by treating her\ninterlocutor as a generic human being or a generic citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy, but by treating her as a person who has a particular\nnarrative identity and life history, say, as an African American, a\nRussian immigrant, or a Muslim citizen. But doing this\noften requires pursuing and appealing to considerations that it is\nlikely that one's interlocutors with their own particular narrative\nidentity will find persuasive. And depending on the case, these\nreasons may be exclusively religious.\n\n\nTo this we should add a clarification: strictly speaking, the liberal\ncritics' insistence on parity between the pursuit of secular\nand religious reasons is consistent with the DRR. For, as we have\nconstrued it, the DRR allows that religious citizens may support\ncoercive laws for religious reasons (so long as they have and are\nprepared to provide a plausible secular justification for these\nlaws). And while its advocates do not typically emphasize the point,\nthe DRR permits secular citizens to articulate religious reasons that\nwill persuade religious believers to accept the secular citizens'\nfavored coercive laws (for reservations about this practice, see Audi\n1997, 135-37 on \u201cleveraging reasons\u201d.  See also\nSchwartzman 2014). Still, the DRR implies that there is an important\nasymmetry between the justificatory role played by religious and\nsecular reasons. To this issue we now turn.\n",
