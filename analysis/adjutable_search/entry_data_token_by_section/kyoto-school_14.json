In the end Nishida did agree\nto write an essay, \u201cPrinciples for a New World Order\u201d (NKZ\nXII, 426\u2013434; see Arisaka 1996), though his original text was\nedited and \u201csimplified\u201d by a sociologist serving as a\ngo-between. Nishida was even then disappointed that his attempt to\n\u201cbring out the dimension of universality present in the Japanese\nspirit\u201d seemed to have had no effect on Prime Minister\nT\u014dj\u014d Hideki and his bellicose regime (see Yusa 1994,\n124).\n\nFrom today\u2019s vantage point, Nishida\u2019s political writings\nappear highly ambivalent. On the one hand, his resistance to fascism\nand totalitarianism is unmistakable. Indeed it comes as no surprise\nthat he was in danger of being arrested\u2014and apparently only his\npublic stature and the fact that he had influential sympathizers\nwithin the moderate ranks of the government kept this from\nhappening\u2014when one reads the warning given in his 1941 speech\ndelivered directly to the emperor: \u201cAny totalitarian system that\nnegates outright the role of the individual is but an\nanachronism\u201d (NKZ XII, 271; see Yusa 1994, 111). Even in his\nmost compromised text, \u201cPrinciples for a New World Order,\u201d\nNishida urgently claims that the \u201cco-prosperity sphere\u201d\nmust not entail either ethnocentrism, expansionism,\nimperialism, colonialism, or totalitarianism (see NKZ XII,\n432\u201333). Elsewhere Nishida made clear that his vision was of a\nmulticultural world wherein neither the West would subsume the East\nnor vice versa (NKZ XIV, 404\u20135), wherein \u201cvarious\ncultures, while maintaining their own individual standpoints, would\ndevelop themselves through the mediation of the world\u201d (NKZ VII,\n452\u201353).\n\nOn the other hand, Nishida did think that nations\u2014and in\nparticular the Japanese nation with the emperor at its spiritual\ncenter\u2014had a special role to play in the historical formation of\nthis truly \u201cworldly world\u201d (sekai-teki sekai).\nMoreover, in his writings he did affirmatively employ such problematic\nphrases as \u201call the world under one roof\u201d\n(hakk\u014d-ichiu) and the \u201cimperial way\u201d\n(k\u014dd\u014d). While there is certainly room for criticism\nhere in light (and hindsight) of the historical record of\nJapan\u2019s political and cultural \u201cleadership\u201d (in\nfact, domination) of East Asia at this time, the issue of how to\ncritically evaluate Nishida\u2019s theoretical interventions is\ncomplicated by the hermeneutical fact that today we read such\ncatchwords and phrases through the semantic lenses of the right wing\nideologues who in the end succeeded in carving their definitions into\nthe annals of history. It must be kept in mind that, at the time, the\nprecise meaning of these phrases was still in dispute. Ueda Shizuteru\nhas aptly spoken of Nishida\u2019s \u201ctug-of-war over\nmeaning,\u201d a struggle which he ultimately lost (Ueda 1994, 97;\nalso see Goto-Jones 2005). Yusa Michiko writes in this regard:\n\u201cRather than invent a new vocabulary that would rise above the\nfray, [Nishida] took up the jargon and slogans of the day and sought\nto redeem them from their petty provincialism by opening them up to a\nmore universal perspective\u201d (Yusa 1994, 131).\n\nNevertheless, even after we have carried out a hermeneutically\nsensitive reconstruction of the context, and after we have finished\nreading between and behind the lines of his political texts, there\nundoubtedly remain a number of problematic aspects of Nishida\u2019s\npolitical thought, especially his idealistic view of the emperor\nsystem and Japan\u2019s purported world-historical calling to take on\na leadership role in the formation of an East Asia world (see Davis\n2006, 227\u201338; Osaki 2021, 117\u2013256; Arisaka 2020).\nAffirming the central place of the emperor in Japan as \u201can\nidentity of contradictions,\u201d Nishida cryptically writes:\n\u201cOur [i.e., Japan\u2019s] national polity is not simply a\ntotalitarianism. The Imperial House is the beginning and the end of\nour world, as the absolute present that embraces past and\nfuture\u201d (NKZ XII,\n 430).[16]\n And with regard to the central role of Japan in East Asia, he claims\nthat \u201cin order to build a particular world, a central figure\nthat carries the burden of the project is necessary. In East Asia\ntoday there is no other but Japan\u201d (NKZ XII, 429; Arisaka 1996,\n102).\n\nCritics may argue that Nishida\u2019s universalism is still plagued\nby an exemplary\n particularism,[17]\n and that he succeeds in questioning Eurocentrism only by way of\nshifting the locus of the concrete universal to Japan. Yoko Arisaka\nargues that \u201cthe chief claim of the defenders\u2014that\nNishida\u2019s philosophical \u2018universalism\u2019 is\nincompatible with nationalist ideology\u2014fails because\nuniversalist discourse was used both as a tool of liberation and\noppression in Japan\u2019s case\u201d (Arisaka 1999, 242). Arisaka\ncritically adds, however, that \u201cthe idea that a particular\nnation may be the bearer of a universal principle, such as freedom or\ndemocracy, and that, therefore, its actions in history serve a higher\nend, should be familiar from recent American experience\u201d (ibid.,\n244; also see Maraldo 1994, 355).\n\nTo be fair to Nishida, we should confess that we today have yet to\nsolve the post-Enlightenment aporia of how to reconcile universal\nhumanism with cultural particularity (a debate we inherit in part from\nthe Kant-Herder controversy). In other words, the question remains of\nhow to configure a multicultural world of dialogue instead of either\nan imperialistic monoculture or a clash of civilizations. In our\nsearch for an answer to this urgent question, we may still have much\nyet to learn from a critical appropriation of Nishida\u2019s thought\n(see Feenberg 1995; Maraldo 1995; Elberfeld 1999; Kopf 2011; Davis\n2013a; Krummel 2014; and Goto-Jones 2002, 2005, 2008, 2009).\n",
