    "main_text": "\n1. Context\n\nHume\u2019s aesthetic theory received limited attention until the\nsecond half of the Twentieth Century, when interest in the full range\nof Hume\u2019s thought was enlivened by the gradual recognition of\nhis importance among philosophers writing in English. Unfortunately,\nmany discussions of Hume\u2019s aesthetics concentrate on a single\nlate essay, \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d (1757). This\nemphasis misrepresents the degree to which Hume\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory is integrated into his philosophical system. This\nmisrepresentation has been countered by recent monographs on\nHume\u2019s general aesthetic theory by Dabney Townsend (2001) and\nTimothy Costelloe (2007).\n\nThe \u201cAdvertisement\u201d to his first publication, A\nTreatise of Human Nature, promises that if the first two volumes\nfind suitable \u201capprobation,\u201d the project will conclude\nwith \u201cthe examination of morals, politics, and criticism; which\nwill compleat this Treatise of human nature\u201d (T, Adv, xii).\nSadly, the Treatise was not a success and Hume limited the\nthird and final volume to the topic \u201cOf Morals.\u201d He never\nproduced his systematic treatment of politics and criticism and so\nnever completed his new \u201cscience\u201d of human nature. Those\ntopics would be handled piecemeal in several collections of short\nessays, the \u201cpolite\u201d writing that brought him the\npublishing success he desired.\n\nHume\u2019s concept of criticism is not interchangeable with either\naesthetics or philosophy of art. These now-familiar labels were not\navailable to Hume when he published his Treatise in 1739 and\n1740. The Abb\u00e9 Charles Batteux did not defend the idea of\ngrouping the arts together in an investigation of fine art until 1746.\nHowever, Hume knew and drew from the French tradition leading to\nBatteux\u2019s work. Under this general influence, his essays\noccasionally refer to the \u201cthe finer arts\u201d of painting,\nmusic, sculpture, and poetry (CL, 158; SOT 278; OT, 264; C, 289).\nThere is no direct evidence that Hume read Batteux, but they agree in\nidentifying the fine arts as mimetic \u201carts of luxury\u201d that\nexist primarily for the sake of our enjoyment (C, 289). Although\ncontemporaries such as Alexander Gerard and Lord Kames (Henry Home)\nboth use the phrase \u201cfine art,\u201d Hume\u2019s books and\nletters never use that expression. Hume was probably not aware of\nAlexander Baumgarten\u2019s Reflections on Poetry of 1735,\nthe work that introduced the term \u201caesthetics.\u201d The thesis\nthat aesthetic judgments are completely distinct from moral judgments\nwould not receive its modern formulation until Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Judgment (1790), after Hume\u2019s death in\n1776. So Hume\u2019s reflections on aesthetics occupy a pivotal niche\nbetween the appearance of fine art theory and Kant\u2019s defense of\nan independent aesthetic judgment in the Critique of Judgment\n\u2013 a defense clearly influenced by Kant\u2019s reading of\nHume\u2019s essays and An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nMorals.\n\nHume\u2019s theory is most firmly rooted in the work of Joseph\nAddison, Francis Hutcheson, and, to a lesser extent, Shaftesbury\n(Anthony Ashley Cooper). The specific connections are detailed in Kivy\n(2003), Townsend (2001), and Costelloe (2007). From the older\ntradition, elegantly expounded by Addison in numerous essays written\nbetween 1709 and 1715, Hume retains the idea that the values within\nthe scope of criticism are essentially pleasures of the human\nimagination. Although Hume acknowledges cases where beauty seems a\nmerely sensory pleasure, he emphasizes beauty\u2019s status as a\ncognitive pleasure. Taking beauty as his paradigm case of such a\nvalue, Hume combines Addison\u2019s theory of taste as an operation\nof imagination with Hutcheson\u2019s proposal that emotions are the\nfoundation of moral judgment. Elaborating on the \u201cinner\nsense\u201d theory, Hume endorses Hutcheson\u2019s stance on the\ngeneral question of the nature of both moral and aesthetic value.\nValue judgments are expressions of taste rather than reasoned\nanalysis. Values cannot be addressed except in the context of a\ngeneral theory about our shared human nature. Although recognition of\naesthetic and moral beauty is a manifestation of taste (and perhaps\nthey cannot ultimately be distinguished from one another), taste must\nnot be dismissed as subjective, idiosyncratic preference.\n\nGranted, Hume has many other influences. He drew on classical sources,\nincluding Cicero. His celebrated essay on taste draws heavily on\nFrench thought, particularly on that of the Abb\u00e9 Jean-Baptiste\nDubos(1748). (See\n Section 4\n below.) So does the essay on tragedy. (See\n Section 5\n below.) Detailed accounts of Hume\u2019s debt to Dubos are provided\nin Jones (2009) and Townsend (2011, pp. 76\u201385).\n\nWithin this framework of concerns and influences, Hume is neither\ninterested in working out a theory of art (in contributing to\nphilosophy of art) nor in analyzing aesthetic properties (in doing\naesthetics). Although he is aware of debates about the nature of the\nsublime and recognizes it as a category of artistic achievement (SOT,\n281), he offers no theory of the sublime. An attempt to pull together\na Humean account is made by Hipple (1967, pp. 42\u201344). Due to the\nseamless connection Hume posits between moral and aesthetic value,\nmuch of his technical discussion of aesthetics appears only as an\nillustration of his moral theory. Other details of Hume\u2019s\naesthetics emerge in contexts where he expounds his theory of\nimaginative association (EHUa, 102\u20137), elaborates on the value\nof delicacy of taste (DOT), and denies that his appeal to sentiment\nleads to skepticism about value distinctions (S, 217\u201319).\nConsequently, a reading that emphasizes \u201cOf the Standard of\nTaste\u201d at the expense of the Treatise and\nEnquiries shortchanges the theory\u2019s complexity.\n\nThus, the two essays that appear to summarize Hume\u2019s aesthetics\nare best understood as applications of a larger philosophical account\nof human nature, including our social nature. The construction of each\nessay suggests a purpose of working out details of the larger project\nin the face of an obvious counterexample. Those counterexamples are\nthe relativity of taste (SOT) and the pleasure we take in tragic\nfiction (OT). Yet their limited purpose does not detract from their\ncontinuing importance. They provide insight into perennial problems\nand so serve as the historical foundation for subsequent attempts to\ndefend a subjectivist aesthetic theory.\n\nUnfortunately, numerous interpretative challenges arise from\nHume\u2019s scattered presentation, his range of references, and his\neighteenth-century assumptions about art. Like many of his\ncontemporaries, Hume regards \u201cpoetry and the polite\nauthors\u201d as the most important arts (PW 3, 19). Timothy\nCostelloe (2018, chap. 4) consequently constructs an excellent survey\nof Humean aesthetics by canvassing the full range of Hume\u2019s\ncomments on poets and poetry. However, poetry differs from the more\npractical arts in being designed for the primary purpose of giving\npleasure (SOT, 277). When using the terms \u201cart\u201d and\n\u201cartist,\u201d Hume sometimes means any human artifice and any\nskilled designer (in one context, an \u201cartist\u201d is someone\nwho repairs a clock (EHU, 87)). In contexts where he can only be taken\nto be interested in the narrower category of fine art, Hume variously\nmentions painting, statuary, architecture, dance, poetry, and music.\nBut he places poetry among the arts of eloquent public discourse.\nEloquence includes sermons, essays, argumentative discourse, and other\ncategories that we today would regard as too overtly didactic to be\nfine art (E).\n\nHume assumes that every product of human labor has some definite\npurpose, with only a limited subset of art being produced for the sake\nof pleasure alone. (He is skeptical about appeals to teleological or\nfinal causes in nature.) Houses will be designed and built apart from\nany need to satisfy our taste for beauty, and representational art\nwill be produced in order to provide visual information. The\ninteresting questions are why houses and visual representations also\nappeal to taste, and what this appeal tells us about the relative\ncontributions of human nature and education as conditions for\nappropriate responses to our surroundings.\n\nSo what label best summarizes Hume\u2019s theory of moral and\naesthetic taste? It may be easier to specify which labels do not fit\nhis theory than to attach one to it. He rejects normative realism.\n(There is considerable controversy on the question of whether Hume is\na realist regarding matters of fact. Putting that issue to one side,\nhe clearly denies that normative judgments have the same degree of\nobjectivity that holds for matters of fact.) Hume is equally at pains\nto deny that reason provides an adequate foundation for judgments of\ntaste. Is he therefore a subjectivist? Not if subjectivism implies\nthat such judgments are arbitrary. He is not a relativist, for the\nmain point of the essay on taste is that some judgments of taste are\nsuperior to others. Nor, in his own terms, is he a skeptic regarding\naesthetic properties and value judgments. Despite his philosophical\nview that beauty is not a real property of things, Hume never\nquestions the meaningfulness of general practice of making aesthetic\njudgments. Because the verdicts of taste are sentiments, devoid of\ntruth-value, there is no opportunity for the conflicts and failures of\nreason that give rise to philosophical skepticism.\n\nHume is an inner sense theorist who treats aesthetic pleasure as an\ninstinctive and natural human response. Successful art exploits our\nnatural sentiments by employing appropriate composition and design.\nOnly empirical inquiry can establish reliable ways to elicit the\napproval of taste.\n2. Hume\u2019s Terminology\n\nHume regards the natural capacity of taste as fundamental to the human\nability to make moral and aesthetic judgments. Like his predecessors,\nHume sees an analogy between an \u201cinner sense\u201d for beauty\nand the sense of taste for food and drink. Natural, general laws guide\nboth. Both permit of education and refinement and thus better and\nworse responses. Both produce sentiments or feelings of approval and\ndisapproval. But only the \u201cmental\u201d taste, the exercise of\nwhich is involved in moral and aesthetic judgment, admits of\nrefinement through \u201cthe interposition\u201d of ideas (T, 275).\n\n\nHume\u2019s eighteenth-century terminology includes a pair of terms\nno longer in general use. In his basic nomenclature, \u201ctaste in\nmorals, eloquence, or beauty\u201d assigns either\n\u201capprobation\u201d or \u201cdisapprobation\u201d (or some\ncombination of both) to objects of taste (T, 547n). Approbation is\n\u201ca peculiar delight\u201d (T, 298) and a\n\u201cparticular kind of pleasure\u201d (T, 472). It feels\ndifferent from other pleasures. He variously characterizes approbation\nas a feeling of approval, liking, or affection. A beautiful object or\naction strikes us as amiable, agreeable, and desirable. Yet moral and\naesthetic responses are not identical, for \u201cthe satisfaction is\ndifferent, [which] keeps our sentiments concerning them from being\nconfounded\u201d (T, 472). Hume describes the feeling of\ndisapprobation as one of disapproving, disliking, and contempt. An\nugly object or vicious action feels odious, disagreeable, and\nundesirable.\n\nIn the eighteenth-century context of moral theory,\n\u201csentiment\u201d is a generic label for emotions. (Hume\u2019s\ntheory is sometimes identified as \u201csentimentalism,\u201d but\nthat term has unfortunate modern connotations\u2014though see the\nentry on\n moral sentimentalism.)\n In Hume\u2019s technical vocabulary, all emotions are impressions,\nnot ideas. The sentiments associated with beauty and ugliness are\nreflective impressions. They are not \u201cimpressions of the\nsenses.\u201d Instead, they are responses to sensory impressions (T,\n276).\n\nBeauty is a feeling of approbation, and an original, simple impression\nof the mind. Impressions are contrasted with ideas, which he\nalternatively calls \u201cthoughts.\u201d Ideas are\n\u201ccopies\u201d of impressions, and seldom have the force or\nclarity of the experiences they copy. For Hume, experiencing a\nparticular kind of approbation is a necessary condition for thinking\nabout the idea of beauty. An individual cannot construct the idea of\nbeauty out of other ideas, which is equivalent to saying that the idea\nderives from the proper sentiment of approbation (T, 469). In the\ncomplete absence of the operations of taste, thoughts about beauty\nwould not occur.\n\nTaste is the capacity to respond with approbation and disapprobation.\nBut how does taste relate to Hume\u2019s various remarks about\n\u201cperceptions\u201d and \u201cdiscernments\u201d of beauty, of\nour \u201cjudging\u201d a work, and of critics who \u201cgive\njudgment\u201d and who \u201cgive\u201d or \u201cpronounce\u201d\na \u201cverdict\u201d or \u201crecommendation\u201d (SOT, passim)?\nHume seems to equate perception of beauty with the experience of the\nsentiment. (This equation underlies the problem of whether all tastes\nare equal). Does he distinguish between the critic\u2019s experience\nof the sentiment and the judgment or verdict? If a verbal\npronouncement that an object is beautiful is nothing more than an\nexpression or report of the speaker\u2019s sentiment, then Hume faces\nthe difficulty that a critic\u2019s verdict is not really a\nrecommendation of the object. If your pronouncement that a piece of\nmusic is beautiful means no more than that you have felt a certain\npleasure upon hearing it, then your verdict expresses your pleasure\nwithout saying anything about the music\u2019s capacity to please\nothers. So although critics issue judgments of taste based on their\nown sentiments, a judgment of taste must involve something more than a\npleasing or displeasing sentiment.\u00a0\n\nHume observes that there is a difference between expressing\none\u2019s own sentiments and making a moral distinction. When\nsomeone speaks of another\u2019s behavior as \u201cvicious\nor odious or depraved, he then speaks another\nlanguage, and expresses sentiments, in which he expects all his\naudience to concur with him\u201d (EPM, 272). Moral and aesthetic\njudgment requires \u201csteady and general points\nof view\u201d (T, 581\u201382; see also SOT, 276), common to others\n(EPM, 272). Hume\u2019s various descriptions of this point of view\ninvite conflicting interpretations. However, it clearly requires the\ncritic to reflect upon the relationship between the sentiment and its\nobject.\n\nWhether we call them \u201caesthetic judgments\u201d or\n\u201cjudgments of taste,\u201d aesthetic verdicts are unlike\nordinary judgments about matters of fact. Matters of fact are relevant\nstates of affairs, which render complex ideas either true or false.\nThe same cannot be said about verdicts arising from the operations of\ntaste. Sentiment, and sentiment alone, determines that a particular\nobject is or is not beautiful.\n\nTruth is disputable; not taste: what exists in the nature of things is\nthe standard of our judgement; what each man feels within himself is\nthe standard of sentiment. Propositions in geometry may be proved,\nsystems in physics may be controverted; but the harmony of verse, the\ntenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must give immediate\npleasure (EPM, 171).\n\n\nWe do not infer that a sunset is beautiful and so deserving of\napprobation. We see the sunset, and the visual impressions please us.\nIf we have the proper point of view, we are justified in saying that\nthe sunset is beautiful. This verdict is more than a report or\nexpression of the sentiment, yet the sentiment is an irreplaceable\nelement of the judgment. A parallel claim is made of moral\ndiscrimination. \u201cPleasure and pain,\u201d he insists, are the\n\u201cessence\u201d of beauty and deformity (T, 299). But how does a\nliterary work \u201cgive immediate pleasure\u201d?\n\nOne of Hume\u2019s most puzzling claims is that taste is an\n\u201cimmediate\u201d response. In his extended treatment of the\npassions and emotions in the Treatise, Hume says that\n\u201cimmediate\u201d feelings are ones that do not involve the\n\u201cinterposition\u201d of ideas (T, 275). Some pleasures and\npains are \u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that they are\nimpressions that immediately accompany other impressions (e.g., the\nexperience of a very hot flame is accompanied by an experience of\npain). How does a literary work \u201cgive immediate pleasure\u201d?\nTaken literally, the Treatise appears to commit Hume to the\nview that literary works are beautiful independent of the\naudience\u2019s ability to assign ideas or meanings to the words. As\nnoted by James Grant (2014, p. 368), the Treatise sometimes\nposits a distinction between beauty, which is the quality of the\nobject that acts upon us, and the pleasure it arouses. But these\nproposals are not repeated in Hume\u2019s later writings and a\ncommitment to observer-independent beauty is certainly not\nHume\u2019s mature position. His official theory is that there is\n\u201cmental, as well as bodily taste\u201d (SOT, 274), and both\nmoral and aesthetic discrimination depend on mental taste. The\nrequisite sentiments are spontaneous products of the mind, but they\nare not uninformed responses.\n\nMental taste normally requires some intervening thought process. So\nthe pleasures and pains of aesthetic judgment are not immediate in\nbeing direct responses to other impressions.\n\nSome species of beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first\nappearance, command our affection and approbation; and where they fail\nof this effect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their\ninfluence, or adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in\nmany orders of beauty, particularly those of the finer arts, it is\nrequisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper\nsentiment; and a false relish may frequently be corrected by argument\nand reflection. There are just grounds to conclude, that moral beauty\npartakes much of this latter species, and demands the assistance of\nour intellectual faculties, in order to give it a suitable influence\non the human mind (EPM, 173).\n\n\nMental taste arises in response to ideas that arise in response to\nimpressions (e.g., viewing a photograph occasions thoughts about the\nplace pictured, leading to thoughts about experiences one had or might\nhave there, and the thoughts arising in this imaginative process are\npleasurable or painful). Hume regards this \u201cimmediacy\u201d of\ntaste as entirely compatible with the influence of intellectual and\nimaginative faculties.\n\nTaste is immediate and spontaneous, yet the application of \u201cgood\nsense\u201d and \u201creason\u201d improves it (SOT, 277). Taste is\nnot improved by reasoning from a priori normative principles. Moral\nand aesthetic discriminations \u201care not conclusions of\nreason\u201d (T, 457). Neither results from a mere \u201ccomparing\nof ideas\u201d (T, 463). However, taste can be influenced by\nconsultation of \u201cgeneral rules of art\u201d or\n\u201crules\u201d that \u201care founded only on experience and\nobservation\u201d (SOT, 270). For different views on the content of\nthese rules or principles, see Hester (1979), Dickie (1996, pp.\n126\u2013131), Shelley (2002), Dickie (2003), and Shelley (2004).\nMental taste involves reason in the sense of \u201csound\nunderstanding,\u201d which ultimately depends on imaginative\nassociations of ideas. So taste involves imaginative pleasure, as\nAddison proposed. This doctrine of imaginative pleasure has no special\nconnection with creativity or with the capacity to produce art.\n\nTo summarize Hume on taste, aesthetic and moral response is\n\u201cimmediate\u201d in the sense that the feeling occurs\nspontaneously in anyone who makes customary imaginative associations.\nHume wants to emphasize that a critic does not infer the presence of\nbeauty. Yet he also acknowledges the relevance of sound understanding\nto taste. This combination of doctrines has implications for the\npractice of justifying judgments of taste, and becomes the focus of\nthe essay \u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d Knowing that a\nsonnet has the same form as a second, beautiful sonnet will not offer\nany reason to think that they are equally fine poems. Only a reading\nof the sonnet can support claims about its beauty. However,\nHume\u2019s theory should be interpreted with caution, against the\nbackdrop of his other claims about moral and aesthetic distinctions.\nThe general, natural principles of taste are supplemented by learned\nrules, so that knowledge of other sonnets contributes to a more\naccurate or refined evaluation of the merits and flaws of a particular\nsonnet. His subjectivism does not lead to relativism. Not every\nsentiment is equally good.\n3. Beauty and Taste in Hume\u2019s Moral Theory\n3.1 Subjectivism\n\nHume proposes that feeling, not thought, informs us that an object is\nbeautiful or ugly, or that an action exhibits virtue or vice:\n\u201cThe very feeling constitutes our praise or\nadmiration\u201d (T, 471). The feeling or sentiment is itself an\naesthetic or moral discrimination. It is prior to, and the basis of,\nany subsequent expression of praise or admiration. The sentiment\nis the beauty of the object and it is the virtue of\ndesirable human action. Sentiment is the sole source of values\ngoverning human activity. Taste is a \u201cproductive faculty, and\ngilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed\nfrom internal sentiment, raises, in a manner, a new creation.\u201d\nThat new creation is \u201cbeauty and deformity, virtue and\nvice\u201d (EPM, 294). However, the sentiment is calm rather than\nviolent, so an unphilosophical perspective treats it as a property\n\u201cof the object\u201d (S, 218). \n\nThis moral and aesthetic subjectivism attracts Hume for the same\nreason that it attracts Hutcheson. The appeal to sentiment offers a\nmiddle position between the two prevailing theories within English\nletters, Hobbesian egoism and ethical rationalism. Hutcheson holds\nthat virtue and beauty are not qualities of the people and things to\nwhich they are attributed. We may speak as if objects and people have\nmoral and aesthetic properties, but the relevant property is merely an\n\u201cidea raised in us.\u201d Hume alters Hutcheson\u2019s theory\nby imposing his own philosophical vocabulary, making beauty an\nimpression rather than an idea. But they agree that to describe a\nperson as virtuous or an object as beautiful is to make a claim about\ntheir tendency to cause a certain response. Is it imprudent and\n\u201ctoo strong,\u201d Hume asks Hutcheson, to summarize the thesis\nin the following terms (HL, I, 39\u201340)? \u201c[W]hen you\npronounce any action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing, but\nthat from the constitution of your nature you have a feeling or\nsentiment of blame from the contemplation of it. Vice and virtue,\ntherefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and cold, which,\naccording to modern philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but\nperceptions in the mind\u201d (T, 469). Emphasizing Hume\u2019s debt\nto Hutcheson, Kivy (2003, pp. 307\u2013310), argues that Hume\nunderstands beauty very much on the model of colors. Although they are\nsecondary qualities and so do not directly reveal the properties of\nthe occasioning object, some color perception is \u201ctrue and\nreal\u201d (SOT, 272), and so it is for Hume likewise with beauty.\nHowever, virtue and beauty are not strictly analogous to secondary\nqualities, such as heat and cold, because a critic\u2019s claim that\na work is beautiful involves an element of endorsement that does not\narise in the observation that ice is cold. The case against reading\nHumean beauty on the model of ideas of secondary qualities is provided\nby Shiner (1996) and Taylor (2011).\n\nHume defends the centrality of sentiment with the following reasoning.\nRecognitions of virtue and beauty require particular sentiments in\nhuman observers. If the discriminations of taste took place without\nthese sentiments, we would lack any motivation to do what we regard as\nmoral. Moral and aesthetic judgments have practical consequences that\nmere reason lacks. So taste differs from the assent that characterizes\nunderstanding or reason (T, 458; EPM, 172; S, 219). Although taste\nresponds to real qualities of objects, we cannot replace the exercise\nof taste with the assent of reason. In many cases, beauty and\ngracefulness (both aesthetic and moral) are inexplicable; they resist\nour efforts at explication, and we must trust the \u201csure\ntestimony of taste and sentiment\u201d (EPM, 267).\n\nEpistemically, taste is nonetheless a fallible indicator of beauty and\ndeformity. The underlying sentiments never \u201crefer\u201d to\nanything in their cause (SOT, 268). Feelings do not represent any\naspect of their occasioning objects, and they are easily attached to\nobjects other than their cause (T, 280). (As with any causal\nrelationship, such as the causal link between smoke and fire, an\nisolated effect does not refer back to its cause, nor does it provide\nus with information about the nature of the object or event that\ncauses it. If we experience smoke but have never experienced fire, the\nsmoke will tell us nothing about the nature of fire.) As effects of\nour interaction with the world, sentiments cannot reliably inform us\nabout the nature of their causes. It will not always be clear, prior\nto careful attention and reflection, which features of a work of art\nare responsible for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation.\nOn Hume\u2019s analysis, the chain running from cause to effect turns\nout to be extremely complex, for the relationship is indirect and\n\u201cthe human body is a mighty complicated machine\u201d with many\n\u201csecret powers\u201d (EHU, 87; see also SOT, 270). Knowing\nthis, good critics pronounce their verdicts only after they clarify\nhow their own sentiments relate to the object that is being evaluated\n(SOT, 270\u201371).\n\nHowever, some of Hume\u2019s critics see a fundamental contradiction\nbetween his subjectivism and his distinction between better and worse\ncritics or the possession of better and worse taste. The criticism is\nmost often formulated against Hume\u2019s parallel discussion of\nethical evaluation. A particularly forceful statement of the objection\nis provided by Philippa Foot (1966). Hume was acutely aware of the\ngeneral problem and it is the starting point of the essay \u201cOf\nthe Standard of Taste.\u201d (See\n Section 4\n below.)\n3.2 The Dispositional Analysis\n\nOur sentiments obey general principles governing our species. Yet we\nmust be able to make judgments of taste immediately, without having to\nbe aware of the laws governing them. \n\nHume\u2019s acknowledgment of regular, predictable causes of the\nmoral and aesthetic sentiment is sometimes taken as an indication that\nHume is not a genuine subjectivist. On this reading, he equates beauty\nand virtue with dispositional properties of external objects.\nAttributions of moral and aesthetic properties to objects indicate a\nspeaker\u2019s acknowledgment of the object\u2019s tendency to\nproduce the sentiment. There are passages that suggest such a reading:\n\u201cbeauty is such an order and constitution of parts, as \u2026\nis fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul\u201d (T,\n299; see SOT, 273). The dispositional analysis of beauty is attributed\nto Hume by Savile (1982, p. 161), Mothersill (1984, pp.\n205\u2013206), and Levinson (2002). Reasons to think it is mistaken\nare provided by Baxter (1990). The dispositional analysis should not\nbe confused with the position that features of objects cause the\nrequisite sentiment. The case for attributing a causal theory of taste\nto Hume is provided by Shiner (1996)\n\nDespite such passages, it is questionable whether Hume really offers a\ndispositional analysis. A dispositional analysis tells us which\nproperties would exist if certain conditions were satisfied. A\nsimplified dispositional analysis treats \u201cCork is buoyant\u201d\nas equivalent in meaning to \u201cIf a piece of cork is placed in\nwater, it floats.\u201d A simplified dispositional analysis of beauty\ntreats \u201cThis object is beautiful\u201d as equivalent in meaning\nto \u201cIf anyone perceives this object under ideal conditions, a\nsentiment of approbation accompanies the perception.\u201d\u00a0 On\nthis account, beauty is distinct from the sentiment of approbation.\nThe sentiment is incorporated into the analysis, but the sentiment is\nnot itself a dispositional property.\n\nSuppose that Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property. Like the\ndispositional terms \u201cbuoyant\u201d and \u201cbrittle,\u201d\n\u201cbeauty\u201d could be predicated of objects, generating\njudgments that are true or false for different objects. Statements\nattributing dispositional properties to objects are true even if the\nappropriate conditions are never satisfied (e.g., \u201cThis vase is\nbrittle\u201d can be true despite the fact that the vase never gets\nbroken). Yet Hume clearly denies that judgments of taste are\ntruth-valued, and he denies that it makes sense to make inferences\nabout an object\u2019s beauty in advance of the requisite sentiment\n(S, 219).\n\nHume famously argues that, in order to clarify any idea, \u201cwe\nneed but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea\nderived\u201d (EHU, 22). If beauty is a dispositional property,\nthen one arrives at the idea of beauty by associating particular\ncauses with particular effects under specific conditions. In\nHume\u2019s terminology, a dispositional idea of beauty would be the\nidea of a complex relation of cause and effect. It would be a causal\nprinciple, and we could not employ the idea prior to formulating such\na principle. Yet, once again, Hume denies an implication of the\ndispositional analysis. The sentiment of approbation is our only\nsource for our idea of beauty, and there are cases where we recognize\nbeauty in advance of any reasoning about the beautiful object (EPM,\n173).\n\nFurthermore, if Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property, he\nhas a model close at hand in Hutcheson\u2019s analysis. But Hume\navoids offering any such account. Aside from a willingness to identify\nseveral ways that works of art must fail to please refined taste, Hume\ndoes very little to advance the traditional and familiar project of\ncriticism, the stipulation of rules for successful art. Granted, he\nendorses the existence of such rules (SOT, 269\u2013273) and\nprovisionally suggests (SOT, 273) that they serve as our standard of\ntaste, a point explored by Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 2009), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3\u201317). However, he does not\nprovide an organized or dedicated presentation of the properties of\nobjects that regularly cause the sentiment of approbation. Costelloe\n(2018, pp. 161\u2013170) has nonetheless extracted three such\nprinciples from Hume\u2019s discussions of poetry. First, artistic\ndepictions must be grounded in what is familiar or, at the very least,\nplausible. Second, artworks must be constrained by coherence in their\nimaginative associations. Third, simplicity is preferable to\n\u201cexcessive ornamentation and artifice\u201d (Costelloe 2018,\n167). At the same time, Hume recognizes that any established\ncorrelation between sentiment and objective properties might be\ndefeated by the next example that we encounter (SOT, 270). Despite the\nexistence of \u201cgeneral principles of approbation or blame,\u201d\ntaste depends on too many variables (\u201cincidents and\nsituations\u201d) to offer a detailed dispositional analysis (SOT,\n271).\n\nPassages endorsing a dispositional account might be slips of the pen.\nOr, more likely, Hume does not believe that it is possible to define\nevaluative terms. They are indefinable, primitive terms. Hume\nemphasizes that \u201ccertain qualities in objects\u201d are the\noccasions for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation (SOT,\n273). Formal design is one such quality (SOT 271; T, 299, 364). The\nexistence of occasioning qualities provides theoretical support for\nthe possibility of a convergence of refined taste. So our primitive\nevaluative terms are not arbitrarily applied. Nonetheless, it is\nirresponsible to endorse any particular thing or action in advance of\nthe verdict of unprejudiced taste.\n3.3 Imagination and Point of View\u00a0\n\nInformed understanding makes a vital contribution to most aesthetic\nand moral judgment (EPM, 173; SOT, 277). For Hume, taste is improved\nby practice in making \u201ccomparisons\u201d among objects (SOT,\n275) and by the employment of \u201cgood sense\u201d (SOT, 277).\n\n\nHume blurs traditional distinctions between thinking and imagining.\nThoughts would not extend beyond our actual experiences were it not\nfor the imaginative associations established by the force of\nrepetition or \u201ccustom\u201d (T, 170; EHU, 43). Learned\nassociations encourage us to rearrange our ideas in intelligible\npatterns, permitting us to create ideas of things never actually\nexperienced (e.g., fictitious creatures or distant places).\nImagination also creates chains of associated ideas, encouraging\nthoughts to move rapidly from one idea to another.\n\nGood taste therefore presupposes an active imagination. Suppose one\nwakes in the morning and smells the distinctive aroma of coffee, and\nthe experience is pleasurable. This appreciation depends on a learned,\nimaginative association: the smell brings to mind its cause, the\nbrewing coffee, and its purpose, the consumption of the coffee. The\nagreeable sentiment is a response to this complex association of\nimpressions and ideas, not to the smell alone. Critical evaluation is\ntherefore highly contextual: \u201cThe passion, in pronouncing its\nverdict, considers not the object simply, as it is in itself, but\nsurveys it with all the circumstances, which attend it\u201d (S,\n224).\n\nIt is important to recognize that Humean imagination is not a free and\nunrestrained activity. It is constrained by a relatively small set of\npermanent principles of imaginative association (T, 10, 225; EHU, 24).\nAlthough poets may \u201cprofess to follow implicitly the suggestions\nof their fancy\u201d (T, 225), their poetry has little chance of\npleasing others if their \u201cfancy\u201d or imagination employs\nirregular associations. The universal principles of imaginative\nassociation allow artists to predict how their representational and\nnarrative designs will move audiences. With artworks, the intentions\nof the artist must be considered, a point emphasized by Jones (1976,\npp. 55\u201356), and Jones (2009).\n\nHume recognizes a very small class of cases for which imaginative\nassociation is not needed to recognize beauty. In these cases, initial\nimpressions of the mere \u201cform\u201d of a material object\ngenerate approbation (T, 364). Such cases are more typical of natural\nbeauty than art (EPM, 173). So imagination is not always necessary for\ndiscovering beauty. Pleasing form is sometimes sufficient. However,\n\u201c\u2019tis seldom we rest there\u201d (T, 363).\n\nSo Hume does not advocate a simple causal relationship between form\nand sentiment. In most cases, our beliefs about the object alter our\nsentiments. Forms are generally most pleasing when \u201cthe order\nand construction of parts\u201d (T, 299) suggests a corresponding\nutility for humans or expresses agreeable emotions. These suggestions\nneed not be accurate in order to trigger approbation and\ndisapprobation. A particular object might appear balanced, graceful,\nand beautiful despite our knowledge of its limited utility (T, 584).\nObjects may displease taste despite their genuine utility.\n\nA house may displease me by being ill-contrived for the convenience of\nthe owner; and yet I may refuse to give a shilling towards the\nrebuilding of it. Sentiments must touch the heart, to make them\ncontroul our passions: But they need not extend beyond the\nimagination, to make them influence our taste. When a building seems\nclumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and disagreeable; though\nwe be fully assured of the solidity of the workmanship. \u2018Tis a\nkind of fear, which causes this sentiment of disapprobation; but the\npassion is not the same with that which we feel, when obliged to stand\nunder a wall, that we really think tottering and insecure. The\nseeming tendencies of objects affect the mind: And the\nemotions they excite are of a like species with those, which proceed\nfrom the real consequences of objects, but their feeling is\ndifferent. Nay, these emotions are so different in their feeling, that\nthey may often be contrary, without destroying each other; as when the\nfortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are esteemed beautiful\nupon account of their strength, though we could wish that they were\nentirely destroyed. The imagination adheres to the general\nviews of things, and distinguishes the feelings they produce, from\nthose which arise from our particular and momentary situation (T,\n586\u201387).\n\n\nHume\u2019s views on the aesthetic relevance of form and utility are\nexplored by Carolyn Korsmeyer (1976), while utility is emphasized by\nTaylor (2011). Given Hume\u2019s debt to Hutcheson, Korsmeyer notes\nthat it is tempting to read such passages as foreshadowing the\nsubsequent theory of aesthetic response as \u201cdisinterested\u201d\npleasure. However, we should be careful here. Hume uses the term\n\u201cdisinterest\u201d as the contrary of \u201cself-love\u201d\n(EPM, 296), but he does not use the term in relation to aesthetic\nsentiment. Hume\u2019s \u201ccommon,\u201d \u201cuniversal,\u201d\nor \u201cgeneral view of things\u201d is a simpler proposal. He\nwants to remind us that we cannot expect the agreement of others if we\njudge things from a limited and prejudiced perspective (EPM, 272).\n\nRelations of form and function can operate at an extremely abstract\nlevel: \u201cA building, whose doors and windows were exact squares,\nwould hurt the eye by that very proportion: as ill adapted to the\nfigure of a human creature, for whose service the fabric was\nintended\u201d (EPM, 212\u201313). Those who respond with sentiment\nare moved by \u201cimaginary\u201d and general consequences, not\nsimply utility for the person passing judgment (EPM, 217\u201318).\nFurthermore, formal design itself can convey emotions which influence\naesthetic response: \u201cThere is no rule in painting or statuary\nmore indispensable than that of balancing the figures, and placing\nthem with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity. A\nfigure, which is not justly balanced, is ugly; because it conveys the\ndisagreeable ideas of fall, harm, and pain\u201d (EPM, 245).\n\nThus, Hume blocks the conclusion that all taste is equal by\ndistinguishing between two points of view that we can adopt toward any\nperson, object, or action. We can respond from the point of view of\nour own self-interest. But this response is prejudiced and often\nproduces \u201ca false relish\u201d (EPM, 173). Or we can respond\nfrom the general point of view, a reflective evaluation that is not\nmotivated by self-interest. The general point of view is influenced by\nmyriad beliefs about the object and its context. For example,\nbelieving that something is rare greatly magnifies our pleasure (S,\n224). Where self-interest might make me jealous of your new home and\nwill interfere with the sentiment of beauty, a reflective response\nwill allow me to appreciate its construction and design.\n\nFor Hume, normative conflicts can only be resolved by moving to a\nproperly informed general perspective, with \u201cjust conclusions\ndrawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and\ngeneral facts fixed and ascertained\u201d (EPM, 173). The essay on\ntaste defends this position and outlines a theory of how critics can\nplace themselves in such a position:\n\nwhen any work is addressed to the public, though I should have a\nfriendship or enmity with the author, I must depart from this\nsituation; and considering myself as a man in general, forget, if\npossible, my individual being and my peculiar circumstances. A person\ninfluenced by prejudice, complies not with this condition; but\nobstinately maintains his natural position, without placing himself in\nthat point of view, which the performance supposes (SOT,\n276\u201377).\n\n\nHume also invokes the operation of a sympathetic sentiment. Since\nsympathy plays an important role in his moral theory (T, 577; EPM,\n225), he must include it in his aesthetic theory if he is to sustain\nthe close ties he posits between morals and aesthetics. The general\npoint of view takes notice of pleasure that the object is fitted to\nbring to other people. The idea of their benefit generates sympathetic\npleasure, increasing the sentiment of approbation (T,\n364\u201365).\n\nHowever, Hume\u2019s claim that most judgments of beauty require some\nelement of sympathy (T, 363) becomes harder to maintain in cases of\nfine art. It is not clear how the appreciation of a sonnet or melody\ninvolves an idea of the value it has for others. Hume occasionally\ntalks as if artistic beauty is entirely a question of formal design.\nAnd he seems to think that the utility and therefore value of some art\nis the pleasure it affords (e.g., with poetry), as if he advocates an\nearly art-for-art\u2019s-sake position. This interpretation is an\nobvious consequence of any interpretation that takes Hume to say that\nan object\u2019s capacity to provide pleasure exhausts its aesthetic\nvalue. (This reading is endorsed by Levinson (2002) and challenged by\nShelley (2011, 2013.) But the fact that a poem pleases someone else,\nor even large numbers of people, does not encourage sympathetic\napprobation for the poem.\n\nA careful reading suggests that Hume neither separates the fine arts\nfrom the other arts nor places sympathy at the center of aesthetic\nresponse. From the start, he recognizes multiple reasons for\napprobation. He hypothesizes a general but not universal connection\nbetween artificial and natural forms and the appearance of utility (T,\n195). He offers examples of basic design in painting (T, 364\u201365)\nand of \u201cunharmonious\u201d literature (EPM, 224). Poetry has an\nobvious formal element. Reading begins with impressions of dark shapes\narranged in lines on white pages. Readers silently associate the\nprinted text with aural ideas (the voice of a human speaker). Through\nimaginative association, literary forms have expressive human\ncharacters that elicit sympathetic pleasure and pain. Yet a reader who\nis not engaged by the subject matter may still find value in the\n\u201cstyle and ingenuity of the composition\u201d (T, 98). Because\nHume does not operate with assumptions about the uniqueness of fine\nart, his theory cuts across the distinction between fine art and\nrhetoric. Good design and eloquence are beautiful and desirable in all\nartifacts and speech, not merely in fine art (E).\n\nWhere appropriate, the refined taste of a good critic will weigh the\nrelative contributions of all aspects of the object of taste. Formal\ndesign is a contributing excellence and not the sole focus of\naesthetic discrimination. To arrive at a proper moral judgment,\n\u201call the circumstances and relations must be previously known;\nand the mind, from the contemplation of the whole, feels some new\nimpression of affection or disgust, esteem or contempt, approbation or\nblame\u201d (EPM, 290). Aesthetic discrimination works in the same\nway (EPM, 291). In some situations, a single inharmonious element can\nupset the beauty of the whole. Hume discusses such cases in \u201cOf\nthe Standard of Taste.\u201d But then what of tragic literature, in\nwhich sympathy produces ongoing unease? How can there be an impression\nof approbation for a tragic play? Hume addresses this problem in\n\u201cOf Tragedy.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of reader-response criticism, Hume is frequently\nchallenged for not making enough allowances for the legitimate\ndifferences that readers bring to the same piece of writing. No two\nreaders will respond with the same associations of ideas. So how can\nHume hypothesize a convergence of critical response? As a criticism of\nHume, this reply backfires. Hume concedes, \u201ceach mind perceives\na different beauty\u201d (SOT, 268). But he recognizes an even more\nradical problem. He admits that every stable object is really a\n\u201cfiction\u201d posited by the operations of imagination and\nsentiment. We always \u201cbestow on the objects a greater regularity\nthan what is observed in our mere perceptions\u201d (T, 197).\nHowever, this philosophical grasp of the situation has no practical\neffect in making anyone skeptical of the existence of houses, trees,\nand books. It does not detract from the truth and falsity of what we\nordinarily say about them. Novels and plays and paintings are not\nspecial cases. Admitting that they call for complex operations of\nimagination does not differentiate them from other objects and should\nnot count against the possibility of critical judgment.\n\nThe crux of the problem is the difference between saying that\nHamlet is a play by William Shakespeare and saying that\nHamlet is a flawed play. The former claim expresses a matter\nof fact; the latter expresses a normative judgment. Both judgements\nstem from complex imaginative associations. The presence of\nimaginative thought poses no special problem for the convergence of\nevaluative discrimination. Hume\u2019s primary problem is to explain\nhow sentiment, as the essential source of value judgments, is subject\nto principled dispute. Hume directly confronts this problem in\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d\n4. Hume\u2019s Essay on Taste\u00a0\n\nHume tells us that \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d was written\nin some haste and exists only to permit publication of other essays\n(HL 2, 253). On the advice of Philip Stanhope, Hume removed \u201cOf\nthe Immortality of the Soul\u201d and \u201cOf Suicide\u201d from a\nplanned volume of new essays. His publisher informed him that the\nresulting volume was too slim to print, bind, and sell. Hume then\nbrought the book to an acceptable length by penning a new essay,\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d Hume made nearly two hundred\neditorial corrections over the subsequent twenty years and multiple\neditions, the majority of which involve punctuation. He never altered\nhis argument. The essay is his last word on any topic in\n\u201ccriticism.\u201d In addition to its importance as an\nelaboration of Hume\u2019s views, Kant read the essay in translation\nand it stands to Kant\u2019s mature aesthetic theory in much the way\nthat Hume\u2019s account of cause and effect stands to the\nCritique of Pure Reason. Succinct analyses of their\ncontrasting positions are provided by Kulenkampff (1990), Savile\n(1993, pp. 81\u201384), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 45\u201352).\n\nHume reminds us of the radical difference in kind between matters of\nfact and the pronouncements of sentiment. Verdicts of sentiment lack a\ntruth-value. So it is surprising to find him endorsing the position\nthat many judgments of taste are \u201cabsurd and ridiculous\u201d\n(SOT, 269). Small differences affect taste, yet most people notice\nonly \u201cthe grosser and more palpable qualities of the\nobject\u201d (SOT, 278). Only judges with a more refined taste will\nrespond to the \u201cuniversal\u201d appeal of superior art. Because\nrefinement demands considerable practice, such critics are few in\nnumbers.\n\nIt is tempting to read Hume\u2019s argument as a move away from his\nsignature subjectivism and toward some brand of normative realism. But\na careful reading of the text reveals that nothing is said to deny his\nearlier support for subjectivism and there are no direct endorsements\nof realism. The standard of taste should provide rules for\n\u201cconfirming one sentiment, and condemning another\u201d (SOT,\n268). On this topic, see Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 1984), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3\u201317). However, the standard is\nnormative: it must explain why the sentiments of some critics are\nbetter and worse. It does not follow that sentiments are true and\nfalse in any absolute sense. These reflections lead Hume to postulate\nfive criteria for identifying good or \u201ctrue\u201d critics:\n\u201cStrong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by\npractice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can\nalone entitle critics to this valuable character\u201d (SOT,\n278).\n\nAfter several stabs at identifying the standard of taste, Hume\nidentifies it as the consensus or \u201cjoint verdict\u201d of\n\u201ctrue critics\u201d (SOT, 278\u201379). However, such critics\nare \u201crare\u201d (SOT, 280) and \u201cfew are qualified to give\njudgment on any work of art\u201d (SOT, 278). Consequently, it is not\nthe verdict of contemporary critics that constitutes the standard, but\nrather the consensus of qualified judges over time and from multiple\ncultures (SOT, 271; SOT, 280). The importance of the so-called\n\u201ctest of time\u201d is emphasized by Savile (1982) and Levinson\n(2002). Either way, the proposal has been criticized on the grounds\nthat it posits a viciously circular analysis of aesthetic value:\naesthetically superior artworks are those endorsed by true critics,\nbut true critics are identified by their endorsement of the best art.\nWhere earlier commentators tend to see circularity, as with Brown\n(1938) and Noxon (1961), more recent interpretations follow Kivy\n(1967) and see a regress problem. Circularity is avoided by\nidentifying good critics who satisfy the five criteria, but this\ngenerates new evaluative questions, for we must determine if their\nresponses are sufficiently delicate, grounded in the\nright comparisons, and so on. For further discussion, see\nCarroll (1984, pp. 189\u2013191), Gracyk (1994, pp. 175\u2013177),\nand Baceski (2013). Based on these problems, some readings of the\nessay reject the joint verdict of critics as Hume\u2019s standard.\nFor example, Costelloe (2007, pp. 2\u201314) argues that the\n\u201cgeneral rules of art\u201d are his actual standard.\n\nFurthermore, there is disagreement on the question of whether Hume\nholds that these true critics will be uniform in their verdicts.\nInterpretation of Hume\u2019s position is complicated by the way that\nhe consistently affirms his motivating insight, borrowed from\nHutcheson, that sentiment is the essence of evaluation. Even the worst\ncritic says nothing false in foolishly saying that one work is better\nthan another, however misguided their sentiment. Passages where even\nthe best critics will diverge in their evaluations are emphasized by\nWieand (1984), Savile (1993, pp. 70\u201371), and Mothersill (1997).\nMost notably, all critics have \u201cinnocent and unavoidable\u201d\npreferences (SOT, 281) and so they are better or worse at evaluating\ndifferent categories of art. Furthermore, these preferences change\nduring the lifetime of each critic. Consequently, the critical\njudgments of some critics will diverge from those of other highly\nqualified critics. But when critics\u2019 differences arise from\nunavoidable and \u201cblameless,\u201d preferences, there is no\ninterference of prejudice (SOT, 280). In short, the problem of finding\na standard of taste leads Hume to the problem of deciding which\ndisagreements are blameless, in order to distinguish them from\nprejudices that disqualify a sentiment as a public recommendation.\n\nThis reading of Hume is challenged by an interpretation that\nidentifies the standard of taste with ideal critics. (The phrase does\nnot appear in Hume.) That is, instead of real people who can guide us\ndespite their unavoidable and intransigent biases, Hume\u2019s true\ncritics are ideal or perfect evaluators. The case that Hume\u2019s\ncritics are ideal critics who never disagree is made by Shelley (1994,\n2003) and Costelloe (2007, pp. 17\u201318), and disputed in various\nways by Guyer (2005), Ross (2008), Galgut (2012), and\nDur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0 (2015).\n\nHume highlights only two sources that contribute to\n\u201cblameless,\u201d differences of sentiment among qualified\ncritics: basic dispositions of character, and moral differences\narising from cultural differences (SOT, 280). Today, we are more\nlikely to notice a third source of disagreement, Hume\u2019s\nrecognition that different objects reflect distinct species of beauty.\nBecoming a qualified judge of epic poetry does not contribute to being\na qualified judge of architecture. Addison is a better writer than\nJohn Locke, but the comparison assumes that they are both writing\nphilosophy (EHU, 7). We can compare John Milton and John Ogilby, and\nonly a false critic would rank Ogilby above Milton (SOT, 269). But it\nmakes no sense to compare Milton and Addison, for Milton is a poet,\nnot a philosopher.\n\nFurthermore, different cultures employ different customs when handling\nthe same artistic medium. \u201cYou will never convince a man, who is\nnot accustomed to Italian music, and has not an ear to follow its\nintricacies, that a Scotch tune is not preferable\u201d (S, 217). So\nthe good critic must overcome the challenge of cultural prejudice.\n\u201cA critic of a different age or nation, who should peruse this\ndiscourse, must have all these circumstances in his eye, and must\nplace himself in the same situation as the audience, in order to form\na true judgment of the oration\u201d (SOT, 276). Hume emphasizes the\ngreat difficulties involved in overcoming the prejudices of\none\u2019s time and place (SOT, 281\u201382).\n\nIn the wake of a post-Kantian tradition that endorses art\u2019s\nautonomy, many readers balk at Hume\u2019s strong endorsement of the\nrelevance moral judgment upon aesthetic evaluation (SOT,\n283\u201384). Hume discusses the moral failing of several plays (SOT,\n284) and of the Koran, considered as a literary\n\u201cperformance\u201d (SOT, 267). How can Hume reconcile this\nposition with his endorsement of Batteux\u2019s influential thesis,\nin which the mechanical arts are distinguished from fine art by the\nfact that the latter exists only to provide pleasure? (\u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d proceeds as if literature exists solely to provide the\npleasure of the experience.) But there is also a side of Hume that\nrefuses to distinguish between literature and other,\n\u201cpractical\u201d writing. Every work of art is evaluated\naccording to its distinctive purpose, with poetry alone singled out as\nhaving the purpose of \u201cpleasing\u201d the imagination (SOT,\n277). Ultimately, there is very little art that Hume might treat as\nart-for-art\u2019s-sake.\n\nThere should be no great surprise that Hume insists that moral\njudgments must sometimes enter into our aesthetic evaluations. (Good\nintroductions to Hume\u2019s view are provided by Mason (2001),\nDadlez (2002), and Winegar (2011).) Hume does not offer a sharp\ndistinction between moral and aesthetic taste. Evaluations that\nsubsequent aesthetic theories regard as a purely aesthetic are, for\nHume, concluding sentiments following numerous observations of\ncontributing strengths and weaknesses. When a work of art represents\nhuman activity, then Hume\u2019s account of moral evaluation requires\nthat moral sentiment accompany apprehension of the action. The\nfictional status of the work weakens our sympathetic response, but the\nmere sequence of ideas will be sufficient to produce weaker versions\nof the sentiments that one would have if one were faced with the\nactual events. Given Hume\u2019s moral theory, there is no\npossibility of suspending our moral response. Moral sentiments are\nnatural and immediate. At best, one can gain a better understanding of\nthe cultural context responsible for the work, so that one\u2019s\nmoral sentiments will not be negative through mere prejudice.\nHume\u2019s theory of sentiments requires that if we are going to\nhave an aesthetic evaluation of a play\u2019s plotting and language,\nthen we are also going to have a moral response to its display of\nvirtue and vice. Both must enter into our final sentiment of\napprobation or disapprobation.\n\nAlthough Hume emphasizes the variety of responses that different\ngroups and individuals have with the same works, some sources of\npreference are \u201cblameless\u201d (SOT, 280) and\n\u201cinnocent\u201d (SOT, 281). Despite myriad differences, there\nare two basic types of taste: vulgar taste and refined taste. Given\nhis thorough anti-realism about values, Hume cannot dismiss vulgar\ntaste as subjective and mistaken. Hume has a different strategy for\nrecommending refined taste as the more objective of the pair. Vulgar\ntaste is more idiosyncratic and capricious. Refined taste is more\nproperly rule-governed and stable. The two are equally subject to\n\u201crules,\u201d but the person of refined taste is better\ninformed about the material.\n\nHume\u2019s contrast of vulgar and refined taste parallels his\ngeneral treatment of the doxastic positions of the vulgar and the wise\n(T, 150; EHU, 110). Vulgar thinking is dominated by \u201cthe first\ninfluence of general rules\u201d upon the mind. Such rules are\ninstinctively but \u201crashly formed\u201d to regulate the\nimagination. If these rules are allowed to govern thought in the\nabsence of further reflection and refinement, the result is prejudice\ninstead of wisdom. (T, 146,150) The wise, in contrast, take care to\nsurvey the broadest possible range of experience, allowing a\n\u201csecond influence of general rules\u201d to supplant the first.\nIn this manner, the \u201ccapricious and uncertain\u201d ideas of\nthe vulgar give way to \u201cthe more general and authentic\noperations of the understanding\u201d and the superior judgments of\nthe wise (T, 150). As for the normative question of why the refined\njudgments of the wise are preferable to the rash prejudices of the\nvulgar, Hume is content that moral sense assigns approbation to the\n\u201coriginal instincts\u201d underlying moral and aesthetic taste\n(T, 619).\n\nHaving argued that we can overcome prejudice and make superior\nassessments of ordinary matters of fact, Hume imports his contrast of\nvulgarity and wisdom into his aesthetic theory. Sound understanding\nmakes inferences and arrives at a belief. Beliefs influence taste.\nAlthough a judgment of taste terminates in a reflective passion,\nrather than in a belief with a truth-value, taste employs operations\nof the imagination subject to rules internalized by the judging\nsubject. Consequently, the contrast between first and second\ninfluences of general rules applies as much to taste as to\n\u201cwisdom.\u201d Vulgar taste should betray the same degree of\ncapriciousness and prejudice as vulgar reasoning. Good taste, in\ncontrast, should be more stable, for it will display \u201ca certain\npoint of view\u201d appropriate to its object (SOT, 276). Refined\ntaste reflects what Hume elsewhere calls the \u201cmore\ngeneral\u201d view. As with moral response, good taste meets with\napprobation while a prejudiced taste \u201closes all credit and\nauthority\u201d (SOT, 277). However, as a matter of interpretation,\nHume\u2019s references to a requisite \u201cdelicacy of\nimagination\u201d (SOT, 272) complicate and obscure the account, for\nit is not clear what this delicacy is, nor how it contributes to a\nmore settled, general view. Recent explorations of this problem\ninclude Townsend (2001, pp. 204\u2013206), and Gracyk (2011).\n\nSo what are the rules of taste, over and above any rules or principles\ninvolved in sound judgment about the object of taste? Surprisingly,\nHume never offers a clear case of one. At least two proposals about\nsuch rules can be extracted from Hume\u2019s example of\nSancho\u2019s kin and the hogshead of wine, Hume\u2019s\n\u201cevidence\u201d that there are general rules of taste (SOT,\n272\u201373). On the one hand, it is tempting to read the rules as\nstrictly parallel with the empirical laws discussed in the\nTreatise and first Enquiry. If so, they are causal\nlaws specifying which properties and combinations of properties cause\nwhat kind and degree of pleasure. An example might be, \u201cAn\naftertaste of iron or leather reduces the pleasure taken in an\notherwise good wine.\u201d Unfortunately, such rules seem suitable\nonly for arriving at some probability about the likely effect of\ndrinking such wine. Applying such a rule may result in a belief about\nthe wine, but knowing the rule would not encourage the requisite\nsentiment. Where we can find them, rules of this sort are useful for\nseparating true from pretend critics, if only in allowing us to point\nout inconsistencies in critical response (SOT 273\u201374).\n\nBut general rules of taste have a second function. Even if rules\n\u201chad never been methodized\u201d (SOT, 273), their existence\nsupports the view that practice and comparison improves taste (SOT,\n275). Those with adequate experience of a particular art form will\nperceive cases with greater accuracy. The existence of rules gives\nreason to agree that practice heightens the subject\u2019s awareness\nof disruptive impressions (the taste of iron) and missing impressions\n(no fruity bouquet), resulting in a more reflective adjudication of\nthe whole experience. They will also direct the imagination to expect\nvarious combinations of properties in light of one\u2019s recognition\nthat it is a thing of a specific kind. Properly amended to reflect\nmental rather than bodily taste, the story of Sancho\u2019s kinsmen\nunderlies the whole argument of \u201cThe Standard of Taste.\u201d\nEven if the rule has not been formalized, the wine taster will operate\nas if reasoning from a rule (e.g., \u201csince this is red wine, it\nwill have a fruity bouquet but no hint of leather or iron\u201d). The\nexperienced reader or viewer will approach art with \u201cthe same\nexcellence of faculties which contributes to the improvement of\nreason\u201d (SOT, 278), discovering the true character of the object\nwithin \u201cthe disorder, in which they are presented\u201d (SOT,\n273).\n5. Hume\u2019s Essay on Tragedy\n\n\u201cOf Tragedy\u201d grapples with a very different set of\nproblems than \u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d The motivating\nissue in \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is that of unpleasant emotion as a\npositive feature of a work. Hume proposes to explain how \u201ca\nwell-written tragedy\u201d is pleasing when that pleasure appears to\ndepend on \u201csorrow, terror, anxiety,\u201d and other naturally\ndisagreeable emotions (OT, 258). Hume had visited this topic before,\nin the Treatise, where his account of the pleasure of tragedy\ninvokes pity and sympathy (T, 369). \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d replaces\nthis earlier account with a complex proposal about the mental workings\nof imagination in relation to our negative passions.\n\nOriginally published beside \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d in\nFour Dissertations, \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is a peculiar\nessay. Its direct engagement with Bernard de Fontenelle and the\nAbb\u00e9 Jean-Baptiste Dubos confirms Hume\u2019s acquaintance\nwith French aesthetics. Hume makes passing reference to catharsis in\nhis mention of spectator cries and sobs that \u201cgive vent to their\nsorrow\u201d (OT, 258), but there is no evidence of familiarity with\nAristotle\u2019s Poetics. On the whole, the essay says\nsurprisingly little about the nature of tragedy, and what it says is\ncombined with discussions of melodramas and historical writing. Its\nreal topic is the experience of conflicting emotions directed\nsimultaneously at a single object, a topic treated in the\nTreatise. Because the pleasure offered by tragedy and\nmelodrama depends on and is proportionate with their capacity to\narouse grief, fear, and other unpleasant passions, Hume uses\nliterature and theater as an occasion to elaborate on his theory of\nmixed emotions. As Hume formulates it, the problem is to explain the\nnature of the relationship between our approbation, which is\npleasurable, and the presence of \u201csorrow, terror,\nanxiety,\u201d and other naturally disagreeable emotions (OT, 258).\nThe solution, Hume claims, is that any emotion \u201cwhich attends a\npassion, is easily converted into it, though in their natures they be\noriginally different from, and even contrary to each other\u201d (T,\n419).\n\nAlthough published side by side, \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d and\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d may offer conflicting\ndoctrines. In the essay on taste, the unchallenged appearance of vice\nis treated as a flaw, and unpleasant emotion is a defect. But when\n\u201cOf Tragedy\u201d identifies a flaw in Nicholas Rowe\u2019s\nThe Ambitious Stepmother, the play\u2019s defect is not the\nendorsement of vice. Instead, its flaw is the staging of action that\nis \u201ctoo bloody and atrocious\u201d (OT, 264). But why is\n\u201cshocking\u201d spectacle a flaw that leads to general\ndisapprobation? Is it simply a question of the degree of shock? But\nwhy should that prevent the audiences from \u201cconverting\u201d\nthe shock into a \u201ccontrary\u201d and pleasurable experience, as\nHume claims happens with terror and anxiety? The obstacle does not\nseem to be moral in nature, of the sort explored in \u201cOf the\nStandard of Taste\u201d where Hume discusses a work\u2019s failure\nto direct proper disapprobation at vicious manners. The essay on taste\nsuggests that the same content would not be a flaw if proper\nadjustments were made. But \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d does not call\nattention to the moral dimension of Rowe\u2019s play. So \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d is a discourse on an interesting puzzle about human\npsychology, namely the fact that unpleasant elements can be either\nstrengths or ruinous defects. \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d says nothing\nabout moralism and art.\n\nHume\u2019s account of tragic pleasure has two components. First,\ndifferent features of the work must generate the viewer\u2019s\nagreeable and disagreeable responses. Disagreeable aspects contribute\nto our general approbation because those properties are balanced by\nnaturally agreeable properties. Second, a general psychological\nprinciple explains how it is possible for competing emotions to\nproduce a complex, pleasing sentiment. Borrowed from the\nTreatise (T, 419), that principle holds that when the same\nobject produces different passions, even those \u201cof a contrary\nnature,\u201d then the subordinate passion can be\n\u201cconverted\u201d into the predominant (OT, 262). \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d combines these two ideas. Our natural delight in\n\u201cimitation\u201d provides a strong and predominant passion. The\nnaturally disagreeable emotions aroused by the plot provide a\nsubordinate and contrary emotion, the \u201cmovement\u201d of which\n\u201cfortifies\u201d the predominant passion. Unless the negative\nemotion becomes predominant, the overall effect of a well-written\ntragedy will be an audience \u201cpleased in proportion as they are\nafflicted\u201d (OT 258). The details of Hume\u2019s theory are\nexplored by Cohen (1962), Budd (1991), Neill (1992, 1999), and Dadlez\n(2004, 2016).\n\nAlthough Hume illustrates his general principle with numerous\nexamples, few of his contemporaries or modern interpreters endorse his\ntheory. A rare exception is Galgut (2001). Famously, the theory faces\nmultiple objections. It offers no working definition of tragedy and\nits examples are not, for the most part, genuine tragedies, points\nnoted by Neill (1999). The details of Hume\u2019s examples raise\nfurther issues. For example, Hume thinks it is obvious that\nRowe\u2019s play fails due to its gory and shocking spectacle, which\ntips the balance in the wrong direction. But the obvious reply is that\nmany viewers enjoy the spectacle of violence. Hume basically says so:\n\u201cThe English theatre abounds too much with such shocking\nimages\u201d (OT, 265). How can Hume contend that the play is ruined\nwhen so many viewers enjoy it? For there is no appeal except to\nsentiment.\n\nPerhaps Hume thinks that shocking spectacle satisfies vulgar taste but\nnot refined taste. \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d posits\ndifferences in audience members to account for different responses.\nHume\u2019s sketchy theory in \u201cOf Tragedy\u201d is compatible\nwith most people enjoying aesthetically uninteresting works, for\nroutine design readily delights most people (SOT, 276). But a refined\ntaste is equally sensitive to all facets of the work, including formal\ndesign. Just as the wine tasted funny to Sancho\u2019s kinsmen (SOT,\n272\u201373), a run-of-the-mill work \u201cgives pain\u201d to true\ncritics (SOT, 276). Only the best critics worry about the absence of\ngenius.\n\nThe rules of taste endorsed in \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d\nfacilitate habituated expectations based on previous experiences with\nsimilar art. Aesthetic pleasure frequently depends on\n\u201ccustom\u201d (T, 299) and on associations and expectations\ndeveloped by the life experiences of the intended audience. If\naudience expectations are violated by excessive violence, and if there\nis no compensating reward for its inclusion, then the work has been\nimproperly staged for its intended audience. But works that merely\nsatisfy expectations will please the less discerning critics. Hence\n\u201cshocking images\u201d that are routine in English theater will\nplease the audience. The same gory spectacle and \u201cdismal\u201d\nstories, insufficiently \u201csoftened\u201d by genius and\neloquence, will displease a refined taste (OT, 265).\n\nUnfortunately, this interpretation merely heightens the problem. What\nis it that rewards vulgar taste? Why does violent spectacle attract\nanyone to routine, predictable potboilers? Natural sympathy should\narouse uneasiness at the gory spectacle, yet the vulgar have no\ncompensating reward. Brilliant language is surely an attraction of\nShakespeare\u2019s Othello, but no such achievement is to be\nfound in most of the popular fiction that reliably delights its\naudience. Hume even implies that the vulgar do not attend to\n\u201celoquence\u201d and similar formal achievement. However, the\nmere fact of \u201cimitation\u201d seems insufficient to explain the\npredominant pleasure in the face of this material. Is it the\nspectacle\u2019s \u201cexactness of imitation\u201d (SOT, 276)? But\nthat would seem to be a compensating pleasure in all but the most\ninept production, and would lead us to expect that vulgar audiences\nwould respond with equal pleasure to almost any inferior work that\nmeets their expectations. But this is simply not the case. \u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d does not meet the standards of argument and insight set\nby Hume\u2019s other contributions to aesthetics.\n",
