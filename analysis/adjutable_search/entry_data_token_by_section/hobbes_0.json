    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nThomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588. His home town was Malmesbury,\nwhich is in Wiltshire, England, about 30 miles east of Bristol. Very\nlittle is known about Hobbes\u2019s mother. His father, also called\nThomas Hobbes, was a somewhat disreputable local clergyman.\nHobbes\u2019s seventeenth-century biographer John Aubrey tells the\nstory of how \u201cThe old vicar Hobs was a good fellow and had been\nat cards Saturday all night, and at church in his sleep he cries out\n\u2018Trafells is troumps\u2019\u201d [i.e., clubs are trumps]\n(Aubrey 1696, 1.387). The older Thomas Hobbes eventually (in 1604)\nleft Malmesbury, when a dispute with another clergyman, Richard Jeane,\nescalated to the point of a fight in a churchyard. In Aubrey\u2019s\nwords: \u201cHobs stroke him and was forced to fly for it\u201d\n(Aubrey 1696, 1.387).\n\nBy that point the future philosopher Hobbes had himself left\nMalmesbury (in 1602 or 1603), in order to study at Magdalene Hall,\nOxford. His studies there were supported by his uncle, Francis Hobbes,\nwho was a glover. After graduating from Oxford in February 1608,\nHobbes went to work for the Cavendish family, initially as a tutor to\nWilliam Cavendish (1590\u20131628), who later became the second earl\nof Devonshire. Hobbes would work for the same family most of the rest\nof his\n life.[1]\n His work for the Cavendish family is part of what allowed Hobbes to\nthink and write as he did: it gave him access to books, and\nconnections to other philosophers and scientists.\n\nHobbes\u2019s first notable philosophical works are from around 1640.\nBefore then he had, significantly, published in 1629 a translation of\nThucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War into\nEnglish. Hobbes had also interacted with various prominent\nintellectual figures. On a trip around Europe in the mid-1630s, Hobbes\nmet Marin Mersenne in Paris. Aubrey claims that \u201cWhen he\n[Hobbes] was at Florence \u2026 he contracted a friendship with the\nfamous Galileo Galilei\u201d (Aubrey 1696, 1.366), although\ncuriously Hobbes\u2019s autobiographical writings do not mention\nthis, though they do mention meeting Mersenne. Earlier on, around\n1620, Hobbes worked for some time as a secretary to Francis Bacon.\n\nHobbes first made a notable impact with philosophical writings in the\nearly 1640s. These included his Elements of Law and De\nCive. The Elements of Law, which Hobbes circulated in\n1640, is the first work in which Hobbes follows his typical systematic\npattern of starting with the workings of the mind and language, and\ndeveloping the discussion towards political matters. De Cive\n(1642) was Hobbes\u2019s first published book of political\nphilosophy. This work focuses more narrowly on the political: its\nthree main sections are titled \u201cLiberty\u201d,\n\u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cReligion\u201d. However, De\nCive was conceived as part of a larger work, the Elements of\nPhilosophy. That work eventually had three parts: De\nCorpore (1655), De Homine (1658), and De Cive\nitself. De Corpore, which is discussed below, covers issues\nof logic, language, method, metaphysics, mathematics, and physics.\nDe Homine, meanwhile, focuses on matters of physiology and\noptics.\n\nAt this time Hobbes also had a series of interactions with Descartes.\nIn 1640 Hobbes sent to Mersenne a set of comments on Descartes\u2019s\nDiscourse and Optics. Descartes saw some of this,\nand sent a letter to Mersenne in response, to which Hobbes also\nresponded. Then in 1641 Hobbes\u2019s objections were among those\npublished along with Descartes\u2019s Meditations. In these\nexchanges and elsewhere, the attitudes of Hobbes and Descartes to one\nanother involved a curious mixture of respect and dismissal. On the\none occasion they are said to have met, in 1648, they did not get\nalong well (Martinich 1999, 171). In earlier letters, Descartes\nsuggested that Hobbes was more accomplished in moral philosophy than\nelsewhere, but also that he had wicked views there (Descartes 1643,\n3.230\u20131). Descartes also worried that Hobbes was \u201caiming\nto make his reputation at my expense, and by devious means\u201d\n(Descartes 1641b, 100). Aubrey reports that the two \u201cmutually\nrespected one another\u201d, but also that Hobbes thought that\nDescartes would have been better off sticking to geometry (Aubrey\n1696, 1.367).\n\nHobbes spent the next decade in exile in Paris, leaving England late\nin 1640, and not returning until 1651. His exile was related to the\ncivil wars of the time. Hobbes was associated with the royalist side,\nand might also have had reason to fear punishment because of his\ndefence of absolute sovereignty in his political philosophy. During\nhis time in France, Hobbes continued to associate with Mersenne and\nhis circle, including Pierre Gassendi, who seems to have been a\nparticular friend of Hobbes\u2019s. Late in his time in France,\nHobbes wrote Leviathan, which was published in 1651. Its\nstructure is somewhat similar to that of the Elements of Law,\nthough it also contains lengthy discussions of matters of scriptural\ninterpretation, and it is probably the most overtly polemical of\nHobbes\u2019s major works.\n\nAfter his return to England in 1651, Hobbes continued to publish\nphilosophical works for several years. De Corpore was\npublished in 1655, and provides Hobbes\u2019s main statements on\nseveral topics, such as method and the workings of language. De\nHomine was published in 1658, completing the plan of the\nElements of Philosophy. In later years Hobbes defended his\nwork in a series of extended debates. These included debates with John\nWallis and Seth Ward that centred on Hobbes\u2019s alleged squaring\nof the circle (Jesseph 1999), debates with John Bramhall about liberty\nand necessity (Jackson 2007), and debates with Robert Boyle about the\nexperimental physics of the Royal Society (Shapin & Schaffer\n1989). He also published a Latin edition of Leviathan in\n1668, in which there were some significant changes and additions\nrelating to controversial topics, such as his treatments of the\nTrinity and the nature of God. But Hobbes\u2019s attention was not on\nphilosophy alone. Indeed, in the 1670s he published translations of\nthe Odyssey and Iliad. And in the late 1660s he\nwrote a history of the civil wars, Behemoth; or, The Long\nParliament, which was published posthumously (Hobbes 1668a).\n\nHobbes died on 4 December 1679 at Hardwick Hall, one of the homes of\nthe Cavendish family, with whom he was still associated after seventy\nyears.\n",
