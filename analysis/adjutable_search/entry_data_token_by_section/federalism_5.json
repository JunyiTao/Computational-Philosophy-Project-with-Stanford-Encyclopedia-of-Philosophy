Since cooperation in some areas can \u2018spill\nover\u2019 and create demands for further coordination in other\nsectors, federations often exhibit creeping centralisation. Note that\nseveral of these objectives require getting the allocation of\ncompetences and veto points right within the federal order. For some\ncomplex common objectives such as environmental problems, federal\nfeatures otherwise risk becoming part of the problem (Adler 2005,\nDalmazzone 2006).\n\n\nFederations may foster peace, in the senses of preventing wars and\npreventing fears of war, in several ways. States can join a\n(con)federation to become jointly powerful enough to dissuade external\naggressors, and/or to prevent aggressive and preemptive wars among\nthemselves. The European federalists Altieri Spinelli, Ernesto Rossi\nand Eugenio Colorni argued the latter in the 1941 Ventotene Manifesto:\nOnly a European federation could prevent war between totalitarian,\naggressive states. Such arguments assume, of course, that the\n(con)federation will not become more aggressive than each state\nseparately, a point Mill argued. \n\n\nFederations can promote economic prosperity by removing\ninternal barriers to trade, through economies of scale, by\nestablishing and maintaining inter-member unit trade agreements, or by\nbecoming a sufficiently large global player to affect international\ntrade regimes (for the latter regarding the EU, cf. Keohane and Nye\n2001, 260). \n\n\nFederal arrangements may protect individuals against political\nauthorities by constraining state sovereignty, placing some powers\nwith the center. By entrusting the center with authority to intervene\nin member units, the federal arrangements can protect\nminorities\u2019 human rights against member unit authorities\n(Federalist, Watts 1999). Such arguments assume, of course, that abuse\nby the center is less likely. \n\n\nFederal arrangements may enhance the political influence of\nformerly sovereign governments, both by facilitating coordination,\nand\u2014particularly for small states\u2014by giving these member\nunits influence or even veto over policy making, rather than remaining\nmere policy takers. \n\n\nFederal political orders can be preferred as the appropriate form of\nnested organizations, for instance in \u2018organic\u2019\nconceptions of the political and social order. The federation may\npromote cooperation, justice or other values among and within member\nunits as well as among and within their constituent units, for\ninstance by monitoring, legislating, enforcing or funding agreements,\nhuman rights, immunity from interference, or development. Starting\nwith the family, each larger unit responsible for facilitating the\nflourishing of member units and securing common goods beyond their\nreach without a common authority. Such arguments have been offered by\nsuch otherwise divergent authors as Althusius, the Catholic traditions\nof subsidiarity as expressed by popes Leo XIII (1891) and Pius XI\n(1931), and Proudhon. \n\n",
