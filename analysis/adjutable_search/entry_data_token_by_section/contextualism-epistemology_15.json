    "main_text": "Further Arguments for EC, with some Non-Contextualist Responses || Knowledge and Assertion\n5.2 Knowledge and Assertion\nA number of philosophers have found very plausible the idea that, in asserting that p, one represents oneself as knowing that p.[23] Here, very quickly, is one route to this idea: If our talk is governed by \u2018the Cooperative Principle\u2019 (CP), then \u2018saying\u2019 itself presumes one\u2019s striving to fulfill certain credal-epistemic conditions: chief among the Gricean maxims is that of Quality, \u2018Try to make your contribution one that is true,\u2019 along with its two more specific sub-maxims:\n\n\u2018Do not say what you believe to be false;\u2019 and\n\u2018Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\u2019 (Grice 1989, 27)\n\nNow notice that the properties addressed by Quality and its sub-maxims closely approximate what are generally taken to be the central conditions on knowing (so long as we are open-minded as to how to read ii\u2014such that, e.g., \u2018justification\u2019 could be substituted for \u2018evidence\u2019). So it seems that, if one is striving to conform to CP, one will assert something only if one takes oneself to know it.\nAccording to some, much the same idea can be expressed by saying that knowledge is \u201cthe norm of assertion\u201d. Thus, Timothy Williamson (2000, Chapter 11) defends at length what is come to be known as \u2018the knowledge account of assertion,\u2019 whereby our linguistic practices are governed by the rule: \u201cOne must: assert p only if one knows p\u201d (2000, 243)\nKeith DeRose, taking the two ideas just expressed to be \u201cjust two sides of the same coin\u201d (2002, 180; 2009, 93), argues that, if the knowledge account of assertion is correct, it furnishes a different sort of argument for EC, which is summarized as follows:\nIf the standards for when one is in a position to warrantedly assert that P are the same as those that constitute a truth condition for \u2018I know that P,\u2019 then if the former vary with context, so do the latter. In short: The knowledge account of assertion together with the context sensitivity of assertability\u2026 yields contextualism about knowledge. (2002, 187; see 2009, 106)\nSeveral objections to this argument have been made. First, it is worth considering whether one couldn\u2019t accept the idea, for reasons such as those outlined above, that in asserting one represents oneself as knowing, while not accepting the knowledge rule. According to Matt Weiner (2005), for instance, the knowledge rule is too strong, and the cases which motivate it can be handled by assuming the rule that proper assertions be true, along with conversational norms governing all speech acts. (Other accounts on which proper assertion requires something weaker than knowledge include Bach 2008, Douven 2006, Lackey 2007, and McKinnon 2015.) Second, Adam Leite (2007) argues that the direct argument for EC from the knowledge account of assertion rests on an equivocation on the notion of \u2018warranted assertability\u2019. (See too Bach 2005, 73\u20134, who also suggests that DeRose\u2019s argument relies too heavily on first-person \u201cknowledge\u201d claims). In a similar spirit, John Turri\u2019s \u201cspeech act contextualism\u201d (2010) is expressly designed to show how the knowledge account of assertion is compatible with Epistemic Invariantism. Finally, Thomas Blackson (2004) argues, as Williamson (2005a, 111, n. 20) suggests, that DeRose\u2019s argument does not favor EC over another recent view, Subject Sensitive Invariantism (see Section 6). Independently of EC, the relation between knowledge and assertion has been the subject of much recent discussion (see Pagin 2016, Section 6.2).\n",
