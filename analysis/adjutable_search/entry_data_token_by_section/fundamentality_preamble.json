    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of fundamentality, as it is used in metaphysics, aims to\ncapture the idea that there is something basic or primitive in the\nworld. This metaphysical notion is related to the vernacular use of\n\u201cfundamental\u201d, but philosophers have also put forward\nvarious technical definitions of the notion. Among the most\ninfluential of these is the definition of absolute\nfundamentality in terms of ontological independence or\nungroundedness. Accordingly, the notion of fundamentality is\noften associated with these two other technical notions, covered under\n ontological dependence\n and\n metaphysical grounding\n in this encyclopedia.\n\nWhy are philosophers interested in fundamentality? One reason comes\nfrom a certain view of science. It is not uncommon to think that\nparticle physics has some special role in our inquiry into the\nstructure of reality. After all, every material entity is made up of\nfundamental particles. So, one might think that particle physics aims\nto describe the fundamental level of reality, which contains\nthe basic building blocks of nature. We can then employ the notion of\nrelative fundamentality, which enables us to express the\nhierarchical nature of reality disclosed by science, according to\nwhich the facts of biochemistry depend on the facts of elementary\nchemistry, which depend in turn on the allegedly fundamental facts of\nfundamental particle physics.\n\nThe thought that this priority ordering terminates at the fundamental\nlevel is often expressed with the notion of well-foundedness.\nThe view that reality is well-founded in the relevant sense is called\nmetaphysical foundationalism, in contrast with\nmetaphysical infinitism. A further option, which undermines\nthe priority ordering and suggests that dependence chains can form\nloops, is called metaphysical coherentism.\n\nWe can identify two key tasks for the notion of fundamentality. The\nfirst is to capture the idea that there is a foundation of being,\nwhich consists of independent entities. The second is to\ncapture the idea that the fundamental entities constitute a\ncomplete basis that all else depends on. These tasks are\nrelated. In fact, the first would seem to require the second, but not\nthe other way around. We will see that prioritizing one or the other\nof these tasks may result in different accounts of fundamentality. The\nsecond task may be applied to relative fundamentality and used to\nexpress the idea that there is a hierarchy of being whereby some\nentities are more fundamental than others, although strictly speaking\nthis hierarchical picture is independent of the notion of a complete\nbasis.\n\nThis entry will focus on the contemporary discussion, but many of the\nideas debated in the contemporary literature have been around for\nmillennia. We now have the tools to make these important ideas much\nmore precise. Relevant historical issues include ancient atomism\n(e.g., Leucippus and Democritus, see the separate entry on\n ancient atomism),\n Aristotle\u2019s many discussions of priority (see, e.g., Peramatzis\n2011 and the articles in Sirkel & Tahko 2014), Aquinas\u2019s\ndiscussion of the first cause (see the entry on the\n cosmological argument\n and Oberle 2022b), the\n principle of sufficient reason,\n as discussed by Spinoza and Leibniz, among others, and\nBolzano\u2019s work as a precursor to some contemporary work on\nmetaphysical grounding and related notions (see Roski and Schnieder\n2019 and Schnieder 2020a).\n",
