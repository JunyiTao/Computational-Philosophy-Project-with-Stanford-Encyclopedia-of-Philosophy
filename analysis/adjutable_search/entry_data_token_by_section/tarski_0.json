    "main_text": "Biographical sketch\n1. Biographical sketch\n\nTarski was born on January 14, 1901 in Warsaw, then a part of the\nRussian Empire. His family name at birth was Tajtelbaum, changed to\nTarski in 1923. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Warsaw from 1918 to 1924, taking courses with\nKotarbi\u0144ski, Le\u015bniewski, \u0141ukasiewicz, Mazurkiewicz and\nSierpi\u0144ski among others. (See Lvov-Warsaw School.) He got a\ndoctoral degree, under Le\u015bniewski\u2019s supervision, in 1924.\nFrom then until 1939 he taught mathematics at a high school and held\nminor teaching positions at the University of Warsaw. In this period\nhe published prolifically on logic and set theory, building a strong\ninternational reputation for himself. Yet he failed in his attempt to\nobtain a professorship at the University of Lvov (now Lviv) in 1939.\nIn 1929 he married Maria Witkowska, with whom he soon had two\nchildren, Ina and Jan.\n\nIn August 1939 Tarski traveled to the United States to attend a\ncongress of the Unity of Science movement (see Vienna Circle). World\nWar II broke out soon after that, leaving Tarski no option but to stay\nin the States. He spent the war years separated from his family,\nforced to remain in Poland. In this period he held several temporary\nuniversity positions, at Harvard University, the City College of New\nYork, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, where he was eventually given\ntenure in 1945 and a professorship in mathematics in 1948. Maria, Ina\nand Jan were able to join him in Berkeley in 1946.\n\nIn Berkeley Tarski built a prominent school of research in logic and\nthe foundations of mathematics and science, centered around the\nprestigious graduate program in logic and methodology of science,\nwhich he was also instrumental in creating. He received many academic\nhonors, such as the membership in the National Academy of Sciences of\nthe USA and the election as Corresponding Fellow of the British\nAcademy. Tarski remained affiliated to Berkeley until his death, on\nOctober 27, 1983.\n",
