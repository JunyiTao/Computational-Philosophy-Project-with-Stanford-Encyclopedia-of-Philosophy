    "main_text": "Human Nature and the Person || The Single Self Model\n4.4 The Single Self Model\n\nXu Fuguan took a simpler approach to the question of knowing human\nnature and the source of values. He felt that the model of Western\nmetaphysics should not be applied to Chinese philosophy, so he\nrejected the metaphysical orientation of Xiong, Mou, and Tang (Huang\n2018 [2019: 56\u201357]; Ni 2002: 291). He did not distinguish two\nlevels of self as Tang and Mou did. He refers to morality as\nsupra-empirical (chao jingyan \u8d85\u7d93\u9a57) (Xu\n1963 [1990: 86]), but not transcendental or metaphysical. He agreed\nthat moral facts cannot be uncovered by investigation of the external\nworld. However, Xu denies that Confucian is a form of idealism, or\nthat the heart-mind is something beyond the physiology of the body (Ni\n2002: 286\u201387). Xu refers to his view as \u201cembodied\nlearning\u201d (xing er zhong xue\n\u5f62\u800c\u4e2d\u5b78) rather than metaphysics (xing er\nshang xue \u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u5b78) (Xu 1953 [2022:\n168]). He agrees with Tang and Mou that we have inherent moral\nresponses, but they are not indications of a transcendental self. He\ndoes not seem very concerned with pinning down precisely where the\nmoral responses come from; the reality of experiencing them is\nenough.\n\nAt the same time, Xu insists that morality cannot be known through\ninvestigation of world: science cannot confirm or disprove morality.\nAlthough he rarely mentioned Kant, he did apparently accept that\nmorality could not be empirical if it were to be universal (Xu 1963\n[1990: 86]). What defines human beings is that they can control their\ndesires and they have the capacity for self-mastery (zizhu\n\u81ea\u4e3b) (Xu 1963 [1990: 161, 165\u201366]). He\ndistinguishes two categories of motives. There are the physiological\ndesires associated with the body, and there are the responses of the\nheart-mind (Elstein 2021a: 205). In Mengzi\u2019s paradigm case of\nseeing a child about to fall into a well, the feeling of alarm and\ncompassion is not a response of the desires, but the direct\nmanifesting of the heart-mind (Xu 1963 [1990: 172]). Unfortunately, he\nnever explained how we discern the difference between desires and the\nmoral responses of the heart-mind, when it seems these can be easily\nconfused.\n\nPerhaps the most reliable guide is to look at what we prefer from\nothers. Xu believes, following Mengzi, that people have a universal\npreference for virtue. But when we look at ourselves, we all too\nreadily rationalize desires as moral responses or make excuses for our\nconduct. Xu instead looks at what people prefer in others, especially\nin rulers. This is what makes the Confucian ideal of rule by virtue\npossible: the fact that people respond to the virtue of rulers and\nprefer humane rule (Xu 1966 [2022: 244\u201345]). The suggestion is\nthat we can avoid the complications of self-interest better by looking\nnot at what people do or what they want to do, but what they expect\nand want from other people. Xu does not go as far as to suggest a\nuniversalizing test (as Tang Junyi did), but he did say, \u201cThe\nWay is what is accepted by each person, or slightly different, what\neveryone accepts from a position of equality\u201d (Xu 1954 [2022:\n181]). It is not a great leap from here to a universalizing test to\ndistinguish moral and immoral (or amoral) motives.\n\nWe find in these thinkers a characteristic not only of modern\nConfucianism, but most Confucianism. They are not very concerned with\ndefining or determining what is good or right (which they believe is\nusually obvious) or with offering a decision procedure. Even Mou\nZongsan, who said ethics must be based on a categorical imperative\n(MZCW 20: 447), did not discuss how to apply it in practice. Their\nmain concern is to show that morality is part of human nature, and to\ndemonstrate how we can know this. Humans are fundamentally moral\nbeings for them, and so moral practice is a matter of accessing or\ndeveloping what we already have in us. Ideally, skill in moral\npractice should get a point of being effortless. There is no necessary\nconflict between reason and inclination, between what one desires and\nwhat is right. The ideal of the sage, who knows and does what is right\nwithout thought or effort, remained real in modern Confucian thought,\neven if they also recognized that it was a distant goal (TJCW 26:\n2.216\u201317). The goal is to reveal what persons are, such that\nmoral practice is part of who we are and becoming a sage is at least a\npossibility.\n",
