    "main_text": "Simulation Theory and Theory-Theory || The Theory-Theory\n5.1 The Theory-Theory\n\nAs suggested by its name, the Theory-Theory proposes that mindreading\nis grounded by the possession of a Theory of Mind (\u201ca folk\npsychology\u201d)\u2014i.e., it is based on the tacit knowledge of\nthe following body of information: a number of \u201cfolk\u201d laws\nor principles connecting mental states with sensory stimuli,\nbehavioural responses, and other mental states. Here are a couple of\nputative examples:\n\n\nLaw of sight: If S is in front of object O,\nS directs her eye-gaze to O, S\u2019s visual\nsystem is properly functioning, and the environmental conditions are\noptimal, then ceteris paribus S will see O.\n\nLaw of the practical syllogism: If S desires a certain\noutcome G and S believes that by performing a certain\naction A she will obtain G, then ceteris\nparibus S will decide to perform A.\n\n\nThe main divide among Theory-Theorists concerns how the Theory of Mind\nis acquired\u2014i.e., it concerns where this body of knowledge comes\nfrom. According to the Child-Scientist Theory-Theory (Gopnik &\nWellman 1992; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997), a child constructs a Theory\nof Mind exactly as a scientist constructs a scientific theory: she\ncollects evidence, formulates explanatory hypotheses, and revises\nthese hypotheses in the light of further evidence. In other words,\n\u201cfolk\u201d laws and principles are obtained through hypothesis\ntesting and revision\u2014a process that, according to proponents of\nthis view, is guided by a general-purpose, Bayesian learning mechanism\n(Gopnik & Wellman 2012). On the contrary, the Nativist\nTheory-Theory (Carruthers 2013; Scholl & Leslie 1999) argues that\na significant part of the Theory of Mind is innate, rather than\nlearned. More precisely, Nativists typically consider the core of the\nTheory of Mind as resulting from the maturation of a cognitive module\nspecifically dedicated to representing mental states\n\nThese disagreements notwithstanding, the main tenet of TT is clear\nenough: attributions of mental states to other people are guided by\nthe possession of a Theory of Mind. For example, if I know that you\ndesire to buy a copy of The New York Times and I know that\nyou believe that if you go to News & Booze you can buy a\ncopy, then I can use the Law of the Practical Syllogism to\ninfer that you will decide to go to News & Booze.\n\nTT has been so popular among philosophers and cognitive scientists\nthat the explanation it proposes has ended up being the name of the\nvery phenomenon to be explained: on many occasions, scholars use the\nexpression \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d as a synonym of\n\u201cmindreading\u201d. Simulation Theorists, however, have never\nbeen particularly impressed by this. According to them, there is\nno need to invoke the tacit knowledge of a Theory of Mind to\naccount for mindreading, since a more parsimonious\nexplanation is available: we reuse our own cognitive\nmechanisms to mentally simulate others\u2019 mental states. For\nexample, why do I need to know the Law of the Practical\nSyllogism, if I can employ my own decision-making mechanism\n(which I have anyway) to simulate your decision? It is\nuneconomical\u2014Simulation Theorists say\u2014to resort\nto an information-rich strategy, if an information-poor strategy will\ndo equally as well.\n\nThe difference between TT and ST can be further illustrated through a\nnice example given by Stich and Nichols (1992). Suppose that you want\nto predict the behavior of an airplane in certain atmospheric\nconditions. You can collect the specifications of the airplane and\ninfer, on the basis of aerodynamic theory, how the airplane\nwill behave. Alternatively, you can build a model of the airplane and\nrun a simulation. The former scenario approximates the way in\nwhich TT describes our capacity to represent others\u2019 mental\nstates, while the latter approximates ST. Two points need to be\nstressed, though. First, while knowledge of aerodynamic theory is\nexplicit, TT says that our knowledge of the Theory of Mind is\ntypically implicit (or tacit). That is, someone who knows\naerodynamic theory is aware of the theory\u2019s laws and\nprinciples and is able to report them correctly, while the laws and\nprinciples constituting one\u2019s Theory of Mind typically lie\noutside awareness and reportability. Second, when we run a simulation\nof someone else\u2019s mental states, we do not need to build a\nmodel: we are the model\u2014that is, we use our own\nmind as a model of others\u2019 minds.\n\nSimulation Theorists maintain that the default state for the\n\u201cmodel\u201d is one in which the simulator simply makes no\nadjustments when simulating another individual. That is, ST has it\nthat we are automatically disposed to attribute to a target mental\nstates no different from our own current states. This would often\nserve adequately in social interaction between people who are\ncooperating or competing in what is for practical purposes the same\nsituation. We tend to depart from this default when we perceive\nrelevant differences between others\u2019 situations and our own. In\nsuch cases, we might find ourselves adjusting for situational\ndifferences by putting ourselves imaginatively in what we consider the\nother\u2019s situation to be.\n\nWe might also make adjustments for individual differences. An\nacquaintance will soon be choosing between candidate a and\ncandidate b in an upcoming election. To us, projecting\nourselves imaginatively into that voting situation, the choice is\nglaringly obvious: candidate a, by any reasonable criteria.\nBut then we may wonder whether this imaginative projection into the\nvoting situation adequately represents our acquaintance in\nthat situation. We might recall things the person has said, or\npeculiarities of dress style, diet, or entertainment, that might seem\nrelevant. Internalizing such behavior ourselves, trying to \u201cget\nbehind\u201d it as an actor might get behind a scripted role, we\nmight then put, as it were, a different person into the voting\nsituation, one who might choose candidate b.\n\nSuch a transformation would require quarantining some of our own\nmental states, preferences, and dispositions, inhibiting them so that\nthey do not contaminate our off-line decision-making in the role of\nthe other. Such inhibition of one's own mental states would be\ncognitively demanding. For that reason, ST predicts that mindreading\nwill be subject to egocentric errors\u2014that is, it\npredicts that we will often attribute to a target the mental state\nthat we would have if we were in the target\u2019s situation, rather\nthan the state the target is actually in (Goldman 2006). In\n section 6.2,\n we shall discuss whether this prediction is borne out by the\ndata.\n",
