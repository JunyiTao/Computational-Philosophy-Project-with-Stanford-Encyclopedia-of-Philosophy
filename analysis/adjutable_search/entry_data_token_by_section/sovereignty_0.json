    "main_text": "A Definition of Sovereignty\n1. A Definition of Sovereignty\n\nIn his classic, The King\u2019s Two Bodies (1957),\nmedievalist Ernst Kantorowicz describes a profound transformation in\nthe concept of political authority over the course of the Middle Ages.\nThe change began when the concept of the body of Christ evolved into a\nnotion of two bodies \u2014 one, the corpus naturale, the\nconsecrated host on the altar, the other, the corpus\nmysticum, the social body of the church with its attendant\nadministrative structure. This latter notion \u2014 of a collective\nsocial organization having an enduring, mystical essence \u2014 would\ncome to be transferred to political entities, the body politic.\nKantorowicz then describes the emergence, in the late Middle Ages, of\nthe concept of the king\u2019s two bodies, vivified in\nShakespeare\u2019s Richard II and applicable to the early modern body\npolitic. Whereas the king\u2019s natural, mortal body would pass away\nwith his death, he was also thought to have an enduring, supernatural\none that could not be destroyed, even by assassination, for it\nrepresented the mystical dignity and justice of the body politic. The\nmodern polity that emerged dominant in early modern Europe manifested\nthe qualities of the collectivity that Kantorowicz described \u2014 a\nsingle, unified one, confined within territorial borders, possessing a\nsingle set of interests, ruled by an authority that was bundled into a\nsingle entity and held supremacy in advancing the interests of the\npolity. Though in early modern times, kings would hold this authority,\nlater practitioners of it would include the people ruling through a\nconstitution, nations, the Communist Party, dictators, juntas, and\ntheocracies. The modern polity is known as the state, and the\nfundamental characteristic of authority within it, sovereignty.\n\nThe evolution that Kantorowicz described is formative, for sovereignty\nis a signature feature of modern politics. Some scholars have doubted\nwhether a stable, essential notion of sovereignty exists. But there is\nin fact a definition that captures what sovereignty came to mean in\nearly modern Europe and of which most subsequent definitions are a\nvariant: supreme authority within a territory. This is the\nquality that early modern states possessed, but which popes, emperors,\nkings, bishops, and most nobles and vassals during the Middle Ages\nlacked.\n\nEach component of this definition highlights an important aspect of\nthe concept. First, a holder of sovereignty possesses authority. That\nis to say, the person or entity does not merely wield coercive power,\ndefined as A\u2019s ability to cause B to do what\nhe would otherwise not do. Authority is rather what philosopher R.P.\nWolff proposed: \u201cthe right to command and correlatively the\nright to be obeyed\u201d (Wolff, 1990, 20). What is most important\nhere is the term \u201cright,\u201d connoting legitimacy. A holder\nof sovereignty derives authority from some mutually acknowledged\nsource of legitimacy \u2014 natural law, a divine mandate, hereditary\nlaw, a constitution, even international law. In the contemporary era,\nsome body of law is ubiquitously the source of sovereignty.\n\nBut if sovereignty is a matter of authority, it is not a matter of\nmere authority, but of supreme authority. Supremacy is what makes the\nconstitution of the United States superior to the government of\nPennsylvania, or any holder of sovereignty different from a police\nchief or corporate executive. The holder of sovereignty is superior to\nall authorities under its purview. Supremacy, too, is endemic to\nmodernity. During the Middle Ages, manifold authorities held some sort\nof legal warrant for their authority, whether feudal, canonical, or\notherwise, but very rarely did such warrant confer supremacy.\n\nA final ingredient of sovereignty is territoriality, also a feature of\npolitical authority in modernity. Territoriality is a principle by\nwhich members of a community are to be defined. It specifies that\ntheir membership derives from their residence within borders. It is a\npowerful principle, for it defines membership in a way that may not\ncorrespond with identity. The borders of a sovereign state may not at\nall circumscribe a \u201cpeople\u201d or a \u201cnation,\u201d and\nmay in fact encompass several of these identities, as national\nself-determination and irredentist movements make evident. It is\nrather by simple virtue of their location within geographic borders\nthat people belong to a state and fall under the authority of its\nruler. It is within a geographic territory that modern sovereigns are\nsupremely authoritative.\n\nTerritoriality is now deeply taken for granted. It is a feature of\nauthority all across the globe. Even supranational and international\ninstitutions like the European Union and the United Nations are\ncomposed of states whose membership is in turn defined territorially.\nThis universality of form is distinctive of modernity and underlines\nsovereignty\u2019s connection with modernity. Though territoriality\nhas existed in different eras and locales, other principles of\nmembership like family kinship, religion, tribe, and feudal ties have\nalso held great prestige. Most vividly contrasting with territoriality\nis a wandering tribe, whose authority structure is completely\ndisassociated with a particular piece of land. Territoriality\nspecifies by what quality citizens are subject to authority \u2014\ntheir geographic location within a set of boundaries. International\nrelations theorists have indeed pointed out the similarity between\nsovereignty and another institution in which lines demarcate land\n\u2014 private property. Indeed, the two prominently rose together in\nthe thought of Thomas Hobbes.\n\nSupreme authority within a territory \u2014 this is the general\ndefinition of sovereignty. Historical manifestations of sovereignty\nare almost always specific instances of this general definition. It is\nin fact the instances of which philosophers and the politically\nmotivated have spoken most often, making their claim for the\nsovereignty of this person or that body of law. Understanding\nsovereignty, then, involves understanding claims to it, or at least\nsome of the most important of these claims.\n\nOver the past half millennium, these claims have taken extraordinarily\ndiverse forms \u2014 nations asserting independence from mother\nstates, communists seeking freedom from colonialists, the vox\npopuli contending with ancien regimes, theocracies who\nreject the authority of secular states, and sundry others. It is\nindeed a mark of the resilience and flexibility of the sovereign state\nthat it has accommodated such diverse sorts of authority. Though a\ncatalog of these authorities is not possible here, three dimensions\nalong which they may be understood will help to categorize them: the\nholders of sovereignty, the absolute or non-absolute nature of\nsovereignty, and the relationship between the internal and external\ndimensions of sovereignty.\n\nAs suggested, diverse authorities have held sovereignty \u2014 kings,\ndictators, peoples ruling through constitutions, and the like. The\ncharacter of the holder of supreme authority within a territory is\nprobably the most important dimension of sovereignty. In early modern\ntimes, French theorist Jean Bodin thought that sovereignty must reside\nin a single individual. Both he and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes\nconceived the sovereign as being above the law. Later thinkers\ndiffered, coming to envision new loci for sovereignty, but remaining\ncommitted to the principle.\n\nSovereignty can also be absolute or non-absolute. How is it possible\nthat sovereignty might be non-absolute if it is also supreme? After\nall, scholars like Alan James argue that sovereignty can only be\neither present or absent, and cannot exist partially (James 1999,\n462\u20134). But here, absoluteness refers not to the extent or\ncharacter of sovereignty, which must always be supreme, but rather to\nthe scope of matters over which a holder of authority is sovereign.\nBodin and Hobbes envisioned sovereignty as absolute, extending to all\nmatters within the territory, unconditionally. It is possible for an\nauthority to be sovereign over some matters within a territory, but\nnot all. Today, many European Union (EU) member states exhibit\nnon-absoluteness. They are sovereign in governing defense, but not in\ngoverning their currencies, trade policies, and many social welfare\npolicies, which they administer in cooperation with EU authorities as\nset forth in EU law. Absolute sovereignty is quintessential modern\nsovereignty. But in recent decades, it has begun to be circumscribed\nby institutions like the EU, the UN\u2019s practices of sanctioning\nintervention, and the international criminal court.\n\nA final pair of adjectives that define sovereignty is\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal.\u201d In this case, the\nwords do not describe exclusive sorts of sovereignty, but different\naspects of sovereignty that are coexistent and omnipresent. Sovereign\nauthority is exercised within borders, but also, by definition, with\nrespect to outsiders, who may not interfere with the sovereign\u2019s\ngovernance. The state has been the chief holder of external\nsovereignty since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, after which\ninterference in other states\u2019 governing prerogatives became\nillegitimate. The concept of sovereignty in international law most\noften connotes external sovereignty. Alan James similarly conceives of\nexternal sovereignty as constitutional independence \u2014 a\nstate\u2019s freedom from outside influence upon its basic\nprerogatives (James 1999, 460\u2013462). Significantly, external\nsovereignty depends on recognition by outsiders. To states, this\nrecognition is what a no-trespassing law is to private property\n\u2014 a set of mutual understandings that give property, or the\nstate, immunity from outside interference. It is also external\nsovereignty that establishes the basic condition of international\nrelations \u2014 anarchy, meaning the lack of a higher authority that\nmakes claims on lower authorities. An assemblage of states, both\ninternally and externally sovereign, makes up an international system,\nwhere sovereign entities ally, trade, make war, and make peace.\n",
