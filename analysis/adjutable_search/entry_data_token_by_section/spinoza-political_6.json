    "main_text": "Basic Features of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy || Spinoza and Normativity\n2.3 Spinoza and Normativity\n\n\nAs Edwin Curley rightly points out, to deny that there is a transcendental\nstandard of justice is not to deny that there is any normative standard\nby which we can evaluate action (Curley 1996). Even if one can act\nirrationally without violating nature that does not mean that all of\none\u2019s actions have the same normative status. As Spinoza puts it,\n\u201cit is one thing, I say, to defend oneself, to preserve oneself,\nto give judgment, etc., by right, another thing to defend and preserve\noneself in the best way and to give the best judgment\u201d (TP 5/1).\nThe goodness of an action is to be judged in relation to whether the\naction aids one\u2019s striving to preserve and augment one\u2019s power (see\nEIVP18S; TP 2/8; TTP 16/181). The striving to preserve and\naugment one\u2019s power, which constitutes one\u2019s actual essence\n(EIIIP7), provides a standard for moral judgments: things are\ngood or bad to the extent that they aid or diminish one\u2019s power of\nacting (Curley 1973). And just as the individual ought to do those\nthings that maximize his or her own power or welfare, Spinoza takes it\nas axiomatic that the state ought to do those things that maximize the\npower of the people as a whole (e.g., TTP 16/184).\n",
