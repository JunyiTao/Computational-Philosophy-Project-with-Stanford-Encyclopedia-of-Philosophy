It shall not be so\namong you.\n (Matthew 20:25\u201326)\n \n\nBe not you called rabbi. For one is your master, and all you are\nbrethren. And call none your father upon earth: for one is your\nfather, who is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is\nyour master, Christ.\n (Matthew 23:8\u201310)\n \n\n\nDespite these texts the clergy accepted titles of honour and claimed\nauthority and power: the Church saw itself as Christ\u2019s kingdom\non earth, and claimed a share in Christ\u2019s power.\n\nPaul\u2019s text, \n\n\nFor what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge\nthem that are within? For them that are without, God will judge,\n (1 Corinthians 5:12\u201313)\n \n\n\nwas usually taken to imply that the Church has no jurisdiction over\nnon-Christians (\u201cthem that are without\u201d, i.e., outside the\nChurch).\n",
