    "main_text": "The Critique of Scientism || The Charm of Reduction\n2.3 The Charm of Reduction\n\n\nIn the next passages of Wittgenstein's lectures he turns to a fairly\ndetailed examination of the distinct charm, for some, of\npsycho-analytic explanation, and he interweaves this with the\ndistinction between scientific-causal explanation of an action versus\nmotive-based (or personally-generated) explanations of that action. It\nis easy, but mistaken, to read these passages as simply\nsubject-switching anticipations of his lectures on Freud to\nfollow. His fundamental interest here lies with the powerful charm, a\nkind of conceptual magnetism, of reductive explanations that promise a\nbrief, compact, and propositionally-encapsulated account of what some\nmuch larger field of thought or action \u201creally\u201d is. (He\ncites the example of boiling Redpath, one of his auditors, down to\nashes, etc., and then saying \u201cThis is all Redpath really\nis\u201d, adding the remark \u201cSaying this might have a certain\ncharm, but would be misleading to say the least\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 24).  \u201cTo say the least\u201d indeed: the example is\nstriking precisely because one can feel the attraction of an\nencapsulating and simplifying reduction of the bewildering and\nmonumental complexity of a human being, while at the same time\nfeeling, as a human being, that any such reduction to a few physical\nelements would hardly capture the essence of a person.  This, he\nobserves, is an explanation of the \u201cThis is only really\nthis\u201d form. Reductive causal explanations function in just the\nsame way in aesthetics, and this links directly to the problems in\nphilosophical methodology that he adumbrated in the Blue and Brown\nBooks (1958a, 17\u201319), particularly where he discusses what\nhe there calls \u201ccraving for generality\u201d and the attendant\n\u201ccontemptuous attitude toward the particular case\u201d. If the\nparadigm of the sciences (which themselves, as he observes in passing,\ncarry an imprimatur of epistemic prestige and the image of\nincontrovertibility) is Newtonian mechanics, and we then implant that\nmodel under our subsequent thinking about psychology, we will almost\nimmediately arrive at an idea of a science of the mind, where that\nscience would progress through the gradual accumulation of\npsychological laws. (This would constitute, as he memorably puts it, a\n\u201cmechanics of the soul\u201d [Wittgenstein 1966, 29]). We then\ndream of a psychological science of aesthetics, where\u2014although\n\u201cwe'd not thereby have solved what we feel to be aesthetic\npuzzlement\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 29)\u2014we may find ourselves\nable to predict (borrowing the criterion of predictive power from\nscience) what effect a given line of poetry, or a given musical\nphrase, may have on a certain person whose reaction patterns we have\nstudied. But aesthetic puzzlement, again, is of a different\nkind, and\u2014here he takes a major step forward, from the\ncritical, to the constructive, phase of his lectures. He writes,\n\u201cWhat we really want, to solve aesthetic puzzlements, is certain\ncomparisons\u2014grouping together of certain cases\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29).  Such a method, such an approach, would never\nso much as occur to us were we to remain both dazzled by the\nmisappropriated model of mechanics and contemptuous of the particular\ncase.\n",
