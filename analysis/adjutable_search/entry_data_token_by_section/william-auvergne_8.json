    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || Against the Necessity of Creation\n6.4 Against the Necessity of Creation\n\nWilliam thinks the will is necessarily free; thus the fact that God\ncreates through his will means that creation is an exercise of\nGod\u2019s free will. This point serves to undermine another aspect\nof Avicenna\u2019s doctrine of the procession of creatures from God.\nFor Avicenna posits not only a series of creators, but also holds that\nthis procession is utterly necessary: the actual world must exist and\ncould not have been other than it is. William thinks this conclusion\nstems from a failure to grasp God\u2019s freedom in creation.\nAvicenna and others imposed \u201cnot only necessity, but natural\nservitude upon the creator, supposing that he operates in the manner\nof nature\u201d (OO I, 614b; Teske 1998a, 72). Thus, they think the\nuniverse issued from God as brightness issues from the sun or heat\nfrom fire, and that God no more had it in his power to do otherwise\nthan do the sun or heat. Against this William argues that it is a\nconsequence of God\u2019s free creation that he had it in his power\nto create otherwise than he did.\n",
