    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Social, Utilitarian, and Role-Based Arguments\n3.5 Social, Utilitarian, and Role-Based Arguments\n\nA fourth approach to the question of suicide\u2019s permissibility\nasks not whether others may interfere with suicidal behavior but\nwhether we have a liberty right to suicide, whether, that is, suicide\nviolates any moral duties to others. Those who argue that suicide can\nviolate our duties to others generally claim that suicide can harm\neither specific others (family, friends, etc.) or is a harm to the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nNo doubt the suicide of a family member or loved one produces a number\nof harmful psychological and economic effects. In addition to the\nusual grief, suicide \u201csurvivors\u201d confront a complex array\nof feelings. Various forms of guilt are quite common, such as that\narising from (a) the belief that one contributed to the suicidal\nperson\u2019s anguish, or (b) the failure to recognize that anguish,\nor (c) the inability to prevent the suicidal act itself. Suicide also\nleads to rage, loneliness, and awareness of vulnerability in those\nleft behind. Still, some of these reactions may be due to the strong\nstigma and shame associated with suicide, in which case these\nreactions cannot, without logical circularity, be invoked in arguments\nthat suicide is wrong because it produces these psychological\nreactions (Pabst Battin 1996, 68\u201369), i.e., the wrongfulness of\nsuicide cannot rest on the emotions provoked by the belief that it is\nwrong. Suicide can also cause clear economic or material harm, as when\nthe suicidal person leaves behind dependents unable to support\nthemselves financially. Suicide can therefore be understood as a\nviolation of the distinctive \u201crole obligations\u201d applicable\nto spouses, parents, caretakers, and loved ones. However, even if\nsuicide is harmful to family members or loved ones, this does not\nsupport an absolute prohibition on suicide, since some suicides will\nnot leave survivors, and among those that do, the extent of these\nharms is likely to differ such that the stronger these relationships\nare, the more harmful suicide is and the more likely it is to be\nmorally wrong. Besides, from a utilitarian perspective, these harms\nwould have to be weighed against the harms done to the would-be\nsuicide by continuing to live a difficult or painful life. At most,\nthe argument that suicide is a harm to family and to loved ones\nestablishes that it is sometimes wrong (Cholbi 2011, 62\u201364).\n\nA second brand of social argument echoes Aristotle in asserting that\nsuicide is a harm to the community or the state. One general form such\narguments take is that because a community depends on the economic and\nsocial productivity of its members, its members have an obligation to\ncontribute to their society, an obligation clearly violated by suicide\n(Pabst Battin 1996, 70\u201378, Cholbi 2011, 58\u201360). For\nexample, suicide denies a society the labor provided by its members,\nor in the case of those with scarce talents such as medicine, art, or\npolitical leadership, the crucial goods their talents enable them to\nprovide. Another version states that suicide deprives society of\nwhatever individuals might contribute to society morally (by way of\ncharity, beneficence, moral example, etc.) Still, it is difficult to\nshow that a society has a moral claim on its members\u2019 labor,\ntalents, or virtue that compels its members to contribute to\nsocietal well-being no matter what. After all, individuals often fail\nto contribute as much as they might in terms of their labor or special\ntalents without incurring moral blame. It does not therefore seem to\nbe the case that individuals are morally required to benefit society\nin whatever way they are capable, regardless of the harms to\nthemselves. Again, this line of argument appears to show at most only\nthat suicide is sometimes wrong, namely, when the benefit (in terms of\nfuture harm not suffered) the individual gains by dying is less than\nthe benefits she would deny to society by dying.\n\nA modification of this argument claims that suicide violates a\nperson\u2019s duty of reciprocity to society (Cholbi 2011,\n60\u201362). On this view, an individual and the society in which she\nlives stand in a reciprocal relationship such that in exchange for the\ngoods the society has provided to the individual, the individual must\ncontinue to live in order to provide her society with the goods that\nrelationship demands. Yet in envisioning the relationship between\nsociety and the individual as quasi-contractual in nature, the\nreciprocity argument reveals its principal flaw: The conditions of\nthis \u201ccontract\u201d may not be met, and also, once met, impose\nno further obligations upon the parties. As Baron d\u2019Holbach\n(1970, 136\u2013137) pointed out, the contract between an individual\nand her society is a conditional one, presupposing \u201cmutual\nadvantages between the contracting parties.\u201d Hence, if a society\nfails to fulfill its obligations under the contract, namely to provide\nindividuals with the goods needed for a decent quality of life, then\nthe individual is not morally required to live in order to reciprocate\nan arrangement that society has already reneged on. Moreover, once an\nindividual has discharged her obligations under this societal\ncontract, she no longer is under an obligation to continue her life.\nHence, the aged or others who have already made substantial\ncontributions to societal welfare would be morally permitted to engage\nin suicide under this argument.\n",
