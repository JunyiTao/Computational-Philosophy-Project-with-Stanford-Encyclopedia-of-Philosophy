    "main_text": "\n\n\nAbu Yusuf Ya\u2018qub ibn Ishaq Al-Kindi (ca. 800\u2013870 CE) was\nthe first self-identified philosopher in the Arabic tradition. He\nworked with a group of translators who rendered works of Aristotle,\nthe Neoplatonists, and Greek mathematicians and scientists into\nArabic.  Al-Kindi\u2019s own treatises, many of them epistles\naddressed to members of the caliphal family, depended heavily on these\ntranslations, which included the famous Theology of Aristotle\nand Book of Causes, Arabic versions of works by Plotinus and\nProclus.  Al-Kindi\u2019s own thought was suffused with Neoplatonism,\nthough his main authority in philosophical matters was\nAristotle. Al-Kindi\u2019s philosophical treatises include On\nFirst Philosophy, in which he argues that the world is not\neternal and that God is a simple One.  He also wrote numerous works on\nother philosophical topics, especially psychology (including the\nwell-known On the Intellect) and cosmology. Al-Kindi\u2019s\nwork in mathematics and the sciences was also extensive, and he was\nknown in both the later Arabic and the Latin traditions for his\nwritings on astrology.\n",
