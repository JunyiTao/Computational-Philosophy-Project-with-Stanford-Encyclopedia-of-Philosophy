    "main_text": "\n\nScholars in general have not taken seriously Thomas Jefferson\n(1743\u20131826) as a philosopher, perhaps because he never wrote a\nformal philosophical treatise. Yet Jefferson was a prodigious writer,\nand his writings were suffuse with philosophical content.\nWell-acquainted with the philosophical literature of his day and of\nantiquity, he left behind a rich philosophical legacy in his\ndeclarations, presidential messages and addresses, public papers,\nnumerous bills, letters to philosophically minded correspondents, and\nhis only book, Notes on the State of Virginia. Scrutiny of\nthose writings reveals a refined political philosophy as well as a\nsystemic approach to a philosophy of education in partnership with it.\nJefferson\u2019s political philosophy and his views on education were\nundergirded and guided by a consistent and progressive vision of\nhumans, their place in the cosmos, and the good life that owed much to\nancient philosophers like Epictetus, Antoninus, and Cicero; to the\nethical precepts of Jesus; to coetaneous Scottish empiricists like\nFrancis Hutcheson and Lord Kames; and even to esteemed religionists\nand philosophically inclined literary figures of the period like\nLaurence Sterne, Jean Baptiste Massillon, and Miguel Cervantes. In one\narea, however, he was behindhand: his views on race, the subject of\nthe final section.\n",
