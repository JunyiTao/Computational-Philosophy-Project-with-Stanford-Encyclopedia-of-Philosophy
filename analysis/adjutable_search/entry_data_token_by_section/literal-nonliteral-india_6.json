    "main_text": "Primary and Secondary Meaning || Varieties of Secondary Meaning\n2.2 Varieties of Secondary Meaning\nIn what follows, we will classify any kind of derivative meaning, whether it be metaphor, metonymy, irony, hyperbole, punning, etc., as \u201csecondary.\u201d Again, we are in the realm of word-meanings, although there is discussion of sentence-level secondary meaning, primarily in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Ved\u0101nta, and Ala\u1e41k\u0101ra. While the task of precisely carving up varieties of secondary meaning was frequently left to philosophers working on aesthetics, other philosophers also took an interest in this question. Many stock examples of secondary meaning are shared among the textual traditions, although it is not until much later, in the seventeenth century, that Indian linguistic analysis becomes robustly interdisciplinary, in the work of Navya-Ny\u0101ya (see Bronner 2002). There are various ways to classify secondary meaning: it may be based on the logical relationship between primary and secondary meaning, on the semantic distance between them, or on the role of speaker intention.\nFor instance, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, the aforementioned philosopher of aesthetics, distinguishes between secondary meaning that is qualitative and secondary meaning that is free from qualities. The qualitative includes metaphorical cases such as \u201cThe person is an ox,\u201d where the stubbornness of the person and the ox are understood to be shared qualities. In contrast, cases like \u201cThe village is on the Ganges\u201d are typical of those that are free from qualities. Here, the word \u201cbank\u201d is understood so as to avoid the interpretation that the village is floating on the river itself\u2014but there are no properties shared between the village and the Ganges (or the bank). In point of fact, Mukula argues that a speaker may intend different secondary meanings with the same utterance type, since another reason someone might utter the sentence is to communicate that the village and the Ganges do share qualities\u2014the holiness of the Ganges river could be attributed to the village due to proximity. In this way, the Ganges sentence could exemplify a different utterance, one where there is \u201csemantic imbuing\u201d of the qualities of the river to the bank (Keating 2019:55, 117\u2013126). Thus whether a speaker intends or does not intend a secondary meaning becomes relevant to its characterization. Finally, both the qualitative and quality-free varieties may differ in terms of how closely related the primary and secondary meanings are. Mukula describes highly conventional language use as cases of \u201cabsorption\u201d\u2014for instance, using the term \u201cruler\u201d for to someone who is not from the ruling class (so not strictly a ruler), but who performs the functions a ruler does (such as protecting of people). In contrast, metaphors such as \u201cThe person is an ox\u201d are not absorption, but superimposition, since some difference is understood. (See Keating 2019, Cuneo 2020, and McCrea 2008 for further discussion of Mukula and \u0100nandavardhana on these topics.)\nAll of these varieties of secondary meaning require three conditions. First, there must be an obstacle in the primary meaning of the words. Second, there must some relationship\u2014of which kind, more below\u2014between the primary and secondary meaning. Third, there must be a warrant for the secondary meaning, such as a motivation on the speaker\u2019s part or some accepted conventional sense. To take a stock example, \u201cFeed the sticks,\u201d which means \u201cFeed the brahmins holding the sticks,\u201d word \u201csticks\u201d refers to something which is inanimate and which cannot be fed. Thus, the first condition is met\u2014an obstacle to what is called \u201csemantic fit\u201d (yogyat\u0101) which is necessary for a unified sentence. Second, there is a relationship of association between br\u0101hmin priests and sticks\u2014they carry walking sticks. Association is not the only possible relationship between primary and secondary meaning, but it is one, and it fulfills the second condition. Finally, a speaker using this phrase would be trading on a conventionalized use, and thus meets the third condition, of warrant.\nWhile this three-fold set of conditions is commonly accepted, given different analyses of primary word-meaning, the boundary between primary and secondary meaning will be drawn differently. For instance, Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, who take the primary word-meaning to be a universal, find cases of secondary meaning more pervasive than Ny\u0101ya philosophers, for whom word-meaning in the primary sense is more flexible. Given the command, \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d the correct thing to do is to find some single cow to fasten to a post. However, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas such as Kum\u0101rila argue that the primary meaning of \u201ccow\u201d in the command is cowhood, which cannot be fastened to a post. Thus there is an obstacle to the semantic fit of the sentence. To resolve this difficulty, Kum\u0101rila invokes the secondary meaning function known as indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), on which see McCrea 2020. In TV 1.3.10, he argues that indication causes hearers to understand that an individual cow is meant. Hearers understand this from the knowledge that \u201ccow\u201d means cowhood, that individual cows are qualified by cowhood, and yet that the sentence is uttered for the purpose of fulfilling sacrificial aims. Thus the relationship between the primary and secondary meanings here is inherence (a universal inheres in an individual), and the speaker aims to pick out a particular cow.\nOne of the central categories of secondary meaning is those meanings which have similarities with the primary meaning. For instance, Kum\u0101rila takes qualitative expression (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), figures based on similarities, to be one of the two major types of secondary meaning, where indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) is a catch-all category for figures based on any other kind of relationship. The figure of speech which rhetorical traditions tracing back to ancient Greece call \u201cmetaphor\u201d would fall under qualitative expression, although Indian thinkers generally focus on the logical structure underlying figures rather than a syntactic structure by which metaphor is often characterized (Gerow 1971). Kum\u0101rila discusses the common example \u201cDevadatta is a lion,\u201d saying that when people hear the utterance, they find the word \u201clion\u201d to be inexplicable as referring to Devadatta, and therefore conclude that the term must be used figuratively. However, while some thinkers would describe metaphors as involving a superimposition of lion on Devadatta, Kum\u0101rila explicitly rejects this analysis, saying that all that is meant is that there are similar properties that the two have, such as bravery. Otherwise, superimposition would mean there is confusion about the genuine difference between people and lions.\nOne might object that the three examples just given: \u201cFeed the sticks,\u201d \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d and \u201cDevadatta is a lion\u201d do not all have the same kind of obstacle. Philosophers, in the Aesthetic discipline and elsewhere, work to make the nature of this obstacle precise. While initially the emphasis is on the semantic connection within the sentence itself, for Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 both, by the time of Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra (ca seventh century CE) and V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra (ca tenth century CE), the failure is taken to be wider, including problems with the larger context. In the ninth century work of Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, such a widening is apparent as he distinguishes between multiple features of context which may require a word to be taken in a secondary sense: a speaker, sentence, time, place, and circumstance. Sometimes there is a clash between a speaker and a sentence meaning, as in the case taken from courtly love poetry\u2014a common source of linguistic examples\u2014where a young woman utters words, \u201cI go alone to the forest along the riverbank\u201d to a neighbor. She is to be understood as conveying the opposite (she is not going alone) to her neighbor, but intending her husband to overhear and to believe she is telling the truth. Since we know facts (through the poetic context or genre) about the woman\u2019s personal life, Mukula argues that the sentence cannot be taken to mean the literal truth.\n",
