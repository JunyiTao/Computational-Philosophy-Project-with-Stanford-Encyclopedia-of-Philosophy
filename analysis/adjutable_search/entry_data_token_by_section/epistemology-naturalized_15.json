    "main_text": "Other Topics and Approaches || Feminist epistemology\n6.2 Feminist epistemology\n\nAs the reference to Longino in the previous (sub)section suggests,\nthere is a continuity between the issues and concerns addressed within\nSE and those addressed within feminist epistemology (FE).\n(For overviews of the latter, see Anderson 2012; Grasswick 2013, esp.\nSection 1; and Janack n.d. in Other Internet Resources). Like SE (and\nNE), of course, FE is a broad category, within which many diverse\nprojects and positions are assayed. As Longino puts it,\n\n\nThere is no single feminist epistemology. Instead there are a plethora\nof ideas, approaches, and arguments that have in common only their\nauthors\u2019 commitment to exposing and reversing the derogation of women\nand the gender bias of traditional formulations. (1999: 331) \n\n\nNonetheless, like SE and NE, historically FE has been motivated by\nconcerns about the ideals and assumptions built into TE\u2014albeit,\nof course, from a distinctly feminist perspective. Thus, for example,\ntraditional notions of reason and objectivity have been subjected to\ncritical scrutiny, on the grounds that they embody (usually tacitly)\ncertain characteristically masculine ideals, such as a separation from\nother people, from the object of knowledge, and from one\u2019s own\nbody and the socio-cultural milieu. (Not surprisingly, here,\nonce again, Cartesian assumptions and aspirations come in for special\ncritical attention.)\n\nAgainst this general background, many theorists adopt a more or less\nnaturalistic approach to the subject matter\u2014focusing on\nparticular features of the actual epistemic situation and drawing from\na diverse range of areas of empirical study (psychology, gender\nstudies, sociological and historical studies, and others). Among such\nNE-minded philosophers, however, different theorists once again stake\nout different positions. Thus, for example, a number of feminist\nepistemologists (e.g., Antony 1993, Campbell 1998, Nelson 1990) draw\nupon Quine\u2019s work. Just as in NE, however, others (e.g., Clough\n2004, Code 1996) argue that a different sort of naturalistic approach\nis to be preferred\u2014sometimes, on grounds familiar from those\ndiscussed earlier; sometimes, because of specifically feminist\nconcerns. So too, just as in both NE and SE, there is disagreement\nabout how much of the original framework of TE\u2014which of its\nconcepts, concerns, and assumptions\u2014should be retained, and how\ncertain of its elements might need to be recast so as to render them acceptable.\n",
