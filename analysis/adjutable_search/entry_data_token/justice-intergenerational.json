How Intergenerational Relations Differ from Relations Among Contemporaries\n\nIt may seem that considerations of justice do not apply to\nintergenerational relations, because there is a lack of direct\nreciprocity between generations of people who are not contemporaries.\nAmong non-contemporaries, there is no mutual cooperation and there are\nno exchanges in kind (see Barry 1989b: 189\u2013203; Barry 1991:\n231\u2013234; Heyd 2009a: 167\u2013176; but see Gosseries 2009,\nMazor 2010, and Brandstedt 2015 for conceptions of indirect and\ntransgenerational reciprocity that do not require that the initial\ncontributor is among the final beneficiaries). This fact about the\nrelations between present and remote past or future generations is\nclosely related to a second feature of intergenerational relations:\nthe permanent asymmetry in power-relations between living people and\nthose who will live in the future. These power relations are\nqualitatively different from those among contemporaries, which are\nrelatively fluid and subject to change (Barry 1977: 243\u201344;\nBarry 1989b: 189).\n\nNot only can the present generation influence the conduct of future\npeople by affecting their desires and circumstances, it can also\nexercise power by setting back the interests of future generations. It\ncan, for example, pursue a natural-resource policy with long-term\nnegative consequences. In this case, the present generation imposes\nupon future generations the risk of having their options reduced to an\ninadequate range\u2014unless, that is, future generations will have\navailable to them and can afford to use technologies that allow them\nto adapt to the circumstances (Barry 1999; Beckerman 1999; Heyward\n2017). By contrast, remote future people cannot at all affect the\nwell-being of the lives of the presently living, at least not today\nand according to conceptions of well-being that have a subjective\ncomponent. Still, such future people might nevertheless be considered\nable to set back the interests of or even wrong present or past\npersons insofar as the latter have, or had, interests with respect to\nposthumous future states of affairs. In the same way, the presently\nliving may be morally constrained in their actions that relate to\npeople who lived in the remote past (see\n \u00a75.4).\n\nThird, those presently alive can affect the very existence of future\npeople (whether or not future people will exist), the number of future\npeople (how many future people will exist), and the identity of future\npeople (who will exist). In short: future people\u2019s existence,\nnumber, and specific identity depend (are contingent) upon currently\nliving people\u2019s decisions and actions. A decision taken by\npresent generations could conceivably result in the termination of\nhuman life (see, e.g., Scheffler 2013; Mulgan 2015; McKinnon 2017);\nthere is a long tradition of institutionalized population policy whose\ngoal is to control the size of future generations (see, e.g., McMahan\n1981); and, more prosaically, a couple can certainly decide whether or\nnot to have children (see\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a73.2).\n Furthermore, many of our decisions have indirect effects on how many\npeople will live and who they are, for many of our decisions affect\nwho meets whom and who decides to have children with whom. To explain\nsuch \u201cdifferent people choices\u201d, Parfit adopts the genetic\nidentity view of personal identity: the identity of a person is at\nleast in part constituted by the DNA the person has as a result of\nwhich ovum was fertilized by this or that spermatozoon in the creation\nof this person. Our actions thus have an effect on the genetic\nidentity of future people in so far as they affect from which\nparticular pairs of cells future people will grow\u2014and any action\nthat affects people\u2019s reproductive choices, directly or\nindirectly, will do that. Many of our actions in fact have an indirect\neffect on when future people will be conceived. If we decide between\ntwo long-term policies regarding the use of natural resources, for\nexample, we know that depending on which we choose, different (and\nmost likely also a different number of) future people will come into\nexistence. For example, the European Commission finds that more than\none million babies may have been produced as a result of the Erasmus\nProgramme (the European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of\nUniversity Students, and with more than three million students\nparticipating since 1987), most of who would very likely not have come\nto existence without at least one of their parents participating in\nthe Programme (European Commission 2014: 130\u2013131).\n\nBy contrast, when we make decisions affecting our contemporaries, we\ndo not face different people choices. Our decisions may affect their\nexistence only with respect to their survival; their number only with\nrespect to how many survive; their identity only in the sense that we\nmight be in a position to change their conditions of life, character,\nand self-understanding. Of course, we can affect neither the number\nnor the identity of past generations.\n\nLastly, our knowledge of the future is limited. While we can know the\nparticular identities of presently existing people (and very many\npreviously living people), we are normally not in a position to refer\nto specifically identifiable future persons. It is not that all\npredictions about the future decrease in certainty at some constant\nrate (see Cowen & Parfit 1992: 148). Indeed, many predictions are\nmore likely to be true concerning the further future than the more\nimmediate future. For example, the prediction that some policy will\nhave changed or that certain resources will have been exhausted is\nmore likely to be true in the further future. Nonetheless, we cannot\nknow the specific identities of persons in the further future. Our\nlack of certain knowledge of the future also means that we often will\nbe in a position to know at best merely the likelihood of normatively\nrelevant consequences of alternative long-term policies.\n\nThese differences between our relations to one another and our\nrelations to subsequent or antecedent generations give rise to a\nnumber of important debates. Among them are the following: The first\nconcerns the normative significance of the non-changeable fact that\nremote future people as well as deceased people do not even have the\npotential for exercising power over presently living people. According\nto the Will Theory, for a person to have a right vis-\u00e0-vis\nanother person requires the former to be able to exercise his or her\nrights with respect to the conduct of the latter (Hart 1955:\n183\u2013184; Hart 1982: 183; Wellman 1995: 91\u201392; Steiner\n1994: 59\u201373). Thus, the unchangeable power-asymmetry among\nnon-contemporaries will exclude the possibility of future\nnon-contemporaries and deceased people being bearers of rights claims\nagainst presently living people (Steiner 1983; Steiner 1994:\n249\u2013261; Fabre 2001; see also Ackerman 1980: 70\u201375).\nConsequently, for the proponents of the Will Theory considerations of\njustice (as understood in this entry) do not apply to\nintergenerational relations. According to the Interest Theory of\nRights (Raz 1984; Raz 1986: 166\u2013188; Raz 1994: 45\u201351;\nKramer 1998: 60\u2013101) being able to exercise one\u2019s\nrights\u2014to demand or waive the enforcement of a right\u2014is\nneither sufficient nor necessary for someone to be the bearer of the\nright. For a person to hold a right, the right, when actual,\nnecessarily preserves one or more of the persons\u2019 interests\n(Kramer 1998: 62). Understanding the relations between currently\nliving people and future non-contemporaries in terms of justice\nassumes that for a person to have a valid justice claim\nvis-\u00e0-vis another person (who stands under the correlative\nduties) does not depend upon being able to harm or benefit the other\nperson (Barry 1989b: chs. 4\u20136; Buchanan 1990; but see Gauthier\n1986; Heyd 2009a; Hiskes 2009: 9).\n\nThe second debate concerns the normative significance of the\ncontingency of future people upon currently living people\u2019s\ndecisions and actions. If and insofar as the existence, identity, or\nnumber of future people depend upon present decisions and actions, to\nwhat extent can the former be said to be harmed by the latter?\nFurthermore, can presently existing persons, in making such decisions,\nbe guided by the interests of future persons? These are the questions\nthat underlie the so-called \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d (see\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74;\n see also entry on\n nonidentity problem).\n\nThe third debate concerns the status of previously living people. Is\nit possible for currently living people to harm past people, and do\ncurrently living people have duties toward them? (See\n \u00a75)\n\nOther important debates include the interpretation of the significance\nof our limited knowledge of the future. As we know at best merely the\nlikelihood of the differing consequences of alternative policies, how\nshould we assess the imposition of differing risks on and the likely\nor uncertain provision of benefits for future people? (See, e.g.,\nBirnbacher 1988: 140\u2013172, 175\u2013179; Jonas\u2019 notion of\na \u201cHeuristik der Furcht\u201d (heuristics of fear) in\n1979: 63\u201364; Mintz-Woo 2019). Some focus on how how to assess\nthe imposition of differing risks of rights violations (see, e.g.,\nMcCarthy 1997; Oberdiek 2012; Perry 2014; Meyer & Stelzer 2018).\nAnother issue is whether we have reasons to discount the future in the\nsense of discounting future persons\u2019 well-being (see, e.g.,\nSidgwick 1907 [1981: 414]; Ramsey 1928: 261; Rawls 1971: 263; Parfit\n1984: appendix F; Cowen & Parfit 1992; Broome 1994; Mintz-Woo\nforthcoming). A further debate concerns the motivation that currently\nliving have for fulfilling their supposed duties to future people,\ngiven that currently living people know neither future people\u2019s\nindividual identities nor their particular preferences. Partly due to\nthese features as well as the unchangeable asymmetry in\npower-relations between currently living people and remote future\ngenerations, currently living people\u2019s compliance with their\nobligations to remote future people is likely to be less reliable (see\nBirnbacher 2009)\n\nThe entry will report on the second and third debates as they are\ncentrally important for understanding the very possibility of\nintergenerational justice. In both debates one needs to be clear about\nhow one assesses an act as harmful or beneficial. Owing to the death\nof the bearer of interests and the contingency of future people the\nway in which currently living people can be said to harm or benefit\npreviously living and future people is problematic. According to the\nso-called person-affecting view, an act can be wrong only if that act\nharms, or will harm or can be expected to harm, a person who does or\nwill exist (see especially Parfit 1984: 363, 295\u2013396; Heyd 1992\nand 2014: 2\u20133; Boonin 2008; Roberts 2013). One important issue\nis whether one should adopt a person-affecting view or an impersonal\nview. Some interpret duties of intergenerational justice on the basis\nof what might be called a weak person-affecting view. According to\nthis view, in assessing whether an act is harmful or wrongful what\nmatters is what has been done to a particular existing or future\nperson. A weakly person-affecting assessment does not require that the\nact under scrutiny make an existing or future person worse off or harm\nthat person by comparing how well off the person was before.\nConcerning the questions of whether a future person will be harmed or\nwronged by having been brought into existence under certain conditions\nthe weak person affecting view relies neither on a comparison with the\nstate the person would have been in had she not been brought into\nexistence, that is with the person\u2019s never-ever existing, nor on\na comparison with how well off other people would have been had\ncurrently living people acted differently. Never-ever existing and\npotentially existing people do not count; only those people who\nactually exist at some time count.\n\nThis weak person-affecting view stands in contrast to a strong\nperson-affecting view according to which an act or action harms a\nperson only if the same person is worse off than she would otherwise\nat that time have been. Both the weak and the strong person-affecting\nviews differ from impersonal views according to which the value of\nstates of affairs is not reducible to their effect on the interests of\nactual people. Currently living people ought to choose to bring about\nthe state of affairs in which more of the morally relevant values will\nbe realized irrespective of who the people are who will live. Many\ntheorists claim that a plausible understanding of intergenerational\nethics must be impersonal or must combine person-affecting and\nimpersonal considerations (see especially J. Harris 1992: 94\u201395;\nSinger 1998; Buchanan et al. 2000: 249; Harman 2004: 101\u2013102;\nMcBrayer 2008: 304; Holtug 2009: 71\u201392; McMahan 2009:\n49\u201368; Temkin 2012: 313\u2013362; Williams & Harris 2014:\n347; Heyd\u2019s interpretation of Parfit 2011 in Heyd 2014; Parfit\n2017). The differences between the person-affecting and impersonal\nunderstandings will come to the fore in\n Section 2.2\n and\n Section 3\n on intergenerational duties that reflect what is owed to future\npeople as a matter of justice as well as in\n Section 4.6\n on the limits of a rights-based account of intergenerational\nethics.\n2. Rights of Future People vis-\u00e0-vis Presently Living People\n\nOn a person-affecting view, future people count if, and insofar as,\nthey have interests, just claims, or rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently\nliving people. Some philosophers deny that this can ever be the case.\nIn addition to an argument reflecting the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d\n (\u00a7\u00a72.2; 3\u20134.3)\n we can distinguish at least three further arguments in support of the\ndenial of the possibility of future people having rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis us.\n2.1 Doubts about the Possibility of Future People Having Rights\n\nFirst, some philosophers have denied that future people can have\nrights (or just claims), based simply on the fact that they will live\nin the future. Consider the following claim: \n\n\nFuture generations by definition do not exist now. They cannot now,\ntherefore, be the present bearer or subject of anything, including\nrights. (De George 1981: 161; see also Macklin 1981: 151\u2013152;\nBeckerman & Pasek 2001: 14\u201323; Herstein 2009:\n1180\u20131182) \n\n\nClaiming that we can violate the rights of future people now does not,\nhowever, imply that future people have rights now (though see\nPartridge 1990: 54\u201355, who suggests that future people have\nrights in the present). That implication would hold only if it were\nconceded that presently existing rights alone constrain present\naction. But we can safely assume, first, that future people will be\nbearers of rights in the future, second, that the rights they have\nwill be determined by the interests they have then, and third, that\nour present actions and policies can affect their interests. If we can\nviolate a person\u2019s rights by frustrating her interests severely,\nand if we can so severely frustrate such interests of future people,\nwe can violate their future rights (see Hoerster 1991: 98\u2013102).\nTheir future existence itself is thus insufficient to ground the claim\nthat we cannot now violate the rights of future persons.\n\nAccording to the second argument, for future people to have rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis us we would have to ascribe a right to existence to\nthem. However, we are not committed to the claim that if we are able\nnow to violate the rights of future generations, it is their rights to\nexistence that we violate. Since it is implausible that\nanyone has a right to existence as such, it is implausible\nthat future persons have rights to existence. Furthermore, when we\nprevent someone\u2019s existence, we do not thereby harm the\nhypothetical interests of this potential subject. Thus, claiming that\nactual future people have rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living\npeople now cannot commit us to claiming that possible future people\nhave a right to existence.\n\nThe third argument points to the fact that our epistemic situation\ndoes not allow us to relate to future people as individuals. Can our\npresent actions nonetheless be constrained by rights of future\ngenerations that are based on interests other than existence as such,\ninterests such as subsistence, etc.? This is possible only if\nattributing rights to people does not require us to make reference to\nindividual persons (Herstein 2009: 1180\u20131182). However, third,\nlack of particular knowledge of future people as individuals does not\nstand in the way of attributing to them welfare rights, such as a\nright to subsistence.\n [1]\n The corresponding obligations do not depend on the\nparticular identity of future persons. Rather, such\nobligations are grounded in the fact that future persons are human\nbeings; that is, they share those properties of being human that\npermit and require us to relate morally to them as fellow humans who\nshould be able to pursue their own well-being.\n\nHaving reported on skeptical doubts concerning the possibility of\nfuture people having rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people\nwe now turn to an analysis of the relevance of the contingency of\nfuture people\u2014the subject that, under the title of the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d has been at the core of much of the\nphilosophical inquiry into the foundations of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a7\u00a73\u20134.4;\n see also entry\n nonidentity problem).\n We will introduce that core issue by addressing a specific criticism\nof the person-affecting view in the context of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a72.2):\n Some have argued that a person-affecting view cannot account for the\nwidely held belief that persons have the right not to be brought into\nexistence if the person-to-be would not reach a sufficiently good (or\ndecent) level of well-being.\n2.2 A Right to Non-Existence?\n\nCan prospective children be said to have an interest that their\nparents not act in a way likely to lead to their birth when the\nparents are in a position to know that the life of the child, should\nit be born, would fall below some relevant threshold of well-being?\n(On the significance of the notion of a threshold level of well-being,\nsee below,\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74).\n John Stuart Mill endorses the idea of a procreational duty of\nomission, namely, not to bring a person into existence unless the\nperson will have \u201cat least the ordinary chances of a desirable\nexistence\u201d (see Mill 1859 [1977: 301\u2013304]). It is a widely\nheld belief that under certain circumstances prospective parents\nshould refrain from procreating owing to the predicted plight of the\nwould-be child. Antinatalists hold that these conditions hold\ngenerally (see, e.g., Schopenhauer, 1851: vol. 2, ch. xii, \u00a7 149;\nCioran, 1978: 117; Horstmann 1983: 99\u2013101). More recently, for\nexample, Seana Shiffrin (1999) and David Benatar (2006: esp. ch. 2)\nhave argued that causing someone to exist always entails the\nfrustration of some of the person\u2019s interests and nontrivial\nharm to that person, and therefore we ought to refrain from\nprocreating.\n\nSince the publication of Narveson\u2019s seminal paper\n\u201cUtilitarianism and New Generations\u201d (Narveson 1967; see\nalso Narveson 1973), many have contributed to the debate on whether a\nperson-affecting approach can account for the asymmetry of our\nprocreational duties (Parfit 1976; Feinberg 1984: 101, and 1986;\nMulgan 2006: ch. 6; Rivera-L\u00f3pez 2009). The claimed asymmetry\nis the following: while prospective parents have no obligation to\nprocreate out of regard for the interests of possible future children,\nthey have an obligation not to beget children who are going to be\nmiserable.\n\nSome have argued that belief in such an asymmetry is incompatible with\na person-affecting view and, more particularly, with the claim that\npossible people cannot be said to have, against us, a right to\n existence.[2]\n It is helpful at this point to make a distinction between the\nreasoning of potential parents that involves a possible\nfuture child and reasoning that involves their future child\n(see Govier 1979: 111). For instance, in deciding not to procreate at\nall people do not thereby harm the children they could have brought\ninto existence (see\n \u00a72.1)\n since these are merely possible individuals. Thus, much reasoning\nabout whether or not to have a child should concern the interests of\nthose already alive; it is actual people\u2019s lives that would be\naffected by whether or not the child comes into existence (see Heyd\n1992: 96\u201397; Roberts 2009: sec. 2). Nonetheless, people might\nmake choices about procreation based on the welfare of their future\nchild; that is, the welfare of that as yet non-existent individual\nwould feature in their reasoning. When prospective parents decide in\nfavor of having a child and now learn that this child, if born, would\nhave a life that falls below a certain threshold of well-being (see\n \u00a74)\n they ought to consider the effects of their actions on their\nchild and might well decide not to have a child after all.\n\nObjections to the asymmetry view presented above concern, in\nparticular, the claim that after having made a decision to have\nchildren, prospective parents should revise their decision out of\nregard for their would-be child(ren) when they learn that the\nprospective child(ren) would have a life that falls below the relevant\nthreshold. Why, under these circumstances, should parents revise their\ndecision to have children out of regard for the children? Some argue\nthat they would harm the would-be child, and, thus, arguably, would\nact wrongly toward it. Here, harming their child-to-be would inflict a\nwrong on it. When prospective parents learn that their child would\nhave a life that falls below the relevant threshold, they should\nrefrain from having it, for by bringing the child into existence they\nwould cause harm to it. In bringing about a child\u2019s existence\nthey can harm this child.\n\nThis claim has been said to be incompatible with a person-affecting\nview (see Heyd 1992: 102, 105\u2013106, 241\u2013242). In\n Section 3,\n two notions of harm will be distinguished. The first relies on\ncomparing a person\u2019s actual state to a counterfactual (or\nhistorical) state of the same person. The second relies on no such\ncomparison. Both notions of harm require us to ask: for whom is the\naction worse? However, while both notions can be understood to reflect\nthe person-affecting view as specified above\n (\u00a71),\n only the first fulfills the stronger conditions of Parfit\u2019s\n\u201ctwo-state requirement\u201d or\n\u201cbetter-or-worse-for-the-same-person\u201d requirement: \n\n\nwe benefit or harm someone only if we cause him to be better or worse\noff than he would otherwise at that time have been. (Parfit 1984: 487)\n\n\n\nThis requirement characterizes the strong person-affecting view (as\nintroduced in\n \u00a71).\n The contingency of future people will often mean that the same person\ncould not or is not likely to have come into existence as a result of\ntwo alternative acts or actions (see below\n \u00a73.1).\n As will be shown in\n Section 3.2\n below, in applying the second notion of harm, we do not have to\ncompare the value of life below some threshold with nonexistence (or\nwith how well off another person or other people would have been) in\norder to be able to claim that we can cause harm to a person by\nbringing about that person\u2019s existence. The second notion\nfulfills the conditions of the weak person-affecting view (as\nintroduced in\n \u00a71).\n\nIf on the basis of this reflection we assume that the person can be\nconsidered harmed, why was the person wronged by having been brought\ninto existence if the person has a life worth living? If we specify\nthe threshold in terms of rights we might think that the person would\nwaive whatever right was violated by having been brought into\nexistence as the person can be assumed to much prefer living to\nnever-ever-coming into existence. Then we might believe that bringing\ninto existence a person whose life is worth living, but below the\nthreshold, is a case of wrongless harm-doing if we consider the issue\nin person-affecting terms (see J. Harris 1992: 94\u201396; Williams\n& Harris 2014, 347\u2013348).\n\nThe assumed fact that the person would waive her right clearly does\nnot settle the matter of whether she was wronged by having been\nbrought into existence (Harman 2004: 89\u2013101; Liberto 2014:\n79\u201380). A person can have a legitimate complaint about having\nbeen brought into existence although she does not wish that the action\nhad not occurred, although she (the same person) could not be in the\nstate of not having been wronged (but see Heyd 2014: 4\u20135), and\neven though she enjoys a life worth living.\n\nThe claim that bringing into existence a person in a harmed state\naccording to a certain threshold is wrongful implies that this person\nis worse off than she ought to be. That the person will have a life\nworth living is not a sufficient reason to render permissible bringing\nthe person into existence and in a harmed sub-threshold state. The\nground for this reason does not rely on a comparison with how well off\nthe person or other people would be if we refrain from bringing the\nperson into existence or acted differently (but see Harman 2004:\n101\u2013102; McBrayer 2008: 304; Woollard 2012). The reason\nunderstood in person-affecting terms does not reflect the view that\nthe person would be better off if he or she would never ever come to\nexistence or the view that we should bring into existence another\nperson whose life is above the threshold or the view that we should\nmaximize the number of people with lives above the threshold. Rather,\nif we have a choice between bringing into existence a person with a\nlife worth living, but below the threshold, and bringing into\nexistence a person with a life worth living at or above the threshold,\nthe reason, namely, that persons can be worse off than they ought to\nbe, speaks against doing the former but not in favor of doing the\nlatter. This is how we can argue on the basis of a weak\nperson-affecting view (see\n \u00a71)\n and a threshold conception of harm (see\n \u00a73).\n\nLet us note that one can also defend the asymmetry of our\nprocreational duties from an impersonal view, according to which the\nvalue of states of affairs is not reducible to how these states affect\nthe interests of people. From an impersonal view one does not have to\nclaim that prospective parents should refrain from procreation out\nof regard for the children they would have. Based on this view,\ntwo alternative interpretations of the asymmetry of our procreational\nduties have been discussed in the literature. One could adopt a\nversion of negative consequentialism and argue that the universe would\nbe better if present generations were guided by a criterion of right\naction that requires them to give priority to the prevention of\nsuffering over the creation of good and happiness (see Heyd 1992:\n59\u201360, for problems with this account). Alternatively, an\nimpersonal approach could argue that we have a prima facie\nduty to promote over-all happiness by creating new well off\npeople\u2014which duty, however, may be more easily overridden than\nduties not to cause harm. The paradoxical implications of the latter\nview have been prominently explored by Derek\n Parfit.[3]\n3. No Rights Due to Contingency of Future People Upon Our Decisions?\n\nThe main source of skepticism concerning the very possibility of\nfuture people having welfare rights vis-\u00e0-vis those currently\nliving rests upon the contingency of future people upon currently\nliving people\u2019s decisions and actions. We know, of course, that\nwhen we harm future people\u2019s interests and violate their rights,\nspecific persons are harmed. But the decision we take counts as a\nnecessary condition of the very existence of this genetically and\nnumerically specific set of people at some future point in time. The\nso-called \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d presupposes this fact and\ninterprets it as a challenge to the very possibility of\nintergenerational justice.\n3.1 Responses to the \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d\n\nConsider a policy of making intensive and extensive use of exhaustible\nresources for the aim of increasing the welfare of currently living\npeople. If the policy is criticized for harming future people on the\nground that this policy will predictably worsen their conditions of\nlife and thus is likely to violate their welfare rights, a defender of\nthe policy could reply by saying: many, if not\n all[4]\n of our actions have (indirect) effects not only on the conditions of\nlife, but also on the number, existence, and identity of future\npersons. This is also true for actions that allegedly harm future\npersons. If the non-performance of the allegedly harmful action would\nhave resulted in the allegedly harmed person not coming into\nexistence, then that person cannot be said to have been harmed by this\naction\u2014or, at any rate, according to the common understanding of\nharm (see Meyer 2003: 147\u2013149, 155\u2013158, for a detailed\ndiscussion).\n\nThe common understanding is informed by a diachronic notion of harm\nand a notion that requires a subjunctive comparison with a historical\nbaseline (hereinafter subjunctive-historical notion of\n harm).[5]\n Both the diachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of harm\nrequire that the existence of the harmed person or people qua\nindividuals is independent of the harming act or policy. On the\ndiachronic notion of harm, the following formula holds:\n\n(I)\n (diachronic) An action (or\n inaction)[6]\n at time \\(t_1\\) harms someone only if the agent causes (allows) this\nperson to be worse off at some later time\n \\(t_2\\)[7]\n than the person was before \\(t_1\\).\n\n\nOn the subjunctive-historical notion of harm, the corresponding\nnecessary condition for harming is:\n\n(II)\n (subjunctive-historical) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\)\nharms someone only if the agent causes (or allows) this person to be\nworse off at some later time \\(t_2\\) than the person would have been\nat \\(t_2\\) had the agent not interacted with (or acted with respect\nto) this person at\n all.[8]\n\n\nWhen considering future individuals as possible individuals both the\ndiachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of harm will exclude\nthe possibility of present people harming future people, for the\n(future) people whose interests and rights they are required to\nrespect are not in a particular state of well-being at the time they\ntake their decision\u2014they do not, at that time, exist. But\naccording to\n (I)\n unless we can claim that the person is in a particular state of\nwell-being at the time of our decision, that is, at \\(t_1\\), we cannot\nsay that the person is worse off at \\(t_2\\) owing to our decision at\n\\(t_1\\). And likewise with\n (II):\n unless we can claim that there is a specific person who would have\nbeen better off at \\(t_2\\) than this person actually is at \\(t_2\\) had\nwe not acted with respect to this person at all, this notion of harm\nmakes no sense.\n\nAdopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical notions\nof harm excludes the possibility of our harming future people when we\nchoose among long-term policies with significantly differing\nconsequences for the quality of life of future people. With respect to\npersons whose existence is dependent upon the allegedly harming\naction, they cannot be worse (or, indeed, better) off owing to this\naction than they would have been had this action not been carried out.\nFor in that case, they would not have existed.\n\nWe can distinguish four main responses to the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d so understood (compare Boonin 2008:\n134 ff; Page 2008; Heyd 2009b; Roberts 2013; Wrigley 2012: 178):\nFirst, some philosophers hold the view that future people whose\nexistence depends upon currently living people\u2019s actions cannot\nhave rights vis-\u00e0-vis the latter people\u2019s actions (see\nSchwartz 1978; cf. Adams 1979; Kavka 1982; Parfit 1984: part iv;\nBoonin 2008; Roberts 2009). Second, others argue that currently living\npeople can violate the rights of future people even if the former\ncannot harm the latter (see Kumar 2003). If so, future people cannot\nhave welfare rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people insofar\nas violating welfare rights implies setting back or harming the\ninterests of the right holders. Third, we can attempt to limit the\npractical significance of the non-identity-problem by limiting the\nrelevant actions to those that are not only likely but indeed\nnecessary conditions of the existence of the concerned\n person.[9]\n\nFinally, some have sought to circumvent the non-identity-problem by\nsuggesting an alternative notion of harm that is unaffected by the\nnon-identity-problem, the so-called \u201cThreshold Conception of\nHarm\u201d (Hanser 1990, 2009; McMahan 1998; Shiffrin 1999; Meyer\n2003, 2009a; Harman 2004, 2009; Rivera-L\u00f3pez 2009). The\nresponse to the \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d based on the\nthreshold conception is relevantly different from other responses\n(such as those criticized by Heyd in 2009b). The threshold response\ncan be understood to be person-affecting in the weak sense (see\n \u00a71\n above): While the person being harmed according to the threshold\nnotion does not imply that the same person is worse off than she would\nhave otherwise been at that time, it does imply that this person is\nworse off than she ought to be. We owe it to the person when she will\nhave come to existence that she is not in a harmed state (see\n \u00a72.2\n above). Such an understanding is relevantly different from an\nimpersonal understanding according to which the universe is a better\nplace when it does not include people in a harmed state as judged by\nthe threshold Notion (but see Wrigley 2012: 178).\n\nThe threshold notion substitutes the necessary condition:\n\n(III)\n (threshold) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\) harms a\nperson only if the agent thereby causes (allows) either the coming\ninto existence of this person in a sub-threshold state or the already\nexisting person to be in a sub-threshold state; further, only if this\nperson would not be in the harmed state had the agent not interacted\nwith (or acted with respect to) this person at all; and furthermore,\nonly if the agent, if he cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, does\nnot minimize the harm.\n\n\nAccording to such a threshold notion of harm an action harms a person\nonly if, as a consequence of that action, the (then existing) person\nfalls below a normatively defined threshold (see McMahan 1998:\n223\u2013229; Shiffrin 1999). This threshold notion is unaffected by\nthe non-identity-problem, for here the finding of harm does not\nrequire that the person who is in the sub-threshold state would be in\na better state in the situation that would have obtained in the\nabsence of the harming action. Thus, future people can be said to be\nharmed by currently living people\u2019s actions even if these\nactions are among the necessary conditions of the existence, identity\nor number of future people. Such a notion of harm limits the practical\nsignificance of the non-identity-problem to different degrees\ndepending upon how the threshold is substantially defined (see\n \u00a74\n below).\n\nBoth of the claims discussed above (in\n \u00a71\n and\n \u00a72,\n passim), namely,\n\n\nfirst, that considerations reflecting the welfare rights of future\npeople vis-\u00e0-vis present people can guide the latter in\nchoosing among long-term policies, and\n\nsecond, that considerations of the rights of people not to be brought\ninto existence if they are likely not to realise a certain level of\nwell-being can guide prospective parents in deciding not to conceive\nout of regard for the children they would otherwise have,\n\n\ncan be read as relying upon a threshold notion of harm (Meyer\n2003).\n\nAdopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical notions\nof harm\n (I\n and\n II,\n above) or both excludes, firstly, the possibility of our harming\nfuture people when we choose among long-term policies with\nsignificantly differing consequences for the quality of life of future\npeople, and, secondly, the possibility that we harm persons by\nbringing them into existence if they will have a life worth living.\nBut if we adopt the threshold notion of harm at\n ((III)\n above), future people can be said to be wronged by our choice of a\npolicy that harms them, notwithstanding the fact that the existence of\nthe specific people who are said to be harmed is causally dependent on\nour decision to pursue this\n policy.[10]\n According to (III) parents could act in light of an interest on the\npart of their would-be child in never existing at all: if the child\nwere to be born, it would have a life below the relevant threshold.\nThe subject of harm is the person when she is brought into existence\nin a harmed state. That she would not be worse or better off than she\notherwise would have been is irrelevant for determining that she is or\nwill be in a harmed sub-threshold state (see\n \u00a72.2).\n3.2 Derek Parfit\u2019s No-Difference View and the Disjunctive Notion of Harm\n\nDerek Parfit has introduced the \u201cNo-Difference View\u201d: It\nmakes no (theoretical or practical) difference to how we should act,\nall things considered, whether the size and composition of future\ngenerations depend upon our present decision or not. The relevant\nreasons are the same or have the same strength.\n\nTo what extent we can defend that view will depend on how we\nunderstand the relation between the notions of harm as distinguished\nin\n Section 3.1.\n Here we will delineate two views of how to understand these notions\nof harm and investigate the question of the extent to which these two\nalternative views support Parfit\u2019s \u201cNo-Difference\nView\u201d. According to our first view, one must choose between the\n\u201csingle threshold\u201d and the \u201csingle\nsubjunctive-historical\u201d notion of harm: to claim that\nrights-considerations can guide us in choosing among long-term\npolicies we will have to adopt one of these notions of harm as\nspecifying necessary conditions of harm; in doing so, we have to deny\nthat the other notion specifies necessary (or sufficient) conditions\nof harm. In other words, the first view considers the \u201csingle\nthreshold\u201d and the \u201csingle subjunctive-historical\u201d\nnotion of harm as exclusive notions. According to the second view, the\nthreshold notion of harm and the subjunctive-historical notion can be\ncombined.\n\nAccording to this \u201cdisjunctive notion\u201d the necessary\ncondition for harming is the disjunction of the conditions for harming\nas set out by the notions of harm at\n (II)\n and\n (III).\n The proposal is this: instead of interpreting accounts of harm at\n(II) and (III) as providing alternative necessary conditions for\nharming, we can take these two notions to provide the disjuncts for a\nnecessary condition for harming. This disjunctive notion of harm\nsubstitutes yet a fourth necessary condition of what it means to harm\nsomeone:\n\n(IV)\n (disjunctive) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\) harms\nsomeone only if either the conditions of harming as in\n III\n or as in\n II\n are fulfilled.\n\n\nWe clearly ought to prefer the disjunctive notion to the single\nsubjunctive-historical view according to which the\nsubjunctive-historical notion of harm specifies necessary conditions\nof harm (and the threshold notion at\n (III)\n specifies neither necessary nor sufficient conditions). The\ndisjunctive notion is compatible with the thesis of this entry that\nrelies upon our employing a threshold notion of harm where the\nsubjunctive-historical and the diachronic notions do not\n apply.[11]\n Some authors also argue that being worse off than the same person was\nor would have been is not a necessary condition for harm where the\nidentity of the person is independent of the harming action (Hanser\n1990; Shiffrin 1999; Harman 2004: 98\u2013101; Woollard 2012:\n681\u2013683; but see Roberts 2009: 19\u201320). Ought we to prefer\nthe disjunctive notion to the single threshold notion according to\nwhich the threshold condition is a necessary condition of harm? The\nadvantage of the disjunctive notion is that this view of harm allows\nus to rely on the subjunctive-historical notion of harm whenever it is\napplicable, that is, when we will harm an existing person. In these\ncases the notion of harm at\n (II)\n provides us with what most consider a straightforward account of the\nharm caused (see also\n \u00a75.2).\n\nConsider the type of case where we can act in a way that diminishes\nthe well-being of a person who lives above any plausibly construed\nthreshold. However, we will diminish the person\u2019s well-being to\na level still clearly above the threshold. For example, someone breaks\ninto the garage of a mansion and steals the new convertible while the\nwealthy owner is at his penthouse in the city. This theft is not\nlikely to cause the wealthy person\u2019s well-being to fall below\nany plausibly construed threshold of harm, and thus according to\n (III)\n does not harm him. This seems implausible. Such a case is normally\nunderstood as a case in which the affected person is clearly harmed.\nMore generally, the objection is that the threshold conception is\nunder-inclusive in interpreting which acts we consider harmful.\n\nThe single threshold view by itself does not provide us with a\nresponse to this objection. For a plausible substantive specification\nof a threshold notion (see\n \u00a74.3\n below) will not include a concern for the well-being of those above\nthe threshold. Thus, in responding to the objection we would have to\nadd an additional obligation. For example, we could appeal to the\nadditional obligation of minimizing harm to other persons: The\nobligation requires that we not cause another person to fall to a\nlower level of well-being quite independently of the level of\nwell-being the person already realizes. What counts as a lower level\nof well-being can be measured by the specified threshold.\n\nOn the other hand, the disjunctive notion allows us to rely on the\nnotion of harm at\n (II).\n This provides us with a straightforward account of the harm caused.\nThus, the disjunctive notion is not open to the objection as stated.\nHowever, while the single threshold view can be shown to be fully\ncompatible with Parfit\u2019s No-Difference View, the disjunctive\nnotion of harm raises difficult questions of interpretation of its\nown.\n\nParfit illustrates the No-Difference View by considering two medical\nprograms (1984: 367). In each case a certain rare condition can be\npassed from mother to child. One involves pregnancy testing. If the\ntest comes out positive, fetuses are treated for the rare condition.\nThe other involves preconception testing. The women who test positive\nas carriers of the rare condition are told to postpone conception for\nat least two months and to undergo (harmless) treatment after which\nthe condition will have disappeared. Available funds can be spent on\none or the other program, and the other must be cancelled. Assuming\nthat both programs have equivalent effects on parents, that the\nconditions lead to the same particular handicap in children, and that\nthe two programs will achieve a similar success rate, the programs\ndiffer only in affecting actual people (pregnancy testing) or possible\npeople (preconception testing). The (practical) no-difference view\nsays: our reason to prevent harm to possible future people (those who\nmight be conceived) is as strong as our reason to prevent harm to\nactual people (those already conceived who will develop from the\nalready existing fetuses in due course). The two medical programs in\nParfit\u2019s example are equally worthy and it makes no moral\ndifference which is cancelled.\n\nIs the disjunctive notion of harm compatible with the no-difference\nview, thus understood? Here we cannot discuss the implications of the\ndisjunctive notion in any detail. We might first observe that both the\nsubjunctive-historical and threshold notions of harm can be employed\nto interpret many core cases of harm. That is to say, both sets of\nconditions as specified by the two notions of harm will arguably be\nsatisfied in many cases where most people agree that harm was\ncaused\u2014at least under plausible construals of both notions of\nharm. Second, in the cases in which not both sets of conditions\nobtain, we still find that harm was caused, namely, as long as at\nleast one set of conditions obtains. If the threshold notion of harm\napplies, we find that harm was caused. The disjunctive notion entails\nthat canceling either test causes harm.\n\nHowever, the disjunctive notion does not entail that it makes no\npractical difference which test we cancel. A plausible interpretation\nof the disjunctive notion might be the following: satisfying either\nset of the conditions provides a reason for objecting to the proposed\naction; if both sets of conditions obtain, the objection is presumably\nstronger than when only one set of conditions obtains. According to\nthis understanding of the disjunctive notion and assuming that in\nParfit\u2019s example of the two medical programs the children, if\neither they or their mothers are not treated, will suffer a severe\nhandicap, the objection to canceling pregnancy testing is stronger\nthan the objection to canceling the preconception testing program.\nBecause the handicap is severe, the children will fall below the\nthreshold and the threshold notion of harm provides the same reason\nfor objecting to canceling either program. But if pregnancy testing is\ncancelled this will be worse for the children who are not\ntreated\u2014the subjunctive-historical notion of harm applies. The\nsubjunctive-historical notion of harm does not, however, provide a\nreason for objecting to cancellation of preconception testing. The\nchildren who will be born handicapped would never have existed if\nthere had been testing prior to\n conception.[12]\n This understanding of the disjunctive notion may not, then, be\ncompatible with the no-difference view. An alternative understanding\nwould deny that where both notions of harm are applicable this\nstrengthens the objection to the harmful act. Whether this strengthens\nthe objection and, if so, how much more is a matter of future research\n(see Woollard 2012: 684\u2013689).\n\nThe single threshold interpretation of harm is also compatible with a\nsecond and stronger understanding of the no-difference view (Woodward\n1986: sects. II and III; Parfit 1986: 856\u2013859): there is no\ntheoretical difference in harming possible future people and\nharming actual people since the very same reasons hold against harming\neither group. The disjunctive notion is clearly incompatible with the\ntheoretical understanding of the no-difference view. According to the\ndisjunctive notion it would often not be true that the same reasons\nhold against harming either such group. When we object to the harming\nof actual people we will often have additional reasons that reflect\nthe fact that the subjunctive-historical notion of harm applies.\n4. How to Specify the Threshold\n\nIn\n Section 2.2\n and\n Section 3\n we introduced (the weak person-affecting interpretation of) the\nthreshold conception of harm as a response to the logical-conceptual\nnon-identity-problem. By itself this does not answer the question how\nthis conception is to be understood as an element of a substantive\nunderstanding of distributive justice of intergenerational relations.\nTwo debates are particularly relevant: first, the debate on how to\nunderstand the principle of distributive justice; and, second, the\ndebate on the currency\u2014that is, how to measure the relevant\ndifferences in well-being.\n\nAn interpretation of the threshold as an element of a sufficiency\nconception of intergenerational justice is not mandatory, but seems\nplausible (as discussed in\n \u00a74.4):\n the threshold can be interpreted as a sufficiency standard that is\ndefined in terms of absolute, non-comparative conditions (defined by a\ncertain level of well-being and not comparing the well-being levels of\npeople) and which all people have a priority claim to achieve\n(Shiffrin 1999: 123\u2013124; McMahan 1998: 223\u2013229; Page 2006:\nesp. 90\u201395, 170\u2013173; Casal 2007: 298\u2013299; Meyer\n& Roser 2009: 226\u2013243; Huseby 2012; Shields 2016:\n34\u201335; Meyer & P\u00f6lzler forthcoming). Whether one and\nthe same threshold is applicable to all decisions is controversial.\nWhether we wrongfully inflict non-comparative harms on a person by\ncausing this person\u2019s existence is often considered a special\ncase for which a particularly low threshold is relevant: we cause such\nharm by bringing a person to existence only if this person\u2019s\npostnatal potential of development and his life span are drastically\nreduced (Kavka 1982: 105\u2013106) and especially so if the person\nexperiences pain (C. E. Harris 1991: 65\u201366; Sch\u00f6ne-Seifert\n& Kr\u00fcger 1993: 257\u2013258; Merkel 2001).\n4.1 Specifying the Threshold by Egalitarian Considerations\n\nWe might want to understand the threshold as an element of an\negalitarian understanding of intergenerational justice. Egalitarian\nreasons allow us to object to inequalities, for egalitarian reasons\nmake it possible for us to understand relative differences between the\nstates of persons as something \u201cwhich is itself to be eliminated\nor reduced\u201d (Scanlon 2005: 6). We might hold that the standing\nof people relative to their contemporaries is (extrinsically or\nintrinsically) important (see the entry on\n equality)\n and that the threshold notion of harm ought to reflect, say, the\naverage level of well-being that people realize\u2014or that future\npeople will realize: the higher the average level of well-being, the\nhigher the threshold level of harm should be set.\n\nEgalitarian considerations that address relative differences between\npeople can help specify the standard in at least two ways. First,\npresently existing people may be thought to harm future people by\ncausing them to realize a (much) lower level of well-being than their\nown contemporaries (Sher 1979: 389). In addition or alternatively, we\nmight hold that the threshold level ought to reflect, say, the average\nlevel of well-being of the present generations upon whose decisions\nthe well-being of future people depend. According to such an\ninterpretation presently existing people harm future people by causing\nthem to realize a (much) lower level of well-being than they enjoy\nthemselves (see, for example, Barry 1999).\n\nStill, even if egalitarian considerations that reflect a concern with\nthe relative differences between people can contribute to the\nspecification of the threshold, a plausible threshold arguably is not\ngoing to be based on that concern only. Otherwise\u2014this is an\nimplication of the first interpretation\u2014any level of well-being\nwould be considered justified as long as all future people fare\nequally badly. This presupposes attributing intrinsic value\nexclusively to equality\u2014an implausible view (see the entry on\n equality\n and\n \u00a74.2\n below and \u00a74.5\n below). Moreover, to define the\nthreshold standard of well-being of future people as the level of\nwell-being achieved by currently living people (whatever it may be) is\nless than plausible, unless we were to attribute intrinsic value\nexclusively to intergenerational equality, so understood (see Marmor\n2003, Steiner 2003, Raz 2003, Gosepath 2004: 454\u201363; and Holtug\n& Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). This understanding does not only imply\nthat it is worse for future generations to be worse off than the\npresent generation; it also implies that it is, in one respect, worse\nfor future generations to be better off. In the intragenerational\ncontext some philosophers have argued that this implication (the\nrecommendation to \u201clevel down\u201d persons\u2019 well-being)\nis implausible (see Parfit 1997; Raz 1986: 230\u2013235). An\nanalogous objection applies to intergenerational relations as well. It\nis doubtful that a more equal distribution across generations is\nbetter if it came at the cost of some generations being worse off, and\nnone being better off. Under certain circumstances this view would\ndeny that currently living people may stand under a duty of justice\npositively to save for future people so that they will achieve a\nsufficientarian level of well-being (see\n \u00a74.5\n on Rawls\u2019 \u201csavings principle\u201d).\n4.2 Specifying the Threshold by Prioritarian Reasoning\n\nAccording to the priority view (Parfit 1997: 213; Holtug\n2007; Attas 2009:\n207\u2013211), equality as such does not matter. It is therefore not\nopen to objections against holding equality to be of intrinsic value.\nA plausible version of the priority view reads as follows:\n\n\nPriority view: Benefiting persons matters more the worse off\nthe person is to whom the benefits accrue, the more people are being\nbenefited and the greater the benefits in question.\n\n\nThe priority view has a built-in tendency towards equality, for the\nview accepts the following egalitarian condition: If X is worse\noff than Y, we have at least a prima facie reason for\npromoting the well-being of X rather than Y (unless\nconditions obtain under which the only or best way of raising the\nwell-being of X is by raising the well-being of Y or\nconditions under which promoting the well-being of X brings\nabout raising the well-being of Y as a side-effect). Even if\nprioritarians do not see anything intrinsically bad in social,\neconomic or other differences, their priority view is a derivatively\negalitarian view. To this extent it is correctly described as\nnon-relational egalitarianism.\n\nWe might want to rely on the priority view for specifying the\nthreshold of harm. On this interpretation, future people are in a\nharmed state unless they are as well off as such a prioritarian view\nrequires. There are at least two problems in understanding the\nthreshold as an element of a prioritarian understanding of\nintergenerational justice: First, the priority view is likely to\nentail excessive intergenerational requirements. Present actions or\ninactions can improve the well-being of many future generations to at\nleast some extent. Moreover, the number of future people will likely\nbe very large and depends in part upon currently living people\u2019s\ndecisions and actions. Hence, according to prioritarianism, we ought\nto sacrifice more of our present well-being for the sake of future\ngenerations than seems plausible. It might even be the case that we\nare required to incur significant costs for the sake of only minuscule\nfuture benefits (as in this way we might maximize the weighted sum of\nbenefits for future persons (see Rawls 1999: 287; Wolf 2009: 373; Meyer & Roser 2009:\n233\u2013235). How likely it is that the priority view has this\nimplication will also depend upon the strength the view gives to the\npriority of the worse off who are (very) badly off. Of course, the\npriority view will not have this implication if (whatever currently\nliving people do) all future people were to enjoy levels of well-being\nthat are higher than those of all or most currently living people.\n\nSecond, the priority view does not entail a plausible population cap.\nUnder some circumstances having large but badly off future generations\nmight be consistent with prioritizing the number of beneficiaries, the\nsize of benefits and those who are worse off (see entry on\n repugnant conclusion;\n Meyer 1997: 139\u2013140).\n4.3 Specifying the Threshold as a Sufficientarian Standard\n\nInterpreting the threshold concept as an element of a sufficiency\nconception of intergenerational justice can take a number of different\nforms (see Benbaji 2005: 316\u2013321 and 2006; Casal 2007:\n312\u2013326; Huseby 2010a). A plausible version is characterized by\ntwo theses, namely by what scholars have called the \u201cPositive\nThesis\u201d (see especially Casal 2007: 298\u2013299) and the\n\u201cShift Thesis\u201d (Shields 2016: 34\u201335). The Positive\nThesis states that we have weighty non-instrumental reasons to secure\nat least enough of some benefit(s). According to the Shift Thesis,\n\n\n\nonce people have secured enough there is a discontinuity in the rate\nof change of the marginal weight of our reasons to benefit individuals\nfurther. (Shields 2018: 211) \n\n\nThe Shift Thesis is compatible with several understandings of the\nrelevance of justice-based reasons above the threshold, among them:\nFirst, once a person is above the threshold of sufficiency there is no\njustice-based reason to benefit this person. This claim is often\nreferred to as the \u201cNegative Thesis\u201d of sufficientarianism\nand has been much criticized (Casal 2007: 299\u2013304). Second,\nother justice-based reasons apply above the threshold that are less\nweighty. This would mean that additional justice claims reflecting,\nfor example, prioritarian or egalitarian reasoning (see\n \u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3)\n can be valid. Third, the same justice-based reasons as below the\nthreshold undergo a relative change of weight at the sufficiency\nthreshold.\n\nThe third understanding of the Shift Thesis relates to a further\ndistinction of how to understand the sufficiency conception. Versions\nof sufficientarianism differ in how they take into account ethical or\njustice-based reasons to benefit persons above the threshold of\nsufficiency. Strong sufficientarianism gives absolute, weak\nsufficientarianism gives some but not absolute priority to those who\nare below the threshold. In the intergenerational context weak\nsufficientiarianism seems more plausible than strong\nsufficientarianism (Meyer & Stelzer 2018).\n\nSuppose not all presently living and future persons\u2019 claims to\nsufficiency well-being can be met (but see Wolf 2009: 362). Then we would need to weigh\nall people\u2019s claims. Proponents of sufficientarianism have\nproposed different principles of distribution below the threshold of\nsufficiency. Most prominently, they have argued that we ought to\nmaximize the well-being of present and future individuals below the\nthreshold (so-called \u201cmin-deprivation\u201d; Wolf 2009:\n356\u2013357); or that\nwe ought to maximize the number of individuals who are sufficiently\nwell-off (so-called \u201cheadcount\u201d; Page 2007a: 85\u201395).\nBoth of these below-threshold principles seem problematic. They will\noften imply that we ought to sacrifice the worst-off present or future\npersons for the sake of better-off, but still badly-off persons.\nAccording to a third understanding, we should rely on a priority view\nfor unavoidable sub-threshold distributions: benefitting persons below\nthe threshold of sufficiency matters more the more claimants are\nbenefitted and the greater these benefits (Meyer 2009a, 2009b, 2015;\nMeyer & Roser 2009). This understanding only entails sacrificing\nthe worst-off individuals for the sake of better off but still badly\noff individuals under circumstances where the former higher weighted\nclaims will be outweighed by the sum of the less weighty claims of\nmore better-off people.\n\nRichard Arneson and others (Arneson 1999, 2000; Roemer 2004; and see\nCasal 2007: esp. 312\u2013314, 315\u2013318) have objected to\nthresholds, and especially those that designate an absolute\npriority\u2014as is characteristic of the position of strong\nsufficientarianism\u2014on the grounds that we cannot avoid an\narbitrary specification of such priority thresholds and, further, that\nsuch thresholds are incompatible with our distributive\nconvictions\u2019 being continuous (that is, that they all can be\naccounted for by means of one principle of distribution). Others have\ndefended a priority threshold against both objections (Crisp 2003:\n753\u2013757; Benbaji 2006: 332\u2013344; Page 2007a: 16\u201318;\nDorsey 2008; Huseby 2010b: 180\u2013182; Freiman 2012: 30\u201333;\nShields 2012: 111\u2013115; Sher 2014: chs. 8 and 9; Meyer &\nP\u00f6lzler forthcoming). In specifying a priority threshold one\nimportant issue is on what currency we should rely (see\n \u00a74.4).\n .\n\nDefining a threshold of well-being according to which both currently\nand future living people are able to reach a sufficientarian threshold\narguably avoids the implausible implications of the egalitarian and\nprioritarian alternatives when we understand the latter to define\nthresholds of harm (see\n \u00a74.1\n and\n \u00a74.2):\n First, avoiding or reducing differences must not lead to a state of\naffairs in which people are worse off than they ought to be. Secondly,\nclaims against currently living people are unreasonable if in\nfulfilling them the currently living people will bring about minimal\nor even trivial improvements of the well-being of future people but\nsuffer losses themselves, causing them to fall below a plausible\nthreshold level of well-being. Third, the number of people brought\ninto existence ought to be compatible with all people having\nsufficiently good lives or lives worth living (see Meyer 1997:\n139\u2013140).\n\nTo be sure, according to the \u201cshift thesis\u201d justice-based\nreasons may apply above the threshold and they can include egalitarian\nor prioritarian reasons. And one should note that the reasons for a\nsufficientarian understanding of intergenerational justice are at\nleast in part specific reasons and are not necessarily relevant for\nunderstanding either global justice or the notion of justice that\nholds among contemporary members of well-ordered societies.\n4.4 On the Currency of Intergenerational Justice\n If we interpret the threshold as an element of a sufficiency\nconception of intergenerational justice the threshold identifies a\nsufficiency standard which all people have a priority claim to\nachieve. Such an interpretation is supported by a view of the currency\nof well-being that helps explain why failure to meet the threshold\nsignificantly harms people. Basic needs are such a view. If people\ncannot satisfy their basic needs, they are necessarily and severely\ndamaged: necessarily as the damage does not occur because of special\nenvironmental conditions or as the person concerned has special\ncharacteristics. Rather, it is because of such conditions and\ncharacteristics that currently apply and will remain foreseeably and\nlargely unchanged (Wiggins 1998: 15). The damage is significant\nbecause it undermines the conditions for the possibility of a\nminimally good life (Wiggins 1998: 14). For example, if a person has\nno access to food, this leads to apathy, organ damage or even death of\nthe person. Such damage is physiologically necessary, regardless of,\nfor example, the nationality, social status or religion of the person\nconcerned. Being able to satisfy basic needs when understood in this\nway can be protected for reasons of justice by ascribing the\ncorresponding moral rights. The same list of such rights is attributed\nto all people (wherever and whenever they live), which does not\nexclude the possibility that changing social, economic and cultural\nconditions also change the means of satisfying basic needs (the\nso-called satisfiers of basic needs) (see, e.g., Braybrooke 1987; Sen\n1984; Nussbaum 2000: 132\u2013133; Page 2006: 71\u201375).\n\nThe currency of central capabilities (see Nussbaum 2006; Petz 2018) is\nhighly similar to basic needs. Other currencies differ in relevant\nways (Meyer & P\u00f6lzler forthcoming). For example, the currency\nof preference-satisfaction (whatever these preferences happen to be)\n(see, e.g., Arrow 1963; Goodin 1995; Singer 1979) measures well-being\nnot in objective, but in subjective terms: what a person prefers is\ncontingent on mental states, namely on the preferences of this person.\nAlso, the direction of future changes in preferences is difficult to\npredict; it is possible and plausible that future persons will have\n(fundamentally) different preferences than persons living today. The\ncurrency of impersonal resources (i.e., goods that can be used to\nproduce many kinds of benefits; for example, income and wealth) (see,\ne.g., Barry 1989a; Rawls 2001) faces a different problem:\npeople\u2019s levels of impersonal resources do not necessarily\ncorrelate with levels of well-being realized. Impersonal resources are\nunreliable indicators of well-being (see Page 2007b: 457\u2013458;\nSen 1982: 19\u201321, 26\u201330).\n4.5 Rawls\u2019s Just Savings Principle\n\nJohn Rawls was the first to develop a systematic account of\nobligations to future people as a central element of a theory of\njustice (Rawls 1971, 1999, especially section 44; Rawls 1993: 274;\nRawls 2001: especially sections 49.2 and 3). Rawls proposes a\nprinciple of \u201cjust savings\u201d. Long before Rawls Frank\nRamsey developed a model for determining the optimal savings within a\nutilitarian framework (Ramsey 1928; see entry on\n Ramsey and intergenerational welfare economics)\n disregarding distributional considerations. Following Sidgwick (1907\n[1981: 414]) Ramsey (1928: 261) as well as Rawls (1971: 263) and Parfit (1984: appendix\nF) reject what is called \u201cpure time discounting\u201d, that is,\ngiving less weight to the well-being or legitimate claims of future\npeople just because they live in the future. A long-standing issue in\neconomics is how loans and taxes for financing public policies compare\nin terms of the burdens imposed on future generations (see e.g., Pigou\n1920: ch. ix; Viner 1920; Mishan 1963). Provisions to protect the\nwelfare interests of future generations have been in place since\nancient times (Auerbach 1995: 27\u201335; Wissowa et al. 1937: vol.\nxi, 2011, 2014, 2021).\n\nIn proposing a principle of \u201cjust savings\u201d Rawls never\ndiscusses the non-identity-problem and for most of his discussions\n(but see Rawls rev. edition 1999: 141) he assumes that the number of\nfuture people is constant (for criticism see Heyd 1992: 47; Dasgupta\n1994; Casal & Williams 1995; Barry 1999: 107\u2013111; Gosseries\n2001: 330\u2013333). However, his principle of just savings can be\nunderstood to provide us with a substantive understanding of\nintergenerational sufficientarianism. It can be understood as an\ninterpretation of a threshold notion of harm in different number\nchoices (see Reiman 2007; Attas 2009).\n\nRawls specifies the sufficientarian threshold relevant for defining\ncurrently living people\u2019s obligations of justice\nvis-\u00e0-vis future people: \u201cthe conditions needed to\nestablish and to preserve a just basic structure over time\u201d\n(Rawls 2001: 159; on the basic structure as the subject of the\napplication of a sufficientarian principle see also Freiman 2012:\n33\u201337; Meyer 2015). Rawls distinguishes two stages of societal\ndevelopment for the application of his principle of just savings.\nCurrently living people have a justice-based reason to save for future\npeople only if such saving is necessary for allowing future people to\nreach the sufficientarian threshold as specified. This is known as the\naccumulation stage. Once just institutions are securely\nestablished\u2014this is known as the steady-state\nstage\u2014justice does not require people to save for future people.\nRather they should do what is necessary to allow future people to\ncontinue to live under just institutions. Rawls also holds that, in\nthat second stage, people ought to leave their descendants at least\nthe equivalent of what they received from the previous generation (see\nGosseries 2001 for a comparative assessment of Rawls\u2019s\nsubstantive principle). This additional claim can be supported by\negalitarian considerations (see\n \u00a74.1),\n the idea of a presumption in favor of equality (see Sidgwick 1907\n[1981: 379\u2013380], and the entry on\n equality)\n and by the considerations delineated in the next section\n (\u00a74.6).\n\nAs is characteristic of Rawls\u2019s work, he presents the just\nsavings principle as the outcome of a decision reached in the\ncontractualist (hypothetical and non-historical) decision-situation of\nthe original position. Who are the persons in the original position?\nRawls considers an original position in which every generation is\nrepresented. However, as the relations between the contractors so\nconceived are not characterized by the \u201ccircumstances of\njustice\u201d (Rawls 1971: paragraph 22), the question of justice\nas Rawls understands it does not arise: We cannot cooperate with\nprevious generations and, while previous generations can benefit or\nharm us, we cannot benefit or harm them (see\n \u00a71).[13]\n Instead Rawls therefore adjusts the (present-time of entry)\ninterpretation of the original position for the intergenerational\ncontext (Rawls 1993: 274; Rawls 2001: paragraph 25.2). The contractors\nknow that they belong to one generation, but the veil of ignorance\nblinds them to which particular generation they belong (see Gardiner\n2009: esp. 97\u2013116, and Heyd 2009a: esp. 170\u2013176, for a\ncomparative analysis of how contract theories can be extended to the\nsubject matter of intergenerational relations). From the position of\nthe original position the contractors determine a just savings\nrate.\n\nWhile the circumstances of justice clearly hold among contemporaries,\nthe contractors cannot know whether previous generations have saved\nfor them. Why then should they agree to save for future generations?\nIn A Theory of Justice (1971: 284\u2013293), Rawls stipulates \u201ca\nmotivational assumption\u201d according to which the contractors care\nfor their descendants so that they will want to agree to save for\ntheir successors\u2014irrespective of whether previous generations\nsaved for them (for criticism see, e.g., Hubin 1976/77: 70\u201383;\nEnglish 1977: 91\u2013104; Heyd 1992: 41\u201351). In Political\nLiberalism, Rawls withdraws this motivational assumption. He now\nunderstands previous generations\u2019 non-compliance with a just\nsavings principle as a problem of non-ideal theory (Rawls 1993: 274,\nfn. 12; for criticism see, e.g., Dasgupta 1994: 107\u2013108).The\noriginal position, however, belongs to ideal theory: strict compliance\nwith whatever principles are agreed on is assumed (Rawls 1971:\n144\u2013145). Rawls\nintroduces problems of partial and non-compliance only at the level of\nnon-ideal theory (Rawls 1971: ch. iv). In accordance with this understanding of ideal\ntheory, Rawls assumes that the generations are mutually disinterested.\nHe takes the contractors to agree to a savings principle \n\n\nsubject to the further condition that they must want all\nprevious generations to have followed it. \n\n\nRawls continues: \n\n\nThus the correct principle is that which the members of any generation\n(and so all generations) would adopt as the one their generation is to\nfollow and as the principle they would want preceding generations to\nhave followed (and later generations to follow), no matter how far\nback (or forward) in time. (Rawls 1993: 274; Rawls 2001: 160) \n\n\nThe principle of just savings thus agreed on is thought to be binding\nfor all previous and future generations.\n4.6 Limits of a Rights-Based Account: Duties Towards the Future\n\nA sufficientarian interpretation of the threshold notion of harm\n(together with an appropriate conception of wrongdoing) seems to\nprovide us with a plausible understanding of what is owed to future\npeople: the fact that future persons\u2019 existence is contingent on\nour present decisions does not matter where what is in question is our\nability to harm future people\u2019s interests and to violate their\nrights. By employing a non-comparative notion of harm one can justify\nthe present generation\u2019s duties not to violate the rights of\nfuture generations against being harmed. Accordingly, rights-based\nconsiderations may not bear merely upon \u201csame people\nchoices\u201d, but will bear also upon both types of \u201cdifferent\npeople choices\u201d that Parfit distinguishes, namely \u201csame\nnumber choices\u201d (in which the same number of future people live,\nirrespective of present choices) and \u201cdifferent number\nchoices\u201d (in which a different number of future people will live\ndepending on which choices we now make) (Parfit 1984: 355\u2013356).\nThus, intergenerational sufficientarianism allows us to specify the\nconsiderations of justice relevant for decisions concerning population\npolicies: Future people have rights vis-\u00e0-vis us that reflect\nconsiderations of justice as specified by intergenerational\nsufficientarianism. Our correlative duties set a normative framework\nfor most of our decisions concerning future people, including those\nthat have an impact on their number and identity.\n\nHowever, such a framework does not provide a complete moral theory of\nintergenerational relations and especially not in the context of\ndecisions on the existence, number, and identity of future people.\nThere are concerns for future people that cannot be accounted for by\nrights-based considerations (Jonas 1979; Heyd 1992 and 2009a;\nDe-Shalit 1995: ch. 1; Meyer 1997; Thompson 2009; Scheffler 2013:\n60\u201363, 72\u201373,80\u201381; Sanklecha 2017a, 2017b). First,\nconsider the notion that it is important that there be future people\nat all. However, a person-affecting intergenerational\nsufficientarianism will account for the asymmetry of our procreational\nduties (see\n \u00a72.2):\n On the one hand, prospective parents should refrain from procreation\nout of regard for the child(ren) they would have if the life of their\nchild(ren) would fall below the relevant sufficientarian threshold. On\nthe other hand, people have no obligation to procreate out of regard\nfor the interests of possible future children. Possible people have no\nright to be brought into existence (and we do not have the correlative\nobligation to procreate).\n\nSecond, consider the claim that future people should have a life that\nis well above the level of well-being specified by a threshold notion\nof harm. According to the Shift Thesis (introduced in\n \u00a74.3)\n intergenerational sufficientarianism is compatible with denying that\npeople have above-threshold justice claims and with understanding\nthese claims as less weighty justice\n claims.[14]\n The second concern, in part, reflects a third concern, namely the\nnotion that future people should be able to share (at least certain\naspects of) the particular way of life of currently living people.\nBut, presumably, currently living people do not violate the rights of\nfuture people by failing to sustain particularly valuable aspects of\ntheir way of life for them. Thus, if we take into account all three of\nthe above restrictions, intergenerational sufficientarianism may\nspecify no reason for preferring a future with people all of whom have\nlives far above the level of a sufficiency threshold to a future with\nno\n people.[15]\n\nClearly, considerations based on the rights of future people cannot or\ncannot fully account for all the concerns we might have for future\npeople. What considerations besides rights-based considerations can\nguide us in our relations to future people? It has been suggested that\nthe widely shared concerns about the continuation of human life on\nearth at a high level of well-being can, at least in part, be\naccounted for by an obligation toward future people that have no\ncorrelatives in future people\u2019s rights vis-\u00e0-vis current\npeople. This obligation reflects those widely shared concerns about\nfuture people which cannot be accounted for by rights-based\nconsiderations. The obligation can be described along the following\nlines (Baier 1981; Meyer 2005: chs. 4 and 5; Thompson 2009): those\ncurrently alive owe respect to highly valuable goods that their\npredecessors bequeathed to them as well as to more remote future\npeople, and they also owe respect to the highly valuable\nfuture-oriented projects of their contemporaries. Owing such respect\ngives rise to a general obligation, namely that current people should\nnot willfully destroy the inherited goods and the conditions that are\nconstitutive of persons\u2019 pursuit of future-oriented projects. In\nother words, such respect gives rise to a general obligation that one\nnot willfully destroy the social practices on which the possibility of\npeople pursuing future-oriented projects depends. While future people\nbelong to the beneficiaries, the obligation is owed to both present\nand past people (see also\n \u00a75.4).\n5. The Significance of Past Wrongdoing\n\nIntergenerational justice concerns the relations between generations.\nThis section discusses the three issues that have been central to the\nphilosophical investigation of the relations between past people and\ncurrently living people and to understanding the significance of what\nhappened in the past (and, in particular, of past wrongs) for\ncurrently living (and future) people\u2019s justice claims: First,\nhow can currently living people be understood to be negatively\naffected by historical injustices? Second, can the ongoing effect of\npast wrongs become legitimate when circumstances change? And, thirdly,\nwe need to address the question of the moral status of deceased\npersons and dead victims of injustice in particular.\n5.1 Non-Identity-Problem and Claims to Compensation\n\nConcerning the first issue the non-identity-problem can be relevant:\nhow can individuals today have a just claim to compensation owing to\nwhat was done to others in the past when the (potential) claimants may\nnot exist today had past people not suffered these harms (Morris 1984;\nKumar & Silver 2004; Kershnar 2004: 70\u201375; Meyer 2004b and\n2013)? For\n example,[16]\n do African Americans, whose ancestors were subjected to the terrible\ninjustices of being kidnapped in Africa and subsequently enslaved,\nhave a just claim to compensation? (See, e.g., Bedau 1972; Boxill 1984\n[1992]; Brooks 1999: parts 6 and 7; Soyinka 1999: 44\u201369;\nFullinwider 2000; Lyons 2004b; Miller & Kumar [eds] 2007) Let us\nset aside a host of specifically legal questions concerning, for\nexample, the statute of limitations and liability. Let us also assume\nthat it is sometimes possible to identify with certainty direct\ndescendants of enslaved people. Consider the case of Robert, who has\nbeen identified as one such person (see Fishkin 1991: 91\u201393).\nPeople can claim compensation for harms they suffered. As a descendant\nof enslaved people, has Robert been harmed owing to the injustices\nsuffered by his ancestors?\n\nFirst, consider briefly the common understanding of harm, namely the\nsubjunctive-historical understanding (see\n \u00a73.1).\n According to this interpretation of harm, a person can be understood\nto be fully compensated for an act or policy (or event) when she is as\nwell off as she would have been had the act not been carried out.\nAccording to this interpretation of harm, it is not the case that\nRobert has been harmed by his ancestors\u2019 having been kidnapped\nand enslaved. If his ancestors had not been kidnapped and enslaved,\nRobert would not exist today. His existence depends on the fact that\nthe genealogical chain was not broken at any point. Hence, the initial\nkidnapping in Africa, the transport to America, and the slavery of his\nancestors are necessary conditions for Robert\u2019s having come into\nexistence at all. He would not have been better off had his ancestors\nnot been badly wronged. Thus, we cannot rely upon this interpretation\nof harm and its accompanying interpretations of compensation in\nclaiming that Robert has been harmed and should be compensated; the\nrequired state of affairs under this interpretation implies the\nnonexistence of the claimant to\n compensation.[17]\n\nTo this claim we can respond in a number of ways. As suggested by our\ndiscussion in\n section 3\n and\n section 4\n we can allow for an identity-independent notion of harm in addition\nto the common identity-dependent notion of harm. Consider the\nthreshold notion of harm at\n (III).\n Under this interpretation of harm, a person can be understood to be\nfully compensated for an act or policy (or event) if that person does\nnot fall below the specified standard. According to this\ninterpretation, Robert can be harmed because his ancestors were\nkidnapped and enslaved. Whether Robert has been harmed due to the way\nhis ancestors were treated depends upon whether the way they were\ntreated has led to Robert\u2019s falling below the specified standard\nof well-being. That this is true in the case of Robert, however, will\nturn on a causal link between the past injustices and his\ncurrent state of well-being. Employing this interpretation of\nharm and its accompanying interpretation of compensation requires a\nforward-looking assessment of what others ought to do today in terms\nof providing compensation for past\n injustice.[18]\n By providing measures of compensation they ought to counteract the\nconsequences of past wrongs in such a way that the indirect currently\nliving and future indirect victims are as well off as they ought to\nbe. When we analyze historical claims on the basis of such a threshold\nnotion of harm, the current (and future) normative relevance of past\nwrongs will depend upon their causal relevance for the well-being of\ncurrently living (and future) generations. Fulfilling our duties to\nboth the latter might well require compensation for the consequences\nthat stem from the fact that their predecessors have been badly\nwronged. That their predecessors were wronged, however, does not in\nitself (independently from its particular consequences) give rise to\njust claims of compensation on the part of their descendants\ntoday.\n5.2 The Common Understanding of Harm and Compensation for Past Injustices\n\nThe common understanding of harm (see\n \u00a73.1)\n can be relevant for the justification of measures of compensation for\npast injustices. First, the non-identity-problem does not arise with\nrespect to surviving victims of wrongs. The harm done to surviving\nvictims can be understood in accordance with the common understanding\nof harm: the past wrongdoing caused these people to be worse off than\nthey would have been in the absence of that act or policy. These\nindividuals would be fully compensated for the harm done to them where\nit the case that as a result of compensation undertaken they are as\nwell off as they would be if the policy had not been carried out.\n\nSecond, consider the case of people having been wrongfully expelled\nfrom their homeland and not having received compensation for the\nwrongs inflicted upon them. For their descendants it might well be\ntrue that they would not exist had their parents and (great-)\ngrandparents not been expelled. However, the descendants can be said\nto be victims of the additional wrong that their parents did not\nreceive compensation for the wrongs inflicted upon them. The\nindividual descendants can be said to have been harmed from conception\nor birth because of the lack of sufficient compensation to their\nparents (Sher 2005; and see Butt 2006, Cohen 2009, and Herstein 2008).\nAgain, the harm done to them can be understood in accordance with the\ncommon understanding of harm: If those entities which stand under the\nobligation to provide compensation to the first generation of\ndisplaced persons do not (entirely) fulfill their obligations, they\nthereby harm the descendants of the first generation of displaced\npeople by making those descendants worse off than they would otherwise\nbe\u2014that is, if (sufficient) compensation had been provided by\nthe first generation. This line of argument can be extended to the\nsecond, third, fourth etc. generation: generation X of\ndisplaced people would be fully compensated for the harm done to them\nwere it the case that as a result of compensation undertaken the\npeople of generation X are as well off as the people of this\ngeneration would be if the first generation of displaced people had\nreceived the compensation they were entitled to. While it is clear\nthat thus understood the later generations\u2019 claims to\ncompensation do not have to contend with the non-identity-problem\n(Sher 2005), what is owed to them will depend on how best to\nunderstand the counterfactual relevant to determine the amount of\ncompensation owed.\n\nHow best to understand the relevant counterfactual is an intricate\nproblem (cf. Sher 1979, 1981). Let us take note of two issues. First,\nthe legitimacy of people\u2019s claims to compensation arguably can\ndepend upon their actions (and inactions) and the impact these have on\ntheir well-being. Of course, these actions (and inactions) can\nnormatively be attributed to people only insofar as they make the\ndecision to act (or not act) under certain conditions, for example,\nspecified in terms of rational and autonomous agency. If so, then the\nstrength of later generations\u2019 claim to compensation\u2014owing\nto the failure of providing sufficient compensation to the first\ngeneration that suffered the initial harm\u2014may wane over time.\nThe more the descendants\u2019 well-being can be attributed to\nactions or inactions for which they themselves or members of the\nintermediate generations are responsible, the less the hypothetical\nstate of affairs that would obtain had the direct victims received\nadequate compensation is relevant for the determination of the claims\nof the indirect victims (assuming we could know what that state would\nbe) (Sher 1981). This insight is likely to be of little practical\nsignificance for the claims to compensation of the first couple of\ngenerations of descendants for the direct victims. The harm done to\ntheir ancestors is not ancient. Thus, the descendants\u2019 claim to\ncompensation\u2014based on the harm inflicted on them due to the\nfailure of providing adequate compensation for the initial\nharm\u2014is likely to be strong.\n\nSecond, the claims to compensation may be thought to increase over\ntime. Historical injustices may well have resulted in ongoing\nsystemically unequal distributions of life chances due to the\ninheritance of the benefits stemming from historical injustices on the\nside of the descendants of the perpetrators (see Butt 2013). These\ndifferences can be considered relevant for how much compensation is\nowed to currently living indirect victims.\n5.3 Superseding Historical Injustices\n\nWe now turn to a second source of doubts about the validity of\nhistorical claims to reparations. Injustices committed against people\nin the past may not give rise to claims to reparations today if such\nclaims can be understood to presuppose an indefensible interpretation\nof property entitlements. Jeremy Waldron (Waldron 1992a; Waldron\n1992b: 27; Waldron 2002, 2003, 2004a; Waldron 2004b: 37; Waldron\n2006a, 2006b, 2007; Quist & Veraart 2009; see also Lyons 1977)\nargues that the view that once we acquire entitlements they continue\nuntil we transfer or relinquish them is indefensible since there are\nreasons of principle (not only pragmatic reasons for, e.g., the\nstatutes of limitations and the doctrine of adverse possession (see\nMarmor 2004: 326\u2013329)) for holding that entitlements and rights\nare sensitive to changes of circumstances that typically occur in\ntime. So-called \u201csupersession\u201d of claims owing to past\ninjustices arguably might concern different types of claims and occur\nthrough changes in several types of circumstances, which have\nconsequences for the (1) distributions of goods, (2) connections to\nspecific objects, (3) group identity, and for (4) sovereignty (Meyer\n& Waligore 2018).\n\nWaldron put forward the supersession thesis with respect to indigenous\npeoples in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and others\nhave discussed the idea in this context (Patton 2005; Sanderson 2011;\nSpinner-Halev 2012; Waligore 2016, 2017, 2018). The supersession\nthesis has also been discussed in the context of Israel/Palestine\n(Meisels 2003, 2009: ch. 2; Meyer 2004b; Gans 2008: ch. 4), Fiji\n(Carens 2000: ch. 9), and Pacific Island nations threatened by climate\nchange (Nine 2010). The supersession thesis has become influential\namong theorists both skeptical and supportive of reparations for past\ninjustice (see, for example, Kymlicka 1995: 220; Thompson 2002; R.\nHill 2002; Wenar 2006; Nine 2008;; Waligore 2009; Marmor 2004; Hendrix\n2005; Kolers 2009: ch. 3; Butt 2009: 145\u201348).\n\nAccording to Waldron, entitlement to land is based upon the idea that\nsuch entitlement can be an integral part of people\u2019s life plans\nand projects as individuals and as members of groups. Entitlements to\nland can be important for people being able to autonomously realize\nparticular goods of their way of life. When circumstances change the\nentitlement might no longer be important in that sense or decrease in\nits normative significance. For example, the entitlement of original\nowners might weaken over time if they are separated from the land.\nHaving been separated from the land, entitlement to the land might no\nlonger be important for the original owners autonomously realizing\ntheir way of life. Thus, generally speaking, entitlements are\nsensitive to background circumstances and they are vulnerable to\nprescription. As Waldron argues, property entitlement is a set of\nclaim rights, liberty rights and powers that are\n\u201ccircumstantially sensitive\u201d (Waldron 1992b: 23; see also\nLyons 1977 [1981: 370]).\n\nFurther, if legitimate entitlement is sensitive to background changes,\nit is possible that the ongoing effect of an illegitimate acquisition\nand, more generally, of unjust violations of rights of others can\nbecome legitimate when circumstances change. Waldron\u2019s primary\nexample of supersession concerns \u201cdistributive\nconsiderations\u201d. Waldron says that any plausible theory of\nproperty must be \u201ccircumstantially sensitive\u201d and\ntherefore must allow for the \u201cpossibility\u201d of supersession\n(Waldron 1992b: 25; Waldron 2004a: 67\u201371). He gives an example\nin which the violation by one group of the legitimate rights of\nanother group to a given waterhole is superseded by ecological\ncatastrophe such that the interlopers acquire a right to share what\nthey had wrongly begun to use. In these circumstances, \n\n\nthey are entitled to share that water hole. Their use of [the\nwaterhole] no longer counts as an injustice; it is now in fact part of\nwhat justice now requires. The initial injustice by [the first group]\nagainst [the second] has been superseded by circumstances. (Waldron\n2004a: 67) \n\n\nHence justice may require that original owners of land share their\nland with others and they may be required to share even with those who\nunjustly appropriated the land.\n\nEven in cases of so-called ancient historical injustice one might have\ndoubts that the conditions for supersession are fully met (Patton\n2004: 167\u2013171) (so that no historical claims continue to be\nvalid). With respect to more recent injustices the conditions for\ntheir supersession will often not be met (see Lyons 2004a: 296; Meyer\n2007: 301\u2013305). One might also doubt that supersession is to be\nunderstood as final. In order to account for the complexities of the\nreal world cases of historical injustice and their consequences it\nmight be helpful to distinguish between \u201cpartial\nsupersession\u201d and \u201cfull supersession\u201d (Meyer &\nWaligore 2018: 227\u2013228) and between \u201cfinal\nsupersession\u201d and \u201cdormant supersession\u201d (Meyer\n& Waligore 2018:\n 228\u2013229).[19]\n5.4 Surviving Duties\n\nThe considerations of\n section 5.1\n and\n section 5.2\n suggest that currently living and future people can have a just claim\nto compensation owing to what was done to others in the past. If so,\ncurrently living people ought to attempt to counteract the negative\nimpact of past wrongs for the well-being of current and future people.\nHowever, one could argue that such an interpretation of the relevance\nof past injustices is incomplete when understood as a statement of how\nwe ought to respond to the fact that past people were severely\nwronged. To many it is intuitively plausible that present generations\ncan have duties to dead victims owing to the wrongs committed against\nthem (by others) in the past. The moral significance of past wrongs\ndoes not exclusively lie in their impact on present and future\npeople\u2019s well-being; rather, the significance of past wrongs is\nalso to be seen in the fact that past people were\nvictims of these injustices. If this intuition can be defended, we\nhave duties to past generations that are grounded in past deeds. This\nwould imply that at least some aspects of historical injustice cannot\nbe accounted for by an historically informed theory of justice between\ncontemporaries (or between contemporaries and future people).\n\nTo attribute rights to dead people may seem unproblematic if we assume\nthat people continue to exist after their physical death and that they\nmay be affected by (and affect) events of this world. These\nassumptions about the ontological status of previously living people\nare, however, at least as controversial as their converse (see Mulgan\n1999: 54\u201355). Assuming that dead people cannot be bearers of\ninterests or rights and thus that those presently alive can neither\nharm nor wrong dead people, Joel Feinberg and others have discussed\ntwo alternative interpretations of posthumous harm (Boonin 2019). Both\npositions are compatible with the hypothesis that \n\n(A) \neither the deceased do not exist (a1) or, if they do exist, there\nis no connection between them and those currently alive (a2). \n\n\nAccording to the first interpretation, present generations can be said\nto owe something to surviving interests as such\u2014that is, to\ninterests that the deceased had, while alive, with respect to future\nposthumous states of affairs. However, while we have reasons to care\nabout individual people, it is not clear that we have reasons to care\nabout interests as such. According to the second (re-)interpretation\n(see Feinberg 1974 [1980]; Feinberg 1977: 301\u2013302), the\nsignificance of posthumous events is fully accounted for by the harm\nthat these events cause a person during her life. However, this\ninterpretation is not an interpretation of posthumous harm as such but\nof harm to living people that is caused by posthumous events.\nArguably, this position is not compatible with our normal\nunderstanding of the significance of posthumous events (see Gosseries\n2004: ch. iv, sects. 4\u20135).\n\nA fourth position, the position of surviving duties, is compatible\nwith presupposition (A) and does not rely on any of the criticized\nviews (see Wellman 1995: 155\u2013157; Meyer 2005: chs. 4 and 5;\nScheffler 2013: esp. 42\u201343, 52\u201353). The position of\nsurviving duties relies upon the following claims: Some rights are\nfuture-oriented in the sense that they impose duties in the future.\nSuch rights can impose surviving duties; they imply duties that are\n(also) binding after the death of the bearer of the right if the\nappropriate bearer of the duty is identified. According to this\nposition, duties survive the death of the bearer of the right. While\nthe bearer of the right no longer exists, currently living people can\nstand under the correlative duties. The notion of surviving duties\nrelies on the idea that the reasons for a person\u2019s right imply\nreasons for a correlative duty under which other people may stand even\nafter the death of the bearer of the right. If it is a moral right,\nthen these reasons will also include general social reasons which are\nrelevant not only for the bearer of the right but also for the\nbearer(s) of the surviving duty, his contemporaries (and future\npeople). For example, we all have reasons to protect people\u2019s\ntrust that promises be kept and that people have the reputation they\ndeserve. The reasons for the surviving duties also include the reasons\nthat are necessary for showing that a particular person had the moral\nright.\n\nThe idea of surviving duties rests neither on the claim that deceased\npeople can be bearers of interests or rights (contrary to the first\nposition), nor on the claim that we have reason to care about\ninterests that have no current bearers (contrary to the second\nposition). The position of surviving duties does not reject the notion\nthat currently living people can be harmed by what are to them\nposthumous events (for example, when people learn shortly before their\ndeath that a project that they deeply care about is doomed to\nfailure). However, the position of surviving duties is meant to answer\na different question, namely, whether present generations can be said\nto owe something to dead people and, in particular, to those who were\nvictims of past injustices.\n\nOne might wonder whether this interpretation of surviving duties is\ncompatible with the presupposition that dead people are bearers of\nneither interests nor rights and that they cannot be affected by the\nactions of present persons. At the very least, the position of\nsurviving duties as delineated presupposes the possibility of the\nattribution of posthumous properties and, more particularly, of their\nchange\u2014an assumption that has been defended as rather\nunproblematic (see Ruben 1988: 223\u2013231).\n5.5 Carrying Out Acts of Symbolic Compensation in Fulfilling a Surviving Duty Towards the Dead Victims\n\nDoes the theory of surviving duties contribute to an understanding of\nthe moral significance of the fact that past people\nwere severely wronged? Here we consider the notion that if\npeople (possibly as members of ongoing societies) can be said to have\nan obligation to compensate surviving and indirect victims of past\ninjustices (see\n \u00a75.1\n and\n \u00a75.2),\n they may also have an obligation symbolically to compensate dead\nvictims of past injustices, people who cannot now be affected by\nactions of currently living people (Meyer 2005: ch. 3; Meyer\n2018).\n\nLet us suppose that currently living people can stand under surviving\nduties toward past people even though they can neither change the\nvalue to them of any moment of their lives since they cannot be\naffected by what people do after their death nor can they be thought\nto be bearers of interests or rights (see\n \u00a75.4).\n If so, currently living people can act in ways that will constitute a\nviolation of the surviving duties under which they stand owing to the\nrights the deceased once held. Currently living people may be thought\nto stand under particular surviving duties toward the deceased owing\nto their future-oriented projects, the promises they made to them, or\nthe contractual obligations they entered into with them. However, not\nall people have the opportunity or the wish to have a specific impact\non posthumous states of affairs. Not all people pursue projects that\nare future-oriented in the relevant way and not all people oblige\nothers to bring about what for them are posthumous states of affairs.\nHere one suggestion is that currently living people can stand under\nsurviving duties toward dead people owing to the fact that they were\nvictims of historical injustices. In order to show that currently\nliving people can stand under such duties, one will have to assume\nthat people generally have interests with respect to posthumous states\nof affairs. Indeed, people can generally be thought to be interested\nin enjoying a good reputation both during their lifetime and\nposthumously (Meyer 2005: 99\u2013104).\n\nOn the basis of this assumption the theory of surviving duties\ncontributes to an understanding of the moral significance of the\nfact that past people were severely wronged When\npeople were violated in their rights, and badly so, their posthumous\nreputation depends upon their being publicly acknowledged as victims\nof these wrongs, and others being identified as the wrongdoers (see\nalso Margalit 2002: chs. 2\u20134). In acknowledging past individuals\nas victims of egregious wrongs we cannot affect their well-being.\nAlso, such acknowledgment cannot be expressed face to face with the\ndead victims, but only vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people in\nlight of the wrongs past people suffered. However, if it is true that\ncurrently living people stand under surviving duties toward past\nvictims of historical injustice owing to the wrongs they suffered,\nthen currently living people fulfilling the duty by publicly\nacknowledging the past injustices they suffered will change the\nrelation between them and the dead victims of historical injustice. It\nwill be true of the past victims of these injustices that they have\nthe posthumous property that currently living people fulfilled their\nsurviving duty toward them. To be sure, a change of the relation\nbetween an existent person and a dead person does not bring about a\nreal change to the latter. Rather, the relational change is based upon\nthe real change of the person who carries out the act (see Ruben 1988:\n223\u201331).\n\nFor currently living people to bring about public acknowledgment of\npast people as victims of historical injustice can require different\nmeasures under different circumstances. They can express their\nacknowledgment of past people as victims of past wrongs in an indirect\nway, namely, by providing compensation for those who are worse off\nthan they should be owing to the effects of the past injustices\nsuffered by their predecessors or by conferring benefits on living\npeople in whose well-being as members of a group we assume the dead\nvictims of past wrongs had an interest. The message of such\ncompensation can contain the acknowledgment that past people were\nvictims of past wrongs. Arguably, efforts at appropriate commemoration\nof past victims can be understood as symbolic compensation and\nrestitution.\n\nEstablishing a memorial is the typical course of action where the\neffort is made to realize the symbolic value of compensating those\nvictims who are no longer living. A memorial may be a public speech, a\nday in the official calendar, a conference, a public space or a\nmonument\u2014for example, a sculpture or an installation. Often\nthese memorials are meant to commemorate crimes that previous members\ncommitted in the name of a political society whose currently living\nmembers now want to carry out actions of public symbolic compensation\nor restitution for these crimes toward the victims and their\ndescendants. Such acts have been carried out since the 1970s in\nGermany, and there is evidence of an international practice of\nsymbolic\n compensation.[20]\n Those who carry out acts of symbolic compensation will want to\nprovide some real compensation to those who currently suffer as a\nresult of the same past wrongs, to help those who currently are\nvictims of similar injustices, and to prevent such injustices from\nhappening\n again.[21]\n The reasons for acts of symbolic compensation provide reasons for\nreal compensation where this is possible. Symbolic compensation\nbelongs to the measures likely to have the effect of providing\nsurviving victims or groups with assistance in recovering or regaining\nmembership and recognition in their respective societies, such that\nthey are once again able to lead lives under conditions of\n justice.[22]\n\nThe practice of symbolic compensation as understood here aims at\nrecognizing past people as victims of injustices without presupposing\nthat they can be current bearers of interests or rights. Insofar as\npeople generally have an interest and a just claim to enjoy the\nreputation they deserve while alive, and insofar as the reasons for\ntheir just claim can oblige us even after the bearer of the interest\nand the just claim has ceased to exist, our carrying out acts of\nsymbolic compensation can be understood as fulfilling a surviving duty\ntoward dead people who were wronged in the past, namely the duty of\nrestoring to them the posthumous reputation they deserve.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nArguments as developed in the ongoing debates on (the foundations of)\nintergenerational justice can help to justify several obligations of\ncurrently living people vis-\u00e0-vis future people and towards\npast people. Currently living people are obliged (i) not to violate\nthe rights of future generations\n (\u00a72)\n and (ii) (at least some presently living people might well be\n obliged)[23]\n to provide compensation to contemporaries with respect to harms\nvictims in the past suffered at the hands of past perpetrators\n (\u00a75).\n\nBy employing a threshold notion of harm which may be understood as a\ncentral element of a sufficientarian conception of intergenerational\njustice\n (\u00a74.4),\n but could also be an element of other substantive understandings of\nintergenerational justice\n (\u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3),\n we can justify conclusions about both types of present\ngenerations\u2019 duties. Basic needs or central capabilities are\nplausible currencies of a sufficientarian interpretation of\nintergenerational justice that relies on the threshold notion of harm\n (\u00a74.1).\n The threshold notion of harm can be understood as a constitutive\nelement of a complex understanding of harm (disjunctive notion)\n (\u00a73,\n and, in particular,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nThe special features of our relations to (remote) future\npeople\u2014especially the lack of particular knowledge, the\nimpossibility of cooperation, and the permanent asymmetry of influence\n (\u00a71)\u2014do\n not stand in the way of attributing rights to them that ground\ncorresponding duties owed by us\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73).\n The fact that past wrongs are among the necessary conditions for the\nexistence and identity of people currently alive is compatible with\nthe view that these persons have rights to compensation owing to the\nimpact of these past wrongs on their well-being, and that these rights\ncan ground corresponding duties owed by their contemporaries\n(forward-looking understanding of the significance of past injustices)\n (\u00a75.1).\n However, the Non-Identity Problem is not relevant for many indirect\nvictims\u2019 claims to compensation owing to past and historical\ninjustices\n (\u00a75.2).\n Even when we allow for the possibility of the ongoing impact of past\ninjustices to be just today, namely owing to changes of relevant\ncircumstances, we will have to investigate the extent to which the\nconditions for such a supersession of historical claims are met for\neach case. If supersession of historical claims occurs it might well\nbe partial and and for the time being, and not full and final\n (\u00a75.3).\n\nRights-based considerations of intergenerational justice bear not only\nupon \u201csame people choices\u201d but also upon both types of\n\u201cdifferent people choices\u201d that Parfit distinguishes,\nincluding what he calls \u201cdifferent number choices\u201d\n (\u00a72\n and\n \u00a73).\n However, widely shared concerns for the continuation of human life\nand at a high level of well-being cannot be accounted for solely by\nrights-based considerations\n (\u00a74.6).\n Also, the moral significance of past wrongs should not be interpreted\nsolely in terms of the impact of these injustices on present and\nfuture people\u2019s well-being. If we allow that intergenerational\nrelations are not exclusively governed by duties with correlative\nrights, the notion that we can stand under surviving duties towards\ndead people who cannot be bearers of rights vis-\u00e0-vis present\npeople\n (\u00a7\u00a75.4\u20135)\n is compatible with the forward-looking understanding of the\nsignificance of historical injustice. Also, the notion that we stand\nunder an obligation towards future people to which no rights of future\npeople correspond\u2014namely, under the obligation not to destroy\nwillfully the goods inherited from our predecessors and the conditions\nthat are constitutive of persons\u2019 pursuit of future-oriented\nprojects\n (\u00a74.6)\u2014is\n compatible with the view that we do stand under some obligations of\nintergenerational justice to which the rights of future people\ncorrespond.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Edited Collections", "Cited Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Edited Collections": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Brown, Peter G. and Douglas MacLean (eds.), 1983, <em>Energy and\nthe Future</em>, Totowa: Rowman and Littlefield.", "Dobson, Andrew (ed.), 1999, <em>Fairness and Futurity.
