    "main_text": "Some Basic Concepts\n1. Some Basic Concepts\n\nThe word \u2018dialetheism\u2019 was coined by Graham Priest and\nRichard Routley (later Sylvan) in 1981 (Priest et al 1989, p.\nxx). The inspiration for the name was a passage in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Remarks on the Foundations of\nMathematics, concerning\n Russell\u2019s paradox\n (see also below):\n\nWhy should Russell\u2019s contradiction not be conceived of as\nsomething supra-propositional, something that towers above the\npropositions and looks in both directions like a Janus head? The\nproposition that contradicts itself would stand like a monument (with\na Janus head) over the propositions of logic (1978, III.59).\n\n\nA dialetheia is a two-way truth, facing both truth and falsity like a\nJanus-headed figure. Unfortunately, Priest and Routley forgot to agree\nhow to spell the \u2018ism\u2019, and versions with and without the\n\u2018e\u2019 appear in print. \n\nIn philosophy, there tends not to be a distinction between a view\nbeing inconsistent and being incoherent. Both are\nunacceptable. Since dialetheism claims that some inconsistency can be\nmaintained without incoherence, these two concepts must be\ndisentangled. For a start, dialetheism should be distinguished from\nso-called trivialism, that claim that all sentences\nare true, and hence all contradictions are true too (Kabay 2010).\nDialetheism is the view that some contradictions are true. A\ntrivialist must be a dialetheist, since a trivialist accepts every\nclaim. But since \u2018some\u2019 does not imply \u2018all\u2019,\nthe converse is not the case: a dialetheist typically claims that only\nsome (and, usually, very specific) sentences are dialetheias, not that\nall of them are. Trivialism is by all accounts incoherent, and so is\nminimally what counts as unacceptable even for someone who thinks that\nsome contradictions are true.\n\nHow to allow inconsistency without incoherence is one of the main\ntopics of dialetheim. A standard solution consists in subscribing to\nthe view that deductive logical consequence is\n paraconsistent.\n A logical consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) is explosive if,\naccording to it, a contradiction entails everything (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet: for all \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\(A,\\neg A\n\\vdash B\\)). It is paraconsistent if and only if (iff) it is not\nexplosive. By adopting a paraconsistent logic, a dialetheist can\ncountenance some contradictions without being thereby committed to\ncountenancing everything and, in particular, all contradictions. The\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics has contributed to the most\nrecent developments (and acceptance of the legitimacy) of\ndialetheism.\n\nDialetheism should, however, be clearly distinguished from\nparaconsistency. Whereas dialetheists must embrace some paraconsistent\nlogic or other to avoid trivialism, paraconsistent logicians need not\nbe dialetheists: they may subscribe to a non-explosive view of\nentailment for other reasons. Within paraconsistency, one may\ndistinguish (at least) four grades of paraconsistent involvement\n(Beall and Restall 2006, p.80): \n\n Gentle-strength paraconsistency is simply the rejection\nof explosion with respect to logical consequence.\nFull-strength paraconsistency has it that there are\ninteresting or important theories that are inconsistent but not\ntrivial.\nIndustrial-strength paraconsistency has it that some\ninconsistent but non-trivial theories are possibly true.\nDialetheic paraconsistency has it that some inconsistent\nbut non-trivial theories are true.\n\n\nMost people working on paraconsistent logics have commitments at the\nlower grades of the spectrum. The unifying thought behind\nparaconsistency is gentle-strength: logical consequence should not\nvalidate arbitrary conclusions following indiscriminately from\ninconsistent premises. This may simply be because entailment must\npreserve more than just truth, e.g., information content, topicality,\nor some meaningful connection between premises and conclusion.\nCarnielli and Rodrigues (2019) advance an explicitly anti-dialetheic\ninterpretation of paraconsistent logic, where there may be epistemic\ncontradictions\u2014inconsistencies in evidence or belief\u2014but\nno true contradictions. Or it may be that a paraconsistent logician\nsimply need not assume anything about truth in order to provide a\nworking treatment of inconsistency as it may arise in databases, legal\nsituations, works of fiction, theory change, belief-revision, etc.\n\n\nStepping up, full-strength paraconsistentists treat inconsistent\nmodels, in which contradictions hold, as useful mathematical tools\nwithout committing to them as representing real\npossibilities. \n\nAnd stepping up again, industrial-strength paraconsistentists may hold\nthat, though truth at the actual world is consistent, still entailment\nmust preserve what holds in peculiar non-actual situations, some of\nwhich may be inconsistent (see Berto, 2007a, Ch. 5, and Priest, Beall\nand Armour-Garb, 2004, p. 6). The first three levels appear to be\nindependent of dialetheism. (But for reason to worry that there is a\n\u2018slippery slope\u2019 from gentle to dialetheic\nparaconsistency, see Priest 2000. For particular worries about model\ntheory, see Asmus 2012, and in the modal case, Martin 2015.) \n\nAt the top of the spectrum, dialethiec paraconsistency holds that some\ncontradictions are, in some sense, true in the actual world.\nEven among full-fledged dialetheists, differences remain, for example,\nin what is meant by \u201ctrue\u201d, e.g., on whether they\nsubscribe to a\n deflationary theory of truth,\n a\n correspondence view,\n a view in which true contradictions are merely semantic, or something\nelse. We will come back to this point in\n section 6\n below.\n\nWe said at the outset that dialetheism challenges the LNC.\nNow this claim needs some qualification, since forms of the LNC are,\nin fact, accepted as a general logical law in dialetheism, at least in\nversions based in e.g. the paraconsistent logic LP. Dialetheism as set\nout by Priest takes all instances of the schema \\(\\neg(A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\) to be true, as well as taking as true some sentences that are\ninconsistent with it, namely, true sentences whose negations are true:\ndialetheias. According to such versions of dialetheism, all\ncontradictions are false and some are true: dialetheism is itself a\ndialetheia (\u2018Concluding self-referential postscript\u2019 to\nPriest 1979, p. 203). \n\nMuch of the ongoing discussion about dialetheism involves not just the\nLNC but its dual, the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM). (See\n section 3.2\n below.) The LEM says (informally) that for every sentence \\(A\\),\neither \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (we bracket here views that\ndisentangle the LEM from Bivalence). Dialetheism is the thesis that\nthere are truth value gluts, challenging the LNC; the dual position,\nchallenging the LEM, is that there are truth value gaps. It is a\nsubtle issue, which we will not discuss here, whether a gap should\ncount as lacking any\n truth value,\n or as having a non-classical value distinct from both truth and\nfalsity, and similarly whether a glut has two truth values, or some\nthird \u2018glutty\u2019 value. In any case, these dual approaches\nare nowadays labelled paracomplete versus (paraconsistent)\ndialetheic theories of truth. (The paraconsistent/paracomplete\nterminology is not entirely happy: see Ripley 2015a, footnote 1; but\nis now standard.) Priest\u2019s logic includes the LEM and he rejects\nthe existence of gaps in Priest 1987/2006, ch.1. Other approaches are\nboth paracomplete and paraconsistent; they include a place for both\ngaps and gluts. The case for and against dialetheism turns as much on\nthe status of the LEM as the LNC; see Beall and Ripley 2018.\n",
