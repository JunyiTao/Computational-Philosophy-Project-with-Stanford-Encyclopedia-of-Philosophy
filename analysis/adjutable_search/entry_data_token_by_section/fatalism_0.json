Logical Fatalism: Aristotle\u2019s argument and the nature of truth\n\nThe classic argument for fatalism occurs in Aristotle (384\u2013322\nB.C.E.), De Interpretatione, chapter 9. He addresses the\nquestion of whether in relation to all questions it is necessary that\nthe affirmation or the negation is true or false.\n\nWhat he says could be presented as an argument along the following\nlines.\n\n\nSuppose that (i) p is true or p is false and (ii)\nnot-p is true or not-p is false.\n\nThen p is true or not-p is true.\n\nNow suppose that in 1900 one person says that a sea-battle will take\nplace on 1/1/2100, and another says that a sea-battle will not take\nplace on 1/1/2100.\n\nThen either what the first person says is true or what the second\nperson says is true.\n\nBut, in that case, either it is necessary in 1900 that a sea-battle\ntakes place on 1/1/2100, or it is necessary in 1900 that one does not\ntake place.\n\nBut the date of the predictions is irrelevant, and it is irrelevant\nwhether any prediction is actually made at all.\n\nSo it is necessary at all times that a sea-battle takes place on\n1/1/2100, or that a sea-battle does not take place on 1/1/2100.\n\nBut the argument can evidently be generalised.\n\nSo, everything that happens, happens of necessity.\n\n\nFirst of all we need to be clear about what is meant by\n\u201cnecessity\u201d here. What is at issue here is not logical\nnecessity. It is rather inevitability. When the occurrence of a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100 is said to be necessary at a certain date, what\nis meant is that at that date nothing can prevent a sea-battle from\ntaking place on 1/1/2100. In particular, no one has the power to\nprevent it. Now Aristotle accepts that \u201cWhat is, necessarily is,\nwhen it is; and what is not, necessarily is not, when it is\nnot.\u201d So, he accepts that, if a sea-battle is actually taking\nplace on 1/1/2100, then on 1/1/2100 it is (in this sense) taking place\nof necessity. Nothing can then stop it happening, because it is\nhappening. What this argument appears to establish, however, is that,\nif a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, not only is it necessary then\nthat a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, but it was always\nnecessary. No one could ever have prevented it. And the same applies\nto everything that can happen. So, in particular, no one ever has the\npower to do anything other that what they actually do.\n\nSo, is there anything wrong with the argument?\n\nWell certainly there is a move which seems to require some\nexplanation: the move from truth to necessity. Why should it follow\nfrom the fact that it was true in 1900 that a sea-battle would take\nplace on 1/1/2100, that it was necessary that it should? This looks,\nindeed, suspiciously like a fallacious move from \u201cOf necessity,\nif it is true that a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, a sea-battle\ntakes place on 1/1/2100\u201d to \u201cIf it is true that a\nsea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, a sea-battle takes place of\nnecessity on 1/1/2100\u201d. But such suspicions are probably\nill-founded. It is more likely that the move invokes a certain form of\nthe correspondence theory of truth: if what someone says at a certain\ntime is true, then the state of the world at that time must be such as\nto make it true. But since what is, necessarily is when it is, the\nstate of the world will be necessary. So, anything that is true is\nnecessarily true.\n\nHowever, even if this crucial move does not rest on a simple fallacy,\nthe idea that the truth of what someone says is determined by the\nstate of the world at the time is questionable. We shall return to\nthis point.\n",
