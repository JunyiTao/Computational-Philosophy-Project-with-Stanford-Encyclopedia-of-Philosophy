    "main_text": "Formal Approaches to Social Epistemology || Modeling Diversity in Epistemic Communities\n4.4 Modeling Diversity in Epistemic Communities\n\nDiversity has emerged several times in our discussion of formal social\nepistemology. Credit incentives can encourage scientists to choose a\ndiversity of problems. In network models, a transient diversity of\nbeliefs is necessary for good inquiry. Let us now turn to models that\ntackle the influence of diversity more explicitly. It has been\nsuggested that cognitive diversity benefits epistemic communities\nbecause a group where members start with different assumptions, use\ndifferent methodologies, or reason in different ways may be more\nlikely to find truth.\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon (2009) introduce a model where actors investigate\nan \u201cepistemic landscape\u201d\u2014a grid where each section\nrepresents a problem in science, of varying epistemic importance.\nFigure 2 shows an example of such a landscape. Learners are randomly\nscattered on the landscape, and follow search rules that are sensitive\nto this importance. Investigators can then ask: how well did these\nlearners do? Did they fully search the landscape? Did they find the\npeaks? And: do communities with diverse search strategies outperform\ncommunities with uniform ones?\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An epistemic landscape.\nLocation represents problem choice, and height represents epistemic\nsignificance.\n\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon argue that a combination of\n\u201cfollowers\u201d (who work on problems similar to other\nindividuals) and \u201cmavericks\u201d (who prefer to explore new\nterrain) do better than either group alone; i.e., there is a benefit\nto cognitive diversity. Their modeling choices and main result have\nbeen convincingly criticized (Alexander et al. 2015; Thoma 2015;\nPoyh\u00f6nen 2017; Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018), but the framework has been co-opted by other philosophers to\nuseful ends. Thoma (2015) and Poyh\u00f6nen (2017), for instance, show\nthat in modified versions of the model, cognitive diversity indeed\nprovides the sort of benefit Weisberg and Muldoon hypothesize.\n\nHong and Page (2004) (and following work) use a simple model to derive\ntheir famous \u201cDiversity Trumps Ability\u201d result. Agents\nface a simple epistemic landscape \u2014 a ring with some number of\nlocations on it, each associated with a number representing its\ngoodness as a solution. An agent is represented as a finite set of\nintegers, such as \u27e83, 7, 10\u27e9. Such an agent is placed on the\nring, and can move to locations 3, 7, and 10 spots ahead of their\ncurrent position, assuming it improves their position. The central\nresult is that randomly selected groups of agents who tackle the task\ntogether tend to outperform groups created of top performers. This is\nbecause the top performers have similar integers, and thus gain\nrelatively little from group membership, whereas random agents have a\ngreater variety of integers. This result has been widely cited, though\nthere have been criticisms of the model either as insufficient to show\nsomething so complicated, as lacking crucial representational\nfeatures, or as failing to show what it claims (Thompson 2014; Singer\n2019).\n\nTo this point we have addressed cognitive diversity. But we might also\nbe interested in diversity of social identity in epistemic\ncommunities. Social diversity is an important source of cognitive\ndiversity, and for this reason can benefit the functioning of\nepistemic groups. For instance, different life histories and\nexperiences may lead individuals to hold different assumptions and\ntackle different research programs (Haraway 1989; Longino 1990;\nHarding 1991; Hong and Page 2004). If so, then we may want to know:\nwhy are some groups of people often excluded from epistemic\ncommunities like those in academia? And what might we do about\nthis?\n\nIn recent work, scholars have used models of bargaining to represent\nacademic collaboration. They have shown 1) how the emergence of\nbargaining norms across social identity groups can lead to\ndiscrimination with respect to credit sharing in collaboration (Bruner\nand O\u2019Connor 2017; O\u2019Connor and Bruner 2019) and 2) why\nthis may lead some groups to avoid academia, or else cluster in\ncertain subfields (Rubin and O\u2019Connor 2018). In addition, in the\ncredit-economy tradition, Bright (2017b) and Hengel (2022) provide\nmodels showing how women may be less productive if they reasonably\nexpect more stringent criticism of their work, and react\nrationally.\n\nAs we have seen in this section, models can help explain how and when\ncognitive diversity might matter to the production of knowledge by a\ncommunity. They can also tell us something about why epistemic\ncommunities often, nonetheless, fail to be diverse with respect to\nsocial identity.\n",
