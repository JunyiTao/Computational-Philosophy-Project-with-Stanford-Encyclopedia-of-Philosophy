    "main_text": "Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2019s elimination of bound variables || The problem of substitution\n1.1 The problem of substitution\n\nClassical first-order logic includes quantifiers that are\ndenoted by \\(\\forall\\) (\u201cfor all\u201d) and \\(\\exists\\) (\u201cthere\nis a\u201d). A simple sentence such as \u201cAll birds are\nanimals\u201d may be formalized as \\(\\forall x(Bx\\supset Ax)\\), where \\(x\\)\nis a variable, \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) are one-place predicates, and \\(\\supset\\) is a\nsymbol for (material) implication. The occurrences of the variables in the\nclosed formula \\(\\forall x(Bx\\supset Ax)\\) are bound, whereas those in\nthe open formula \\(Bx\\supset Ax\\) are free. If we assume that\n\\(t\\) (for \u201cTweety\u201d) is a name constant, then an instance of the\nabove sentence is \\(Bt\\supset At\\), that may be read as \u201cTweety is an\nanimal, provided Tweety is a bird.\u201d This illustrates that the\ninstantiation of a (universal) quantifier involves substitution.\n\nDue to the simplicity of the example, the substitution of\n\\(t\\) for \\(x\\) in \\(Bx\\) and in \\(Ax\\) seems to be easy to understand and to\nperform. However, a definition of substitution for FOL (and in general, for an\nabstract syntax, that is, for a language with a variable binding operator) has\nto guarantee that no free occurrence of a variable in the substituted\nexpression becomes bound in the resulting expression.\n\nTo see what can go wrong, let us consider the (open) formula\n\\(\\forall x(Rxy\\land Rxr)\\), where \\(R\\) is a two-place predicate, \\(r\\) \nis a name constant abbreviating \u201cRussell\u201d and \\(\\land\\) is\nconjunction.  \\(\\forall x(Rxy\\land Rxr)\\) contains a free occurrence\nof \\(y\\) (that is, \\(y\\) is a free variable of the formula), however, \\(y\\)\nis not free for a substitution of a term that contains a free occurrence\nof \\(x\\), for instance, \\(x\\) itself. More formally, the occurrence\nof \\(y\\) in the second argument place of \\(R\\) in \n\\(\\forall x(Rxy\\land Rxr)\\) is not bound by a quantifier (the only quantifier)\nof the formula, whereas \\(\\forall x(Rxx\\land Rxr)\\) is a closed formula, that\nis, it contains no free occurrences of variables.  Informally, the following\nnatural language sentences could be thought of as interpretations of the\nprevious formulas. \u201cEverybody reads him and Russell,\u201d (where\n\u2018him\u2019 is deictic, or perhaps, anaphoric) and \u201cEverybody\nreads himself and Russell.\u201d Obviously, the meanings of the two sentences\nare vastly different, even if we assume that everybody pens something. As\na contrast, \\(\\forall x(Rxw\\land Rxr)\\) exhibits an unproblematic substitution\nof the name constant \\(w\\) for the free occurrence of \\(y\\). (The latter\nformula, perhaps, formalizes the sentence \u201cEverybody reads Ludwig\nWittgenstein and Russell.\u201d) These examples are meant to demonstrate the\nmore complex part of the problem Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel set out to solve,\nand for what he invented\n CL.[1]\n",
