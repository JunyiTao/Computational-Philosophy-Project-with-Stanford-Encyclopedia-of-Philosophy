    "main_text": "Soul and Body\n7. Soul and Body\n\nFor Leibniz, \u201cI\u201d am a substance, and my mind, as a\n\u201cdominant monad,\u201d rules over, or expresses more distinctly\nthan they do,the subordinate monads composing my body. Thus all\nhappenings in all parts of the body are felt distinctly or\nindistinctly, the sensory organs collect and concentrate the\nimpressions of the external world, and the soul experiences them.\nThough commentators disagree over whether the referent of\n\u201cI\u201d is a corporeal substance \u2014 a soul-body composite\n\u2014 since Leibniz did not believe separated souls without organic\nbodies were possible \u2014 or, alternatively, a single dominant\nmonad, an immaterial substance outside space and time, \u201cI\u201d\nassuredly named a thing that was indivisible and imperishable (G 6:\n598\u2013600). Kant eschews dogmatism both with respect to whether\nthe soul is an immaterial substance and whether it is immortal. The\nuse of the term \u201cI\u201d presupposes that my thoughts and\nperceptions are experienced as bound up together and as belonging to a\nsingle entity. Matter, with its properties of extension,\nimpenetrability, etc., cannot be conceived as producing thought. But\nmatter is only an appearance; whatever supersensible thing it is that\ngives rise to the appearance of matter, that thing may well be the\nsame as whatever supersensible thing it is that gives rise to the\nexperience of an experiencing self (KRV A 358f/B 428f).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of soul-body pre-established harmony set out in\nhis New System of the Nature and the Communication of\nSubstances of 1695 is not easy to reconcile with the\ninterpretation of his monadology according to which what we call\nbodies are appearances in visual space founded upon spiritual\nsubstances lying underneath the spatio-temporal order. Yet the\npre-established harmony was at least consistent with Leibniz\u2019s\nclaim that substances do not interact with one another and that what\nwe call \u201ccausal interaction\u201d does not involve a flow of\npower or force, but merely a regular sequence of changes in two\nobservable things, in the case of mind and body, the experiences of\nperception and appetition and states of the sensory organs (G\n4:76\u20137). Kant points to the tension between the theory of\npre-established harmony and the monadology; \u201cWhy should one\nadmit bodies, if it is possible that everything happens in the soul as\na result of its own powers, which would run the same course even if\nentirely isolated?\u201d (8:249).\n\nKant initially preferred \u201cinflux\u201d theories of soul-body\nrelations to the \u201cparallelist\u201d theories of occasionalism\nand pre-established harmony, but he eventually decided that dualism\nwas incoherent. Already in the Measurement of Living Forces,\nhe was grappling with the problem of the location of the soul and the\nnature of its action. Anatomists had long speculated that some region\nof the brain, e.g., the pineal gland (Descartes 1650) or the corpus\ncallosum (Euler 1763), was the site of interaction between soul and\nbody. For a time, Kant seems to have believed that souls were\npositioned in space and could act outside themselves and be acted upon\nby bodies. Later he became convinced that souls were not localized in\nspace, though they could effect changes, deciding that that neither\nmedicine nor metaphysics could illuminate the question. He denies that\nwe can understand the entry of the soul into body at conception or its\nrelation to the body throughout life, or its exit and separate\nexistence after death. Because all our experience is experience of\nourselves as living beings \u2014 when soul and body are bound\ntogether \u2014 we cannot know what a separated soul would\nexperience. Leibniz compared existence after death to a deep sleep or\na swoon, but to investigate these matters is, Kant says, like standing\nbefore a mirror with your eyes closed to see what you look like when\nyou are asleep (20:309).\n",
