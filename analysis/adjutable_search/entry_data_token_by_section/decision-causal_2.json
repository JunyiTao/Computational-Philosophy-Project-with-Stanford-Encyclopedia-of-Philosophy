    "main_text": "History || Newcomb\u2019s Problem\n2.1 Newcomb\u2019s Problem\n\nRobert Nozick (1969) presented a dilemma for decision theory. He\nconstructed an example in which the standard principle of dominance\nconflicts with the standard principle of expected-utility\nmaximization. Nozick called the example Newcomb\u2019s Problem after\nthe physicist, William Newcomb, who first formulated the problem.\n\nIn Newcomb\u2019s Problem an agent may choose either to take an\nopaque box or to take both the opaque box and a transparent box. The\ntransparent box contains one thousand dollars that the agent plainly\nsees. The opaque box contains either nothing or one million dollars,\ndepending on a prediction already made. The prediction was about the\nagent\u2019s choice. If the prediction was that the agent will take\nboth boxes, then the opaque box is empty. On the other hand, if the\nprediction was that the agent will take just the opaque box, then the\nopaque box contains a million dollars. The prediction is reliable. The\nagent knows all these features of his decision problem.\n\nFigure 1 displays the agent\u2019s options and their outcomes. A row\nrepresents an option, a column a state of the world, and a cell an\noption\u2019s outcome in a state of the world.\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\n\none-boxing\nPrediction\n\ntwo-boxing \n\nTake one box\n\\(\\$M\\)\n\\(\\$0\\) \n\nTake two boxes\n\\(\\$M + \\$T\\)\n\\(\\$T\\) \n\n\nFigure 1. Newcomb\u2019s Problem\n\n\nBecause the outcome of two-boxing is better by \\(\\$T\\) than the\noutcome of one-boxing given each prediction, two-boxing dominates\none-boxing. Two-boxing is the rational choice according to the\nprinciple of dominance. Because the prediction is reliable, a\nprediction of one-boxing has a high probability given one-boxing.\nSimilarly, a prediction of two-boxing has a high probability given\ntwo-boxing. Hence, using conditional probabilities to compute expected\nutilities, one-boxing\u2019s expected utility exceeds\ntwo-boxing\u2019s expected utility. One-boxing is the rational choice\naccording to the principle of expected-utility maximization.\n\nDecision theory should address all possible decision problems and not\njust realistic decision problems. However, if Newcomb\u2019s problem\nseems untroubling because unrealistic, realistic versions of the\nproblem are plentiful. The essential feature of Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem is an inferior act\u2019s correlation with a good state that\nit does not causally promote. In realistic, medical Newcomb problems,\na medical condition and a behavioral symptom have a common cause and\nare correlated although neither causes the other. If the behavior is\nattractive, dominance recommends it although expected utility\nmaximization prohibits it. Also, Allan Gibbard and William Harper\n(1978: Sec. 12) and David Lewis (1979) observe that a Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma with psychological twins poses a Newcomb problem for each\nplayer. For each player, the other player\u2019s act is a state\naffecting the outcome. Acting cooperatively is a sign, but not a\ncause, of the other player\u2019s acting cooperatively. Dominance\nrecommends acting uncooperatively, whereas expected utility computed\nwith conditional probabilities recommends acting cooperatively. In\nsome realistic instances of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the\nplayers\u2019 anticipated similarity of thought creates a conflict\nbetween the principle of dominance and the principle of\nexpected-utility maximization.\n\nArif Ahmed (2018) offers a collection of essays on Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem. Kenny Easwaran (forthcoming) distinguishes Newcomb-like problems\naccording to opportunities for causal intervention.\n",
