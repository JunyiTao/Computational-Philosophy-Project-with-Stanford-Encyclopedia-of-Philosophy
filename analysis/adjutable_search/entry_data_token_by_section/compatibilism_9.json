    "main_text": "Compatibilism in Transition || The Consequence Argument\n3.1 The Consequence Argument\n\nThis argument invokes a compelling pattern of inference (one that is\nperhaps lurking in the background of the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument) regarding claims about what is power necessary for\na person. Power necessity, as applied to true propositions (or facts),\nconcerns what is not within a person\u2019s power. Or, put\ndifferently, it concerns facts that a person does not have power over.\nTo say that a person does not have power over a fact is to say\nthat she cannot act in such a way that the fact would not obtain.\nTo illustrate, no person has power over the truths of mathematics.\nThat is, no person can act in such a way that the truths of\nmathematics would be false. Hence, the truths of mathematics are, for\nany person, power necessities.\n\nThe intuitive pattern of inference applied to these claims is this. If\na person has no power over a certain fact, and if she also has no\npower over the further fact that the original fact has some other fact\nas a consequence, then she also has no power over the consequent fact.\nPowerlessness, it seems, transfers from one fact to its consequences.\nFor example, if poker-playing Diamond Jim, who is holding only two\npairs, has no power over the fact that Calamity Sam draws a straight\nflush, and if a straight flush beats two pairs (and assuming Jim has\nno power to alter this fact), then it follows that Jim has no power\nover the fact that Sam\u2019s hand beats Jim\u2019s. This general\npattern of inference is applied to the thesis of causal determinism to\nyield a powerful argument for incompatibilism. The argument requires\nthe assumption that determinism is true, and that the facts of the\npast and the laws of nature are fixed. Given these assumptions, here\nis a rough, non-technical sketch of the argument:\n\nNo one has power over the facts of the past and the laws of\nnature.\nNo one has power over the fact that the facts of the past and the\nlaws of nature entail every fact of the future (i.e., determinism is\ntrue).\nTherefore, no one has power over the facts of the future.\n\n\nAccording to the Consequence Argument, if determinism is\ntrue, it appears that no person has any power to alter how her own\nfuture will unfold.\n\nThis argument shook compatibilists, and rightly so. The classical\ncompatibilists\u2019 failure to analyze statements of an\nagent\u2019s abilities in terms of counterfactual conditionals left\nthe compatibilists with no perspicuous retort to the crucial second\npremise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument. And the Consequence\nArgument provides powerful support for this argument\u2019s second\npremise. If, according to the Argument, determinism implies that the\nfuture will unfold in only one way given the past and the laws, and if\nno one has any power to alter its unfolding in that particular way,\nthen it seems that no one can do other than she does.\n\nIt is fair to say that the Consequence Argument earned the\nincompatibilists an important dialectical advantage. Compatibilists\nowe us an account of what\u2019s was wrong with the Consequence\nArgument, and perhaps also, some positive account of the ability to do\notherwise. So even though many compatibilists are committed to\nthinking that the Consequence Argument is unsound, it nevertheless set\nthe agenda for many contemporary compatibilist theories of free will\nand moral responsibility.\n",
