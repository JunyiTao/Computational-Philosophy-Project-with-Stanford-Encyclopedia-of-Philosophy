    "main_text": "The History of Philosophical Problems\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an\nintervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian\nmovement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the\nmaterialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the\nrelation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is\ncapable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a\nquaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it\nseems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that\ncritical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the\nproject of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to\ndo with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not\nprovide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881:\n140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be\nanswered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they\ndepend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims\nabout the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an\nunscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular\npurposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a\nscience, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from\nformulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of\nworld-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to\nprovide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification\n(1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and\nthe Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing\ncircumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not\ninconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a\nrevision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its\n\u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its\npositive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more\npositive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a\nre-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least\npartly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird\nphase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nand attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in\nmore detail that the third Critique forms\nthe core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical\nproject can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of\nworld-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one\nhundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the\nrelation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question\nhow the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be\nthe \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now\nsees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility\nof solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive\nsystem of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human\nhistory. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and\nhistory in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a:\n162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a\nshift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science\nclassification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and\nidiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even\nincommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word:\n\u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last,\nincommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d\n(1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization\nprovides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical\nsciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical\nphilosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp\nand express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality\n(1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value\ncontent in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in\nso doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational\nvalues\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is\nnot determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a\nhistorical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing\nspecies, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see\nalso 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a\ngoal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate\nover how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on\nboard, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization\nof reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological\nmethod that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His\n\u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d\n[\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of\n1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian\nlanguage. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the\nunity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be\nfound \n\n\nby grasping the essence of the function \u2026 which is common for\nall the particular \u2026cultural activities: and this can be\nnothing else than the self-consciousness of reason which produces its\nobjects and in them the realm of validity itself. (1910b: 293).\n\n",
