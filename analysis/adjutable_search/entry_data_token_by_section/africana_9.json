    "main_text": "1950\u2013Present: Professional Philosophers of African Descent\n10. 1950\u2013Present: Professional Philosophers of African Descent\n\n\nUntil quite recently, there were very few person of African descent\nwho were professionals in the discipline of Philosophy. As already noted, W.E.B. Du\nBois was one of a very few to study Philosophy formally while a student\nat Harvard but decided against pursuing it professionally. Alain Leroy\nLocke was one of the first persons of African descent in America to\nearn a doctoral degree in Philosophy (Harvard University, 1918). A few\nmore followed decades later (1950s), among them Broadus N. Butler, Max\nWilson, Berkeley Eddins, and, still later, Joyce Mitchell Cook, the\nfirst African American female to earn a Ph. D. in Philosophy. These\nwere some of the pioneering persons of African descent in the United\nStates who entered the profession of academic Philosophy with the\ncertification of a terminal degree in the discipline.\n\n\nMore recently (late 1960s through the 1970s) successive generations of\npersons of African descent have entered the profession as cohorts of\nnew generations of young Black women and men entered the academy with\nthe expansion of opportunities for higher education that came as a\nresult of the successes of the desegregation-integration and Civil\nRights Movements. More than a few of these persons were influenced by\nthe Black Power, Black Consciousness, and Black Arts Movements, as\nwell, and in some cases by independence and decolonization movements\non the African continent and in the African Diaspora in the\nCaribbean. The emergence of and pursuit of distinctive agendas within\nacademic Philosophy to articulate and study philosophizings by persons\nAfrican and of African descent were initiated by several of the new\nentrants, agendas that grew out of and were motivated by these\nmovements. Thus, the new entrants were determined to contribute as\neducators, sometimes as engaged intellectuals involved in movement\norganizations, by identifying and contributing to, or by helping to\nforge anew, philosophical traditions, literatures, and practices\nintended, in many instances, to be distinctive of the thought- and\nlife-agendas of Black peoples. Here, then, the wellspring of concerns\nand aspirations that gave rise to calls for, and efforts to set out,\n\u201cBlack\u201d philosophy, then \u201cAfro-American,\u201d and\nlater \u201cAfrican American\u201d philosophy, precursive efforts\nleading to what is now the more or less settled name, but\nstill developing concept, of\nAfricana philosophy.\n\n\nFormal, professional recognition and sanctioning of these efforts,\nwhich had been pursued, with significant impact, through presentations\nof papers on and discussions of various topics in sessions during\nannual meetings of divisions of the American Philosophical Association\n(APA) and other organizations of professional philosophers and other organizations of\nteacher-scholars such as the Radical Philosophers Association (RPA) and\nthe Society for Phenomenological and Existential Philosophy (SPEP),\nwere achieved when, in 1987, the APA recognized the efforts as\nhaving established a legitimate sub-field of Philosophy and made\n\u201cAfricana philosophy\u201d an officially listed specialty in the\ndiscipline. Across the years, the APA\u2019s Committee on\nBlacks in Philosophy has been instrumental in organizing a number of\nthese important sessions, though, of no less importance, many such\nsessions were hosted by other sympathetic and supportive committees of\nthe APA as well as by other organizations of professional\nphilosophers that held meetings concurrent with those of divisions of\nthe Association. Thus, the recognition and sanction have come, to\nsignificant degrees, as results of long efforts led by philosophers\nRobert C. Williams (deceased), William Jones, Howard McGary, Jr., and\nLa Verne Shelton, among others, each of whom gave years of service as\nchairpersons of the APA\u2019s Committee on Blacks in\nPhilosophy. Each also contributed early articulations that initiated\nthe work of forging the sub-field.\n\n\nAlso of special importance to this long development towards\nrecognition and legitimation, and to the production of much of the\nearly writings, presentations, and critical networking collegiality\nthat have been foundational to the development of Africana philosophy,\nwere a series of conferences devoted to explorations of \u201cBlack\nPhilosophy\u201d or of \u201cPhilosophy and the Black\nExperience\u201d that were held during the 1970s, most of them\norganized and hosted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities\n(HCBUs: notably, Tuskegee University, Morgan State University, and\nHoward University) though important gatherings were also held at the\nUniversity of Illinois-Chicago Circle (ca 1970, another thirty\nyears later), Haverford College (an international gathering in the\nsummer of 1982 of African and African American philosophers and\nteacher-scholars from other disciplines), and, more recently, at the\nUniversity of Memphis. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the\nPhilosophy Born of Struggle Conference, which has been hosted annually\nfor fifteen years primarily through the indefatigable efforts of J.\nEveret Green and Leonard Harris, and the Alain Locke Conference\norganized and hosted biannually by the Department of Philosophy of\nHoward University (Washington, DC).\n\n\nThe development and institutionalization of African American\nphilosophy, of Africana philosophy more generally, with recognition by\nthe American Philosophical Association\u2014though not by all, or\neven most, departments of Philosophy in academic\ninstitutions\u2014have also been facilitated by the noteworthy\nsuccess of many of the pioneers in securing and retaining positions in\nacademic departments (of Philosophy, of Philosophy and Religion, of\nPhilosophy and other disciplines) in various institutions of higher\neducation across the country. A substantial few of these persons have\nearned tenure and promotions, several to the rank of Professor, while\nseveral have even been appointed to endowed\nprofessorships. Consequently, a slowly increasing number of\nphilosophers who are African or of African descent now hold positions\nin departments and programs that serve graduate and professional\nstudents. Of importance, then, have been the growing number of\nlectures and seminars in colleges and universities across the country\ngiven and directed by philosophers of African descent in response to\ninvitations, and as part of regular curricular offerings,\nrespectively, of departments of Philosophy, often with the cooperation\nand co-sponsorship of other departments and programs. These invited\npresentations and regularized curricular offerings reconfirm and\nstrengthen the intellectual legitimacy of much work in Africana\nphilosophy while doing much the same for the invited and teaching\nphilosophers.\n\n\nOne especially significant consequence of these important developments\nis that several of these persons now have built legacies of teaching\nand scholarship that span decades with significant influences on\ngenerations of students. Practitioners of Africana philosophy are even\nproducing new generations of practitioners. And practitioners of all\ngenerations are contributing to the literature of articulate\nexpression of what is now a substantial and growing body of works\nsupporting teaching, research, and scholarship in Africana philosophy\nwhile, in the process of doing so, also initiating, and otherwise\ncontributing to, substantial changes to discursive agendas. Certainly,\nthe example beyond debate continues to be critical explorations\nof race and of \u201cracism,\u201d matters that have\ndistorted the basic institutions, virtually all considerations and\npractices, and all lives across the entirety of the history of the\nUnited States of America, and that of much of the world. However, it\nwas not until philosophers of African descent focused their\nphilosophizing on critical engagements with the racial conditionings\nof the profession and of life generally that discussions, teaching,\nand scholarship within professional Philosophy were opened to and\nconditioned by new critical discursive agendas affecting numerous\nsubfields within the discipline and the organization of the\nprofession, evident in the surge of writings by philosophers African\nand of African descent published in mainstream journals and by\nmainstream publishers.\n\nRace Matters by Cornel West (1994) became the national and\ninternational best-seller that propelled West into prominence as an\nacademic philosopher and preacher-become-public intellectual who\ncontributed to reinvigorated public critiques of racism with\nprofessionally attuned philosophical acumen. Yet, his earlier\npublication Prophesy Deliverance! An Afro-American Revolutionary\nChristianity (1982) had even greater impacts on discourses within\nthe academic disciplines of Philosophy, Theology, and\nReligion/Religious Studies, in particular. Of especially notable\ninfluence were his genealogy of racism and his sketching out of four\ndistinctive traditions of responsive thought generated by Black\nthinkers. West\u2019s genealogical critique drew on several canonical\nfigures (Nietzsche, Michel Foucault) and was thus emblematic of his\nexpansive learnedness and creative ingenuity in drawing on canonical\nfigures to redirect critical thought back upon the social orders and\nhistory-making practices of those subjecting folks of African descent,\nand others, to dehumanization.\n\n\nOthers contributing to and shaping such critiques include Howard\nMcGary, whose Race and Social Justice (1999) brought together\na number of seminal essays in which he explored moral and political\nquestions regarding race and racism in a new and distinctive (and\ndistinctively embodied) voice among practitioners of Analytic\nPhilosophy, a voice concerned with social justice, with issues of\nequity and inclusion especially, while drawing on and highlighting\nlived experiences of African Americans conditioned unjustly and\nimmorally. For McGary, philosophical work was no longer to be confined\nto analysis restricted to \u2018getting the terms\nright\u2019. Rather, having lived experiences of invidious racial\ndiscrimination and impediments to accessing and exploiting conditions\nof possibility by which Black persons might forge individual and\ngroup-shared flourishing lives, across generations, McGary has\nremained committed to disciplined, well-argued clarifications and\nrevisions of key notions by which to pursue and secure social justice,\nmost especially for those \u201cleast well off\u201d: the\nBlack underclass.\n\n\nContinuing such efforts, in a different register, with substantial and\ninnovative contributions is Paul Taylor (who studied with McGary at\nRutgers University). His Race: A Philosophical Introduction\nstands out as an especially clearly-articulated, nuanced, clarifying\nnavigation of many of the complexities of conceptualizations\nof race firmly situated in reconstructions of historical\npractices guided by political and other agendas. Yet, it is\nTaylor\u2019s Black is Beautiful: A Philosophy of Black\nAesthetics that is especially noteworthy. It is, perhaps, the\nfirst-in-decades book-length \u201cassembling\u201d (Taylor\u2019s\nown characterization of his effort) of a\ndeliberately philosophical theory of Black aesthetics: that\nis, a critical theoretical exploration of the roles expressive\npractices and objects play when taken up by Black folks in the\ncreation and maintenance of their lifeworlds. (The philosopher Alain\nLeroy Locke, midwife to the New Negroes of the Harlem Renaissance,\npreceded Taylor by half-a-century in taking seriously Black expressive\nlife, as did W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, James\nBaldwin, Toni Morrison, and numerous others.) Taylor\u2019s efforts\nare doubly innovative in his endeavor to bridge two discursive\ncommunities heretofore not in communication: professional\nphilosophers, and others, concerned with aesthetics who have had\nlittle to no concern with aesthetics in Black life; Black artists and\ncritics fully immersed in the productions of and engagements with\nexpressive practices and objects in Black life with little to no\nengagements with resources drawn from academic, professional\nPhilosophy. As did Alain Locke, Taylor aims to contribute to a new\ngeneration of articulate thinkers who are focusing their critical\nacumen on the expressivity and performativity in productions of self,\nand of self in relations with others, of those who have been\nracialized as Black.\n\n\nBut, how have folks African and of African descent been figured in the\nexpressive practices and products, and in the theorizings of such\naesthetic ventures, produced, in both cases, by folks not Black?\nRobert Gooding-Williams is but one of several philosophers of African\ndescent who probes these questions in his Look, A Negro!\nPhilosophical Essays on Race, Culture and Politics (2006), a\ncollection of essays connected, he notes, by his persistent effort to\nexplore whether it is possible to interpret race in ways that\nwould be in keeping with what is required in political and cultural\nlife if the United States as a polity were to become actually\nstructured by democratic principles and practices while adult citizens\nfully acknowledge the history and continuing legacies of White racial\nsupremacy that have structured the polity from its inception. In the\nchapter on \u201cAesthetics and Receptivity: Kant, Nietzsche, Cavell,\nand Astaire,\u201d for example, Gooding-Williams rehearses accounts\nof aesthetic experiences by the canonic figures Kant (re:\n\u201caesthetic judgment\u201d) and Nietzsche (re: embodied\nsensibilities) in preparation for a critical reading and assessment of\nthe philosopher Stanley Cavell\u2019s aesthetic reading of how the\ndancer Fred Astaire is rendered in a particular movie in which he\nstars (The Band Wagon) as the focal character who is\nable/enabled to reclaim himself (i.e., make a \u201ccomeback\u201d)\nas a star dancer. What Gooding-Williams lifts up is Cavell\u2019s\nfailure to see that the Astaire-character is enabled by a\nBlack male character who, in shining Astaire\u2019s shoes, transfers\nto Astaire and his feet a restoration of rhythmic capabilities by way\nof the rhythms the Black shoeshine-man articulates while brushing the\nAstaire-character\u2019s shoes and polishing them with his\nshine-rag. All of which presumes something (on the part of the\nfilm-maker; so, too, Cavell, though differently...) about the\nembodiment of enabling aesthetic capabilities of particular kinds in\nthe being of the Black character representative of the\nculturally-inflected raciality of Black people.\n\n\nThere are centuries-long, quite rich traditions of thought\narticulated, and political praxis engaged in, by Black folks for whom\nit is the case that the constitutive racially of Black folks is such\nthat it sets the terms not only of identity, but, as well, of the\nethical imperatives of intra- and interracial mutualities, that is, of\nvarious modes and instances of solidarity. And, as well, for\ncompelling pragmatic reasons: to contend with, ultimately to overcome,\ninvidious racial discrimination and oppression. No small matters for\npersons and peoples suffering racialized dehumanization and\nexploitation thus in need of shared motivating and guiding notions of\nhow to gain and sustain freedom and justice. Many concerned to forge\nfreedom in just conditions have sought morally compelling guiding\nunderstandings in shared raciality, in being, by particular\nunderstandings of raciality, a distinctive people, a\ndistinctive nation of Black people. Hence, traditions of\n\u201cBlack Nationalism,\u201d waxing and waning across the\ncenturies, resurgent more recently in various forms (music and art;\n\u201cAfrocentric\u201d thought) and locales in the United States,\nin particular. Tommie Shelby, who became a certified professional\nphilosopher after the resurgent Black nationalisms of the Black Power\nand Black Arts movements, while deeply committed to philosophical\nengagements with and out of contexts of lived experiences of Black\nfolks in which much of his life has been conditioned, has, in\nhis We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black\nSolidarity, endeavored to work out a philosophically clarified\nand justified account of the terms and agenda of solidarity as a basis\nfor organized and coordinated struggles for justice. The account is\nintended to be both motivating and welcoming of the solidaristic\ncooperation of persons Black and non-Black without needing to resort\nto what he reasons to be the philosophically indefensible racial\nessentialism of various construals of Black nationalism. Yet, the\naccount is intended to be in keeping with important conceptual and\nnormative groundings of Black political cultural life that are, as\nwell, compatible with a notion of political liberalism worked out by\nJohn Rawls. With Shelby\u2019s efforts, too, there is the hard work\nof extending decidedly prominent mainstream philosophical thought\n(that of of Rawls in this particular case) to a creatively critical\nengagement with unjust limiting conditions on the lives of Black folks\nin conjunction with efforts of philosophical reconstruction and\ndefense of principles of Black solidarity that embrace a notion\nof Blackness suitable for emancipatory work.\n",
