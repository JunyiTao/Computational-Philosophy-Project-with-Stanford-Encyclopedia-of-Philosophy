    "main_text": "Ethics\n10. Plato\u2019s Later Epistemology, Metaphysics, and Psychology\n\nWith respect to the specific controversies we have examined, for\nexample, that over the role of the preludes and that concerning the\npowers of the Nocturnal Council, we have found that the issues under\ndispute have important connections to Plato\u2019s epistemology and\npsychology. This should not, however, be surprising. To understand the\nnature of ethical learning and what ethical cognitive states can be\nproduced by different kinds of education, we must ultimately turn to\nPlato\u2019s epistemology, metaphysics, and psychology. Further,\nsince the appropriate political role for citizens depends in large\npart on the kinds of ethical character and knowledge (or true belief)\nthey can acquire, we can only understand Plato\u2019s later political\nphilosophy by understanding its connections with his later\nepistemology, metaphysics, and psychology.\n\nThe idea that Plato\u2019s ethics and politics rest, at least in\nlarge part, on his views in these other areas of philosophy is not\nnovel. Much of the best work on the ethical and political theory of\nthe Republic tries to draw such\n connections.[70]\n But this has not yet happened to anything approaching the same degree\nwith respect to his later ethics and\n politics.[71]\n This is due perhaps primarily to the fact that while the\nRepublic provides within itself an account articulated in\nsome detail not only of Plato\u2019s ethics and politics, but also of\nthe psychology, epistemology and metaphysics on which they rest, the\nLaws is comparatively lacking in extended argumentation on\nthese basic philosophical issues. But Plato is not trying in the Laws\nto provide a comprehensive philosophical statement of the sort found\nin the Republic. Questions of psychology, epistemology,\nethics and metaphysics (including the metaphysics of value) are\nexplored in great detail and with extraordinary sophistication in the\nother later dialogues. Indeed, they are treated in much more detail\nand with greater philosophical power than in the middle period. And it\nis these later dialogues that provide the indispensable background for\nunderstanding the Laws. Thus we should read it together with,\nfor example, the Philebus\u2019 metaphysics of value and\naccount of pleasure and with the epistemology and psychology of the\n Timaeus.[72]\n More cautiously, we should look for connections with the\nepistemology, metaphysics and psychology of other dialogues which are\nplausibly thought to be post-Republic, but do not fall into\nthe final group of six, such as the Phaedrus and the\n Theaetetus.[73]\n By examining Plato\u2019s philosophical positions in these later\ndialogues, we can work out the deeper justification for Plato\u2019s\nvision of political and ethical community in the Laws. And by\narticulating this vision, we gain greater understanding of the other\nlater dialogues on which it rests.\n",
