Although emotions that are\nstrategically rational will also generally be cognitively rational in\nthe fittingness and in the warrant sense, exceptions are possible. For\nexample, some instances of anger which are not produced in the\npresence of either actual slights (fittingness) or evidential cues of\nslights (warrant) end up promoting the agent\u2019s interests. A case\nin point may be the anger of a customer whose interests would be best\nserved by returning used merchandise but who has lost the receipt, and\nangrily dresses down a blameless clerk, which gets him the\nsought-after concession because the clerk gets intimidated.\n\nWe can distinguish two components of strategic rationality: an emotion\nis strategically rational insofar as it leads an agent (i) to select\nmeans conducive to the agent\u2019s ends (instrumental strategic\nrationality) and (ii) to pursue ends that align with the agent\u2019s\ninterests all things considered (substantive strategic irrationality).\nAn example of instrumental irrationality would be that of an agent who\ngets into a panic while trying to exit a house on fire, fails to\nlisten to the fireman\u2019s directions, goes for the closest door\nforgetting that it leads into the only area of the house without an\nexit, and perishes in the process. There is nothing wrong here with\nthe end towards which panic predisposes the agent\u2014seeking\nsafety\u2014but the means chosen are clearly suboptimal.\n\nSubstantive irrationality can be argued for with respect to both\nemotion types and emotion tokens. For instance, some have proposed that\ngrief is a substantively irrational emotion type, because it\nalways involves the belief that a person dear to the grieving agent is\ndead and the desire that such person is not dead, which is an\nunsatisfiable desire given what one believes (Gustafson 1989; see\nCholbi 2017 for a response). \n\nMore commonly, theorists have argued that specific tokens of\ncertain emotion types can be substantively irrational. For example, it\nwould be contrary to an agent\u2019s interests to get angry at a\npotential employer during a job interview, since it will likely result\nin not getting the job offer and thus frustrate self-interest.\n\nBy contrast, anger at someone cutting the line at the airport can be\nsubstantively rational, since the end of stopping the offensive\nbehavior is conducive to one\u2019s interests. Nussbaum (2016) has\nrecently argued that this can only be the case if the angry\nagent\u2019s focus is not at all on payback for the offensive\nbehavior but entirely on preventing the offensive behavior from\nhappening again, because the desire for payback is either\nstraightforwardly irrational or problematic in other ways (Nussbaum refers to the unproblematic forms of anger as transition-anger).\n\nA common reason for doubting the strategic rationality of emotions is\nthat they often appear to lead to impulsive physical and\nmental actions. Impulsivity involves acting quickly prior to having\nconsidered all relevant information (Frijda 2010; Elster 1999, 2010).\nSome have argued that this is precisely what helps emotions provide an\noptimal compromise between speed and flexibility, allowing emotions to\nfunction as \u201cdecoupled reflexes\u201d (Scherer 1984).\n\nOthers have noted that emotions often lead to \u201carational\u201d\nactions, namely emotional actions not performed \u201cfor a\nreason\u201d (Hursthouse 1991). Paradigmatic examples include actions\nlike jumping up and down out of joy or rolling around in one\u2019s\ndead wife\u2019s clothes out of grief. In such cases, Hursthouse\nargued, there is no belief and desire pair that can be posited to\nprovide a Humean reason for such actions, which are to be explained\nsimply by saying that the agent is in the grip of an emotion. The\ndebate on arational actions has taken off in recent philosophy of\nemotions, and a number of proposals, both in favor and against\nHumeanism, are available (see M. Smith 1998; Goldie 2000, D\u00f6ring\n2007; Kovach & De Lancey 2005; Scarantino & Nielsen 2015).\n\n\nEmotions are notoriously apt to make us act in ways we regret.\nNotably, they can be a source of weakness of the will, the failure to\nact on one\u2019s best reasons (Davidson 1970 [1980]). But they just\nas often help agents stick to their long-term goals (Tappolet 2016:\n227). For example, a gut feeling of guilt may help an agent resist a\ncheating temptation and is in this sense a means to the end of\nsuccessfully exercising self-control. On occasion, emotions can even\nground the phenomenon of inverse akrasia (McIntyre 1990; Arpaly &\nSchroder 2000), which consists in failing to do what you judged best\nonly to discover that you in fact did what was best for you, contrary\nto your former judgment. For example, one may judge best to become a\nprofessional musician, but be crippled by stage fright and end up in\nlaw school, only to later realize that this course of action best\nserves one\u2019s long-term interests.\n\nA further threat to the strategic rationality of emotions comes from\ntheir relation to self-deception (Fingarette 1969; Mele 1987; van\nLeeuwen 2007), which is commonly regarded as irrational. Roughly,\nself-deception involves forming beliefs that are contrary to what the\navailable evidence supports but conformant to what the self-deceived\nagent desires. Emotions can cause self-deception because they can lead\nto powerful desires that something be or not be the case, which\ncausally impact the subject\u2019s ability to process evidence.\n\nThis feature is principally related to the fact that emotions\ndetermine salience among potential objects of attention. Poets have\nalways known that the main effect of love is to redirect attention:\nwhen I love, I notice nothing but my beloved, and nothing of his or\nher faults. But this carries a risk, because I may fail to notice that\nthere is massive evidence that I am being deceived in some harmful\nway. My desire that I not be deceived, motivated by my love, is what\ndrives the faulty processing of evidence, resulting in\nself-deception.\n\nThis potential of emotions for \u201cskewing the epistemic\nlandscape\u201d (Goldie 2004: 259) in negative ways is compensated by\nemotion\u2019s important role in promoting rational epistemic\nthinking. Epistemic emotions are those that are particularly\nrelevant to our quest for knowledge and understanding. Curiosity\nmotivates inquiry; interest keeps us at it, and, as both Plato and\nDescartes noted, doubt is crucial to our ability avoid prejudice.\nThese \u201cepistemic\u201d emotions can guide us specifically in\nthe context of our attempts to gain knowledge (Silvia 2006; Brun,\nDo\u011fuo\u011flu, & Kuenzle 2008; Morton 2010).\n\nBut even garden-variety, non-epistemic emotions can promote\nunderstanding of the world and of the self within it (see also the\nfeeling-as-information hypothesis in affective science; Schwarz 2012).\nAccording to Brady (2013), the principal way in which emotions can do\nso is by motivating us to search for information that has a bearing on\nthe fittingness of our emotions, and on the adequacy of their\nunderlying concerns. Once again, the mechanism is that of changing\nsalience among potential objects of attention. Suppose for instance\nyou feel afraid when about to give a toast at a wedding. Your fear\npromotes understanding because it prompts you to determine whether the\nsituation is truly dangerous, and whether you should care that much\nabout giving a brilliant toast.\n\nMore broadly, it has been argued that the ability of emotions to shift\nattention on some features rather than others provides an essential\nsolution to the so-called frame problem, which is the problem\nof sorting relevant from irrelevant information in decision-making. De\nSousa has made the case in philosophy, suggesting that \n\n\nemotions spare us the paralysis potentially induced by [the frame\nproblem] by controlling the salience of features of perception and\nreasoning\u2026[thereby] circumscribing our practical and cognitive\noptions. (de Sousa 1987: 172) \n\n\nFor example, being afraid of a bear focuses attention exclusively on\nthe features of the situation that are relevant to escaping it,\nwithout wasting time on deciding what irrelevant factors to\nignore.\n\nDamasio (1994, 2003) has given neurobiological foundations to this\nproposal, suggesting that emotions simplify the decision process by\nquickly marking deliberative options in the prefrontal cortex as\npositive or negative in light of their expected emotional\nconsequences. Patients with ventromedial prefrontal damage, Damasio\nargued, become irrationally Hamlet-like when faced with trivial\ndecisions such as choosing a date for their next doctor\u2019s\nappointment, irrationally risk-prone when faced with gambling\ndecisions, and irrationally impatient when faced with decisions\ndemanding deferred gratification. The debate on whether the empirical\nevidence supports Damasio\u2019s \u201csomatic marker\nhypothesis\u201d is still ongoing (see, e.g., Dunn, Dalgleish, &\nLawrence, 2006; Reimann & Bechara, 2010; Beer 2017).\n\nAnother influential view on the rationality of emotions is that they\nhelp solve the commitment problem (Schelling 1960;\nHirshleifer 1987; Frank 1988), which is the problem of convincing\npotential cooperative partners that one will fulfill promises and\nthreats even when narrowly self-interested considerations would demand\notherwise. For example, Frank (1988) has described the expression of\nsympathy as a mechanism to convince potential cooperators that one\nwill behave honestly in future interactions even in the presence of\ntemptation, and the expression of anger as a mechanism to convince\npotential cooperators that one will behave aggressively if messed with\neven when aggression is costly. These emotional signals are said to be\ncredible because hard to fake, and they end up benefitting both\npartners, because they help secure the parties\u2019 willingness to\ncooperate honestly in mutually beneficial projects (see also Ross\n& Dumouchel 2004; O\u2019Connor 2016).\n",
