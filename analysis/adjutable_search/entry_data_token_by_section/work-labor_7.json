    "main_text": "Justice and the Politics of Work || Equality and Workplace Governance\n3.3 Equality and Workplace Governance\n\nIn recent years, egalitarian philosophers have begun to critique\ntypical workplace arrangements as antagonistic to requirements of\nequal relations among individuals in society. Particularly influential\nhere is Anderson\u2019s suggestion that many workplaces amount to a\nform of \u201cprivate government,\u201d at least as authoritarian as\nmany forms of state government.\n\nImagine a government that assigns almost everyone a superior whom they\nmust obey. Although superiors give most inferiors a routine to follow,\nthere is no rule of law. Orders may be arbitrary and can change at any\ntime, without prior notice or opportunity to appeal. Superiors are\nunaccountable to those they order around. They are neither elected nor\nremovable by their inferiors. \u2026The government does not\nrecognize a personal or private sphere or autonomy free from sanction.\nIt may prescribe a dress code and forbid certain hairstyles. Everyone\nlives under surveillance, to ensure that they are complying with\norders. \u2026The economic system of the society run by this\ngovernment is communist. The government owns all the nonlabor means of\nproduction in the society it governs. It organizes production by means\nof central planning. The form of the government is a dictatorship\n(Anderson 2017: 37\u201338).\n\n\nThe \u2018society\u2019 Anderson invites us to imagine is of course\nthe contemporary workplace, at least as it stands in the United States\nand many other nations. Anderson and other relational\negalitarians view the relationships defined by the powers that\nemployers usually have over their employees as oppressive and unjust.\nWorkers are subject to employers\u2019 \u2018governance,\u2019 but\nthis governance consists in employees being arbitrarily and\nunaccountably subject to the wills of employers. The relational\negalitarian thus concludes that workplaces, as presently constituted,\ndo not involve employees and employers relating as genuine equals. And\nwhile employees will generally have the right to exit employment\nrelationships, this may be little protection against oppression if\nmost workplaces are organized in the way Anderson illustrates.\n\nTo some degree, the inequalities to which Anderson points are products\nof labor law and policies specific to different nations. There are,\nhowever, ways of altering the relationships between employers and\nworkers so as to potentially prevent or address these (and other)\ninequalities.\n\nPerhaps the most familiar such method is unionization or\ncollective bargaining. Worker unions amplify the power of individual\nworkers in relation to their employers by compelling employers to\nnegotiate contracts with workers as a body. Unions may organize\nworkers within a particular profession, within many professions, or\nwithin a single workplace or firm. Societies vary considerably in the\ndegrees to which their workers are unionized and their labor laws\nfriendly to union formation and power. Unions are presumptively\njustified on the grounds that workers who consensually form or join\nunions are exercising their right to freely associate with others with\nwhom they share interests in order to promote those interests\n(Lindblom 2019), though if union membership is required in order to be\nemployed in a particular workplace or industry, unionization may\nviolate individuals right not to associate with others or to\nassociate with (in this instance, to enter into an employment\nrelationship) any party of their choosing (White 1998).Appealing to\n\u201crepublican liberty,\u201d Mark Reiff (2020) has argued that\nunions should be viewed as a basic institution of society that\nprotects workers\u2019 liberty from exploitation by employers. On\nReiff\u2019s view, unionization should therefore be universal and\ncompulsory.\n\nOther methods for redressing the seemingly unequal and oppressive\nrelations between employers and employees involve breaking the\nmonopoly on decision making that management typically has within a\ngiven firm or employment arrangement. Typical workplaces are\nhierarchical rather than democratic. Many egalitarian critics of work\ncall for the workplace to be more democratized, with workers having a\ngreater say not only concerning their own working conditions but also\nconcerning decisions usually reserved for management. Advocates for\nworkplace democracy often argue that it is likely to be the most\neffective workplace organization in protecting workers\u2019\ninterests. (Gonz\u00e1lez-Ricoy 2014). Others emphasize that the\nworkplace is a microcosm of larger society and hence serves as a\ntraining ground for the development of virtues needed to live in a\nlarger democratic society (Pateman 1970, Estlund 2003). But perhaps\nthe most basic argument for workplace democracy is that firms are\nanalogous to states, and so if the state ought to be governed\ndemocratically, so too should firms and other workplaces (Dahl 1986,\nMayer 2000, Landemore & Ferreras 2016). Workplace democracy would\nseem to render the workplace more just inasmuch as it makes\nworkers\u2019 conditions a partial byproduct of their consent and a\nreflection of their autonomy (Schaff 2012).\n",
