    "main_text": "Biography and Works || Biography (Disputed)\n1.1 Biography (Disputed)\n\nVasubandhu (4th century C.E.) is dated to the height of the\nGupta period by the fact that, according to Param\u0101rtha, he\nprovided instruction for the crown prince, and queen, of King\n\u201cVikram\u0101ditya\u201d\u2014a name for the great\nChandragupta II (r.\n 380\u2013415).[6]\n Vasubandhu lived his life at the center of controversy, and he won\nfame and patronage through his acumen as an author and debater. His\nwritings, packed as they are with criticisms of his\ncontemporaries\u2019 traditions and views, are an unparalleled\nresource for understanding the debates alive among Buddhist and\nOrthodox (Hindu) schools of his time.\n\nAs a young Buddhist scholar monk, Vasubandhu is said to have traveled\nfrom his home in Gandh\u0101ra to Kashmir, then the heartland of the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophical system, to study. There, students\nwere sworn to keep the tradition secret amongst themselves. Vasubandhu\nquestioned Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika orthodoxy and made enemies there, but\nmanaged to return home an expert in the system. Immediately, he\nviolated Kashmiri Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika norms by giving public\nteachings, going so far as to dare all comers to debate him at the end\nof each day. Vasubandhu\u2019s Kashmiri colleagues were livid until\nthey received a copy of the text from which he was teaching, the root\nverses of his Treasury of the Abhidharma. This brilliant\nsummary of their system pleased them immensely. But then, Vasubandhu\npublished his auto-commentary, which criticized the system in various\nways, primarily from a Sautr\u0101ntika perspective. Livid again.\nYears later, Vasubandhu\u2019s Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika contemporary\nSa\u1e45ghabhadra composed two treatises purporting to refute the\nCommentary, and traveled to Ayodhy\u0101, where Vasubandhu\nwas living under royal patronage, to challenge the master to a public\ndebate (Vasubandhu refused). This narrative, reported in Chinese and\nTibetan sources, accounts for the unusual fact that Vasubandhu\u2019s\nCommentary often disagrees with positions affirmed in the\nTreasury\u2019s root verses.\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s elder half-brother was Asa\u1e45ga, the monk who\nmeditated in solitude for twelve years until he was able to meet with\nand receive teachings directly from the future Buddha, Maitreya.\nAsa\u1e45ga thereby became the preeminent expounder of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra synthesis of \u201cGreat Vehicle\u201d\n(Mah\u0101y\u0101na) Buddhism, writing some texts himself, and\ntransmitting the so-called \u201cFive Treatises\u201d revealed by\nMaitreya. When he was advanced in years, Asa\u1e45ga became worried\nabout his younger brother\u2019s karmic outlook (Vasubandhu had\npublicly insulted Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s works). So he sent his students\nto teach Vasubandhu and convince him to adopt the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nsystem. It worked. This narrative provides a reason for\nVasubandhu\u2019s having written many texts from the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra perspective after his prior advocacy of so-called\n\u201c\u015ar\u0101vaka\u201d positions. It explains why the author\nof the Treasury and its Commentary might have gone\non to write several commentaries on Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures, a\ntreatise that defends the legitimacy of Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures,\nand a series of concise Yog\u0101c\u0101ra syntheses.\n\nThe mythologized, hagiographic character of the traditional\nbiographies, together with the (disputed) belief that they contradict\none another, has led a number of modern scholars to doubt their\nveracity. Many have expressed doubts that the mass of extant texts\nattributed to Vasubandhu in the Tibetan and Chinese canons could have\nbeen written by a single individual. In the 1950s Erich Frauwallner\nproposed a thesis that there were two separate Vasubandhus, whom the\ntraditional biographies mistakenly combined into one\n figure.[7]\n Versions of this theory hold sway in some areas of the academy. Some\nscholars have called into question the story of Vasubandhu\u2019s\nconversion from \u015ar\u0101vaka (non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na) to\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra under the influence of his brother Asa\u1e45ga, by\nnoting a more gradual set of transitions and commonalities across\nworks previously thought to sit on opposite sides of this\n \u201cconversion.\u201d[8]\n An extension of this argument, advocated today by Robert Kritzer and\ncolleagues, holds that Vasubandhu was secretly an advocate of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra all\n along.[9]\n",
