    "main_text": "Why-questions || A pragmatic approach: explanatory contrast\n3.2 A pragmatic approach: explanatory contrast\n\nA second major development in the theory of why-questions is the\naccount of van Fraassen (1980, ch. 5). Van Fraassen\u2019s theory is\nmotivated by the idea that explanation is not a special relationship\nbetween theory and reality. Rather, an explanation is just a\ndescription of reality that serves a contextually determined\npurpose, namely that of answering a why-question. Van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory is thus an erotetic (i.e., question-theoretic) theory of\nexplanation, as opposed to an account of why-questions in terms of\nexplanation. He offers this theory in the context of developing his\naccount of Constructive Empiricism. \n\nFor van Fraassen, a why-question \\(Q\\) can be identified with a triple\n\\(\\langle P,X,R\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is a true proposition (the\ntopic of the question); \\(X\\) is a set of propositions to\nwhich \\(P\\) belongs and of which \\(P\\) is the only member that is true\n(the contrast class of \\(Q)\\); and \\(R\\) is a contextually\ndetermined relation of explanatory relevance, which holds between a\nproposition and the topic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\).\nThe standard linguistic expression of \\(Q\\) is:\n\n (26)  Why \\(P\\) in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X\\)?  \n\n\nFor example, consider \u2018Why do birds in the northern hemisphere\ngo south for the winter, whereas mammals and reptiles do not?\u2019\nIn this case, \\(P\\) is the proposition that birds in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter, and \\(X\\) is the set containing\n\\(P\\) along with the proposition that mammals in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter and the proposition that reptiles\nin the northern hemisphere go south for the winter. The contrast class\nparameter allows one to distinguish different why-questions that have\nthe same topic. Thus one can ask why northern hemisphere\nbirds (rather than mammals or reptiles) go south for the\nwinter, and this is different from asking why northern hemisphere\nbirds go south (rather than north or west) for the winter.\nUntil one specifies a contrast class, van Fraassen argues, a\nparticular why-question has not been identified or posed. Like van\nFraassen, Garfinkel (1981) advances a view on which explanatory\ncontrast takes center stage, but we will focus here on the details of\nvan Fraassen\u2019s account. See Temple 1988 for a comparison of van\nFraassen\u2019s and Garfinkel\u2019s respective treatments of\nexplanatory contrast.\n\nSuppose that \\(X=\\{P,P_1 ,\\ldots ,P_k,(\\ldots)\\}\\), and that \\(P\\) is\nnot one of the \\(P_k\\)s. (Note that \\(X\\) may be finite or infinite.)\nThen, where \\(A\\) is any proposition, van Fraassen (1980, 144) defines\na direct answer to \\(Q\\) to be any proposition having the following\ntruth conditions:\n\n(27)\\(P\\) and, for all\n\\(k\\ge 1\\), \\(\\neg P_k\\), and \\(A\\).\n\n\nThe standard wording of a direct answer (28) to \\(Q\\) uses the word\n\u2018because\u2019 in place of the second \u2018and\u2019 in\n(27):\n\n(28)\\(P\\), in contrast\nto the rest of \\(X\\), because \\(A\\).\n\n\nOn van Fraassen\u2019s view, the contribution of\n\u2018because\u2019 to the truth conditions of (28) is simply\nboolean conjunction, as reflected in (27). The role of\n\u2018because\u2019 in (28) is to perform the pragmatic function of\nindicating that (27) is being used for an explanatory purpose, not to\ngive a non-truth-functional dimension to the truth conditions of (28).\nProposition \\(A\\) (the core of answer (27)/(28)) is said to be\nrelevant to \\(Q\\) iff \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation \\(R\\) to\n\\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). In general, to ask why is to ask for a reason,\nand \\(R\\) varies according to the kind of reason that is being\nrequested in a given context. One can ask why in order to request\ncausal factors, to request a justification, to request a purpose, to\nrequest a motive, to request a function, and so on.\n\nA why-question, according to van Fraassen (1980, 144\u2013145)\npresupposes (i) that its topic is true, (ii) that, in its contrast\nclass, only its topic is true, and (iii) that at least one proposition\nbearing the explanatory relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class\npair is true. When the first or second presupposition fails (because\nthe contextually determined body of background knowledge in play does\nnot entail both (i) and (ii)), the why-question does not\narise. When the third presupposition fails, the why-question has\nno answer even if it arises. For example, suppose that paresis\nindeterministically strikes some people who have untreated syphilis.\nThen, if ten people have untreated syphilis, and exactly one of them,\nJohn, goes on to contract paresis, there may be no answer to the\nquestion \u2018Why did John, in contrast to the other nine, contract\nparesis?\u2019 Since paresis develops indeterministically from\nsyphilis, nothing favors John (in contrast to the other nine syphilis\npatients) as being likely to develop paresis. On the other hand, if\nBill and Sarah never had syphilis, the question \u2018Why did John,\nin contrast to Bill and Sarah, develop paresis?\u2019 does have an\nanswer: \u2018John developed paresis, in contrast to Bill and Sarah,\nbecause John had syphilis but Bill and Sarah did not.\u2019 In this\ncase, as in the first, the why-question requests causal factors that\nled to John\u2019s getting paresis while the others mentioned in the\ncontrast class did not. In both cases, then, the same relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is in play because the same kind of information is\nrequested, namely causal factors leading to the truth of the topic in\ncontrast to the other members of the contrast class. If there are no\nsuch causal factors, as in the first version of the paresis case, the\nquestion is to be rejected. If, as in the second version of the\nparesis case, there are such factors, so that at least one proposition\nbears the relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class pair, then a\ncandidate answer \\(A\\) is evaluated according to three criteria: how\nacceptable or likely \\(A\\) is, the degree to which \\(A\\) favors \\(P\\)\nover other members of \\(X\\), and whether \\(A\\) is made irrelevant by\nother answers.\n3.2.1 How-questions and explanatory contrast\n\nVan Fraassen\u2019s theory of why-questions is intended as a theory\nof explanation, but why-explanation seems not to be the only kind of\nexplanation there is. Cross (1991) argues that answers to\nhow-questions are explanations, too, and, building on van\nFraassen\u2019s theory of why-questions, Cross offers a theory of\nhow-questions that ultimately unifies why- and how-explanation in a\nsingle theory of explanatory questions.\n\nFirstly, it must be noted that not every how-question requests an\nexplanation. For example, \u2018How far is it to Cleveland?\u2019\nasks for a distance, not an explanation. In general, according to\nCross (1991, 248), a how-question is explanation-seeking whenever\n\u2018how\u2019 can be paraphrased as \u2018in what way\u2019.\n\nSecondly, ways, like reasons, come in a variety of kinds (Cross 1991,\n248\u20139):\n\n(29)a.By\nwhat road (How did you\nget here?)\nb.In\nwhat manner (How did\nyou behave at the party?)\nc.By\nwhat argument (How\nwill you justify this?)\nd.By\nwhat method (How do\nyou perform an appendectomy?)\ne.By\nwhat means (How did\nyou get that money?)\nf.In\nwhat respect (How do\nthese differ?)\ng.By\nwhat process (How do\nDNA molecules replicate?)\n\n\nThirdly, Cross argues that one can see phenomena of explanatory\ncontrast in how-questions in such examples as the following: \n\n(30)a.How\ndo DNA molecules (in\ncontrast to molecules of benzene and hexane)\nreplicate?\nb.How\ndo reptiles (in\ncontrast to mammals and birds) reproduce?\n\n\nThe linguistic form (31) of a how-question and its answer (32),\naccording to Cross, are as follows, where, as in van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory, the contrast class \\(X\\) is a set of propositions containing\n\\(P\\): \n\n (31) How is \\(P\\) (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) the case? \n (32) \\(P\\) (as\ncontrasted with the rest of \\(X)\\) in this way: \\(A\\). \n\n\nNotice, however, that whereas in (30a) the propositions in \\(X\\) other\nthan \\(P\\) are false, in (30b) all three members of \\(X\\) are true:\nbirds, mammals, and reptiles reproduce. This, Cross argues, reflects\nthe fact that how-questions can exhibit two different kinds of\nexplanatory contrast. By asking (30a) one requests an answer that\nhighlights those special qualities of DNA that enable it to replicate\nand that benzene and hexane do not possess. By asking (30b), on the\nother hand, one requests an answer that highlights the differences\nbetween the way in which reptiles reproduce and the ways in which\nmammals and birds reproduce. The latter kind of explanatory contrast\nalso appears to be at play when (30b) is re-worded this way:\n\n (33) I know how\nmammals and birds reproduce, but how do reptiles\nreproduce? \n\n\nIn view of this, Cross introduces a contextual parameter in his\naccount of how-questions to indicate whether a given how-question\npresupposes that all members of the contrast class are true or whether\nit presupposes that all members of the contrast class other than \\(P\\)\nare false. In the resulting account, a how-question is an ordered\nquadruple \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is the topic of the\nquestion; \\(X\\) is the contrast class, which is a set of propositions\nto which \\(P\\) belongs; \\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of\nexplanatory relevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\), and \\(n\\) is the\ncontrast value 0 or 1. If \\(n = 0\\), the question presupposes that in\n\\(X\\) only \\(P\\) is true; if \\(n = 1\\), the question presupposes that\nall of the members of \\(X\\) are true. The explanatory relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is to be understood as varying from context to context\ndepending on what kind of way is being requested in that context.\nFinally, Cross (1991, 252) defines a direct answer to a how-question\nas follows:\n\n (34) A proposition\n\\(B\\) is a direct answer to \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\) iff there is\nsome proposition \\(A\\) such that \\(A\\) is relevant to \\(\\langle\nP,X,n\\rangle\\) and if \\(n = 0\\), then \\(B\\) is the proposition which\nis true iff \\(A\\) and \\(P\\) are true and every \\(C\\) such that \\(C\\in\nX\\)\\\\(\\{P\\}\\) is false, and if \\(n= 1\\), then \\(B\\) is the proposition\nwhich is true iff \\(A\\) and all members of \\(X\\) are true.\n\n\n\nHaving found examples in which how-questions have contrast value 1,\nCross argues that why-questions, too, can presuppose that the other\nmembers of their contrast classes are true. Consider a therapy meeting\nfor alcoholics in which each member of the group is asked the\nfollowing question:\n\n (35) Why did\nyou (in contrast to the other members of the group) start\ndrinking too much? \n\n\nIn this case it appears that the asker is requesting an answer that\nhighlights factors that distinguish the alcoholism of the person to\nwhom the question is addressed from that of the others in the group.\nThis and other evidence leads Cross to conclude that how- and\nwhy-questions are the same kind of question\u2014both are\nexplanatory questions\u2014and both can be represented as\nhaving the structure \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\). If a proposition\n\\(A\\) must be a reason for \\(P\\) (in contrast to the rest of\n\\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\),\nthen the question is worded with \u2018why\u2019 and the answer with\n\u2018because\u2019; if \\(A\\) must be a way for \\(P\\) to be\nthe case (in contrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation\n\\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded with\n\u2018how\u2019 and the answer with \u2018by\u2019, \u2018in this\nway\u2019, or similar wording. \n\nIt is possible to accept Cross\u2019s theory as a theory of\nhow-questions only and to resist the final move of unifying how- and\nwhy-questions into a single species of question. The unification that\nCross proposes assumes that why-questions can have contrast value 1,\nbut Risjord (2000, 73\u20134) argues that instead of accepting that\n(35) is a why-question with contrast value 1, one can instead analyze\nit as a why-question with contrast value 0 that makes reference to the\ntopics of other why-questions (also having contrast value 0) that have\nbeen or could be raised in the given context.\n3.2.2 Criticisms of the pragmatic/contrastivist approach\n\nKitcher and Salmon (1987) were early critics of van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory of why-questions as a theory of explanation. They object (1987,\n319) that the lack of constraints on the relevance relation \\(R\\)\n\u201callows just about anything to count as the answer to just about\nany [why-]question.\u201d Other critics of van Fraassen\u2019s\ntheory include Ruben (1987) and Temple (1988), who argue that\nexplanatory contrast is an unnecessary complication because any\ncontrastive why-question \u2018why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?\u2019 is equivalent to the non-contrastive why-question\n\u2018why P&\\(\\neg\\)Q?\u2019. Risjord (2000, 70) rebuts this\nreduction of the contrastive to the non-contrastive by arguing that it\nleads to the untenable result that whenever \\(P\\) entails both\n\\(\\neg\\)Q and \\(\\neg\\)R, \u2018why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?\u2019 must then be logically equivalent to \u2018why \\(P\\)\n(in contrast to \\(R)\\)?\u2019, since \\(P \\amp \\neg Q\\) is logically\nequivalent to \\(P \\amp \\neg R\\) if \\(P\\) entails \\(\\neg Q\\) and \\(\\neg\nR\\). But questions of these forms need not be equivalent, since they\nmay call for different answers. For example, if Art is a vegan and is\nallergic to chocolate, a correct answer to \u2018Why did Art eat\nfruit for dessert (rather than eating ice cream and skipping the\nfruit)?\u2019 will cite his being a vegan and not his chocolate\nallergy, whereas a correct answer to \u2018Why did Art eat fruit for\ndessert (rather than eating chocolate and skipping the fruit)?\u2019\nwill cite his chocolate allergy but not his being a vegan.\n3.2.3 Other versions of the contrastivist approach\n\nWhere van Fraassen\u2019s theory places few restrictions on the\ncontrast class or foils of a why-question, some authors have\nargued that the set of possible foils is constrained in various ways.\nOne example is Sober (1986), who contends that the presuppositions of\n\u2018Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?\u2019 include a two-part common\ncause presupposition, namely that (1) the truth of \\(P\\) and the\nfalsity of \\(Q\\) trace back to a common cause, and (2) the common\ncause discriminates \\(P\\) from \\(Q\\) in the sense that it makes \\(P\\)\nmore likely than \\(Q\\). Both presuppositions fail for Sober\u2019s\n(1986, 145) example of the unanswerable question, \u2018Why is Kodaly\na Hungarian rather than a vegetarian?\u2019 Another author who argues\nfor additional constraints on foils is Lipton (1990), who aims in part\nto improve on Lewis\u2019s (1986) account of causal explanation.\nLipton contends that a causal answer to \u2018Why \\(P\\) rather than\n\\(Q\\)?\u2019 must cite a cause of \\(P\\) and the absence of a\ncorresponding event in the history of \\(\\neg Q\\), i.e., a causal\ndifference between \\(P\\) and \\(\\neg Q\\). Lipton (1990, 256) calls this\nThe Difference Condition. The central requirement for a sensible\ncontrastive question is that fact and (negated) foil have a similar\ncausal history against which the differences stand out (Lipton 1990,\n258). According to Barnes (1994), Lipton is correct that fact and\n(negated) foil must have a similar causal history, but Barnes goes\nfurther and claims that a why-question presupposes that the fact and\nfoil can be viewed as culminating outcomes of some single type of\nnatural causal process (Barnes 1994, 50).\n",
