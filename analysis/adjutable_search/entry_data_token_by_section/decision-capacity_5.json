    "main_text": "Elements of Capacity || Choice\n4.1 Choice\n\nChoice is short for \u201cthe ability to express or communicate\none\u2019s choice\u201d, and it is the simplest and least mental\nelement of capacity. Indeed, its simplicity and obviousness may\nexplain why some authors do not include it. To see that such an\nability is necessary one needs only to imagine a case where\nunderstanding, appreciation and reasoning are all intact, but where\nthe subject has no way to express or communicate her intended\ndecision. Unless a subject\u2019s preferred choice can be expressed\nto others in some outward way, it is impossible to know their intended\ndecision. This is not trivial, since some patients\u2014for example\nstroke victims or some patients with Locked-In Syndrome\u2014can have\nan active mental life and satisfy the first three conditions but are\nunable to express anything verbally or through gestures (e.g.,\nblinking the eyes, lifting a finger, etc.). This is why Grisso &\nAppelbaum (1998: 34\u201337) include it as one of the elements lack\nof which compromises capacity.\n",
