    "main_text": "The Unity of a State of Affairs || The Unity-Problem\n6.1 The Unity-Problem\n\nIf one conceives of a state of affairs as complexes that\n\u201ccontain\u201d particulars and properties, one needs to answer\nthe unity-question \u201cWhat unifies some particulars and properties\ninto one state of affairs?\u201d An answer to this question should\ndistinguish states of affairs from other complexes. Frege pressed this\npoint in his letters to Wittgenstein:\n\n\nIs every connection of objects a state of affairs? Does it not also\ndepend on how the connection is produced? What is the tie? Can this\nperhaps be gravitation, as with the system of planets? Is it [the\nsystem of planets] a state of affairs? (Frege 1919: 20, my\ntranslation)\n\n\nThe solar system consists of the sun and the planets pulled into orbit\naround it by gravity. If this does not qualify as a state of affairs\nthen there must be some relation independent of gravitation that\nunites the things involved in a state of affairs. What distinguishes\nthis complex physical object from the state of affairs the\nsun\u2019s pulling the planets into orbit by gravity? If the\nlatter contains the sun and the planets and the pulling-by gravity\nrelation, the distinction between the states of affairs and solar\nsystem must lie in what unites their elements.\n\nRussell argued that there is no plausible answer to the unity-question\nfor states of affairs (he called them \u201cpropositions\u201d). He\nexplains his main worry about states of affairs as follows:\n\n\nOur disbelief in their [propositions\u2019] reality may be reinforced\nby asking ourselves what kind of entity a false proposition could be.\nLet us take some very simple false proposition, say \u201cA\nprecedes B\u201d, when in fact A comes after B.\nIt seems as though nothing were involved here beyond A and\nB and \u201cpreceding\u201d and the general form of dual\ncomplexes. But since A does not precede B, these objects\nare not put together in the way indicated in the proposition. It\nseems, therefore, that nothing which is actually composed of these\nobjects is the proposition; and it is not credible that anything\nfurther enters the proposition. (Russell 1913: 109\u201310; for a\ndetailed discussion of this argument see Wetzel 1998)\n\n\nWhat unifies A, B and the relation of Preceding\nto the fact that A precedes B? A\u2019s actually\npreceding B. What unifies A, B and the relation\nof Preceding to the state of affairs A\u2019s\npreceding B? If A does not precede B, the\nunity of the state of affairs cannot consist in A being\nactually related by the preceding relation to B.\n\nSo far Russell has only shown that the unity of a state of affairs\nA\u2019s standing in R to B does not\nconsist in A\u2019s standing in R to B.\nIn addition, he has imposed a constraint on answers to the\nunity-question. He says that it is not credible that there is a\nunifying element that is not a constituent of the state of affairs.\nRussell himself couldn\u2019t find an answer to the unity-question\nthat met his constraint. Hence, he tried to eliminate states of\naffairs.\n",
