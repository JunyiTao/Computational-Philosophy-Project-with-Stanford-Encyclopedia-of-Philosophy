    "main_text": "Revising the Foundations of Deontic Logic || Deontic Logic and Actions\n6.2 Deontic Logic and Actions\n\nWe often apply terms such as \u201cmust\u201d, \u201cought\u201d,\nand \u201ccan\u201d to actions rather than to states of affairs. For\ninstance, we would say that \u201cJimmy must tie his\nshoelaces\u201d, rather than \u201cit is obligatory (for Jimmy) that\nJimmy\u2019s shoelaces are tied\u201d. Likewise, we make claims such\nas \u201cJack must get the groceries\u201d and \u201cyou can turn\nleft here\u201d. In each of these three examples, it seems we signal\nthe deontic status of a certain action\u2014 an agent-initiated\nway of changing the current world, or bringing it into a\ndifferent state. However, the by now common reading of\nSDL\u2014deviating from von Wright\u2019s original interpretation\n(recall\n supplement B, von Wright\u2019s 1951a System and SDL),\n has it that we can always apply the deontic modals to propositions\ninstead.\n\nVarious semantics have been developed in which deontic terms are\napplied directly to actions, conceived as transitions between states\nin a Kripke-model. For instance, following the reduction of SDL to\nalethic modal logic (cf.\n Section 3),\n Meyer 1988 adds an Andersonian \u201cviolation\u201d constant V to\n propositional dynamic logic\n (PDL). In this framework, [\\(\\alpha\\)]V expresses that executing the\naction \\(\\alpha\\) necessarily leads to a violation, hence,\n\u201c\\(\\alpha\\) is forbidden\u201d. Where \\(-\\alpha\\) denotes the\nnegation of action \\(\\alpha\\), [\\(-\\alpha\\)]V then represents that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is\n obligatory.[82]\n Note that intuitively, this formula can be read as: \u201cwhenever\n\\(\\alpha\\) is not carried out, a violation occurs\u201d.\nAlternatively, one may define a notion of strong\npermissibility of an action \\(\\alpha\\), by introducing a Kangerian\nconstant \u201cOK\u201d and expressing that \\(\\alpha\\) is strongly\npermissible by [\\(\\alpha\\)]OK. This means, intuitively, that whenever\none executes the action \\(\\alpha\\), then one is guaranteed to end up\nin a world that is deontically acceptable (no violation\n occurs).[83]\n\nMeyer\u2019s analysis reduces the deontic status of a given action\n(at a given state w) to the occurrence of violations in its terminal\nstates (reachable from w through that action), giving rise to\nso-called \u201cgoal norms\u201d. In contrast, one may also consider\n\u201cprocess norms\u201d that concern all the intermediate states\nthat are \u201cpassed by\u201d when carrying out a given action at a\nstate. Deontic logics of the latter type have been proposed in van der\nMeyden 1996; see Broersen 2004, Kulicki and Trypuz 2017, Canavotto and\nGiordani 2019 for discussions of this distinction.\n\nA different approach to actions in deontic logic originates in\nSegerberg 1982, and further developed inter alia in Kulicki\nand Trypuz 2017. Here, a Boolean algebra of actions is\nproposed\u2014analogous to the Boolean algebra of PC\u2014and one\ndefines functions that specify which (basic and complex) actions are\npermissible, forbidden, or required. An expression like \u201c\\(P\n\\alpha\\)\u201d then just means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a member of the set\nof permitted actions, and such expressions are used to build more\ncomplex ones using classical propositional connectives. Whereas in\ndynamic deontic logic, the deontic behavior of complex actions is\ngoverned by the underlying logic of actions (i.e., PDL), in deontic\nlogics over Boolean action algebras, specific frame conditions are\nimposed to ensure that, e.g., \u201caction \\(\\alpha\\) is\nforbidden\u201d entails that \u201cdoing \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n(say, simultaneously) is\n forbidden\u201d.[84]\n",
