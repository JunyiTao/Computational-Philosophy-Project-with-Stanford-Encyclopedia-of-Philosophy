    "main_text": "Rational Versus Empirical Utilitarianism\n4. Rational Versus Empirical Utilitarianism\n\nSpencer referred to his own brand of utilitarianism as\n\u201crational\u201d utilitarianism, which he claimed improved upon\nBentham\u2019s inferior \u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism. And\nthough he never labeled Mill a \u201crational\u201d utilitarian,\npresumably he regarded him as one.\n\nOne should not underestimate what \u201crational\u201d\nutilitarianism implied for Spencer metaethically. In identifying\nhimself as a \u201crational\u201d utilitarian, Spencer distanced\nhimself decidedly from social Darwinism, showing why Moore\u2019s\ninfamous judgment was misplaced. Responding to T. H. Huxley\u2019s\naccusation that he conflated good with \u201csurvival of the\nfittest,\u201d Spencer insisted that \u201cfittest\u201d and\n\u201cbest\u201d were not equivalent. He agreed with Huxley that\nthough ethics can be evolutionarily explained, ethics nevertheless\npreempts normal struggle for existence with the arrival of humans.\nHumans invest evolution with an \u201cethical check,\u201d making\nhuman evolution qualitatively different from non-human evolution.\n\u201cRational\u201d utilitarianism constitutes the most advanced\nform of \u201cethical check[ing]\u201d insofar as it specifies the\n\u201cequitable limits to his [the individual\u2019s] activities,\nand of the restraints which must be imposed upon him\u201d in his\ninteractions with others (Spencer, vol. I, 1901:\n 125\u201328).[15]\n In short, once we begin systematizing our inchoate utilitarian\nintuitions with the principle of equal freedom and its derivative\nmoral rights, we begin \u201ccheck[ing]\u201d evolutionary struggle\nfor survival with unprecedented skill and subtlety. We\nself-consciously invest our utilitarianism with stringent liberal\nprinciples in order to advance our well-being as never before.\n\nNow Henry Sidgwick seems to have understood what Spencer meant by\n\u201crational\u201d utilitarianism better than most, although\nSidgwick didn\u2019t get Spencer entirely right either. Sidgwick\nengaged Spencer critically on numerous occasions. The concluding of\nBook II of The Methods of Ethics (1907), entitled\n\u201cDeductive Hedonism,\u201d is a sustained though veiled\ncriticism of\n Spencer.[16]\n\nFor Sidgwick, Spencer\u2019s utilitarianism was merely seemingly\ndeductive even though it purported to be more scientific and\nrigorously rational than \u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism.\nHowever, deductive hedonism fails because, contrary to what deductive\nhedonists like Spencer think, no general science of the causes of\npleasure and pain exists, insuring that we will never succeed in\nformulating universal, indefeasible moral rules for promoting\nhappiness. Moreover, Spencer only makes matters worse for himself in\nclaiming that we can nevertheless formulate indefeasible moral rules\nfor hypothetically perfectly moral human beings. First of all, in\nSidgwick\u2019s view, since we can\u2019t possibly imagine what\nperfectly moral humans would look like, we could never possibly deduce\nan ideal moral code of \u201cabsolute\u201d ethics for them.\nSecondly, even if we could somehow conceptualize such a code, it would\nnevertheless provide inadequate normative guidance to humans as we\nfind them with all their actual desires, emotions and irrational\n proclivities.[17]\n For Sidgwick, all we have is utilitarian common-sense, which we can,\nand should, try to refine and systematize according the demands of our\nchanging\n circumstances.[18]\n\nSidgwick, then, faulted Spencer for deceiving himself in thinking that\nhe had successfully made \u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism more\nrigorous by making it deductive and therefore \u201crational.\u201d\nRather, Spencer was simply offering just another variety of\n\u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism instead. Nevertheless,\nSpencer\u2019s version of \u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism was\nmuch closer to Sidgwick\u2019s than Sidgwick recognized. Spencer not\nonly shadowed Mill substantively but Sidgwick methodologically.\n\nIn the preface to the sixth edition of The Methods of Ethics\n(1901), Sidgwick writes that as he became increasingly aware of the\nshortcomings of utilitarian calculation, he became ever more sensitive\nto the utilitarian efficacy of common sense \u201con the ground of\nthe general presumption which evolution afforded that moral sentiments\nand opinions would point to conduct conducive to general\nhappiness\u2026\u201d (Sidgwick, 1907: xxiii). In other words,\ncommon sense morality is a generally reliable, right-making decision\nprocedure because social evolution has privileged the emergence of\ngeneral happiness-generating moral sentiments. And whenever common\nsense fails us with conflicting or foggy guidance, we have little\nchoice but to engage in order-restoring, utilitarian calculation. The\nlatter works hand-in-glove with the former, forever refining and\nsystematizing it.\n\nNow Spencer\u2019s \u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism works much\nthe same way even though Spencer obfuscated these similarities by\nspuriously distinguishing between \u201cempirical\u201d and\nsupposedly superior, \u201crational\u201d utilitarianism. Much like\nSidgwick, Spencer holds that our common sense moral judgments derive\ntheir intuitive force from their proven utility-promoting power\ninherited from one generation to the next. Contrary to what\n\u201cempirical\u201d utilitarians like Bentham have mistakenly\nmaintained, we never make utilitarian calculations in an\nintuition-free vacuum. Promoting utility is never simply a matter of\nchoosing options, especially when much is at stake, by calculating and\ncritically comparing utilities. Rather, the emergence of utilitarian\npractical reasoning begins wherever our moral intuitions breakdown.\nMoral science tests and refines our moral intuitions, which often\nprove \u201cnecessarily vague\u201d and contradictory. In order to\n\u201cmake guidance by them adequate to all requirements, their\ndictates have to be interpreted and made definite by science; to which\nend there must be analysis of those conditions to complete living\nwhich they respond to, and from converse with which they have\narisen.\u201d Such analysis invariably entails recognizing the\nhappiness of \u201ceach and all, as the end to be achieved by\nfulfillment of these conditions\u201d (Spencer, vol. I, 1978:\n204).\n\n\u201cEmpirical\u201d utilitarianism is \u201cunconsciously\nmade\u201d out of the \u201caccumulated results of past human\nexperience,\u201d eventually giving way to \u201crational\u201d\nutilitarianism which is \u201cdetermined by the intellect\u201d\n(Spencer, 1969: 279 ff.). The latter, moreover, \u201cimplies\nguidance by the general conclusions which analysis of experience\nyields,\u201d calculating the \u201cdistant effects\u201d on lives\n\u201cat large\u201d (Spencer, 1981: 162\u20135).\n\nIn sum, \u201crational\u201d utilitarianism is critical and\nempirical rather than deductive. It resolutely though judiciously\nembraces indefeasible moral rights as necessary conditions of general\nhappiness, making utilitarianism rigorously and uncompromisingly\nliberal. And it was also evolutionary, much like Sidgwick\u2019s. For\nboth Spencer and Sidgwick, utilitarian practical reasoning exposes,\nrefines and systematizes our underlying moral intuitions, which have\nthus far evolved in spite of their under-appreciated utility. Whereas\nSpencer labeled this progress towards \u201crational\u201d\nutilitarianism, Sidgwick more appropriately called this\n\u201cprogress in the direction of a closer approximation to a\nperfectly enlightened [empirical] Utilitarianism\u201d (Sidgwick,\n1907: 455).\n\nNotwithstanding the undervalued similarities between their respective\nversions of evolutionary utilitarianism, Spencer and Sidgwick\nnevertheless parted company in two fundamental respects. First,\nwhereas for Spencer, \u201crational\u201d utilitarianism refines\n\u201cempirical\u201d utilitarianism by converging on indefeasible\nmoral rights, for Sidgwick, systematization never ceases. Rather,\nsystematizing common sense continues indefinitely in order to keep\npace with the vicissitudes of our social circumstances. The best\nutilitarian strategy requires flexibility and not the cramping\nrigidity of unyielding rights. In effect, Spencer\u2019s\nutilitarianism was too dogmatically liberal for Sidgwick\u2019s more\ntempered political tastes.\n\nSecond, Spencer was a Lamarckian while Sidgwick was not. For Spencer,\nmoral faculty exercise hones each individual\u2019s moral intuitions.\nBeing biologically (and not just culturally) inheritable, these\nintuitions become increasingly authoritative in succeeding\ngenerations, favoring those cultures wherever moral common sense\nbecomes more uncompromising all things being equal. Eventually,\nmembers of favored societies begin consciously recognizing, and\nfurther deliberately refining, the utility-generating potency of their\ninherited moral intuitions. \u201cRational,\u201d scientific\nutilitarianism slowly replaces common sense, \u201cempirical\u201d\nutilitarianism as we learn the incomparable value of equal freedom and\nits derivative moral rights as everyday utilitarian decision\n procedures.[19]\n\nTheir differences aside, Spencer was nonetheless as much a utilitarian\nas Sidgwick, which the latter fully recognized though we should\nhesitate labeling Spencer a classical utilitarian as we now label\nSidgwick. Moreover, Sidgwick was hardly alone at the turn of the\ntwentieth-century in depicting Spencer as fundamentally utilitarian.\nJ. H. Muirhead viewed him as a utilitarian as did W. D. Ross as late\nas 1939. (Muirhead, 1897: 136; Ross, 1939: 59). Even scholars in\nGermany at that time read Spencer as a utilitarian. For instance, A.\nG. Sinclair viewed him as a utilitarian worth comparing with Sidgwick.\nIn his 1907 Der Utilitarismus bei Sidgwick und Spencer,\nSinclair concludes \u201cDaher ist er [Spencer], wie wir schon gesagt\nhaben, ein evolutionistischer Hedonist und nicht ein ethischer\nEvolutionist,\u201d which we can translate as \u201cTherefore he\n(Spencer) is, as we have already seen, an evolutionary hedonist and\nnot an ethical evolutionist\u201d (Sinclair, 1907: 49). So however\nmuch we have fallen into the erroneous habit of regarding Spencer as\nlittle invested with 19th-century utilitarianism, he was not received\nthat way at all by his immediate contemporaries both in England and in\ncontinental Europe.\n",
