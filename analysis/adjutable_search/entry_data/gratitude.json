    "main_text": "\n1. Conceptual Matters\n\nIn analyzing gratitude and the conditions under which it is called\nfor, philosophers have generally tried to account for all the cases in\nwhich we find it natural to use gratitude terms\n(\u201cgrateful\u201d, \u201cthankful\u201d, etc.). We use such\nterms in a broad range of circumstances: it sounds natural to say, for\ninstance, \u201cI am grateful that it did not rain on my wedding\nday;\u201d \u201cgrateful someone happened to walk by as I was being\nmugged;\u201d \u201cgrateful to someone for trying unsuccessfully to\nhelp me;\u201d \u201cgrateful for someone\u2019s\nwell-wishes.\u201d The breadth of circumstances in which we invoke\ngratitude terms would suggest that gratitude, generally, is the\nresponse a person should have to something good\u2014that is, to\nbenefit or \u201cfavour\u201d (Walker 1980\u20131981).\n\nIn the last 40 years, philosophers have begun paying attention to a\nfundamental distinction in how we use gratitude terms (Walker\n1980\u20131981; Card 1988; McAleer 2012; Manela 2016a). On one hand,\nsuch terms can be used just before the preposition \u201cto\u201d,\nas in\n\nY is grateful to R for\n\u03c6-ing,\n\nwhere Y is some beneficiary, R is some benefactor,\nand \u03c6 is (at least paradigmatically) something R has done\nthat was beneficial for Y. Tony Manela (2016a) calls the\nattitude expressed by this type of locution prepositional\ngratitude. On the other hand, gratitude terms are sometimes followed\nby the word \u201cthat\u201d and a proposition, as in\n\nY is grateful that p, \n\nwhere p represents some state of affairs Y finds\nbeneficial. Sean McAleer (2012) calls the attitude expressed by this\ntype of locution propositional gratitude. Prepositional\ngratitude is essentially a \u201ctriadic\u201d or three-place\nrelation between Y, R, and \u03c6. Propositional\ngratitude, by contrast, is a \u201cdyadic\u201d or two-place\nrelation between Y and some good state of affairs p.\nPropositional gratitude is best understood as the proper response to a\ngood state of affairs. Prepositional gratitude, on the other hand, is\nthe proper response to something more specific: a benefactor\u2019s\ndoing or having done something beneficial for the beneficiary. Unlike\npropositional gratitude, prepositional gratitude is an essentially\ninterpersonal phenomenon.\n\nA consensus is emerging that analyses of the concept of gratitude\nshould be concerned only with the phenomenon expressed by the\nprepositional sense of the term (Carr 2013; Gulliford, Morgan et al.\n2013; Manela 2016a; Roberts and Telech 2019). The consensus is based\non the observation that the propositional sense of\n\u201cgratitude\u201d is more or less identical to another concept:\nthe concept called appreciation or gladness. To say\nthat I am grateful that it did not rain on my wedding day,\nfor instance, is just to say that I am glad it did not. To\nsay that I am grateful that my cancer went into remission is\njust to say I am glad that it did and that I\nappreciate the extra life and health that state of affairs\nentails. By contrast, to say I am grateful to a good\nSamaritan for saving my life implies more than that I am glad, or\nappreciate the fact, that I was saved by her. To be grateful\nto such a person seems to imply, for instance, a desire to\nsee her fare well, or a commitment to helping her out in the future,\nshould she ever find herself in dire circumstances. (Other ways in\nwhich appreciation and gratitude are different can be found in\n section 3.)\n As the good Samaritan case suggests, prepositional gratitude and\nappreciation are called for in many of the same situations. Indeed,\nappreciation may be called for in every situation in which\nprepositional gratitude is called for. But as the earlier examples\nsuggested, there are times when appreciation is called for but\ngratitude is not. Insofar as philosophers are interested in analyzing\ngratitude proper, without having their analyses contaminated by such\ncases of mere or bare appreciation, they should\nfocus their attention on all and only instances of the essentially\ninterpersonal kind of gratitude\u2014instances where a beneficiary is\ngrateful to a benefactor for something she did. In\nkeeping with this emerging consensus, the remaining sections of this\nentry will be concerned only with the concept of prepositional\ngratitude: the response called for in a beneficiary to a\nbenefactor\u2019s having done something beneficent for him.\n2. When Gratitude is Owed\n\nPhilosophers debate the specific conditions under which gratitude is\ncalled for in a beneficiary\u2014that is, the conditions under which\nbeneficiary Y owes gratitude to benefactor R, and\nR deserves gratitude from Y, as a result of\nR\u2019s \u03c6-ing. This debate focuses on several features\nof Y, R, and R\u2019s \u03c6-ing.\n\nWhether R must be an agent. Most philosophers agree that at\nthe very least, benefactor R must be an agent in\norder for Y to owe gratitude to R for \u03c6-ing.\nIndeed, this is suggested by the fact that \u03c6 in the formulation of\nprepositional gratitude (Y is grateful to R for\n\u03c6-ing) paradigmatically represents an intentional verb. Two\nnotable skeptics of the \u201cagency requirement\u201d on gratitude\nare Sean McAleer (2012) and Karen Bardsley (2013). McAleer points out\nthat people sometimes purport to be grateful to inanimate objects. He\ngives the example of a prospector who finds gold on a mountain and\nthen claims to be grateful to that mountain for yielding its bounty to\nhim. The plausibility of the prospector\u2019s claim in that case need not\nimply that gratitude to inanimate objects is appropriate, however. The\nplausibility of his claim could be chalked up to his implicitly\nanthropomorphizing the \u201cbenefactor\u201d, attributing to it the\nability to give a benefit when it, strictly speaking, lacks\nthe agency to do so. Manela (2016a) argues that the prospector in\nMcAleer\u2019s example might, on reflection, be just as accurately\ndescribed as glad or appreciative that he found gold on the\nmountain. A more recent critique of the \u201cagency\nrequirement\u201d comes from Karen Bardsley (2013), who argues that\nY\u2019s gratitude can be appropriate toward something,\nR, when two conditions are met: 1) R has benefited\nY in a way Y did not deserve, and 2) that benefit\nwas not the result of an accidental or regrettable feature of\nR. Insofar as conditions 1) and 2) are sufficient for\ngratitude to be warranted, and R\u2019s being an agent is\nnot necessary for 1) and 2), R\u2019s being an agent is\nnot necessary for gratitude to be warranted. This argument, if\nsuccessful, has important implications for environmental ethics,\nbecause it implies the possibility of appropriate gratitude to\nbeneficial natural non-agents like non-sentient organisms, ecosystems,\nor the whole of nature. Manela (2018) has objected to Bardsley\u2019s\nargument by putting forward counterexamples to the claim that her\nconditions 1) and 2) are sufficient for the appropriateness of\ngratitude. If Manela is right, then 1) and 2) entail the\nappropriateness of appreciation and praise but not gratitude; and we\ncan only be appropriately grateful to natural objects that exhibit\nsome kind of agency, like dolphins.\n\nWhether \u03c6 must be an action. Among philosophers, there is\ngeneral agreement that benefactor R must act in some\nway that concerns beneficiary Y in order to deserve\nY\u2019s gratitude. Two exceptions in the literature are\nworth noting. In the first place, Saul Smilansky (1997) argues that\nY sometimes should be grateful to R for\nabstaining from harming Y, at least when certain\nconditions are met\u2014e.g., in cases when abstaining from harming\nsomeone goes beyond the call of duty, or requires effort and sacrifice\n(see the remainder of this section for a more detailed analysis of\nthose conditions). In these cases, R\u2019s \u03c6-ing, for\nwhich Y would be grateful, would be an omission or a\nrefraining rather than an act. A second exception is Kant\n(1775\u20131780 [1981]), who writes that something like gratitude is\nowed or called for in response to mere \u201cheartfelt\nbenevolence\u201d, even in the absence of any acts or attempts on the\npart of the benefactor. Kant refers to this response as\n\u201cgratefulness\u201d rather than gratitude.\n\nWhether R must have \u03c6-ed intentionally. Most philosophers\nhold that Y owes R gratitude only if R\n\u03c6-ed intentionally. Some philosophers have argued that gratitude\nis not warranted in response to all intentional acts, but only those\nthat are voluntary (Simmons 1979). On this view, if\nR benefits Y only because R has a gun to\nher head, she does not deserve Y\u2019s gratitude, even if\nshe benefited Y intentionally. Other philosophers specify\nthat in order for gratitude to be warranted, R\u2019s\n\u03c6-ing must have been intentional under the description\n\u201cbenefiting Y\u201d (Manela 2016a). On this view, if\nR \u03c6s unintentionally, or intentionally under the\ndescription \u201charming X\u201d, and thereby incidentally\nhappens to benefit Y, Y would not owe R\ngratitude for \u03c6-ing (though Y\u2019s\nappreciation for R\u2019s \u03c6-ing may be\nwarranted). This view, if correct, might have an intriguing\nimplication for children\u2019s gratitude to their parents. Some\nphilosophers have argued that to intentionally create a child does not\namount to benefiting that child, since to benefit someone is to make\nhim better off than he was before, and when one chooses to bring a\nchild into existence, there was no child there before that choice who\ncould be made better off by it. If this is true, then parents who\nintentionally bring children into existence cannot do so under the\ndescription \u201cbenefiting those children\u201d, insofar as we\ncannot intend the impossible; and if intention to benefit is necessary\nfor gratitude to be warranted, children\u2019s gratitude to their\nparents for bringing them into existence is never warranted.\nPhilosophers who hold this view (e.g., McConnell 1993) can of course\nstill hold that children owe their parents gratitude for benefits\ntheir parents conferred on their children after bringing them into\nexistence.\n\nNot all philosophers accept the \u201cintentionality\nrequirement\u201d on gratitude. Those who do not endorse it include\nBardsley (2013), for reasons mentioned earlier in this section, and\nPatrick Fitzgerald (1998), who denies that R must have\n\u03c6-ed intentionally under the description \u201cbenefiting\nY\u201d in order for gratitude to be warranted. According to\nFitzgerald, Y\u2019s gratitude to R for harming him\nmight be called for if there was some benefit that came about for\nY because of that harm. Thus it might be the case that the\nDalai Lama, Fitzgerald argues, should be grateful to the Chinese\ngovernment for persecuting him, insofar as that persecution gave him\nthe opportunity to become more virtuous. Manela (2016a) disputes this,\narguing that it is more accurate to say that the Dalai Lama should\nappreciate the opportunity the Chinese gave him by trying to\nharm him but should not be grateful to them for\n\u201cproviding\u201d it.\n\nThere is some disagreement among philosophers about whether\nR\u2019s intention to benefit Y must be\nR\u2019s only motive in \u03c6-ing. Most\nphilosophers allow that R may have other motives for\n\u03c6-ing, noting that our motives are almost always mixed (see, e.g.,\nMcConnell 1993). Some philosophers argue, however, that the presence\nof certain intentions might render a particular act of beneficence\nless than gratitude-worthy. Weiss (1985) argues that whatever her\nother motives, R must not benefit Y with the\nintention of gaining standing to demand a return in the future, as\nthis would render R\u2019s \u03c6-ing a sort of lending,\nrather than a gratitude-worthy act of beneficence. Berger (1975),\nMcConnell (1993) and Manela (2015) also argue that such an intention\nmight reduce or eliminate the amount of gratitude owed to\nR.\n\nWhether R\u2019s \u03c6-ing must be supererogatory. There is\nalso debate over whether Y can owe R gratitude for\n\u03c6-ing if R was obligated to \u03c6, or if\nY had a right to R\u2019s \u03c6-ing. Heyd\n(1982), Weiss (1985), Walker (1980\u20131981), Card (1988), and\nMacnamara (2019) all argue that Y does not owe gratitude to\nR for doing something R was already obligated to do\nanyway or that Y had a right to, and that gratitude is owed\nonly in response to supererogatory acts. Other philosophers\ndisagree, citing various counterexamples. Simmons (1979), for\ninstance, claims that I owe gratitude to a good Samaritan who stops to\noffer me assistance, even though such acts are obligatory. Lyons\n(1969) argues that while I may not owe gratitude to a lifeguard for\nsaving my life, I may owe him gratitude for having freely taken up the\nobligation to do so. Seneca (On Benefits) claims that\ngratitude may be owed for an obligatory act if the benefactor had\ngratitude-worthy motives beyond the motive to fulfill her obligation,\nand these gratitude-worthy motives were decisive in motivating her.\nBennett Helm (2019) argues that I can owe gratitude to someone who\ndutifully upholds (but does not necessarily exceed) an obligatory\nsocial norm, when his upholding that norm is \u201cnotable\u201d and\ndemonstrates recognition respect for me. Finally, it might be argued\nthat a benefactor who benefits me in fulfilling her duty deserves\ngratitude insofar as living up to her duty required extraordinary\nsacrifice on her part (McConnell 1993: 16; Seneca On\nBenefits: III.19.12\u201313), or insofar as her living up to her\nduty makes her a \u201cmoral standout\u201d among so many other\nsimilarly situated people who fail to fulfill such duties (McConnell\n2017). The captured soldier who resists torture long enough for her\ncompanions to reach safety seems to deserve gratitude, despite doing\nno more than her duty (refraining from giving the enemy valuable\ninformation). These examples suggest that perhaps \u03c6\u2019s\npraiseworthiness, rather than \u03c6\u2019s\nsupererogatoriness, is a necessary condition for Y\u2019s\nowing gratitude to R. This possibility is challenged by the\nfact that sometimes, it seems a beneficiary Y may owe\ngratitude to a benefactor who was obligated to give away some\nparticular benefit to someone, and happened to choose Y as\nthe recipient. McConnell (1993) gives the example of a student who is\nrequired by her instructor to volunteer at a charitable organization\nof her choice. When she chooses Y\u2019s organization, her\naction is neither supererogatory nor praiseworthy; but it seems she\nstill deserves gratitude from Y.\n\nWhether R must incur some liability in \u03c6-ing. Several of\nthe examples in the last paragraph suggest that gratitude is owed to\nR only if R incurred some liability in\n\u03c6-ing. On this view, gratitude is due only when the benefactor\nincurs some cost, sacrifice or risk in \u03c6-ing (Simmons 1979: 178;\nWeiss 1985: 495). Upon reflection, this condition may be too\nstringent. It would seem to rule out, for instance, the possibility of\ngratitude to an omnipotent god, who, in virtue of his omnipotence,\nwould sacrifice little or nothing in acting beneficently. It also\nseems to rule out the possibility of gratitude in McConnell\u2019s\nexample at the end of the last paragraph. In response to these\nworries, it might be pointed out that agents (perhaps even an\nomnipotent god) always incur opportunity costs in deciding to bestow\nbenefits on one beneficiary and not another.\n\nWhether R\u2019s \u03c6-ing must actually benefit R. Most\nphilosophers agree that R\u2019s \u03c6-ing need not result\nin Y\u2019s actually being benefited in order for\nR to deserve Y\u2019s gratitude. Some philosophers\nsuggest that the mere offer of a benefit, even if it is not accepted,\ncalls for gratitude in the offeree (Camenisch 1981). Others argue that\ngratitude may be called for in response to R\u2019s\nattempt at benefiting Y, even if the attempt does\nnot succeed. There is a parallel here with the conditions under which\nresentment or blame are deserved. If one agent intends, plans and\nattempts to harm another, then it seems he deserves resentment and\nblame, even if his attempts were thwarted at the last minute by\nchance. By the same token, if R intends, plans and sacrifices\nin an attempt to benefit Y, but finds her attempts thwarted\nat the last minute by chance, it seems she still deserves gratitude.\nThis claim may not be absolute. Dowling (1995), for instance, argues\nthat if R inadvertently harms Y in attempting to\nbenefit him, gratitude may not be owed. This may be true especially in\ncases where R knew, or should have known, that \u03c6-ing\nwould expose Y to non-negligible risk of harm.\n\nWhether Y wants or accepts R\u2019s \u03c6-ing. Philosophers\nalso debate whether certain features of the beneficiary are necessary\nfor gratitude to be owed. Simmons (1979), for instance, claims that\nY owes R no gratitude for benefits R forced\non Y against Y\u2019s will. Furthermore, it seems,\nY must want R\u2019s benefit in order for\ngratitude to be called for. If R delivers a benefit without\nY\u2019s desire or consent to receive it, this may betray a\ndisregard for Y\u2019s autonomy that would ultimately\nundermine R\u2019s desert of gratitude (Berger 1975;\nCamenisch 1981; Meilaender 1984: 168). This condition seems too\nstringent in cases where a beneficiary desperately needs a benefit but\nis not able to accept it, say, because of incapacitation. In response\nto such worries, Simmons adds the proviso that if Y does not\nactually want the benefit, it may suffice for gratitude to be\nowed that Y would want the benefit if certain\n\u201cimpairing conditions\u201d (such as drunkenness, mental\ndisorder or ignorance) were removed. Still, some philosophers think\ngratitude may be called for in the absence of both Y\u2019s\ndesire and such impairing conditions. McConnell (1993), for instance,\nargues that a child who accepts an offer of college tuition from a\nbenefactor owes that benefactor gratitude, even if she does not want\nto go to college.\n\nSimmons (1979) argues for a further necessary condition for\nY\u2019s owing gratitude to R: that Y must\nnot want the benefit in question not to come from R.\nY may not want his once-abusive father to pay for his college\neducation, for example, in which case Y would not owe his\nfather gratitude for doing so, even if Y might have been\nhappy to accept the same benefit from anyone else. McConnell (1993)\nand Weiss (1985) disagree, arguing that while it may sometimes be\nemotionally difficult for a beneficiary to be grateful to a particular\nbenefactor for \u03c6-ing, beneficiaries might still owe their\nbenefactors gratitude under such circumstances (especially if the\nbeneficiary accepts the benefit).\n\nTwo remarks about the role of these conditions. In\nconsidering the conditions under which beneficiary Y owes\ngratitude to benefactor R for \u03c6-ing, two points should be\nnoted. The first is that the question of whether gratitude is owed is\nnot necessarily settled once and for all in the moment that R\n\u03c6\u2019s. Even if R\u2019s \u03c6-ing makes it the case\nthat Y owes R gratitude, some future harm or wrong\non R\u2019s part might render Y\u2019s gratitude\nfor R\u2019s \u03c6-ing no longer called for (McConnell 1993:\n29\u201330). This might happen if, for example, R recklessly\nor malevolently destroys a gift she gave Y. Gratitude may\nalso cease to be called for if R, subsequent to\ngratitude-worthily \u03c6-ing, demands a return or compensation for\nhaving \u03c6-ed (insofar as such a demand would seem to render\nR\u2019s \u03c6-ing more of a loan than a gratitude-worthy\nact of benevolence or beneficence) (Weiss 1985), or tries to use the\nfact of his having \u03c6-ed to manipulate Y by guilting him\ninto doing something (Berger 1975). \n\nA second point worth noting is that while these conditions are often\ndiscussed as necessary (and perhaps jointly sufficient) conditions for\ngratitude\u2019s being called for, they can also be seen as factors\nthat modulate how much and what sort of gratitude is owed.\nThe proper response to mere \u201cheartfelt benevolence\u201d on\nR\u2019s part might be no more than a similar feeling of\ngoodwill from Y to R. On the other hand, if\nR sacrifices greatly in voluntarily and successfully\nconveying substantial and much-needed benefit on Y, the\ngratitude Y owes R may take the form of a strong\nintention or willingness to sacrifice to a similar degree if\nR ever finds herself in need.\n3. The Elements of the Grateful Response\n\nGratitude, understood as the response called for in Y to\nR\u2019s \u03c6-ing when certain conditions (discussed in\n section 2)\n are met, is a complex phenomenon. It consists of certain beliefs,\nfeelings and behavioral tendencies, without each of which a\nbeneficiary fails to count as fully grateful. The elements of the\ngrateful response can be broken down into four categories: cognitive,\naffective, communicative, and conative.\n3.1 Cognitive Elements\n\nAs a response to beneficence, gratitude seems to include certain\njudgments or beliefs\u2014at the very least, the\nbelief that an act of beneficence has occurred (Berger 1975: 302;\nWalker 1980\u20131981: 51; Manela 2019). In the absence of such\njudgments, we would be hard pressed to call a beneficiary grateful. A\nbeneficiary who failed to judge that an act of beneficence had been\nperformed would be unlikely to have the feelings or exhibit the\nbehaviors a grateful person ought to have and do (see sections\n 3.2,\n 3.3, and\n 3.4\n below). Such feelings and behaviors, after all, do not arise ex\nnihilo in normal people, so without a sufficient reason, we would\nexpect them not to arise.\n\nThe precise content of grateful beliefs may vary, depending on the\nnature of the act of beneficence in response to which they are called\nfor. They may, for instance, include the belief, on Y\u2019s\npart, that benefactor R is especially brave, or especially\nthoughtful, or especially self-sacrificing. They may include the\nbelief, on Y\u2019s part, that R cares a great deal\nabout Y (Berger 1975), and perhaps, relatedly, that\nY is worthy of being cared about to such an extent\n(Shaw 2013, Manela 2019). Some have argued that all instances of\ngratitude have a certain cognitive element in common: a belief in or\nan awareness of one\u2019s dependence on others\u2014the sort of\nawareness typically associated with humility (McAleer 2012; Roberts\n2014). These philosophers argue that humility is an essential part of\ngratitude, and that being humble is always part of being grateful.\nManela (2016a) argues that this generalization may be overstated.\nHumility-related beliefs may be a part of a grateful\nbeneficiary\u2019s response to a benefit that he desperately needed\nand could not provide for himself. But if R benefits\nY by doing something that Y was perfectly capable of\ndoing for himself (and something Y himself has done for\nothers in the past), then Y could be grateful to R\nwithout, in that instance, being aware of any dependence he might have\non others.\n\nThough the content of grateful beliefs may vary, a beneficiary must\nform more than just the belief that something good has happened to\nhim, if he is to qualify as grateful to R. If a\nbenevolent stranger saves my life at great risk to herself, and I\nconsequently form no beliefs about her as an agent (e.g., that she is\na benevolent or brave person, or that she cares about me), then I fail\nto be grateful to her\u2014though I may be grateful\nthat she saved me if I form the belief that something good\nhas happened to me. The difference in the content of the beliefs\ncalled for in response to benefit from an agent, on the one hand, and\nbenefit more generally, on the other, is yet another way in which\nprepositional gratitude is distinguished from propositional\n\u201cgratitude\u201d, or appreciation (see\n section 1).\n\nGratitude calls not only for the formation of certain beliefs, but for\ntheir persistence as well. A beneficiary who forgets an act\nof beneficence (or, at least, forgets too quickly) seems to fall short\nof what gratitude calls for (Aquinas II\u2013II, q. 104, art. 1;\nSeneca On Benefits: II.10.4; III.5.2). In fact, according to\nSeneca, a beneficiary who forgets a benefit is \u201cthe worst and\nmost ungrateful\u201d of beneficiaries\u2014perhaps because merely\nremembering a benefit is the easiest part of being grateful (Seneca\nOn Benefits: III.5.2).\n3.2 Affective Elements\n\nMost philosophers agree that in addition to certain beliefs, gratitude\ncalls for certain feelings or affects in a\nbeneficiary, without which he fails to count as grateful. One notable\nexception is Hichem Naar (2019), who argues that mere grateful\nbeliefs, unaccompanied by feelings, can constitute a shallow kind of\ngratitude he calls \u201cgeneric gratitude\u201d, typically\nappropriate in response to trivial favors. Even Naar, however,\nacknowledges that \u201cdeep gratitude\u201d includes certain\nfeelings.\n\nPhilosophers largely agree that feelings of gratitude\u2014the\nfeelings that partly constitute a beneficiary\u2019s being\ngrateful\u2014are positive and agreeable feelings (Fitzgerald 1998;\nBruton 2003). Some philosophers claim that an act of beneficence\nshould incite feelings of joy and pleasure in the\ngrateful beneficiary\u2014and not just because of the benefit, but\nbecause he has benefited as a result of someone\u2019s benevolence\ntoward him (Camenisch 1981; Card 1988; McConnell 1993; Seneca On\nBenefits). Still others claim that gratitude entails a certain\naffection for the benefactor (Bruton 2003). These\ngeneralizations may not apply to gratitude in all cases, however. As\nManela (2016b) notes, feelings of gratitude can sometimes be quite\nnegative (i.e., painful or disagreeable): a beneficiary whose\nbenefactor sacrifices terribly in conferring her benefit on him should\nprobably feel grief or sadness, rather than joy or pleasure, insofar\nas he is grateful to her. And the proper response to a benefit from a\nbenefactor one finds loathsome need not amount to affection.\n\nSeveral philosophers suggest that as far as feelings go, gratitude\nrequires some degree of goodwill toward a benefactor,\nunderstood as wishing a benefactor well (Walker 1980\u20131981;\nHerman 2012). Goodwill in this sense should be understood not strictly\nspeaking as an affect, but as a disposition to have certain\naffects in certain situations\u2014what we might call an\naffective disposition (Manela 2016b). For a beneficiary to\nhave goodwill toward his benefactor is for the beneficiary to have\ndispositions to be pleased if things go well for her and a disposition\nto be sad or upset when things go poorly for her (Manela 2016b).\nInsofar as goodwill is necessary for gratitude, it may mark another\ndistinction between prepositional gratitude and propositional\n\u201cgratitude\u201d (Manela 2016a). I can be perfectly grateful\nthat it did not rain on my wedding day without wishing anyone\nwell. By contrast, it seems that I fail to be grateful to a\nbenefactor if I fail to wish her well after she does me a good\nturn.\n\nGratitude seems to call not only for the presence of certain affective\nelements, but the diminution or absence of certain\naffective elements as well. In particular, one affective disposition\nthought to be inconsistent or incompatible with gratitude is\nresentment: an affective disposition to feel pleasure when a\nbenefactor suffers, and displeasure when she fares well (Camenisch\n1981: 24; McConnell 1993: 83; Fitzgerald 1998: 131, fn 143; Bruton\n2003: 3; Roberts 2004: 69; Costello 2006: 270). Insofar as there was\nresentment between a benefactor and beneficiary before an act of\nbenevolence, a grateful beneficiary will be inclined to experience\nless resentment after the fact. A beneficiary who, in response to an\nact of benevolence, forms proper grateful beliefs but experiences\nincreased resentment toward his benefactor (perhaps out of\nenvy for her virtuously benevolent disposition) is guilty of an\nespecially vicious kind of ingratitude (see\n section 3.5).\n The fact that a beneficiary could form appropriate grateful beliefs\nbut still instantiate ingratitude (by consequently resenting his\nbenefactor) undermines the claim that grateful beliefs are sufficient\nfor a beneficiary to count as grateful in any meaningful sense\u2014a\nclaim Naar (2019) has tried to argue regarding what he calls\n\u201cgeneric gratitude\u201d.\n3.3 Communicative Elements\n\nIn addition to feelings and beliefs, gratitude also seems to require\nan act of or tendency to acknowledge a benefactor\u2019s act\nof benevolence, and/or to communicate, demonstrate\nor express grateful beliefs and feelings to the benefactor. A\nbeneficiary who lacks any motivation to show or inform his benefactor\nof his grateful attitudes (perhaps, say, because he is overly\nprideful) seems to fall short of what gratitude requires, even if he\nhas the appropriate feelings and beliefs regarding her.\n\nGratitude is generally communicated verbally, by thanking; but the\ndemonstration, expression or communication of gratitude can occur\nthrough certain behaviors as well\u2014such as presenting a\nbenefactor with a thank-you gift, or doing her a return-favor. Some\nphilosophers argue that expression or demonstration of grateful\nattitudes may in fact require certain such nonverbal\nbehaviors. Berger (1975) and Swinburne (1989), for instance, argue\nthat if a benefactor\u2019s act of benevolence was especially great,\nonly a return-favor or thank-you gift that is obviously costly to the\nbeneficiary will suffice as an adequate demonstration of especially\nintense feelings and beliefs of gratitude. Whether the acts of\npresenting a benefactor with a thank-you gift or doing her a favor in\nthe future serve only this demonstrative or expressive\nfunction is disputed (see\n section 3.4.2).\n\nAs far as verbal expressions of thanks go, philosophers agree that the\ngrateful beneficiary\u2019s thanks should be sincere; but what\nexactly sincerity consists in will depend on what sort of speech-act\nthanking turns out to be. For philosophers who consider thanking an\nexpressive, thanks will be sincere insofar as they accurately\nreflect grateful beliefs and feelings that are actually present in a\nbeneficiary. Other philosophers suggest that thanks might be sincere\neven if a beneficiary lacks the requisite grateful feelings and\nattitudes at the time of thanking. Camenisch (1981), for instance,\nsuggests that thanking might sometimes be a\ncommissive\u2014a speech-act through which a beneficiary\ncommits himself to developing grateful beliefs, feelings and other\ndispositions that he may not have at the time of thanking. There is a\nparallel here with forgiveness, which may sometimes be granted even\nwhen the forgiver has not yet rid himself of resentful feelings toward\nhis malefactor. In such cases, it might still be fair to say the\nforgiver was sincere in his utterance, if we understand \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d to imply the forgiver\u2019s commitment to ridding\nhimself of such feelings (Griswold 2007).\n3.4 Conative Elements\n\nIn addition to certain beliefs, certain feelings, and thanking,\ngratitude seems to require certain behaviors (or\ntendencies) on the part of the beneficiary, such as the\ngiving of thank-you gifts or the doing of return-favors. There is\ndebate among philosophers about exactly what behaviors are required\nfor a beneficiary to count as grateful and about how such behaviors\nshould be motivated in a conscientious beneficiary.\n3.4.1 Grateful Behavior\n\nSeveral philosophers argue that a beneficiary must treat a\nbenefactor\u2019s benefit in certain ways in order to count as\ngrateful. Seneca (On Benefits), for instance, claims that\naccepting the benefactor\u2019s gift in the first place is\nnecessary for gratitude, since turning down a gift is likely to\nfrustrate or disappoint a benefactor, or signal an unwillingness to\nadvance a friendship. (Whether turning down a gift actually\nconstitutes ingratitude is discussed in\n section 4.3,\n below.) Once beneficiaries accept or receive gifts or favors,\nCamenisch (1981) argues that beneficiaries must respect certain\n\u201cuse conditions\u201d on the benefits they receive\u2014i.e.,\nnot treat such benefits in a way obviously repugnant to the\nbenefactor, or antithetical to her reasonable hopes for how the gift\nwould be enjoyed. If I accept a rare edition of Kant\u2019s works,\nand then summarily toss it in the trash, this may instantiate a sort\nof ingratitude. In certain cases, gratitude might also require that a\nbeneficiary compensate his benefactor for certain costs she\nincurred in providing the benefit. If a good Samaritan damages her car\nin rushing me to the hospital, offering to pay for the damage might be\ncalled for (Simmons 1979).\n\nGratitude also seems to require a desire, tendency or willingness to\nbenefit the benefactor in the future\u2014say, by returning a favor,\nor buying a thank-you gift. Some philosophers argue that such a\ntendency of reciprocity is ultimately fundamentally different\nfrom gratitude (Feinberg 1966). It might be fairer to say, however,\nthat while reciprocity can be conceptualized apart from gratitude\n(e.g., as a component of justice), gratitude entails\nreciprocity. After all, a beneficiary who is devoid of any inclination\nto reciprocate a favor seems to fall short of gratitude\u2014even if\nhe has the appropriate beliefs and feelings toward his benefactor, and\nhas expressed thanks (Manela 2016a). This seems especially clear in\ncases where a benefactor requests a reasonable favor from a\nbeneficiary, and the beneficiary refuses to accede to it (Bruton\n2003). Outside the case of requests, though, benefactors seem to have\na great deal of latitude in when and how they return a favor or\npresent a thank-you gift to a benefactor (Simmons 1979). If R\ngives Y an unexpected gift, Y should be inclined to\ndo something nice, of roughly equal magnitude, for R in the\nfuture; but he seems to have a great deal of discretion in what he\ndoes and when. Within this latitude, however, it has been argued that\na truly grateful beneficiary would not return a benefit too soon, or\ntoo similar in kind, or too close in value (Camenisch 1981; Meilaender\n1984). Such responses might be interpreted by the benefactor as\n\u201cpayment\u201d for the \u201cgift\u201d, and might be taken\nas an attempt to reject the benefit qua benevolent gift or\nfavor.\n\nAside from an inclination to reciprocate a benefit, grateful\nbeneficiaries should also be especially inclined to refrain from\nharming their benefactors (Walker 1980\u20131981). We can call this\ntendency grateful nonmaleficence (Manela 2015). Beneficiaries\nshould be disinclined to harm anyone, of course, insofar as harming\nothers is generally morally wrong. But there are circumstances in\nwhich harming others is not necessarily wrong; and in these\ncircumstances, we might expect a grateful beneficiary\u2019s special\ndisinclination to harm a benefactor to make a difference in his\nbehavior. Imagine that Y is a morally upstanding and\nsuccessful businessman in a fair market, whose legitimate business\nactivities have begun driving his nearby competitors out of business.\nDriving competitors out of business under such conditions certainly\namounts to harming them, though this sort of harm is not necessarily\nwrong. Imagine, however, that Y discovers one of his\nvulnerable competitors to be R, a former benefactor who\nsacrificed greatly in performing an act of benevolence for him years\nearlier. It seems plausible that Y, insofar as he is\ngrateful, should go out of his way to spare her from financial harm\n(perhaps, say, by refraining from marketing his products in her\nregion). At the very least, if Y had no special compunction\nabout driving R out of business, we would be hard-pressed to\nsay he was fully grateful to her. A beneficiary, then, should be\nespecially disinclined to harm a benefactor, and should perhaps\nrefrain from harming her in certain situations where he might\nreasonably be willing to harm a stranger. \n3.4.2 Grateful Reasons and Motivation\n\nIn order to instantiate gratitude, each of these behaviors must be\ndone for certain reasons and must be motivated in a certain way.\nConsider first the sorts of reasons a grateful beneficiary should have\nfor behaving gratefully\u2014the sorts of considerations he should\ntake as counting in favor of returning a favor, say, or buying a\nthank-you gift. Virtually all philosophers agree that a beneficiary\nwho benefits a benefactor merely for prudential reasons falls\nshort of gratitude. For example, a beneficiary who returns a favor\nbecause he is afraid of being labeled an ingrate, or because he wants\nto keep a benefactor\u2019s benevolence flowing, seems to fall short\nof gratitude (McConnell 1993). Beyond this, however, there is some\ndisagreement among philosophers about what reasons count as legitimate\nones for performing grateful behavior.\n\nAccording to some philosophers, the fact that grateful behavior, like\nreturning a favor, can demonstrate or express grateful beliefs and\nfeelings should count in favor of doing them (see\n section 3.3).\n But such demonstrativeness reasons cannot be the only\nlegitimate reasons that count in favor of grateful behavior. As Walker\n(1980\u20131981) notes, if the only legitimate reason a beneficiary\nmight have to perform grateful behavior was to express or communicate\ngratitude, then a beneficiary should take himself to have no special\nreason to do a favor for a benefactor secretly or anonymously. And\nyet, intuitively, a beneficiary who takes himself to have no reason to\ndo a good turn for a benefactor upon realizing he won\u2019t get\ncredit for it seems to fall short of gratitude. This suggests that a\nbeneficiary should be motivated to do certain things for a benefactor\nfor reasons other than demonstrating or communicating gratitude.\n\nWalker (1980\u20131981) suggests that the main reason a grateful\nbeneficiary should take to count in favor of performing some grateful\nbehavior, \u03c8, is that \u03c8-ing will advance the interests of the\nbenefactor in some way. We might think of these as reasons of\ngrateful beneficence (Fitzgerald 1998). Walker\u2019s suggestion\nis supported by the fact that all the grateful behaviors in the\nprevious subsection have in common the fact that each tends to advance\nor protect the interests of the benefactor. Grateful reciprocity and\nnonmaleficence advance or protect a benefactor\u2019s\nwelfare interests, while respecting use conditions and\naccepting benefits advance a benefactor\u2019s ulterior\ninterests. Even certain paradigmatically expressive\n\u201cbehaviors\u201d, like verbally thanking, mentioned in\n section 3.3,\n can be construed as advancing the interests of a benefactor, insofar\nas benefactors have interests in being recognized for their\nbenevolence, or knowing that their benevolence accomplished its\ngoal.\n\nAside from reasons of demonstrativeness and grateful beneficence,\nphilosophers have proposed several other types of reasons a grateful\nbeneficiary might take to count in favor of grateful behaviors.\nFitzgerald (1998), for instance, claims that there are six types of\npotentially legitimate reasons for performing grateful actions.\nJuridical reasons are cited when a benefactor deserves or\nmerits gratitude. Beneficent or nonmaleficent\nreasons are cited when showing gratitude will help someone, or spare\nher from harm. Caring reasons are cited when the\njustification for grateful action is primarily to enhance or preserve\na special relationship. Civic reasons are cited when\ngratitude is shown to enhance communal relationships.\nPerfectionist justifications are cited when a beneficiary\nacts gratefully in order to develop certain other virtues within\nhimself. Ultimately, Fitzgerald may be guilty of conflating moral\nreasons a beneficiary might legitimately take into account in\ndeliberation about grateful behavior, on one hand, with reasons why it\nwould be good if a beneficiary were to act gratefully, on the other.\nIn general, just because my having some attitude or intention will\nhave morally good consequences does not necessarily constitute the\nright kind of reason for me to have that attitude. An analogy with\nbeliefs is helpful here. There might be all sorts of reasons why it\nwould be good for me to believe that p; but the only reasons\nthat will count as the right sorts of reasons for me to believe that\np are reasons that speak in favor of p\u2019s\ntruth. By the same token, while many good effects may follow from a\nbeneficiary\u2019s performing acts of gratitude, not all of those\nfacts will count as the right sorts of reason for a deliberating\nbeneficiary to take into account. Caring reasons, civic reasons, and\nperfectionist reasons may ultimately fail to count as the right sort\nof reasons to be grateful. A beneficiary who returns a favor to a\nbenefactor for civic reasons, for instance, may be a good citizen; but\nif he does not believe his benefactor deserves a return-favor, or does\nnot think the return-favor will actually benefit his benefactor, it is\nhard to see how he counts as grateful.\n\nReasons aside, philosophers are also concerned with the way in which\ngrateful behavior is actuated. Several philosophers argue that a\ngrateful beneficiary must be \u201cnaturally inclined\u201d to\nbenefit his benefactor (Wellman 1999b) and will do so spontaneously\n(Camenisch 1981). On this view, a beneficiary who has to deliberate\nabout whether to act gratefully, and then exert an effort of will to\nact on the outcome of his deliberation, falls short of gratitude.\nThere may be room to question whether grateful behavior must always\nflow from natural inclination, however. Consider an analogy with\nfriendship. We expect a good friend to be naturally inclined to help a\nfriend in need; but sometimes, a person may need to muster an effort\nof will to come to his friend\u2019s aid\u2014specifically, when and\nif his first-order natural inclinations to help his friend are\noverwhelmed. This will happens inevitably even to the best of friends\nat times, since even the best of friends will have other legitimate\ncommitments, interests and desires that might sometimes outweigh their\nnatural inclination to come to the aide of a friend (Telfer\n1970\u20131971; Owens 2012). By the same token, it can be argued that\neven the most grateful of beneficiaries will sometimes find their\ninclinations to benefit a benefactor overwhelmed by competing\nlegitimate inclinations (Manela 2015). A beneficiary might have to\nmuster an effort of will, for instance, to pull himself away from his\ndaughter\u2019s birthday party in order to help a benefactor in need.\nBut exerting an effort of will in such cases need not be inconsistent\nwith being grateful, just as exerting an effort of will to help a\nfriend under similar circumstances would not make one a bad friend.\nThe friendship analogy suggests, then, that acting spontaneously on\nfirst-order natural inclinations is not always necessary for an act to\ncount as an act of gratitude.\n\nThe friendship analogy suggests, further, that the presence of\nfirst-order natural inclinations is not sufficient for gratitude. We\nexpect a good friend to be naturally inclined to help a friend in\nneed; but we also expect him to recognize that his natural\ninclinations might sometimes be overwhelmed. A true friend, then,\nshould be prepared to muster an effort of will to come to his\nfriend\u2019s aid in circumstances when his natural inclinations\nfail. A friend who is not so prepared is one type of fair-weather\nfriend. By the same token, some (e.g., Manela 2019) have argued that a\nbeneficiary who merely has the natural inclination to act gratefully,\nbut is not prepared to exert an effort of will to ensure grateful\naction when first-order inclinations fail, might not instantiate\nfullest gratitude, but what we might call \u201cfair-weather\ngratitude\u201d. Still, though, it seems plausible that a beneficiary\nwho never acts gratefully from natural inclination, and must\nalways exert an effort of will, almost certainly falls short of\ngratitude, regardless of whether he acts for the right reasons.\n3.5 Ingratitude and Overgratitude\n\nClarity on the elements of the grateful response is critical for\ndeveloping an accurate account of what gratitude actually is (see\n section 4\n below); but it also helps clarify several ways in which a beneficiary\nwho owes gratitude can fail to be properly grateful. In the first\nplace, knowing the elements of the grateful response sheds light on\nall the ways a beneficiary can be ungrateful.\nIngratitude (the state of being ungrateful) can be thought of\nas the absence or deficiency of one or more of the elements of the\ngrateful response when gratitude is in fact called for in a particular\nbeneficiary. A beneficiary, then, can be ungrateful in one (or more)\nof several ways. Forgetfulness, apathy, pride and laziness, for\ninstance, are all generally characterized as vices or shortcomings in\nthemselves; but when they result in the absence or deficiency of\ngrateful memory, grateful feelings, a willingness to acknowledge a\nbenefactor\u2019s benevolence, or grateful reciprocity in a\nbeneficiary, they may very well also amount to species of ingratitude\n(Aquinas II\u2013II, q. 104, art. 2; Manela 2019). We might label\nthese species of ingratitude with reference to the shortcomings in the\nelements by which they are constituted: cognitive\ningratitude for the inattentive or forgetful beneficiary;\naffective ingratitude for the coldhearted or apathetic\nbeneficiary; expressive ingratitude for the overly prideful\nbeneficiary, and conative or motivational\ningratitude for the lazy beneficiary. Ungrateful beneficiaries\nmay, of course, instantiate more than one species of ingratitude in\nresponse to the same instance of beneficence.\n\nWithin the category of ingratitude, Aquinas (II\u2013II, q. 104, art.\n3) points to another helpful distinction. A beneficiary can be\nungrateful by having a certain element of the grateful response to an\ninsufficient degree (e.g., not being willing enough to help a\nbenefactor in need; not being quite pleased enough when a benefactor\nfares well; etc.). Manela (2019) calls this sub-gratitude. A\nbeneficiary can also be ungrateful by having and instantiating the\nopposite or negation of some particular element. For\ninstance, in response to a genuine act of benevolence, a beneficiary\nmight actually come to resent his benefactor; and rather than feeling\nany motivation to benefit her in the future, he may find himself\ninclined to set back her interests. These tendencies might arise out\nof envious reflection on how morally superior a benefactor\u2019s\nbenevolence makes her. Manela (2019) labels this type of ingratitude\nanti-gratitude. \n\nIngratitude is not the only way a beneficiary might reprehensibly fail\nto have an appropriate degree of the elements of the grateful\nresponse. Several philosophers have noted that an\noverabundance of any of the elements of gratitude, beyond the\nlevel called for by some genuine act of benevolence, might also\nconstitute a moral failing of a certain kind. Card (1988), for\ninstance, writes that grateful beliefs or feelings toward someone who\nhas not earned them might be a mark of servility, or a lack\nof self-respect, on the part of the beneficiary who has them. Manela\n(2018; 2019) calls this moral failing overgratitude. It is\nimportant to note, however, that a beneficiary may go beyond what\ngratitude calls for without being servile. An extravagant thank-you\ngift might not necessarily signal servility on the part of a\nbeneficiary, if he did not sacrifice excessively in giving it, or\noverestimate the favor his benefactor did for him, even if he might\nhave been properly grateful in presenting his benefactor with a less\nextravagant gift.\n4. Accounts of Gratitude\n\nInformed by philosophical reflection on the elements of the grateful\nresponse\n (section 3),\n philosophers have developed various accounts of gratitude that\nconceptualize and classify it as a certain kind of phenomenon. This\nsection critically summarizes four prominent ways philosophers have\ntried to conceptualize and classify gratitude. All of these accounts\nhighlight important features of gratitude and its relationship to\nother concepts, like the vices of ingratitude or pride, or the\nnegative reactive attitude of resentment. Each conceptualization,\nhowever, does an imperfect job of accounting for all the elements of\nthe grateful response (though not all of them purport to be\ncomprehensive conceptualizations that account for every element of the\ngrateful response).\n4.1 Gratitude as Emotion\n\nGratitude is often conceptualized as an emotion (see, e.g.,\nMacnamara 2019). Emotions, such as fear and sadness, are occurrent\ncomplex mental states that arise in response to certain stimuli. They\nare more than just feelings, in that emotions are\nintentional, or about something, while feelings (like the\nfeeling of euphoria) need not be; and emotions imply or include\nbeliefs and motivational tendencies, while feelings need not. On the\nother hand, emotions differ from moods, like anxiety, in that\nan emotion is usually more short-lived than a mood, which can be\nlonger lasting, and not about anything in particular. Emotions are\noften thought to involve certain propositional content, and thus to\nserve the function of representing the world (and, particularly, their\nstimulus) as being a certain way. To say that gratitude is an emotion,\nthen, is to say that gratitude is a particular complex of beliefs,\nfeelings and motivational tendencies arising in a beneficiary in\nresponse to, and targeted at, an act of beneficence from a benefactor.\nGratitude as an emotion may involve propositional content (e.g., that\nbenefactor R performed some benevolent act for me), and may\nrepresent its target as being a certain way (e.g., benefactor\nR is benevolent, brave, cares about me).\n\nConceiving of gratitude as an emotion has a certain plausibility. The\nconcept of emotion provides a familiar framework for integrating many\nof the cognitive, affective and conative elements of the grateful\nresponse under one conceptual roof. Nevertheless, conceptualizing\ngratitude as an emotion (and nothing more) comes at certain\ntheoretical costs. The first stems from the fact that emotions are\nepisodic: an emotion is typically not the sort of thing we\nexperience or undergo continuously for years at a time. But though a\nbeneficiary might go years without instantiating or experiencing the\nemotion of gratitude, he might still all that time be\ngrateful to some benefactor for a genuine act of benevolence performed\nin the past, insofar as he is properly disposed to believe, feel and\nact toward her as a grateful beneficiary should. An analogy with the\nemotion of love is helpful here. It is (often) true that I love my\nmother in moments when I do not experience any emotion of love\nregarding her (in moments when my full attention is on some other\nemotionally salient object, say). This suggests that whatever love is,\nit must be more than the emotion of love. So too for gratitude.\n\nIn the second place, conceiving of gratitude as an emotion might\nincline us to overlook a certain way in which the grateful beneficiary\nis sometimes motivated to grateful action. An emotion influences\nbehavior in a particular way\u2014that is, by providing or\nconstituting a certain natural inclination. A grateful beneficiary,\nhowever, might sometimes find his natural inclinations to benefit a\nbenefactor overwhelmed by other natural inclinations; and in these\ncases, a truly grateful beneficiary will be prepared to muster an\neffort of will to act against the balance of his natural inclinations\n(see\n section 3.4.2\n above). Most conceptions of emotion, however, do not allow that\nemotions can motivate in this particular way. Insofar as this\npreparedness to muster an effort of will is necessary for true\ngratitude, then, it may be misleading to claim that gratitude is\n(nothing more than) an emotion. It might be fairer to say that many of\nthe elements of gratitude can be explained by or accounted for in an\nemotion (what we might call the emotion of gratitude), but\nthere is more to gratitude (the proper response to an act of\nbeneficence from an agent) than can be accounted for in an\nemotion.\n4.2 Gratitude as Reactive Attitude\n\nGratitude is sometimes described as a reactive\nattitude\u2014a term originally coined by P.F. Strawson (1974)\nto characterize certain natural responses we as humans have to the\ngoodwill, ill will or disregard other persons evince for us.\nResentment, for instance, is the fitting reactive attitude to a lack\nof goodwill, or presence of ill will, toward oneself from another\nperson. For Strawson, the reactive attitudes also include\nvicarious attitudes\u2014reactions to the ill will others\nevince toward third parties. The vicarious reactive analog to\nresentment, for instance, would be indignation. Reactive attitudes can\nbe had toward oneself as well, as in the guilt a wrongdoer might feel\nupon committing a resentment-worthy act of ill will or disregard. What\nthe reactive attitudes have in common, according to Strawson, is that\nthey \u201crest on\u201d and \u201creflect\u201d expectations and\ndemands for minimal levels of goodwill we make of others. In this way,\nthe reactive attitudes are expressed in (and perhaps constitutive of)\ntreating other agents as morally responsible. The reactive attitudes\nthus fundamentally differ from the \u201cobjective\u201d attitudes\nwe might take toward inanimate objects, or toward others\u2019\nbehavior that does not evince any ill will. Such events and behaviors\nmight make us angry or joyful; but only when they reflect a\nresponsible agent\u2019s goodwill or ill will as falling below or\nrising above a normative expectation is a reactive attitude, like\nresentment or gratitude, appropriate. To conceptualize gratitude as a\nStrawsonian reactive attitude, then, is to see it as the proper\nreaction to another person\u2019s exceeding minimum expectations of\ngoodwill toward oneself\u2014a reaction which is the positive\ncorrelate of resentment (Strawson 1974: 6); the second-personal analog\nof praise and pride; and the participant or reactive analog of the\nobjective attitudes of joy or appreciation.\n\nConceiving of gratitude within Strawson\u2019s framework of reactive\nattitudes fruitfully highlights certain distinctions and parallels\nthat are easily overlooked. For example, it nicely highlights the\ndistinction between gratitude proper (a response to the agency of\nanother person) and appreciation or joy (the objective counterpart to\nthe reactive attitude of gratitude), emphasizing that the former is a\nresponse to goodwill (see\n section 1\n above). It also highlights the fact that gratitude can sometimes,\nlike blame and resentment, play a complex communicative role: just as\nblame can both 1) recognize a person\u2019s conduct as blameworthy\nand 2) call for that person to hold herself accountable, gratitude can\n1) recognize a person\u2019s conduct as benevolent and 2) call for\nthe benefactor to recognize her benevolent act as worthy of\napprobation (Macnamara 2013). Treating gratitude within the\nStrawsonian framework also presents several theoretical challenges and\npitfalls. For instance, it may tempt us to overstate the similarities\nand overlook the asymmetries between gratitude and resentment, several\nprominent examples of which are pointed out by Justin Coates (2019).\nIn this vein, some philosophers have suggested that the traditional\nStrawsonian picture of gratitude is problematic insofar as it implies\nthat gratitude, like resentment, is an attitude through which we hold\nothers responsible (Bennett 1980: 42; Wallace 1994: 27). Strawson\n(1974) suggests that gratitude is a reactive attitude, and that the\nreactive attitudes have an essential connection to the practice of\nholding others to normative expectations. Resentment, indignation and\nguilt, for instance, are proper reactions when someone has fallen\nshort of such expectations. Pride, approval and gratitude, on this\nview, would be the proper reactions to an exceeded expectation (Martin\n2014: 120). Gratitude, however, may not always be called for in\nresponse to an exceeded expectation, and sometimes gratitude seems\ncalled for when no expectation has been exceeded (see\n section 2).\n If this is true, then gratitude is fundamentally different from\nresentment, indignation and guilt, in that gratitude is not\nconceptually tied to normative expectations. Instead, it may be\nconceptually tied to another form of interpersonal engagement, like\n\u201cnormative hope\u201d (Martin 2014).\n4.3 Gratitude as Relationship Enhancement\n\nSome philosophers have conceptualized gratitude, and the benevolence\nto which it is a response, in terms of the relationships they enhance.\nOn these accounts, a genuine act of benevolence is thought to signal a\ndesire or intention to start or to deepen a friendship (Swinburne\n1989: 65), and gratitude is the reciprocation of this intention, which\nenhances or advances the relationship. Wellman (1999b: 287), for\ninstance, writes that a beneficiary who has accepted a genuine act of\nbenevolence should \u201cnaturally be inclined to take a more active\ninterest both in [the benefactor\u2019s] well-being and in their\nfriendship\u201d, and Blustein (1982: 190) writes that while\ngratitude does not presuppose a preexisting personal relationship,\n\u201cit establishes one by some form of\nreciprocation.\u201d That reciprocation, which he calls gratitude,\nencourages friendship. Most recently, Scanlon (2008: 151) has\nadvocated a similar \u201crelationship-enhancement\u201d view of\ngratitude. For Scanlon, gratitude\n\nis not just a positive emotion but also an awareness that one\u2019s\nrelationship with a person has been altered by some action or attitude\non that person\u2019s part.\n\n\nThat awareness is reflected in appropriately modified intentions,\nexpectations, and other attitudes on the part of the beneficiary.\n\nRelationship-enhancement views of gratitude underscore the important\n(perhaps even necessary) role that benevolence and gratitude play in\ninitiating and deepening relationships, like friendships and romantic\nrelationships. Relationship-enhancement views also highlight the\nimportant role acts of benevolence and gratitude might play in\nrelationship repair\u2014the process of rebuilding a relationship\nafter wrong or harm has been committed. But while\nrelationship-enhancement views may paint an accurate picture of\ngratitude between relative strangers or within growing friendships,\nthey seem to leave little room for gratitude within friendships that\nare already sufficiently deep and healthy. Between two extremely close\nfriends, most of the elements of a grateful response might already be\nin place. Each might already believe that the other would sacrifice\ngreatly to help him if he were in need, might already feel profound\ngoodwill for the other, and might already be willing to sacrifice\nsubstantially in order to save the other from harm. When one friend\nactually performs a genuine act of benevolence for the other, the\nbeneficiary would have no reason to revise his expectations\nor intentions or affective dispositions vis-\u00e0-vis his\nbenefactor in light of that; and yet a great deal of gratitude may be\nowed. This suggests that gratitude must be something more than a\nchange in these elements.\n\nAnother problem faced by certain relationship-enhancement views is the\nimplication that a beneficiary who does not want to develop a\nfriendship with the benefactor is, for that reason, ungrateful. This\nimplication does not seem warranted. It is possible, after all, for a\nbeneficiary to be grateful but uninterested in deepening a bond with\nhis benefactor. Perhaps he finds his benefactor irritating to be\naround. Perhaps he is too busy to spend time cultivating a new\nrelationship. Perhaps he is simply a loner. All these possibilities\nseem, intuitively, to be consistent with such a beneficiary avoiding\ningratitude; and insofar as they are, gratitude must be something more\nthan the tendency to develop relationships, at least in the sense of\nfriendship or romance.\n4.4 Gratitude as Virtue\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that gratitude is best construed as a\nvirtue (Meilaender 1984; Wellman 1999b). Virtues are morally positive\ncharacter traits\u2014stable dispositions to think, feel and act in\ncertain ways under certain circumstances. Construed as a virtue,\ngratitude would be the stable disposition to respond to\ngratitude-worthy acts of beneficence with the beliefs, feelings and\nbehavioral tendencies (outlined in\n section 3)\n that characterize the properly grateful response (Manela 2019).\nConceiving of gratitude as a virtue has some plausibility. Like the\nconcept of emotion, virtue as a concept seems well-suited to\nintegrating the affective and motivational elements of the grateful\nresponse. Unlike emotions, though, virtues are dispositions,\nnot episodes, so they can be possessed without being occurrent.\nConceiving of gratitude as a virtue thus allows us to attribute\ngratitude to a beneficiary who may not be experiencing any grateful\nfeelings, beliefs or motivations in a given moment. Moreover,\nconstruing gratitude as a virtue captures nicely the moral\nphenomenology of how we tend to respond to evidence of ingratitude.\nWhen we respond critically to a beneficiary\u2019s act of ingratitude\nor lack of grateful feeling on some particular occasion, we are often\ncriticizing his character rather than some specific action or inaction\nor decision on his part (Wellman 1999b: 285). Furthermore, gratitude\nfits nicely into Aristotle\u2019s picture of virtue as a mean between\nan excess and a deficiency, with gratitude being a mean between the\nvices of arrogant, prideful or envious ingratitude, on one hand, and\nthe obsequiousness or servility of overgratitude, on the other (see\n section 3.5).\n Construing gratitude as a character trait that straddles two vices\nhas allowed philosophers to contribute to practical debates about\nteaching or training children to be properly grateful (see, e.g., Carr\net al. 2015; Manela 2019). And construing gratitude as a character\ntrait may provide a way for environmental ethicists to argue that we\nought to be grateful to nature even if, strictly speaking, nature is\nnot the sort of thing that can deserve gratitude (Hill 1983; cf.\nManela 2018).\n\nConceptualizing gratitude as a virtue, however, presents certain\ntheoretical pitfalls and drawbacks. For instance, conceptualizing\ngratitude as a virtue has tempted some philosophers (e.g., Wellman\n1999b) to infer that there is no such thing as an obligation\nof gratitude, though this inference may not be warranted (Manela\n2019). Furthermore, if gratitude were a virtue, then it should be\nnatural to ascribe it to certain people as a general, global character\ntrait, the way temperance, patience, or thoughtfulness might be\nascribed to someone. More often than not, however, people are not\ngrateful or ungrateful tout court, but grateful only\nvis-\u00e0-vis certain people, and ungrateful vis-\u00e0-vis\ncertain others. A man might be reliably predisposed to form and\nmaintain grateful feelings, beliefs and conations in response to\nbenevolence from strangers, but radically disinclined to form them in\nresponse to, say, a sibling or a parent. A person might not generally\nbe disposed to form grateful dispositions toward anyone, but might\nstill form a proper and lasting grateful disposition toward a\nparticular benefactor for a particular act of beneficence she\nperformed for him. Alternatively, a person might be generally inclined\nto form grateful dispositions toward the right people at the right\ntimes, but might lapse and fail to do so toward a particular person on\na particular occasion. Are such beneficiaries grateful? The lack of an\neasy answer, and the commonness of such cases, reminds us that when it\ncomes to gratitude, we are often interested in particular episodes or\ninstances of gratitude, not always global character traits like the\nvirtue of gratitude (Carr 2013; Manela 2019). \n5. Gratitude and Obligation\n\nThe deontic status of gratitude (whether we can have moral obligations\nof gratitude) is a topic of continued debate. In this debate, much\ndepends on how \u201cmoral obligation\u201d is defined. The term is\nsometimes used loosely in moral philosophy to refer to anything we\nmorally ought to do or be; but such a loose use of the term misses the\nheart of the disagreement between philosophers of gratitude. Virtually\nno philosopher denies that beneficiaries morally ought to be grateful.\nPhilosophers are split, however, on whether gratitude implies\nobligations in the stricter, more specific way one might have an\nobligation to keep a promise, say, or to refrain from lying to another\nperson. To say that something is obligatory in this stricter sense is\nto say that it is binding. It something that must be\ndone. It admits of little or no latitude, and failing to do it is not\njust bad or lousy, but prima facie wrong.\n\nDefinitions of obligation aside, much also hinges on the precise\nquestion being asked. Some philosophers start with what we might call\nthe broad question: whether gratitude itself is an obligation\n(Camenisch 1981: 10; Blustein 1982; Heyd 1982: 109\u2013111;\nMeilaender 1984: 156; Swinburne 1989: 65\u201366; Wellman 1999b:\n291). This question, however, is infelicitous. Gratitude is a complex\nphenomenon (see\n section 2),\n consisting of cognitive, affective and conative elements. Some of\nthese elements may be obligations, others not\u2014and the broad\nquestion is problematic insofar as it rules out this possibility.\nAnother question philosophers sometimes use to begin an inquiry into\nthe deontic status of gratitude is whether gratitude is a\nsource of obligations (Carr 2013). This question too is\nmisleading, since if any of the elements of the grateful response are\nobligatory, then technically, the source (cause or basis) of such\nobligations would be the benefactor\u2019s \u03c6-ing, not the\nbeneficiary\u2019s response itself. Rather than asking whether\ngratitude is an obligation, or whether it is a\nsource of obligation, a more fruitful question to ask is whether\nthere are obligations of gratitude (and, if so, what they\nare). This question allows for the possibility that only certain\nelements of the grateful response may be obligatory, the way\npromise-keeping is, and it does not obscure the fact that the source\nor root of such obligations would be a benefactor\u2019s\nbeneficence.\n5.1 Arguments For and Against Obligations of Gratitude\n\nIt is widely held that the cognitive and affective elements of the\ngrateful response cannot be obligatory. Most philosophers agree that\nin order for some \u03c8 to qualify as a moral obligation (in the\nstrict sense that there are moral obligations of promise-keeping),\n\u03c8 must be something over which an agent has direct control; and\ninsofar as agents do not have direct control over their beliefs and\nfeelings, they cannot have obligations to have grateful beliefs and\nfeelings (Berger 1975: 306; Simmons 1979: 166\u2013167; Camenisch\n1981: 11; McConnell 1993: 83). Two points are worth noting, however,\nregarding obligation and grateful feeling and belief. The first is\nthat even if beliefs and affects cannot be obligatory, the absence of\nsuch attitudes may still be blameworthy or\nreprehensible, at least insofar as we can be blamed or held\nresponsible for things beyond our direct control. A second point worth\nnoting is that we may have an obligation to cultivate such\nattitudes, insofar as trying to bring them about is within our direct\ncontrol (Dyck 1973: 48; Weiss 1985: 494).\n\nThanking seems a more plausible candidate for an obligation of\ngratitude than grateful affects and beliefs, since doing or saying the\nthings necessary to express, demonstrate or communicate one\u2019s\ngrateful attitudes appears to be within a beneficiary\u2019s direct\ncontrol. Against this, it might be argued that beneficiaries cannot\nhave an obligation to thank, since thanking implies sincere\nexpression, demonstration or communication of beliefs and affects, and\nwhether a beneficiary has these attitudes (and thus whether his thanks\nare sincere) is beyond his control. In response, it might be pointed\nout that certain \u201cexpressions\u201d seem sometimes to be\nobligatory, regardless of whether they are sincere. For instance, it\nseems plausible that offenders can be obligated to express contrition\nby apologizing for wrongs they\u2019ve done, even if they lack\napologetic beliefs and affects. It might also be pointed out that if\nthanking can serve as a commissive (see\n section 3.3),\n then thanking might be made sincere simply by forming the intention\nto develop grateful attitudes, if they are lacking at the time of\nthanks. Insofar as forming such an intention is within the direct\ncontrol of the beneficiary, the sincerity of thanks would be under his\ndirect control, and thanking might be a candidate for an obligation of\ngratitude.\n\nThe most plausible candidates for obligations of gratitude are\ninstances of grateful behavior (see\n section 3.4).\n Ordinary language seems to speak in favor of some of these behaviors\nbeing obligatory. The metaphor of debts of gratitude, which a\nbeneficiary pays to a benefactor by returning a favor, dates back\ncenturies, at least in the Anglophone linguistic tradition (Brandt\n1964: 386); and philosophers and writers throughout history have\ncondemned acts and omissions of ingratitude as among the most vicious\nof wrongs. Hume (1738 [2007]: III.I.I), for instance, wrote that\n\u201cOf all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing,\nthe most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude\u2026\u201d Kant wrote\nthat ingratitude was (along with envy and malice) \u201cthe essence\nof vileness and wickedness\u201d (Kant 1775\u20131780 [1981]). And\nSeneca (On Benefits) ranked ingrates below thieves, rapists\nand adulterers.\n\nObligation skeptics about gratitude present several arguments\nagainst the possibility that grateful behaviors can be obligatory. The\nfirst, which we might call the vagueness argument, says that\nwhile beneficiaries may have an obligation to return a favor upon a\nbenefactor at some point, the beneficiary has substantial latitude in\ndeciding when and how to bestow his grateful favor (Camenisch 1981:\n15\u201316; Fitzgerald 1998: 138). This latitude is consistent with\nhis having a certain sort of imperfect obligation (McConnell 1993);\nbut it does not amount to the sort of strict obligation had by a\npromisor or a debtor, who have little or no latitude in fulfilling\ntheir obligation by the agreed-upon time. In response to this,\nobligationists about gratitude (e.g., Manela 2015) have\npointed out that there are indeed certain acts of gratitude that seem\nto admit of no latitude\u2014specifically, acceding to a reasonable\nrequest from a benefactor in need or refraining from harming a\nbenefactor in certain ways that might be permissible if done to a\nstranger (see\n section 3.4.1).\n\nA second argument against the possibility of obligations of gratitude\nrelies on what is sometimes referred to as the correlativity\nthesis: if one person owes an obligation to another, then\nparadigmatically, the person to whom the obligation is owed has a\nright to the obligation\u2019s fulfillment, and thus has\nstanding to demand or exact fulfillment of the obligation. If\nY makes R a promise, for instance, then Y\nhas an obligation to R to keep the promise, and from this it\nfollows that R has a right that the promise be kept. If\nbeneficiaries had obligations of gratitude, the argument goes, these\nobligations would certainly be owed to their benefactors, and we would\nexpect benefactors to have a right to the fulfillment of such\nobligations. But no benefactor has a right to gratitude\u2014the\nstanding to demand or exact a return favor. Therefore, there are no\nobligations of gratitude (Wellman 1999b). Acts or omissions of\ningratitude, on this view, are not morally wrong or forbidden, though\nthey might be what Julia Driver (1992) calls\nsuberogatory\u2014bad to do, but not obligation-breaching\n(Wellman 1999b). In response to this argument, some obligationists\nabout gratitude have suggested modifying the correlativity thesis to\nallow that directed obligations need not entail standing to enforce or\nexact, but only standing to hold the obligee responsible in some\nweaker way. Darwall (2012), for instance, suggests that benefactors\ncan appropriately respond to ingratitude with a reactive attitude like\nresentment. Manela (2015) argues that benefactors can appropriately\nrespond to especially egregious instances of ingratitude by\nreproaching or remonstrating (though not demanding). He labels the\nstanding to remonstrate (though not demand) an \u201cimperfect\nright\u201d, and he holds that benefactors can have imperfect rights\nto certain acts of gratitude.\n\nTwo final arguments against the possibility of obligatory grateful\nbehavior concern the motivation and reasons on which the grateful\nbeneficiary acts. The first begins with the premise that acts of\ngratitude must be done spontaneously, or from natural inclination, in\norder to count as acts of gratitude. Moral obligations, however, are\nsupposed to be the sorts of things we can fulfill even if natural\ninclination is lacking, by exerting an effort of will. For example, I\ncan fulfill an obligation of justice even if I do not act from natural\ninclination, when I grudgingly repay a steep loan, for instance; and\nso it seems I can have obligations of justice. By contrast, the\npossibility of a moral obligation to laugh at a joke seems absurd, in\npart, because laughter is something that can only be done\nspontaneously or from natural inclination (Card 1988). Insofar as acts\nof gratitude must be done from natural inclination, the argument goes,\nsuch acts cannot be done by exerting an effort of will, and thus\ncannot be morally obligatory (Card 1988; Wellman 1999b). This argument\nmay be vulnerable to the objection that the initial premise (that acts\nof gratitude must be done from natural inclination to count as such)\nis false (see\n section 3.4.2).\n\nA final argument against the possibility of obligations of gratitude\nruns as follows: whether grateful acts must be done from natural\ninclination, beneficiaries must act from certain reasons in order for\ntheir actions to count as acts of gratitude (see\n section 3.4.2).\n But no one has direct control over what reasons he acts from (Ross\n2002). Beneficiaries, then, cannot have direct control over whether\nthey act gratefully; and if we can only be obligated to do what is in\nour direct control, no beneficiary can be obligated to act gratefully.\nObligationists about gratitude might object that this argument targets\na straw man understanding of obligations of gratitude. Obligations of\ngratitude, if they exist, are not obligations to\n\u03c8-and-\u03c8-for-the-right-reasons, but simply obligations to\n\u03c8\u2014just as promissory obligations are simply obligations to\ndo as promised, not obligations to\ndo-as-promised-and-do-so-for-the-right-reasons. We might criticize a\npromisor if she does as promised for \u201cwrong\u201d reasons\n(e.g., reasons of self-interest); but we still believe that such\nobligations exist, and that one need not act for the right reason to\navoid breaching or violating them (though one may thereby fail to\nrespect, fulfill or discharge such obligations)\n(McConnell 1993; Owens 2012). So too, an obligationist might argue,\nwith gratitude.\n5.2 Reluctance to Receive Beneficence\n\nIf there are indeed obligations of gratitude, this might be taken to\nimply the strange conclusion that we should do our best to avoid\naccepting or receiving favors or gifts. The spirit of this conclusion\ndates back at least to Aristotle, who wrote that the\nmegalopsychos\n\nis the sort of person who does good but is ashamed when he receives\nit; for doing good is proper to the superior person, and receiving it\nto the inferior. (Nicomachean Ethics: 1124b1110\u20131114)\n\n\nIn the modern era, Kant suggested in the Lectures on Ethics\nthat beneficiaries should cringe at receiving favors, since in doing\nso, a beneficiary becomes the debtor of his benefactor\u2014a\nshameful position (Kant 1775\u20131780 [1981]: 118\u2013119). For\nKant, owing an obligation of gratitude is especially bad,\nsince duties of gratitude are sacred duties\u2014duties\nwhich can never be fully discharged. This is because any attempt on a\nbeneficiary\u2019s part to \u201cpay off\u201d the debt of\ngratitude will always be done essentially as a reaction to the\noriginal act of benevolence. The benefactor alone has the honor of\nhaving acted benevolently in a purely proactive way. Insofar as we\nwould want to avoid being in such an eternally imbalanced\nrelationship, we should be wary of accepting gifts and favors.\n\nKant\u2019s worries about obligations of gratitude in the\nLectures on Ethics may be overstated. For one thing, it may\nwell be possible to discharge an obligation of gratitude, if by this\nwe mean get back on equal footing with a benefactor. A beneficiary\nmight one day bestow an act of benevolence for a stranger, only to\nfind out after the fact that the stranger was a benefactor of his from\nlong ago. Here, the beneficiary has benefited his benefactor, and has\ndone it not as any sort of reaction, but with the same sort of\noriginal proactive benevolence that motivated the original\nbenefactor\u2019s benevolence in the first place. Furthermore, even\nif it may be impossible ever to \u201cpay off\u201d an obligation of\ngratitude, it is usually not especially difficult to avoid\nviolating any such obligations, especially if the original\nfavor was small (Hewitt 1924). A beneficiary need not shape his life\naround respecting his obligations of gratitude, insofar as living up\nto those obligations might require only occasional minor return favors\non his part. Sacred duties of gratitude, then, need not be as\nburdensome as Kant originally suggested. And indeed, Kant himself\nseemed to soften his claims about accepting favors and the\npsychological effects of being under an obligation of gratitude. In\nthe Doctrine of Virtue, he noted that while it may be natural\nto feel shamed at being made a beneficiary, this shame is not\nrationally justified, and it results from a misunderstanding of the\nlegitimate sources of one\u2019s moral worth (Smit and Timmons\n2011).\n\nA more plausible picture of obligations of gratitude paints them as\nobligations that we ought not be upset at having. Even if those\nobligations sometimes land us in situations we find unpleasant, we\nshould not regret the benevolence that gave rise to those obligations.\nA similar point could be made about parenthood, love, or friendship.\nIn all such relationships, a parent, lover or friend will sometimes\nfind himself tightly constrained by certain obligations and\ncommitments. Such constraints may be in themselves unpleasant; but a\ngood parent, lover or friend will not take that unpleasantness as\nreason to regret the special relationship they stem from (Owens 2012).\nBy the same token, it might be argued that a good beneficiary will not\nregret or avoid having been shown benevolence, despite what\nobligations may arise as a result. Indeed, insofar as we incur moral\nobligations in accepting or receiving favors, we might even find\npleasure or pride in such obligations. Card (1988) argues that in\nbestowing a favor upon a beneficiary, we should see the benefactor as\nexpressing her faith in the beneficiary as someone worthy of\nbenevolence, and as someone who can be trusted to return a favor in\nthe future. Beneficiaries should see themselves not as debtors, with\nthe constant need to prove to benefactors that they are indeed\ngrateful, but as trustees, who already have the confidence of\ntheir depositors. On this \u201ctrusteeship paradigm\u201d,\nobligations of gratitude are obligations we are proud and honored to\nhave been given.\n\nStill, there may be wisdom in the point Kant makes in the\nLectures. We may want to be careful who we accept favors\nfrom, insofar as there are people whose interests we would not want to\nhave to consider in our future practical deliberations (Camenisch\n1981). Furthermore, even a competent trustee open for business will be\nreluctant to take on too many deposits, lest he find himself having to\npay too many back at the same time. That this reluctance may be\nreasonable finds support in the claim that sometimes, it seems,\nbenefactors may need to ask for permission before doing a favor (Card\n1988).\n5.3 Gratitude and Political Obligation\n\nOne question that hinges on gratitude\u2019s deontological status is\nthe question of whether political\nobligation\u2014subjects\u2019 obligations to their\nstate\u2014can be derived from subjects\u2019 gratitude to the\nstate. Political obligation is often understood in the specific sense\nof obligation to obey the laws and decrees of the state. With this\nunderstanding in mind, the argument from gratitude for political\nobligation runs roughly as follows:\n\n(1)The state benefits its subjects.\n(2)Subjects therefore owe obligations of gratitude to the\nstate.\n(3)Among these is the obligation not to harm the\nstate.\n(4)Disobeying the state\u2019s decrees and laws harms\nthe state.\n(5)Therefore, subjects have an obligation to obey the\nstate\u2019s laws and decrees.\n\n\nThis argument has an ancient pedigree (depending on how one interprets\nPlato [Crito]), and it boasts certain theoretical advantages\nover other derivations of political obligation. It explains, for\ninstance, why subjects have obligations to their own particular state,\nrather than, say, to every state that is just or legitimate. It also\ndoes a better job than other theories of political obligation at\nexplaining why refugees seem to have prima facie obligations to obey\nthe laws of their host countries, at least when those refugees are\ntreated generously, fairly and respectfully (D\u2019Cruz 2014). The\nargument from gratitude for political obligation has also been the\ntarget of many objections.\n\nOne set of objections targets the inference from (1) to (2), arguing\nthat even if the state benefits its subjects, it does not do so in a\nway that calls for gratitude (see\n section 2).\n Some might doubt, in the first place, whether a state, as a non-human\nentity, is capable of intentionally benefiting anyone. In\nresponse to this objection, A.D.M. Walker (1988) points out that we\nsometimes feel gratitude to schools or universities we\u2019ve\nattended for what we take to have been their goodwill or benevolence\ntoward their students. It might be doubted whether states can be the\nproper objects of obligations\u2014that is, whether they are capable\nof having obligations owed to them. As Terrance McConnell (1993)\nnotes, though, we seem to be able to owe obligations of repayment to\ncorporations that have lent us money. Furthermore, the fact that\ninstitutions seem to be able to owe gratitude to individuals suggests\nthat they should be capable of deserving it from individuals as well\n(McConnell 1993: 196).\n\nStates\u2019 agential capacities aside, there are several reasons to\ndoubt whether states have the primary intention of benefiting their\nsubjects and whether states actually sacrifice in granting the\nbenefits they grant (Simmons 1979: 185\u2013188). In the first place,\nthe fact that states receive taxes from their citizens in exchange for\nthe benefits they confer seems to undermine the claim that beneficence\nis a state\u2019s primary intention, and that states make sacrifices\nin order to benefit their subjects. Defenders of the link between (1)\nand (2) might point out that many states spend more money conferring\nbenefits on their subjects than they take in from taxes. They might\nalso note that many subjects receive great benefits from the state\ndespite paying few or no taxes (Walker 1988: 209). Critics, however,\npoint out that every tax-paying subject\u2014even those who pay\nminimal taxes\u2014is forced by the state to pay them (Klosko 1989:\n354; Wellman 1999a: 73). Someone who forces benefits on me, and forces\nme to pay a share for them, may thereby undermine his desert of\ngratitude. Finally, it might be argued that even if the state provides\nsome benefits to its subjects, and provides them intentionally, the\nstate may still lose its claim to gratitude if it subsequently harms\nthose subjects, which many states do through unjust laws or other\ntypes of repression and persecution.\n\nOther critics of the argument from gratitude might concede (2), that\nsubjects owe gratitude to the state, and (3), that this entails a\nspecific obligation not to harm the state, but deny (4), that\ndisobeying the state\u2019s decrees and laws actually harms the\nstate. Such critics could argue that while flouting a state\u2019s\nlaws and decrees might undermine general compliance with those laws,\ndisobeying them secretly or privately need not lead to this\nconsequence. They might also argue that publicly disobeying laws and\ndecrees might not harm the state insofar as those laws and decrees are\nunjust. Public acts of civil disobedience against unjust laws might\nactually improve the state, insofar as they hasten the abolition of\nthose laws, and those laws are detrimental to the state.\n\nIn light of these objections, several philosophers have fallen back on\na version of the argument from gratitude with a weaker and more\nlimited conclusion. Considerations of gratitude, they argue, might\nground the claim that some subjects have some\nobligations of gratitude to the state. McConnell (1993) suggests that\nonly those who have been benefited by the state, and not subsequently\ntreated unfairly by it, might owe the state obligations of gratitude.\nAs for the specific obligations these subjects owe to the state, they\nmay not include the obligation to obey laws and decrees (cf. D\u2019Cruz\n2014); but they may include certain other obligations of wider\nlatitude, e.g., to aid one\u2019s own country in various ways,\nparticipate in civic organizations, vote, or volunteer for a year of\nnational service (McConnell 1993: 207). Ingratitude to the state may\nalso justify special punishment for treason, or for acts aimed\nsquarely at the destruction of the state. Insofar as the state claims\nthe right to compel every subject\u2019s obedience to the laws,\nthough, obligations of gratitude could not be the whole justification\nfor political obligation generally (Klosko 1989: 358).\n\nThe argument from gratitude for political obligation, even in its\nweaker form, might have important ramifications for questions of\npolitical obligation and political authority more generally. For\ninstance, if some subjects have obligations of gratitude to the state,\nand obligations of gratitude cannot be exacted or demanded, then the\nquestion of political obligation (what obligations a subject owes to\nthe state) and the question of political authority (what the state has\na right to demand of its subjects) do not have coextensive answers\n(McConnell 1993: 208).\n",
