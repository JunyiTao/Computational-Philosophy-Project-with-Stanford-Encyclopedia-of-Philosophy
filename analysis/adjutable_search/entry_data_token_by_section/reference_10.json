    "main_text": "Four Models of Linguistic Reference\n6. Negative Views of Reference\n\nSo far, this article has been concerned with what might be called\n\u2018positive\u2019 views of reference. Reference, construed as a\nrelation between bits of language and bits of reality, is assumed to\nbe a genuine, substantive relation worthy of philosophical \nscrutiny\u2014or perhaps a family of such relations. Accounts are then\noffered of what constitutes this link. Some philosophers have even\ntried to work up from this link to more substantive conclusions\nabout the nature of knowledge and reality (see, in particular, Putnam\n(1981); see also the entry on\n skepticism and content externalism).\n But not all philosophers are so sanguine about the theoretical\nsignificance of reference, or even the thesis that there is either one\nor a family of substantive relations to be explained. In closing, we\nwill briefly discuss several \u2018negative\u2019 views of\nreference. \n\nW.V.O. Quine is probably the most famous reference skeptic. In\nhis (1960), he argued that reference is inherently indeterminate or\n\u2018inscrutable\u2019. By this, Quine means that there is no fact\nof the matter about what our words refer to. This is not to say that\nour words refer to something but we are unable to determine what that\nis. Rather, there is simply no such thing as that to which our words\nrefer. Nevertheless, Quine does not go so far as to say that our words\nfail to refer in any sense. His view is rather that it makes sense to\nspeak of what our words refer to only relative to some purpose we\nmight have in assigning referents to those words. Quine\u2019s argument for\nthe inscrutability thesis involves an application of the thesis that\nempirical theories are underdetermined by their supporting evidence.\nFor any body of empirical evidence we might have about speakers of a\ngiven language, there will be a number of competing theories regarding\nwhat their words refer to. Such theories will be empirically\nequivalent, equally consistent with the empirical data. One theory\nmight say that, in the language in question,\n\u2018gavagai\u2019 refers to rabbits; another might say\nthat it refers to undetached rabbit parts; a third might say that it\nrefers to time-slices of rabbits. Quine\u2019s views on underdetermination\ncan be applied to one\u2019s own language as well. The result is that the\navailable evidence no more forces the speaker to the conclusion that\nby \u2018rabbit\u2019 she means rabbits than it forces her to\nconclude that by \u2018rabbit\u2019 she means undetached rabbit\nparts or time-slices of rabbits. If a speaker observes herself using\nthe word \u2018rabbit,\u2019 the evidence she amasses will give\nequal support to all three theories, as well as to many others. So,\naccording to Quine, for any given body of empirical evidence, there\nwill be numerous competing theories as to what the words one uses\nrefer to. And there will be no principled way of adjudicating between\nthese\n theories.[15]\n\nA related and much-discussed problem, the problem of the many, was\nraised by Peter Unger (1980) and Geach (1980). Basically, the idea is\nthat with many, probably even most, physical objects, there are any\nnumber of equally compelling candidates for their borders, and hence\ntheir physical constitution. In the terms we\u2019ve been dealing with\nhere, there are any number of equally compelling candidates for being\nthe referent of a singular referential term, like \u2018that\u2019,\nwhen that term is being used to target a physical object. Without some\nway of selecting one of these as somehow privileged, we might wonder\nwhether we should really think of such terms as referring\u2014unless, \nthat is, we are happy to accept that apparently-singular\nreferential terms in fact refer to sets of objects, vague objects, or\nthe\n like.[16]\n\nDonald Davidson\u2019s instrumentalist views on reference are in some sense\nmore radical still. Davidson (1984) claims that reference\nis a theoretically vacuous notion: it is of absolutely no use in a\nsemantic theory, or a theory of strict and literal meaning. His basis\nfor endorsing this position is his conviction that no\nsubstantive explanation of reference is possible. The problem\nis that any such explanation would have to be given in\nnon-linguistic terms, but no such explanation can be given,\nDavidson claims. As Davidson puts it: if the name\n\u2018Kilimanjaro\u2019 refers to Kilimanjaro, then no doubt there\nis some relation between English (or Swahili) speakers, the word, and\nthe mountain. But it is inconceivable that one should be able to\nexplain this relation without first explaining the role of the words\nin the sentences; and if this is so, there is no chance of explaining\nreference directly in non-linguistic terms. However, this does not\nmean that there is no hope for semantics. On the contrary, on\nDavidson\u2019s view, a theory of truth for a language is at the same time\na theory of meaning for that language. The point here is that a\nDavidsonian theory of meaning has no place for the notion of reference\nper se; instead, it assimilates what we might be tempted to call\n\u2018reference\u2019 into the theory of linguistic truth. That might, however,\nprove compatible with the sorts of pluralist approaches to reference\nwe canvassed above.\n\nSimilar in spirit to Davidson\u2019s view are deflationist theories of\nreference\u2014not to be confused with deflationism about truth,\nthough often motivated by a desire to endorse that latter theory.\nDeflationists about truth typically claim that to assert that a\nstatement is true is just to assert the statement itself.\nDeflationists about reference, on the other hand, claim that there is\nnothing more to the notion of reference than what is captured by\ninstances of a schema like: \u2018a\u2019 refers to\na. Such a schema generates claims like \u2018Frege\u2019\nrefers to Frege, claims which can seem perfectly plausible until we\nconsider the problem of names with multiple bearers or indexicals,\nboth pure and impure. In such cases, the deflationist might then reach\nfor a slightly more complex schema incorporating the notion of a use\nof a term. But then we need to ask what is meant by a\n\u2018use\u2019 in these circumstances, and once we start to answer\nthis question it becomes increasingly unclear whether a truly\ndeflationist approach to reference can in fact be\n preserved.[17]\n\nIn spite of the myriad concerns which motivate these\n\u2018negative\u2019 views of reference, concerns which might well\nmake us rethink the idea that there is any one relation which deserves\nto be called \u2018reference\u2019, the nature of the relation\nbetween language and reality continues to be one of the most talked\nabout and vigorously debated issues in the philosophy of language.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether and to what extent this work might\nprove useful for understanding a broader notion of reference, or a\nbroader notion of the relationship between representational tokens and\nthe world around us, which is equally at home in aesthetics, ethics,\nand the philosophy of mind as it is in the philosophy of language.\n",
