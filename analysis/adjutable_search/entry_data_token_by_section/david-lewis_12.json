    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Natural Properties\n4.6 Natural Properties\n\nOne classic problem for interpretationism is that our dispositions\nmassively underdetermine contents. I believe that (healthy) grass is\ngreen. But for some interpretations of\n \u2018grue\u2019,\n ascribing to me the belief that grass is grue will fit my\ndispositions just as well. As Lewis points out towards the end of\n\u201cNew Work For a Theory of Universals\u201d (1983e), if we are\nallowed to change the interpretations of my beliefs and desires at the\nsame time, the fit can be made even better. This looks like a problem\nfor interpretationism.\n\nThe problem is of course quite familiar. In different guises it is\n Goodman\u2019s grue/green problem,\n Kripkenstein\u2019s plus/quus problem, Quine\u2019s\n gavagai\n problem, and\n Putnam\u2019s puzzle\n of the brain in a vat with true beliefs (Goodman 1955, Wittgenstein\n1953, Kripke 1982, Quine 1960, Putnam 1981). One way or another it has\nto be solved.\n\nLewis\u2019s solution turns on a metaphysical posit. Some properties,\nhe says, are more natural than others. The natural properties\nare those that, to use an ancient phrase, carve nature at the joints.\nThey make for objective resemblance amongst the objects that have\nthem, and objective dissimilarity between things that have them and\nthose that lack them. The natural properties, but not in general the\nunnatural properties, are relevant to the causal powers of things.\nAlthough science is in the business of discovering which natural\nproperties are instantiated, when Lewis talks about natural properties\nhe doesn\u2019t mean properties given a special role by nature. It is\nnot a contingent matter which properties are natural, because it\nisn\u2019t a contingent matter which properties make for objective\nsimilarity.\n\nSome properties are perfectly natural. Other properties are less\nnatural, but not all unnatural properties are alike. Green things are\na diverse and heterogeneous bunch, but they are more alike than the\ngrue things are. And the grue things are more alike than some other\neven more disjunctive bunches. So as well as positing perfectly\nnatural properties, Lewis posits a relation of more and less natural\non properties. He suggests that we just need to take the perfectly\nnatural as primitive, and we can define the naturalness of other\nproperties in terms of it. The idea is that the naturalness of a\nproperty is a function of the complexity of that property\u2019s\ndefinition in terms of perfectly natural properties. It isn\u2019t at\nall obvious that this suggestion will capture the intuitive idea, and\nLewis does not defend it at any length.\n\nNatural properties will play a major role for Lewis. We\u2019ve\nalready seen one place where it turns out they are needed; namely, in\nsaying what it is for two worlds to have an \u2018exact match\u2019\nof spatiotemporal regions. What Lewis means by that is that the\nregions are intrinsic duplicates. And the way he analyses intrinsic\nduplication in (1983e) is that two things are duplicates if they have\nthe same intrinsic properties. We will see many other uses of natural\nproperties as we go along, particularly in the discussion of Humean\nsupervenience in section 5.\n\nBut as Lewis (1983e) makes clear, natural properties play many more\nroles in his larger philosophy, including in the theory of\nrationality, the theory of mental content, the theory of linguistic\ncontent, and the theory of laws. It is rational to have a belief with\na more natural rather than a less natural content. If two different\nassignments of beliefs and desires would make equally good sense of an\nagent\u2019s dispositions, the more natural assignment is the correct\none. If two different interpretations of the words of a public\nlanguage would make equally good sense of speakers\u2019 practices,\nthe more natural interpretation is the correct one. And laws are\nsimple generalisations, where simplicity is defined in part in terms\nof naturalness.\n\nThere is some scholarly dispute about the relationship between the\nfour theses set out in the last four sentences of the preceding\nparagraph. Williams (2007) argues that the thesis about laws is\nexplanatorily prior to some of the theses about rationality and\ncontent. Sider (2001) argues that the third thesis is a standalone\npart of Lewis\u2019s theory. Schwarz (2014), however, argues that it\nisn\u2019t even a part of Lewis\u2019s theory. Weatherson (2003)\nendorses Sider\u2019s view, but later Weatherson (2013) endorses\nSchwarz\u2019s critique of Sider\u2019s interpretation, while\narguing that a qualified version of the third thesis can nevertheless\nbe derived from the first two. (A version of Schwarz\u2019s paper had\nbeen in circulation since 2006, so it well precedes Weatherson\u2019s\n2013 paper, despite the slightly later publication date.)\nJanssen-Lauret and MacBride (2020) respond to Schwarz, arguing that\nevidence from Lewis\u2019s recently available correspondence supports\nthe view that Lewis took naturalness to play a central role in\ndetermining the reference of individual words.\n\nThis topic, natural properties, was one of very few topics where Lewis\nhad a serious change of view over the course of his career. Of course,\nLewis changed the details of many of his views, in response to\ncriticism and further thought. But the idea that some properties could\nbe natural, could make for objective similarity, in ways that most\nsets of possibilia do not, is notably absent from his writings before\n\u201cNew Work\u201d. Indeed, as late as \u201cIndividuation by\nAcquaintance and by Stipulation\u201d (1983c), he was rather\ndismissive of the idea. But natural properties came to play central\nroles in his metaphysics and, as we see here, his theory of mind. As\nLewis notes in \u201cNew Work\u201d, much of the impetus for his\nchange of view came from discussions with D. M. Armstrong, and from\nthe arguments in favour of universals that Armstrong presented in his\n(1978).\n",
