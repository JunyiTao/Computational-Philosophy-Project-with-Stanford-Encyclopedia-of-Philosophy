    "main_text": "Feminist Philosophy of Science || Objectivity\n4.2 Objectivity\n\nThe commitment to the objectivity of science and the association of\nobjectivity with the value-free ideal are among the reasons many\nphilosophers of science found it difficult to accept that feminist\nvalues can make a constructive contribution to science. But as Lloyd\n(1995) notes, the meaning of \u201cobjectivity\u201d is complex,\nunstable and hence far from clear. In one philosophical picture,\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d characterizes a relationship between knowers\nand reality-as-independently-existing; methodologically, the knower\nmust be detached, because investment in a particular belief or\nattachment to a point of view (\u201cbias\u201d) \u201ccould impede\nthe free acquisition of knowledge and correct representation of\n(independent) reality\u2026\u201d. On Lloyd\u2019s analysis the\nproblem lies with the claim that this \u201cobjective\u201d\nreality\u2014what she refers to as the \u201cReally\nReal\u201d\u2014is \u201cconverged upon through the application of\nobjective methods\u201d. The Really Real can be known since it is\npublicly accessible to those who use these objective methods and who\nare properly detached or disinterested. As Lloyd points out, this view\nassumes (a) that the Really Real is completely independent of us;\nthus, (b) objective knowledge of this Reality requires an\n\u201cobjective method\u201d characterized by detachment, because\n(c) attachment or point of view might interfere with our independence\nfrom the reality we wish to know, and (d) this reality is publicly\naccessible, if it is accessible at all (Lloyd 1995: 354\u2013356).\nThese assumptions are each problematic and this section and\n section 4.3\n address them.\n\nThe first assumption, that the Really Real is completely independent\nof us, fails to acknowledge that in addition to \u201cresistances by\nreality\u201d, sociocultural factors are \u201cnecessarily involved\nin the development of knowledge and concept-formation\u201d.\nAnthropologists are virtually unanimous in holding that \u201csex and\ngender roles lay the foundations of every human society\u2019s other\nsocial practices\u201d, therefore, any epistemology or philosophy of\nscience that includes social interests and values as integral to the\nacquisition of knowledge should include sex and gender related values\nand interests (Lloyd 1995: 373 and 367\u2013368).\n\nLloyd elaborates that when researchers investigate a phenomenon their\ngoal is not only to represent reality, but to give a\nsignificant, that is, relevant, representation.\nScientific accounts (theories and hypotheses) must focus on the parts\nof reality that are relevant to the interests (and values) that give\nrise to the research questions that motivate the research (2005:\n244\u2013245). While reality may be independent of us, our accounts\nof reality are accounts of the aspects of reality that matter to us\nand are shaped by the interests that give rise to our research\nprograms. Additionally, the questions addressed through research\narise, in part, from what is thought to be known at the time that the\nresearch commences, this means that part of the evidence for the\naccount rests in that background knowledge. The ineliminability of\nvalues in both the background knowledge and the current projects\nchallenges the traditional ideal of objectivity.\n\nIn addressing the question of objectivity, both Lloyd and Anderson\nmake use of Hugh Lacey\u2019s distinction between two aspects of the\nvalue-free ideal: neutrality and impartiality (Lacey 1999, 2\u20136).\nNeutrality is the requirement that scientific theories neither\npresuppose nor support any non-epistemic (moral, political, social, or\ncultural) values. Impartiality requires that theories be evaluated on\nthe basis of evidence and the extent to which they exhibit other\nepistemic values (Anderson uses Kuhn\u2019s 1977 list: empirical\nadequacy, consistency, scope, and compatibility with other established\ntheories) (Anderson 2004: 3). Impartiality is not interest or\nvalue-free, but rather \n\n\na commitment to pass judgment in relation to a set of evaluative\nstandards that transcends the competing interests of those who\nadvocate rival answers to a question. (Anderson 1995b: 42) \n\n\nThus Lloyd and Anderson take impartiality to be the key feature of\nobjectivity, as does Lacey (Lacey 1999: 78). However, as noted in\n section 4.1,\n Anderson takes at least some value judgments to answer to empirical\nevidence and so they may legitimately serve as part of the evidence\nfor background theories against which evidence for hypotheses under\nconsideration is evaluated. This realization forces a reassessment of\nthe ideal of impartiality\u2014background theories may affect our\nassessment of the evidence and so we must be prepared to determine\nwhen such influence is pernicious and when beneficial. As we have\nseen, Anderson makes the distinction by examining the extent to which\nvalues are responsive to evidence\u2014that is, the extent to which\nthey are held non-dogmatically. In order to meet the ideal of\nimpartiality researchers must consider all of the evidence. Since some\nof the evidence is either value-laden or supports the values that\ndirect the research questions, impartial science need not be\nneutral.\n\nMuch feminist work on values has been influenced by Helen\nLongino\u2019s contextual empiricism (see the entries on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n feminist social epistemology, and\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n Using Kuhnian arguments for underdetermination of theory by evidence,\nLongino argues that since empirical evidence can never fully determine\nthat we should accept any particular theory, contextual values\n(social, moral, political, and cultural) may play a role in that\ndetermination by \u201cfilling the gap\u201d\u2014and thus Solomon\nrefers to this version of feminist empiricism as \u201cgap feminist\nempiricism\u201d (Solomon 2012: 436). As a result, Longino emphasizes\nthat evidence is relative to the contextual values against which the\nevaluation of the theory occurs. As a result, scientific theory is not\nneutral in Lacey\u2019s sense; it presupposes certain social and\npolitical values that are among the background assumptions against\nwhich the theory is evaluated\u2014its context. Hence scientific\ntheory is not objective in the traditional sense that requires\nneutrality. For Longino, it is not impartial either since social and\npolitical values can play, and often do play, a role in theory\nacceptance.\n\nLongino proposes an alternate understanding of objectivity. The social\ncharacter of science provides the opportunity for\n\u201ctransformative criticism\u201d. Such criticism requires the\nadherence to social norms: publicly recognized forums for the\ncriticism of evidence, methods, and assumptions and reasoning; uptake\nof criticism, which requires that the community not merely tolerate\ndissent, but alter its beliefs and theories over time in response to\nthe critical discourse; publicly recognized standards by reference to\nwhich theories, hypotheses, and observational practices are evaluated\nand by appeal to which criticism is made relevant to the goals of the\ninquiring community; and finally, communities must be characterized by\ntempered equality of intellectual authority (Longino 1993, 2002). When\nscience is conducted according to these norms, Longino argues that it\nbalances partialities and hence is objective to the degree that it\nfulfills these norms. But it is neither neutral nor impartial since\nscientific theory is informed by values that shape the context in\nwhich the relevance of evidence is determined. \n",
