    "main_text": "Theories of Forgiveness || Pluralist Accounts\n5.6 Pluralist Accounts\n\nSome philosophers have argued that forgiveness is just too diverse and\ndiffuse of a practice to be captured by a simple, singular theory.\nNick Smith observes that our \u201cnotions of forgiveness seem to\nidentify a loose constellation of interrelated meanings among various\nbeliefs, judgments, emotions and actions\u201d (2008: 134).\nResponding to the view that forgiveness is the same wherever it\noccurs, William Neblett writes that \n\n\nif there is anything about forgiveness that is always the same, no\nmatter the context, it is very little, and it is none of the various\nthings that philosophers are prone to say that it is, that it must be\n(like the wiping away of all resentment and ill-will). (1974: 273, cf.\n269)\n\n\nMarilyn McCord Adams has suggested that forgiveness has two\n\u201cmodalities\u201d, which she labels \u201cperformative\nforgiveness\u201d and \u201cforgiveness from the heart\u201d (1991:\n294). Forgiveness from the heart, she writes, \u201cinvolves a\nprocess of letting go of one\u2019s own point of view\n(regarding the situation, one\u2019s self and/or the victim, and the\noffender)\u201d, which will typically \u201cinvolve many changes in\nfeelings, attitudes, judgments and desires\u201d (1991: 294\u20135,\nitalics original). Performative forgiveness, on the other hand,\n\u201cfocuses on externals (material compensations or behavior) and\nthe formal structures of relationships, not on inner attitudes or\nfeelings\u201d (1991: 294). Examples include \u201cthe public\nacceptance of apologies for small injuries\u201d and cases in which a\n\u201ccivil suit could be pressed but is legally or officially\nwaived\u201d, either of which, she claims, may be accomplished absent\nany \u201ccommitment to change one\u2019s attitudes or\nfeelings\u201d (1991: 294). The key thought to which Adams draws our\nattention is that the phenomena counting as forgiveness can be\nunderstood as possessing an interior dimension or an\nexterior dimension (and sometimes both) (cf. Zaibert 2009;\nWarmke & McKenna 2013). Adams\u2019s forgiveness from the heart\noccurs in this interior dimension insofar as it involves those things\nthat can be roughly described as psychological: judgments, beliefs,\nemotions, feelings, decisions and intentions are interior aspects of\nforgiveness. The exterior \u201cperformative\u201d dimension\ninvolves those things that can be roughly described as bodily. The\nrelevant kinds of bodily conduct might include things like utterances\nof \u201cI forgive you\u201d, gestures, friendly behaviors, or a\nwritten letter or email.\n",
