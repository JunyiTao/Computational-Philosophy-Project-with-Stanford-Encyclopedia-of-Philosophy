    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition || Sensation and Perception\n3.2 Sensation and Perception\n\n\nThe Sanskrit term most commonly associated with sensory activity, \nindriya (\u2018sensation\u2019 or \u2018power\u2019), is\nfound in the Rg Veda (I, 55; II, 16), a collection of hymns \ndealing with various religio-philosophical topics central to the \nBrahmanical tradition. Here the senses are likened to lesser deities \nacting on behalf of Indra, the king of the gods, as messengers to the\nlower realms. As manifestations of Indra's specific powers, the \nsenses thus understood correspond to his capacity for knowledge \n(buddh\u012bndriya) and action (karmendriya). This \nearly mythological narrative in which lesser deities are the agencies\nof sensory activity in humans bears some structural similarity to \nDescartes\u2019 account in his Treatise of Man and \nPassions of the Soul of the animal spirits which flowing \nfrom the pineal gland control the activity of sensation, imagination,\nas well as bodily movements. In the Upani\u1e63ads, this \nmythological account gives way to a philosophically nuanced view of \nsensory activity as the direct result of contact between the self and\nthe world. According to the Upani\u1e63adic understanding of \nperception, the senses are created from the substance of \nsense-objects and with the specific purpose of revealing the latter. \nThe revealing agent, however, is the self (see Ka\u1e6dha \nUpani\u1e63ad, I, iii, 4).\n\n\nBuddhist authors, unlike their Brahmanical opponents, make a clear \ndistinction between the activity or faculty of sensing \n(indriyagocara) and the medium which implements it, as for \ninstance in distinguishing between the faculty of vision \n(cak\u1e63urvij\u00f1\u0101nadh\u0101tu) and the visual \nsystem (cak\u1e63urdh\u0101tu). Moreover, the senses are \nconceived as receptacles of experience \n(indriy\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na) rather than \nphysical organs interacting with empirical objects. Instead of \ntreating the senses as the faculties of an internal agent, the \nBuddhists regard them as instruments or mediums joining together the \nexternal spheres of sensory activity with the internal spheres of \nperception (see Abhidharmasamuccayabh\u0101\u1e63ya\nad I, 4.). In the Treasury of Higher Knowledge \n(AKBh ad I, 17), Vasubandhu provides the following list to \naccount for the causal relations that obtain between the sensory \nsystems and their bases or domains of activity \n(\u0101yatana): \n\n\n\nThe manifest \nThe locus of origin \nThe cognive support \n\n\n1. visual awareness \n1. visual system \n7. visibles (e.g. color and shape) \n\n\n2. auditory awareness \n2. auditory system\n8. sound\n\n\n3. olfactory consciousness \n3. olfactive system \n9. smell\n\n\n4. gustatory consciousness \n4. gustatory system\n10. taste\n\n\n5. tactile consciousness \n5. tactile system \n11. touch\n\n\n6. mental awareness \n6. cognitive system \n12. mental constituents = dharmas \n\n\n\n\nThus the Buddhist accounts for sensory activity and cognitive \nawareness by reducing experience to its contents and analyzing it in \nterms of its constitutive elements and functions. In the often quoted\nformula of dependent arising (see below \n \u00a73.3),\n any of the six types of cognitive awareness in the first column \narises in dependence upon a corresponding element in columns 2 and 3.\nThus, instead of construing cognitive awareness as the activity of an\nabiding self, the Buddhist uses the notion of \u2018aggregate\u2019\nin the original sense of the Sanskrit term skandha: \nsomething which is fashioned by the collective combination of \nmultiple causes and conditions (see AKBh ad I, 7). These \nconstitutive parts, which collectively make the psycho-physical \ncontinuum that we ordinarily associate with persons, exist as part of\na causal continuum of interdependently arising phenomena. \n",
