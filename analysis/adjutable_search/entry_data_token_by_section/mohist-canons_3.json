{
    "main_text": "Ethics || Heaven\n3.1 Heaven\n\nUnlike early Mohist texts, the Dialectics nowhere appeals to\nHeaven as a justification or epistemic criterion for moral judgment.\nHowever, it is unclear whether or not the later Mohists actually\nabandoned the doctrine of\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (ti\u0101n zh\u00ec \u5929\u5fd7). One possibility is\nthat they set aside the doctrine after noticing the epistemic problems\ninvolved in contending that Heaven supports one set of ethical norms\nrather than another. One isolated passage seems to recognize that the\nmoral appeal to Heaven\u2019s intention as a standard of morality is\neffectively empty, as it could be twisted by a criminal to claim that\nsince Heaven (ti\u0101n \u5929, also \u201cnature\u201d)\nhas given him a criminal disposition, it is right for him to engage in\nselfish behavior (EC1). However, the passage in question is so obscure\nand corrupt that it cannot be interpreted with confidence. Another\npossibility is that the writers merely omitted the doctrine of\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d without actually rejecting it,\nsince their texts treat only the content of the ethical theory, not\nits foundations. Another, similarly late book of the Mozi,\n\u201cModels and Standards\u201d (Book 4), continues to appeal to\nHeaven as an ethical model, though that text may be the work of a\ndifferent branch of Mohists. \n",
