Since\nAllison\u2019s work was the most influential among English language\nscholars, and most likely to be known to readers, this discussion will\nfocus on the interpretation of transcendental idealism in Allison\n(1983) and the revised and enlarged second edition (2004).\nAllison\u2019s writings contain several distinct (and not obviously\nequivalent) formulations of transcendental idealism. This section\nconcentrates on reconstructing what is arguably the \u201ccore\u201d\nof Allison\u2019s reading: his interpretation of appearances and\nthings in themselves, and his reconstruction of the argument for the\nnon-spatiality of things in themselves.\n\nThe core insight of Kant\u2019s epistemology in general, and his\ntranscendental idealism in particular, according to Allison, is the\nprinciple that we possess a discursive intellect. A\ndiscursive intellect is one that passively receives representations of\nparticular objects (intuitions) and then spontaneously subsumes those\nintuited objects under general concepts; consequently, a discursive\nintellect must possess a sensory faculty (through which it receives\nsensory data and intuits individual objects) and a conceptual faculty\n(through which it forms general concepts and applies them to objects)\n(A50\u20131/B74\u20135). By contrast, an intuitive intellect brings\ninto existence its objects merely by representing them, and thus has\nno need to receive representations of objects from\n outside.[40]\n But that is not all there is to the discursive nature of our\nintellect, Allison\n argues.[41]\n Kant\u2019s key insight is that our sensible faculty has its own\nepistemic conditions.\n\nAn \u201cepistemic condition\u201d is Allison\u2019s term for a\nrepresentation we must apply to objects in order to cognize them\n(Allison 2004: 11, 14). Space and time are epistemic conditions, as\nare the categories. If E is an epistemic condition then\nnecessarily if we know an object O, in knowing it we\nrepresent it using\n E.[42]\n Some of our epistemic conditions follow from the general fact that we\nare discursive cognizers (the categories) and some follow from the\nmore specific fact that we cognize objects given to us in space and\ntime. Representing objects using the categories is an epistemic\ncondition for any discursive intellect, i.e., for any intellect that\nmust conceptualize objects given passively in sensory\n intuition.[43]\n So space and time are epistemic conditions of spatiotemporal\ndiscursive cognition of objects, while the categories are epistemic\nconditions of discursive cognition of objects in general. Any\ndiscursive intellect must conceptualize sensibly intuited objects\nusing the categories, whether or not those objects are intuited in\nspace and time, or some other intuitional forms (Allison 2004:\n17).\n\nThis grounds a distinction between two ways of considering the objects\nof our cognition. When we consider objects qua objects of our\ncognition, we consider them as falling under the relevant epistemic\nconditions. If E is an epistemic condition of cognition of\nobjects, then objects must fall under E (i.e., be accurately\nrepresented by E); otherwise, in representing them with\nE, I would not be cognizing objects but misrepresenting them.\nMy representation of objects with E would be an illusion, the\nvery conclusion Kant wants to avoid with respect to space and objects\nrepresented in space. This means that if E is an epistemic\ncondition of the specific kind of discursive cognition of objects that\nwe have, then E correctly represents those objects. So, if\nspace and time are the forms of our intuition, it follows that\nempirical objects qua objects of the kind of discursive\nintellect we have, are in space and time. But if we do not consider\nobjects qua objects of our specific kind of discursive\nintellect, but qua objects of discursive intellect in\ngeneral, we can no longer assume that our specific intuitional\nepistemic condition applies to them. The more general epistemic\nconditions of all discursive cognition (in Kant\u2019s view, the\ncategories) still apply to objects under this more abstract\nperspective, however. So we can say that objects qua\nappearing (objects of spatiotemporal discursive cognition) are in\nspace, but qua things in themselves (objects of discursive\ncognition in general) they are not in space. This, in a nutshell, is\nAllison\u2019s reconstruction of the argument for the non-spatiality\nof things in\n themselves.[44]\n While it is legitimate to consider objects as things in themselves\nusing the categories, we do not thereby cognize them. This\nfollows trivially from the fact that space and time are epistemic\nconditions for us: without representing objects in space and time, we\ncan think of objects using the categories, but those thoughts are not\ncognitions (Allison 2004: 18).\n4.3. Problems with the Epistemic reading\n\nAllison\u2019s interpretation has been challenged on a number of\npoints by other scholars. This section discusses a number of such\nobjections.\n4.3.1 The Triviality Objection\n\nSome scholars object that Allison\u2019s reading of the\nnon-spatiality thesis, and the thesis that things in themselves are\nuncognizable by us, renders it a tautology, a trivial logical\nconsequence of\n definitions.[45]\n We may represent the definition of \u201cthing in itself\u201d talk\n(on Allison\u2019s interpretation) as follows:\n\n(1)\nThings in themselves are F if and only if objects of\ndiscursive cognition as such are F.\n\n\nAnd the non-spatiality thesis as:\n\n(C)\n \u2234 ~(Things in themselves are spatial)\n\n\nBut now the reader can see that to derive (C) from (1) we would need a\nfurther premise:\n\n(2)\n ~(Objects, considered, as objects of discursive cognition in\ngeneral, are spatial)\n\n\nBut this claim is not a definition, for it is equivalent to the claim\nthat the concept of a discursive cognition is more general than the\nconcept of a spatiotemporal discursive cognition, i.e., that a\nnon-spatial discursive intellect is conceivable. So although the\nnon-spatiality of things in themselves follows almost immediately from\nvery general truths, on Allison\u2019s reconstruction, it is\nnot correct to say that it is a tautology, or that it is true by\ndefinition.\n\nNor is it true that the uncognizability of things in themselves is\ntrivial, on Allison\u2019s reading. For that principle only follows\nfrom the claim that there are sensible epistemic conditions, space and\ntime. And that, on Allison\u2019s reconstruction, is the key insight\nthat sets Kant apart from both his rationalist and empiricist\npredecessors. Thus, while Allison\u2019s interpretation makes the\nargument for the non-spatiality of things in themselves relatively\neasy, it does not render the conclusion trivial.\n4.3.2 Epistemic conditions entail realism\n\nRobinson (1994) raises a quite general objection to Allison\u2019s\nnotion of an epistemic condition, namely, an object must satisfy (fall\nunder) a representation if that representation is to constitute an\nepistemic condition for that object (Robinson 1994 is a response,\nmainly, to Allison 1983 and 1987). So in the claim that \u201cobjects\nqua appearances\u201d or \u201cobjects considered\nwith our epistemic conditions\u201d the qualification\n\u201cqua appearances\u201d or \u201cconsidered with our\nepistemic conditions\u201d is otiose. If space is an epistemic\ncondition of outer objects for us then this entails that objects we\ncognize are in space simpliciter. The claim that objects are\nspatial because of or in virtue of space being an\nepistemic condition for them entails either that these\nobjects exist in virtue of our representations of them (which results\nin phenomenalism) or it entails that they are spatial in\nvirtue of our representing them but would not be spatial otherwise. In\nthe latter case, we are not cognizing them in representing\nthem as spatial; we are misrepresenting them (Robinson 1994:\n420\u201322).\n\nAllison might reply to this objection by pointing out that it\nimplicitly assumes that the claim empirical objects are in\nspace is coherent independently of specifying a perspective on\nthose objects. In the terminology of Allison (2004) it is committed to\n\u201ctranscendental realism\u201d (see the supplementary entry:\n Allison on Transcendental Realism and Transcendental Idealism).\n If this were Allison\u2019s reply to the objection, then it would\nshow that the coherence of transcendental idealism, on Allison\u2019s\nreconstruction, rests on the premise that there is no coherent sense\nto questions about how objects are independent of any perspective on\nthem. This is important, because it is not always clear that\nAllison\u2019s reconstruction does depend on this premise, and it is\nnot clear where Kant argues for such a conclusion.\n4.3.3 Abstraction\n\nOne influential objection focuses on the role that\n\u201cabstracting\u201d from our spatiotemporal intuition plays in\nAllison\u2019s reconstruction. Van Cleve puts it somewhat\nfacetiously:\n\n\nHow is it possible for the properties of a thing to be vary according\nto how it is considered? As I sit typing these words, I have shoes on\nmy feet. But consider me apart from my shoes: so considered, am I\nbarefoot? I am inclined to say no; consider me how you will, I am not\nnow barefoot. (Van Cleve 1999:\n 8)[46]\n\n\nTo put the point less facetiously: if the object o,\nconsidered as an object of spatiotemporal cognition, is spatial, then\nwhen we ascend to a more general perspective, in which we consider\no as the object of discursive cognition in general, then we\nshould not say that o is non-spatial; we should\nmerely not judge that it is spatial. To take an example of\nGuyer\u2019s, when we consider a job applicant we might want to\nignore or abstract from their race or sex; in doing so we would not\njudge that they are race-less or sex-less, but merely refrain from\nrepresenting them as having a determinate race or sex.\n\nAllison can interpret Kant\u2019s claim that things in themselves are\nnot spatial in either of two ways:\n\n(1)\nThings in themselves are non-spatial.\n(2)\nIt is not the case that things in themselves are spatial.\n\n\nWhile ordinarily we might take these claims to be equivalent, when\ntalking about \u201cthings in themselves\u201d we can distinguish\nthem, because \u201cthings in themselves\u201d talk is talk about\nobjects from a certain perspective (i.e., considered as objects of\ndiscursive intellect in general). In particular, (1) and (2) are\nequivalent to:\n\n(1*)\nObjects, considered as objects of discursive cognition in general,\nare non-spatial.\n(2*)\n~(Objects, considered as objects of discursive cognition in\ngeneral, are spatial)\n\n\nAllison\u2019s critics assume that he opts for (1) (and its analysis,\n(1*)) and object, rightly, that this is the wrong conclusion to draw\nfrom the fact that discursive cognition is a more general notion than\nspatiotemporal discursive cognition. (Just as it would be wrong to\nconclude that the job candidate, considered in abstraction from his\nsex and race, is sex-less and race-less.) While it is sometimes\nunclear from Allison\u2019s texts which analysis he opts for, the\ncharitable reading is that he accepts (2*).\n\nIf this is correct, Allison\u2019s reasoning can be reconstructed as\nfollows:\n\n(3)\nThings in themselves are F = objects, considered as objects\nof discursive intellect in general, are F.\n (4)\nIt is conceivable that there is an object of discursive intellect\nthat is not an object of spatiotemporal discursive intellect, i.e.,\nspatiotemporal discursive intellect is a special case of discursive\nintellect.\n (5)\n \u2234 ~(objects, considered as objects of discursive intellect\nin general, are spatial)\n (6)\n \u2234 ~(Things in themselves are spatial)\n\n\nBut (6) must be distinguished from:\n\n(7)\n Things in themselves are non-spatial.\n\n\nOn this reconstruction of Allison, Kant is committed to (6) but not to\n(7).\n\nWe saw earlier that Allison\u2019s critics assume that he must intend\n(7) rather than (6). They do so because they think that it is clear\nfrom the texts that Kant claims (7) and not the weaker (6). But that\nis not so clear from the texts, for instance:\n\n\nSpace represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor\nany relation of them each other, i.e., no determination of them that\nattaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one were\nto abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. (A26/B42)\n\n\nPrima facie it is compatible with the letter of these texts\nthat Kant is claiming (6) rather than (7). Note that (6) is not the\nclaim that we cannot know, or justifiably assert that things in\nthemselves are spatial. It is the claim that it is false to\nsay that they are spatial.\n\nThe stronger objection to Allison\u2019s view, as reconstructed here,\nis that (6) is too weak to be a plausible reconstruction of\nKant\u2019s non-spatiality thesis. Given Allison\u2019s\nunderstanding of \u201cthing in itself\u201d talk (premise (3)) all\nthat (6) requires is that there is some conceivable perspective on\nobjects that is more general than the specifically spatiotemporal form\nof cognition that we have (premise (4)). It does not even require that\nit is possible that there be discursive intellects with a\nnon-spatiotemporal form of cognition. All it requires is that the\nconcept of discursive cognition as such is more general than the\nconcept of spatiotemporal discursive cognition, which, trivially, it\nis. (6) is compatible with it being impossible for there to be\nnon-spatiotemporal discursive cognition because all objects are\nnecessarily spatiotemporal and hence can only be cognized\nspatiotemporally. In other words (6) is compatible with transcendental\nrealism about space and time (as Kant defines that term)!\n\nOne potential Allisonian response to this objection would be that it\nimplicitly presupposes that there is a way objects are independently\nof any perspective on them. In particular, the claim that (6) is\ncompatible with all possible objects being spatial, and thus cannot be\na reconstruction of the non-spatiality thesis, begs the question by\nassuming that that state-of-affairs does not need to relativized to a\nperspective, e.g., all possible objects as objects for a certain\nkind of mind are spatial. Thus, the coherence of Allison\u2019s\nreconstruction again depends upon the claim that there is no\n\u201cstandpoint-independent\u201d perspective on reality.\n4.3.4 Things in themselves as more fundamental than appearances\n\nOne major textual hurdle for Allison\u2019s \u201cepistemic\u201d\nreading of transcendental idealism is the various passages in which\nKant describes things in themselves as more fundamental, more\nontologically basic, than appearances, or describes things in\nthemselves as the grounds of appearances. Allison appears to\nreverse this relation of dependence because things in themselves\n(objects from the relatively abstract transcendental perspective) are\nan abstraction from appearances (objects from the more determinate\nempirical perspective). Ameriks (1992: 334) raises this objection, and\nAllison (2004: 45) replies to it. Allison does not offer an alternate\nreading of the relevant texts, but instead points out that, in the\ncase where the relative fundamentality of the phenomenal and noumenal\nis most important to Kant, namely the freedom of the\n will,[47]\n Ameriks\u2019 objection assumes, once again, that there is some fact\nof the matter as to whether we are free or not, and this is to be\nsettled by determining whether we are free at the most fundamental\nlevel (the noumenal level, on Ameriks\u2019 reading). Once again, the\ncoherence of Allison\u2019s reading rests on the premise that there\nis no standpoint-independent perspective on reality (see the\nsupplementary entry:\n Allison on Transcendental Realism and Transcendental Idealism).\n4.4 Metaphysical \u201cDual Aspect\u201d Readings\n\nOne prominent strand in recent scholarship on Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism has been the development of quite\nsophisticated interpretations that try to retain the original insight\nthat the appearance/thing in itself distinction is not a distinction\nbetween two different kinds of objects, while abandoning Allison-style\n\u201cepistemic\u201d readings. These interpretations take the\ndistinction to be a metaphysical one between two different sets of\nproperties had by one and the same set of objects. These metaphysical\n\u201cdual aspect\u201d interpretations differ in exactly how they\nunderstand the distinction between these different sets of properties\n(see also Allais (2004, 2006, 2007, 2015); Rosefeldt (2007, 2013);\nMcDaniel (ms); and Marshall (2013)).\n\nPerhaps the most influential metaphysical but non-phenomenalist\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s idealism has been Langton (1998).\nLangton begins by pointing out that Kant thinks we are genuinely\nmissing out on something in not knowing things in themselves, and this\nsense of \u201cepistemic loss\u201d is incompatible with\nAllison\u2019s reading. As we saw in the previous section,\n\u201cAllisonian humility\u201d is apparently compatible with it\nbeing impossible that there are non-spatiotemporal objects and our\nforms of intuition being the only possible such forms. This\nloses Kant\u2019s sense that we are genuinely cognitively deprived,\nthat there is something about the world of which we are irremediably\nignorant (Allison responds to Langton\u2019s criticism in 2004:\n9\u201311).\n\nHaving rejected Allison\u2019s epistemic reading, Langton goes on to\ndiscuss a familiar tension between two of the central doctrines of\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism:\n\n(Existence) Things in themselves exist.\n\n(Humility) We cannot know anything about things in\nthemselves.\n\nLangton\u2019s solution to this, one of the oldest problems of Kant\nscholarship, is to interpret things in themselves as substances with\nintrinsic properties, and talk of \u201cphenomena\u201d as talk of\nthe extrinsic properties of those substances (things in themselves).\nSo in general,\n\n(1)\n Things in themselves are F = F is among the\nintrinsic properties of substances\n(2) \n Appearances are F = F is among the extrinsic\nproperties of substances\n\n\nIn particular, this allows Langton to interpret (Existence)\nand (Humility) as:\n\n(Existence*) Substances with intrinsic properties exist.\n\n(Humility*) We cannot cognize the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances.\n\nThe apparent tension between these doctrines has vanished.\nLangton\u2019s interpretation also allows her to explain why the\napparent tension between Humility and\n\n(Non-spatiality) Things in themselves are not spatial.\n\nis merely apparent because, on her reading (Non-spatiality) is\nequivalent to:\n\n(Non-spatiality*) Being spatial is not an intrinsic property\nof substances.\n\nThis is compatible with (Humility*) because we can know it merely by\nknowing that being spatial is an extrinsic property in general (thus\nis not an intrinsic property had by substances), and to know this we\ndo not need to know anything about the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances. Langton thus offers a consistent, elegant interpretation\nof transcendental idealism that solves several of the oldest and\nhardest problems in the interpretation of Kant\u2019s\n philosophy.[48]\n4.5 Problems for Langton\u2019s reading\n\nMuch of the critical reaction to Langton (1998) has focused on her\nreconstruction of Kant\u2019s argument for Humility, but that will\nnot be discussed further here; even if Langton is wrong about how Kant\nproves Humility, she may still be right about what Humility\nmeans and thus what the appearance/thing in itself\ndistinction means (e.g., Allais 2006).\n4.5.1 Textual evidence\n\nThere is substantial textual evidence that Kantian appearances have\nonly extrinsic properties. For instance, this passage from the\n\u201cAesthetic\u201d:\n\n\neverything in our cognition that belongs to intuition (with the\nexception, therefore, of the feeling of pleasure and displeasure and\nthe will, which are not cognitions at all) contains nothing but mere\nrelations, of places in one intuition (extension), alteration of\nplaces (motion), and laws in accordance with which this alteration is\ndetermined (moving forces). (B67)\n\n\nThis, and other passages Langton cites, support attributing to Kant\nthese theses:\n\n(1)\nAppearances (phenomena) have only relational properties. (B67,\nA265/B321, A285/B341)\n (2)\n When we conceive of an object purely intellectually we conceive\nof it as having intrinsic properties. (A274/B330, A277/B333)\n (3)\n In knowing relational properties we do not know things as they\nare in themselves. (B67)\n\n\nHowever, in none of these passages does Kant directly state the\nstronger claim that:\n\n(4)\n Phenomena are extrinsic properties of substances with intrinsic\nproperties.\n\n\nIt is clear that Kant holds (1)\u2013(3) and less clear that he holds\n(4). The textual case for (4) is weaker, though not absent. It is\npresented below, in\n sub-section 4.5.2.\n\nThere is a further textual problem for Langton\u2019s interpretation,\nthough. In at least two passages Kant denies that we can know\nrelations between things in themselves:\n\n\nSpace represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor\nany relation of them each other [\u2026] (A26/B42)\n\n[\u2026] the things that we intuit are not in themselves what we\nintuit them to be, nor are their relations so constituted in\nthemselves as they appear to us. (A42/B59)\n\n\nIn these passages Kant claims that space is not a relation among\nthings in themselves, nor are relations among objects \u201cin\nthemselves\u201d as they appear to us. This is hard to square with\nLangton\u2019s reading. However, in her (2011) Langton responds to\nthese textual objections by suggesting that the relations among things\nin themselves of which Kant speaks are internal relations,\nrelations that supervene on the intrinsic properties of\n substances.[49]\n4.5.2 Phenomena substantiata\n\nOne source of resistance to Langton\u2019s interpretation is that\nKant argues at length in the \u201cFirst Analogy of Experience\u201d\nthat the category substance can be applied to phenomena: \n\n\nall appearances contain that which persists (substance) as the object\nitself, and that which can change as its mere determination, i.e., a\nway in which the object exists. (A182) \n\n\nThis would appear to contradict Langton\u2019s assertion that things\nin themselves are substances, while appearances (phenomena) are merely\nproperties of substances.\n\nLangton is well aware that Kant accepts \u201cphenomenal\nsubstances\u201d and endeavors to explain this within her picture. In\ndoing so, she compiles a compelling set of textual evidence for her\nalternative reading of the \u201cFirst Analogy\u201d and the meaning\nof substance for phenomena. She begins by pointing to\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\u2019s notion of a phaenomena\nsubstantiata, a \u201csubstantiated phenomenon\u201d, by which\nBaumgarten means a property that we treat as a substance by\npredicating other properties of it (Baumgarten, Metaphysica\n\u00a7193 (Ak. 18:150); quoted at Langton 1998: 53). She argues\nconvincingly that Kant\u2019s fundamental notion of a substance is of\na being with properties but which is not a property of anything\n else.[50]\n Only such beings, of which other things are predicated (inhere in)\nbut which are not predicated of (inhere in) anything else, are truly\nsubstances. However, the properties that are predicated of substances\ncan also be spoken of as substances, because they themselves have\nproperties (which might also have properties, and so\n on).[51]\n These are substantiated phenomena.\n\nThe question is, are Kantian empirical substances genuine substances\nor mere substantiated phenomena? Do the objects subsumed under the\nempirical schema of substance (absolute persistence in time) also fall\nunder the pure category of substance (subjects of inherence which\ninhere in nothing further)? If not, then they must be predicated of\nsome more fundamental substance, which drives Langton to conclude that\nappearances (phenomena) are properties of substances (she does point\nout the hesitant terms in which Kant describes phenomena as substances\n(1998, 57). Langton assembles an impressive array of evidence that\nKant does regard empirical \u201csubstances\u201d as phaenomena\nsubstantiata (e.g., A265/B321, A277/B333, Refl. 4421, 4422, 5294,\nAk. 28:209). However, in context it is not clear whether Kant has the\nBaumgarten notion in mind, or whether this Latin expression means\nsimply: phenomenal substance. So it is unclear, textually, whether\nphenomena are predicated of noumena in the\n Critique.[52]\n\nIn his metaphysics lectures, and other texts, Kant consistently\ndistinguishes the inherence relation (which holds between a property\nand an entity of which it is predicated) from the relation of\nground to consequence:\n\n\nThe world \u201csubstance\u201d is clearly ambiguous. One translates\nit through the notion of self-sufficiency, i.e., the possibility of\nexisting without a ground, but also as the possibility of existing\nwithout inhering [in something else]. (Ak. 28:1308; Ak. 8:225n,\n28:562, 28:779, 28:638\u20139, 28:1041, 28:1104f)\n\n\nKant, following Baumgarten, criticizes Spinoza\u2019s definition of\nsubstance as \u201cwhat is in itself and conceived through\nitself\u201d (Ethics Id3) because it conflates two notions:\n(i) a being that is not grounded in, or caused by, anything more\nfundamental, and (ii) a being that does not inhere in anything more\nfundamental. The second is the correct definition of substance,\naccording to Kant; by conflating these two notions, Spinoza forecloses\nthe following possibility: there are substances distinct from God\n(they are not modes of God), all of which are grounded in God.\n\nTo bring this back to Langton, we need to distinguish two different\nclaims:\n\n(i) \n Phenomena are extrinsic properties of substances (things in\nthemselves). They inhere in things in themselves.\n(ii) \n Phenomena exist (at least partly) in virtue of the extrinsic\nproperties of substances (things in themselves). They are grounded in\nthings in themselves.\n\n\nLangton attributes (i) to Kant, but her textual case appears to\nsupport (ii), at\n best.[53]\n This is significant, because (ii) is far less controversial. For\ninstance, it is in principle acceptable to the qualified\nphenomenalist, because the extrinsic properties of things in\nthemselves include (presumably) properties like causing us to have\nsuch and such experience.\n5. One Object or Two?\n\nSince Karl Ameriks\u2019 classic survey of the literature, Ameriks\n(1982), it has been customary to divide interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism into \u201ctwo object\u201d readings and\n\u201cone object\u201d readings. By contrast, this article has been\norganized around the distinction between phenomenalist readings, and\nnon-phenomenalist dual-aspect readings. This section explores the\nrelation between the \u201cone object\u201d/\u201ctwo object\u201d\ndistinction and the phenomenalist/non-phenomenalist distinction among\ndifferent interpretations of Kant\u2019s idealism.\n\nThe distinction between \u201cone object\u201d and \u201ctwo\nobject\u201d readings comes down to the question of whether\nappearances, in general, are numerically identical to things in\nthemselves: \u201cone object\u201d readers claim they are (Adickes\n1924: 20, 27; Allais 2004: 657; Langton 1998: 13; Westphal 1968: 120),\nand \"two object\" readers deny\n this.[54]\n Whether all things in themselves are numerically identical to\nappearances is not at issue, for most one object readers will admit\nthere could be things that never appear to us (cf. B306, where Kant\nseems to admit as much) (although it might be misleading to call them\nthings \u201cin themselves\u201d since they never appear to us, so\nwe never consider them as they are \u201cin themselves\u201d). The\nqualification \u201cin general\u201d is necessary because some\n\u201ctwo object\u201d readers will admit that some appearances are\nalso things in themselves; e.g., many \u201ctwo object\u201d readers\nwill admit that, in the case of the self, there is a single object, a\nthing in itself, that appears to itself as a spatiotemporal object (on\nthis issue, see Adams (1997), Aquila (1979), and Ameriks\u2019\ndiscussion of Aquila in his 1982).\n\nHowever, the characterization of these views as \u201cone\nobject\u201d and \u201ctwo object\u201d is unfortunate, because it\nis not a commitment of \u201ctwo object\u201d readings that, for\neach appearance, there is one and only one thing in itself that\nappears as that object. The \u201ctwo object\u201d interpreter can\nhold that each appearance is the appearance of an indefinite plurality\nof things in themselves. Nor is the other standard moniker, \u201cone\nworld\u201d versus \u201ctwo world\u201d, helpful, either, for\n\u201cworld\u201d is a technical term in Kant\u2019s metaphysics\nand has a very specific\n meaning.[55]\n One can coherently hold a \u201cnon-identity\u201d interpretation\nwhile denying that appearances in space and time constitute a\n\u201cworld\u201d at\n all.[56]\n\nThis section explores how the identity/non-identity debate relates to\nthe non-phenomenalist/phenomenalist debate. They have often been\nconflated by equating the \u201ctwo world\u201d interpretation\n(non-identity) with the phenomenalist one, and conversely, by equating\nthe \u201cone world\u201d interpretation (identity) with the\nanti-phenomenalist one. There are grounds to think, however, that\nthese are distinct debates.\n Section 5.1\n examines whether claims about the numerical identity or non-identity\nof appearances and things in themselves are meaningful at all, and, if\nthey are, what warrant we could have for making them within\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy.\n Section 5.2\n looks at whether paradigmatically anti-phenomenalist interpretations\n(e.g., Langton 1998) can be understood as non-identity views.\n Section 5.3\n examines some reasons for thinking that the phenomenalist\ninterpretation is compatible with the \u201cidentity\u201d of\nappearances and things in themselves.\n Section 5.4\n considers the interpretive landscape in light of these\n results.[57]\n5.1 Identity between appearances and things in themselves\n\nAs Henry Allison and others have pointed out, it is not clear that\nthere is any content to the question of whether an appearance is\nnumerically identical to a thing in itself, outside of moral\n contexts.[58]\n It is relatively clear that in the context of his moral philosophy,\nKant wants to assert that one and the same object, a rational agent,\ncan be considered as an appearance and as a thing in itself.\nConsidered as an appearance, a rational agent is subject to conditions\nof experience (space, time, and the categories). Considered as a thing\nin itself, a rational agent can at least consistently be thought of as\nfree (because independent of the deterministic causal order of space\nand time), while practical reason gives us warrant for positively\nasserting that the agent is free. Kant typically expresses this\nsolution to the problem of freedom and determinism in terms of the\nnumerical identity of the appearance of the agent and the agent as\nthing in itself (e.g., Ak. 5: 105, 114). Practical reason gives both\ncontent and warrant to the assertion of numerical identity:\ncontent, because the assertion of numerical identity means\nthat one and the same noumenal agent is the cause of and therefore\nresponsible for the actions of an empirical rational agent\nover time, and warrant, because this assumption of the unity\nof a noumenal agent over time is a presupposition of our ordinary\nmoral cognition of blame and praise. But neither of these seem to hold\nin the theoretical use of reason. It is not clear that within the\ntheoretical use of reason we can give any content to the\nclaim of the numerical identity (or distinctness) of appearances and\nthings in themselves, nor any warrant for asserting or denying\n it.[59]\n\nIn defense of the contentfulness of these identity claims, one might\nargue that the term \u201cappearance\u201d and \u201cthing in\nitself\u201d each has an extension, a set of objects, and the\nquestion of identity is perfectly well-formed: do these two sets have\na non-empty intersection? If so, at least one appearance is identical\nto a thing in itself. But this argument begs the question by assuming\nthat the question of whether the set of appearances and the set of\nthing in themselves has an intersection is itself well-formed; whether\nthis is the case is precisely what is at issue.\n\nWhile many interpreters (notably Adams 1997: 822) think that we can\nhave no warrant for asserting the identity or non-identity of\nappearances and things in themselves in general, and thus think the\nidentity/non-identity debate (at least in theoretical contexts)\nconcerns something about which Kant must be agnostic, there are those\nwho disagree (Stang 2014; cf. Walker 2010). In texts quoted earlier,\nKant claims that appearances would cease to exist if there were not\nminds to experience them. On the assumption that this is not true of\nthings in themselves, consider the following argument:\n\n(P1) \n For any x, if x is an appearance, x\nwould not exist if there were no minds to experience it.\n (P2) \n For any x, if x is a thing in itself,\nx would exist if there were no minds to experience it.\n (C) \n For any x, if x is an appearance, x is\nnot a thing in itself.\n\n\nThis argument purports to show that, since appearances and things in\nthemselves have different modal properties, they must be distinct.\nSince (P1) and (P2) are claims Kant makes in the context of his\ntheoretical philosophy, this argument provides warrant for denying\nidentity on purely theoretical grounds.\n5.2 Langton and non-identity\n\nLangton\u2019s view can be interpreted as either an identity reading\nor a non-identity reading. The difference is somewhat subtle, but it\nhas important consequences. On the identity version of Langton (1998),\nto talk about things in themselves is to predicate intrinsic\nproperties of substances, while to talk about phenomena is to\npredicate extrinsic properties of those very substances. On\nthe non-identity version of Langton (1998), phenomena are numerically\nidentical to those extrinsic properties. This would be a non-identity\nreading because substances are not identical to their properties\n(either extrinsic or intrinsic). By contrast, on the identity reading,\nan expression for a phenomenon refers to a substance. The\ndifference between these readings can be illustrated by how they give\ntruth-conditions for the judgment that some phenomenon x has\nproperty F:\n\n(Identity) x has F = F is among\nthe extrinsic properties of x\n\n(Non-Identity) x has F = x, an\nextrinsic property of some substance y (\u2260x), has\nF\n\nWhile Langton initially explains her view in a way that suggests an\nidentity reading, she in fact opts for a non-identity reading, for\ngood reason. Firstly, on the identity reading Kant would have to\nidentify subjects of predication in empirical judgments with\nsubstances. This is problematic because it would bring substances into\nthe world of space and time. For instance, if I can make a judgment\nabout this table, then it would be a judgment about the extrinsic\nproperties of this table, and this table would be a substance with\nintrinsic properties (although being a table would, presumably, not be\none of them). Alternately, if we identify the table as a collection of\nextrinsic properties of substances, then we can go on to predicate\nfurther properties of the table, without having to identify the\nsubstance or substances of which the table is ultimately\n predicated.[60]\n5.3 Phenomenalist Dual Aspect Readings\n\nSome scholars have defended what might initially seem like a\ncontradiction in terms: a phenomenalist \u201cone object\u201d\n(identity) interpretation of appearances and things in\n themselves.[61]\n On such a view, the appearance and the thing in itself are one and\nthe same object, but considered with respect to different properties:\nthe properties we experience the object as having, and the properties\nit has. On this interpretation, Kant is qualified phenomenalist\nbecause he holds that:\n\n(PhenomenalismP) The core physical properties of\nobjects in space are grounded in the contents of our experience of\nthem.\n\nHis attitude to:\n\n(PhenomenalismE) The existence of objects in space\nis ground partly or wholly in the contents of our experience of\nthem.\n\ndepends upon how we read it, on this interpretation. On the one hand,\nwe can understand it either as the \u201cde re\u201d\nclaim\n\n(PhenomenalismE*) (x)(x is an\nobject in space \u2283 the existence of x is partly or wholly\ngrounded in our experience of x)\n\nin which case Kant would reject it, because each such object in space\nis also a thing in itself and, as such, does not depend for its\nexistence on our experience of it. On the other hand, we could\nunderstand it as the de dicto claim\n\n(PhenomenalismE**) The fact that there are objects\nin space is partly or wholly grounded in our experience of objects in\nspace.\n\nin which case Kant would accept it, because there being objects in\nspace depends upon our experiencing objects as in space.\n\nThis leads to an important exegetical point. One of the main\nmotivations for \u201cnon-identity\u201d interpretations are\npassages in which Kant claims that appearances would not exist if\nthere were not subjects to experience them, e.g., A42/B59. This might\nbe thought to directly entail phenomenalism, for, if appearances would\nnot exist without subjects to experience them, but things in\nthemselves would, then a fortiori appearances and things in\nthemselves are distinct. This line of reasoning can be represented\nformally as (P1), (P2) and C from section 5.1. But the identity reader\ncan interpret Kant\u2019s claim \u201cif I were to take away the\nthinking subject, the whole corporeal world would have to\ndisappear\u201d as meaning: without subjects to experience them,\nappearances would not exist as appearances, i.e., would not\nappear. In other words, she can reinterpret (P1) as:\n\n(P1*)\n For all x, if x is an appearance, then\nx\u2019s existence as an appearance (=the fact that\nx exists and appears) is grounded in the contents of\nexperience.\n\n\nBut the conjunction of this and (P2) does not entail (C); they are\ncompatible with the identity reading. These passages do not\nforce the non-identity interpretation on us. (For more on\nphenomenalist identity readings see the supplementary article:\n Phenomenalist Identity Readings and the Problem of Illusion.)\n5.4 Assessing the Interpretive Issues\n\nWe have seen some reasons to think that the resolutely\nanti-phenomenalist reading of Langton (1998) and the phenomenalist\nreading can be re-interpreted as, respectively, a non-identity reading\nand an identity reading. One reaction would be to conclude that the\ninterpretive options are simply more complex than is usually\nappreciated:\n\n\n\n\nNon-Identity\nIdentity \n\nEpistemic \nMetaphysical  \n\nPhenomenalist \nAquila (1983), Van Cleve (1999), cf. section 3 \nN/A \nAdickes (1924), Westphal (1968)  \n\nAnti-phenomenalist \nAlternate version of Langton \nAllison (1983/2004), Bird (1962), Prauss (1974) \nLangton (1998), Allais (2006)  \n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nBut the distinction between the two different versions of Langton, and\nbetween the non-identity version of phenomenalism (Aquila 1983; Van\nCleve 1999) and the identity version of phenomenalism (Adickes 1924;\nWestphal 1968) is relatively recondite. It depends on the\ncontroversial assumption that assertions of identity between\nappearances and things in themselves, outside of practical contexts,\nhave a content.\n\nFurthermore, Henry Allison has recently argued that even his view is\nneutral on the identity/non-identity debate:\n\n\nalthough it is sometimes assumed that [the two-aspect reading] commits\nKant to a highly implausible one-to-one mapping of the phenomenal and\nnoumenal, I take that to be a red herring. First, it is one thing to\ndistinguish between things (taken collectively) as they are for us in\nvirtue of the sensible conditions of human cognition and as they might\nbe for some putative pure understanding, unburdened by such\nconditions, and quite another to affirm a one-to-one correspondence or\nisomorphism between the members of the two domains. (Allison 2004: 459\nnote 19; cf. Allison 1987: 168)\n\n\nAllison\u2019s idea is that the distinction between the empirical and\nthe transcendental standpoint is a distinction between how they\nconsider objects as a whole, not how they consider particular\nobjects. The Epistemic reading is not committed to Identity, but\nneither is it committed to Non-Identity. So an Identity version of the\nEpistemic reading is possible (according to which we can consider each\nobject individually from either standpoint), as is an Epistemic\nreading that is neither an Identity nor a Non-Identity reading (on\nwhich we remain agnostic as to whether objects considered from one\nstandpoint are numerically identical to objects considered from\n another).[62]\n So we might conclude that our interpretive options are even more\nnumerous than we initially thought:\n\n\n\n\nNeither Identity nor Non-Identity\n\nNon-Identity \nIdentity  \n\nEpistemic \nMetaphysical  \n\nPhenomenalist \nN/A \nAquila (1983), Van Cleve (1999), cf. section 3 \nN/A \nAdickes (1924), Westphal (1968)  \n\nAnti-phenomenalist \nAllison (1983/2004)\nAlternate version of Langton \nBird (1962), Prauss (1974), alternate version of Allison\n(1983/2004), \nLangton (1998), Allais (2006)  \n\n\nTable 2\n\n\nBut notice we now have doubling of interpretations: identity and\nnon-identity versions of Langton (1998), identity and non-identity\nversions of phenomenalist views, and identity and \u201cneither\nidentity nor non-identity\u201d versions of Allison.\n\nHowever, if one thinks that claims of identity between appearances and\nthings in themselves are contentless (see section 5.1), at least\noutside of the context of practical philosophy, then the menu of\ninterpretive options will appear as:\n\n\n\nPhenomenalist \nAnti-Phenomenalist  \n\nEpistemic \nMetaphysical  \n\nAquila (1983), Van Cleve (1999), Adickes (1924), Westphal\n(1968), cf. section 3 \nAllison (1983/2004), Bird (1962), Prauss (1974) \nLangton (1998), Allais (2006)  \n\n\nTable 3\n\n\nOn such a reading, there is no substance, outside of the practical\ncontext, to the question of whether an appearance is numerically\nidentical to a thing in itself, so the identity and non-identity\nversions of, e.g., phenomenalism, are\n equivalent.[63]\n If one holds instead that these identity claims have a content but\nthat we cannot know them on theoretical grounds alone (see section\n5.1) then one will likewise see these interpretive options as so\nconstrained, because, although there is a difference in content\nbetween, say, the identity and non-identity versions of phenomenalism,\nKant must be agnostic as to which is true.\n6. Things in themselves, noumena, and the transcendental object\n\nUp to this point, we have focused primarily on the nature of Kantian\nappearances, and their relation to things in themselves, questions (a)\nand (c) from section one. However, one of the main questions that must\nbe answered in any interpretation of Kant\u2019s transcendental\nidealism is, what are things in themselves? Obviously, different\ninterpretations will give very different answers to this question:\n\nPhenomenalist interpretations. Perhaps the best statement of\nthe phenomenalist interpretation of things in themselves is given by\nErich Adickes (1924: 14\u201319): things in themselves are a\nplurality of mind-independent centers of force. On this view, things\nin themselves are just what we pre-theoretically took ordinary\nspatiotemporal objects to be: objects that exist, and possess their\ncore physical properties, wholly independently of our representations\nof them, and which are (among) the causal inputs to our perceptual\nfaculties (a variant of this thought is expressed by Ameriks 2003:\n23\u201325).\n\nEpistemic interpretations: On the epistemic reading, things\nin themselves are simply objects considered independently of our\ndistinctively spatiotemporal form of intuition. Thus, they are objects\nconsidered as objects of a discursive cognition in general. This very\nabstract thought is not the basis of any cognition, however; it is\nmerely a reminder that space and time are epistemic conditions,\nwithout which we cannot cognize any object.\n\nMetaphysical \u201cdual aspect\u201d interpretations. On\nthis family of interpretations, things in themselves are objects with\na given set of properties. Different interpretations give a different\nanswer as to which set of properties constitute things \u201cas they\nare in themselves\u201d. On Langton\u2019s reading, for instance,\nthings in themselves are substances with intrinsic properties.\n\nIn this section we distinguish \u201cthings in themselves\u201d from\nother, closely related Kantian notions: noumena, and the\n\u201ctranscendental object\u201d.\n6.1 Phenomena and noumena\n\nIn the section \u201cOn the ground of the distinction of all objects\ninto phenomena and noumena\u201d, which he\nsubstantially revised for the B Edition, Kant reiterates his argument\nthat we cannot cognize objects beyond the bounds of possible\nexperience, and introduces a complex distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena.\n\nFortunately, it is relatively clear what phenomena are:\n\u201cappearances to the extent that as objects they are thought in\naccordance with the unity of the categories are called\nphenomena\u201d (A249). Earlier, in the \u201cAesthetic\u201d, Kant\nhad defined appearance as: \u201cthe undetermined object of an\nempirical intuition\u201d (A20/B34). All objects of empirical\nintuition are appearances, but only those that are \u201cthought in\naccordance with the unity of the categories\u201d are phenomena. For\ninstance, if I have a visual after-image or highly disunified visual\nhallucination, that perception may not represent its object as\nstanding in cause-effect relations, or being an alteration in an\nabsolutely permanent substance. These would be appearances but not\nphenomena. The objects of \u201cuniversal experience\u201d, as\ndefined in section 3, are phenomena because the categories determine\nthe a priori conceptual form; universal experience represents\nits objects under the unity of the categories.\n\nKant\u2019s then introduces the concept of noumena:\n\n\nif, however, I suppose that there be things that are merely objects of\nthe understanding and that, nevertheless, can be given to an\nintuition, although not to sensible intuition (as coram intuiti\nintellectuali), then such things would be called noumena\n(intelligibilia). (A249)\n\n\nThe concept of a noumenon, as defined here, is the concept of an\nobject of cognition for an intellect that is not, like ours,\ndiscursive, and thus has a non-sensible form of intuition, which Kant\nhere designates \u201cintellectual\n intuition\u201d.[64]\n A sensible intuition is one that can only intuit objects by being\ncausally affected by them; a non-sensible intuition is one in which\nthe intuition of the object brings the object into existence. Thus,\nthe concept of a noumenon is the concept of an object that would be\ncognized by an intellect whose intuition brings its very objects into\nexistence. Clearly, we do not cognize any noumena, since to cognize an\nobject for us requires intuition and our intuition is sensible, not\nintellectual.\n\nKant then connects the concept of noumena to things in themselves:\n\n\n\nit also follows naturally from the concept of an appearance in general\nthat something must correspond to it which is not in itself\nappearance, for appearance can be nothing for itself and outside of\nour kind of representation; thus, if there is not to be a constant\ncircle, the word \"appearance\" must already indicate a relation to\nsomething the immediate representation of which is, to be sure,\nsensible, but which in itself, without this constitution of our\nsensibility (on which the form of our intuition is grounded), must be\nsomething, i.e., an object independent of sensibility. Now from this\narises the concept of a noumenon, which, however, is not at\nall positive and does not signify a determinate cognition of something\nin general, in which I abstract from all form of sensible intuition.\n(A251\u20132)\n\n\nThis passage begins with the familiar point that the very concept of\nappearance requires that there be something that is not appearance\nthat appears. Usually Kant makes this point using the concept\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d (e.g., in the Prolegomena\n(Ak. 4:314\u20135); cf. Bxxvi\u2013xxvii, B306, and B307). However,\nhere he claims that this idea\u2014that it cannot be\n\u201cappearances all the way down\u201d\u2014brings with it the\nidea of noumena. This is puzzling. Why must whatever it is that appear\nto us as phenomena be conceived of as an objects of intellectual\nintuition?\n\nKant clarifies precisely this point in the B Edition by distinguishing\nbetween a positive and a negative sense of \u201cnoumena\u201d: \n\n\nIf by a noumenon we understand a thing insofar as it is not an\nobject of our sensible intuition, because we abstract from\nthe manner of our intuition of then this is a noumenon in the\nnegative sense. But if we understand by that an\nobject of a non-sensible intuition then we assume a\nspecial kind of intuition, namely intellectual intuition, which,\nhowever, is not our own, and the possibility of which we cannot\nunderstand, and this would be the noumenon in a\npositive sense. (B307)\n\n\nNoumena in a positive sense are simply noumena as Kant originally\ndefined that notion in the A edition: objects of an intellectual\n(non-sensible) intuition. The negative concept of noumena, however, is\nsimply the concept of objects that are not spatiotemporal (not objects\nof our sensible intuition, namely space and time). But then it follows\nthat things in themselves are noumena in the negative sense,\nretrospectively clarifying the passage from the A edition quoted\nimmediately above, where Kant seems to draw from the\n\u201cTranscendental Aesthetic\u201d the conclusion that there are\nnoumena: the concept of appearance requires that something appears,\nand this must be a negative noumena.\n\nPutting these pieces together we can see that \u201cthings in\nthemselves\u201d [Dinge an sich selbst] and (negative)\n\u201cnoumena\u201d are concepts that belong to two different\ndistinctions: \u201cthing in itself\u201d is one half of the\nappearance/thing in itself distinction, which Kant originally defined\nat A491/B519 in terms of their existence: appearances have no\nexistence \u201cgrounded in themselves\u201d while things in\nthemselves do. \u201cNoumena\u201d is one half of the distinction\nphenomena/noumena which Kant characterizes at B307 as the distinction\nbetween what can be an object of our sensible spatiotemporal intuition\nand what cannot be an object of sensible intuition. (Kant here appears\nto overlook the possibility of objects of sensible but\nnon-spatiotemporal intuition). One is a distinction in what ground the\nexistence of objects; the other is a distinction in what kinds of\nintuition can present those objects. However, we can make a connection\nbetween them: things in themselves, the objects whose existence is\n\u201cground in itself\u201d, and which appear to us in space and\ntime, cannot be objects of any sensible intuition, so they are\nnegative noumena. Whether, additionally, they are also objects of an\nintuitive intellect, is a separate matter. This is a point about the\nrelations among these concepts; it holds whether or not they are\npossibly instantiated.\n6.2 The transcendental object = X\n\nIn the \u201cPhenomena and noumena\u201d section, Kant distinguishes\nthe concept of a noumenon from the concept of a \u201ctranscendental\nobject\u201d (A250). This is a reference to a notion introduced in\nthe A version of the \u201cTranscendental Deduction\u201d: \n\n\nThe pure concept of the transcendental object (which in all of our\ncognition is really one and the same = X) is that which in all\nof our empirical concepts in general can provide relation to an\nobject, i.e., objective reality. Now this concept cannot contains any\ndeterminate intuition at all, and therefore contains nothing but that\nunity which must be encountered in a manifold of cognition insofar as\nit stands in relation to an object. (A109; cf. A104)\n\n\nThe \u201cconcept of a transcendental object\u201d might be\nfruitfully thought of as \u201cthe transcendental concept of an\nobject\u201d: the concept of \u201cobject\u201d that makes\nexperience possible. Our mind\u2019s synthesis of representations\ninto experience of objects is guided and made possible by the idea\nthat there is a way objects are that must be tracked by our\nrepresentations of them. This wholly abstract concept of \u201ca way\nthings are\u201d is the concept of the transcendental object =\nX, the indeterminate concept of the \u201ctarget\u201d of our\nrepresentational activity. Consequently, the concept of the\ntranscendental object must be distinct from the concept of\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d or \u201cnegative noumena\u201d.\nThe concept of things in themselves is the concept of the (unknowable\nby us) objects (or aspects of objects) that appear to us the 3D world\nof space and time. They are the grounds of phenomena, while the\ntranscendental object is the very abstract idea of those objects in\nspace and time as the targets of our cognitive activity.\n\nAnother way to appreciate this distinction is to consider the\ndifference in why these notions of object (noumena, transcendental\nobject) are unknowable by us. We cannot cognize things in themselves\nbecause cognition requires intuition, and our intuition only ever\npresents appearances, not things in themselves. We cannot cognize the\ntranscendental object because the transcendental object is a purely\nschematic, general idea of empirical objectivity. Whenever we cognize\na determinate empirical object we are cognitively deploying the\ntranscendental concept of an object in general, but we are not coming\nto know anything about the object of that concept as such.\n\nThis is Kant\u2019s point in \u201cphenomena and noumena\u201d when\nhe writes: \n\n\nThis transcendental object cannot even be separated from the sensible\ndata, for then nothing would remain through which it would be\nthought. It is therefore no object of cognition in itself, but only\nthe representation of appearances under the concept of an object in\ngeneral, which is determinable through the manifold of those\nappearances. (A250\u20131) \n\n\nThe (negative) concept of a noumenon is the concept of an object that\nis not an object of our sensible spatiotemporal intuition. But the\ntranscendental object makes no sense in abstraction from intuition,\nbecause it is merely the abstract concept that the unity of our\nintuitions must have in order to constitute experience of an object\n(cf. Allison\u2019s classic 1968 paper).\n7. Conclusion\n\nThis article has traced the meaning of transcendental idealism,\nsometimes referred to as \u201ccritical\u201d or\n\u201cformal\u201d idealism, through the text of the Critique of\nPure Reason and various interpretive controversies. Historically,\nthe main question dividing different interpretations is whether Kant\nis a phenomenalist about object in space and time and, if so, in what\nsense. The phenomenalist interpretation of Kant, dominant among\nKant\u2019s immediate predecessors and later German idealists, was\nchallenged in twentieth century Anglophone scholarship by, among\nothers, Graham Bird, Gerold Prauss, and Henry Allison. Some later\nscholars have retained a central idea of these scholars\u2019\nreading\u2014that the appearance/thing in itself distinction is a\ndistinction between distinct aspects of objects, not distinct kinds of\nobjects\u2014while jettisoning the purely epistemological\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s idealism. The meaning and philosophical\nsignificance of \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d has been debated\nby Kant\u2019s readers since 1781, and this debate shows no sign of\nabating any time soon.",
