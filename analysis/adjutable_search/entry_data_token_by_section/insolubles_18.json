    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || Gregory of Rimini\n3.7 Gregory of Rimini\n\nGregory of Rimini\u2019s main writing was done in Paris in the 1340s.\nAlthough today we know of no text or passage of his that discusses\ninsolubles, there must have been one, because in 1372 Peter of Ailly\ncites Gregory\u2019s theory in some detail and uses it in writing his\nown treatise on insolubles (see Peter of Ailly [P-CI], and\n Section 4.3\n below).\n\nGregory\u2019s view relies on the traditional medieval notion (going\nback to Aristotle\u2019s On Interpretation 1, 16a3\u20135)\nof \u201cmental language\u201d, the \u201clanguage of\nthought\u201d that underlies and is expressed in spoken and written\n language.[30]\n Unlike spoken and written languages, where the signification of words\nand propositions is thoroughly a matter of convention, signification\nin mental language is fixed by nature once and for all, the same for\neveryone. Consequently, propositions in mental language can never\nsignify otherwise than they \u201cnormally\u201d do. It follows that\nan analysis like Bradwardine\u2019s or Heytesbury\u2019s, or the\nmodified Heytesbury solution, according to which insolubles do signify\notherwise than they normally do, cannot be applied to propositions\nformed in mental language. Although neither Bradwardine nor Heytesbury\nseems to have drawn this conclusion, it follows from their theories\nthat insolubles cannot be formulated in mental language.\n\nIn the absence of any text by Gregory on the topic, we cannot be sure\nthat he reasoned like this from Heytesbury\u2019s position. But for\nwhatever reason, he apparently did confine insolubles to spoken and\nwritten language; for Gregory there are no insolubles in mental\nlanguage. An insoluble proposition in spoken or written language\ncorresponds to and expresses not the mental proposition one\nwould normally expect on the basis of the usual linguistic\nconventions, but a complex and non-paradoxical mental\nproposition.\n\nFor example, where a is the spoken or written proposition\n\u2018a is false\u2019, a corresponds to and expresses\nthe conjunction of two mental propositions. The first\nconjunct signifies that a is false. Note that this mental\nproposition is not the insoluble a, since that was in spoken or\nwritten language whereas this proposition is mental. Unlike a,\nthis proposition is not self-referential; it refers instead to\na.\n\nThe second conjunct signifies that the first conjunct is\nfalse. Since the first conjunct signifies that a is false, this\nmeans that the second conjunct amounts to saying that a is\nnot false, but rather true.\n\nOne way, therefore, of viewing Gregory\u2019s theory is to say that\nhe adopted the modified Heytesbury view described in\n Section 3.5\n above, the view that combines Heytesbury with Bradwardine, but that\nGregory then moved that whole analysis into mental language. As in\nHeytesbury\u2019s theory, insolubles for Gregory do not signify just\nas their words normally do\u2014they do not express the mental\nproposition one would expect from the normal linguistic conventions.\nAs in Bradwardine\u2019s theory, insolubles for Gregory do signify\npartly that way (through the first conjunct of the mental\nproposition). But they do not signify precisely that way;\nthey also signify that they are true (through the second conjunct of\nthe mental proposition).\n\nGiven our present knowledge of Gregory\u2019s views, this\nreconstruction must remain speculative.\n",
