Alternative Non-Deontic Bases 1: Relevance Logic\n\nMally\u2019s informal postulates (i)\u2013(iii) and (v) are conditionals or\nnegations of conditionals, i.e., of the form \u201cif \u2026 then\n\u2014\u201d or \u201cnot: if \u2026 then \u2014.\u201d\nF\u00f8llesdal and Hilpinen (1981, pp.\u00a05-6) have suggested that\nsuch conditionals should not be formalized in terms of material\nimplication and that some sort of strict implication would be more\nappropriate. But this suggestion is not altogether satisfactory, for\nboth A \u2192 !A and A \u2194 !A are derivable in the very weak system\nS0.90 plus I\u2032 and III\u2032, where\n\u2192 is the symbol of strict\n implication.[7]\n\nIn systems of strict implication the so-called paradoxes of material\nimplication (such as A \u2192 (B \u2192 A)) are avoided, but the\nso-called paradoxes of strict implication (such as (A & \u00acA)\n\u2192 B) remain. What would happen to Mally\u2019s system if both\nkinds of paradoxes were avoided? This question can be answered by\nadding Mally\u2019s axioms to a system in which none of the so-called\n\u201cfallacies of relevance\u201d can be derived (see the entry on\n relevance logic).\n\nIn the following, we will add Mally\u2019s axioms to the prominent\nrelevance logic R. The result is better than in the\ncase of strict implication: most of the theorems which Mally regarded\nas surprising are no longer derivable, and Menger\u2019s theorem A \u2194\n!A is not derivable either. But many \u201cplausible\u201d theorems\ncan still be derived.\n\nRelevant system R with the propositional constant t\n(\u201cthe conjunction of all truths\u201d) has the following axioms\nand rules (Anderson & Belnap 1975, ch.\u00a0V; \u2194 is defined\nby A \u2194 B = (A \u2192 B) & (B \u2192 A)):\n\n\nSelf-implication.\nA \u2192 A \n\nPrefixing.\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 ((C \u2192 A) \u2192 (C \u2192 B))\n\n\nContraction.\n(A \u2192 (A \u2192 B)) \u2192 (A \u2192 B) \n\nPermutation.\n(A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 (B \u2192 (A \u2192 C))\n\n\n& Elimination.\n(A & B) \u2192 A, (A & B) \u2192 B \n\n& Introduction.\n((A \u2192 B) & (A \u2192 C)) \u2192 (A\n\u2192 (B & C)) \n\n\u2228 Introduction.\nA \u2192 (A \u2228 B), B \u2192 (A \u2228 B) \n\n\u2228 Elimination.\n((A \u2192 C) & (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 ((A \u2228 B) \u2192\nC) \n\nDistribution.\n(A & (B \u2228 C)) \u2192 ((A & B) \u2228 C) \n\nDouble Negation.\n\u00ac\u00acA \u2192 A \n\nContraposition.\n(A \u2192 \u00acB) \u2192 (B \u2192 \u00acA) \n\nAx.\u00a0t.\nA \u2194 (t \u2192 A) \n\nModus Ponens.\nA, A \u2192 B / B \n\nAdjunction.\nA, B / A & B \n\n\nA relevant version RD of Mally\u2019s deontic system may\nbe defined as follows:\n\nThe language is the same as the language of R,\nexcept that we write V instead of t, add the propositional constant U\nand the unary connective !, and define \u039b, \u2229, f and \u221e\nas in Mally\u2019s system.\nAxiomatization: add Mally\u2019s Axioms\u00a0I-V to the axioms and\nrules of R.\n\n\nRD has the following properties.\n\nAxioms\u00a0I, II and III may be replaced by the following three\nsimpler\n axioms:[8]\n\n\nI*.\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 (!A \u2192 !B) \n\nII*.\n(!A & !B) \u2192 !(A & B) \n\nIII*.\n!(!A \u2192 A) \n\n\nFormulas I\u2032\u2013V\u2032, (3), (4), (6), (8)\u2013(11), (14),\n(16)\u2013(18), (23\u2032) and (30) are theorems of\n RD.[9]\nFormulas (1), (2), (5), (7), (12), (13), (15), (19)\u2013(23),\n(24)\u2013(29), (31)\u2013(35), A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are not\n derivable.[10]\nThere are 12 mismatches between RD and Mally\u2019s\nexpectations: (5), (12)\u2013(13), (15), (19)\u2013(21), (23) and (24)\u2013(26) are\nnot derivable even though Mally did not regard these formulas as\nsurprising, and (30) is a theorem even though Mally viewed it as\nsurprising.\nFormulas (34) and (35) (the formulas which Mally viewed as the\nmost surprising theorems of his system) are in a sense stranger than\nMenger\u2019s theorem A \u2194 !A because the latter theorem is derivable\nin RD supplemented with (34) or (35) while neither\n(34) nor (35) is derivable in RD supplemented with A\n\u2194\n !A.[11]\n\n\nAlthough most of Mally\u2019s surprising theorems are not derivable in\nRD, this has nothing to do with Mally\u2019s own reasons\nfor regarding these theorems as surprising. They are not derivable in\nRD because they depend on fallacies of relevance.\nMally never referred to such fallacies to explain his surprise. His\nconsiderations were quite different, as we have already described.\n\nRD is closely related to Anderson\u2019s relevant deontic\nlogic ARD, which is defined as R\nsupplemented with the following two axioms (Anderson 1967, 1968,\nMcArthur 1981; Anderson used the unary connective O instead of !):\n\n\nARD1.\n!A \u2194 (\u00acA \u2192 \u2229) \n\nARD2.\n!A \u2192 \u00ac!\u00acA \n\n\nAll theorems of RD are theorems of\n ARD.[12]\nARD1( \u2192 ) is not a theorem of\n RD+ARD2.[13]\n This formula does not occur in Mally\u2019s book. According to Anderson,\nBohnert (1945) was the first one to propose\n it.[14]\nARD2 is not a theorem of\n RD+ARD1.[15]\n This formula does not occur in Mally\u2019s book, but Mally endorsed the\ncorresponding informal principle: \u201ca person who wills correctly\ndoes not will (not even implicitly) the negation of what he wills;\ncorrect willing is free of\n contradictions.\u201d[16]\nRD supplemented with ARD1( \u2192 ) and ARD2 has\nthe same theorems as\n ARD.[17]\n\n\nAnderson\u2019s system has several problematical features (McArthur 1981,\nGoble 1999, 2001) and RD shares most of these\nfeatures. But we will not go into this issue here. It is at any rate\nclear that RD is better than Mally\u2019s original\nsystem.\n",
