He was working on an article that he intended to publish\nin Mind, the first part of which was posthumously made\navailable in his Collected Essays vol.2, under the simple\ntitle \u201cRelations\u201d. This manuscript is significant because\nBradley is, on the one hand, restating in a slightly different way\nwhat he takes to be the most salient arguments from his previous works\nand, on the other hand, expanding his attack on relations.\n\nThus, we find again his regress argument against external relations,\nmotivated by his assumption that such relations cannot relate;\nexternal relations are, he writes, no more than \u201cmere\nabstractions\u201d from relational facts and as such hold no relating\npower (Bradley 1926: 643). Internal relations are no improvement, and\nBradley rejects as untrue any suggestions that he might have wanted to\naccept them (642). The true problem seems to be that \u201can actual\nrelation [\u2026] must possess at once both the characters of a\n\u2018together\u2019 and a \u2018between\u2019, and, failing\neither of these, is a relation no longer\u201d Bradley 1926: 644,\n634). Thus, just as in his Appearance and Reality (1893),\nBradley is demanding of relations that they fulfill both an\n\u201cin-between role\u201d (what I have called above a\ndifference-making role) as well as the \u201ctogether\u201d\nrole (what I have called the unifying role). Failing either of these\nroles amounts to not being a true relation, which in turn makes the\npresumed relational experience contradictory, for Bradley:\n\nRelational experience must hence in its very essence be\nself-contradictory. Contradiction everywhere is the attempt to take\nwhat is plural and diverse as being one and the same, and to take it\nso (we must add) simply or apart from any \u201chow\u201d. And we\nhave seen that without both diversity and unity the relational\nexperience is lost, while to combine these two aspects it has left to\nit no possible \u201chow\u201d or way, except one which seems either\ncertainly less or certainly more than what is relational. (Bradley\n1926: 635)\n\nAs this often quoted passage illustrates, Bradley\u2019s skepticism\nabout relations takes the form of the \u201chow\u201d question.\nBradley\u2019s \u201chow\u201d question is often read as\n\u201cHow do relations relate?\u201d. But taking into\naccount the wider context, his question is actually\n\u201cHow might relations at the same time relate\nand diversify their relata?\u201d. Failing to see how\nrelations might do both, Bradley concludes that relational\nexperience is marred by contradiction.\n\nFinally, by the end of \u201cRelations\u201d, Bradley wishes to make\nit clear that what is fatal to his monism is not just a specific type\nof relations (such as asymmetric relations), but an ultimate reality\nof any kind of relation: \u201cFor not one kind of relation,\nbut every and any relation, if taken as an ultimate reality, would (on\nany view such as mine) be fatal to Monism\u201d (Bradley 1926: 649).\nThis is an important reminder of Bradley\u2019s own motivation for\nhis repeated arguments against\n relations.[2]\n",
