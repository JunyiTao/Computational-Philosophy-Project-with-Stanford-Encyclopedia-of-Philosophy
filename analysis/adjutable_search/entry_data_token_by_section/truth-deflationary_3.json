    "main_text": "History of Deflationism\n2. History of Deflationism\n\nAccording to Michael Dummett (1959 [1978]), deflationism originates\nwith\n Gottlob Frege,\n as expressed in this famous quote by the latter:\n\nIt is \u2026 worthy of notice that the sentence \u2018I smell the\nscent of violets\u2019 has just the same content as the sentence\n\u2018It is true that I smell the scent of violets\u2019. So it\nseems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to\nit the property of truth. (Frege 1918, 6)\n\n\nThis passage suggests that Frege embraces a deflationary view in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (in the chart above), namely, an analytic\npropositionalist version of deflationism. But this interpretation of\nhis view is not so clear. As Scott Soames (1999, 21ff) points out,\nFrege (ibid.) distinguishes what we will call \u201copaque\u201d\ntruth ascriptions, like \u2018My conjecture is true\u2019, from\ntransparent truth-ascriptions, like the one mentioned in the quote\nfrom Frege. Unlike with transparent cases, in opaque instances, one\ncannot simply strip \u2018is true\u2019 away and obtain an\nequivalent sentence, since the result is not even a sentence at\nall.\n\nFrank Ramsey\n is the first philosopher to have suggested a position like\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (although he does not really accept propositions as\nabstract entities (see Ramsey 1927 (34\u20135) and 1929 (7)), despite\nsometimes talking in terms of propositions):\n\nTruth and falsity are ascribed primarily to propositions. The\nproposition to which they are ascribed may be either explicitly given\nor described. Suppose first that it is explicitly given; then it is\nevident that \u2018It is true that Caesar was murdered\u2019 means\nno more than that Caesar was murdered, and \u2018It is false that\nCaesar was murdered\u2019 means no more than Caesar was not murdered.\n\u2026. In the second case in which the proposition is described and\nnot given explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019. Thus if I say\n\u2018He is always right\u2019, I mean that the propositions he\nasserts are always true, and there does not seem to be any way of\nexpressing this without using the word \u2018true\u2019. But suppose\nwe put it thus \u2018For all \\(p\\), if he asserts \\(p\\), \\(p\\) is\ntrue\u2019, then we see that the propositional function \\(p\\) is true\nis simply the same as \\(p\\), as e.g. its value \u2018Caesar was\nmurdered is true\u2019 is the same as \u2018Caesar was\nmurdered\u2019. (Ramsey 1927, 38\u20139)\n\n\nOn Ramsey\u2019s redundancy theory (as it is often called), the truth\noperator, \u2018it is true that\u2019 adds no content when prefixed\nto a sentence, meaning that in the instances of what we can think of\nas the truth-operator version of (ES),\n\n(ES-op)\nIt is true that \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\),\n\n\nthe left- and right-hand sides are meaning-equivalent. But Ramsey\nextends his redundancy theory beyond just the transparent instances of\ntruth-talk, maintaining that the truth predicate is, in principle,\neliminable even in opaque ascriptions of the form \u2018\\(B\\) is\ntrue\u2019 (which he (1929, 15, n. 7) explains in terms of sentential\nvariables via a formula along the lines of \u2018\\(\\exists\np\\) (\\(p \\amp B\\) is a belief that \\(p\\))\u2019) and in explicitly\nquantificational instances, like \u2018Everything Einstein said is\ntrue\u2019 (explained as above). As the above quote illustrates,\nRamsey recognizes that in truth ascriptions like these the truth\npredicate fills a grammatical need, which keeps us from eliminating it\naltogether, but he held that even in these cases it contributes no\ncontent to anything said using it.\n\nA.J. Ayer\n endorses a view similar to Ramsey\u2019s. The following quote shows\nthat he embraces a meaning equivalence between the two sides of the\ninstances of both the sentential (position \\(\\mathbf{A})\\) and\nsomething like (since, despite his use of the expression\n\u2018proposition\u2019 to mean sentence, he also considers\ninstances of truth-talk involving the prefix \u2018it is true\nthat\u2019, which could be read as employing\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses) the propositional (position\n\\(\\mathbf{B})\\) version of (ES).\n\n[I]t is evident that a sentence of the form \u201c\\(p\\) is\ntrue\u201d or \u201cit is true that \\(p\\)\u201d the reference to\ntruth never adds anything to the sense. If I say that it is true that\nShakespeare wrote Hamlet, or that the proposition\n\u201cShakespeare wrote Hamlet\u201d is true, I am saying\nno more than that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet. Similarly, if I\nsay that it is false that Shakespeare wrote the Iliad, I am\nsaying no more than that Shakespeare did not write the Iliad.\nAnd this shows that the words \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019 are not used to stand for anything, but function\nin the sentence merely as assertion and negation signs. That is to\nsay, truth and falsehood are not genuine concepts. Consequently, there\ncan be no logical problem concerning the nature of truth. (Ayer 1935,\n28. Cf. Ayer 1936 [1952, 89])\n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein,\n under Ramsey\u2019s influence, makes claims with strong affinities\nto deflationism in his later work. We can see a suggestion of an\nendorsement of deflationary positions \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)\nin his (1953, \u00a7136) statement that \u201c\\(p\\) is true \\(=\np\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(p\\) is false = not-\\(p\\)\u201d, indicating\nthat ascribing truth (or falsity) to a statement just amounts to\nasserting that very proposition (or its negation). Wittgenstein also\nexpresses this kind of view in manuscripts from the 1930s, where he\nclaims, \u201cWhat he says is true = Things are as he says\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he word \u2018true\u2019 is used in contexts such as\n\u2018What he says is true\u2019, but that says the same thing as\n\u2018He says \\(\\ldquo p\\rdquo,\\) and \\(p\\) is the\ncase\u2019\u201d. (Wittgenstein 1934 [1974, 123]) and 1937 [2005,\n61]), respectively)\n\nPeter Strawson\u2019s\n views on truth emerge most fully in his 1950 debate with\n J.L. Austin.\n In keeping with deflationary position \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), Strawson (1950,\n145\u20137) maintains that an utterance of \u2018It is true that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 just makes the same statement as an utterance of\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019. However, in Strawson 1949 and 1950, he further\nendorses a performative view, according to which an utterance\nof a sentence like \u2018That is true\u2019 mainly functions to do\nsomething beyond mere re-assertion. This represents a shift\nto an account of what the expression \u2018true\u2019 does,\nfrom traditional accounts of what truth is, or even accounts of what\n\u2018true\u2019 means.\n\nAnother figure briefly mentioned above who looms large in the\ndevelopment of deflationism is\n Alfred Tarski,\n with his (1935 [1956] and 1944) identification of a precise criterion\nof adequacy for any formal definition of truth: its implying all of\nthe instances of what is sometimes called \u201cConvention (T)\u201d\nor \u201cthe (T)-schema\u201d,\n\n(T)\n\\(X\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nTo explain this schema a bit more precisely, in its instances the\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 gets replaced by a name of a sentence from the\nobject-language for which the truth predicate is being\ndefined, and the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 gets replaced by a sentence that\nis a translation of that sentence into the meta-language in which the\ntruth predicate is being defined. For Tarski, the \u2018if and only\nif\u2019 deployed in any instance of (T) expresses just a material\nequivalence, putting his view at position \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) in the chart\nfrom Section 1.1. Although this means that Tarski is not a\ndeflationist himself (cf. Field 1994a, Ketland 1999, and Patterson\n2012), there is no denying the influence that his work and its\npromotion of the (T)-schema have had on deflationism. Indeed, some\nearly deflationists, such as\n W.V.O. Quine\n and Stephen Leeds, are quite explicit about taking inspiration from\nTarski\u2019s work in developing their \u201cdisquotational\u201d\nviews, as is Horwich in his initial discussion of deflationism. Even\ncritics of deflationism have linked it with Tarski: Hilary Putnam\n(1983b, 1985) identifies deflationists as theorists who \u201crefer\nto the work of Alfred Tarski and to the semantical conception of\ntruth\u201d and who take Tarski\u2019s work \u201cas a solution to\nthe philosophical problem of truth\u201d.\n\nThe first fully developed deflationary view is the one that Quine\n(1970 [1986, 10\u20132]) presents. Given his skepticism about the\nexistence of propositions, Quine takes sentences to be the primary\nentities to which \u2018is true\u2019 may be applied, making the\ninstances of (ES-sent) the equivalences that he accepts. He defines a\ncategory of sentence that he dubs \u201ceternal\u201d, viz.,\nsentence types that have all their indexical/contextual factors\nspecified, the tokens of which always have the same truth-values. It\nis for these sentences that Quine offers his disquotational view. As\nhe (ibid., 12) puts it,\n\n\nThis cancellatory force of the truth predicate is explicit in\nTarski\u2019s paradigm:\n\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true if and only if snow is white.\n\n\nQuotation marks make all the difference between talking about words\nand talking about snow. The quotation is a name of a sentence that\ncontains the name, namely \u2018snow\u2019, of snow. By calling the\nsentence true, we call snow white. The truth predicate is a device of\ndisquotation.\n\n\nAs this quote suggests, Quine sees Tarski\u2019s formal work on\ndefining truth predicates for formalized languages and his criterion\nof adequacy for doing so as underwriting a disquotational analysis of\nthe truth predicate. This makes Quine\u2019s view a different kind of\nposition-\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) account, since he takes the left-hand side of\neach instance of (ES-sent) to be, as we will put it (since Quine\nrejects the whole idea of meaning and meaning equivalence), something\nlike a mere syntactic variant of the right-hand side. This also means\nthat Quine\u2019s version of deflationism departs from inflationism\nby rejecting the latter\u2019s presupposition that truth predicates\nfunction to describe the entities they get applied to, the\nway that other predicates, such as \u2018is metal\u2019, do.\n\nQuine also emphasizes the importance of the truth predicate\u2019s\nrole as a means for expressing the kinds of otherwise inexpressible\ngeneralizations discussed in Section 1.3. As he (1992, 80\u20131)\nexplains it,\n\nThe truth predicate proves invaluable when we want to generalize along\na dimension that cannot be swept out by a general term \u2026 The\nharder sort of generalization is illustrated by generalization on the\nclause \u2018time flies\u2019 in \u2018If time flies then time\nflies\u2019\u2026. We could not generalize as in \u2018All men are\nmortal\u2019 because \u2018time flies\u2019 is not, like\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, a name of one of a range of objects (men) over\nwhich to generalize. We cleared this obstacle by semantic\nascent: by ascending to a level where there were indeed objects\nover which to generalize, namely linguistic objects, sentences.\n\n\nSo, if we want to generalize on embedded sentence-positions within\nsome sentences, \u201cwe ascend to talk of truth and sentences\u201d\n(Quine 1970 [1986, 11]). This maneuver allows us to \u201caffirm some\ninfinite lot of sentences that we can demarcate only by talking about\nthe sentences\u201d (ibid., 12).\n\nLeeds (1978) (following Quine) makes it clear how the truth predicate\nis crucial for extending the expressive power of a language, despite\nthe triviality that disquotationalism suggests for the transparent\ninstances of truth-talk. He (ibid., 121) emphasizes the logical role\nof the truth predicate in the expression of certain kinds of\ngeneralizations that would otherwise be inexpressible in natural\nlanguage. Leeds, like Quine, notes that a central utility of the truth\npredicate, in virtue of its yielding every instance of (ES-sent), is\nthe simulation of quantification into sentence-positions. But, unlike\nQuine, Leeds glosses this logical role in terms of expressing\npotentially infinite conjunctions (for universal generalization) or\npotentially infinite disjunctions (for existential generalization).\nThe truth predicate allows us to use the ordinary devices of\nfirst-order logic in ways that provide surrogates for the non-standard\nlogical devices this would otherwise require. Leeds is also clear\nabout accepting the consequences of deflationism, that is, of taking\nthe logically expressive role of the truth predicate to exhaust its\nfunction. In particular, he points out that there is no need to think\nthat truth plays any sort of explanatory role. We will return\nto this point in Section 4.1.\n\nDorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap (1975) develop a\ndifferent variety of deflationism that they call a\n\u201cprosentential theory\u201d. This theory descends principally\nfrom Ramsey\u2019s views. In fact, Ramsey (1929, 10) made what is\nprobably the earliest use of the term \u2018pro-sentence\u2019 in\nhis account of the purpose of truth-talk. Prosentences are explained\nas the sentence-level analog of pronouns. As in the case of pronouns,\nprosentences inherit their content anaphorically from other linguistic\nitems, in this case from some sentence typically called the\nprosentence\u2019s \u201canaphoric antecedent\u201d (although it\nneed not actually occur before the prosentence). As Grover, et\nal. develop this idea, this content inheritance can happen in two\nways. The most basic one is called \u201clazy\u201d anaphora. Here\nthe prosentence could simply be replaced with a repetition of its\nantecedent, as in the sort of case that Strawson emphasized, where one\nsays \u201cThat is true\u201d after someone else has made an\nassertion. According to Grover, et al., this instance of\ntruth-talk is a prosentence that inherits its content anaphorically\nfrom the other speaker\u2019s utterance, so that the two speakers\nassert the same thing. As a result, Grover, et al. would take\nthe instances of (ES) to express meaning equivalences, but since they\n(ibid., 113\u20135) do not take the instances of truth-talk on the\nleft-hand sides of these equivalences to say anything about\nany named entities, they would not read (ES) as either (ES-sent) or\n(ES-prop) on their standard interpretations. So, while their\nprosententialism is similar to views in position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in the chart above, it is also somewhat\ndifferent from both.\n\nGrover, et al.\u2019s project is to develop the theory\n\u201cthat \u2018true\u2019 can be thought of always as part of a\nprosentence\u201d (ibid., 83). They explain that \u2018it is\ntrue\u2019 and \u2018that is true\u2019 are generally available\nprosentences that can go into any sentence-position. They consider\nthese expressions to be \u201catomic\u201d in the sense of not being\nsusceptible to a subject-predicate analysis giving the\n\u2018that\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019 separate references (ibid.,\n91). Both of these prosentences can function in the \u201clazy\u201d\nway, and Grover, et al. claim (ibid., 91\u20132, 114) that\n\u2018it is true\u2019 can also operate as a quantificational\nprosentence (i.e., a sentential variable), for example, in a\nre-rendering of a sentence like,\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\nin terms of a \u201clong-form\u201d equivalent claim, such as\n\n(8\u2032)\nEverything is such that, if Smith says that it is true, then it is\ntrue.\n\n\nOne immediate concern that this version of prosententialism faces\npertains to what one might call the \u201cparaphrastic\ngymnastics\u201d that it requires. For example, a sentence like\n\u2018It is true that humans are causing climate change\u2019 is\nsaid to have for its underlying logical form the same form as\n\u2018Humans are causing climate change. That is true\u2019 (ibid.,\n94). As a result, when one utters an instance of truth-talk of the\nform \u2018It is true that \\(p\\)\u2019, one states the content of\nthe sentence that goes in for \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 twice. In\ncases of quotation, like \u201c\u2018Birds are dinosaurs\u2019 is\ntrue\u201d, Grover, et al. offer the following rendering,\n\u2018Consider: Birds are dinosaurs. That is true\u2019 (ibid.,\n103). But taking this as the underlying form of quotational instance\nof truth-talk requires rejecting the standard view that putting\nquotation marks around linguistic items forms names of those items.\nThese issues raise concerns regarding the adequacy of this version of\nprosententialism.\n",
