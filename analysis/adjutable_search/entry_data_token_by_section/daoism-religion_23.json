    "main_text": "Gods and Rituals || The Pantheon\n5.2 The Pantheon\n\nThe supreme Daoist deities are the Three Clarities (or Three Pures, Sanqing),\neach of which rules over one heaven (for their names, see\n \u00a73.4).\n They are associated with different pre-cosmic eras and are deemed to\nbe at the origins of the textual corpora associated with the Three\nCaverns. Along the history of Daoism, the Three Clarities have been\nsupplemented, but never replaced, by other deities that effectively\nmight share with them the title of \u201chighest Daoist\ndeities\u201d. Most important among them are Taiyi, or Great One, who\nrepresents the fundamental Unity of the cosmos in a deified form; and\nYuhuang, or Jade Sovereign, the highest god of popular religion before\nhis incorporation in the Daoist pantheon in the Song period.\n\nSeveral other gods, such as the \u201cemperors\u201d (or\n\u201cthearchs\u201d, di) of the five directions, represent\ncosmological principles. In addition, a multitude of deities, most of\nwhich originate from local cults and are shared with the common\nreligion, contribute to form a pantheon that is impossible to describe\nin full, as it takes different forms in different places and times\n(Lagerwey 2010: 19\u201355; iconography in Little 2000, Delacour et\nal. 2010, Huang 2012, and Fava 2013). To give a few examples, these\ndeities include the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwang Mu, an ancient\ngoddess of the immortals); the Mother of the Dipper (a deity of Indian\norigin, especially associated with children and childbirth); Mazu (a\nwoman who lived in the late 10th century and was deified as\nthe protector of sailors and fishermen, but also of women seeking\nchildren); Zhenwu (the protector of the Ming dynasty, related to the\nNorthern Dipper and provided with exorcist and healing powers);\nMarshall Wen (Wen Yuanshuai, who gave up his life to prevent\n\u201cplague spirits\u201d from poisoning local wells); and the\n\u201cplague spirits\u201d themselves, who are appeased in Daoist\nrituals called Plague Offerings (wenjiao).\n",
