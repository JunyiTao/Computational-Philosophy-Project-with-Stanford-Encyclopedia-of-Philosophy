    "main_text": "\n\nTibetan philosophers argue that the two truths theory is not only core\nontological doctrine as it is understood within the Indian Buddhist\nthought, it also makes the central theory behind epistemology and\nsoteriology. The Indian Buddhist schools are named after the theories\nof the two truths they each upheld as in the entry on the\n theory of the two truths in India.\n The same cannot be said about the schools of thought in Tibet. All\nTibetan philosophers and the\n schools[1]\u2014Nyingma,\n Kagy\u00fc, Sakya, and Gelug\u2014they established are\nself-confessed followers of the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka\nschool of thought, and follow Candrak\u012brti closely. Tibetans agree\nthat Candrak\u012brti is the undisputed authority in commenting and\ninterpreting N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka theory of the two\ntruths. The Tibetan Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gikas however disagreed, debated\nand fought fiercely amongst themselves concerning many philosophical\nquestions. Who is the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika? Does the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika hold any position? What is it that constitutes\nthe Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s core philosophical position? How should\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s hermeneutic approach towards N\u0101g\u0101rjuna be\nassessed, evaluated and interpreted? The debate amongst the Tibetan\nphilosophers stems on a large part from the way in which they each\ndifferently interpreted and understood Candrak\u012brti\u2019s theory of\nthe two truths and its philosophical implications. The parameters\nwithin which this debate is conducted either in the monastic debate\ncourtyards or in their philosophical writings, took a form around\ncertain philosophical themes. Those themes later became the standard\nparadigmatic focus of any discussion on the subject of the two\ntruths.\n\nBasis of the division: What is divided into the two truths?\nEtymological analysis (sgra bshad) of the two truths\nDefinition (mtshan nyid / nges tshig) of the two truths:\nSubjective or objective?\nEnumeration (grangs nges): Is there one or two truths?\nClassification (rab dbye): Are there many types of conventional\ntruth or one?\nRelation: Are the two truths distinct or identical?\n\n\nKeeping with the Tibetan Madhyamaka traditions, the present essay on\nthe theory of the two truths in Tibet focuses on the philosophical\nissues arising from and associated with these themes. Therefore our\nconcern in this article is not historical evolution of the schools, or\nthe philosophers and the ideas to which they each are associated, our\nconcern is rather, first and foremost philosophical.\n",
