    "main_text": "\n\nA citizen is a member of a political community who enjoys the rights\nand assumes the duties of membership. This broad definition is\ndiscernible, with minor variations, in the works of contemporary\nauthors as well as in the entry \u201ccitoyen\u201d in\nDiderot\u2019s and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s\nEncyclop\u00e9die\n [1753].[1]\n Notwithstanding this common starting-point and certain shared\nreferences, the differences between 18th century\ndiscussions and contemporary debates are significant. The\nencyclop\u00e9diste\u2019s main preoccupation,\nunderstandable for one living in a monarchy, was the relationship\nbetween the concepts \u2018citizen\u2019 and \u2018subject\u2019.\nWere they the same (as Hobbes asserted) or contradictory (as a reading\nof Aristotle\n suggested)?[2]\n This issue is less central today as it is often assumed that a\nliberal democratic regime is an appropriate starting-point for\nthinking about citizenship. This does not mean, however, that the\nconcept has become uncontroversial. After a long period of relative\ncalm, there has been a dramatic upsurge in philosophical interest in\ncitizenship since the early 1990s (Kymlicka and Norman 1994).\n\nTwo broad challenges have led theorists to re-examine the concept:\nfirst, the need to acknowledge the internal diversity of contemporary\nliberal democracies; second, the pressures wrought by globalisation on\nthe territorial, sovereign state. We will focus on each of these two\nchallenges, examining how they prompted new discussions and\ndisagreements.\n\nThe entry has four sections. The first examines the main dimensions of\ncitizenship (legal, political, identity) and sees how they are\ninstantiated in very different ways within the two dominant models:\nthe republican and the liberal. The feminist critique of the\nprivate/public distinction, central to both models, serves as a bridge\nto the entry\u2019s second section. It focuses upon two important\ndebates about the implications of social and cultural pluralism to\nconceptions of citizenship: first, should they recognize, rather than\ntranscend, difference and, if so, does this recognition affect\ncitizenship\u2019s purported role in strengthening social cohesion?\nSecond, how is one to understand the relation between citizenship and\nnationality under conditions of pluralism? The third section discusses\nthe challenges which globalisation poses to theories of citizenship.\nThese theories have long taken for granted the idea that\ncitizenship\u2019s necessary context is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. This premise is being contested by those who question the\nstate\u2019s right to determine who is accepted as a member and/or\nclaim that citizenship can be meaningful beyond the boundaries of the\nnation-state. The entry\u2019s fourth and final section looks at how\nrecent discussions in the fields of disability rights and animal\nrights challenge a basic premise of the literature on citizenship\nsince Aristotle: the idea that discursive rationality constitutes a\nthreshold condition to citizenship.\n",
