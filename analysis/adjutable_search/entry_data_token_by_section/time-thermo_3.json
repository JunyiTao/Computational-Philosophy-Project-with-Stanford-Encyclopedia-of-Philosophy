    "main_text": "The Problem of the Direction of Time I || Electromagnetism\n2.2 Electromagnetism\n\nIf we place an isolated concentrated homogeneous gas in the middle of\na large empty volume, we would expect the particles to spread out in\nan expanding sphere about the center of the gas, much as waves of\nradiation spread out from concentrated charge sources. It is therefore\ntempting to think that there is a relationship between the\nthermodynamic and electromagnetic arrows of time. In a debate in 1909,\nAlbert Einstein and Walther Ritz apparently disagreed about the nature\nof this relationship, although the exact points of dispute remain a\nbit unclear. The common story told is that Ritz took the position that\nthe asymmetry of radiation had to be judged lawlike and that the\nthermodynamic asymmetry could be derived from this law.\nEinstein\u2019s position is instead that \u201cirreversibility is\nexclusively based on reasons of probability\u201d (Ritz and Einstein\n1909, English translation from Zeh 1989: 13). It is unclear whether\nEinstein meant probability plus the right boundary conditions, or\nsimply probability alone. In any case, Ritz is said to believe that\nthe radiation arrow causes the thermodynamic one, whereas Einstein is\nsaid to hold something closer to the opposite position. The real story\nis far more complicated, as Ritz had a particle-based ontology in mind\nas well as many additional considerations (see Frisch and Pietsch 2016\nfor subtleties of the actual historical debate).\n\nIf this common tale is correct\u2014and there is reason to\nthink it isn\u2019t the full story\u2014then it seems that Einstein\nmust be closer to being correct than Ritz. Ritz\u2019 position\nappears implausible if only because it implies gases composed of\nneutral particles will not tend to spread out. That aside,\nEinstein\u2019s position is attractive if we concentrate on the wave\nasymmetry mentioned above. Using Popper 1956\u2019s famous mechanical\nwave example as an analogy, throwing a rock into a pond so that waves\non the surface spread out into the future requires every bit the\nconspiracy that is needed for waves to converge on a point in order to\neject a rock from the bottom. However, here it does seem clear that\none process is favored thermodynamically and the other disfavored once\nwe have a thermodynamic arrow in hand. Given a solution to the\nthermodynamic arrow, impulses directed toward the center of a pond\nsuch as to eject a rock are unlikely, whereas a rock triggering\nspherical waves diverging from the point of impact are likely. Here\nthe radiation arrow seems plausibly connected to and perhaps even\nderivable from the thermodynamic arrow. The main interesting\ndifference is that Popper\u2019s time-reversed pond seems\napproximately attainable whereas anti-thermodynamic processes seem\nmore absolutely forbidden (or at least dramatically harder to engine,\nrequiring a so-called Maxwell Demon).\n\nIf the wave asymmetry were the only electromagnetic arrow, then the\nabove sketch would plausibly capture the core connection between the\nthermodynamic and electromagnetic arrows of time. We would have reason\nto think that whatever causes the thermodynamic arrow also is\nresponsible for the electromagnetic arrow. That may ultimately be\ncorrect. However, it\u2019s too early to conclude that, for\nelectromagnetism is chock full of arrows of time besides the wave\nasymmetry.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s equations are well-known to include both\n\u201cadvanced\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d solutions. The\nretarded solution \n\\[ \\phi_{\\text{ret}}(r,t) = \\int dr' \\rho\\frac{(r', t- \\frac{\\lvert r'-r\\rvert}{c})}{\\lvert r'-r\\rvert} \\]\n gives the field amplitude\n\\(\\phi_{\\text{ret}}\\) at \\(r,t\\) by finding the source density \\(r\\)\nat \\(r'\\) at earlier times. The advanced solution \n\\[ \\phi_{\\text{adv}}(r,t) = \\int dr' \\rho\\frac{(r', t+ \\frac{\\lvert r'-r\\rvert}{c})}{\\lvert r'-r\\rvert} \\]\n gives\nthe field amplitude in terms of the source density at \\(r'\\) at later\ntimes. Physicists routinely discard the advanced solutions for reasons\nof \u201ccausality\u201d. It is not so clear thermodynamic\nconsiderations are behind this rejection of solutions, an asymmetry\nmade all the harder to see given the freedom electromagnetism has to\nrewrite retarded fields in terms of advanced fields and outgoing\nsourceless radiation (and vice versa). Electromagnetism is also said\nto allow emissions and not absorptions. Accelerating charges are also\ndamped and not anti-damped by the field. With so many arrows besides\nthe wave asymmetry\u2014emission/absorption, in/out,\nretarded/advanced, damped/anti-damped\u2014it\u2019s premature to\nsay that the thermodynamic arrow is the one arrow to rule them all.\nMost agree that the wave asymmetry is ultimately\n\u201cthermodynamic\u201d but after that matters are contested.\n\nFor further discussion of these controversial points, see the\narticles/chapters by Allori 2015; Arntzenius 1994; Atkinson 2006;\nEarman 2011; Frisch 2000, 2006; Frisch and Pietsch 2016; North 2003;\nPrice 1996, 2006; Rohrlich 2006; and Zeh 1989.\n",
