    "main_text": "Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism\n1. Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism\n\nThe issues we discuss have been debated with vigor and sometimes\nvenom. Some of the people involved have had famous exchanges in the\nlinguistics journals, in the popular press, and in public forums. To\nunderstand the sharp disagreements between advocates of the approaches\nit may be useful to have a sketch of the dramatis personae before us,\neven if it is undeniably an oversimplification.\n\nWe see three tendencies or foci, divided by what they take to be the\nsubject matter, the approach they advocate for studying it, and what\nthey count as an explanation. We characterize them roughly in Table\n1.\n\n\n\n\n \nexternalists\nemergentists\nessentialists \n\nPrimary phenomena\nActual utterances as produced by language users\nFacts of social cognition, interaction, and communication\nIntuitions of grammaticality and literal meaning \n\nPrimary subject matter\nLanguage use; structural properties of expressions and\nlanguages\nLinguistic communication, cognition, variation, and change\nAbstract universal principles that explain the properties of\nspecific languages \n\nAim\nTo describe attested expression structure and interrelations,\nand predicting properties of unattested expressions\nTo explain structural properties of languages in terms of\ngeneral cognitive mechanisms and communicative functions\nTo articulate universal principles and provide explanations for\ndeep and cross-linguistically constant linguistic properties\n\n\nLinguistic structure\nA system of patterns, inferrable from generally accessible,\nobjective features of language use\nA system of constructions that range from fixed idiomatic\nphrases to highly abstract productive types\nA system of abstract conditions that may not be evident from the\nexperience of typical language users \n\nValues\nAccurate modeling of linguistic form that accords with empirical\ndata and permits prediction concerning unconsidered cases\nCognitive, cultural, historical, and evolutionary explanations\nof phenomena found in linguistic communication systems\nHighly abstract, covering-law explanations for properties of\nlanguage as inferred from linguistic intuitions \n\nChildren\u2019s language\nA nascent form of language, very different from adult linguistic\ncompetence\nA series of stages in an ontogenetic process of developing adult\ncommunicative competence\nVery similar to adult linguistic competence though obscured by\ncognitive, articulatory, and lexical limits \n\nWhat is acquired\nA grasp of the distributional properties of the constituents of\nexpressions of a language\nA mainly conventional and culturally transmitted system for\nlinguistic communication\nAn internalized generative device that characterizes an infinite\nset of expressions  \n\n\nTable 1. Three Approaches to the Study\nof Language\n\n\nA broad and varied range of distinct research projects can be pursued\nwithin any of these approaches; one advocate may be more motivated by\nsome parts of the overall project than others are. So the tendencies\nshould not be taken as sharply honed, well-developed research programs\nor theories. Rather, they provide background biases for the\ndevelopment of specific research programs\u2014biases which sometimes\ndevelop into ideological stances or polemical programs or lead to the\nbranching off of new specialisms with separate journals. In the\njudgment of Phillips (2010), \u201cDialog between adherents of\ndifferent approaches is alarmingly rare.\u201d\n\nThe names we have given these approaches are just mnemonic tags, not\ndescriptions. The Externalists, for example, might well have been\ncalled \u2018structural descriptivists\u2019 instead, since they\ntend to be especially concerned to develop models that can be used to\npredict the structure of natural language expressions. The\nExternalists have long been referred to by Essentialists as\n\u2018empiricists\u2019 (and sometimes Externalists apply that term\nto themselves), though this is misleading (see Scholz and Pullum 2006:\n60\u201363): the \u2018empiricist\u2019 tag comes with an\naccusation of denying the role of learning biases in language\nacquisition (see Matthews 1984, Laurence and Margolis 2001), but that\nis no part of the Externalists\u2019 creed (see e.g. Elman 1993,\nLappin and Shieber 2007).\n\nEmergentists are also sometimes referred to by Essentialists as\n\u2018empiricists\u2019, but they either use the Emergentist label\nfor themselves (Bates et al. 1998, O\u2019Grady 2008, MacWhinney\n2005) or call themselves \u2018usage-based\u2019 linguists (Barlow\nand Kemmer 2002, Tomasello 2003) or \u2018construction\ngrammarians\u2019 (Goldberg 1995, Croft 2001). Newmeyer (1991), like\nTomasello, refers to the Essentialists as \u2018formalists\u2019,\nbecause of their tendency to employ abstractions, and to use tools\nfrom mathematics and logic.\n\nDespite these terminological inconsistencies, we can look at what\ntypical members of each approach would say about their vision of\nlinguistic science, and what they say about the alternatives. Many of\nthe central differences between these approaches depend on what\nproponents consider to be the main project of linguistic theorizing,\nand what they count as a satisfying explanation.\n\nMany researchers\u2014perhaps most\u2014mix elements from each of\nthe three approaches. For example, if Emergentists are to explain the\nsyntactic structure of expressions by appeal to facts about the nature\nof the use of symbols in human communication, then they will\npresuppose a great deal of Externalist work in describing linguistic\npatterns, and those Externalists who work on computational parsing\nsystems frequently use (at least as a starting point) rule systems and\n\u2018structural\u2019 patterns worked out by Essentialists.\nCertainly, there are no logical impediments for a researcher with one\ntendency from simultaneously pursuing another; these approaches are\nonly general centers of emphasis.\n",
