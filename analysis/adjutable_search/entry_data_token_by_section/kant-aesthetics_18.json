    "main_text": "Teleology || Teleology, Morality and Religion\n3.7 Relevance of Kant\u2019s Natural Teleology to Contemporary Biological Theory\n\nKant\u2019s writings on natural teleology take for granted the\nbiological theories of his time, which were very different from those\nof the present day. While theorists at the time that Kant was writing\nwere prepared to consider the possibility that present-day species\nevolved out of earlier and more primitive forms of life\u2014and even\nout of mere matter as such\u2014they had no inkling of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory of natural selection, nor of Mendel\u2019s laws of\ninheritance. Moreover, it was widely assumed that living beings were\nmade of a different kind of matter from that found elsewhere in the\nuniverse; and while some biological theorists rejected this\n\u201cvitalist\u201d assumption there was, as yet, no experimental\nevidence against it. Kant himself follows Blumenbach in assuming a\ndistinctive kind of living matter which can be understood only in\nteleological terms. It might seem implausible, then, that Kant\u2019s\nviews could have any relevance to contemporary biological thought.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to think that contemporary biological\ntheory is no less committed to teleology than its eighteenth-century\ncounterpart, in particular through biologists\u2019 use of functional\nlanguage in their characterizations of the parts and behaviour of\norganisms. Kant can thus be seen as addressing a problem which is also\nof concern to present-day philosophers of biology: how to make sense\nof the idea that biological entities and processes can have purposes\nor functions without presupposing the existence of a divine designer.\nA number of interpreters have recently drawn on Kant to propose a\nsolution to the problem, although without necessarily agreeing on what\na Kantian solution amounts to. Examples of explicitly\n\u201cKantian\u201d approaches to teleology include ch. 3 of\nQuarfood 2004, Walsh 2006, A. Cohen 2007, Breitenbach 2009, and\nGinsborg 2014. McLaughlin\u2019s (2001) book on functional\nexplanation, while not explicitly proposing a Kantian approach, draws\non Kant at several points. A different suggestion regarding the\nrelevance of Kant\u2019s views to contemporary biology is offered by\nRoth (2014), who argues that Kant\u2019s anti-reductionism regarding\norganisms\u2014that they cannot be understood as composed out of\npre-existing parts\u2014offers a model for contemporary molecular\nbiology.\n\nThe view that Kant\u2019s theory is relevant to the contemporary\ndebate about biological functions is challenged forcefully in Zammito\n2006.\n",
