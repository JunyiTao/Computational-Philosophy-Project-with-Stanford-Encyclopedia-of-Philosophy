    "main_text": "Responses to the Paradox\n3. Responses to the Paradox\n\nAs with any paradox, four broad types of response appear to be\navailable. One might:\n\ndeny that logic applies to soritical expressions.\n\n\nAlternatively, one might accept that the paradox is a legitimate\nargument to which logic applies, but then deny its soundness by\neither\n\nrejecting some premise(s), or\ndenying that it\u2019s valid.\n\n\nThe most drastic response would be to\n\nembrace the paradox and conclude that vague terms are either\nincoherent or vacuous.\n\n\nIn what follows, we consider the major philosophical treatments of the\nsorites and the ways in which they have employed these strategies to\ndissolve the puzzle.\n",
