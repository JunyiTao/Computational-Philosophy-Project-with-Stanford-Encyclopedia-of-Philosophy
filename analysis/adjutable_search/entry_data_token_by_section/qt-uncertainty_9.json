    "main_text": "The Minimal Interpretation\n4. The Minimal Interpretation\n\nIn the previous two sections we have seen how both Heisenberg and Bohr\nattributed a far-reaching status to the uncertainty relations. They\nboth argued that these relations place fundamental limits on the\napplicability of the usual classical concepts. Moreover, they both\nbelieved that these limitations were inevitable and forced upon us.\nHowever, we have also seen that they reached such conclusions by\nstarting from radical and controversial assumptions. This entails, of\ncourse, that their radical conclusions remain unconvincing for those\nwho reject these assumptions. Indeed, the operationalist-positivist\nviewpoint adopted by these authors has long since lost its appeal\namong philosophers of physics.\n\nSo the question may be asked what alternative views of the uncertainty\nrelations are still viable. Of course, this problem is intimately\nconnected with that of the interpretation of the wave function, and\nhence of quantum mechanics as a whole. Since there is no consensus\nabout the latter, one cannot expect consensus about the interpretation\nof the uncertainty relations either. Here we only describe a point of\nview, which we call the \u201cminimal interpretation\u201d, that\nseems to be shared by both the adherents of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation and of other views.\n\nIn quantum mechanics a system is supposed to be described by its wave\nfunction, also called its quantum state or state vector. Given the\nstate vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), one can derive probability\ndistributions for all the physical quantities pertaining to the\nsystem, usually called its observables, such as its position,\nmomentum, angular momentum, energy, etc. The operational meaning of\nthese probability distributions is that they correspond to the\ndistribution of the values obtained for these quantities in a long\nseries of repetitions of the measurement. More precisely, one imagines\na great number of copies of the system under consideration, all\nprepared in the same way. On each copy the momentum, say, is measured.\nGenerally, the outcomes of these measurements differ and a\ndistribution of outcomes is obtained. The theoretical momentum\ndistribution derived from the quantum state is supposed to coincide\nwith the hypothetical distribution of outcomes obtained in an infinite\nseries of repetitions of the momentum measurement. The same holds,\nmutatis mutandis, for all the other physical quantities\npertaining to the system. Note that no simultaneous measurements of\ntwo or more quantities are required in defining the operational\nmeaning of the probability distributions.\n\nThe uncertainty relations discussed above can be considered as\nstatements about the spreads of the probability distributions of the\nseveral physical quantities arising from the same state. For example,\nthe uncertainty relation between the position and momentum of a system\nmay be understood as the statement that the position and momentum\ndistributions cannot both be arbitrarily narrow\u2014in some sense of\nthe word \u201cnarrow\u201d\u2014in any quantum state. Inequality\n (9)\n is an example of such a relation in which the standard deviation is\nemployed as a measure of spread. From this characterization of\nuncertainty relations follows that a more detailed interpretation of\nthe quantum state than the one given in the previous paragraph is not\nrequired to study uncertainty relations as such. In particular, a\nfurther ontological or linguistic interpretation of the notion of\nuncertainty, as limits on the applicability of our concepts given by\nHeisenberg or Bohr, need not be supposed.\n\nOf course, this minimal interpretation leaves the question open\nwhether it makes sense to attribute precise values of position and\nmomentum to an individual system. Some interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, e.g., those of Heisenberg and Bohr, deny this; while\nothers, e.g., the interpretation of de Broglie and Bohm insist that\neach individual system has a definite position and momentum (see the\nentry on\n Bohmian mechanics).\n The only requirement is that, as an empirical fact, it is not\npossible to prepare pure ensembles in which all systems have the same\nvalues for these quantities, or ensembles in which the spreads are\nsmaller than allowed by quantum theory. Although interpretations of\nquantum mechanics, in which each system has a definite value for its\nposition and momentum are still viable, this is not to say that they\nare without strange features of their own; they do not imply a return\nto classical physics.\n\nWe end with a few remarks on this minimal interpretation. First, it\nmay be noted that the minimal interpretation of the uncertainty\nrelations is little more than filling in the empirical meaning of\ninequality\n (9).\n As such, this view shares many of the limitations we have noted above\nabout this inequality. Indeed, it is not straightforward to relate the\nspread in a statistical distribution of measurement results with the\ninaccuracy of this measurement, such as, e.g., the resolving\npower of a microscope, or of a disturbance of the system by\nthe measurement. Moreover, the minimal interpretation does not address\nthe question whether one can make simultaneous accurate\nmeasurements of position and momentum.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one can show that the standard formalism of\nquantum mechanics does not allow such simultaneous measurements. But\nthis is not a consequence of relation\n (9).\n Rather, it follows from the fact that this formalism simply does not\ncontain any observable that would accomplish such a task. The\nextension of this formalism that allows observables to be represented\nby positive-operator-valued measures or POVM\u2019s, does allow the\nformal introduction of observables describing joint measurements (see\nalso\n section 6.1).\n But even here, for the case of position and momentum, one finds that\nsuch measurements have to be \u201cunsharp\u201d, which entails that\nthey cannot be regarded as simultaneous accurate measurements.\n\nIf one feels that statements about inaccuracy of measurement, or the\npossibility of simultaneous measurements, belong to any satisfactory\nformulation of the uncertainty principle, one will need to look for\nother formulations of the uncertainty principle. Some candidates for\nsuch formulations will be discussed in\n Section 6.\n First, however, we will look at formulations of the uncertainty\nprinciple that stay firmly within the minimal interpretation, and\ndiffer from\n (9)\n only by using measures of uncertainty other than the standard\ndeviation.\n",
