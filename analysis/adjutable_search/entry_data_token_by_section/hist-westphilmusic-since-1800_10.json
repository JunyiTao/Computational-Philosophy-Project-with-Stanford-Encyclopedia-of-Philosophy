In addition to the contributions of Langer and those of\nanalytic philosophers (see\n \u00a72.3\n and\n \u00a72.6),\n it is important to mention the views put forward by psychologist\nCarroll C. Pratt (1894\u20131979) and musicologists Leonard B. Meyer\n(1918\u20132007) and Deryck Cooke (1919\u20131976).\n\nPratt clarifies that he is not interested in music\u2019s arousal of\nemotions (Pratt 1954: 291\u2013292). We apply emotional words to\nmusic without implying that the music is arousing or may arouse such\nemotions in us or others. If this is the case, we need to explain why\nwe describe music, an inanimate object, using words that refer to\npsychological states.\n\nPratt argues that some dynamic qualities are common to both music and\nthe subjective experience of emotions. Thus, the agitation we hear in\nfast-paced, wayward music is an external, objective counterpart of the\nsubjective, internal sensation we experience when we feel agitated.\nThis correspondence between psychological states and perceptual\nfeatures of external objects is what grounds the description of the\nlatter in emotional terms. Pratt\u2019s view, conveyed in\nnuce by his slogan \u201cthe music sounds the way the emotions\nfeel\u201d, shares with Langer\u2019s theory the idea of an\nisomorphism between the structure of music and the phenomenology of\nemotional life. However, Pratt does not conceive of music as a sign of\nthe emotions, as their correspondence in terms of dynamic structure\ndoes not imply any representational relation from the former to the\nlatter (Pratt 1954: 290). This claim, along with Pratt\u2019s\nseparation of musical emotions from those it arouses in the listener,\ngives his view a clear formalist slant. The persuasiveness of\nPratt\u2019s hypothesis is ultimately dependent on whether we can\nproduce clearer evidence for the structural correspondence that is\ncentral to the account (criticism of Pratt\u2019s view is found in\nBudd 1985: chapter 3, and S. Davies 1994: chapter 3; Green [2007: 206]\nadvances a theory of expressiveness that partly vindicates\nPratt\u2019s intuition).\n\nMeyer\u2019s influential Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956)\nattempts to makes sense of musical emotions by holding that these\ndepend on the syntactical features of the music itself. Meyer\u2019s\nview rests on the questionable assumptions that emotions arise when a\ntendency to respond is inhibited. A tendency to respond is one\u2019s\ninclination to behave in a certain way. For instance, a smoker who\nfeels like smoking but is unable to find any cigarettes will feel\nincreasingly frustrated and upset. This person\u2019s emotion is\ngenerated by the inhibition of his tendency to respond (Meyer 1956:\n13\u201314; for criticism, see Budd 1985: 155\u2013157). In music, a\ntendency to respond is generated by the expectations that naturally\narise in more or less sophisticated listeners with regard to the\nsyntactic development of the piece. Music, and valuable music\nespecially, momentarily frustrates our expectations whenever it\ndevelops in unforeseen ways, and thereby arouses emotions without\nrequiring any reference to extra-musical reality.\n\nMeyer claims that his theory is able to reconcile two apparently\nopposite solutions to the problem of musical value and understanding.\nThese are the \u201cformalist option\u201d, according to which\nemotions are irrelevant to the appreciation of music, and the\n\u201cabsolute expressivist\u201d one, which holds music valuable\nfor the emotions it arouses in us. Meyer proposes that, if the\nexpectation is a conscious one, the response will be intellectual,\nrather than emotional. But if it is an unconscious expectation, as is\nthe case for most listeners, then its frustration will give rise to an\nemotional response. The formalist and the expressivist are thus two\ndifferent modes of engagement with music, as opposed to being\nincompatible views of its meaning and value (Meyer 1956:\n38\u201340).\n\nIn The Language of Music (1959), Cooke proposes that Western\nclassical composers have utilized an identifiable stock of melodic,\nharmonic, and rhythmic structures in order to convey emotion through\ntheir works. Cooke\u2019s model is linguistic not only in that it\nattempts to identify a vocabulary of musical expressiveness, but also\nbecause it conceives of music as a form of communication, and\nspecifically as the composer\u2019s communication of emotional states\nto the listener. It is thus a version of the expression theory (see\n \u00a71.1;\n Gabriel 1978 provides empirical evidence against Cooke\u2019s\nview).\n",
