    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues in Determinism || The way things are at a time t\n2.2 The way things are at a time t\n\nThe typical explication of determinism fastens on the state of the\n(whole) world at a particular time (or instant), for a variety of\nreasons. We will briefly explain some of them. Why take the state of\nthe whole world, rather than some (perhaps very large) region, as our\nstarting point? One might, intuitively, think that it would be enough\nto give the complete state of things on Earth, say, or\nperhaps in the whole solar system, at t, to fix what happens\nthereafter (for a time at least). But notice that all sorts of\ninfluences from outside the solar system come in at the speed of\nlight, and they may have important effects. Suppose Mary looks up at\nthe sky on a clear night, and a particularly bright blue star catches\nher eye; she thinks \u201cWhat a lovely star; I think I\u2019ll stay\noutside a bit longer and enjoy the view.\u201d The state of the solar\nsystem one month ago did not fix that that blue light from Sirius\nwould arrive and strike Mary\u2019s retina; it arrived into the solar\nsystem only a day ago, let\u2019s say. So evidently, for Mary\u2019s\nactions (and hence, all physical events generally) to be fixed by the\nstate of things a month ago, that state will have to be fixed over a\nmuch larger spatial region than just the solar system. (If no physical\ninfluences can go faster than light, then the state of things must be\ngiven over a spherical volume of space 1 light-month in radius.)\n\nBut in making vivid the \u201cthreat\u201d of determinism, we often\nwant to fasten on the idea of the entire future of the world\nas being determined. No matter what the \u201cspeed limit\u201d on\nphysical influences is, if we want the entire future of the world to\nbe determined, then we will have to fix the state of things over all\nof space, so as not to miss out something that could later come in\n\u201cfrom outside\u201d to spoil things. In the time of Laplace, of\ncourse, there was no known speed limit to the propagation of physical\nthings such as light-rays. In principle light could travel at any\narbitrarily high speed, and some thinkers did suppose that it was\ntransmitted \u201cinstantaneously.\u201d The same went for the force\nof gravity. In such a world, evidently, one has to fix the state of\nthings over the whole of the world at a time t, in\norder for events to be strictly determined, by the laws of nature, for\nany amount of time thereafter.\n\nIsmael (2016) has argued that even this is not enough to secure the\ndesired logical entailment of the full future: in addition, one must\nadd an \u201cand nothing else\u201d clause or premise, saying that\nin the (putatively) full description of the way things are\nat t, nothing has been left out that could interfere with the\nnatural time-evolution of the world-state. In the next section we will\nsee an example of such a thing that could be \u201cleft out\u201d of\nthe earlier description of the world.\n\nA final assumption may be worth mentioning here, that usually goes\nunremarked. It is assumed that the state of the world is completely\nsharp and determinate. That is, there is no mathematical or\nontological vagueness in the description of the way things are at time\nt. This assumption goes hand in hand with our usual tendency\nto think of the past as fully determinate and\n\u201cfixed\u201d. Without this assumption, in most theoretical\nframeworks mathematical predictability of future states would be\nimpossible.\n\nIn all this, we have been presupposing the common-sense Newtonian\nframework of space and time, in which the world-at-a-time is an\nobjective and meaningful notion. Below when we discuss determinism in\nrelativistic theories we will revisit this assumption.\n",
