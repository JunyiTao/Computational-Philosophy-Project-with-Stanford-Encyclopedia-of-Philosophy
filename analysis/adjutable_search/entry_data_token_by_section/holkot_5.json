    "main_text": "Necessity and Contingency || Historical context\n4.1 Historical context\n\nThe Condemnations of 1277 and John Duns Scotus impelled the view that\nthe world could be other than it is. The idea that God\u2019s\nomnipotent power provides him with an infinity of choices out of which\nhe chooses to create only one set of possibilities became a governing\nidea among subsequent English schoolmen. Scotus also argued forcefully\nfor the idea that each moment was open to contingent possibility, such\nthat for any time t, the events at t were possible not to be the\nevents at t. Contingency, traditionally assigned to the future, in\nScotus\u2019 view superseded or governed even the hypothetical\nnecessity of the present. Ockham retreated from Scotus\u2019 view,\nreassigning contingency to future events and reasserting the full\nforce of hypothetical necessity for events in the present. However,\nworking out the implications for philosophy and theology of a\ncontingent world order was the central intellectual challenge for\nHolkot\u2019s generation.\n",
