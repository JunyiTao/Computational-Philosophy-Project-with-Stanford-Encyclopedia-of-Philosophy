Human Freedom: Certainty without Necessity\n\n\nIn On Contingency, Leibniz remarks that \u201cthere are\ntwo labyrinths of the human mind, one concerning the composition of the\ncontinuum, and the other concerning the nature of freedom, and they\narise from the same source, infinity.\u201d (A VI iv 1654/AG 95)\nSomeone coming upon this passage for the first time might be puzzled by\nLeibniz's claim. Why, after all, should the labyrinth of\nthe nature of freedom be related to infinity? Given our\ndiscussion above concerning contingency and infinite analysis, the\nanswer should be relatively clear. \n\n\nLeibniz's account of modality opens the way for him to present a\ndistinctive kind of compatibilist theory of free will. For, according\nto Leibniz, Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon was a free act insofar as\nit spontaneously flowed from his own individual nature or was part of\nhis complete concept and insofar as it represented Caesar's choice of\nwhat he perceived to be the best option for him at the time. This\naction was not necessary \u2013 and therefore contingent\n\u2013 because its contrary (for example, staying in Gaul) does\nnot imply a contradiction. In saying that there is no contradiction,\nLeibniz means that either property or action \u2013 crossing the\nRubicon or remaining in Gaul \u2013 could co-exist within a complete\nset of properties of a Caesar. But as we saw above, there are\nsome properties that, were they changed, the individual would cease to\nbe. Thus, for example, it is a fair bet that Caesar was not free to\nbecome a trout. Put differently, we can say that, while Caesar crossed\nthe Rubicon in this world and thus began the Roman Civil\nWars, there is another possible world in which a Caesar\ndid not cross the Rubicon.  (Again, the\n\u201cexistence\u201d of the other possible world is meant only to\nimply that there is some set of compossible essences that include the\nCaesar-counterpart who does not cross the Rubicon.)\n\n\n\nLeibniz's conception of substance, according to which each\nindividual has a complete individual concept, still seems remarkably\nnecessitarian. After all, even predicates related to my\nfuture actions are now contained within my complete individual\nconcept. This smacks of determinism and raises in its own way the\nproblem of future contingents. As mentioned above, Leibniz claims\nthat we are free in part precisely because our actions follow from our\nvery natures with complete spontaneity. But also, according to\nLeibniz, God \u201cinclines our souls without necessitating\nthem.\u201d Indeed, in the Discourse on Metaphysics,\nLeibniz claims that the actions of an individual are certain\nbut not necessary. They are, Leibniz argues, certain ex\nhypothesi\u2014that is, they are certain given the creation or\ninstantiation of this particular world. God saw that Caesar would\ncross the Rubicon, that Judas would betray Christ, that Adam would sin,\nand so on; each of these acts and an infinity of others were included\nin each individual's complete concept; and yet God chose this\nworld in which such actions would certainly take place.\nBut, at the same time, since the contraries of any such actions do not\nimply contradictions, they are not necessary. God, in choosing a\npossible world, chooses all the essences of all the actual individuals,\neach of which has its program, according to which it acts spontaneously\nand freely. While it is still a program or a complete concept, on\nLeibniz's view, that does imply determination.\n\n",
