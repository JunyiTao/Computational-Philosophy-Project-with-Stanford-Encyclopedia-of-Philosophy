    "main_text": "What is contractualism?\n1. What is contractualism?\n\nScanlon introduces contractualism as a distinctive account of moral\nreasoning. He summarises his account thus:\n\nAn act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be\ndisallowed by any set of principles for the general regulation of\nbehaviour that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed,\nunforced, general agreement. (Scanlon 1998, p. 153).\n\n\nBut Scanlon\u2019s version of contractualism is not just concerned\nwith determining which acts are right and wrong. It is also concerned\nwith what reasons and forms of reasoning are justifiable. Whether or\nnot a principle is one that cannot be reasonably rejected is to be\nassessed by appeal to the implications of individuals or agents being\neither licensed or directed to reason in the way required by the\nprinciple. Scanlon\u2019s version offers an account both of (1) the\nauthority of moral standards and of (2) what constitutes rightness and\nwrongness. As to the first, the substantive value that is realised by\nmoral behaviour consists in a relation of \u201cmutual\nrecognition\u201d. As to the second, wrongness consists in\nunjustifiability: wrongness is the property of being\nunjustifiable. The wrongness of an action is not to be equated with\nthe properties that make it unjustifiable. Rather, it is to be equated\nwith its being unjustifiable; the character of wrongness is captured\nby the higher order fact that wrong acts are unjustifiable. What wrong\nacts have in common is that they cannot be justified to others. Thus\nthe various moral considerations that guide our substantive moral\nreflection are unified by a single normative subject matter. In this\nway, contractualism guides our substantive reflection about wrongness.\nWrong is the primary moral predicate; right is defined as \u201cnot\nwrong\u201d. One reason for focusing on wrong is to draw attention to\nthe domain that contractualism is concerned to map, concerning what it\nis for one person to have been wronged by another.\n\nMoral requirements determine what it is to respond properly to the\nvalue of persons as rational agents. The distinctive value of human\nlife lies in the human capacity to assess reasons and justifications.\nTherefore, appreciating the value of a person involves recognising her\ncapacity to appreciate and act on reasons. The way to value this\ncapacity is to treat persons in accord with principles they could not\nreasonably reject. In doing so, the agent is guided by a principle\nthat can rightly be characterised as one that the person herself\nauthorised that agent to be guided by, in thinking about the\nappropriate way to relate to her. Contractualism illuminates the\ncompelling Kantian insight that we ought to treat persons never as\nmere means but always as ends in themselves. It interprets this as\ntreating them according to principles they could not reasonably\nreject.\n",
