    "main_text": "Problems for Dualism || The Unity of the Mind\n5.2 The Unity of the Mind\n\n\nWhether one believes that the mind is a substance or just a bundle\nof properties, the same challenge arises, which is to explain the\nnature of the unity of the immaterial mind. For the Cartesian, that\nmeans explaining how he understands the notion of immaterial substance.\nFor the Humean, the issue is to explain the nature of the relationship\nbetween the different elements in the bundle that binds them into one\nthing. Neither tradition has been notably successful in this latter\ntask: indeed, Hume, in the appendix to the Treatise, declared\nhimself wholly mystified by the problem, rejecting his own initial\nsolution (though quite why is not clear from the text).\n5.2.1 Unity and Bundle Dualism\n\n\nIf the mind is only a bundle of properties, without a mental\nsubstance to unite them, then an account is needed of what constitutes\nits unity. The only route appears to be to postulate a primitive\nrelation of co-consciousness in which the various elements stand to\neach other.\n\n\nThere are two strategies which can be used to attack the bundle\ntheory. One is to claim that our intuitions favour belief in a subject\nand that the arguments presented in favour of the bundle alternative\nare unsuccessful, so the intuition stands. The other is to try to\nrefute the theory itself. Foster (1991, 212\u20139) takes the former path.\nThis is not effective against someone who thinks that metaphysical\neconomy gives a prima facie priority to bundle theories, on account of\ntheir avoiding mysterious substances.\n\n\nThe core objection to bundle theories (see, for example, Armstrong\n(1968), 21\u20133) is that, because it takes individual mental contents as\nits elements, such contents should be able to exist alone, as could the\nindividual bricks from a house. Hume accepted this consequence, but\nmost philosophers regard it as absurd. There could not be a mind that\nconsisted of a lone pain or red after-image, especially not of one that\nhad detached itself from the mind to which it had previously belonged.\nTherefore it makes more sense to think of mental contents as modes\nof a subject.\n\n\nBundle theorists tend to take phenomenal contents as the primary\nelements in their bundle. Thus the problem is how to relate, say, the\nvisual field to the auditory field, producing a \u2018unity of\napperception\u2019, that is, a total experience that seems to be\npresented to a single subject. Seeing the problem in this way has\nobvious Humean roots. This atomistic conception of the problem becomes\nless natural if one tries to accommodate other kinds of mental activity\nand contents. How are acts of conceptualising, attending to or willing\nwith respect to, such perceptual contents to be conceived? These kinds\nof mental acts seem to be less naturally treated as atomic elements in\na bundle, bound by a passive unity of apperception. William James\n(1890, vol. 1, 336\u201341) attempts to answer these problems. He claims to\nintrospect in himself a \u2018pulse of thought\u2019 for each present\nmoment, which he calls \u2018the Thought\u2019 and which is the\n\u2018vehicle of the judgement of identity\u2019 and the\n\u2018vehicle of choice as well as of cognition\u2019. These\n\u2018pulses\u2019 are united over time because each\n\u2018appropriates\u2019 the past Thoughts and \u2018makes us say\n\u201cas sure as I exist, those past facts were part of myself\u201d.\nJames attributes to these Thoughts acts of judging, attending, willing\netc, and this may seem incoherent in the absence of a genuine subject.\nBut there is also a tendency to treat many if not all aspects of agency\nas mere awareness of bodily actions or tendencies, which moves one back\ntowards a more normal Humean position. Whether James\u2019 position really\nimproves on Hume\u2019s, or merely mystifies it, is still a moot point. (But\nsee Sprigge (1993), 84\u201397, for an excellent, sympathetic\ndiscussion.)\n5.2.2 Unity and Substance Dualism\n\n\nThe problem is to explain what kind of a thing an immaterial\nsubstance is, such that its presence explains the unity of the mind.\nThe answers given can be divided into three kinds.\n\n\n(a) The \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 account: The view that immaterial\nsubstance is a kind of immaterial stuff. There are two problems with\nthis approach. First, in so far as this \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 has any\ncharacterisation as a \u2018stuff\u2019 \u2013 that is, a structure\nof its own over and above the explicitly mental properties that it\nsustains \u2013 it leaves it as much a mystery why this kind\nof stuff should support consciousness as it is why ordinary matter\nshould. Second, and connectedly, it is not clear in what sense such\nstuff is immaterial, except in the sense that it cannot be integrated\ninto the normal scientific account of the physical world. Why is it not\njust an aberrant kind of physical stuff?\n\n\n(b) The \u2018consciousness\u2019 account: The view that consciousness is the\nsubstance. Account (a) allowed the immaterial substance to have a\nnature over and above the kinds of state we would regard as mental. The\nconsciousness account does not. This is Descartes\u2019 view. The most\nobvious objection to this theory is that it does not allow the subject\nto exist when unconscious. This forces one to take one of four possible\ntheories. One could claim (i) that we are conscious when we do not seem\nto be (which was Descartes\u2019 view): or (ii) that we exist\nintermittently, though are still the same thing (which is Swinburne\u2019s\ntheory, (1997), 179): or (iii) that each of us consists of a series of\nsubstances, changed at any break in consciousness, which pushes one\ntowards a constructivist account of identity through time and so\ntowards the spirit of the bundle theory: or (iv) even more\nspeculatively, that the self stands in such a relation to the normal\ntime series that its own continued existence is not brought into\nquestion by its failure to be present in time at those moments when it\nis not conscious within that series (Robinson, forthcoming).\n\n\n(c) The \u2018no-analysis\u2019 account: The view that it is a mistake to\npresent any analysis. This is Foster\u2019s view, though I think Vendler\n(1984) and Madell (1981) have similar positions. Foster argues that\neven the \u2018consciousness\u2019 account is an attempt to explain\nwhat the immaterial self is \u2018made of\u2019 which assimilates it\ntoo far towards a kind of physical substance. In other words, Descartes\nhas only half escaped from the \u2018ectoplasmic\u2019 model. (He\nhas half escaped because he does not attribute non-mental\nproperties to the self, but he is still captured by trying to explain\nwhat it is made of.)\n\n\nFoster (1991) expresses it as follows:\n\u2026it seems to me that when I focus on myself\nintrospectively, I am not only aware of being in a certain mental\ncondition; I am also aware, with the same kind of immediacy, of being a\ncertain sort of thing\u2026 \n\n\n\nIt will now be asked: \u2018Well, what is this nature,\nthis sortal attribute? Let\u2019s have it specified!\u2019 But such a\ndemand is misconceived. Of course, I can give it a verbal label: for\ninstance, I can call it \u2018subjectness\u2019 or\n\u2018selfhood\u2019. But unless they are interpreted\n\u2018ostensively\u2019, by reference to what is revealed by\nintrospective awareness, such labels will not convey anything over and\nabove the nominal essence of the term \u2018basic subject\u2019. In\nthis respect, however, there is no difference between this attribute,\nwhich constitutes the subject\u2019s essential nature, and the specific\npsychological attributes of his conscious life\u2026\n\n\nAdmittedly, the feeling that there must be more to be said from a\nGod\u2019s eye view dies hard. The reason is that, even when we have\nacknowledged that basic subjects are wholly non-physical, we still tend\nto approach the issue of their essential natures in the shadow of the\nphysical paradigm. (243\u20135)\n\n\n\nBerkeley\u2019s concept of notion again helps here. One can\ninterpret Berkeley as implying that there is more to the self than\nintrospection can capture, or we can interpret him as saying that\nnotions, though presenting stranger entities than ideas,\ncapture them just as totally. The latter is the \u2018no account is\nneeded\u2019 view.",
