Paradoxes Lost?\n\nModern physics strips away many aspects of the manifest image of time.\nTime as it appears in the equations of classical mechanics has no need\nfor a distinguished present moment, for example. Relativity theory\nleads to even sharper contrasts. It replaces absolute simultaneity,\naccording to which it is possible to unambiguously determine the time\norder of distant events, with relative simultaneity: extending an\n\u201cinstant of time\u201d throughout space is not unique, but\ndepends on the state of motion of an observer. More dramatically, in\ngeneral relativity the mathematical properties of time (or better, of\nspacetime)\u2014its topology and geometry\u2014depend upon how\nmatter is arranged rather than being fixed once and for all. So\nphysics can be, and indeed has to be, formulated without treating time\nas a universal, fixed background structure. Since general relativity\nrepresents gravity through spacetime geometry, the allowed geometries\nmust be as varied as the ways in which matter can be arranged.\nAlongside geometrical models used to describe the solar system, black\nholes, and much else, the scope of variation extends to include some\nexotic structures unlike anything astrophysicists have observed. In\nparticular, there are spacetime geometries with curves that loop back\non themselves: closed timelike curves (CTCs), which describe the\npossible trajectory of an observer who returns exactly back to their\nearlier state\u2014without any funny business, such as going faster\nthan the speed of light. These geometries satisfy the relevant\nphysical laws, the equations of general relativity, and in that sense\ntime travel is physically possible.\n\nYet circular time generates paradoxes, familiar from science fiction\nstories featuring time\n travel:[1]\n\nConsistency: Kurt plans to murder his own grandfather\nAdolph, by traveling along a CTC to an appropriate moment in the past.\nHe is an able marksman, and waits until he has a clear shot at\ngrandpa. Normally he would not miss. Yet if he succeeds, there is no\nway that he will then exist to plan and carry out the mission. Kurt\npulls the trigger: what can happen?\nUnderdetermination: Suppose that Kurt first travels back\nin order to give his earlier self a copy of How to Build a Time\nMachine. This is the same book that allows him to build a time\nmachine, which he then carries with him on his journey to the past.\nWho wrote the book?\nEasy Knowledge: A fan of classical music enhances their\ncomputer with a circuit that exploits a CTC. This machine efficiently\nsolves problems at a higher level of computational complexity than\nconventional computers, leading (among other things) to finding the\nsmallest circuits that can generate Bach\u2019s oeuvre\u2014and to\ncompose new pieces in the same style. Such easy knowledge is at odds\nwith our understanding of our epistemic predicament. (This third\nparadox has not drawn as much attention.)\n\n\nThe first two paradoxes were once routinely taken to show that\nsolutions with CTCs should be rejected\u2014with charges varying from\nviolating logic, to being \u201cphysically unreasonable\u201d, to\nundermining the notion of free will. Closer analysis of the paradoxes\nhas largely reversed this consensus. Physicists have discovered many\nsolutions with CTCs and have explored their properties in pursuing\nfoundational questions, such as whether physics is compatible with the\nidea of objective temporal passage (starting with G\u00f6del 1949).\nPhilosophers have also used time travel scenarios to probe questions\nabout, among other things, causation, modality, free will, and\nidentity (see, e.g., Earman 1972 and\u00a0Lewis\u2019s seminal 1976\npaper).\n\nWe begin below with Consistency, turning to the other\nparadoxes in later sections. A standard, stone-walling response is to\ninsist that the past cannot be changed, as a matter of logic, even by\na time traveler (e.g., G\u00f6del 1949,\u00a0Clarke 1977, Horwich\n1987). Adolph cannot both die and survive, as a matter of logic, so\nany scheme to alter the past must fail. In many of the best time\ntravel fictions, the actions of a time traveler are constrained in\nnovel and unexpected ways. Attempts to change the past fail, and they\nfail, often tragically, in just such a way that they set the stage for\nthe time traveler\u2019s self-defeating journey. The first question\nis whether there is an analog of the consistent story when it comes to\nphysics in the presence of CTCs. As we will see, there is a remarkable\ngeneral argument establishing the existence of consistent solutions.\nYet a second question persists: why can\u2019t time-traveling Kurt\nkill his own grandfather? Doesn\u2019t the necessity of failures to\nchange the past put unusual and unexpected constraints on time\ntravelers, or objects that move along CTCs? The same argument shows\nthat there are in fact no constraints imposed by the existence of\nCTCs, in some cases. After discussing this line of argument, we will\nturn to the palatability and further implications of such constraints\nif they are required, and then turn to the implications of quantum\nmechanics.\n2. Topology and Constraints\n\nWheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact that\nnature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences\nfrom later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time\ntravel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.\nMaudlin (1990) showed how to make their argument precise and more\ngeneral, and argued that nonetheless it was not completely\ngeneral.\n\nImagine the following set-up. We start off having a camera with a\nblack and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of\nthe time machine. An object, in fact a developed film, comes out of\nthe time machine. We photograph it, and develop the film. The\ndeveloped film is subsequently put in the time machine, and set to\ncome out of the time machine at the time the picture is taken. This\nsurely will create a paradox: the developed film will have the\nopposite distribution of black, white, and shades of gray, from the\nobject that comes out of the time machine. For developed black and\nwhite films (i.e., negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from\nthe objects they are pictures of. But since the object that comes out\nof the time machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a\nparadox.\n\nHowever, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no\nparadox here. What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will\nemerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same\nuniform shade of gray. No matter what the sensitivity of the film is,\nas long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film\ndepends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being\nphotographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed,\nwill produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film.\nThis is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s idea. Let us first\nbe a bit more precise and then a bit more general.\n\nFor simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform shade\nof gray (i.e., at any time the shade of gray does not vary by location\non the film). The possible shades of gray of the film can then be\nrepresented by the (real) numbers from 0, representing pure black, to\n1, representing pure white.\n\nLet us now distinguish various stages in the chronological order of\nthe life of the film. In stage \\(S_1\\) the film is young; it has just\nbeen placed in the camera and is ready to be exposed. It is then\nexposed to the object that comes out of the time machine. (That object\nin fact is a later stage of the film itself). By the time we come to\nstage \\(S_2\\) of the life of the film, it has been developed and is\nabout to enter the time machine. Stage \\(S_3\\) occurs just after it\nexits the time machine and just before it is photographed. Stage\n\\(S_4\\) occurs after it has been photographed and before it starts\nfading away. Let us assume that the film starts out in stage \\(S_1\\)\nin some uniform shade of gray, and that the only significant change in\nthe shade of gray of the film occurs between stages \\(S_1\\) and\n\\(S_2\\). During that period it acquires a shade of gray that depends\non the shade of gray of the object that was photographed. In other\nwords, the shade of gray that the film acquires at stage \\(S_2\\)\ndepends on the shade of gray it has at stage \\(S_3\\). The influence of\nthe shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_3\\), on the shade of gray\nof the film at stage \\(S_2\\), can be represented as a mapping, or\nfunction, from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), to the\nreal numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Let us suppose that the\nprocess of photography is such that if one imagines varying the shade\nof gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner then the shade of\ngray of the developed picture of that object will also vary in a\nsmooth, continuous manner. This implies that the function in question\nwill be a continuous function. Now any continuous function from the\nreal numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real numbers between 0\nand 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to itself. One can\nquickly convince oneself of this by graphing such functions. For one\nwill quickly see that any continuous function \\(f\\) from \\([0,1]\\) to\n\\([0,1]\\) must intersect the line \\(x=y\\) somewhere, and thus there\nmust be at least one point \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\). Such points are\ncalled fixed points of the function. Now let us think about what such\na fixed point represents. It represents a shade of gray such that,\nwhen photographed, it will produce a developed film with exactly that\nsame shade of gray. The existence of such a fixed point implies a\nsolution to the apparent paradox.\n\nLet us now be more general and allow color photography. One can\nrepresent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the\nproportions of blue, green and red that make up that color. (This is\nwhy television screens can produce all possible colors.) Thus one can\nrepresent all possible colors of an object by three points on three\northogonal lines \\(x, y\\) and \\(z\\), that is to say, by a point in a\nthree-dimensional cube. This cube is also known as the\n\u201cCartesian product\u201d of the three line segments. Now, one\ncan also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must\nhave at least one fixed point. So color photography can not be used to\ncreate time travel paradoxes either!\n\nEven more generally, consider some system \\(P\\) which, as in the above\nexample, has the following life. It starts in some state \\(S_1\\), it\ninteracts with an object that comes out of a time machine (which\nhappens to be its older self), it travels back in time, it interacts\nwith some object (which happens to be its younger self), and finally\nit grows old and dies. Let us assume that the set of possible states\nof \\(P\\) can be represented by a Cartesian product of \\(n\\) closed\nintervals of the reals, i.e., let us assume that the topology of the\nstate-space of \\(P\\) is isomorphic to a finite Cartesian product of\nclosed intervals of the reals. Let us further assume that the\ndevelopment of \\(P\\) in time, and the dependence of that development\non the state of objects that it interacts with, is continuous. Then,\nby a well-known fixed point theorem in topology (see, e.g., Hocking\n& Young 1961: 273), no matter what the nature of the interaction\nis, and no matter what the initial state of the object is, there will\nbe at least one state \\(S_3\\) of the older system (as it emerges from\nthe time travel machine) that will influence the initial state \\(S_1\\)\nof the younger system (when it encounters the older system) so that,\nas the younger system becomes older, it develops exactly into state\n\\(S_3\\). Thus without imposing any constraints on the initial state\n\\(S_1\\) of the system \\(P\\), we have shown that there will always be\nperfectly ordinary, non-paradoxical, solutions, in which everything\nthat happens, happens according to the usual laws of development. Of\ncourse, there is looped causation, hence presumably also looped\nexplanation, but what do you expect if there is looped time?\n\nUnfortunately, for the fan of time travel, a little reflection\nsuggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point\ntheorem does not hold. Imagine, for instance, that we have a dial that\ncan only rotate in a plane. We are going to put the dial in the time\nmachine. Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the\ndial come out of the time machine set at angle \\(x\\), then we will set\nthe dial to \\(x+90\\), and throw it into the time machine. Now it seems\nwe have a paradox, since the mapping that consists of a rotation of\nall points in a circular state-space by 90 degrees does not have a\nfixed point. And why wouldn\u2019t some state-spaces have the\ntopology of a circle?\n\nHowever, we have so far not used another continuity assumption which\nis also a reasonable assumption. So far we have only made the\nfollowing demand: the state the dial is in at stage \\(S_2\\) must be a\ncontinuous function of the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\). But,\nthe state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\) is arrived at by taking the\nstate of the dial at stage \\(S_1\\), and rotating it over some angle.\nIt is not merely the case that the effect of the interaction, namely\nthe state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\), should be a continuous\nfunction of the cause, namely the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\).\nIt is additionally the case that path taken to get there, the way the\ndial is rotated between stages \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) must be a\ncontinuous function of the state at stage \\(S_3\\). And, rather\nsurprisingly, it turns out that this can not be done. Let us\nillustrate what the problem is before going to a more general\ndemonstration that there must be a fixed point solution in the dial\ncase.\n\nForget time travel for the moment. Suppose that you and I each have a\nwatch with a single dial neither of which is running. My watch is set\nat 12. You are going to announce what your watch is set at. My task is\ngoing to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement\nyou make. And my actions should have a continuous (single valued)\ndependence on the time that you announce. Surprisingly, this is not\npossible! For instance, suppose that if you announce \u201c12\u201d,\nthen I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing. Now imagine\nslowly and continuously increasing the announced times, starting at\n12. By continuity, I must achieve each of those settings by rotating\nmy dial to the right. If at some point I switch and achieve the\nannounced goal by a rotation of my dial to the left, I will have\nintroduced a discontinuity in my actions, a discontinuity in the\nactions that I take as a function of the announced angle. So I will be\nforced, by continuity, to achieve every announcement by rotating the\ndial to the right. But, this rotation to the right will have to be\nabruptly discontinued as the announcements grow larger and I\neventually approach 12 again, since I achieved 12 by not rotating the\ndial at all. So, there will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest. In\ngeneral, continuity of my actions as a function of announced times can\nnot be maintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all\npossible settings. Another way to see the problem is that one can\nsimilarly reason that, as one starts with 12, and imagines\ncontinuously making the announced times earlier, one will be forced,\nby continuity, to achieve the announced times by rotating the dial to\nthe left. But the conclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous\nincreases and the assumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent.\nSo we have an inconsistency following from the assumption of\ncontinuity and the assumption that I always manage to set my watch to\nyour watch. So, a dial developing according to a continuous dynamics\nfrom a given initial state, can not be set up so as to react to a\nsecond dial, with which it interacts, in such a way that it is\nguaranteed to always end up set at the same angle as the second dial.\nSimilarly, it can not be set up so that it is guaranteed to always end\nup set at 90 degrees to the setting of the second dial. All of this\nhas nothing to do with time travel. However, the impossibility of such\nset ups is what prevents us from enacting the rotation by 90 degrees\nthat would create paradox in the time travel setting.\n\nLet us now give the positive result that with such dials there will\nalways be fixed point solutions, as long as the dynamics is\ncontinuous. Let us call the state of the dial before it interacts with\nits older self the initial state of the dial. And let us call the\nstate of the dial after it emerges from the time machine the final\nstate of the dial. There is also an intermediate state of the dial,\nafter it interacts with its older self and before it is put into the\ntime machine. We can represent the initial or intermediate states of\nthe dial, before it goes into the time machine, as an angle \\(x\\) in\nthe horizontal plane and the final state of the dial, after it comes\nout of the time machine, as an angle \\(y\\) in the vertical plane. All\npossible \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) pairs can thus be visualized as a\ntorus with each \\(x\\) value picking out a vertical circular\ncross-section and each \\(y\\) picking out a point on that\ncross-section. See\n figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nSuppose that the dial starts at angle \\(i\\) which picks out vertical\ncircle \\(I\\) on the torus. The initial angle \\(i\\) that the dial is at\nbefore it encounters its older self, and the set of all possible final\nangles that the dial can have when it emerges from the time machine is\nrepresented by the circle \\(I\\) on the torus (see\n figure 1).\n Given any possible angle of the emerging dial, the dial initially at\nangle \\(i\\) will develop to some other angle. One can picture this\ndevelopment by rotating each point on \\(I\\) in the horizontal\ndirection by the relevant amount. Since the rotation has to depend\ncontinuously on the angle of the emerging dial, circle \\(I\\) during\nthis development will deform into some loop \\(L\\) on the torus. Loop\n\\(L\\) thus represents all possible intermediate angles \\(x\\) that the\ndial is at when it is thrown into the time machine, given that it\nstarted at angle \\(i\\) and then encountered a dial (its older self)\nwhich was at angle \\(y\\) when it emerged from the time machine. We\ntherefore have consistency if \\(x=y\\) for some \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on loop\n\\(L\\). Now, let loop \\(C\\) be the loop which consists of all the\npoints on the torus for which \\(x=y\\). Ring \\(I\\) intersects \\(C\\) at\npoint \\(\\langle i,i\\rangle\\). Obviously any continuous deformation of\n\\(I\\) must still intersect \\(C\\) somewhere. So \\(L\\) must intersect\n\\(C\\) somewhere, say at \\(\\langle j,j\\rangle\\). But that means that no\nmatter how the development of the dial starting at \\(I\\) depends on\nthe angle of the emerging dial, there will be some angle for the\nemerging dial such that the dial will develop exactly into that angle\n(by the time it enters the time machine) under the influence of that\nemerging dial. This is so no matter what angle one starts with, and no\nmatter how the development depends on the angle of the emerging dial.\nThus even for a circular state-space there are no constraints needed\nother than continuity.\n\nUnfortunately there are state-spaces that escape even this argument.\nConsider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between\n0 and 1, where 0 and 1 are not possible values. That is, suppose that\nwe have a state-space that is isomorphic to an open set of real\nnumbers. Now suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to\nhalf the value that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the\ntime machine.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nSuppose the pointer starts at value \\(I\\). As before we can represent\nthe combination of this initial position and all possible final\npositions by the line \\(I\\). Under the influence of the pointer coming\nout of the time machine the pointer value will develop to a value that\nequals half the value of the final value that it encountered. We can\nrepresent this development as the continuous deformation of line \\(I\\)\ninto line \\(L\\), which is indicated by the arrows in\n figure 2.\n This development is fully continuous. Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\)\non line \\(I\\) represent the initial position \\(x=I\\) of the (young)\npointer, and the position \\(y\\) of the older pointer as it emerges\nfrom the time machine. Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(L\\)\nrepresent the position \\(x\\) that the younger pointer should develop\ninto, given that it encountered the older pointer emerging from the\ntime machine set at position \\(y\\). Since the pointer is designed to\ndevelop to half the value of the pointer that it encounters, the line\n\\(L\\) corresponds to \\(x=1/2 y\\). We have consistency if there is some\npoint such that it develops into that point, if it encounters that\npoint. Thus, we have consistency if there is some point \\(\\langle\nx,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(L\\) such that \\(x=y\\). However, there is no\nsuch point: lines \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) do not intersect. Thus there is no\nconsistent solution, despite the fact that the dynamics is fully\ncontinuous.\n\nOf course if 0 were a possible value, \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) would intersect\nat 0. This is surprising and strange: adding one point to the set of\npossible values of a quantity here makes the difference between\nparadox and peace. One might be tempted to just add the extra point to\nthe state-space in order to avoid problems. After all, one might say,\nsurely no measurements could ever tell us whether the set of possible\nvalues includes that exact point or not. Unfortunately there can be\ngood theoretical reasons for supposing that some quantity has a\nstate-space that is open: the set of all possible speeds of massive\nobjects in special relativity surely is an open set, since it includes\nall speeds up to, but not including, the speed of light. Quantities\nthat have possible values that are not bounded also lead to counter\nexamples to the presented fixed point argument. And it is not obvious\nto us why one should exclude such possibilities. So the argument that\nno constraints are needed is not fully general.\n\nAn interesting question of course is: exactly for which state-spaces\nmust there be such fixed points? The arguments above depend on a\nwell-known fixed point theorem (due to Schauder) that guarantees the\nexistence of a fixed point for compact, convex state spaces. We do not\nknow what subsequent extensions of this result imply regarding fixed\npoints for a wider variety of systems, or whether there are other\ngeneral results along these lines. (See Kutach 2003 for more on this\nissue.)\n\nA further interesting question is whether this line of argument is\nsufficient to resolve Consistency (see also Dowe 2007). When\nthey apply, these results establish the existence of a solution, such\nas the shade of uniform gray in the first example. But physicists\nroutinely demand more than merely the existence of a solution, namely\nthat solutions to the equations are stable\u2014such that\n\u201csmall\u201d changes of the initial state lead to\n\u201csmall\u201d changes of the resulting trajectory. (Clarifying\nthe two senses of \u201csmall\u201d in this statement requires\nfurther work, specifying the relevant topology.) Stability in this\nsense underwrites the possibility of applying equations to real\nsystems given our inability to fix initial states with indefinite\nprecision. (See Fletcher 2020 for further discussion.) The fixed point\ntheorems guarantee that for an initial state \\(S_1\\) there is a\nsolution, but this solution may not be \u201cclose\u201d to the\nsolution for a nearby initial state, \\(S'\\). We are not aware of any\nproofs that the solutions guaranteed to exist by the fixed point\ntheorems are also stable in this sense.\n3. The General Possibility of Time Travel in General Relativity\n\nTime travel has recently been discussed quite extensively in the\ncontext of general relativity. General relativity places few\nconstraints on the global structure of space and time. This\nflexibility leads to a possibility first described in print by Hermann\nWeyl:\n\n\nEvery world-point is the origin of the double-cone of the active\nfuture and the passive past [i.e., the two lobes of the light cone].\nWhereas in the special theory of relativity these two portions are\nseparated by an intervening region, it is certainly possible in the\npresent case [i.e., general relativity] for the cone of the active\nfuture to overlap with that of the passive past; so that, in\nprinciple, it is possible to experience events now that will in part\nbe an effect of my future resolves and actions. Moreover, it is not\nimpossible for a world-line (in particular, that of my body), although\nit has a timelike direction at every point, to return to the\nneighborhood of a point which it has already once passed through.\n(Weyl 1918/1920 [1952: 274])\n\n\nA time-like curve is simply a space-time trajectory such that the\nspeed of light is never equaled or exceeded along this trajectory.\nTime-like curves represent possible trajectories of ordinary objects.\nIn general relativity a curve that is everywhere timelike locally can\nnonetheless loop back on itself, forming a CTC. Weyl makes the point\nvividly in terms of the light cones: along such a curve, the future\nlobe of the light cone (the \u201cactive future\u201d) intersects\nthe past lobe of the light cone (the \u201cpassive past\u201d).\nTraveling along such a curve one would never exceed the speed of\nlight, and yet after a certain amount of (proper) time one would\nreturn to a point in space-time that one previously visited. Or, by\nstaying close to such a CTC, one could come arbitrarily close to a\npoint in space-time that one previously visited. General relativity,\nin a straightforward sense, allows time travel: there appear to be\nmany space-times compatible with the fundamental equations of general\nrelativity in which there are CTC\u2019s. Space-time, for instance,\ncould have a Minkowski metric everywhere, and yet have CTC\u2019s\neverywhere by having the temporal dimension (topologically) rolled up\nas a circle. Or, one can have wormhole connections between different\nparts of space-time which allow one to enter \u201cmouth \\(A\\)\u201d\nof such a wormhole connection, travel through the wormhole, exit the\nwormhole at \u201cmouth \\(B\\)\u201d and re-enter \u201cmouth\n\\(A\\)\u201d again. CTCs can even arise when the spacetime is\ntopologically \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\), due to the \u201ctilting\u201d of\nlight cones produced by rotating matter (as in G\u00f6del 1949\u2019s\nspacetime).\n\nGeneral relativity thus appears to provide ample opportunity for time\ntravel. Note that just because there are CTC\u2019s in a space-time,\nthis does not mean that one can get from any point in the space-time\nto any other point by following some future directed timelike\ncurve\u2014there may be insurmountable practical obstacles. In\nG\u00f6del\u2019s spacetime, it is the case that there are CTCs\npassing through every point in the spacetime. Yet these CTCs are not\ngeodesics, so traversing them requires acceleration. Calculations of\nthe minimal fuel required to travel along the appropriate curve should\ndiscourage any would-be time travelers (Malament 1984, 1985; Manchak\n2011). But more generally CTCs may be confined to smaller regions;\nsome parts of space-time can have CTC\u2019s while other parts do\nnot. Let us call the part of a space-time that has CTC\u2019s the\n\u201ctime travel region\u201d of that space-time, while calling the\nrest of that space-time the \u201cnormal region\u201d. More\nprecisely, the \u201ctime travel region\u201d consists of all the\nspace-time points \\(p\\) such that there exists a (non-zero length)\ntimelike curve that starts at \\(p\\) and returns to \\(p\\). Now let us\nturn to examining space-times with CTC\u2019s a bit more closely for\npotential problems.\n4. Two Toy Models\n\nIn order to get a feeling for the sorts of implications that closed\ntimelike curves can have, it may be useful to consider two simple\nmodels. In space-times with closed timelike curves the traditional\ninitial value problem cannot be framed in the usual way. For it\npresupposes the existence of Cauchy surfaces, and if there are CTCs\nthen no Cauchy surface exists. (A Cauchy surface is a spacelike\nsurface such that every inextendable timelike curve crosses it exactly\nonce. One normally specifies initial conditions by giving the\nconditions on such a surface.) Nonetheless, if the topological\ncomplexities of the manifold are appropriately localized, we can come\nquite close. Let us call an edgeless spacelike surface \\(S\\) a\nquasi-Cauchy surface if it divides the rest of the manifold\ninto two parts such that\n\nevery point in the manifold can be connected by a timelike curve\nto \\(S\\), and\nany timelike curve which connects a point in one region to a point\nin the other region intersects \\(S\\) exactly once.\n\n\nIt is obvious that a quasi-Cauchy surface must entirely inhabit the\nnormal region of the space-time; if any point \\(p\\) of \\(S\\) is in the\ntime travel region, then any timelike curve which intersects \\(p\\) can\nbe extended to a timelike curve which intersects \\(S\\) near \\(p\\)\nagain. In extreme cases of time travel, a model may have no normal\nregion at all (e.g., Minkowski space-time rolled up like a cylinder in\na time-like direction), in which case our usual notions of temporal\nprecedence will not apply. But temporal anomalies like wormholes (and\ntime machines) can be sufficiently localized to permit the existence\nof quasi-Cauchy surfaces.\n\nGiven a timelike orientation, a quasi-Cauchy surface unproblematically\ndivides the manifold into its past (i.e., all points that can\nbe reached by past-directed timelike curves from \\(S)\\) and its\nfuture (ditto mutatis mutandis). If the whole past\nof \\(S\\) is in the normal region of the manifold, then \\(S\\) is a\npartial Cauchy surface: every inextendable timelike curve\nwhich exists to the past of \\(S\\) intersects \\(S\\) exactly once, but\n(if there is time travel in the future) not every inextendable\ntimelike curve which exists to the future of \\(S\\) intersects \\(S\\).\nNow we can ask a particularly clear question: consider a manifold\nwhich contains a time travel region, but also has a partial Cauchy\nsurface \\(S\\), such that all of the temporal funny business is to the\nfuture of \\(S\\). If all you could see were \\(S\\) and its past, you\nwould not know that the space-time had any time travel at all. The\nquestion is: are there any constraints on the sort of data which can\nbe put on \\(S\\) and continued to a global solution of the dynamics\nwhich are different from the constraints (if any) on the data which\ncan be put on a Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and\ncontinued to a global solution? If there is time travel to our future,\nmight we we able to tell this now, because of some implied oddity in\nthe arrangement of present things?\n\nIt is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the\ndata which can be put on a locally space-like surface which passes\nthrough the time travel region: after all, we never think we can\nfreely specify what happens on a space-like surface and on another\nsuch surface to its future, but in this case the surface at issue lies\nto its own future. But if there were particular constraints for data\non a partial Cauchy surface then we would apparently need to have to\nrule out some sorts of otherwise acceptable states on \\(S\\) if there\nis to be time travel to the future of \\(S\\). We then might be able to\nestablish that there will be no time travel in the future by simple\ninspection of the present state of the universe. As we will see, there\nis reason to suspect that such constraints on the partial Cauchy\nsurface are non-generic. But we are getting ahead of ourselves: first\nlet\u2019s consider the effect of time travel on a very simple\ndynamics.\n\nThe simplest possible example is the Newtonian theory of perfectly\nelastic collisions among equally massive particles in one spatial\ndimension. The space-time is two-dimensional, so we can represent it\ninitially as the Euclidean plane, and the dynamics is completely\nspecified by two conditions. When particles are traveling freely,\ntheir world lines are straight lines in the space-time, and when two\nparticles collide, they exchange momenta, so the collision looks like\nan \u201c\\(X\\)\u201d in space-time, with each particle changing its\nmomentum at the\n impact.[2]\n The dynamics is purely local, in that one can check that a set of\nworld-lines constitutes a model of the dynamics by checking that the\ndynamics is obeyed in every arbitrarily small region. It is also\ntrivial to generate solutions from arbitrary initial data if there are\nno CTCs: given the initial positions and momenta of a set of\nparticles, one simply draws a straight line from each particle in the\nappropriate direction and continues it indefinitely. Once all the\nlines are drawn, the worldline of each particle can be traced from\ncollision to collision. The boundary value problem for this dynamics\nis obviously well-posed: any set of data at an instant yields a unique\nglobal solution, constructed by the method sketched above.\n\nWhat happens if we change the topology of the space-time by hand to\nproduce CTCs? The simplest way to do this is depicted in\n figure 3:\n we cut and paste the space-time so it is no longer simply connected\nby identifying the line \\(L-\\) with the line \\(L+\\). Particles\n\u201cgoing in\u201d to \\(L+\\) from below \u201cemerge\u201d from\n\\(L-\\) , and particles \u201cgoing in\u201d to \\(L-\\) from below\n\u201cemerge\u201d from \\(L+\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Inserting CTCs by Cut and\nPaste. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHow is the boundary-value problem changed by this alteration in the\nspace-time? Before the cut and paste, we can put arbitrary data on the\nsimultaneity slice \\(S\\) and continue it to a unique solution. After\nthe change in topology, \\(S\\) is no longer a Cauchy surface, since a\nCTC will never intersect it, but it is a partial Cauchy surface. So we\ncan ask two questions. First, can arbitrary data on \\(S\\) always be\ncontinued to a global solution? Second, is that solution unique? If\nthe answer to the first question is \\(no\\), then we have a\nbackward-temporal constraint: the existence of the region with CTCs\nplaces constraints on what can happen on \\(S\\) even though that region\nlies completely to the future of \\(S\\). If the answer to the second\nquestion is \\(no\\), then we have an odd sort of indeterminism,\nanalogous to the unwritten book: the complete physical state on \\(S\\)\ndoes not determine the physical state in the future, even though the\nlocal dynamics is perfectly deterministic and even though there is no\nother past edge to the space-time region in \\(S\\)\u2019s future\n(i.e., there is nowhere else for boundary values to come from\nwhich could influence the state of the region).\n\nIn this case the answer to the first question is yes and to\nthe second is no: there are no constraints on the data which\ncan be put on \\(S\\), but those data are always consistent with an\ninfinitude of different global solutions. The easy way to see that\nthere always is a solution is to construct the minimal solution in the\nfollowing way. Start drawing straight lines from \\(S\\) as required by\nthe initial data. If a line hits \\(L-\\) from the bottom, just continue\nit coming out of the top of \\(L+\\) in the appropriate place, and if a\nline hits \\(L+\\) from the bottom, continue it emerging from \\(L-\\) at\nthe appropriate place.\n Figure 4\n represents the minimal solution for a single particle which enters\nthe time-travel region from the left:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Minimal Solution. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe particle \u201ctravels back in time\u201d three times. It is\nobvious that this minimal solution is a global solution, since the\nparticle always travels inertially.\n\nBut the same initial state on \\(S\\) is also consistent with other\nglobal solutions. The new requirement imposed by the topology is just\nthat the data going into \\(L+\\) from the bottom match the data coming\nout of \\(L-\\) from the top, and the data going into \\(L-\\) from the\nbottom match the data coming out of \\(L+\\) from the top. So we can add\nany number of vertical lines connecting \\(L-\\) and \\(L+\\) to a\nsolution and still have a solution. For example, adding a few such\nlines to the minimal solution yields:\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A Non-Minimal Solution. [An\n extended description of figure 5\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe particle now collides with itself twice: first before it reaches\n\\(L+\\) for the first time, and again shortly before it exits the CTC\nregion. From the particle\u2019s point of view, it is traveling to\nthe right at a constant speed until it hits an older version of itself\nand comes to rest. It remains at rest until it is hit from the right\nby a younger version of itself, and then continues moving off, and the\nsame process repeats later. It is clear that this is a global model of\nthe dynamics, and that any number of distinct models could be\ngenerating by varying the number and placement of vertical lines.\n\nKnowing the data on \\(S\\), then, gives us only incomplete information\nabout how things will go for the particle. We know that the particle\nwill enter the CTC region, and will reach \\(L+\\), we know that it will\nbe the only particle in the universe, we know exactly where and with\nwhat speed it will exit the CTC region. But we cannot determine how\nmany collisions the particle will undergo (if any), nor how long (in\nproper time) it will stay in the CTC region. If the particle were a\nclock, we could not predict what time it would indicate when exiting\nthe region. Furthermore, the dynamics gives us no handle on what to\nthink of the various possibilities: there are no probabilities\nassigned to the various distinct possible outcomes.\n\nChanging the topology has changed the mathematics of the situation in\ntwo ways, which tend to pull in opposite directions. On the one hand,\n\\(S\\) is no longer a Cauchy surface, so it is perhaps not surprising\nthat data on \\(S\\) do not suffice to fix a unique global solution. But\non the other hand, there is an added constraint: data \u201ccoming\nout\u201d of \\(L-\\) must exactly match data \u201cgoing in\u201d to\n\\(L+\\), even though what comes out of \\(L-\\) helps to determine what\ngoes into \\(L+\\). This added consistency constraint tends to cut down\non solutions, although in this case the additional constraint is more\nthan outweighed by the freedom to consider various sorts of data on\n\\({L+}/{L-}\\).\n\nThe fact that the extra freedom outweighs the extra constraint also\npoints up one unexpected way that the supposed paradoxes of time\ntravel may be overcome. Let\u2019s try to set up a paradoxical\nsituation using the little closed time loop above. If we send a single\nparticle into the loop from the left and do nothing else, we know\nexactly where it will exit the right side of the time travel region.\nNow suppose we station someone at the other side of the region with\nthe following charge: if the particle should come out on the right\nside, the person is to do something to prevent the particle\nfrom going in on the left in the first place. In fact, this is quite\neasy to do: if we send a particle in from the right, it seems that it\ncan exit on the left and deflect the incoming left-hand\nparticle.\n\nCarrying on our reflection in this way, we further realize that if the\nparticle comes out on the right, we might as well send it\nback in order to deflect itself from entering in the first place. So\nall we really need to do is the following: set up a perfectly\nreflecting particle mirror on the right-hand side of the time travel\nregion, and launch the particle from the left so that\u2014if\nnothing interferes with it\u2014it will just barely hit \\(L+\\).\nOur paradox is now apparently complete. If, on the one hand, nothing\ninterferes with the particle it will enter the time-travel region on\nthe left, exit on the right, be reflected from the mirror, re-enter\nfrom the right, and come out on the left to prevent itself from ever\nentering. So if it enters, it gets deflected and never enters. On the\nother hand, if it never enters then nothing goes in on the left, so\nnothing comes out on the right, so nothing is reflected back, and\nthere is nothing to deflect it from entering. So if it doesn\u2019t\nenter, then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters. If it\nenters, then it is deflected and doesn\u2019t enter; if it\ndoesn\u2019t enter then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters:\nparadox complete.\n\nBut at least one solution to the supposed paradox is easy to\nconstruct: just follow the recipe for constructing the minimal\nsolution, continuing the initial trajectory of the particle\n(reflecting it the mirror in the obvious way) and then read of the\nnumber and trajectories of the particles from the resulting diagram.\nWe get the result of\n figure 6:\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Resolving the\n\u201cParadox\u201d. [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs we can see, the particle approaching from the left never reaches\n\\(L+\\): it is deflected first by a particle which emerges from \\(L-\\).\nBut it is not deflected by itself, as the paradox suggests,\nit is deflected by another particle. Indeed, there are now\nfour particles in the diagram: the original particle and\nthree particles which are confined to closed time-like curves. It is\nnot the leftmost particle which is reflected by the mirror, nor even\nthe particle which deflects the leftmost particle; it is another\nparticle altogether.\n\nThe paradox gets it traction from an incorrect presupposition. If\nthere is only one particle in the world at \\(S\\) then there is only\none particle which could participate in an interaction in the time\ntravel region: the single particle would have to interact with its\nearlier (or later) self. But there is no telling what might come out\nof \\(L-\\): the only requirement is that whatever comes out must match\nwhat goes in at \\(L+\\). So if you go to the trouble of constructing a\nworking time machine, you should be prepared for a different kind of\ndisappointment when you attempt to go back and kill yourself: you may\nbe prevented from entering the machine in the first place by some\ncompletely unpredictable entity which emerges from it. And once again\na peculiar sort of indeterminism appears: if there are many\nself-consistent things which could prevent you from entering, there is\nno telling which is even likely to materialize. This is just like the\ncase of the unwritten book: the book is never written, so nothing\ndetermines what fills its pages.\n\nSo when the freedom to put data on \\(L-\\) outweighs the constraint\nthat the same data go into \\(L+\\), instead of paradox we get an\nembarrassment of riches: many solution consistent with the data on\n\\(S\\), or many possible books. To see a case where the constraint\n\u201coutweighs\u201d the freedom, we need to construct a very\nparticular, and frankly artificial, dynamics and topology. Consider\nthe space of all linear dynamics for a scalar field on a lattice. (The\nlattice can be though of as a simple discrete space-time.) We will\ndepict the space-time lattice as a directed graph. There is to be a\nscalar field defined at every node of the graph, whose value at a\ngiven node depends linearly on the values of the field at nodes which\nhave arrows which lead to it. Each edge of the graph can be assigned a\nweighting factor which determines how much the field at the input node\ncontributes to the field at the output node. If we name the nodes by\nthe letters a, b, c, etc., and the edges by\ntheir endpoints in the obvious way, then we can label the weighting\nfactors by the edges they are associated with in an equally obvious\nway.\n\nSuppose that the graph of the space-time lattice is acyclic,\nas in\n figure 7.\n (A graph is Acyclic if one can not travel in the direction\nof the arrows and go in a loop.)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: An Acyclic Lattice. [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIt is easy to regard a set of nodes as the analog of a Cauchy surface,\ne.g., the set \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\), and it is obvious if arbitrary data are\nput on those nodes the data will generate a unique solution in the\n future.[3]\n If the value of the field at node \\(a\\) is 3 and at node \\(b\\) is 7,\nthen its value at node \\(d\\) will be \\(3W_{ad}\\) and its value at node\n\\(e\\) will be \\(3W_{ae} + 7W_{be}\\). By varying the weighting factors\nwe can adjust the dynamics, but in an acyclic graph the future\nevolution of the field will always be unique.\n\nLet us now again artificially alter the topology of the lattice to\nadmit CTCs, so that the graph now is cyclic. One of the simplest such\ngraphs is depicted in\n figure 8:\n there are now paths which lead from \\(z\\) back to itself, e.g., \\(z\\)\nto \\(y\\) to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Time Travel on a Lattice. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nCan we now put arbitrary data on \\(v\\) and \\(w\\), and continue that\ndata to a global solution? Will the solution be unique?\n\nIn the generic case, there will be a solution and the solution will be\nunique. The equations for the value of the field at \\(x, y\\), and\n\\(z\\) are: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nx &= vW_{vx} + zW_{zx} \\\\\n y &= wW_{wy} + zW_{zy} \\\\\n z &= xW_{xz} + yW_{yz}. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSolving these equations for \\(z\\) yields \n\\[ z = (vW_{vx} + zW_{zx})W_{xz} + (wW_{wy} + zW_{zy})W_{yz}, \\]\n\n\nor \n\\[ z = \\frac{(vW_{vx}W_{xz} + wW_{wy}W_{yz})} {(1 - W_{zx}W_{xz} - W_{zy}W_{yz})}, \\]\n\n\nwhich gives a unique value for \\(z\\) in the generic case. But looking\nat the space of all possible dynamics for this lattice (i.e., the\nspace of all possible weighting factors), we find a singularity in the\ncase where \\(1-W_{zx}W_{xz} - W_{zy}W_{yz} = 0\\). If we choose\nweighting factors in just this way, then arbitrary data at \\(v\\) and\n\\(w\\) cannot be continued to a global solution. Indeed, if the scalar\nfield is everywhere non-negative, then this particular choice of\ndynamics puts ironclad constraints on the value of the field at \\(v\\)\nand \\(w\\): the field there must be zero (assuming \\(W_{vx}\\) and\n\\(W_{wy}\\) to be non-zero), and similarly all nodes in their past must\nhave field value zero. If the field can take negative values, then the\nvalues at \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) must be so chosen that \\(vW_{vx}W_{xz} =\n-wW_{wy}W_{yz}\\). In either case, the field values at \\(v\\) and \\(w\\)\nare severely constrained by the existence of the CTC region even\nthough these nodes lie completely to the past of that region. It is\nthis sort of constraint which we find to be unlike anything which\nappears in standard physics.\n\nOur toy models suggest three things. The first is that it may be\nimpossible to prove in complete generality that arbitrary data on a\npartial Cauchy surface can always be continued to a global\nsolution: our artificial case provides an example where it cannot. The\nsecond is that such odd constraints are not likely to be generic: we\nhad to delicately fine-tune the dynamics to get a problem. The third\nis that the opposite problem, namely data on a partial Cauchy surface\nbeing consistent with many different global solutions, is\nlikely to be generic: we did not have to do any fine-tuning to get\nthis result.\n\nThis third point leads to a peculiar sort of indeterminism,\nillustrated by the case of the unwritten book: the entire state on\n\\(S\\) does not determine what will happen in the future even though\nthe local dynamics is deterministic and there are no other\n\u201cedges\u201d to space-time from which data could influence the\nresult. What happens in the time travel region is constrained but not\ndetermined by what happens on \\(S\\), and the dynamics does not even\nsupply any probabilities for the various possibilities. The\nexample of the photographic negative discussed in section 2, then,\nseems likely to be unusual, for in that case there is a\nunique fixed point for the dynamics, and the set-up plus the\ndynamical laws determine the outcome. In the generic case one\nwould rather expect multiple fixed points, with no room for\nanything to influence, even probabilistically, which would be\nrealized. (See the supplement on\n\nRemarks and Limitations on the Toy Models.\n\nIt is ironic that time travel should lead generically not to\ncontradictions or to constraints (in the normal region) but to\nunderdetermination of what happens in the time travel region\nby what happens everywhere else (an underdetermination tied neither to\na probabilistic dynamics nor to a free edge to space-time). The\ntraditional objection to time travel is that it leads to\ncontradictions: there is no consistent way to complete an arbitrarily\nconstructed story about how the time traveler intends to act. Instead,\nthough, it appears that the more significant problem is\nunderdetermination: the story can be consistently completed in many\ndifferent ways.\n5. Slightly More Realistic Models of Time Travel\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer, and Thorne (1991) considered the case of\n3-dimensional single hard spherical ball that can go through a single\ntime travel wormhole so as to collide with its younger self.\n\n\n\nFigure 9 [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe threat of paradox in this case arises in the following form.\nConsider the initial trajectory of a ball as it approaches the time\ntravel region. For some initial trajectories, the ball does not\nundergo a collision before reaching mouth 1, but upon exiting mouth 2\nit will collide with its earlier self. This leads to a contradiction\nif the collision is strong enough to knock the ball off its trajectory\nand deflect it from entering mouth 1. Of course, the Wheeler-Feynman\nstrategy is to look for a \u201cglancing blow\u201d solution: a\ncollision which will produce exactly the (small) deviation in\ntrajectory of the earlier ball that produces exactly that collision.\nAre there always such\n solutions?[4]\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer & Thorne found a large class of initial\ntrajectories that have consistent \u201cglancing blow\u201d\ncontinuations, and found none that do not (but their search was not\ncompletely general). They did not produce a rigorous proof that every\ninitial trajectory has a consistent continuation, but suggested that\nit is very plausible that every initial trajectory has a consistent\ncontinuation. That is to say, they have made it very plausible that,\nin the billiard ball wormhole case, the time travel structure of such\na wormhole space-time does not result in constraints on states on\nspacelike surfaces in the non-time travel region.\n\nIn fact, as one might expect from our discussion in the previous\nsection, they found the opposite problem from that of inconsistency:\nthey found underdetermination. For a large class of initial\ntrajectories there are multiple different consistent \u201cglancing\nblow\u201d continuations of that trajectory (many of which involve\nmultiple wormhole traversals). For example, if one initially has a\nball that is traveling on a trajectory aimed straight between the two\nmouths, then one obvious solution is that the ball passes between the\ntwo mouths and never time travels. But another solution is that the\nyounger ball gets knocked into mouth 1 exactly so as to come out of\nmouth 2 and produce that collision. Echeverria et al. do not note the\npossibility (which we pointed out in the previous section) of the\nexistence of additional balls in the time travel region. We conjecture\n(but have no proof) that for every initial trajectory of \\(A\\) there\nare some, and generically many, multiple-ball continuations.\n\nFriedman, Morris, et al. (1990) examined the case of source-free\nnon-self-interacting scalar fields traveling through such a time\ntravel wormhole and found that no constraints on initial conditions in\nthe non-time travel region are imposed by the existence of such time\ntravel wormholes. In general there appear to be no known counter\nexamples to the claim that in \u201csomewhat realistic\u201d\ntime-travel space-times with a partial Cauchy surface there are no\nconstraints imposed on the state on such a partial Cauchy surface by\nthe existence of CTC\u2019s. (See, e.g., Friedman & Morris 1991;\nThorne 1994; Earman 1995; Earman, Smeenk, & W\u00fcthrich 2009;\nand Dowe 2007.)\n\nHow about the issue of constraints in the time travel region \\(T\\)?\nPrima facie, constraints in such a region would not appear to\nbe surprising. But one might still expect that there should be no\nconstraints on states on a spacelike surface, provided one keeps the\nsurface \u201csmall enough\u201d. In the physics literature the\nfollowing question has been asked: for any point \\(p\\) in \\(T\\), and\nany space-like surface \\(S\\) that includes \\(p\\) is there a\nneighborhood \\(E\\) of \\(p\\) in \\(S\\) such that any solution on \\(E\\)\ncan be extended to a solution on the whole space-time? With respect to\nthis question, there are some simple models in which one has this kind\nof extendability of local solutions to global ones, and some simple\nmodels in which one does not have such extendability, with no clear\ngeneral pattern. The technical mathematical problems are amplified by\nthe more conceptual problem of what it might mean to say that one\ncould create a situation which forces the creation of closed timelike\ncurves. (See, e.g., Yurtsever 1990; Friedman, Morris, et al. 1990;\nNovikov 1992; Earman 1995; and Earman, Smeenk, & W\u00fcthrich\n2009). What are we to think of all of this?\n6. The Possibility of Time Travel Redux\n\nThe toy models above all treat billiard balls, fields, and other\nobjects propagating through a background spacetime with CTCs. Even if\nwe can show that a consistent solution exists, there is a further\nquestion: what kind of matter and dynamics could generate CTCs to\nbegin with? There are various solutions of Einstein\u2019s equations\nwith CTCs, but how do these exotic spacetimes relate to the models\nactually used in describing the world? In other words, what positive\nreasons might we have to take CTCs seriously as a feature of the\nactual universe, rather than an exotic possibility of primarily\nmathematical interest?\n\nWe should distinguish two different kinds of \u201cpossibility\u201d\nthat we might have in mind in posing such questions (following Stein\n1970). First, we can consider a solution as a candidate cosmological\nmodel, describing the (large-scale gravitational degrees of freedom of\nthe) entire universe. The case for ruling out spacetimes with CTCs as\npotential cosmological models strikes us as, surprisingly, fairly\nweak. Physicists used to simply rule out solutions with CTCs as\nunreasonable by fiat, due to the threat of paradoxes, which we have\ndismantled above. But it is also challenging to make an observational\ncase. Observations tell us very little about global features, such as\nthe existence of CTCs, because signals can only reach an observer from\na limited region of spacetime, called the past light cone. Our past\nlight cone\u2014and indeed the collection of all the past light cones\nfor possible observers in a given spacetime\u2014can be embedded in\nspacetimes with quite different global features (Malament 1977,\nManchak 2009). This undercuts the possibility of using observations to\nconstrain global topology, including (among other things) ruling out\nthe existence of CTCs.\n\nYet the case in favor of taking cosmological models with CTCs\nseriously is also not particularly strong. Some solutions used to\ndescribe black holes, which are clearly relevant in a variety of\nastrophysical contexts, include CTCs. But the question of whether the\nCTCs themselves play an essential representational role is subtle: the\nCTCs arise in the maximal extensions of these solutions, and can\nplausibly be regarded as extraneous to successful applications.\nFurthermore, many of the known solutions with CTCs have symmetries,\nraising the possibility that CTCs are not a stable or robust feature.\nSlight departures from symmetry may lead to a solution without CTCs,\nsuggesting that the CTCs may be an artifact of an idealized model.\n\nThe second sense of possibility regards whether\n\u201creasonable\u201d initial conditions can be shown to lead to,\nor not to lead to, the formation of CTCs. As with the toy models\nabove, suppose that we have a partial Cauchy surface \\(S\\), such that\nall the temporal funny business lies to the future. Rather than simply\nassuming that there is a region with CTCs to the future, we can ask\ninstead whether it is possible to create CTCs by manipulating\nmatter in the initial, well-behaved region\u2014that is, whether it\nis possible to build a time machine. Several physicists have pursued\n\u201cchronology protection theorems\u201d aiming to show that the\ndynamics of general relativity (or some other aspects of physics)\nrules this out, and to clarify why this is the case. The proof of such\na theorem would justify neglecting solutions with CTCs as a source of\ninsight into the nature of time in the actual world. But as of yet\nthere are several partial results that do not fully settle the\nquestion. One further intriguing possibility is that even if general\nrelativity by itself does protect chronology, it may not be possible\nto formulate a sensible theory describing matter and fields in\nsolutions with CTCs. (See SEP entry on Time Machines; Smeenk and\nW\u00fcthrich 2011 for more.)\n\nThere is a different question regarding the limitations of these toy\nmodels. The toy models and related examples show that there are\nconsistent solutions for simple systems in the presence of CTCs. As\nusual we have made the analysis tractable by building toy models,\nselecting only a few dynamical degrees of freedom and tracking their\nevolution. But there is a large gap between the systems we have\ndescribed and the time travel stories they evoke, with Kurt traveling\nalong a CTC with murderous intentions. In particular, many features of\nthe manifest image of time are tied to the thermodynamical properties\nof macroscopic systems. Rovelli (unpublished) considers a extremely\nsimple system to illustrate the problem: can a clock move along a CTC?\nA clock consists of something in periodic motion, such as a pendulum\nbob, and something that counts the oscillations, such as an escapement\nmechanism. The escapement mechanism cannot work without friction; this\nrequires dissipation and increasing entropy. For a clock that counts\noscillations as it moves along a time-like trajectory, the entropy\nmust be a monotonically increasing function. But that is obviously\nincompatible with the clock returning to precisely the same state at\nsome future time as it completes a loop. The point generalizes,\nobviously, to imply that anything like a human, with memory and\nagency, cannot move along a CTC.\n7. Even If There are Constraints, So What?\n\nSince it is not obvious that one can rid oneself of all constraints in\nrealistic models, let us examine the argument that time travel is\nimplausible, and we should think it unlikely to exist in our world, in\nso far as it implies such constraints. The argument goes something\nlike the following. In order to satisfy such constraints one needs\nsome pre-established divine harmony between the global (time travel)\nstructure of space-time and the distribution of particles and fields\non space-like surfaces in it. But it is not plausible that the actual\nworld, or any world even remotely like ours, is constructed with\ndivine harmony as part of the plan. In fact, one might argue, we have\nempirical evidence that conditions in any spatial region can vary\nquite arbitrarily. So we have evidence that such constraints, whatever\nthey are, do not in fact exist in our world. So we have evidence that\nthere are no closed time-like lines in our world or one remotely like\nit. We will now examine this argument in more detail by presenting\nfour possible responses, with counterresponses, to this argument.\n\nResponse 1. There is nothing implausible or new about\nsuch constraints. For instance, if the universe is spatially closed,\nthere has to be enough matter to produce the needed curvature, and\nthis puts constraints on the matter distribution on a space-like\nhypersurface. Thus global space-time structure can quite\nunproblematically constrain matter distributions on space-like\nhypersurfaces in it. Moreover we have no realistic idea what these\nconstraints look like, so we hardly can be said to have evidence that\nthey do not obtain.\n\nCounterresponse 1. Of course there are constraining\nrelations between the global structure of space-time and the matter in\nit. The Einstein equations relate curvature of the manifold to the\nmatter distribution in it. But what is so strange and implausible\nabout the constraints imposed by the existence of closed time-like\ncurves is that these constraints in essence have nothing to do with\nthe Einstein equations. When investigating such constraints one\ntypically treats the particles and/or field in question as test\nparticles and/or fields in a given space-time, i.e., they are assumed\nnot to affect the metric of space-time in any way. In typical\nspace-times without closed time-like curves this means that one has,\nin essence, complete freedom of matter distribution on a space-like\nhypersurface. (See\n response 2\n for some more discussion of this issue). The constraints imposed by\nthe possibility of time travel have a quite different origin and are\nimplausible. In the ordinary case there is a causal interaction\nbetween matter and space-time that results in relations between global\nstructure of space-time and the matter distribution in it. In the time\ntravel case there is no such causal story to be told: there simply has\nto be some pre-established harmony between the global space-time\nstructure and the matter distribution on some space-like surfaces.\nThis is implausible.\n\nResponse 2. Constraints upon matter distributions are\nnothing new. For instance, Maxwell\u2019s equations constrain\nelectric fields \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) on an initial surface to be related\nto the (simultaneous) charge density distribution \\(\\varrho\\) by the\nequation \\(\\varrho = \\text{div}(\\boldsymbol{E})\\). (If we assume that\nthe \\(E\\) field is generated solely by the charge distribution, this\nconditions amounts to requiring that the \\(E\\) field at any point in\nspace simply be the one generated by the charge distribution according\nto Coulomb\u2019s inverse square law of electrostatics.) This is not\nimplausible divine harmony. Such constraints can hold as a matter of\nphysical law. Moreover, if we had inferred from the apparent free\nvariation of conditions on spatial regions that there could be no such\nconstraints we would have mistakenly inferred that \\(\\varrho =\n\\text{div}(\\boldsymbol{E})\\) could not be a law of nature.\n\nCounterresponse 2. The constraints imposed by the\nexistence of closed time-like lines are of quite a different character\nfrom the constraint imposed by \\(\\varrho =\n\\text{div}(\\boldsymbol{E})\\). The constraints imposed by \\(\\varrho =\n\\text{div}(\\boldsymbol{E})\\) on the state on a space-like hypersurface\nare:\n\nlocal constraints (i.e., to check whether the constraint holds in\na region you just need to see whether it holds at each point in the\nregion),\nquite independent of the global space-time structure,\nquite independent of how the space-like surface in question is\nembedded in a given space-time, and\nvery simply and generally stateable.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the consistency constraints imposed by the\nexistence of closed time-like curves (i) are not local, (ii) are\ndependent on the global structure of space-time, (iii) depend on the\nlocation of the space-like surface in question in a given space-time,\nand (iv) appear not to be simply stateable other than as the demand\nthat the state on that space-like surface embedded in such and such a\nway in a given space-time, do not lead to inconsistency. On some views\nof laws (e.g., David Lewis\u2019 view) this plausibly implies that\nsuch constraints, even if they hold, could not possibly be laws. But\neven if one does not accept such a view of laws, one could claim that\nthe bizarre features of such constraints imply that it is implausible\nthat such constraints hold in our world or in any world remotely like\nours.\n\nResponse 3. It would be strange if there are\nconstraints in the non-time travel region. It is not strange if there\nare constraints in the time travel region. They should be explained in\nterms of the strange, self-interactive, character of time travel\nregions. In this region there are time-like trajectories from points\nto themselves. Thus the state at such a point, in such a region, will,\nin a sense, interact with itself. It is a well-known fact that systems\nthat interact with themselves will develop into an equilibrium state,\nif there is such an equilibrium state, or else will develop towards\nsome singularity. Normally, of course, self-interaction isn\u2019t\ntrue instantaneous self-interaction, but consists of a feed-back\nmechanism that takes time. But in time travel regions something like\ntrue instantaneous self-interaction occurs. This explains why\nconstraints on states occur in such time travel regions: the states\n\u201cab initio\u201d have to be \u201cequilibrium\nstates\u201d. Indeed in a way this also provides some picture of why\nindeterminism occurs in time travel regions: at the onset of\nself-interaction states can fork into different equi-possible\nequilibrium states.\n\nCounterresponse 3. This is explanation by woolly\nanalogy. It all goes to show that time travel leads to such bizarre\nconsequences that it is unlikely that it occurs in a world remotely\nlike ours.\n\n\nResponse 4. All of the previous discussion completely\nmisses the point. So far we have been taking the space-time structure\nas given, and asked the question whether a given time travel\nspace-time structure imposes constraints on states on (parts of)\nspace-like surfaces. However, space-time and matter interact. Suppose\nthat one is in a space-time with closed time-like lines, such that\ncertain counterfactual distributions of matter on some neighborhood of\na point \\(p\\) are ruled out if one holds that space-time structure\nfixed. One might then ask\n\n\nWhy does the actual state near \\(p\\) in fact satisfy these\nconstraints? By what divine luck or plan is this local state\ncompatible with the global space-time structure? What if conditions\nnear \\(p\\) had been slightly different?\n\n\nAnd one might take it that the lack of normal answers to these\nquestions indicates that it is very implausible that our world, or any\nremotely like it, is such a time travel universe. However the proper\nresponse to these question is the following. There are no constraints\nin any significant sense. If they hold they hold as a matter of\naccidental fact, not of law. There is no more explanation of them\npossible than there is of any contingent fact. Had conditions in a\nneighborhood of \\(p\\) been otherwise, the global structure of\nspace-time would have been different. So what? The only question\nrelevant to the issue of constraints is whether an arbitrary state on\nan arbitrary spatial surface \\(S\\) can always be embedded into a\nspace-time such that that state on \\(S\\) consistently extends to a\nsolution on the entire space-time.\n\nBut we know the answer to that question. A well-known theorem in\ngeneral relativity says the following: any initial data set on a three\ndimensional manifold \\(S\\) with positive definite metric has a unique\nembedding into a maximal space-time in which \\(S\\) is a Cauchy surface\n(see, e.g., Geroch & Horowitz 1979: 284 for more detail), i.e.,\nthere is a unique largest space-time which has \\(S\\) as a Cauchy\nsurface and contains a consistent evolution of the initial value data\non \\(S\\). Now since \\(S\\) is a Cauchy surface this space-time does not\nhave closed time like curves. But it may have extensions (in which\n\\(S\\) is not a Cauchy surface) which include closed timelike curves,\nindeed it may be that any maximal extension of it would include closed\ntimelike curves. (This appears to be the case for extensions of states\non certain surfaces of Taub-NUT space-times. See Earman, Smeenk, &\nW\u00fcthrich 2009). But these extensions, of course, will be\nconsistent. So properly speaking, there are no constraints on states\non space-like surfaces. Nonetheless the space-time in which these are\nembedded may or may not include closed time-like curves.\n\n\nCounterresponse 4. This, in essence, is the\nstonewalling answer which we indicated in section 1. However, whether\nor not you call the constraints imposed by a given space-time on\ndistributions of matter on certain space-like surfaces \u201cgenuine\nconstraints\u201d, whether or not they can be considered lawlike, and\nwhether or not they need to be explained, the existence of such\nconstraints can still be used to argue that time travel worlds are so\nbizarre that it is implausible that our world or any world remotely\nlike ours is a time travel world.\n\nSuppose that one is in a time travel world. Suppose that given the\nglobal space-time structure of this world, there are constraints\nimposed upon, say, the state of motion of a ball on some space-like\nsurface when it is treated as a test particle, i.e., when it is\nassumed that the ball does not affect the metric properties of the\nspace-time it is in. (There is lots of other matter that, via the\nEinstein equation, corresponds exactly to the curvature that there is\neverywhere in this time travel worlds.) Now a real ball of course does\nhave some effect on the metric of the space-time it is in. But let us\nconsider a ball that is so small that its effect on the metric is\nnegligible. Presumably it will still be the case that certain states\nof this ball on that space-like surface are not compatible with the\nglobal time travel structure of this universe.\n\nThis means that the actual distribution of matter on such a space-like\nsurface can be extended into a space-time with closed time-like lines,\nbut that certain counterfactual distributions of matter on this\nspace-like surface can not be extended into the same space-time.\nBut note that the changes made in the matter distribution (when\ngoing from the actual to the counterfactual distribution) do not in\nany non-negligible way affect the metric properties of the\nspace-time. (Recall that the changes only effect test particles.)\nThus the reason why the global time travel properties of the\ncounterfactual space-time have to be significantly different from the\nactual space-time is not that there are problems with metric\nsingularities or alterations in the metric that force significant\nglobal changes when we go to the counterfactual matter distribution.\nThe reason that the counterfactual space-time has to be different is\nthat in the counterfactual world the ball\u2019s initial state of\nmotion starting on the space-like surface, could not \u201cmeet\nup\u201d in a consistent way with its earlier self (could not be\nconsistently extended) if we were to let the global structure of the\ncounterfactual space-time be the same as that of the actual\nspace-time. Now, it is not bizarre or implausible that there is a\ncounterfactual dependence of manifold structure, even of its topology,\non matter distributions on spacelike surfaces. For instance, certain\nmatter distributions may lead to singularities, others may not. We may\nindeed in some sense have causal power over the topology of the\nspace-time we live in. But this power normally comes via the Einstein\nequations. But it is bizarre to think that there could be a\ncounterfactual dependence of global space-time structure on the\narrangement of certain tiny bits of matter on some space-like surface,\nwhere changes in that arrangement by assumption do not affect the\nmetric anywhere in space-time in any significant way. It is\nimplausible that we live in such a world, or that a world even\nremotely like ours is like that.\n\nLet us illustrate this argument in a different way by assuming that\nwormhole time travel imposes constraints upon the states of people\nprior to such time travel, where the people have so little mass/energy\nthat they have negligible effect, via the Einstein equation, on the\nlocal metric properties of space-time. Do you think it more plausible\nthat we live in a world where wormhole time travel occurs but it only\noccurs when people\u2019s states are such that these local states\nhappen to combine with time travel in such a way that nobody ever\nsucceeds in killing their younger self, or do you think it more\nplausible that we are not in a wormhole time travel\n world?[5]\n8. Computational Models\n\nAn alternative approach to time travel (initiated by Deutsch 1991)\nabstracts away from the idealized toy models described\n above.[6]\n This computational approach considers instead the evolution of bits\n(simple physical systems with two discrete states) through a network\nof interactions, which can be represented by a circuit diagram with\ngates corresponding to the interactions. Motivated by the possibility\nof CTCs, Deutsch proposed adding a new kind of channel that connects\nthe output of a given gate back to its\ninput\u2014in essence, a backwards-time step. More\nconcretely, given a gate that takes \\(n\\) bits as input, we can\nimagine taking some number \\(i \\lt n\\) of these bits through a channel\nthat loops back and then do double-duty as inputs. Consistency\nrequires that the state of these \\(i\\) bits is the same for output and\ninput. (We will consider an illustration of this kind of system in the\nnext section.) Working through examples of circuit diagrams with a CTC\nchannel leads to similar treatments of Consistency and\nUnderdetermination as the discussion above (see, e.g.,\nWallace 2012: \u00a7 10.6). But the approach offers two new insights\n(both originally due to Deutsch): the Easy Knowledge paradox,\nand a particularly clear extension to time travel in quantum\nmechanics.\n\nA computer equipped with a CTC channel can exploit the need to find\nconsistent evolution to solve remarkably hard problems. (This is quite\ndifferent than the first idea that comes to mind to enhance\ncomputational power: namely to just devote more time to a computation,\nand then send the result back on the CTC to an earlier state.) The\ngate in a circuit incorporating a CTC implements a function from the\ninput bits to the output bits, under the constraint that the output\nand input match the i bits going through the CTC channel.\nThis requires, in effect, finding the fixed point of the relevant\nfunction. Given the generality of the model, there are few limits on\nthe functions that could be implemented on the CTC circuit. Nature has\nto solve a hard computational problem just to ensure consistent\nevolution. This can then be extended to other complex computational\nproblems\u2014leading, more precisely, to solutions of\nNP-complete problems in polynomial time (see Aaronson\n2013: Chapter 20 for an overview and further references). The limits\nimposed by computational complexity are an essential part of our\nepistemic situation, and computers with CTCs would radically change\nthis.\n9. Quantum Mechanics to the Rescue?\n\nWe now turn to the application of the computational approach to the\nquantum physics of time travel (see Deutsch 1991; Deutsch &\nLockwood 1994). By contrast with the earlier discussions of\nconstraints in classical systems, they claim to show that time travel\nnever imposes any constraints on the pre-time travel state of quantum\nsystems. The essence of this account is as\n follows.[7]\n\nA quantum system starts in state \\(S_1\\), interacts with its older\nself, after the interaction is in state \\(S_2\\), time travels while\ndeveloping into state \\(S_3\\), then interacts with its younger self,\nand ends in state \\(S_4\\) (see\n figure 10).\n\n\n\nFigure 10 [An\n extended description of figure 10\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nDeutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are the\nmixed states, i.e., are represented by the density matrices over the\nHilbert space of that system. Deutsch then shows that for any initial\nstate \\(S_1\\), any unitary interaction between the older and younger\nself, and any unitary development during time travel, there is a\nconsistent solution, i.e., there is at least one pair of states\n\\(S_2\\) and \\(S_3\\) such that when \\(S_1\\) interacts with \\(S_3\\) it\nwill change to state \\(S_2\\) and \\(S_2\\) will then develop into\n\\(S_3\\). The states \\(S_2, S_3\\) and \\(S_4\\) will typically be not be\npure states, i.e., will be non-trivial mixed states, even if \\(S_1\\)\nis pure. In order to understand how this leads to interpretational\nproblems let us give an example. Consider a system that has a two\ndimensional Hilbert space with as a basis the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and\n\\(\\vc{-}\\). Let us suppose that when state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the young\nsystem encounters state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the older system, they interact\nand the young system develops into state \\(\\vc{-}\\) and the old system\nremains in state \\(\\vc{+}\\). In obvious notation: \n\n\\[\\vc{+}_1 \\vc{+}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{-}_2 \\vc{+}_4.\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, suppose that:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\vc{+}_1 \\vc{-}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{+}_2 \\vc{-}_4, \\\\\n&\\vc{-}_1 \\vc{+}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{-}_2 \\vc{-}_4, \\text{ and} \\\\\n&\\vc{-}_1 \\vc{-}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{+}_2 \\vc{+}_4.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nLet us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state of\nthe system during time travel, i.e., that \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) develops into\n\\(\\vc{+}_3\\), and that \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) develops into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\).\n\nNow, if the only possible states of the system were \\(\\vc{+}\\) and\n\\(\\vc{-}\\) (i.e., if there were no superpositions or mixtures of these\nstates), then there is a constraint on initial states: initial state\n\\(\\vc{+}_1\\) is impossible. For if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts with\n\\(\\vc{+}_3\\) then it will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which, during\ntime travel, will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which inconsistent with\nthe assumed state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\). Similarly if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts\nwith \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) it will develop into \\(\\vc{+}_2\\), which will then\ndevelop into \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) which is also inconsistent. Thus the system\ncan not start in state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\).\n\nBut, says Deutsch, in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in\nany mixture of the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\). Suppose that the\nolder system, prior to the interaction, is in a state \\(S_3\\) which is\nan equal mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\). Then the\nyounger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture of\n50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which will then develop into a\nmixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which is consistent!\nMore generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem to show that no\nmatter what the unitary development during interaction is, and no\nmatter what the unitary development during time travel is, for any\nstate \\(S_1\\) there is always a state \\(S_3\\) (which typically is not\na pure state) which causes \\(S_1\\) to develop into a state \\(S_2\\)\nwhich develops into that state \\(S_3\\). Thus quantum mechanics comes\nto the rescue: it shows in all generality that no constraints on\ninitial states are needed!\n\nOne might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states: will\nsuperpositions of states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\) not suffice?\nUnfortunately such an idea does not work. Suppose again that the\ninitial state is \\(\\vc{+}_1\\). One might suggest that that if state\n\\(S_3\\) is \n\\[\\sqt \\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt \\vc{-}_3\\]\n\n\none will obtain a consistent development. For one might think that\nwhen initial state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) encounters the superposition\n\n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nit will develop into superposition \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_2 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_2,\\]\n\n\nand that this in turn will develop into \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nas desired. However this is not correct. For initial state\n\\(\\vc{+}_1\\) when it encounters \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nwill develop into the entangled state \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{-}_2\\vc{+}_4 + \\sqt\\vc{+}_2\\vc{-}_4.\\]\n\n\nIn so far as one can speak of the state of the young system after this\ninteraction, it is in the mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50%\n\\(\\vc{-}_2\\), not in the superposition \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_2 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_2.\\]\n\n\nSo Deutsch does need his recourse to mixed states.\n\nThis clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however\nindicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of\nDeutsch\u2019s account. After the interaction the old and young\nsystem will (typically) be in an entangled state. Although for\npurposes of a measurement on one of the two systems one can say that\nthis system is in a mixed state, one can not represent the full state\nof the two systems by specifying the mixed state of each separate\npart, as there are correlations between observables of the two systems\nthat are not represented by these two mixed states, but are\nrepresented in the joint entangled state. But if there really is an\nentangled state of the old and young systems directly after the\ninteraction, how is one to represent the subsequent development of\nthis entangled state? Will the state of the younger system remain\nentangled with the state of the older system as the younger system\ntime travels and the older system moves on into the future? On what\nspace-like surfaces are we to imagine this total entangled state to\nbe? At this point it becomes clear that there is no obvious and simple\nway to extend elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to\nspace-times with closed time-like curves: we apparently need to\ncharacterize not just the entanglement between two systems, but\nentanglement relative to specific spacetime descriptions.\n\nHow does Deutsch avoid these complications? Deutsch assumes a mixed\nstate \\(S_3\\) of the older system prior to the interaction with the\nyounger system. He lets it interact with an arbitrary pure state\n\\(S_1\\) younger system. After this interaction there is an entangled\nstate \\(S'\\) of the two systems. Deutsch computes the mixed state\n\\(S_2\\) of the younger system which is implied by this entangled state\n\\(S'\\). His demand for consistency then is just that this mixed state\n\\(S_2\\) develops into the mixed state \\(S_3\\). Now it is not at all\nclear that this is a legitimate way to simplify the problem of time\ntravel in quantum mechanics. But even if we grant him this\nsimplification there is a problem: how are we to understand these\nmixtures?\n\nIf we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into\ntrouble. For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each\nolder system is either in state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) or in state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\)\nprior to the interaction. Then we regain our paradox. Deutsch instead\nrecommends the following, many worlds, picture of mixtures. Suppose we\nstart with state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) in all worlds. In some of the many\nworlds the older system will be in the \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) state, let us call\nthem A-worlds, and in some worlds, B-worlds, it will\nbe in the \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) state. Thus in A-worlds after\ninteraction we will have state \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) , and in B-worlds\nwe will have state \\(\\vc{+}_2\\). During time travel the \\(\\vc{-}_2\\)\nstate will remain the same, i.e., turn into state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), but\nthe systems in question will travel from A-worlds to\nB-worlds. Similarly the \\(\\vc{+}\\) \\(_2\\) states will travel\nfrom the B-worlds to the A-worlds, thus preserving\nconsistency.\n\nNow whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds interpretations,\nand of this understanding of it applied to mixtures, in the end one\ndoes not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch\u2019s account. The\nsystems in question travel from one time in one world to another time\nin another world, but no system travels to an earlier time in the same\nworld. (This is so at least in the normal sense of the word\n\u201cworld\u201d, the sense that one means when, for instance, one\nsays \u201cthere was, and will be, only one Elvis Presley in this\nworld.\u201d) Thus, even if it were a reasonable view, it is not\nquite as interesting as it may have initially seemed. (See Wallace\n2012 for a more sympathetic treatment, that explores several further\nimplications of accepting time travel in conjunction with the many\nworlds interpretation.)\n\nWe close by acknowledging that Deutsch\u2019s starting\npoint\u2014the claim that this computational model captures the\nessential features of quantum systems in a spacetime with\nCTCs\u2014has been the subject of some debate. Several physicists\nhave pursued a quite different treatment of evolution of quantum\nsystems through CTC\u2019s, based on considering the\n\u201cpost-selected\u201d state (see Lloyd et al. 2011). Their\nmotivations for implementing the consistency condition in terms of the\npost-selected state reflects a different stance towards quantum\nfoundations. A different line of argument aims to determine whether\nDeutsch\u2019s treatment holds as an appropriate limiting case of a\nmore rigorous treatment, such as quantum field theory in curved\nspacetimes. For example, Verch (2020) establishes several results\nchallenging the assumption that Deutsch\u2019s treatment is tied to\nthe presence of CTC\u2019s, or that it is compatible with the\nentanglement structure of quantum fields.\n10. Conclusions\n\nWhat remains of the grandfather paradox in general relativistic time\ntravel worlds is the fact that in some cases the states on edgeless\nspacelike surfaces are \u201coverconstrained\u201d, so that one has\nless than the usual freedom in specifying conditions on such a\nsurface, given the time-travel structure, and in some cases such\nstates are \u201cunderconstrained\u201d, so that states on edgeless\nspace-like surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way\nthat they usually do, given the time travel structure. There can also\nbe mixtures of those two types of cases. The extent to which states\nare overconstrained and/or underconstrained in realistic models is as\nyet unclear, though it would be very surprising if neither obtained.\nThe extant literature has primarily focused on the problem of\noverconstraint, since that, often, either is regarded as a\nmetaphysical obstacle to the possibility time travel, or as an\nepistemological obstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our\nworld. While it is true that our world would be quite different from\nthe way we normally think it is if states were overconstrained,\nunderconstraint seems at least as bizarre as overconstraint.\nNonetheless, neither directly rules out the possibility of time\ntravel.\n\nIf time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be\nsettled. And indeed, most of the stories employing time travel in\npopular culture are logically incoherent: one cannot\n\u201cchange\u201d the past to be different from what it was, since\nthe past (like the present and the future) only occurs once. But if\nthe only requirement demanded is logical coherence, then it seems all\ntoo easy. A clever author can devise a coherent time-travel scenario\nin which everything happens just once and in a consistent way. This is\njust too cheap: logical coherence is a very weak condition, and many\nthings we take to be metaphysically impossible are logically coherent.\nFor example, it involves no logical contradiction to suppose that\nwater is not molecular, but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it\nis a metaphysical impossibility. We have been interested not in\nlogical possibility but in physical possibility. But even so, our\nconditions have been relatively weak: we have asked only whether\ntime-travel is consistent with the universal validity of certain\nfundamental physical laws and with the notion that the physical state\non a surface prior to the time travel region be unconstrained. It is\nperfectly possible that the physical laws obey this condition, but\nstill that time travel is not metaphysically possible because of the\nnature of time itself. Consider an analogy. Aristotle believed that\nwater is homoiomerous and infinitely divisible: any bit of water could\nbe subdivided, in principle, into smaller bits of water.\nAristotle\u2019s view contains no logical contradiction. It was\ncertainly consistent with Aristotle\u2019s conception of water that\nit be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a conceptual possibility.\nBut if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong both about what water\nis like and what is possible for it. It can\u2019t be infinitely\ndivided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would reveal\nthat.\n\nSimilarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it\ndoes not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that\nsome specific physical considerations cannot rule it out. The only\nserious proof of the possibility of time travel would be a\ndemonstration of its actuality. For if we agree that there is no\nactual time travel in our universe, the supposition that there might\nhave been involves postulating a substantial difference from\nactuality, a difference unlike in kind from anything we could know if\nfirsthand. It is unclear to us exactly what the content of possible\nwould be if one were to either maintain or deny the possibility of\ntime travel in these circumstances, unless one merely meant that the\npossibility is not ruled out by some delineated set of constraints. As\nthe example of Aristotle\u2019s theory of water shows, conceptual and\nlogical \u201cpossibility\u201d do not entail possibility in a\nfull-blooded sense. What exactly such a full-blooded sense would be in\ncase of time travel, and whether one could have reason to believe it\nto obtain, remain to us obscure.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aaronson, Scott, 2013, <em>Quantum Computing since\nDemocritus</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\ndoi:10.1017/CBO9780511979309", "Arntzenius, Frank, 2006, \u201cTime Travel: Double Your\nFun\u201d, <em>Philosophy Compass</em>, 1(6): 599\u2013616.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00045.x", "Clarke, C.J.S., 1977, \u201cTime in General Relativity\u201d in\n<em>Foundations of Space-Time Theory</em>, <em>Minnesota Studies in\nthe Philosophy of Science</em>, Vol VIII, Earman, J., Glymour, C., and\nStachel, J.
