    "main_text": "\n\nIn early philosophical literature, a \u2018prediction\u2019 was\nconsidered to be an empirical consequence of a theory that had not yet\nbeen verified at the time the theory was constructed\u2014an\n\u2018accommodation\u2019 was one that had. The view that\npredictions are superior to accommodations in the assessment of\nscientific theories is known as \u2018predictivism\u2019. Commonly,\nhowever, predictivism is understood more precisely as entailing that\nevidence confirms theory more strongly when predicted than when\naccommodated. Much ink has been spilled modifying the concept of\n\u2018prediction\u2019 and explaining why predictivism is or is not\ntrue, and whether the history of science and, more recently, logic\n(Martin and Hjortland 2021) reveals that scientists are predictivist\nin their assessment of theories. The debate over predictivism also\nfigures importantly in the debate about scientific realism. \n",
