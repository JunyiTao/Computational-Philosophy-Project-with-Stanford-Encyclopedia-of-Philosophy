    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry is in four parts. The first part concerns the definition of\ntorture and addresses the question, what is torture? The second part\nconcerns the defining features of torture from a moral standpoint and\naddresses the question, what makes torture inherently morally wrong?\nFor instance, it is generally held that torture is defined in part as\nthe deliberate infliction of extreme suffering and that \u2013 by virtue of\nthis defining feature \u2013 torture is morally wrong. Note that even\nactions or practices that are inherently morally wrong might be\nmorally justified in extreme circumstances. Or to put things another\nway, performing an evil action might be morally justified if\nrefraining from performing it constituted a much greater evil. Indeed,\nthe third part of the entry concerns just this possibility: the\npossibility that notwithstanding its inherent moral wrongness, torture\nmight, nevertheless, in extreme emergencies be morally justified. In\nshort, the third part addresses the question, is torture morally\njustified in extreme emergencies? The last part of the entry concerns\nthe legality, as opposed to the morality, of torture and addresses the\nquestion,should torture ever be legalised or otherwise\n institutionalised?[1]\n\nIn relation to the definition of torture, there are now a number of\ncontemporary philosophical accounts on offer, notably those of Twining\n& Paskins (1978), Davis (2005), Miller (2005), Sussman (2005),\nGross (2009) and Kamm (2011). Moreover, there are numerous detailed\ndiscussions concerning the inherent moral wrongness of torture, all of\nwhich focus on the extreme suffering inflicted (Bentham 1804; Shue\n1978; Miller 2005 and 2009; Matthews 2008; Brecher 2008; Kershnar\n2011), but some of which put greater emphasis on torture as a\nviolation of autonomy (Sussman 2005; Miller 2005). Useful collections\nof essays on this and related topics are Levinson 2004, Greenberg et\nal. 2005, Roth & Worden 2005, Rodin 2007, Allhoff 2008, Clucas et\nal. 2009, Luban 2014 and Shue 2016.\n\nThe contemporary debate concerning the moral justifiability of torture\nin extreme emergencies principally concerns the torture of terrorists\nand is dominated by two groups. There are those who argue in the\naffirmative and point to so-called ticking bomb scenarios to support\ntheir case. These theorists often adhere to some form of\nconsequentialism, such as utilitarianism. They include Allhoff (2003,\n2012), and Bagaric and Clarke (2007), albeit the classic utilitarian\njustification remains that of Bentham (1804). (See also Twining &\nTwining 1973.) Then there are those who argue in the negative and\nstress not only the inherent immorality of torture but also contest\nthat it ever has good effects in practice (Davis 2005; Brecher 2008;\nMatthews 2008). For instance, they typically claim that torture does\nnot work, since those who are tortured tell their torturers whatever\nthey want to hear.\n\nThe classic denunciation of the legalisation of torture is that of\nCesare Beccaria 1764. In the contemporary debate concerning the\nlegalisation of torture many theorists of a liberal persuasion have\nstressed the incompatibility of torture with the values underpinning\nliberal institutions (Luban 2005; Waldron 2005, 2010; Shue\n2016). Moreover, in this contemporary debate, the protagonists have\ntended to assume that if torture is morally justified in some extreme\nemergencies then it ought to be legalised. Thus Alan Dershowitz claims\nthat torture is morally justified in some extreme emergencies and, in\nthe light of this claim, argues for torture warrants in these cases\n(2003, \n Chapter 4).[2] \n See also Steinhoff 2006 and\n2013. However, some theorists have argued that although torture can\nin some extreme emergencies be morally justified, nevertheless,\ntorture ought never to be legalised or otherwise\ninstitutionalised. This position was originally advanced by Machan\n(1990) before being argued in more detail by Miller (2005) and (2009),\nand later by McMahan (2008). \n\nBefore proceeding to the question, or questions, of the moral\njustifiability of torture in extreme emergencies we need some\nunderstanding of what torture is. We also need some account of what is\ninherently morally wrong with torture.\n",
