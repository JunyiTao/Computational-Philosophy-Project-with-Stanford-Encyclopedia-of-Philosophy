    "main_text": "Theorizing Ethical Supervenience\n1. Theorizing Ethical Supervenience\n\nMany philosophers hope to make significant arguments about ethics\nusing ethical supervenience as a premise. However, there are many\ndistinct ethical supervenience theses that philosophers might be\ninterested in. Understanding the differences between these theses can\nhelp to clarify which of them deserve our allegiance. It is also\nimportant because different supervenience theses will support quite\ndifferent arguments about ethics.\n\nTo begin, it is worth briefly characterizing certain core features of\nsupervenience relations, as they are now standardly understood in\nmetaphysics (see, e.g., the entry on\n supervenience).\n Supervenience relations are typically understood as relations between\npairs of classes of properties. Consider the claim that a certain\nclass of properties\u2014the A-properties\u2014cannot vary\nwithout the B-properties also varying. In this claim, we can\ncall the A-properties the supervening properties,\nand the B-properties the subvening or base\nproperties.\n\nSupervenience relations are covariance relations that have\nthree logical features: they are reflexive, transitive, and\nnon-symmetric. The claim that supervenience is reflexive\nmeans that every set of properties supervenes on itself: for any class\nof properties A, there can be no difference in the\nA-properties without a difference in the\nA-properties. The claim that supervenience is\ntransitive means that: if the A-properties supervene\non the B-properties, and the B-properties supervene\non the C-properties, then the A-properties supervene\non the C-properties. The claim that supervenience is\nnon-symmetric means that supervenience is compatible with\neither symmetry (A supervenes on B and B\nsupervenes on A; as in the case of the ethical and itself) or\nasymmetry (A supervenes on B but B does not\nsupervene on A; as may be the case between the biological and\nthe microphysical).\n\nThese claims reflect how use of the word \u2018supervenience\u2019\nhas come to be usefully regimented in contemporary metaphysics. It is\nworth emphasizing this point, because there is a significant history\nof the word being used in ways that depart from this contemporary\northodoxy. For example, for a time it was quite common both in\nmetaphysics and in ethics for \u2018supervenience\u2019 to be used\nto mark an asymmetrical dependence relation. Such uses are, however,\ninconsistent with the contemporary regimentation. This is a point\nabout terminological clarity, not a substantive barrier to discussing\nsuch asymmetric relations. For example, one could name the asymmetric\nrelation that holds when A supervenes on B but\nB does not supervene on A. Or one could name the\nrelation that holds when the supervenience of A on B\nis accompanied by an adequate explanation. One influential variant of\nthe latter sort of explanatory relation has been dubbed\n\u2018superdupervenience\u2019 (Horgan 1993, 566). More recently,\nmany philosophers have suggested that a certain asymmetric dependence\nrelation\u2014grounding\u2014is of central importance to\nour metaphysical theorizing. (For discussion, see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.)\n\nGiven the standard contemporary regimentation, however, supervenience\nclaims state a certain pattern of covariation between classes\nof properties, they do not purport to explain that pattern,\nas a grounding or superdupervenience thesis would (compare DePaul\n1987). This point is crucial to several arguments from ethical\nsupervenience, as we will see below.\n\nThese clarifying remarks put us in a position to introduce four\ncentral questions that can be used to develop alternative\nsupervenience theses:\n\nHow can we best characterize which properties the ethical\nproperties supervene on?\nShould we characterize the supervenience of the ethical in terms\nof facts about individuals, or about whole possible worlds?\nWhat is the modal strength of the supervenience relation? Does it\nhold only across worlds with the same laws of nature as ours, or\nacross all metaphysically, conceptually, or \u201cnormatively\u201d\npossible worlds?\nThus far I have introduced ethical supervenience as a thesis about\nwhat there is; is it better stated as a commitment concerning\ncombinations of our ethical attitudes?\n\n\nThe next four subsections consider these questions in turn. Before\nturning to these questions, it is worth briefly highlighting a\ndifferent issue: which class of supervening properties to focus on? A\nsurvey of the literature provides a variety of suggestions: relevant\nsupervening properties are characterized as ethical,\nmoral, evaluative, or normative. The nature\nof each of these categories, and the relationship between them, are\nboth controversial. For example, some philosophers will question the\nnormative authority of morality, while others will think of\nnormativity as a very broad tent, including any rule- or\nconvention-governed activity, such as chess or etiquette. This entry\nwill not explore these interesting issues (see Baker 2017 for\ndiscussion). Instead, it will provisionally assume that the\nsignificance of supervenience is similar for each of these classes of\nproperties. For the sake of uniformity, the entry will focus on\nethical properties throughout.\n",
