    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Similarity\n4.1 Similarity\n\nIntroductions to our topic often emphasise a connection to similarity.\nWhereas any two objects, no matter how similar or dissimilar, share\ninfinitely many properties and are divided by infinitely many\nproperties, sharing of natural properties \u201cmakes for\nsimilarity\u201d (Lewis\n 1983,\n 347;\n 1986b,\n 60), while division by natural properties \u201cmakes for\ndissimilarity\u201d. These vague generalizations suggest two\nprojects: that of analysing naturalness in terms of similarity, and\nthat of analysing similarity in terms of naturalness.\n\nThe former project has important historical antecedents. Starting with\na two-place predicate intended to express a specific notion of\nsimilarity (between total experiential states), Carnap\n (1928)\n defines a \u201cquality circle\u201d\u2014roughly, a natural\nclass\u2014as a class any two members of which are similar, which is\nnot contained in any other such class. Goodman\n (1951)\n influentially objected to some consequences of this definition (see\nthe entry on\n Nelson Goodman,\n \u00a74.2): for example, it implies that whenever \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and\n\\(C\\) are quality circles, \\((A\\cap B)\\cup(B\\cap C)\\cup(C\\cap A)\\) is\ncontained in some quality circle (the \u201cdifficulty of imperfect\ncommunity\u201d). This does not seem plausibly necessarily true,\nequating \u2018quality circle\u2019 with \u2018perfectly natural\nclass\u2019. \n\nSubsequent attempts to explain naturalness in terms of resemblance\nhave used richer inputs. For example, Rodriguez-Pereyra\n (2002)\n defines \u2018property class\u2019 in terms of a three-place\npredicate \u2018\\(x\\) resembles \\(y\\) to degree \\(n\\)\u2019. Here\n\\(n\\) is, surprisingly, a natural number\u2014the intention\nis that the degree of resemblance between two objects should turn out\nto equal the total number of \u201cproperty classes\u201d that\ncontain\n both.[10]\n Rodriguez-Pereyra\u2019s conception of degrees of resemblance is\nunusual, since it conflicts with the intuitive thought that everything\nresembles itself at least as strongly as anything could\nresemble anything else. On a more popular approach, the degree of\ndissimilarity between two objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is\nrepresented by a non-negative real number \\(d(x,y)\\) satisfying the\nfollowing \u201cpseudometric space\u201d axioms: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{i}    d(x,x) &= 0 \\\\\n\\tag{ii}   d(x,y) &= d(y,x) \\\\\n\\tag{iii}  d(x,z) &\\le d(x,y)+d(y,z).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis suggests several possible strategies for defining a notion of\nnaturalness for classes. One could take into account facts about the\n\u201cshape\u201d of a class: for example, whether it is spherical\n(such that for some \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(z\\) belongs to it just in case\n\\(d(x,z)\\le d(x,y)\\)), or convex (such that whenever \\(x\\) and \\(z\\)\nbelong to it and \\(d(x,z)=d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\), \\(y\\) belongs to\n it).[11]\n One could also consider facts about its \u201csize\u201d,\ne.g.\u00a0the maximum degree of dissimilarity between any two of its\n members.[12]\n Or one could consider the extent of the gulf between a class and its\ncomplement: the minimum degree of dissimilarity between any member and\nany non-member.\n\nIf one is willing to help oneself to some notion like \u2018the\ndegree of dissimilarity between \\(x\\) as it is at world \\(w\\) and\n\\(y\\) as it is at world \\(w'\\)\u2019, one could use similar\nstrategies to analyse naturalness for properties. However, this notion\nof \u201ctransworld resemblance\u201d seems to cry out for further\nexplanation. It is also worth noting that this kind of analysis looks\ninhospitable to the idea that the description of the world in terms of\nperfectly natural properties is in any sense\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (see \u00a74.4.1 below): indeed, it would be\nrather surprising for multiple properties to be exactly tied\nfor first place on any similarity-based measure of naturalness.\n\nThe opposite project, of analysing similarity in terms of naturalness,\ncould be carried out in several ways. Assuming we are concerned with a\nrelatively intuitive notion of similarity on which everything is\nmaximally similar to itself, and on which objects can be more or less\nsimilar without sharing any perfectly natural properties, the\nprospects are best if we invoke a numerical measure of naturalness.\nGiven such a measure, one might propose the following analysis:\n\nDivision\n\nThe degree of dissimilarity between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the sum of the\ndegrees of naturalness of all the properties that divide \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) (i.e., are instantiated by \\(x\\) but not by \\(y\\) or by \\(y\\)\nbut not by\n \\(x\\)).[13]\n\n\nA nice feature of\n Division\n is that it automatically validates the pseudometric space axioms\n(i)\u2013(iii) above. (By contrast, if we measured the degree of\nsimilarity of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by summing the degrees of naturalness of\nthe properties shared by \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we would have to\nallow some objects\u2014namely, those that instantiate many natural\nproperties\u2014to be more similar to themselves than others.) But\nthe approach also faces several problems:\n\n\n\nIt is not obvious that there is a reasonable numerical measure of\nnaturalness on which the relevant sums are\n well-defined.[14]\n\n\n\nIt is not obvious how to reconcile Division with the evident\nvagueness and context-sensitivity of expressions like \u2018more\nsimilar than\u2019. It seems implausible that all of this variation\ncan be traced back to vagueness and context-sensitivity in \u2018more\nnatural than\u2019 in such a way that Division comes out\ntrue in all contexts. One might appeal here to quantifier domain\nrestriction: perhaps, in contexts where only psychological similarity\nmatters, Division is true so long as the universal quantifier\nover properties is understood as restricted to psychological\nproperties. However we may need more flexibility than this to allow\nboth for contexts where psychological similarity matters a lot but\nbodily similarity matters a little and for contexts where bodily\nsimilarity matters a lot and psychological similarity matters a\nlittle.\n\n\nDivision makes it hard to connect similarity to quantitative\ndifferences in the ways one might expect. Consider three triangles A,\nB, C, where A is equilateral with side length 1m; B is isosceles with\nside lengths 1m, 1m, 1.01m; and C is isosceles with side lengths 1m,\n1m, 1.1m. The paradigms we began with (and the\nsimplicity-of-definition idea, and the connections to mental and\nlinguistic content discussed\n \u00a74.7\n below) suggest that for most values of \\(x\\) other than 1, being\nisosceles with one side \\(x\\) times as long as the other two is\nmuch less natural than being equilateral. Given this, it\nlooks like A and B, being divided by being equilateral, may\nbe counted by Division as more dissimilar than triangles B\nand C are. This contrasts with a more familiar conception of\nsimilarity in this domain, on which the degree of dissimilarity\nbetween a 1,1,1 triangle and a 1,1,\\(x\\) triangle approaches 0 as\n\\(x\\) approaches 1.\n\n\nProblems arise even with continua of properties where there is no\nindependent reason to posit different degrees of naturalness. Consider\nmass. If we assign all mass-interval properties like having a mass\nbetween 100 and 105 kg positive naturalness scores, we will get\nthe disastrous result that any two objects that differ in mass are\ndissimilar to the same, infinite, degree. But if we assign them all a\nscore of zero, it seems impossible to recover the intuitive judgment\nthat objects whose masses differed by only 1% could resemble more\nclosely than any objects whose mass differed by 10% possibly could. We\nmight hope to thread the needle by saying that most mass-interval\nproperties score zero but a few (countably many) are natural enough to\nget positive scores. But this seems to require invidiously privileging\nsome units for mass over others, and will still make for\ncounterintuitive discontinuities in the similarity measure as\ndiscussed under\n (c).[15]\n\n\n\nProblem (a) is fairly specific to Division, but (b)\u2013(d)\nseem potentially challenging for other ways of cashing out the vague\nslogan \u201cnatural properties make for similarity\u201d.\n",
