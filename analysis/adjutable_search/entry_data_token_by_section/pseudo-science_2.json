    "main_text": "The \u201cpseudo\u201d of pseudoscience || Non-, un-, and pseudoscience\n3.1 Non-, un-, and pseudoscience\n\nThe phrases \u201cdemarcation of science\u201d and\n\u201cdemarcation of science from pseudoscience\u201d are often used\ninterchangeably, and many authors seem to have regarded them as equal\nin meaning. In their view, the task of drawing the outer boundaries of\nscience is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary\nbetween science and pseudoscience.\n\nThis picture is oversimplified. All non-science is not pseudoscience,\nand science has non-trivial borders to other non-scientific phenomena,\nsuch as metaphysics, religion, and various types of non-scientific\nsystematized knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548) proposed the term\n\u201cparascience\u201d to cover non-scientific practices that are\nnot pseudoscientific.) Science also has the internal demarcation\nproblem of distinguishing between good and bad science.\n\nA comparison of the negated terms related to science can contribute to\nclarifying the conceptual distinctions. \u201cUnscientific\u201d is a\nnarrower concept than \u201cnon-scientific\u201d (not scientific),\nsince the former but not the latter term implies some form of\ncontradiction or conflict with science. \u201cPseudoscientific\u201d\nis in its turn a narrower concept than \u201cunscientific\u201d. The\nlatter term differs from the former in covering inadvertent\nmismeasurements and miscalculations and other forms of bad science\nperformed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing to\nproduce good science.\n\nEtymology provides us with an obvious starting-point for clarifying\nwhat characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely\nnon- or un-scientific. \u201cPseudo-\u201d\n(\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03bf-) means false. In accordance\nwith this, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience\nas follows:\n\n\u201cA pretended or spurious science; a collection of related\nbeliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on\nscientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now\nhave.\u201d\n\n",
