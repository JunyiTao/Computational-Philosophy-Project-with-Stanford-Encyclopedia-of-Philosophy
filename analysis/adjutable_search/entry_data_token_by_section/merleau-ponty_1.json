    "main_text": "The Nature of Perception and The Structure of Behavior\n2. The Nature of Perception and The Structure of Behavior\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s lifelong interest in the philosophical status of\nperception is already reflected in his successful 1933 application for\na subvention to study the nature of perception, where he proposes to\nsynthesize recent findings in experimental psychology (especially\nGestalt psychology) and neurology to develop an alternative to\ndominant intellectualist accounts of perception inspired by critical\n(Kantian) philosophy. Interestingly, this early proposal emphasizes\nthe significance of the perception of one\u2019s own body for\ndistinguishing between the \u201cuniverse of perception\u201d and\nits intellectual reconstructions, and it gestures toward the\n\u201crealist philosophers of England and America\u201d (presumably\nWilliam James and A. N. Whitehead, as presented in Jean Wahl\u2019s\n1932 Vers le concret) for their insights into the\nirreducibility of the sensory and the concrete to intellectual\nrelations. While this initial proposal makes no mention of\nphenomenology, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s subsequent 1934 report on the\nyear\u2019s research, noting the limitations of approaching the\nphilosophical study of perception through empirical research alone,\nemphasizes the promise of Husserlian phenomenology for providing a\ndistinctively philosophical framework for the investigation of\npsychology. In particular, Merleau-Ponty mentions the distinction\nbetween the natural and transcendental attitudes and the\nintentionality of consciousness as valuable for \u201crevising the\nvery notions of consciousness and sensation\u201d (NP: 192/78). He\nalso cites approvingly Aron Gurwitsch\u2019s claim that\nHusserl\u2019s analyses \u201clead to the threshold of\nGestaltpsychologie\u201d, the second area of focus in this\nearly study. The Gestalt is \u201ca spontaneous organization of the\nsensory field\u201d in which there are \u201conly organizations,\nmore or less stable, more or less articulated\u201d (NP: 193/79).\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s brief summary of Gestalt psychology,\nanticipating research presented in his first two books, emphasizes the\nfigure-ground structure of perception, the phenomena of depth and\nmovement, and the syncretic perception of children. Nevertheless,\nMerleau-Ponty concludes\u2014again citing Gurwitsch\u2014that the\nepistemological framework of Gestalt psychology remains Kantian,\nrequiring that one look \u201cin a very different direction, for a\nvery different solution\u201d to the problem of the relation between\nthe world described naturalistically and the world as perceived (NP:\n198/82).\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s first book, The Structure of Behavior\n(SC), resumes the project of synthesizing and reworking the insights\nof Gestalt theory and phenomenology to propose an original\nunderstanding of the relationship between consciousness and nature.\nWhereas the neo-Kantian idealism then dominant in France (e.g.,\nL\u00e9on Brunschvicg, Jules Lachelier) treated nature as an\nobjective unity dependent on the synthetic activity of consciousness,\nthe realism of the natural sciences and empirical psychology assumed\nnature to be composed of external things and events interacting\ncausally. Merleau-Ponty argues that neither approach is tenable:\norganic life and human consciousness are emergent from a natural world\nthat is not reducible to its meaning for a mind; yet this natural\nworld is not the causal nexus of pre-existing objective realities,\nsince it is fundamentally composed of nested Gestalts, spontaneously\nemerging structures of organization at multiple levels and degrees of\nintegration. On the one hand, the idealist critique of naturalism\nshould be extended to the naturalistic assumptions framing Gestalt\ntheory. On the other hand, there is a justified truth in naturalism\nthat limits the idealist universalization of consciousness, and this\nis discovered when Gestalt structures are recognized to be\nontologically basic and the limitations of consciousness are thereby\nexposed. The notion of \u201cbehavior\u201d, taken by Merleau-Ponty\nas parallel to the phenomenological concept of\n\u201cexperience\u201d (in explicit contrast with the American\nschool of behaviorism), is a privileged starting point for the\nanalysis thanks to its neutrality with respect to classical\ndistinctions between the \u201cmental\u201d and the\n\u201cphysiological\u201d (SC: 2/4).\n\nThe Structure of Behavior first critiques traditional reflex\naccounts of the relation between stimulus and reaction in light of the\nfindings of Kurt Goldstein and other contemporary physiologists,\narguing that the organism is not passive but imposes its own\nconditions between the given stimulus and the expected response, so\nthat behavior remains inexplicable in purely anatomical or atomistic\nterms. Merleau-Ponty instead describes the nervous system as a\n\u201cfield of forces\u201d apportioned according to \u201cmodes of\npreferred distribution\u201d, a model inspired by Wolfgang\nK\u00f6hler\u2019s Gestalt physics (SC: 48/46). Both physiology and\nbehavior are \u201cforms\u201d, that is,\n\n\ntotal processes whose properties are not the sum of those which the\nisolated parts would possess\u2026. [T]here is form wherever the\nproperties of a system are modified by every change brought about in a\nsingle one of its parts and, on the contrary, are conserved when they\nall change while maintaining the same relationship among themselves.\n(SC: 49\u201350/47)\n\n\nForm or structure therefore describes dialectical, non-linear, and\ndynamic relationships that can function relatively autonomously and\nare irreducible to linear mechanical causality (see Thompson\n2007).\n\nThe critique of physiological atomism is also extended to theories of\nhigher behavior, such as Pavlov\u2019s theory of conditioned\nreflexes. Merleau-Ponty argues that such accounts rely on gratuitous\nhypotheses lacking experimental justification and cannot effectively\nexplain brain function or learning. In the case of brain function,\nexperimental work on brain damage demonstrates that localization\nhypotheses must be rejected in favor of a global process of neural\norganization comparable to the figure-ground structures of perceptual\norganization. Similarly, learning cannot be explained in terms of\ntrial-and-error fixing of habitual reactions, but instead involves a\ngeneral aptitude with respect to typical structures of situations.\nMerleau-Ponty proposes an alternative tripartite classification of\nbehavior according to the degree to which the structures toward which\nit is oriented emerge thematically from their content.\nSyncretic behaviors, typical of simpler organisms such as\nants or toads, respond to all stimuli as analogues of vital situations\nfor which the organism\u2019s responses are instinctually prescribed\nby its \u201cspecies a priori\u201d, with no possibility for\nadaptive learning or improvisation. Amovable behaviors are\noriented toward signals of varying complexity that are not a function\nof the organism\u2019s instinctual equipment and can lead to genuine\nlearning. Here the organism, guided by its vital norms, responds to\nsignals as relational structures rather than as objective properties\nof things. Drawing on K\u00f6hler\u2019s experimental work with\nchimpanzees, Merleau-Ponty argues that even intelligent non-human\nanimals lack an orientation toward objective things, which emerges\nonly at the level of symbolic behavior. While amovable\nbehavior remains attached to immediate functional structures, symbolic\nbehavior (here limited to humans) is open to virtual, expressive, and\nrecursive relationships across structures, making possible the human\norientation toward objectivity, truth, creativity, and freedom from\nbiologically determined norms.\n\nMore generally, Merleau-Ponty proposes that matter, life, and mind are\nincreasingly integrative levels of Gestalt structure, ontologically\ncontinuous but structurally discontinuous, and distinguished by the\ncharacteristic properties emergent at each integrative level of\ncomplexity. A form is defined here as\n\n\na field of forces characterized by a law which has no meaning outside\nthe limits of the dynamic structure considered, and which on the other\nhand assigns its properties to each internal point so much so that\nthey will never be absolute properties, properties of this\npoint. (SC: 148/137\u201338)\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty argues that this understanding extends to all physical\nlaws, which \u201cexpress a structure and have meaning only within\nthis structure\u201d; the laws of physics always refer back to\n\u201ca sensible or historical given\u201d and ultimately to the\nhistory of the universe (SC: 149/138, 157/145). At the level of life,\nform is characterized by a dialectical relation between the organism\nand its environment that is a function of the organism\u2019s vital\nnorms, its \u201coptimal conditions of activity and its proper manner\nof realizing equilibrium\u201d, which express its style or\n\u201cgeneral attitude toward the world\u201d (SC: 161/148). Living\nthings are not oriented toward an objective world but toward an\nenvironment that is organized meaningfully in terms of their\nindividual and specific style and vital goals.\n\nMind, the symbolic level of form that Merleau-Ponty identifies with\nthe human, is organized not toward vital goals but by the\ncharacteristic structures of the human world: tools, language,\nculture, and so on. These are not originally encountered as things or\nideas, but rather as \u201csignificative intentions\u201d embodied\nwithin the world. Mind or consciousness cannot be defined formally in\nterms of self-knowledge or representation, then, but is essentially\nengaged in the structures and actions of the human world and\nencompasses all of the diverse intentional orientations of human life.\nWhile mind integrates within itself the subordinate structures of\nmatter and life, it goes beyond these in its thematic orientation\ntoward structures as such, which is the condition for such\ncharacteristically human symbolic activities as language and\nexpression, the creation of new structures beyond those set by vital\nneeds, and the power of choosing and varying points of view (which\nmake truth and objectivity possible). In short, mind as a second-order\nor recursive structure is oriented toward the virtual rather than\nsimply toward the real. Ideally, the subordinate structure of life\nwould be fully absorbed into the higher order of mind in a fully\nintegrated human being; the biological would be transcended by the\n\u201cspiritual\u201d. But integration is never perfect or complete,\nand mind can never be detached from its moorings in a concrete and\nembodied situation.\n\nMerleau-Ponty emphasizes throughout The Structure of Behavior\nthat form, even though ontologically fundamental, cannot be accounted\nfor in the terms of traditional realism; since form is fundamentally\nperceptual, an \u201cimmanent signification\u201d, it retains an\nessential relationship with consciousness. But the \u201cperceptual\nconsciousness\u201d at stake here is not the transcendental\nconsciousness of critical philosophy. The last chapter of The\nStructure of Behavior clarifies this revised understanding of\nconsciousness in dialogue with the classical problem of the relation\nbetween the soul and the body in order to account for the relative\ntruths of both transcendental philosophy and naturalism. The issue\nconcerns how to reconcile the perspective of consciousness as\n\u201cuniversal milieu\u201d (i.e., transcendental consciousness)\nwith consciousness as \u201cenrooted in the subordinated\ndialectics\u201d, that is, as a Gestalt emerging from lower-order\nGestalts (i.e., perceptual consciousness) (SC: 199/184). In the\nnatural attitude of our pre-reflective lives, we are committed to the\nview that our perceptual experience of things is always situated and\nperspectival (i.e., that physical objects are presented through\n\u201cprofiles\u201d, Husserl\u2019s Abschattungen), but\nalso that we thereby experience things \u201cin themselves\u201d, as\nthey really are in the mind-independent world; the perspectival\ncharacter of our opening onto the world is not a limitation of our\naccess but rather the very condition of the world\u2019s disclosure\nin its inexhaustibility. At the level of this prereflective faith in\nthe world, there is no dilemma of the soul\u2019s separation from the\nbody; \u201cthe soul remains coextensive with nature\u201d (SC:\n203/189).\n\nThis prereflective unity eventually splinters under our awareness of\nillness, illusion, and anatomy, which teach us to separate nature,\nbody, and thought into distinct orders of events partes extra\npartes. This culminates in a naturalism that cannot account for\nthe originary situation of perception that it displaces, yet on which\nit tacitly relies; perception requires an \u201cinternal\u201d\nanalysis, paving the way for transcendental idealism\u2019s treatment\nof subject and object as \u201cinseparable correlatives\u201d (SC:\n215/199). But transcendental idealism in the critical tradition\nsubsequently goes too far: by taking consciousness as \u201cmilieu of\nthe universe, presupposed by every affirmation of the world\u201d, it\nobscures the original character of the perceptual relation and\nculminates in \u201cthe dialectic of the epistemological subject and\nthe scientific object\u201d (SC: 216/200, 217/201). Merleau-Ponty\naims to integrate the truth of naturalism and transcendental thought\nby reinterpreting both through the concept of structure, which\naccounts for the unity of soul and body as well as their relative\ndistinction. Against the conception of transcendental consciousness as\na pure spectator correlated with the world, Merleau-Ponty insists that\nmind is an accomplishment of structural integration that remains\nessentially conditioned by the matter and life in which it is\nembodied; the truth of naturalism lies in the fact that such\nintegration is essentially fragile and incomplete. Since\n\u201cintegration is never absolute and always fails\u201d, the\ndualism of mind and body\n\n\nis not a simple fact; it is founded in principle\u2014all integration\npresupposing the normal functioning of subordinated formations, which\nalways demand their own due. (SC: 226\u201327/210)\n\n\nThe Structure of Behavior concludes with a call for further\ninvestigation of \u201cperceptual consciousness\u201d, a task taken\nup by its sequel, Phenomenology of Perception. In the\nconcluding pages of Structure, Merleau-Ponty offers a\npreliminary sketch of phenomenologically inspired approaches to the\n\u201cproblem of perception\u201d that set the stage for his\nsubsequent work, emphasizing (a) the difference between what is\ndirectly given as an aspect of individual lived experience and\nintersubjective significations that are only encountered virtually;\nand (b) the distinctiveness of one\u2019s own body, which is never\nexperienced directly as one objective thing among many. The book\nconcludes by identifying the \u201cproblem of perception\u201d as\nits encompassing concern:\n\n\nCan one conceptualize perceptual consciousness without eliminating it\nas an original mode; can one maintain its specificity without\nrendering inconceivable its relation to intellectual consciousness?\n(SC: 241/224)\n\n\nThe solution requires a \u201creturn to perception as to a type of\noriginary experience\u201d by means of an \u201cinversion of the\nnatural movement of consciousness\u201d, an inversion that\nMerleau-Ponty here equates with Husserl\u2019s phenomenological\nreduction (SC: 236/220). If successful, this rehabilitation of the\nstatus of perception would lead to a redefinition of transcendental\nphilosophy \u201cin such a way as to integrate with it the very\nphenomenon of the real\u201d (SC: 241/224).\n",
