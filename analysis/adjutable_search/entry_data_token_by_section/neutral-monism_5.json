    "main_text": "Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism || William James\n2.2 William James\n\nWilliam James (1842\u20131910) uses the term \u201cradical\nempiricism\u201d for the view he sets forth in James 1912\u2014the\nview that has become a paradigm of neutral monism. His critique of the\nrelational account of experience\u2014according to which the self\ndirects an act onto an object\u2014was the model upon which Russell\nlater shaped his analysis of experience. James presents this argument\nas an attack on a particular conception of consciousness present in\nvarious forms in the Neo-Kantian, early analytic, and phenomenological\ntraditions. Roughly, it is the notion of consciousness as a diaphanous\nor transparent relation, medium, or container by means of which the\nobjects of consciousness are presented or represented to us. But the\nconsciousness that makes this kind of object presentation possible\neludes our grasp. This thin notion of consciousness is the one James\nwants to eliminate:\n\nI believe that \u2018consciousness,\u2019 when once it has\nevaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point of\ndisappearing altogether. It is the name of a nonentity, and has no\nright to a place among first principles. Those who still cling to it\nare clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumor left behind by the\ndisappearing \u2018soul\u2019 upon the air of philosophy. (James\n1904b: 2)\n\n\nHis radical proposal is to simply discard this shadowy something and\nto make do with what remains, with what used to be the object of the\nconscious act. He introduces the term \u201cpure experience\u201d to\nstand for this datum. Prior to any further categorization, pure\nexperience is, according to James, neutral\u2014neither mental nor\nphysical:\n\nThe instant field of the present is at all times what I call the\n\u2018pure\u2019 experience. It is only virtually or potentially\neither object or subject as yet. For the time being, it is plain,\nunqualified actuality, or existence, a simple that. (James 1904b: 23)\n\n\nMind and matter, knower and known, thought and thing, representation\nand represented are then interpreted as resulting from different\nfunctional groupings/carvings of the continuous flux of pure\nexperience for different purposes (see James 1905: 64).\n\nIn perceptual knowledge perceiver and perceived fuse or merge (James\nuses both terms): one bit of pure experience is the thing perceived as\nwell as the perceiving of this thing. The difference lies only in how\nthis single portion of pure experience is related to other portions of\npure experience:\n\nThe paper seen and the seeing of it are only two names for one\nindivisible fact which, properly named, is the datum, the\nphenomenon, or the experience. The paper is in the mind and the\nmind is around the paper, because paper and mind are only two names\nthat are given later to the one experience, when, taken in a larger\nworld of which it forms a part, its connections are traced in\ndifferent directions. To know immediately, then, or intuitively,\nis for mental content and object to be identical. (James 1895:\n110)\n\n\nConceptual knowledge is more complex. In the simplest case of\nconceptual representation we are dealing with\n\ntwo pieces of actual experience belonging to the same\nsubject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience\nbetween them. (James 1904a: 53)\n\n\nThe first piece of pure experience is the thought\u2014the episode of\nthinking as well as the content that is thought\u2014perhaps about\nHarvard\u2019s Memorial Hall, as in James\u2019s famous example (see\nJames 1904a: 55ff). And, in the simplest case, the second piece of\npure experience is the thing\u2014Memorial Hall\u2014that was\nthought of, as well as the perceiving of Memorial Hall. The thought\nhas, let\u2019s suppose, led us to Memorial Hall and now we stand in\nfront of it and see it. It is this function of leading (about\nthe details of which James has much to say) that constitutes the\nthought\u2019s intentionality, that constitutes the fact that the\nthought was a thought about a certain thing. Once the thought has led\none to the Hall,\n\nthe percept not only verifies the concept, proves its\nfunction of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept\u2019s\nexistence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries\ncreates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was,\nbecause it now proves itself to be, what the concept \u2018had in\nmind\u2019. (James 1904a: 60\u20131)\n\n\nThis is James\u2019s way of reconstructing the idea of representation\nin a way that does not invoke suspect mental powers of intrinsic\nintentionality. He values this as a signal achievement of his radical\nempiricism:\n\nThe towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in\nthe fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its\nrepresentative, not in any quasi-miraculous\n\u2018epistemological\u2019 sense, but in the definite practical\nsense of being its substitute in various operations,\nsometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to its\nassociates and results. (James 1904a: 61)\n\n\nNot all conceptual experience results in knowledge. If the process of\nleading does not get started, or fails to arrive at an experience of\ntermination, there is nothing that the first piece of experience gets\nto know. In that case the representation is empty or false.\n\nThe essays in which James sets out his radical empiricism are among\nthe most influential and most readable documents of the neutral\nmonistic literature. It is probably fair to say that James converted\nRussell to neutral monism. And his influence on American neutral\nmonists during the early decades of the twentieth century is massive\n(see 2.4 below). The primary source for James\u2019s views on neutral\nmonism are the essays collected in his 1912.\n",
