    "main_text": "Legal principles to remedy defective positive law || Natural law and (purely) positive law as concurrent dimensions of legal reasoning\n3.2 Natural law and (purely) positive law as concurrent dimensions of legal reasoning\n\n\nNatural law theory of law thus finds itself, in this respect,\napproximated to by Ronald Dworkin\u2019s account of law and adjudication,\nnot only in frontier situations like Nuremberg but also in the\nday-to-day working of a sophisticated legal system. Normal\nadjudication and judicial reasoning has two dimensions or criteria for\ndistinguishing correctness from incorrectness in judgments. One\ndimension comprises social-fact sources (statutes, precedents,\npractice, etc.), called by Dworkin \u201clegal materials.\u201d The\nother dimension comprises moral standards, presumptively those\nprevalent in the judge\u2019s community but in the last analysis just those\nstandards that the judge can accept as in truth morally sound. An\ninterpretation of our law which is morally sounder will be legally\ncorrect even if it fits the legal materials less closely than\nalternative interpretations, provided that it fits those social-fact\nsources \u201cenough.\u201d The moral standards thus applied, which\nDworkin (in line with natural law theory) treats as capable of being\nmorally objective and true, thus function as a direct source of law (or justification for judicial decision)\nand, in a certain sense, as already law, except when their fit with\nthe whole set of social-fact sources in the relevant community is so\nweak that it would be more accurate (according to Dworkin) to say that\njudges who apply them are applying morality not law (and thus, if they\nsaid they were applying law, would be mistaken or lying\u2014a lie\nwhich Dworkin considers sometimes commendable). Dworkin 1978,\n326\u20137, 340. \n\n\nA theory of law which, unlike Dworkin\u2019s, places itself plainly in the\ntradition of natural law theorizing will be likely to depart from\nthese positions in two ways. (i) It will not accept Dworkin\u2019s thesis\nthat even in very hard cases there is one uniquely correct answer in\nlaw; it will deny his assumption that there is a uniquely correct and\nrationally identifiable measure of how much fit with existing legal\nmaterials (social-fact sources) is \u201cenough\u201d (necessary and\nsufficient) to license using moral standards to identify the legally\ncorrect interpretation of the law. In the absence of such a single\nmeasure, legal reasoning must often\u2014and in very hard cases,\nusually\u2014be content to show that two or three alternative\ninterpretations are distinguished from an indefinitely large number of\nother interpretations by being correct, that is, not wrong (albeit not\nuniquely correct).  (ii) When judges, in order to avoid grave\ninjustice, depart from the settled understanding of the law (and\nperhaps from the clear terms of a decree) and apply an alternative,\nmorally mandated interpretation, regarding themselves as licensed to\ndo so by the higher law of reason, nature and humanity, they need not\nbe lying if they say that in doing so they are both rectifying\nand applying the law (of their state).
