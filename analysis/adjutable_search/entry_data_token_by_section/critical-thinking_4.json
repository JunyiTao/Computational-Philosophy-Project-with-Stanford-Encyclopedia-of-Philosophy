Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\n\nRash: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\n\nCandidate: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\n\n\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\n\n\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n",
