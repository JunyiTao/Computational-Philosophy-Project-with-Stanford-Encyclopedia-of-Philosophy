    "preamble": "\n\nKant\u2019s philosophy focuses on the power and limits of reason. Two\nquestions are central. In his theoretical philosophy, Kant asks\nwhether reasoning can give us metaphysical knowledge. In particular,\ncan reason ground insights that go \u201cbeyond\u201d\n(meta) the physical world, as \u201crationalist\u201d\nphilosophers such as Leibniz and Descartes claimed? In his practical\nphilosophy, Kant asks whether reason can guide action and justify\nmoral principles. \u201cEmpiricist\u201d philosophers claimed that\nonly feelings can motivate us to act; reason cannot. In Hume\u2019s\nfamous words: \u201cReason is wholly inactive, and can never be the\nsource of so active a principle as conscience, or a sense of\nmorals\u201d (Treatise, 3.1.1.11).\n\nAgainst rationalist metaphysics, Kant claims that reasoning faces\nstrict limits. Reason cannot give us knowledge of God or a world\nbeyond the senses; reasoning falls into contradiction and confusion if\nit does not respect these boundaries.\n\nAgainst the empiricist account of motivation and morality, Kant argues\nthat reason has a vital power. Reason enables us to act on principles\nthat we can share with other rational beings. In a world of limits,\nreason reveals human\n freedom.[1]\n\nThis entry has the following structure. The first section sets out the\nrole that reason plays in Kant\u2019s account of knowledge and\nmetaphysics. This focuses on the Critique of Pure Reason or\n\u201cfirst Critique\u201d (1781, second edition 1787). The\nsecond section examines his moral philosophy. This focuses on his\nCritique of Practical Reason or \u201csecond\nCritique\u201d (1788). Reflecting Kant\u2019s own works and\nmost of the secondary literature, these two sections are relatively\nindependent. The third section therefore considers the relations\nbetween theoretical and practical reason. Since Kant rarely discusses\nreason as a whole, his general view is a matter of interpretation:\nOnora O\u2019Neill has given the most prominent account. The\nconcluding remarks stress the philosophical interest of her unified\ninterpretation.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations\n\nIn the first half of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues\nthat we obtain substantive knowledge of the world through two\ncapacities: sensibility and understanding. Empirical judgments depend\non both sensory experience and concept formation.\nKant emphasizes the solidity of empirical knowledge gained this\nway.\n\nIn the next large section, Kant discusses \u201ctheoretical\nreason\u201d\u2014especially philosophical reasoning. The\n\u201cTranscendental Dialectic\u201d attacks philosophical efforts\nto gain knowledge of a \u201ctranscendent\u201d world, that is, a\nworld beyond that revealed by the senses. \u201cDialectic,\u201d\nsays Kant, is \u201ca logic of illusion\u201d (A293/B349).\nHere, reason appears mainly as a source of empty or false ideas.\n\nMany readers fall away before the final section of the book, where\nKant reviews his overall method\u2014his own use of \u201cpure\nreason.\u201d The closing \u201cTranscendental Doctrine of\nMethod\u201d considers reason in terms of its\n\u201cdiscipline,\u201d \u201ccanon,\u201d\n\u201carchitectonic,\u201d and \u201chistory.\u201d\n\nThis makes it easy to interpret the Critique of Pure Reason\nas simply critical of reason\u2014as dismissing its claims to give us\nknowledge. But if this were all that Kant intended, how should we\nunderstand his own philosophical reasoning? Kant certainly wants to\nshow the limits of reason. But he also needs to show how reason can\nplay a constructive role. He does this in at least three ways: he\nrelates reason to empirical truth (\u00a71.1\n below); he explores reason\u2019s role in scientific enquiry\n (\u00a71.2\n below); and he explains the benefits of appreciating reason\u2019s\nlimits (\u00a71.3\n below).[2]\n\nIn addition, when we engage in philosophical reasoning, we ought to\nunderstand the capacity that we are using. As Kant puts it, reason\nmust take on \u201cthe most difficult of all its tasks, namely, that\nof self-knowledge\u201d (Axi). The first Critique begins\nthis task, but does not complete it (\u00a71.4\n below).\n1.1 Reason and empirical truth\n\nReason has an important role in our pursuit of knowledge. Kant writes:\n\u201cthe law of reason to seek unity is necessary, since without it\nwe would have no reason, and without that, no coherent use of the\nunderstanding, and, lacking that, no sufficient mark of empirical\ntruth\u2026\u201d\n (A651/B679).[3]\n Kant says relatively little to develop this claim, and the issue has\nnot attracted much commentary. (But cf. Walker 1989: Ch. 4; Guyer and\nWalker 1990;\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment,\n \u00a71.3.)[4]\n\nHowever, the basic idea is clear from his text. We form judgments\nabout the world around us all the time. We see a hand in front of us\nand judge it to exist; after a dream, we judge ourselves to have been\ndreaming and the dream\u2019s contents to be illusory; we see the sun\nrise and assume that it orbits the earth. (Obviously this last\njudgment is false: see\n \u00a71.2\n below.) Kant devotes much effort to show how all these judgments rely\non categories. Fundamental concepts such as cause and effect\nstructure all our judgments. A belief that conforms to these\ncategories meets the \u201cformal\u201d conditions of truth.\nHowever, unless we are fundamentally confused about something, all our\nbeliefs meet these\n conditions.[5]\n So how do we decide which of our beliefs are true, and which\nmistaken?\n\nKant begins by noting that only judgments can be mistaken:\n\u201cIt is correctly said that the senses do not err; yet not\nbecause they always judge correctly, but because they do not judge at\nall\u201d (A293). For example, there is no error involved in\ndreaming, however incoherent or fantastical the dream may be. But if\nsomeone got confused and supposed that a dreamed-of event had really\nhappened, then she would be making a judgment\u2014a false one. So\nKant claims, \u201cerror is only effected through the unnoticed\ninfluence of sensibility on understanding, through which it happens\nthat the subjective grounds of the judgment join with the objective\nones\u201d (A294). In the example, someone confuses a subjective\nground of judgment (\u201cI had this dream\u201d) with an\nobjective one (\u201cthese events took place\u201d). As\nKant puts it in the Prolegomena:\n\nThe difference between truth and dream\u2026 is not decided through\nthe quality of the representations that are referred to objects, for\nthey are the same in both, but through their connection according to\nrules that determine the combination of representations in the concept\nof an object, and how far they can or cannot stand together in one\nexperience. (4:290)\n\n\nHow does reasoning help here? In the famous \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d (added to the second edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason), Kant writes: \u201cWhether this or that putative\nexperience is not mere imagination [or dream or delusion, etc.] must\nbe ascertained according to its particular determinations and through\nits coherence with the criteria of all actual experience\u201d\n(B279).\n\nTo see what Kant means, consider a simple example. Suppose that our\ndreamer believes they have won a lottery, but then starts to doubt\nthis belief. To decide whether it is true, they must ask how far such\na belief connects up with their other judgments, and those of other\n people.[6]\n If it fails to connect up (they check the winning numbers, perhaps,\nand find no match with the actual ticket), the dreamer must conclude\nthat the belief was false.\n\nWe can also see the logic here in terms of Kant\u2019s claim that\nreason is \u201cthe faculty of the unity of the rules of\nunderstanding under principles\u201d (A302/B359). One fundamental\nprinciple of experience is that we inhabit a single world in space and\ntime. Therefore, all true judgments must find a place within a single,\nunified experience of the world. Reason seeks consistency. It helps\nseparate factual mistakes from genuine knowledge by referring to this\nunifying condition.\n1.2 Reason in science\n\nThe principle of reasoned unity also applies to scientific judgments\nand theories. However, it takes a more complex form, since science\nseeks universal laws.\n\nKant claims that reason is \u201cthe origin of certain concepts and\nprinciples\u201d (A299/B355) independent from those of sensibility\nand understanding. Kant refers to these as \u201ctranscendental\nideas\u201d (A311/B368) or \u201cideas of [pure] reason\u201d\n(A669/B697). He also defines reason as a \u201cfaculty of\nprinciples\u201d (A299/B356). But what are these concepts and\nprinciples, and can they be justified? Since Kant also argues that\n\u201cideas of reason\u201d often lead to error and contradiction,\nthese are serious questions.\n\nOne sort of error arises when we claim knowledge of objects beyond\nsensory experience, such as God or the soul. Another sort arises when\nwe form \u201ctranscendental ideas.\u201d We may try to\nconceptualize the ultimate basis of everything that exists, such as\nthe universe as a whole. Kant refers to these as \u201cworld\nwholes\u201d or cosmological ideas. As discussed in a moment\n (\u00a71.3),\n when we claim objective knowledge about these, we fall into\ncontradictions or \u201cantinomies.\u201d For example, Kant holds\nthat we can argue equally well for the opposing claims: that the\nuniverse has a beginning in time and that it does not.\n\nScientific enquiry assumes that the world forms a well-ordered,\nsystematic unity where all events can be subsumed under causal laws.\nThis is not just the idea that events have causes\u2014an inescapable\nassumption that Kant refers to as a category of the understanding.\nRather, the claim is that universal laws underlie all particular\nrelations of cause and effect. This is what Kant has in mind when he\nspeaks of the \u201cunity of reason\u201d in the first\nCritique. (See e.g. A302/B359, A665/B693, A680/B780.)\n\nAs an illustration, consider Copernicus\u2019s hypothesis that the\nearth orbits the sun. This hypothesis contradicts our everyday\nperceptions\u2014perceptions that we normally rely on without\nquestion. Historically, Galileo\u2019s observations were a turning\npoint. The telescope gave a much more extensive picture of planets and\nstars, casting doubt on our everyday perspective. Although a new\nscientific tool is involved (the telescope), the reasoning is quite\nordinary. In the face of inconsistent appearances, we must decide\nwhich perspective to endorse\u2014just as we may judge that an\nimpression is merely an optical illusion, or a dream is only a\n dream.[7]\n\nFor Kant\u2019s account of scientific reasoning, Newton is more\nimportant (Bxxii n; cf.\n \u00a71.4\n below). Newton\u2019s laws of gravity unify Copernicus\u2019s\nhypothesis and Galileo\u2019s observations\u2014and much more\nbesides (A663/B691). The laws are universal: they extend to all\nheavenly objects, not only the sun\u2019s motion relative to the\nearth.\n\nBut we can never experience all events. However extensive our\nexperiences may be, and however many people\u2019s experiences we\ndraw on, experience is finite. As such, it can never justify the\nprinciple that laws are genuinely universal, or that these laws will\ncontinue to hold in the\n future.[8]\n Kant argues that reason is justified in adopting these principles\n(and others). However, he makes a subtle distinction. These principles\nshould guide scientific inquiry\u2014in Kant\u2019s term, they are\n\u201cregulative.\u201d But they do not provide knowledge\nof the world\u2014as Kant puts it, they are not\n\u201cconstitutive.\u201d (See e.g., Buchdahl 1992; Friedman 1992c;\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment,\n \u00a74.2.)\n\nFor Kant, the categories of the understanding are the paradigm example\nof constitutive ideas. For example, the category of causation\nstructures all our knowledge. We do not perceive cause and effect\ndirectly. Instead, experience is only possible because we\nassume events have causes. (See\n Kant and Hume on causality\n for more detail.) Although we can make mistakes about specific\ncauses, we also have the following knowledge about cause and effect:\nwe know that every event has a cause. The category of cause\nand effect constitutes experience\u2014it enables us to\nexperience the world.\n\nBy contrast, regulative principles govern our investigations, without\noffering any guarantee as to what we will find. Science seeks the\ngreatest possible completeness and systematicity (cf. Guyer 1989 &\n2006, Abela 2006, Mudd 2017). Although scientists often pursue highly\nspecialized inquiries, science also has a regulative goal. It\nmust integrate all findings under the most all-encompassing laws.\nNewton\u2019s laws have been modified by general relativity, for\nexample, pointing to the open-ended, \u201cregulative\u201d nature\nof this quest. Likewise, scientists are still looking for a\nsatisfactory way to integrate general relativity with quantum\n mechanics.[9]\n\nWe cannot know in advance how far science will succeed, or that nature\nis constituted as wholly law-like. This would represent a\n\u201cconstitutive principle,\u201d a \u201ccosmological\u201d\nknowledge claim which goes beyond any possible experiences. Instead,\nthe principle of seeking law-like unity represents a\n\u201cmaxim\u201d or regulative principle of reason\n(A666/B694). Rather than determining what science must find, such\nprinciples guide scientific practice.\n\nKant\u2019s account of science, and especially the role of\n\u201cteleological\u201d or purposive judgment, is further developed\nin the Critique of the Power of Judgment. See Guyer 1990,\nFreudiger 1996, and Nuzzo 2005, as well as\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology\n (\u00a73). On Kant\u2019s account of science more generally, see\nWartenberg 1992, Buchdahl 1992, Friedman 1992b & 2013, Mudd 2016\nand Breitenbach 2018. On reason and science, see Neiman 1994: Ch. 2\nand Grier 2001: Ch. 8. The entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of science\n considers Kant\u2019s view of the natural sciences, especially\nphysics.\n1.3 The limits of reason\n\nThis is the best-known point, and is considered in detail in the entry\non\n Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics.\n Kant demolishes a series of supposed proofs of the existence of God\n(\u201cThe Ideal of Pure Reason\u201d) and the soul (\u201cThe\nParalogisms\u201d).\n\nHe also demonstrates that it is equally possible to prove some\njudgments about \u201cworld wholes\u201d as it is to prove their\nopposites. \u201cThe Antinomies\u201d contain arguments that space\nmust be unbounded and that it must be bounded, that there\nmust be an absolutely first cause and that there cannot be\n(the problem of freedom in the famous \u201cThird\nAntinomy\u201d).\n\nThese sections have always been regarded as the most convincing parts\nof the book. Mendelssohn spoke for many of Kant\u2019s contemporaries\nin calling him the \u201call-destroyer.\u201d These contradictions\nshow the limits of metaphysical knowledge.\n\nKant\u2019s intentions are not destructive, however. Philosophers\nmust understand the capacity that they rely on\u2014that is,\nreason\n (\u00a71.4).\n Theologians and metaphysicians have often claimed knowledge that\nreason cannot deliver. This has led to empty battles that invite\nskepticism about reason. After all, if reasoning leads to inconsistent\nclaims, how can we rely on it? By contrast, Kant aims to clear the\nground: reason has limits but it is not powerless; philosophical\nreasoning can justify some claims. These include the claims\ndiscussed above\n (\u00a71.1\n and\n \u00a71.2)\n as well as reason\u2019s practical role\n (\u00a72\n below). Gava & Willaschek (forthcoming)\u00a0usefully stress this\naspect of the first Critique.\n\nIn the Doctrine of Method (the last, least-read part of the first\nCritique) Kant refers to the biblical story of Babel\n(Genesis, Ch. 11). The literal meaning of \u201cBabel\u201d\nis \u201cconfusion\u201d\u2014God punished human beings\u2019\nattempt to build \u201ca tower that would reach the heavens\u201d\n(A707/B735) by giving them many different languages. Since they were\nunable to understand one another, they could no longer cooperate in\nsuch hubristic\n ventures.[10]\n Again and again, reason returns to some simple ideas with towering\nimplications\u2014the immortal soul, God, freedom. Worse, it cooks\n up[11]\n more or less convincing proofs of these.\n\nSince these ideas reach beyond experience of a shared world, people\nlack a shared way to test them. Perhaps they emptily repeat other\npeople\u2019s words without real understanding; quite possibly, they\ncome up with conflicting versions of these ideas. They talk past one\nanother; they might as well speak different languages. Most likely,\nthey will fall into conflict, or find peace only by submitting to an\nunreasoned authority. In metaphysics, Kant refers to \u201cthe\nridiculous despotism of the schools\u201d\n (Bxxxv).[12]\n In practical life, however, despotism is far from ridiculous: it is\nthe brutal last resort for securing order when people adopt\nconflicting ideas and pursue conflicting goals. Kant often alludes to\nHobbes, who holds that peace is only possible if an unaccountable\nsovereign \u201coverawes\u201d every member of\n society.[13]\n On many interpretations, Kantian reason aims to build intersubjective\norder and avoid the dangers of Babel-like hubris, conflict and\ndespotism (Saner 1967, O\u2019Neill 1989, Neiman 1994).\n\nIn the Preface to the second edition of the Critique, Kant\nmakes a famous claim: \u201cI had to deny knowledge in order\nto make room for faith\u201d (Bxxx). Human beings cannot\nhave knowledge of the world as a whole. They cannot know entities that\ntranscend this world, such as the immortal soul or God. We cannot\nexperience these things through our senses; reason cannot supply such\nknowledge. However, Kant argues that knowledge is not the\nprimary end of reason. Only our role within the world\n\u201cnecessarily interests everyone\u201d (A839n/B867n). Kant\nrejects a \u201cscholastic\u201d or knowledge-oriented notion of\nphilosophy. Instead, he offers a \u201ccosmic\u201d or\nworld-oriented one (A838/B866; cf. Ypi 2021: Ch. 1 and Ferrarin\n2015).\n\nKant proposes three questions that answer \u201call the interest of\nmy reason\u201d: \u201cWhat can I know?\u201d \u201cWhat must I\ndo?\u201d and \u201cWhat may I hope?\u201d (A805/B833). We have\nseen his answer to the first question: we can only know the world as\nrevealed through the senses. Kant does not answer the second question\nuntil the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, four years\nlater. (Arguably, he sees no need to answer the question in this form,\nsince he is confident that people have long known how they ought to\n act.[14])\n But the first Critique does include some observations on\nhope\u2014that is, faith in God and a future world. Kant argues that\nknowledge of these things is not only impossible\u2014it would also\ncorrupt practical reasoning. Rather than doing good for its own sake,\nwe would be motivated by external incentives\u2014eternal punishment\nand heavenly reward. Kant later calls this \u201cheteronomy,\u201d\nas opposed to \u201cautonomy\u201d\u2014our own personal commitment\nto morality. Despite this, Kant argues that we have legitimate reasons\nto hope for God and immortality. We must also have confidence in our\nfreedom to act morally. He connects and develops these claims in the\nsecond Critique, as discussed below\n (\u00a72.3).\n\nSince \u201creason\u201d is a mental capacity, it may seem strange\nto speak of it having \u201cneeds\u201d or \u201cinterests.\u201d\nThe basic idea is that there are preconditions for successfully\nexercising this capacity. For finite human beings, reason is not\ntransparent or infallible, as some rationalist philosophers seemed to\nthink. We may think we are reasoning, when actually we are\ncooking up false rationalizations and self-deceptions. We may think we\nare reasoning well, when we argue toward transcendent truths,\nsuch as the existence of God or a future world. So reason has an\n\u201cinterest\u201d in appreciating its own limits, if it is to be\nvalid. As Kleingeld puts it, reason \u201cneeds to present itself to\nitself in the process of gaining clarity about its own workings\u201d\n(1998a: 97)\u2014above all, the principles that it must give to\nitself. As the next section discusses, this means that Kant views\nreason as essentially self-reflexive.\n1.4 Reason\u2019s self-knowledge\n\nThe first Critique argues that there has, so far, been no\nreal progress in metaphysics. In the second edition Preface, Kant\nproudly proclaims that his book has finally put metaphysics on\n\u201cthe sure path of a science\u201d (Bvii; cf. Axiii). So we\nmight ask: what is the relation of metaphysics\u2014or philosophical\nreasoning more generally\u2014to areas of human enquiry that generate\ncertainty (geometry and mathematics) and expand knowledge (science in\ngeneral)?\n\nKant insists that mathematics cannot provide a model for philosophy.\n\u201cMathematics gives the most resplendent example of pure reason\nhappily expanding itself without assistance from experience\u201d\n(A712/B740). But metaphysics cannot follow this\n course.[15]\n This is not simply a rhetorical point, since many of Kant\u2019s\npredecessors had tried to do exactly this\u2014Spinoza\u2019s\nEthics is one example, Christian Wolff\u2019s philosophy\nanother (see Gava 2018). Kant\u2019s basic argument is that\nmathematicians are justified in constructing objects or\naxioms a priori, because they can work with pure intuitions\u2014like\na line or the form of a triangle, for example\u2014rather than being\nrestricted only to the analysis of concepts. (See the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics.)\n Philosophers cannot follow this sort of procedure because they have\nno right to assume any a priori intuitions or axioms about\nmetaphysical entities. Attempts that rely on such claims have only\nproduced \u201cso many houses of cards\u201d (A727/B755).\n\nThe empirical sciences also offer an unpromising model for\nmetaphysics. In the first place, Kant has argued that experience\ncannot reveal metaphysical entities. We could never know, for\ninstance, that we are free: like everything else we can know, human\nconduct is open to causal explanation. Second, experience cannot\ngenerate the sort of necessity Kant associates with metaphysical\nconclusions. Experience reveals contingent facts: it cannot\nshow that such-and-such must be the case. (Kant\u2019s\nposition here is complicated, since he also holds that scientific laws\nhave the metaphysical quality of necessity. Genuine laws are\nuniversal, and not mere generalizations or rules of thumb.\nBut this metaphysical claim requires philosophical\njustification\u2014thus Kant\u2019s short book, Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786). It is not discovered by\ninvestigating the world.)\n\nNone\u00a0of these points, however, deters Kant from using the imagery\nof science and experiment to describe his own philosophical efforts.\nThese metaphors are especially prominent in the Preface to the second\nedition of the Critique, where he writes:\n\nReason, in order to be taught by nature, must approach nature with its\nprinciples in one hand, according to which the agreement among\nappearances can count as laws, and, in the other hand, the experiment\nthought out in accord with these principles\u2014in order to be\ninstructed by nature not like a pupil, who has recited to him whatever\nthe teacher wants to say, but like an appointed judge who compels\nwitnesses to answer the questions he puts to them. (Bxiii)\n\n\nIn other words, reason, as \u201c[self-]appointed judge,\u201d does\nnot sit by and merely observe whatever comes along. It actively\nproposes principled accounts of the phenomenon it\ninvestigates\u2014that is, law-like hypotheses. Then it\ndevises experiments to confirm or disprove these.\n\nKant sees grounds for optimism in this picture. The natural sciences\ninvestigate the infinite scope of the empirical world. In contrast,\nphilosophy only considers \u201cwhat reason brings forth entirely out\nof itself\u2026 as soon as [its] common principle has been\ndiscovered\u201d (Axx). The Transcendental Dialectic of the first\nCritique offers one application of this idea. Kant insists\nthat there are only three transcendental ideas\u2014the thinking\nsubject (or soul), the world as a whole (the universe, or the entirety\nof time and space), and a being of all beings (that is, God)\n(A334/B391). As such, metaphysics is prone to three fundamental\nmistakes, which spring \u201cfrom the nature of reason\u201d itself\n(A339/B397; for more detail, see\n Kant\u2019s critique of metaphysics).\n Philosophers have made many efforts to reach these ultimate or\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d objects. But these efforts always fail and\nthey always involve the same basic mistakes.\n\nWhether or not Kant is correct in this, his own picture of\nphilosophical reasoning may seem puzzling. He suggests that reason\nmust conduct an experiment upon itself\u2014an idea that is\nhard to make sense of. In addition, although he talks about\nreason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle,\u201d he does not explain\nwhat this may be.\n\nKant\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d may be less puzzling if we\nconsider his hypothesis about everyday knowledge. He makes an analogy\nwith Copernicus\u2019s suggestion that the earth orbits the sun (Bxvi\nf). Only if we take account of the earth\u2019s motion can we\nunderstand what we see in the heavens: we need to appreciate how our\nown (relative, moving) standpoint affects our observations.\nKant\u2019s parallel hypothesis is that our experience depends on the\nstandpoint and capacities of the observer. Our knowledge is not like\nGod\u2019s (albeit more confused and limited), as rationalist\nphilosophers sometimes suggested. Human knowledge has a structure of\nits own, and its own limits too.\n\nThe first main sections of the Critique explain and defend\nKant\u2019s philosophical hypothesis. We must take account of our\nhuman standpoint in order to explain the \u201ca priori\nstructure\u201d of our experience\u2014for example, how it is\nunified in a single order of space and time. The hypothesis is\nsupported partly because the main alternative fails. The\nnon-Copernican or non-Kantian view assumes a \u201csingle\nstandpoint.\u201d It does not distinguish between everyday knowledge\nand metaphysical speculation \u201cbeyond the bounds of\nexperience\u201d (Bxix). This leads to all sorts of problems. For\nexample, we might suppose that immortal souls could interact with\nmaterial objects and mortal human beings. Kant satirized this view in\nhis earlier book, Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of\nMetaphysics (1766). His stated target was a religious visionary\ncalled Emanuel Swedenborg. But the subtitle reveals Kant\u2019s\nphilosophical point: metaphysicians have been dreaming, too. They have\nnot appreciated the structure and limitations of the human standpoint.\nSo their arguments have created \u201can unavoidable conflict of\nreason with itself\u201d (Bxviii n). The \u201cAntinomies\u201d\nmentioned above\n (\u00a71.3)\n explain the basic contradictions that result.\n\nEven if Kant\u2019s arguments succeed, this still leaves awkward\nquestions about philosophical reasoning. Kant is not just concerned\nwith our capacities for everyday knowledge. As the book\u2019s title\nsays, he means to \u201ccritique\u201d or examine reason. But\nreasoning is the only means we have to do this. Does it make sense to\nthink of reason as criticizing or justifying itself? Might it even\npoint to something distinctive about our capacity to reason, that it\ncan examine itself in this way?\n\n\u00a73\n below discusses the most thorough reply to these question in the\nliterature, by Onora O\u2019Neill. To anticipate briefly:\nKant\u2019s metaphors\u2014of reason\u2019s experiment upon itself,\nas well as legal metaphors about testimony and\n examination[16]\u2014point\n to a general problem: reason\u2019s self-knowledge (cf. Axi\nf).\n\nKant assumes that we have a capacity to reason and that \u201cto\nphilosophize [is] to exercise the talent of reason\u2026\u201d\n(A838/B866). But since metaphysical reasoning has often gone wrong, he\ncannot merely assert the supremacy of reason. As he exclaims in the\nsecond edition Preface:\n\nhow little cause have we to place trust in our reason if in one of the\nmost important parts of our desire for knowledge it does not merely\nforsake us but even entices us with delusions and in the end betrays\nus! (Bxv)\n\n\nKant\u2019s question, then, is how we might defend reason\nfrom various\n doubts[17]\n and how we might discipline reason without begging\nquestions\u2014for instance, by invoking claims that are themselves\nopen to doubt (cf. O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 1, 1992, 2004 & 2015).\nThis is the central task of critique (cf. Bxxxv):\nreason\u2019s examination of itself. This should establish\nreason\u2019s powers and limits. It should give an account of\nreason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle\u201d and its authority.\n2. Practical reason: morality and the primacy of pure practical reason\n\nThe first Critique only hints at the form of Kant\u2019s\nmoral theory would\n take.[18]\n The account of practical reason in the Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals (1785) and Critique of Practical\nReason (1788) is radically new. Kant now presents the supreme\nprinciple of practical reason\u2014the Categorical Imperative. It is\nan imperative: it represents a command for human beings, who\nhave needs and inclinations and are not perfectly rational. It is\ncategorical or unconditional: it must always guide our\naction.\n\nKant\u2019s first formulation of this principle runs as follows:\n\u201cact only according to that maxim through which you can at the\nsame time will that it become a universal law\u201d (4:421). (Kant\nalso gives other versions of this Imperative, which he sees as\nequivalent: see\n Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy,\n \u00a75\u2013\u00a79.) Kant argues that this principle\nis\u00a0implicit in common human reasoning. Although it requires much\nphilosophical effort to articulate this principle, we rely on it\nwhenever we make moral judgments.\n\nAlongside the Categorical Imperative, Kant also mentions the principle\nof \u201chypothetical imperatives.\u201d As he puts it,\n\u201cWhoever wills the end also wills (in so far as reason has\ndecisive influence on his actions) the indispensably necessary means\nto it that is in his control\u201d (4:417; cf.\n 5:19f[19]).\n Following Hume, many philosophers hold that practical reasoning is\nessentially instrumental. In this case, practical reason only gives\nconditional or \u201chypothetical\u201d instructions. These have an\n\u201cif\u2014then\u201d structure.\u00a0If someone has\nparticular ends or inclinations, then they should adopt\nsuitable means. (This is the idea of\n instrumental rationality;\n see also\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a74;\n Kant and Hume on morality,\n \u00a73.)\n\nIn Kant\u2019s view, this is just a matter of consistency. In his\nterms, the principle of hypothetical imperatives is\nanalytic\u2014to pursue an end is to employ\n\u201cthe indispensably necessary means\u201d (4:417; cf. Korsgaard\n1997, Newton 2017, Pollok 2017: Ch. 8). Someone who fails to take up\nnecessary means is not, in fact, pursuing that end. At best, they are\nhoping or wishing. At worst, they are involved in a practical\ncontradiction\u2014a sure sign of irrationality. However, they can\novercome this contradiction by abandoning the end. Seen as mere\nconsistency, rationality cannot require more.\n\nBy contrast, the categorical imperative is synthetic (4:420,\n447). It provides an end that every rational agent must\n adopt.[20]\n For Kant, the requirement to adopt universalizable maxims means that\nwe must respect all rational beings as\n\u201cends-in-themselves\u201d (4:428). For Kant, reason\u2014and\nonly reason\u2014is the source of this unconditional demand.\n2.1 Freedom implies moral constraint: the Categorical Imperative\n\nAlongside the derivation of his supreme moral principle, the most\ndifficult questions about Kant\u2019s view of practical reason center\non its relation to freedom. Although the broad outlines are\nconsistent, Kant\u2019s views on this topic seem to shift more than\nother aspects of his critical thought. (See\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a710, for a brief sketch, and Allison 1990 for a full account.)\nThis section and the following\n \u00a72.2\n focus on Kant\u2019s radical claim that \u201cfreedom and\nunconditional practical law [that is, the Categorical Imperative]\nreciprocally imply each other\u201d (5:29f). Freedom implies that\npractical reason can be pure (non-instrumental, unconditional), and\nhence that we are subject to the Categorical Imperative. Our\nsubjection to morality implies that we must be free.\n\nKant\u2019s argument that freedom implies the Categorical Imperative\nis brief (see Critique of Practical Reason, 5:19\u201330).\nIf I am free to step back from my inclinations, those inclinations\ncannot provide a definitive reason to act. Inclinations motivate, but\nthey do not compel. If someone asks me why I did something,\ninclinations may\u00a0explain my action\u2014the action\nhelped me achieve something I wanted. But there is still an open\nquestion: should I have acted on those inclinations?\n\nAn example may help here. Pushing you out of the way might satisfy my\ndesire to get to the front of the queue. The desire motivates me; we\nmight say that it provides a \u201creason for me.\u201d For other\npeople, my desire only explains my rudeness. It does not\nsupply others with a reason to endorse my behavior; it does not\njustify my doing this. Compare the entry on\n reasons for action: justification, motivation, explanation:\n \u201cBecause I wanted to\u201d may be a \u201cmotivating\nreason\u201d for me; it may be an \u201cexplanatory reason\u201d\nfor other people. But it is not a \u201cjustificatory reason.\u201d\nKant accepts that desires are relevant to practical reasoning. His\nclaim is that they need not, and should not, determine our reasoning.\nSimply put, my inclinations do not matter more than other\npeople\u2019s.\n\nHow can we find reasons that others should also accept? Kant claims\nthe only possibility is to look to \u201cthe mere form of\ngiving universal law\u201d (5:27). There is, he says, \u201conly a\nsingle categorical imperative\u2026 act only according to that\nmaxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a\nuniversal law\u201d (4:421). This principle is categorical (no\nif-s or but-s!); it is an imperative (we must follow it!).\nWhen our action passes this test, we have done our duty. (In fact, the\nfirst section of the Groundwork argues that this principle\nfollows just by analyzing the idea of duty. For more detailed\ndiscussion see\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a72\u2013\u00a75.)\n\nKant\u2019s emphasis on duty may sound old-fashioned; the idea of\njustifying your conduct is more familiar, especially when we think\nabout practical reasoning. However, duty and justification\nare inseparable. To claim that you have done your duty is to hold that\nyour actions are justified. Other people should endorse your\nactions as the right thing to do. If they resent or frustrate your\nactions, they are acting unreasonably\u2014not you.\n\nBut why does Kant think that the \u201cthe mere form of\ngiving universal law\u201d can capture the idea of duty, or reveal\nwhat sort of action is justified?\n\nTwo points are central. First, the \u201cform of\u2026 law\u201d\nrefers to an overall policy or principle. Without this, my actions\nwould be random and make no sense, even to me. Second, Kant refers to\n\u201cgiving universal law.\u201d Not just any policy or principle\nwill do. A justification is meant to provide other people with reasons\nto endorse my conduct\u2014common sense already tells us that many\npolicies won\u2019t do this. In fact, Kant argues that there is only\none. My policy must be to act on principles that everyone else can\nalso adopt. This is what he means by \u201cuniversal law.\u201d\n\nTo give a better sense of what he means, Kant notes some other\nprinciples that seem law-like, but go beyond the \u201cmere\nform of universal law\u201d\u2014and thereby fail to be justifiable.\nIn the second Critique (5:39ff), he discusses six such\ncandidates. Here is one example to illustrate.\n\nKant sees Epicurus as advocating the following policy: always follow\nyour inclinations, wherever they might lead. This might sound\nlaw-like\u2014it directs action, just as ordinary laws tell you to\npay your taxes or drive on the left. It may even sound like a law that\na free agent could adopt. While it deprives you of the freedom to act\nin ways you don\u2019t want, it preserves something that\nsounds much more worthwhile: the freedom to do whatever you\ndo want. However, it goes beyond the \u201cform of\nlaw\u201d because it tells you to submit to merely subjective\nfactors\u2014your inclinations, whatever they may be. This raises two\nproblems.\n\nFirst, the policy is not actually law-like in practice\u2014my\ninclinations change and conflict with one another. For example,\nshort-term inclinations often undermine longer-term ones; often\nit\u2019s impossible to get everything we wish for. This isn\u2019t\nso much freedom, more a recipe for confusion. To act coherently, I\nneed to discipline and rank my inclinations. In other words, my will\nwould contradict itself if I tried only to follow inclinations. I\nwould not really have a will\u2014in Kant\u2019s terms, there is a\ncontradiction in even conceiving this policy.\n\nSecond, it is not a policy that everyone can follow. If they did, the\nresults would be utterly chaotic; they would defeat anyone\u2019s\nattempts to satisfy their inclinations. In Kant\u2019s terms, there\nis a contradiction in willing such a policy. So far as we can\neven imagine this, we see straightaway that each person\u2019s\nwilling would predictably fail.\n (Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a75, explores these two contradictions, in conception and in\nwilling.)\n\nIn more abstract terms: such a policy is unreasonable because it gives\nauthority to particular features of one particular agent\u2014worse,\nto features that aren\u2019t even stable or mutually consistent. In\nKant\u2019s words:\n\nit is requisite to reason\u2019s lawgiving that it should need to\npresuppose only itself, because a rule is objectively and\nuniversally valid only when it holds without the contingent,\nsubjective conditions that distinguish one rational being from\nanother. (5:21)\n\n\nNo principle is truly law-like unless it abstracts from an\nagent\u2019s particular motivations and situation. Every other\npossibility looks for substantive guidance from outside of reason\nitself\u2014just as a hypothetical imperative only guides you\nif you already want to pursue that end. Kant refers to this\nbasic difficulty as heteronomy\u2014that is, reasoning\ndirected from the outside. This external authority might be my\ninclinations, or religious dogma, or even a political authority. But\nit is merely assumed or imposed; it cannot justify itself.\nHeteronomous reasoning does not address the fundamental problem: to\nfind principles that are entitled to guide everyone\u2019s acting and\nthinking. In the word Kant has made so famous, reasoning must be\nautonomous\u2014that is, self-governed.\n\nThere have been many doubts whether the mere \u201cform of law\u201d\ncan really provide concrete guidance. In reply, Kantians argue that it\nrepresents a substantial constraint: we must avoid all ways of\nthinking and acting that cannot be followed by all. (For discussion\nsee inter alia O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 5; Herman 1993;\nAllison 1990: Ch. 10 \u00a7II.) If this is true, then the autonomy of\nreason reveals the positive sense of freedom at the heart of\nKant\u2019s practical philosophy (cf. Brandom 1979). That is, reason\nenables us to act in ways that do not rely on\n\u201ccontingent, subjective conditions that distinguish one rational\nbeing from another\u201d (5:21). It enables us to justify our conduct\nto one another. It empowers us to build communities around principles\nthat everyone can share.\n2.2 Moral constraint implies freedom: Kant\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d\n\nAs well as claiming that freedom implies the Categorical Imperative,\nKant claims that moral obligation implies freedom.\n\nKant insists that \u201cnothing in appearances can be explained by\nthe concept of freedom\u201d (5:30). Morality, he claims,\n\u201cexists in the sensible world [the world as known through the\nsenses and by science] but without infringing on its laws\u201d\n(5:43). Every action counts as an event in the world of everyday\nobjects (or \u201cappearances,\u201d in Kant\u2019s terminology).\nWe must take every event to be caused\u2014in terms of everyday\nexplanations as well as in sciences such as physics and neuroscience.\nConsidered as events in the objective world, human actions do\nnot provide us with a warrant for freedom.\n\nInstead, it is to our consciousness or subjectivity that Kant\nturns:\n\nAsk [someone] whether, if his prince demanded, on pain of\u2026\nimmediate execution, that he give false testimony against an honorable\nman who the prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext, he\nwould consider it possible to overcome his love of life\u2026 He\nwould perhaps not venture to assert whether he would do it or not, but\nhe must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for him. He\njudges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware that\nhe ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without the\nmoral law, would have remained unknown to him. (5:30; cf. 5:155f)\n\n\nAs Kant also says, \u201cthe moral law, and with it practical reason,\n[have] come in and forced this concept [freedom] upon us\u201d\n(5:30). In the next section, Kant refers to this as a \u201cfact of\nreason\u201d: \u201cConsciousness of this fundamental law may be\ncalled a fact of reason because one cannot reason it out from\nantecedent data of reason\u201d (5:31; cf. 5: 6, 42f, 47, 55, 91,\n104).\n\nThis \u201cfact\u201d has caused considerable controversy, for\nseveral reasons. Kant is not altogether clear about what he takes this\nfact to demonstrate. He has argued that facts about human beings\ncannot provide the basis for morality\u2014morality must be given a\npriori, that is, independently of experience. Further, Kant speaks of\n\u201ccognizing the moral law.\u201d But he is well aware that his\nown account of this \u201claw\u201d is quite new. Not least, this\n\u201cfact, as it were\u201d does not feature in his earlier\ntreatise, the Groundwork, and does not appear again.\n\nOne school of thought\u2014which includes many influential Kant\nscholars, and is sympathetically represented in Allison 1990 (Chs. 12\nand 13)\u2014sees a fundamental change in Kant\u2019s thought here.\nPart III of the Groundwork seems to give a\n\u201cdeduction\u201d (justification) of freedom. But in the second\nCritique Kant realizes that his own premises do not allow\nsuch an argument. So he stops argument short by appealing to a\nsupposedly indubitable fact.\n\nOther commentators emphasize the clear continuities between the two\nbooks. In particular, Kant relies on common moral consciousness in\nboth. \u0141uk\u00f3w 1993 emphasizes the parallel between\nAchtung (\u201crespect\u201d or \u201creverence\u201d for\nmorality) and the fact of reason. Kant refers to respect in all his\nethical writings: it is the only feeling \u201cself-wrought\nby a rational concept [= the moral law]\u201d (4:401n). As such, it\nclearly resembles what he now calls \u201cthe sole fact of pure\nreason\u201d (5:31). (See also O\u2019Neill 2002 and Timmermann\n2010.) Moreover, Kant uses the Latin word factum. Arguably,\nthis is better translated as deed rather than fact. In other\nwords, Kant points to an act of reason as well as the\nfact that it creates (Kleingeld 2010).\n\nIn any case, Kant\u2019s line of thought in the long passage quoted\nabove is fairly clear: We all (most of us) recognize that there are\nsituations where we ought to do something, even though it will cost us\ndearly. In other words, we feel that we are subject to an\nunconditional moral imperative. When we acknowledge this\n\u201cought,\u201d we show our belief in the possibility of acting\non it. This shows us to be free\u2014not merely in the negative sense\nthat we could go against our inclinations, but also in the positive\nsense that we can do our duty (4:446). Only our moral awareness\nreveals this freedom.\n\nClearly, this line of thought is not immune to criticism. For example,\nour feeling of moral constraint might be explained in terms of a\nFreudian super-ego. But it shows why Kant thought that moral\nawareness\u2014unlike any other sort of experience\u2014gives us a\npractical certainty of our freedom. While this is not knowledge in the\nempirical or scientific sense, it provides a basis for practical\nreasoning: \u201ca fact [Faktum] in which pure reason in us\nproves itself actually practical\u201d (5:42). And if Kant is right\nthat only the Categorical Imperative reveals our capacity to act in\nways that we can justify to others, then we can see why he claims,\n\u201cfreedom and unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each\nother\u201d (5:29f).\n2.3 The primacy of (pure) practical reason\n\nKant does not give a complete account of the relation between\npractical reason and theoretical reason. However, the second\nCritique does include an important section, \u201cOn the\nprimacy of pure practical reason in its connection with speculative\nreason\u201d (5:119\u2013121). (See Gardner 2006 and Willaschek\n2010.)\n\nWe have already seen two reasons why Kant must give some priority to\n\u201cpure practical reason.\u201d First, assume that Kant is\ncorrect\u2014against rationalist philosophers\u2014that theoretical\nreason cannot have insight into the supersensible. This means that\nreason cannot have access to any transcendent authority (such as God\non many traditional conceptions) that might command thought or\naction.\n\nSecond, Kant says that practical reason can either be\n\u201cpure\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cproceed from a priori\nprinciples\u201d\u2014or it can proceed \u201cfrom empirical\ndetermining grounds\u201d (5:90). Desires and inclinations are\nempirical, for Kant. Reasoning that helps us fulfill them is\n\u201chypothetical\u201d\u2014it applies only if you have those\ndesires. For Kant, merely following your desires represents\n\u201cheteronomy,\u201d especially when they conflict with morality.\nOn this view, reason is just an instrument to help you\nfulfill your desires. As Hume put it, in an especially horrible\nmetaphor, reason would be \u201cthe slave of the passions\u201d\n(Treatise, 2.3.3.4). It cannot issue its own\n commands.[21]\n\nThese two points suggest that neither theoretical nor instrumental\nreasoning can supply authoritative reasons for action. If there are\nsuch reasons\u2014as Kant\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d\nsupposes\u2014then only pure practical reason can supply\nthem.\n\nNow, however, Kant makes a stronger claim. He argues that pure\npractical reason has \u201cprimacy\u201d even on the home territory\nof theoretical reason. That is, pure practical reason should guide\nsome of our beliefs, as well as our actions.\n\nKant defines primacy as \u201cthe prerogative of the interest of one\ninsofar as the interests of others is subordinated to it\u201d\n(5:119). He gives at least three considerations to support this\n\u201cprerogative\u201d of practical\n reason.[22]\n\nOne point just reflects Kant\u2019s talk of reason\u2019s\n\u201cinterests.\u201d \u201c[A]ll interest,\u201d says Kant,\n\u201cis ultimately practical and even that of speculative reason is\nonly conditional and is complete in practical use alone\u201d\n(5:121). In this sense, to accept the metaphor of\n\u201cinterests\u201d is to see reasoning as ultimately practical.\n(Cf. Kant\u2019s notion of philosophy as \u201cworld-oriented\u201d\nrather than\n \u201cscholastic\u201d\u2014\u00a71.3\n above. See also Neiman 1994: Ch. 3; Kleingeld 1998a; Rauscher\n1998.)\n\nSecond, practical reason can be \u201cpure\u201d or independent from\n\u201cpathological conditions,\u201d that is, our inclinations. As\njust noted, Kant holds that practical reason can be \u201cpure\u201d\nor \u201ca priori.\u201d That is, it\u00a0need not be governed by\nour inclinations.\u00a0By contrast, theoretical reason goes wrong when\nit seeks knowledge by itself\u2014for example, in merely\n\u201cspeculative\u201d proofs that God exists. Theoretical\nreasoning\u00a0can only gain knowledge through sensibility and\nunderstanding. Practical reason is independent in a way that\ntheoretical reasoning can never be.\n\nA third line of thought is less abstract, and rests on the specific\ninterests that Kant attributes to these two forms of reasoning. When\ntheir interests conflict, we must decide which are to come first.\n\nThe \u201cinterest\u201d of theoretical reason consists in expanding\nour knowledge and avoiding error. As Kant has argued, reason can help\nbroaden scientific knowledge, but it cannot justify speculative\nmetaphysical claims. However, practical reason has a conflicting\ninterest\u2014in beliefs that lie beyond the bounds of knowledge.\nKant writes:\n\nBut if pure reason of itself can be and really is practical, as the\nconsciousness of the moral law proves it to be [cf.\n \u00a72.2\n on the \u201cfact of reason\u201d], it is still only one and the\nsame reason which, whether from a theoretical or a practical\nperspective, judges according to a priori principles; it is then clear\nthat, even if from the first [theoretical] perspective its capacity\ndoes not extend to establishing certain propositions affirmatively,\nalthough they do not contradict it, as soon as these same\npropositions belong inseparably to the practical interest of pure\nreason[, then theoretical reason] must accept them. (5:121)\n\n\nIn other words, even if it is finally \u201cone and the same\nreason,\u201d reason seems divided. Used practically, reason has an\ninterest in \u201ccertain propositions\u201d\u2014specifically, the\nreality of freedom, immortality and God. But theoretical reasoning\nsays these cannot be proven. The practical interest has greater\nweight, because it is rooted in morality.\n\nHere, Kant introduces the idea of a \u201cpostulate.\u201d This is\n\u201ca theoretical proposition, though one not demonstrable\nas such, insofar as it is attached inseparably to an a priori\nunconditionally valid practical law\u201d (5:122). For Kant,\nthere is only one unconditional law: the Categorical Imperative or\n\u201cmoral law.\u201d He claims that three postulates are\n\u201cattached\u201d to it: \u201cimmortality, freedom considered\npositively (as the causality of a being insofar as it belongs to the\nintelligible world), and the existence of God\u201d (5:132).\n\nFreedom has a special status\u2014as discussed in\n \u00a72.2,\n the second Critique\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d is\nmeant to establish this. But why does he think we must\n\u201cpostulate\u201d God and\n immortality?[23]\n (See also the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion.)\n\nAs we have seen, Kant holds that we should act out of\n\u201crespect\u201d for morality\u2014for the sake of duty.\nMorality must have priority over my inclinations. (Remember:\ninclinations can motivate and explain actions, but\nthey are not enough to justify action.) This means\nthat\u00a0there is no guarantee that acting well will lead to my own\nhappiness, or even other people\u2019s. This creates a\nconflict\u2014in Kant\u2019s terms, a\n\u201cdialectic\u201d\u2014between happiness and morality. While\nmorality is the only unconditional good for human beings,\nKant does not deny that happiness is important. It is the natural and\nnecessary end of every human being (cf. 4:415); duty requires us to\nmake others\u2019 happiness our\n end.[24]\n\nKant expresses the combined importance of morality and happiness as\n\u201cthe highest\n good\u201d:[25]\n\nvirtue (as worthiness to be happy) is the supreme\ncondition of whatever can even seem to us desirable and hence of\nall our pursuit of happiness\u2026 and is therefore the\nsupreme good. But it is not the whole and complete good for\nfinite rational beings; for this, happiness is also required,\nand that not merely in the partial eyes of a person who makes himself\nan end, but even in the judgment of an impartial reason [in other\nwords, this is not about my subjective wish to be happy, but rather an\nobjective judgment that happiness is the natural end for human beings,\njust as goodness is our moral end\u2014GW]\u2026 happiness\ndistributed in exact proportion to morality (as the worth of a person\nand his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the highest good\nof a possible world. (5:110)\n\n\nThe argument here is bold but dubious. We must think of moral activity\nas resulting in happiness. Yet human agency cannot achieve this:\n\u201cI [or even all of us acting together\u2014GW] cannot hope to\nproduce this [highest good] except by the harmony of my will with that\nof a holy and beneficent author of the world\u201d (5:129). So, Kant\nargues, we must \u201cpostulate\u201d that God exists. We must also\npostulate immortality. Only this enables us to hope that we will\nfinally come close to virtue, hence become worthy of happiness.\n3. The unity of theoretical and practical reason\n\nWe have seen one link between theoretical and practical reason. In\nanswer to the question, \u201cWhat may I hope?\u201d Kant claims\nthat practical reason has \u201cprimacy.\u201d Theoretical reason\nmay accept the postulates of God, freedom and immortality \u201cas a\nforeign possession handed over to it\u201d (5:120). Theoretical\nreason can only show that these things are not impossible. Our\npractical interests\u2014at root, our moral obligations\u2014demand\nthat we believe in them. To cite Kant\u2019s famous words again:\n\u201cI had to deny knowledge in order to make room for\nfaith\u201d (Bxxx).\n\nKant\u2019s arguments for freedom are more extensive and compelling.\nHis arguments for God and immortality find little favor among\ncontemporary authors. Perhaps the strongest support comes from Jens\nTimmermann, who claims: \u201cthe principle that unifies the spheres\nof theoretical and practical reason\u2026 is the assumption of a\nwise and benevolent God who has created a teleological world that\ncoheres with morality\u201d (2009: 197). (On teleology in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment, see Guyer 1989, Freudiger\n1996;\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology,\n \u00a73. Outside that work, see also Wood 1970, Kleingeld 1998b.)\n\nEven if Kant did believe this\u2014in his weaker moments,\n perhaps[26]\u2014such\n a position lacks wider philosophical resonance. Most contemporary\nphilosophers assume that the world does not \u201charmonize\nwith\u201d morality in this way\u2014or at any rate, that it is a\nhuman task to foster such harmony, for example, by building decent\nsocieties and just institutions. Reath 1988 argues that Kant sometimes\ndeploys a more defensible, \u201csecular\u201d or this-worldly,\nnotion of the highest good. Kleingeld 1995 and Guyer 2000a & 2000b\nalso offer interesting discussions.\n\nOnora O\u2019Neill has made the leading attempt to uncover the unity\nof Kantian reason and to relate it to contemporary philosophical\nconcerns (1989 and subsequent essays). This section will focus on her\ncentral claim concerning the unifying role of the Categorical\nImperative, and the main bases for this claim in Kant\u2019s texts.\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s interpretation of Kantian reason enjoys\nconsiderable respect among Kant scholars, although there are\nrelatively few critical responses to her work. Engstrom 1992 and Wood\n1992 offer early reviews; Westphal 2011 and Cohen 2014, 2018 take up\nher account, as does Bagnoli 2022: Ch. 4; see further\n constructivism in metaethics,\n \u00a72 (especially\n \u00a72.3).[27]\n3.1 Reason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle\u201d\n\nIn the original Preface to the first Critique, Kant suggested\nthat reason has a \u201ccommon principle\u201d: \u201cNothing here\ncan escape us, because what reason brings forth entirely out of itself\ncannot be hidden, but is brought to light by reason itself as soon as\nreason\u2019s common principle (gemeinschaftliches Prinzip)\nhas been discovered\u201d (Axx). Unfortunately, neither edition of\nthe Critique considers what this principle might be.\n\nKant also raises this principle in his works on practical reason,\nwithout giving a clear account. In the Preface to the\nGroundwork, Kant explains why the book is not entitled a\nCritique of Pure Practical Reason:\n\n[A critique of pure practical reason] is not of such utmost necessity\nas [a critique of pure theoretical reason], since human reason, even\nin the commonest understanding, can easily be brought to a high\nmeasure of correctness and accuracy in moral matters, whereas in its\ntheoretical but pure use it is totally and entirely dialectical [i.e.,\na source of illusion]\u2026 I require that the critique of a pure\npractical reason, if it is to be complete, also be able to present its\nunity with speculative reason in a common principle; because in the\nend there can be only one and the same reason, which must differ\nmerely in its application. (4:391)\n\n\nIn the second Critique, Kant compares the book\u2019s\nstructure with the first Critique and comments: \u201csuch\ncomparisons [are] gratifying; for they rightly occasion the\nexpectation of being able some day to attain insight into the unity of\nthe whole rational faculty (theoretical as well as practical) and to\nderive everything from one principle\u2014the undeniable need of\nhuman reason, which finds complete satisfaction only in a complete\nsystematic unity of its cognitions\u201d (5:91). Kant\u2019s tone is\nconfident. But once again, he has postponed an account of \u201cthe\nunity of the whole rational faculty.\u201d (Prauss 1981 argues that\nKant failed to achieve this insight, in part because he did not\nappreciate how cognitive success is a fundamentally practical goal.\nF\u00f6rster 1992 discusses Kant\u2019s reflections on this topic in\nhis final manuscript, the Opus Postumum.)\n\nHowever, as Onora O\u2019Neill points out in a celebrated essay\n(1989: Ch. 1), Kant\u2019s claims about practical reason imply a\nfurther claim about reason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle.\u201d\nKant has argued that the Categorical Imperative is the supreme\nprinciple of practical reason. He has also argued that practical\nreason has primacy over theoretical reason. It follows, therefore,\nthat the Categorical Imperative is the supreme principle of\nreason.\n\nTo be sure, Kant never states this conclusion explicitly. But there\nare reasons for thinking that this ought to have been his view, and in\nsome places he comes very close to this\n claim.[28]\n\nThe clearest passage is a footnote (!) in Kant\u2019s essay,\n\u201cWhat is it to Orient Oneself in Thinking?\u201d (1786):\n\nTo make use of one\u2019s own reason means no more than to ask\noneself, whenever one is supposed to assume something, whether one\ncould find it feasible to make the ground or the rule on which one\nassumes it into a universal principle for the use of reason. (8:146n)\n\n\nThis bears an obvious parallel with the first formulation of the\nCategorical Imperative\u2014\u201cact only according to that maxim\nthrough which you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw\u201d (4:421). Kant now says: think only in accordance\nwith that maxim that could be a universal\n law.[29]\n\nTo rephrase the point: Thinking and judging are activities. If the\nCategorical Imperative is truly \u201ccategorical\u201d then it\napplies to all our activities\u2014\u201ctheoretical\u201d\nas well as \u201cpractical.\u201d\n\nOther strands of Kant\u2019s thought support this interpretation. The\nmost important are his \u201cmaxims of reason\u201d and his account\nof the \u201cpublic use of reason.\u201d\n3.2 The maxims of reason\n\nKant sets out three \u201cmaxims of reason\u201d or \u201cmaxims of\ncommon human understanding.\u201d They appear twice in his published\nwritings, in relation to both acting and\n thinking.[30]\n These maxims are closely related to the Categorical Imperative. (For\ndiscussion, see O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 2 & 1992, and Neiman 1994:\nCh. 5.)\n\nIn his last published work, the Anthropology (1798), Kant\npresents the maxims in a practical context, as guidelines for\nachieving some degree of wisdom:\n\nWisdom, as the idea of a practical use of reason that\nconforms perfectly with the law, is no doubt too much to demand of\nhuman beings. But also, not even the slightest degree of wisdom can be\npoured into a man by others; rather he must bring it forth from\nhimself. The precept for reaching it contains three leading maxims:\n(1) Think for oneself, (2) Think into the place of the other [person]\n(in communication with human beings), (3) Always think consistently\nwith oneself. (7:200; cf. 228f)\n\n\nThe maxims also appear in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790). Here, Kant relates them to the\ntheoretical use of reason. A famous section describes human\nbeings\u2019 capacity for a sensus communis or\n\u201ccommunity sense\u201d:\n\na faculty for judging that\u2026 takes account (a priori) of\neveryone else\u2019s way of representing in thought, in order as\nit were to hold its judgment up to human reason as a whole and\nthereby avoid the illusion which, from subjective private conditions\nthat could easily be held to be objective, would have a detrimental\ninfluence on the judgment. (5:293)\n\n\nThat is, the maxims are precepts for judging in accordance with\n\u201creason as a whole\u201d and avoiding the distortions that\narise from \u201csubjective private conditions.\u201d\n\nKant describes (1) thinking for oneself as the maxim of\nunprejudiced thought; its opposite is passivity in thought,\nleading to prejudice and superstition. Kant also labels this\n\u201cheteronomy,\u201d clearly recalling his interpretation of\nreason and morality in terms of autonomy\n (4:433).[31]\n (2) To think in the place of everyone else is the maxim of\nenlarged or broad-minded thought. And (3) always to\nthink in accord with oneself is the maxim of consistent\nthought (5:294).\n\nThe last maxim may sound more straightforward, but Kant emphasizes its\ndifficulty. Consistency \u201ccan only be achieved through the\ncombination of the first two and after frequent observance of them has\nmade them automatic\u201d (5:295). Consistency does not just involve\ngetting rid of obvious contradictions in explicit beliefs. It also\nrequires consistency with regard to the implications of our\nbeliefs\u2014and these are often not apparent to us. To achieve this\nsort of law-likeness in thought requires genuine attempts (1)\nto judge for oneself and the determination (2) to expose one\u2019s\njudgments to the scrutiny of others. In other words, a person must try\nto make themselves: (1) really the author of their judgments;\n(2) accountable to others; and (3) consistent in\ntheir claims. We must take responsibility for our\njudgments.\n\nThe maxims support the thesis that theoretical and practical reasoning\nhave a unified structure. In particular, they flesh out the\nimplications of the Categorical Imperative. The imperative demands\nrespect for \u201cthe mere form of law\u201d\u2014consistency,\nlaw-likeness, and autonomy in thought and action. Equally, it demands\nrespect for other people as fellow reasoners and\n\u201cends-in-themselves\u201d (Russell 2020, Lenczewska 2021). As a\nmatter of thought, reasoning requires us to discipline our judgments\nso that others can follow them. As a matter of practical wisdom,\nreasoning requires us to discipline our actions so that others can\nadopt the same guiding principles.\n3.3 The public use of reason\n\nAnyone concerned with Kantian reason and politics must consider his\nfamous essay, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d (1784). Among many\ndiscussions, see O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 2, 1990 & 2015: Ch. 3;\nVelkley 1989; Deligiorgi 2005; Patrone 2008.\n\nAs we have seen, Kant\u2019s first maxim of reason is to think for\noneself. He says this is the way to achieve \u201cliberation from\nsuperstition,\u201d and equates this with \u201cenlightenment\u201d\n(5:294). His second maxim asks us to \u201cthink into the place of\nothers.\u201d Communication is essential for this. As he writes:\n\u201c\u2026how much and how correctly would we think if we did not\ncommunicate with others to whom we communicate our thoughts, and who\ncommunicate theirs with\n us!\u201d[32]\n\nIn \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d Kant places both maxims in a\npolitical context. He demands that we \u201chave the courage to use\nour own reason\u201d:\n\nEnlightenment is the human being\u2019s emergence from his\nself-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use\none\u2019s own understanding [=\n reason[33]]\n without the guidance of another. This immaturity is\nself-incurred if its cause is not lack of understanding, but\nlack of resolution and courage to use it without the guidance of\nanother. Sapere aude! [Dare to be wise!] Have courage to make\nuse of your own understanding [= reason]! is thus the motto\nof enlightenment. (8:35)\n\n\nKant\u2019s main concern is not with individuals, however.\nEnlightenment is a collective endeavor. It therefore has cultural and\npolitical aspects. For enlightenment, Kant says, \u201cnothing is\nrequired but\u2026 the least harmful\u2026 freedom: namely,\nfreedom to make public use of one\u2019s reason in all\nmatters\u201d (8:36).\n\nThis \u201cleast harmful freedom\u201d is not the freedom to act\npolitically. It is not even freedom of speech in the now-familiar\nsense that covers many forms of personal expression. Instead, it is\nthe freedom to reason \u201cas a scholar before the entire\npublic of the world of readers\u201d (8:37).\n\nAs we might expect, Kant contrasts public reasoning with private\nreasoning. However, the distinction has an unfamiliar meaning. For\nKant, employees reason privately. He mentions civil servants, military\nofficers, or clerics in an established church. In contemporary terms,\nthese are all more or less \u201cpublic\u201d roles. However, these\nemployees are bound by the policies, procedures and dictates of their\norganization. They reason about how to act\u2014but only to judge the\nbest way of fulfilling tasks laid down by their employers.\n\nWe can draw a parallel with an individual who reasons\ninstrumentally\u2014about the best way to satisfy their inclinations,\nfor example. Instrumental reason decides the best means to achieve\npre-given ends. In Kant\u2019s terms, it is\nheteronomous\u2014directed by a source outside reason itself.\n\nSimilarly, these employees are directed by state or church. Their\noffices may be \u201cpublic,\u201d but their reasoning is\nprivate\u2014deprived of full publicity. The employee\n\u201ccarries out another\u2019s commission\u201d (8:38). His\nreasoning is not free: it is \u201cimpermissible to argue; instead,\none must obey\u201d (8:37). The employee does not abandon his own\nmoral judgment\u2014Kant is careful to add that he must resign if he\ncould not \u201cin conscience [continue to] hold his office\u201d\n(8:38). But within that office, he acts as a \u201cpassive\nmember\u201d (8:37) of the commonwealth.\n\nBy contrast, the public use of reason is active and autonomous. It\ndoes not follow directions; it is accountable to all. When a person\nreasons publicly, he thinks for himself and speaks as a member of\n\u201cthe society of citizens of the world\u201d (8:37). Outside of\nhis post, an employee may reason freely, and may even criticize\ngovernment policies or religious teachings.\n\nThe same applies to the ordinary citizen. He must obey\u2014for\nexample, by paying taxes\u2014and may not speak in a way that\nencourages others to disobey. But he \u201cdoes not act against the\nduty of a citizen when, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his\nthoughts about the inappropriateness or even injustice of\n[governmental] decrees\u201d (8:38).\n\nThis creates a stark contrast between roles: the obedient citizen or\nemployee, as opposed to the \u201cscholar\u201d who makes\n\u201cpublic use of reason.\u201d But Kant sees no inconsistency.\nPeaceful co-existence requires that citizens do not undermine, let\nalone rebel against, existing governments\u2014that risks chaos and\neven civil war. In Kant\u2019s words, \u201cmorally practical reason\npronounces [an] irresistible veto: there is to be no\nwar\u201d (6:354). As citizens of a given state, we must act as\npolitical institutions demand. As citizens of the world, however, we\nmay criticize those demands and advocate\n reform.[34]\n\nKant\u2019s views invite criticism. In his day, only a few citizens\ncould read and publish their views; hardly any women could. So his\nposition may seem elitist and sexist. It implies a gulf between theory\nand practice\u2014between what employees and citizens may believe\nought to be done, and what they must do (\u201cobey\u201d!).\n\u201cThe least harmful freedom\u201d may seem not just harmless but\npowerless. Freedom to publish is only a small part of the freedoms\nessential to modern democracy. Hence Kant\u2019s views may seem\nantiquated. Certainly, they fall far short of democratic citizenship\nas we understand it.\n Kant\u2019s social and political philosophy\n (\u00a74 and \u00a76) discusses these issues.\n\nFor this entry, the key point is this. Kant equates reason with full\npublicity. \u201cTo use one\u2019s own reason\u201d is to make a\nsincere attempt to address all \u201ccitizens of the\nworld.\u201d Judgments and principles are only reasonable to\nthe extent that they can be accepted by all. Our actions must respect\nexisting boundaries and governments, because the duty to pursue and\nmaintain peace is categorical. But reason itself aspires to\nuniversality. So as citizens of the world, we have another categorical\nduty: to see ourselves as accountable to every human being, and hence\nto improve existing institutions so that they recognize the claims of\nall. For reasoning to be fully public, citizens and\nnon-citizens, rulers and ruled must discuss as equals\u2014despite\ntheir inequalities in practice.\n\nA famous passage from the Critique of Pure Reason expresses\nthis idea, linking reason, critique, and autonomy:\n\nReason must subject itself to critique in all its undertakings, and\ncannot restrict the freedom of critique through any prohibition\nwithout damaging itself and drawing upon itself a disadvantageous\nsuspicion. For there is nothing so important because of its utility,\nnothing so holy, that it may be exempted from this searching review\nand inspection, which knows no respect for persons [i.e. no person\nbears more authority than any other\u2014GW]. On this freedom rests\nthe very existence of reason, which has no dictatorial authority, but\nwhose claim is never anything more than the agreement of free\ncitizens, each of whom must be able to express his reservations,\nindeed even his veto, without holding back. (A738f/B766f, translation\nmodified)\n\n\nIn the term used by several contemporary Kantians, this procedure\nconstitutes reason. (See Herman 2007: Ch. 10, Korsgaard 2008,\nReath 2013, Bagnoli 2017; M\u00f8ller 2020 focuses on Kant\u2019s\nlegal metaphors.) Reason is the only unconditional (that is,\nnon-heteronomous) authority for thinking and acting.\n4. Concluding remarks\n\nNo one doubts that belief and action are subject to demands of\nrationality. Theoretical reasoning aims at knowledge of the world\naround us (perhaps also knowledge of ourselves). Practical reasoning\naims to make a difference in the world (perhaps also a difference in\nourselves).\n\nThis distinction hides a larger question: what is reason,\n exactly?[35]\n Rationality clearly involves the capacity to make logical and causal\ninferences: to draw out the consequences of our beliefs; to judge what\nconsequences are likely to follow from different possibilities for\naction. Rationality clearly requires consistency. Our beliefs should\nnot contradict one another, or have contradictory implications. We\nshould use means that support our goals, rather than defeat them. We\nshould avoid contradictory\n goals.[36]\n Beyond this, however, it is not obvious that \u201creason\u201d is\na unitary capacity or that \u201crationality\u201d is a unitary\nrequirement. If truth seems self-evident as a criterion of thinking,\nthe criteria for rational action are much harder to make out.\n\nIf we accept the basic lesson of the first Critique, it is\neven harder to discern the criteria of rational action. Against\nrationalist philosophers, Kant argues that theoretical reason cannot\ndiscover realities beyond empirical experience. (Recall the literal\nmeaning of metaphysics: beyond the physical world.) So we\ncannot know any sort of moral authority, be it God or revelation, that\ntells us how to think and act. Traditionally, truth and goodness stood\ntogether. Mendelssohn called Kant the \u201call-destroyer\u201d\npartly because his critique undercut this traditional pairing.\nExperience can disclose (empirical) truth, but not goodness.\n\nPerhaps, then, we can only reason practically in order to satisfy\npre-existing feelings or goals. These factors can motivate us to\nreasoning, but they are not themselves open to rational justification.\nHume\u2019s empiricist account of morality illustrates the point.\nReason is \u201cthe slave of the passions.\u201d We can only hope\nthat our fellow human beings feel sympathy, and will put reason to\nwork in its cause. Although we may disapprove, we cannot say it is\nirrational to feel or pursue more anti-social\n\u201cpassions\u201d such as spite or envy or pride. In Hume\u2019s\nown words, \u201c\u2019Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the\ndestruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger\u2026\n\u2019Tis as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own\nacknowledg\u2019d lesser good to my greater\u2026\u201d\n(Treatise 2.3.3.6).\n\nSince Kant has cut off (theoretical) knowledge of goodness,\ndoesn\u2019t consistency drive him to similar skepticism? Since his\naccount is structured by a distinction between theoretical and\npractical reason, how can he show their unity?\n\nThis entry has suggested that Kant\u2019s account of reason is\nconstructive (not skeptical) and unified (not divided). In thought and\nin action, reasoners must look for principles that others can also\nadopt:\n\nTo make use of one\u2019s own reason means no more than to ask\noneself, whenever one is supposed to assume something, whether one\ncould find it feasible to make the ground or the rule on which one\nassumes it into a universal principle for the use of reason.\n(\u201cWhat is it to Orient Oneself in Thinking?\u201d 8:146n)\n\n\nIn theoretical enquiry, we seek knowledge of the world and explore the\nlimits of knowledge; we think and philosophize. We hope to reach\njudgments that are valid for all and draw on principles that all can\nrely on.\n\nIn practical reasoning, we decide how to act, individually and with\nothers. Kant often emphasizes duty, but this entry has stressed the\nrelated idea of reasoning as justification. If an action is\njustified, other people should endorse it, rather than resent or\ncriticize it. If their circumstances are similar, they should act\nsimilarly. Even if their circumstances differ, the same underlying\nprinciples should guide their actions. If we can share principles, we\ncan justify our conduct and find a basis for cooperation.\n\nO\u2019Neill (2000) situates the Kantian account against three\nalternatives. (i) The instrumental account of reason remains\npopular. Following Hume, rational choice theory and\n consequentialism\n see practical reasoning as a tool. Reason works out how to achieve\ngiven ends (cf.\n practical reason,\n \u00a74;\n reasons for action: internal vs. external;\n instrumental rationality;\n philosophy of economics,\n \u00a75). (ii) The communitarian account sees reason as\nembedded within shared traditions. Rationality is what a historical\ncommunity takes it to be\u2014for example, its usual modes of\nargument and accepted authorities (cf. MacIntyre 1988;\n communitarianism).\n (iii) The perfectionist account sees reason as an individual\ncapacity to discern moral truth or goodness. This view resembles the\nrationalism which Kant opposed, except that it stresses divine\nrevelation or moral intuition, rather than abstract thought (cf.\n moral non-naturalism,\n \u00a73).\n\nArguably, all three accounts fail in providing reasoned justification\nto some audiences. (i) The instrumental reasoner cannot justify their\naction to people who do not endorse their goal. Instrumental reasons\nexplain action in terms of the actor\u2019s desires or ends.\nThey can make sense of the action, but they do not give the audience\nreasons to endorse it. Explanation is not justification. (ii) For the\ncommunitarian, their tradition defines what beliefs and practices\ncount as reasonable. If someone disagrees, such a reasoner can say\nlittle except: this is how I have been taught; this is how we do\nthings round here. This sort of reasoning cannot justify itself to\noutsiders, nor to insiders who dissent. (Recall Kant\u2019s free\ncitizens who \u201cmust be able to express [their] reservations,\nindeed even [their] veto.\u201d) (iii) The perfectionist believes\nthat they can intuit how it is good to act or to be. But what can they\nsay to someone who has different \u201cintuitions,\u201d or\nnone\u2014except perhaps to condemn them as blind or confused?\n\nOn the interpretations advanced by Saner, O\u2019Neill, Neiman and\nothers, Kant was aware of these options and rejected them all. We saw\nabove\n (\u00a71.4)\n that Kant characterizes reason in terms of a self-reflexive\nprocedure. Reason is autonomous\u2014that is, it rejects all external\nauthorities. Reason has authority only because it rests on on-going\ncritique. Openness to critique means giving up any mode of thinking or\nacting that cannot be adopted by all.\n\nTo put the same point in more concrete terms: Kant ties reasoning to\njustification. His account stresses the limits of many everyday\njustifications. Consider the modes of reasoning just mentioned. (i)\n\u201cBecause I wanted to\u201d is sometimes a perfectly good\nreason\u2014so long as I don\u2019t infringe on\nothers\u2019 legitimate claims. (ii) \u201cBecause that\u2019s how\nwe usually do things\u201d is sometimes a perfectly good\nreason\u2014so long as our practices don\u2019t endanger or\nhumiliate or exploit. (iii) \u201cBecause it felt like the right\nthing to do\u201d may be a perfectly good reason\u2014so long\nas my \u201cintuitions\u201d reflect a moral sensibility that\nfits my circumstances.\n\nThe Kantian point is this: Don\u2019t forget the proviso,\n\u201cso long as\u2026\u201d In the wrong circumstances,\ndesires, customs and intuitions can lead us astray. Reasoning is\nincomplete unless we can also justify giving weight to the\ndesires, customs or intuitions that make something seem reasonable to\nus. By contrast, reasoning is complete when it meets the following\ntest: Everyone could think and act on the same principles that now\nguide my thought and action. To judge whether our thinking and acting\nmeet this demanding test, we must consider objections from different\npoints of view. As Kant says, each person \u201cmust be able to\nexpress [their] reservations.\u201d This is an on-going process, with\nno fixed or final endpoint. Only this active process can make\nreasoning fully \u201cpublic,\u201d \u201cautonomous\u201d and\n\u201cuniversal(izable).\u201d\n\nThe Kantian view does not assume that we are hemmed in by our\ninterests and inclinations\u2014as many instrumental accounts do. It\ndoes not ask us to rely on what others already accept\u2014as the\ncommunitarian account does. It does not suppose that we can intuit\nwhat everyone should accept\u2014as the perfectionist account does.\nNot least, it does not suppose that reason can teach us about God or\nany other moral authority beyond everyday experience\u2014as many\nrationalist philosophers supposed. Kant\u2019s account sees human\nbeings as able to step back from their inclinations, habits and\nintuitions. Reasoning is not the voice of God, but rather a capacity\nto heed the voices of those we share a world with. Kant asks us to use\nthis ability to seek principles that all can think and live by, and to\norganize our lives together on this basis.\n\nThis account depends on a particular interpretation of Kant\u2019s\ntexts. It is abstract, ambitious, and complex in its ramifications.\nBut if it succeeds, it captures two powerful aspects of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy: a universalism that transcends self and community\nboundaries; a modesty that respects the limits of human insight.\n",
