    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nDamaris Masham was born in 1658, the daughter of the Cambridge\nPlatonist, Ralph Cudworth, who was Master of Christ\u2019s College,\nCambridge. Little is known of her education, but she did have the\nadvantage of being born into a family with a considerable library.\nHowever, despite the fact that her father was one of the most learned\nmen of his generation he did not teach her Latin or Greek. She did\napparently learn French as was deemed requisite for a gentlewoman of\nthe time, and she taught herself Latin, later in life, according to\nthe method recommended in Locke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation.\n\nAs a young woman, Damaris Cudworth (as she then was) was able to\nescape \u2018the learned dullness\u2019 of Cambridge by visiting London\nwhere she frequented the more stimulating environment of the circle of\nElizabeth Stillingfleet, whom she nicknamed \u2018Urgunda\u2019 in her\nletters. Elizabeth Stillingfeet was the second wife of Edward\nStillingfleet, future Bishop of Worcester, who later engaged in\ncontroversy with Locke. It was probably here, that she met her\nhusband, Sir Francis Masham, who was a relative of Elizabeth\nStillingfleet.\n\nIt was also in London, sometime before 1682, that she met John Locke,\nprobably through their mutual friend, Edward Clarke. By all accounts\nLocke held her in high esteem as a philosophical mind, and she was to\nbe one of the earliest proponents of his philosophy. Their\nacquaintance, at least in the early stages, was more than merely an\nintellectual friendship. Among their earliest letters is a series of\npastoral love poems, conducted under the noms de plume,\nPhiloclea and Philander. They continued to correspond on a variety of\nphilosophical subjects during Locke\u2019s years in Holland. On his\nreturn in 1688, he became guest and later permanent resident at her\nhome at Oates in Essex.\n\nHer interest in philosophy was nurtured by her reading of the\nCambridge Platonists (Ralph Cudworth, Henry More and John Smith), with\nwhose works she was familiar by the time she met Locke. It was her\ngood fortune to make his acquaintance, since he certainly encouraged\nher interest in philosophy. Thus, unlike most women of her time,\nDamaris Cudworth had the relative advantages of a family and a\nfriendship that enabled her to develop her philosophical interests. On\nthe other hand, her marriage in 1685, to Sir Francis Masham, an Essex\nsquire and widower with nine children, was hardly one that enhanced\nher opportunities to pursue philosophy. She had one son, Francis Cudworth\nMasham. Damaris Masham\u2019s philosophical writings constitute only\na small part of her philosophical activity. Her surviving\ncorrespondence, especially with Locke and with Leibniz show that her\ninterest in philosophy went far beyond what she published. Her two\nbooks, A Discourse Concerning the Love of God (1696) and\nOccasional Thoughts in Reference to a Vertuous or Christian\nLife (1705), were printed anonymously, and with encouragement\nfrom Locke. She also wrote a biography of Locke which is the source of\nthe first printed biographies of Locke.\n\nOn the little evidence available it is impossible to establish her\nearly philosophical views with any certainty. Her published writings\ncontain clear echoes of Locke, which led to their being attributed by\nsome to Locke. Nonetheless her Cambridge Platonist background remains\nevident, especially in the religious and ethical views which connect\nboth her books which are both concerned with practical ethics. While\nthese show that she became closer to Locke in epistemology, on ethics,\nshe is closer to Cudworth, especially with regard to moral\naccountability, her acceptance that moral principles exist\nindependently as part of the nature of things, and her\nanti-voluntarism. In fact her receptivity to Locke may be attributed\nto her Cambridge Platonist background, reflecting the fact that there\nis more common ground between Locke and the Cambridge Platonists than\nis normally assumed. Areas where she is most in agreement with Locke\nentail no sacrifice of Cudworthian principles, in particular her\nholding that morality is founded in reason and the freedom to act,\nthat that the end of ethics is human happiness, and that the exercise\nof virtue requires a right disposition of mind. Like both Locke and\nthe Cambridge Platonists she was a strong advocate of religious\ntoleration.\n",
