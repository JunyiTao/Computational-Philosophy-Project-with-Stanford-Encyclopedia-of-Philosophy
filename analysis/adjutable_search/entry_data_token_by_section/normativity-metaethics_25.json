    "main_text": "Is Normativity Mind-Dependent? || Arguments for Mind-Dependence\n5.2 Arguments for Mind-Dependence\n\nWe will cover four main arguments for the mind-dependence of (some\nsignificant subdomain of) the normative. The first is an\nepistemological argument. The general form of that argument is as\nfollows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nBut we do have substantive normative\nknowledge.\nTherefore, normative facts are mind-dependent.\n\n\nThe \u201csubstantive\u201d qualifier is here because, even\naccording to those who embrace\n premise (1),\n we could have knowledge of \u201cnon-substantive\u201d claims such\nas \u201cEither Bob\u2019s act was wrong or it wasn\u2019t\u201d.\nDefining substantiveness more precisely is hard, but we could focus on\nthe important case of (knowledge of) atomic normative truths.\n\nPremise (2)\n of the argument is taken as given by those who advance this argument,\nbut of course some would deny it.\n Premise (1)\n might seem strange, since we have substantive knowledge of many kinds\nof facts that surely are mind-independent, such as facts about the\nstars. But (1) is intended as a claim specifically about knowledge of\nnormative facts. The claim is that there is something about the\nnormative such that we could not have knowledge of facts of\nthis kind if they were mind-independent. The claim has been\nsupported in a variety of ways. Some have followed Benacerraf and\nField\u2019s formulation of a problem for mathematical Platonism\n(Benacerraf 1973 and Field 1989). Enoch (2011: ch. 7) and Setiya\n(2012: ch. 2) both take this to be a main epistemological worry for\nrealism. The argument is roughly that if normative facts were\nmind-independent, there would be no explanation of the reliability of\nour substantive normative beliefs \u2013 which would undermine our\nsubstantive normative knowledge. Some think that there could be no\nsuch explanation because normative facts do not (and cannot) cause\nanything. It is controversial, however, whether normative facts ever\nhave causal impact on anything. (See sec 3.2 of entry on\n moral skepticism\n and the extensive literature on moral explanations, including Harman\n1977 and Sturgeon 1985.)\n\nOf far more popularity recently are evolutionary debunking arguments\n(or \u201cEDAs\u201d), which aim to establish (1) by way of\ngenealogical arguments. (However, see White (2010) for discussion of\nnon-evolutionary genealogical arguments.) The basic form of an EDA is\nas follows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent and evolution\nhad influenced our normative faculties in such-and-such a way, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nEvolution has influenced our normative faculties in\nsuch-and-such a way.\nTherefore, if normative facts were mind-independent,\nthen we would not have substantive normative knowledge.\n\n\nSharon Street (2006), Richard Joyce (2006: ch. 6), and Allan Gibbard\n(2003: ch. 13) all present early versions of this argument, though it\nhas spawned an extensive literature. The argument is typically aimed\nat moral realism, but it is clear that mind-independence is the tenet\nof realism that is supposed to be causing the problem. (This is\nexplicit in various places, e.g., Street 2006: 110). However, it could\ncertainly be argued that it is not mind-independence in general that\ncauses the problem, but non-naturalistic views in particular (see the\ndebate between Street 2008 and Copp 2008). We\u2019ll put that debate\naside for now and present the argument according to most of its\nproponents\u2019 view of it \u2013 that it targets mind-independence\nin general.\n\nDifferent kinds of support have been offered for the first premise of\nthe EDA \u2013 it could be that mind-independence and evolutionary\ninfluence would mean it would be a huge coincidence if our\nnormative beliefs were true, and that fact undermines our normative\nknowledge. (Street 2006; see also Bedke 2014, though Bedke\u2019s\nobjection is against non-naturalism in particular). Or perhaps\nevolution would mean that beliefs about mind-independent normative\nfacts would be insensitive: we would have those beliefs\nregardless of whether they were true. Shafer-Landau (2012) presents a\ngood overview of different arguments here.\n\nA third argument for mind-dependence relies on claims about the nature\nof reasons. Bernard Williams (1979) famously argued that in order to\nhave a normative reason to act, I must have some motive that will be\nfurthered by my so acting. This has been called \u201creasons\ninternalism\u201d. Humean theories of reasons claim that in order to\nhave a reason to act, I must have some desire that is furthered by so\nacting. Such claims are mere necessitation claims, but could be\nleveraged as an argument for mind-dependence. For, one might claim,\nthe fact that having a relevant desire is a necessary condition of\nhaving a reason could be easily explained on the basis that\nreasons \u2013 or the relevant domain of normative facts \u2013 are\ngrounded in or explained by the relevant motives or\ndesires, as in Schroeder (2007). (Of course, this superficial reading\nwould have to be more nuanced based on our reading of the nature of\nthe mind-dependence debate.) Mind-independence theories of reasons, it\ncould be argued, have a harder time explaining reasons internalism, or\nHumean theories of reasons.\n\nFinally, some have argued against the mind-independence of the moral\nby appeal to fundamental moral disagreements. These are moral\ndisagreements that would survive some set of idealizing conditions\nlike full non-normative information and full rationality. Mackie\n(1977) himself thought that moral disagreement undermined the\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d of morality \u2013 which, for our purposes,\ncan be equated with mind-independence \u2013 but because Mackie thought\nmoral talk was committed to objectivity, he concluded that there are\nno moral facts. Michael Smith (1994: 6) argues that if moral facts are\nobjective, then moral opinions should converge under ideal conditions:\nthus fundamental moral disagreement would undermine objectivity.\n\nMind-independence theorists could accept this and argue that\nfundamental moral disagreement is not actual or possible (depending on\nwhether the objection is about actual or merely possible fundamental\ndisagreement). Alternatively, mind-independence theorists could deny\nthat fundamental moral disagreement undermines mind-independence\n(Shafer-Landau 2003: ch 9; McGrath 2010). They could point out that\nthere is fundamental disagreement in other domains, such as physics or\nhistory, yet we do not take this to undermine objectivity-claims in\nthose domains. But some, such as Richard Rowland (2017), argue that\nmoral disagreement is relevantly different from disagreement in other\ndomains.\n",
