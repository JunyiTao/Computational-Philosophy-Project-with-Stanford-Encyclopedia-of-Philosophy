    "main_text": "Confucian Reactions to Early Catholicism || Confucian-Catholics, Tasan and Moral Priorities\n6.2 Confucian-Catholics, Tasan and Moral Priorities\n\nThe earliest converts to Catholicism were all Confucian-trained\nscholars from aristocratic (yangban) families. Yi Py\u014fk\n(1754\u20131786), as well as Yi S\u016dnghun (1756\u20131801), were\nthe leaders of this group who were soon joined by other yangban\nscholars, such as the two Kw\u014fn brothers (including the son-in-law\nof An Ch\u014fngbok), and the three Ch\u014fng brothers. The youngest\nof the Ch\u014fng brothers, Yagyong (1762\u20131836), more generally\nknown by his penname Tasan (often written as Dasan), is one of the\nmost widely acclaimed philosophers in Korea\u2019s intellectual\nhistory, discussed below. His early Confucian mentor, Yi Py\u014fk,\nwrote the first lengthy outline of Christian doctrine in Korea,\nS\u014fnggyo yoji (\u8056\u654e\u8981\u65e8) [The\nEssence of the Divine Doctrine] in Classical Chinese for his\n\u201cConfucian\u201d entourage. However, his hymn,\nCh\u2019\u014fnju konggy\u014fng-ga\n(\ucc9c\uc8fc\uacf5\uacbd\uac00) [Hymn in Adoration of God],\nis considered one of the first hymns written in Han\u2019g\u016dl,\nthe vernacular script, which was first promulgated in the fifteenth\ncentury, though generally associated with women and men from the\npoorer classes. In fact, so poorly was this simplified script esteemed\nin elite circles that it was referred to as \u014enmun\n(\u8afa\u6587), meaning the vulgar script. But Yi\u2019s hymn was\nalso deeply Confucian, advocating loyalty to the king, emphasising\nfilial piety, and even encouraging adherence to the \u201cFive\nRelationships\u201d. This Confucian aspect of early Catholicism\nreflects an interesting transcultural interaction between both\ntraditions, highlighting their moral priorities. Ch\u014fng\nYakch\u014fn (1758\u20131816) and Ch\u014fng Yakchong\n(1760\u20131801), also wrote Catholic texts in Han\u2019g\u016dl,\nwhich also exhort Confucian morality: loyalty to the king, as well as\nfilial piety, tropes already found in Yi\u2019s hymn. In fact, in\nCh\u014fng Yakch\u014fn\u2019s Sipkyemy\u014fng-ga\n(\uc2ed\uacc4\uba85\uac00) [Hymn in Praise of the Ten\nCommandments], he writes that \u201cAmong all the things in the\nworld, filial piety is the most important\u201d, which also clarifies\nthe singular importance of filial piety in Korean Confucianism (Ha\n(ed.) 2000: 334). Ch\u014fng Yakchong wrote a much longer treatise on\nCatholicism in Han\u2019g\u016dl, called Chugyo\nyoji (\uc8fc\uad50\uc694\uc9c0) [The Essence of The\nLord\u2019s Teachings], obviously directed at a growing audience who\nwere not yangban scholars. In fact, many were women and members of the\nlower classes, overturning and destabilising entrenched hierarchical\nConfucian social norms, while at the same time advocating Confucian\nmorality, but supplemented with egalitarian Christian ideas (Cawley\n2015).\n\nTasan, like many others, renounced the religion after witnessing close\nrelations and friends brutally executed, and as a result his authorial\ncontrol had been clearly compromised through the fear of his own\nexecution, as well as the fact that his wife and children could have\nbeen sold as slaves (Cawley 2014b). Some scholars, such as Kim Shin-ja\n(2006 [2010: 92\u2013102]), comment on the philosophical inclinations\nin Tasan\u2019s writings, and consider him as having returned to the\n\u201coriginal theory of Confucius\u201d, known as Susahak\n(\u6d19\u6cd7\u5b78). However, Tasan\u2019s commentaries are\nfull of references to \u201cThe Sovereign on High\u201d,\nSangje (which is the Korean pronunciation of\nShangdi), despite the fact that the Analects never\nmention this term, not even a single time. It appears only five times\nin the entire Four Books! This term was used in the Five\nClassics, as highlighted by Matteo Ricci, and was of great\nimportance to the early Catholics in Korea, who, having read\nRicci\u2019s text, considered Sangje to be God. Why might\nthis be important? Seen in this light, Tasan\u2019s interest in\n\u201coriginal\u201d Confucianism (Susahak), may have been\nmerely a ploy to detract from his religious affiliation with\nCatholicism. The Sangje one encounters in Tasan\u2019s\nwritings is a personal, monotheistic, creator deity, and not\nan impersonal Principle. Indeed, Tasan\u2019s\n\u201cdis-assembling\u201d of Neo-Confucianism, extracting the\nZhu-Cheng influenced metaphysical discourse, and reorienting it\ntowards Sangje, resembles the strategy of Matteo Ricci,\nthough supplemented with a sense of active social morality (see Cawley\n2014a). Keum (1980 [2000: 189]) insists that\n\n\nCatholic Doctrine not only provided a bridge to a new understanding of\nthe universe, it also became a spring-board for the development of his\n[Tasan\u2019s] Neo-Confucianism,\n\n\nleading to a creative synthesis, which can also be described as\n\u201cPost-Confucian\u201d as it moves beyond the metaphysical\nparameters of Ihak (School of Principle) or\nS\u014fngnihak (School of Nature and Principle). It\nmight even be described as a sort of cryptic\n\u201cChristo-Confucianology\u201d, whereby Christian motifs inform\nhis discourse on morality, which is guided by an anthropomorphic\nSangje (discussed in detail in Cawley 2014b).\n\nIn Chungyong kang\u016dibo\n(\u4e2d\u5eb8\u8b1b\u7fa9\u88dc) [Supplement to Lectures on\nthe Doctrine of the Mean], Tasan (Kugy\u014fk\ny\u014fyudang ch\u014fns\u014f: vol. 1: 390) queries the link\nbetween the \u201cDiagram of the Supreme Ultimate\u201d (which had\nprovided the foundation for T\u2019oegye\u2019s onto-cosmology) and\noriginal Confucian ideas, noting that, \u201cit was written over a\nthousand years after Confucius\u201d, hence not found in\n\u201coriginal\u201d Confucianism at all. In another text,\nMaengja yo\u016di (\u5b5f\u5b50\u8981\u7fa9) [The\nEssentials of The Mencius] Tasan notes that\n\n\nthe circle in this diagram which represents the Supreme Ultimate does\nnot appear anywhere in the [Five] Classics. (Maengja\nyo\u016di: 383)\n\n\nTasan, similar to Matteo Ricci, reorients his ideas away from these\nwidely accepted Neo-Confucian metaphysical norms towards an all-seeing\nSangje to provide an alternative foundation for his moral\nframework. It is Sangje who re-stabilises Tasan\u2019s\nre-conceptualised ontotheological-cosmology, disentangling it from\nPrinciple, the Supreme Ultimate, yin and yang, as well as the\nfive elements. It is Sangje who makes Tasan\u2019s\nphilosophy theistic-oriented. In Ch\u2019unch\u2019u kojing\n(\u6625\u79cb\u8003\u5fb5) [Evidential Analysis of the\nSpring and Summer Annals] written circa 1812, he asks,\n\u201cWho is Sangje?\u201d, answering that\n\n\nSangje is a being that creates, governs and\nmaintains heaven, earth, spirits, humans and all things, but also\ntranscends them. (Ch\u2019unch\u2019u kojing,\na283_363a)\n\n\nFurthermore, this quote echoes the full title of Ricci\u2019s first\nchapter in the True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven:\n\n\nA Discussion on the creation of Heaven, Earth, and all things by the\nLord of Heaven and on the way he governs and sustains them. (Ricci\n1985:65)\n\n\nEarlier scholars such as Yun Hyu (1617\u20131680) and Pak Sedang\n(1629\u20131703) had dared to be critical of Zhu Xi\u2019s\ninterpretations of texts and rituals, but Mark Setton (1997:\n102\u2013103) notes how Tasan took this to another level, arguing\nthat even his conception of Confucian virtue was \u201cdiametrically\nopposed\u201d to Zhu Xi\u2019s. Setton also notes how Tasan even\nrejected the introspective aspects of self-cultivation, advocating an\noutward ethical practice based on our moral priorities. This then is\ncontingent upon free will, a radical idea in Tasan\u2019s work, where\ngood and evil are not aspects of one\u2019s material force, but\nrather, related to the psychological level, and only exist \u201cin\nthe context of concrete human relations\u201d (Setton 1989: 380).\nFree will is then the defining feature of the human being because\n\n\nThis ability to make moral choices, and consequently to shape his own\nmoral destiny, places man in an entirely different category from the\nanimals. (1989: 380)\n\n\nThis also shapes Tasan\u2019s other writings that highlight his\nprofound interest in reforming his society: Ky\u014fngse\nyup\u2019yo (\u7d93\u4e16\u907a\u8868) [Design for Good\nGovernment], Mongmin sims\u01d2\n(\u7267\u6c11\u5fc3\u66f8) [Admonitions on Governing the\nPeople], and H\u016dmh\u016dm sins\u01d2\n(\u6b3d\u6b3d\u65b0\u66f8) [Toward a New Jurisprudence]. These\nthree texts are generally considered to embody Tasan\u2019s practical\nSirhak ideology, though they too draw on commentaries and\nexamples from Confucian literature. However, Tasan\u2019s writings do\nnot necessarily eulogise Confucianism and its laws, rather, we often\nfind a harsh critique of it, which moves away from metaphysical\ndebates to deal with the actual matters at hand\u2014a society in\ndecay, and poor people suffering from harsh punishments and taxes (see\nB. Choi (trans.) 2010 [Mongmin sims\u01d2]). Justice, in\nTasan\u2019s writings, becomes a call for moral responsibility, a\ngesture of \u201cHumane\u201d government actively involved in\nloving the people, where we can again possibly find Christian\nundertones.\n",
