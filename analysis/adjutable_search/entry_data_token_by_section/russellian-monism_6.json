    "main_text": "Further Issues || Structuralism about Physics\n4.1 Structuralism about Physics\n\nAs noted above\n (section 1.1),\n Russellian monism can be identified with the conjunction of the three\ntheses: structuralism about physics, realism about quiddities, and\nquidditism about consciousness. But one might question whether\nRussellian monists are committed to structuralism about physics, at\nleast if that thesis is understood as saying that physical theory is\ncompletely silent on the existence and nature of quiddities.\nGiven Russellian monism, terms for the basic entities in physical\ntheory, such as \u201cmass\u201d and \u201ccharge\u201d, perhaps\nrefer to quiddities, to entities that have quiddities. One\nmight take that point alone to belie the structuralist\u2019s\ncomplete-silence claim. Further, one might wonder, why should\nRussellian monists rule out the possibility of physical theory\nexpressing substantive information about the referents of its terms\n(Hawthorne 2002)?\n\nIn response, one might argue that physical theory itself is neutral\nbetween a Russellian monist interpretation according to which terms\nlike \u201cmass\u201d and \u201ccharge\u201d refer to quiddities,\nand a structuralist interpretation according to which such terms do\nnot refer to quiddities (Ladyman and Ross, with Spurrett and Collier\n2007). That is, one might argue that the commitments of physical\ntheory itself, by contrast with a metaphysical interpretation\nof physical theory, do not go beyond the structural.\nStructuralism about physics could thus be viewed as a thesis only\nabout physical theory itself. In that case, the considerations\nmentioned in the preceding paragraph do not challenge the claim that\nRussellian monists are committed to structuralism about physics.\n\nAlternatively, one might give up the claim that Russellian monists are\ncommitted to structuralism about physics (Alter and Pereboom 2023; but\nsee Brown 2023). What is at the core of Russellian monism, one might\ncontend, is only that there are quiddities that both underlie\nstructural features physics describes and are relevant to\nconsciousness. So, of the three claims we have described as core\nRussellian monist theses, perhaps only the second and the third\nqualify as such. Or instead, Russellian monists might retain\nstructuralism about physics but explicate it in a way that is\nrelatively uncontroversial (or at least less controversial than it\noften is), e.g., as a view about currentphysics.\n",
