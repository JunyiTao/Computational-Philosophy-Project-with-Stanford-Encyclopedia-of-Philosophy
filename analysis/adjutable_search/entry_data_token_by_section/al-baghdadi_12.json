    "main_text": "Good and bad Epistemologies and Practices || Medical Epistemology\n5.2 Against Alchemy\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif was profoundly averse to alchemy, which was much\nin vogue in his time (Wiedeman 1907; Joosse 2008, 2014: 29\u201362).\nIt can in no way be placed in the system of the sciences. It is a\ncomplete fraud: the false alchemists are all engaged in the production\nof elixirs or the \u201cPhilosophers\u2019 stone\u201d. They\nbelieve\n\n\nin the substantial transmutation of metals and thought that the\n\u201cdifferentia specifica\u201d of metals could be produced during\nan artificial process, which in the end would always lead to the\ntransformation of lead and other base metals into precious metals gold\nand silver. (Joosse 2008: 304)\n\n\nAlchemy and its false presumptions must be distinguished from\nscientific knowledge, such as mathematics, mineralogy, chemistry,\nzoology, and botany. Proof of this is that the Ancients never spoke of\nit: Pythagoras has not devoted a treatise to it, Plato and Aristotle\nnever speak of it, and thus neither do the Greek commentators after\nthem. There is not a single word on alchemy in all of Galen\u2019s\nvoluminous works, nor in that of John Philoponus. In the Islamic age\nal-Jahiz, Hunayn ibn Ishaq, his son Ishaq, his grandson Hunayn, Abu\nBishr Matta, and Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Tayyib keep all silent on the\nsubject. The father of this false science would seem to have been\nJabir ibn Hayyan who has turned generations of students after him\nastray. Al-Farabi, the greatest Islamic philosopher, mentions elixirs\n(al-iksir) in a highly negative way only once. Even Avicenna,\nin his treatise on alchemy does not give this art a rational basis.\nAlchemy is guilty of having waylaid generations of scholars.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s life and works testifies the crucial role\nplayed by many Muslim men of learning and science, who attended the\nmilieus of the Islamic schools between the 12th and\n13th centuries, in the transmission of the Greek\nphilosophical and medical knowledge, still perceived as essential to\nthe training of the learned Muslim.\n",
