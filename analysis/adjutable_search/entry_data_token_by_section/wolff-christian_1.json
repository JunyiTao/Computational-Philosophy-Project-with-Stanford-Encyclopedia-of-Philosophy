Philosophical Sources and Relationship with Leibniz\n\nWolff\u2019s wide intellectual interests saw him exposed to a diverse\nset of influences. Neumann not only acquainted Wolff during his time\nat Gymansium with the Cartesian philosophy but impressed on him the\nneed for \u201cmathematical\u201d treatments of philosophical topics\n(including natural theology and practical philosophy). Wolff also\nfamiliarized himself with late Scholastic philosophy, through a\ntextbook by Johannes Scharf (1595\u20131660), a follower of Suarez;\nindeed, Wolff\u2019s mastery of Scholastic thinking was displayed in\nhis successful disputations with students at the rival (Catholic)\nSt.-Elizabeth-Gymnasium. While Wolff\u2019s own later philosophy\nwould likewise be branded a form of scholasticism, or\nSchulphilosophie, the extent of the influence of Scholastic\nphilosophers, such as Suarez, upon his thought is debated\n(\u00c9cole 2001, Leduc 2018). Wolff\u2019s interest in mathematics\nwas encouraged by his teachers, which interest ultimately brought him\nto Jena where he attended classes from G. A. Hamberger\n(1662\u20131716), the successor of Erhard Weigel (1625\u201399); he\nalso studied a Euclidean textbook by J. C. Sturm (1635\u20131703),\nthough his reflection on its obscurities reportedly brought him his\n\u201cfirst light concerning the ancient method of\ndemonstration\u201d (Wuttke 1841: 122\u20133).\n\nA rather important if under-appreciated early influence on\nWolff\u2019s thinking, particularly concerning scientific method, was\nEhrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708). Tschirnhaus, a\nSaxon nobleman, studied at the University of Leiden where the\nCartesian Geulincx was\n active,[3]\n and was an important member of Spinoza\u2019s circle of friends\n(among whom he circulated the Ethics). Yet, Tschirnhaus was\nalso an active scientist, mathematician, and inventor, who among other\nthings played a (perhaps the) key role in the discovery of\nthe secret for making porcelain. Tschirnhaus\u2019 principal\nphilosophical work is his Medicina mentis (1687,\n2nd ed. 1695), and he characterizes his aim there as\noutlining a \u201ccertain and constant method\u201d for the\ndiscovery of all unknown truths. Wolff first gained an interest in\nreading the Medicina mentis while at Gymnasium, but it was\nonly after taking up his mathematical studies in Jena in 1699 that he\nfound himself able to profit from reading it. Wolff evidently read the\ntext with great interest and care, marking his own copy with comments\nand queries and later preparing an excerpted text for use in lectures\nfor students without the requisite mathematical background. Wolff even\nsought out Tschirnhaus himself during an Easter book fair in Leipzig\nto press him with his concerns relating to his method. (After\nTschirnhaus\u2019 death in 1708 Wolff inquired as to the status of\nhis manuscripts but was disappointed to learn that, like Spinoza, he\nhad ordered them destroyed).\n\nIt was G. W. Leibniz, however, who would exercise the most\nconsequential influence on Wolff, both professionally (as seen above)\nand philosophically. Wolff is often described as a disciple or\nfollower of Leibniz, a characterization for which there is some\njustification. So, central tenets of Wolff\u2019s philosophical\nsystem closely resemble those advanced by Leibniz. The commitment to\nmetaphysics, the extensive use of the principle of sufficient reason,\nand the (qualified) endorsement of the pre-established harmony are\namong many striking points of agreement. Indeed, Wolff appears not\nonly to accept the principles and methods of analysis posed by\nLeibniz, but he also identifies opponents to his system, such as\nDescartes, Spinoza, and the Atomists, that Leibniz opposed in his\nown.\n\nTo describe Wolff as merely a disciple of Leibniz, however, is\nmisleading in several respects. First and foremost, this\ncharacterization undercuts the important philosophical differences\nthat existed between the two men. Second it misconstrues the nature of\ntheir relationship and the type of intellectual exchange that\ntranspired between them. During the early part of Wolff\u2019s\ncareer, and the period when he corresponded with Leibniz,\nWolff\u2019s primary focus was in the field of mathematics. It is\nmaintained that Wolff was the first to teach calculus formally in\nGermany (Beck 1969: 257). According to Wolff\u2019s own report\n(Wuttke 1841: 146), when he arrived at Halle in 1707, mathematics was\n\u201centirely neglected, nay quite unknown, in that\nplace\u201d. With the\nexception of his German Logic, Wolff\u2019s energy early in\nhis career was directed at producing a four-volume Elements of All\nthe Mathematical Sciences [German edition 1710, and Latin edition\n1713] as well as a Mathematical Lexicon [1716]. In this\nlight, it is perhaps not surprising to find the bulk of the\nWolff-Leibniz correspondence dedicated to issues in mathematics.\nAlthough they also exchanged ideas on philosophical topics (for\ndiscussion, see Rutherford 2004), their philosophical\ncorrespondence centered primarily on ethics and philosophical\ntheology.\n\nLeibniz published his Theodicy in 1710, and this work\nremained the only extended presentation of his philosophical ideas\npublished in his lifetime. Apart from a handful of other smaller\narticles written on philosophical topics, most notably,\nMeditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas [1684], A\nSpecimen of Dynamics [1695], and On Nature Itself\n[1698], there were relatively few texts available, and hardly any from\nwhat is regarded today as the core of Leibniz\u2019s corpus,\nfrom which Wolff could have extracted a definitive statement of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy. Consider a remark by Leibniz to Nicolas\nRemond, in a letter dated July 1714:\n\n\nMr. Wolff has adopted some of my opinions, but since he is very busy\nwith teaching, especially in mathematics, and we have not had much\ncorrespondence together on philosophy, he can know very little about\nmy opinions beyond those which I have published. (Leibniz 1989b:\n657)\n\n\nThe philosophical works by Leibniz that we typically consider today to\nrepresent his mature philosophical views were published posthumously.\nThe Principles of Nature and Grace appeared in 1718, The\nMonadology in 1720, and the New Essays Concerning Human\nUnderstanding as late as 1765. Although the early Kant and later\nGerman thinkers had the benefit of these texts, Wolff had no such\nluxury when writing his German Metaphysics in 1719.\n\nWhat is significant about considering the relationship between Wolff\nand Leibniz is that although there is clear evidence that Leibniz was\na direct influence on Wolff, there is also equal evidence that\ntestifies to Wolff\u2019s independence from Leibniz, particularly\nwhen Wolff was formulating and first presenting his philosophical\nviews (cf. Corr 1975 for an influential discussion). Recognizing\nWolff\u2019s independence is perhaps important for understanding what\nKant and his contemporaries understood by the expression\n\u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian philosophy\u201d. Instead of taking this\nexpression to mean \u201cthe philosophy of Leibniz, interpreted and\npresented by Wolff and his followers\u201d, as it commonly is, it is\nperhaps preferable to understand the expression to mean\n\u201cWolff\u2019s philosophical system, variously corrected and\nimproved through the posthumously discovered views of\nLeibniz\u201d.\n",
