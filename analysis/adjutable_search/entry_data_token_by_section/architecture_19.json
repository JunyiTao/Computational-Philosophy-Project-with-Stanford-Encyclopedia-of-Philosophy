    "main_text": "Architecture and Social and Political Philosophy || Architecture and the Political\n8.3 Architecture and the Political\nThat architecture has some political aspects is a widely\nheld, if not entirely uncontested thesis, with weaker and stronger\nvariants. One weak version suggests that designing built structures\nentails political engagement through interactions of architects and\nthe public. For example, architects solicit political support of\ngovernment officials for development projects, governments engage\narchitects to design built structures that express political\nprogrammatic messages, and citizens do political battle amongst\nthemselves over architectural designs or preservation decisions. A\nstronger version highlights a possible role for architecture as an\ninstrument of politics. Thus, Sparshott (1994) characterizes\narchitecture as \u201c\u2026above all the coercive organization of\nsocial space\u201d. In other words, designing built structures\nentails political engagement through the control by force of behaviors\nand attitudes of people who interact with those structures.\nThat architecture might have any significant role in politics, or\nthe other way around, calls for explanation. One account stresses that\nthe two domains are oriented around utility-maximization.  Utility\ncriteria deployed to judge the worth of architectural objects are\nexemplary subjects of democratic debate, policy analysis, or community\nconsensus. The appeal to utility is an advocacy strategy for\narchitectural design that dates to Bentham\u2019s Panopticon\n(1787) or before. Further, traditional architectural promotion of\nurban and social planning may be linked to social utility criteria for\narchitectural quality; that relationship might run in either\ndirection. In distinct progressive and utopian traditions in\narchitectural thought (Eaton 2002), advancement of social utility is a\ncentral motivation in architectural attempts to realize idealistic\nvisions of modes of living and societal organization. (For a critique,\nsee Harries 1997.)\nPower, control, and change. Architecture\u2019s\npolitical cast is also manifest in use as a means of social\ncontrol. This is not an obvious use in societies where individuals\nfreely choose dwellings or other structures with which they\ninteract. The less choice available in this regard, the greater the\npossibility of defining people\u2019s choices (a) concerning the\nbuilt environment they occupy and (b) as a function of that\nenvironment. Prominent such architectural types include prisons and\nrefugee camps. Some see potential in architecture for more globally\npromoting maintenance of power through behavior regulating norms that\nsuch built structures represent (Foucault 1975).\nEven in generally free or open social settings, though, at the\nlevel of urban planning architecture indirectly determines behavior in\npolitically shaped ways. Architects and others planning urban or other\ndensely settled environments take into account such political aims as\nhonoring community values, promoting civic virtues, maximizing social\nutility, fulfilling professional or public responsibilities, and\nrespecting citizen or leadership preferences (Haldane 1990, Paden\n2001, Thompson 2012). The politically hued results of such planning\nand design efforts, whether pursued in authoritative, consultative, or\nparticipatory processes, are architectural objects that change,\nencourage, or reward particular behaviors.\nIdeology and agency. Architecture is also used to\npromote political views, culture, or control, by conveying symbolic\nmessages of power, nationalism, liberation, cooperation, justice, or\nother political themes or notions (Wren c1670s). One issue concerns\nthe architect\u2019s agency in promoting an official political\nideology. In government commissions, the architect generally cedes\ndesign control, at a certain point, to the government. Yet the\narchitect is the creator of record.  This leaves open whether\narchitects so engaged are promoting the given ideology\u2014or else\nmerely acting as proxies for such promotion. It may seem odd to\nsuggest that, from an aesthetic standpoint the design is of architect\nX but from a political standpoint the same design is not\nattributable to X.\nPolitical agency among architects is a special version of the more\ngeneral issue of architect agency relative to clients, including as\nwell corporate and individual clients. Architects have obligations to\nthe client\u2019s aesthetic and utility concerns, and in virtue of\nthose obligations, the responsibility, blame, and praise for a given\narchitectural object cannot be wholly attached to the architect\nalone. One question is what scenarios or conditions would need to\npertain to justify apportioning more or less agency\u2014and,\ncorrespondingly, political or moral responsibility\u2014to the\narchitect or to the client, in design and build phases of realizing an\narchitectural object. The phases matter. The design phase appears, at\nleast initially, to be the agency-wise province of the architect, and\nany post-build phase appears to be generally the province of the\nclient and any relevant user-base (until any such renovation or\nrepurposing as may occur). What happens in phases en route to\npost-build is murkier, though.\n",
