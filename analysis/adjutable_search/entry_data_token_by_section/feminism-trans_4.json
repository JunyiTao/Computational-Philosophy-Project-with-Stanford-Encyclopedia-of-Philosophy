    "main_text": "The Empire Strikes Back || The Manifesto\n4.1 The Manifesto\n\nStone takes up a third position in opposition to both the medicalized\nview of transsexuality characterized by Benjamin's\nThe Transsexual Phenomenon and the feminist critique offered in\nRaymond's The Transsexual Empire. The fundamental move of\nthe essay is to see transsexuals as a kind of \u201coppressed\nminority.\u201d While Stone does not position transsexuals as a third\ngender, she does propose that transsexuals \u201ccurrently occupy a\nposition which is nowhere, which is outside the binary oppositions of\ngendered discourse\u201d (1991, 295). Because Stone wishes to avoid\nappeal to a pre-existing class of individuals who are then oppressed,\nshe represents transsexuality as a genre of discourse. The\nidea is that traditional medical discourse about transsexuality\nconstitutes a distinctive, regulated way of talking and\ntheorizing which Stone calls a genre. (Contrast, for example,\ntraditional medical discourse on transsexuality with Raymond's\nfeminist discourse on transsexuality). Stone is suspicious of appealing\nto a group of individuals prior to the workings of a\nparticular discourse (that is, one which is conceived of as independent\nof a particular discourse) since, goes the postmodern worry, such an\nappeal to this group of individuals would nonetheless be at the same\ntime providing an account of them within a discourse\u2014a\ndiscourse which could be shaped by ideological commitments. Instead of\ntrying to make such a move, then, Stone identifies a group of\nindividuals as represented through traditional medical discourse about\ntranssexuality.\n\n\nDrawing on the autobiographies of some transsexual women, Stone\nfinds herself in agreement with Raymond in worrying about what she sees\nas the uptake of sexist stereotypes by (some) MTFs (1991, 289).\nHowever, she also notes (some) MTF insistence upon a\nmale/female binary and the absence of any middle or more complex gender\nground (286). Beyond this, she criticizes the subjectivity-erasing,\nblanket claims in Raymond's work (e.g., \u201cAll transsexuals\nrape women's bodies\u201d) along with the implicit denial of\ntranssexual subjectivity discussed above (298).\n\n\nWhat is lacking, according to Stone, is space for the discourse of\ntranssexuals as transsexuals. She points to ways in which the\nmedicalization of transsexuality has required both the uptake of sexist\nbehavior as well as the acquiescence to a strict gender\nbinary. In this way, she argues, transsexuals have been complicit in\ntelling a story within a genre that does not necessarily reflect their\nown subjective experiences (1991, 295). At the same time, argues Stone,\ntranssexuals have also developed their own subcultures as well as\ndistinctive practices within those subcultures that entirely run\nagainst the official account of transsexuality (such as helping each\nother know what to say and how to act in order to get medically\ndesignated as a transsexual) (291\u20132). The solution, Stone argues, is\nfor transsexuals to begin telling their own stories (295). This\nrequires minimally, that post-operative transsexuals come out as\ntranssexual and forego passing as (non-transsexual) men and women\n(298\u20139). The traditional medical requirement that one construct a\nplausible non-trans history to hide one's past, for Stone,\nundermines the possibility of authentic relationships. Because the\ninjunction to forego passing as the (non-transsexual) sex one has\ntransitioned into runs entirely against the prevalent discourse of\ntranssexuality as such, Stone represents the political move as\npost-transsexual (299). She sees that while many transsexuals\nare complicit in this discourse, they nonetheless go beyond it\nby attempting, for example, to assist each other in\n\u201cworking\u201d the medical regulations (as explained above).\nThus their experiences and actions outstrip the\n\u201cofficial\u201d medical accounts of transsexuality. Yet this\n\u201coutstripping\u201d is rendered invisible in any complicit\nattempt to fit into a medical account which requires that one's\nstatus as transsexual be ultimately denied in everyday life (through\nthis construction of a false history). For Stone, eschewing this\ndiscourse is important because it hides the complex, variable\nexperiences of different trans people who are often positioned in\ncontestatory ways vis a vis this discourse. The move is not designed to\nfind some one authentic and uniform account of transsexuals beyond the\nmedical discourse. It is, rather, to clear the way for discourses from\nwhich it is at least possible to speak and to speak politically\nas a transsexual.\n",
