The problem of exceptions disappears if laws are taken to\nrefer to tendencies.\n\nWith regard to exceptions; in any tolerably advanced science\nthere is properly no such thing as an exception. What is thought to be\nan exception to a principle is always some other and distinct\nprinciple cutting into the former: some other force which impinges\nagainst the first force, and deflects it from its direction. There are\nnot a law and an exception to that law\u2014the law\nacting in ninety-nine cases, and the exception in one. There are two\nlaws, each possibly acting in the whole hundred cases, and bringing\nabout a common effect by their conjunct operation. [\u2026] Thus if\nit were stated to be a law of nature, that all heavy bodies fall to\nthe ground, it would probably be said that the resistance of the\natmosphere, which prevents a balloon from falling, constitutes the\nballoon as an exception to that pretended law of nature. But the real\nlaw is that all heavy bodies tend to fall [\u2026]. (Mill\n1836 quoted after Mill 2000, 56, original emphasis)\n\n\nThis idea was taken up by Cartwright and others. Cartwright\u2019s\ndiscussion of cp-laws focused on the question why cp-laws are of\ninterest in non-ideal situations. If what cp-laws say is confined to\nspecial, namely ideal, circumstances it seems prima facie\nthat these laws are irrelevant for all other, non-ideal, situations.\nThat, however, is not the case in scientific practice. Cp-laws are\nused to explain phenomena outside the ideal circumstances. Cartwright\nargues that this practice requires the postulation of capacities or\ntendencies:\n\nThe logic that uses what happens in ideal circumstances to explain\nwhat happens in real ones is the logic of tendencies or capacities.\nWhat is an ideal situation for studying a particular factor?\nIt is a situation in which all other \u2018disturbing\u2019 factors\nare missing. And what is special about that? When all other\nfactors are absent, the factor manifests its power explicitly in its\nbehaviour. [\u2026] This tells you something about what will\nhappen in very different, mixed circumstances\u2014but only if you\nassume that the factor has a fixed capacity that it carries with it\nfrom situation to situation. (Cartwright 1989, 190f.)\n\n\nSubsequently, her suggestion has been taken up by several authors that\nattempt to provide a semantics for cp-laws or even of laws in general\nin terms of dispositions (cf. H\u00fcttemann 1998, 2007; Lipton 1999;\nDrewery 2001; and Bird 2005, 2007, chapter 3).\n\nThe prima facie advantage of a dispositional account of laws\nvis-\u00e1-vis the cp-law-problem is the following: The\ndispositional account provides a semantics for cp-laws.\nAccording to one version of the dispositionalist account of cp-laws\n(see H\u00fcttemann 2014), a law statement is true provided the type\nof system in question has the disposition that the law statement\nattributes to the system. Reconstructing law-statements as statements\nabout dispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior turns cp-laws into strict laws. The claim is\u2014as in\nMill\u2014that certain kinds of systems have certain kinds of\ntendencies or dispositions. In stating the law, it is no longer\nnecessary to appeal to cp-clauses. One advantage is that the so-called\nproblem of instantiation, \u201cthe problem that many cp-laws appear\nnot to have any instances\u201d (Lipton 1999, 164) can be solved. The\nlaw is no longer considered to be a description of the systems\u2019\noccurrent behavior that is only manifest under very special\nconditions\u2014if at all. The law concerns the underlying stable\ntendencies or dispositions. Furthermore, this dispositionalist account\nis able to provide a rationale for why scientists are interested in\ncp-laws. Cp-laws describe how systems behave in the absence of\ndisturbing factors, i.e., if the disposition, tendency etc. can\nmanifest itself completely. This knowledge can be used to account for\nmore complex situations, in which various systems and their\ndispositions are intertwined\u2014provided laws of superposition are\navailable.\n\nThere is a different version of dispositionalism about cp-laws\naccording to which they are not turned into strict laws (see Bird\n2007: section 3.3). In a nutshell, Bird\u2019s general idea is that the\n\u201claws are those regularities whose truth is guaranteed by the\nessentially dispositional nature of one or more of the constituent\nproperties\u201d (Bird 2007: 46\u201347). According to Bird, fundamental\nessentially dispositional properties or potencies give rise to strict\nlaws, since there are no (or only very few) finks or\nantidotes that would prevent the manifestation of the potency\nfrom occurring if the stimulus had occurred (see Bird 2007 chapters\n3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and the SEP-entry on dispositions for details on\ninterferes such finks and antidotes). However, the\nmanifestation process of non-fundamental dispositional properties can\nbe interfered with and so the manifestation only occurs ceteris\nparibus, i.e., in conditions where the trigger occurs and\nfinks and antidotes are absent (see Bird 2007:\nchapter 3.3.1). Therefore, these non-fundamental properties give rise\nto ceteris paribus laws only. \n\nWe want to focus on two kinds of concerns that have been raised with\nrespect to dispositionalist accounts:\n\n\n\nDispositions, powers, potencies or tendencies may be present without\nbeing manifest (cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 451f.):\n\nThus if what one wants explained is the actual pattern, how\ndoes citing a tendency\u2014which for all we know may or may not be\ndominant and, thus, by itself may or may not produce something like\nthe actually observed pattern\u2014serve to explain this pattern?\n\n\nAs a rejoinder, dispositionalists can point to laws of composition. As\na consequence, it is not the disposition on its own that can explain\nthe actual pattern in such cases but rather the dispositions plus the\nlaw of composition. For example, Newton\u2019s second law with (i)\nthe gravitational force and (ii) the Coulomb-force describe two\ndispositions that explain the actual behavior of a particle relying on\nthe law for the superposition of forces. The law for the superposition\nof forces describes how the two forces contribute to the actual\nbehavior. (Note that the dispositions the laws of nature attribute to\nsystems need not in general be taken to be macroscopic dispositions\nlike fragility or solubility.) To the extent that such laws are\navailable (as for example for physical forces) the contribution of the\nvarious tendencies or dispositions can be determined even if they fail\nto be (completely) manifest. It can, however, be disputed whether such\nlaws of superposition/composition are available in general, especially\nif one holds like Bird (2007) that every law needs to be grounded in\npotencies. But even if composition laws are taken to be underpinned by\ndispositions, a further law seems to be needed that tells us what\nhappens if the disposition for the law of composition fails to be\nmanifest. We need a meta-law that tells what the law of composition\ncontributes to the actual behavior. So, the assumption that laws of\ncomposition are grounded in dispositions attributed to physical\nsystems threatens to lead to an infinite regress. \n\n\nA second problem concerns the question whether a dispositional account\ncan indeed avoid the dilemma for exclusive cp-laws (see section 4).\nEven though it is true, at least on one version, that the laws no\nlonger appeal explicitly to cp-clauses, the\ntriviality-or-falsity-dilemma turns up at a different place (see\nLipton 1999, section 5: Hume\u2019s revenge). The dispositionalist\nstill has to specify the stimulus or triggering conditions for the\ndisposition in order to give the disposition\u2019s ascription a\ndeterminate content. The conditions under which the disposition will\nmanifest itself are exactly those that are required to explicate the\ncp-clause (see Lipton 1999, section 5; for an extensive discussion of\nthis problem cf. also Schrenk 2007b). So, explicating the triggering\nconditions of a disposition requires that something informative is\nsaid about the cp-clauses, and more generally, leads us back to the\nproblems discussed in the previous sections (see H\u00fcttemann 2014\nfor a recent defense of the dispositionalist approach to cp-laws; Ward\n2009 provides a critical discussion).  \n\n",
