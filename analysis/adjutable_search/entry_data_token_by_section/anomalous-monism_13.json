    "main_text": "Monism\n5. Monism\n\nSo far we have looked at Davidson\u2019s three premises in support of\nAnomalous Monism\u2014the interaction, cause-law and anomalism\nprinciples. In this section, we examine the conclusion that Davidson\ndraws on the basis of these principles\u2014the token-identity theory\nof mental events, according to which every causally interacting mental\nevent is token-identical to some physical event. We will look at the\nderivation and nature of this theory, some questions about its\nadequacy, as well as the additional thesis that mental properties\nsupervene on physical properties. As we shall see, both the\ntoken-identity and supervenience claims turn out to be controversial,\nin their motivation as well as in their consistency with mental\nanomalism. One key point to keep in mind at this point is that monism\nis supposed to be derived from the principles and other assumptions\nthat, taken individually, could be acceptable to positions opposing\nmonism.\n\nTo begin with, it is worth pointing out that Davidson is concerned\nonly with the ontological status of events, and not substances.\nDescartes, for instance, argued for the claim that mind and body are\ndistinct entities. While Descartes\u2019 position has implications\nfor accounts of mental events, the issues concerning event and\nsubstance identity are distinct (see Latham 2001). Davidson clearly\ntakes himself to be establishing something that is inconsistent with\nCartesian dualism, however, and it is useful briefly to look at how\nAnomalous Monism bears upon substance dualism.\n\nAccording to Descartes, mind and body are distinct substances in part\nbecause they do not share essential properties in common. In\nparticular, minds do not occupy a spatial location, while bodies\nnecessarily do. Since mental events thus constitute changes occurring\nin a nonspatially-located entity, they also do not occupy a spatial\nregion. Bodily events, on the other hand, do occupy spatial locations\nby virtue of being changes in material substances, which themselves\nare spatially located. On Descartes\u2019 view, then, particular\nmental and physical events cannot be token-identical, since they fail\nto share a crucial property in common without which identity is\nunintelligible. While Anomalous Monism is not officially concerned\nwith the ontological status of substances, it thus appears to have\nconsequences that are inconsistent with Descartes\u2019 substance\ndualism\u2014though it doesn\u2019t by itself establish substance\nmonism, it does rule out the Cartesian thought that mental and\nphysical events fail to be identical, and so conflicts with one of the\nbases for Cartesian substance dualism.\n",
