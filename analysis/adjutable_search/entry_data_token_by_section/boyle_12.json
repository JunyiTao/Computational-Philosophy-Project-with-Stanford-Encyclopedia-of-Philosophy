    "main_text": "Boyle\u2019s Philosophy of Experiment\n7. Perception and the Soul\n\nTwo distinct notions of the soul occupied centre stage in the\nseventeenth century. One, stemming from Plato and the Pythagoreans,\nwith theological trimmings by Augustine, had been given immense\nprestige by Descartes\u2019 championing of it. This view was what\nGeach has called the \u201csavage superstition \u2026 that a man\nconsists of two pieces, body and soul, which come apart at\ndeath.\u201d Geach adds, \u201cthe superstition is not mended but\nrather aggravated by conceptual confusion, if the soul-piece is\nsupposed to be immaterial\u201d (Geach 1969, 38).\n\nThe second main account, stemming from Aristotle, had been taken over\nand made Christian by Thomas\n Aquinas.[52]\n In this account the soul was, though incorporeal, not simply a\nseparate bit attached to the body, but was the form of the individual\nanimal in question, whether human or not. Aquinas presented arguments\nto show that human souls were subsistent in view of various capacities\nthey had, and proceeded from there to argue for the possibility of the\ncontinuing existence of human souls in the absence of the body. He\nwas, however, clear that the human person (even when the person in\nquestion was Christ in human form) was not merely a soul with an\nattached body, but was the body informed by the soul: if your soul\nalone were to survive death you would not. Bodily resurrection is\nessential to the survival and immortality of humans.\n\nCartesians and Thomists alike believed on scriptural grounds that\nthere were actual cases of separated souls, namely, the angels, fallen\nand unfallen, so the possibility that the human soul might itself be\nsubsistent was simply the possibility that it might sufficiently\nresemble an already accepted ontological group: despite the problems\nthat substance dualism raises, a number of which presented themselves\nclearly to Boyle, there was no general problem concerning\nincorporeal entities, and there were, Boyle felt, strong arguments for\nthe incorporeality of the human soul.\n\nFor Boyle, as for other leading seventeenth century figures,\nperception was a matter of information entering the brain as a result\nof causal interaction between the perceiver and the perceived object.\nArriving at the brain the information was processed by a subsystem or\nset of subsystems devoted to presenting it to the cognitive system,\nand to storing it thereafter. The initial processing was done by a\nsystem, the common sense, that combined the inputs from the\nvarious sense organs (left eye + right eye; eyes + ears; etc.) and it\nwas then imagined \u2014 that is, an image was formed in the\nbrain though, as Kepler and Descartes noted explicitly, the image was\nnot a literal, optical, image. That apart, seventeenth century\nthinkers accepted in general outline the position which had already\nbeen set out in the thirteenth century by Roger Bacon, who was in turn\nsimply collating the views of earlier Islamic writers on the subject,\nthough of course the details, particularly the details of the causal\ninteraction between percipient and perceived, varied from writer to\nwriter (See further Lindberg 1976, MacIntosh 1983, and Sutton\n1998).\n\nImagination was a matter of material images being formed in the brain.\nBut, it was held by Boyle and others, we have knowledge of things\nwhich are literally unimaginable \u2014 that is, they cannot be\naccurately represented by a corporeal image in the central nervous\nsystem. There were a variety of reasons for this belief. First it was\nheld that there were things which were too large, and things which\nwere too small to be imagined, that is, imaged. Hence some\nnon-material faculty was needed to account for this ability.\nAdditionally, there are things which are not image-able because they\ncannot be represented accurately by any physical system.\nBoyle\u2019s stock example in this area, though not his only example,\nis the incommensurability of the sides and diagonal of a square. Since\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational no discrete (corpuscular) system can accurately\nrepresent both. But we do have knowledge of squares. Therefore we must\nbe employing a non-material system. Also, there were things such as\nDescartes\u2019 chiliagon which, while they could be represented\nphysically, could not (as experience shows) be represented accurately\nby our physical imaging system.\n\nAdditionally (a familiar Aristotelian point), our ability to abstract\n\u2014 to consider universals and not merely particular instances\n\u2014 was held to provide further evidence for the incorporeality of\nthe soul and hence for the possibility at least of human\nimmortality.\n\nBoyle also noted, as did his contemporary Henry More, the Cambridge\nPlatonist, the occurrence of ecstasies. Boyle, like More, took the\nexistence of ecstasies seriously and, accepting the literal meaning of\nthe term, thought that such experiences showed the actuality of\nnon-corporeal, out-of-body, experiences. Boyle indeed offers the case\nas a refutation of the Aristotelian view that images are required for\nhuman thinking. Locke was more cautious on the issue: \u201cwhether\nthat, which we call Extasy, be not dreaming with the Eyes\nopen, I leave to be\n examined.\u201d[53]\n\nThus, for Boyle, souls were almost certainly Cartesian souls, though\nas mentioned earlier he hesitates about whether or not the human soul\nmay not be a substantial form (BW, 5:300, Birch 1772, III:12).\n\nGiven that souls are incorporeal adjuncts of the body, it follows that\nthey are not materially destructible, and that the laws of\ninteraction between soul and body are not laws of natural philosophy.\nWhy grass looks green is a feature of the world which God\ndecided upon and upholds. His reasons for this decision, says Boyle,\nwere no doubt weighty, but they are, as to us, arbitrary (see, e.g.,\nBP 2:62, BOA \u00a73.5.1, p 247; 2:105, BOA 3.5.21, p 258; 9:40;\n36.46v). Now, if our souls are non-material, that demolishes at least\none philosophical barrier to a belief in an after-life such as is\npromised by Christianity.
