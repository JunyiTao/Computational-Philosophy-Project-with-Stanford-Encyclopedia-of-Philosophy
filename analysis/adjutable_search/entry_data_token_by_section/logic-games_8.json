This procedure is supposed to\nput pressure on you to cut the cake fairly. Mathematicians, not quite\nunderstanding the purpose of the exercise, insist on iterating it.\nThus I make you cut the piece I chose into two, then I choose one of\nthose two; then you cut this piece again, and so on indefinitely. Some\neven more unworldly mathematicians make you cut the cake into\ncountably many pieces instead of two. \n\nThese games are important in the theory of definitions. Suppose we\nhave a collection \\(A\\) of objects and a family \\(S\\) of properties;\neach property cuts \\(A\\) into the set of those objects that have the\nproperty and the set of those that don\u2019t. Let \\(\\exists\\) cut,\nstarting with the whole set \\(A\\) and using a property in \\(S\\) as a\nknife; let \\(\\forall\\) choose one of the pieces (which are subsets of\n\\(A)\\) and give it back to \\(\\exists\\) to cut again, once more using a\nproperty in \\(S\\); and so on. Let \\(\\exists\\) lose as soon as\n\\(\\forall\\) chooses an empty piece. We say that \\((A, S)\\) has\nrank at most \\(m\\) if \\(\\forall\\) has a strategy which\nensures that \\(\\exists\\) will lose before her \\(m\\)-th move. The rank\nof \\((A, S)\\) gives valuable information about the family of subsets\nof \\(A\\) definable by properties in \\(S\\).\n\nVariations of this game, allowing a piece to be cut into infinitely\nmany smaller pieces, are fundamental in the branch of model theory\ncalled stability theory. Broadly speaking, a theory is\n\u2018good\u2019 in the sense of stability theory if, whenever we\ntake a model \\(A\\) of the theory and \\(S\\) the set of first-order\nformulas in one free variable with parameters from \\(A\\), the\nstructure \\((A, S)\\) has \u2018small\u2019 rank. A different\nvariation is to require that at each step, \\(\\exists\\) divides into\ntwo each of the pieces that have survived from earlier steps, and\nagain she loses as soon as one of the cut fragments is empty. (In this\nversion \\(\\forall\\) is redundant.) With this variation, the rank of\n\\((A\\),S) is called its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension; this\nnotion is used in computational learning theory.\n",
