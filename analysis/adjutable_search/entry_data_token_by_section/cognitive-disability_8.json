    "main_text": "Group-Based Accounts of Moral Status || Species-Based Accounts\n5.1 Species-Based Accounts\n5.1.1 Species Norms\n\nOn the first relational approach, some of the properties identified by\nintrinsic-attribute accounts as sufficient for full moral status can\nalso play a distinct role in attaining it. Although, on this view,\nself-consciousness and practical rationality are not necessary for\nfull moral status, they are the norm for human beings. This norm\ncannot be understood statistically; it would not change if most or all\nhumans ceased to be self-conscious or practically rational. Rather,\nthe norm captures what is characteristic of the species. A normal\nattribute is not, however, an essence that each member must possess.\nRather, it is a relational property: each individual has moral status\nas the member of a group for which that attribute is the norm.\nScanlon, for example, claims that the class of those to whom we must\njustify our actions \u201cincludes at least those beings who are of a\nkind that is normally capable of judgment-sensitive attitudes\u201d\n(1998, 186).\n\nSpecies-norm accounts focus on the human species, but they are not\nlimited to humans. Presumably, if we discovered that dolphins or\nMartians were a species with a similar cognitive norm, members of that\nspecies would possess full moral status whether or not they satisfied\nthat norm. We would be bound to recognize (if they could) the full\nmoral status of all dolphins or Martians, and they would be bound to\nrecognize the full moral status of all humans.\n\nThere may appear to be a tension in grounding full and equal moral\nstatus in norms to which some but not all members conform. Even if the\nnorm of practical rationality gives all group members equal moral\nstatus, it might seem that those members actually possessing that\nattribute would be \u201cmore equal\u201d than those lacking it. The\nresponse to this concern, which we discuss in\n Sec. 5.2,\n is that those possessing the attribute have better fortune but no\ngreater moral status.\n\nNot surprisingly, proponents of intrinsic attribute accounts, such as\nMcMahan, are unsympathetic with the claim that \u201cfacts about the\nnature of some individuals could determine how other individuals that\nlack that nature ought to be treated\u201d (McMahan 2008, 85). Like\nother critics, McMahan sees this claim as requiring a kind of\n\u201cmoral alchemy\u201d that transmutes factual claims about some\nindividuals into moral demands concerning others. But for those who\nregard humanity as a \u201cthick\u201d concept\n (5.2),\n no alchemy is required. The concept of a human being is a normative\none, conferring rights on all those who fall under it and imposing\nmoral demands on those who understand and apply it.\n5.1.2 (Co-)Humanity as a Special Relationship\n\nA second kind of species-relationship claimed to confer moral status\nis not between the individual human and the species norm, but between\nthe individual human and other human beings, in particular, those who\nare cognitively normal. The claim is that human beings have a reason,\nbased on co-membership in the species, to regard each other as moral\nequals. As Scanlon (1998) asserts,\n\n\n[T]he mere fact that a being is \u2018of human born\u2019 provides a\nstrong reason for according it the same status as other humans. This\nhas sometimes been characterized as prejudice, called speciesism. But\nit is not prejudice to hold that our own relation to these beings\ngives us reason to accept the requirement that our actions be\njustifiable to them. (185) \n\n\nThis position grounds full moral status in the kinship of all human\nbeings\u2014what used to be called \u201cthe family of man.\u201d\nAlthough this kinship currently depends on birth to a human mother, it\nis shared by all human beings and does not vary with degree of\n consanguinity.[11]\n\nThis approach avoids the questionable notion of a species norm as a\nsource of moral status. But unlike a species-norm account, it requires\nno one but human beings to recognize the full moral status of all\nhumans. On the species norm account, McMahan (2002) observes, \n\n\n[I]ntelligent and morally sensitive Martians would be required to\ntreat severely retarded human beings in the same way they would be\nrequired to treat us. \u2026 But if the reason we have to accord the\nseverely retarded the same moral status as other human beings is that\nwe are related to them through the \u2018tie of birth,\u2019 then\nMartians would not have this reason. (217) \n\n\nThis is a practically insignificant limitation at present, but an\nexpressively significant one for those who insist that moral status be\nuniversally recognized.\n\nA defender of a human kinship approach might readily accept this\nlimitation, especially since we and the Martians would still be\nconstrained by the attachments of the cognitively normal members of\nthe other species to their radically impaired relations (as discussed\nin\n Sec. 4.2\n above). But she would still have to defend the claim that\nco-membership in the species established the sort of kinship that\nrequired even this species-relative full moral status. McMahan (2002)\nargues that even if membership in some groups, like nations, could\nconfer full and equal status on its members, membership in the same\nspecies could not:\n\n\nUnlike membership in a nation, membership in a species is not a focus\nof collective identity. Being human does not significantly\ndifferentiate us from anything else; it therefore fails to engage our\npride or enhance our sense of identity. Just as no one\u2019s sense\nof identity is enlarged by the recognition that one is an animal\nrather than a plant, so no one\u2019s sense of identity is\nimportantly shaped by an awareness of being human rather than being,\nfor example, a rabbit. (221)\n\n\nThe defender of a \u201cties of birth\u201d account could respond in\ntwo ways. First, she might deny that species identity and pride were\nnecessary to ground the full moral status of species members. Rather,\nthat status was grounded in similarities among human beings, even\nradically disabled ones, that arose from their distinctive embodiment\nand that created a strong sense of fellowship (among those\nself-conscious enough to feel fellowship) overshadowing even vast\ndifferences in mental capacity. These similarities include ways of\nfeeling, communicating, moving, and reacting to and interacting with\nother members of the species. These affinities are refracted by\nculture, members of other species share some of them, and not all\nmembers of the species\u2014even cognitively normal ones\u2014share\nall of them. Nevertheless, they may be a distinctive enough ensemble\nto provide a basis for partiality. Or a defender might argue, as\nBernard Williams (2006) does (see\n Sec. 5.2),\n that species-identity and pride could play a role in human\nfellowship now obscured by the lack of a suitable comparison class.\nAlthough, as Robert Nozick (1974) observed, no contemporary human\nboasts about having an opposable thumb or speaking a language, our\nsense of species pride and identity might crystallize in the presence\nof another advanced species, which would highlight our distinctive\nshared history and achievements.\n\nStanding alone, however, both responses seem vulnerable to the claim\nthat similarities associated with species membership may explain, but\ncannot justify, the treatment of all other human beings as moral\nequals. Why should a sense of fellowship, however strong, be a source\nof moral status? If our sense of fellowship reflected what mattered\nmorally, why wouldn\u2019t we feel greater fellowship with\nMcMahan\u2019s intelligent, morally sensitive Martian than with a\nhuman infant whose developmental disabilities make him apparently\nunresponsive to other humans?\n\nOne response is that what justifies intra-species partiality is not\nthe capacity to share but the capacity to benefit. Thus, Gunnarson\n(2008) suggests that members of our own species have a capacity to\nderive unique, intrinsic benefits from their relationship to other\nhuman beings. Reliance on such a capacity may provide an intuitively\nmore appealing basis for full moral status than biologically-based\nsimilarities. But it might still deny full moral status to some\nhumans\u2014not only anencephalic infants but others lacking the\ncapacity to benefit from relations with other humans. Moreover, some\nnon-human animals, especially domesticated ones, may derive immense\nbenefits that are intrinsic and unique to their relationship to humans\n(Townley 2010). And the members of other cognitively advanced species\nmight well benefit in highly specific, possibly unique ways, from\ninteraction with human beings.\n",
