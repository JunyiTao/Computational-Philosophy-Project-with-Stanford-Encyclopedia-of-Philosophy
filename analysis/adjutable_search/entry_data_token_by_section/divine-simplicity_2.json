Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology\n\nSince a Plantinga-type approach to ontology rules out DDS from the\noutset, no sophisticated adherent of the doctrine will adopt such an\napproach. The DDS defender will embrace an ontology that accommodates\nan ontologically simple being. Indeed, as Nicholas Wolterstorff (1991)\nnotes, classical proponents of DDS such as Aquinas had a radically\ndifferent ontological style, one that allowed for the coherent\nconceivability of DDS. They did not think of individuals as related to\ntheir properties as to abstracta external to them, but as having\nproperties as ontological constituents. They, and some atheist\ncontemporaries as well, think in terms of a \u201cconstituent\nontology\u201d as opposed to what Wolterstorff calls a\n\u201crelation ontology\u201d or what might be called a\n\u201cnonconstituent ontology\u201d. Bundle theories are\ncontemporary examples of constituent ontology. If properties are\nassayed as tropes and a concrete particular as a bundle of tropes,\nthen these tropes or abstract particulars are parts of concrete\nparticulars when suitably bundled. Properties so assayed are brought\nfrom Plato\u2019s heaven to earth. The togetherness or compresence of\ntropes in a trope bundle is not formal identity but a kind of\ncontingent sameness. Thus a redness trope and a sweetness trope in an\napple are not identical but contingently compresent as parts of the\nsame whole. A model such as this allows for an extrapolation to a\nnecessary compresence of the divine attributes in the case of God.\nAquinas, the greatest of the medieval proponents of DDS, is of course\nan Aristotelian, not a trope theorist. But he too is a constituent\nontologist. Form and matter, act and potency, and essence and\nexistence are constituents of primary substances. Essence and\nexistence in sublunary substances such as Socrates are really distinct\nbut inseparably together. Their unity is contingent. This model\npermits an extrapolation to the case of a being in which essence and\nexistence are necessarily together or compresent. Constituent\nontology, as murky as it must remain on a sketch such as this, at\nleast provides a framework in which DDS is somewhat intelligible as\nopposed to a Plantinga-style framework on which DDS remains wholly\nunintelligible. The arguments for DDS amount to arguments against the\nnonconstituent ontological framework.\n\nAdopting a constituent ontology will not, by itself, bring DDS into\nthe clear. Suppose properties (whether assayed as universals or as\ntropes) are ontological parts of the ordinary (thick) particulars that\nhave them and that this having is understood quasi-mereologically as a\nkind of part-whole relation rather than as an exemplification relation\nthat spans the abstract-concrete divide. This would still leave us\nwith the puzzle of how a whole could be identical to one of its proper\nparts, and the related puzzle of how two distinct proper parts could\nbe identical to each other. Construing properties as parts of the\nthings that have them does not, by itself, show how there could be a\nsimple being. But if properties are parts, then at least\nPlantinga\u2019s dismissal of DDS on the ground that nothing concrete\ncan be identical to anything abstract can itself be dismissed.\n\nWhat is needed to render DDS coherent is a particular version of\nconstituent ontology according to which a thing\u2019s nature is a\nunitary concrete item and a constituent of the thing. In the case of\nmaterial beings, the nature will be together with some individuating\nconstituent such as signate or designated matter (materia\nsignata). Material beings are individuated and diversified by\ntheir signate matter. Thus Socrates and Plato, though the same in\nnature, differ numerically in virtue of their different portions of\nmateria signata. Matter makes them individuals, and matter\nmakes them numerically diverse individuals. God, however, being\nimmaterial, is not individuated by anything distinct from his nature,\nand so can be said to be a self-individuating nature. As\nself-individuating, there is no real distinction between God and his\nnature. In Thomist terms, in God nature and suppositum are\nidentical.(ST I, q. 3, art. 3) The divine nature is not an\nabstract object related across an ontological chasm to a concrete\nindividual;the divine nature is a self-individuating concrete unitary\nnature. For Plantinga, the nature of a thing is a conjunctive property\nthe conjuncts of which are those properties the thing exemplifies in\nevery possible world in which it exists. On this approach, the divine\nnature is \u2018cobbled together\u2019 or constructed out of\nGod\u2019s essential properties. But then the divine nature is\nlogically and ontologically posterior to those properties. Clearly, no\ndefender of DDS will think of natures in this way. He will think of\nthe divine nature as logically and ontologically prior to the\nproperties, and of the properties as manifestations of that unitary\nnature, a nature the radical unity of which cannot be made sense of on\nPlantinga\u2019s approach. None of this is spectacularly clear, and\nplenty of questions remain; but it is not obviously incoherent as DDS\nwould be on the approach of Plantinga. And our question, you will\nrecall, is concerned solely with coherence.\n",
