    "main_text": "Soteriology || \u201cFeigning Death\u201d\n6.2 \u201cFeigning Death\u201d\n\nWhen we look at other sources, belonging to the various traditions\nthat have evolved during the history of Daoism, a different picture\nemerges. These sources show that Daoist adepts did not intend to reach\nimmortality in their physical body; they intended, instead, to make\nuse of their physical body in order to generate a new\n\u201cperson\u201d (shen) that is not subject to death. The\nrelated views and practices cover a wide spectrum of Daoism: from the\nearly Way of the Celestial Masters to late Internal Alchemy\n(Neidan).\n\nSome Daoist texts describe liberation as a rebirth that takes place in\nlife, but only after one forsakes one\u2019s mortal body. In the\nearliest account of this process, related to the Way of the Celestial\nMasters, the adept goes through a \u201cfeigned death\u201d\n(tuosi) and moves to a region of Heaven called Palace of\nTaiyin, or Great Darkness, where his physical body is\nrefined. This process culminates in a \u201crebirth\u201d, or\n\u201csecond birth\u201d (fusheng), in a body that\npreserves itself indefinitely (Bokenkamp 1997: 46\u201348 and\n102).\n\nNo details are given on how this process actually occurs.\n\u201cRefining the bodily form in Great Darkness\u201d, however, is\nsimilar and for some aspects identical to what many later Daoist texts\ncall shijie, \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d or\n\u201cfrom the corpse\u201d (Robinet 1979: 57\u201366; Seidel 1987:\n230\u201332; Cedzich 2001; Campany 2002: 52\u201360; Pregadio 2004:\n121\u201326). After once again going through a \u201cfeigned\ndeath\u201d, the adept departs, only to return to live in the world,\ntypically on a mountain but at times among other human beings, in a\nperfected body that subsists indefinitely. A rare description of a\nrelevant practice, found in a source originally dating from the late\n3rd century, suggests that \u201crelease from the\ncorpse\u201d occurs in meditation. The adept is instructed to draw a\ntalisman and to visualize himself as \u201cbeing dead\u201d. Then he\ntakes off his clothes\u2014an act symbolic of his forsaken\npersonality\u2014and walks into the mountains, never to return where\nhe was born or lived (Cedzich 2001: 27\u201328; Campany 2002:\n54\u201355). Ritual elements are also involved. The adept stages his\ndeath, and his associates (family or Daoist companions) participate in\nthe performance: they state that his corpse has disappeared and has\nbeen replaced by other objects\u2014typically a sword (signifying a\nhigher form of release), a staff (signifying a lower one), or a pair\nof sandals (on which see Kaltenmark 1953: 40 and 52).\n\nThe adept who performs \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d is\nalso said to change his name, so that he could escape the spirits\nbelonging to the bureaucracy of the underworld that manage the\n\u201cregisters of life and death\u201d. For this reason, this\npractice has been called \u201cdeceptive\u201d, in contrast to\ndirect ascension to Heaven, which would be a \u201cnonillicit method\nof transcendence\u201d (Campany 2002: 59). Yet, Daoist texts never\ndefine shijie as illicit, and state instead that this form of liberation is lower because of its temporary nature: those who\nundergo \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d have not yet\nattained a state sufficiently advanced to attain complete liberation\nin life, and need a further period of refinement that cannot occur in\nthe bodily form in which they presently dwell. Significantly, the\nChinese term for \u201cchanging name\u201d (gaiming) is\nhomophonous of the term for \u201cchanging destiny\u201d.\n",
