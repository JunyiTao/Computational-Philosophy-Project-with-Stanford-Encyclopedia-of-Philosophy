    "main_text": "From Monadic to Polyadic Logic || Boolean tradition\u2014algebraic and model-theoretic\n1.2 Boolean tradition\u2014algebraic and model-theoretic\n\nBoole\u2019s aspiration to capture logic in terms of an algebraic\nsystem has inspired many mathematicians and logicians who are\ninterested in connecting the two disciplines, logic and mathematics.\nAs seen in the previous section, Peirce is clearly one of them. He\npushed the Boolean idea of an algebraic system further in two ways:\nOne is to improve Boole\u2019s representation of particular\nproposition (i.e., \u201cSome A is B\u201d) so that\ntraditional Aristotelian syllogisms may fit in an algebraic system.\nThe other is to represent not only qualities but also relations so\nthat a new algebraic system may reach beyond traditional syllogisms.\nIn that process, new notations for quantifiers and variables were\ninvented.\n\nPeirce\u2019s two-decade work made a major contribution to the\nalgebra of logic tradition in two important ways. First,\nPeirce\u2019s introduction of quantifiers and variables itself is a\nsignificant advance in formal logic, close to the predicate logic we\nknow. Second, subsequent momentous work on mathematical logic was\nbuilt on the new notation and extended logic by Peirce and his\nstudents, O. H. Mitchell and C. Ladd (later Ladd-Franklin). A decade\nafter Peirce\u2019s \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d, (1885)\nErnst Schr\u00f6der published three volumes of mathematical logic\nVorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n (1890\u20131905).[19]\n His work was carried out squarely in the Boolean algebraic tradition,\nand two important aspects of the book reflect Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence: He adopted Peirce\u2019s notation (over Frege\u2019s),\nand the third volume is devoted to the logic of relations.\nGoldfarb\u2019s insightful paper expresses these two aspects of\nPeirce\u2019s influence in the following way:\n\n\nBuilding on earlier work of Peirce, in the third volume of his\nLectures on the algebra of logic [1895] Schr\u00f6der\ndevelops the calculus of relatives (that is, relations). Quantifiers\nare defined as certain possibly infinite sums and products, over\nindividuals or other relations. (Goldfarb 1979: 354)\n\n\nAs seen in the previous subsection, including relations (not just\nqualities) in algebraic expressions and representing the universal\nquantifier as products (i.e., \\(\\Pi\\)) and the existential quantifier\nas sums (i.e., \\(\\Sigma\\)) were the main output of Peirce\u2019s two\ndecade tireless work. Considering Schr\u00f6der\u2019s book was the\nmost popular logic textbook for mathematical logic students during\nthat era, we can easily say Peirce\u2019s legacy has lived on.\nPeckhaus, working on a delicate relation between Frege\u2019s and\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s quantification theory, locates where\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s modern quantification theory originates from:\n\n\n\nThis [Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der\nLogik was the result of his learning modern quantification from\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift] is a simple and plausible\nanswer, but it is false. Schr\u00f6der never claimed any priority for\nhis quantification theory, but he did not take it from Frege.\nSchr\u00f6der himself gives the credit for his use of \\(\\Sigma\\) and\n\\(\\Pi\\) to Charles S. Peirce and Peirce\u2019s student Oscar Howard\nMitchell (Schr\u00f6der 1891, 120\u2013121). (Peckhaus 2004: 12) \n\nAfterwards well-known mathematicians and logicians, L\u00f6wenheim,\nSkolem and Zermelo, all used Peirce-Schr\u00f6der notation. Peano was\nalso very much familiar with Peirce-Schr\u00f6der algebraic logic.\nPutnam includes Whitehead in this tradition as well:\n\n\nThis [Whitehead\u2019s Universal Algebra] is a work squarely\nin the tradition to which Boole, Schr\u00f6der, and Peirce belonged,\nthe tradition that treated general algebra and logic as virtually one\nsubject. (Putnam 1982: 298)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Putnam points out that this portion of\nWhitehead\u2019s work was prior to his collaboration with Russell,\nand during this early period Whitehead\u2019s work, especially on\nquantifiers, mentions Peirce and his students, but not Frege. Clearly\nwe needed to wait until Russell drew our attention to Frege, but\n\u201cit was Peirce who seems to have been known to the entire world\nlogical community\u201d (Putnam 1982: 297). Putnam\u2019s label of\nthe Peirce group as \u201ceffective\u201d discoverers of the\nquantifier and Frege as a discoverer could be a resolution to the\nFrege-first versus Peirce-first debate.\n\nWhile many have focused on the development of quantifiers, it is quite\nnoteworthy that Tarski drew our attention to the importance of the\nalgebra of relations in his 1941 paper \u201cOn the Calculus of\n Relations\u201d.[20]\n Just as Peirce did in his DNLR (1870) paper, Tarski acknowledges De\nMorgan\u2019s contribution: It is De Morgan who first realized the\nnecessity of representing relations as well as qualities and struggled\nover the limits of traditional logic. And Tarski gives full credit to\nPeirce in terms of solid advance over the calculus of relations.\n\n\nThe title of creator of the theory of relations was reserved for C. S.\nPeirce. In several papers published between 1870 and 1882a, he\nintroduced and made precise all the fundamental concepts of the theory\nof relations and formulated and established its fundamental\nlaws.\u2026In particular, his investigations made it clear that a\nlarge part of the theory of relations can be presented as a calculus\nwhich is formally much like the calculus of classes developed by G.\nBoole and W. S. Jevons, but which greatly exceeds it in richness of\nexpression and is therefore incomparably more interesting from the\ndeductive point of view. (Tarski 1941: 73)\n\n\nThis passage not only situates Peirce\u2019s logical achievement in\nthe context of the algebra of logic tradition but also characterizes\nPeirce\u2019s work as an extension of Boole\u2019s and Jevons\u2019\nmonadic logic. (For more details about Peirce\u2019s position in\nBoole\u2019s tradition, see the entry\n the algebra of logic tradition.)\n \n\nSome Peirce scholars have also claimed that Peirce\u2019s invention\nof quantifiers is a product of Peirce\u2019s own philosophy of logic,\nwhich is different from Frege\u2019s (Brady 1997; Burch 1997; Iliff\n1997; Merrill 1997). Hintikka\u2019s proposal (1997) to explain the\nmain difference between Frege\u2019s and Peirce\u2019s contributions\nto modern logic is quite intriguing. Tracing back to Frege\u2019s own\ndistinction between calculus ratiocinator versus a lingua\ncharacterica, van Heijenoort adds a new dimension to these two\nopposing views of logic beyond what Frege alluded to (van Heijenoort\n1967: footnote 1, p.\n 329).[21]\n While Frege emphasized a difference between propositional and\nquantification logic, van Heijenoort located a difference in what is\ntaken as a totality. Boole\u2019s tradition does not make any\nontological commitment about a totality, but it \u201ccan be changed\nat will\u201d (1967: 325). On the other hand, Frege\u2019s language\nis about the universe. Borrowing van Heijenoort\u2019s\ndistinction between Boole\u2019s logic as a calculus and\nFrege\u2019s universality of logic, Hintikka locates Peirce in\nBoole\u2019s camp, calling it the model-theoretic tradition. Unlike\nFrege\u2019s view of the universe, the model-theoretic tradition\nallows us to reinterpret a language and thus assign different\nuniverses to quantifiers. According to Hintikka, Peirce\u2019s\ndevelopment of modal logic is a good piece of evidence to show how\nfruitful Peirce\u2019s way of understanding quantifiers could be\n(Hintikka 1997). In the next section where Peirce\u2019s graphical\nsystems are introduced, we will revisit this issue.\n",
