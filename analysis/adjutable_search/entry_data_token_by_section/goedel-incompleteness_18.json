It is discussed in Goldfarb and Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1995;\nGoldfarb 1995; Crocco 2003; Awodey & Carus 2003, 2004; Tennant\n2008. \n6.2 Self-evident and analytical truths\n\nOne can also give more general epistemological interpretations of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. Quine and Ullian (1978), for example,\nconsider the traditional philosophical picture that all truths could\nbe proved by self-evident steps from self-evident truths and\nobservation. They then point out that even the truths of elementary\nnumber theory are presumably not in general derivable by self-evident\nsteps from self-evident truths (Quine & Ullian 1978: 64\u201365.)\nHilary Putnam (1975) in turn submits that, under a certain natural\nunderstanding of \u201canalytic\u201d, there must be, by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, synthetic truths in mathematics. In fact,\nG\u00f6del himself made remarks in a very similar spirit that even the\ntheory of integers is demonstrably non-analytic (G\u00f6del 1944).\n6.3 \u2018G\u00f6delian\u2019 arguments against mechanism\n\nThere have been repeated attempts to apply G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems\nto demonstrate that the powers of the human mind outrun any mechanism\nor formal system. Such a G\u00f6delian argument against mechanism was\nconsidered, if only in order to refute it, already by Turing in the\nlate 1940s (see Piccinini 2003). An unqualified anti-mechanist\nconclusion was drawn from the incompleteness theorems in a widely read\npopular exposition, G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem, by Nagel and\nNewman (1958). Shortly afterwards, J.R. Lucas (1961) famously\nproclaimed that G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem\n\n\nproves that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds cannot be\nexplained as machines. \n\n\nHe stated that \n\n\ngiven any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple\narithmetic, there is a formula it is incapable of producing as being\ntrue \u2026 but which we can see to be true.\n\n\nMore recently, very similar claims have been put forward by Roger\nPenrose (1989, 1994). John Searle (1997) has joined the discussion and\npartly defended Penrose against his critics. Crispin Wright (1994,\n1995) has endorsed related ideas from an intuitionistic point of view\n(for criticism, see Detlefsen 1995). They all insist that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems imply that the human mind infinitely\nsurpasses the power of any finite machine or formal system.\n\nThese G\u00f6delian anti-mechanist arguments are, however,\nproblematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail. The standard\nresponse to this argument goes along the following lines (this\nobjection goes back to Putnam 1960; see also Boolos 1968, Shapiro\n1998): The argument assumes that for any formalized system, or a\nfinite machine, there exists the G\u00f6del sentence which is\nunprovable in that system, but which the human mind can see to be\ntrue. Yet G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem has in reality a conditional\nform, and the alleged truth of the G\u00f6del sentence of a system\ndepends on the assumption of the consistency of the system. The\nanti-mechanist\u2019s argument thus also requires that the human mind\ncan always see whether or not a given formalized theory is consistent.\nHowever, this is highly implausible (cf. Davis 1990). Lucas, Penrose\nand others have attempted to reply to such criticism (see, e.g., Lucas\n1996; Penrose 1995, 1997). For detailed criticism of Penrose, see\nBoolos 1990; Davis 1990, 1993; Feferman 1995; Lindstr\u00f6m 2001;\nPudl\u00e1k 1999; Shapiro 2003; many of these considerations are\nalso relevant for what Lucas says).\n6.4 G\u00f6del and Benacerraf on Mechanism and Platonism\n\nInterestingly, G\u00f6del himself also presented an anti-mechanist\nargument although it was more cautious and only published posthumously\n(in his Collected Works, Vol. III, in 1995). That is, in his\n1951 Gibbs lecture, G\u00f6del drew the following disjunctive\nconclusion from the incompleteness theorems: \n\n\neither \u2026 the human mind (even within the realm of pure\nmathematics) infinitely surpasses the power of any finite machine, or\nelse there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems. \n\n\nG\u00f6del speaks about this statement as a \u201cmathematically\nestablished fact\u201d (G\u00f6del 1951; for more discussion on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s disjunctive claim, see, e.g., Shapiro 1998).\nAccording to G\u00f6del, the second alternative \n\n\nseems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our own creation\n\u2026 that mathematical objects and facts \u2026 exist\nobjectively and independently of our mental acts and decisions. \n\n\nG\u00f6del was nonetheless inclined to deny the possibility of\nabsolutely unsolvable problems, and although he did believe in\nmathematical Platonism, his reasons for this conviction were\ndifferent, and he did not maintain that the incompleteness theorems\nalone establish Platonism. Thus G\u00f6del believed in the first\ndisjunct, that the human mind infinitely surpasses the power of any\nfinite machine. Still, this conclusion of G\u00f6del follows, as\nG\u00f6del himself clearly explains, only if one denies, as does\nG\u00f6del, the possibility of humanly unsolvable problems. It is not\na necessary consequence of incompleteness theorems.\n\nNow G\u00f6del was, unlike the later advocates of the so-called\nG\u00f6delian anti-mechanist argument, sensitive enough to admit that\nboth mechanism and the alternative that there are humanly absolutely\nunsolvable problems are consistent with his incompleteness theorems.\nHis fundamental reasons for disliking the latter alternative are much\nmore philosophical. G\u00f6del thought in a somewhat Kantian way that\nhuman reason would be fatally irrational if it asked questions it\ncould not answer (for critical discussion, see Kreisel 1967; Boolos\n1995; Raatikainen 2005).\n\nAs a reaction to Lucas\u2019 argument, but before the publication of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Gibbs Lecture, Paul Benacerraf (1967) put forward\nmore qualified conclusions that interestingly resemble some ideas of\nG\u00f6del. He argued that it is consistent with all the facts that I\nam indeed a Turing machine, but that I cannot ascertain which one. For\nsome critical discussion, see Chihara 1972 and Hanson 1971.\n6.5 Mysticism and the existence of God?\n\nSometimes quite fantastic conclusions are drawn from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems. It has been even suggested that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, if not exactly prove, at least give\nstrong support for mysticism or the existence of God. These\ninterpretations seem to assume one or more misunderstandings which\nhave already been discussed above: it is either assumed that\nG\u00f6del provided an absolutely unprovable sentence, or that\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems imply Platonism, or anti-mechanism, or\nboth.\n\nFor more discussion about the philosophical aspects of the\nincompleteness theorems, see Raatikainen 2005 and Franz\u00e9n\n2005.\nFurther reading\n\nA standard reference for the incompleteness theorems is:\n\nSmory\u0144ski, C., 1977, \u201cThe incompleteness\ntheorems,\u201d in Handbook of Mathematical Logic, J.\nBarwise (ed.), Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 821\u2013866\n [available online].\n\n\nThere are several introductory textbooks in mathematical logic which\ngive a good exposition of the incompleteness theorems and related\ntopics; for example:\n\nBoolos, G., and R.
