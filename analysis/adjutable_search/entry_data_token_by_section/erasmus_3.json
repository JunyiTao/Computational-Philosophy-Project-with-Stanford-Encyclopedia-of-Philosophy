    "main_text": "Languag\n4. Language and Literature\n\nThe formation and correct use of language was a primary concern for\nErasmus (as in Boyle 1977). He wrote several works that would seem to\nprovide a starting point for a philosophy of language. Indeed, he\ndevoted a treatise to the subject of language (De Lingua, The\nTongue, 1525), but no systematic thought on the nature, origin, or\nfunction of language emerges from this tractate. We find only isolated\ncomments about the relationship between words and things, for example,\nthe statement that things were intelligible only through words,\n\u201cby the sounds we attach to them\u201d. A person who did not\nunderstand the force of words was \u201cshort-sighted, deluded, and\nunbalanced in his judgment of things as well\u201d (CWE 24: 666). The\ntreatise De Recta Pronuntiatione (The Right Way of Speaking,\n1528) contains another stand-alone pronouncement. Citing the ancient\nphysician Galen, Erasmus declares that language (oratio),\nrather than reason (ratio), was the distinguishing mark of\nhuman beings (CWE 26: 369). A promising statement in De Ratione\nStudii likewise remains without follow-up. \u201cIn principle,\nknowledge as a whole seems to be of two kinds, of things and of\nwords\u201d, Erasmus states. \u201cKnowledge of words comes earlier,\nbut that of things is the more important\u201d (CWE 24: 666). These\nwords appear to introduce a theory resembling the duality of\nword/thing developed in Plato\u2019s Cratylus or\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, but turn out to be only an\norganizational principle indicating to readers that Erasmus will talk\nfirst of language, then of content.\n\nOccasionally Erasmus uses metaphors to indicate the relationship\nbetween words and things, likening them to clothing /body\n(\u201cstyle is to thought as clothes are to the body\u201d, CWE 24:\n306) or vessel/content (\u201cmystery concealed by the letter\u201d,\nCWE 66: 32), but these expressions are no more than apt figures of\nspeech. Similarly, a statement in his annotations on the New Testament\nappears to be an instance of ideational epistemology. Commenting on\nJohn 1:1 (\u201cIn the beginning was the word\u201d) and on the\nimplications of rendering Greek logos into Latin using\nsermo or verbum, Erasmus explains that\nverbum is used \u201cof what sounds rather than of what is\nconceived in the mind\u201d, although \u201cthings the voice\nexpresses are signs of the states that are present first in the\nmind\u201d and therefore may also be called verbum. He adds:\n\u201cThinking is, as it were, talking to oneself\u201d (CWE 73:\n35\u20136). In this case, too, Erasmus\u2019 remarks remain without\nsolid context.\n\nSimilarly, Erasmus\u2019 comments on the function of language as a\nmeans of communication appear significant at first sight. In the\nLingua, for example, he says: \u201cThe tongue was given to\nmen so that by its agency as messenger one man might know the mind and\nintention of another\u201d (CWE 29: 314). He also acknowledges the\ncommunicative function in the Paraclesis, one of the prefaces\nto his New Testament edition: \u201cfor our daily conversation\nreflects in large measure what we are. Let each person understand what\nhe can; let each express what he can\u201d (CWE 41: 412). Here as\nelsewhere Erasmus does not elaborate on his thoughts, and his\nstatements fall short of a philosophy of language.\n\nAnd yet, though he may not be a philosopher of language in any formal\nsense, he has been recognized as one of the founders of the modern\nconcept of literature (Cummings 2013). Throughout his work, Erasmus\nconducts a profound inquiry into literary mimesis, even and especially\nin regard to the gospels and their representation of Jesus Christ.\nFrom his engagement with sacred letters, there emerges a vital and\nchallenging theory of literature and a strong commitment to the\ncentral importance of literature for human life. This theory\nencompasses questions of literal and figurative meaning, of the\nlikeness of speech and thought, of the relationaship of res\nand verba, and of the primacy of verbal over visual\nrepresentation. All these issues may indeed be of interest to the\nphilosophy of language even when this philosophy eschews Scripture.\n\n",
