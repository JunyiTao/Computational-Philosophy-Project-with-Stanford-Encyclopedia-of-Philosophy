    "main_text": "Sequential decisions || The EU axioms revisited\n6.2 The EU axioms revisited\n\nWe have seen that sequential decision trees can help an agent like\nUlysses take stock of the consequences of his current choice, so that\nhe can better reflect on what to do now. The literature on\nsequential choice is primarily concerned, however, with more ambitious\nquestions. The sequential-decision setting effectively offers new ways\nto \u201ctest\u201d theories of rational preference and norms for\npreference (or belief and desire) change. The question is whether an\nagent\u2019s decision theory in this broad sense is shown to be\ndynamically inconsistent or self-defeating.\n\nSkyrms\u2019 (1993) \u201cdiachronic Dutch book\u201d argument for\nconditionalisation can be read in this way. The agent is assumed to\nhave EU preferences and to take a sophisticated (backwards reasoning)\napproach to sequential decision problems. Skyrms shows that any such\nagent who plans to learn in a manner at odds with conditionalisation\nwill make self-defeating choices in some specially contrived\nsequential decision situations. A conditionalising agent, by contrast,\nwill never make choices that are self-defeating in this way. The kind\nof \u201cself-defeating choices\u201d at issue here are ones that\nyield a sure loss. That is, the agent chooses a strategy that is\nsurely worse, by her own lights, than another strategy that she might\notherwise have chosen, if only her learning rule was such that she\nwould choose differently at one or more future decision nodes.\n\nA similar \u201cdynamic consistency\u201d argument can be used to\ndefend EU preferences in addition to learning in accordance with\nconditionalisation (see Hammond 1976, 1977, 1988b,c). It is assumed,\nas before, that the agent takes a sophisticated approach to sequential\ndecision problems. Hammond shows that only a fully Bayesian agent can\nplan to pursue any path in a sequential decision tree that is deemed\noptimal at the initial choice node. This makes the Bayesian agent\nunique in that she will never make \u201cself-defeating\nchoices\u201d on account of her preferences and norms for preference\nchange. She will never choose a strategy that is worse by her own\nlights than another strategy that she might otherwise have chosen, if\nonly her preferences were such that she would choose differently at\none or more future decision nodes.\n\nHammond\u2019s argument for EU theory, and the notion of dynamic\nconsistency that it invokes, has been criticised from different\nquarters, both by those who defend theories that violate the\nIndependence axiom but retain the Completeness and Transitivity (i.e.,\nOrdering) axioms of EU theory, and those who defend theories that\nviolate the latter (for discussion, see Steele 2010). The approach\ntaken by some defenders of Independence-violating theories (notably,\nMachina 1989 and McClennen 1990) has already been alluded to: They\nreject the assumption of sophisticated choice underpinning the dynamic\nconsistency arguments. Seidenfeld (1988a,b, 1994, 2000a,b) rather\nrejects Hammond\u2019s notion of dynamic consistency in favour of a\nmore subtle notion that discriminates between theories that violate\nOrdering and those that violate Independence alone; the former, unlike\nthe latter, pass Seidenfeld\u2019s test that turns on future decision\nnodes where the agent is indifferent between the best options. This\nargument too is not without its critics (see McClennen 1988, Hammond\n1988a, Rabinowicz 2000).\n\nNote that the costs of any departure from EU theory are well\nhighlighted by Al-Najjar and Weinstein (2009), in particular the\npossibility of aversion to free information and aversion to\nopportunities for greater choice in the future. Kadane et al. (2008)\nand Bradley and Steele (2016) focus on the sure loss that is\nassociated with paying to avoid free evidence. But see Buchak (2010,\n2013) for nuanced discussion of this issue in relation to epistemic\nversus instrumental rationality.\n",
