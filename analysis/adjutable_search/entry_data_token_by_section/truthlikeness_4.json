    "main_text": "The Axiological Problem\n3. The Axiological Problem \n\nOur interest in the concept of truthlikeness seems grounded in the\nvalue of highly truthlike theories. And that, in turn, seems grounded\nin the value of truth.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the putative value of truth. Truth is not, of\ncourse, a good-making property of the objects of belief states. The\nproposition \\(h \\amp r \\amp w\\) is not a better proposition\nwhen it happens to be hot, rainy and windy than when it happens to be\ncold, dry and still. Rather, the cognitive state of believing\n\\(h \\amp r \\amp w\\) is often deemed to be a good state to be in if the\nproposition is true, not good if it is false. So the state of\nbelieving truly is better than the state of believing\nfalsely.\n\nAt least some, perhaps most, of the value of believing truly can be\naccounted for instrumentally. Desires mesh with beliefs to produce\nactions that will best achieve what is desired. True beliefs will\ngenerally do a better job of this than false beliefs. If you are\nthirsty and you believe the glass in front of you contains safe\ndrinking water rather than lethal poison then you will be motivated to\ndrink. And if you do drink, you will be better off if the belief you\nacted on was true (you quench your thirst) rather than false (you end\nup dead).\n\nWe can do more with decision theory utilizing purely practical or\nnon-cognitive values. For example, there is a well-known,\ndecision-theoretic, value-of-learning theorem, the\nRamsey-Good theorem, which partially vindicates the value of gathering\nnew information, and it does so in terms of \u201cpractical\u201d\nvalues, without assuming any purely cognitive values. (Good 1967.)\nSuppose you have a choice to make, and you can either choose now, or\nchoose after doing some experiment. Suppose further that you are\nrational (you always choose by expected value) and that the experiment\nis cost-free. It follows that performing the experiment and then\nchoosing always has at least as much expected value as choosing\nwithout further ado. Further, doing the experiment has higher expected\nvalue if one possible outcome of the experiment would alter the\nrelative values of some your options. So, you should do the experiment\njust in case the outcome of the experiment could make a difference to\nwhat you choose to do. Of course, the expected gain of doing the\nexperiment has to be worth the expected cost. Not all information is\nworth pursuing when you have limited time and resources.\n\nDavid Miller notes the following serious limitation of the Ramsey-Good\nvalue-of-learning theorem:\n\nThe argument as it stands simply doesn\u2019t impinge on the question\nof why evidence is collected in those innumerable cases in theoretical\nscience in which no decisions will be, or anyway are envisaged to be,\naffected. (Miller 1994, 141).\n\n\nThere are some things that we think are worth knowing about, the\nknowledge of which would not change the expected value of any action\nthat one might be contemplating performing. We spent billions of\ndollars conducting an elaborate experiment to determine whether the\nHiggs boson exists, and the results were promising enough that Higgs\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize for his prediction. The discovery may also\nyield practical benefits, but it is the cognitive change it\ninduces that makes it worthwhile. It is valuable simply for what it\ndid to our credal state \u2013 not just our credence in the existence\nof the Higgs, but our overall credal state. We may of course be wrong\nabout the Higgs \u2013 the results might be misleading \u2013 but\nfrom our new epistemic viewpoint it certainly appears to us that we\nhave made cognitive gains. We have a little bit more evidence for the\ntruth, or at least the truthlikeness, of the standard model.\n\nWhat we need, it seems, is an account of pure cognitive value, one\nthat embodies the idea that getting at the truth is itself valuable\nwhatever its practical benefits. As noted this possibility was first\nexplicitly raised by Hempel, and developed in various difference ways\nin the 1960s and 1970s by Levi (1967) and Hilpinen (1968), amongst\nothers. (For recent developments see the entry\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism,\n \u00a76.)\n\nWe could take the cognitive value of believing a single proposition\n\\(A\\) to be positive when \\(A\\) is true and negative when \\(A\\) is\nfalse. But acknowledging that belief comes in degrees, the idea might\nbe that the stronger one\u2019s belief in a truth (or of one\u2019s\ndisbelief in a falsehood), the greater the cognitive value. Let \\(V\\)\nbe the characteristic function of answers, both complete and partial,\nto the question \\(\\{C_1, C_2 , \\ldots ,C_n , \\ldots \\}\\). That is to\nsay, where \\(A\\) is equivalent to some disjunction of complete\nanswers:\n\n\\(V_i (A) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) is entailed by the complete answer\n\\(C_i\\) (i.e \\(A\\) is true according to \\(C_i)\\);\n\\(V_i (A) = 0\\) if the negation of \\(A\\) is entailed by the\ncomplete answer \\(C_i\\) (i.e., \\(A\\) is false according to\n\\(C_i)\\).\n\n\nThen the simple view is that the cognitive value of believing \\(A\\) to\ndegree \\(P(A)\\) (where \\(C_i\\) is the complete true answer) is greater\nthe closer \\(P(A)\\) is to the actual value of \\(V_i (A)\\)\u2013 that\nis, the smaller \\(|V_i (A)-P(A)|\\) is. Variants of this idea have been\nendorsed, for example by Horwich (1982, 127\u20139), and Goldman\n(1999), who calls this \u201cveristic value\u201d.\n\n\\(|V_i (A)-P(A)|\\) is a measure of how far \\(P(A)\\) is from \\(V_i\n(A)\\), and \\(-|V_i (A)-P(A)|\\) of how close it is. So here is the\nsimplest linear realization of this desideratum: \n\\[ Cv^1 _i (A, P) = - |V_i (A)-P(A)|. \\]\n\n\nBut there are of course many other measures satisfying the basic idea.\nFor example we have the following quadratic measure: \n\\[ Cv^2 _i (A, P) = -((V_i (A)- P(A))^2. \\]\n\n\nBoth \\(Cv^1\\) and \\(Cv^2\\) reach a maximum when \\(P(A)\\) is maximal\nand \\(A\\) is true, or \\(P(A)\\) is minimal and \\(A\\) is false; and a\nminimum when \\(P(A)\\) is maximal and \\(A\\) is false, or \\(P(A)\\) is\nminimal and \\(A\\) is true.\n\nThese are measures of local value \u2013 the value of\ninvesting a certain degree of belief in a single answer \\(A\\) to the\nquestion \\(Q\\). But we can agglomerate these local values into the\nvalue of a total credal state \\(P\\). This involves a substantive\nassumption: that the value of a credal state is some additive function\nof the values of the individual beliefs states it underwrites. A\ncredal state, relative to inquiry \\(Q\\), is characterized by its\ndistribution of credences over the elements of the partition \\(Q\\). An\nopinionated credal state is one that assigns credence 1 to\njust one of the complete answers. The best credal state to be in,\nrelative to the inquiry \\(Q\\), is the opinionated state that assigns\ncredence 1 to the complete correct answer. This will also assign\ncredence 1 to every true answer, and 0 to every false answer, whether\npartial or complete. In other words, if the correct answer to \\(Q\\) is\n\\(C_i\\) then the best credal state to be in is the one identical to\n\\(V_i\\): for each partial or complete answer \\(A\\) to \\(Q, P(A) = V_i\n(A)\\). This credal state is the state of believing the truth, the\nwhole truth and nothing but the truth about \\(Q\\). Other total credal\nstates (whether opinionated or not) should turn out to be less good\nthan this perfectly accurate credal state. But there will, of course,\nhave to be more constraints on the accuracy and value of total\ncognitive states.\n\nAssuming additivity, the value of the credal state \\(P\\) can be taken\nto be the (weighted) sum of the cognitive values of local belief\nstates.\n\n\\(CV_i(P) = \\sum_A \\lambda_A Cv_i(A,P)\\) (where \\(A\\) ranges over all\nthe answers, both complete and incomplete, to question \\(Q)\\), and the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-terms assign a fixed (non-contingent) weight to the\ncontribution of each answer \\(A\\) to overall accuracy.\n\n\nPlugging in either of the above local cognitive value measures, total\ncognitive value is maximal for an assignment of maximal probability to\nthe true complete answer, and falls off as confidence in the correct\nanswer falls away.\n\nSince there are many different measures that reflect the basic idea of\nthe value of true belief how are we to decide between them? We have\nhere a familiar problem of underdetermination. Joyce (1998) lays down\na number of desiderata, most of them very plausible, for a measure of\nwhat he calls the accuracy of a cognitive state. These\ndesiderata are satisfied by the \\(Cv^2\\) but not by \\(Cv^1\\). In fact\nall the members of a family of closely related measures, of which\n\\(Cv^2\\) is a member, satisfy Joyce\u2019s desiderata:\n\n\\[ CV_i(P) = \\sum_A -\\lambda_A [(V_i (A) - P(A))^2]. \\]\n\n\nGiving equal weight to all propositions \\((\\lambda_A =\\) some non-zero\nconstant \\(c\\) for all \\(A)\\), this is equivalent to the\nBrier measure (see the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism,\n \u00a76). Given the \\(\\lambda\\)\u2013weightings can vary, there is\nconsiderable flexibility in the family of admissible measures.\n\nOur main interest here is whether any of these so-called scoring\nrules (rules which score the overall accuracy of a credal state)\nmight constitute an acceptable measure of the cognitive value of a\ncredal state.\n\nAbsent specific refinements to the \\(\\lambda\\)\u2013weightings, the\nquadratic measures seem unsatisfactory as a solution either to the\nproblem of accuracy or to the problem of cognitive value. Suppose you\nare inquiring into the number of the planets and you end up fully\nbelieving that the number of the planets is 9. Given that the correct\nanswer is 8, your credal state is not perfect. But it is pretty good,\nand it is surely a much better credal state to be in than the\nopinionated state that sets probability 1 on the number of planets\nbeing 9 billion. It seems rather natural to hold that the cognitive\nvalue of an opinionated credal state is sensitive to the degree of\ntruthlikeness of the complete answer that it fixes on, not\njust to its truth value. But this is not endorsed by\nquadratic measures.\n\nJoyce\u2019s desiderata build in the thesis that accuracy is\ninsensitive to the distances of various different complete answers\nfrom the complete true answer. The crucial principle is\nExtensionality.\n\nOur next constraint stipulates that the \u201cfacts\u201d which a\nperson\u2019s partial beliefs must \u201cfit\u201d are exhausted by\nthe truth-values of the propositions believed, and that the only\naspect of her opinions that matter is their strengths. (Joyce 1998,\n591)\n\n\nWe have already seen that this seems wrong for opinionated states that\nconfine all probability to a false hypothesis. Being convinced that\nthe number of planets in the solar system is 9 is better than being\nconvinced that it is 9 billion. But the same idea holds for truths.\nSuppose you believe truly that the number of the planets is either 7,\n8, 9 or 9 billion. This can be true in four different ways. If the\nnumber of the planets is 8 then, intuitively, your belief is a little\nbit closer to the truth than if it is 9 billion. (This judgment is\nendorsed by both the average and the min-sum-average\nproposals.) So even in the case of a true answer to some query, the\nvalue of believing that truth can depend not just on its truth and the\nstrength of the belief, but on where the truth lies. If this is right\nExtensionality is misguided.\n\nJoyce considers a variant of this objection: namely, that given\nExtensionality Kepler\u2019s beliefs about planetary motion would be\njudged to be no more accurate than Copernicus\u2019s. His response is\nthat there will always be propositions which distinguish between the\naccuracy of these falsehoods:\n\nI am happy to admit that Kepler held more accurate beliefs than\nCopernicus did, but I think the sense in which they were more accurate\nis best captured by an extensional notion. While Extensionality rates\nKepler and Copernicus as equally inaccurate when their false beliefs\nabout the earth\u2019s orbit are considered apart from their effects\non other beliefs, the advantage of Kepler\u2019s belief has to do\nwith the other opinions it supports. An agent who strongly believes\nthat the earth\u2019s orbit is elliptical will also strongly believe\nmany more truths than a person who believes that it is circular (e.g.,\nthat the average distance from the earth to the sun is different in\ndifferent seasons). This means that the overall effect of\nKepler\u2019s inaccurate belief was to improve the extensional\naccuracy of his system of beliefs as a whole. Indeed, this is why his\ntheory won the day. I suspect that most intuitions about falsehoods\nbeing \u201cclose to the truth\u201d can be explained in this way,\nand that they therefore pose no real threat to Extensionality. (Joyce\n1998, 592)\n\n\nUnfortunately, this contention \u2013 that considerations of accuracy\nover the whole set of answers which the two theories give will sort\nthem into the right ranking \u2013 isn\u2019t correct (Oddie\n2019).\n\nWallace and Greaves (2005) assert that the weighted quadratic measures\n\u201ccan take account of the value of verisimilitude.\u201d They\nsuggest this can be done \u201cby a judicious choice of the\ncoefficients\u201d (i.e., the \\(\\lambda\\)\u2013values). They go on\nto say: \u201c\u2026 we simply assign high \\(\\lambda_A\\) when \\(A\\)\nis a set of \u2019close\u2019 states.\u201d (Wallace and Greaves\n2005, 628). \u2019Close\u2019 here presumably means \u2019close to\nthe actual world\u2019. But whether an answer \\(A\\) contains complete\nanswers that are close to the actual world \u2013 that is, whether\n\\(A\\) is truthlike \u2013 is clearly a world-dependent\nmatter. The coefficients \\(\\lambda_A\\) were not intended by the\nauthors to be world-dependent. (But whether or not the co-efficients\nof world-dependent or world-independent the quadratic measures cannot\ncapture truthlikeness. See Oddie 2019.)\n\nOne defect of the quadratic class of measures, combined with\nworld-independent weights, corresponds to a problem familiar from the\ninvestigation of attempts to capture truthlikeness simply in terms of\nclasses of true and false consequences, or in terms of truth value and\ncontent alone. Any two complete false answers yield precisely the same\nnumber of true consequences and the same number of false consequences.\nThe local quadratic measure accords the same value to each true answer\nand the same disvalue to each false answer. So if, for example, all\nanswers are given the same \\(\\lambda\\)\u2013weighting in the global\nquadratic measure, any two opinionated false answers will be accorded\nthe same degree of accuracy by the corresponding global measure.\n\nIt may be that there are ways of tinkering with the\n\\(\\lambda\\)\u2013terms to avoid the objection, but on the face of it\nthe notions of local cognitive value embodied in both the linear and\nquadratic rules seem to be deficient because they omit considerations\nof truthlikeness even while valuing truth. It seems that any adequate\nmeasure of the cognitive value of investing a certain degree of belief\nin \\(A\\) should take into account not just whether \\(A\\) is true or\nfalse, but here the truth lies in relation to the worlds in \\(A\\).\n\nWhatever our account of cognitive value, each credal state \\(P\\)\nassigns an expected cognitive value to every credal state \\(Q\\)\n(including \\(P\\) itself of course). \n\\[ \\mathbf{E}CV_P(Q) = \\sum_i P(C_i) CV_i(Q). \\]\n\n\nSuppose we accept the injunction that one ought to maximize expected\nvalue as calculated from the perspective of one\u2019s current credal\nstate. Let us say that a credal state \\(P\\) is self-defeating\nif to maximize expected value from the perspective of \\(P\\) itself one\nwould have to adopt some distinct credal state \\(Q\\), without the\nbenefit of any new information:\n\n\\(P\\) is self-defeating = for some \\(Q\\) distinct from \\(P\\),\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)CV\\(_P\\)\\((Q) \\gt\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)CV\\(_P\\)\\((P)\\).\n\n\nThe requirement of propriety requires that no credal state be\nself-defeating. No credal state demands that you shift to another\ncredal state without new information. One feature of the quadratic\nfamily of proper scoring rules is that they guarantee\npropriety, and propriety is an extremely attractive\nfeature of cognitive value. From propriety alone, one can\nconstruct arguments for the various elements of probabilism. For\nexample, propriety effectively guarantees that the credence\nfunction must obey the standard axioms governing additivity (Leitgeb\nand Pettigrew 2010); propriety guarantees a version of the\nvalue-of-learning theorem in purely cognitive terms (Oddie, 1997);\npropriety provides an argument that conditionalization is the\nonly method of updating compatible with the maximization of expected\ncognitive value (Oddie 1997, Greaves and Wallace 2005, and Leitgeb and\nPettigrew 2010). Not only does propriety deliver these goods for\nprobabilism, but any account of cognitive value that doesn\u2019t\nobey propriety entails that self-defeating probability\ndistributions should be eschewed a priori. (And that might\nappear to violate a fundamental commitment of empiricism.)\n\nThere is however a powerful argument that any measure of cognitive\nvalue that satisfies propriety cannot deliver a fundamental\ndesideratum on an adequate theory of truthlikeness (or accuracy): the\nprinciple of proximity. Every serious account of\ntruthlikeness satisfies proximity. But proximity and\npropriety turn out to be incompatible, given only very weak\nassumptions (see Oddie 2019 and, for an extended critique, also\nSchoenfield 2022). If this is right then the best account of\ngenuine accuracy cannot provide a vindication of pure\nprobabilism.\n",
