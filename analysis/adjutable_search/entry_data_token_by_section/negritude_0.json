    "main_text": "The genesis of the concept\n1. The genesis of the concept\n\nThe concept of N\u00e9gritude emerged as the expression of a revolt\nagainst the historical situation of French colonialism and racism. The\nparticular form taken by that revolt was the product of the encounter,\nin Paris, in the late 1920s, of three black students coming from\ndifferent French colonies: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\n(1913\u20132008) from Martinique, L\u00e9on Gontran Damas\n(1912\u20131978) from Guiana and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor\n(1906\u20132001) from Senegal. Being colonial subjects meant that\nthey all belonged to people considered uncivilized, naturally in need\nof education and guidance from Europe, namely France. In addition, the\nmemory of slavery was very vivid in Guiana and Martinique. Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire and L\u00e9on Damas were already friends before they\ncame to Paris in 1931. They were classmates in Fort-de-France,\nMartinique, where they both graduated from Victor Schoelcher High\nSchool. Damas came to Paris to study Law while C\u00e9saire had been\naccepted at Lyc\u00e9e Louis Le Grand to study for the highly\nselective test for admission to the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure on rue d\u2019Ulm. Upon his arrival at the\nLyc\u00e9e on the first day of classes he met Senghor who had\nalready been a student at Louis le Grand for three years.\n\nC\u00e9saire has described his first encounter with Senghor as\nfriendship at first sight which would last for the rest of their\nfairly long lives. He has also added that their personal friendship\nmeant the encounter between Africa and the African\n Diaspora.[1]\n C\u00e9saire, Damas and Senghor had individual lived experiences of\ntheir feeling of revolt against a world of racism and colonial\ndomination. In the case of C\u00e9saire that feeling was expressed\nin his detestation of Martinique which, as he confessed in an\ninterview with French author Fran\u00e7oise Verg\u00e8s, he was\nhappy to leave after high school: he hated the \u201ccolored\npetit-bourgeois\u201d of the island because of their\n\u201cfundamental tendency to ape Europe\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2005,\n19). As for Senghor, he has written that in his revolt against his\nteachers at College Libermann high school in Dakar, he had discovered\n\u201cn\u00e9gritude\u201d before having the concept: he refused\nto accept their claim that through their education they were building\nChristianity and civilization in his soul where there was nothing but\npaganism and barbarism before. Now their encounter as people of\nAfrican descent regardless of where they were from would lead to the\ntransformation of their individual feelings of revolt into a concept\nthat would also unify all Black people and overcome the separation\ncreated by slavery but also by the prejudices born out of the\ndifferent paths taken. C\u00e9saire has often evoked the\nembarrassment felt by people from the Caribbean at the idea of being\nassociated with Africans as they shared Europe\u2019s ideas that they\nwere now living in the lands of the civilized. He quotes as an example\na \u201csnobbish\u201d young Antillean who came to him protesting\nthat he talked too much about Africa, claiming that they had nothing\nin common with that continent and its peoples: \u201cthey are\nsavages, we are different\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2005, 28).\n\nBeyond the encounter between Africa and the French Caribbean\nC\u00e9saire, Senghor and Damas also discovered together the\nAmerican movement of Harlem Renaissance. At the \u201csalon\u201d,\nin Paris, hosted by sisters from Martinique, Jane, Paulette and\nAndr\u00e9e Nardal, they met many Black American writers, such as\nLangston Hughes or Claude McKay. With the writers of the Harlem\nRenaissance movement they found an expression of black pride, a\nconsciousness of a culture, an affirmation of a distinct identity that\nwas in sharp contrast to French assimilationism. In a word they were\nready to proclaim the n\u00e9gritude of the \u201cnew Negro\u201d\nto quote the title of the anthology of Harlem writers by Alain Locke\nwhich very much impressed Senghor and his friends (Vaillant 1990,\n93\u201394).\n\nAn important precision needs to be made here about the space created\nby the Nardal sisters for Negritude. Thus, T. Deanan Sharpley-Whiting\ncalls attention to the fact that a \u201cmasculinist genealogy\nconstructed by the poets and shored up by literary historians,\ncritics, and Africanist philosophers continues to elide and minimize\nthe presence and contributions of black women, namely their\nfrancophone counterparts, to the movement\u2019s evolution\u201d\n(Sharpley-Whiting, 2000, 10). And she quotes a letter from Paulette\nNardal, written in 1960, in which she \u201c\u2018bitterly\ncomplained\u2019 of the erasure of her and Jane Nardal\u2019s roles\nin the promulgation of the ideas that would later become the hallmarks\nof C\u00e9saire, Damas, and Senghor\u201d (Sharpley-Whiting, 2000,\n10). It must be recalled, in particular, concerning the\n\u201cgenealogy\u201d of the movement, that an article by Jane\nNardal, entitled \u201cInternationalisme noir\u201d, published in\n1928, predated by more than ten years the first important theoretical\narticle published by Senghor: \u201cWhat the Black Man\nContributes\u201d (published in 1939). What Jane Nardal says in her\nshort article about a \u201cNegro sprit\u201d transcending the\ndifferences inevitably created by the course of history, about the\nimportance of \u201cturning back toward Africa (\u2026) in\nremembering a common origin\u201d, or about the significance, first\nand foremost for the Africans themselves, of the discovery by\nEuropeans (first the \u201csnobs and artists\u201d among them) of\n\u201cNegro art\u201d and, more generally, \u201cthe centers of\nAfrican civilizations, their religious systems, their forms of\ngovernment, their artistic wealth\u201d (Nardal, 2002,\n105\u2013107), are all notions and themes that will be developed by\nSenghor, C\u00e9saire, and Damas.\n",
