    "main_text": "Possible Worlds and Modal Logic || Extensionality Regained\n1.2 Extensionality Regained\n\nThe idea of possible worlds raised the prospect of extensional\nrespectability for modal logic, not by rendering modal logic itself\nextensional, but by endowing it with an extensional semantic theory\n\u2014 one whose own logical foundation is that of classical\npredicate logic and, hence, one on which possibility and necessity can\nultimately be understood along classical Tarskian lines. Specifically,\nin possible world semantics, the modal operators are\ninterpreted as quantifiers over possible worlds, as expressed\ninformally in the following two general principles: \n\n\n\nNec\n\n A sentence of the form \u2308Necessarily,\n\u03c6\u2309\n(\u2308\u25fb\u03c6\u2309) is true if and only\nif \u03c6 is true in every possible\n world.[3]\n \n\n\n\n\nPoss\n\n A sentence of the form \u2308Possibly,\n\u03c6\u2309\n(\u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309) is true if and only\nif \u03c6 is true in some possible world.  \n\n\nGiven this, the failures of the classical substitutivity principles\ncan be traced to the fact that modal operators, so interpreted,\nintroduce contexts that require subtler notions of meaning for\nsentences and their component parts than are provided in classical\nlogic; in particular, a subtler notion (to be clarified shortly) is\nrequired for predicates than that of the set of things they happen to\napply to. \n\n\nTarskian Semantics. Standard model theoretic semantics for the\nlanguages of predicate logic deriving from the work of Tarski (1933,\n1944) is the paradigmatic semantic theory for extensional logics.\nGiven a standard first-order language \u2112, a Tarskian\ninterpretation I for \u2112 specifies a set\nD for the quantifiers of \u2112 to range over (typically, some\nset of things that \u2112 has been designed to describe) and assigns,\nto each term (constant or variable) \u03c4 of \u2112, a referent\na\u03c4 \u2208 D and, to each n-place\npredicate \u03c0 of \u2112, an appropriate extension\nE\u03c0 \u2014 a truth value (TRUE or FALSE) if\nn = 0, a subset of D if n = 1, and a set of\nn-tuples of members of D if n > 1. Given these\nassignments, sentences are evaluated as true under the interpretation\nI \u2014 trueI, for short \u2014 according\nto a more or less familiar set of clauses. To facilitate the\ndefinition, let I[\u03bd/a] be the interpretation that\nassigns the individual a to the variable \u03bd and is otherwise\nexactly like I. Then we have: \n\n\n\n An atomic sentence\n\u2308\u03c0\u03c41...\u03c4n\u2309\n(of \u2112) is trueI if and only if\n\n\n n = 0 (i.e., \u03c0 is a sentence letter) and the extension\nof \u03c0 is the truth value TRUE; or \n n = 1 and a\u03c41 is in the\nextension of \u03c0; or \n n > 1 and \u27e8a\u03c41,\n..., a\u03c4n\u27e9 is in the\nextension of \u03c0. \n \n A negation \u2308\u00ac\u03c8\u2309 is\ntrueI if and only if \u03c8 is not\ntrueI. \n A material conditional\u2308\u03c8 \u2192\n\u03b8\u2309 is trueI iff, if \u03c8 is\ntrueI, then \u03b8 is trueI.\n\n A universally quantified sentence\n\u2308\u2200\u03bd\u03c8\u2309 is\ntrueI if and only if, for all individuals a\n\u2208 D, \u03c8 is\n trueI[\u03bd/a].[4]\n\n\n\nClauses for the other standard Boolean operators and the existential\nquantifier under their usual definitions follow straightaway from\nthese clauses. In particular, where \n\n\n\n\n\n \u2203\u03bd\u03c6 =def\n\u00ac\u2200\u03bd\u00ac\u03c6  \n\n\nit follows that: \n\n An existentially quantified sentence\n\u2308\u2203\u03bd\u03c8\u2309 is is\ntrueI if and only if, for some individual a\n\u2208 D, \u03c8 is trueI[\u03bd/a].\n\n\n\nIt is easy to verify that, in each of the above cases, replacing one\ncoextensional term, predicate, or sentence for another has no effect\non the truth values rendered by the above clauses, thus guaranteeing\nthe validity of the classical substitutivity principles and, hence,\nthe extensionality of first-order logic with a Tarskian semantics.\n\n\nFrom Tarskian to Possible World Semantics. The truth\nconditional clauses for the three logical operators directly reflect\nthe meanings of the natural language expressions they symbolize:\n\u2018\u00ac\u2019 means not; \u2018\u2192\u2019 means\nif...then; \u2018\u2200\u2019 means all. It is\neasy to see, however, that we cannot expect to add an equally simple\nclause for sentences containing an operator that symbolizes necessity.\nFor a Tarskian interpretation fixes the domain of\nquantification and the extensions of all the predicates. Pretty\nclearly, however, to capture necessity and possibility, one must be\nable to consider alternative \u201cpossible\u201d domains of\nquantification and alternative \u201cpossible\u201d extensions for\npredicates as well. For, intuitively, under different circumstances,\nfewer, more, or other things might have existed and things that\nactually exist might, in those circumstances, have had very different\nproperties. (6), for example, is false because John could have had\nnon-mammalian pets: a canary, say, or a turtle, or, under\nvery different circumstances, a dragon. A bit more formally\nput: Both the domain of quantification and the extension of the\npredicate \u2018P\u2019 could, in some sense or other, have\nbeen different. \n\nPossible world semantics, of course, uses the concept of a possible\nworld to give substance to the idea of alternative extensions and\nalternative domains of quantification. (Possible world semantics can\nbe traced most clearly back to the work of Carnap (1947), its basic\ndevelopment culminating in the work of Hintikka (1957, 1961), Bayart\n(1958, 1959), and Kripke (1959, 1963a, 1963b).[5])\n Similar to Tarskian semantics, a possible world interpretation\nM of a modal language \u2112 specifies a nonempty set\nD, although thought of now as the set of \u201cpossible\nindividuals\u201d of M. Also as in Tarskian semantics,\nM assigns each term \u03c4 of \u2112 a referent\na\u03c4 in\n D.[6]\n Additionally however, M specifies a set W, the set of\n\u201cpossible worlds\u201d of M, one of which is designated\nits \u201cactual world\u201d, and each world w in W is\nassigned its own domain of quantification, d(w) \u2286\nD, intuitively, the set of individuals that exist in\n w.[7]\n To capture the idea of both the actual and possible extensions of a\npredicate, M assigns to each n-place predicate \u03c0 a\nfunction M\u03c0 \u2014 the intension of\n\u03c0 \u2014 that, for each possible world w, returns the\nextension M\u03c0(w) of \u03c0\nat w: a truth value, if n = 0; a set of\nindividuals, if n = 1; and a set of n-tuples of\nindividuals, if n >\n 1.[8]\n We can thus rigorously define a \u201cpossible extension\u201d of a\npredicate \u03c0 to be any of its w-extensions\nM\u03c0(w), for any world w. \n\nThe Tarskian truth conditions above are now generalized by\nrelativizing them to worlds as follows: for any possible world\nw (the world of evaluation): \n\n An atomic sentence\n\u2308\u03c0\u03c41...\u03c4n\u2309\n(of \u2112) is trueM at w if\nand only if:\n\n\n n = 0 and the w-extension of \u03c0 is the truth\nvalue TRUE; or \n n = 1 and a\u03c41 is in the\nw-extension of \u03c0; or \n n > 1 and\n\u27e8a\u03c41,...,\na\u03c4n\u27e9 is in the\nw-extension of \u03c0. \n \n A negation \u2308\u00ac\u03c8\u2309 is\ntrueM at w if and only \u03c8 is not\ntrueM in w. \n A material\nconditional\u2308\u03c8\u2192\u03b8\u2309 is\ntrueM at w iff, if \u03c8 is\ntrueM at w, then \u03b8 is\ntrueM at w. \n\n\n A quantified sentence\n\u2308\u2200\u03bd\u03c8\u2309 is\ntrueM at w if and only if, for all\nindividuals a that exist in w, \u03c8 is\ntrueM[\u03bd/a]. \n\n\nAnd to these, of course, is added the critical modal case that\nexplicitly interprets the modal operator to be a quantifier over\nworlds, as we'd initially anticipated informally in our principle\n Nec:\n \n\n A necessitation \u2308\u25fb\u03c8\u2309\nis trueM at w if and only if, for all\npossible worlds u of M, \u03c8 is trueM\nat\n u.[9]\n\n\n\n\nA sentence \u03c6 is falseM at w just\nin case it is not trueM at w, and \u03c6 is\nsaid to be trueM just in case \u03c6 is\ntrueM at the actual world of M.\n\nOn the assumption that there is a (nonempty) set of all possible\nworlds and a set of all possible individuals, we can define\n\u201cobjective\u201d notions of truth at a world and of truth\nsimpliciter, that is, notions that are not simply relative to\nformal, mathematical interpretations but, rather, correspond to\nobjective reality in all its modal glory. Let \u2112 be a modal\nlanguage whose names and predicates represent those in some fragment\nof ordinary language (as in our examples (5) and (6) above). Say that\nM is the \u201cintended\u201d interpretation of \u2112 if\n(i) its set W of \u201cpossible worlds\u201d is in fact the\nset of all possible worlds, (ii) its designated \u201cactual\nworld\u201d is in fact the actual world, (iii) its set D of\n\u201cpossible individuals\u201d is in fact the set of all possible\nindividuals, and (iv) the referents assigned to the names of \u2112\nand the intensions assigned to the predicates of \u2112 are the ones\nthey in fact have. Then, where M is the intended interpretation\nof \u2112, we can say that a sentence \u03c6 of \u2112 is true\nat a possible world w just in case \u03c6 is\ntrueM at w, and that \u03c6 is true\njust in case it is trueM at the actual world.\n(Falsity at w and falsity, simpliciter, are defined\naccordingly.) Under the assumption in question, then, the modal clause\nabove takes on pretty much the exact form of our informal principle\n Nec.\n\nCall the above basic possible world semantics. Spelling out the\ntruth conditions for (6) (relative to the intended interpretation of\nits language), basic possible world semantics tells us that (6) is\ntrue if and only if \n\n\n\n\n For all possible worlds w,\n\u2018\u2200x(Px \u2192 Mx)\u2019 is true at\nw.  \n\n\nAnd by unpacking (8) in terms of the quantificational, material\nconditional, and atomic clauses above we have that (6) is true if and\nonly if \n\n\n\n\n For all possible worlds w, and for all possible\nindividuals a that exist in w, if a is in the\nw-extension of \u2018P\u2019 then a is in the\nw-extension of \u2018M\u2019.  \n\n\nSince we are evaluating (6) with regard to the intended interpretation\nof its language, the w-extension of \u2018P\u2019 that\nis returned by its intension, for any world w, is the (perhaps\nempty) set of John's pets in w and that of\n\u2018M\u2019 is the set of mammals in w. Hence, if\nw is a world where John has a pet canary \u2014 COBOL, say\n\u2014 COBOL is in the w-extension of \u2018P\u2019\nbut not that of \u2018M\u2019 , i.e.,\n\u2018\u2200x(Px \u2192 Mx)\u2019 is false at\nw and, hence, by the truth condition (9), (6) is false at the\nactual world \u2014 that is, (6) is false simpliciter, as it\nshould be. \n\nNote that interpreting modal operators as quantifiers over possible\nworlds provides a nice theoretical justification for the usual\ndefinition of the possibility operator in terms of necessity,\nspecifically: \n\n\n\n\n\n \u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309 =def\n\u2308\u00ac\u25fb\u00ac\u03c6\u2309. \n\n\n\nThat is, a sentence is possible just in case its negation isn't\nnecessary. Since, semantically speaking, the necessity operator is\nliterally a universal quantifier, the definition corresponds\nexactly to the definition\n (7)\n of the existential quantifier. For, unpacking the right side of\ndefinition (10) according to the negation and necessitation clauses\nabove (and invoking the definitions of truth and truth at a world\nsimpliciter), we have: \n\n\n\n\n \u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309 is true iff it\nis not the case that, for all possible worlds w, \u03c6 is not\ntrue at w.  \n\n\nClearly, however, if it is not the case that \u03c6 fails to be true at\nall possible worlds, then it must be true at some world; hence: \n\n\n\n\n \u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309 is true iff,\nfor some possible world w, \u03c6 is true at w. \n\n\n\nAnd that corresponds exactly to our intuitive truth condition\n Poss\n above. Thus, spelling out the negation\n\u2018\u00ac\u25a1\u2200x(Px \u2192 Mx)\u2019\nof our false sentence\n (6)\n above in accordance with definition (10) (and the standard definition\nof conjunction \u2227), we have: \n\n\n\n\n\nPossibly, one of John's pets is not a mammal:\n\u25c7\u2203x(Px \u2227 \u00acMx),  \n\n\nfor which (12) and the possible world truth conditions for quantified,\nBoolean, and atomic sentences yield the correct truth condition: \n\n\n\n\n\n There is a possible world w and an individual a\nexisting in w that is in the w-extension of\n\u2018P\u2019 but not that of \u2018M\u2019, \n\n\n\nthat is, less stuffily, there is a possible world in which, among\nJohn's pets, at least one is not a mammal. \n\nSummary: Intensionality and Possible Worlds. Analyzed in terms\nof possible world semantics, then, the general failure of classical\nsubstitutivity principles in modal logic is due, not to an irreducibly\nintensional element in the meanings of the modal operators, but rather\nto a sort of mismatch between the surface syntax of those operators\nand their semantics: syntactically, they are unary sentence operators\nlike negation; but semantically, they are, quite literally,\nquantifiers. Their syntactic similarity to negation suggests that,\nlike negation, the truth values of\n\u2308\u25a1\u03c6\u2309 and\n\u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309, insofar as they are\ndeterminable at all, must be determined by the truth value of \u03c6.\nThat they are not (in general) so determined leads to the distinctive\nsubstitutivity failures noted above. The possible worlds analysis of\nthe modal operators as quantifiers over worlds reveals that the unary\nsyntactic form of the modal operators obscures a semantically relevant\nparameter. When the modal operators are interpreted as quantifiers,\nthis parameter becomes explicit and the reason underlying the failure\nof extensionality in modal logic becomes clear: That the truth values\nof \u2308\u25a1\u03c6\u2309 and\n\u2308\u25c7\u03c6\u2309 are not in general\ndetermined by the truth value of \u03c6 at the world of evaluation is,\nsemantically speaking, nothing more than the fact that the truth\nvalues of \u2018\u2200xFx\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2203xFx\u2019 are not in general determined by the\ntruth value of \u2018Fx\u2019, for any particular value of\n\u2018x\u2019. Possible world semantics, therefore,\nexplains the intensionality of modal logic by revealing that\nthe syntax of the modal operators prevents an adequate expression of\nthe meanings of the sentences in which they occur. Spelled out as\npossible world truth conditions, those meanings can be expressed in a\nwholly extensional fashion.\n (For\n a more formal exposition of this point, see the supplemental article\n The Extensionality of Possible World Semantics.)\n \n1.3 Two Applications: The Analysis of Intensions and the De Re / De Dicto Distinction\n\nAs noted, the focus of the present article is on the metaphysics of\npossible worlds rather than applications. Of course, the semantics of\nmodal languages is itself an application, but one that is of singular\nimportance, both for historical reasons and because most applications\nare in fact themselves applications of (often extended or modified\nversions of) the semantical apparatus. Two particularly important\nexamples are the analysis of intensions and a concomitant explication\nof the de re/de dicto\n distinction.[10]\n\n\nThe Analysis of Intensions. As much a barrier to the acceptance\nof modal logic as intensionality itself was the need to appeal to\nintensions per se \u2014 properties, relations,\npropositions, and the like \u2014 in semantical explanations.\nIntensional entities have of course featured prominently in the\nhistory of philosophy since Plato and, in particular, have played\nnatural explanatory roles in the analysis of\n intentional attitudes\n like\n belief\n and\n mental content.\n For all their prominence and importance, however, the nature of these\nentities has often been obscure and controversial and, indeed, as a\nconsequence, they were easily dismissed as ill-understood and\nmetaphysically suspect \u201ccreatures of darkness\u201d (Quine\n1956, 180) by the naturalistically oriented philosophers of the early-\nto mid-20th century. It is a virtue of possible world semantics that\nit yields rigorous definitions for intensional entities. More\nspecifically, as described above, possible world semantics assigns to\neach n-place predicate \u03c0 a certain function\nI\u03c0 \u2014 \u03c0's intension \u2014 that, for\neach possible world w, returns the extension\nI\u03c0(w) of \u03c0 at w. We can define\nan intension per se, independent of any language, to be any\nsuch function on worlds. More specifically: \n\n A proposition is any function from worlds to truth\nvalues. \n A property is any function from worlds to sets of\nindividuals. \n An n-place relation (n > 1) is any\nfunction from worlds to sets of n-tuples of individuals. \n\n\nThe adequacy of this analysis is a matter of lively debate that\nfocuses chiefly upon whether or not intensions, so defined, are too\n\u201ccoarse-grained\u201d to serve their intended purposes. (See,\ne.g., Stalnaker 1987 and 2012 for a strong defense of the analysis.)\nHowever, Lewis (1986, \u00a71.5) argues that, even if the above\nanalysis fails for certain purposes, it does not follow that\nintensions cannot be analyzed in terms of possible worlds, but only\nthat more subtle constructions might be required. This reply appears\nto side-step the objections from granularity while preserving the\ngreat advantage of the possible worlds analysis of intensions, viz.,\nthe rigorous definability of these philosophically significant\nnotions. \n\nThe De Re / De Dicto Distinction. A particularly\nrich application of the possible world analysis of intensions concerns\nthe analysis of the venerable distinction between de re and\nde dicto\n modality.[11]\n Among the strongest modal intuitions is that the possession of a\nproperty has a modal character \u2014 that things exemplify, or fail\nto exemplify, some properties necessarily, or\nessentially, and others only accidentally. Thus, for\nexample, intuitively, John's dog Algol is a pet accidentally; under\nless fortunate circumstances, she might have been, say, a stray that\nno one ever adopted. But she is a dog essentially; she couldn't have\nbeen a flower, a musical performance, a crocodile or any other kind of\nthing. \n\nSpelling out this understanding in terms of worlds and the preceding\nanalysis of intensions, we can say that an individual a has a\nproperty F essentially if a has F in every world\nin which it exists, that is, if, for all worlds w in which\na exists, a \u2208 F(w). Likewise,\na has F accidentally if a has F in the\nactual world @ but lacks it in some other world, that is, if a\n\u2208 F(@) but, for some world w in which a\nexists, a \u2209 F(w). Thus, let\n\u2018G\u2019 and \u2018T\u2019 symbolize \u2018is\na dog\u2019 and \u2018is someone's pet\u2019, respectively; then,\nwhere \u2018E!x\u2019 is short for\n\u2018\u2203y(x=y)\u2019 (and, hence,\nexpresses that x exists), we have: \n\n\n\n\n\n Algol is a dog essentially: \u25a1(E!a \u2192\nGa)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Algol is a pet accidentally: Ta \u2227 \u25c7(E!a\n\u2227 \u00acTa)  \n\n\nMore generally, sentences like (15) and (16) in which properties are\nascribed to a specific individual in a modal context \u2014 signaled\nformally by the occurrence of a name or the free occurrence of a\nvariable in the scope of a modal operator \u2014 are said to exhibit\nmodality de\n re[12]\n (modality of the thing). Modal sentences that do not, like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Necessarily, all dogs are mammals:\n\u25a1\u2200x(Gx \u2192 Mx)  \n\n\nare said to exhibit modality de dicto (roughly, modality of\nthe proposition). Possible\nworld semantics provides an illuminating analysis of the key\ndifference between the two: The truth conditions for both modalities\ninvolve a commitment to possible worlds; however, the truth conditions\nfor sentences exhibiting modality de re involve in addition a\ncommitment to the meaningfulness of\n transworld identity,\n the thesis that, necessarily, every individual (typically, at any\nrate) exists and exemplifies (often very different) properties in many\ndifferent possible worlds. More specifically, basic possible world\nsemantics yields intuitively correct truth values for sentences of the\nlatter sort by (i) permitting world domains to overlap and (ii)\nassigning intensions to predicates, thereby, in effect, relativizing\npredicate extensions to worlds. In this way, one and the same\nindividual can be in the extension of a given predicate at all worlds\nin which they exist, at some such worlds only, or at none at all. (For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties.)\n \n2. Three Philosophical Conceptions of Possible Worlds\n\nThe power and appeal of basic possible world semantics is undeniable.\nIn addition to providing a clear, extensional formal semantics for a\nformerly somewhat opaque, intensional notion, cashing possibility as\ntruth in some possible world and necessity as truth in every such\nworld seems to tap into very deep intuitions about the nature of\nmodality and the meaning of our modal discourse. Unfortunately, the\nsemantics leaves the most interesting \u2014 and difficult \u2014\nphilosophical questions largely unanswered. Two arise with particular\nforce: \n\n\nQW\n\n What, exactly, is a possible world?  \n\n\nAnd, given QW: \n\n\nQE\n\n What is it for something to exist in a possible world? \n\n\n\nIn this section we will concern ourselves with, broadly speaking, the\nthree most prominent philosophical approaches to these\n questions.[13]\n\n2.1 Concretism\n\nRecall the informal picture that we began with: a world is, so to say,\nthe \u201climit\u201d of a series of increasingly more inclusive\nsituations. Fleshed out philosophical accounts of this informal idea\ngenerally spring from rather different intuitions about what one takes\nthe \u201csituations\u201d in the informal picture to be. A\nparticularly powerful intuition is that situations are simply\nstructured collections of physical objects: the immediate situation of\nour initial example above, for instance, consists of, among other\nthings, the objects in Anne's office \u2014 notably Anne herself, her\ndesk and her computer, with her seated at the former and typing on the\nlatter \u2014 and at least some of the things in the next room\n\u2014 notably, her husband and the phone he is talking on. On this\nview, for one situation s to include another r is simply\nfor r to be a (perhaps rather complex and distributed) physical\npart of s. The actual world, then, as the limit of a series of\nincreasingly more inclusive situations in this sense, is simply the\nentire physical universe: all the things that are some spatiotemporal\ndistance from the objects in some arbitrary initial situation,\nstructured as they in fact are; and other possible worlds are things\nof exactly the same sort. Call this the concretist intuition,\nas possible worlds are understood to be concrete physical situations\nof a special sort. \n2.1.1 Concrete Worlds and Existence Therein\n\nThe originator and, by far, the best known proponent of concretism is\n David Lewis.\n For Lewis and, as noted, concretists generally, the actual world is\nthe concrete physical universe as it is, stretched out in space-time.\nAs he rather poetically expresses it (1986, 1): \n\nThe world we live in is a very inclusive thing....There is nothing so\nfar away from us as not to be part of our world. Anything at any\ndistance is to be included. Likewise the world is inclusive in time.\nNo long-gone ancient Romans, no long-gone pterodactyls, no long-gone\nprimordial clouds of plasma are too far in the past, nor are the dead\ndark stars too far in the future, to be part of this same\nworld....[N]othing is so alien in kind as not to be part of our world,\nprovided only that it does exist at some distance and direction from\nhere, or at some time before or after or simultaneous with now.\n\n\nThe actual world provides us with our most salient example of what a\npossible world is. But, for the concretist, other possible worlds are\nno different in kind from the actual world (ibid., 2): \n\nThere are countless other worlds, other very inclusive things. Our\nworld consists of us and all our surroundings, however, remote in time\nand space; just as it is one big thing having lesser things as parts,\nso likewise do other worlds have lesser other-worldly things as parts.\n\n\nIt is clear that spatiotemporal relations play a critical role in\nLewis's conception. However, it is important to note that Lewis\nunderstands such relations in a very broad and flexible way so as to\nallow, in particular, for the possibility of spirits and other\nentities that are typically thought of as non-spatial; so long as they\nare located in time, Lewis writes, \u201cthat is good enough\u201d\n(ibid., 73). So with this caveat, let us say that that an\nobject a is connected if any two of its parts bear\nsome spatiotemporal relation to each\n other,[14]\n and that a is maximal if none of its parts is\nspatiotemporally related to anything that is not also one of its\nparts. Then we have the following concretist answers to our questions:\n\n\n\nAW1\n\nw is a possible world =def\nw is a maximal connected\n object.[15]\n \n\n\nAnd, hence, to exist in a world is simply to be a part of it: \n\n\n\nAE1\n\nIndividual a exists in world w =def\na is a part of w.\n \n\n\nIt follows from AW1 (and reasonable assumptions) that distinct\nworlds do not overlap, spatiotemporally; that no spatiotemporal part\nof one world is part of\n another.[16]\n Moreover, given\n Lewis's counterfactual analysis of causation,\n it follows from this that objects in distinct worlds bear no causal\nrelations to one another; nothing that occurs in one world has any\ncausal impact on anything that occurs in any other world. \n2.1.2 Actuality\n\nCritically, for Lewis, worlds and their denizens do not differ in the\nmanner in which they exist. The actual world does not enjoy a\nkind of privileged existence that sets it apart from other worlds.\nRather, what makes the actual world actual is simply that it is\nour world, the world that we happen to inhabit. Other worlds\nand their inhabitants exist just as robustly as we do, and in\nprecisely the same sense; all worlds and all of their denizens are\nequally\n real.[17]\n A significant semantic corollary of this thesis for Lewis is that the\nword \u2018actual\u2019 in the phrase \u2018the actual world\u2019\ndoes not indicate any special property of the actual world that\ndistinguishes it from all other worlds; likewise, an assertion of the\nform \u2018a is actual\u2019 does not indicate any special\nproperty of the individual a that distinguishes it from the\nobjects existing in other worlds. Rather, \u2018actual\u2019 is\nsimply an indexical whose extension is determined by the\ncontext of utterance. Thus, the referent of \u2018the actual\nworld\u2019 in a given utterance is simply the world of the speaker,\njust as the referent of an utterance of \u2018the present\nmoment\u2019 is the moment of the utterance; likewise, an utterance\nof the form \u2018a is actual\u2019 indicates only that\na shares the same world as the speaker. The speaker thereby\nascribes no special property to a but, essentially, expresses\nno more than when she utters \u2018a is here\u2019,\nunderstood in the broadest possible sense. By the same token, when we\nspeak of non-actual possibilia \u2014 Lewis's preferred label\nfor the denizens of possible worlds \u2014 we simply pick out those\nobjects that are not here in the broadest sense. In the mouth\nof an other-worldly metaphysician, we here are all among the\nnon-actual possibilia of which she speaks in her lectures on\nde re modality. \n2.1.3 Modal Reductionism, Counterparts, and the Analysis of Intensions\n\nModal Reductionism and Counterparts. Lewis parted ways\ndramatically with his mentor\n W. V. O. Quine\n on modality. Quine (1960, \u00a741) stands in a long line of\nphilosophers dating back at least to\n David Hume\n who are skeptical, at best, of the idea that modality is an objective\nfeature of reality and, consequently, who question whether modal\nassertions in general can be objectively true or false, or even\ncoherent. Lewis, by contrast, wholly embraces the objectivity of\nmodality and the coherence of our modal discourse. What he denies,\nhowever, is that modality is a fundamentally irreducible\nfeature of the world. Lewis, that is, is a modal\nreductionist. For Lewis, modal notions are not primitive. Rather,\ntruth conditions for modal sentences can be given in terms of worlds\nand their parts; and worlds themselves, Lewis claims, are defined\nentirely in non-modal terms. The earliest presentation of Lewis's\ntheory of modality (Lewis 1968) \u2014 reflecting Quine's\n method of regimentation\n \u2014 offers, rather than a possible world semantics, a scheme for\ntranslating sentences in the language of modal predicate logic\ninto sentences of ordinary first-order logic in which the modal\noperators are replaced by explicit quantifiers over\n worlds.[18]\n The mature account of Lewis 1986 is much more semantic in\norientation: it avoids any talk of translation and offers instead a\n(somewhat informal) account of concretist possible world truth\nconditions for a variety of modal assertions. Nonetheless, it is\nuseful to express the logical forms of these truth conditions\nexplicitly in terms of worlds, existence in a world (in the sense of\nAE1, of course), and the counterpart relation, which\nwill be discussed shortly: \n\n\nWx:\n\nx is a world \n\nIxy:\n\nx exists in world y \n\nCxy:\n\nx is a counterpart of y \n\n\nFor sentences like\n (17)\n involving only de dicto modalities, Lewis's truth conditions\nare similar in form to the truth conditions generated by the modal\nclauses of basic possible world semantics; specifically, for (17):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For every world w, every individual x in w\nthat is a dog is a mammal: \u2200w(Ww \u2192\n\u2200x(Ixw \u2192 (Gx \u2192 Mx))).\n \n\n\nAs in possible world semantics, the modal operators\n\u2018\u25a1\u2019 and \u2018\u25c7\u2019 \u201cturn\ninto\u201d quantifiers over worlds in concretist truth conditions\n(1986, 5). Also as in possible world semantics, a quantifier (in\neffect) ranging over individuals that occurs in the scope of a\nquantifier (in effect) ranging over worlds \u2014\n\u2018\u2200x\u2019 and \u2018\u2200w\u2019,\nrespectively, in (18) \u2014 is, for each value w of the bound\nworld variable, restricted to the objects existing in w.\nHowever, unlike possible world semantics, predicates are not to be\nthought of as having different extensions at different worlds. Rather,\nfor Lewis, each (n-place) predicate has a single extension that\ncan contain (n-tuples of) objects across many different worlds\n\u2014 intuitively, all of the objects that have the property (or\nn-tuples of objects that stand in the relation) expressed by\nthe predicate across all possible worlds. Thus, in particular, the\npredicate \u2018G\u2019 picks out, not just this-worldly dogs\nbut other-worldly canines as well. Likewise, the pet predicate\n\u2018T\u2019 picks out both actual and other-worldly pets.\nSuch a move is not feasible in basic possible world semantics, which\nis designed for a metaphysics in which one and the same individual can\nexemplify a given property in some worlds in which they exist but not\nothers. Hence, a typical predicate will be true of an individual with\nrespect to some worlds and false of it with respect to others. But,\nfor Lewis, as we've seen, distinct possible worlds do not overlap and,\nhence, objects are worldbound, thereby eliminating the need to\nrelativize predicate extensions to worlds. \n\nHowever, this very feature of Lewis's account \u2014 worldboundedness\n\u2014 might appear to threaten its coherence. For example, since\nAlgol is in fact a pet, given worldboundedness and the definition\n AE1\n of existence in a world w, we have: \n\n\n\n\n\n There is no world w such that Algol exists in w\nand fails to be someone's pet: \u00ac\u2203w(Iaw \u2227\n\u00acTa),  \n\n\nBut, according to Lewis's analysis, the modal operators\n\u2018\u25a1\u2019 and \u2018\u25c7\u2019, semantically, are\nquantifiers over worlds. Hence, (19) might appear to be exactly the\nconcretist truth condition for the denial of (the right conjunct of)\n (16),\n i.e., it might appear that, on Lewis's analysis, Algol is not a pet\naccidentally but essentially; likewise, more generally, any individual\nand any intuitively accidental property of that individual. \n\nIn fact, Lewis whole-heartedly accepts that things have accidental\nproperties and, indeed, would accept that\n (16)\n is robustly true. His explanation involves one of the most\ninteresting and provocative elements of his theory: the doctrine of\ncounterparts. Roughly, an object y in a world\nw2 is a counterpart of an object x in\nw1 if y resembles x and nothing else\nin w2 resembles x more than\n y.[19]\n Each object is thus its own (not necessarily unique) counterpart in\nthe world it inhabits but will typically differ in important ways from\nits other-wordly counterparts. A typical other-worldly counterpart of\nAlgol, for example, might resemble her very closely up to some point\nin her history \u2014 a point, say, after which she continued to live\nout her life as a stray instead of being brought home by our kindly\ndog-lover John. Hence, sentences making de re assertions about\nwhat Algol might have done or what she could or could\nnot have been are unpacked, semantically, as sentences about her\ncounterparts in other possible worlds. Thus, when we analyze\n(16) accordingly, we have the entirely unproblematic concretist truth\ncondition: \n\n\n\n\n\n Algol is a pet, but there is a world in which exists a\ncounterpart of hers that is not:\n\nTa \u2227 \u2203w(Ww \u2227\n\u2203x(Ixw \u2227 Cxa \u2227 \u00acTx)).\n \n\n\nAscriptions of essential properties, as in\n (15),\n are likewise unpacked in terms of counterparts: to say that Algol is\na dog essentially is to say that \n\n\n\n\n\n All of Algol's counterparts in any world are dogs:\n\n\u2200w(Ww \u2192 \u2200x((Ixw \u2227\nCxa) \u2192 Gx)).  \n\n\nThe Analysis of Intensions. Lewis's possible world truth\nconditions are expressed in classical non-modal logic and, hence, they\nare to be interpreted by means of standard Tarskian semantics. Thus,\nn-place predicates \u03c0 are assigned extensions\nE\u03c0 \u2014 in particular, for 1-place predicates,\nsets of individuals \u2014 as their semantic values, as described in\nthe exposition in\n \u00a71.2\n above. However, given worldboundedness and the fact that predicate\nextensions are drawn not simply from the actual world but from all\npossible worlds, these extensions are able to serve as\nintensions in Lewis's theory. As in basic possible world\nsemantics, intensional entities in general can be defined in terms of\nthe basic ontology of the theory independent of the linguistic roles\nthey can play as the intensions of predicates. And because individuals\nare worldbound, Lewis is able to simplify the definitions given in\n \u00a71.3\n by defining intensions as sets rather than functions: \n\n A proposition is any set of worlds. \n A property is any set of individuals. \n An n-place relation (n > 1) is any set\nof n-tuples of\n individuals.[20]\n\n\n\nThus, on this analysis, a proposition p is true in a\nworld w just in case w \u2208 p and an individual\na has a property P just in case a \u2208\nP. (Note that propositions are thus simply properties of worlds\non these definitions.) a has P accidentally\njust in case a \u2208 P but b \u2209 P\nfor some other-worldly counterpart of b of a; and\na has P essentially if b \u2208 P\nfor every counterpart b of a. \n\nIn Lewis's theory of modality, then, modal operators are understood\nsemantically to be quantifiers over concrete worlds, predicates denote\nintensions understood as sets of (n-tuples of) parts of those\nworlds, and sentences involving de re modalities are understood\nin terms of counterparts. To the extent that these notions are free of\nmodality, Lewis has arguably reduced modal notions to non-modal. \n2.1.4 Plenitude and Recombination\n\nThat Lewis's truth conditions for modal statements are themselves free\nof modality and, hence, that his theory counts as a genuine reduction\nof modal notions to non-modal is not terribly controversial (albeit\nnot undisputed \u2014 see Lycan 1991, 224\u201327; Divers and Melia\n2002, 22\u201324). Significantly more controversial, and perhaps far\nmore critical to the project, is whether or not his account is\ncomplete, that is, whether or not, for all modal statements\n\u03c6, (i) if \u03c6 is intuitively true, then its Lewisian truth\ncondition holds (ii) if \u03c6 is intuitively false, then its Lewisian\ntruth condition\n fails.[21]\n The challenge to Lewis, then, is that his account can be considered\nsuccessful only if it is complete in this sense. \n\nThe chief question Lewis faces in this regard is whether there are\nenough worlds to do the job. The truth condition\n (20)\n for the intuitively true\n (16)\n says that there exists a possible world in which a counterpart of\nAlgol is no one's pet. By virtue of what in Lewis's theory does such a\nworld exist? The ideal answer for Lewis would be that some principle\nin his theory guarantees a plenitude of worlds, a maximally\nabundant array of worlds that leaves \u201cno gaps in logical space;\nno vacancies where a world might have been, but isn't\u201d (Lewis\n1986, 86). From this it would follow that the worlds required by the\nconcretist truth condition for any intuitive modal truth exist. Toward\nthis end, Lewis initially considers the evocative principle: \n\n\nWays\n\nAbsolutely every way that a world could be is a way that some\nworld is.  \n\n\nSince, in particular, a world satisfying\n (20)\n seems quite obviously to be a way a world could be, by Ways\nsuch a world exists. But there is a fatal flaw here: Lewis himself\n(1973, 84) identifies ways that a world could be with worlds\nthemselves. So understood, Ways collapses into the triviality\nthat every world is identical to some\n world.[22]\n\n\nLewis finds a replacement for Ways in a principle of\nrecombination whereby \u201cpatching together parts of\ndifferent possible worlds yields another possible world\u201d (1986,\n87\u201388). The principle has two aspects. The first is the\nprinciple that \u201canything can coexist with anything\u201d. For\n\u201cif there could be a dragon, and there could be a\nunicorn,\u201d Lewis writes, \u201cbut there couldn't be a dragon\nand a unicorn side by side, that would be ... a failure of\nplenitude\u201d (ibid., 88). Given that individuals are\nworldbound, however, the principle is expressed more rigorously (and\nmore generally) in terms of other-worldly duplicates: \n\n\nR1\n\nFor any (finite or infinite) number of objects\na1, a2, ..., there is a world\ncontaining any number of duplicates of each of those objects in any\nspatiotemporal arrangement (size and shape permitting).  \n\n\nThe second aspect of the principle expresses \u201cthe Humean denial\nof necessary connections\u201d (ibid., 87), that is, the idea\nthat anything can fail to coexist with anything else. For\n\u201cif there could be a talking head contiguous to the rest of a\nliving human body, but there couldn't be a talking head separate from\nthe rest of a human body, that too would be a failure of\nplenitude\u201d (ibid). To express this a bit more rigorously,\nsay that objects a1, a2, ..., are\nindependent of objects b1,\nb2, ..., if no sum of any parts of the former are\nparts or duplicates of any sum of any parts of the latter and vice\nversa; then we have: \n\n\nR2\n\nFor any world w any (finite or infinite number of)\nobjects a1, a2, ..., in w\nand any objects b1, b2, ..., in\nw that are independent of a1,\na2, ..., there is a world containing duplicates of\na1, a2, ..., and no duplicates of\nb1, b2, ... .  \n\n\nWorlds that satisfy the concretist truth conditions for workaday\npossibilities like\n (16)\n are easily conceived as consisting of duplicates of relevant parts of\nthe actual world \u2014 suitably organized to retain their actual\nproperties, or not, as needed. Hence, the existence of such worlds\ndoes indeed appear to follow from the existence of the actual world by\nrecombination. Worlds containing talking donkeys, exotic species\nresulting from a wholly different evolutionary history, worlds with\nsilicon-based life forms, and so on present a bigger challenge to the\nview. Nonetheless, it is not entirely implausible to think such worlds\nexist given suitable duplication and reorganization of microphysical\n objects.[23]\n\n\nWhether recombination completely captures our modal intuitions\nregarding plenitude is still a matter of some\n dispute.[24]\n However, even if it doesn't, it is less than clear whether this\ncounts against the success of Lewis's reductionist project. For, as a\nrealist about worlds, Lewis does not seem to be under any obligation\nto \u201cderive\u201d plenitude from more fundamental principles.\nHence, there is no obvious reason why he cannot respond to charges of\nincompleteness by saying that it is simply a presupposition of his\ntheory that logical space has no gaps, that there are always enough\nworlds to satisfy the concretist truth condition for any intuitive\nmodal\n truth.[25]\n So understood, the role of recombination for a realist about worlds\nlike Lewis is something like the role of such axioms as powerset and\nreplacement for a realist about sets: given some sets, these\nprinciples provide us with a detailed \u2014 but always less than\ncomplete \u2014 characterization of what further sets there are.\nTheir role, therefore, is to give us insight into the richness and\ndiversity of set theoretic space, not a complete mechanism for proving\nwhich particular sets do or do not exist. Likewise recombination\nvis-\u00e0-vis worlds and logical space. \n2.1.5 A Brief Assessment of Concretism\n\nLewis's theory is particularly commendable for its striking\noriginality and ingenuity and for the simple and straightforward\nanswers AW1 and AE1 that it provides to our two\nquestions QW and QE above. Furthermore, because worlds\nare (plausibly) defined entirely in nonmodal terms, the truth\nconditions provided by Lewis's translation scheme themselves appear to\nbe free of any implicit modality. Hence, unlike many other popular\naccounts of possible worlds (notably, the abstractionist accounts\ndiscussed in the following section), Lewis's promises to provide a\ngenuine analysis of the modal operators. \n\nPerhaps the biggest \u2014 if not the most philosophically\nsophisticated \u2014 challenge to Lewis's theory is \u201cthe\nincredulous stare\u201d, i.e., less colorfully put, the fact that its\nontology is wildly at variance with common sense. Lewis faces this\nobjection head on: His theory of worlds, he acknowledges,\n\u201cdoes disagree, to an extreme extent, with firm common\nsense opinion about what there is\u201d (1986, 133). However, Lewis\nargues that no other theory explains so much so economically. With\nworlds in one's philosophical toolkit, one is able to provide elegant\nexplanations of a wide variety of metaphysical, semantical, and\nintentional phenomena. As high as the intuitive cost is, Lewis (135)\nconcludes, the existence of worlds \u201cought to be accepted as\ntrue. The theoretical benefits are worth it.\u201d \n\nAdditional discussion of, and objections to, concretism can be found\nin the supplemental document\n Further Problems for Concretism.\n \n2.2 Abstractionism\n\n\nA rather different set of intuitions about situations is that they are\nabstract entities of a certain sort: They are states\nor conditions, of varying detail and complexity, that a\nconcrete world could be in \u2014 they are ways that things,\nas a whole, could\n be.[26]\n Thus, returning to our original example, one very simple way things\ncould be is for our philosopher Anne to be in her office. We can now\nimagine, as in our example, further detail being successively added to\nthat description to yield more complex ways things could be: Anne\nworking at her desk in her office; music being in the background; her\nhusband being on the phone in the next room; her neighbor mowing the\nlawn next door; and so on. Roughly speaking, then, a possible world\nfor an abstractionist is the limit of such a\n\u201cprocess\u201d of consistently extending and adding detail to\nsome initial state of the world; it is a total way things\ncould be, a consistent state of the world that settles every\npossibility; a consistent state to which no further detail could be\nadded without rendering it inconsistent. \n2.2.1 Abstract Possible Worlds and Existence Therein\n\nTo give the notion of a state, or condition, of the world a little\nmore metaphysical substance, abstractionists typically appeal to more\ntraditional ontological categories. Thus, for example, that things\ncould be in the simple state described above might be spelled out in\none of the following ways: \n\n The proposition that Anne is in her office and at her\ndesk is possibly true. \n The set of propositions {that Anne is in her\noffice, that Anne is at her desk} is such that, possibly,\nall of its members are true. \n The property being such that Anne is in her office\nand at her desk is possibly exemplified (by \u201cthings as a\nwhole\u201d). \n\n\nPossible worlds are then defined as special cases of the type of\nentity in question that are in some relevant sense total.\nAdams (1974), for example, defines possible worlds to be consistent\nsets of propositions that are total in the sense of containing, for\nevery proposition p, either p or its negation; Fine\n(1977), fleshing out ideas of Prior, defines a possible world to be a\nconsistent proposition w that is total in the sense that, for\nevery proposition p, w entails either p or its\nnegation. For purposes here, however, we will sketch the fundamentals\nof the abstractionist view in terms of states of affairs,\nfollowing the basic features of the account developed by Plantinga\n(1974, 1976), an account that, in the literature, frequently serves as\na particularly trenchant abstractionist counterpoint to Lewis's\n concretism.[27]\n\n\nStates of affairs (SOAs) are abstract, intensional entities typically\nsignified by sentential gerundives like \u201cAlgol's being John's\npet\u201d and \u201cThere being more than ten solar planets\u201d.\nImportantly, SOAs constitute a primitive ontological category for the\nabstractionist; they are not defined in terms of possible worlds in\nthe manner that propositions are in\n \u00a71.3.\n Just as some propositions are true and others are not, some SOAs are\nactual and others are\n not.[28]\n Note, then, that to say an SOA is non-actual is not to say\nthat it does not actually exist. It is simply to say that it\nis not, in fact, a condition, or state, that the concrete world is\nactually in. However, because \u2018____ is actual\u2019 is often\nused simply to mean \u2018____ exists\u2019, there is considerable\npotential for confusion here. So, henceforth, to express that an SOA\nis actual we will usually say that it obtains. \n\nAn SOA is said to be possible (necessary,\nimpossible) insofar as it is possible (necessary, impossible)\nthat it obtain. One SOA s is said to include another\nt if, necessarily, s obtains only if t does;\ns precludes t if, necessarily, s obtains\nonly if t doesn't. So, for example, Algol's being John's\npet includes Algol's being someone's pet and precludes\nthere being no pets. Thus, on the abstractionist's\nunderstanding of a situation as a state or condition of the physical\nworld rather than a concrete, structured piece of it, the inclusion of\none situation in another is a purely logical relation, not a\n mereological\n one. Finally, say that an SOA s is total if, for every\nSOA t, s either includes or precludes t.\n(Abstractionists often use \u2018maximal\u2019 instead of\n\u2018total\u2019, but we have already introduced this term in the\ncontext of concretism.) Abstractionist possible worlds are now\ndefinable straightaway: \n\n\nAW2\n\nw is a possible world =def\nw is an SOA that is both\npossible and\n total.[29]\n \n\n\nIt is easy to see that this definition covers the more intuitive\ncharacterizations of abstract possible worlds above: they are\nconsistent \u2014 i.e., possible \u2014 states of the world that\nsettle every possibility, consistent states to which no further detail\ncould be added without rendering them inconsistent. Note also that,\nfor the abstractionist, as for the concretist, the actual world is no\ndifferent in kind from any other possible world; all possible worlds\nexist, and in precisely the same sense as the actual world. The actual\nworld is simply the total possible SOA that, in fact, obtains. And\nnon-actual worlds are simply those total possible SOAs that do not.\n\n\nWhat of existence in such worlds? As we've seen, on Lewis's account,\nto exist in a concrete world w is literally to exist in\nw, that is, within the spatiotemporal boundaries of\nw. Clearly, because SOAs are abstract, individuals cannot exist\nin abstractionist worlds in anything like the same literal,\nmereological sense. Accordingly, the abstractionist defines existence\nin a world simply to be a special case of the inclusion relation: \n\n\nAE2\n\nIndividual a exists in possible world w\n=def w includes\na's existing.  \n\n\nUnlike concretism, then, abstractionism does not entail that\nindividuals are worldbound; there is no inconsistency whatever in the\nidea that many distinct worlds can include the existence of one and\nthe same individual. Indeed, typically, abstractionists are staunchly\ncommitted to transworld identity and hold that most any given\nindividual exists in many possible worlds and, moreover, that\ncontingent individuals, at least, can exemplify very different\nproperties from world to world. Abstractionists, therefore, have no\nneed to appeal to counterparts to understand de re modalities\nand can therefore accept the truth conditions for such modalities\ngiven by basic possible world semantics (spelled out, of course, in\nterms of their definitions AW2 and AE2). In particular,\nthey can take the standard possible world truth condition for, e.g.,\nthe right conjunct of\n (16)\n at face value: \u2018\u25c7(E!a \u2227 \u00acTa)\u2019\nis true on the abstractionist's approach if and only if there is is a\nworld in which Algol herself, rather than some counterpart of hers,\nexists but fails to be anyone's pet. \n2.2.2 Irreducible Modality and Intensional Entities\n\nIt is important to note that the possible worlds of abstractionism do\nnot yield a reductive analysis of modality. The reason for this is\nclear: abstract possible worlds are defined in irreducibly modal terms\n\u2014 a possible world is an SOA that (among other things)\npossibly obtains; or a set of propositions such that it is\npossible that all of its members are true; or a property that\nis possibly exemplified; and so on. Hence, unpacked in terms\nof the abstractionist's definitions, the possible world truth\nconditions for modal propositions are themselves irreducibly modal.\nFor example, when we unpack Plantinga's definition of a possible world\nin the semantic clause for sentences of the form\n\u2308\u25fb\u03c8\u2309 in order to derive\nthe truth condition for\n (17),\n \u2018\u25a1\u2200x(Gx \u2192 Mx)\u2019, we\nend up with this: \n\n\n\n\n\n For all SOAs w, if (i) possibly, w obtains\nand (ii) for all SOAs s, either (a) necessarily,\nw obtains only if s does or (b) necessarily,\nw obtains only if s doesn't, then,\n\u2018\u2200x(Gx \u2192 Mx)\u2019 is true at\nw.  \n\n\nIf we now unpack the modal operators in (22) using the corresponding\ntruth conditional clauses of standard possible world semantics, the\nresult will contain further world quantifiers. And spelling out those\nworld quantifiers in turn using Plantinga\u2019s definition will\nre-introduce those same modal operators yet again.\n\nMore generally, and a bit more exactly, put: As noted above, the\nlogical framework of basic possible world semantics is classical\npredicate logic. The logical framework of abstractionism is modal\npredicate logic. Hence, if possible world semantics is supplemented\nwith abstractionist definitions of possible worlds, then the logical\nframework of possible world semantics becomes modal predicate logic as\nwell and, as a consequence, the extensionality of the semantics is\nlost once again. (This point is expressed somewhat more formally in\nthe supplemental document\n The Intensionality of Abstractionist Possible World Semantics.)\n Since, as noted above, the central motivation for possible world\nsemantics was to deliver an extensional semantics for modal languages,\nany motivation for abstractionism as a semantic theory is arguably\n undermined.[30]\n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear that this observation constitutes an\nobjection to abstractionism. For abstractionists can argue that the\ngoal of their analysis is the converse of the reductionist's goal: The\nreductionist wants to understand modality in terms of worlds; the\nabstractionist, by contrast, wants to understand worlds in terms of\nmodality. That is, abstractionists can argue that we begin with a\nprimitive notion of modality and, typically upon a certain amount of\nphilosophical reflection, we subsequently discover an intimate\nconnection to the notion of a possible world, as revealed in the\nprinciples\n Nec\n and\n Poss.\n The analysis that abstractionists provide is designed to make this\nconnection explicit, ideally, in such a way that Nec and\nPoss fall out as theorems of their theory (see, e.g., Plantinga\n1985 and Menzel and Zalta 2014). \n\nHand in glove with the irreducible nature of modality is the nature of\nintensional entities. Concretists define intensional entities in terms\nof worlds, as described in\n \u00a72.1.3.\n Abstractionists, by contrast, define worlds in terms of intensional\nentities. This divergence in their choice of ontological primitives\nreflects, not only their differing stances toward modality, but also\nan important methodological difference with regard to metaphysical\ninquiry. The concretist is far more pragmatic; notions of\nproperty, relation, proposition, and the\nlike play certain roles in our theorizing and are subject to a\n\u201cjumble of conflicting desiderata\u201d (Lewis 1986,\n54). Within a given theory, any entities that can play those roles\nfruitfully for the purposes at hand are justifiably identified with\nthose notions \u2014 regardless of how well they comport with\npre-theoretic intuitions. Thus, Lewis finds it to be a strength of his\nposition that he is able to adopt the set theoretic definitions in\n\u00a72.1.3. By contrast, at least some abstractionists \u2014\nPlantinga (1987) perhaps most notably \u2014 believe that we have\nintuitive, pre-theoretic knowledge of intensional entities that\nprecludes their being identified with set theoretic constructions of\nany\n sort.[31]\n (See Stalnaker 1976 for a particularly illuminating discussion of the\ncontrast between concretism and abstractionism with respect to the\ntreatment intensional entities.) \n2.2.3 Actuality and Actualism\n\nAs was noted in\n \u00a72.1.2,\n for the concretist, there is no special property of the actual world\n\u2014 actuality \u2014 that distinguishes it, in any\nabsolute sense, from all of the others; it is simply the world that\nwe inhabit. For abstractionists, however, actuality\nis a special property that distinguishes exactly one possible\nworld from all others \u2014 the actual world is the only world that\nhappens to obtain; it is the one and only way things could be\nthat is the way things as a whole, in fact, are. However, for\nmost abstractionists, the distinctiveness of the actual world does not\nlie simply in its actuality but in its ontological comprehensiveness:\nthe actual world encompasses all that there is. In a word: most\nabstractionists are actualists. \n\nActualism\n is the thesis that everything that there is, everything that has\nbeing in any sense, is actual. In terms of possible worlds:\nEverything that exists in any world exists in the actual\n world.[32]\n Possibilism, by contrast, is the denial of actualism; it is the\nthesis that there are mere possibilia, i.e., things that are\nnot actual, things that exist in other possible worlds but fail to\nexist in the actual world. Concretists are obviously not actualists\n(on their understanding of \u2018actual\u2019, at any\n rate).[33]\n Indeed, for the concretist, since individuals are worldbound,\neverything that exists in any nonactual possible world is distinct\nfrom everything in the actual world. However, although possibilism and\nabstractionism are entirely compatible \u2014 Zalta (1983), for\nexample, embraces both positions \u2014 abstractionists tend\nto be actualists. The reason for this is clear: Basic possible world\nsemantics appears to be committed to possibilism and abstractionism\npromises a way of avoiding that commitment. \n\nThe specter of possibilism first arises with regard to\nnon-actual possible worlds, which would seem by definition to\nbe prime examples of mere possibilia. However, we have just\nseen that the abstractionist can avoid this apparent commitment to\npossibilism by defining possible worlds to be SOAs of a certain sort.\nSo defined, non-actual worlds, i.e., worlds that fail to obtain, can\nstill actually exist. Hence, the commitment of basic possible world\nsemantics to non-actual worlds does not in itself threaten the\nactualist's ontological scruples. \n\n\nHowever, the specter of possibilism is not so easily exorcised. For\nnon-actual worlds are not the only, or even the most compelling,\nexamples of mere possibilia that seem to emerge out of basic\npossible world semantics. For instance, it is quite reasonable to\nthink that evolution could have taken a very different course (or, if\nyou like, that God could have made very different creative choices)\nand that there could have been individuals \u2014 call them\nExotics \u2014 that are biologically very different from all\nactually existing individuals; so different, in fact, that no actually\nexisting thing could possibly have been an Exotic. According to basic\npossible world semantics, the sentence \u2018There could have been\nExotics\u2019 or, more formally, \n\n\n\n\n\n \u25c7\u2203xEx  \n\n\nis true just in case there is a world in which\n\u2018\u2203xEx\u2019 is true, i.e., when all is said and\ndone, just in case: \n\n\n\n\n\n There is a possible world w and an individual a\nin w such that a is an Exotic in w,  \n\n\nwhich, a bit less formally, is simply to say that \n\n\n\n\n Some individual is an Exotic in some possible world. \n\n\n\nHowever, since no actually existing thing could have been an Exotic,\nanything that is an Exotic in some possible world cannot be among the\nthings that exist in the actual world. Thus, the truth conditions that\nbasic possible world semantics assigns to some of our intuitive modal\nbeliefs appear to entail that there are non-actual individuals as well\nas non-actual possible worlds. Defining possible worlds as SOAs\nprovided a way for the actualist to embrace non-actual worlds without\ncompromising her actualism. But how is the actualist to understand the\napparent commitment to non-actual individuals in such truth\nconditions as (25)? \n\nAnswers that have been given to this question represent a rather deep\ndivide between actualist abstractionists. On the one hand,\n\u201ctrace\u201d actualists introduce actually existing entities\ninto their ontologies that can play the role of mere possibilia\nin (25) and its like. Trace actualists come in two varieties:\nnew actualists and haecceitists. New actualists like\nLinsky and Zalta (1996) and Williamson (1998, 2000, 2013) argue that,\nin fact, all individuals are actually existing, necessary beings but\nnot all of them are necessarily concrete. Some concrete\nindividuals \u2014 those traditionally (mis-)categorized\nas contingent beings \u2014 are\nonly contingently concrete. Likewise, some non-concrete individuals\n\u2014 those, like possible Exotics, traditionally (mis-)categorized\nas contingently non-actual mere\npossibilia \u2014 are only contingently\n non-concrete.[34]\n\n\nThis novel take on modal metaphysics allows the new actualist to\nreinterpret possible world semantics so as to avoid possibilism.\nNotably, the domain d(w) of a world w is\nunderstood not as the set of things that exist in w \u2014 for\nall individuals exist in all worlds \u2014 but the set of things that\nare concrete in\n w.[35]\n Hence, for the new actualist, the correct truth condition for\n (23)\n is: \n\n\n\n\n\n There is a possible world w and an individual a\nthat is (i) concrete in w and (ii) an Exotic in w. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, haecceitists like Plantinga introduce special\nproperties \u2014 haecceities \u2014 to similar ends. The haecceity\nof an individual a is the property of being that very\nindividual, the property being a. A property is a\nhaecceity, then, just in case it is possible that it is the\nhaecceity of some\n individual.[36]\n It is a necessary truth that everything has a haecceity. More\nimportantly, for haecceitists, haecceities are necessary beings. Thus,\nnot only is it the case that, had any particular individual a\nfailed to exist, its haecceity ha would still have\nexisted, it is also the case that, for any \u201cmerely\npossible\u201d individual a, there is an actually existing\nhaecceity that would have been a's haecceity had a\nexisted. More generally (and more carefully) put: Necessarily, for any\nindividual a, (i) a has a haecceity h and (ii)\nnecessarily, h exists. \n\nLike the new actualists, then, the metaphysics of the haecceitists\nenables them to systematically reinterpret possible world semantics in\nsuch a way that the truth conditions of modal discourse are expressed\nsolely in term of actually existing entities of some sort rather than\nactual and non-actual individuals. More specifically, for the\nhaecceitist, the domain d(w) of a world w is\ntaken to be the set of haecceities that are exemplified in\nw, that is, the set of haecceities h such that w\nincludes h's being exemplified. Likewise, the\nw-extension of a (1-place) predicate \u03c0 is taken to be a\nset of haecceities \u2014 intuitively, those haecceities\nthat are coexemplified in w with the property expressed by\n\u03c0. So reinterpreted, the truth condition for\n (23)\n is: \n\n\n\n\n\n There is a possible world w and a haecceity h\nthat is (i) exemplified in w and (ii) coexemplified with the\nproperty being an Exotic in w.  \n\n\nBy contrast, \u201cno-trace\u201d, or strict, actualists\nlike Prior (1957), Adams (1981), and Fitch (1996) hew closely to the\nintuition that, had a contingent individual a failed to exist,\nthere would have been absolutely no trace, no metaphysical vestige, of\na \u2014 neither a itself in some non-concrete state\nnor any abstract proxy for a. Hence, unlike trace actualism,\nthere are no such vestiges in the actual world of objects that are not\nactual but only could have been. The logical consequences for no-trace\nactualists, however, appear to be severe; at the least they cannot\nprovide a standard\n compositional\n semantics for modal languages, according to which (roughly) the\nmeaning of a sentence is determined by its logical form and the\nmeanings of its semantically significant constituents. In particular,\nif there is nothing to play the role of a \u201cpossible\nExotic\u201d, nothing that is, or represents, an Exotic in some other\npossible world \u2014 a mere possibile, a contingently\nnon-concrete individual, an unexemplified haecceity \u2014 then the\nstrict actualist cannot provide standard, compositional truth\nconditions for quantified propositions like\n (23)\n that yield the intuitively correct truth value. For, understood\ncompositionally,\n (23)\n is true if and only if \u2018\u2203xEx\u2019 is true at\nsome world w. And that, in turn, is true at w if and\nonly if \u2018Ex\u2019 is true at w for some value of\n\u2018x\u2019. But, as just noted, for the strict actualist,\nthere is no such value of \u2018x\u2019. Hence, for the\nstrict actualist, \u2018Ex\u2019 is false at w for all\nvalues of \u2018x\u2019 and, hence,\n (23)\n is false as well. (These issues are explored in much greater detail\nin the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate.)\n \n2.2.4 A Brief Assessment of Abstractionism\n\nLike concretism, abstractionism provides a reasonably clear and\nintuitive account of what worlds are and what it is to exist in them,\nalbeit from a decidedly different perspective. Although, as noted in\n \u00a72.2.2,\n the fact that modality is a primitive in abstractionist definitions\nof possible worlds arguably compromises its ability to provide\nsemantically illuminating truth conditions for the modal operators,\nthose definitions can be taken to illuminate the connection between\nour basic modality concepts and the evocative notion of a possible\nworld that serves as such a powerful conceptual tool for constructing\nphilosophical arguments and for analyzing and developing solutions to\nphilosophical problems. In this regard, particularly noteworthy are:\nPlantinga's (1974) influential work on\n the ontological argument\n and the free will defense against\n the problem of evil;\n Adams' (1974, 1981) work on\n actualism\n and actuality; and Stalnaker's (1968, 1987) work on\n counterfactual conditionals\n and\n mental content.\n \n\nA number of important objections have been voiced in regard to\nabstractionism. Some of these are addressed in the document\n Problems with Abstractionism.\n \n2.3 Combinatorialism\n\nAs its name might suggest, our third approach \u2014\ncombinatorialism \u2014 takes possible worlds to be\nrecombinations, or rearrangements, of certain metaphysical simples.\nBoth the nature of simples and the nature of recombination vary from\ntheory to theory. Quine (1968) and Cresswell (1972), for example,\nsuggest taking simples to be space-time points (modeled, perhaps, as\ntriples of real numbers) and worlds themselves to be arbitrary sets of\nsuch points, each set thought of intuitively as a way that matter\ncould be distributed throughout space-time. (A world w, so\nconstrued, then, is actual just in case a space-time point\np is a member of w if and only if p is occupied\nby matter.) Alternatively, some philosophers define states a world\ncould be in, and possible worlds themselves, simply to be maximally\nconsistent sets of\n sentences[37]\n in an expressively rich language \u2014\n\u201crecombinations\u201d, certainly, of the sentences of the\nlanguage. (Lewis refers to this view as linguistic\n ersatzism.[38])\n However, the predominant version of combinatorialism finds its\norigins in Russell's (1918/1919) theory of\n logical atomism\n and Wittgenstein's (1921, 1922, 1974) short but enormously\ninfluential\n Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.\n A suggestive paper by Skyrms (1981) spelling out some of the ideas in\nthe Tractatus, in turn, inspired a rich and sophisticated\naccount that is developed and defended in great detail in an important\nseries of books and articles by D. M. Armstrong (1978a, 1978b, 1986a,\n1989, 1997, 2004b, 2004c). In this section, we present a somewhat\nsimplified version of combinatorialism that draws primarily upon\nArmstrong's work. Unless otherwise noted, this is what we shall mean\nby \u2018combinatorialism\u2019 for the remainder. \n2.3.1 The Basic Ontology of Combinatorialism\n\nWittgenstein famously asserted that the world is the totality of\nfacts, not of things (ibid., \u00a71.1). The\ncombinatorialist spells out Wittgenstein's aphorism explicitly in\nterms of an ontology of objects (a.k.a., particulars), universals\n(a.k.a., properties and relations), and facts. Facts are either atomic\nor molecular. Every atomic fact \u2014 Sachverhalt, in the\nlanguage of the Tractatus \u2014 is \u201cconstituted\u201d\nby an n-place relation (= property, for n=1) and\nn objects that stand in, or exemplify, that\nrelation. Thus, for example, suppose that John is 1.8 meters tall.\nThen, in addition to John and the property being 1.8 meters\ntall, there is for the combinatorialist the atomic fact of John's\nexemplifying that property. More generally, atomic facts exist\naccording to the following principle: \n\n\n\nAF\n\n Objects a1, ..., an\nexemplify n-place relation R iff there is the fact\na1, ..., an's exemplifying R\n([R,a1,...,an], for\nshort).  \n\n\nSay that the ai are the constituent\nobjects of the fact in question and R its constituent\nuniversal, and that R and the ai\nall exist in\n[R,a1,...,an]. \n\nA fact is monadic if its constituent universal is a property.\nA molecular fact f is a conjunction of atomic facts.\nIts constituent objects and universals are exactly those of its\nconjuncts and an entity exists in f just in case it exists in\none of its conjuncts. (For simplicity, we stipulate that an atomic\nfact has (only) itself as a conjunct and, hence, is\n\u201ctrivially\u201d molecular.) One fact f includes\nanother g if every conjunct of g is a conjunct of\nf. (Note, importantly, that inclusion, so defined, is quite\ndifferent from the homonymous notion defined in the discussion of\nabstractionism above \u2014 most notably, combinatorial inclusion is\nnot a modal notion.) For purposes below, say that an object\na is a bare particular in a molecular fact f if\nthere is no monadic conjunct of f of which a is the\nconstituent object, no conjunct of the form a exemplifies F,\nfor some property F. a is a bare particular if\nit is bare in every molecular fact. Intuitively, of course, a bare\nparticular is an unpropertied object. \n\nThere is no upper bound on the \u201csize\u201d of a molecular fact\nand no restriction on which atomic facts can form a conjunction; for\nany atomic facts at all, there is a molecular fact whose conjuncts are\nexactly those facts. As a first cut, then, we can spell out\nWittgenstein's characterization of the (actual) world as the totality\nof facts by defining the world to be the largest molecular fact, the\nmolecular fact that includes all of the atomic\n facts.[39]\n\n\nAlthough objects and universals are typically included along with\nfacts in the basic ontology of combinatorialism, facts are typically\nconsidered more fundamental. Indeed, taking his queue from the\nTractarian thesis that the world consists of facts, not things,\nArmstrong (1986a, 577) argues that facts alone are ontologically basic\nand that objects and universals are simply \u201caspects of,\nabstractions from\u201d facts. Accordingly, he calls the object\nconstituent of a fact of the form [P,a] a\n\u201cthin\u201d particular, an object \u201cconsidered in\nabstraction from all its [intrinsic] properties\u201d (1993, 433);\nand where N is the conjunction of \u201call the non-relational\nproperties of that particular (which would presumably include\nP), the atomic fact a's exemplifying N itself is the\ncorresponding \u201cthick\u201d particular \u201d (ibid.,\n434 \u2014 we will occasionally use italics to distinguish a thin\nparticular a from the corresponding thick particular a).\nThough not all combinatorialists of every stripe buy into Armstrong's\n\u201cfactualist\u201d metaphysics (Bricker 2006), they do generally\nagree that facts are more fundamental, at least to the extent that\nboth the notion of a bare particular, i.e., an object exemplifying no\nproperties, and that of an unexemplified property are considered\nincoherent; insofar as they exist at all, the existence of both\nparticulars and universals depends on their \u201coccurring\u201d in\nsome fact or other. Whatever their exact ontological status, it is an\nimportant combinatorialist thesis that exactly what objects\nand universals exist is ultimately a matter for natural science, not\nmetaphysics, to decide. \n\nObjects can be either simple or complex. An object is simple if\nit has no proper parts, and complex otherwise. Like objects,\nuniversals too divide into simple and complex. A universal is simple\nif it has no other universal as a constituent, and complex otherwise.\nComplex universals accordingly come in two varieties: conjunctive\n\u2014 the constituents of which are simply its conjuncts \u2014 and\nstructural. A structural universal U is one that is exemplified\nby a complex object O, and its constituents are universals\n(distinct from U) exemplified by simple parts of O that\nare relevant to O's being an instance of\n U.[40]\n It is important to note that, for Armstrong, the constituency\nrelation is not the mereological parthood relation. Rather, complex\nuniversals (hence also complex facts of which they are constituents)\nenjoy a \u201cnon-mereological mode of composition\u201d (1997,\n119\u2013123) that, in particular, allows for a richer conception of\ntheir\n structure.[41]\n (An assumption of our simplified account here will be that both the\nproper part of relation and the constituency relation are\nwell-founded. It follows that (i) there is no\n gunk,\n i.e., that every complex object is composed, ultimately, entirely of\nsimples and (ii) complex universals \u2014 hence the complex facts in\nwhich they are exemplified \u2014 are ultimately\n\u201cgrounded\u201d in simple facts, i.e., that they cannot be\ninfinitely decomposed into further complex\n universals/facts.[42])\n \n\nTo illustrate the basic idea: in Figure 1, the left-hand diagram\ndepicts a water molecule W comprising an oxygen atom o\nand two hydrogen atoms h1 and h2.\nFor the combinatorialist, \u201cthick\u201d particulars like the\nmolecule itself as well as its constituent atoms are themselves facts:\no is the fact [O,o] in which the universal\noxygen (O) is exemplified by a thin particular\n o;[43]\n likewise h1 and h2. W in\nturn comprises those monadic facts and the relational facts\n[B,o,h1],\n[B,o,h2] wherein the covalent bonding\nrelation B holds between the oxygen atom and the two hydrogen\natoms. The structural universal Water itself, then, shares this\nstructure \u2014 it is, so to say, an isomorph consisting of\nthe monadic universals O and H and the binary relation\nB, structured as indicated in the right-hand diagram of Figure\n 1.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A Water Molecule W and the Structural Universal\nWater  \n\n2.3.2 States of Affairs and Recombination\n\nIt should be clear from\n principle AF\n that all atomic facts hold; that is, all of them reflect\nactual exemplification relations. Obviously, however, possibility\nencompasses more than what is actual, that is, there are\npossible facts as well as actual facts; the world's\nuniversals might have been exemplified by its objects very\ndifferently. If they had \u2014 if the world's objects and universals\nhad combined in a very different way \u2014 there would have been a\nvery different set of atomic facts and, hence, a very different world.\n\n\nTo spell out the idea of a possible fact, the combinatorialist\nintroduces the more general notion of an atomic (combinatorial)\nstate of affairs, that is, an entity that simply has the\nform of an atomic fact \u2014 n objects exemplifying\nan n-place relation \u2014 but without any requirement that\nthe exemplification relation in question actually holds between them.\nMore exactly: \n\n\nAS\n\n For any objects a1, ...,\nan and any n-place relation R,\nthere is an atomic (combinatorial) state of affairs\na1, ..., an's exemplifying\nR (again,\n[R,a1,...,an], for\nshort).  \n\n\nThus, even if the two hydrogen atoms h1 and\nh2 in a water molecule do not in fact stand in the\ncovalent bonding relation B, there is nonetheless the\n(non-factual) state of affairs\n[B,h1,h2]. \n\nCombinatorialism takes facts to be literal, structured parts of the\nphysical world. This suggests that a non-factual state of affairs\n\u2014 a merely possible fact \u2014 must be part of a\nmerely possible physical world. This idea is at odds with the strong,\nscientifically-grounded form of actualism that typically motivates\ncombinatorialism. Two options are available: The combinatorialist can\nfollow the (actualist) abstractionists and define states of affairs to\nbe philosophical or mathematical constructs consisting only of actual\nobjects, properties, relations, and facts. For example, the state of\naffairs\n[R,a1,...,an] can\nsimply be identified with the ordered n-tuple\n\u27e8R,a1,...,an\u27e9.\nSo long as the combinatorialist is willing to adopt the additional\nmetaphysical or set theoretic machinery, this sort of approach offers\na way of introducing non-factual states of affairs that does not\ninvolve any untoward ontological commitments to merely possible\nentities. Alternatively, following Armstrong (1989, 46\u201351; 1997,\n172\u20134), the combinatorialist can refuse to grant non-factual\nstates of affairs any genuine ontological status and adopt a form of\n  modal fictionalism\n that nonetheless permits one to speak as if such states of\naffairs exist. The exposition to follow will remain largely neutral\nbetween these options. \n\nConstituency for states of affairs is understood as for facts.\nAdditionally, analogous to molecular facts, there are molecular states\nof affairs \u2014 conjunctions of atomic states of affairs. Inclusion\nbetween states of affairs is understood exactly as it is between facts\nand being a bare particular in a molecular state of affairs\ns is understood as for facts: a is a bare particular in\ns if there is no monadic conjunct of s of the form\na exemplifies F. The notion of recombination is now\ndefinable straightaway: \n\n\n\n\n\n s is a recombination of a molecular state of\naffairs f =def\ns is a molecular state of affairs whose constituent objects and\nconstituent universals are exactly those of f. s is a\nnon-trivial recombination of f if it does not include\nthe same states of affairs as f.  \n\n\nVery roughly then, a possible world will be a certain sort of\nrecombination of (some portion of) the actual world, the\nmolecular fact that includes all of the atomic facts. This idea will\nbe refined in the following sections. \n2.3.3 Structural States of Affairs and Supervenience\n\nSay that a state of affairs is structural if it is atomic and\nits constituent universal is structural or it is molecular and\nincludes a structural state of affairs; and say that it is\nsimple otherwise. The difference between structural and simple\nuniversals and states of affairs is particularly significant with\nregard to the important concept of supervenience (Armstrong\n1989, Ch\n 8).[45]\n Entity or entities S supervene on entity or entities R\nif and only if the existence of R necessitates that of S\n(ibid., 103). (Necessitation here is, of course, ultimately to\nbe spelled out in terms of combinatorial possible worlds.)\nNon-structural states of affairs supervene directly on their atomic\n conjuncts.[46]\n However, things are not in general quite so straightforward for\nstructural states of affairs. For, although structural states of\naffairs are ultimately constituted entirely by simple states of\naffairs, unlike non-structural states of affairs, structural states of\naffairs typically supervene on more than the totality of their\nconstituents. For, in many cases, whether or not a structural fact\nexists depends not only on the existence of its constituent facts but\nalso on the absence of certain others (Armstrong 1997, 34ff).\nFor example, as noted in our example above, our water molecule\nW comprises two further facts in which two hydrogen atoms\nh1 and h2 both stand in the\ncovalent binding relation with an oxygen atom o. However, if\no were to bind with a further hydrogen atom\nh3, then, despite the fact that the constituent\nfacts of W would still hold, W would not be water; there\nwould be no such fact as W's being\n water.[47]\n Rather, W would exist only as a complex part of a hydronium\nion; the new binding [B,o,h3] would,\nso to say, \u201cspoil\u201d the instantiation of Water.\nThus, more generally, whether or not a structural state of affairs\nS exists in a possible world typically requires something over\nand above its constituent states of affairs being \u201cwelded\ntogether\u201d in the right sort of way (Armstrong, 1997, 36); it\nrequires also that there be no relevant \u201cspoilers\u201d for\n S.[48]\n Armstrong draws directly on the initial passages of the\n Tractatus[49]\n for the necessary apparatus: a structural state of affairs S\nin any possible world w, supervenes, not simply on its\nconstituent atomic states of affairs but on a certain\nhigher-order state of affairs Tw,\nnamely, the state of affairs that the (first-order) atomic states of\naffairs of w are all the (first-order) atomic states of\naffairs and, hence, that w includes no spoilers for\nS. Armstrong (ibid., 35, 134\u20135, 196\u2013201)\ncalls Tw the totality state of affairs for\nthe atomic states of affairs of\n w.[50]\n\n2.3.4 Combinatorial Possible Worlds and Existence Therein\n\nThe idea of possibility being rooted in arbitrary recombinations of\nthe actual world, rearrangements of its objects and universals, is\nintuitively appealing. Clearly, however, not just any such\nrecombination can count as a possible world. Some states of affairs\nare intuitively impossible \u2014 [being an elephant,\ne], where e is an individual electron, say \u2014 and\nsome pairs of states of affairs, while individually possible, are not\ncompossible \u2014 the states of affairs [having 1kg\nmass, a] and [having 2kg mass, a] for a given\nobject a, or, for a given mereological sum m of simples,\nthe states of affairs [being a baboon, m] and [being\na hoolock, m]. But nothing that has been said rules out the\nexistence of recombinations of the actual world \u2014 rearrangements\nof its objects and universals \u2014 that include such states of\naffairs. Obviously, however, such recombinations cannot be thought to\nrepresent genuinely possible worlds. Of course, like the\nabstractionist, the combinatorialist could simply stipulate as part of\nthe definition that all legitimate recombinations must be genuinely\npossible states of affairs of a certain sort, genuinely\npossible recombinations. But this will not do. For, like\nconcretism, combinatorialism purports to be a reductive\naccount of modality, an account of possible worlds that does not\ndepend ultimately on modal notions (see Armstrong 1989,\n 33).[51]\n\n\nHere the distinction between simple and structural states of affairs\ntogether with the combinatorialist's strong notion of supervenience\ncome to the fore. For, given that structural facts supervene on simple\nfacts and the actual totality fact T@, the actual\nworld can be defined more parsimoniously as the molecular fact that\nincludes all the simple atomic facts and the totality fact\nT@. And at the level of simples, there are no\nlimitations whatever on recombination (Wittgenstein 1921,\n2.062-2.063); hence, any recombination of simple objects and\nuniversals is by definition considered possible. Thus Armstrong\n(1986a, 579): \n\n\nThe simple individuals, properties, and relations may be combined in\nall ways to yield possible [simple] atomic states of affairs,\nprovided only that the form of atomic facts is respected. That is the\ncombinatorial idea.\n\n\nWorlds, in particular, can be defined as special cases of such\nrecombinations, together with appropriate totality facts. To state\nthis, we need a condition that ensures the existence of a unique\nactual world: \n\n\n\n\n\n States of affairs s and t are identical iff they\ninclude exactly the same states of affairs.  \n\n\nGiven this, we have: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe (combinatorial) actual world =def\nthe fact @ that includes exactly all\nthe simple atomic facts and the totality state of affairs\nT@ for the conjunction of those facts.  \n\n\n\nAW3\n\nw is a (combinatorial) possible world =def\nw is a recombination of the\nsimple atomic facts of the actual world conjoined with the totality\nfact Tw for that\n recombination.[52]\n \n\n\nArmstrong's ontological commitments are notoriously rather slippery\nbut, given AW3, a reasonably complete notion of existence in a\nworld is forthcoming. First, let us note that, for Armstrong, the\n\u201ccombinatorial idea\u201d yields a substantial metaphysical\nthesis, as well, viz., the ontological free lunch (1986,\n12ff), i.e., the thesis that \u201c[w]hat supervenes is no addition\nof being\u201d; that \u201cwhatever supervenes ... is not something\nontologically additional to the subvenient entity or entities.\u201d\nHence, for Armstrong, it appears that simple states of\naffairs and their constituents exist most fundamentally and that the\nexistence of more complex entities is in a certain sense\nderivative. Thus: \n\n\n\n\n\n Entity a exists fundamentally in\n(combinatorial) possible world w =def\n(i) a is a simple state of\naffairs that w includes or (ii) a is a constituent or\nconjunct of an entity that exists fundamentally in w. \n\n\n\nGiven this, existence in a world generally \u2014 both fundamental\nand derivative \u2014 both for simples and\n (first-order[53])\n non-simples alike, is definable as follows: \n\n\nAE3\n\nEntity a exists in (combinatorial) possible world\nw =def either (i)\na exists fundamentally in w or (ii) a supervenes\non entities that exist in w.  \n\n\nSemantics receives rather short shrift in Armstrong's version of\ncombinatorialism \u2014 at least, semantics in the model theoretic\nsense of\n \u00a71.2\n \u2014 but, as it has played an important role in our discussion of\nconcretism and abstractionism, we note briefly how the ontology of\ncombinatorialism might be taken to populate a possible world\ninterpretation of the language of modal predicate logic. Specifically,\nwe can take the range of the modal operators \u2014 understood,\nsemantically, as quantifiers \u2014 to be all of the combinatorial\npossible worlds in the sense of AW3. The domain\nd(w) of each world w is the set of all simple and\ncomplex objects that exist in w according to AE3 and the\nw-extension I\u03c0(w) of a predicate\n\u03c0 expressing a simple or complex universal R is the set of\nall n-tuples, \u27e8a1, ...,\nan\u27e9 such that the atomic fact\n[R,a1,...,an] exists\nin w. \n2.3.5 Analytic and Emergent Modalities; Essential Properties\n\nThere are, then, for the combinatorialist no intrinsically modal\nphenomena; there are just all of the various worlds that exist on\nunrestricted combinatorial grounds alone. Ultimately, all genuine\npossibilities, simple or not, are just states of affairs that exist in\nthese combinatorial worlds in the sense of AE3. However, it is\nnot immediately as clear how to understand many intuitive\nnecessities/impossibilities involving complex\nstructural universals, for example, the impossibilities noted in the\nprevious section, viz., that something simultaneously have a mass of\nboth 1kg and 2kg or simultaneously be both a baboon and a hoolock.\nLikewise, it is not entirely clear how combinatorialism accounts for\nintuitive facts about essential properties, such as that our water\nmolecule W is essentially water or that Algol is essentially a\ndog. Combinatorialists argue that such modal facts can nevertheless be\nexplained in terms that require no appeal to primitive modal features\nof the world (Armstrong 2004b, 15). \n\nAnalytic Modalities.\u00a0\u00a0Armstrong argues that many\nintuitive modal facts \u2014 notably, the impossibility of an object\nexemplifying more than one determinate of the same determinable\n\u2014 can be understood ultimately as logical, or analytic,\nmodalities that are grounded in meaning rather than any primitive\nmodal features of reality. For example, intuitively it is impossible\nthat an object simultaneously exemplify the structural properties\nhaving 2kg mass and having 1kg mass. The combinatorial\nreason for this (cf. Armstrong 1989, 79) is that, for an object\na to exemplify the former property is simply for there to be a\ndivision of a into two wholly distinct parts, both of which\nexemplify the latter property. Moreover, this division into parts is\nentirely arbitrary, that is, for any part a1\nof a exemplifying having 1kg mass, there is a (unique)\npart a2 of a wholly distinct from\na1 that also exemplifies that property. It follows\nthat, if our 2kg object a itself also exemplifies\nhaving 1kg mass, then, as a is a part of itself, there\nmust be a 1kg part of a that is wholly distinct from a.\nAnd that is analytically false, false \u201csolely by virtue of the\nmeaning we attach to\u201d the word \u2018part\u2019 (ibid.,\n 80).[54]\n\n\n\nEmergent Modalities.\u00a0\u00a0 Combinatorialism purports to\nexplain a further class of intuitive modal facts as features that\nsimply \u201cemerge\u201d from facts about structural\n properties.[55]\n The discussion of structural states of affairs and supervenience\nabove provides an example. Let us suppose the actual world\nw1 includes our water molecule W from Figure\n1 plus a further hydrogen atom h3. In this world,\nonly h1 and h2 bind to o.\nHence, this world includes the state of affairs W's being water\nbut not the state of affairs I's being hydronium in which\no, h1, h2, and\nh3 are so bonded as to constitute a hydronium ion\nI. Conversely, however, given the unrestricted nature of\nrecombination, there is a world w2 that includes\nW structured as it actually is in w1 but\nwhich also includes the spoiler\n[B,o,h3] \u2014 where o and\nh3 bond \u2014 and, hence, the structural state of\naffairs I's being hydronium. Thus, the absence of\n[B,o,h3] in w1\nenables the emergence of W's being water and precludes I's\nbeing hydronium whilst its presence in w2\nenables the emergence of the latter but precludes the former. As a\nconsequence, it is impossible that the states of affairs W's being\nwater and I's being hydronium\n coexist.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: W's being water and (given a bond between o\nand h3) I's being hydronium  \n\n\nAlthough more dramatic, large-scale examples of incompatible states of\naffairs \u2014 such as a thing's being simultaneously both a baboon\nand a hoolock \u2014 might be vastly more complex, there is no\nobvious reason why their impossibility could not have the same sort of\ncombinatorial explanation. \n\nEssential Properties.\u00a0\u00a0 It follows from the\nunrestricted nature of recombination that, for any simple object\na and simple universal P, a recombines with\nP in some worlds and fails to recombine with P in\nothers. Generalizing from this fact, it follows that no simple or sum\nof simples has any simple universal or conjunction of simple\nuniversals essentially. It also follows that no such object has any\nstructural property essentially. For assume o is such an object\nand that it exemplifies a structural property P. Since P\nis structural, it supervenes on some set of simple states of affairs.\nBut by the nature of recombination, there are combinatorial worlds in\nwhich those states of affairs do not exist and, hence, in which\nP doesn't but o \u2014 being a simple or a sum of\nsimples \u2014 does. \n\n\n Thick particulars like our water molecule W don't fare much\nbetter because of the possibility of spoilers. For Armstrong (1997,\n35), W is simply the conjunction of its constituent states of\naffairs. As we've just seen, however, in the presence of spoilers,\nthat conjunction would exist \u2014 hence, W would exist\n\u2014 without being Water. Hence, it would seem that at least\nsome properties that, intuitively, are essential to their bearers turn\nout not to be for the combinatorialist. The problem is compounded by\nthe fact that some intuitively non-essential properties of some thick\nparticulars are arguably essential for the combinatorialist. The shape\nproperties of a thick particular A, for example, would seem to\nbe a function of its constituent states of affairs. Moreover, the\nexemplification of such properties are not obviously subject to\nspoilers the way that natural kind properties like Water are.\nHence, as A is identical to the conjunction of its constituent\nstates of affairs, it would seem that it will have the same shape in\nany world in which it exists, i.e., it will have that shape\nessentially. \n\nThat said, combinatorialism can arguably provide a reasonably robust\nanalysis of intuitions about the essential properties of ordinary\nthick particulars like dogs or persons. Such objects can be taken to\nbe temporal successions of sums of simples and each sum in the\nsuccession as its temporal parts. Sums in the same rough temporal\nneighborhood are composed of roughly the same simples and are\nstructured in roughly the same way. Similarities between such objects\nacross worlds in turn determine counterpart relations. Following\nLewis, the essential properties of such objects can then be identified\nwith those properties exemplified by (all of the temporal parts of)\nall of its counterparts in every world in which it exists (Armstrong\n1997, 99\u2013103,\n 169).[57]\n\n2.3.6 Fewer Things and Other Things: Modified Combinatorialism\n\n\n Since a possible world is a recombination of the actual world and\nevery recombination includes states of affairs involving every simple\nindividual and every simple universal, by AE3, every simple\nentity exists in every world. Hence, there could not have been fewer\nof them; nor could there have been simples other than the ones there\nactually are. In this section, we address this issue and the issue of\ncontingent existence generally in combinatorialism. \n\nFewer things.\u00a0\u00a0Combinatorialism as it stands has no\nproblem accounting for the general intuition that there could have\nbeen fewer things. We have already noted in\n \u00a72.3.3\n and again in\n \u00a72.3.5\n how our water molecule W, as such, might not have existed.\nMore generally, given the unrestricted nature of recombination, for\nany a involving a structural fact S, there are\nrecombinations of the actual world wherein either (a) some of the\nrelations among a's constituents that are critical to\nS's structure fail to be exemplified by those constituents, or\n(b) there are further states of affairs included by those\nrecombinations that act as spoilers for S. Consequently, the\ncombinatorialist seems to have no difficulty explaining how there\nmight have been fewer water molecules, humans, etc. \n\nIntuitively, however, there isn't anything in the idea of a simple\nthat suggests that simples are necessary beings \u2014 especially if,\nas combinatorialists generally agree, simples are physical things of\nsome sort and simple universals are properties of, and relations\namong, those things. For there is nothing in the nature of a simple\nobject to suggest that any given simple had to have existed. Likewise,\nthere is nothing in the nature of a simple universal to suggest it had\nto have been exemplified and, hence, on the combinatorialist's own\nconception of universals, that it had to exist. Otherwise put, as\nsimples exist only insofar as they are constituents of facts, there\nseems no reason why there couldn't have been a very small number of\nfacts, indeed, just a single simple, atomic, monadic fact and, hence,\na lone simple object and a lone simple universal. \n\nIn fact, however, AW3 can be easily modified to accommodate\nthese intuitions without doing any serious violence to\ncombinatorialist intuitions. Specifically, the combinatorialist can\nadmit \u201ccontracted\u201d worlds in which fewer simples exist by\nallowing any recombination of any simple fact \u2014 that\nis, equivalently, by allowing any state of affairs \u2014 to count as\na possible world: \n\n\n\nAW3\u2032\n\nw is a (combinatorial) possible world =def\nw is a recombination of some\nsimple fact f conjoined with the totality state of affairs\nTw for that recombination. \n\n\nAE3 requires no modification, as it was defined with sufficient\ngenerality above. Under AW3\u2032, however, AE3 entails\nthat all entities alike \u2014 objects and universals, simple and\nstructural \u2014 are contingent and, indeed, that every simple\nobject is the sole constituent of some combinatorial possible world.\n\n\nOther things.\u00a0\u00a0Intuitively, not only could there have\nbeen fewer things, there could have been more things or, more\ngenerally, things other than those that actually exist. As\nabove, combinatorialism as it stands seems able to account for many\ninstances of this intuition: Figure 2 illustrates how a non-actual\nhydronium ion I might exist in another world. Likewise, there\nseems no reason to deny, e.g., that there are rearrangements w\nof the actual world's simples wherein exist all of the human beings\nthat actually exist (at, say, 0000GMT 1 January 2013) and more besides\nthat are composed of simples that, in fact, constitute things other\nthan human beings (Armstrong 1997,\n 165).[58]\n Combinatorialism also seems able to account for the possibility of\nconjunctive and structural universals that are simply rearrangements\nof actual simples. It is not implausible to think that such\nrecombinations can give rise to, say, exotic biological kinds that\nhave no actual instances (Armstrong 1989, 55\u201356). Thus, in\nparticular, combinatorialism seems quite able to provide the truth\ncondition\n (24)\n for\n (23)\n and, hence, can account for some possibilities involving\n\u201cmissing\u201d universals that, intuitively, ought to be\npossible. \n\nHowever, it is far from clear that such possibilities exhaust the\nmodal intuition that other things could have existed. Notably,\nintuitively, there could have been different simple\nuniversals distinct from any that actually exist \u2014 different\nfundamental properties of simples, for example. Likewise for simple\nobjects. Either way, there seems to be nothing in the idea of a simple\nobject or simple universal that suggests there couldn't have been\nsimples other than, or in addition to, the simples there are in fact.\nBut AW3\u2032 does not allow for this; the simples of every\npossible world are a subset of the actual simples and there is no\nobvious way of modifying the principle to accommodate the intuition.\nNor is there any obvious way of modifying the principle to accommodate\nthe intuition in\n question.[59]\n\n\nThe combinatorialist could of course abandon actualism and include\nmerely possible simples into her ontology. Again, she could follow the\nnew actualists and draw a division between actually concrete and\nnon-actual, possibly concrete simples; or she could introduce\nPlantinga-style haecceities to go proxy for merely possible simples.\nBut all of these options would be badly out of step with the strong,\nnaturalist motivations for combinatorialism: There is but the one\nphysical world comprising all of the facts; recombinations of (at\nleast some of) those facts \u2014 arbitrary rearrangements of their\nsimple objects and universals \u2014 determine the possible worlds.\nMere possibilia, merely possible non-concretia, and\nnon-qualitative haecceities have no real place in that picture. \n\nThe \u201cpurest\u201d option for the combinatorialist is simply to\nbrazen it out and argue that the actual simples are, in fact, all the\nsimples there could be (Armstrong 1989, 54ff; Driggers 2011,\n56\u201361). A more robust option suggested by Skyrms (1981) makes\nsome headway against the problem by introducing an\n\u201couter\u201d, or \u201csecond-grade\u201d realm of\npossibility, but at the cost of moving beyond the basic intuitions of\ncombinatorialism (Armstrong 1989, 60; 1997, 165\u2013167). Finally,\nSider (2005, 681) suggests that combinatorialists who (like Armstrong)\nare modal fictionalists can deal with the problem of missing entities\nsimply by appealing to yet more fictionalism: As the combinatorialist\nfiction already includes non-actual states of affairs with\nactually existing constituents, there seems no reason not to extend\nthe fiction to include non-actual states of affairs whose constituents\ninclude non-actual particulars and universals. Fictionalism itself,\nhowever, leaves the combinatorialist with the deep problems detailed\nby Kim (1986), Lycan (1993), and Rosen\n (1993).[60]\n\n2.3.7 A Brief Assessment of Combinatorialism\n\nAs with concretism and abstractionism, combinatorialism provides\nreasonably clear definitions of possible worlds and existence in a\nworld and is noteworthy for its attempt to avoid what might be thought\nof as the metaphysical excesses of the two competing views. In\ncontrast to concretism, combinatorialism is staunchly actualist:\ninstead of an infinity of alternative physical universes, each with\nits own unique inhabitants existing as robustly as the inhabitants of\nthe actual world, the worlds of combinatorialism are simply\nrearrangements of the universals and particulars of the actual world;\nand commitment even to them might be avoided if some version of\nfictionalism is tenable. Likewise, in contrast to abstractionism's\nrather rich and unrestrained ontology of SOAs, combinatorialism's\nstates of affairs are comparatively modest. Moreover, in contrast to\nnearly all versions of abstractionism, combinatorialism shares with\nconcretism the virtue of a reductive theory of modality: Modal\nstatements, ultimately, are true or false in virtue of how things\nstand with respect to worlds that are themselves defined in non-modal\nterms. \n\nCombinatorialism's ontological modesty, however, is also a weakness.\nFor, unlike, the two competing approaches, there are modal intuitions\nthat the combinatorialist is not easily able to account for, notably,\nthe intuition that there could have been other things. Additional\ndifficulties are discussed in the supplemental document\n Further Problems for Combinatorialism.\n ",
