    "main_text": "Attributes in the Ethics || Real Distinction\n1.3 Real Distinction\n\nSpinoza makes a very important claim about attributes in the Scholium\nto Proposition 10 of Part One: \u201c\u2026although two attributes\nmay be conceived to be really distinct (i.e., one may be conceived\nwithout the aid of the other), we still cannot infer from that that\nthey constitute two beings, or two different\nsubstances.\u201d Spinoza here is explaining something about the\nrelationship among attributes\u2014one may be conceived without the\naid of the other\u2014and about the relation of the attributes to the\nsubstance, namely, that conceiving attributes independently is not\nevidence of the existence of independent substances.\n\nTo understand why this scholium is so important, it is helpful to\nrecall Descartes\u2019 definition of a \u201creal\ndistinction.\u201d In the Principles of Philosophy,\nDescartes says: \u201cStrictly speaking, a real distinction\nexists only between two or more substances; and we can perceive that\ntwo substances are really distinct simply from the fact that we can\nclearly and distinctly understand one apart from the other\u201d\n(Principles, I, \u00a760, CSM, I, p. 213, AT 28). For\nDescartes, this anchors the strict epistemological and ontological\nseparation between mind and body. One of the things we learn from\ngoing through the Meditations is that we are capable of\nclearly and distinctly perceiving ourselves without a body\u2014the\ncogito in the Second Meditation, and we clearly and\ndistinctly perceive body without thinking in the Fifth\nMeditation. (Of course, in retrospect, we realize that we already\ndid this in a sense with the wax as well). Descartes thus concludes\nthat mind and body are really distinct, that is, one can\nexist without the other.\n\nOne important implication of this distinction is that it allows for a\nfully mechanistic explanation of the physical world. To explain the\ninteraction between two bodies requires alluding only to their\nphysical properties (size, shape and motion) without the need to take\nrecourse to any Aristotelian explanation involving\n final causes.\n Making room for mechanistic explanations, that is, for the New\nScience, was one of Descartes\u2019 chief motivations for writing the\nMeditations. Spinoza preserves this aspect of Cartesian\ndoctrine (cf. appendix to Part One of the Ethics and\ndiscussion below).\n\nHaving separated the mind so sharply from the body, Descartes is left\nwith having to explain their evident unity. More specifically, he is\nburdened with trying to explain how two really distinct substances\nseem to interact causally. Their causal interaction seems problematic\nbecause, according to Descartes, each substance is independent; the\ninfinite substance depends on nothing but itself (Principles,\nI, \u00a751, CSM, I, p. 210, AT 24), while created substances depend\non nothing but God for their existence (Principles,\nI, \u00a752, CSM I, p. 210, AT 25). If distinct substances interact\ncausally then they seem to depend on one another, and this would go\nagainst their nature qua substances. This is why the\nunion of the mind and body is a thorny issue for Descartes,\nand was and continues to be a source of much debate (Cf. for example,\nHoffman, 1986). For some, a version of this problem translates into\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics (cf. Section 1.9.4). The issue of the\nnature of the \u201creal distinction\u201d for Spinoza is discussed\nin the subsequent section.\nNo Cross-Attribute Causation or Conception\n\nFor Descartes, then, there is the epistemological claim that\nperceiving Thought does not involve perceiving Extension and vice\nversa. Each is explanatorily independent from the other, (although not\nfrom God). Spinoza adopts this aspect of Cartesian philosophy and\nholds, as well, that there is what Della Rocca calls, \u201ca\nconceptual barrier\u201d between Thought and Extension as Spinoza\nstates in the scholium \u201ci.e., one may be conceived without the\naid of the other\u201d (Della Rocca, 1996, 9\u201317). Spinoza holds\nThought and Extension to be explanatorily self-contained. Physical\nchanges are to be understood in terms of other physical items, and\nideas are to be understood in terms of other ideas. What is ruled out\nis what can be called \u201ccross attribute explanations.\u201d For\nexample, explaining the movement of my hand by my desire to move my\nhand. According to Spinoza, the movement of my hand is to be explained\npurely physically by alluding to other bodies and their motions, while\nmy desire is to be explained by other desires and ideas. Spinoza makes\nthis very clear in 3P2, its demonstration and scholium:\n\n\n3P2: The body cannot determine the mind to thinking, and the mind\ncannot determine the body to motion, to rest, or to anything else (if\nthere is anything else).\n\nDem.: All modes of thinking have God for a cause, insofar as he is a\nthinking thing, and not insofar as he is explained by another\nattribute (by 2P6). So what determines the mind to thinking is a mode\nof thinking and not of extension, that is (by 2D1), it is not the\nbody. This was the first thing.\n\nNext, the motion and rest of a body must arise from another\nbody\u2026whatever arises in the body must have arisen from God\ninsofar as he is considered to be affected by some mode of extension,\nand not insofar as he is considered to be affected by some mode of\nthinking (also 2P6), that is, it cannot arise from the mind, which (by\n2P11) is a mode of thinking. This was the second point. Therefore, the\nbody cannot determine the mind, and so on, q.e.d.\n\n\nAlthough this is reminiscent of Descartes in some respects, there is,\nof course, one crucial difference. For Descartes the fact that one can\nconceive Thought distinctly from Extension is evidence for the\nexistence of two substances\u2014mind and body. For Spinoza, this is\nnot the case, and this is the point he is making in this central\nproposition (1P10), namely, that although two attributes may be\nconceived independently\u2014one without the other\u2014this does\nnot imply that there are two substances existing separately.\nFor Spinoza there is only one substance with infinite attributes, and\nalthough each attribute is conceived independently from the other/s\nthey still are, nonetheless, all attributes of one and the same\nsubstance. It is possible then to conceive, think, or completely\nexplain the entire universe, or everything that exists, under each one\nof the attributes. That is, we can give a complete physical\ndescription of everything that exists, or alternatively explain,\ndescribe, or conceive everything as ideas or thought. Being able to\nexplain the entire universe under the attribute of Extension is what\nallows Spinoza to preserve Descartes\u2019 effort of providing room\nfor progress in the New Science (Cf. Appendix to Part One).\n\nSpinoza and Descartes agree about the epistemological separation\nbetween Thought and Extension, but not about the ontological one.\nDescartes calls the distinction between attributes of the same\nsubstance, and between a given attribute and its substance a\n\u201crational distinction,\u201d (Principles, I, \u00a762,\nCSM, I, p. 214, AT 30) and so, insofar as Thought and Extension belong\nto the same substance for Spinoza, they would be, in Descartes\u2019\nterminology, rationally\n distinct.[8]\n Spinoza however, says that they are \u201creally\ndistinct.\u201d How exactly to understand the \u201creality\u201d\nof the distinction among the attributes is a crucial interpretative\nmatter and is discussed in Sections 1.8.1\u20131.8.2.\n",
