    "main_text": "The firm in society || International business\n7.3 International business\n\nMany businesses operate across national boundaries. These are\ntypically called \u201cmultinational\u201d or\n\u201ctransnational\u201d firms (MNCs or TNCs). Operating\ninternationally heightens the salience of a number of the ethical\nissues discussed above, such as CSR, but it also raises new issues,\nsuch as relativism and divestment. Two issues often discussed in\nconnection with international business are not treated in this\nsection. One is wages and working conditions in sweatshops. This\nliterature is briefly discussed in\n section 6.2.\n The second issue is corruption, which is not discussed in this entry,\nfor space reasons. But see the entry on\n corruption.\n\nA number of business ethicists have developed ethical codes for MNCs,\nincluding DeGeorge (1993) and Donaldson (1989). International agencies\nhave also created codes of ethics for business. Perhaps the most\nfamous of these is the United Nations Global Compact, membership in\nwhich requires organizations to adhere to a variety of rules in the\nareas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In his\nimportant work for that body, Ruggie (2004, 2013) developed a\n\u201cprotect, respect, and remedy\u201d framework for MNCs and\nhuman rights, which assigns the state the primary duty to protect\nhuman rights and remedy abuses of them, and firms the duty to respect\nhuman rights (cf. Wettstein 2009). A striking fact about much of this\nresearch is that, while it is focused on international business, and\nsometimes promulgated by international agencies, the conclusions\nreached do not apply specifically to firms doing business across\nnational boundaries. The duty to, e.g., respect human rights applies\nto firms doing business within national boundaries too. It is\nsimply that the international context is the one in which this duty\nseems most important to discharge, and in which firms are some of the\nfew agents who can do so.\n\nThere are issues, however, that arise specifically for firms doing\nbusiness internationally. Every introductory ethics student learns\nthat different cultures have different moral codes. This is typically\nan invitation to think about whether or not morality is relative to\nculture. For the businessperson, it presents a more immediate\nchallenge: How should cultural differences in moral codes be managed?\nIn particular, when operating in a \u201chost\u201d country, should\nthe businessperson adopt host country standards, or should she apply\nher \u201chome\u201d country standards?\n\nDonaldson is a leading voice on this question, in work done\nindependently (1989, 1996) and with Dunfee (1999). Donaldson and\nDunfee argue that there are certain \u201cmoral minima\u201d that\nmust be met in all contexts. These are given to us by\n\u201chypernorms\u201d, or universal moral values and rules, which\nare themselves justified by a \u201cconvergence of religious,\nphilosophical, and cultural\u201d belief systems (1999: 57). Within\nthe boundaries set by hypernorms, Donaldson and Dunfee say, firms have\n\u201cfree space\u201d to select moral standards. They do not have\nthe liberty to select any standards they want; rather, their choices\nmust be guided by the host country\u2019s traditions and its current\nlevel of economic development. Donaldson and Dunfee call their\napproach \u201cintegrative social contracts theory\u201d (ISCT),\nsince they seek to merge norms derived from hypothetical contracts\nwith norms that people have actually agreed to in particular\nsocieties.\n\nISCT has attracted a great deal of attention and many critics. Much of\nthis criticism has focused on hypernorms, the criteria for which are\nalleged to be ad hoc (Scherer 2015), ambiguous (Brenkert\n2009), and incomplete (Mayer & Cava 1995). Dunfee (2006b) collects\nand analyzes a decade worth of critical commentary on ISCT. For a more\nrecent elaboration and defense of the approach, see Scholz, de los\nReyes, and Smith (2019).\n\nA complication for the debate about whether to apply home country\nstandards in host countries is that multinational corporations engage\nin business across national boundaries in different ways. Some MNCs\ndirectly employ workers in multiple countries, while others contract\nwith suppliers. Nike, for example, does not directly employ workers to\nmake shoes. Rather, Nike designs shoes, and hires firms in other\ncountries to make them. Our views about whether an MNC should apply\nhome country standards in a host country may depend on whether the MNC\nis applying them to its own workers or to those of other firms.\n\nThe same goes for responsibility. MNCs, especially in consumer-facing\nindustries, are often held responsible for poor working conditions in\ntheir suppliers\u2019 factories. Nike was subject to sharp criticism\nfor the labor practices of its suppliers in the 1990s (Hartman et al.\n2003). Initially Nike pushed back, saying that those weren\u2019t\ntheir factories, and so wasn\u2019t their problem. Under mounting\npressure, it changed course and promulgated a set of labor standards\nthat it required all of its suppliers to meet, and now spends\nsignificant resources ensuring that they meet them (Hsieh, Toffel,\n& Hull 2019; Wokutch 2001). This is increasingly the approach\nWestern multinationals take. Here again the response to the Rana Plaza\ntragedy is illustrative. What lengths companies should go to ensure\nthe safety of workers in their supply chains is a question meriting\nfurther study (see Young 2011).\n\nA businessperson may find that a host country\u2019s standards are\nnot just different than her home country\u2019s standards, but\nmorally intolerable. She may decide that the right course of action is\nnot to do business in the country at all, and if she is invested in\nthe country, to divest from it. The issue of divestment received\nsubstantial attention in the 1980s as MNCs were deciding whether or\nnot to divest from South Africa under its Apartheid regime. It may\nattract renewed attention in the coming years as firms and other\norganizations contemplate divesting from the fossil fuel industry.\nCommon reasons to divest from a morally problematic society or\nindustry are to avoid complicity in immoral practices, and to put\npressure on the society or industry to change its practices. Critics\nof divestment worry about the effects of divestment on innocent third\nparties (Donaldson 1989) and about the efficacy of divestment in\nforcing social change (Hudson 2005). Some believe that it is better\nfor firms to stay engaged with the society or industry and try to\nbring about change from within\u2014a policy of \u201cconstructive\nengagement\u201d.\n",
