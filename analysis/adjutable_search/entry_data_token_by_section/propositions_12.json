This seems to be a fact that everyone must explain. It\nseems likely that the substitutional differences must be explained in\nterms of shifts in verb meaning. Because substitution does not affect\nthe meaning of \u2018assert\u2019, it must affect the meaning of\n\u2018claim\u2019, and, intuitively, it does. This does leave the\nquestion of how the Objectivization Effect itself is to be\nexplained. But one might hope that a broadly syntactic\nsolution\u2014perhaps like King\u2019s\u2014would be available to\nanyone, regardless of one\u2019s stance on propositions.\n\nIf these problems are problems everyone faces, some heat is taken off\nthe relationalist, and the propositionalist generally.\n\nThat said, the relationalist may have to take account of other\nlinguistic puzzles. She will need to explain why it sounds so\npeculiar, e.g., to talk of \u201cmy believing what you desire, or my\ndreading what the thermometer indicated.\u201d And, even with purely\ncognitive attitude verbs, similar puzzles arise: the mild peculiarity\nof \u201cI doubt/assert what you contemplate/entertain,\u201d for\nexample, will require explanation. (For more on these matters, see\nVendler 1967 and Harman 2003.)\n",
