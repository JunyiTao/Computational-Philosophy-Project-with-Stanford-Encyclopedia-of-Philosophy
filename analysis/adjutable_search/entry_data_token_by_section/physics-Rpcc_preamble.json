    "main_text": "\n\nThe Common Cause Principle was introduced by Hans\nReichenbach, in The Direction of Time, which was published\nposthumously in 1956. Suppose that two events A and B\nare positively correlated: \\(p(A\\cap B)>p(A)p(B)\\). Suppose,\nmoreover, that neither event is a cause of the other. Then,\nReichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle (RCCP) states that A\nand B will have a common cause that renders them conditionally\nindependent. Reichenbach incorporated his RCCP into a new probablistic\ntheory of causation, and used it to describe a (purported)\nmacrostatistical temporal asymmetry in analogy with the second law of\nthermodynamics. The principle is significant because it posits a\nconnection between causal structure and probabilistic correlations,\nthus facilitating causal inference from observed correlations.\nHowever, RCCP has been controversial, and a number of counterexamples\nhave been proposed. RCCP is often seen as an antecedent of the\nCausal Markov Condition, which plays a central role in causal\nmodeling and causal inference. RCCP has also been taken to capture\nassumptions about the behavior of classical systems that appear to be\nviolated in quantum mechanics.\n",
