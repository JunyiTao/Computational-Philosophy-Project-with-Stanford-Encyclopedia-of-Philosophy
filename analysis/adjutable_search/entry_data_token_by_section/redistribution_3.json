    "main_text": "The Baseline Distribution || Synchronic Comparisons\n2.2 Synchronic Comparisons\n\n\nThe baseline distribution can also be specified synchronically, by\ncomparing the prevailing distribution to a distribution that would\nhave held had different circumstances obtained. Since circumstance\ncould have differed in many ways, judging whether redistribution in\nthis sense has occurred will require identifying a more specific\nsubjunctive baseline situation that can serve as the basis for\nthese assessments.\n\n\nWith respect to the question of whether the redistribution of income\noccurred in the U.S. between 1979 and 1987, for example, we might\nspecify the subjunctive baseline scenario in terms of what income\ndistribution would have been like (1) had policy changes, such as tax\ncuts, reduction of commercial regulations, and increases in military\nexpenditure not been implemented; (2) had there been no income tax; (3)\nhad all persons and groups received what they contributed to\nproduction; (4) had all persons received their gross incomes minus what\nis required to cover the costs of the public benefits that they have\nreceived and the value that they have extracted from the commons; or\n(5) what they would have received had their holdings reflected what\nthey were entitled to.\n2.2.1 Unmoralized Subjunctive Baselines\n\n\nLet us first examine the subjunctively defined baselines (1)-(3).\nDetermining whether redistribution occurred relative to each of these\nbaselines can be extremely difficult in practice, since the\ncounterfactuals upon which they depend are quite complex. This is not\nalways adequately recognized. It is sometimes assumed, for example,\nthat baseline (2) is identical to the pattern of gross (pre-tax)\nincomes, so that difference between gross and net income will count as\nredistributed income according to it. But this is mistaken. The\npresence or absence of income tax will itself substantially influence\nmany market outcomes, including the availability of economic\nopportunities to persons with different sets of skills and personal\ncharacteristics, and the gross incomes that can be earned in different\njobs. Had no income tax been in place, altogether different jobs and\neconomic opportunities would most likely have existed, and gross\nincomes would most likely have been very\n different.[8]\n Indeed, it is extremely hard even to venture a guess at what\ndistribution of income would have obtained had there been no income\n tax.[9]\n Identifying the set of holdings that would obtain in the subjunctive\nbaseline scenario invoked by (3) is even more problematic. This is\nbecause there is no obvious way of determining how much some\nindividual has contributed to production. Even examples that involve\none person producing something from a set of raw materials without the\nhelp of others \u2014 it is not obvious how to separate out how much\nof the produced good is due to Crusoe\u2019s contribution and how much to\nthe materials themselves. In cases of interdependent production,\nthings become even more difficult, since there is usually no\nnon-arbitrary way of determining the contributions of different\nfactors of production (for example, labor, capital, raw materials,\nso-called public goods, and so on) that jointly lead to total\noutput. It is sometimes claimed that using a person\u2019s marginal product\nas a proxy for what they have contributed to production can circumvent\nthese problems. But this, too, is mistaken.  First, in conditions\nwhere there are increasing or decreasing returns to scale, not\neveryone will be able to receive what they contribute.  Where there\nare increasing returns to scale, for example, it will be\nimpossible for people to receive what they contribute at the\nmargins since the marginal return is greater than the average. Second,\nwhile assessments of the marginal productivity of different inputs can\nbe useful for deciding how to use additional resources so as to\nmaximize profit, they do not show how much each resource has produced\nas a proportion of the total output.\n\n\nPutting aside the manifest difficulties involved in characterizing the\npattern of holdings that would obtain in these subjunctive baselines,\nwould the fact that redistribution has occurred relative to any of\nthem count for or against them as such? With respect to (1) and (2)\nthe answer is \u2018no.\u2019 The mere fact that some policy change\nleads to a different pattern of holdings than would have obtained had\nit not been implemented provides no reason to reject it.  Similarly,\nthat a pattern of holdings differs from the pattern that would have\nobtained in the absence of any taxation would not in itself seem to\ngive us reason to look upon the pattern of holdings that obtain with\nthe tax positively or negatively. In both of these cases, our\nassessment of the policies should be based upon what we take to be\ntheir other morally relevant features, such as whether the changes\nthey bring about further disadvantage vulnerable groups, lead to\ngreater suffering, infringe people\u2019s justified claims to things,\nand so on. (3), on the other hand, may appear to have basic moral\nsignificance. For although few would insist that all should receive\nexactly what they contributed to production, or that valuable\nsocial goals ought never to be pursued when they require that some\nreceive more or less than what they contributed, many might feel that\nan economic system in which people regularly receive much less than\nwhat they contribute to production would be unjust.\n\n\nBut granting basic moral significance to the set of holdings that\nwould have obtained had all received what they contributed to\nproduction is less plausible than it may initially\nappear.[10]\nFirst, the intuition that people should receive in income something\nclose to what they contribute to production seems crucially to depend\non the overall background fairness of the social system in which\nproduction takes place. If, for example, a society allowed educational\nopportunities for technical training only to members of certain ethnic\ngroups, or if poorly designed education system puts these\nopportunities out of reach for the vast majority of people, then the\nfact that those who received such training might then be able to\ncontribute more to production would not seem to entitle them to\nproportionally higher incomes. Second, the contribution of some person\nto total output will depend not only on the value of their labor, but\nalso on the value of the resources that they own. And the claim that\nowners of resources should receive the marginal contribution of their\nresources to production is especially problematic: The existing\ndistribution of such resources is tainted by its historical\nevolution. And the purported moral right to full control over what one\nowns is rather more tenuous than the moral right fully to control\none\u2019s natural endowments. As Sen (1982, p. 4) has put it,\n\u201cThe moral appeal of giving more \u2014 in (P.T.) Bauer\u2019s\nwords \u2014 to \u2018those who are more productive and contribute\nmore to output\u2019 does not readily translate into giving more to\n\u2018those who own more productive resources which contribute more\nto output\u2019.\u201d\n2.2.2 Moralized Subjunctive Baselines\n\n\nDiscussions of redistribution have often focused on the permissibility\nof levying taxes. And it may therefore be tempting simply to identify\nthe baseline with pretax income. Not all taxes, however, are generally\nconsidered redistributive. Indeed, economists and legal theorists have\ntypically distinguished between \u2018redistributive\u2019\nand \u2018benefit\u2019 taxation. Benefit taxes are\ntypically understood (Biehl 1982, Cappelen 2000) as user charges:\ntaxes that are paid to cover the costs of the use of public and\nprivate goods, services, and enabling social conditions (for example,\nsecurity, the legal system, social cohesion, public health) that are\nsecured by the government or taxing authority.\n\n\nThese taxes are, in effect, user charges. Redistributive taxation is\nalso commonly distinguished from Pigouvian (after the economist Arthur\nPigou), or what might most aptly called \u2018compensation\u2019\ntaxes, which pay for harms that persons cause to the environment or to\nother people through their\n activities.[11]\n Taxes on carbon emissions, maritime dumping, non-renewable resource\nextraction, and even currency transactions, have often been\ncharacterized in this way.  Let us call this understanding\n\u2018redistribution as tax and transfer\u2019.\n\n\nDetermining whether tax-and-transfer has occurred requires\nidentifying (1) the extent of the benefits enjoyed by different people\nwithin a social system (or the costs that they have imposed on others);\n(2) the costs of providing these benefits or averting imposed costs;\nand (3) the contribution of each person to the provision of social\nbenefits and compensation for costs imposed. Redistributive\ntax-and-transfer occurs whenever people have paid taxes that are above\nand beyond what is required to cover the costs of the public benefits\nthat they have received and the costs they have imposed on others.\n\n\nSometimes the baseline that is invoked in claims that redistributive\npolicies are undertaken is the set of holdings that would have obtained\nhad they received that to which they were entitled. Redistribution,\nthen, is understood as the transfer of holdings that infringes property\nrights. In this sense, of course, resources could be\nredistributed from taxpayers to recipients without the\ntaxpayers ever having these resources in their physical possession at\nall. Though people normally get a paycheck for their net income, and\nthus never have access to their gross income, they do, according to\nsome, have a claim to their gross income, and thus the difference\nbetween gross and net income represents the transfer of holdings to\nwhich they were entitled. We can call this interpretation of\nredistribution \u2018rights-infringing transfers\u2019.\nDeterminations of whether rights infringing transfers have occurred\nwill clearly depend upon an account of the nature and scope of property\nrights. This requires specifying (1) who has the right; (2) what the\nright is a right to (the object of the right); and (3) the kinds of\nobligations that others have to the right-holder as a result of the\n right.[12]\n\n\nWould the fact that a practice involves redistribution as tax and\ntransfer or rights\u2019 infringement be of basic moral significance? Most\nseem to agree that it would. Indeed, the debate between Nozick and his\negalitarian critics has generally related to whether a policy\u2019s being\nredistributive in either of these senses provides a decisive\nmoral reason to reject them. Nozick (1974, p.ix) has (along with other\nlibertarians) claimed that it does, objecting, \u201cThe state may\nnot use its coercive apparatus for the purpose of getting some\ncitizens to aid others.\u201d Nozick\u2019s egalitarian critics have\ninsisted that such practices may be a regrettable necessity. Thomas\nScanlon (1981, p. 199), for instance, has argued: \u201cIt may be\ntrue, as Nozick claims, that there is a continuum of interferences\nextending from taxation to forced labor, each foreclosing a few more\noptions than the preceding. But the fact that there is such a\ncontinuum is no reason why we must be indifferent between any two\npoints along it.\u201d And Thomas Nagel (1981, p. 201) adds that\n\u201cthere is a big difference between suddenly expropriating half\nof someone\u2019s savings and attaching monetary conditions in advance to\nactivities, expenditures, and earnings \u2014 the usual form of\ntaxation. The latter is a much less brutal assault upon the\nperson.\u201d\n\n\nBoth sides of this debate err, however, by simply assuming that\nwelfare and other social programs are redistributive in either of\nthese senses. It is often claimed, for example, that welfare and other\nsocial programs are clear examples of tax-and-transfer, because such\nprograms are usually funded by revenues that are raised from those who\nwill seldom, if ever, make use of them. But this assumes an overly\nnarrow understanding of how people can benefit from such programs. In\nparticular, it overlooks the indirect benefits that these\nprograms provide to those who fund them. Programs that provide a\ndecent social minimum, for example, may protect those who fund them\nfrom higher crime rates, or promote higher growth rates, a better\neducated labor force, and other social goods that benefit them in many\nways (Murphy & Nagel 2003, Chapter 4). Suppose, however, that\nthose who pay taxes that support a social minimum can insulate\nthemselves from the risks of crime, or are unaffected by the other\nsocial benefits engendered by these programs. Would this show that the\ntaxes that they pay to support these programs are redistributive?\nPerhaps, but it could also be plausibly claimed that insofar as they\ndo not support such programs, their remaining taxes help to support a\nset of institutional arrangements that harm those that suffer\nfrom significant deprivations. Take, for example a social system that\nfeatures a market economy whose structure tends to produce significant\ninequality and poverty. Under this system, many lack \u2014 through\nno fault of their own \u2014 access to basic educational\nopportunities, health care, and the foodstuffs required for them to\nmeet their minimal nutritional needs. Some would argue that insofar as\nthose who are extremely badly-off are not compensated or efforts are\nnot made to provide them with enhanced opportunities, they are\nharmed by the social system. Those who support the social\nsystem by paying taxes, complying with its rules, and through other\nmeans are thus harming, rather than merely failing to benefit, less\nadvantaged participants. Taxes that ensure that persons can meet their\nbasic human needs may therefore need to be added to the economic\nsystem lest its imposition constitute a harming of the poor (Pogge\n2002). This point has been emphasized in the work of political\ntheorists who have framed demands for distributive justice in terms of\npredistribution (Hacker 2011, O\u2019Neill and Williamson 2012,\nThomas 2017). These theorists call for corrective action to offset\nwhat he regards as the cost of policy shifts that have worked to the\nbenefit of the very wealthy while undermining the position of the\ndisadvantaged, for instance by reducing their organizing rights. In\nthis context, tax and transfer could be seen as compensating for\nregressive changes in the predistribution of rights which would\notherwise harm disadvantaged people.\n \n\n\nTo take an international example, some have supported James Tobin\u2019s (1996) proposal for a tax on\ninternational currency exchanges on the grounds that capital markets\nare currently structured in a way that makes significant shocks and\nfinancial crises more frequent and more painful than they need be,\noften causing grave and lasting harm to poorer and more vulnerable\neconomies. A tax on these transactions is not, according to this view,\nredistributive, since its purpose is to correct for and minimize harms\nthat these markets can engender if left unregulated. Along these\nlines, a Tobin-inspired proposal is the \u2018Robin Hood Tax\u2019\non risky financial transactions, which is gaining momentum in the UK\nand other countries (see the link to Robin Hood Tax in the Other\nInternet Resources section). Similar claims have been made on behalf\nof resource extraction, fuel, carbon, and even global income\ntaxes. \n\n\nThe policy proposals mentioned above are quite controversial. They\nsuggest, however, that the very concept of benefit and compensatory\ntaxation is a rather complex idea, presupposing a baseline against\nwhich specific policies and institutional arrangements can be seen to\nbenefit or harm persons. Several baselines can be invoked in making\nsuch comparisons, including what people would have had in a\n\u2018state of nature,\u2019 in a laissez-faire scheme, within an\norder in which people\u2019s basic needs are met insofar as possible, and so\non. Different baselines will yield different verdicts about these\narrangements. And since none of the baselines is obviously more\n\u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 than others, moral\nreasons must be adduced for treating one or another of them as the\nappropriate benchmark for assessing the magnitudes of harm and benefit\nthat a particular institutional order engenders. Whether we judge\ninstitutional arrangements to have harmed or benefited some agent\n\u2014 and therefore whether or not the taxes that these and other\nagents pay are redistributive \u2014 depends upon our substantive\nnormative assessments regarding how these arrangements should be\ndesigned.\n\n\nThe social practices that are sometimes said to involve\nrights infringing transfers include compulsory taxation that is used to\npay for welfare, social programs provided for the poor and unemployed,\nand foreign development aid. It is somewhat curious that many critics\nof conservative and libertarian positions seem to agree that taxation\ninvolves redistribution through violation (or at least infringement) of\nproperty rights \u2014 while maintaining that this is nevertheless\njustified given the importance of other social\n goals.[13]\n Indeed,\ndefenses of the welfare state have typically represented\ntaxation for welfare programs as a form of state-administered\ninfringement of property rights \u2014 or \u2018enforced\ncharity\u2019. These judgments depend, however, on highly specific\n(and contentious) understandings of economic justice and the processes\nthat give rise to valid entitlements. They seem to suppose, for\nexample, that people have valid moral claims to their gross incomes. A\nmore robust egalitarian critique of these claims would question whether\ngross income provides the appropriate benchmark for judging whether\nrights-infringing transfers have occurred. U.S. citizens have a right\nonly to their net incomes, not their gross incomes. They are legally\nobligated not to evade payment of income tax. The choice of a tax\nscheme does not reflect a commitment to infringing property rights to\nserve social goals; indeed, no individual or government agency may\ninterfere with the (legal) use of net income. Rather, the tax scheme\nreflects a commitment to fixing the content of the rules that\ndetermine valid property rights in a particular way. That is, the\nincome tax is part of the process that fixes the initial (normatively\nrelevant) distribution, to which the right-holder is completely\n entitled.[14]\n The income tax does not represent redistribution, since this\ntakes for granted some different initial distribution of rightful\nholdings (and thus a right with a different object: in this case,\ngross\n income).[15]\n Indeed, consideration of social goals such as general economic\nsecurity, for instance, often figure in the design of an\neconomic system, including its monetary policies and tax rates, but\nthese same goals seldom figure in justifications of infringements of\nrights (for example, the repossession of goods that have come to be\nheld by legal means within that system) (Murphy\n& Nagel 2003, Pogge 1989).  Once we have fixed the content of our economic\nground rules (according, of course, to some account of justice), they\ncannot be viewed as \u2018redistributive\u2019 in the\nrights-infringing sense. Rather, they ought to be viewed as governing\nhow economic benefits and burdens are rightfully distributed in the\nfirst place. This is just a specific instance of the general\ndistinction, stressed by Rawls (2001), between the use of\nforward-looking considerations in justifying a practice (or, in this\ncase, an institutional design) and using those same considerations to\njustify infringement of the rules of an ongoing practice.\n\n\nThe considerations above do not in themselves show, as Liam Murphy and\nThomas Nagel (2003) have argued, that \u201cTaxes do not\ntake away from taxpayers what is antecedently theirs; pretax income\nhas no status as a moral baseline for the purpose of evaluating the\njustice of the tax system.\u201d Indeed, libertarians and others can\nstill make out their case that rights-infringing redistribution has\noccurred by specifying and justifying entitlement producing rules\nthat, if accepted, would grant pretax income significance as\na moral baseline. They may argue, for example, that gross incomes have\nmoral significance because they show the value of one\u2019s contribution\nto social cooperation as assessed by others, or because they represent\n(at least roughly) differentials in what individuals contribute to\ntotal\n production.[16]\n\n\nBy employing the concept of redistribution, both libertarians and\ntheir egalitarian critics make it appear that laissez-faire\ninstitutions are natural and define the baseline distribution. They\nseem therefore to share the conviction that egalitarians seek to\nrevise these distributions ex post through redistributive\ntransfers.  But this presupposes that the libertarians are correct in\ntheir specification of entitlement producing processes that produce\nthe initial distribution. The fact that particular forms of taxation\nare often seen as redistributive in this sense is due to a tacit\npresupposition that a very specific kind of free-market scheme should\nserves as a morally privileged \n benchmark.[17]\n Those who find that only a more\negalitarian set of social arrangements is ethically defensible will\n(symmetrically) view the distributions that come about pursuant to a\nlasses-faire market scheme as involving rights infringing\nredistribution. Here again, the debate is better understood as\nconcerning what the correct predistribution of right ought to be\n(O\u2019Neill and Williamson 2012).\n3. Conclusion\n\n\nThere are, no doubt, reasons for considering certain economic\nsystems just, and others unjust, but it has turned out to be difficult\nto use the concept of redistribution to mark out differences between\nthem. Redistribution in any of the three diachronic senses, and in\neither of the unmoralized synchronic senses appears to lack basic moral\nsignificance. Redistribution as tax and transfer or as rights\ninfringement may indeed have basic moral significance. The\nclassification of policies and institutional arrangements as\nredistributive in either of these senses, however, has been shown to\ndepend on our moral assessment of these practices, and cannot thus be\nused as a basis for such assessments.\n\n\nBut couching discussions of distributive justice in terms implied by\nredistribution smuggles in associations of forceful takings and rights\ninfringements, which are not obviously appropriate in the context of\nevaluating social programs funded through taxation, or to discussions\nof reforms of the global economy. Moreover, focusing on the\npermissibility of \u2018helping\u2019 and \u2018aiding\u2019 poorer\npeople through \u2018redistributive\u2019 transfers seems tacitly to\naccept the existing distribution of holdings as a morally unproblematic\nbenchmark. This focus will tend to privilege the status quo, and foster\nresistance to more egalitarian social arrangements.",
