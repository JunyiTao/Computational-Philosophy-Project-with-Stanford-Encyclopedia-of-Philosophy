    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nThe notion of replication arose as a concern in the period immediately\nafter the Second World War (see\n Figure 1),\n with the rise of information theory, communication theory,\ncybernetics, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s 1944 book What is\nLife? Biologists immediately began to consider the\ninformational aspect of life, in each of these theoretical frameworks,\nin areas ranging from neurology to molecular biology, but especially\nthe latter (Brookes 1956; Eigen & de Maeyer 1966; Gatlin 1972;\nJohnson 1970; Linschitz 1953; Margalef 1957 [1958]; Quastler 1953;\nRashevsky 1955). It was only after the development of communications\ntheory by Shannon (1948) and cybernetics by Wiener (1948) after\nit that inheritance in biology took on a specifically\ninformational tint (Griffiths & Stotz 2007). This is the case in\nparticular of the work of Watson and Crick on the double helix\nstructure of DNA (Watson & Crick 1953), as well as Crick\u2019s\nCentral Dogma, which states that information cannot flow from protein\nto DNA. The Central Dogma (Crick 1958) was initially cast in terms of\nstructural information (\u0160ustar 2007;\n Figure 2) and\n later recast by Crick as a more cybernetic or computational kind of\ninformation (Crick 1970). [See Eugene V. Koonin 2012 & 2015 for\ndiscussion of the nature of the Central Dogma in current biology.]\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Yearly frequency of count for\nthe word \u201creplication\u201d in Google text\u2019s English\ncorpus from 1800\u20132000 with smoothing = 3. Data obtained from\nGoogle Ngram Viewer (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nStructural information is effectively based on the transfer of\nmolecular primary sequences (linear sequence) in the synthesis of\npolypeptides; that is, it is the literal sequence of basic groups\n(amino acids), before the protein folds into secondary and higher\nconformations. This is a physical and causal account of information:\nthe new molecule has its sequence because it was templated in some way\nby the \u201cinformation\u201d-imparting molecule (in this case, DNA\nto proteins). Griffiths and Stotz (see below) call this, accordingly,\n\u201cCrick information\u201d.\n\nHowever, in the late 1950s, after the structure of DNA had become more\nwidely understood, chemist Homer Jacobson proposed a\ncybernetic model of reproduction (Jacobson 1958), going so\nfar as to make a literal model out of train sets and electronic\ncircuits. Later, von Neumann proposed a theory of self-reproducing\nautomata (Neumann 1966), which has become a parallel but influential\nresearch program to the issue in biology (Mitchell 2009). Jacob (1973)\ncemented the logical description of heredity, but the ultimate\nclassical source of the notion that genes are information comes from\nWilliams\u2019 classic 1966 book Adaptation and Natural\nSelection, in which he referred to genes as \u201ccybernetic\nabstractions\u201d (1966: 33).\n\nThe cybernetic notion of reproduction (and, later, replication) rested\non the notion that genes were controllers of phenotypes;\nlater, this came to be identified (e.g., by Gatlin) as synonymous with\nthe \u201ccommunication\u201d conception of information that Shannon\nproposed. In biology, genes came to be seen as \u201cprograms\u201d\nfor phenotypes [senders] that passed themselves on to progeny\n[receivers], around 1961 (Peluffo 2015).\n\nWilliams\u2019 book was one inspiration for Dawkins\u2019\nSelfish Gene (1976), and much of what Dawkins proposed about\nreplicators is an extension of Williams\u2019 views, in conjunction\nwith those of William D. Hamilton (1964) and various ethological\nideas. This view is now known as the gene\u2019s eye view (for\ndiscussions see Okasha 2006, Chapter 5; \u00c5gren 2021).\n\nWilliams introduced the notion of a gene as a substrate neutral\nentity:\n\n\nI use the term \u2018gene\u2019 to mean that which separates and\nrecombines with appreciable frequency, (1966: 20)\n\n\nand he further defined an evolutionary gene (that is, one\nthat is selectively important):\n\n\n[A] gene could be defined as any hereditary information for which\nthere is a favorable or unfavorable selection bias equal to several or\nmany times its rate of endogenous change. (1966: 25)\n\n\nHis answer to the question of what a gene is, is that a gene is\nevolutionary just insofar as it is something heritable that is subject\nto rates of selection that exceed the mutation rate. This is a\ndefinition, not a discovery. If it is favorably or unfavorably\nselected and heritable, it is an evolutionary gene. According to this\ndefinition, items that are not made of DNA can be classed as\nevolutionary genes so long as they match Williams\u2019 definition\n(Lu & Bourrat 2018).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.
