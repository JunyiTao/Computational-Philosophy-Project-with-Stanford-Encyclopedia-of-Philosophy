    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors || Non-Parental Responsibilities\n1.4 Non-Parental Responsibilities\n\nEven if gamete donors are not parents, they may still have substantial\nobligations towards their offspring. Bayne (2003) argues that gamete\ndonors have the responsibility to prevent certain kinds of lives from\ncoming about. For instance, they may be obliged to refrain from\ncreating children with severe congenital diseases that would result in\na \u2018life not worth living\u2019. Many authors (Bayne 2003;\nArchard 2010; Porter 2014; Fuscaldo 2006; O\u2019Neill 1979, Brandt\n2016) also think that gamete donors must take steps to ensure that\ntheir offspring will be parented in at least a minimally acceptable\nmanner.\n\nWhile the preceding responsibilities concern pre-conditions for the\npermissible transfer of gametes, there might also be donor\nresponsibilities that extend into the lives of donor-conceived\noffspring. For instance, as noted above, Brake (2005, 2010) argues\nthat gamete donors might have an ongoing duty to ensure that their\nbiological offspring receive a minimum level of care (she calls these\n\u2018procreative costs\u2019), but that this should not be confused\nwith parental responsibilities, which are more intimate and more\nmorally weighty in nature. Likewise Brake, Porter (2012, 2014) and\nBrandt (2016, 2020) similarly argue that gamete donors must continue\nto take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent life,\nthough they are not necessarily obligated to parent their offspring\nthemselves. \n\nThere are reasons to think that these responsibilities do not go far\nenough. For instance Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between\nBrake\u2019s \u2018procreative costs\u2019 and parental\nresponsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears.\nConsequently, for all practical purposes gamete donors have\nresponsibilities edging on full blown parenthood. Conversely,\narguments originating in the abortion literature imply that gamete\ndonors need only ensure that their offspring have lives worth living.\nFor a discussion of these arguments and a response see Brandt (2020).\n\n\nAnother kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have\nis to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with\ntheir biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an\nobligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999; Kolodny\n2010). \n",
