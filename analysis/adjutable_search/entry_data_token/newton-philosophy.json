He witnessed the end of the Aristotelian dominance of philosophy\nin Europe, the rise and fall of Cartesianism, the emergence of\n\u201cexperimental philosophy,\u201d and the development of numerous\nexperimental and mathematical methods for the study of nature. Indeed,\nhe helped to develop many of those methods. Newton\u2019s\ncontributions to mathematics\u2014including the co-discovery with\nG.W. Leibniz of what we now call the calculus\u2014and to what is now\ncalled physics, including both its experimental and theoretical\naspects, will forever dominate discussions of his lasting influence.\nHis impact on the development of early modern philosophy was also\nprofound; indeed, it is difficult to grasp the history of philosophy\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries without\nconsidering Newton\u2019s role. His engagement with Cartesian ideas\nand methods early in his life was just as significant to the\ntransformation of philosophy in the seventeenth century as his debates\nwith Leibniz were to the setting of the agenda of philosophy in the\neighteenth. Obviously, Newton is not part of the traditional\nphilosophy canon of the period. That fact reflects an anachronistic\napproach to the history of modern philosophy that we have inherited\nfrom French and German scholars of the nineteenth century. During the\nheight of the Enlightenment, Newton was always characterized as a\ncanonical philosopher: for instance, he plays a leading role in the\nvery first \u201cmodern\u201d history of modern philosophy, Johann\nJacob Brucker\u2019s Historia Critica Philosophiae of 1744.\nEvery major Enlightenment thinker, from Diderot to D\u2019Alembert to\nKant, was influenced by Brucker\u2019s account of modern philosophy.\nIn tandem, numerous works on \u201cNewton\u2019s philosophy\u201d\nand his \u201cphilosophical discoveries\u201d were published\nthroughout the eighteenth century in every major European language. By\nthe early nineteenth century, however, a separation between\n\u201cscience\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d had been\neffectuated, which led to Newton\u2019s shunting into the science\ncanon. Recent scholarship has challenged this conception of the canon.\nMoreover, Newton engaged with, or influenced, many of the standardly\ncanonical philosophers of the early modern era, including Descartes,\nLocke, Berkeley, Hume, Leibniz and Kant. His influence on early modern\nphilosophy is a rich topic.\n", "toc": [{"#PlaNewHisNat": "1. Placing Newton in the history of natural philosophy"}, {"#MetIOptDeb167": "2.

Placing Newton in the history of natural philosophy\n\nTraditionally, Newton would be characterized as a mathematician for\nhis work on the calculus and as a scientist for his work in physics.\nHis celebrated talent in mathematics is perhaps equaled not only by\nhis profound theorizing concerning the physical world, but also his\ninfluential experimental methods. Indeed, Newton is remarkable for the\nfact that his work as a theoretician is matched by his work as an\nexperimentalist\u2014either aspect of his oeuvre would be\nsufficient to secure his place in the history of modern science. So in\nthe popular imagination, and in the history books, Newton is seen as\none of the greatest scientists of the modern period, on a par with few\nothers (perhaps Darwin or Einstein). This view will continue to\ndominate our understanding of Newton in the twenty-first century.\n\nIf we attempt to understand Newton\u2019s work from an historical\npoint of view, however, a more complex conception emerges. When Newton\npublished his principal works, he was not contributing to a\nwell-established field, he was helping to create modern mathematical\nphysics. This meant that few of his ideas, methods, or approaches,\nwhether in mathematics or in experimental physics, could be taken for\ngranted. From his first papers in the early 1670s, on optics, until\nhis last days working on the third and final edition of his magnum\nopus the Principia decades later, philosophers,\nmathematicians and experimenters challenged Newton\u2019s approach.\nThis frequently upset Newton, who had a famous, lifelong aversion to\nintellectual debate and controversy. But in a sense, it helped to\nensure the importance of Newton\u2019s ideas for philosophy.\nObviously, Newton never wrote a philosophical text on the order of\nDescartes\u2019s Meditations, Locke\u2019s Essay,\nor Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. He never produced what the\nlumi\u00e8res who studied him would have called a\n\u201csystem\u201d of philosophy. But the intense controversies\nproduced by his mathematical, empirical and philosophical methods and\nideas continually prompted him to broach philosophical topics (Janiak\n2015). As a result, he was widely considered a leading philosopher\nthroughout the Enlightenment. In the first modern history of\nphilosophy, Brucker\u2019s Historia Critica Philosophiae,\nNewton plays a central role in discussions of the modern era (Volume\n4.2: 639-55). He is also a central figure in D\u2019Alembert\u2019s\ndiscussion of the emergence of modern science and philosophy: Newton\nis listed along with Bacon, Descartes, Locke and Leibniz as a key\nfigure in the Preliminary Discourse (80-83).\n\nThe eighteenth-century tendency to discuss Newton\u2019s\nphilosophy, rather than his science, may have an odd\nring to modern ears. In this case, however, the evolution of the\nEnglish language tracks a substantive intellectual development. As a\nmatter of historical fact, the category of the scientist\u2014along\nwith that word in English\u2014is a nineteenth-century invention.\nSpecifically, at a meeting of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science in June of 1833, the Cambridge philosopher\nWilliam Whewell coined the word \u201cscientist\u201d. Whewell said\nthat just as the practitioners of art are called\n\u201cartists\u201d, the practitioners of science ought to be called\n\u201cscientists\u201d, indicating that they should no longer be\ncalled\n philosophers.[1]\n Indeed, before the early nineteenth century, people like Newton were\ncalled \u201cphilosophers\u201d, or more specifically,\n\u201cnatural philosophers\u201d. During the seventeenth century,\nand well into the eighteenth (at least until 1750, if not later),\nfigures like Newton worked within the century\u2019s old tradition of\nnatural\n philosophy.[2]\n The modern disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology and so on, had\nnot yet been formed. (The words \u2018physics\u2019 in\nEnglish, \u2019physique\u2019 in French, and \u2018physica\u2019\nin Latin were often used, but had a very broad meaning, like\n\u201cnatural philosophy.\u201d) Philosophers who studied nature\ninvestigated such things as planetary motions, the nature of matter,\nand the possibility of a vacuum, but they also discussed many aspects\nof human beings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its\ndivine creator (Hatfield 1996). As the title of Newton\u2019s magnum\nopus, Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), suggests, he\nintended his work to be in dialogue with Descartes\u2019s\nPrincipia Philosophiae (Principles of Philosophy,\n1644). Descartes\u2019s Principles is a complex text that\nincludes discussions of everything from the laws of nature to the\nnature of God\u2019s causal influence on the world. Descartes had\nfamously promised that his physics required nothing more than the\nprinciples of geometry and pure mathematics (Principles, Part\nTwo, \u00a764). Although Descartes was a great mathematician, the\nauthor of a major work in geometry in 1637, Newton thought nonetheless\nthat he had not lived up to this promise, so he would assuredly\nintroduce mathematical principles for natural philosophy.\nJust as Descartes had sought to replace Aristotelian or\n\u201cScholastic\u201d methods and doctrines in natural philosophy,\nNewton sought to replace Descartes\u2019s. It is therefore more\nhistorically accurate and more illuminating to interpret Newton within\nthe historical stream of natural\n philosophy.[3]\n\nAs is well known, natural philosophy in the Aristotelian traditions of\nthe thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries involved an analysis of\nAristotle\u2019s ideas about the natural world, especially within the\nChristianized context of the medieval period. Philosophers studying\nnature were often actually studying texts\u2014such as commentaries\non Aristotle\u2014rather than conducting experiments or engaging in\nobservations, and they often did not employ mathematical techniques.\nTraditionally, natural philosophy in Aristotelian circles was not\nconceived of as a mathematical discipline (unlike, say, optics or\nastronomy); instead, it focused especially on the natures of objects\nand on causation. In the seventeenth century, natural philosophers\nlike Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, and Newton began to reject not only\nthe doctrines of the Aristotelians, but their techniques as well,\ndeveloping a number of new mathematical, conceptual and experimental\nmethods. Newton respected Descartes\u2019s rejection of Aristotelian\nideas, but argued that Cartesians did not employ enough of the\nmathematical techniques of Galileo, or the experimental methods of\nBoyle, in trying to understand nature. Of course, these developments\nhave often been regarded as central to the Scientific Revolution.\nDespite the centrality of these changes during the seventeenth\ncentury, however, the scope of natural philosophy had not\ndramatically changed. Natural philosophers like Newton expended\nconsiderable energy trying to understand, e.g., the nature of space,\ntime and motion, but they regarded that endeavor as a component of an\noverarching enterprise that also included an analysis of the divine\nbeing. Newton was a natural philosopher\u2014unlike Descartes, he was\nnot a founder of modern philosophy, for he never wrote a treatise of\nthe order of the Meditations. Nonetheless, his\ninfluence on philosophy in the eighteenth century was\nprofound, extending well beyond the bounds of philosophers studying\nnature, encompassing numerous figures and traditions in Britain, on\nthe Continent, and even in the New\n World.[4]\n Newton\u2019s influence has at least two salient aspects.\n\nFirst, Newton\u2019s achievement in the Opticks and in the\nPrincipia was understood to be of such philosophical import\nthat few philosophers in the eighteenth century ignored it. Most of\nthe canonical philosophers in this period sought to interpret various\nof Newton\u2019s epistemic claims within the terms of their own\nsystems, and many saw the coherence of their own views with those of\nNewton as a criterion of philosophical excellence. Early in the\ncentury, Berkeley grappled with Newton\u2019s work on the calculus in\nThe Analyst (1734) and with his dynamics in De Motu\n(1721), and he even mentioned gravity, the paradigmatic Newtonian\nforce, in his popular work Three Dialogues between Hylas and\nPhilonous (1713). When Berkeley lists what philosophers take to\nbe the so-called primary qualities of material bodies in the\nDialogues, he remarkably adds \u201cgravity\u201d to the\nmore familiar list of size, shape, motion, and solidity, thereby\nsuggesting that the received view of material bodies had already\nchanged before the second edition of the Principia had\ncirculated widely. Remarkably, in that same year Roger Cotes, the\neditor of the second edition of Newton\u2019s Principia, had\nargued in his editor\u2019s preface that gravity should indeed be\nconsidered a primary quality along with the more familiar mechanist\nproperties that had been the subject of so much discussion in previous\nyears. (Newton himself approached the topic more cautiously.) For his\npart, Hume interpreted Newtonian natural philosophy in an empiricist\nvein and noted some of its broader implications in his Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739) and Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1750). Newton\u2019s work also served as the\nimpetus for the extremely influential correspondence between Leibniz\nand the Newtonian Samuel Clarke early in the century, a correspondence\nthat proved significant even for thinkers writing toward the\ncentury\u2019s end. Unlike the vis viva controversy and\nother disputes between the Cartesians and the Leibnizians, which died\nout by the middle of the century, the debate between the Leibnizians\nand the Newtonians remained philosophically salient for decades,\nserving as an impetus for \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\ninfluential work during the French Enlightenment, Foundations of\nPhysics (1740), and also as one of the driving forces behind\nKant\u2019s development of the \u201ccritical\u201d philosophy\nduring the 1770s, culminating in the Critique of Pure Reason\nin 1781. In addition, Newton\u2019s work spawned an immense\ncommentarial literature in English, French, and Latin, including John\nKeill\u2019s Introduction to Natural Philosophy (1726),\nFrancesco Algarotti\u2019s Newtonianism for the Ladies\n(1738), Henry Pemberton\u2019s A View of Sir Isaac\nNewton\u2019s Philosophy (1728), Voltaire\u2019s Elements\nof the Philosophy of Newton (1738), Willem Gravesande\u2019s\nMathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy (1747), Colin\nMacLaurin\u2019s An Account of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s\nPhilosophical Discoveries (1748), and many more besides.\nMoreover, two subsequent Continental editions of Newton\u2019s text\ncontained substantial philosophical engagements not only with his own\nideas, but with those of his potential rivals like the great\nmathematician Johan Bernoulli and also Leibniz. The famous\n\u201cJesuit\u201d (or \u201cGeneva\u201d) edition of\nPrincipia mathematica published by Fathers Le Seur and\nJacquier in 1739-1744 in three volumes engaged substantially with\nLeibnizian ideas (Guicciardini 2015). And \u00c9milie Du\nCh\u00e2telet wrote an extensive \u201canalytical\ncommentary\u201d as part of her complete French translation of the\nPrincipia, published posthumously in 1759. Part of the idea\nwas to translate Newton\u2019s old \u201cgeometric\u201d approach\nto physics into the new language of analysis, a project that was\nintertwined with numerous philosophical issues. Newton\u2019s ideas\nand methods in mathematics, physics and philosophy therefore continued\nto be of substantial importance well into the Enlightenment.\n\nA second aspect of Newton\u2019s influence involves thinkers who\nattempted in one way or another to articulate, follow, or extend, the\nNewtonian \u201cmethod\u201d in natural philosophy when treating\nissues and questions that Newton ignored. Euclidean geometry and its\nmethods were seen as a fundamental epistemic model for much of\nseventeenth-century philosophy\u2014as is well known,\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations attempts to achieve a type of\ncertainty he likens to that found in geometry, and Spinoza wrote his\nEthics according to the \u201cgeometrical method\u201d.\nPropositions deduced from axioms in Euclidean geometry were seen as\nparadigm cases of knowledge. We might see Newton\u2019s work as\nproviding eighteenth-century philosophy with one of its primary\nmodels, and with a series of epistemic exemplars as well. But part of\nphilosophy\u2019s task was to articulate precisely what the new\nNewtonian method involved. David Hume is perhaps clearest about this\naspect of Newton\u2019s influence: his Treatise of 1739 has\nthe subtitle, \u201cAn Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method\nof Reasoning Into Moral Subjects\u201d, and there can be little doubt\nthat he meant (at least in part) the method of the Opticks\nand the Principia (DePierris 2012). Indeed, as Hume\u2019s\ntext makes abundantly clear, various eighteenth-century philosophers,\nincluding not only Hume in Scotland but Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the\nContinent, were taken to be, or attempted to become, \u201cthe Newton\nof the\n mind\u201d.[5]\n For Hume, this meant following what he took to be Newton\u2019s\nempirical method by providing the proper description of the relevant\nphenomena and then finding the most general principles that account\nfor them. Of course, one aspect of Hume\u2019s work is to provide an\nanalysis of the concept of causation that is far more extensive than\nanything found in Newton, which has a substantial impact on what\ncounts as an \u201caccount\u201d of a phenomenon. This method would\nallow us to achieve the highest level of knowledge attainable in the\nrealm of what Hume calls \u201cmatters of\n fact\u201d.[6]\n\nDespite the influence of Newton\u2019s \u201cmethod\u201d on\neighteenth-century philosophy, it is obvious that the\nPrincipia\u2019s greater impact on the eighteenth century is\nto have effected a branching within natural philosophy that led to the\ndevelopment of mathematical physics on the one hand, and philosophy on\nthe other (Cohen and Smith, 2002, 1-4). And yet to achieve an\nunderstanding of how Newton himself approached natural philosophy, we\nmust carefully bracket such historical developments\u2014they did not\nsolidify until sometime after 1750, a generation after Newton\u2019s\ndeath. Indeed, if we resist the temptation to understand Newton as\nworking within a well established discipline called mathematical\nphysics, if we see him instead as a philosopher studying nature, his\nachievement is far more impressive, for instead of contributing to a\nwell-founded field of physics, he had to begin a process that would\neventually lead aspects of natural philosophy to be transformed into a\nnew field of study. This transformation took many decades, involving a\nseries of methodological and foundational debates about the proper\nmeans for obtaining knowledge about nature and its processes. Newton\nhimself not only engaged in these debates from his very first\npublication in optics in 1672, but his work in both optics and in the\nPrincipia generated some of the most significant\nmethodological discussions and controversies in the late seventeenth\nand early eighteenth centuries. These debates concerned such topics as\nthe proper use of hypotheses, the nature of space and time, the best\nunderstanding of the forces of nature, and the appropriate rules for\nconducting research in natural philosophy. Newton\u2019s achievement\nwas in part to have vanquished both Cartesian and Leibnizian\napproaches to natural philosophy; in the later eighteenth century, and\nindeed much of the nineteenth, physics was a Newtonian enterprise more\nthan anything. But this achievement, from Newton\u2019s own\nperspective, involved an extensive, life-long series of philosophical\ndebates. Those debates focused on numerous substantive issues, but\nalso included extensive discussions of the proper methodology in\nnatural philosophy.\n2. Methodology I: the optics debates of the 1670s\n\nPhilosophers have long known about the aspects of Newton\u2019s work\nthat are salient for understanding debates in the early modern period.\nFor instance, no history of debates about the ontology of space and\ntime would exclude a discussion of Newton\u2019s famous conception of\n\u201cabsolute\u201d space (see below). Similarly, any discussion of\nthe role of hypotheses in philosophical reasoning would mention Newton\nprominently. These aspects of Newton\u2019s work continue to be\nsignificant in contemporary scholarship, but the scope of discussions\nof Newton has greatly expanded, encompassing the whole of his\nintellectual life. This is especially evident in discussions of\nNewton\u2019s earliest published work, which was in the field of\noptics. In at least three relevant respects, Newton\u2019s early work\nin optics, which was published in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society beginning in 1672, set the\nstage for the principal themes of his long career in natural\nphilosophy (he remained active well into his seventies). Firstly,\nNewton\u2019s letter to the Society\u2019s secretary, Henry\nOldenburg, often called the \u201cNew theory about light and\ncolors\u201d, generated an immediate, extensive, and protracted\ndebate that eventually involved important philosophers such as Robert\nHooke in Britain and Christiaan Huygens, G.W. Leibniz and Ignatius\nPardies on the Continent (the beginning of the very long title of the\npaper is: \u201cA letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Mathematick Professor\nin the University of Cambridge, containing his New Theory about Light\nand Colors\u201d). Newton consistently regarded these figures not\nmerely as disagreeing with his views, but as misinterpreting them.\nThis experience helped to shape Newton\u2019s famous and lifelong\naversion to intellectual controversy, a feature of his personality\nthat he often mentioned in letters, and one that he would never\noutgrow. Secondly, because Newton regarded himself as having been\ndeeply misinterpreted by his critics, he had recourse to meta-level or\nmethodological discussions of the practice of optics and of the kinds\nof knowledge that philosophers can obtain when engaging in experiments\nwith light. The novelty and power of Newton\u2019s work in the\nPrincipia years later would eventually generate similar\ncontroversies that led him to analogous kinds of methodological\ndiscussions of his experimental practice within natural philosophy and\nof the kinds of knowledge that one can obtain in that field using\neither experimental or mathematical techniques. From our\npoint of view, Newton\u2019s science was unusually philosophical for\nthese reasons. Thirdly and finally, in his earliest optical work\nNewton began to formulate a distinction that would remain salient\nthroughout his long intellectual career, contending that a philosopher\nmust distinguish between a conclusion or claim about some feature of\nnature that is derived from experimental or observational evidence,\nand a conclusion or claim that is a mere \u201chypothesis\u201d, a\nkind of speculation about nature that is not, or not yet anyway, so\nderived. Newton\u2019s much later proclamation in the second edition\nof the Principia (1713), \u201cHypotheses non\nfingo\u201d, or \u201cI feign no hypotheses\u201d, would\ninfuriate his critics just as much as it would prod his followers into\nmaking the pronouncement a central component of a newly emerging\nNewtonian method (see below for details).\n\nThe field of optics has its origins in the Ancient Greek period, when\nfigures like Euclid and Ptolemy wrote works on the subject, but they\noften focused primarily on the science of vision, analyzing (e.g.) the\nvisual rays that were sometimes thought to extrude from the eye,\nenabling it to perceive distant physical objects. In the early modern\nperiod, Kepler and Descartes each made fundamental contributions to\nthe field, including the discovery of the inversion of the retinal\nimage (in the former case) and an explanation of refraction (in the\nlatter case). Newton\u2019s work helped to shift the focus of optics\nfrom an analysis of vision to an investigation of light. In \u201cNew\ntheory about light and colors\u201d, published in the\nPhilosophical Transactions in 1672, Newton presented a number\nof experiments in which sunlight was allowed to pass through one or\ntwo prisms in order to probe some of its basic features. The paper\nrecounts a number of experiments that Newton says he had conducted\nseveral years earlier. But what precisely counts as a feature\nof light? Numerous philosophers during the seventeenth century,\nincluding Hooke and Huygens, developed doctrines concerning the\nfundamental physical nature of light in answer to the question: is\nlight a stream of particles (or \u201ccorpuscles\u201d), or a wave?\nBoth Hooke and Huygens were wave theorists. This question obviously\ncontinued to have relevance into the twentieth century, when\nwave-particle duality was discovered. In his experiments with the\nprism, however, Newton apparently sought to investigate something\nelse, viz. what he calls \u201cthe celebrated Phenomena of\nColours\u201d. Newton\u2019s various prism experiments, which\nhe describes in considerable depth, suggested what he called a\n\u201cDoctrine\u201d that he expresses in thirteen consecutive\nnumbered propositions. Included in these propositions are the\nfollowing claims about features of rays of light: first, the rays of\nlight that emerge when sunlight passes through a prism exhibit various\ncolors; second, these colors differ in their \u201cdegrees of\nRefrangibility\u201d, which means that they exhibit and retain an\nindex of refraction, even when they are passed through a second prism;\nthird, these colors\u2014or colorful rays\u2014are not modifications\nof sunlight itself, but are \u201cOriginal and connate\nproperties\u201d of it; and, fourth, these facts mean that\nalthough ordinary sunlight appears white, or perhaps colorless, to our\nperception, it actually contains numerous colors within it, which can\nbe experimentally revealed. This final point suggests, in turn, that\nfrom Newton\u2019s point of view, colors are not solely perceived, or\neven perceptible, aspects of physical objects; they can also be\nconceived of as hidden features of light which cannot be perceived\ndirectly under any ordinary circumstance (the physical influence of\nthe prism is required for them to become perceptible).\n\nFrom a contemporary point of view, Newton\u2019s 1672 paper exhibits\nan intriguing blend of experimental evidence and philosophical\nargumentation. The latter hinges on Newton\u2019s interpretation of\nthe concept of a property or a quality, as the following passage,\nwhich follows the \u201cDoctrine\u201d expressed in thirteen\npropositions, tellingly reveals:\n\n\nThese things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be\ncolours in the dark, nor whether they be the qualities of the objects\nwe see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours\nare the qualities of Light, having its Rays for their entire\nand immediate subject, how can we think those Rays qualities\nalso, unless one quality may be the subject of and sustain another;\nwhich in effect is to call it substance. We should not know\nBodies for substances, were it not for their sensible qualities, and\nthe Principal of those being now found due to something else, we have\nas good reason to believe that to be a substance also. (Newton\n1959\u2013, vol. 1: 100)\n\n\nNewton seems here to be arguing as follows: since rays of light have\ncolors as basic features, we should regard these colors as qualities\nor properties of the rays (despite the fact that these properties are\nimperceptible under any ordinary circumstance); but doing so requires\nus to think of the rays as bearers of qualities, which is to say, as\nsubstances in their own right. And if rays of light are substances,\nthis means that we cannot also think of them as qualities or\nproperties of anything else. This last point follows from a widely\naccepted notion of a substance at the time, one easily found in\n Descartes[7],\n viz., that substances are those items that can exist independently of\nother items (whether they can exist independently even of God is a\nfurther question that we can ignore here). And if we cannot think of\nrays of light as properties or qualities, then they are not waves, for\nwaves are features of some medium\u2014think of waves on the surface\nof a lake. Newton concludes: light is a stream of particles (he does\nuse the word \u2018perhaps\u2019 to hedge a bit here). Clearly,\nphilosophical argumentation is a significant aspect of Newton\u2019s\nreasoning in this paper, as are various philosophical concepts. It is\nintriguing to ponder the question, what overall conception of\n\u201csensible qualities\u201d does Newton presuppose in this piece?\nIf a ray of sunlight passes through my window, the fact that it\nappears white to me does not undermine Newton\u2019s view (or so he\nthinks) that the ray actually contains a series of colors as its\n\u201cqualities\u201d. Are these qualities \u201csensible\u201d if\ntheir presence can be detected only through the use of one or more\nprisms but never through the inspection of the sunlight through\nordinary means (unaided perception, glasses, a magnifying glass,\netc.)? These are apt to strike us as canonical philosophical\nproblems.\n\nNewton\u2019s line of argument quoted above became one of the\ncenterpieces of the debate that his paper generated. In some parts of\nhis paper, when Newton wrote of the \u201crays\u201d of light, he\nhad evidently intended to remain neutral on the question of whether\nthe rays are particles or waves (this is reminiscent of the ancient\nGreek practice of avoiding physical discussions of visual rays). But\nthen towards the paper\u2019s end, Newton added his new line of\nargument, which employed some philosophical analysis together with\nsome experimental evidence to support the conclusion that rays of\nlight cannot be waves after all. Newton\u2019s critics pounced. This\nled to the first problem he encountered in response to his paper: what\nhe calls his \u201ctheory\u201d of light and colors was not merely\nrejected, but rather immediately misunderstood, at least from his own\nperspective. Just days after Newton\u2019s paper was read at the\nRoyal Society, Robert Hooke responded with a detailed letter to\nOldenburg. In the first few sentences, Hooke indicates that from his\npoint of view, Newton\u2019s \u201cHypothesis of saving the\nphenomena of colours\u201d essentially involves the contention that\nrays of light are particulate, rather than\n wavelike.[8]\n Hooke argues, in contrast, that light \u201cis nothing but a pulse\nor motion propagated through an homogeneous, uniform and transparent\nmedium;\u201d that is, he argues that light is indeed wavelike. He\nmakes it perfectly clear, moreover, that his hypothesis\u2014the name\ndid not carry a negative connotation in his work\u2014can save the\nphenomena of colors just as well as Newton\u2019s, which is to say,\nhis hypothesis is compatible with the experimental evidence Newton had\ngathered. Evidently, the line of argument in the passage quoted above\ncaught Hooke\u2019s eye. Among philosophers, he was not alone. In a\nletter to Huygens explaining Newton\u2019s theory of light, Leibniz\nwrites that Newton takes light to be a \u201cbody\u201d propelled\nfrom the sun to the earth which, according to Leibniz, Newton takes to\nexplain both the differential refrangibility of rays of light and the\nphenomena of\n colors.[9]\n Since Newton had employed the concepts of substance, quality and\nsensible quality when concluding in his paper that light is\n(presumably) particulate, we are apt to regard the paper as\ncontributing to important discussions within philosophy. After the\nextensive correspondence, and controversy, generated in response to\nNewton\u2019s early optical views and experiments, he often\nthreatened to avoid engaging in mathematical and philosophical\ndisputes altogether. He insisted to friends and colleagues that he\nfound intellectual controversy unbearable. But he never followed\nthrough with his threat to disengage from discussions in natural\nphilosophy, sending many important letters throughout his long\nintellectual career.\n3. Newton\u2019s relation to Cartesianism\n\nLike many philosophers who worked in the wake of Galileo and of\nDescartes, it seems that Newton never extensively analyzed\nAristotelian ideas about nature. He would have encountered such ideas\nin the curriculum at Trinity College, but there is not much evidence\nthat he took them seriously. Instead, he focused on the\n\u201cmodern\u201d thinkers that enterprising young students were\ntold to read outside of the standard\n curriculum.[10]\n And in England in Newton\u2019s day, the greatest modern philosopher\nof nature was thought to be Descartes (Heilbron 1982: 30). There is\nsubstantial evidence that Newton took Descartes\u2019s ideas very\nseriously, and expended considerable energy thinking them through and\neventually coming to criticize them. Some of that evidence comes from\na manuscript that was first transcribed and published in 1962 by the\ngreat historians of science, Marie Boas Hall and A. Rupert Hall. The\nuntitled manuscript, now known as \u201cDe\nGravitatione\u201d after its first line, has been the subject of\nextensive discussions over the past fifty years because it indicates\nthe depth of Newton\u2019s interest in Cartesian ideas in metaphysics\nand natural philosophy. Despite its importance to contemporary\nunderstandings of Newton\u2019s relation to Cartesianism, and much\nelse besides, De Gravitatione is not without its problems.\nFirst and foremost, the manuscript lacks a date, and there is no\nscholarly consensus regarding its precise\n provenance.[11]\n Second, the manuscript was never finished, so it is difficult to\nassess its relationship with Newton\u2019s mature thinking in\nphilosophy. Finally, the manuscript was not published during\nNewton\u2019s lifetime, so there are questions about whether it\nrepresents his considered views. Despite these facts, the text\ncontains a treasure trove of arguments concerning Cartesian ideas. For\ninstance, it dispels the easily formed impression that Newton sought,\nin the Principia, to undermine a Leibnizian conception of\nspace and time, as his defender, Samuel Clarke, would attempt to do\nyears later in the correspondence of 1715\u201316 (discussed below).\nAlthough Leibniz did eventually express what became the canonical\nearly modern formulation of \u201crelationalism\u201d concerning\nspace and time\u2014the view, roughly, that space is nothing but the\norder of relations among physical objects, and time nothing over and\nabove the succession of events involving those objects\u2014and\nalthough Newton and Clarke were highly skeptical of such a view, it is\nmisleading to read the Principia through the lens provided by\nthe later controversy with the Leibnizians. Newton\u2019s extensive\nattempt in De Gravitatione to refute Descartes\u2019s\nconception of space and time in particular indicates that the Scholium\nshould be read as providing a replacement for the Cartesian\n conception.[12]\n That is, Newton had a Cartesian, and not a Leibnizian, opponent\nprimarily in mind when he wrote his famous articulation of\n\u201cabsolutism\u201d concerning space and time. Unlike questions\nabout Newton\u2019s methods and his apparent deviation from the norms\nestablished by mechanist philosophers like Descartes and Boyle,\nNewton\u2019s conception of space and time, along with his view of\nthe divine being, did not immediately engender a philosophical debate.\nIt was Leibniz more than any other philosopher who eventually\nsucceeded in fomenting a philosophical debate in which the\n\u201cNewtonian\u201d conception of space, time and the divine would\nplay a central role (see below). But Leibniz\u2019s philosophical\nviews were relatively unknown when Newton first formed his\nconception--to the young Newton writing the Principia,\nLeibniz was another mathematician and not yet a contributor to natural\nphilosophy. Instead, it was Descartes\u2019s view of space, the\nworld, and God, which he pondered in his youth and eventually came to\nreject.\n\nNewton took special interest in the Cartesian view of space and body,\nand in related views concerning the causal relations between minds and\nbodies and between God and the bodies that constitute the natural\nworld. Like many of Newton\u2019s contemporaries in Cambridge in\nthose days, he encountered these Cartesian views within the context of\nHenry More\u2019s then famous discussions of Cartesianism (a term\ncoined by More himself). Beginning with his correspondence with\nDescartes in 1648 (Lewis 1953), and continuing with a series of\npublications in later years, many of which Newton owned in his\npersonal library (Harrison 1978), More argued that Descartes made two\nfundamental mistakes: first, he wrongly contended that extension and\nmatter are identical (and that the world is therefore a plenum); and\nsecond, he mistakenly believed that God and the mind were not extended\nsubstances, which made their causal interactions with such substances\nmysterious. Just as Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia had raised\nfundamental objections to Cartesian dualism (see Shapiro 2007) in the\nearly 1640s, More raised similar objections against the Cartesian view\nof the divine a few years later (Lewis 1953). Descartes agreed with\nMore\u2019s suggestion that God can act anywhere on nature if he so\nchooses, and came very close to accepting More\u2019s contention that\nsuch a view entails that God must be present within the world wherever\nhe in fact chooses to act. For how could God part the Red Sea,\nsuggested More, unless God were present precisely where the Red Sea is\nlocated? Of course, More agreed that God is not made of parts, cannot\nbe imagined, and cannot be affected by the causal activity of material\nbodies\u2014the causal arrow flows only in one direction. But More\nconcluded that God is extended in his own way. If one fixes\nDescartes\u2019s two basic mistakes, one obtains what More regarded\nas a proper philosophical view: space is distinct from matter because\nit is extended but penetrable, whereas matter is extended but\nimpenetrable; and, in tandem, all substances are extended, but whereas\nsome, such as tables and chairs, are impenetrable, others, such as the\nmind and God, are penetrable and therefore not\n material.[13]\n Newton was deeply influenced both by More\u2019s criticisms of\nDescartes and by his positive philosophical conception of space and\nthe divine.\n\nIn a number of texts, including De Gravitatione, the famous\ndiscussion of space and time in the Scholium to the\nPrincipia, and the discussion of God in the General Scholium,\nNewton made his generally Morean attitudes perfectly clear. He\nrejected the Cartesian identification of extension and matter, arguing\nthat space itself exists independently of material objects (and their\nrelations), and he contended that all entities, including the human\nmind and even the divine being, are extended in the sense that they\nhave spatial location, even if they are extended in ways that\ndistinguish them from ordinary material\n bodies.[14]\n In Newton\u2019s hands, space becomes a fundamental concept of\nnatural philosophy, an attitude that is foreign to Cartesians. As\nNewton puts it in a famous passage from De Gravitatione:\n\n\nSpace is an affection of a being just as a being. No being exists or\ncan exist which is not related to space in some way. God is every\nwhere, created minds are somewhere, and body is in the space that it\noccupies; and whatever is neither everywhere nor anywhere does not\nexist. And hence it follows that space is an emanative effect of the\nfirst existing being, for if any being whatsoever is posited, space is\nposited. (Newton 2004: 25)\n\n\nSpace is a fundamental concept in part because Newton not only\nconceives of it as independent of objects and their relations, but\nbecause he argues that every entity must somehow connect with space in\nsome way. For Newton, then, if one follows the Cartesians and thinks\nof the mind, or of God, as existing without any spatial\nlocation\u2014as existing either \u201cbeyond\u201d the natural\nworld or somehow outside of it\u2014then that is equivalent to\nconceiving of them as non-existent. Newton does not shy away from\nmaking this conception of the divine explicit in his public writings,\ndespite the fact that it was anathema to his Cartesian and Leibnizian\ncontemporaries. In the General Scholium to the Principia,\nwhich was added to the second edition of the text in 1713, for\ninstance, he famously writes of God:\n\n\nHe endures always and is present everywhere, and by existing always\nand everywhere he constitutes duration and space. Since each and every\nparticle of space is always, and each and every indivisible\nmoment of duration is everywhere, certainly the maker and\nlord of all things will not be never or nowhere\n\u2026 God is one and the same God always and everywhere. He is\nomnipresent not only virtually but also\nsubstantially; for active power cannot subsist without\nsubstance. (Newton 1999: 941)\n\n\nFor Newton, just as bodies are present in some spatial location, God,\nan infinite being, is present throughout all of space throughout all\nof time. There could not be a clearer expression of agreement with\nMore in his debate with the Cartesians concerning the substantial\npresence of the divine within space.\n\nNewton also took issue with Cartesian ideas about motion. His\nrejection of Cartesian views of space, and his embrace of space as a\nfundamental concept in philosophy following More\u2019s influence,\naligns with his famous discussion of space and time in the Scholium\nthat follows the opening definitions in the Principia. This\ntext influenced nearly every subsequent philosophical discussion of\nspace and time for the next three centuries, so its contours are well\nknown (see DiSalle 2006: ch. 2). In his Principles of\nPhilosophy of 1644, Descartes had distinguished between the\n\u201cordinary\u201d and the \u201cproper\u201d view of motion:\nwhereas the ordinary view presents motion as a body\u2019s change of\nplace, the philosopher knows that properly speaking, motion is a\nbody\u2019s change of relations to the bodies that surround it\n(recall Descartes\u2019s plenum). Newton contends in De\nGravitatione that this idea of proper motion, according to which\nthe motion of a body is at least partially a function of its relations\nto other bodies, is in tension with Descartes\u2019s own laws of\nnature, also presented in the Principles. For according to\nthe conception of (what we now call) inertia that Descartes presents\nas his first two laws, a body moving rectilinearly will continue to do\nso unless caused to deviate from its path\u2014hence a body\u2019s\nmotion is not a function of its spatial relations to other bodies, but\nrather of its causal relations. That is, according to the\nfirst two laws, changing a body\u2019s spatial relations to others\nbodies will not alter its rectilinear motion unless a causal\ninteraction occurs. This tension runs deep in the Cartesian system.\nNewton\u2019s Scholium reflects his idea that the concept of motion\nin the Principia ought to cohere with the laws of motion he\nendorses. He distinguishes between absolute and relative motion, true\nand apparent motion, and mathematical and common motion (the same\ndistinctions hold for time, space and place). The former item in each\nof these three pairings is a concept that coheres with the laws of\nmotion. Newton\u2019s first law reflects Descartes\u2019s laws: it\nis a new version of the principle of inertia, one incorporating the\nconcept of an impressed force. Since this law indicates that a\nbody\u2019s motion is not a function of its spatial relations to\nother bodies, but rather of whether forces are impressed on\nit\u2014which replaces the Cartesian concept of causal interactions\nthat involve only impact (see below)\u2014Newton cannot rely on a\nbody\u2019s motion relative to other bodies if he is to avoid the\nkind of tension he found in the Cartesian view. Hence he indicates\nthat a body\u2019s true motion\u2014rather than its apparent motion,\nwhich depends on our perceptions, or its relative motion, which\ndepends on its spatial relations\u2014is a body\u2019s change of\nposition within space itself. That is, true motion should be\nunderstood as absolute motion. This means, in turn, that we must\ndistinguish between the common idea of space, according to which space\nis conceived of as involving relations among various objects (like the\nspace of our air), and the mathematical idea, one presumably obtained\nfrom geometrical reasoning, that space is independent of any objects\nor their relations. In order to account for the idea that true motion\nis absolute motion, then, the famous \u201cabsolute space\u201d is\npostulated.\n\nNewton was perfectly well aware that the notion of absolute space is\nnot\n unproblematic.[15]\n For instance, if a body\u2019s true motion just is its\nabsolute motion, its motion with respect to space itself, then the\nimperceptibility of space would appear to render any detection of true\nmotion difficult, if not hopeless. Indeed, how would we detect any\nbody\u2019s true motion on this view? We might be able to detect a\nbody\u2019s changing spatial relations with its neighbors, but not\nits changing relationship with space itself! Newton\u2019s solution\nto this problem is ingenious. Under certain circumstances, we can\ndetect a body\u2019s true motion by detecting its acceleration. We\ncan do so when the body is rotating or has a circular motion, for such\nmotions often have detectable effects. This is one way of\nunderstanding what has become one of the most famous, if not infamous,\nexperiments of the early modern period, Newton\u2019s bucket.\n(He grew up in part on a farm in the English countryside, and often\nused deceptively simple examples.) If one takes an ordinary bucket and\nfills it with water, and then attaches a rope to the top of the\nbucket, one can then twist the rope and let it go in order to make the\nbucket spin. When the bucket full of water spins around, we can detect\nthe water\u2019s acceleration by its changing surface. As Newton puts\nit, using his laws of motion, the water endeavors to recede from the\naxis of its motion (hence its changing surface). But even an observer\nuntutored in physics would grasp the importance of the water\u2019s\nchanging surface--that is, perceiving the effect does not depend on\nunderstanding the laws. In this way, despite the fact that Newton\nwishes to conceive of the water\u2019s true motion as its absolute\nmotion within space itself, which cannot be perceived, he shows his\nreaders how they might detect the water\u2019s true motion through\nits effects. Newton provides another simple experiment to illustrate a\nsimilar point. If two balls are joined together by a rope and then\nspun around, say over one\u2019s head, then the changing tension in\nthe rope will indicate that the balls are accelerated. Since any\nacceleration is a true motion\u2014although not all true motions are\naccelerations, since a so-called inertial motion is not\u2014this\ncase indicates that we can detect a body\u2019s true motion even\nthough space itself is imperceptible. In this way, Newton did not\nmerely develop an alternative to the Cartesian view of motion, along\nwith its allied conception of space; he presented a view that could be\nemployed to pick out some of the true motions of objects within\nnature. Once one has found a true motion, one can then ask what\ncaused that motion (for Newton, as we will see, it is forces\nthat are understood to cause motions). As the last line of the\nScholium in the Principia indicates, that is one reason that\nNewton wrote his magnum opus in the first place.\n\nNewton\u2019s idea of space, then, fulfilled at least two roles.\nFirst, it enabled him to avoid the tension between the concept of true\nmotion and the laws of motion of the kind found in Descartes. Second,\nit also enabled him to articulate what he took to be God\u2019s\nrelation to the natural world. Many regarded his achievements as an\nimportant advance over the Cartesian system. However, it would be a\nmistake to think that Newton vanquished Cartesian ideas within his\nlifetime: even in England, and certainly on the Continent,\nCartesianism remained a powerful philosophical force for several\ndecades after Newton published his primary\n works.[16]\n Typically, however, Descartes\u2019s followers emphasized the\nimportance of his ideas about the mechanisms that pervade nature\nrather than his views of space and time. In that arena, Newton\u2019s\nviews were especially prominent, and came in for significant criticism\nfrom Leibniz.\n4. Methodology II: the Principia\n\nMany legends concerning momentous events in history are apocryphal,\nbut the legend of Halley\u2019s visit to Newton in 1684 is not: it\nexplains what prompted Newton to write his magnum opus. In\nAugust of 1684, Edmond Halley\u2014for whom the comet is\nnamed\u2014came to visit Newton in Cambridge in order to discover his\nopinion about a subject of much dispute in celestial mechanics. At\nthis time, many in the Royal Society and elsewhere were at work on a\ncluster of problems that might be described as follows: how can one\ntake Kepler\u2019s Laws, which were then considered among the very\nbest descriptions of the planetary orbits, and understand them in the\ncontext of dynamical or causal principles? What kind of cause would\nlead to planetary orbits of the kind described by Kepler? In\nparticular, Halley asked Newton the following question: what kind of\ncurve would a planet describe in its orbit around the Sun if it were\nacted upon by an attractive force that was inversely proportional to\nthe square of its distance from the Sun? Newton immediately replied\nthat the curve would be an ellipse (rather than, say, a\n circle).[17]\n Halley was amazed that Newton had the answer at the ready. But Newton\nalso said that he had mislaid the paper on which the relevant\ncalculations had been made, so Halley left empty handed (whether there\nwas any such paper is a subject of dispute). But he would not be\ndisappointed for long. In November of that year, Newton sent Halley a\nnine-page paper, entitled De Motu (on motion), that presented\nthe sought-after demonstration, along with several other advances in\ncelestial mechanics. Halley was delighted, and immediately returned to\nCambridge for further discussion. It was these events that\nprecipitated the many drafts of De Motu that eventually\nbecame Principia mathematica by 1686. Several aspects of the\nPrincipia have been central to philosophical discussions\nsince its first publication, including Newton\u2019s novel\nmethodology in the book, his conception of space and time, and his\nattitude toward the dominant orientation within natural philosophy in\nhis day, the so-called mechanical philosophy, which had important\nmethodological consequences.\n\nWhen Newton wrote the Principia between 1684 and 1686, he was\nnot contributing to a preexisting field of study called mathematical\nphysics; he was attempting to show how philosophers could employ\nvarious mathematical and experimental methods in order to reach\nconclusions about nature, especially about the motions of material\nbodies (Janiak 2015, Chapter One). In his lectures presented as the\nLucasian Professor at Cambridge, Newton had been arguing since at\nleast 1670 that natural philosophers ought to employ geometrical\nmethods in order to understand various phenomena in\n nature.[18]\n The Principia represented his attempt to reorient natural\nphilosophy, taking it in a direction that neither his Aristotelian\npredecessors, nor his Cartesian contemporaries, had envisioned. He did\nnot immediately convince many of them of the benefits of his approach.\nJust as his first publication in optics in 1672 sparked an intense\ndebate about the proper methods for investigating the nature of\nlight\u2014and much else besides\u2014his Principia sparked\nan even longer lasting discussion about the methodology that\nphilosophers should adopt when studying the natural world. This\ndiscussion began immediately with the publication of the\nPrincipia, despite the fact that its first edition contained\nfew explicit methodological remarks (Smith 2002: 138\u201339). It\nintensified considerably with the publication of its second edition in\n1713, which contained many more remarks about methodology, including\nmany attempts at defending the Newtonian method. Indeed, many of\nNewton\u2019s alterations in that edition changed the presentation of\nhis methods. Discussions of methodology would eventually involve\nnearly all of the leading philosophers in England and on the Continent\nduring Newton\u2019s lifetime.\n\nIn Cartesian natural philosophy, all natural change is due to the\nimpacts that material bodies make upon one another\u2019s surfaces\n(this is reflected in Descartes\u2019s first two laws of nature). The\nconcept of a force plays little if any role. Unlike Descartes, Newton\nplaced the concept of a force at the very center of his thinking about\nmotion and its causes within nature. In that regard, his reactions to\nthe shortcomings of Cartesian natural philosophy parallel\nLeibniz\u2019s, who coined the term \u201cdynamics\u201d, and who\nobviously regarded force as a fundamental concept in metaphysics as\nwell (Westfall 1971). But Newton\u2019s attitude toward understanding\nthe forces of nature involved an especially intricate method that\ngenerated intense scrutiny and debate amongst many philosophers and\nmathematicians, including Leibniz (Garber 2012). Newton\u2019s\ncanonical notion of a force, which he calls a vis impressa or\n\u201cimpressed force\u201d, is the notion of an \u201caction\nexerted on a body\u201d that changes its state of motion. This was a\nconfusing notion at the time. Perhaps it is not difficult to see why\nthat should be so. To take one of Newton\u2019s own examples: suppose\nI hit a tennis ball with my racquet\u2014according to Newton, I have\nimpressed a force on the tennis ball, for I have changed its state of\nmotion (hopefully!). We have a reasonably good idea of what the tennis\nball is, of what the racquet is, and even of what I am, and a\nCartesian might wish to stop her analysis there. But what exactly is\nthis \u201cforce\u201d that I impressed on the tennis ball? The\nball, the racquet and I are physical things of one sort or another,\nbut is the force physical? Is it not physical? It does not seem likely\nthat a force is itself a physical thing in the sense of being a\nsubstance, to use a philosophical notion popular in Newton\u2019s day\n(as we saw above in his first optics paper). The reason is that in\nDefinition Four in the Principia, which defines an impressed\nforce for the first time, Newton remarks: \u201cThis force consists\nsolely in the action and does not remain in a body after the action\nhas ceased\u201d. So when I hit the tennis ball over the net, the\nforce I impressed on it was the action of hitting the ball, or an\naction associated with hitting the ball, and not a property of me or\nof the ball after the action had ceased. This idea confused many of\nNewton\u2019s readers. By the mid-eighteenth century, the time of\nHume\u2019s analysis of causation in the Treatise and the\nEnquiry, many philosophers started to think that actions and\nother kinds of event are important items to have in one\u2019s\nontology, and they often contended in particular that causal relations\nhold between events. But in Newton\u2019s day, philosophers\ntypically regarded objects or substances as the causal relata. Indeed,\none actually finds an equivocation between thinking of events and\nthinking of objects as the relevant causal relata even in Hume: in his\nEnquiry, he first defines a \u201ccause\u201d so that\n\u201cobjects\u201d are the causal relata, but then gives an example\nin which one of the relata is the vibration of a string\n(Enquiry, \u00a7VII, 51). So actions were difficult to\nanalyze, left out of analyses, or conflated with objects. As a result,\nNewton\u2019s conception of force proved confusing, even to his most\nsympathetic interpreters. Moreover, it was unclear to many of\nNewton\u2019s mechanist readers how his forces fit into their rather\naustere ontological view that material bodies consist solely of\nproperties such as size, shape, mobility and solidity.\n\nNewton did try to clarify his method of characterizing forces. If one\nbrackets the question of how to understand forces as ephemeral actions\nthat do not persist after causal interactions have ceased, one can\nmake progress by conceiving of forces as quantities. In\nparticular, since Newton\u2019s eight definitions and three laws\nindicate that forces are proportional to mass and to acceleration, and\nsince mass\u2014or the quantity of matter, a concept Newton\ntransformed from its Cartesian origins, where it was understood as a\nmeasure of a body\u2019s volume\u2014and acceleration are both\nquantities that can be measured, Newton gives us a means of measuring\nforces. This is crucial to his method. If one thinks of forces as\nmeasurable quantities, moreover, then one can attempt to identify two\nseemingly disparate forces as in fact the same force through thinking\nabout measuring them. For instance, in Book III of the\nPrincipia, Newton famously argues in proposition five and its\nscholium that the centripetal force maintaining the planetary orbits\nis in fact the same as the force of gravity, viz., the force that\ncauses the free fall of objects on earth. This was a revolutionary\nidea at the time, one rendered possible in the first place by\nNewton\u2019s way of thinking about forces as quantities. This idea\nthen led Newton to the even more revolutionary view in proposition\nseven of Book III that all bodies gravitate toward one another in\nproportion to their quantity of matter. That is, it led him to the\nidea of universal gravity, a view that shocked many of his Continental\nreaders in its boldness. This helped to unify what were once called\nsuperlunary and sublunary phenomena, a unification that was obviously\ncrucial for later research in physics. The idea was enabled by\nNewton\u2019s abstract way of understanding forces\u2014without\nconceiving of a force as involving any specific mechanism or type of\nphysical interaction, Newton thought of forces as quantities that are\nproportional to other features of nature.\n\nDespite his evident success in obtaining what we now call the law of\nuniversal gravitation, Newton admits that he lacks another kind of\nknowledge about gravity; this lack of knowledge directly reflects an\naspect of his abstract characterization of forces. In the General\nScholium, he reminds his readers that gravity is proportional to a\nbody\u2019s quantity of matter (its mass) and reaches across vast\ndistances within our solar system, adding: \u201cI have not as yet\nbeen able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of\ngravity, and I do not feign\n hypotheses\u201d.[19]\n With this phrase, one of the most famous in all of Newton\u2019s\nwritings, he returned to a key theme of his very first optical paper\nfrom forty years earlier, viz. the proper role of hypotheses and of\nhypothetical reasoning within natural\n philosophy.[20]\n Some of Newton\u2019s interpreters have regarded this phrase as\nsignaling a strong commitment to the broad doctrine that all\nhypotheses concerning natural phenomena ought to be avoided in\nprinciple. This interpretation is sometimes coupled with the view that\nsome British philosophers in the late seventeenth century regarded\nCartesianism as overly reliant on hypotheses in reaching conclusions\nabout phenomena. But this interpretation may be hard to square with\nNewton\u2019s texts. For instance, in the Scholium to Proposition 96\nof Book I of the Principia, Newton discusses hypotheses\nconcerning light rays. Similarly, in query 21 of the Opticks,\nhe proposes that there might be an aether whose differential density\naccounts for the gravitational force acting between bodies. In light\nof such examples, one can read the General Scholium\u2019s\npronouncement in this way: a philosopher concerned with explaining\nsome feature of nature\u2014such as the fact that gravity is\ninversely proportional to the square of spatial separation,\nrather than, say, the cube\u2014may legitimately entertain\nand propose hypotheses for consideration, but she may not\n\u201cfeign\u201d the hypothesis in the sense of taking it as having\nbeen established either through experiment, observation, or some form\nof reasoning (including mathematical reasoning). Hence Newton thinks\nthat he has established the fact that gravity acts on all material\nbodies in proportion to their quantity of matter, but he has\nnot established the existence of the aether. What, then, does\nNewton\u2019s slogan hypotheses non fingo actually rule out?\nBy the time of the General Scholium, Newton was increasingly embroiled\nin philosophical disputes with Leibniz. After reading the copy of the\nPrincipia that Newton had sent him, Leibniz wrote an essay\n(\u201cTentamen\u201d) on the causes of planetary motion for the\nfamous journal Acta Eruditorum. In order to account for the\nmotions of the planetary bodies in his Tentamen, published in\n1689, Leibniz introduces ex hypothesi the premise that some\nkind of fluid surrounds, and is contiguous to, the various planetary\nbodies, and then argues that this fluid must be in motion to account\nfor their\n orbits.[21]\n Newton may have argued that Leibniz had \u201cfeigned\u201d the\nhypothesis of the vortices. That is, he would have objected to\nLeibniz\u2019s conclusion that there must be vortices in the solar\nsystem (as opposed to the suggestion, for instance, that we try to\ndetect their presence through observations of things like comets). A\ndebate between the two philosophers on this score would bring them to\nthe question of the mechanical philosophy: whereas Newton would object\nto Leibniz\u2019s reasoning on methodological grounds, Leibniz would\nreply that Newton\u2019s theory of gravity involves action at a\ndistance, which his vortex hypothesis avoids (see below for more\ndetails).\n\nOnce the Principia was published, Newton had a vexed\nrelationship with the mechanical philosophy, an orientation within\nnatural philosophy that is associated with nearly every significant\nearly modern philosopher, including Descartes, Boyle, Huygens,\nLeibniz, and\n Locke.[22]\n One of the reasons for this complex relationship can be understood if\nwe consider Newton\u2019s attitude toward forces in an abstract way.\nHis second law indicates that a body moving rectilinearly will\ncontinue to do so unless a force is impressed on it. This is not\nequivalent to claiming that a body moving rectilinearly will continue\nto do so unless another body impacts upon it. A vis\nimpressa\u2014an impressed force\u2014in Newton\u2019s system\nis not the same as a body, nor even a quality of a body, as we have\nseen; but what is more, some impressed forces need not involve contact\nbetween bodies at all. For instance, gravity is a kind of centripetal\nforce, and the latter, in turn, is a species of impressed force. Hence\na body moving in a straight line will continue to do so until it\nexperiences a gravitational pull, in which case it will deviate from a\nstraight line motion, even if no body impacts upon it. Indeed, the\ngravitational pull might originate with a mass that is millions of\nmiles away. As we have seen, an impressed force is an action exerted\non a body. Hence the gravity exerted on a moving body is an action\n(the Latin term is actio), which is obviously a causal\nnotion. This is not an empirical claim per se; it is merely a\nreflection of Newton\u2019s laws, together with his notion of an\nimpressed force, and his further idea that gravity is one kind of\nimpressed force. These elements of the Principia make\nconceptual room for a causal interaction between two bodies separated\nby a vast distance, one enabled by Newton\u2019s concept of an\nimpressed force. Aspects of this idea became known in philosophical\ncircles as the problem of action at a distance (Hesse 1961). Many of\nNewton\u2019s most influential contemporaries objected vigorously to\nthe fact that his philosophy had made room for\u2014if not explicitly\ndefended\u2014the possibility of distant action between material\nbodies. Leibniz and Huygens in particular rejected this aspect of\nNewton\u2019s work in the strongest terms, and it remained a point of\ncontention between Newton and Leibniz for the rest of their lives.\nBoth Leibniz and Huygens were convinced that all natural change occurs\nthrough contact action, and that any deviation from this basic\nmechanist principle within natural philosophy would lead to serious\ndifficulties, including the revival of outmoded Aristotelian ideas. By\nthe seventh proposition of Book III of the Principia, as we\nhave seen, Newton reached the following conclusion (1999: 810):\n\u201cGravity acts on all bodies universally and is proportional to\nthe quantity of matter in each\u201d. Leibniz eventually accused\nNewton of regarding gravity as a kind of \u201coccult quality\u201d,\nthat is, as a quality of bodies that is somehow hidden within them and\nbeyond the philosopher\u2019s understanding. They understood Newton\nto be saying that gravity is a kind of hidden power to attract\nembedded in material bodies.\n\nNewton was well aware that the Principia\u2019s methodology\nof discovering the forces present in nature was controversial, and not\nmerely because of questions about action at a distance. So when he\nrevised the text, under the editorship of Roger Cotes, for publication\nin a second edition in 1713, he added other methodological remarks.\nThese remarks included what Newton called \u201cregulae\nphilosophandi\u201d, or rules of philosophy, which became the\nfocal point of vigorous discussion and debate well into the eighteenth\ncentury. The first two rules concern causal reasoning, but it is the\nthird rule that generated the most debate, for it involved both an\naspect of Newton\u2019s controversial argument for universal gravity\nand also a rare public statement by Newton of what he regarded as the\n\u201cfoundation\u201d of natural philosophy. The third rule\nconcerns an induction problem: we have perceptions and experiments\nthat provide us with knowledge of the objects and natural phenomena in\nour neck of the universe, but on what basis can we reach a conclusion\nconcerning objects and phenomena throughout the rest of the\nuniverse? Newton himself reached such a conclusion about gravity in\nproposition seven of Book III of the Principia. Part of\nNewton\u2019s answer is presented in rule 3:\n\n\nThose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [i.e.,\nincreased and diminished] and that belong to all bodies on which\nexperiments can be made should be taken as qualities of all bodies\nuniversally.\n\n\nWe know, say, that a clump of dirt has certain qualities such as\nextension and mobility, but how do we know that the entire earth has\nsuch qualities? It surely lies beyond the reach of our experiments, or\nat any rate, it did in Newton\u2019s day. Newton says that the sun\nand the earth interact according to his law of gravity, but how do we\nknow that the sun contains a quantity of matter, that it is a material\nbody with the same basic qualities that characterize the earth or the\nmoon? It wasn\u2019t at all obvious at the time that the sun is a\nmaterial body at all. Newton thinks that gravity reaches into the very\ncenter of the sun, but what did anyone in 1713 know about such things?\nNewton glosses his third rule in part as follows, connecting it with\nhis laws of motion:\n\n\nThat all bodies are movable and persevere in motion or in rest by\nmeans of certain forces (which we call forces of inertia) we infer\nfrom finding these properties in the bodies that we have seen. The\nextension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and force of\n inertia[23]\n of the whole arise from the extension, hardness, impenetrability,\nmobility and force of inertia of each of the parts; and thus we\nconclude that every one of the least parts of all bodies is extended,\nhard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with a force of inertia. And\nthis is the foundation of all natural philosophy. (Newton 1999:\n795\u201396)\n\n\nMany of Newton\u2019s readers in 1713 would have granted him the\nfollowing inference: although we do not have any perceptions of, say,\nthe interior of the earth, or even of many ordinary objects within our\ngrasp, we can reasonably infer that everything with certain basic\nproperties\u2014something akin to what John Locke, borrowing a term\nof Robert Boyle\u2019s, called the \u201cprimary\nqualities\u201d\u2014at the macroscopic level is comprised of\nmicro-particles that are characterized by those same basic properties.\nBut at the end of his gloss of Rule 3, Newton applies this same (or\nanalogous) reasoning to the force of gravity, arguing as follows:\nsince we experience the fact that all bodies on or near the earth\ngravitate toward the earth\u2014in cases such as free fall\u2014and\nthat the moon gravitates toward the earth, etc., we can infer that all\nbodies everywhere gravitate toward all other bodies. This argument\nwould appear to suggest that gravity\u2014which, as we have seen, is\na kind of impressed force, an action\u2014is somehow akin to\nqualities like extension and impenetrability. So is Newton suggesting\nthat gravity is actually a quality of all bodies? He did not\nexplicitly endorse that claim, but Cotes did in a famous passage in\nhis editor\u2019s preface (Newton 1999, 391-92). Many understood\nCotes to be speaking for Newton, just as they interpreted Clarke a few\nyears later. Leibniz and his followers pounced: if Newton regards\ngravity as a quality, as a power of attraction, then he had indeed\nrevived the occult qualities of the Scholastics, for here we have a\nquality that is not explicable in mechanical terms. Unlike the usual\nproperties of extension, impenetrability and mobility discussed by\nCotes, gravity seemed like a hidden power. This topic became the\nsubject of intense debate throughout the first half of the eighteenth\ncentury (see the last section below).\n5. The aftermath of the Principia I: relations with John Locke and Richard Bentley\n\nAlthough the first editions of Newton\u2019s Principia and\nof Locke\u2019s Essay were published a mere three years\napart (in 1687 and 1690, respectively) their authors worked\nindependently and did not influence the first editions of one\nanother\u2019s principal texts. But then in 1688, Locke wrote a\nsympathetic (anonymous) review of the Principia. And right\naround the time of the publication of the first edition of the\nEssay, Newton and Locke became close friends and apparently\ninfluenced each other\u2019s thinking about philosophy, religion, and\ntheology in various ways (they first met in London in 1689). For his\npart, Locke called him the \u201cincomparable Mr. Newton\u201d on\nseveral occasions (e.g., in correspondence: Locke 1823: vol. 4: 55;\nand the next long quotation below). Most historians think that each\nquestioned the standard Anglican interpretation of the Trinity,\ncontending that Jesus of Nazareth was not a divine figure on the same\nlevel as God the creator. Interpreting the Bible through historical\nand philosophical analysis in a fashion that was not constrained by\nstandard Anglican doctrine in the late seventeenth century was\nfantastically important to Newton, occupying his attention for many\nyears. Given their controversial and politically sensitive nature, his\nso-called anti-Trinitarian views were largely kept secret among a\nsmall circle of friends. However, Newton trusted Locke enough to send\nhim a very long letter\u2014entitled \u201cTwo Notable Corruptions\nof Scripture\u201d\u2014to present him with the evidence for\nNewton\u2019s view that the original version of Christianity was\ncorrupted beginning in the 4th century by the introduction\nof the doctrine of the Trinity (Newton 1959\u2013, vol. 3:\n83\u2013129). Locke was apparently sympathetic with Newton\u2019s\napproach. With respect to their public views, Newton and Locke were\noften taken to represent two aspects of the same\nexperimental-philosophical approach toward the close of the\nseventeenth century (Stein 1990; Wilson 1999: 196\u2013214; and\nDomski 2012). It is perhaps not difficult to understand why, for\nNewton was mentioned in one of the most famous passages in all of\nLocke\u2019s writings. In the Epistle to the reader of Locke\u2019s\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding, we read:\n\n\nThe Commonwealth of Learning, is not at this time without\nMaster-Builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity; but every one\nmust not hope to be a Boyle, or a Sydenham; and in an age that\nproduces such masters, as the great Huygenius, and the incomparable\nMr. Newton, with some other of that strain; \u2019tis ambition enough\nto be employed as an under-labourer in clearing ground a little, and\nremoving some of the rubbish, that lies in the way to knowledge; which\ncertainly had been very much more advanced in the world, if the\nendeavors of ingenious and industrious men had not been much cumbred\nwith the learned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected, or\nunintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made an\nart of, to that degree, that philosophy, which is nothing but the true\nknowledge of things, was thought unfit, or uncapable to be brought\ninto well-bred company, and polite conversation. (Locke 1975: 10)\n\n\nClearly, Locke seeks in this passage, among other things, to align his\nwork in the Essay with the work of figures such as Newton.\nHere we find, at the opening of Locke\u2019s magnum opus, the\nsuggestion that he is content to be an \u201cunder-labourer\u201d, a\nthinker who helps to clear the way for the advance of knowledge. But\nhis list of four \u201cmaster builders\u201d\u2014Boyle, Sydenham,\nHuygens, and Newton\u2014might strike us as an odd pairing: what do\nthese four have in common exactly? It has recently been argued that\nLocke regarded the four as representing the new \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d, and that Locke himself should be interpreted as\nstrongly supporting that orientation within natural philosophy more\ngenerally (Anstey 2011: 220). This would become a popular conception\nof Newton\u2019s philosophical approach, one that played a\nsubstantial role in the Enlightenment.\n\nLocke may have regarded Newton as a fellow enthusiast for the\nexperimental philosophy, but there are reasons to think that his\nembrace of the mechanical philosophy presented him with a difficulty\nin interpreting the consequences of Newton\u2019s theory of universal\ngravity in the Principia. For Newton\u2019s theory seemed to\nbe in tension with a mechanist constraint on views of causation, at\nleast from Locke\u2019s own point of view. In the first edition of\nthe Essay, Locke articulated a central tenet of mechanist\nthinking about causation when he wrote: \u201cbodies operate by\nimpulse and nothing else\u201d (Essay, II.viii.11). Impulse\nrefers here to contact action. In correspondence with Locke that would\nprove to be influential, Bishop Edward Stillingfleet questioned this\nview from the Essay, contending that Locke must jettison the\nidea of human liberty if he insists that bodies can operate solely by\nimpulse, presumably on the grounds that the human will cannot be\nunderstood to cause bodily action in that manner. In a famous\nexchange, Locke responded in part by reformulating his commitment to\nthe mechanist view that all causation involving material bodies must\nbe by contact (impulse) alone:\n\n\nIt is true, I say, that \u2018bodies operate by impulse and nothing\nelse\u2019. And so I thought when I writ it, and can yet conceive no\nother way of their operation. But I am since convinced by the\njudicious Mr. Newton\u2019s incomparable book, that it is too bold a\npresumption to limit God\u2019s power, in this point, by my narrow\nconceptions. The gravitation of matter toward matter by ways\ninconceivable to me, is not only a demonstration that God can, if he\npleases, put into bodies, powers and ways of operations, above what\ncan be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we\nknow of matter, but also an unquestionable and every where visible\ninstance, that he has done so. And therefore in the next edition of my\nbook, I shall take care to have that passage rectified. (Locke 1823:\nvol. 4: 467\u20138).\n\n\nThis was not merely his privately held view. For instance, near the\nbeginning of his Elements of Natural Philosophy, Locke\nwrites:\n\n\nTwo bodies at a distance will put one another into motion by the force\nof attraction; which is inexplicable by us, though made evident to us\nby experience, and so to be taken as a principle in natural\nphilosophy. (Locke 1823: vol. 3: 305)\n\n\nIn this way, Locke held the common view that Newton\u2019s theory of\nuniversal gravity was incompatible with the mechanical\nphilosophy\u2014and perhaps, unintelligible to us for that very\nreason\u2014and when forced to choose between these two options, he\nevidently sided with Newton, thinking that his theory was supported by\n\u201cexperience\u201d. He did so by endorsing the view that God\nmust have added \u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cways of\noperations\u201d to material bodies that cannot be derived from our\nidea of body. Such powers or ways of operations would in this case\nresult in gravitational interactions, presumably amongst bodies that\nare spatially separated from one another by great distances. Yet from\nLocke\u2019s point of view, the fact that Newton\u2019s theory\nconvinces him that such powers exist does not entail that\nthat theory renders gravity \u201cconceivable\u201d: even if the\ntheory of universal gravity is correct, it does not allow us to\nunderstand how matter\u2014what Locke would call \u201cextended\nsolid substance\u201d\u2014can interact gravitationally with other\nmatter when the bits of matter are not in contact with one another\n(Downing 1997). So Locke has concluded that bodies can operate on one\nanother through some means other than impulse, but he retains his\nfirmly held belief that any such operation is not intelligible to us.\nLocke accepted the conclusion that spatially separated bodies causally\ninteract with one another in accordance with the law of universal\ngravitation, but concluded that the law itself did not render that\ncausal interaction intelligible. This is precisely the kind of\nreaction to Newton\u2019s theory of universal gravity bemoaned by\nLeibniz, who would argue that any operations or powers attributed to\nmaterial bodies must meet the basic criterion of intelligibility\nestablished by the mechanist approach; he might also be inclined to\nargue that any laws regarded as governing the interactions of bodies\nmust also meet that criterion by being derivable in some way from our\nbasic concept of matter (see below). Regardless, this is an excellent\nexample of a case in which Newton\u2019s theory in the\nPrincipia had a direct impact on the development of\nphilosophical views of causation in the late seventeenth century.\n\nWhen the great English natural philosopher Robert Boyle died at the\nend of 1691, he endowed a lecture series designed to promote\nChristianity against what Boyle took to be the atheism that had\ninfected English culture after the revolutionary period of the\nmid-century. Famous Newtonians such as Samuel Clarke and William\nWhiston would eventually give the Boyle lectures. The first\n\u201cBoyle lecturer\u201d was the theologian Richard Bentley, who\nwould eventually become the Master of Newton\u2019s alma\nmater, Trinity College, Cambridge, and who also worked under\nLocke\u2019s correspondent, Bishop Stillingfleet, himself an admirer\nof Newton\u2019s (Gascoigne 1985: 65). When preparing his lectures\nfor publication\u2014they had been presented to a public audience in\nLondon in 1692\u2014Bentley conferred with Newton, hoping to solicit\nhis help in deciphering enough of the Principia to use its\nresults as a bulwark against atheism (Bentley 1976). Newton obliged,\nand a famous correspondence between the two began (eventually\npublished as Bentley 1756). The exchange is of great philosophical\ninterest, for Bentley elicited a number of important clarifications\nthat have no peer within Newton\u2019s published oeuvre.\n\nBentley sought Newton\u2019s assistance in particular because he\nwanted guidance in divining how the theory of the Principia\nindicates that the solar system must have been designed by an\nintelligent agent and could not have arisen through the physical\ninteractions of material bodies. In the first edition of the\nPrincipia in 1687, Newton had made such a claim in a very\nbrief statement (Newton 1972: vol. 2: 582\u20133; Cohen 1971:\n154\u20136). In the second edition of the text (published in 1713),\nhe removed that statement, replacing it with a more extensive\ndiscussion in the new section of the text, added to its end, called\nthe \u201cGeneral Scholium\u201d (mentioned above). Through their\ncorrespondence, Bentley learned that from Newton\u2019s point of\nview, the positions of the planets relative to one another\u2014and\nespecially to the sun\u2014indicate that mere chance, or the ordinary\nphysical interactions of the planetary bodies, could not have placed\neach planet in precisely the right orbit to maintain a solar system\nlike ours for an extended period of time. With this argument, Newton\nseems to be indicating that mere chance would have produced an\nunstable planetary system, one in which the planets would eventually\neither be too strongly attracted to the sun, falling into it, or too\nweakly attracted, flying off into space. In this episode, a theologian\nappeals to the new authority of Newtonian natural philosophy when\nattempting to undermine atheism. And that was apparently the very kind\nof interchange that Boyle had envisioned when endowing the lecture\nseries.\n\nNewton\u2019s correspondence with Bentley is justly famous for\nanother reason. The criticisms of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity by\nLeibniz and Huygens, outlined briefly above, would prove essential to\nthe Continental reception of Newtonian natural philosophy more\ngenerally in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\nSince Newton held both of these mathematicians in high regard\u2014he\ntells Leibniz in a 1693 letter that \u201cHuygens is a master, and\nhis remarks on my discoveries are brilliant\u201d (Newton 2004:\n108)\u2014one might assume that their criticisms would have pressed\nNewton into articulating an extensive defense of the possibility of\naction at a distance. However, Newton presented no such defense, at\nleast not explicitly. In fact, there is evidence that Newton himself\nmay have rejected the possibility of action at a distance, despite the\nfact that the Principia allows it as a conceptual\npossibility, if not an empirical reality. The evidence lies in\nNewton\u2019s correspondence with Bentley. In February of 1693, after\nreceiving three letters from Newton, Bentley wrote an extensive reply\nthat attempted to characterize Newton\u2019s theory of gravity, along\nwith his understanding of the nature of matter, in a way that could be\nused to undermine various kinds of atheism. With the three earlier\nletters as his guide, Bentley makes the following estimation of\nNewton\u2019s understanding of the possibility that gravity could\nsomehow be an essential feature of material bodies:\n\n\n(2) And as for Gravitation, tis impossible that That should either be\nco\u00e6ternal & essential to Matter, or ever acquired by it. Not\nessential and co\u00e6ternal to Matter; for then even our System\nwould have been eternal (if gravity could form it) against our\nAtheist\u2019s supposition & what we have proved in our Last. For\nlet them assign any given time, that Matter convened from a Chaos into\nour System, they must affirm that before the given time matter\ngravitated eternally without convening, which is absurd. {Sir, I make\naccount, that your courteous suggestion by your Last, that a Chaos is\ninconsistent with the Hypothesis of innate Gravity, is included in\nthis paragraph of Mine.} and again, tis unconceivable, that inanimate\nbrute matter should (without a divine impression) operate upon &\naffect other matter without mutual contact: as it must, if gravitation\nbe essential and inherent in it. (Newton 1959\u2013vol. 3: 249)\n\n\nIn reply to this letter, Newton refers back to this second\nproposition, making one of the most famous of all his pronouncements\nconcerning the possibility of action at a distance:\n\n\nThe last clause of the second position I like very well. It is\ninconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the\nmediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and\naffect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if\ngravitation in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it.\nAnd this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate\ngravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential\nto matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through\na vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which\ntheir action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me\nso great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical\nmatters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity\nmust be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain\nlaws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left\nopen to the consideration of my readers. (Newton 2004:\n 102\u20133)[24]\n\n\nIt certainly seems that Newton was uncomfortable with the very idea of\naction at a distance. But of course, things are not always as they\nseem in interpretations of difficult philosophical texts: some\nhistorians and philosophers have argued strongly that there are other\nreadings of the\n letter.[25]\n Rather than rejecting distant action between material bodies per\nse, they argue, Newton may have been rejecting a particular\nversion of that idea, one associated with the \u201cEpicurean\u201d\nview that gravity is somehow an essential feature of all material\nbodies, a stronger view than Newton might wish to endorse. The idea\nmight be roughly as follows: Newton wanted to leave open the\npossibility that God had endowed bodies with a power to act at a\ndistance on one another, a position that is at least reminiscent of\nLocke\u2019s view in his correspondence with Stillingfleet (see\nabove). The reason is that Newton held the standard view at the time\nthat matter itself is passive, requiring some kind of divine\nintervention in order to interact causally with other matter. Again,\none finds a Lockean echo of this idea (which may be no accident):\nLocke sometimes suggests that matter itself is passive in the sense\nthat it cannot move itself; instead, motion must be\n\u201csuperadded\u201d to it by God. If the world consisted solely\nof a bunch of material objects, say rocks floating in interstellar\nspace, then they would not experience any changes in their states of\nmotion unless some external force acted upon them. Left to its own\ndevices, matter is passive and does not move. To argue, as some\n\u201cEpicurean\u201d philosophers may have done, that matter itself\nessentially contains gravity as a feature, is to deny that matter is\npassive; it is to suggest that the rocks in interstellar space would\nattract one another and begin to move \u201con their own\u201d,\nwithout any external force influencing them. And this, in turn, might\nlead us on a slippery slope to atheism, for on this view, matter would\nact on its own, without any divine intervention. Or so Bentley and\nNewton might be interpreted.\n\nClearly, one reasonable motive for uncovering a nuanced interpretation\nof Newton\u2019s letter to Bentley is the obvious fact that Newton\napparently regarded action at a distance as perfectly possible when\nwriting the Principia. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile\nthe Principia with the Bentley correspondence. One can argue\nthat although he left open the possibility of action at a distance in\nhis main work, Newton himself did not accept that possibility because\nof his more general commitments. The debate on such matters continues\nunabated. However, regardless of Newton\u2019s personal attitude\ntoward distant action among material bodies, his mechanist\ninterlocutors and readers continued to object to the physical theory\noutlined in Book III of the Principia on the grounds that, at\nthe very least, it left open the conceptual possibility of a kind of\naction that cannot in fact exist anywhere in nature. That remained one\nof Leibniz\u2019s principal objections against Newtonian natural\nphilosophy throughout the last twenty years of his life, animating his\ncorrespondence with numerous figures, including most prominently the\nNewtonian theologian and philosopher Samuel Clarke.\n6. The aftermath of the Principia II: debates with Leibniz\n\nIn many ways, Leibniz and Newton grew up in the same philosophical\nenvironment. Each came of age during the heyday of Cartesianism, and\neach argued in particular that Cartesian views in natural philosophy\nfailed to include a sufficiently robust conception of the forces of\nbodies in nature. Force would lie at the center of Newton\u2019s\nmature physics (Westfall 1971), and would become even more central to\nLeibniz\u2019s thinking, playing an essential role in his metaphysics\nas well (Garber 2012). Indeed, in Leibniz\u2019s criticisms of\nCartesian physics involving what was later called the vis viva\ncontroversy (Smith 2006) and in Newton\u2019s mature physics,\neach argued that Descartes and his followers had failed to understand\nthe importance of the notion of force. Leibniz and Newton knew one\nanother as mathematicians already in the 1670s, and as we have seen,\nLeibniz discussed Newton\u2019s first optical work with Huygens. But\nafter the publication of the Principia in 1687, their\nphilosophical relationship, which was marked originally by respectful\ndisagreement, began to develop in earnest. Just two years after the\nPrincipia appeared, Leibniz published his Essay on the\nCauses of Celestial Motions (or Tentamen), and then in\n1693, the two corresponded with one another on mathematical and\nphilosophical issues (Newton 2004: 106\u20139). Leibniz initiated\ntheir discussion in March of 1693: after highlighting Newton\u2019s\n\u201castonishing discovery\u201d that the elliptical planetary\norbits found by Kepler can be the result of gravitational attraction\nwithin the solar system, Leibniz contends that these motions must be\ncaused by \u201cthe motion of a fluid medium\u201d (Newton 2004:\n106). He had described such a fluid medium, or vortex, in detail in\nhis own Essay. The background to Leibniz\u2019s comment is\nhis unwavering commitment\u2014one shared by Huygens, whose theory of\ngravity\u2019s cause Leibniz mentions in the same letter\u2014to the\nmechanist requirement that all changes in motion must be the result of\nmaterial impact. Thus for Leibniz, one can (e.g.) speak of the sun as\nattracting the earth as a fa\u00e7on de parler, but in fact\nthe cause of the earth\u2019s acceleration, of its true motion around\nthe sun, is its interaction with a fluid medium. (Descartes was also a\nfamous proponent of a vortex theory of planetary motion\u2014Aiton\n1972: 30\u201364; Gaukroger 2002: 150\u20133.) When he replied in\nOctober of 1693, however, Newton did not accept Leibniz\u2019s\nphilosophical olive branch. Leibniz had insisted that the vortex\ntheory of planetary motion \u201cwould not at all detract from the\nvalue and truth of your discovery\u201d that Kepler\u2019s ellipses\nresult simply from the conception of attraction or gravitation (Newton\n2004: 107). This olive branch was important because earlier vortex\ntheorists, especially Descartes, had failed to account for\nKepler\u2019s laws, so Leibniz was crediting Newton with advancing\nastronomy in this respect (and indeed, he attempted to reflect\nKepler\u2019s results in his Tentamen). But Newton brushed\naside the olive branch, noting that vortices would disturb the motions\nof planets and comets through the solar system. He writes that some\n\u201cvery fine\u201d matter fills the heavens, adding:\n\n\nFor since celestial motions are more regular than if they arose from\nvortices and observe other laws, so much so that vortices contribute\nnot to the regulation but the disturbance of the motions of planets\nand comets; and since all phenomena of the heavens and of the sea\nfollow precisely, so far as I am aware, from nothing but gravity\nacting in accordance with the laws described by me; and since nature\nis very simple, I have myself concluded that all other causes are to\nbe rejected and that the heavens are to be stripped as far as may be\nof all matter, lest the motions of planets and comets be hindered or\nrendered irregular. But if, meanwhile, someone explains gravity along\nwith all its laws by the action of some subtle matter, and shows that\nthe motion of planets and comets will not be disturbed by this matter,\nI shall be far from objecting. (Newton 2004: 108\u20139)\n\n\nThis is a passage rich with meaning. Leibniz clearly insisted that\nvortices, or some physical object or fluid, must be in contact with\nthe planetary orbits if we are to explain why they deviate from the\ntangents along the orbital paths when circling the sun. Newton\u2019s\nreply is that giant swirling fluids in the heavens would actually\ndisturb the regular orbital paths and the paths of comets through the\nsolar system. That reply might be thought of as empirical in\ncharacter, for it depends on observational data regarding the actual\npaths of the heavenly bodies. But Leibinz\u2019s perspective is\nobviously not merely empirical in character: he does not postulate\nvortices (or anything akin to them) on observational grounds; he\ninfers their existence because he thinks we know (perhaps we can add,\nwe know a priori) that physical bodies such as comets or\nplanets can deviate from a rectilinear path\u2014they can\naccelerate\u2014only if some other physical item impacts upon them.\nNewton has a reply to that kind of view as well: he insists that the\nphenomena of the motion of the heavenly bodies \u201cfollows\u201d\nsolely from gravity itself\u2014an impressed force, as we have seen,\nand therefore an \u201caction\u201d\u2014in accordance with the\nlaws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Since gravity is\nan action\u2014clearly, a causal notion\u2014it seems clear that\nNewton\u2019s answer to Leibniz\u2019s idea that vortices cause the\nplanetary orbits is that gravity itself causes them. It is not much of\na leap to conclude, in turn, that this reply commits Newton to the\nidea that bodies involved in gravitational interactions, such as the\nsun and the earth, act at a distance on one another through the force\nof gravity. It is not hard to divine why Leibniz (and Huygens) would\nhave concluded that Newton had relinquished any commitment to the\nnorms of the mechanical philosophy.\n\nDespite Leibniz\u2019s (and Huygens\u2019s) criticisms of his theory\nof gravity in particular, and his methods in natural philosophy in\ngeneral, Newton stuck to his guns. Nearly twenty years after their\nilluminating exchange in 1693, Leibniz and Newton narrowly missed a\nsecond opportunity to discuss their philosophical differences\ndirectly. In May of 1712, Leibniz published a letter to Nicholas\nHartsoeker that was highly critical of the Newtonians; it was\npublished in English translation in the Memoirs of\nLiterature, a journal to which Roger Cotes, the editor of the\nPrincipia\u2019s second edition, held a subscription (Newton\n2004: 109). After Cotes brought Leibniz\u2019s criticisms to\nNewton\u2019s attention\u2014especially the claim that the\nPrincipia renders gravitation a \u201cperpetual\nmiracle\u201d because it does not specify the physical mechanism\nunderlying it\u2014Newton wrote an intriguing, but only posthumously\npublished, rebuttal. Here is part of Newton\u2019s paraphrase of\nLeibniz\u2019s original letter:\n\n\nBut he [i.e., Leibniz] goes on and tells us that God could not create\nplanets that should move round of themselves without any cause that\nshould prevent their removing through the tangent. For a miracle at\nleast must keep the planet in. (Newton 2004: 117)\n\n\nNewton\u2019s response to this Leibnizian charge is illuminating:\n\n\nBut certainly God could create planets that should move round of\nthemselves without any other cause than gravity that should prevent\ntheir removing through the tangent. For gravity without a miracle may\nkeep the planets in. (ibid.)\n\n\nThus Newton repeats the view he mentions to Leibniz in 1693, viz.,\nthat the force of gravity itself causes the planets to follow their\norbital paths rather than their inertial trajectories along the\ntangents to those orbits, independently of any fluid medium in the\nheavens. But in this posthumously published letter, Newton did not\nmerely repeat his basic understanding of gravity from his 1693\nexchange with Leibniz; he also included a wider discussion of\nmechanist norms within philosophy more generally. Again, Newton begins\nby quoting Leibniz:\n\n\nBut Mr. Leibniz goes on. \u201cThe ancients and the moderns, who own\nthat gravity is an occult quality, are in the right, if they mean by\nit that there is a certain mechanism unknown to them whereby all\nbodies tend towards the center of the earth. But if they mean that the\nthing is performed without any mechanism by a simple primitive quality\nor by a law of God who produces that effect without using any\nintelligible means, it is an unreasonable and occult quality, and so\nvery occult that it is impossible that it should ever be done though\nan angel or God himself should undertake to explain it\u201d. (Newton\n2004: 116)\n\n\nIn this passage, Leibniz returns to the kind of criticism that he\nwould present against the \u201csuperaddition\u201d view that Locke\npresented to Stillingfleet, arguing that philosophers must reject the\nidea that gravity could simply be a feature of bodies that God adds to\nthem, despite the fact that we cannot possibly understand\ngravitational interactions based on our idea of body (our idea of\nextended solid substances, or another similar idea). Indeed, Leibniz\nraises the stakes by contending that God himself could not explicate\nhow such interactions are possible based on the idea of matter.\nLeibniz would argue, perhaps on metaphysical grounds, that any laws\nsaid to govern the interaction of bodies, and any qualities attributed\nto bodies, must be intelligible in the terms available to philosophers\nthrough the mechanist orientation. In particular, laws and qualities\nmust be intelligible in terms of the shape, size, motion and\nimpenetrability (or solidity) of bodies. In this way, one might\nconclude that Locke and Leibniz actually do not necessarily disagree\non whether gravity can be made intelligible in mechanist terms; they\nsimply disagree on the propriety of the contention that God could\n\u201csuperadd\u201d a feature to bodies that cannot be made\nintelligible in that way.\n\nNewton\u2019s reply to Leibniz\u2019s argument is illuminating.\nInstead of presenting a narrow defense of his view, perhaps by denying\nthat he has postulated any non-mechanical causation with his theory of\ngravity, he challenges the mechanical philosophy itself by contending\nthat it should not be understood as holding for all natural\nphenomena:\n\n\nThe same ought to be said of hardness. So then gravity and hardness\nmust go for unreasonable occult qualities unless they can be explained\nmechanically. And why may not the same be said of the vis\ninertiae [force of inertia] and the extension, the duration and\nmobility of bodies, and yet no man ever attempted to explain these\nqualities mechanically, or took them for miracles or supernatural\nthings or fictions or occult qualities. They are the natural, real,\nreasonable, manifest qualities of all bodies seated in them by the\nwill of God from the beginning of the creation and perfectly incapable\nof being explained mechanically, and so may be the hardness of\nprimitive particles of bodies. And therefore if any man should say\nthat bodies attract one another by a power whose cause is unknown to\nus, or by a power seated in the frame of nature by the will of God, or\nby a power seated in a substance in which bodies move and float\nwithout resistance and which has therefore no vis inertiae\nbut acts by other laws than those that are mechanical: I know not why\nhe should be said to introduce miracles and occult qualities and\nfictions into the world. For Mr. Leibniz himself will scarce say that\nthinking is mechanical as it must be if to explain it otherwise be to\nmake a miracle, an occult quality, and a fiction. (Newton 2004:\n116)\n\n\nThe first aspect of Newton\u2019s argument is to indicate that\nmechanical explanations are predicated on referencing certain kinds of\nqualities when investigating natural phenomena, and that these\nqualities themselves are therefore not subject to mechanical\nexplanation. For instance, since mechanist explanations\u2014say, of\nthe way in which magnets attract iron filings across a\ntable\u2014must refer to qualities such as the extension of the\nbodies subject to the explanations, then we cannot give a mechanist\nexplanation of extension itself. Of course, Leibniz might reply that\nwe need not provide any explanation of the basic qualities of bodies\nthat figure in mechanical explanations, for those properties have been\nchosen by the \u201cmoderns\u201d precisely because they are\nperfectly intelligible on their own, perhaps unlike various qualities\nattributed to \u201cScholastic\u201d accounts of natural phenomena.\nThe second aspect of Newton\u2019s argument is more\nintriguing\u2014it also harkens back to Locke\u2019s discussion with\nStillingfleet, for Locke had contended that God may have superadded\nnot only gravity to material bodies, but also the power of thought,\nlinking them because he believed that neither could be rendered\nintelligible using any philosophical means at his disposal. That is,\nfrom Locke\u2019s point of view, we know that human\nbeings\u2014which are, or at least contain, material bodies with\nsize, shape, motion and solidity, along with parts characterized by\nthose qualities\u2014are capable of thought, but since we cannot\ndiscern how any material thing could possibly have that capacity, we\nconclude that God may have superadded that feature to us, or to our\nbodies. Thought and gravity are dis-analogous in the sense that we did\nnot require anything like Newton\u2019s theory to convince us that\nhuman beings can think, but they are otherwise analogous. Newton then\nattempts to make the following argument: since Leibniz would have to\nagree that thinking is not a mechanical process, and not mechanically\nexplicable, he must agree that there is at least one aspect of the\nworld that has the following two features, (1) it is not mechanical;\nand, (2) it is clearly not to be rejected on that ground alone. He\nattempts to liken gravity (as he understands it) to\nthinking (as he believes Leibniz is required to understand\nit), arguing that despite the fact that it is not mechanical\u2014it\ncannot be explained mechanically\u2014it should not be rejected on\nthat ground. This argument may be predicated on the view that human\nbeings, material things, or at least partially material things, do the\nthinking, rather than immaterial things, such as minds or souls, for\nif one attributes all thought to an immaterial mind or soul, then\nthere is no pressure to say that anything in nature, or perhaps even\nany aspect of anything in nature, has a feature that cannot be\nmechanically explicated. If one accepts Locke\u2019s view (apparently\nalso endorsed by Newton) that we should attribute thinking to material\nthings, or to aspects of material things, then perhaps Newton has\nsuccessfully followed Locke in likening gravity to thought, thereby\nmaking room for aspects of nature that are not mechanical after all.\nThis vexing issue would continue to generate debates amongst\nNewton\u2019s and Leibniz\u2019s various followers in England, and\non the Continent, respectively.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s most extensive debate with the Newtonians would not\noccur until the very end of his life. His celebrated correspondence\nwith Samuel Clarke, Newton\u2019s friend and supporter in London in\nthe early part of the eighteenth century, is his most famous\ninteraction with the Newtonians, occurring right before his death in\n1716 (Clarke and Leibniz 1717). Leibniz fomented the correspondence in\nNovember of 1715 by sending a brief, provocative letter to Princess\nCaroline of Wales, one designed to provoke a response from\nNewton\u2019s circle in London. Leibniz knew well that Princess\nCaroline was a leading intellectual and political figure in England at\nthe time, one who would surely be concerned by Leibniz\u2019s\nshocking claims about the religious consequences of Newtonian\nthinking. He opens his initial letter by mentioning both Locke and\nNewton, along with the issues about materiality and thinking that\narose in his near exchange with Newton in 1712:\n\n\nNatural religion itself seems to decay [in England] very much. Many\nwill have human souls to be material; others make God himself a\ncorporeal being. Mr. Locke and his followers are uncertain at least\nwhether the soul is not material and naturally perishable. Sir Isaac\nNewton says that space is an organ which God makes use of to perceive\nthings by. But if God stands in need of any organ to perceive things\nby, it will follow that they do not depend altogether on him, nor were\nproduced by him. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 1: 1\u20133)\n\n\nThus Leibniz charges both Lockeans and Newtonians with presenting\nphilosophical views of the human and of the divine that lead to\ntheologically unsavory consequences, such as the idea that the human\nsoul might be material and the view that God must employ something\nakin to an organ in order to perceive happenings in the world. These\nwere fighting words. Although Locke had died in 1704, he had various\nfollowers in England at the time (Gascoigne 1985: 172\u20133), and\nNewton himself was at the height of his influence: he had by then been\nknighted, as Leibniz acknowledges by calling him \u201cSir\u201d in\nhis letter, and was at that time President of the Royal Society.\nMoreover, Samuel Clarke had given the Boyle lectures in 1704 and again\nin 1705, so he was a public figure associated with the state of\nChristianity in England. Once Clarke took the bait, replying that same\nmonth to Leibniz\u2019s charges, Locke\u2019s views quickly dropped\nfrom view and the two focused specifically on Leibniz\u2019s numerous\nobjections to Newtonian ideas and methods. But why did Clarke respond\non Newton\u2019s behalf, and what was Newton\u2019s actual role in\nthe correspondence? These questions continue to puzzle scholars (see\nCohen and Koyr\u00e9 1962; Bertoloni Meli 1999 and 2002; Vailati\n1997). There is no documentary evidence, such as letters, between\nClarke and Newton indicating the contours of his role; then again, at\nthis time, both men lived in London and Clarke was Newton\u2019s\nparish priest, so the lack of letters or other papers is perhaps\nunsurprising. That fact alone is intriguing, for the theological\ndifferences between the two are salient: since Newton was a committed\nanti-Trinitarian\u2014a fact known to figures like Locke and to\nothers such as William Whiston\u2014he may have decided that\nLeibniz\u2019s contentions about \u201cnatural religion\u201d in\nEngland would best be answered by what we might now call a more\nmainstream theological figure like Clarke. In any event, there is no\ndoubt that Clarke was taken by Leibniz and his followers to be\nspeaking for Newton and his circle. Nonetheless, there are certainly\naspects of Clarke\u2019s views that may deviate from Newton\u2019s\nown opinions, so it would be unwise to (as it were) remove Clarke from\nour conception of the correspondence by regarding it effectively as\nNewton\u2019s work.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s side of the correspondence with Clarke is\nmethodologically characteristic: he leaves much of his own systematic\nand complex metaphysical theorizing\u2014including the\nmonadology\u2014in the background, bringing to the fore only those\nelements that are both necessary for his criticisms of the Newtonians\nand also likely to garner support from Clarke. Thus the key to many of\nLeibniz\u2019s criticisms is the principle of sufficient reason\n(PSR), which he knows Clarke will endorse (although with a distinct\nconception of its scope: Leibniz asserts, while Clarke denies, that\nthe principle demands that each act of divine willing requires a\nreason; for Clarke, divine willing itself is reason enough for some\nphysical state of affairs to obtain, or event to occur). Leibniz\nargues in particular that several key aspects of the Newtonian\nworldview are simply incompatible with the PSR, including the idea of\nabsolute space. If space were in fact completely independent of all\nphysical objects and all relations among them, as the Newtonians seem\nto assert, then a problem arises:\n\n\nI have many demonstrations to confute the fancy of those who take\nspace to be a substance or at least an absolute being. But I shall\nonly use, at present, one demonstration, which the author here gives\nme occasion to insist upon. I say, then, that if space were an\nabsolute being, something would happen for which it would be\nimpossible that there should be a sufficient reason\u2014which is\nagainst my axiom. And I prove it thus: space is something absolutely\nuniform, and without the things placed in it, one point of space\nabsolutely does not differ in any respect whatsoever from another\npoint of space. Now from this it follows (supposing space to be\nsomething in itself, besides the order of bodies among themselves)\nthat it is impossible there should be a reason why God, preserving the\nsame situations of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in\nspace after one certain particular manner and not otherwise\u2014why\neverything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by\nchanging east into west. But if space is nothing else but this order\nor relation, and is nothing at all without bodies but the possibility\nof placing them, then those two states, the one such as it is now, the\nother supposed to be the quite contrary way, would not at all differ\nfrom one another. Their difference therefore is only to be found in\nour chimerical supposition of the reality of space. (Clarke and\nLeibniz 1717: L 3: 5)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s argument is clever at the outset: he bypasses the\nthorny problem of determining whether Newton\u2019s idea of absolute\nspace commits him to thinking of space as a substance\u2014a view,\nincidentally, which Newton explicitly considers and rejects in De\nGravitatione (Newton 2004: 21\u20132)\u2014by presupposing only\nthat Newton thinks of space as existing independently of objects and\ntheir relations. If space is indeed independent in this way, then it\nwould seem that God faces a choice: when creating the world, or\nmatter, why place (e.g.) the earth in one particular part of space\nrather than any other? The parts of space, independently of all\nobjects and all relations, obviously do not differ from one another in\nany respect at all, so it would seem that one could not even\ntheoretically devise a reason for placing the earth anywhere in\nparticular, as opposed to anywhere else . (This argument,\nincidentally, does not depend on our having the capacity to refer to\nplaces within empty space.) But since space exists, with all its\nplaces, independently of the earth and everything else, then God must\nindeed have some reason to place the earth in one place rather than\nanother\u2014for Leibniz, even the divine will is inert independent\nof any reason for (as it were) moving in one direction rather than\nanother. Finally, Leibniz argues that he himself avoids this problem\nby asserting that space is nothing above and beyond the objects in the\nworld and all possible relations amongst them (hence he holds a kind\nof modal relationalist view, in more modern terminology). God faces no\nproblematic choice on this view, since space does not exist prior to\nthe creation of the world, or of material objects: to create objects\nwith spatial relations is ipso facto to create space itself,\nfor it is nothing over and above objects and their relations. If you\nlike, space for Leibniz just is a way of conceptually grasping all\nobjects and all possible relations amongst them, all at once. Time,\nsimilarly, is a way of grasping the whole series of events that have\ncharacterized history. Clarke\u2019s reply is somewhat disappointing:\nhe blocks Leibniz\u2019s inference by simply denying that the divine\nwill must have a reason to place (say) the earth in one place rather\nthan another (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 3: 5). The PSR is not\nviolated in this case, according to Clarke\u2019s interpretation of\nit, because it requires only this: if the earth appears in one place\nrather than another, there must be a reason that it appears there, and\nthe reason in this case is simply the divine will; there is no further\nquestion about why the divine being made a particular choice rather\nthan another. In the quotation above, Leibniz speaks of the Newtonians\nas endorsing \u201cthe reality of space\u201d, which Leibniz regards\nas \u201cchimerical\u201d. This remark highlights another important\naspect of Leibniz\u2019s conception of space and time, one that is\noften ignored in contemporary discussions, which tend to emphasize\nLeibnizian \u201crelationalism\u201d in opposition to Newtonian\n\u201cabsolutism\u201d. Leibniz\u2019s view of space and time\nconnects intimately with broader aspects of his metaphysical\npositions: unlike ordinary physical objects, which are constituted by\ntheir parts (they are discrete), and which exhibit features that\ninvolve internal distinctions amongst those parts, he thinks of space\nand time as continuous and homogeneous. Leaving aside the monadology,\nas he does in his correspondence with Clarke, this means that for\nLeibniz, it is physical objects that are real things; space and time\nare merely \u201cideal\u201d or abstract entities whose continuity\nand homogeneity signal this special status. It is not merely that\nspace and time are nothing over and above the events and relations of\nobjects that exist in our world; it is also the case that they are\nideal: they depend in some way on the human mind for their existence.\nOr so Leibniz seems to suggest. This aspect of his view would become\nof central importance to later (e.g. Kant\u2019s) conceptions of the\nLeibniz-Newton debate on the nature of space.\n\nObviously, Leibniz\u2019s arguments against the Newtonians\nhighlighted a fundamental difference between his interpretation of the\nPSR and Clarke\u2019s: where Leibniz held what we might call the\n\u201crationalist\u201d view that all willing, all choice, must\noccur for a reason\u2014a requirement from which even the divine\nbeing is not exempt\u2014Clarke held what we might call the\n\u201cvoluntarist\u201d view that willing, or choice, itself need\nnot occur for any reason, for it is itself a sufficient reason for\nsome states of affairs to obtain or event to occur. From\nLeibniz\u2019s point of view, this renders the will, including the\ndivine will, opaque or unintelligible: if an agent can act or make a\nchoice without having any reason for it, then surely the agent is not\nrational, and if the PSR demands anything of the world, it is that the\nworld be rationally intelligible to us. This requirement must hold of\nagents and their wills as well. But from Clarke\u2019s point of view,\nthis requirement is too stringent, especially in the divine case: if\nwe hold that even God must have a reason for choosing to create one\nstate of affairs rather than another\u2014for choosing, say, to part\nthe Red Sea rather than the Mississippi River\u2014then we are\nipso facto restricting God\u2019s freedom. Surely God has\nthe freedom to choose to do anything at all, or at least, anything\nthat does not contain or instantiate a contradiction, and for his\npart, Leibniz agrees that the principle of contradiction does not\nentail the PSR\u2014the latter is a separate and independent\nprinciple which is necessary for metaphysics and natural philosophy to\nextend beyond mathematics, which requires only the principle of\ncontradiction (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 2: 1). But he thinks that\nClarke\u2019s view leaves us with a God, and indeed with ordinary\nagents, who can act arbitrarily, with no reason at all. That is not\nthe kind of freedom that philosophy seeks; it wishes to see agents as\nengaged in rational action. In their differing interpretations of the\nPSR, and their correspondingly distinct conceptions of freedom and\nreason, the debate between Leibniz and Clarke hits rock bottom.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s criticisms of the Newtonians were not restricted to\nquestions about the nature of space and time; he also revived his old\ncomplaint\u2014one shared by Huygens, as we have seen\nabove\u2014that Newton\u2019s physical theory commits him to the\npossibility, if not to the reality, of action at a distance among the\nplanetary bodies. In one passage in his fourth letter, for instance,\nLeibniz writes (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 4: 45):\n\n\nIt is also a supernatural thing that bodies should attract one another\nat a distance without any intermediate means and that a body should\nmove around without receding in the tangent, though nothing hinders it\nfrom so receding. For these effects cannot be explained by the nature\nof things.\n\n\nAs a defender of the mechanical philosophy, Leibniz insists here, as\nhe had before, that a material body like the Earth would recede along\nthe tangent to its orbit if it were not impacted upon by some physical\nbody or bodies, such as a vortex or another kind of fluid filling the\nsolar system. Clarke\u2019s reply to this charge is especially\nilluminating (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 4: 45):\n\n\nThat one body should attract another without any intermediate means,\nis indeed not a miracle, but a contradiction: for \u2018tis supposing\nsomething to act where it is not. But the means by which two bodies\nattract each other may be invisible and intangible, and of a different\nnature from mechanism, and yet, acting regularly and constantly, may\nwell be called natural, being much less wonderful than animal motion,\nwhich yet is never called a miracle\u2019.\n\n\nThis passage is bound to confuse readers. On the one hand, Clarke is\nclearly arguing that the Newtonians refuse to restrict their\nunderstanding of causal interactions in nature to mechanical cases; on\nthe other, however, he does not accept what many at that time would\nhave regarded as the obvious implication of this denial of mechanism,\nnamely that action at a distance is perfectly possible (a move\nembraced by some later in the eighteenth century, such as Kant).\nInstead, Clarke not only rejects action at a distance, as Newton\npossibly had before him; he contends that it isn\u2019t even\nlogically possible! In his various pronouncements to Bentley and\nothers, Newton never contended that action at a distance was simply a\ncontradiction and therefore impossible, presumably even for the divine\nbeing, who is typically said to be capable of creating any situation\nthat does not instantiate a contradiction (although Descartes\u2019s\nviews on the eternal truths are obviously more complicated).\nClarke\u2019s view raises a serious problem for Newtonians: if action\nat a distance is simply a contradiction, and therefore not a possible\nphysical situation, even with divine intervention, then how should one\ninterpret the theory of universal gravity, which certainly\nappears to indicate that distant action is perfectly\npossible, and perhaps even actual? If we interpret the theory as\npostulating actual distant action, say between the moon and the earth,\nthen it clearly must be mistaken; but even if we interpret it less\nstrongly, as merely postulating that distant action between the moon\nand the earth is possible, that would presumably disqualify the theory\nas well. Perhaps one can save Clarke\u2019s view by contending that\nsince distant action is logically impossible, Newton\u2019s theory\nmust therefore be interpreted as neutral on that issue. This is one\nissue where Clarke\u2019s views may differ substantially from\nNewton\u2019s own. Regardless of whether Clarke represented\nNewton\u2019s own views faithfully, there is no doubt that his\ncorrespondence with Leibniz helped to shape the agenda of philosophy\nin the eighteenth century.\n7. Newton\u2019s impact on philosophy\n\nThe history of eighteenth-century philosophy cannot be written without\nextensive discussion of Newton\u2019s own views and of his influence\non the views of other figures both in England and on the Continent. As\nwe have seen, when Newton was a young student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, Cartesian views in natural philosophy and much else besides\nhad replaced the ideas and methods of Aristotle and his followers as\nthe most important subject for discussion amongst philosophers. In\nmany ways, Newton eventually succeeded in convincing philosophers that\nhis own ideas and methods were superior to those of the\nCartesians\u2014especially when it came to thinking about motion and\nits causes\u2014but this historical fact did not mean that\nNewtonianism, even broadly construed, became the dominant trend in\nnatural philosophy during Newton\u2019s lifetime. On the contrary,\nNewton\u2019s views continued to be the subject of intense scrutiny\nand debate. As we have seen, this was true amongst Leibniz and his\nfollowers (such as Christiaan Wolff) and among fellow mechanists (such\nas Huygens). Indeed, a late-seventeenth-century debate between\nCartesian and Newtonian ideas was supplanted by an early eighteenth\ncentury debate between Leibnizian and Newtonian views; the latter\ndebate would continue in one form or another for the rest of the\ncentury. But even amongst leading Continental mathematicians, some of\nNewton\u2019s most basic ideas, for instance concerning the forces of\nnature, remained the subject of dispute until well into the eighteenth\ncentury. To give just one prominent example that influenced the\ndevelopment of philosophy, D\u2019Alembert and Euler, two of the\ngreatest mathematicians of the Enlightenment, had opposite reactions\nto Newton\u2019s idea that the mass of an object could also be\nreferred to by the \u201cvery significant name\u201d of the vis\ninertiae, or force of inertia (Newton 1999, 404\u2014see below\nfor details). These discussions, along with numerous other debates\nabout space, time, motion were a driving force during the French\nEnlightenment. They remained a powerful stimulant to philosophical\ntheorizing in the 1770s and 1780s, when Kant forged his magisterial\n\u201ccritical\u201d system of philosophy, an approach that almost\nsingle-handedly set the philosophical agenda of the early nineteenth\ncentury. Hence Newton\u2019s influence on the eighteenth century did\nnot take the form of a single philosophical program or movement;\ninstead, it was the controversial nature of his ideas and methodology\nthat drove much of the philosophical discussion.\n\nNewton\u2019s ideas and methods were certainly most influential in\nBritain, where there grew to be a strong \u201cNewtonian\u201d\nmovement\u2014also called the \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d\nprogram\u2014by roughly 1700. By the fin de siecle, it is\nprobably safe to say that natural philosophy had become heavily\nNewtonian in England, at least in the sense that it had eclipsed both\nCartesianism (Henry 2013: 124 and introduction to Voltaire 1738 [1992,\n7]), and other local movements, such as Cambridge Platonism, which had\nexhibited a strong influence during the previous generation. One might\nput the point somewhat differently: to the extent that there was a\ndominant strand in England by 1700, it was the \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d, a view that was associated strongly with figures\nsuch as Boyle, Newton and Locke. Figures such as Hobbes had opposed\nthis approach to solving philosophical problems, but had failed to\ngain nearly as much influence. Perhaps more importantly,\nNewton\u2019s view of motion, his understanding of space and time,\nand his approach to achieving knowledge of natural phenomena, helped\nto shape the agenda of British philosophy for the next fifty years. In\naddition to Newton\u2019s influence on Locke\u2019s thinking about\nmatter and causation, explored above, both Berkeley and Hume expended\nconsiderable energy grappling with the wider consequences and\nimplications of the Newtonian version of the experimental philosophy.\nFor his part, Berkeley famously derided many Newtonians methods and\nideas\u2014sometimes exempting Newton himself from his conception of\nthe worst philosophical excesses of his followers\u2014including the\nrise of the calculus among mathematicians (in The Analyst)\nand the use of the idea of a force as the basic causal concept in\nnatural philosophy (in De Motu\u2014both reprinted in\nBerkeley 1992). Berkeley\u2019s theory of ideas, which arose in part\nfrom his reflections of what we would now call Locke\u2019s\n\u201cempiricist\u201d notion of representation, suggested to him\nthat no idea can be abstract: each idea must represent a\nparticular rather than a universal. Hence we can have an idea\nof a particular car, say a yellow two-door sports car, but not of a\ncar in general, one with no specific characteristics. Similarly, we\ncan have an idea of a particular shade of yellow, perhaps because\nwe\u2019ve just seen a lovely yellow rose at the florist, but not of\nyellow in general; and so on. Berkeley then argued that modern\nmathematics, especially the calculus, and modern natural philosophy,\nespecially Newtonian versions of it, were often reliant on abstract\nideas, and therefore philosophically suspect. For instance, he\ncontended that the very idea of absolute motion was suspect because we\ncan represent to ourselves only various motions with particular\nfeatures related to particular bodies in motion, but\n\u201cabsolute\u201d motion cannot be rendered particular\nin anything like this way; it remains abstract (Downing 2005: 235).\nThus although Newtonian views were considered to be essential to the\nrise of experimental philosophy in Britain, Berkeley derided them as\ninsufficiently experimental, or empirical, as overly reliant on\nrepresentations of universals and of universal quantities, rather than\non the representation of particulars. In a reflection of\nMalebranche\u2019s influence, Berkeley also argued that some\nNewtonians wrongly attributed genuine causal powers to ordinary\nmaterial objects through their use of the concept of impressed force;\nwrongly, because Berkeley firmly rejected the notion that any body\ncould exert any causal power. All causation in Berkeley\u2019s system\nis due either to the intervention of the divine in the course of\nhistory, or to spirits or minds, which are genuinely causally active.\nFinally, in an argument that would prefigure Mach\u2019s reactions to\nNewtonian conceptions of space, time and motion in the late nineteenth\ncentury\u2014which were expressive of a broad commitment to\n\u201cempiricism\u201d\u2014Berkeley contended that absolute space\nis a metaphysical aberration: philosophers should not posit any entity\nor thing that is beyond all possible perception. In sum, Berkeley was\nhighly critical of many aspects of the Newtonian program, but for that\nvery reason, it was Newton\u2019s ideas that helped to shape many of\nhis philosophical projects.\n\nFor his part, Hume had a more nuanced reaction to the emergence of the\nNewtonian program (cf. Schliesser 2007 and DePierris 2012). He\ncertainly signaled his endorsement of the experimental\nphilosophy\u2014itself strongly associated with the Newtonians, along\nwith figures like Boyle and Hooke, as we have seen\u2014when he gave\nhis Treatise the following subtitle: \u201cbeing an attempt\nto introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects\u201d. And one might argue that Hume made a kind of Lockean\nmove when he chose to endorse the Newtonian program specifically in\npreference to the mechanical philosophy, which he regarded with\nsuspicion. A famous comment from his History of England\nbolsters this interpretation:\n\n\nWhile Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of\nnature, he showed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical\nphilosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that\nobscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain. (Hume 1854\n[1754\u201361]: vol. 5: 374)\n\n\nThe difference between Locke and Hume might be that the former, unlike\nthe latter, nonetheless insisted that mechanism continued to provide\nphilosophers with a canon for the intelligibility of causation within\nnature (Hume\u2019s critique of earlier conceptions of causation,\nincluding Locke\u2019s, is certainly well known). Hume also expended\nconsiderable effort in interpreting some of the philosophical aspects\nor consequences of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and his\ncorresponding understanding of the nature of matter. In particular, he\nwished to provide what we would now call an empiricist interpretation\nof Newton\u2019s three laws of motion, his concept of mass (quantity\nof matter), and his understanding of gravity; in the process, he does\nnot shy away from interpreting Newton\u2019s sometimes confusing\nnotion of the vis inertiae or force of inertia. When students\nlearn the canonical idea of a Newtonian force, they learn about what\nNewton called a vis impressa, an impressed force. They also\nlearn that the mass of a body is not a force at all. But in all three\neditions of the Principia, Newton himself said that although\nthe mass of a body is not an impressed force, it could be called by\nthe \u201cvery significant name of force of inertia\u201d because\nbodies with mass with resist acceleration (Newton 1999, 404). And to\nresist acceleration seemed to Newton like an action that a body\nperforms, say when some other body collides with it. Now for Hume,\nthis issue was particularly difficult because he had already contended\nthat strictly speaking, we have no idea (no representation) of force\nor power\u2014these are merely words employed by natural philosophers\nwithout any ideas corresponding to them. Thus he must find an\ninterpretation of Newton that is not predicated on our ability to form\nan idea of forces or powers. In a famous footnote in his Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, he writes (Hume 1777 [1993:\n\u00a7vii.i note 2, 48\u201349]):\n\n\nI need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of\ngravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active\npower. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second\ncauses of all force or energy; though some of his followers have\nendeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the\ncontrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an ethereal active\nfluid to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious\nand modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be\ninsisted on, without more experiments.\n\n\nIn mentioning Newton\u2019s speculation that an aether might explain\nuniversal gravity in some sense (for instance, in query 21 to the\nOpticks), Hume does not appear to be concerned about action\nat a distance; instead, he is concerned to argue that this speculation\nindicates that Newton himself did not regard his theory as requiring\nthat we attribute a \u201cpower\u201d of gravity to material bodies.\nThis is important for Hume to establish, not least because he believes\nthat we can form no representation at all of any such power.\nSimilarly, when Newton indicates in the Principia that we can\nconceive of a body\u2019s quantity of matter as its vis\ninertiae, its power of resisting any change to its state of\nmotion (Newton 1999: 404\u20135), he is not attributing any power to\nthat body, but rather employing a means of characterizing its\nbehavior. Or so Hume contends. In this specific regard, we find an\necho of Berkeley\u2019s earlier work: in De Motu, Berkeley\nargues in particular that although some philosophers misunderstand the\nNewtonian theory of gravity as attributing a special force or nature\nto material objects, there is an interpretation of Newton that is\nconsistent with the new theory of ideas. He writes (Berkeley 1992:\nDe Motu, \u00a76):\n\n\nAgain, force, gravity, and terms of that sort are\nmore often used in the concrete (and rightly so) so as to connote the\nbody in motion, the effort of resisting, etc. But when they are used\nby philosophers to signify certain natures carved out and abstracted\nfrom all these things, natures which are not objects of sense, nor can\nbe grasped by any force of intellect, nor pictured by the imagination,\nthen indeed they breed errors and confusion.\n\n\nThere is little doubt, then, that the new British philosophy\nrepresented by Locke, Berkeley, and Hume in the early-to-mid\neighteenth century was concerned to present interpretations of\nNewton\u2019s work that were consistent with their overarching\nphilosophical commitments, principles and methods, or to alter those\ncommitments, principles and methods as necessary.\n\nThese attempts by canonical philosophers like Berkeley and Hume to\nfind what they regarded as a defensible interpretation of Newtonian\nforces are mirrored by similar attempts in the writings of leading\nmathematicians. For instance, the very same issue discussed by Hume\nhad already been debated by two of the leading figures in Continental\nscience, D\u2019Alembert and Euler. For his part, in his famous work,\nthe Trait\u00e9 de dynamique (1743), D\u2019Alembert\nexpressed a view that is very similar to Hume\u2019s (in certain\nrespects). He proclaimed right at the outset that he wished to develop\na physics that would dispense with the concept of a force altogether\non the grounds that it was an \u201cobscure\u201d idea. He would\n\u201creduce all the principles of mechanics to three, the force of\ninertia, compound motion, and equilibrium\u201d (D\u2019Alembert\n1743, 3). He immediately explained the first item: the reason that he\ncould accept Newton\u2019s force of inertia is that it\u2019s\ncharacterized as a property of bodies, one in virtue of which they\nfollow the laws of motion, rather than a force or power. So it was not\nan obscure notion. Ironically, the great Swiss mathematician Euler had\nprecisely the opposite reaction: from his point of view, the\n\u201cforce of inertia\u201d was simply a misnomer, for it was not a\nforce at all and should therefore be expunged from physics altogether.\nInstead, physics should employ only the idea of an impressed force, a\ncause of acceleration, which he regarded as a perfectly clear idea. Of\ncourse, history was on Euler\u2019s side, indeed so much so that\nfuture generations would not even imagine that so many leading\nphilosophers and mathematicians during the Enlightenment debated this\ntopic.\n\nIn other respects, in France the intellectual situation was rather\ndifferent than in England. Cartesian ideas held sway for many decades\nafter Newton first emerged on the scene in the 1670s with his optics\npapers and in the late 1680s with the Principia; they were\nespecially popular at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, unlike\nthe situation in the Royal Society (Henry 2013: 120). Voltaire became\nfamous for challenging the Cartesian French orthodoxy, traveling to\nEngland for a celebrated visit and bringing home\n\u201cenlightened\u201d ideas about philosophy, politics, and much\nelse besides in an attempt to foment the emergence and development of\na French Newtonian program. His most important publication in this\nregard is probably the Elements of the philosophy of Newton\n(Voltaire 1738/1992), which attempts to signal the\n\u201cerrors\u201d of Descartes and to highlight the advantages of\nthe Newtonian program in \u201cPhysique\u201d. Of course, Cartesian\nideas and methods retained numerous adherents and defenders in France,\nand so the debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas flourished in\nthat environment (cf. Aiton 1972: ch. 8). But even in France,\nCartesianism eventually gave way to a newer version of metaphysics\nassociated with Leibniz and his German follower and expositor, Wolff.\nIn 1740, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, published a key text,\nInstitutions de physique, or Foundations of physics\n(see especially the analysis in Brading 2019). In her\ntext\u2014which was republished in a second edition in 1742 and\nswiftly translated into German and Italian\u2014she makes precisely\nthe kind of argument that presses Hume a few years later to articulate\na conception of the vis inertiae that is consistent with the\nexperimental philosophy. She argues that the Cartesian view that\nextension is the essence of body is mistaken; we must conceive of\nmaterial objects as exhibiting a \u201cforce\nd\u2019inertie\u201d if we are to understand their physical\ninteractions properly (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 1, \u00a72).\nPerhaps not surprisingly, D\u2019Alembert cites her text approvingly\nin his Treatise on Dynamics. From Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\npoint of view, this Newtonian conception of body is not inherently\nproblematic. Problems arise, however, when some Newtonians interpret\nthe theory of universal gravity as proving that bodies have a property\nof attraction or attractive power endowed by God (Du Ch\u00e2telet\n1742: ch. 16, \u00a7385). She accepts the idea that gravity is\nproportional to the masses of bodies and inversely proportional to the\nsquare of their spatial separation, arguing that this Newtonian idea\nof attraction \u201cmarvelously\u201d explains the fall of bodies on\nearth, the tides, and various astronomical phenomena, something that\nthe vortex theory of the Cartesians fails to do. But she denies that\nthis acceptance entails that she must also accept the conclusion that\nbodies have an \u201cessential property\u201d called gravity or\nattractive force, contending that such a conclusion transcends the\nknowledge available to philosophers (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 16,\n\u00a7388). The reason is that no one had yet demonstrated that there\nis no medium for gravity, such as a vortex or an aether: since gravity\nmay depend on some medium, it may not be essential to matter per\nse. In this specific way, Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s work is\npredicated on the familiar notion that although Cartesianism had been\noverthrown by Newtonian ideas and methods, philosophers must\nnonetheless develop a proper interpretation of the Newtonian theory of\ngravity and of its implications. Yet unlike Voltaire, who not only\nrejected Cartesianism, but became famous for his ridicule of\nLeibnizian philosophy in Candide, Ch\u00e2telet argued that\nphilosophers should continue to work on developing the proper\nmethodology in part by taking seriously the ideas and methods of\nLeibniz and Wolff. In particular, Ch\u00e2telet argued that the\nprinciple of sufficient reason should be a guiding force in\nmetaphysical theorizing, and as Leibniz had argued, it shows the\nfundamental error in Newton\u2019s concept of absolute space; she\nadded that Clarke\u2019s method of replying to Leibniz\u2019s\nargument, viz., that one can develop a non-Leibnizian or voluntarist\nconception of the PSR to evade the problem with absolute space, is\nunderwhelming (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 5, \u00a774). She also\nargued that if we use the PSR to guide our thinking about science, we\nwill be skeptical of Locke\u2019s solution to the problem of\nunderstanding the philosophical implications of Newton\u2019s theory\nof universal gravity. The idea that Newton\u2019s theory supports the\nconclusion that God must have \u201csuperadded\u201d gravity to\nmatter avoids potential problems with asserting that gravity is\n\u201cessential\u201d to matter, something she also regards\nskeptically, but simply encounters other problems. First, since no one\nyet understood whether there was any medium underlying gravitational\ninteractions, such as an aether, it was premature to conclude that\ngravity is a property of matter, even one \u201csuperadded\u201d to\nit by divine fiat. After all, if there is an aether, then matter may\ngravitate because of its interactions with the aether, and not because\nof any superadded property. Second, the PSR demands that we seek\nrational explanations of natural phenomena in our science, but the\nsuperaddition thesis is predicated on the idea that we simply cannot\nunderstand how matter gravitates toward other matter. Newton\u2019s\nscience is simply taken to indicate that it does so. She was unwilling\nto leave the most important conclusion of the Scientific Revolution a\nmere mystery.\n\nEuler\u2019s rejection of the vis inertiae was not his only\nmajor reaction to Newton\u2019s science. The question of whether to\naccept, and of how to interpret, absolute space, time and motion, and\nthe related question of how to conceive of the relation between\nNewton\u2019s work in natural philosophy and the flourishing\nLeibnizian-Wolffian metaphysics on the Continent, continued to drive\nconversations in the middle of the eighteenth century. Just a few\nyears after Ch\u00e2telet published her Institutions, Euler\npresented a novel approach to these two questions in a short paper\nentitled \u201cReflexions sur l\u2019Espace et le Temps\u201d,\nfirst published in 1748 in the M\u00e9moires de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Berlin. The Berlin\nAcademy had been witnessing a vociferous debate between Wolffians and\nNewtonians since 1740 (a debate that would continue until roughly\n1759), one in which Euler played a role. Whereas one might regard the\nBritish philosophers, especially Berkeley and Hume, as arguing that\nphilosophical principles and commitments take a kind of precedence in\ndriving one\u2019s interpretations of the concepts of force, motion,\nspace and time, Euler argued that natural\nphilosophy\u2014specifically, mechanics\u2014ought to take\nprecedence. The famous first sentence of his essay indicates why: he\ncontends that the principles of mechanics\u2014for instance, the\nprinciple of inertia\u2014are so well established that it would be\nfoolish to doubt them (Euler 1748: 324). In particular, if one\u2019s\nmetaphysical commitments stand in tension with the concepts of space\nand motion found in geometry and mechanics, then one must adjust those\ncommitments accordingly. Euler then presented a clever argument: the\nlaw of inertia picks out rectilinear motion as a special kind of\nmotion, so to apply it to bodies in nature, there must be a clear\nmeaning to the idea of a straight line. But if space is merely the\norder of relations amongst material bodies, then any set of reference\nbodies we use to determine which motion is straight could itself be in\nmotion. So to employ the idea of rectilinear motion, we require the\nnotion of absolute space (see DiSalle 2006, 36-37).\n\nThe most important figure in German-speaking Europe to react in depth\nto Newton\u2019s ideas was surely Immanuel Kant. As a young man, Kant\nwas influenced by Euler\u2019s argument (Friedman 1992: 16\u201317)\nin the 1748\n piece.[26]\n Kant began grappling with Newtonian ideas at the very beginning of\nhis career\u2014he discussed the inverse-square law in his first\npublication (Kant 1747: \u00a7 10)\u2014and they would remain central\nboth to his magnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kant\n1787 [1992]) and to his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience (1786 [2002]). In the so-called pre-critical period, Kant\ndiverged sharply from the approach toward natural philosophy defended\nby many Leibnizians in German-speaking Europe by deciding to accept\nthe Newtonian theory of universal gravity, along with corresponding\naspects of the Newtonian conception of matter, as a starting point for\nphilosophical theorizing (Friedman 2012: 485\u20136). He makes this\nexplicit already in 1763, in The Only Possible Argument:\n\n\nI will attempt to provide an explanation of the origin of the world\nsystem according to the general laws of mechanics, not an explanation\nof the entire natural order, but only of the great masses of matter\nand their orbits, which constitute the most crudest foundation of\nnature \u2026 I will presuppose the universal gravitation of matter\naccording to Newton or his followers in this project. If\nthere are any who believe that through a definition of metaphysics\nformulated according to their own taste they can annihilate the\nconclusions established by men of perspicacity on the basis of\nobservation and by means of mathematical inference\u2014if there are\nsuch persons, they can skip the following propositions as something\nwhich has only a remote bearing on the main aim of this essay. (Kant\n1763: AK 2: 139)\n\n\nA rare case of Kantian irony, it seems. Already in this early text,\nKant has clearly broken with his predecessors both in England and on\nthe Continent, who insisted on disputing Newton\u2019s theory of\nuniversal gravity, either on metaphysical or theological grounds.\nInstead, Kant\u2019s work will be predicated on that theory. But Kant\nnever became an orthodox Newtonian, any more than an orthodox\nLeibnizian (or Wolffian). This is evident from the radically different\nfates of two classic Newtonian concepts within the Kantian system: the\nidea that the theory of universal gravity shows that gravity is a\nfeature of material bodies, along with the related concept of action\nat a distance, on the one hand; and absolute space, on the other. The\nquotation from 1763 above indicates that Kant was willing to endorse\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravity, despite the many\nobjections raised against it by his Leibnizian predecessors. Indeed,\nhe was also willing to accept the most radical interpretation of that\ntheory, one according to which every material body in the world should\nbe understood as bearing a feature called gravity, one that involves\nthat body in actions at a distance on all other such bodies. As Kant\nputs it dramatically in Proposition 7 of the second chapter of\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science: \u201cThe\nattraction essential to all matter is an immediate action of matter on\nother matter through empty space\u201d (Kant 1786 [2002: 223]; AK 4:\n512). This view is radical in two senses: first, it involves the\nhighly controversial claim that gravity is essential to matter, which\nindicates that a body lacking gravitational interactions would\npotentially fail to count as a material entity at all (much as an\nearlier generation of philosophers would conceive of extension as\nessential to matter); and second, it also involves the debated idea\nthat material bodies act at a distance on one another. One can\nconceivably endorse the latter without endorsing the former,\ncontending, e.g., that although material bodies in the actual world\nact at a distance on one another, perhaps because of a divine plan, it\nis perfectly possible for material bodies to fail to do so\nunder distinct worldly conditions (i.e., there may be possible worlds\nin which material bodies lack gravity altogether). That is, the\nendorsement of action at a distance does not entail the endorsement of\nthe essentiality claim. Both ideas are controversial, and Kant\nstrongly endorses them both. This placed him in a rather select group\nof radical Newtonians (Friedman 1992: 1 note 2). Kant himself\nunderstood that Newton may not have endorsed these controversial\nviews, arguing that he was inconsistent on this score (see Remark 2 to\nProposition 7 of chapter 2, AK 4: 514\u201316; Friedman 2012:\n203\u201321). And yet Kant strongly resisted the other most\ncontroversial Newtonian idea, absolute space, along with the related\nidea of absolute motion (Friedman 2012: 35\u201342). In the\nCritique of Pure Reason, for instance, Kant expressed a\nbasically Leibnizian sympathy by arguing that there are fundamental\nmetaphysical (and perhaps epistemic) difficulties with thinking of\nspace and time as existing independently of all objects and all\npossible relations among them as \u201cactual entities\n\u201d(wirkliche Wesen\u2014A23/B37) in their own right. He\ndoes so in a passage that (perhaps confusingly) characterizes the\nLeibnizians as also defending a kind of realism about space, but we\ncan focus solely on his criticism of the Newtonians:\n\n\nThose, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time,\nwhether they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles of experience. For\nif they decide in favor of the first (which is generally the position\nof the mathematical investigators of nature), then they must assume\ntwo eternal and infinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and\ntime), which exist (yet without there being anything real) only in\norder to comprehend everything real within themselves. (A39/B56)\n\n\nIf one regards space (like time) as existing independently of all\nobjects and all possible relations, and yet one admits that space is\ncausally inert and imperceptible, as one presumably must in the late\neighteenth century, then one is committed to the idea that there is a\nkind of infinite and eternal non-entity in the world. Space is a kind\nof non-entity, Kant suggests, because on the one hand it is said to\nexist independently of everything else, and yet on the other hand, it\nis said to be causally inert and imperceptible, which would\ndistinguish it from every other sort of thing that exists. Kant simply\ncannot stomach this metaphysically preposterous notion. It is\ntherefore incumbent upon him to develop a theory of space (and of\nmotion) that meets at least two distinct criteria: (1) it coheres with\nhis understanding of the theory of universal gravity, and of what he\nregards as its implication, viz. that gravity is an essential feature\nof material bodies; and, (2) it avoids the metaphysically problematic\naspects of Newtonian absolute space. Kant tackles precisely these\ntasks in the Metaphysical Foundations, which was published in\nbetween the appearance of the first and second edition of the\nCritique, arguing that we can regard absolute space as a kind\nof idea of reason, an ideal that we approach asymptotically in our\ntheorizing about motion. Absolute space is therefore nothing more than\na kind of ideal within our philosophy, and no longer a harmful aspect\nof our ontology.\n\nNewton\u2019s influence on the development of philosophy did not end\nwith the close of the eighteenth century. Most obviously, the concepts\nof absolute space and absolute motion continued to play fundamental\nroles in philosophical theorizing about space and motion more\ngenerally for the next two centuries, and they remain fundamental to\ndiscussions today (DiSalle 2006). Newton has also had a deep and\nlasting influence on numerous other topics in what we now call the\nphilosophy of science, including the status of our knowledge of\nnatural phenomena, the best ideas about scientific methodology, the\nstatus of the laws of nature, and much else besides (McMullin 2001 and\nSmith 2001). It is no exaggeration to say that Newton has a permanent\nplace in the history of modern philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aiton, Eric, 1972, <em>The Vortex Theory of Planetary\nMotions</em>, New York: American Elsevier.", "D\u2019Alembert, Jean Le Rond, 1743, <em>Trait\u00e9 de\ndynamique</em>, Paris.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>Preliminary Discourse to the\nEncyclopedia of Diderot</em>, Richard Schwab (trans.), Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1995.", "Anstey, Peter, 2011, <em>John Locke and Natural Philosophy</em>,\nOxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, (ed.), <em>The Oxford Handbook of\nBritish Philosophy in the Seventeenth Century</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "Bentley, Richard, 1756, <em>Four Letters from Sir Isaac Newton to\nDoctor Bentley concerning Some Arguments in Proof of a Deity</em>,\nLondon.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1976/1692, <em>Eight Boyle Lectures on\nAtheism</em>, New York: Garland.", "Berkeley, George, 1992, <em>De Motu and the Analyst</em>, Douglas\nJesseph (ed. and trans.), Dordrecht: Kluwer.", "Bertoloni Meli, Domenico, 1993, <em>Equivalence and Priority:\nNewton vs. Leibniz</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1999, \u201cCaroline, Leibniz, and\nClarke\u201d, <em>Journal of the History of Ideas</em>, 60:\n469\u2013486.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002, \u201cNewton and the Leibniz-Clarke\nCorrespondence\u201d, in Cohen and Smith 2002: 455\u2013464.", "Bloch, L\u00e9on, 1903, <em>La Philosophie de Newton</em>,\nParis: Libraires F\u00e9lix Alcan.", "Boas, Marie, 1952, \u201cThe Mechanical Philosophy\u201d,\n<em>Osiris</em>, 10: 412\u2013541.", "Boyle, Robert, 1744, <em>The Works of the Honourable Robert\nBoyle</em>, T.
