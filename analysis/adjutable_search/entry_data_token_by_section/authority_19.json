Reasonable Consensus Conceptions of Legitimate Political Authority\n\n\nReasonable consensus views of political authority attempt to find a\nkind of mean between the extreme individualism of consent theory and\nthe lack of respect for people's opinions of the instrumentalist views.\nJohn Rawls argues that the liberal principle of political legitimacy\nrequires that coercive institutions be so structured that they accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members of the society. As long as\nthey do so they have the right to impose duties on their members. The\nmembers may not demur on the basis of unreasonable views. Furthermore,\nit is not necessary on this view that the persons over whom authority\nis wielded have voluntarily acted or given any sign of agreement. All\nthat need be the case is that the basic principles that regulate the\ncoercive institutions be ones that the reasonable members can agree to\n(Rawls 1996).\n\n\nThis view seems to be a kind of middle position between consent\ntheory and the instrumentalist views. It does not allow individuals to\ndivest themselves of obligations on spurious or merely self-interested\nbases because it specifies what is and is not a reasonable basis for\nagreement to the basic principles of the society. At the same time it\nevinces a respect for the opinions of the members of society since it\nrequires that the basic principles that regulate the society accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members.\n\n\nThis account of legitimacy is based on an adherence to a principle of\nreasonableness. The basic principle asserts that reasonable persons\nwill propose fair terms of cooperation with other reasonable persons\nonly on condition that the terms can be justified to those others on\nthe basis of premises that they can reasonably accept. There has been\nmuch discussion of this principle and its underpinnings but this entry\nwill focus on a central worry concerning this idea.\n",
