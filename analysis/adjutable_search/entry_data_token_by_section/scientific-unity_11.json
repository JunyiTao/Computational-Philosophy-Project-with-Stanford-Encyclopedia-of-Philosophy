    "main_text": "Disunity and pluralism || Pluralism\n5.2 Pluralism\n\nUnlike more descriptive accounts of plurality, pluralism is a\nnormative endorsement of plurality. The question of the metaphysical\nsignificance of disunity and anti-reductionism takes one straight to\nthe larger issue of the epistemology and metaphysics (and aesthetics,\nsocial culture and politics) of pluralism. And here one encounters the\nfamiliar issues and notions such as conceptual schemes, frameworks and\nworldviews, incommensurability, relativism, contextualism and\nperspectivalism about goals and standards of concepts and methods (for\na general discussion see Lynch 1998; on perspectivalism about\nscientific models see Giere 1999, 2006; Rueger 2005; Massimi and McCoy\n2020).\n\nIn connection with relativism and instrumentalism, pluralism has\ntypically been associated with antirealism about taxonomical\npractices. But it has been defended from the standpoint of realism\n(for instance, Dupr\u00e9 1993; Chakravartty 2011). Pluralism about\nknowledge of mind-independent facts can be formulated in terms of\ndifferent ways to distribute properties (sociability-based pluralism),\nwith more specific commitments about the ontological status of the\nrelated elements and their plural contextual manifestations of powers\nor dispositions (Chakravartty 2011; Cartwright 2007).\n\nFrom a more epistemological standpoint, pluralism applies widely to\nconcepts, explanations, virtues, goals, methods, models and kinds of\nrepresentations (see above for graphic pluralism), etc. In this sense,\npluralism has been defended as a general framework that rejects the\nideal of consensus in cognitive, evaluative and practical matters,\nagainst pure skepticism (nothing goes) or indifferentism (anything\ngoes), including a defense of preferential and contextual rationality\nthat notes the role of contextual rational commitments, by analogy\nwith political forms of engagement (Rescher 1993; van Bouwel 2009a;\nCat 2012).\n\nConsider at least four distinctions\u2014they are formulated\nabout concepts, facts, and descriptions, and they apply also to\nvalues, virtues, methods, etc.:\n\nVertical vs. horizontal pluralism. Vertical pluralism is\ninter-level pluralism, the view that there is more than one level of\nfactual description or kind of fact and that each is irreducible,\nequally fundamental, or ontologically/conceptually autonomous.\nHorizontal pluralism is intra-level pluralism, the view that there may\nbe incompatible descriptions or facts on the same level of discourse\n(Lynch 1998). For instance, the plurality of explanatory causes to be\nchosen from or integrated in biology or physics has been defended as a\nlesson in pluralism (Sober 1999).\nGlobal vs. local pluralism. Global pluralism is pluralism\nabout every type of fact or description. Global horizontal pluralism\nis the view that there may be incompatible descriptions of the same\ntype of fact. Global vertical pluralism is the view that no type of\nfact or description reduces to any other. Local horizontal and\nvertical pluralism is about one type of fact or description (Lynch\n1998). It may also concern situated standpoints informed by, among\nothers, social differences (Wylie 2015).\nDifference vs. integrative pluralism. Difference\npluralism has been defended in terms of division of labor in the face\nof complexity and cognitive limitations (Giere 2006), epistemic\nhumility (Feyerabend 1962 and his final writings in the 1990s; Chang\n2002), scientific freedom, empirical testability and theory choice\n(Popper 1935; Feyerabend 1962) and underdetermination.\n\n\nUnderdetermination arguments concern choices from a disjunction of\nequivalent types of descriptions (Mitchell 2003, 2009) or of\nincompatible partial representations or models of phenomena in the\nsame intended scope (Longino 2002, 2013). The representational\nincompatibility may be traced to competing values or aims, or\nassumptions in ceteris paribus laws.\n\nCritiques of difference pluralism point to different consequences such\nas failure to address complex and boundary phenomena and problems\nin, for instance, the life and social sciences (Gorman 2002;\nMitchell 2003; 2008); detrimental effects of taxonomic instability\n(Sullivan 2017) and so-called intraconcept variability (Cunningham\n2021) in the mind-brain sciences. When the variability characterizes\nwhat are taken to be the same concepts and terminology, several\ncontexts of detrimental effect have been identified: (1) science\neducation, (2) collaborative research, intra- and cross-disciplinary\n(e.g., the practical and moral problems of value conflicts mentioned\nabove), (3) clinical practice, and (4) metascientific research\n(Cunningham 2021).\n\nIntegrative, or connective, types of pluralism are the conjunctive or\nholistic requirement of different types of descriptions, methods or\nperspectives (Mitchell 2003, 2009; contrast with the more isolationist\nposition in Longino 2002 and her essay in Kellert, Longino and Waters\n2006; Longino 2013).\n\nTo a merely syncretistic or tolerant, non-interactive pluralism, a\nrecent body of literature has opposed a dynamic, coordinated,\ninteractive disciplinary kind of pluralism (Chang 2012; Wylie 2015;\nSullivan 2017). The former requires only respectful division of labor;\nthe latter may involve either a limited cross-fertilization through\ncommunication and assimilation\u2014borrowing or co-optation\u2014or\na more robust, integrative epistemic engagement. The latter may\ninvolve, for instance, communicative expertise\u2014also known as\ninteractional expertise\u2014without having contributory expertise\nin the other practice, exchange and collaboration on the same\nproject.\n\nBorrowing and cross-fertilization across divides and over distances\nconcern more than theories and change the respective practices,\nprocesses and products. They extend to data, concepts, models,\nmethods, evidence, heuristic techniques, technology and other\nresources. To mention one distinction, while theoretical integration\nconcerns concepts, ontology, explanations, models, etc., practical\nintegration concerns methods, heuristics and testing (Grantham 2004).\nThus, accounts including different versions of taxonomical pluralism\nrange from the more conventional and contingent (from Elgin 1997 to\nastronomical kinds in Ruphy 2016) and the more grounded in contexts of\npractices (categorization work in Bowker and Star 1999; life sciences\nand chemistry in Kendig 2016) and the interactive (Hacking\u2019s\ninteractive kinds in the human sciences) to the more metaphysically\nsubstantive. Some methodological prescriptions of pluralism rely on\npluralism in metascientific research including history (Chang\n2012).\n\nConnective varieties of pluralism have been endorsed on grounds of\ntheir epistemic value. Considerations of empirical adequacy and\npredictive power can be traced back to Neurath, the explanatory and\nmethodological value of cross-fertilization, the epistemic benefits of\na stance of openness to new kinds of facts and ways of inquiry and\nlearning (Wylie 2015) and evidential value.\n\nFrom the standpoint of evidence, we find second-order varieties of\nmixed evidence patterns\u2014triangulation, security and\nintegration\u2014that connect different kinds of evidence to provide\nenhanced evidential value. The relevant plurality or difference\nrequires independence, a condition to be explicated in different ways\n(Kuorikoski and Marchionni 2022). Regarding triangulation, enhanced\nevidence results from multiple theory-laden but theoretically\nindependent lines of evidence in, for instance, microscopy (Hacking\n1983), archeology (Wylie 1999) and interdisciplinary research in the\nsocial sciences, for example, neuroeconomics in support of existence\nclaims about phenomena and descriptions of phenomena but not to more\ngeneral theories about them (Kuorikoski and Marchionni 2016).\n\nConnective forms of pluralism have been modeled in terms of relations\nbetween disciplines (see above) and defended at the level of social\nepistemology by analogy with political models of liberal democracy and\nas a model of social governance between the extremes of so-called\nconsensual mainstreaming and antagonistic exclusivism (van Bouwel\n2009a). Through dialogue, a plurality of represented perspectives\nenables the kind of critical scrutiny of questions and knowledge\nclaims that exposes error, bias, unexamined norms of justification and\nacceptance and the complexity of issues and relevant implications. As\na result, it has been argued, pluralism supports a corresponding\nstandard of critical objectivity (Longino 2002; Wylie 2015).\n\nInternal vs. external pluralism. From a methodological\nstandpoint, an internal perspective is naturalistic in its reliance on\nthe contingent plurality of scientific practice by any of its\nstandards. This has been defended by members of the so-called\nMinnesota School (Kellert, Longino and Waters 2006) and Ruphy (2016).\nThe alternative, which Ruphy has attributed to Dupr\u00e9 and\nCartwright, is the adoption of a metaphysical commitment external to\nactual scientific practice.\n\n\nAs a matter of actual practice, pluralism has been identified as part\nof a plurality of projects and perspectives in, for instance,\ncognitive and mind-brain sciences, where attitudes towards a plurality\nof ways of researching and understanding cognition vary (Milkowski and\nHohol 2021). These attitudes include (1) lamenting the variability of\nmeaning and systems of classification (Sullivan 2007; Cunningham\n2021); (2) embracing complementarity between hierarchical mechanistic\nand computational approaches\u2014in the face of, for instance,\nmodels with propositional declarative and lawlike statements and\ncomputational models with software codes; (3) seeking integration with\nmutual consistency and evidential support; (4) seeking reduction\nprivileging neural models; and (5) seeking grand unification that\nvalues simplicity and generality over testability.\n",
