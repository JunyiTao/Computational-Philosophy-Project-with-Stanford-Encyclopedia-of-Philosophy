    "main_text": "Types of Human Dominium || Civil Dominium\n4.2 Civil Dominium\n\n\nGiven the deleterious influence civil dominium has had on the\nevangelical dominium of Christ's law, it is difficult to\nimagine how Wyclif would set aside some civil lords as capable of\ninstantiating divine justice. But apostolic poverty is not identical\nwith an absence of property ownership; it is having with love. While\nthe clergy as spiritual lords ought to follow Christ's example of\nmaterial poverty, it does not follow that all ownership precludes\nlove. God can certainly bestow grace on those whom He wills to be\nstewards of created goods. Wyclif envisions the just civil lord or\nking as the means by which the Church is relieved of its accumulated\nburden of property ownership. So long as the Church exists in\npostlapsarian society, it must be protected from thieves, heresy, and\ninfidels. Certainly no evangelical lord ought to be concerned with\nsuch matters, given their higher responsibility for the welfare of\nChristian souls. As a result, the Church needs a guardian to ward off\nenemies while caring for its own weel-being and administering alms to\nthe poor. This allows Wyclif to describe just, grace-favored civil\ndominium as different in kind from the civil lordship\npredicated on materialistic human concerns: \u201cIt is right for God to\nhave two vicars in His church, namely a king in temporal affairs, and\na priest in spiritual. The king should strongly check rebellion, as\ndid God in the Old Testament, while priests ought minister the\nprecepts mildly, as did Christ, who was at once priest and king.\u201d When\nhe raises conventional topics in political thought, like the\nparticulars of just rule, the responsibilities of royal councillors to\ntheir king, the nature of just war, and royal jurisdiction in\ncommerce, his advice is priestly: \u201c[A] lord ought not treat his\nsubjects in a way other than he would rationally wish to be treated in\nsimilar circumstances; the Christian lord should not desire subjects\nfor love of dominating, but for the correction and spiritual\nimprovement of his subjects, and so to the efficacy of the church\u201d\n(De Officio Regis ch. 1, p. 13.4\u20138). The king ought provide\nfew and just laws wisely and accurately administered, and live subject\nto these laws, since just law is more necessary for the community than\nthe king. Also, the king should strive to protect the lower classes'\nclaims on temporal goods in the interests of social order, for\n\u201cnothing is more destructive in a kingdom in its political life than\nimmoderately to deprive the lower classes of the goods of fortune\u201d\n(De Officio Regis ch. 5, p.\n 96.9\u201327).[10]\n On occasion he discusses the king's need of reliable councillors,\ngenerally when discussing the king's need for sacerdotal advice in\ndirecting church reform, but he never mentions Parliament as a\nsignificant aspect of civil rule.  \n\n\nThe most immediate concern of a civil lord living in an age when the\nChurch is being poisoned by avarice should be the radical divestment\nof all ecclesiastical ownership. Wyclif is tireless in arguing for the\nking's right to take all land and goods, and indeed, even the\nbuildings themselves, away from the Church. Should the clergy protest\nagainst royal divestment, threatening the king with excommunication or\ninterdict, the king should proceed as a physician applies his lancet\nto an infected boil. No grace-favored civil lord will be disposed to\nsave up the divested goods of the Church for his own enrichment,\ndespite the obvious temptation. He will distribute the Church's\nill-gotten lands and goods to the people. This, Wyclif explains, will\nbe his continued responsibility even after the Church has been purged,\nfor he is the Church's custodian as well as its protector.  \n\n\nThe hereditary succession by which civil lordship passes from father\nto son is a problem for Wyclif. People cannot inherit the grace needed\nto ensure just ownership and jurisdiction. Primogeniture imperils\ngrace-founded civil lordship, making lords prone to rule on behalf of\ntheir own familial interests rather than in the interests of their\nsubjects. The only means by which Wyclif can envision hereditary\nsuccession operating is through spiritual filiation, in which a civil\nlord instructs a worthy successor. He suggests adoption as the basis\nfor the spiritual primogeniture by which lordship is passed on, which\nwould be preferable to general election, for Wyclif is clear about the\nimpossibility of widespread recognition of grace in a potential civil\nlord: \u201cIt does not follow, if all the people want Peter to be their\ncivil lord, that therefore it is just\u201d (De Civili Dominio I,\n18, p. 130.6). Central to his ecclesiology is the impossibility of\ndetermining the presence of grace in another's soul, which militates\nagainst identifying members of the elect with certainty, and therefore\nagainst excommunicating any of them from the Church, as well as ruling\nout popular election as a means of instituting just civil\ndominium.  Grants in perpetuity, commonly employed by civil\nlords to guarantee the ongoing obligation of subjects in return for a\ngift of land or political authority, are as impossible as hereditary\ninheritance. A lord might reward someone with a grant while acting as\nGod's steward, but he certainly cannot thereby make his subject's\nprogeny deserve the gift.  \n",
