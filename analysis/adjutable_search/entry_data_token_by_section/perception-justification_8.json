    "main_text": "Perceptual Phenomena || Attention\n2.3 Attention\n\nStandard cases of perceptual justification are ones in which you\nattend to what you see, as when you attend to your mail and form a\njustified belief that you have mail. But are all cases of perceptual\njustification ones in which attention is involved? According to the\nAttention Needed view, only attentive experiences can provide\njustification. According to the Attention Optional view,\ninattentive experiences can provide propositional justification.\n\nIf you only experience what you attend to, as is maintained by\nphilosophers such as Prinz 2012, all cases of justification by\nexperience will trivially involve attention as well. Here we\u2019ll\npursue the issue on the assumption that we sometimes experience\nsomething we do not attend to, as is held by theorists such as Searle\n1992 and Mole 2011.\n\nTo make our discussion concrete, consider Simons and Chabris\u2019s\n(1999) famous \u201cSelective Attention Test\u201d on youtube (see\nthe link in\n Other Internet Resources).\n When subjects were asked to count passes of basketballs\u2014spoiler\nalert!\u2014a fair number failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit\nwho came into the scene. Given how hard it is to track the passes of\nbasketballs, it is natural to assume that the non-noticers were\nattending only to the basketballs, and did not attend to the person in\nthe gorilla suit. Now suppose that some of non-noticers still did\nexperience a person in a gorilla suit in the scene, as a person in a\ngorilla suit. According to the Attention Needed view, their\ninattentive experience cannot provide them with justification to\nbelieve that someone\u2019s there in a gorilla suit. According to the\nAttention Optional view, their inattentive experience might still\nprovide them with justification to believe that someone\u2019s there\nin a gorilla suit.\n\nBoth views have their attractions. Typically, if you look carelessly\nat a scene, your experience will put you in a worse epistemic position\nif you look attentively at the scene. Perhaps if attention is fully\ngone but experience remains, experience no longer provides\njustification.\n\nOn the other hand, you can have evidence you don\u2019t notice you\nhave, and this point might favor the Attention Optional view. Consider\neveryday cases of \u201cchange blindness\u201d discussed by Dretske\n2004. For example, your friend gets a haircut, and asks you \u201cdo\nI look different?\u201d You are stumped. On Dretske\u2019s account,\nyou might still have a perfectly accurately experience of how his hair\nnow looks. Here your experience plausibly gives you justification to\nbelieve that your friend got a haircut (when combined with your\nbackground beliefs). You also fail to notice that your experience\ngives you justification to believe your friend got a haircut. If\nexperiences provide un-noticed evidence, such cases are arguably good\nprecedents for the sorts of cases allowed by the Attention Optional\nview. (For striking cases of change blindness, see the link in\n Other Internet Resources.)\n\nFor further discussion of the potential epistemic roles of attention,\nsee Campbell 2002, 2011; Roessler 2011; Smithies 2011; Wu 2014; and\nSilins and Siegel 2014.\n",
