    "main_text": "Defining Expected Utility || Conditional Probabilities\n1.1 Conditional Probabilities\n\n\nThe term \\(P_{A}(o)\\) represents the probability\nof \\(o\\) given \\(A\\)\u2014roughly, how likely it is that\noutcome \\(o\\) will occur, on the supposition that the agent\nchooses act \\(A\\). (For the axioms of probability, see the entry\non \n interpretations of probability.)\n To understand what this means, we\nmust answer two questions. First, which interpretation of probability\nis appropriate? And second, what does it mean to assign a probability\non the supposition that the agent chooses act \\(A\\)?\n\n\nExpected utility theorists often interpret probability as measuring\nindividual degree of belief, so that a proposition \\(E\\) is likely\n(for an agent) to the extent that that agent is confident of \\(E\\)\n(see, for instance, Ramsey 1926, Savage 1972, Jeffrey 1983). But\nnothing in the formalism of expected utility theory forces this\ninterpretation on us. We could instead interpret probabilities as\nobjective chances (as in von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944), or as the\ndegrees of belief that are warranted by the evidence, if we thought\nthese were a better guide to rational action. (See the entry on\n interpretations of probability\n for discussion of these and other options.)\n\n\nWhat is it to have a probability on the supposition that the agent\nchooses \\(A\\)? Here, there are two basic types of answer,\ncorresponding to evidential decision theory and causal decision\ntheory.\n\n\nAccording to evidential decision theory, endorsed by Jeffrey (1983),\nthe relevant suppositional probability \\(P_{A}(o)\\)\nis the conditional probability \n\\(P(o \\mid A)\\), \ndefined as the ratio of two unconditional probabilities:\n\\(P(A \\amp o) / P(A)\\).\n\n\nAgainst Jeffrey\u2019s definition of expected utility, Spohn (1977)\nand Levi (1991) object that a decision-maker should not assign\nprobabilities to the very acts under deliberation: when freely deciding\nwhether to perform an act \\(A\\), you shouldn\u2019t take into\naccount your beliefs about whether you will perform \\(A\\). \nIf Spohn and Levi are right, then Jeffrey\u2019s ratio is undefined\n(since its denominator is undefined).\n\n\nNozick (1969) raises another objection: Jeffrey\u2019s definition gives\nstrange results in the Newcomb Problem. A predictor\nhands you a closed box, containing either $0 or $1 million, and offers\nyou an open box, containing an additional $1,000. You can either\nrefuse the open box (\u201cone-box\u201d) or take the open box\n(\u201ctwo-box\u201d). But there\u2019s a catch: the predictor\nhas predicted your choice beforehand, and all her predictions are 90%\naccurate. In other words, the probability that you one-box, given\nthat she predicts you one-box, is 90%, and the probability that you\ntwo-box, given that she predicts you two-box, is 90%. Finally,\nthe contents of the closed box depend on the prediction: if the\npredictor thought you would two-box, she put nothing in the closed box,\nwhile if she thought you would one-box, she put $1 million in the\nclosed box. The matrix for your decision looks like this:\n\n\n\nstates\n\n\n$1 million in closed box\n$0 in closed box\n\n\nacts\none-box\n$1,000,000\n$0\n\n\ntwo-box\n$1,001,000\n$1,000\n\n\n\n\nTwo-boxing dominates one-boxing: in every state, two-boxing\nyields a better outcome. Yet on Jeffrey\u2019s definition of conditional\nprobability, one-boxing has a higher expected utility than\ntwo-boxing. There is a high conditional probability of finding $1\nmillion is in the closed box, given that you one-box, so one-boxing\nhas a high expected utility. Likewise, there is a high conditional\nprobability of finding nothing in the closed box, given that you\ntwo-box, so two-boxing has a low expected utility.\n\nCausal decision theory is an\nalternative proposal that gets around these problems. It does not\nrequire (but still permits) acts to have probabilities, and it\nrecommends two-boxing in the Newcomb problem.\n\n\nCausal decision theory comes in many varieties, but I\u2019ll consider a\nrepresentative version proposed by Savage (1972), which calculates\n\\(P_{A}(o)\\) by summing the probabilities of states that, when\ncombined with the act \\(A\\), lead to the outcome \\(o\\). Let\n\\(f_{A,s}(o)\\) be a of outcomes, which maps \\(o\\) to 1 if \\(o\\)\nresults from performing \\(A\\) in state s, maps \\(o\\) to 0\notherwise. Then\n\n\\[\nP_{A}(o) = \\sum_{s\\in S}P(s)f_{A,s}(o)\n\\]\n\n\n\nOn Savage\u2019s proposal, two-boxing comes out with a higher\nexpected utility than one-boxing. This result holds no matter\nwhich probabilities you assign to the states prior to your\ndecision. Let \\(x\\) be the probability you assign to the\nstate that the closed box contains $1 million. According to\nSavage, the expected utilities of one-boxing and two-boxing,\nrespectively, are:\n\n\\[\nx {\\cdot} U({$1,000,000}) + (1 - x) {\\cdot} U($0)\n\\]\n\n\n\nand\n\n\\[\nx {\\cdot} U({$1,001,000}) + (1 - x) {\\cdot} U({$1,000})\n\\]\n\n\n\nAs long as the larger monetary amounts are assigned strictly larger\nutilities, the second sum (the utility of two-boxing) is guaranteed to\nbe larger than the first (the utility of one-boxing).\n\n\n\nSavage assumes that each act and state are enough to uniquely\ndetermine an outcome. But there are cases where this assumption\nbreaks down. Suppose you offer to sell me the following gamble:\nyou will toss a coin; if the coin lands heads, I win $100; and if the\ncoin lands tails, I lose $100. But I refuse the gamble, and the\ncoin is never tossed. There is no outcome that would\nhave resulted, had the coin been tossed\u2014I might have won $100,\nand I might have lost $100.\n\n\nWe can generalze Savage\u2019s proposal by letting \\(f_{A,s}\\) be a\nprobability function that maps outcomes to real numbers in the \\([0,\n1]\\) interval. Lewis (1981), Skyrms (1980), and Sobel (1994) equate\n\\(f_{A,s}\\) with the objective chance that \\(o\\) would be the outcome\nif state \\(s\\) obtained and the agent chose action \\(A\\).\n\n\nIn some cases\u2014most famously the Newcomb problem\u2014the\nJeffrey definition and the Savage definition of expected utility come\napart. But whenever the following two conditions are satisfied,\nthey agree.\n\nActs are\nprobabilistically independent of states. In formal terms, for all\nacts \\(A\\) and states \\(s\\), \n\\[\nP(s) = P(s \\mid A) = \\frac{P(s \\amp A)}{P(A)}.\n\\]\n(This is the condition that is violated in the Newcomb problem.)\nFor all outcomes\n\\(o\\), acts \\(A\\), and states \\(s\\),\n\\(f_{A,s}(o)\\) is equal to the conditional\nprobability of \\(o\\) given \\(A\\) and \\(s\\); in formal\nterms, \n\\[\nf_{A,s}(o) = P(o \\mid A \\amp s) = \\frac{P(o \\amp A \\amp s)}{P(A \\amp s)}.\\]\n\n(The need for this condition arises when acts and states fail to\nuniquely determine an outcome; see Lewis 1981.)\n\n",
