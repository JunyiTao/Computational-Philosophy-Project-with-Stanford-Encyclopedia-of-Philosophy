    "main_text": "\n\nPacifism is a commitment to peace and opposition to war. Our ordinary\nlanguage allows a diverse set of beliefs and commitments to be held\ntogether under the general rubric of pacifism. This article will\nexplain the family resemblance among the variety of pacifisms. It will\nlocate pacifism within deontological and consequentialist approaches\nto ethics. It will consider diverse cultural and religious sources of\npacifism. And it will consider and reply to objections to\npacifism.\n\nThe word \u201cpacifism\u201d is derived from the word\n\u201cpacific,\u201d which means \u201cpeace making\u201d [Latin,\npaci- (from pax) meaning \u201cpeace\u201d and\n-ficus meaning \u201cmaking\u201d]. Modern usage has been\ntraced to 1901 and \u00c9mile Artaud\u2019s usage of the French\nterm pacifisme. But the basic commitment to peace is an old\nidea. Pacifist sentiment can be found, for example, in the West in\nearly Christianity. Perhaps the most famous use of the word pacifism\nis found in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), where Jesus\nclaims that the \u201cpeacemakers\u201d are blessed. In this\npassage, the Greek word eirenopoios is translated into Latin\nas pacifici, which means those who work for peace. The Greek\neirenopoios is derived from the Greek\neir\u00ean\u00ea [peace] in conjunction with\npoiesis [to make].\n\nPhilosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept by\ndistinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a\nnarrower anti-war position. A related term,\n\u201cnonviolentism,\u201d has been coined by Holmes (Holmes 2013:\n157), to describe a position that goes beyond anti-war pacifism in its\nopposition to violence in all of its forms. Pacifism has often been\ndefined dialectically in relation to the idea of justified violence\nthat is found in the Western just war\n tradition.[1]\n Pacifism is often located on a continuum for assessing the morality\nof war that includes realism, just war theory, and pacifism. The\nfundamental question here is \u201ccan war be justified?\u201d (see\nFiala and Kling, 2023). Indeed, there is an ongoing debate about the\nproper relation between just war theory and pacifism that focuses on\nthe question of whether the just war theory begins with a pacifist\npresumption against war. Some authors have used the just war theory to\nderive a version of pacifism described as \u201ccontingent\npacifism\u201d (May 2015, for example) or \u201cjust war\npacifism\u201d (Sterba 1998). Authors such as Cheyney Ryan and Robert\nHolmes more strongly maintain that the just war framework is flawed.\nHolmes argues that the just war tradition typically ignores the\ncentral moral issue in war, which is about the presumptive immorality\nof the \u201cmassive, systematic and deliberate killing of human\nbeings\u201d that occurs in war (Holmes 2017a: xvii). Ryan argues\nthat although the just war tradition and pacifism developed through\n\u201cmutual critique\u201d pacifism has often been marginalized as\nan \u201coutcast tradition\u201d (Ryan 2017: 125). And yet, the\n\u201cpacifist tradition\u201d includes a robust historical dialogue\ninvolving important authors and movements (Fiala 2018b; Fiala and\nKling 2023).\n\nSome have tried to distinguish \u201cpacific-ism\u201d from\npacifism, where pacific-ism is a commitment to peace and peacefulness\nthat is not strictly opposed to war while pacifism is a more\nprincipled or absolute rejection of violence. But this distinction is\nnot widely accepted (although Dower 2009 employed it). William James\nused the term \u201cpacific-ism\u201d in 1910 to describe his\nrejection of militarism (James 1910). The shorter term,\n\u201cpacifism,\u201d has become more common in English usage to\ndescribe a variety of views that are critical of war.\n\nGenerally pacifism is thought to be a principled rejection of war and\nkilling. Oddly enough, terminology related to pacifism has\noccasionally been used to describe a pragmatic commitment to using war\nto create peace. Thus a term like \u201cpacification\u201d can be\nemployed in military usage to describe a violent process of\nsuppressing violence, as when an enemy territory is\n\u201cpacified\u201d by killing or disabling the enemy. While George\nOrwell (2002) complained about such euphemistic descriptions of\nviolence, the just war tradition does hold that war can be a suitable\nmeans to bring about peace. Despite these complications, pacifism\ngenerally connotes a commitment to making peace that rejects violent\nmeans for obtaining this end. One reason to reject violent means is\nthe fact that might does not make right. While violence can destroy an\nenemy, victory does not amount to justification.\n\nPacifism, as it is understood in ordinary discourse today, includes a\nvariety of commitments on a continuum from an absolute adherence to\nnonviolence in all actions to a more focused or minimal sort of\nanti-warism. In contrast to the just war tradition, pacifism rejects\nwar as an acceptable means for obtaining peace. Pacifists will often\nrefuse to serve in the military. And some refuse to support political\nand social systems that promote war by, for example, withholding their\ntaxes. Pacifists have been associated with quietistic withdrawal from\npolitical life and even outright anarchism. But pacifists need not be\n\u201cpassive\u201d: many committed pacifists have been actively\ninvolved in nonviolent social protest. Pacifism can be used to\ndescribe a commitment to nonviolence in one\u2019s personal life that\nmight include the attempt to cultivate pacific virtues such as\ntolerance, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and love. It might also be\nextended to include nonviolence toward all sentient beings and thus\nresult in a commitment to vegetarianism and what Albert Schweitzer\n(1967) called, \u201creverence for life.\u201d Pacifism can be\nconnected to a larger project of spiritual transformation, as in\nGandhi\u2019s commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence. And as the author\nof the present entry has argued, pacifism can be understood as\noffering a comprehensive normative framework (Fiala 2018a).\n",
