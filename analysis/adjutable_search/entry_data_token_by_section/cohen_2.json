The Transcendental Method\n\nSo Cohen takes the theories of mathematical natural science to be (or\nto be paradigms of) \u201cexperience.\u201d And he takes the\nfundamental concepts and laws of those theories to be the a priori\nlaws that constitute experience\u2019s possibility. Why?\n\nFor Cohen, these distinctive views are consequences of his\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s philosophical method. Cohen and his\nstudents, Paul Natorp and Ernst Cassirer, would take this\nphilosophical method to be the defining characteristic of\nCohen\u2019s Kantianism, rather than any of Kant\u2019s particular\narguments or doctrines (Cassirer 2005 [1912], 115; Natorp 1912,\n194\u20135). As Cohen himself puts it, \u201c[p]hilosophy is not\n\u2018doctrine\u2019, but critique\u201d (Cohen 1885, 577), and it\nis above all the Kantian philosophical method that distinguishes\nCohen\u2019s philosophy from pre-critical philosophy.\n\nWe can see Cohen\u2019s view of philosophical method in its nascent\nform emerge from his interpretation of Kant\u2019s Analytic of\nPrinciples and the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics.\nHowever, Cohen would articulate the method clearly only much later, in\nhis mature writing. Only later would Cohen (and his students) call it\nthe \u201ctranscendental method.\u201d (See Luft 2015, Ch. 1.5 for a\nthorough discussion of the transcendental method.)\n\nAccording to Cohen, for Kant mathematical natural science is the\nstarting-point of philosophical investigation. It is the explanandum\nthat Kantian philosophy seeks to explain. It is then up to philosophy\nto identify and articulate the a priori laws in that experience that\nare responsible for making it objective. If it is less than obvious\nthat this is Kant\u2019s method in the Critique of Pure\nReason, Cohen insists, it is at least clear in the\nProlegomena. There, Kant is explicit that he begins by\nassuming that mathematical natural science provides us with genuine\nobjective knowledge, and that it contains synthetic a priori\nprinciples; Kant is likewise explicit that his task is to identify the\nnecessary conditions of those principles\u2019 possibility, and that\ndoing so will explain the objectivity of mathematical natural science.\n(Kant is also explicit that this method, which in the\nProlegomena he calls the \u2018analytic method,\u2019 is\nnot the method he uses in the Critique of Pure Reason, nor\nwould it be suitable for the full project of the Critique.\nCohen seems cheerfully undaunted by this textual anomaly.) (See Rendl\n2018 for discussion of Cohen\u2019s motivations for taking the\nanalytic method of the Prolegomena as his guide.) \n\nTaking Kant\u2019s method in the Prolegomena as his guide,\nCohen claims that the method of Kantian philosophy is this. He thinks\nphilosophy takes the theories of mathematical natural science as its\nstarting point. It begins, as he puts it, with the \u201cfact of\nmathematical natural science\u201d (Cohen 1883, 119\u2013120).\nAlthough Cohen does not emphasize it in the first edition of\nKant\u2019s Theory of Experience, he thinks (and it is\nconsistent with his views) that this \u201cfact of science\u201d\nchanges as science progresses. On the transcendental method, the\nphilosopher takes the best physical theories of the day as her\nstarting point, and thus the \u201cfact of science\u201d will be\ndifferent for philosophers in different periods of the history of\nscience.\n\nFurther, Cohen identifies the a priori of his third level, the laws of\nmathematical natural science, with the synthetic a priori principles\nKant thinks mathematical natural science contains. Cohen says of these\nsynthetic a priori principles that they are \u201cthat which is\npresent\u201d in experience (Cohen 1987 [1871b], 206). So philosophy\nseeks to explain the possibility of experience by identifying and\narticulating the a priori laws \u201cpresent\u201d in it. As Cohen\nwould later put it, experience, conceived as the evolving doctrines of\nmathematical natural science, is \u201cgiven as a task\u201d\n[aufgegeben] to philosophy: while experience is given with\nsynthetic a priori principles already contained in it, it is the task\nof philosophy to identify and articulate those principles, and in so\ndoing to explain how they make objective experience possible.\n\nIt can be difficult to see how this method allows for any\nphilosophically critical evaluation of theories in the history of\nscience \u2013 a kind of evaluation Cohen never shies away from. On\nthe transcendental method, philosophy does not seek philosophical\ngrounds for casting doubt on or rejecting mathematical or scientific\ntheories. Rather, it starts by taking those theories and their\nobjectivity for granted. It starts with them as facts, as\nexplananda in need of philosophical explanation. But Cohen often\ncriticizes and rejects theories he does not like, and does so for\napparently philosophical reasons. This is especially clear in the\nhistorical sections of his 1883 Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod and its History, where Cohen uses apparently philosophical\nprinciples to criticize and reject various efforts in the history of\nmathematics to define, for example, limits and infinitesimals. But\nCohen\u2019s criticisms do not violate the transcendental method. The\nprinciples that serve as the basis for his criticisms emerge from a\nphilosophical investigation of theories given in the history of\nscience. They are thus principles that turn out to be required for the\nphilosophical explanation of those theories and their objectivity.\n\nCohen\u2019s colleague at Marburg, Natorp, would emphasize a major\nadvantage of the transcendental method for Cohen (Natorp 1912,\n196\u20137). This method allows Cohen to avoid what he and his\nstudents took to be the two major errors of other post-Kantian\nphilosophy. First, because Cohen sought to explain the possibility of\nexperience by appeal to a priori laws in it, he avoided the\nphysiologically-oriented psychologism of Helmholtz and Lange, among\nothers. But second, the transcendental method anchors Kantian\nphilosophy to mathematical natural science as its starting point. This\nanchor prevents philosophy from taking off on the speculative,\nmetaphysical flights of fancy that, in the minds of many Kantian\nphilosophers in the 1860s and 1870s, decisively undermined the\nIdealist Naturphilosophie of the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury. For Cohen and his students, the transcendental method thus\nmakes possible a philosophy that is properly scientific, without\nabsorbing it completely into physiology and psychology.\n",
