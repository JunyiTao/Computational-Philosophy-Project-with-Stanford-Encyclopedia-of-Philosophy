    "main_text": "\n\nThe nonidentity problem raises questions regarding the obligations we\nthink we have in respect of people who, by our own acts, are caused\nboth to exist and to have existences that are, though worth having,\nunavoidably flawed \u2013 existences, that is, that are flawed if\nthose people are ever to have them at all. If a person\u2019s\nexistence is unavoidably flawed, then the agent\u2019s only\nalternatives to bringing that person into the flawed existence are to\nbring no one into existence at all or to bring a different person\n\u2013 a nonidentical but better off person \u2013 into\nexistence in place of the one person. If the existence is worth having\nand no one else\u2019s interests are at stake, it is unclear on what\nground morality would insist that the choice to bring the one person\ninto the flawed existence is morally wrong. And yet at the same time\n\u2013 as we shall see \u2013 it seems that in some cases such a\nchoice clearly is morally wrong. The nonidentity problem is\nthe problem of resolving this apparent paradox.\n\nThe problem raises the question whether the (usually significant) good\nthat an agent confers along with existence counterbalances the\n(usually limited) bad that an agent confers along with any unavoidably\nflawed existence in such a way that our existence-inducing\nact (usually) will be deemed permissible. And if it isn\u2019t\n\u2013 if we think instead that obligations are left unsatisfied\ndespite the good that comes with existence \u2013 is the moral of the\nstory that moral obligation extends beyond making things\nbetter for people? If we agree, in other words, that it is\nour obligation to create additional good, is it enough that we create\nadditional good for each and every existing and future\nperson? Or does the nonidentity problem show that our obligations\nextend as well to the creation of additional good for merely\npossible people as well \u2013 or, more generally, for the\nuniverse? As we query how to evaluate existence-inducing acts for\ntheir moral permissibility \u2013 and perhaps, as a prior matter, how\nto determine whether one outcome, or possible future or\nworld, is better, all things considered, than an alternate\nworld \u2013 we find that some of our most deeply held intuitions\nregarding the nature and structure of morality are thrown into doubt.\n\n",
