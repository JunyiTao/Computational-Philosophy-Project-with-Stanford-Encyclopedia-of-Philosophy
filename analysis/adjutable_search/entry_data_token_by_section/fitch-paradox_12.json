    "main_text": "Semantic Restrictions || Problems for Non-Rigidity\n4.4 Problems for Non-Rigidity\n\nWilliamson (2000b) defends Fitch\u2019s reasoning against Kvanvig\u2019s charge.\nHe suggests that Kvanvig has no grounds for thinking that Fitch\u2019s\nconjunction \\(p \\wedge \\neg \\exists x\\exists t(Kxpt)\\) does not\ndesignate rigidly. The reason Williamson gives is this. An expression\nis non-rigid if, when uttered in a fixed context, it varies its\nreference with the circumstances under which it is evaluated. But\nKvanvig gives no convincing reason for thinking that Fitch\u2019s\nconjunction, as uttered in a fixed context, varies its reference in\nthis way. At best Kvanvig has shown that the conjunction varies its\nreference when uttered in varying contexts, since his\nargument is that a quantified sentence, when uttered at different\nworlds, will be about different objects. To think that this is\nsufficient for non-rigidity, Williamson complains, is to confuse\nnon-rigidity for indexicality. Importantly, indexicality does not\nimply non-rigidity. For instance, \u2018I am tired\u2019 is about\nme, and continues to be about me when I evaluate its truth-value in\ncounterfactual circumstances. The sentence might have been false. Had\nI gotten enough sleep, I would not be tired. Uttered in a fixed\ncontext, \u2018I\u2019 rigidly designates, even though it is an\nindexical. That is, even though, had it been uttered in a different\ncontext by somebody else, it would have been about somebody other than\nme. Analogously, even if quantified expressions are indexicals, it\ndoes not follow that they are non-rigid. And so, even if Fitch\u2019s\nconjunction is an indexical expression, we have not been given a\nreason to think that it is non-rigid. If this is correct, then we have\nno grounds for thinking that Fitch has committed the modal fallacy in\nquestion.\n\nKvanvig (2006) replies and develops other interesting themes in the\nKnowability Paradox, which is the only monograph to date\ndedicated to the topic.\n",
