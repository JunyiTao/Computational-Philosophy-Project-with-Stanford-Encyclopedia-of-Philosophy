On the other hand, if Ben desires a new pair of skates, then his\ndesire is not likely to be manifest all the time. A new pair of skates\nis something Ben might well desire for two or three months before\ngetting a new pair, and it is unlikely that his desire will be\nmanifesting itself for that entire time. More likely, Ben's\ndesire will lie quietly \u201cin the back of his mind\u201d most of\nthe time, and occasionally generate thoughts, feelings, and actions of\nthe familiar sorts.\n\n\nStanding desires are desires one has that are not playing any role\nin one's psyche at the moment. Occurrent desires, on the other\nhand, are desires that are playing some role in one's\npsyche at the moment. Notice here that occurrent desires need not be in\ncontrol of one's actions: my desire to laze in bed is occurrent\neven while I am getting up and making breakfast, for my desire is\nleading me to think longingly of bed, and is perhaps acting upon my\nmechanisms of action production in a way that would lead me back to bed\nif only I did not also desire to get some things done. Desires of which\none is not aware, but which are current causes of one's behavior,\nare also occurrent on this way of thinking about things: a desire for a\nnew inkstand might cause one to move clumsily so as to destroy\none's current inkstand without affecting one's thoughts or\nfeelings, and if so it would be occurrent at the moment of\nclumsiness.\n\n\nSome philosophers hold that only occurrent desires are real desires.\nSo-called standing desires are really just dispositions to generate\ndesires, on this way of thinking. One difficulty for this position is\nthat standing desires seem to be good components of causal explanations\nof various mental processes. For instance: why does the new tin of tea\non the counter of her boyfriend's kitchen catch Nora's\nattention? It might be that it caught her attention because she has a\nstanding desire to know about the tea that is available to her, and the\ntin in her boyfriend's kitchen is relevant to this desire. Why is\nNora delighted to see the tin? Because she has a standing desire to try\nnew kinds of tea, and she has just seen that the tin contains a new\nkind of tea. And so on. The ground of the disposition to generate\noccurrent desires can do for these sorts of explanations, but it is\ntruer to ordinary thinking about the mind to say that this ground just\nis a desire\u2014a standing desire\u2014than to say that it is\nanything else.\n\n\nSome philosophers hold that all occurrent desires are elements of\none's conscious life. Just as I have a capacity to see red that\nis not exercised until seeing red is an element of my consciousness, so\ntoo I have a capacity to desire that my French be fluent, and this\ncapacity is not exercised until desiring that my French be fluent is an\nelement of my consciousness. Notice that the thesis is not just that\ndesires are only sometimes objects of one's conscious life. That\nis, the thesis is not merely that I am only sometimes conscious of my\ndesires in the same way that I am only sometimes conscious of my toes.\nRather, the thesis in question is that there is a qualitative character\nto desire, a qualitative character that can be an element, feature, or\naspect of one's consciousness. Any philosopher holding that\ndesires are constituted by pleasures or seemings might well take this\nposition (e.g., Oddie 2005; Stampe 1987; Strawson 1994). Against it the\nargument has been made that the direction of fit of desire is\nincompatible with the direction of fit of elements of consciousness, on\nthe grounds that desires (roughly) say how things should be while\nconsciousness (roughly) says how things are (Hulse, Read, and Schroeder\n2004).\n",
