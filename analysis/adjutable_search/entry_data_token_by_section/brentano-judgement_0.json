An Outline of Brentano\u2019s Theory\n\nIn this section, we start with an overview of Brentano\u2019s theory\nof judgement, as far as it is contained in the first edition of the\n Psychology.[2]\n It will be convenient to divide the material covered by Brentano in\nchapter 7 of this work (and the final section of chapter 6) into four\nparts. The first part tries to establish the fundamental difference\nbetween judgements (Urteile) and presentations\n(Vorstellungen); the second part pertains to the relation\nbetween judgement and truth; the third part deals with existential\njudgements and their intentional objects; and the fourth part proposes\na reduction of categorical and hypothetical judgements to the\nexistential form.\n",
