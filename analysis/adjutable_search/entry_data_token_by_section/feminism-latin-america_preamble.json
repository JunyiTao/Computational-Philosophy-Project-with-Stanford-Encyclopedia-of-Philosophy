    "main_text": "\n\nLatin American feminism, which in this entry includes Caribbean\nfeminism, is rooted in the social and political context defined by\ncolonialism, the enslavement of African peoples, and the\nmarginalization of Native peoples. Latin American feminism focuses on\nthe critical work that women have undertaken in reaction to the forces\nthat created this context. At present, the context is dominated by\nneoliberal economic policies that, in the environment of\nglobalization, have disproportionally impacted the most vulnerable\nsegments of society. Against this political backdrop, Latin American\nfeminism is grounded in the material lives of people, often women, as\nit explores the tensions engendered by the confluence of histories\nthat generate relationships among gender, citizenship, race/ethnicity,\nsexuality, class, community, and religion.\n\nLatin American feminism broadly encompasses multiple positions, many\nof which are in tension with each other. As a result, many refer to\nLatin American \u201cfeminisms\u201d in the plural. The diversity of\nfeminisms is owed to the various regions and their histories which\ndemanded social, cultural, governmental, and organizational\ntransformations in their own capacities. Hence, the present discussion\nof the general concept of Latin American feminism methodologically\nnecessitates historical sensitivity to apprehend the intimate\nrelationship between the development of different ideas and the\nheterogeneous political conditions that give rise to them.\n\nIn the United States, tracing the history of Latin American feminism\nand its ideas is an urgent task. While growing interest in the broader\nLatin American philosophy calls for increased textual representation\nand access, the role that women have played in the evolution of Latin\nAmerican philosophical ideas has been largely neglected. Yet, there\nexists a wealth of critical feminist ideas for theories of identity,\npolitics, and culture.\n",
