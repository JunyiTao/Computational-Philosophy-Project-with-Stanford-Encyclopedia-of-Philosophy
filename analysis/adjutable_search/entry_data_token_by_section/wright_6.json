    "main_text": "Cosmology and Argument Against Natural Theology\n5. Consciousness, Evolution, and Philosophy\n\n\nWright's philosophical position is a type of naturalism, though not a\nnaturalism endorsed by most twentieth century philosophers who have\nused that term. Given his view of philosophy, he resisted skepticism,\nidealism, and realism, regarding them all as defects of\nthought. Nevertheless, compared to twentieth century philosophies of\nscience, his own philosophy of science is decidedly realist. He\nbelieved scientists discover structures and features of natural\nthings, and previously unknown hidden entities, as well as phenomenal\nlaws that govern the behavior of natural things. In this respect, his\npositivism is methodological and precautionary, a preparation for\nscientific realism. In treating the origin of consciousness, he said\nthat idealism and natural realism are the two philosophical positions\nto issue from taking sense data and emotions as the primarily real. In\nidealism, the conscious subject is immediately known through his\nperceptions, i.e., the phenomena, and the existence of an external\nworld can only be an inference from the phenomena known to belong to\nthe self (PD 230). He rejected this but also rejected natural\nrealism, which holds that \u201cboth the subject and object are\nabsolutely, immediately, and equally known through their essential\nattributes in perception.\u201d This view, he says, \u201cis more\nthan an unlearned jury are competent to say\u201d (PD\n231).\n\n\nAccording to Wright, the immediacy of sensible qualities to\nconsciousness entails that there is no way to separate subject and\nobject in consciousness. But, he continued:\nAll states of consciousness are, it is true, referred to\none or the other, or partly to each of the two worlds [subject and\nobject]; and this attribution is, in part at least, instinctive, yet\nnot independent of all experience, since it comes either from the\ndirect observation of our progenitors, or, possibly, through the\nnatural selection of them; that is, possibly through the survival of\nthose who rightly divided the worlds, and did not often mistake a real\ndanger for a dream or for an imagined peril, nor often mistake a dream\nof security for reality. If. . . we mean by immediacy such an\ninstinctive attribution, independent of repeated connections of\nattributes in their subject through the individual's own experiences,\nthen \u201cnatural realism\u201d is most in accordance with our view.\n(PD 231)\n In this quotation, Wright suggests that the division of subject\nfrom object may constitute \u201crightly dividing the world\u201d as\nindexed by survival value. A division made in these terms, rather than\nby an individual's experiences of himself and the world, is a\nreasonable basis for natural realism. Wright's view in this passage is\nconsistent with the position of Hume that human beings by nature make\nconnections between ideas and the world and that skepticism about\nthese connections is useless and idle. In this regard, Wright's\nposition anticipates that of P.F.  Strawson, a twentieth-century\nlogical analyst. Strawson said our beliefs, e.g., in the existence of\nbodies, \u201care not grounded beliefs and at the same time are not\nopen to serious doubt\u201d (Strawson 1985, 19). Wright here\narticulates a similar point couched in terms of natural selection of\nbeliefs. Also like Strawson, Wright took for some purposes ordinary\nexperience as what is primarily real, while for other purposes he took\nthe entities and properties given in physical theory as the real. This\npluralistic approach came from Wright's acceptance of different levels\nof experience as equally valid starting points for science. Also\nevident in this passage, however, is the way Wright made biological\nevolution the basis for all other accounts of nature and human\npsychology. In this respect, his approach is a forerunner of John\nDewey's philosophy of nature.\n",
