    "main_text": "Welfare-Based Principles\n5. Welfare-Based Principles\n\nWelfare-based principles are motivated by the idea that what is of\nprimary moral importance is the level of welfare of people. Advocates\nof welfare-based principles view the concerns of other \ntheories\u2014material equality, the level of primary goods of the least\nadvantaged, resources, desert-claims, or liberty\u2014as derivative\nconcerns. They are valuable only in so far as they affect welfare and\nso all distributive questions should be settled entirely by how the\ndistribution affects welfare.\n\nChoosing welfare as the relevant value is only the first step towards\nanswering the distributive questions. Welfare-theorists must also\nspecify the welfare function. The welfare functions proposed vary\naccording to what will count as welfare and the weighting system for\nthat welfare. Economists defending some form of welfarism normally\nstate the explicit functional form, while philosophers often omit this\nformality, concentrating on developing their theories in answer to two\nquestions: 1) the question of what has intrinsic value (\u2018what\ncounts as welfare\u2019), and 2) the question of what actions or\npolicies would maximize the intrinsic value. Moreover, philosophers\nhave tended to focus on an extremely small subset of the available\nwelfare functions. Although there are a number of advocates of\nalternative welfare functions (such as \u2018equality of\nwell-being\u2019), most philosophical activity has concentrated on a\nvariant known as utilitarianism. This theory can be used to illustrate\nmost of the main characteristics of welfare-based principles.\n\nHistorically, utilitarians have used the term \u2018utility\u2019\nrather than \u2018welfare\u2019 and utility has been defined\nvariously as pleasure, happiness, or preference-satisfaction, etc.\nJeremy Bentham, the historical father of utilitarianism, argued that\nthe experience of pleasure was the only thing with intrinsic value,\nand all other things had instrumental value insofar as they contribute\nto the experience of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. His\nintellectual successor, John Stuart Mill, broadened this theory of\nintrinsic value to include happiness, or fulfillment. Modern\nphilosophers since Kenneth Arrow, though, tend to argue that intrinsic\nvalue consists in preference-satisfaction, i.e. in individuals\u2019\nhaving what they want. So, for instance, the principle for\ndistributing economic benefits for preference utilitarians is to\ndistribute them so as to maximize preference-satisfaction. The welfare\nfunction for such a principle has a relatively simple theoretical form\nrequiring the distribution maximizing the arithmetic sum of all\nsatisfied preferences (unsatisfied preferences being negative),\nweighted for the intensity of those preferences. To accommodate\nuncertainty with respect to outcomes the function is modified so that\nexpected utility, rather than utility, is maximized (see\n consequentialism).\n \n\nThe basic theory of utilitarianism is one of the simplest to state and\nunderstand. Much of the work on the theory therefore has been directed\ntowards defending it against moral criticisms, particularly from the\npoint of view of \u2018commonsense\u2019 morality. The criticisms\nand responses have been widely discussed in the literature on\nutilitarianism as a general moral theory (see\n consequentialism).\n Two of the most widely discussed criticisms will be mentioned\nhere.\n\nThe first, which was famously articulated by John Rawls (1971), is\nthat utilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinctness of\npersons. Maximization of preference-satisfaction is often taken as\nprudent in the case of individuals\u2014people may take on greater\nburdens, suffering or sacrifice at certain periods of their lives so\nthat their lives are overall better. The complaint against\nutilitarianism is that it takes this principle, commonly described as\nprudent for individuals, and uses it on an entity, society, unlike\nindividuals in important ways. While it may be acceptable for a person\nto choose to suffer at some period in her life (be it a day, or a\nnumber of years) so that her overall life is better, it is often\nargued against utilitarianism that it is immoral to make some people\nsuffer so that there is a net gain for other people. In the individual\ncase, there is a single entity experiencing both the sacrifice and the\ngain. Also, the individuals, who suffer or make the sacrifices, choose\nto do so in order to gain some benefit they deem worth their\nsacrifice. In the case of society as a whole, there is no single\nexperiential entity\u2014some people suffer or are sacrificed so\nthat others may gain. Furthermore, under utilitarianism, unlike the\nindividual prudence case, there is no requirement for people to\nconsent to the suffering or sacrifice, nor is there necessarily a\nunified belief in the society that the outcome is worth the cost.\n\nA related criticism of utilitarianism involves the way it treats\nindividual preferences about other peoples\u2019 welfare or holdings.\nFor instance, some people may have a preference that the members of\nsome minority racial group have less material benefits. Under\nutilitarian theories, in their classical form, this preference or\ninterest counts like any other in determining the best distribution.\nHence, if racial preferences are widespread and are not outweighed by\nthe minority\u2019s contrary preferences (perhaps because the\nminority is relatively few in number compared to the majority),\nutilitarianism will recommend an inegalitarian distribution based on\nrace if there is not some other utility-maximizing alternative on\noffer.\n\nUtilitarians have responded to these criticisms in a number of ways.\nOften they just deny the empirical claim upon which the criticism\nrests. So they assert that the empirical conditions are such that\nutility maximizing will rarely require racial minorities to sacrifice\nor suffer for the benefit of others, or to satisfy the prejudices of\nothers. Relatedly, utilitarians often emphasize the long run\nperspective required by their theory. They may concede that short-term\nmaximization may point to distribution on a racial basis but that this\nwould not be welfare-maximizing in the long run and that even greater\nwelfare can be achieved by re-educating the majority so that racist\npreferences weaken or disappear over time, leading to a more\nharmonious and happier world. In reply, it is pointed out that the\nutilitarian must supply an account of why racist or sexist preferences\nshould be discouraged if the same level of total long term utility\ncould be achieved by encouraging the less powerful to be content with\na lower position. \n\nCritics of utilitarianism have responded that this reliance on the\nempirical conditions turning out a particular way undermines the\nplausibility of utilitarianism as a moral theory. They argue that we\ndo not have to wait until we find out how strong the racist feelings\nare, how many are in the adversely affected racial minority, how many\nracists there are, etc. to know that racist policies are wrong. It is\nargued that given utilitarianism says that we do need to know these\nnumbers in order to know when, if ever, racist policies are wrong,\nutilitarianism fails to adequately capture our moral judgments.\nUtilitarians respond that if their theory on rare occasions does\nrequire people to sacrifice or suffer in these or other ways, the\nunintuitiveness of this consequence is a result of our contrary moral\njudgments about right and wrong, which are fallible. For many\nutilitarians, commonsense moral judgments are best understood as\nproviding us with \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 which are useful at the\nlevel of commonsense morality but can ultimately be mistaken at the\nlevel of \u2018critical theory\u2019.\n\nMost recently, some utilitarians have drawn on institutional theory or\ngame theory in defence, or in modification, of utilitarianism (see\nHardin 1988, Goodin 1995, Bailey 1997). Noting that the consequences\nof individual actions are rarely determined in isolation, but rather\nin conjunction with the actions of many others, these\n\u2018institutional\u2019 or \u2018indirect\u2019 utilitarians\nargue that morally intuitive institutions such as constitutional\nrights, human rights and various property rights would be endorsed by\nthis modified utilitarianism, and would forbid the morally horrible\noutcomes critics have feared utilitarianism could sanction.\n\nUtilitarian distribution principles, like the other principles\ndescribed here, have problems with specification and implementation.\nMost formulations of utilitarianism require interpersonal comparisons\nof utility. This means, for instance, that we must be able to compare\nthe utility one person gains from eating an apple with that another\ngains from eating an apple. Furthermore, utilitarianism requires that\ndifferences in utility be measured and summed for widely disparate\ngoods (so, for instance, the amount of utility a particular person\ngains from playing football is measured and compared with the amount\nof utility another gains from eating a gourmet meal). Some critics\nhave argued that such interpersonal utility comparisons are\nimpossible, even in theory, because even if all the diverse goods can\nbe combined into a single index of \u2018utility\u2019 for an\nindividual, there is no conceptually adequate way of calibrating such\na measure among individuals (see Elster 1991).\n\nUtilitarians face a greater problem than this theoretical one in\ndetermining what material distribution, or institutional structure, is\nprescribed by their theory. Those who share similar utilitarian\ntheoretical principles frequently recommend very different\ndistributions or structures to implement the principles. This problem\noccurs for other theories, with recommendations for distributions or\neconomic structures to implement commonly varying among advocates with\nsimilar theoretical principles. But the advocates for other\ndistributive principles tend to cluster significantly with respect to\nwhat they recommend. This is much less the case with respect to\nadvocates for utilitarian and welfare-based distribution principles\nwith advocates dispersed in their recommendations across the full\nrange of possible distributions and economic structures. For instance,\nmany preference utilitarians believe their principle prescribes\nstrongly egalitarian structures with lots of state intervention while\nother preference utilitarians believe it prescribes a laissez\nfaire style of capitalism.\n\nThere is an explanation for why utilitarianism seems so much less\ndeterminate in its policy (including structural) recommendations and\nit points to what is the greatest challenge to utilitarianism as a\nguiding distributive principle. Other distributive principles can rule\nout, relatively quickly, various policies on the grounds that they\nclearly violate the guiding principle, but utilitarians must examine,\nin great detail, all the policies on offer. For each policy, they must\ndetermine the distribution of goods and services yielded by the policy\nand at least three other factors: the identity of each person in the\ndistribution (if individuals\u2019 utility functions differ); the\nutility of each person from the goods and services distributed to\nthem; the utility of each person from the policy itself. They must\nthen aggregate these utilities across all individuals. The size of the\ninformation requirements make this task impossible. Hence, broad\nassumptions must be made and each different set of assumptions will\nyield a different answer, and so the answers range across the full set\nof policies on offer. Moreover, there is no obvious way to arbitrate\nbetween the different sets of assumptions. For instance, suppose three\nutilitarians agree on the same utilitarian distributive principle.\nUtilitarian 1, for example, may assert that the population\u2019s\nutility function conforms to function A (e.g. people\u2019s marginal\nutility is diminishing at rate R) and is maximized by Policy 1;\nUtilitarian 2, however, asserts that half the population\u2019s\nutility function conforms to function A and half to function B (e.g.\npeople\u2019s marginal utility is diminishing at rate 2R) and is\nmaximized by Policy 2; Utilitarian 3 asserts Utilitarian 2 is correct\nabout the utility functions of the population but claims that Policy 3\nis the one that will maximize utility. The challenge for contemporary\nutilitarians is to explain, given the massive informational\nrequirements of utilitarianism and our apparent human inability to\nmeet those requirements, how the population, and its experts, can\nplausibly arbitrate between conflicting policy and institutional\nrecommendations coming from utilitarian theorists who share the same\nunderlying normative principle.\n",
