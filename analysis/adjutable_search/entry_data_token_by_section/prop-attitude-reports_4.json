    "main_text": "Contextualist theories\n6. Contextualist theories\n\nMany are reluctant to accept the claim that co-referring proper names\nare intersubstitutable within the scope of attitude verbs, even when\nthey are attracted to the thesis of direct reference and the idea that\nthe contents of some of our attitudes are nothing but singular\npropositions. Thus, many neo-Russellians reject Naive Russellianism.\nThey would like to accept the intuitions that (1) is true and (4) is\nfalse while denying the Fregean claims that \u2018Superman\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 are not directly referential and that all\ncases of identity confusion are to be explained in terms of a\ndifference in thought grasped. They want it all. (5) and (6) express\nthe same singular proposition, but (1) is true and (4) is false. While\nNaive Russellians claim that the information regarding how Lois\nbelieves what she does is, at best, merely part of what utterances of\n(1) and (4) pragmatically convey, \u201csophisticated\u201d\nneo-Russellians would like that information to be part of the semantic\ncontent of the sentences in question. In this section we look at two\nbroad strategies that promise to deliver these results: The first\ndeveloped in Mark Crimmins and John Perry 1989 and Crimmins 1992a and\nthe second suggested by a view presented in Mark Richard 1990.\n\nCrimmins and Perry argue that propositional attitude reports involve\n\u201cunarticulated constituents\u201d that concern how the subject\nof the report conceives of the proposition that the report alleges\nthat she has an attitude towards. According to Crimmins and Perry, a\ntypical utterance of (1) expresses a truth while a typical utterance\nof (4) expresses a falsehood. Both attributions, they claim, say of\nLois that she believes the singular proposition about Superman to the\neffect that he is strong. But the first involves implicit reference to\nLois\u2019s \u201cSuperman-y\u201d way of thinking of Superman and\nthe second to Lois\u2019s \u201cClark Kent-y\u201d way of thinking\nof Superman. Because Lois believes that singular proposition in the\nfirst way and not the second, the two sentences will typically express\ndifferent propositions that can diverge in truth-value.\n\nCrimmins and Perry embrace a metaphysics of thoughts and thinking\nsimilar to the standard Naive Russellian\u2019s described above in\nthe previous section. The difference between the views concerns\nwhether or not the information semantically encoded by utterances of\nattitude reporting sentences is sensitive or insensitive to\ndifferences in the way a proposition is grasped.\n\nExtra-linguistic context determines what way of grasping (what\nCrimmins and Perry call an idea) an utterance of a\npropositional attitude ascribing sentence makes implicit reference to.\n(On the most plausible version of the view, a type of way of grasping,\ninstead of a token way of grasping, that is implicitly referred to.)\nThe expressions themselves (and not just their referents or semantic\ncontents) are, however, typically relevant to what way of grasping is\nimplicitly referred to. So, although substitution of co-referring\nnames does not affect the proposition the propositional attitude\nascribing sentence claims the target of the report to have an attitude\ntowards, as it does on the Fregean view, in some cases it affects what\nway of grasping is implicitly referred to and hence is capable of\naffecting truth-value of a propositional attitude ascribing sentence.\n(Some call views of this kind \u201chidden-indexical theories\u201d\nbecause the sentence does not contain a syntactic element that\nexplicitly refers to a way of thinking. See Schiffer 1992, p. 503.\nSchiffer offered a version of this view in his 1977, as did Brian Loar\n1972. Greg Fitch also presented a similar view in his 1984 and 1987.\nWe focus on Crimmins and Perry\u2019s version, which is the most\nfully developed version of the view.)\n\nCrimmins and Perry offer a way of insisting that the objects of many\nof our attitudes are singular propositions while still denying the\nsubstitution principle. They can thus accept all of the auxiliary\nprinciples and claims used to generate Frege\u2019s puzzle (i.e.,\nDisquotation, Converse Disquotation, the principle of Rationality,\netc.) and, like Frege, deny that the co-reference of\n\u2018Superman\u2019 and \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 licenses their\ninter-substitution in (1), while still claiming that\n\u2018Superman\u2019, as it occurs in (1), and \u2018Clark\nKent\u2019, as it occurs in (2), are directly referential. The view\nseems to give us all that we could want: It respects our Fregean\nintuitions about truth-values without the sins of accepting a\nsense/reference distinction for singular terms like proper names,\ndemonstratives, and indexicals. (The view is further developed and\nrefined in Crimmins 1992a,b and 1993.)\n\nCrimmins and Perry\u2019s view has been subject to criticism. We\nshall here briefly present only one line of objection. (See Bach 1993,\nClapp 1995, Reimer 1995, Richard 1993, Rieber 1995, and Saul 1992.\nCrimmins responds to some of these objections in his 1992a, 1995a.\nSchiffer objects to Crimmins and Perry\u2019s view in his 1992 and\n1994 on the basis that \u2018believes\u2019 and other propositional\nattitude verbs do not express three-place relations, as their view\nrequires. Ludlow responds to Schiffer\u2019s \u201clogical\nform\u201d objection in his 1995, 1996. Schiffer responds to Ludlow\nin his 1996.)\n\nMany are attracted to the claim that contextual supplementation of\nwhat\u2019s said is always traceable to some syntactic element; that\nis, the information semantically encoded by an utterance must have the\nsame structure as the syntactic form of the sentence uttered. Call\nthis the the principle of linguistic constraint. (See, for\nexample, Stanley 2000, 2002 for a defense of this constraint. Recanati\n2002 and Carston 1998, 2002, 2016 offer very sensitive defenses of\nunarticulated constituents.) One reason to accept this principle is\nthat it helps to demarcate information that is conveyed by an\nutterance but not part of what is said by the sentence uttered. And it\ndoes this in a way that solves an overgeneration problem that\nthreatens theories violating this constraint. Perhaps one can, given\nthe correct conversational setting, using the sentence\n\u20182+2=4\u2019 to communicate that one is going to the store.\nEven still, it seems plausible that the sentence itself does not say\nthat, as nothing in the sentence contributes the relevant components\nof that communicated piece of information. Crimmins and Perry\u2019s\nview is inconsistent with this principle, as they argue that\n\u2018believes\u2019 is syntactically two-place even though it\nexpresses a three-place relation. So, anyone convinced that our\nsemantic theories should be syntactically constrained will reject\nCrimmins and Perry\u2019s view.\n\nIs there a way to make the information encoded by utterances of belief\nsentences sensitive to how the subjects of the reports grasp the\npropositions, while insisting that the propositions grasped are\nsingular propositions, without making ways of grasping unarticulated\nconstituents? We can get an idea of how to do this by looking at a\nview developed by Mark Richard 1990, 1993, 1995. Like Crimmins and\nPerry, Richard offers a semantics of propositional attitude reporting\nsentences that treats them as context-sensitive, respects something\nlike neo-Russellianism (although we\u2019ll return to this below),\nand yet blocks intersubstitution of co-referring names within the\nscope of propositional attitude verbs. Unlike Crimmins and Perry,\nhowever, Richard does not claim that \u2018believes\u2019 (and its\nfellow propositional attitude verbs) expresses a three-place relation\nand does not appeal to unarticulated constituents. Richard\u2019s\nview is thus consistent with the principle of linguistic constraint.\nThe key to Richard\u2019s view is his claim that propositional\nattitude verbs are context-sensitive, expressing different two-place\nrelations in different contexts.\n\nAccording to Richard, sentences express what he calls Russellian\nAnnotated Matrices (RAMs). These are represented as tuples of\npairs of linguistic expressions and their \u201cRussellian\ninterpretations.\u201d (Richard notes that strictly speaking we\ndon\u2019t want a linguistic expression but rather some kind of\ninternal representation to deal with cases like Kripke\u2019s\nPaderweski case. See the discussion below in\n Section 8.)\n The pairs are called annotations. RAMs serve as both the\nsemantic contents of sentences and the contents of beliefs. According\nto Richard\u2019s account, (1), for example, is true relative to some\ncontext c and a world of evaluation w just in case\nLois has a thought in w that is properly represented\n(relative to the standards in effect in c) by the sentence\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019. The conversational setting generates\nrestrictions on what words and sentences are proper translations of\nthe representations of the alleged believer. Richard calls these\nrestrictions on correlation functions. Correlation functions\nmap annotations (used by the belief reporter) onto (sets of)\nannotations (employed in the alleged believer\u2019s beliefs). The\nsentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 properly represents\nsome thought p of Lois\u2019s (relative to the restrictions\nin force in some context c) just in case a correlation\nfunction maps the RAM expressed by \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 to\np that respects the relevant restrictions in force in\nc. Now, as there are contexts (and indeed, ordinary contexts\nwill be just like this) in which \u2018Superman is strong\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019 are associated with different\nrestrictions, we cannot substitute \u2018Clark Kent\u2019 for\n\u2018Superman\u2019 in (1) and preserve truth. Lois may well have a\nthought that can be appropriately represented, given the restrictions\nin the place in the context, by the first sentence but not the second.\nSo, there is no problem in saying that (1) is true while (4) is\nfalse. (One of the distinctive differences between Richard and\nCrimmins concerns the specifications of the internal\nrepresentations. Roughly, Richard thinks that a correct report only\ndescribes or \u201cmatches\u201d the target mental representational of the\nsubject, while Crimmins claim that a reporter refers to the mental\nrepresentation. For more, see Crimmins 1995b and Richard 1993a.)\n\nRichard\u2019s view is not a version of neo-Russellianism. This is\nbecause, on his view, the contents of propositional attitudes are not\nsingular propositions. Instead, the content of the belief that\nSuperman is strong, for example, contains the pair of Superman himself\nand something that plays the role of a mode of presentation \u2013\nthe annotation. But Richard\u2019s view can be altered in such a way\nas to still retain its core features while being neo-Russellian,\ntreating the contents of propositional attitudes and the contents of\nsentences containing proper names as singular propositions. The\nresulting view is in many ways superior to Richard\u2019s view. Begin\nby assuming the Perry-inspired metaphysics of thought sketched\nearlier, in which we distinguish thought contents from thought states.\nWe can then conceive of Richardian correlation functions as maps from\ncomplement clauses to thought states, preserving content. The content\nof both (5) and (6) is the singular proposition that Superman flies.\nLois believes that proposition in virtue of being in a belief state\nrelated to \u2018Superman flies\u2019 but not \u2018Clark Kent\nflies\u2019. So, in a belief ascribing context in which the\ncomplement clauses are intended to represent the way by which the\nagent believes what she is claimed to believe, (1) is true and (4) is\nfalse. We can then have a neo-Russellian theory of the contents of the\nattitudes and semantics of singular terms like proper names,\nindexicals, and demonstratives that respects Fregean intuitions about\nthe truth-values of (1)-(4) and is free of a commitment to\nunarticulated constituents. The view promises to offer a more\nplausible account of when two agents \u201cbelieve the same\nthing,\u201d which Richard\u2019s own fine-grained account of the\ncontents of attitudes cannot, as our intuitions about when two agents\ncount as believing the same thing are often insensitive to difference\nin how agents believe what they believe. Such an account seems to be\nthe most promising way to count (1) true and (4) false.\n\nBoth Richard\u2019s account and the modified neo-Russellian version\nof that account sketched above face a serious problem: The problem of\nconflicting restrictions. (See Sider 1995 and Soames 1995.) To build\nup to the objection, consider cases in which a speaker is ascribing\nbeliefs to different agents. It may be common ground that those agents\nconceive of matters differently. In such a case, the speaker may\nintend the same complement clause to represent different types of\nbelief states for different agents. Consider the following case as an\nexample. Suppose that Bob and Susan are looking at a picture of Bill\nClinton. Bob might then use the complement clause \u2018that he\n[pointing at the picture] was president\u2019 to represent a\nfirst-person belief state when ascribing beliefs to Bill Clinton and a\ndifferent type of belief state, certainly not a first-person belief\nstate, when ascribing beliefs to George Bush. After all, we can\nimagine Frege-style cases in which the type of belief state Bob\nintends to specify might be essential to the point of his speech.\n\nWe can now move to the problem of conflicting restrictions. Suppose\nnow that the ascriber is confused about the identities of the subject\nof the report. So, for example, suppose Lois is ascribing beliefs to\nSuperman and Clark Kent. Because she believes that Superman is not\nClark Kent, she takes herself to be ascribing beliefs to two different\npeople, depending on how she conceives of Superman. But then we can\nimagine circumstances, similar to the ones with Bob and Susan\ndescribed above, in which her intentions generate conflicting\nrestrictions on a single complement clause. So, for example, Lois\nmight intend \u2018he\u2019, pointing at a picture of Lex Luthor, in\n\u2018that he is evil\u2019 to represent a visual/perceptual\ndemonstrative when ascribing beliefs to Superman and a\nnondemonstrative, great-deeds conception of Luthor when ascribing\nbeliefs to Clark Kent. (Suppose that Lois believes that Superman knows\nof Lex Luthor personally, from his interactions with him, whereas\nClark Kent only knows about Lex Luthor through newspaper reports and\nthe testimony of others.) So, when Lois says, \u201cSuperman believes\nthat he [pointing at the picture of Luthor] is evil,\u201d she\nintends to convey that Superman has a belief to the effect that he\n[visual presentation of Luthor] is evil and when she says,\n\u201cClark Kent believes that he [pointing at the picture of Luthor]\nis evil,\u201d she intends to convey that Clark Kent has a belief to\nthe effect that such-and-so criminal mastermind is evil. This is\nproblematic for Richard because these restrictions conflict and so\nthere is no correlation function that respects all the operative\nrestrictions. As a result, any belief attribution Lois might make in\nsuch a conversational setting to Superman/Clark Kent with a complement\nclause containing \u2018he [visual presentation of Luthor]\u2019 as\nsubject is false. Even \u2018Superman believes that he [visual\npresentation of Luthor] is self-identical\u2019 is false. This is\nintuitively unacceptable. Although Lois is confused, she can\nintuitively still say a few true things about Superman\u2019s beliefs\nconcerning Lex Luthor.\n\nRichard responds to this problem in his 1995 by claiming that when\nthere are conflicting restrictions operative in a context, a relevant\nsentence is true in the context just in case it is true on every\nresolution of the conflict. Nelson 2002, 2005 criticizes\nRichard\u2019s response, arguing that it still does not accommodate\nall intuitive truth-value judgments, as it still counts false some\nutterances that are intuitively true.\n\nBoth Crimmins and Perry\u2019s account and Richard\u2019s account\nhave a similar goal: Accept the intuitive judgments of the truth-value\nof sentences like (1)-(4) without accepting the Fregean claim that the\nbelief that Superman is strong is distinct from the belief that Clark\nKent is strong. We have, however, seen reasons to doubt that either\nsucceeds in realizing this goal.\n",
