Many for example, adopt a sufficientarian position and\nhold that justice requires merely that all persons be above a certain\nspecified threshold. (For sophisticated analyses see L. Meyer &\nRoser 2009 and Page 2006: 90\u201395; 2007.)\n\nOne challenge for this view will, of course, be determining how to\nspecify this threshold. Many, however, will grant that a sufficiency\ncondition is necessary even if it is hard to specify. Some may though\nquery whether it is sufficient. For example, a sufficientarian view\nwould allow members of one generation to leave future generations\nworse off than them just so long as they are above a certain\nthreshold. This will strike many as too weak. Consider a case where\none generation could leave future people much better off than the\nsufficientarian threshold at no (or little) cost. Here it would seem\ninadequate to say that current generations need only ensure that\nfuture people do not fall beneath the sufficientarian\u2019s\ndesignated threshold.\n\nSome adopt more demanding accounts of intertemporal justice which\navoid these problems. For example, in their book Sustainability\nfor a Warming Planet (2015) Humberto Llavador, John E. Roemer,\nand Joaquim Silvestre defend what they term \u201cgrowth\nsustainability\u201d. They explain it as follows: \n\n\nGrowth sustainability (say, at 25% per generation) means to find that\npath of economic activity that maximizes the welfare of the present\ngeneration, subject to guaranteeing that welfare grows at least at 25%\nper generation, forever after. (Llavador, Roemer & Silvestre 2015:\n4) \n\n\nThe key idea is to maximise the standard of living of current\ngenerations but also commit to leaving future people better off by a\ncertain proportion. Their argument comes in two steps. First, they\nthink\u2014along luck egalitarian lines\u2014that there is a case\nfor intergenerational equality. But then they add that current\ngenerations often desire to benefit the future and so there is a case\nfor building in a commitment to bettering the condition of future\npeople (Llavador, Roemer & Silvestre 2015: 4 &\n35\u201336).\n\nOthers might query this second step, and, in particular, the claim\nthat a \u201cpreference\u201d to benefit others can ground an\n(enforceable) duty to do so. In general, whether people have a duty to\nothers cannot be vindicated on the basis of a preference that some\nhave to benefit others. This notwithstanding, some might still argue\nthat where current generations can leave future generations better off\nthan themselves at no cost, or at reasonable cost, then there is a\nduty to do so.\n\nThere is one other aspect that bears mentioning. So far the focus has\nbeen on what might term a vertical dimension (how well off the members\nof generations in the future [at, say, t10] are when\ncompared to earlier generations [at, say, t1]). This\ndoes not, however, exhaust questions of intergenerational justice for\none might think that members of one generation should also be\nconcerned about the likely distribution within any future\ngeneration (so, what we might term a horizontal dimension). Those who\nadopt an egalitarian perspective, for example, might think that\ncurrent generations have a duty to act in such a way that they do not\ncreate stark inequalities within future generations (Caney\n2018a: 161\u2013162 & 168; see also Fleurbaey et al. 2019: 93).\nThis is relevant in this context because climate change tends to\nexacerbate existing inequalities (Hoegh-Guldberg, Jacob, & Taylor\n2019: 244).\n",
