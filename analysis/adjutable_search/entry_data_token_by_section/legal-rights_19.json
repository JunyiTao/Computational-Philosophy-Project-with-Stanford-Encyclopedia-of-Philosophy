To understand how, it is\nhelpful to distinguish between \u201cinfringing\u201d on a right and\n\u201cviolating\u201d it. X\u2019s right that Y \u03c6\nis infringed on if Y fails to \u03c6; yet an\ninfringement is not necessarily also a violation. As Judith Jarvis\nThomson clarifies, X\u2019s right is violated if and only if\nit is infringed wrongfully (Gewirth 1981: 2; Thomson 1977\n[1986: 51\u201352]; 1990: 122). Accordingly, if a right is\noverridden (preempted or outweighed) by competing reasons, it\nfollows that acting against that right is permissible, or justifiable,\nor even required. That right is, therefore, infringed on, yet it is\nnot violated (Gewirth 1981: 2; Thomson 1977 [1986: 50\u201352];\nThomson 1990: 100\u2013104, 151\u2013166). \n\nViolated rights (or their underlying reasons) continue, in one way or\nanother, to project normative force, thereby still counting as legal\nreasons. This is prominently manifested in remedial rights and\ncorrelative remedial duties justified by the violation of other rights\n(see\n Section 10.4;\n Weinrib 1995: 133\u2013144; Raz 2004: 189\u2013193; Gardner 2011:\n28\u201337, 45\u201346; Ripstein 2016: 233\u2013262; Steel 2020).\nIt is, however, worth noting that violated rights do not always\nsucceed in grounding a remedy and can be overridden by other\nconsiderations in this regard. For example, in Newfoundland\nTreasury Board v. N.A.P.E. (2004) the Supreme Court of Canada\nfound that the defendant had violated the plaintiffs\u2019 Equality\nRights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by\npaying them less than their male colleagues. Yet, the Court affirmed\ngranting the plaintiffs only a partial and belated remedy due to the\ndire fiscal circumstances of the government employer. \n\nInterestingly, when overridden, infringed rights arguably also\ncontinue to project normative force, as a kind of residual legal\nreason. When a right is overridden, infringing on it is not wrongful,\nbut it is still in a sense a wrong to the right-holder. Infringed\noverridden rights are neither expunged nor normatively inert (for a\ndiscussion in the context of moral rights, see Jones 1994:\n195\u2013198); in fact, they can even justify legal outcomes, even if\nnot the outcome that they are a right for. A legal example is the\nclassic case of Vincent v. Lake Erie Transp.Co. (1910). One\nreading of the case is that although the defendant had a\n\u201cnecessity\u201d defense and, therefore, was justified in\ntrespassing on the plaintiff\u2019s land (thereby infringing\non his property rights), the defendant was still legally\nrequired\u2014on the grounds of the infringement\u2014to compensate\nthe plaintiff not for the trespass itself (i.e., the infringement) but\nfor the damages caused by the (legally justified) infringement\n(Thomson 1990: 103\u2013104).\n",
