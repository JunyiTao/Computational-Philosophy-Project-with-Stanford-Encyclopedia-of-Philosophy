    "main_text": "\n\nPaul of Venice was the most important Italian thinker of his times,\nand one of the most prominent and interesting logicians of the Middle\nAges. His philosophical theories (culminating in a metaphysics of\nessences which states the ontological and epistemological primacy of\nuniversals over any other kind of beings) are the final and highest\nresult of the preceding realistic tradition of thought. He fully\ndeveloped the new form of realism started up by Wyclif and his Oxonian\nfollowers in the last decades of the 14th century, and\nrenewed Burley\u2019s attacks against nominalistic views. The\nmetaphysical convictions at the basis of his philosophy are an\noriginal version of the most fundamental theses of Duns Scotus (viz.\nunivocity of being; existence of universal forms outside the mind,\nwhich are at the same time identical with and different from their own\nindividuals; real identity and formal distinction between essence and\nbeing; thisness as the principle of individuation; real distinction\namong the ten categories). But Paul puts much more stress on the\nontological presuppositions and entailments of the doctrine.\nSimultaneously, he was open to influences from many other directions,\nas he held in due consideration also the positions of authors such as\nAlbert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, and critically\ndiscussed the doctrines of the main Nominalists of the 14th\ncentury, namely William Ockham, John Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen,\nsometimes playing mutually incompatible theses against each other.\nThis contributes to making his works stimulating and enriching from an\nhistorical point of view, but also makes it difficult to grasp his own\nideas in their relationships and unity. These reflections help us to\nexplain why for about one hundred and fifty years Paul was\nerroneously, but unanimously, believed to be an Ockhamist in\nlogic and metaphysics and an Averroist in psychology and\nepistemology.\n",
