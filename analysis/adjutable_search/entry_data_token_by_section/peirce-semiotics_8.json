    "main_text": "The Interim Account: 1903 || Sign-Vehicles\n3.1 Sign-Vehicles\n\nRecall that Peirce thought signs signify their objects not through all\ntheir features, but in virtue of some particular feature. By 1903, for\nreasons related to his work on phenomenology, Peirce thought the\ncentral features of sign-vehicles could be divided into three broad\nareas, and consequently, that signs could be classified accordingly.\nThis division depends upon whether sign-vehicles signify in virtue of\nqualities, existential facts, or conventions and laws. Further, signs\nwith these sign-vehicles are classified as qualisigns,\nsinsigns, and legisigns respectively.\n\nExamples of signs whose sign-vehicle relies upon a quality are\ndifficult to imagine, but a particularly clear example, used by David\nSavan, is this:\n\n[\u2026] I use a color chip to identify the color of some paint I\nwant to buy. The color chip is perhaps made of cardboard, rectangular,\nresting on a wooden table etc., etc. But it is only the color of the\nchip that is essential to it as a sign of the color of the paint.\n(Savan 1988, 20)\n\n\nThere are many elements to the colored chip as a sign, but it is only\nits color that matters to its ability to signify. Any sign whose\nsign-vehicle relies, as with this example, on simple abstracted\nqualities is called a qualisign.\n\nAn example of a sign whose sign-vehicle uses existential facts is\nsmoke as a sign for fire; the causal relation between the fire and\nsmoke allows the smoke to act as a signifier. Other cases are the\nmolehill example used earlier, and temperature as a sign for a fever.\nAny sign whose sign-vehicle relies upon existential connections with\nits object is named, by Peirce, a sinsign.\n\nAnd finally, the third kind of sign is one whose crucial signifying\nelement is primarily due to convention, habit or law. Typical examples\nwould be traffic lights as sign of priority, and the signifying\ncapability of words; these sign-vehicles signify in virtue of the\nconventions surrounding their use. Peirce calls signs whose\nsign-vehicles function in this way legisigns.\n",
