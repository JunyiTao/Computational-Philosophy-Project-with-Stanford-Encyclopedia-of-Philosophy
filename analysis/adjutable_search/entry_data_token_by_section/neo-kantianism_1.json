    "main_text": "The Marburg School\n2. The Marburg School\n\nThe intellectual beginnings of the Marburg School can be traced to\n1871, when Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) published the first edition\nof his Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (Kant\u2019s Theory\nof Experience), which interpreted Kant in an anti-psychologistic\nway and found in Kant\u2019s first Critique the expression\nof a novel way of doing philosophy: the transcendental method. In 1873\nCohen did his Habilitation in Marburg under Friedrich Lange, who had\nmoved there in 1872. He was promoted as Professor Extraordinarius in\n1875, and then took over Lange\u2019s chair in 1876 after his death.\nWhen Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) moved to Marburg in 1880 (writing\nhis Habilitation\u2014Natorp 1881\u2014under Cohen and being\npromoted to Professor in 1893), the \u201cMarburg\u201d school as an\ninstitutional force was born.\n\nCohen\u2019s work culminated in a three part system of philosophy,\nmodeled after Kant\u2019s own tripartite division of critical\nphilosophy: The Logic of Pure Knowledge (Cohen 1902), The\nEthics of Pure Will (Cohen 1904), and the Aesthetics of Pure\nFeeling (Cohen 1912). His most influential works, though, were\nhis interpretation of Kant, principally in Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience, which was significantly revised and expanded in a\nsecond edition (Cohen 1885), and his works in the philosophy of\nscience and mathematics: The Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod (Cohen 1883), and his introduction to the sixth edition of\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism (Cohen\n 1898).[9]\n\nNatorp\u2019s most influential writings are in the interpretation of\nPlato, the philosophy of science, and in the philosophy of psychology.\nStarting with his habilitation (\u201cDescartes\u2019s Theory of\nKnowledge: A Study in the Pre-history of Criticism\u201d) in 1881,\nNatorp extended the reach of the Marburg school as historians of\nphilosophy beyond Kant to other philosophers who in various ways\nanticipated the Kantian themes important to the Marburgers.\nNatorp\u2019s most significant work in this vein was his book\nPlato\u2019s Theory of Ideas (1903), which gave a serious\nscholarly argument for the dating of Plato\u2019s dialogues, in\naddition to a novel \u201ccritical\u201d reading of Platonic ideas.\nIn the philosophy of science, his systematic work The Logical\nFoundations of the Exact Sciences (1910) gives a systematic\nphilosophy of logic, arithmetic, geometry, and physics that engages\nwith contemporary science and mathematics in a more comprehensive and\ndetailed way than any of Cohen\u2019s works. Last, in a series of\nworks in the philosophy of psychology (culminating in General\nPsychology According to the Critical Method (1912b)), Natorp\ndefended a novel conception of psychology as the science of the\nsubjective.\n\nAmong the many students of Cohen and Natorp\u2019s who identified\nthemselves with the Marburg school, the most accomplished and\ninfluential was undoubtedly Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). After\nwriting his dissertation under Cohen in 1899 on Descartes\u2019s\nphilosophy of mathematics and science, Cassirer moved to Berlin, where\nhe worked as a Privatdozent (though not a Professor, which was ruled\nout by institutional\n anti-Semitism[10]).\n His most important works before 1914 are in the history of philosophy\n(especially the massive, two volume Problem of Knowledge\n(Cassirer 1906, 1907a), which follows the development of the\nphilosophy of science from the late Renaissance to Kant), and the\nphilosophy of the exact sciences (Substance and Function,\n1910; Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, 1921). Starting\nin 1921, Cassirer\u2019s philosophy broadened into a\n\u201cphilosophy of symbolic forms\u201d, which differs in some\nfundamental ways from the classic works of his teachers.\n",
