    "main_text": "Constructivism || Criticism of Hard Constructivism\n7.4 Criticism of Hard Constructivism\n\nSome objections to hard constructivism are not objections to soft\nconstructivism:\n\n\n\nIt seems quite possible for subjects in the first instance to apply\n\u201cthin\u201d descriptions to experiences, involving only a small\npart of their conceptual schemes. Perhaps only on second thought will\nthey elaborate on their experience in terms of the richness of their\nhome culture. This would be like a physician with a headache, who\nexperiences pain in the first instance just like ordinary folk and\nonly subsequently applies medical terminology to the headache (compare\nKing 1988). If so, there is a possibility of common\nfirst-instance mystical experiences across cultures, contrary to\nPremise A. \n\n\nPremise A is thrown into further doubt by expressions of surprise by\nmystics-in-training about what they experience (Gellman\n1997, 145\u2013146 and Barnard 1997, 127\u2013130).\nSo too, constructivists have trouble accounting for why some mystics\nbecome heretics (Stoeber 1992, 112\u2013113) \u2014 under\nconstructivism, their mystical experiences should reinforce\ntheir orthodoxy. These illustrate the possibility of getting out from\nunder one\u2019s cultural background to have new experiences.\nLikewise, hard constructivism\u2019s inherently conservative take on\nmysticism will struggle to explain transformations within mystical\ntraditions, and cannot easily account for innovative geniuses within\nmystical traditions.  \n\n\nTwo people walk together down the street and see an approaching dog.\nOne experiences the dog as \u201cJones\u2019s pet black\nterrier\u201d while the other experiences it as \u201ca stray mutt that the\ndog-catchers should take away.\u201d Because of the excessive\nconceptual differences in their experiencing, constructivist must\ninsist that there was no worthwhile sense in which both observers had\nthe same experience. However, there is a valuable sense in which\nthey are having the same experience: seeing that black dog at that\nplace and time. Similarly, there might exist a\nvaluable commonality of experiences across mystical traditions\ndespite conceptual disparity. The conceptual differences might not be\nsufficient to deny this important commonality (Wainwright 1981,\n25). \n\n\nCultural conditioning does not influence everyone to the same degree\nand in the same way. Individuals have rich and varied personal\nhistories that influence their experiences in their lives in\nwidely differing ways. Some accept cultural restraints\ngladly, others rebel against them, others are blessed with a\ncreative spirit, and so on. \n\n\nMystical traditions characteristically involve disciplines aimed at\nloosening the hold of one\u2019s conceptual scheme on subsequent\nexperience. Meditative techniques promote a pronounced inhibition\nof ordinary cognitive processes \u2014 what Arthur Deikman (1980)\nlabelled \u201cdeautomization.\u201d This plausibly restricts the influence\nof one\u2019s cultural background on one\u2019s mystical\nexperiences, in turn making possible identical experiences across\nmystical traditions to the extent that our neurology is the same in\nrelevant respects. \n\n\nHard constructivists also fail to account well for widely\ndiffering mystical understandings of the same religious text. For\nexample, the metaphysics of the Upanishads and Brahma\nSutra is an absolute nondualism for Shankara (c.\neighth century CE), a \u201cqualified dualism\u201d for Ramanuja (c.\n1055\u20131137), and a strict dualism for Madhva\n(1199\u20131278). (See Radhakrishnan 1968,\nintroduction.) Likewise, the teaching of emptiness in the\nBuddhist Heart Sutra receives disparate unpacking in\ndifferent streams of Buddhism. It is plausible to conclude that\ndistinct mystical experiences were responsible, at least in part, for\nthese differences. If so, the experience control the mystics\u2019\nunderstanding of their basic scriptures rather than vice\nversa. \n\n\nMore generally, hard constructivists overemphasize the influence\nof pre-mystical religious teaching on the mystic\u2019s experience.\nMystical experiences can cause a mystic to reinvent the meaning of\ndoctrines. An example is the Jewish Kabbalistic transformation of the\nnotion of mitzvah (\u201ccommandment\u201d) to that of\n\u201cjoining\u201d or \u201cconnection\u201d with God. Starting\nwith \u201ccommandment,\u201d the mystic ends up with\n\u201cclinging\u201d (devekut) to God. \n\n",
