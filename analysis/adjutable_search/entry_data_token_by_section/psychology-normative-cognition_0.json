    "main_text": "A Psychological Capacity Dedicated to Norms\n1. A Psychological Capacity Dedicated to Norms\n\nNorms are the rules of a group of people that mark out what is\nappropriate, allowed, required, or forbidden for various members in\ndifferent situations. They are typically manifest in common behavioral\nregularities that are kept in place by social sanctions. From an early\nage, humans see certain behaviors, contexts, and roles as governed by\nnorms. Once a person adopts a norm, it functions both as a rule that\nguides behavior and as a standard against which behavior is evaluated.\nMoreover, individuals typically become motivated to enforce the norms\nthey adopt, and so to participate in regulative practices such as\npunishment and the ascription of blame. Such practices in turn help\nstabilize the community\u2019s social arrangements and the norms that\nstructure them. Norms are often classified into kinds or\nsubcategories, with common examples including moral, social,\nconventional, epistemic, aesthetic, and organizational norms. The\ncorrect or theoretically most useful way to distinguish and taxonomize\nkinds of norm is the subject of much debate, but one that will be set\naside here (see O\u2019Neill 2017 for a review, Kelly forthcoming\nfor discussion). Rather, this section will sketch a general overview\nof the conceptual space common to cognitive-evolutionary work on the\npsychology of norms, and later sections will elaborate on its\ncontents, locating different claims and specific theories within\nit.\n\nAn idea central to work on the psychology of norms is that human minds\ncontain a norm system of some kind, a set of psychological\nmechanisms dedicated to handling information and producing behaviors\nrelevant to norms. Such mechanisms feature in an explanatory strategy\ncommon throughout psychology (R. Cummins 2000). In this case,\ntheorists appeal to different properties of the norm system to help\naccount for different aspects of a complex capacity for norm-guided\nbehavior\u2014a capacity to \u201cdo\u201d norms. This capacity is\ncharacterized by a broad but distinctive pattern of behavior: when\nfaced with norm relevant stimuli, typically centered on other\npeoples\u2019 actions or their own, along with other cues concerning\nthe context of those actions and the roles of the actors, individuals\nexhibit a robust and multifaceted type of response that is centered on\nconformity and punishment. Taken together, the responses of\nindividuals aggregate up to produce stabilizing group-level effects on\npatterns of collective social organization. The complexity and\nrobustness of the individual capacity suggests the operation of\ndedicated psychological machinery\u2014a norm system\u2014which\nsensitizes humans to certain social stimuli (behavior, contexts,\nroles) and reliably produces the coordinated facets (physiologically,\ninferentially, behaviorally) of the characteristic response.\n\nThis picture raises the question of how it is that humans are\nable to spontaneously and reliably track norm-relevant features of\ntheir world, infer the rules which govern it, and bring those rules to\nbear on their own and others\u2019 behavior. It also calls for a\npsychological answer, one that sheds light on what mediates the\nstimuli and the response. By analogy, an automobile is capable of\nacceleration\u2014it reliably speeds up in response to the depression\nof the gas pedal\u2014but one needs to \u201clook under the\nhood\u201d to see what sort of mechanisms are reliably translating\nthat kind of input into that kind of output. Moving from the\nacceleration of a car to the norm-guided activity of a person,\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches posit and investigate the\npsychological machinery that is responsible for translating certain\nkinds of social inputs into the kind of behavioral outputs associated\nwith norms. This strategy\u2014of positing psychological mechanisms\nthat mediate stimulus and response\u2014is supported by a now\nfamiliar way of understanding the mind as an information processing\nsystem. The inputs under consideration are treated as information,\nwhich is routed and processed by a suite of psychological mechanisms\nand finally translated into behavioral outputs. Those focused on the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition have posited the\nexistence of this kind of dedicated package of mechanisms, and have\ninvestigated different possibilities about its nature.\n\nTo introduce a couple terms of art, accounts of psychological\ncapacities often aspire to provide both a proximate\nexplanation and an ultimate explanation. Where proximate\nexplanations try to answer, \u201cHow does it work?\u201d, ultimate\nexplanations try to answer, \u201cHow did we come to be like\nthis?\u201d This distinction originates in biology (Mayr 1961; Ariew 2003), but is\napplicable to behavioral and psychological traits as well (Griffiths\n2007). Central to proximate explanations in these latter contexts are\nthe models of the psychological processes that underlie specific\ncapacities. After identifying a relatively complex ability, that\nability is explained in terms of the operation and interaction of a\nset of relatively simpler underlying component mechanisms. Thus,\nproximate explanations of norms aim to show how human individuals are\npsychologically capable of the rich array of activity associated with\nnorm-guided behavior by identifying the component parts of the norm\nsystem and describing how they operate.\n\nUltimate explanations, on the other hand, aim to explain the\nlikely origins of different traits. It is now common for the cognitive\nsciences to make extensive use of evolutionary theory, taking what is\nknown about the environments and selective pressures faced by\nancestral populations and using it to help inform hypotheses about\nminds (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992). Central to many of the\nultimate explanations proposed by researchers interested in the\npsychology of norms are the adaptive challenges raised by collective\naction and large-scale cooperation (Gintis, Bowles, et al. 2005; Boyd\n& Richerson 2005b; N. Henrich & J. Henrich 2007; Tomasello\n2009). For the sake of clarity, it is helpful to remember that these\ntwo styles of explanation are analytically distinct, but that\nproximate and ultimate explanations for a given trait will ideally be\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. Thus, evolutionary accounts of\nnorm cognition can inform and constrain proximate models, and vice\nversa.\n\nThe psychological focus of cognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms\ngives them a fairly clear research agenda. It is worth noting,\nhowever, that while questions about the nature of norms are relevant\nto a range of debates in philosophy (and beyond), work on the\npsychology of norms is not primarily driven by one particular\nphilosophical tradition or debate. Rather, those focused on\nnormative psychology are typically guided by a set of general\nissues concerning human nature: the structure and distinctive features\nof human minds, the pathways of human evolution that produced them,\nand the commonalities and differences between human minds and\nbehaviors, on one hand, and those found in non-human species, on the\nother (Tomasello 1999; Richerson & Boyd 2005; Tooby & Cosmides\n2005; J. Henrich 2015; Vincent Ring, & Andrews 2018). One upshot\nof this is that theorists draw on the full range of explanatory\nresources made available by contemporary cognitive science. Thus,\nthese accounts of normative cognition are not constrained by\nfolk-psychological explanations of behavior, and so are free to posit\nand appeal to psychological mechanisms, states, and processes that\nneed not bear much resemblance to beliefs and desires, credences and\npreferences, conscious deliberation and explicit inference.\n\nThis entry is organized around research whose focal point is the\npsychology distinctive of normative cognition. However, any\ndiscussion of norms and norm-guided behavior will involve, tacitly or\notherwise, some picture or other of agents and the\ncharacteristics that make them responsive to normative influence. Some\nbegin with analytic formalizations of the kinds of agents and mental\nstates assumed by common sense folk psychology, and use these\nformalizations, along with various refinements, to account for\ndifferent norm related phenomena. These fall beyond the scope of this\nentry, but see especially Bicchieri, Muldoon, and Sontuoso (2018) for\nan overview of such approaches (also see Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan\net al. 2013; Conte, Andrighetto, & Campenn\u00ec 2013; Hawkins,\nGoodman, & Goldstone 2019; cf. Morris et al. 2015). It is also\nworth noting that cognitive-evolutionary approaches are sometimes\npresented as importantly different from classic rational choice\napproaches to human decision and social behavior (Boyd & Richerson\n2001; Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Whether these are\ngenuinely distinct alternatives remains unclear (Elster 1991, cf.\nWendel 2001), but those who make the case typically point to a growing\nbody of evidence that suggests humans rarely approximate the\nunboundedly rational, purely self-interested agents of classical\neconomics (Gigerenzer & Selten 2001; Kahneman 2011, cf. Millgram\n2019, Other Internet Resources).  To illustrate, participants in\none-time, anonymous cooperation games have been observed to routinely\ncooperate, even when they are made explicitly aware of their anonymity\nand the fact that they will play the game just once (Marwell &\nAmes 1981; see Thaler 1992 for a review). Those sympathetic to\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms have an explanatory\ntemplate for this kind of finding ready at hand, and will construe\nparticipants\u2019 behavior as motivated by their norm systems and\nthe pro-social norms that they have internalized.\n\nWith the expanded repertoire of psychological entities at their\ndisposal, explanations that appeal to a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms also appear well suited to capture the kinds of\ndissonance and dissociation that can occur between individuals\u2019\nattention, implicit categorization, and normative motivation, on the\none hand, and their explicit beliefs and avowed principles, on the\nother. A person may, for example, explicitly endorse feminism and\nsincerely wish to extinguish the sexist norms and expectations he has\nabout women, but nevertheless find himself monitoring the social world\nthrough the lens of those sexist norms, and experiencing recalcitrant\nmotivation to enforce and comply with them (cf. work on implicit\nbiases Brownstein & Saul 2016). In short, on this kind of picture\ndifferent psychological systems that comprise an individual\u2019s\nmind (perhaps the norm system and the practical reasoning system) can\nwork independently from, and be at slight odds with, each other.\n\nSeveral more specific features that appear distinctive of normative\ncognition have drawn considerable attention from psychological\nresearchers. These include the propensities to acquire norms,\nto comply with norms, and to enforce norms. When a\nperson is born into or otherwise enters a community, she needs to be\nable to identify and extract information about the broad assortment of\nnorms that shape it, who different norms apply to and when, and what\nthe consequences of breaking them are. She must be able to see some\nbehaviors as normatively regulated, and then to infer what\nthe governing rule is. Learning how to do this is sometimes supported\nby intentional pedagogical behavior by her mentors (Sterelny 2012),\nbut need not be (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011). Gaining\nknowledge of the rules is not where it ends. Individuals rarely just\nobserve such social activities, but rather come to competently\nparticipate in them. To do this, a person typically learns to behave\nin compliance with the norms she identifies as applying to herself;\nacquiring those norms results in their coming to guide her own\nconduct. Finally, prevalent norms and standards of conduct are\ncollectively maintained by a community when its members enforce them,\npunishing those who fail to follow the rules. Enforcement and\npunishment are broad categories, and can include correcting, withholding cooperation,\ncommunicating disapproval through body language or explicit criticism,\nostracizing or gossiping about norm violators, or even physical\nviolence. Thus, individuals become responsive to norms and the social\npressure by which they are enforced, and motivated to apply social\npressure to others who transgress.\n\nFurther questions arise about each of these propensities. One cluster\nof questions concerns the details of acquisition: what sort of\nperceivable cues are salient to the norm system, prompting a person to\nperceive a behavior, context, or role as normatively\ngoverned? And once a norm is identified, what causes a person to\ninternalize it? Perhaps the merely statistical fact that most people\nbehave the same way suffices in some cases, while in others a\nsanctioning response may be required to activate the acquisition\nprocess. A second family of issues concerns motivation: is norm-guided\nbehavior typically driven by intrinsic or instrumental motivation?\nPeople may comply with a norm for its own sake, simply because it is\nfelt to be the right thing to do. They may also, however, obey a norm\nmerely in order to avoid punishment and blame. Some behaviors may be\ndriven by both kinds of motivation. Similar and perhaps more puzzling\nquestions arise about the psychological roots of people\u2019s\nmotivation to punish others who violate norms. A third family of\nquestions can be framed in terms of innateness: to what degree are the\nmechanisms responsible for norm cognition innately specified or\nculturally acquired? Aside from the mechanisms, is any of the\ncontent\u2014any of the norms themselves\u2014innately\nspecified?\n\nCognitive-evolutionary approaches to norms treat these as empirical\nquestions, and thus see value in, and aspire to be sensitive to, a\nwide range of evidence. Before looking more closely at some of that\nevidence however, it will be useful to be familiar with the types of\ntheoretical tools researchers typically use to generate and interpret\nit.\n",
