    "main_text": "Other elements of natural law theory || Responsibility and punishment\n6.2  Responsibility and punishment\n\n\nCriminal responsibility (guilt) is primarily for acts and consequences\nintended by the offender. Liability for negligence is relatively\nexceptional in modern criminal law, though the predominant form of\nliability in modern law of compensation (\u201ccivil\nlaw\u201d). (The duties and standards of care used to attribute\ntortious/delictual/civil liability are in part straightforwardly moral\nand in part conventional\u2014in neither part are they securely\nsource-based in the sense of sources given unconditional primacy in\nlegal positivism.)\n\n\nThe legal enunciation of rules of criminal law (mostly\n\u201cprohibitions\u201d) has as its primary goal the elimination or\nat least discouraging of the specified kinds of action (or\nomission). In this phase of the legal institution of criminal law and\npunishment, the goal can be called deterrence. The fact that this goal\nworks partly by enforcement and application of the threatened sanction\nin the event of violation and conviction does not, however, entail\nthat deterrence is the formative or even the primary end of\npunishment. Indeed, the institution of punishment has its primary\nsense and justification, not in deterrence, but in the restoration of\nthat presumptively fair balance of burdens and advantages which\noffenders upset, precisely in choosing to prefer their own purposes\nand advantage to restraining their action so as to avoid violating the\nlaw. In preferring that self-preferential option, offenders help\nthemselves to an advantage over all who do restrain themselves so as\nto respect the law. The offenders thereby upset the presumptively fair\nbalance of advantages and burdens between themselves and the\nlaw-abiding. The primary purpose of punishment thus can reasonably be\nto restore that disturbed balance by depriving convicted offenders of\ntheir unfairly gained advantage\u2014excess freedom of \naction\u2014by imposing upon them measures, punishments, whose precise\npurpose is to restrict their freedom of action, whether by fines or\nimprisonment, proportionately to the degree to which they indulged\ntheir self-preference. Punishment in that way seeks to ensure that,\nover the span of time running from before the offence to the\nundergoing of the penalty, no one gains an advantage over fellow\ncitizens by offending.\n\n\nThus, while compensation in civil law (tort, delict, etc.) rectifies\nthe disturbed balance of advantages and burdens as between tortfeasors\nand their victims, punishment in criminal (penal) law\nrectifies the relationship between offenders and all the\nlaw-abiding members of the community. This retributive\njustification (general justifying aim) of punishment explains why\nmental competence and mens rea are standard legal\npre-conditions of criminal guilt and liability to punishment. It is\ncompatible with concurrent goals of deterrence, protection and reform,\nas bonus side-effects of the retributive sentence, and as organizing\naims of specific measures and features e.g., of a prison regimen. It\nboth presupposes and reinforces the reality that the political\ncommunity in question stands to offenders and law-abiding alike as\nour community.\n",
