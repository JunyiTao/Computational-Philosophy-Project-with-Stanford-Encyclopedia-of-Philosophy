To reconcile theories with one\nanother is to render them mutually consistent. To reconcile yourself\nto the fact that you have cancer is to live better with the belief\nthat you do. Reconciliation of the divine-human relationship is linked\nin the Christian tradition to the notion of salvation. This essay\nconcentrates on the uses to which the concept of reconciliation has\nbeen put in the treatment of moral and political issues that arise in\nthe aftermath of wrongdoing and conflict between persons and\ngroups.\n\nThe term \u2018reconciliation\u2019 is used to refer either to a\nprocess or to an outcome or goal. Reconciliation, as an outcome, is an\nimprovement in the relations among parties formerly at odds with one\nanother. The nature and degree of improvement required to qualify as\nreconciliation for any particular context is a matter of disagreement\namong theorists. So too, the reasons why relations have improved may\nplay a role in determining whether reconciliation has genuinely taken\nplace. That is, on some accounts, two parties will count as reconciled\nonly if their better future relations result from their having\nsatisfactorily dealt with the emotional, epistemic, and/or material\nlegacy of the past. While the outcome of reconciliation is oriented\ntoward a future marked by peaceful and just relations, the processes\nof reconciliation are typically oriented towards the continuing bad\nfeelings, suspicions, or harms that were created by the conflicts and\ninjustices of the past.\n\nPhilosophical interest in reconciliation as a moral and political\nvalue grew in the 1990s in response to its invocation during South\nAfrica\u2019s dramatic transition from apartheid to democracy\n(National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No. 34 of 1995; South\nAfrican Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report 1998).\nThe South African case, as well as the difficult issues left in the\nwake of other civil conflicts and periods of repression of the era,\nincluding the transitions from military juntas in South America and\nthe wars in the former Yugoslavia, led political and legal thinkers to\ndefine the topic of transitional justice (see the entry on\n transitional justice).\n The question of transitional justice is: how can post-conflict and/or\npost-repression societies justly make the transition to stable and (it\nis usually stipulated) democratic government given the reality of past\nwrongs and harms (Minow 1998, Teitel 2002, C. Murphy 2017)? Of\noverriding importance is establishing the conditions that will ensure\nthat such abuses happen \u201cNever Again.\u201d In South Africa in\nthe 1990s, \u2018reconciliation\u2019 seemed to be of crucial\nimportance to a just transition. It was in the name of this value that\nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) offered amnesty from\nprosecution to those guilty of politically motivated human rights\nabuses in return for their full and truthful testimony. Theorists and\npolitical analysts debate the extent to which the TRC contributed to\nreconciliation in South Africa, as well as whether its Commissioners\nproperly conceived of reconciliation (Tutu 1999, Rotberg and Thompson\n2000, Gibson 2004, Hamber 2009, Allais 2012, Bates et al. 2020).\n\nIncreasingly, theorists and philosophers apply the language and\ntheories of reconciliation, which were originally developed to deal\nwith transitional contexts, to stable, non-transitional democracies.\nDiscussions of how white settler states such as the United States,\nCanada, and Australia deal with their own historical legacies of\ninjustice are now often posed as debates about reconciliation\n(Thompson 2002, Brooks 2004, Barkan and Karn 2006, Kymlicka and Bashir\n2010, Coulthard 2014, Jung 2018). The value of reconciliation is also\nsometimes appealed to within discussions of criminal law, especially\namong those who are interested in investigating alternative sentencing\nprocedures and sanctions. \u201cRestorative justice\u201d advocates\nconceptualize crime as a problem in the relationship among the\noffender, the victim, and the local community, and look to measures\nsuch as restitution payments and face-to-face dialogue in order to\nrestore that relationship (Braithwaite 2000, van Ness and Strong\n2002). Whether civil law, too, is amenable to interpretations that\nemphasize broken and repaired relationships is an open question\n(Radzik 2014). Meierhenrich (2008) notes connections between the value\nof reconciliation and practices in civil law traditions of\n\u201cconciliation,\u201d where the emphasis is on the accommodation\nof competing claims\n\nFinally, reconciliation has emerged as a topic among moral theorists\nwho discuss the ethical issues that arise in the aftermath of everyday\nforms of wrongdoing, such as transgressions within friendships or\nfamily relationships (Walker 2006, Griswold 2007, Radzik 2009). Much\nof this discussion takes place in the literature on forgiveness (see\nthe entry on\n forgiveness).\n Here, theorists ask whether one may reconcile with a wrongdoer\nwithout also forgiving him, or forgive a person without reconciling.\nSuch questions arise as well in the literature on reconciliation in\npolitical and legal contexts, where there are often strong objections\nto forgiving the wrongdoers (who may, after all, remain unrepentant\nfor committing atrocities) or to placing other people under pressure\nto forgive them. For some, a conception of reconciliation that does\nnot require forgiveness offers a positive way forward in these\ndifficult cases (e.g., Eisikovits 2009, Verdeja 2009, C. Murphy\n2010).\n\nDiscussion of the value of reconciliation, especially in political\ncontexts, often has a skeptical orientation. Dictators and war-makers\npay lip-service to the value of reconciliation while aggression\ncontinues. Such appeals reinforce skepticism about the value of\nreconciliation. In transitional contexts, reconciliation is claimed to\nput unjustifiable demands on victims of wrongdoing and to sacrifice\njustice for peace (Rotberg and Thompson 2000). In non-transitional\ncontexts, fundamental political change is rarely on the table. So, for\nexample, when the governments of white settler states call on\nindigenous peoples to reconcile, the politics of reconciliation may\nsimply look like a demand that indigenous peoples \u2018reconcile\nthemselves to\u2019 the status quo (Coulthard 2014).\n\nOther critics charge that the language of reconciliation lends itself\nto misuse because it is essentially empty. Given that the concept has\nno widely recognized, determinate content or clear normative\nstandards, almost anyone can claim to be pursuing reconciliation\n(Schaap 2008). As this essay will indicate, defenders of the concept\nof reconciliation do believe that it is amenable to further\narticulation. However, while the concept of reconciliation is not\nempty, it defies easy or definitive analysis.\n\nThis entry treats the topic of reconciliation in a manner that\nrespects its significance across moral (viz. interpersonal and\nprivate), legal and political contexts. Many of the issues and debates\nthat arise in the literature on reconciliation are relevant to each of\nthese contexts. However, issues that are specific to political\ncontexts, where the philosophical literature on reconciliation is most\nextensive, will receive special attention.\n\nParticular conceptions of reconciliation vary across a number of\ndimensions. As section 1 explains, the kind of relationship at issue\nin a specific context affects the type of improvement in relations\nthat might be necessary in order to qualify as reconciliation.\nReconciliation is widely taken to be a scalar concept. Section 2\ndiscusses the spectrum of intensity along which kinds of improvement\nin relationships fall, and indicates why, in particular contexts,\ntheorists often disagree about the point along this spectrum that is\nmorally or politically most significant. Section 3 provides an\noverview of the processes commonly cited as contributing to\nreconciliation. These processes are often controversial; those praised\nby some commentators as appropriate and constructive responses to past\nconflict are dismissed by others as undermining the moral or political\nconditions for just and peaceful relations. Section 4 concentrates on\nthe relationship between reconciliation and justice. While some see\nthese values as compatible and mutually supporting, others argue that,\nespecially in the immediate wake of conflict, parties must often\nchoose between reconciliation and justice.\n", "toc": [{"#TypImp": "1.

Types of Improvement\n\nAt the most abstract level, reconciliation can be characterized as an\nimprovement in the relationship between two or more parties who were\npreviously in conflict. A relationship with another party consists of\npatterns of interaction, the attitudes one tends to take toward that\nparty, and the expectations of and beliefs about the other that one\nmakes. Five rough categories of improvement in relationships emerge\nfrom the literature:\n\nChanges in institutional structures: examples include policies for\npolice reform, for building the rule of law, for overcoming alienation\nfrom the existing institutional order, and for renewed participation\nin shared institutions or practices (C. Murphy 2010, Lu 2017); \nChanges in external behaviors: examples include a cessation of\naggressive or insulting behaviors, increased ability to function in\nclose proximity to the other party, and increased ability to cooperate\nwith the other party;\nChanges in belief: for example, loss of the belief that the other\nparty is inherently evil or of lower moral value compared to others,\nacceptance of a narrative of the past wrong according to which the\nother party once again seems predictable and coherent (Dwyer 1999),\nand belief that the other party is no longer likely to pose an\nunreasonable danger to oneself;\nResolving negative emotions and attitudes: in this category,\nexamples include merely accepting what cannot be changed; overcoming\nresentment, fear, hate or anger toward the wrongdoing party; as well\nas managing shame or guilt (Mihai 2016, Lu 2017).\nAdopting or resuming positive emotions and attitudes: e.g., mutual\nrespect, compassion, love, a shared sense of identity (Hirsch 2011b)\nor solidarity, mutual recommitment to a shared set of moral or\ncommunal norms, or mutual trust.\n\n\nThe term \u2018forgiveness\u2019 does not appear on this list,\nthough the substance of forgiveness may be broken down into these\ncategories. As section 3.8 explains, theorists disagree about how to\nanalyze forgiveness. While some see it as primarily a change in\nattitudes and emotions, others take forbearance from certain behaviors\nto be definitive of forgiveness.\n\nDifferent kinds of relationships (friends, employer/employee, fellow\ncitizens, citizen/official) are marked by distinct sets of\ninteractions, attitudes, and expectations. Different kinds of\nrelationships can also be distinguished by the norms to which they\nshould adhere. The legitimate expectations we have of our friends\ndiffer from those we have of our employees, strangers who are\nnevertheless fellow citizens, or those who are acting in official\nstate capacities. Some critics find the images of damaged and repaired\nrelationships rather strained, given that many of the cases of\ncriminal or political wrongdoing that are spoken of in these terms\ninvolve people who are strangers to one another (Sher 2013). In\nresponse, those who favor the language of relationships argue either\nthat the conflict itself creates a problematic relationship, which\nthen must be reshaped or repaired (Govier 2002), or that even\nstrangers hold attitudes and expectations of one another, as is\nrevealed by the resentful or indignant reactions we have when those\nstrangers violate our expectations (Scanlon 2008).\n\nIn speaking of reconciliation, it is important for theorists to\nspecify which of the relationships between two parties is\nbeing reconciled. For example, two individuals may be friends,\nco-workers, co-religionists, fellow citizens, and fellow members of\nthe Kantian Kingdom of Ends, among many other connections. After a\ndispute at work, two people may reconcile their working relationship\nbut not their friendship. On the other hand, they may decide that the\nonly way to save their friendship is by not working together anymore.\nOne cannot say whether they have reconciled without specifying which\nrelationship is in question.\n\nMost theorists of reconciliation allow that, not only pairs of\nindividuals, but also groups can be reconciled. Indeed, all of the\nfollowing combinations appear within the literature: the\nreconciliation of an individual with a small group (such as a family);\nan individual to a large group (such as a state); two smaller groups\nwith one another (such as two ethnic groups within a state); a smaller\ngroup with a large group (such as a minority group to a state); and\none group with a collection of groups (such as the international\ncommunity) (Govier and Verwoerd 2002a, Fabre 2016). Given that changes\nin beliefs and attitudes play a role in most accounts of\nreconciliation, these views put pressure on theorists to explain in\nwhat sense groups can be described as having beliefs and attitudes\n(cf. Griswold 2007).\n\nTheorists disagree about whether there is a general theory of\nreconciliation that can cover all kinds and types of relationship.\nSome theorists offer accounts of reconciliation designed to cover the\nrepair of a wide range of interpersonal and political relationships,\nincluding those among friends, co-workers, and fellow citizens (Govier\n2006). Such accounts recognize the above variations in relationships,\nbut present a general characterization of categories that can be\nfurther specified for relationships of different types. Other\ntheorists restrict their focus to a particular kind of relationship\n(C. Murphy 2010, May 2011).\n2. Defining Normative Standards\n\nReconciliation has as its goal improved relationships. Reconciliation\noften denotes restoration, which suggests a return to the status quo\nante, that is, the state of affairs before the wrong or conflict in\nquestion. This connotation has led some scholars to urge the use of\n\u2018conciliation\u2019 rather than \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in\ncontexts where groups or individuals have never lived according to\ngood, just relations, such as the white and black populations of South\nAfrica at the moment the apartheid regime fell (Krog 2008, Moon 2009).\nBut given the importance of the South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid\nexperiences to the literature on reconciliation, other scholars choose\nto brook the linguistic infelicity of defining the term\n\u2018reconciliation\u2019 so that it includes the pursuit of good\nrelations for the first time, and not merely the reestablishment of\nformerly good relations (Govier 2006, C. Murphy 2010, Philpott 2012).\nHere, the task is to articulate an account of improved relationships\nthat satisfies a normative standard for the relationship in question,\na standard that may not have been previously realized in practice.\n\nTheorists of reconciliation generally recognize that reconciliation is\na \u201cscalar\u201d concept, which allows for minimal and maximal\nversions of improved relationships (Crocker 1999, Griswold 2007). Each\nof the categories along which relationships might improve\n(institutions, behavior, beliefs, attitudes or emotions) admits of\ndegree. For example, in the aftermath of a dispute between friends,\nthe resumption of basic respect is a lower degree of emotional\nrestoration than the resumption of love and trust. In the aftermath of\nbloody civil war, the resumption of cooperation between two parties\nmay be described as a greater change in behavior than their mere\npeaceful coexistence. Maximal forms of political reconciliation are\ntypically identified as either civic friendship (May 2011),\nforgiveness (Tutu 1999), or political or national unity (for an\noverview of such conceptions see Allen 1999).\n\nThough the term \u2018reconciliation\u2019 can be used to pick out\nan entire range of phenomena, theorists will often make an argument\nfor somehow privileging one point on the scale. Some scholars attempt\nto fix the definition of reconciliation for a particular relational\ncontext by looking to the nature of the relationship in question. For\nexample, it may not make sense to talk about spouses as reconciled\nunless there is a reestablishment of trust, love and intimacy. Spouses\nmay get over their anger and resentment. They may cooperate\nsuccessfully in raising their children together. But if trust, love\nand intimacy are not restored they have not reconciled as\nspouses. Similarly, in order to define what is necessary for the\nreconciliation of parties as members of a moral community (Radzik\n2009), a political community (C. Murphy 2010), or the international\ncommunity (Barry 1980), we might look to the ideals that appropriately\ndefine those relationships. In the South African debate, some\ncommentators linked their conception of reconciliation to the moral\nvalue of ubuntu (Tutu 1999, Krog 2008). Ubuntu is\nfrequently summarized through the Zulu saying, \u201cumuntu\nngumuntu ngabantu,\u201d which can be translated as \u201ca\nperson depends on others to be a person\u201d (see, for example,\nMatolino and Kwindingwi 2013, who are more critical of the relevance\nof ubuntu in post-apartheid South Africa).\n\nThe debate about the nature of political reconciliation reflects a\nconcern, not only with ideals of political relationship, but also with\nnon-ideal facts about societies torn apart by injustice or violence.\nFor example, Bhargava (2012) defends a weak conception of\nreconciliation by emphasizing how significant an achievement peaceful\ncoexistence can be in the aftermath of atrocities. He worries that\nadvocating the pursuit of stronger forms of reconciliation will\nrequire that the past be forgotten, leaving the victims to absorb the\ncosts of that past without protest. In contrast, C. Murphy (2010)\nargues that minimal versions should be rejected, for they suggest that\nrelationships have been repaired and reconciliation achieved too\nquickly. A more robust notion of political reconciliation highlights\nthe profound impact of conflict and repression on political\ninteraction, and draws attention to the long-term and complex changes\nthe establishment of a just peace among those formerly in conflict\ndemands. Tutu (1999) suggests that forgiveness may be necessary for\nachieving a peaceful and stable political community. Others argue that\nefforts at reconciliation should aim somewhere between the extremes of\na mere cessation of aggression and full-fledged forgiveness.\nMoellendorf (2007), for example, claims that reconciliation involves\nformer enemies coming to see each other as fellow citizens, who should\nbe treated as equals. Gutmann and Thompson (2000) argue political\nreconciliation is oriented towards the cultivation of democratic\nreciprocity in interaction, which is a willingness to seek common\nground with fellow citizens on matters of public policy.\n\nAnother view, which emerges specifically out of the literature on\npolitical reconciliation, insists that reconciliation cannot be\ndefined pre-politically (Schaap 2005) or in a non-context specific\nmanner (Kofi Annan Foundation 2018). That is, the proper standards for\nreconciliation within a particular post-conflict society can only be\ndetermined through the free, deliberative and democratic processes of\nthat society (Crocker 2008). It follows that what counts as\nreconciliation in one context will not count in another.\n\nSome critics charge that even to pose the problem that faces\nconflict-ridden societies as an issue of reconciliation improperly\nassumes that the project of political unity is legitimate and thereby\nundermines calls for decolonization, secession or other forms of\ngreater political autonomy for disempowered groups (Woolford 2004,\nAlfred 2009, Jung 2018). Critics further argue that adopting the frame\nof a unifying rhetoric of reconciliation can blind the parties to\nroles that racial or ethnic identity, gender, colonization or\noppression played in bringing the atrocities about in the first place,\nas well as the lopsided distribution of harms that they have caused\n(Corntassel and Holder 2008, Grey and James 2016). Theorists in the\n\u201cagonistic\u201d tradition are also asking whether the concept\nof reconciliation can remain useful within a framework that assumes\nthat politics is and will properly remain confrontational (Hirsch\n2011a, Bohle 2017).\n3. Processes of Reconciliation\n\nProcesses of reconciliation are designed to contribute to the\nimprovement of relationships damaged as a result of wrongdoing. A wide\nrange of such processes is examined in the literature. One that is\nbrought up, more often in the context of objections to reconciliation\nrather than defenses, is forgetting (Hughes 2001, Bhargava 2012).\nSince the past cannot be changed, wrongdoing cannot be undone.\nTherefore, one might argue, the only way to overcome a painful past is\nto suppress the memory of it. Policies of forgetting in the name of\nreconciliation have been pursued by some states, including Cambodia,\nwhose prime minister advised his fellow citizens in 1999 \u201cto dig\na hole and bury the past,\u201d while granting amnesty from\nprosecution to Khmer Rouge leaders (Chandler 2003, 310).\n\nHowever, those theorists who defend the political and moral value of\nreconciliation more often reject the claim that reconciliation\nrequires forgetting. Instead, these defenders generally claim that\nknowledge and acknowledgement of wrongdoing, as well as recognition of\nthe victims, are crucial to successful reconciliation. Especially in\npolitical contexts, knowledge of basic facts is critical because often\nvictims and the broader political community do not know who was\nresponsible for the wrong suffered, nor the extent of violations\ncommitted. Acknowledgement refers to the official, public recognition\nof what happened. This is often needed to counter official denial of\nwrongdoing or responsibility for wrongdoing (Weschler 1998). The\nunspoken, Freudian assumption is that suppressed traumas will\ninevitably reemerge in destructive ways. The more explicit arguments\nare that the acknowledgement of wrongs and of victims helps heal\npsychic wounds (van Ness and Strong 2002), enable trust (Gibson 2004),\nreestablish normative standards for behavior (Walker 2006), and\nreassert that the victims are indeed members of the moral or political\ncommunity (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, du Toit 2000).\n\nAs will be discussed below, while there is wide agreement that the\nprocesses of reconciliation must acknowledge the wrongs of the past\nand the proper standing of victims, theorists debate precisely how\nsuch acknowledgements are best communicated, so that they will be\nsufficiently credible and effective in improving future relations.\nMore broadly, theorists debate how effective past processes of\nreconciliation have proven to be, and how to measure effectiveness\n(Bates et al. 2020)\n\nThere is also ongoing debate in the political realm about which wrongs\nmust be acknowledged and redressed. Violations of civil and political\nrights have historically been the focus of both theory and practice,\nbut scholars also argue for the importance of addressing violations of\neconomic and cultural rights (Mamdani 2000, Arbour 2007, Sharp 2015).\nTheorists also disagree about what else, besides acknowledgement, must\nbe achieved in order for reconciliation to be either likely or\nwarranted. Must material forms of harm be redressed? Must retributive\njustice be achieved? Must the parties forgive? Disagreements about\nidentifying necessary or appropriate processes are typically connected\nto the issue of the last section: disagreements about what degree of\nimprovement in relations can reasonably be pursued in the aftermath of\nwrongdoing. Finally, there is debate about who should decide which\nprocess of reconciliation is adopted in a given context. In the\npolitical context, this is in response to calls for greater local\nagency and decision-making (McEvoy 2007).\n3.1 Apologies\n\nApologizing is perhaps the most explicit way in which wrongdoing can\nbe acknowledged. A well-formed apology requires at least\nacknowledgement of both the fact of wrongdoing and responsibility by\nthe wrongdoer, as well as an expression of regret or remorse (Tavuchis\n1991). Ideally, the wrongdoer directly addresses the victim. This is\nnot possible in all cases, of course, as when victims have passed\naway. However, apologies made to indirect victims, such as the\nfamilies of the deceased, as well as apologies performed before\nbroader, interested communities are well established in practice. In\nrecent decades, official apologies, delivered by state entities or\ncorporations, have become more common, raising questions about the\nvalidity and significance of apologetic statements made by\nrepresentatives on behalf of groups (Harvey 1995, Gibney et al 2008),\nespecially when the events in question lie in the distant past\n(Pettigrove 2003).\n\nApologies are frequently valued, not merely as acknowledgements of\npast wrongdoing and gestures of respect to victims, but also as\nproviding evidence of a positive change in the wrongdoer or in the\nwrongdoers\u2019 group. Parties who have come to take responsibility\nfor and repudiate past wrongful actions are better candidates for\nrenewed relationships of cooperation and trust (de Greiff 2008). This\npotential is undermined, however, where apologies are overly vague,\nincomplete, or appear insincere. One may reasonably question whether\nmere admissions that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d (which do not\nown up to responsibility or specify what the mistakes themselves were)\nor that the speaker \u201cregrets if anyone took offense\u201d\n(which leaves open the question of whether the action was really\nwrong) qualify as apologies at all (Smith 2008). The importance of\nbeing sensitive to the gendered aspects of apology has also been\nhighlighted (MacLachlan 2013).\n\nWhile apologies are considered by some to make a significant\ncontribution to reconciliation (Brooks 2004, M. Murphy 2011), others\nworry that, in political cases, apologies may be used as a substitute\nfor more substantive forms of redress (Corntassel and Holder 2008).\nOfficial state apologies for systematic or historic injustices often\nresult only after protracted and heated debate, leaving little\npolitical will to move on to other forms of redress that may be more\nsignificant to the victimized group. Such dynamics give credence to\nthe view that apology may amount to a \u201cpolitics of\ndistraction\u201d (Corntassel and Holder 2008).\n3.2 Memorials\n\nMemorials take a number of different forms, such as monuments,\npreserved sites of important or tragic events, museums, archives,\nceremonies or educational activities (Barsalou and Baxter 2007,\nZembylas 2011). They may be officially or privately sponsored. Yet all\nprovide a shared focus for memory. Scholars argue that memorials of\npast wrongdoing have the potential to play a number of different roles\nin the process of reconciliation. First and foremost, they help\npreserve the memory of the past event, which counters any who would\ndeny or forget the past. They help consolidate a communal\nunderstanding of history and provide a shared focus for emotions, such\nas grief or remorse. By helping to forge a collective memory of the\npast, memorials may also help rebuild or reshape a sense of collective\nidentity (Harjes 2005). Commemorations provided by groups responsible\nfor wrongdoing may demonstrate a willingness to acknowledge\nresponsibility for such wrongs, (renewed) respect for the victims, and\ncommitment never to repeat such misdeeds (Barsalou and Baxter 2007,\nBlustein 2014). For the victimized group, a memorial can encourage\nself-respect, show fidelity to the dead, and help preserve their sense\nof themselves as a people (Blustein 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, memorials are frequently surrounded by controversy,\nas parties disagree over the version of history put forward or the\nmanner in which it is displayed (Minow 1998). Attempts to aestheticize\npast horrors may be offensive to some viewers (Young 2008). Memorials\nmay cynically divert attention from ongoing problems (Blustein 2014)\nor serve as a rallying point for those who would like to renew the\nconflict (Barsalou and Baxter 2007). Furthermore, the meanings of\nmemorials change over time, as they are continually reinterpreted by\nlater audiences inhabiting different political circumstances. There is\nthus no guarantee that a memorial that contributes to reconciliation\nat one point in time will continue to do so (Blustein 2014).\n3.3 Truth Telling\n\nBoth apologies and memorials combine an acknowledgment of a\ntroublesome past with the suggestion of an emotional reaction to that\npast, such as remorse, regret or grief. Yet, even without such\nemotional content, the communication of the facts of the past can play\na role in reconciliation. Individual victims and survivors often find\nthemselves unable to move on when they are uncertain about crucial\nfacts of the past. What precisely happened to their loved one? Did she\nsuffer? Who exactly committed the violent act? Who gave the order?\nWhere is the body buried? Moreover, in political contexts wrongdoing\nis frequently officially denied, either in the refusal to acknowledge\nthat violations of rights occurred or that a particular agent such as\nthe state was responsible for the violations that are known.\n\nTruth telling, some scholars claim, can ameliorate ongoing suffering\nof victims and survivors who lack information about what happened and\nwho was (or was not) responsible for abuses (Zalaquett 1995). It can\ncounter certain forms of denial (Zalaquett 1995, Dyzenhaus 2000) and\nhelp combat the social structures that cultivate ignorance among more\nprivileged populations (Regan 2010, Steyn 2012). Truth telling may\nalso serve as a way of making reparation for those not actually\nimplicated in crimes. Efforts to record and archive this information,\nas well as to distribute it in the form of educational materials, aim\nat ensuring that future generations will not repeat the past.\n\nIn restorative justice processes, criminals are often required to give\na narrative of the crime (Llewellyn and Howse 1999). In the political\nsphere, one formal mechanism for uncovering and documenting the past\nis a truth commission. Truth commissions are temporary official\ninstitutions established to examine patterns of specified human rights\nabuses over a given time period (Hayner 2010). Dozens of truth\ncommissions have been established in communities around the globe,\nincluding Chile, Chad, and Canada. Commission reports provide a\nsummary of such findings and typically issue recommendations on how to\nprevent such abuses in the future. These reports vary in the degree to\nwhich the proceedings and findings are made public. Some name\nindividual perpetrators and some do not. The South African Truth and\nReconciliation Commission, which was marked by a high degree of\nopenness, televised the testimony of many victims and\nperpetrators.\n\nIn the literature, a variety of claims are advanced regarding how\ntruth commissions can contribute to reconciliation, both among\nindividual perpetrators and victims as well as within national\ncommunities. At the individual level, talking through the past is\noften represented as a form of catharsis, wherein the trauma of the\npast can be re-experienced, dealt with, and let go. The South African\nTRC appeared to offer several examples of such a process, including\nspontaneous requests for forgiveness by perpetrators and offers of\nforgiveness by victims (Tutu 1999, South African Truth and\nReconciliation Commission Final Report 1998).\n\nIn terms of societal reconciliation, it is claimed that truth\ncommissions reintegrate victims in a number of ways. The very fact\nthat victims state publicly what happened to them contributes to\nre-establishing their civic and political dignity as well as\nparticipatory standing (Kiss 2000). Officially recording the wrongs\ndone to victims, which were typically officially denied in the past,\nreinforces the equal moral standing of victims (du Toit 2000). The\nreport produced by a commission, especially when made public, can\ncultivate collective reconciliation by aiding a community to alter its\nself-understanding. A narrative must be produced of how a community\ncould at once have a past full of abuses as well as a present and\nideal future in which those abuses are rejected (Dwyer 1999). It can\nalso challenge stereotypes that dehumanized members of the community\nin the past (C. Murphy 2010) and foster sympathy (Eisikovits 2009).\nThe proceedings and report of a truth commission can foster trust in\ninstitutions (Gibson 2004). By condemning actions of the past, truth\ncommissions reassert the force of normative standards that have been\nviolated, or establish new normative standards for conduct when the\nextant terms for a relationship are unjust or immoral (Walker 2010).\nTelling the truth is taken to be a form of reparation for victims\n(Zalaquett 1995, Walker 2010). Finally, the recommendations issued by\ncommissions can contribute to the prevention of future wrongdoing.\n\nTruth commissions remain controversial. Many of the criticisms target,\nnot the value of establishing the truth itself, but the means used to\nencourage perpetrators to testify, such as amnesty from prosecution.\nOthers object to the ways in which truth commissions (sometimes\nsubtly) pressure victims toward a forgiveness or reconciliation they\nmay want to resist (Dyzenhaus 2000, Gutmann and Thompson 2000, C.\nMurphy 2010), or question the psychological benefits of giving\ntestimony for victims (Hamber 2009). Still other critics of truth\ncommissions charge that the pursuit of narrative self-understanding is\nobjectionable, insofar as it tries to establish a single authoritative\ninterpretation of the past (Gutmann and Thompson 2000, Regan 2010).\nFinally, there are doubts about the reconciliatory effects of\ncommissions that uncover the truth, but fail to take action against\nthose implicated in wrongs (Hamber 2009).\n3.4 Amnesties\n\nAmnesties, which grant legal protection from civil and/or criminal\nliability, are a particularly controversial form of reconciliation\nprocess. Amnesty can be granted to individuals or classes of persons.\nIt can be granted unconditionally or conditionally. If conditional,\nthe granting of amnesty occurs only if certain provisions are met. For\nexample, in South Africa, perpetrators had to make a complete\ndisclosure of the rights violations for which they were responsible\nand demonstrate that such violations were committed for political\nreasons (Dyzenhaus 2000). Amnesties may also be conditional on\nnonrecidivism (Freeman 2011). Finally, amnesties vary in the extent to\nwhich they preclude other negative consequences (e.g., being fired)\n(Greenawalt 2000). \n\nA number of moral objections to amnesties have been raised. Amnesties\nseem at least prima facie unjust; specifically, amnesty\nprevents retributive and/or corrective justice from being done\n(Greenawalt 2000). Granting amnesty is claimed to be inimical to\ncountering historical impunity for political leaders and government\nagents responsible for egregious violations of human rights. And\nachieving the aspiration of \u201cNever Again\u201d seems\nintuitively less likely if future political leaders and actors believe\nthey will not be held accountable for their actions. The danger posed\nby amnesty policies is that, in failing to hold wrongdoers accountable\nand undermining the ability of victims to seek legal recourse for\ntheir harms, they may (inadvertently) send the message that the abuses\nof the past were not wrong or that the victims did not deserve better\ntreatment (Pensky 2008). Justified anger against the perpetrators will\nnot be exorcised, and may instead find expression in acts of\nrevenge.\n\nAmnesties continue to be used by states and in fact have increased in\nfrequency (Mallinder 2008). Communities adopt amnesties for a variety\nof reasons. Amnesties may encourage perpetrators to give full and\ntruthful testimony to truth commissions. Here, the value of\nremembering the past is emphasized. In contrast, as in Cambodia,\namnesties can be used as part of a strategy to forget the past.\nAmnesties also may be used to incentivize an end to conflict, as was\nthe case in South Africa (Dyzenhaus 2000).\n\nArguments for the moral permissibility of amnesty challenge the idea\nthat granting amnesty reinforces impunity or undermines stability and\njustice (Mallinder 2008). Freeman (2011) claims that amnesties can be\njustified as a measure of last resort, so long as victims are included\nin the process of deciding to pass an amnesty and amnesties are used\nfor the sake of facilitating an end to conflict or reconciliation.\nGreenawalt (2000) argues that amnesties can be justified when\nnecessary to prevent even greater injustice from occurring, such as\nviolations of human rights as part of an ongoing conflict. By\ndemonstrating mercy to perpetrators, amnesties might help end a cycle\nof violence (O\u2019Shea 2002).\n3.5 Trials and Punishment\n\nPunishment is the intentional infliction of harm or suffering on a\nwrongdoer in response to a wrong committed. Although transitional\nsocieties are sometimes portrayed as having to choose between\nreconciliation and punishment, these responses are not necessarily\nopposed (Bennett 2008, Verdeja 2009). As is often clear in\ninterpersonal or criminal cases, the punishment of a wrongdoer (and\nespecially the wrongdoer\u2019s acceptance of that punishment) can be\na process by which the wrongs of the past are redressed. The power of\npunishment to put the past to rest has been explained in a number of\ndifferent ways, such as repaying a debt, removing an unfair advantage\n(Morris 1968), satisfying the victim\u2019s anger (Hershenov 1999),\nor reaffirming the equal moral status of victims (Hampton 1992).\nImplicit in this last analysis is the assumption that wrongdoing is\nfundamentally expressive, and what is expressed is the inferior moral\nstanding of the victim, which permits the infliction of harm. Criminal\nprosecutions help victims re-gain sense of status as rights holder and\nso enhance dignity (Nino 1998, Bennett 2008).\n\nIn the context of transitions to democracy, some scholars concentrate\nspecifically on the significance of trials in response to collective\nand politically significant crimes, such as those involving human\nrights abuses by officials. Criminal trials mark a clear break from\nthe past (Malamud-Goti 1990). Trials signal the official disapproval\nof the actions for which an individual is being prosecuted, actions\nthat may not have been officially condemned before. Criminal trials\nand punishment are also claimed to make a crucial contribution to\nsocietal reconciliation by reaffirming the normative standards that\nshould govern interaction. Punishment can signify or cultivate a\ncommitment to the rule of law, as well as the faith in law and decency\namong officials upon which the rule of law depends (C. Murphy\n2010).\n\nOn the other hand, a number of scholars are skeptical about the\nreconciliatory impact of criminal trials, especially in response to\nwidespread wrongdoing. Judith Shklar (1964) and Hannah Arendt (1977)\nargue trials do little to heal victims wounded by wrongdoing and have\nlittle pedagogical role regarding the normative standards that should\ngovern relations. Trials fundamentally are oriented towards the\nestablishment of the guilt of individual perpetrators, not the pursuit\nof the truth about the past. This can lead to a very limited\nunderstanding of the collective character of the injustices\nperpetrated, their impact on victims and the broader context that made\nsuch wrongdoing possible, all of which may be important for\nreconciliation (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, Isaacs 2016). Moreover, the\nability of domestic criminal justice systems in transitional societies\nto adhere to internationally recognized procedural standards has been\nquestioned, as has the justifiability of selectively prosecuting only\na fraction of the perpetrators involved in collective crimes (van Zyl\n2000).\n3.6 Lustration\n\nLustration refers to legal measures that permit or require the\ninvestigation of individuals running for election, serving in the\nmilitary, or working in government agencies, universities, or the\nmedia. Individuals found to have connections to past injustices or\nperpetrating groups may then be publicly exposed or excluded from\nserving in public roles (David 2011). Such measures are frequently\nadopted during postwar occupations or in countries transitioning to\ndemocracy. Lustration is sometimes conceived of as a punitive measure,\nwhich opens practitioners up to charges of engaging in collective\nforms of punishment that ignore individual desert and violating\nprohibitions on retroactive law (Cohen 1995, Meierhenrich 2006).\nLustration has also been defended in forward-looking terms as a means\nof securing peace or a political transition as well as reestablishing\ntrust in government by assuring the public that past wrongdoers will\nno longer be in power (Chiu 2011). Criticisms of lustration as a means\nof pursuing political reconciliation highlight the potential for\nbiased application of the law (Cohen 1995), warn of the difficulties\nof re-establishing a functional government when much of the\nexperienced and educated workforce is excluded from participation\n(Hollywood 2007), and worry that lustration encourages the\ncontinuation of suspicion rather than cooperation among former enemies\n(Govier 2006).\n3.7 Reparations\n\nThe term \u2018reparations\u2019 has been used more and less broadly\nto refer to efforts to repair the harm that results from a wrong or\nconflict. A narrow use of the term refers to a transfer of land,\ngoods, or wealth that is intended to directly compensate for goods\nthat were taken, damaged or destroyed. The payment is made either by\nthe party who was responsible for the harm, by the wrongdoers\u2019\ndescendants or other beneficiaries, or potentially by a third party\nacting on the wrongdoers\u2019 behalf. This sort of transfer is\nperhaps better labeled \u2018restitution.\u2019 Transfers made in\nresponse to losses that are not literally replaceable or monetizable,\nsuch as deaths or injuries, are also referred to as restitution or\nreparation. A still broader use of the term includes material\ntransfers that have a more purely symbolic function. These payments\nare meant to send a conciliatory message of some sort rather than to\nsuggest that the wrong or harm is being paid back. One friend\u2019s\ngift to another after a quarrel could be an example of a symbolic\nreparation in everyday life. So could investments in the economy of a\nformer foe. The term \u2018reparations\u2019 is also used even more\nbroadly to include acts other than material transfers, such as\napologies or instances of truth-telling (Torpey 2003, Walker\n2010).\n\nAs we will discuss further in section 4, arguments for material\ntransfers may appeal directly to principles of corrective justice.\nThose commentators who defend material reparations in the name of\nreconciliation frequently interpret such payments as acknowledgements\nof responsibility, expressions of respect for the moral status of the\nvictims, acts of remorse or caring, evidence of increased\ntrustworthiness or a recommitment to the norms of justice (Thompson\n2002, Brooks 2004, Gray 2010, Walker 2010). Yet the meanings of\nreparations can change, be undermined or repudiated, depending on the\nmanner and context in which they are offered (Brooks 1999, Barkan\n2000, de Greiff 2006). Still, when combined with apologies,\ntruth-telling, and other measures, reparations have the potential to\nimprove relations. Perhaps more importantly, leaving identifiable\nharms uncompensated may undermine the effectiveness of apologies and\nother efforts to reconcile.\n\nReparations for historical injustice are particularly controversial.\nOne ongoing debate concerns the guilt or liability of those who would\npay, the claim-rights and connection to the victims of those who would\nreceive payment, and the difficulty in calculating the proper sum of\nrestitution (Waldron 1992, Wheeler 1997, Boxill 2003). Such debates\nsuggest that reparations are being interpreted as restitution, where\nthe legalistic logic of property rights and inheritance are paramount,\nrather than under the broader project of repairing relationships\n(Thompson 2002, Brooks 2004).\n\nVictims and their descendants, for their part, sometimes worry that\naccepting reparation payments may be seen as drawing a line under the\npast, as implying the moral debt is paid or that all is forgiven\n(Barkan 2000). They also object to the suggestion that the people and\nother valuable things lost could be repaid by money or other material\ngoods.\n3.8 Forgiveness\n\nThere is considerable disagreement, especially in the political\nliterature, on the relationship between forgiveness and\nreconciliation. Can parties be reconciled if forgiveness is refused?\nIs forgiveness genuine if the victim refuses to restore her\nrelationship with the wrongdoer? In part, differences of opinion on\nthese matters are traceable to the sorts of disagreements about\ndefining reconciliation that have been surveyed here (namely,\nregarding the kinds and degrees of improvement that must be made\nbefore a specific kind of relationship may be described as\nreconciled). Similar disagreements over the nature of forgiveness\ncomplicate matters even further.\n\nIn the literature on interpersonal forgiveness, definitions of\nforgiveness commonly focus on the overcoming or forswearing of\nresentment (or similar negative attitudes) that were the result of\nwrongdoing, and (some would add) the reestablishment of positive\nattitudes, such as goodwill, toward the wrongdoer (J. Murphy 2003,\nPettigrove 2012). Where such changes in attitude do not occur, but\nwhere the parties to the wrong manage to reestablish peaceful\ncoexistence, cooperation or even trust, talk of reconciliation seems\nreasonable. This would be a case of reconciliation without\nforgiveness. Similarly, a victim might let go of her resentment of\nsomeone who mistreated her and yet take steps to avoid future contact\nwith that person out of concern for her safety. Such a case exhibits\nforgiveness without reconciliation. Forgiveness and reconciliation, on\nthis account, appear to be distinct and independent phenomena.\n\nStill, the attitude-centered account of forgiveness is compatible with\nthe view that forgiving is a powerful means to reconciliation. The\nsorts of negative attitudes that are overcome by forgiveness are\npowerful obstacles to good relations. When those attitudes are\nresolved, reconciliation is an unsurprising result. It also makes\nsense, given this view of forgiveness, to argue that a case of\nreconciliation that does not include forgiveness is less complete than\none that does include forgiveness. Depending on the circumstances, an\nimprovement in relations that leaves resentment and ill will in place\nmay not seem worthy of the label \u2018reconciliation.\u2019 In\nthese cases, one might say that forgiveness is necessary for\nreconciliation.\n\nWhen commentators work with a different conception of forgiveness, the\ndiscussion of reconciliation is also different. One alternative view of\nforgiveness, which appears to be more popular in political than\ninterpersonal contexts, places emphasis on the actions of victims\nrather than their internal mental states, suggesting that when a\nperson or group forgives they gives up their moral right to hold the\nwrong against the wrongdoer (Digeser 2001, Wolterstorff 2013). Such\nviews have been labeled \u2018relational\u2019 or\n\u2018commissive\u2019 accounts of forgiveness (Blustein 2014,\nPettigrove 2012). Exactly how much one gives up in forgiving is not\nalways specified and opinions seem to differ. At a minimum, the victim\nforswears his right to personally retaliate against the wrongdoer. But\ndoes forgiving entail that he also forswears calling for punishment by\nthe proper authorities, or reparations for the harms he suffered, or\nhis right to remind the wrongdoer and others of the wrong? If one\nthinks of forgiveness as relinquishing a (more or less broad) right to\nhold a wrong against a wrongdoer, then it seems forgiveness may well\nbe productive of reconciliation. However, depending on how much\nvictims give up in forgiving, this kind of reconciliation may be\npurchased at the cost of justice (Blustein 2014). In contrast, those\nwho think of forgiving as the overcoming of resentment often argue\nthat victims can forgive yet also call for punishment, reparations and\nremembrance of the wrong (J. Murphy 2003).\n\nHowever one defines forgiveness, the claim that victims should forgive\nin order to bring about valuable reconciliation is likely to be\ncontroversial because it asks the very people who were most deeply\ninsulted, wronged and harmed by the past conflict to bear the burden\nof repairing it. Another point of concern is whether the victims are\nbeing asked to forgive unconditionally (that is, without any prior,\nameliorative response from the wrongdoer) or conditionally (that is,\nin response to a morally significant change in or act by the\nwrongdoer) (Garrard and McNaughton 2011). Furthermore, whether or not\na particular act of forgiveness would be morally appropriate,\nvirtuous, or even prudent for the victim, pressuring a victim to\nforgive is widely regarded as problematic (Govier and Verwoerd\n2002b).\n\nEfforts to make forgiveness central to reconciliation also run into\nquestions about who has the standing to forgive. To forgive on behalf\nof a living victim is morally unacceptable, if not simply impossible\n(Govier and Verwoerd 2002b). Some theorists also hold that it is\nimpossible to forgive on behalf of deceased victims, from which it\nfollows that wrongs such as murder will be unforgivable\n(Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch 2005). In these cases, the possibility of\na reconciliation that is distinct from forgiveness offers a way to\nconceive of a positive resolution of the past. Theorists debate\nwhether states or other groups might have the standing to forgive on\ntheir own behalf, independent of the choices of individual victims.\nThose who think of forgiveness as primarily a change in attitudes must\nmake sense of attributing such mental states to groups, perhaps by\nexplaining how attitude changes in representative persons (such as\nleaders or spokespeople) qualify as group forgiveness (cf. Griswold\n2007). The claim that groups can forgive is easier to make for those\nwho think of forgiveness as the waiving of a set of rights\n(Wolterstorff 2013).\n3.9 Participation in Deliberative Processes\n\nAt this point, a wide variety of processes that promise to repair\nrelationships in the aftermath of wrongdoing or conflict have been\nreviewed. Perhaps one of the greatest factors in determining whether\nreconciliation efforts will be successful is the manner in which they\nare selected. A number of measures (e.g., apologies, truth telling)\nare aimed at restoring a sense of dignity and inclusion to formerly\nmistreated or disempowered parties. This effect may be magnified if\nthose parties also have a say, for example, in choosing criminal\ntrials or truth commissions, determining the form reparations would\ntake, or designing memorials.\n\nRestorative justice approaches to criminal sentencing place a premium\non victims\u2019 participation (Johnstone 2002). In practices such as\nsentencing conferences and victim-offender mediation, the victim plays\nan active role in determining the manner in which the offender will\nmake up for her crime. In this way, the victim has a greater chance of\nreceiving a form of satisfaction that he will value more (e.g.,\nrestitution payments rather than the imprisonment of the offender).\nThe victim\u2019s active participation may also provide him with an\nopportunity to exorcise his resentments or fears, restore his sense of\ncontrol over his life, and reaffirm his status as a valued member of\nthe community who should not have been mistreated (Johnstone\n2002).\n\nRestorative justice models also value the active participation of\noffenders in finding a resolution to wrongdoing (Zehr 1990). For\nexample, offenders may be asked to propose forms of reparation they\ncould offer to victims. In being allowed an opportunity to play a role\nin building a better future, the offender may avoid a dangerous\nrage-shame spiral and regain a sense of self-worth (Braithwaite\n2000).\n\nIn political cases, the roles of victim and perpetrator are often not\nclear-cut or agreed upon. Here, incorporating input from the various\nparties to the conflict in designing reconciliation processes will\nincrease the chances that those measures will be viewed as legitimate\nacross the entire community (Barsalou and Baxter 2007). Inclusive\ndeliberative processes for the selection, design, and interpretation\nof reconciliation efforts can also provide a valuable model for the\nfuture of the community (Crocker 1999, Anker 2016). The future will\nnever be free of conflict, so an appropriate goal of reconciliation\nprocesses is to establish norms for resolving disagreements in a\npeaceful, just and equitable manner.\n4. Reconciliation and Justice\n\nWrongdoing has implications for multiple moral values, including, most\nfundamentally, justice. Justice-based concerns traditionally dominate\nphilosophical discussions of responding to wrongdoing. What is the\nrelationship between justice and reconciliation? Discussion of this\nquestion occurs most explicitly in the political context, especially\nin debates about the moral justifiability of non-punitive responses to\nwrongdoing such as truth commissions. This section provides an\noverview of the various positions that have been advanced concerning\nthe relationship between justice and reconciliation.\n\nWhether reconciliation is compatible with justice turns, of course, on\nhow one conceives of justice. In some parts of the literature, the\nquestion concerns corrective justice. For example, critics object to\ncalls for reconciliation that are not accompanied with restitution for\nharms suffered, such as the appropriation of land (Alfred 2009). In\nsection 3.7, we describe how, in other cases, restitution and\nreparation are defended as a means to reconciliation. However, as\nHoward McGary (2010 argues, here too there is a tension between\njustice and reconciliation. Principles of restitution are generally\ntaken to be backward-looking, in the sense that the past action of\nwrongful taking itself provides sufficient grounds for making the\nvictims whole. Bringing in the rhetoric of reconciliation suggests\ninstead that the reason for the transfer of goods is to secure better\nfuture relations among wrongdoers and victims. McGary argues that this\nforward-looking goal of reconciliation can insultingly suggest that a\nconcern for corrective justice is an insufficient reason to compensate\nthe victim--that justice for these victims is only worth securing when\nit is also in the interest of the wrongdoers.\n\nFor many other theorists, especially those writing about transitional\ncontexts, justice is assumed to be \u2018retributive justice\u2019\n(see the entry on\n retributive justice).\n The core claim of retributivists is that perpetrators of wrongdoing\ndeserve to suffer a proportional punishment. Justice is a matter of\nholding wrongdoers accountable by giving them the negative treatment\nthey deserve.\n\nAgainst this background, one view is that reconciliation and\nretributive justice are in tension with one another. Whereas\nretributive justice focuses on delivering a punishment that fits the\npast crime, reconciliation is concerned with bringing about future\ngood relations. The conflict between justice and reconciliation is\nvisible when individuals or communities choose non-punitive responses\nin hopes of securing peace. According to one view, insofar as\ntransitional societies do not punish wrongdoers, they promote\nreconciliation at a significant moral cost: they sacrifice justice.\nAuthors debate whether this sacrifice may be all-things-considered\nmorally justified, given the exigencies of transitional societies\n(Mendez 1997, Dwyer 1999, Greenawalt 2000).\n\nAnother way of framing the relationship between retributive justice\nand reconciliation is to see doing justice, conceptualized as\npunishment, as contributing to reconciliation (Verdeja 2009, C. Murphy\n2010). From this perspective, retributive justice and reconciliation\nare not fundamentally or necessarily in conflict. Justice may even be\na precondition for reconciliation in cases where allowing impunity for\nserious wrongdoing would fuel resentment and undermine trust in\ninstitutions. Even if individual wrongdoers are further alienated by\npunitive measures, holding them accountable may be productive of a\nbroader reconciliation among victims and other members of the\ncommunity, as well as among future generations.\n\nInstead of conceptualizing the relationship between justice and\nreconciliation through the processes that promote each value, a\ndifferent set of views consider instead the core moral concerns\nconstitutive of each value. According to some scholars, reconciliation\nand justice are compatible, though distinct, moral values, and a\nvariety of processes can respond to the moral concerns each value\ntakes up (Allen 1999, Allais 2012). That is, responses to wrongdoing\ncan be just and conducive to reconciliation in different degrees.\nResponses to wrongdoing may promote some aspects of justice (such as\ndemands for recognition of victims and accountability for\nperpetrators), but not others. For example, this view can accommodate\nthe claim, made during the South African TRC, that wrongdoers are held\naccountable when they are required to undergo the shaming experience\nof testifying publicly to their crimes (Final Report, 1998, vol. 1,\nch. 1, para 35). Similarly, they may foster some dimensions of\nreconciliation (such as epistemic or attitudinal changes), but not\nothers.\n\nA final view is that reconciliation is (part or all of)\njustice (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, Philpott 2012). Theorists who adopt\nthis position regard it as a mistake to equate justice with\nretributive justice. In the view of advocates of restorative justice,\njustice is fundamentally about repairing damaged relationships.\nChairman Rev. Desmond Tutu famously responds to the criticism of the\nTRC\u2019s decision not to pursue retributive justice by saying,\n\u201cWe believe, however, that there is another kind of justice\n\u2013 a restorative justice which is concerned not so much with\npunishment as with correcting imbalances, restoring broken\nrelationships \u2013 with healing, harmony and reconciliation\u201d\n(Final Report, Vol. 1, Ch. 1, para. 36). It is difficult to\nprovide a definitive account of restorative justice. However, the\nemphasis is on achieving a morally appropriate state of relations,\nwhere victims\u2019 needs for recognition, security and reparations\nare given special emphasis (Kiss 2000, Walker 2006). Thus, to promote\nreconciliation is to promote justice. Insofar as holding wrongdoers\naccountable through punishment helps restore morally appropriate\nattitudes, norms and interactions among the victim, the wrongdoer, and\nthe community, punishment is compatible with restorative justice.\nHowever, retribution is not valued for its own sake.\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has explored the various ways that the repair of\nrelationships is conceptualized in the literature, and the processes\nthat are claimed to foster such repair. One lingering question\nremains: what value is there in the pursuit of relational repair? The\nsection on justice suggests two, not incompatible, answers. The\nprocess of repairing relationships is most obviously valuable and\nimportant because of the other goods it enables individuals and\ncommunities to achieve. In the political context, the cessation of\nviolence, the prevention of future violence, and the attainment of\ndemocracy are some values that may be promoted. In more interpersonal\ncontexts, the benefits of relational repair include the avoidance of\nfurther harms to one\u2019s interests, including the psychological\nburden of resentment, or the goods that continued interaction bring,\nsuch as material profit through ongoing trade. But in addition to\nthese sorts of instrumental value, one might also argue that\nreconciliation is valuable for its own sake.
