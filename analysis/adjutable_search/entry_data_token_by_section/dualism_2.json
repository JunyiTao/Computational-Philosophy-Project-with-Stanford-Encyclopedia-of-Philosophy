    "main_text": "Varieties of Dualism: Ontology || Predicate dualism\n2.1 Predicate dualism\n\n\nPredicate dualism is the theory that psychological or mentalistic\npredicates are (a) essential for a full description of the world and\n(b) are not reducible to physicalistic predicates. For a mental\npredicate to be reducible, there would be bridging laws connecting\ntypes of psychological states to types of physical ones in such a way\nthat the use of the mental predicate carried no information that could\nnot be expressed without it. An example of what we believe to be a\ntrue type reduction outside psychology is the case of water, where\nwater is always H2O: something is water if and only if it\nis H2O. If one were to replace the word \u2018water\u2019\nby \u2018H2O\u2019, it is plausible to say that one could\nconvey all the same information. But the terms in many of the special\nsciences (that is, any science except physics itself) are not\nreducible in this way. Not every hurricane or every\ninfectious disease, let alone every devaluation of the\ncurrency or every coup d\u2019etat has the same constitutive\nstructure. These states are defined more by what they do than\nby their composition or structure. Their names are classified\nas functional terms rather than natural kind\nterms. It goes with this that such kinds of state are\nmultiply realizable; that is, they may be constituted by\ndifferent kinds of physical structures under different\ncircumstances. Because of this, unlike in the case of water and\nH2O, one could not replace these terms by some more basic\nphysical description and still convey the same information. There is\nno particular description, using the language of physics or chemistry,\nthat would do the work of the word \u2018hurricane\u2019, in the way\nthat \u2018H2O\u2019 would do the work of\n\u2018water\u2019. It is widely agreed that many, if not all,\npsychological states are similarly irreducible, and so psychological\npredicates are not reducible to physical descriptions and one has\npredicate dualism. (The classic source for irreducibility in the\nspecial sciences in general is Fodor (1974), and for irreducibility in\nthe philosophy of mind, Davidson (1971).)\n",
