    "main_text": "Language and Psychology || Pragmatic Meaning\n3.1 Pragmatic Meaning\n\nStevenson intends to provide a theory of emotive and descriptive\nmeaning in the \u201cpragmatic\u201d or \u201cpsychological\u201d\nsense, where this sense of \u2018meaning\u2019 invokes the work of\nCharles Morris. In Foundations of the Theory of Signs (1938),\nMorris had suggested a tripartite division of the study of signs into\n(i) syntax, the study of the relations among signs; (ii) semantics,\nthe study of the relations among signs and their designations or\ndenotations; and (iii) pragmatics, the study of signs as they are used\nby members of a community in order to \u201cmeet more satisfactorily\ntheir individual and common needs\u201d (10), that is, the study of\nsigns as they are used to coordinate mental and social life. Taking\nhis cue from Morris, Stevenson seeks to provide a theory of meaning in\nterms of the \u201cpsychological reactions\u201d of those who use\nthe signs (1944, 42), and, then, to distinguish emotive and\ndescriptive meaning by the different types of psychological reaction\nassociated with the use of emotive and descriptive language\nrespectively.\n\nAccording to Stevenson, explaining emotive and descriptive meaning in\nthis psychological sense of \u2018meaning\u2019 would be promising\nif it did not encounter an immediate problem that \u201chas long been\none of the most troublesome aspects of linguistic theory\u201d (1944,\n42; 1937, 20). The problem, as Stevenson saw it, is that the meaning\nof an expression must be relatively stable across a variety of social\nand linguistic contexts, lest the expression be unhelpful to our\nunderstanding of the many contexts in which the expression is used;\nhowever, the psychological states associated with an expression vary\nwidely across social and linguistic contexts. At a football game, for\nexample, \u2018Hooray!\u2019 may be shouted in connection with\nterrific excitement, but at other times with little emotion at all;\nlikewise, to a postmaster who regularly sorts the mail,\n\u201c\u2018Connecticut\u2019 may cause only a toss of the hand,\nbut for an old resident it may bring a train of reminiscences\u201d\n(1944, 43). Similarly, the sentence \u2018This legislation is\njust\u2019 may be used to express a favorable attitude towards a\nparticular piece of legislation, but not when embedded within the more\ncomplex sentence \u2018Vote for this legislation only if it is\njust\u2019. Thus,\n\n\nSome variation (of psychological states) must of course be allowed,\nelse we shall end with a fictitious entity, serene and thoroughly\nuseless amid the complexities of actual practice; but\n\u2018meaning\u2019 is a term wanted for marking off something\nrelatively constant amid these complexities, not merely for paying\nthem deference. A sense is needed where a sign may \u2018mean\u2019\nless than it \u2018suggests\u2019\u2014a sense in which meanings\nare helpful to the understanding of many contexts, not some\nvagrant sense in which a word has a wholly different\n\u2018meaning\u2019 every time it is used. (1944, 43)\n\n\nStevenson\u2019s task, then, is to provide a psychological theory of\nmeaning according to which the psychological state associated with an\nexpression\u2019s use, and hence an expression\u2019s meaning, remains\nrelatively constant across contexts.\n",
