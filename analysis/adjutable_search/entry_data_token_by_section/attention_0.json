    "main_text": "Historical Overview || Descartes: Attention and Epistemology\n1.1 Descartes: Attention and Epistemology\n\nIn the early modern period a variety of explanatory roles were\nassigned to attention by a number of different writers.\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations provides one prominent example.\nThe result of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation\u2014that everything\ncan be doubted\u2014is in apparent tension with his Third\nMeditation\u2019s claim that clear and distinct ideas are beyond\ndoubt. Descartes introduces a claim about attention to resolve this\napparent conflict. He says, in reply to the seventh set of objections,\nthat it is only when we pay attention to them that clear and distinct\nideas provide a place where doubt does not take hold:\n\nSo long as we attend to a truth which we perceive very clearly, we\ncannot doubt it. But when, as often happens, we are not attending to\nany truth in this way, then even though we remember that we have\npreviously perceived many things clearly, nevertheless there will be\nnothing which we may not justly doubt so long as we do not know that\nwhatever we clearly perceive is true. (\u2018Replies to\nObjections\u2019, 309)\n\n\nThis passage is usually cited for the point that it makes about\nmemory, but the picture that Descartes is here outlining is also one\nin which attention has an important epistemic role to play: clarity\nand distinctness realize their epistemic potential only when attention\nis being paid to the ideas that have them. Those ideas can be doubted,\nas, in accordance with the policy of the First Meditation they must\nbe, but that doubt cannot be maintained by a properly attentive\nthinker. The crucial first move in Descartes\u2019\nepistemology\u2014the move from radical doubt to certainty about the\ntruth of particular clear and distinct ideas\u2014is, therefore, a\ntransition that is mediated by attention.\n",
