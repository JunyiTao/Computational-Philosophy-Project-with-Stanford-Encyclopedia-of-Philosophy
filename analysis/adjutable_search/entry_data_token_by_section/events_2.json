    "main_text": "Events and Other Categories || Events vs. Properties\n1.3 Events vs. Properties\n\nA third metaphysical category with which events have sometimes been\ncontrasted is that of properties. If events are individuals, then they\nare not properties, at least insofar as properties are construed as\nuniversals. Individuals exist or occur whereas universals recur.\nHowever, some philosophers have taken very seriously the intuition\nthat in some cases events may be said to recur, as when we say that\nthe sun rises every morning (Chisholm 1970; Braude 1971; Johnson 1975;\nBrandl 1997, 2000). If so, then it is natural to think of events as\nbeing more similar to properties than to individuals, similar enough\nto justify treating them as a kind of property\u2014e.g., as\nproperties of moments or intervals of time (Montague 1969), properties\nof cross-world classes of individuals (Lewis 1986b), or properties of\nsets of world segments (von Kutschera 1993). For instance, on the\nfirst of these accounts, the event of the sun\u2019s rising is the\nproperty of being an interval during which the sun rises. As a\ncharacterization of event types, this would be uncontroversial and\nwould allow one to construe particular events as tokens of the\ncorresponding type. (One such construal would correspond to the\nabove-mentioned conception of events as property exemplifications.)\nBut to conceive of events as universal properties is to go beyond this\nuncontroversial fact and to reject the existence of event tokens\naltogether, even when it comes to \u201cparticular\u201d events such\nas the unique rising of the sun that we witnessed this morning. Rather\nthan an instance of the universal sun rising, such an event\nwould be a universal in its own right, albeit a universal of such a\nrestricted sort and of such a degree of singularity as to be\ninstantiated only once.\n\nOne possible view about properties is that they are not universals but\nrather particulars of a special sort\u2014viz. abstract particulars\n(Stout 1923) or tropes (Williams 1953). According to this view, the\nredness of this apple is different from the redness of anything else,\nnot because of its extreme singularity (other things could agree with\nthe apple colorwise) but because it is the redness of this\napple. It exists here and now, where and while the apple exists.\nLikewise, this morning\u2019s rising of the sun would be numerically\ndifferent from (though qualitatively similar to) any other\nmorning\u2019s rising of the sun. If so, then the view that events\nare properties becomes compatible with the view that they are\nspatiotemporally located. An event would just be a particularized\nproperty located at some region of space-time (Bennett 1996). (Once\nagain, this conception is closely related to the conception of events\nas property exemplifications, although the term\n\u2018exemplification\u2019 suggests a construal of properties as\nuniversals. Some authors, e.g. Bennett 1988, actually identify the two\nconceptions; others, e.g. Macdonald 1989, reject the identification on\naccount of the difference between property instances and property\nexemplifications.)\n\nA variant of the trope conception construes events as trope sequences\n(Campbell 1981). However, since tropes are particulars, a sequence of\ntropes at a place may itself be viewed as a trope, hence this variant\nis best regarded as a specification of what sort of tropes events are.\nSimilar remarks apply to those theories that construe events as\nrelational tropes (Mertz 1996), or even as higher-order tropes\n(Moltmann 2013). \n",
