    "main_text": "The Ethics of Duty, Not of Rights\n10. Conclusion\n\n\nAfrican morality is founded on humanism, the doctrine that considers\nhuman interests and welfare as basic to the thought and action of the\npeople. It is this doctrine as understood in African moral thought\nthat has given rise to the communitarian ethos of the African\nsociety. For, ensuring the welfare and interests of each member of\nsociety can hardly be accomplished outside the communitarian society.\nThe communitarian ethos is also borne of beliefs about the natural\nsociality of the human being, expressed, for instance, in the Akan\nmaxim, previously referred to, that says that \u201cwhen a human\nbeing descends from the heavens, he descends into a human\ntown\u201d(onipa firi soro besi a, obesi onipa\nkurom). Social or community life is, thus, not optional to the\nhuman being. Social life, which follows upon our natural sociality,\nimplicates the individual in a web of moral obligations, commitments,\nand duties to be fulfilled in pursuit of the common good or the\ngeneral welfare.\n\n\nThus, African humanitarian ethics spawns social morality, the\nmorality of the common good, and the morality of duty that is so\ncomprehensive as to bring within its compass what are referred to as\nmoral ideals (such as love, virtue, compassion), which are considered \nsupererogatory in Western ethics. But central or basic\nto the African morality is character, for the success of the moral life\nis held to be a function of the quality of an individual's\npersonal life. A moral conception of personhood is held in African\nethics, the conception that there are certain basic moral norms and\nideals to which the conduct of the individual human being, if he is a\nperson, ought to conform. The recognition in the African ethical\ntraditions of all human beings as brothers by reason of our common\nhumanity is indeed a lofty moral ideal that must be cherished and made\na vital or robust feature of global ethics in our contemporary world.\nIt is a bulwark against developing bigoted attitudes toward peoples of\ndifferent cultures or skin colors who are, also, members of the\nuniversal human family called race.\n",
