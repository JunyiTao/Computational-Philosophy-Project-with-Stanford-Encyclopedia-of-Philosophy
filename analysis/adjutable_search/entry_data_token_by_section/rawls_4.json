    "main_text": "Aims and Method || Reflective Equilibrium\n2.4 Reflective Equilibrium\n\nThe aim of political philosophy is to reach justified conclusions\nabout how political life should proceed. For Rawls, how justified one\nis in one\u2019s political convictions depends on how close one is to\nachieving reflective equilibrium. In reflective equilibrium\nall of one\u2019s beliefs, on all levels of generality, cohere\nperfectly with one another.\n\nThus, in reflective equilibrium one\u2019s specific political\njudgments (e.g., \u201creligious intolerance is unjust,\u201d\n\u201cracial discrimination is unjust\u201d) support one\u2019s\nmore general political convictions (e.g., \u201call citizens have\ncertain basic rights\u201d) which support one\u2019s very abstract\nbeliefs about the political world (e.g., \u201call citizens are free\nand equal\u201d). Viewed from the opposite direction, in reflective\nequilibrium one\u2019s abstract beliefs explain one\u2019s more\ngeneral convictions, which in turn explain one\u2019s specific\njudgments. Were one to attain reflective equilibrium, the\njustification of each belief would follow from all beliefs relating in\nthese networks of mutual support and explanation.\n\nThough perfect reflective equilibrium is unattainable, one can use the\nmethod of reflective equilibrium to get closer to it and so\nincrease the justifiability of one\u2019s beliefs. In carrying\nthrough this method, one begins with one\u2019s considered moral\njudgments: those made consistently and without hesitation when one is\nunder good conditions for thinking (e.g., \u201cslavery is\nwrong,\u201d \u201call citizens are political equals\u201d). One\ntreats these considered judgments as provisional fixed points, and\nthen starts the process of bringing one\u2019s beliefs into relations\nof mutual support and explanation as described above. Doing this\ninevitably brings out conflicts where, for example, a specific\njudgment clashes with a more general conviction, or where an abstract\nprinciple cannot accommodate a particular kind of case. One proceeds\nby revising these beliefs as necessary, striving always to increase\nthe coherence of the whole.\n\nCarrying through this process of mutual adjustment brings one closer\nto narrow reflective equilibrium: coherence among one\u2019s\ninitial beliefs. One then adds to this narrow equilibrium one\u2019s\nresponses to the major theories in the history of political\nphilosophy, as well as one\u2019s responses to theories critical of\npolitical philosophizing as such. One continues to adjust one\u2019s\nscheme of beliefs as one reflects on these alternatives, aiming for\nthe end-point of wide reflective equilibrium, in which\ncoherence is maintained after many alternatives have been\nconsidered.\n\nBecause of its emphasis on coherence, reflective equilibrium is often\ncontrasted with foundationalism as an account of justified belief.\nWithin foundationalist approaches, some subset of beliefs is\nconsidered to be unrevisable, thereby serving as a foundation on which\nall other beliefs are to be based. Reflective equilibrium privileges\nno such subset of beliefs: any belief at any level of generality is\nsubject to revision, if revision will help to bring one\u2019s\nconsidered convictions into greater coherence overall.\n",
