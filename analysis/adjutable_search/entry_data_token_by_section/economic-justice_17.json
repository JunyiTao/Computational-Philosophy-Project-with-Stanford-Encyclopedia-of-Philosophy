    "main_text": "Fair allocation\n6. Fair allocation\n\nThe theory of fair allocation studies the allocation of resources in\neconomic models. The seminal contribution is Kolm (1972), where the\ncriterion of equity as no-envy is extensively analyzed with the\nconceptual tools of general equilibrium theory. Later the theory\nborrowed the axiomatic method from bargaining theory, and it now\ncovers a great variety of economic models and encompasses a variety of\nfairness concepts.\n\nThere are several surveys of this theory: Thomson and Varian (1985),\nMoulin and Thomson (1997), Maniquet (1999), Thomson (2011).\n",
