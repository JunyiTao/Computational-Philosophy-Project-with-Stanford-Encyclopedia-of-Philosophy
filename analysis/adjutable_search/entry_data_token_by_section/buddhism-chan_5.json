    "main_text": "Ethical Dimensions of Chan\n6. Conclusion\n\nChan\u2019s iconoclastic rhetoric and its fondness for using such\napparently negative terms as no-thought, no-mind and no-cultivation as\ncardinal points of liberating practice might suggest seeing Chan as a\npremodern form of deconstructivism. But given its affirmation of\nBuddhist teachings about karma and the role of values and\nintentionality in shaping experience, Chan might just as well be seen\nas constructivist. The humor and apparent absurdity of Chan\u2019s\npremier literary form\u2014vernacular encounter dialogues\u2014might\nalternatively suggest existentialist leanings, while its celebrations\nof everyday life, embodied action and doing what works now rather than\nfollowing past precedents can be seen as pragmatic. Philosophically,\nChan presents itself as an enigma.\n\nAt the same time, Chan had profound impacts culturally. In China, Chan\nideals of personal vitality and responsive virtuosity found ongoing\nvisual expression in calligraphy and painting, and literary expression\nin poetry. And as Chan spread to other parts of East Asia, these\nideals came also to be infused into the performance arts of music, tea\nceremony and drama. The distinctive ways in which Chan wedded\nnonduality or metaphysical ambiguity with a moral aesthetics of\nimprovisation opened real possibilities for imagining presence as\nalready liberating.\n\nThe nature of the relationship between the enigmas that Chan presents\nphilosophically and the cultural productivity of its personal and\naesthetic ideals remains open. In East Asia, exploring that openness\nhistorically proved to be a powerful means of addressing the\npredicament of culture and the discomforts of cultural difference.\nSimilar explorations are now ongoing elsewhere as Chan, Zen, S\u00f4n\nand Thi\u1ec1n traditions of thought and practice have begun taking\nroot in other parts of the world. In this new global context, engaging\nin philosophical conversation with Chan signals distinctive\nopportunities for exploring the means-to and meanings-of truly\nintercultural philosophy.\n",
