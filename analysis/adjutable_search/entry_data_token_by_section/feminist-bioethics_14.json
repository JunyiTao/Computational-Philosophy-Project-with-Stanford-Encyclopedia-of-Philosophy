    "main_text": "Feminist Contributions to Thematic Areas || Practices of care\n5.2 Practices of care\n\nFeminist ethics\u2019 theoretical contribution to the ethic of care\nwas discussed in section 4. This section considers feminist\nbioethics\u2019 critical examination of the practices of health and\nother forms of care. Mainstream bioethics rarely focuses on care as a\ncore ethical practice, and when it does, it generally fails to\ndistinguish between the different types of care performed by nurses,\npersonal care assistants, care workers and others, and fails to\nhighlight the economic and political invisibility of the unpaid care\nwork provided by family members (Parks 2003).\n\nFor bioethics, care ethics focuses primarily on relationships in the\nclinical setting or the home, and on the micro level of interactions\nbetween individual caregiver or healthcare professional and care\nrecipient. Feminist care ethics notes that the mundane labor of care\nis low status and poorly paid, and (not unrelatedly) strongly\ngendered, and justifications for the limits to medical and social care\nservices provided by state or by commercial providers often assume\nthat the primary responsibility for the care of dependent family\nmembers is most naturally shouldered by women. Not least because of\nthis, the caring aspect of medicine is often dismissed as\n\u201chousekeeping\u201d and compared unfavorably to heroic\nbiomedical interventions or the \u201ccrisis issues\u201d that\ndominate bioethical discussion.\n\nFresh interest in the moral structure of caregiving has been generated\nby two particular developments\u2014one technical, the other social.\nFirst, novel assisted reproductive technologies including egg and\nembryo donation and mitochondrial transfer have led to the emergence\nof new family forms and structures (Cutas & Chan 2012; Hudson\n2020). Relatedly, other authors note that the increasing\ntechnologization of medicine, combined with changes in work patterns\nand expectations, makes it harder to integrate care for family members\nwith the demands of modern workplaces and practices. They critically\nexamine the ambiguous consequences for women, and for the recipients\nof care, of the replacement of traditional care practices by\ntechnology, for example by care robots (Parks 2010; Gary 2021) or\nother forms of artificial intelligence (Vallor 2011).\n\nSecond, demographic changes mean that nations of the Global North are\nexperiencing the aging of their populations with a concomitant\nincreased demand for both medical and social care (Holstein 2013).\nCombined with the economic and political forces shrinking health and\nwelfare public services, these demographic changes in many parts of\nthe world mean that care responsibilities are shifting away from state\nprovision and back onto families, thereby reinforcing traditional\nfamily structures in which women are the main providers of care\n(Noddings 2002). A significant amount of feminist work examines the\norganization of familial versus societal care responsibilities. In\nthis vein feminist bioethicists such as Rosemarie Tong (2009) and\nMonique Lanoix (2013) have written on the discriminatory impact on\nwomen of long-term care work, including the ethics of the national and\ninternational arrangements of care for children, elderly, and\nchronically ill people. Globalization has fostered an explosion in\ninternational migrant care work, in which women move from poorer to\nricher countries to provide care for children and elderly or disabled\nand chronically ill people. Such transnational displacement of care\nprovision mainly affects women from socially marginalized groups and\nhas enduring and complex consequences for them, their families, and\ntheir countries of origin (Weir 2008; Eckenwiler 2011, 2013).\n\nMoving beyond practices that are readily identifiable in conventional\nterms as care, there is also a focus of work within feminist bioethics\non the broader role of the family in decision-making about individuals\nin clinical and public health contexts (Lindemann et al. 2019).\nConflict or ambiguities in care responsibilities become most visible\nin high profile cases about end-of-life care, but there is growing\nawareness of the need for an overall more robust theoretical framework\nto encompass a broader understanding of the moral significance of\nfamilies. Finally, other recent work illustrates the expansion in\nscope and scale of the application of care ethics, including care in\nglobal pandemics (Gary & Berlinger 2020), the concept of caring\ninstitutions (Bourgault 2020), care on a geopolitical scale (Robinson\n2011; Vaittinen et al. 2019), and care as environmental responsibility\n(Laugier 2015).\n",
