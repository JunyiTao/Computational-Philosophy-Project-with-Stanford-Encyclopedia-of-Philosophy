    "main_text": "Plural Quantification vs. Second-Order Quantification || Higher levels of plural quantification?\n2.4 Higher levels of plural quantification?\n\nOne way of going beyond PFO+ would be by allowing quantification into\npredicate positions, including those of predicates taking plural\narguments. Doing so would result in an extension which stands to PFO+\nas ordinary (singular) second-order logic stands to ordinary\n(singular) first-order logic. Such extensions will not be considered\nhere: for whether they are legitimate, and if so what axioms they may\nsupport, has less to do with plurals and plural quantification than it\ndoes with predication and quantification over the semantic values of\n predicates.[11]\n\nWhat \\(is\\) relevant for present purposes is whether there is some\nform of \u201csuper-plural\u201d quantification that stands to\nordinary plural quantification as ordinary plural quantification\nstands to singular quantification. If so, let\u2019s call this\nsecond-level plural quantification. More generally, we may\nattempt to introduce plural quantification of any finite level. This\nwould result in a theory which for technical purposes is just like a\nsimple type theory (Hazen 1997: 247; Linnebo 2003: sect. IV; Rayo\n2006).\n\nIt is fairly straightforward to develop formal languages and theories\nof higher-level plural quantification (Rayo 2006). For instance, we\ncan introduce variables of the form xxx to be thought of as\nranging over second-level pluralities and the relation \\(xx \\prec_2\\)\nxxx to be understood in analogy with the relation \\(x \\prec\nxx\\). (See Linnebo and Rayo 2012 for extensions to transfinite levels\nand comparison of the resulting theories with those of ordinary set\ntheory.) But can these formal theories of higher-level plural\nquantification be justified by considerations similar to those that\njustify the theories PFO and PFO+?\n\nBoolos and many other philosophers deny that higher-level plural\nquantification can be thus justified. Two kinds of arguments are given\nfor this view. Firstly, it is argued that a plurality is always a\nplurality of things. But since plural quantification is\nontologically innocent, there are no such things as pluralities. There\nis thus nothing that can be collected into a second-level plurality\n(McKay 2006: 46\u201353 and 137\u2013139). Secondly, ordinary plural\nquantification is justified by the fact that it captures certain\nquantificational devices of English and other natural languages. But\nEnglish and other natural languages contain no higher-level plural\nquantification (Lewis 1991: 70\u201371).\n\nBoth arguments are controversial. Concerning the first, it is not\nclear why ontology should be relevant to the legitimacy of\nhigher-level plurals quantification. It should be sufficient that the\nbase-level objects can be organized in certain complex ways. For\ninstance, the second-level plurality based on Cheerios organized as\noo oo oo should be no more\nontologically problematic than the first-level plurality based on the\nsame objects organized as oooooo,\nalthough the former has an additional level of structure or\narticulation (Linnebo 2003: 87\u20138).\n\nThe second of the above two arguments is also problematic. To begin\nwith, the claim that there are no higher-level plural locutions in\nnatural language is almost certainly false. In Icelandic, for\ninstance, the number words have plural forms which count, not\nindividual objects, but pluralities of objects that form\nnatural groups. Here is an example:\n\n\n\neinn sk\u00f3r\nmeans\none shoe \n\neinir sk\u00f3r\nmeans\none pair of shoes \n\ntvennir sk\u00f3r\nmeans\ntwo pairs of shoes \n\n\n\nThis allows us to talk about pairs of shoes as a second-level\nplurality rather than as a first-level plurality of objects such as\npairs. (More examples involving foreign languages can be\nfound in Grimau 2021a.) For an English example, consider a video game\nin which any number \\(n\\) of teams can compete in an \\(n\\)-way\ncompetition. Then the following sentence seems to involve a\nsuperplural term:\n\n(12)\n These people, those people, and these other people compete\nagainst each other.  (Linnebo and Nicolas 2008)\n\n\n(See also Oliver and Smiley 2004: 654\u2013656, 2005: 1063, and 2016,\nch. 15; Ben-Yami 2013; Simons 2016; Florio and Linnebo 2021, ch. 9,\nand Grimau 2021a and 2021b)\n\nMoreover, the very idea that the legitimacy of higher-level plural\nquantification is decided by the existence or non-existence of\nhigher-level plural locutions in English and other natural languages\nis problematic (Hazen 1993: 138 and 1997: 247; Linnebo 2003: 87; Rayo\n2006). What really matters is presumably whether we can iterate the\nprinciples and considerations on which our understanding of ordinary\nfirst-level plural quantification is based: if we can, then\nhigher-level plural quantification will be justified in much the same\nway as ordinary first-level plural quantification; and if not, then\nnot. Thus, even if there were no higher-level plural locutions in\nnatural languages, this would provide little or no evidence for the\nstronger \u2014 and philosophically more interesting \u2014 claim\nthat there can be no iteration of the step from the singular to the\nplural in any language spoken by intelligent agents.\nMoreover, any evidence of this sort could be defeated by pointing to\nindependent reasons why higher-level plural locutions are scarce in\nnatural languages. One such independent reason may simply be that\nordinary speakers aren\u2019t very concerned about their ontological\ncommitments and thus find it more convenient to express facts\ninvolving second-level pluralities by positing objects to represent\nthe first-level pluralities (for instance by talking about two\npairs of shoes) rather than by keeping track of additional\ngrammatical device for second-level plurals (as in the above example\nfrom Icelandic).\n\nSuppose we accept higher-level plural quantification. How should this\nbe implemented? One option is to introduce a separate set of variables\nfor each level of such quantification, say \u201c\\(xxx\\)\u201d, etc.\nfor second-level plurals (Rayo 2006). Another option is to use a\nsingle set of \u201call-purpose\u201d variables whose values can be\npluralities of any level (Oliver and Smiley 2016, ch. 15; Simons 2016;\nand Florio and Linnebo 2021, sect. 11.7). \n",
