    "main_text": "Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy || Thought\n3.4 Thought\n\nPhilosophical engagement on the nature of belief, concepts,\nperception, mental representation, non-conceptual content,\nrationality, and reasoning deals both with the question of whether\nanimals have capacities related to thought, and with questions about\nthe nature of these capacities. Though there are a lot of contemporary\ndiscussions on these topics, this corresponds to a rather recent turn\nof events, since philosophy of mind has, for the most part,\nhistorically dealt only with human forms of thought. This was not out\nof lack of interest, but the result of the conviction that only humans\nwere capable of thinking. Descartes, for instance, famously argued\nthat animals\u2019 lack of language gives us a good reason to think\nthat they do not have any form of thought or rationality.\n\nDescartes\u2019 view was echoed in the twentieth century by\nphilosopher Donald Davidson. In a well-known article (Davidson 1982),\nhe argued that animals are incapable of thinking due to their lack of\nlanguage. He departs from an example by Norman Malcolm (1972/73): a\ndog is chasing the neighbor\u2019s cat through the backyard. The cat\nruns directly towards an oak tree but at the last minute they swerve\nand go up a maple. The dog misses this last maneuver and runs towards\nthe oak tree, rests their paws on it, and begins to bark at its\nbranches. Though we would be inclined to describe this behavior by\nsaying that the dog believes that the cat is in the oak tree,\nDavidson thinks that we would be wrong.\n\nDavidson first identifies an epistemological problem with attributing\nsuch a belief to the dog; a problem that was already described by\nStephen Stich (1979). The problem boils down to the fact that we lack\na way of determining which description would accurately capture the\ndog\u2019s belief: do they believe the cat went up the oldest tree in\nthe backyard? Or the tree that smells the best? Or the tree that the\ncat went up the last time? This epistemological hurdle is\ninsurmountable, in Davidson\u2019s view. Moreover, for him, beliefs\nare never had in isolation, but rather every belief is embedded in a\nnetwork of associated beliefs without which that initial belief would\nlack all sense. In order to believe of an object that it is a tree,\nthe dog needs all sorts of general beliefs about trees: that they\ngrow; that they have leaves, branches, and roots; that they need water\nand sunlight, etc. And the same goes for the cat: believing that this\nis a cat implies believing that they are a mammal, that they have four\nlegs, that they meow, etc. Even though there is no fixed set of\nbeliefs that one needs in order to be able to believe of this object\nthat it is a tree or a cat, without the attribution of at least some\nof these beliefs, the attribution to the dog of the belief that the\ncat is in the tree becomes senseless.\n\nThough it has been widely discussed, few philosophers have been\nconvinced by this argument. For one, similar problems also arise when\nattributing beliefs to other humans. Furthermore, such arguments are\nexcessively pessimistic with regards to the limits of what we can know\nabout animals\u2019 beliefs. By studying animal behavior in\ncontrolled situations, we can come to know quite a lot about how they\nunderstand the world, which would allow us to delineate their beliefs\nto a much higher degree than Davidson and Stich acknowledge. Moreover,\nperhaps animals\u2019 beliefs don\u2019t take the form of\npropositional attitudes made up of concepts, like Davidson assumes. It\ncould be the case, for instance, that the dog thinks of the cat, not\nas a four-legged meowing mammal, but in terms of the actions they\nallow: as, for instance, a chase-able or eat-able thing. And lastly,\nwhile Davidson\u2019s argument may allow us to conclude that we\ndon\u2019t know the exact form that animals\u2019 beliefs take, a\nnumber of philosophers have argued that we can still ascribe content\nto animal beliefs using a variety of different methods (e.g., Allen\n2013; Berm\u00fadez 2003; Rowlands 2012).\n\nHowever, for Davidson, attributing thought to animals is not merely an\nepistemological problem. It isn\u2019t just that we don\u2019t have\na way of knowing what animals believe; for him, the very idea\nthat animals can think is problematic. Davidson ties the ability to\nthink to the possession of language. He considers that an individual\nwho has beliefs has to be capable of being surprised, for surprise\nconsists precisely of registering that reality isn\u2019t how we\nbelieved it was. Surprise shows that one can discriminate\nbetween the purely subjective and the objective. In order to have the\ncapacity to be surprised, and therefore to have beliefs, one needs the\nconcept of belief, to be able to understand that there is an\nobjective reality that is independent from our beliefs. At the same\ntime, language is necessary to have the concept of belief, for it\nallows us to contrast what we believe with what others believe, and\nthus generate the notion of truth and an objective reality. Given that\nonly humans have language, only humans can have the concept of belief,\nand therefore beliefs. And as, for Davidson, beliefs are the basic\nfoundation for all kinds of thought, only humans can think.\n\nMore recent philosophical engagement on these topics tends to take a\nmore varied and often nuanced view about the relationship between\nlanguage and thought that distinguishes between different kinds of\nthinking. Elisabeth Camp finds evidence that while some animals think\nin compositional representational systems, such systems lack other\nproperties of language and are not propositional in structure (Camp\n2009a). This is in contrast to Jerry Fodor\u2019s Language of Thought\n(LoT) hypothesis, according to which all thought has a language-like\nstructure and can be had by animals who do not use language (Fodor\n1975). On Camp\u2019s view, animals lack propositional thought, but\nsome animals still have conceptual thought because they have\nsystematically recombinable stimulus-independent representational\ncapacities\u2014a flexible capacity to represent different aspects of\nthe world, including abstractions (Camp 2009b). Other philosophers\nargue that the evidence suggests both that animals lack concepts and\nthat they think, providing evidence for nonconceptual mental content\n(e.g., Beck 2012; Peacocke 2001; Schellenberg 2013, 2018).\nContemporary philosophers are also interested in investigating the\nkinds of rational thought processes that animals might engage in,\nincluding logical reasoning (Burge 2010), causal reasoning\n(Berm\u00fadez 2006), or statistical reasoning (Rescorla, 2009,\n2017).\n",
