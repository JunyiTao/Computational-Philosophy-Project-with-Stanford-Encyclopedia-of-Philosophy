When political life is really\nwell-ordered, therefore, each member (citizen) of a state will be also\na member of this other \u201ccomplete community\u201d and subject to\nits laws as well as to the state\u2019s. The function of this other\ncommunity is to transmit the divine promise or offer of eternal life,\nand to help people help each other, through their own individual free\nchoices, to become ready for that life. With the establishing of this\ncommunity (in continuity and discontinuity with the older religious\ncommunity of Israel), human associations are henceforth of two\nfundamentally distinct types: (i) temporal or secular, worldly, civil,\nor political, and (ii) spiritual. Correspondingly, responsibility for\nhuman affairs is divided between (i) secular societies, especially\nstates and families, and (ii) the Church. The distinction between\nsecular and spiritual tracks that between natural and revealed\nknowledge.\n6.4.1 Non-dependence and non-subjection of secular authority\n\nAccordingly, the Church\u2019s leaders have no jurisdiction over\nsecular matters, although they can declare that the choice of a member\nof the Church, albeit in a secular matter, is seriously immoral. A\nparent has no jurisdiction over a child\u2019s free choices except in\nso far as they violate the moral rights of other members of the family\nor the parents\u2019 responsibility for the child\u2019s education\nand moral upbringing. State government and law have no right to direct\nthe Church\u2019s leaders, or its members in their religious affairs,\nexcept in so far as the state\u2019s peace and justice would\notherwise be violated. \u201cIn those matters which pertain to\npolitical good [bonum civile], secular rather than spiritual\nauthority should be obeyed.\u201d Sent. II d. 44 ex. ad\n4.\n\nNeither those who adhere to the old, incomplete revelation (Jews), nor\nthose people and peoples who simply do not accept the truth of the\nfull revelation, are subject to the authority of the Church. Nor is\nthe legitimacy and authority of a government negated by the fact that\nits members (officials) are unbelievers.\n\nBeyond this, Aquinas works within the constitutional assumptions of\nthe Christendom of his era. His positions imply that if ecclesiastical\nauthorities expel members from the Church for their misdeeds as\nrulers, the consequences under their particular state\u2019s own\nconstitutional arrangement could include the rulers\u2019\ndeposition (loss of secular legal authority); but Aquinas blurs or\nelides this distinction of jurisdictions, and loosely says that the\nChurch \u201chas the authority of curbing secular rulers\u201d\n(ST II-II q. 12 a. 2 ad 1).\n6.4.2 Heresy, unbelief and religious freedom\n\nAquinas accepts the teaching of the Church of his era that no one can\nrightly be compelled to accept the Christian faith or membership of\nthe Church, but that those who are members can and should be compelled\nby both ecclesiastical and state law to abstain from any public denial\nor renunciation of it. He treats such renunciation as an actionable\nbreach of promise (passing silently over the fact that in most cases\nthe promise was made not by the persons concerned but rather, in their\nearly infancy, by their parents). And he regards public teaching of\nheresy as comparable to counterfeiting coin of the realm and therefore\nrightly punishable capitally by the secular authorities (the fact of\nfalse teaching having been ascertained by an ecclesiastical trial).\nHis views about this matter are explicitly based on the evolving\ntradition of the Church and on what historical experience suggested\nwere the effects of more permissive political or legal arrangements.\nSo there are no theoretical obstacles to his ready acceptance of the\njudgment of later theologians and Church teachers that, as experience\nshows, it is more compatible with basic positions in his moral and\npolitical philosophy to hold that authentically personal judgment and\nfreely chosen commitment are so important in relation to ultimate\nquestions that all persons (even those whose beliefs about religion\nare false or ill-formed) have a moral right, and should have the\ncorresponding legal right, to be free from state (and ecclesiastical)\ncoercion in religious belief or action except in so far as their\nconduct would be contrary to the rights of others or to public peace\nor to public morality (that is, morality so far as it is publicly\ncommunicated or concerns actions which impact on the public) (Second\nVatican Council, Declaration on Religious Liberty (1965)).\nNor is it clear how he could resist the objection that, even if those\nbaptized in infancy ratify the promises made on their behalf at\nbaptism, the subscription of faith is not an undertaking to other\npeople or the community, but rather is a matter which, as he says in a\nneglected passage elsewhere in his major writings (ScG III c.\n80 n. 15), \u201cpertains to that person alone as an individual\n[secundum se ipsum].\u201d\n",
