As in most places, historical\ninvestigation tended to concentrate in the modern period, mostly on\nCartesian and Humean skepticism, though many other authors, such as\nMontaigne, Bacon, Bayle, and Kant, were also on the spot. Although\nBrazilian scholarship has perhaps made more contributions, one should\nnot neglect the huge and widespread interest in modern skepticism\nthroughout Latin America.\n\nThe most important work on the history of skepticism is arguably that\nof Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), who worked with Popkin.\nMaia Neto got interested in skepticism through his contact with Danilo\nMarcondes and, some time later, with Porchat\u2019s works. His main\ncontribution is that Academic skepticism played a more important role\nin modern skepticism than Popkin\u2019s interpretation recognizes\n(Maia Neto 1997a, 2005, 2013a). According to Maia Neto, Popkin\nemphasized the importance of Pyrrhonism for modern philosophy, but\nneglected the fact that Academic skepticism was also widely known and\nused by many philosophers. In order to defend this interpretation,\nMaia Neto wrote a number of papers on philosophers like Montaigne\n(Maia Neto 2004, 2012), Pierre Charron (Maia Neto 2014), Descartes\n(Maia Neto 2001), Gassendi (Maia Neto 1997b) and Pierre-Daniel Huet\n(Maia Neto 2008a,b). In fact, he explored the whole modern skepticism\nfrom Montaigne onwards, with important texts on Pascal (Maia Neto\n1995), Bayle (Maia Neto 1996), and Hume (Maia Neto 1991).\n\nAnother important contribution is that of Luiz Antonio Alves Eva\n(Brazil), who has studied in great detail Montaigne\u2019s\nEssays, publishing two books (2004, 2007b) and a number of\npapers in Brazil and elsewhere (2001a, 2012, 2013a). Still in Brazil,\nRenato Lessa (Brazil) (1995, 2003) has done some work on\nMontaigne\u2019s political skepticism, showing that skeptics, by\nacknowledging the role of habit, would be realists in politics. Smith\n(2012a), criticizing Eva\u2019s interpretation, who insists on the\naffinities between Montaigne and ancient skeptics, tries to uncover\nmore differences. In Argentina, there has also been some work on\nMontaigne\u2019s skepticism. In addition to Fernando Bahr\n(Argentina), to whom we shall return, Soledad Croce (Argentina) (2006,\n2007), for instance, has published many papers on what she takes as\nthe practical skepticism of Montaigne.\n\nLuiz Eva (Brazil) (2006, 2008, 2011) also focused on the relations\nbetween Francis Bacon and skepticism. He proposed some careful\ninterpretations of the Theory of the Idols and skeptical arguments\nstemming from ancient Pyrrhonism and from Montaigne and Sanchez. He\nshowed not only the skeptical origins of most Baconian idols, but also\nhow their structure changed the skeptical Modes, thereby revealing\nwhat is properly new in Bacon. Silvia Manzo (Argentina) (2009) wrote\non the same subject, holding a balanced view, in which there is a\ndouble attitude in light of the skeptical threat. More recently, she\nreturned to that topic (Manzo forthcoming), providing a reconstruction\nof Francis Bacon\u2019s reception of Academic skepticism. She deals\nwith the assessment of ancient skepticism throughout Bacon\u2019s\nwritings and argues that he, on the one hand, approved of the state of\ndoubt and the suspension of judgment and, on the other hand, rejected\nthe notion of acatalepsia. Pl\u00ednio Junqueira Smith (Brazil)\n(2012b), referring to both scholars, showed that Bacon\u2019s main\nfocus is on the propositions \u201cnothing is known\u201d and\n\u201cnothing can be known\u201d, to which he devoted careful\nattention. According to him, Bacon used skeptical weapons to reject\nthe whole traditional philosophy (including skepticism), not only to\ncriticize dogmatism, thereby distancing himself from it.\n\nDanilo Marcondes (Brazil) (2009, 2012) has been doing original,\nimportant research on the ancient Modes and the discovery of the New\nWorld. This discovery offered not only many more examples of the same\nkind of diversity Europeans were familiar with, but also of a\ndifferent, more radical kind, strengthening the force of the skeptical\nModes. That is a vast and rich literature not yet explored by scholars\non the history of skepticism.\n\nAs expected, Cartesian skepticism is one of the main objects of study.\nIn almost every country we find scholars trying to understand its\nsources, the nature of its arguments, their force and persuasiveness.\nOne decisive contribution, already noted above, is that of Porchat,\nwho credited Descartes\u2019s methodological use of skepticism a\nspecial place in the philosophy. In Porchat\u2019s view of the 1980s\n(Porchat 1985, 1986), there was a strong affinity between ancient\nskepticism and Cartesian doubt, so that one could speak properly of a\nskeptic-Cartesian model. The problem of the external world became,\nthereby, a crucial issue for those concerned with skepticism, because\nit was thought of as a skeptical problem. Following his lead, many\nother philosophers in Brazil, like Paulo Francisco Estrella Faria\n(2007), Luiz Eva (2001b, 2013b), Alexandre Noronha Machado (2007a),\nFl\u00e1vio Williges (2007), among others, wrote papers on the\ntopic.\n\nIn Mexico, concern with Cartesian skepticism was once the dominant\nfocus of research on skepticism. One reason for this predominance is\nthe connection between the group of Laura Ben\u00edtez (Mexico) and\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Robles (Mexico) with Ezequiel de Olaso and Richard\nPopkin. This group was strongly oriented toward the work of Descartes\nand modern science. Consequently, Cartesian skepticism or\nmethodological skepticism was an important subject to them. Many\nmembers of the group shared, perhaps implicitly, the belief that the\nCartesian anti-skeptical strategy was successful to avoid disastrous\nskeptical consequences. Ben\u00edtez (1987), for instance, has\ndevoted many of her works to Cartesian studies, and explored the\npositive methodological aspects of Cartesian skepticism to reach plain\ncertainty, as well as the relevance of skepticism for discussions\nconcerning the nature of human knowledge.\n\nSomething similar can be said about the situation in Colombia, where\nJean Paul Margot (2003) and Adolfo Le\u00f3n G\u00f3mez (2002)\ngave a lot of attention to Cartesian skepticism. Also very important\nare the contributions of Mauricio Zuluaga, who has examined\ncontemporary interpretations of Cartesian skepticism, especially those\nbased on the closure principle (Zuluaga 2012), the Agrippan Trilemma\n(Zuluaga 2005) and the relations between Pyrrhonism and Cartesian\nskepticism (Zuluaga 2014). Zuluaga published an important book that\nemerged from his Ph.D. dissertation (Zuluaga 2007) and, with Margot,\nedited a collection (Margot and Zuluaga 2012), in which one finds many\npapers on modern skepticism, including on Montaigne, featuring\nscholars from Colombia and elsewhere.\n\nIn Peru we also find some interest in the relation between Descartes\nand skepticism. Jorge Secada (2000) has done work on Descartes and\nSuarez, but focused on Descartes with regard to skepticism. Humberto\nQuispe (1996) has also done research on this topic, mainly under the\ninfluence of Jorge Secada.\n\nFrench skepticism of the 17th century was given some\nattention, although not as much as one would like. Besides the already\nnoted contribution by Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), the\nworks of Fl\u00e1vio Fontenelle Loque (Brazil) (2012) and Fernando\nBahr (Argentina) deserve to be highlighted. Loque\u2019s book is on\nthe relation between skepticism and religion, more specifically on the\nvery notion of a Christian skepticism. He devoted attention not only\nto Montaigne and Pierre Charron, but also to Fran\u00e7ois de la\nMothe Le Vayer. Bahr (1999, 2000a,b, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2010) focused\nmainly on Pierre Bayle, whose skeptical arguments touch on three main\npoints: the problem of evil, the foundations of religious belief and\ncivil tolerance. These topics led Bahr to study both the\n18th century, where he examines the influence of Bayle on\nHume (that was the topic of his Ph.D.), and to the first half of the\n17th century, where he focused his attention on the\nrelation between La Mothe Le Vayer and Descartes. Plinio Junqueira\nSmith (2013) shows the importance of the skeptical method both in\nBayle's historical work and in his philosophical thinking.\nS\u00e9bastien Charles (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) (forthcoming a,b) has\nalso been working recently on some French skeptics, namely Simon\nFoucher and Pierre-Daniel Huet. His historical research follows the\ncurrent trend of erudition, discovering and exploring less known\nfigures, but who were very important at their time.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s reaction to skepticism or his alleged skepticism did\nnot go unnoticed, despite not having received enough attention. One\nexception is Jos\u00e9 Antonio Robles (Mexico). Robles (1996) shows\nthat the Berkeleyan skeptical thesis that rejects the existence of a\nmaterial substance has important consequences, such as the rejection\nof many other subsidiary problems: matter\u2019s indivisibility and\nthe idea of an extended God. Jaimir Conte (Brazil) (2008) also\nexplored the connections between Berkeley and skepticism in an\nimportant paper. S\u00e9bastien Charles (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada)\n(2003) wrote a book on the early reception of Berkeley\u2019s\nimmaterialism in France. At that time, Berkeley was considered the\ngreatest skeptic, until Kant pronounced Hume to be even greater.\nCharles shows, with plenty of erudition, how this image of Berkeley\nwas created in France.\n\nNot much attention was given to skepticism in the 18th\ncentury French materialist philosophy. However, Paulo Jonas de Lima\nPiva (Brazil) (2007, 2008a,b) has done some work focusing especially\non Diderot. S\u00e9bastien Charles (Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) (2007)\ncalled attention to some clandestine skeptical manuscripts as well as\nto many less known skeptics of the period, not only in France, but\nalso in Germany. Charles (2012) and Rodrigo Brand\u00e3o (2008)\nexplored the relations between Voltaire and skepticism.\n\nAn important contribution to understand Hume\u2019s skepticism was\nprovided by Pl\u00ednio Junqueira Smith, who published a book\n(1995a) on that topic and many papers (2011a,b). His main idea is that\nthe debate between Hume\u2019s skepticism and Hume\u2019s naturalism\npresupposes a false dichotomy. What commentators call Hume\u2019s\nnaturalism is what Hume himself called his skepticism. Moreover,\ncommentators tend to think of skepticism as a mere negative doctrine,\nnot paying enough attention to its positive side. He also devoted much\neffort to show how Hume\u2019s mitigated skepticism was connected to\nancient skepticism, in both its forms, and to modern skepticism. One\nshould also note the works of Livia Guimar\u00e3es (Brazil) (1996,\n2008) who has devoted her career to the study of Hume\u2019s thought,\nnot only his skepticism, but also many other aspects of the philosophy\nof the greatest modern skeptic. Humean scholarship has increased so\nmuch in Brazil that it is not possible to give a fair survey of its\nstatus in a limited space.\n\nInterest in Hume\u2019s skepticism is not confined to Brazil.\nLisandro Aguirre (Argentina) (2007, 2008, 2010a,b), for instance, has\npublished many papers on Hume. His main point is that Hume follows\nPyrrhonism precisely when he thinks he is avoiding it, i.e., when Hume\nis saved by nature, he thinks he is not a Pyrrhonian, but in fact that\nwould be the hallmark of a Pyrrhonist. Humean skeptical arguments are\nalso studied in Colombia, for instance by Catalina Gonzalez (2010,\n2011). Humean skepticism was perhaps what generated Peruvian interest\nin modern skepticism. Although Juan Bautista Ferro Porcile (Peru) was\nmainly concerned with logic, he lectured extensively on modern\nphilosophy, especially in the empiricist tradition and in the Humean\nbranch of skepticism, on which he published an influential paper.\n\nThe relations between Kant and skepticism attracted much attention in\nLatin America, most of all in Mexico. We have already seen that a\ngroup of philosophers, most notably Pedro Stepanenko (2002a, 2006,\n2007), Efra\u00edn Lazos (2014), Isabel Cabrera (1999), and Jorge\nOrnelas (2005), combined historical scholarship with systematic\nworries, producing a number of publications on transcendental\narguments and skepticism, discussing the works of Wittgenstein, P.F.\nStrawson and Barry Stroud, among others, from a Kantian point of view.\nStepanenko, in particular, was more historically orientated. Roberto\nHor\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 Pereira (2003) and Marco Franciotti (1994,\n1995), in Brazil, follows a similar path. In Colombia, Alejandro Rosas\n(Colombia) (1990) opened up this field of research with an influential\npaper. Following this path, Catalina Gonz\u00e1lez (Colombia) (2010)\ndeveloped a historical study of the relations between Kant and his\nancient skeptical sources.\n\nMore recently, still in Mexico, Ornelas (2014a, 2015) developed an\ninterpretation of Kantian anti-skepticism, according to which the\n\u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d is not relevant, as is commonly\nassumed, but the \u201cFourth Paralogism\u201d is. Pl\u00ednio\nJunqueira Smith (2008a) holds a similar view, while at the\nsame time offering a wider interpretation. According to Smith, Kant\nresponded to three different kinds of modern skepticism: Cartesian\nskepticism concerning the external world (which Kant came to\nrecognize, in the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason, as an idealist problem, not a skeptical one); Baylean\nskepticism and the antinomies, and Humean skepticism on the objective\nvalidity of the categories.\n\nLuis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (2001) has already published his\nimportant book El escepticismo y la filosof\u00eda\ntrascendental in which he assesses the argumentative potential of\nthe transcendental argument against Humean skepticism as received in\nthe philosophical German scene of the 18th century. Hoyos\nworks motivated a number of Colombian philosophers to devote their\nattention to the subject and the period. Ignacio \u00c1vila\n(Colombia) (1996) explored this same vein, while Carlos Patarroyo\n(Colombia) sides with the Kantian position against Humean skepticism.\nCatalina Gonz\u00e1lez (Colombia) (2011) worked out the distinction\nbetween Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism in Kant.\n\nAs many scholars have perceived the fundamental importance of Kant to\nmodern skepticism (and vice versa), it should not come as a\nsurprise that many others also perceived what is now called\npost-Kantian skepticism. Perhaps the first important study on the\ntopic is that of Luis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (1995), when he\npublishes his Ph.D. dissertation, followed by two papers (Hoyos 1998,\n1999), to which Ra\u00fal Mel\u00e9ndez (Colombia) (2000) replied.\nInterest in post-Kantian skepticism is spreading around. Eduardo\nBrand\u00e3o (Brazil) (2013) devotes his attention to skepticism in\nphilosophers such as G.E. Schulze, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Fichte.\nRicardo Cattaneo (Argentina) (2009, 2010) focuses both on discussions\non skepticism in Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy (Jacobi, Schulze)\nand on the interpretation and assimilation of skepticism in Hegel and\nGerman Idealism. Luiz Fernando Barr\u00e8re Martin (Brazil)\n(2007a,b, 2011) has written his Ph.D. dissertation and published some\npapers on Hegel and skepticism.\n\nSergio S\u00e1nchez (Argentina) is an important reference for\nstudies concerning skepticism in the 19th and\n20th century. S\u00e1nchez (2010) focused on the presence\nof skepticism in Nietzsche, especially the influence of Sextus and\nCicero. In his papers, one important topic is that of\nNietzsche\u2019s analysis of belief and its relation to skepticism.\nIn connection with Nietzsche, Kathia Hanza (Peru) (2011) has explored\ndifferent sides of skepticism. The works of Rog\u00e9rio Lopes\n(Brazil) (2006, 2012) on Nietzsche and skepticism, very similar in\nspirit to those of S\u00e1nchez and Hanza, also deserve to be\nmentioned.\n",
