    "main_text": "Decision Theory: Is It Rational to Choose Transformative Experiences? || \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d Uncertainty\n4.1 \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d Uncertainty\n\nStandard decision models take probabilities and values as inputs and\nproduce expected values as outputs. For instance, suppose ESPN\u2019s\noutcome predictor projects the Kansas City Chiefs as having a 50%\nchance to win the Super Bowl, yet the moneyline, which is based on\nbetting activity, is +105 (meaning that if you bet $100 on them and\nthey win, you receive $105 in winning plus your initial $100 wager).\nBy weighting the possible outcomes with their corresponding\nprobabilities, we can calculate the expected value of betting $100 on\nthe Chiefs: \n\\[ .5(105) + .5 (-100) = 2.5 \\]\n\n\nIf one uses a decision procedure where one maximizes expected value,\nit\u2019s rational to bet on the Chiefs since betting $100 has an\nexpected value of $2.50 while not betting has an expected value of 0\nsince there are no gains or losses. There are other decision\nprocedures one might use as well. For instance, one might prefer a\nmaximin procedure, in which one chooses the option with the\nbest worst outcome. Since the worst outcome of betting on the Chiefs\nis losing money and the worst outcome of not betting is neither\ngaining nor losing money, not betting is the best worst outcome. Thus,\na maximin procedure would recommend not betting. Crucially for our\npurposes, it doesn\u2019t matter which decision procedure\none utilizes. Rather, what matters is that values and probabilities\n(or at least possibilities) are required for any decision procedure to\noperate.\n\nOn the first challenge for decision theory, transformative experiences\nare epistemically transformative, and agents do not know what the\nexperience will be like. What an experience is like determines the\nvalue associated with the experience. At the most basic level, part of\nwhat an experience is like involves the pain or pleasure of the\nexperience. Pain detracts from the value of the experience while\npleasure enhances it. More complex components of what the experience\nis like also affect the value of the experience. While some other\nfactors\u2014such as moral or social ones\u2014may affect the value\nof the experience, what the experience itself is like clearly plays a\nlarge role in determining value. Without knowing what the experience\nis like, agents can\u2019t reliably project its value. If the value\nof the experience is not known, then the value of any outcome\ninvolving transformative experiences also remains unknown. Thus, an\nagent choosing between options that may involve transformative\nexperience cannot use standard decision procedures since those\nprocedures require values as inputs.\n\nThis purported challenge is highly contested. Recall from\n \u00a72\n that many philosopher reject the claim that experiences like\nparenthood are epistemically transformative (e.g., Harman,\nKrishnamurthy, etc.). Denying that the experiences are epistemically\ntransformative means that agents can know something about\nwhat the experiences are like prior to having them. For instance, the\ntestimony of parents or the non-phenomenal elements of the experience\nmight provide some sense of what becoming a parent is like. If\nthat\u2019s right, then perhaps at least rough values can be used in\na decision procedure.\n\nAlternatively, one might grant that we can\u2019t know anything about\nwhat transformative experiences are like. Nevertheless, one might\nstill be able to use standard decision procedures since we may know\nabout the values associated with the experience even if we don\u2019t\nknow what the experience is like. For instance, Dougherty, Horowitz,\nand Sliwa (2015) invite us to consider a mystery box. Everyone who\nlooks into the mystery box has a positive experience, though they\ncannot describe what the experience is like. On the basis of this\ninformation\u2014that the value associated with the box is always\npositive\u2014one can rationally choose to look in the box without\nknowing what that will be like.\n\nSimilarly, knowing the valence of outcomes can often provide rational\ngrounds on which to make a decision even if what the outcome is like\nis unknown. Pascal\u2019s Wager offers one such scenario: the\ninfinite positive value of eternal happiness swamps any finite value.\nThus, one is rationally justified\u2014or perhaps even\nrequired!\u2014to try to believe in God. McKinnon (2015) offers the\nopposite sort of case by inviting us to consider an individual\nconsidering transitioning. Prior to transitioning, many trans people\nsuffer from severe depression and are at risk of suicide. Even if they\ndo not know exactly what it will be like to transition, the\nalternative is sufficiently horrible, and thus the decision to\ntransition can be rational.\n\nPaul (2015b) suggests that all these responses miss the mark. First,\npeople who choose transformative experience purely on the basis of\nvalues without knowing what the experience will be like are not\nchoosing on the basis of what the experience is like. Of course, it\ncan often be appropriate to make choices without considering what the\noutcomes will be like\u2014cases involving moral stakes are one such\nscenario. However, in many paradigm cases such as parenthood, agents\noften do envision what their future lives will be like and base their\ndecisions, at least partially, on that vision. Second, Paul emphasizes\nthe importance of the values being subjective, or assigned by\nthe agent. Because decisions involving transformative experience are\npersonally significant, agents need to make the choice\nauthentically. On Paul\u2019s account, authenticity requires\nthat the agents themselves ascribe value to the experience. (More on\nauthenticity in\n \u00a75.)\n Thus, testimony from others about the values they\u2019ve ascribed\nto an experience won\u2019t help an agent choose authentically for\nthemselves.\n",
