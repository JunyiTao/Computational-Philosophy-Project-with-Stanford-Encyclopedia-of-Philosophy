Dingle doesn\u2019t\nobject solely to his opponents\u2019 lack of inductive logic. Of\nequal importance is the fact that they find the source of their\nhypotheses in fairly general principles, wide-ranging rational\nproposals about the structure of the universe at large. These\nprinciples Dingle takes to be a priori, in the most\npejorative sense of that term. They are phantasms,\n\u201cchimeras\u201d he calls them, which seduce the imaginations of\nhis opponents, and lead them and their dumb-struck admirers away from\nthe genuine, authentic method of science. This is\nwhat really sticks in Dingle\u2019s craw. In turn, Eddington, Milne\nand Dirac are chastised, each for something slightly different, but at\nbottom the same, namely, they one and all \u201cappear as a victim of\nthe great \u2018Universe\u2019 mania\u201d (Dingle 1937, p. 786).\nIn the end, Dingle believes, the danger of this new\n\u2018methodology\u2019 is real, and serious. As he notes in\nconclusion:\n\nNor are we dealing with a mere skin disease which time itself will\nheal. Such ailments are familiar enough; every age has its delusions\nand every cause its traitors. But the danger here is radical. Our\nleaders themselves are bemused, so that treachery can pass unnoticed\nand even think itself fidelity. It is the noblest minds that are\no\u2019erthrown\u2026the very council of the elect can violate its\ncharter and think it is doing science service. (Dingle 1937, p. 786)\n\n\nHere Dingle obviously goes over the top. Yet overblown as it is, there\nis no doubting his sincerity: Milne and the other cosmologists have\nbetrayed the true science bequeathed them by their ancestors in the\nRoyal Society.\n\nHow could Dingle be answered?\n",
