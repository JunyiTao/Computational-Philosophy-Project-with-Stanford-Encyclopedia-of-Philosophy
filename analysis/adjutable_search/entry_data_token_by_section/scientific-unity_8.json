The concepts of\nemergence, supervenience and downward causation are related\nmetaphysical tools for generating and evaluating proposals about unity\nand reduction in the sciences. This literature has enjoyed its chief\nsources and developments in general metaphysics and in philosophy of\nmind and psychology (Davidson 1969; Putnam 1975; Fodor 1975; Kim\n1993).\n\nSupervenience, first introduced by Davidson in discussions of\nmental properties, is the notion that a system with properties on one\nlevel is composed of entities on a lower level and that its properties\nare determined by the properties of the lower-level entities or\nstates. The relation of determination is that no changes at the\nhigher-level occur without changes at the lower level. Like\ntoken-reductionism, supervenience has been adopted by many as the poor\nman\u2019s reductionism (see the entry on\n supervenience).\n A different case for the autonomy of the macrolevel is based on the\nnotion of multiple supervenience (Kincaid 1997; Meyering 2000).\n\nThe autonomy of the special sciences from physics has been defended in\nterms of a distinction between type-physicalism and\ntoken-physicalism (Fodor 1974; Fodor countered Oppenheim and\nPutnam\u2019s hypothesis under the rubric \u201cthe disunity of\nscience\u201d; see the entry on\n physicalism).\n The key logical assumption is the type-token distinction, whereby\ntypes are realized by more specific tokens, e.g., the type\n\u201canimal\u201d is instantiated by different species, the type\n\u201ctiger\u201d or \u201celectron\u201d can be instantiated by\nmultiple individual token tigers and electrons. Type-physicalism is\ncharacterized by a type-type identity between the\npredicates/properties in the laws of the special sciences and those of\nphysics. By contrast, token-physicalism is based on the token-token\nidentity between the predicates/properties of the special sciences and\nthose of physics; every event under a special law falls under a law of\nphysics and bridge laws express contingent token-identities between\nevents. Token-physicalism operates as a demarcation criterion for\nmaterialism. Fodor argued that the predicates of the special sciences\ncorrespond to infinite or open-ended disjunctions of physical\npredicates, and these disjunctions do not constitute natural kinds\nidentified by an associated law. Token-physicalism is the only\nalternative. All special kinds of events are physical, but the special\nsciences are not physics (for criticisms based on the presuppositions\nin Fodor\u2019s argument, see Sober 1999).\n\nThe denial of remedial, weaker forms of reductionism is the basis for\nthe concept of emergence (Humphreys 1997; Bedau and Humphreys\n2008; Wilson 2021). Different accounts have attempted to articulate\nthe idea of a whole being different from or more than the mere sum of\nits parts (see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n Emergence has been described beyond logical relations, synchronically\nas an ontological property and diachronically as a material process of\nfusion, in which the powers of the separate constituents lose their\nseparate existence and effects (Humphreys 1997). This concept has been\nwidely applied in discussions of complexity. Unlike the\nearliest antireductionist models of complexity in terms of holism and\ncybernetic properties, more recent approaches track the role of\nconstituent parts (Simon 1996). Weak emergence has been opposed to\nnominal and strong forms of emergence. The nominal kind simply\nrepresents that some macro-properties cannot be properties of\nmicro-constituents. The strong form is based on supervenience and\nirreducibility, with a role for the occurrence of autonomous downwards\ncausation upon any constituents (see below). Weak emergence is linked\nto processes stemming from the states and powers of constituents, with\na reductive notion of downwards causation of the system as a resultant\nof constituents\u2019 effects (Wilson 2021); however, the connection\nis not a matter of Nagelian formal derivation, but of so-called\nuniversality classes (Batterman 2002; Thalos 2013), self-organization\n(Mitchell 2012) and implementation through computational aggregation,\ncompression and iteration. Weak emergence, then, can be defined in\nterms of simulation: a macro-property, state or fact is weakly\nemergent if and only if it can be derived from its macro-constituents\nonly by simulation (Bedau and Humphreys 2008) The denial of remedial,\nweaker forms of reductionism is the basis for the concept of\nemergence (Humphreys 1997; Bedau 2008); see the entry on\n simulations in science).\n\nComputational models of emergence or complexity straddle the boundary\nbetween formal epistemology and ontology. They are based on\nsimulations of chaotic dynamical processes such as cellular automata\n(Wolfram 1984, 2002). Their supposed superiority to combinatorial\nmodels based on aggregative functions of parts of wholes does not lack\ndefenders (Crutchfield 1994; Crutchfield and Hanson 1997; Humphreys\n2004, 2007, 2008; Humphreys and Huneman 2008; Huneman 2008a, 2008b,\n2010).\n\nConnected to the concept of emergence is top-down or\ndownward causation, which captures the autonomous and genuine\ncausal power of higher-level entities or states, especially upon\nlower-level ones. The most extreme and most controversial version\nincludes a violation of laws that regulate the lower level (Meehl and\nSellars 1956; Campbell 1974). Weaker forms require compatibility with\nthe microlaws (for a brief survey and discussion see Robinson 2005; on\ndownward causation without top-down causes, see Craver and Bechtel\n2007; Bishop 2012). The very concept has become the subject of some\ninterdisciplinary interest in the sciences (Ellis, Noble and\nO\u2019Connor 2012).\n\nAnother general argument for the autonomy of the macrolevel in the\nform of non-reductive materialism has been a cognitive type of\nfunctionalism, namely, cognitive pragmatism (Van Gulick 1992). This\naccount links ontology to epistemology. It discusses four pragmatic\ndimensions of representations: the nature of the causal interaction\nbetween theory-user and the theory, the nature of the goals to the\nrealization of which the theory can contribute, the role of indexical\nelements in fixing representational content, and differences in the\nindividuating principles applied by the theory to its types (Wimsatt\nand Spector\u2019s arguments above are of this kind). A more\nontologically substantive account of functional reduction is\nRamsey\u2019s bottom-up construction by reduction:\ntransformation reductions streamline formulations of theories in such\na way that they extend basic theories upwards by engineering their\napplication to specific context or phenomena. As a consequence, they\nreveal, by construction, new relations and systems that are\nantecedently absent from a scientist\u2019s understanding of the\ntheory\u2014independently of a top or reduced theory (Ramsey 1995). A\nweaker framework of ontological unification is categorial\nunity, wherein abstract categories such as causality,\ninformation, etc., are attached to the interpretation of the specific\nvariables and properties in models of phenomena.\n",
