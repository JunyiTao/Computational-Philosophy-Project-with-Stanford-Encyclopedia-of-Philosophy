For instance,\n\n\n[\u2026] the same objects can be considered from two different\nsides, on the one side as objects of the senses and\nthe understanding for experience, and on the other\nside as objects that are merely thought at most for isolated\nreason striving beyond the bounds of experience. (Bxviii\u2013Bxix,\nnote)\n\n[\u2026] the reservation must well be noted that even if we cannot\ncognize these same objects as things in themselves, we are lat least\nable to think of them as things in themselves.\n (Bxxvi)[38]\n\n\nThe general characteristic of such passages is that they use the same\nchain of pronouns to refer both to appearances and things in\nthemselves. This strongly suggests that one and the same\nobject can be an appearance and a thing in itself, or, to put it\nanother way, the distinction between appearance and thing in itself is\nnot a distinction between two or more objects, but a distinction\nbetween two different aspects of, or ways of considering, one and the\nsame object. One and the same object can be considered as it\nappears to us in experience, or as it is in itself.\nConsidered in the former way, the object must conform to our a\npriori intuitional forms, so it is in space and time. Considered\nin the other way, the object may not be in space and time. Some\n\u201cdual aspect\u201d readers cite the increased frequency of such\npassages in the Prolegomena and the B Edition as evidence\nthat Kant, realizing that his distinction between two aspects of\nobjects was being conflated with a distinction between two kinds of\nobjects, sought to remedy this interpretation by emphasizing precisely\nthis point. Prauss (1974) notes that, in most cases, Kant uses the\nexpression \u201cDinge [Sachen, Objecte,\nGegenst\u00e4nde] an sich selbst\u201d rather than\nthe shorter form \u201cDinge an sich\u201d. He argues that\n\u201can sich selbst\u201d functions as an adverb to modify\nan implicit attitude verb like \u201cto consider\u201d\n[betrachten]. He concludes that the dominant use of these\nexpressions is as a short-hand for \u201cthings considered as they\nare in themselves\u201d (Prauss 1974: 14\u201315).\n\nDifferent scholars understand this distinction in different ways. The\nmain difference is between epistemological and metaphysical\n\u201cdual aspect\u201d interpretations (Allison 2004: 52). On the\nepistemological reading, the distinction between appearances and\nthings in themselves is simply a distinction in the standpoint from\nwhich we consider them. We can consider objects as objects of\nknowledge for discursive spatiotemporal cognizers like us, in which\ncase we are considering objects as appearances. Or we can\nabstract from our particular cognitive conditions and consider objects\nmerely as objects for a mind in general, in which case we are\nconsidering them as things in themselves. It is crucial to\nthe epistemological reading that there is no sense in which the\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d perspective on objects as things in\nthemselves gets at how objects \u201care in themselves\u201d.\nThe point of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, epistemological\ninterpreters stress, is to get away from the incoherent idea of a\n\u201cview from nowhere\u201d in which we could know objects as they\n\u201creally are in\n themselves\u201d.[39]\n\nBy contrast, metaphysical \u201cdual aspect\u201d interpreters take\nthe distinction to carry more metaphysical weight. They interpret the\nappearance/thing in itself distinction as a metaphysical distinction\nbetween two different classes of properties had by objects, for\ninstance, their relational properties and their intrinsic properties.\nAppearances are objects qua bearers of \u201cempirical\nproperties\u201d (e.g., relational properties) while things in\nthemselves are the very same objects qua bearers of\n\u201cnoumenal\u201d or \u201cnon-empirical\u201d properties\n(e.g., intrinsic properties). The next two sub-sections explore the\nepistemological interpretation of Henry Allison. The remainder of the\nsections concerns metaphysical \u201cdual aspect\u201d readings,\nfocusing on the widely discussed interpretation of Langton (1998).\n",
