    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) added the chapter in which he treats\npersons and their persistence conditions (Book 2, Chapter 27) to the\nsecond edition of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in\n1694, only after being encouraged to do so by William Molyneux\n (1692\u20131693).[1]\n Nevertheless, Locke\u2019s treatment of personal identity is one of\nthe most discussed and debated aspects of his corpus. Locke\u2019s\ndiscussion of persons received much attention from his contemporaries,\nignited a heated debate over personal identity, and continues to\ninfluence and inform the debate over persons and their persistence\nconditions. This entry aims to first get clear on the basics of\nLocke\u2019s position, when it comes to persons and personal\nidentity, before turning to areas of the text that continue to be\ndebated by historians of philosophy working to make sense of\nLocke\u2019s picture of persons today. It then canvases how\nLocke\u2019s discussion of persons was received by his\ncontemporaries, and concludes by briefly addressing how those working\nin metaphysics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have\nresponded to Locke\u2019s view\u2014giving the reader a glimpse of\nLocke\u2019s lasting impact and influence on the debate over personal\nidentity.\n",
