This fact\nmay be expressed as follows: In eliminating a symbol, we may use the\nformula with whose terminal symbol we are dealing only \u2018in the\nsense afforded it by the introduction of that symbol\u2019. (Gentzen,\n1934/35, p. 80)\n\n\nThis cannot mean, of course, that the elimination rules are\ndeducible from the introduction rules in the literal sense of\nthe word; in fact, they are not. It can only mean that they can be\njustified by them in some way.\n\nBy making these ideas more precise it should be possible to display\nthe E-inferences as unique functions of their corresponding\nI-inferences, on the basis of certain requirements. (ibid., p. 81)\n\n\nSo the idea underlying Gentzen\u2019s programme is that we have\n\u201cdefinitions\u201d in the form of introduction rules and some\nsort of semantic reasoning which, by using \u201ccertain\nrequirements\u201d, validate the elimination rules.\n\nBy adopting Lorenzen\u2019s term and adapting its underlying idea\n(see section\n 2.1.1)\n to the context of natural deduction, Prawitz (1965) formulated an\n\u201cinversion principle\u201d to make Gentzen\u2019s remarks more\nprecise:\n\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be an application of an elimination rule that has \\(B\\)\nas consequence. Then, deductions that satisfy the sufficient condition\n[\u2026] for deriving the major premiss of \\(\\alpha\\), when combined\nwith deductions of the minor premisses of \\(\\alpha\\) (if any), already\n\u201ccontain\u201d a deduction of \\(B\\); the deduction of \\(B\\) is\nthus obtainable directly from the given deductions without the\naddition of \\(\\alpha\\). (p. 33)\n\n\nHere the sufficient conditions are given by the premisses of the\ncorresponding introduction rules. Thus the inversion principle says\nthat a derivation of the conclusion of an elimination rule can be\nobtained without an application of the elimination rule if its major\npremiss has been derived using an introduction rule in the last step,\nwhich means that a combination \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\vdots$}\n\\RightLabel{I-inference}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$\\{\\mathcal{D}_i\\}$}\n\\RightLabel{E-inference}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nof steps, where \\(\\{\\mathcal{D}_i\\}\\) stands for a (possibly empty)\nlist of deductions of minor premisses, can be avoided.\n\nThe relationship between introduction and elimination rules is often\ndescribed as \u201charmony\u201d (Dummett 1973, pp. 396\u2013397),\nor as governed by a \u201cprinciple of harmony\u201d (Tennant, 1978,\np. 74). This terminology is not uniform and sometimes not even fully\nclear. It essentially expresses what is also meant by\n\u201cinversion\u201d. Even if \u201charmony\u201d is a term which\nsuggests a symmetric relationship, it is frequently understood as\nexpressing a conception based on introduction rules as, e.g., in\nRead\u2019s (2010) \u201cgeneral elimination harmony\u201d\n(although occasionally one includes elimination-based conceptions as\nwell). Sometimes harmony is supposed to mean that connectives are\nstrongest or weakest in a certain sense given their introduction or\ntheir elimination rules. This idea underlies Tennant\u2019s (1978)\nharmony principle, and also Popper\u2019s and Koslow\u2019s\nstructural characterizations (see section\n 2.4).\n The specific relationship between introduction and elimination rules\nas formulated in an inversion principle excludes alleged inferential\ndefinitions such as that of the connective tonk, which\ncombines an introduction rule for disjunction with an elimination rule\nfor conjunction, and which has given rise to a still ongoing debate on\nthe format of inferential definitions. Formal characterizations of\nharmony have used the translation of inference rules into second-order\npropositional logic (Girard\u2019s system F) and have become a\ncentral topic of intensional proof-theoretic semantics (Tranchini,\n2023).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor logical connectives in general, see the entry on\n sentence connectives in formal logic.\n\nFor inversion principles, see Schroeder-Heister (2007).\n\nFor variants of proof-theoretic harmony, see Francez (2015),\nSchroeder-Heister (2016) and Tranchini (2023).\n2.2.2 Proof-theoretic validity\n\nProof-theoretic validity is the leading approach in proof-theoretic\nsemantics. As a technical concept it was developed by Prawitz (1971;\n1973; 1974), by turning a proof-theoretic validity notion based on\nideas by Tait (1967) and originally used to prove strong\nnormalization, into a semantical concept. Dummett provided much\nphilosophical underpinning to this notion (see Dummett, 1991). The\nobjects which are primarily valid are proofs as representations of\narguments. In a secondary sense, single rules can be valid if they\nlead from valid proofs to valid proofs. In this sense, validity is a\nglobal rather than a local notion. It applies to arbitrary derivations\nover a given atomic system, which defines derivability for atoms.\nCalling a proof canonical, if it uses an introduction rule in\nthe last step, proof-theoretic validity is based on the following\nthree ideas:\n\nThe priority of closed canonical proofs.\nThe reduction of closed non-canonical proofs to canonical\nones.\nThe substitutional view of open proofs.\n\n\nAd 1: The definition of validity is based on Gentzen\u2019s\nidea that introduction rules are \u2018self-justifying\u2019 and\ngive the logical constants their meaning. This self-justifying feature\nis only used for closed proofs, which are considered primary over open\nones.\n\nAd 2: Noncanonical proofs are justified by reducing them to\ncanonical ones. Thus reduction procedures (detour reductions) as used\nin normalization proofs play a crucial role. As they justify\narguments, they are also called \u201cjustifications\u201d by\nPrawitz. This definition again only applies to closed proofs,\ncorresponding to the introduction form property of closed normal\nderivations in natural deduction (see section\n 1.3).\n\nAd 3: Open proofs are justified by considering their closed\ninstances. These closed instances are obtained by replacing their open\nassumptions with closed proofs of them, and their open variables with\nclosed terms. For example, a proof of \\(B\\) from \\(A\\) is considered\nvalid, if every closed proof, which is obtained by replacing the open\nassumption \\(A\\) with a closed valid proof of \\(A\\), is valid. In this\nway, open assumptions are considered to be placeholders for closed\nproofs, which is why we may speak of a substitutional interpretation\nof open proofs.\n\nThis yields the following definition of proof-theoretic validity:\n\nEvery closed proof in the underlying atomic system is valid.\nA closed canonical proof is considered valid, if its immediate\nsubproofs are valid.\nA closed noncanonical proof is considered valid, if it reduces to\na valid closed canonical proof or to a closed proof in the atomic\nsystem.\nAn open proof is considered valid, if every closed proof obtained\nby replacing its open assumptions with closed valid proofs and its\nopen variables with closed terms is valid.\n\n\nFormally, this definition has to be relativized to the atomic system\nconsidered (see section\n 2.6),\n and to a set of available justifications (proof reductions).\nFurthermore, proofs are here understood as\ncandidates of valid proofs (\u201carguments\u201d in\nPrawitz\u2019s terminology), which means that the rules from which\nthey are composed are not fixed. They look like proof trees, but their\nindividual steps can have an arbitrary (finite) number of premisses\nand can eliminate arbitrary assumptions. The definition of validity\nsingles out those proof structures which are \u2018real\u2019 proofs\non the basis of the given reduction procedures.\n\nValidity with respect to every choice of an atomic system can be\nviewed as a generalized notion of logical validity. In fact, if we\nconsider the standard reductions of intuitionistic logic, then all\nderivations in intuitionistic logic are valid independent of the\natomic system considered. This is semantical correctness. We\nmay ask if the converse holds, viz. whether for any proof that is\nvalid for every atomic system, there is a corresponding derivation in\nintuitionistic logic. That intuitionistic logic is complete in this\nsense is known as Prawitz\u2019s conjecture (see Prawitz, 1973;\n2013). There are certain doubts concerning the validity of this\nconjecture for systems that go beyond implicational logic. In any case\nit will depend on the precise formulation of the notion of validity,\nin particular on its handling of atomic systems (see section\n 2.8).\n\nFor a more formal definition and detailed examples demonstrating\nvalidity, as well as some remarks on Prawitz\u2019s conjecture see\nthe\n\nSupplement on Examples of Proof-theoretic Validity.\n \n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor a detailed exposition of further developments of\nPrawitz\u2019s theory of proof-theoretic validity, in\nparticular his theory of grounds, see Piccolomini d\u2019Aragona\n(2023).\n\nFor a computational interpretation of proof-theoretic\nvalidity as a method for tactical proof see Gheorghiu and Pym\n(2022, other internet resources).\n2.2.3 Constructive type theory\n\nMartin-L\u00f6f\u2019s type theory (Martin-L\u00f6f, 1984) is a\nleading approach in constructive logic and mathematics.\nPhilosophically, it shares with Prawitz the three fundamental\nassumptions of standard proof-theoretic semantics, mentioned in\nsection\n 2.2.2:\n the priority of closed canonical proofs, the reduction of closed\nnon-canonical proofs to canonical ones and the substitutional view of\nopen proofs. However, Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s type theory has at least\ntwo characteristic features which go beyond other approaches in\nproof-theoretic semantics:\n\nThe consideration of proof objects and the corresponding\ndistinction between proofs-as-objects and\nproofs-as-demonstrations.\nThe view of formation rules as intrinsic to the proof system\nrather than as external rules.\n\n\nThe first idea goes back to the Curry-Howard correspondence (see de\nGroote, 1995; S\u00f8rensen and Urzyczyn, 2006), according to which\nthe fact that a formula \\(A\\) has a certain proof can be codified as\nthe fact that a certain term \\(t\\) is of type \\(A\\), whereby the\nformula \\(A\\) is identified with the type \\(A\\). This can be\nformalized in a calculus for type assignment, whose statements are of\nthe form \\(t {:} A\\). A proof of \\(t {:} A\\) in this system can be\nread as showing that \\(t\\) is a proof of \\(A\\). Martin-L\u00f6f (1995;\n1998) has put this into a philosophical perspective by distinguishing\nthis two-fold sense of proof in the following way. First we have\nproofs of statements of the form \\(t {:} A\\). These statements are\ncalled judgements, their proofs are called\ndemonstrations. Within such judgements the term\n\\(t\\) represents a proof of the proposition \\(A\\). A\nproof in the latter sense is also called a proof object. When\ndemonstrating a judgement \\(t {:} A\\), we demonstrate that \\(t\\) is a\nproof (object) for the proposition \\(A\\). Within this two-layer system\nthe demonstration layer is the layer of argumentation. Unlike\nproof objects, demonstrations have epistemic significance; their\njudgements carry assertoric force. The proof layer is the layer at\nwhich meanings are explained: The meaning of a proposition \\(A\\) is\nexplained by telling what counts as a proof (object) for \\(A\\). The\ndistinction made between canonical and non-canonical proofs is a\ndistinction at the propositional and not at the judgemental layer.\nThis implies a certain explicitness requirement. When I have proved\nsomething, I must not only have a justification for my proof at my\ndisposal as in Prawitz\u2019s notion of validity, but at the\nsame time have to be certain that this justification fulfills\nits purpose. This certainty is guaranteed by a demonstration.\nMathematically, this two-fold sense of proof develops its real power\nonly when types may depend on terms. Dependent types are a basic\ningredient of of Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s type theory and related\napproaches.\n\nThe second idea makes Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s approach strongly differ\nfrom all other definitions of proof-theoretic validity. The crucial\ndifference, for example, to Prawitz\u2019s procedure is that it is\nnot metalinguistic in character, where\n\u201cmetalinguistic\u201d means that propositions and candidates of\nproofs are specified first and then, by means of a definition in the\nmetalanguage, it is fixed which of them are valid and which are not.\nRather, propositions and proofs come into play only in the context of\ndemonstrations. For example, if we assume that something is a proof of\nan implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), we need not necessarily show that\nboth \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are well-formed propositions outright, but, in\naddition to knowing that \\(A\\) is a proposition, we only need to know\nthat \\(B\\) is a proposition provided that \\(A\\) has been\nproved. Being a proposition is expressed by a specific form of\njudgement, which is established in the same system of demonstration\nwhich is used to establish that a proof of a proposition has been\nachieved.\n\nIn Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s theory, proof-theoretic semantics receives\na strongly ontological component. A recent debate deals with the\nquestion of whether proof objects have a purely ontological status or\nwhether they codify knowledge, even if they are not epistemic acts\nthemselves. More recently, Martin-L\u00f6f has embedded his approach\ninto a theory of interaction between assertions, challenges and\nobligations (Martin-L\u00f6f 2019) which gives his proof-theoretic\nsemantics a pragmatic aspect and also relates it to dialogical\nsemantics (see section\n 3.9).\n\nMartin-L\u00f6f\u2019s type theory has found its most significant\nmathematical application in homotopy theory, leading to homotopy type\ntheory (HoTT) and the univalent foundations programme (The Univalent\nFoundations Program 2013). The latter is often (sometimes\ncontroversially) considered a novel foundational approach to\nmathematics in the intuitionistic spirit, as an alternative to\nclassical set-theoretic approaches.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor the history and philosophy of Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\ntype theory see Sommaruga (2000). For type theory in\ngeneral, for homotopy type theory, and for the univalent\nfoundations programme, see the entry on\n intuitionistic type theory\n and the entry on\n type theory.\n \n2.3 Clausal definitions and definitional reasoning\n\nProof-theoretic semantics normally focuses on logical constants. This\nfocus is practically never questioned, apparently because it is\nconsidered so obvious. In proof theory, little attention has been paid\nto atomic systems, although there has been Lorenzen\u2019s early work\n(see section\n 2.1.1),\n where the justification of logical rules is embedded in a theory of\narbitrary rules, and Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s (1971) theory of iterated\ninductive definitions where introduction and elimination rules for\natomic formulas are proposed. The rise of logic programming has\nwidened this perspective. From the proof-theoretic point of view,\nlogic programming is a theory of atomic reasoning with respect to\nclausal definitions of atoms. Definitional reflection is an approach\nto proof-theoretic semantics that takes up this challenge and attempts\nto build a theory whose range of application goes beyond logical\nconstants.\n2.3.1 The challenge from logic programming\n\nIn logic programming we are dealing with program clauses of the\nform \n\\[\nA \\Leftarrow B_1 , \\ldots ,B_m\n\\]\n\n\nwhich define atomic formulas. Such clauses can naturally be\ninterpreted as describing introduction rules for atoms. From the point\nof view of proof-theoretic semantics the following two points are\nessential:\n\n(1) Introduction rules (clauses) for logically compound formulas are\nnot distinguished in principle from introduction rules (clauses) for\natoms. Interpreting logic programming proof-theoretically motivates an\nextension of proof-theoretic semantics to arbitrary atoms, which\nyields a semantics with a much wider realm of applications.\n\n(2) Program clauses are not necessarily well-founded. For example, the\nhead of a clause may occur in its body. Well-founded programs are just\na particular sort of programs. The use of arbitrary clauses without\nfurther requirements in logic programming is a motivation to pursue\nthe same idea in proof-theoretic semantics. One would admit any sort\nof introduction rules and not just those of a special form, and in\nparticular not necessarily ones which are well-founded. This carries\nthe idea of definitional freedom, which is a cornerstone of logic\nprogramming, over to semantics, again widening the realm of\napplication of proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nThe idea of considering introduction rules as meaning-giving rules for\natoms is closely related to the theory of inductive definitions in its\ngeneral form, according to which inductive definitions are systems of\nrules (see Aczel, 1977).\n2.3.2 Definitional reflection\n\nThe theory of definitional reflection (Halln\u00e4s, 1991; 2006;\nHalln\u00e4s and Schroeder-Heister, 1990/91; Schroeder-Heister, 1993)\ntakes up the challenge from logic programming and gives a\nproof-theoretic semantics not just for logical constants but for\narbitrary expressions, for which a clausal definition can be given.\nFormally, this approach starts with a list of clauses which is the\ndefinition considered. Each clause has the form\n\n\\[\nA \\Leftarrow \\Delta\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the head \\(A\\) is an atomic formula (atom). In the simplest\ncase, the body \\(\\Delta\\) is a list of atoms \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_m\\), in\nwhich case a definition looks like a definite logic program. We often\nconsider an extended case where \\(\\Delta\\) may also contain some\nstructural implication \u2018\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\u2019, and sometimes\neven some structural universal quantification, which essentially is\nhandled by restricting substitution. If the definition of \\(A\\) has\nthe form \n\\[ \\mathbb{D}_A\\ \\left\\{ \n\\begin{array}{rcl} \nA & \\Leftarrow & \\Delta_1 \\\\ \n  & \\vdots & \\\\ \nA & \\Leftarrow & \\Delta_n \n\\end{array} \\right. \\]\n\n\nthen \\(A\\) has the following introduction and elimination rules\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\Delta_1$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\;\\cdots\\;\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\Delta_n$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$[\\Delta_1]$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$C$}\n\\AxiomC{$\\cdots$}\n\\AxiomC{$[\\Delta_n]$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$C$}\n\\QuaternaryInfC{$C$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThe introduction rules, also called rules of definitional\nclosure, express reasoning \u2018along\u2019 the clauses. The\nelimination rule is called the principle of definitional\nreflection, as it reflects upon the definition as a whole. If\n\\(\\Delta_1,\\ldots,\\Delta_n\\) exhaust all possible conditions\nto generate \\(A\\) according to the given definition, and if each of\nthese conditions entails the very same conclusion \\(C\\), then \\(A\\)\nitself entails this conclusion. If the clausal definition is viewed as\nan inductive definition, this principle can be viewed as expressing\nthe extremal clause in inductive definitions: Nothing else beyond the\nclauses given defines \\(A\\). Obviously, definitional reflection is a\ngeneralized form of the inversion principles discussed. It develops\nits genuine power in definitional contexts with free variables that go\nbeyond purely propositional reasoning, and in contexts which are not\nwell-founded. An example of a non-wellfounded definition is the\ndefinition of an atom \\(R\\) by its own negation: \n\\[\n\\mathbb{D}_R \\;\\{\\;  R \\Leftarrow (R \\Rightarrow \\bot)\n\\]\n\n\nDefining an atom by its negation is a standard example in logic\nprogramming. In the context of definitional reflection it was\nsuggested by Halln\u00e4s. It is here discussed in detail in the\n\nSupplement on Definitional Reflection and Paradoxes.\n \n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor non-wellfoundedness and paradoxes see the entry\non\n self-reference\n and the entry on\n Russell\u2019s paradox.\n2.4 Structural characterization of logical constants\n\nThere is a large field of ideas and results concerning what might be\ncalled the \u201cstructural characterization\u201d of logical\nconstants, where \u201cstructural\u201d is here meant both in the\nproof-theoretic sense of \u201cstructural rules\u201d and in the\nsense of a framework that bears a certain structure, where this\nframework is again proof-theoretically described. Some of its authors\nuse a semantical vocabulary and at least implicitly suggest that their\ntopic belongs to proof-theoretic semantics. Others explicitly deny\nthese connotations, emphasizing that they are interested in a\ncharacterization which establishes the logicality of a constant. The\nquestion \u201cWhat is a logical constant?\u201d can be answered in\nproof-theoretic terms, even if the semantics of the constants\nthemselves is truth-conditional: Namely by requiring that the (perhaps\ntruth-conditionally defined) constants show a certain inferential\nbehaviour that can be described in proof-theoretic terms. However, as\nsome of the authors consider their characterization at the same time\nas a semantics, it is appropriate that we mention some of these\napproaches here.\n\nThe most outspoken structuralist with respect to logical constants,\nwho explicitly understands himself as such, is Koslow. In his\nStructuralist Theory of Logic (1992) he develops a theory of\nlogical constants, in which he characterizes them by certain\n\u201cimplication relations\u201d, where an implication relation\nroughly corresponds to a finite consequence relation in Tarski\u2019s\nsense (which again can be described by certain structural rules of a\nsequent-style system). Koslow develops a structural theory in the\nprecise metamathematical sense, which does not specify the domain of\nobjects in any way beyond the axioms given. If a language or any other\ndomain of objects equipped with an implication relation is given, the\nstructural approach can be used to single out logical compounds by\nchecking their implicational properties.\n\nIn his early papers on the foundations of logic, Popper (1947a; 1947b;\nBinder et al., eds., 2022) gives inferential characterizations of\nlogical constants in proof-theoretic terms. He uses a calculus of\nsequents and characterizes logical constants by certain derivability\nconditions for such sequents. His terminology clearly suggests that he\nintends a proof-theoretic semantics of logical constants, as he speaks\nof \u201cinferential definitions\u201d and the \u201ctrivialization\nof mathematical logic\u201d achieved by defining constants in the way\ndescribed. Although his presentation is not free from conceptual\nimprecision and error, he anticipated many ideas now common in\nproof-theoretic semantics, such as the delineation of logical\nconstants by means of certain minimality or maximality conditions with\nrespect to introduction or elimination rules.\n\nImportant contributions to the logicality debate that characterize\nlogical constants inferentially in terms of sequent calculus rules are\nthose by Kneale (1956) and Hacking (1979). A thorough account of\nlogicality is proposed by Do\u0161en (1980; 1989) in his theory of\nlogical constants as \u201cpunctuation marks\u201d, expressing\nstructural features at the logical level. He understands logical\nconstants as following certain double-line rules for sequents which\ncan be read in both directions. For example, conjunction and\ndisjunction obey (in classical logic, with multiple-formulae\nsuccedents) the double-line rules \n\\[\n\\xlongequal[{\\Large \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, A \\,\\land\\, B,\\, \\Delta}]\n{{\\Large \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, A,\\, \\Delta\\quad \\Gamma \\,\\vdash\\, B,\\, \\Delta}}\n\\hspace{2em}\n\\xlongequal[{\\Large \\Gamma,\\, A \\,\\lor\\, B \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta}]\n{{\\Large \\Gamma,\\, A \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta\\quad \\Gamma,\\, B \\,\\vdash\\, \\Delta}}\n\\]\n\n\nDo\u0161en is able to give characterizations which include systems\nof modal logic. He explicitly considers his work as a contribution to\nthe logicality debate and not to any conception of proof-theoretic\nsemantics. Sambin et al., in their Basic Logic (Sambin, Battilotti,\nand Faggian, 2000), explicitly understand what Do\u0161en calls\ndouble-line rules as fundamental meaning giving rules. The double-line\nrules for conjunction and disjunction are read as implicit definitions\nof these constants, which by some procedure can be turned into the\nexplicit sequent-style rules we are used to. So Sambin et al. use the\nsame starting point as Do\u0161en, but interpret it not as a\nstructural description of the behaviour of constants, but semantically\nas their implicit definition.\n\nThere are several other approaches to a uniform proof-theoretic\ncharacterization of logical constants, all of which at least touch\nupon issues of proof-theoretic semantics. Such theories are\nBelnap\u2019s Display Logic (Belnap, 1982), Wansing\u2019s Logic of\nInformation Structures (Wansing, 1993b), generic proof editing systems\nand their implementations such as the Edinburgh Logical Framework\n(Harper, Honsell, and Plotkin, 1987) and many successors which allow\nthe specification of a variety of logical systems. Since the rise of\nlinear and, more generally, substructural logics there are various\napproaches dealing with logics that differ with respect to\nrestrictions on their structural rules (see section\n 3.10).\n A recent movement away from singling out a particular logic as the\ntrue one towards a more pluralist stance (see, e.g., Beall and\nRestall, 2006), which is interested in what different logics have in\ncommon without any preference for a particular logic, can be seen as a\nshift away from semantical justification towards structural\ncharacterization.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor Popper\u2019s theory of logical constants see Binder et\nal. (2022), Piecha (2023).\n\nFor logical constants and their logicality see the\nentry on\n logical constants.\n\nFor linear and substructural logics see the entry on\n linear logic,\n and the entry on\n substructural logics.\n\nFor pluralism in logic, see the entry on on\n logical pluralism.\n2.5 Categorial proof theory\n\nThere is a considerable literature on category theory in relation to\nproof theory, and, following seminal work by Lawvere, Lambek and\nothers (see Lambek and Scott, 1986), category theory itself can be\nviewed as a kind of abstract proof theory. If one looks at an arrow\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) in a category as a kind of abstract proof of \\(B\\)\nfrom \\(A\\), we have a representation which goes beyond pure\nderivability of \\(B\\) from \\(A\\) (as the arrow has its individuality),\nbut does not deal with the particular syntactic structure of this\nproof. For intuitionistic systems, proof-theoretic semantics in\ncategorial form comes probably closest to what denotational semantics\nis in the classical case.\n\nOne of the most highly developed approaches to categorial proof theory\nis due to Do\u0161en. He has not only advanced the application of\ncategorial methods in proof theory (e.g., Do\u0161en and\nPetri\u0107, 2004), but also shown how proof-theoretic methods can be\nused in category theory itself (Do\u0161en, 2000). Most important\nfor categorial logic in relation to proof-theoretic semantics is that\nin categorial logic, arrows always come together with an identity\nrelation, which in proof-theory corresponds to the identity of proofs.\nIn this way, ideas and results of categorial proof theory pertain to\nwhat may be called intensional proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 3.7),\n that is, the study of proofs as entities in their own right, not just\nas vehicles to establish consequences (Do\u0161en, 2006; 2016).\n\nAs there is the strong relationship between arrows in the categorial\nsense and proofs in the sense of deductive reasoning, there are\ncategorial analogues to practically all concepts dealt with in the\ndeductive realm, often with novel methods, ideas and results that\nsupplement deductive approaches in a very productive way. Categorial\nproof-theoretic semantics is a very broad research area that runs in\nparallel to the deductive perspective adopted in this entry \u2015\nthe deductive perspective is by far more common in philosophy. In the\nfield of intuitionistic logic, categorial logic covers highly advanced\ntopics: beyond standard quantifier logic dependent type theories in\nthe tradition of Martin-L\u00f6f (see section\n 2.2.3)\n including homotopy type theory. For many other logical systems\ncategorial semantics have been developed, including classical logic\nand various substructural logics such as linear logic.\n\nA philosophically highly significant general feature of categorial\nproof-theory is its inherently hypothetical character. This is due to\nthe fact that it starts from hypothetical statements \\(A \\rightarrow\nB\\) (arrows) rather than categorical statements \\(A\\)\n(\u201ccategorical\u201d as opposed to \u201chypothetical\u201d,\nnot \u201ccategorial\u201d which is used here for \u201cpertaining\nto category theory\u201d). It this way it overcomes a paradigm of\nstandard, in particular validity-based, proof-theoretic semantics (see\nsection\n 3.6).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor categorial approaches in general see the entry on\n category theory\n and the entry on\n structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nFor categorial proof-theoretic semantics see Pym, Ritter, and\nRobinson (2023, other internet resources).\n2.6 Atomic systems\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is predominantly concerned with logical\nconstants. Even if one agrees with this orientation \u2014 the theory\nof definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2)\n is an exception to it \u2014 we must nonetheless fix the status of\natomic sentences and their proofs. In model-theoretic semantics the\ntruth of a logically complex sentence is defined with respect to a\nstructure, which is called a \u201cmodel\u201d of this sentence.\nThis structure determines, which atomic sentences are true and which\nare not. Whether a complex sentence is true hinges on its atomic\nconstituents. This is quite analogous in proof-theoretic semantics.\nWhether a proof of a complex sentence is valid depends on the atomic\nbase of the system under consideration. Here an atomic base is\nnormally considered a calculus for the generation of atomic sentences:\nProofs of atomic sentences in the atomic base are per se valid.\nSimilar to the model-theoretic definition of logical truth as truth\nwith respect to all structures, in proof-theoretic semantics one would\ndefine logically valid proofs as proofs which are valid with respect\nto all atomic bases.\n\nThere are various options which atomic systems should be considered to\nbe candidates for atomic bases. (1) The simplest would be Herbrand\nmodels as used in the theory of logic programming, which are just\ncollections of atomic sentences. Proof-theoretically, these would be\ncalculi consisting of axioms only, without proper rules of inference.\n(2) In the writings of Lorenzen (see section\n 2.1.1)\n and Prawitz (see section\n 2.2.2)\n atomic systems are considered lists of production rules, that is,\ncalculi with axioms and rules of the form \\(A_1,\\ldots,A_n \\Rightarrow\nB\\) allowing one to generate \\(B\\) from \\(A_1,\\ldots,A_n\\). (3) More\ninvolved systems may contain atomic rules that allow one to discharge\nassumptions, quite in analogy to logical rules such as implication\nintroduction. (4) Generalizing this idea one may admit rules for atoms\nthat discharge rules themselves, that is, rules of higher levels (see\nsection\n 2.1.3).\n (5) Even further advanced would be atomic systems that incorporate\nrules of definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2).\n \u2014 Many other sorts of rules for atoms constituting atomic\nsystems may be imagined.\n\nFor proof-theoretic semantics, the critical point here is that certain\nformal results depend on which types of atomic systems are admitted.\nThis holds in particular for the issue of semantical completeness (see\nsection\n 2.8).\n The investigation of which atomic systems, when taken as atomic bases\nof proof-theoretic semantics, lead to which formal system at the\nlogical level, has just begun (see Sandqvist 2015b; Piecha and\nSchroeder-Heister, 2016a; Stafford 2023, other internet resources). It\nshould be noted that this is an intensional feature of proof-theoretic\nsemantics: We are not just interested in which atoms are generated by\nthe various forms of atomic systems, but how this is done, that is, by\nwhich type of rules this is achieved. This is a crucial difference to\nmodel-theoretic semantics, which is purely extensional in this\nrespect. For further intensional features of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee section\n 3.7.\n2.7 Sentence-based semantics\n\nInstead of defining the validity of proofs of sentences, one can\ndefine the proof-theoretic validity of sentences directly. In the\ndefinition of validity of logically complex sentences one would then\ndiscard the reference to proofs of these sentences. This does not mean\nthat one is giving up the proof-theoretic approach, as one would still\nrefer to proofs in the atomic base. Proofs come in at the atomic\nlevel, but not at the logical level. This approach is technically much\nsimpler to elaborate than the one based on the validity of proofs (see\nsection\n 2.2.2),\n but still sufficient to discuss basic topics such as semantical\ncompleteness (see section\n 2.8).\n In fact, from a proof of a sentence \\(A\\) which is valid in the sense\nof section\n 2.2.2,\n the validity of \\(A\\) in the sense of sentence-based semantics can be\ninferred; and conversely, from the validity of \\(A\\) in sentence-based\nsemantics a (though degenerate) valid proof of \\(A\\) can be\nconstructed. In a sense, sentence-based semantics is related to the\nproof-theoretic semantics inherent in Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s system\n(see section\n 2.2.3),\n where in the case of elementary logic (where dependent types do not\nplay any role), the proof information \\(t\\) of a judgement \\(t{:}A\\)\ncan be discarded in favour of the simplified judgement \\(A\\\n\\textit{true}\\).\n\nOne possible definition of the validity of sentences in minimal\npropositional logic with respect to an atomic system \\(S\\) as its\natomic base in propositional logic would be the following:\n\nAn atomic formula \\(A\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if it is derivable in\n\\(S\\).\nA conjunction \\(A\\land B\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare \\(S\\)-valid.\nA disjunction \\(A\\lor B\\) is \\(S\\)-valid, if either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nis \\(S\\)-valid.\nAn implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is \\(S\\) valid, if for every\nextension \\(S'\\) of \\(S\\), if \\(A\\) if \\(S'\\)-valid then \\(B\\) is\n\\(S'\\)-valid.\n\n\nNote that in the statement of hypothetical validity reference is made\nto arbitrary extensions of the atomic base considered. As in the\nformal definition of the validity of proofs, considering\nbase-extensions is used to ensure monotonicity and to avoid vacuous\nvalidity. In the literature, following Sandqvist (2015a), the term\n\u201cbase-extension semantics\u201d is often used in a more\nspecific sense: namely for a special form of sentence-based semantics,\nin which disjunction receives a deviant interpretation.\n\nValidity in sentence-based semantics depends on the choice of atomic\nsystems. This choice is what makes sentence-based semantics\nproof-theoretic. As indicated in section\n 2.6,\n the type of atomic system counts, as does the extension relation\nconsidered for implications and consequence statements.\n2.8 Semantical completeness\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is intuitionistic in spirit, at least by its\norigin. Correspondingly, Prawitz (1971) conjectured that those\nconsequence statements \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\), which are justified by\nproofs valid with respect to any atomic base, are exactly the\nderivability statements \\(\\Gamma \\vdash A\\) of the formal system of\nintuitionistic logic. Within the framework of sentence semantics,\nwhich for the issue of validity in relation to semantical completeness\nis easier to handle than the framework of valid proofs, this\nconjecture turned out to be false. Harrop\u2019s rule\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\neg A \\to (B \\lor C)$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$(\\neg A \\to B) \\lor (\\neg A \\to C)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nwhich is not derivable (but only admissible) in intuitionistic logic\ncan be validated in this framework (Piecha and Schroeder-Heister,\n2019). However, when the extension structure of atomic bases is\nmodified beyond the set-theoretical superset relation, the picture\nchanges and Kripke\u2019s completeness proof for intuitionistic logic\nbecomes applicable to the proof-theoretic framework (Goldfarb 2016;\nStafford and Nascimento 2023). Another way to avoid incompleteness is\nto give disjunction a non-standard interpretation, for example by\nrequiring that the minor premisses and conclusion of the rule of\n\\(\\lor\\)-elimination can always be considered atomic (see Sandqvist,\n2015a).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor Prawitz\u2019s completeness conjecture see the\n Supplement on Examples of Proof-theoretic Validity.\n\nFor the role of Harrop\u2019s rule in the context of admissibility\nstatements for intuitionistic logic, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic.\n3. Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics\n3.1 Elimination rules as basic\n\nMost approaches to proof-theoretic semantics consider introduction\nrules as basic, meaning giving, or self-justifying, whereas the\nelimination inferences are justified as valid with respect to the\ngiven introduction rules. This conception has at least three roots:\nThe first is a verificationist theory of meaning according to which\nthe assertibility conditions of a sentence constitute its meaning. The\nsecond is the idea that we must distinguish between what gives the\nmeaning and what are the consequences of this meaning, as not all\ninferential knowledge can consist of applications of definitions. The\nthird one is the primacy of assertion over other speech acts such as\nassuming or denying, which is implicit in all approaches considered so\nfar.\n\nOne might investigate how far one gets by considering elimination\nrules rather than introduction rules as a basis of proof-theoretic\nsemantics. Some ideas towards a proof-theoretic semantics based on\nelimination rather than introduction rules have been sketched by\nDummett (1991, Ch. 13), albeit in a very rudimentary form. A more\nprecise definition of validity based on elimination inferences is due\nto Prawitz (1971; 2007; see also Schroeder-Heister 2015). Its\nessential idea is that a closed proof is considered valid, if the\nresult of applying an elimination rule to its end formula is a valid\nproof or reduces to one. For example, a closed proof of an implication\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is valid, if, for any given closed valid proof of\n\\(A\\), the result of applying modus ponens \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\to B$}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nto these two proofs is a valid proof of \\(B\\), or reduces to such a\nproof. This conception keeps two of the three basic ingredients of\nPrawitz-style proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 2.2.2):\n the role of proof reduction and the substitutional view of\nassumptions. Only the canonicity of proofs ending with introductions\nis turned into the canonicity of proofs ending with eliminations.\n3.2 Negation and denial\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics is assertion-centred in that\nassertibility conditions determine the meaning of logical constants.\nCorresponding to the intuitionistic way of proceeding, the negation\n\\(\\neg A\\) of a formula \\(A\\) is normally understood as implying\nabsurdity \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\), where \\(\\bot\\) is a constant which\ncannot be asserted, i.e., for which no assertibility condition is\ndefined. This is an \u2018indirect\u2019 way of understanding\nnegation. In the literature there has been the discussion of what,\nfollowing von Kutschera (1969), might be called \u2018direct\u2019\nnegation. By that one understands a one-place primitive operator of\nnegation, which cannot be, or at least is not, reduced to implying\nabsurdity. It is not classical negation either. It rather obeys rules\nwhich dualize the usual rules for the logical constants. Sometimes it\nis called the \u201cdenial\u201d of a sentence, sometimes also\n\u201cstrong negation\u201d (see Odintsov, 2008). Typical rules for\nthe denial \\({\\sim}A\\) of \\(A\\) are \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\lor B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nEssentially, the denial rules for an operator correspond to the\nassertion rules for the dual operator. Several logics of denial have\nbeen investigated, in particular Nelson\u2019s (1949) logics of\n\u201cconstructible falsity\u201d motivated by Nelson with respect\nto a certain realizability semantics. The main focus has been on his\nsystems later called N3 and N4 which differ with respect to the\ntreatment of contradiction (N4 is N3 without ex contradictione\nquodlibet). Using denial any approach to proof-theoretic\nsemantics can be dualized by just exchanging assertion and denial and\nturning from logical constants to their duals. In doing so, one\nobtains a system based on refutation \\((=\\) proof of denial) rather\nthan proof. It can be understood as applying a Popperian view to\nproof-theoretic semantics by keeping its intuitionistic spirit.\nFormally, it leads to systems such as dual intuitionistic logic by\ngiving them a proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nAnother approach would be to not just dualize assertion-centered\nproof-theoretic semantics in favour of a denial-centered\nrefutation-theoretic semantics, but to see the relation between rules\nfor assertion and for denial as governed by an inversion principle or\nprinciple of definitional reflection of its own. This would be a\nprinciple of what might be called\n\u201cassertion-denial-harmony\u201d. Whereas in standard\nproof-theoretic semantics, inversion principles control the\nrelationship between assertions and assumptions (or consequences),\nsuch a principle would now regulate the relationship between assertion\nand denial. Given certain defining conditions of \\(A\\), it would say\nthat the denial of every defining condition of \\(A\\) leads to the\ndenial of \\(A\\) itself. For conjunction and disjunction this leads to\nthe common pairs of assertion and denial rules \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A \\lor B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A \\lor B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\lor B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$A \\land B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThis idea can easily be generalized to definitional reflection,\nyielding a reasoning system in which assertion and denial are\nintertwined. It has parallels to the deductive relations between the\nforms of judgement studied in the traditional square of opposition\n(Schroeder-Heister, 2012a; Zeilberger, 2008). It should be emphasized\nthat the denial operator is here an external sign indicating a form of\njudgement and not a logical operator. This means in particular that it\ncannot be iterated.\n\nThe idea that both assertion and denial conditions give meaning to a\nsentence and thus to logical operations also figures under the term\n\u201cbilateralism\u201d, a term coined by Rumfitt.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the proof-theoretic semantics of negation and denial see\nTranchini (2012b), Wansing (2001; 2017), as well as the special issue\non assertion and denial edited by Carrara, Chiffi and De\nFlorio (2017) and the entry on\n negation,\n the entry on\n connexive logic\n and the entry on\n contradiction.\n\nFor the idea of bilateralism see Rumfitt (2000), K\u00fcrbis (2016;\n2019), Drobyshevich (2021) and the special issue on bilateralism\nand proof-theoretic semantics edited by Sara Ayhan (2023).\n\nFor Popperianism and proof theoretic semantics see Binder et al.\n(2022), Kapsner (2014).\n3.3 Harmony and reflection in the sequent calculus\n\nGentzen\u2019s sequent calculus exhibits a symmetry between right and\nleft introduction rules which suggest to look for a harmony principle\nthat makes this symmetry significant for proof-theoretic semantics. At\nleast three lines have been pursued to deal with this phenomenon. (i)\nEither the right-introduction or or the left-introduction rules are\nconsidered to be introduction rules. The opposite rules\n(left-introductions and right-introductions, respectively) are then\njustified using the corresponding elimination rules. This means that\nthe methods discussed before are applied to whole sequents rather than\nformulas within sequents. Unlike these formulas, the sequents are not\nlogically structured. This approach builds on definitional reflection,\nwhich applies harmony and inversion to rules for arbitrarily\nstructured entities rather than for logical compounds only. It has\nbeen pursued by de Campos Sanz and Piecha (2009). (ii) The right- and\nleft-introduction rules are derived from a characterization in the\nsense of Do\u0161en\u2019s double line rules (section\n 2.4),\n which is then read as a definition of some sort. The top-down\ndirection of a double-line rule is already a right- or a\nleft-introduction rule. The other one can be derived from the\nbottom-up direction by means of certain principles. This is the basic\nmeaning-theoretic ingredient of Sambin et al.\u2019s Basic\nLogic (Sambin, Battilotti, and Faggian, 2000). (iii) The right-\nand left-introduction rules are seen as expressing an interaction\nbetween sequents using the rule of cut. Given either the right- or the\nleft-rules, the complementary rules express that everything that\ninteracts with its premisses in a certain way so does with its\nconclusion. This idea of interaction is a generalized symmetric\nprinciple of definitional reflection. It can be considered to be a\ngeneralization of the inversion principle, using the notion of\ninteraction rather than the derivability of consequences (see\nSchroeder-Heister, 2013). All three approaches apply to the sequent\ncalculus in its classical form, with possibly more than one formula in\nthe succedent of a sequent, including structurally restricted versions\nas investigated in linear and other logics. Therefore this topic\ntouches very much the issue of substructural logic and of\nsubstructural approaches to proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 3.10).\n3.4 Subatomic structure and natural language\n\nEven if, as in definitional reflection, we are considering\ndefinitional rules for atoms, their defining conditions do not\nnormally decompose these atoms. A proof-theoretic approach that takes\nthe internal structure of atomic sentences into account, has been\nproposed by Wi\u0119ckowski (2008; 2011; 2016; 2021). He uses\nintroduction and elimination rules for atomic sentences, where these\natomic sentences are not just reduced to other atomic sentences, but\nto subatomic expressions representing the meaning of predicates and\nindividual names. Apart from its foundational significance, this can\nbe seen as a first step towards natural language applications of\nproof-theoretic semantics. A further step in this direction has been\nundertaken by Francez, who developed a proof-theoretic semantics for\nseveral fragments of English (see Francez, Dyckhoff, and Ben-Avi,\n2010; Francez and Dyckhoff, 2010; Francez and Ben-Avi, 2015; Francez,\n2022). Specifically, Francez is able to use the proof-theoretic\napproach to deal with scope ambiguity and many other issues of\nsemantic meaning variation. Besides computer science, natural language\ngrammar and natural language semantics will play a key role in the\npractical application of proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the proof-theoretic semantics of natural language see\nFrancez (2015, Part II).\n3.5 Classical logic\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is intuitionistically biased. This is due to\nthe fact that natural deduction as its preferred framework has certain\nfeatures which make it particularly suited for intuitionistic logic.\nIn classical natural deduction the ex falso quodlibet\n\n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nis replaced with the rule of classical reductio ad\nabsurdum \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$[A\\to \\bot]$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$\\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nIn allowing to discharge \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\) in order to infer\n\\(A\\), this rule undermines the subformula principle.\nFurthermore, in containing both \\(\\bot\\) and \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\),\nit refers to two different logical constants in a single rule, so\nthere is no separation of logical constants any more.\nFinally, as an elimination rule for \\(\\bot\\) it does not follow the\ngeneral pattern of introductions and eliminations. As a consequence,\nit destroys the introduction form property that every closed\nderivation can be reduced to one which uses an introduction rule in\nthe last step.\n\nClassical logic fits very well with the multiple-succedent sequent\ncalculus. There we do not need any additional principles beyond those\nassumed in the intuitionistic case. Just the structural feature of\nadmitting more than one formula in the succedent suffices to obtain\nclassical logic. As there are plausible approaches to establish a\nharmony between right-introduction and left-introduction in the\nsequent calculus (see section\n 3.3),\n classical logic appears to be perfectly justified. However, this is\nonly convincing if reasoning is appropriately framed as a\nmultiple-conclusion process, even though this does not correspond to\nour standard practice where we focus on single conclusions. One could\ntry to develop an appropriate intuition by arguing that reasoning\ntowards multiple conclusions delineates the area in which truth lies\nrather than establishing a single proposition as true. However, this\nintuition is hard to maintain and cannot be formally captured without\nserious difficulties. Philosophical approaches such as those by\nShoesmith and Smiley (1978) and proof-theoretic approaches such as\nproof-nets (see Girard, 1987; the entry on\n linear logic)\n are attempts in this direction.\n\nA fundamental reason for the failure of the introduction form property\nin classical logic is the indeterminism inherent in the laws for\ndisjunction. \\(A\\lor B\\) can be inferred from \\(A\\) as well as from\n\\(B\\). Therefore, if the disjunction laws were the only way of\ninferring \\(A\\lor B\\), the derivability of \\(A\\lor \\neg A\\), which is\na key principle of classical logic, would entail that of either \\(A\\)\nor of \\(\\neg A\\), which is absurd. A way out of this difficulty is to\nabolish indeterministic disjunction and use instead its classical de\nMorgan equivalent \\(\\neg(\\neg A \\land \\neg B)\\). This leads\nessentially to a logic without proper disjunction. In the quantifier\ncase, there would be no proper existential quantifier either, as\n\\(\\exists xA\\) would be understood in the sense of \\(\\neg \\forall\nx\\neg A\\). If one is prepared to accept this restriction, then certain\nharmony principles can be formulated for classical logic.\n\nAs Karl Popper was the first to observe (see Binder et al., 2022), the\nsimple combination of rules for classical and intuitionistic\nconnectives collapses into the classical system. More sophisticated\ntheories that combine classical and intuitionistic systems in a\nfaithful way are found in ecumenical systems (see Pimentel\nand Pereira 2021). Approaches to classical logic originally developed\nin computer science by algorithmic considerations, in particular in\nthe context of proof search, are Michel Parigot\u2019s \\(\\lambda\n\\mu\\)-calculus (Parigot 1992) and the application of the focusing\nmethod to classical logic (Liang and Miller, 2009; 2023). Both\napproaches rest on the idea that by certain indexing techniques a\nsingle formula in the multiple-formula succedent of a classical\nsequent can be distinguished and dealt with individually.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor classical logic in general see the entry on\n classical logic.\n3.6 Hypothetical reasoning\n\nStandard approaches to proof-theoretic semantics, especially\nPrawitz\u2019s validity-based approach (section\n 2.2.2),\n take closed derivations as basic. The validity of open derivations is\ndefined as the transmission of validity from closed derivations of the\nassumptions to a closed derivation of the assertion, where the latter\nis obtained by substituting a closed derivation for an open\nassumption. Therefore, if one calls closed derivations\n\u2018categorical\u2019 and open derivations\n\u2018hypothetical\u2019, one may characterize this approach as\nfollowing two fundamental ideas: (I) The primacy of the categorical\nover the hypothetical, (II) the transmission view of consequence.\nThese two assumptions (I) and (II) may be viewed as dogmas of\nstandard semantics. \u201cStandard semantics\u201d here not\nonly means standard proof-theoretic semantics, but also classical\nmodel-theoretic semantics, where these dogmas are assumed as well.\nThere one starts with the definition of truth, which is the\ncategorical concept, and defines consequence, the hypothetical\nconcept, as the transmission of truth from conditions to consequent.\nFrom this point of view, constructive semantics, including\nproof-theoretic semantics, exchange the concept of truth with a\nconcept of construction or proof, and interpret\n\u201ctransmission\u201d in terms of a constructive function or\nprocedure, but otherwise leave the framework untouched.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in principle with these dogmas. However, there\nare phenomena that are difficult to deal with in the standard\nframework. Such a phenomenon is non-wellfoundedness, especially\ncircularity, where we may have consequences without transmission of\ntruth and provability (see section\n 3.8).\n Another phenomenon are substructural distinctions, where it is\ncrucial to include the structuring of assumptions from the very\nbeginning (see section\n 3.10).\n Moreover, and this is most crucial, we might define things in a\ncertain way without knowing in advance of whether our definition or\nchain of definitions is well-founded or not. We do not first involve\nourselves into the metalinguistic study of the definition we start\nwith, but would like to start to reason immediately. This problem does\nnot obtain if we restrict ourselves to the case of logical constants,\nwhere the defining rules are trivially well-founded. But the problem\narises immediately, when we consider more complicated cases that go\nbeyond logical constants.\n\nThis makes it worthwhile to proceed in the other direction and start\nwith the hypothetical concept of consequence, i.e., characterize\nconsequence directly without reducing it to the categorical case.\nPhilosophically this means that the categorical concept is a limiting\nconcept of the hypothetical one. In the classical case, truth would be\na limiting case of consequence, namely consequence without hypotheses.\nThis program is closely related to the approach of categorial proof\ntheory (see section\n 2.5),\n which is based on the primacy of hypothetical entities\n(\u201carrows\u201d). Formally, it would give preference to the\nsequent calculus over natural deduction, since the sequent calculus\nallows the manipulation of the assumption side of a sequence by means\nof left-introduction rules. In a term-annotated system, we would not\nannotate formulas, but hypothetical statements by terms. If a\nhypothetical statement is expressed by a sequent in the form \\(A\n\\vdash B\\), we would not annotate it as \\(x{:}A \\vdash t(x){:}B\\) as\nin the Curry-Howard correspondence, but in a way like \\(f{:}(A \\vdash\nB)\\). That is, the full hypothetical statement would be annotated,\nwhich makes the parallel to the categorial approach, where \\(f\\) would\nbe the arrow \\(f : A \\rightarrow B\\), obvious.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor hypothetical reasoning and intensional proof\ntheoretic semantics see Do\u0161en (2003; 2016) and\nSchroeder-Heister (2012c, 2016).\n3.7 Intensional proof-theoretic semantics\n\nAs mentioned in the first section\n (1.1),\n proof-theoretic semantics is intensional in spirit, as it is\ninterested in proofs and not just provability. For proof-theoretic\nsemantics it is not only relevant, whether \\(B\\) follows from \\(A\\),\nbut also, in which way we can establish that \\(B\\) follows from \\(A\\).\nIn other words, the identity of proofs is an important issue. However,\nthough this is prima facie obvious and proof-theoretic semanticists\nwould normally agree with this abstract claim, the practice in\nproof-theoretic semantics is often different, and the topic of the\nidentity of proofs is much neglected. It very frequently happens that\nrules which are equally powerful are identified. For example, when\nprinciples of harmony are discussed, and one considers the standard\nintroduction rule for conjunction \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$A\\land B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nmany proof-theoretic semanticists would consider it irrelevant whether\none chooses the pair of projections \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A\\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nor the pair \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A\\land B$}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nas the elimination rules for conjunction. The second pair of rules\nwould often be considered to be just a more complicated variant of the\npair of projections. However, from an intensional point of view, these\ntwo pairs of rules are not identical. Identifying them corresponds to\nidentifying \\(A \\land B\\) and \\(A \\land (A \\rightarrow B)\\), which is\nonly extensionally, but not intensionally correct. As Do\u0161en has\nfrequently argued (e.g., Do\u0161en 1997; 2006), formulas such as\n\\(A \\land B\\) and \\(A \\land(A \\rightarrow B)\\) are equivalent, but not\nisomorphic. Here \u201cisomorphic\u201d means that when proving one\nformula from the other and vice versa, we obtain, by combining these\ntwo proofs, the identity proof. This is not the case in this\nexample.\n\nPursuing this idea leads to principles of harmony and inversion which\nare different from the the standard ones. As harmony and inversion lie\nat the heart of proof-theoretic semantics, many of its issues are\ntouched. Taking the topic of intensionality seriously means reshaping\nmany fields of proof-theoretic semantics (see Schroeder-Heister,\n2022). This has repercussions in various neighbouring fields such as\nthe treatment of paradoxes. The first monograph on intensional\nproof-theoretic semantics, with particular emphasis on the topic of\nparadoxes, has been written by Tranchini (2023).\n\nSince the identity of proofs is a basic topic of categorial proof\ntheory (see section\n 2.5),\n the latter will require more attention in proof-theoretic semantics\nthan is currently the case.\n3.8. Paradoxes\n\nThe logical, mathematical and semantical paradoxes, which play a\ncrucial role in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, receive a\nnovel rendering in the framework of proof-theoretic semantics. If one\nformulates paradoxes in the context of introduction and elimination\nrules, one can apply to them the proof-theoretic machinery of\nproof-reduction. Suppose introduction and elimination rules for set\nterms are given as follows (in a kind of naive set theory):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A(t)$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$t \\in \\{x:A(x)\\}$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$t \\in \\{x:A(x)\\}$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A(t)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, for \\(r\\) as \\(\\{x: x \\not\\in x\\}\\), we can infer \\(r \\in r\\)\nfrom \\(r \\not\\in r\\) and vice versa, which is a natural deduction\nvariant of Russell\u2019s paradox. Now Prawitz (1965, Appendix B)\nobserved that the derivation of absurdity arising from Russell\u2019s\nparadox is non-normalizable, a feature that Tennant (1982) was able to\ndemonstrate for a vast range of paradoxes. From the standpoint of\nproof-theoretic semantics, a non-normalizable proof may well be\nconsidered invalid, at least not valid in the sense in which a\nnormalizable proof is valid. This means that we obtain a\nproof-theoretic criterion to tell whether we have a meaningful proof\nor not, and proofs of the paradoxes would not be meaningful in this\nsense. The Prawitz-Tennant analysis of paradoxes has opened up the\nfield of the proof-theory of paradoxes, which goes way beyond\nproof-theoretic semantics in the narrower sense. It is closely related\nto the aspect of intensionality (see section\n 3.7)\n and also to the idea of definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2\n and the\n Supplement on Definitional Reflection and Paradoxes).\n\nA particularly interesting paradox from the point of view of\nproof-theoretic semantics is Ekman\u2019s paradox. It results from\ncodifying an implicational variant of Russell\u2019s paradox in\nminimal propositional logic. It turns out that, depending on how\nreductions of detour derivations are formulated, certain derivations\nin minimal propositional logic are not normalizable. This sheds a\nstrong light on the concept of proof reduction, which is absolutely\nessential in natural-deduction style proof-theoretic semantics: much\ndepends on its careful definition. In fact, the concept of proof\nreduction constitutes the concept of proof identity and goes way\nbeyond the extensional idea that \u201cdetours\u201d in proofs are\nremoved.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor Russell\u2019s paradox in general see the entry on\n Russell\u2019s paradox.\n\nFor the treatment of paradoxes in proof-theoretic semantics,\nincluding Ekman\u2019s paradox see Tranchini (2023).\n3.9 Reduction, game theory and dialogues\n\nWhile deduction is forward-directed, passing from sentences already\nestablished to further sentences by means of justified rules,\nreduction proceeds backwards, trying to find an argument for a given\nclaim. It thus belongs to proof search. Various methods of proof\nsearch have been discovered and discussed in computer science:\nresolution and tableau systems are prominent examples. However, from a\nsemantical perspective, reductive approaches are not conceptually\nsecondary to deduction but are theories in their own right. One might\neven suggest that reductive methods are primary from the semantical\npoint of view, as the search for an argument, or the possible ways of\nsearching for it, constitute the meaning of a given claim. This idea\nhas been adopted, for example, in dialogical or game-theoretical\nsemantics, but can and should be incorporated in proof-theoretic\nsemantics in general. This is a major desideratum of proof-theoretic\nsemantics, which so far is predominantly based on deduction rather\nthan reduction.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the idea of reductive logic and its semantics see the\nmonograph by David Pym and Eike Ritter (2004).\n\nFor dialogical logic see the entry on\n dialogical logic\n as well as Thomas Piecha\u2019s entry on\n dialogical logic\n the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nFor game-theoretical approaches in logic see the entry on\n logic and games.\n3.10 Substructural approaches\n\nAs soon as one treats proof-theoretic semantics in the framework of\nthe sequent calculus and thus focuses on hypothetical rather than\ncategorical claims, the area of logics with restricted structural\nrules, called \u201csubstructural logics\u201d, demands semantical\nconsideration. Here the way assumptions are introduced and kept in\none\u2019s discourse represents a much more fine-grained structure\nthan assumptions in natural deduction, where they are normally\nconsidered to be sets of statements. Due to the possibility of\nstructuring the succedent of a sequent in an analogous way,\nproof-theoretic semantics looses its intuitionistic bias without\nnecessarily becoming classical. Within the framework of substructural\nlogic, deviant logical systems such as relevant logic or\nresource-sensitive logics can easily be modelled. A particularly\ninteresting topic is the logic of bunched implications, which\ndistinguishes different, but co-existing ways of structuring\nassumptions and conclusions (see Pym, 2002). Substructural logic is\nwell-established as a general tool to describe logical\nsystems within a single emcompassing structural framework. Whether\nsubstructural logic eo ipso represents a semantical\nframework, is still an open question.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor substructural logic in general see the entry on\n substructural logics.\n4. Conclusion and outlook\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics has practically exclusively been\noccupied with logical constants. Logical constants play a central role\nin reasoning and inference, but are definitely not the exclusive, and\nperhaps not even the most typical sort of entities that can be defined\ninferentially. A framework is needed that deals with inferential\ndefinitions in a wider sense and covers both logical and extra-logical\ninferential definitions alike. The idea of definitional reflection\nwith respect to arbitrary definitional rules (see section\n 2.3.2)\n and also natural language applications (see secton\n 3.4)\n point in this direction, but farther reaching conceptions can be\nimagined. Furthermore, the concentration on harmony, inversion\nprinciples, definitional reflection and the like is somewhat\nmisleading, as it might suggest that proof-theoretic semantics\nconsists of only that. It should be emphasized that already when it\ncomes to arithmetic, stronger principles are needed in addition to\ninversion. However, in spite of these limitations, proof-theoretic\nsemantics has already gained very substantial achievements that can\ncompete with more widespread approaches to semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor contributions on a variety of aspects of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee the reader edited by Piecha and Wehmeier (2023, open access).",
