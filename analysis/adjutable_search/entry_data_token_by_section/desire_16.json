    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || Well-being and Desires\n3.5 Well-being and Desires\n\n\nWithin normative ethics there is some interest in the notion of a\nperson's happiness, welfare, or well-being, especially within\nconsequentialist approaches to morality holding that a moral action is\none that maximizes well-being. One approach to well-being holds that a\nperson's well-being stems from the satisfaction of her\ndesires.\n\n\nA central feature of desire-based theories of well-being is that\nthey take actual states of affairs to be what is important to a\nperson's well-being, rather than the person's perceptions\nof actuality. Thus, if I desire that I win an Olympic gold medal, then\nI am only well off in this respect if I win the medal: if I get tricked\ninto believing that I have won the medal when I have not, then my\nwell-being has not been increased in the relevant respect. This might\nbe an advantage for desire-based theories of well-being (mere trickery\nseems unlikely to increase my actual well-being) or it might be a\ndisadvantage (what I do not know cannot hurt me, can it?). Discussion\nof this point is ongoing (e.g., Sumner 1996).\n\n\nA challenge for desire-based theories of well-being is that we would\nseem to have some desires the satisfaction of which would not,\nultimately, contribute to our well-being in any obvious sense. Desires\nstemming from ignorance, from neurosis, or the like might be of this\nsort. Brandt (1979) develops a well known response to these sorts of\nconcerns, arguing that the desires the satisfaction of which would\ncontribute to one's well-being are those that would survive a\nprocess of \u201ccognitive psychotherapy.\u201d\n\n\nDesire-based theories of well-being have been challenged both by\nthose who find them insufficiently attentive to the individual's\nstate of mind, especially to the pleasure enjoyed by the individual\n(e.g., Feldman 2004), and by those who find them excessively attentive\nto the individual's state of mind, to the exclusion of what is\nessential to human flourishing (e.g., Nussbaum 2000, chapter 1).\n",
