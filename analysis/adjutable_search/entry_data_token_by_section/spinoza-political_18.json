The Place of the State in Spinoza\u2019s Ontology\n\n\nIn recent years a lively discussion has emerged in the scholarly\nliterature concerning whether or not Spinoza\u2019s state is an individual\nwith its own conatus. At issue in this debate is whether Spinoza was\nmore of a collectivist or an individualist. The answer to this\nquestion is thought to carry implications for how we conceive of\nSpinoza\u2019s relationship to the liberal tradition. Some of the strongest\nevidence in support of the conception of the state as an individual\ncomes from the so-called physical digression between IIP13 and IIP14,\nwhere Spinoza directly discusses individuality. In this section,\nSpinoza tells us that an individual is a composite body whose parts\n\u201ccommunicate their motion to each other in a certain fixed\nmanner\u201d (II/100, A2, def, A3). The parts of an individual may be\nreplaced, but the individual will persist, provided that the\n\u201csame ratio of motion and rest\u201d is retained (ibid., L5,\nL4). Moreover, individuals who come together to act in a fixed way\nform larger individuals, terminating ultimately in the\nsupreme-individual: the whole of nature (II/101-102, L7). Elsewhere in\nthe Ethics, when remarking on the benefits of human\nassociations, Spinoza claims that \u201cif\u2026two individuals of\nentirely the same nature are joined to one another, they compose an\nindividual twice as powerful as each one\u201d (IVP18S). Here, once\nagain, Spinoza delineates a picture of composite, higher-order\nindividuals, opening up the possibility of viewing the state itself as\nan individual.\n\n\nAlexandre Matheron\u2019s Individu et Communaut\u00e9 chez\nSpinoza contains perhaps the most influential interpretation of\nSpinoza\u2019s account of individuality (1969, esp. Ch. 3). Matheron\nidentifies political societies as individuals, characterized by their\nown \u201cformal element,\u201d i.e., their own unique ratio of\nmotion and rest (see e.g., p. 42, 58).  Following Matheron, Etienne\nBalibar views the state as a highly composite individual, as an\n\u201cindividual of individuals, having a \u2018body\u2019\nand a \u2018soul\u2019 or mind\u201d (1998, 64), a status that he\ncalls elsewhere \u201ctransindividuality\u201d (1997). Others who\nhave espoused this view include Meinecke (1965) and Blom (2007).\n\n\nThis interpretation has been challenged in a number of ways. One\nargument against the view is that in the opening passages of TTP 17\nSpinoza, in contrast to Hobbes, claims that individuals always retain a\n\u201cconsiderable part\u201d of their own natural right; in other\nwords, human beings are never fully integrated into the\nsuper-individual, or state (Den Uyl 1983, 70). The problem with this\nobjection is that there is no reason to suppose that all individuals\nare characterized by complete integration of parts. Matheron, for\ninstance, describes the state as complex individual whose parts are\nonly integrated to a limited degree (1969, 58). Balibar, too, claims\nthat the \u201cautonomy\u201d of individuals is maintained even when\none is a part of a larger collective whole (1997, 21). It is perfectly\nconsistent to recognize the discrete individuality of humans while\nallowing that, under certain conditions of association, individuals can\nsimultaneously be members of larger units. One can be both\na collectivist and an individualist. The real\nanti-individualists are the idealists, who read Spinoza as maintaining\nthat \u201chuman individuality is illusory and untrue\u201d (Joachim\n1901, 130).\n\n\nA second objection to the view that the state is an individual is\nthat, whereas singular things can only be destroyed by external causes\n(IIIP4), \u201ca commonwealth is always in greater danger from its\ncitizens than from its enemies\u201d (e.g., TP 6/6).  If we assume\nthat all individuals are singular things (for a helpful discussion of\nthe relationship between these concepts, see D. Garrett 1994), then\nthe fact that states can ostensibly be destroyed by their parts (i.e.,\ncitizens) would be a sufficient basis for denying that they are\nindividuals (Barbone and Rice 2000, 26\u20137). This is a forceful\nobjection. However, it seems that an analysis of the apparent\nself-destruction of the commonwealth could be provided that parallels\nSpinoza\u2019s attempt to explain how suicide is possible in light of the\nconatus doctrine (EIVP20S). An apparently self-destructive state could\nbe regarded as one that is so affected by \u201chidden external\ncauses,\u201d so overwhelmed by destructive passions, that it takes\non a new nature that is contrary to its original nature (ibid.).\nSpecifically, Spinoza could explain cases of apparent civil\nself-destruction by maintaining that they occur only at the hands of\npoorly-integrated individuals who stand, at least to some degree,\noutside of the body politic. While this form of explanation is not\nwithout problems (see Bennett 1984, \u00a756), it is not obvious that\nthese problems are peculiar to collectivist interpretations of the\nstate.\n\n\nA third challenge to the collectivist interpretation is that if the\nstate is an individual, it should have a mind of its own. But Steven\nBarbone points out that references to the mind of the state are\ntypically preceded by qualifying phrases like veluti\n(\u201cas it were\u201d) and\nquasi (\u201cas if\u201d), indicating that the state has a\nmind only in a metaphorical sort of way (Barbone 2001, pp. 104\u2013105).\nThis objection might be mitigated by arguing that individuality is\nitself a matter of degree and that states are at best\n\u201cloose\u201d individuals (Della Rocca 1996, Ch. 2), with limited\ncohesion or regularity of action. This is consistent with the claim,\nnoted above, that integration into a larger union is itself a matter of\ndegree.\n\n\nUltimately, it seems to me that far less hinges on the success or\nfailure of the collectivist interpretation than has been assumed by\nits opponents. The primary concern expressed by critics like Den Uyl\nand Barbone seems to be that Spinoza not be understood as treating the\nstate as an individual with its own interests that might trump the\ninterests of its constituents. Isaiah Berlin condemned Spinoza along\nwith other positive liberty theorists precisely because he took\nSpinoza to be reifying the state and putting state interests above\nindividual interests (1969). But even if the state is an individual,\nit does not follow that its interests would supersede the interests of\nits citizens. Certainly from the perspective of a citizen, there is no\nreason why one would have to put the interests of the state above\none\u2019s own interests if these two were genuinely to come into to\nconflict. In short, the collectivist can embrace the normative primacy\nof the individual human being. If this is allowed, the matter of\nwhether the state is a literal or merely metaphorical individual seems\nto matter far less than many scholars have supposed.\n",
