Putnam\u2019s Argument Against BIV-Skepticism\n\nOn Putnam\u2019s version of the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis, the\ncontents of the universe now and always have been relatively few.\nThere have existed and now exist only brains in vats of nutrients and\nthe supercomputers that send and receive messages to and from each\nbrain. Putnam\u2019s hypothesis assumes that each human (and each\nsentient creature) that exists or has ever existed is one of the\nbrains in the vats. The supercomputers are so clever that their\nelectronic interactions with the brains result in exact duplications\nof the mental lives and histories of each person whose brain is in a\nvat. Thus I, you, indeed we (all human beings) are brains in\na vat on this hypothesis. Let us call a brain in a vat of this sort a\n\u2018BIV\u2019.\n\nPutnam\u2019s goal is to refute the skeptical argument that is based\non the BIV hypothesis, by providing a counterargument for the\nconclusion that we are not BIVs. Thus, each of us is provided with a\nway of knowing that she is not a BIV, contrary to premise (3)\nof the skeptical argument (SA) above. The crucial move in\nPutnam\u2019s argument is a sub-argument to the effect that that if\none were a BIV, one would not be able to grasp the meanings of various\ngeneral terms, such as \u2018tree\u2019, \u2018brain\u2019, and\n\u2018vat\u2019. For in order for an utterance of \u2018tree\u2019\nfor example to represent or refer to trees, Putnam maintains, there\nmust be some causal connection between uses of\n\u2018tree\u2019 and real trees (Putnam 1981 [1999: 37]). Following\nWright (1992: 71), I will call this \u2018the causal\nconstraint\u2019. A similar point, Putnam assumes, holds for the\nwords \u2018brain\u2019 and \u2018vat\u2019, as well as for mental\nutterances of, and the concepts expressed by, such words. It follows\nthat if we are BIVs, then since our uses of \u2018brain\u2019 and\n\u2018vat\u2019 do not bear the right causal relations to actual\nbrains and vats, we cannot so much as think or say\nthat we are brains in a vat (Putnam 1981 [1999: 31]).\n\nPutnam goes on to suggest that while a BIV cannot think or say that\nshe is a brain in a vat, her utterances of \u2018BIV\u2019 could\nrefer to something else. For instance, the utterances could\nrefer to (i) BIVs-in-the-image. That is, the utterances could refer to\nthe succession of experiences as of being a BIV. In this case, the\nBIV\u2019s utterance would just be false, since the computer\nprogram would never allow her to have perceptual experiences as of\nbeing an envatted brain as opposed to being an embodied person. (Of\ncourse, a BIV could only seem to be uttering words. So we\nshould just identify her utterances with her mental\n\u2018seemings\u2019 to utter. See Putnam 1981 [1999: 31].)\n\nIn addition to \u2018brain-in-a-vat-in-the-image\u2019, Putnam\nsuggests (1981 [1999: 36]) two other possible sorts of things that\n\u2018brain in a vat\u2019 might refer to for a BIV. It might also\nrefer to (ii) the electronic impulses that cause experiences as of\nbeing a BIV or perhaps to (iii) features of the computer program that\ncause those electronic impulses. I will use the expressions\n\u2018brain* in a vat*\u2019 and \u2018BIV*\u2019 to provide a\nschematic representation of whichever of these three possible meanings\nof \u2018BIV\u2019 in vat-English is correct, or if none is correct,\n\u2018brain* in a vat*\u2019 and \u2018BIV*\u2019 represent the\nmeaning of \u2018BIV\u2019 in vat-English, whatever it is.\n\nThe important fact for Putnam\u2019s argument is that whichever of\nthese possible meanings is had in vat-English by \u2018I am a brain\nin a vat\u2019, that sentence, as used by a BIV, will be\nfalse. We saw that in sense (i), \u2018I am a brain in a\nvat\u2019 would be false in vat-English, since a BIV would never have\n(perceptual) experiences as of being a BIV. Putnam does not explain\nwhy \u2018I am a brain in a vat\u2019 would be false in both senses\n(ii) and (iii). Brueckner (2016: 4) suggests that since in sense (iii)\nboth \u2018brain\u2019 and \u2018vat\u2019 would refer to certain\ncomputer program features, a BIV would not be a BIV in sense (iii): no\nBIV would be a certain computer program feature that is \u201clocated\nin\u201d a certain other computer program feature. A similar point\nwould hold for sense (ii). From these considerations, Putnam then\nconcludes: \u201cIn short, if we are brains in a vat, then \u2018we\nare brains in a vat\u2019 is false. So it is (necessarily)\nfalse\u201d (Putnam 1981 [1999: 37]). Here, Putnam seems to think\nthat he has shown the conclusion that he was aiming to show, namely,\nthat we are not brains in a vat. But in fact, the most he has\nshown so far is that a BIV\u2019s utterance of \u2018We are not\nbrains in a vat\u2019 would be true. But this conclusion is simply\nirrelevant to Putnam\u2019s goal, since as Putnam himself points out,\nthe BIV\u2019s utterance does not mean that we are not BIVs\n(see Brueckner 1986: 152 and Forbes 1995 [1999: 63]).\n",
