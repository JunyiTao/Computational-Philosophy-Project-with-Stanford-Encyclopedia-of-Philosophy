    "main_text": "Meditation || Inner Gods\n9.1 Inner Gods\n\nAccording to Daoist traditions documented from around 200 CE, the\nhuman being hosts a veritable pantheon of gods. These deities perform\nmultiple roles related to one another: they allow the human being to\ncommunicate with the corresponding gods of the celestial pantheon,\nserve as administrators of the human body, and guard the balance of\nthe body\u2019s main functions.\n\nSeveral texts describe the features of the inner gods. One of the main\nsources, the Huangting jing (Book of the Yellow Court; ca.\n200 CE; Robinet 1993: 55\u201396; Despeux 2012: 128\u201349),\nmentions, for instance, a major series of gods that live within the\nfive viscera. Significantly, each of these organs is called a\n\u201cdepartment\u201d (bu), the same term that denotes a\ngovernment \u201cministry\u201d, and each of these gods is said to\nreside in a \u201cpalace\u201d. These and other details, such as\nnames, appearances, dimensions, and garments of the gods, are\nmentioned as supports for meditation practices. In agreement with the\nclassical Chinese views on the fateful separation of the spirit\n(shen) from the body, several works warn that if the inner\ngods (also called shen) leave their residences, a person dies.\n\u201cMaintaining one\u2019s thoughts\u201d (cun) on them\nenables one to keep them in their corporeal dwellings.\n\nThese deities are not deemed to possess physical existence in the\nordinary sense of the word. They pertain, instead, to a domain that\nlies midway between formlessness and form; as noticed by Isabelle\nRobinet, they are \u201cimages\u201d (xiang) that play an\nintermediary function \u201cbetween the world of sensory realities\nand the world of the unknowable\u201d (1993: 50). The person in whom\nthe gods reside is neither possessed by them nor is\n\u201cdeified\u201d by their presence (for a different view, see\nPuett 2002:\n226\u201327). The practitioner, instead, becomes the focus of a\ndivine representation, of which he is the lone creator and the lone\nspectator. The organs and loci in which the gods reside cease to be\nmere \u201cbody parts\u201d, and become the supports that make that\nrepresentation possible.\n\nThe inner gods are literally innumerable and different texts describe\ndifferent pantheons (Pregadio 2005: 131\u201341), but here only the\nmost important one can be mentioned. Known as the Red Child (Chizi),\nhe is featured in the Laozi zhongjing (Central Book of Laozi;\nprobably ca. 200 CE; Schipper 1993: 100\u201312; Schipper 1995;\nLagerwey 2004a). The speaker of this text is Laozi; in fact, the Red\nChild is no other than Laozi himself, now playing the role of\n\u201ctrue self\u201d (zhenwu) of each human being. He\ndefines himself as \u201cthe child of the Dao\u201d, adding that he\nresides in the stomach (another symbolic center of the person) where\nhe is nourished by his mother and protected by his father. Like other\ninner gods, however, the Child should also be nourished by the person\nin whom he lives: in particular, a \u201cyellow essence\u201d\n(huangjing) and a \u201cred breath\u201d (chiqi),\nrespectively associated with the Moon (Yin) and the Sun\n(Yang), should be delivered to him by the adept in\nmeditation.\n\nAs an image of the \u201ctrue self\u201d, the Red Child is the main\nprecursor of the \u201cembryo\u201d that, several centuries later,\nadepts of Neidan would generate and nourish by means of their own\npractices\n (\u00a710.3).\n",
