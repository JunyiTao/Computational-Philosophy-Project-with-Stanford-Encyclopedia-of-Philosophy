    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 Place in Greek Neoplatonism || Iamblichus\u2019 posterity\n2.4 Iamblichus\u2019 posterity\n\nIamblichus\u2019 philosophical stance is connected to some views\nwhich separate him from Plotinus and Porphyry and lay the ground for\nlater Neoplatonism, in particular that of Proclus and of the so-called\nAthenian school of the fifth and sixth century AD. These views\nconcern: the status of embodied souls (according to Iamblichus there\nis no superior part of our soul which resides in intelligible being);\nthe role of religious acts revealed by the gods to enable the\nsoul\u2019s ascension to the intelligible realm (as already noted,\nfor Iamblichus, philosophical and intellectual contemplation alone are\nnot sufficient and theurgy is necessary); a harmonising account of the\nvarious theological traditions and the privileged role assigned to\nPythagoras and to the Chaldaean Oracles; an account of\nprinciples and of the metaphysical hierarchy which, while based on\nPlotinus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s doctrines, includes more degrees\nand intermediate levels; and, finally, a tendency towards\nscholasticism and the systematization of exegetical methods.\n\nA picture of Late Antique philosophy jumping from Iamblichus to\nProclus would however be misleading. Actually, more than one century\nseparates Iamblichus\u2019 death from the foundation of the\nNeoplatonist school at Athens by Plutarch of Athens. Some crucial\ndetails escape us: for example, we don\u2019t even know how and when\nIamblichus\u2019 teaching entered the philosophical schools in Athens\n(Goulet 2012). In addition to this, Iamblichus\u2019 posterity in the\nfourth century does not suggest that his philosophical approach was\nimmediately and unanimously followed. Praechter (1910) regarded those\ndisciples of Iamblichus\u2019 who settled in Pergamon, gathering\naround Iamblichus\u2019 student Aedesius, as forming a school (the\n\u201cschool of Pergamon\u201d), where rational methods were\nabandoned in favor of theurgy and religious practices. In addition,\nthese philosophers are sometimes regarded as forming an ideologically\nengaged Pagan group threatened by Christian persecution after\nConstantine. Such views are somewhat oversimplistic. Our main source\nfor reconstructing this phase of Neoplatonism is Eunapius\u2019\nLives of Philosophers and Sophists (Goulet 2014). As already\nnoted, Eunapius is a tendentious source, with his own hagiographical\nagenda and with little taste for philosophical technicalities.\nWhatever we make of this, he says that Iamblichus\u2019 students\nformed a large crowd and that those who were eager to learn flocked to\nhim from all parts (see Eunapius Lives VI, 4 [Goulet 2014:\n12\u201314]). This and other passages suggest that Pagan\nphilosophical teaching definitely did not go underground under and\nafter Constantine (the elite of the Roman Empire was still largely\nPagan at that time). Eunapius\u2019 list of Iamblichus\u2019\nstudents confirms the echo of his teaching: the list includes Sopater\nthe Syrian (see above,\n Section 1.1),\n Aedesius, Eustathius from Cappadocia, Theodorus, and Euphrasius (see\nEunapius Lives V, 5 [Goulet 2014: 12.14\u201320]). Among\nthese, Theodorus is likely to coincide with Theodorus of Asine who,\nwhile being a student of Iamblichus, is said to have held different\nphilosophical views and reverted to an intellectualist Platonism of\nthe Plotinian sort. Aedesius\u2019 school too certainly hosted\ndifferent positions and internal debates. Thus Eusebius of Myndus was\na member of that school, but apparently held an attitude closer to\nthat of Plotinus and he was inclined to reject theurgical and magical\npractices. On the other hand, theurgy was adopted by Aedesius\u2019\nIamblichean disciples such as Chrysanthius of Sardis, Maximus of\nEphesus, and Priscus of Thesprotia. Maximus and Priscus were\ncharismatic figures who are mainly known as masters and counsellors of\nthe Emperor Julian (Julian studied philosophy at Pergamon around 350).\nIamblichus\u2019 teaching actually forms the philosophical background\nof Julian\u2019s project of restoration of Paganism, as shown by\nJulian\u2019s own writings (see De Vita 2011) and by the short\ntreatise On the Gods and the Cosmos by one Salustius\n(possibly Saturninius Secundus Salutius, a dignitary at Julian\u2019s\ncourt). It is worth noting, however, that even committed theurgists\nlike Maximus did not abandon rational methods (we know about\nMaximus\u2019 work on Aristotle\u2019s Categories and\nPrior Analytics).\n\nIn addition to internal debates among Iamblichus\u2019 disciples,\nfourth-century philosophy includes an overtly anti-Iamblichean trend.\nThis is the case with Themistius (orator, commentator of Aristotle and\nauthoritative member of the Senate in Constantinople), who did not\nendorse Iamblichus\u2019 philosophy and did not show any sympathy for\nhis theurgic and Pythagorean teaching. He actually sharply criticizes\nthe new philosophical approach represented by the \u201cman of\nChalcis\u201d (an allusion to Iamblichus: see Themistius,\nOr. 23, 295b). Themistius engaged in a controversy with\nMaximus of Ephesus over Aristotle\u2019s logic in Constantinople,\nwhere Julian acted as arbiter (Ammonius, In Analytica Priora,\np. 31.11\u201323). Furthermore, Themistius regarded the Pythagorean\nArchytas\u2019 treatise on the categories as spurious and argued that\nthe author was not a Pythagorean at all (Boethius, In\nCategorias, PL 64, 162 A). By doing so Themistius actually\nremoved the main support for Iamblichus\u2019 Pythagorean and\nmetaphysical reading of Aristotle. Iamblichus\u2019 philosophy, then,\nwas only gradually accepted and it was regarded with both consensus\nand disagreement in its immediate posterity. Certainly,\nIamblichus\u2019 philosophical approach did not entail any\nabandonment of rational methods, not even among those who\nenthusiastically embraced theurgy.\n",
