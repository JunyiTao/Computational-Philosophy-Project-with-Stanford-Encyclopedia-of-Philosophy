    "main_text": "Normalization || Normalization in Classical Logic\n5.4 Normalization in Classical Logic\n\nTypically, natural deduction systems for classical logic are\nformulated by adding an extra, classicizing, rule to a natural\ndeduction system for intuitionistic logic: any of a variety of\npossible rules can be\n added.[23]\n The immediate and permutative reductions are possible in derivations\nin classical natural deduction, but there is another case to consider:\na logically complex formula might be concluded by the classicizing\nrule and then used as the major premiss of an elimination rule. This\nformula might be more complex than the final conclusion or any of the\npremises of the derivation, in which case its use would intuitively\nseem just as much a \u201cdetour\u201d as those eliminated by the\nnormalization of an intuitionistic derivation. Worse, if we allowed\nsuch detours, we would lose the \u201ccontrol\u201d over the\ncomplexity of derivations necessary for technical applications of the\nnormalization theorem. So a normal derivation, in natural deduction\nfor classical logic, should be defined as one in which no conclusion\nof an introduction rule is used as the major premiss of an elimination\nrule (as before) and in which no formula obtained by the classicizing\nrule is used as the major premiss of an elimination rule. Gentzen\nappears to have thought that no reduction process was possible which\nwould allow arbitrary derivations in the classical system to be\ntransformed into this kind of normal derivation. (It is possible that\nthe particular classicizing rule he envisaged (see\n note 23)\n makes this harder than other formulations would.)\n\nPrawitz (1965) proved a normalization theorem for a system of\nclassical natural deduction with a reduced set of logical operators.\n(The operators, \\(\\lor\\) and \\(\\exists\\), that he omitted can be\ndefined, in classical logic, in terms of the others, so\nPrawitz\u2019s result is strong enough for some applications.)\nSeveral later writers proved normalization results for classical logic\nwith all the usual operators, but under various restrictions. It thus\ncame as a surprise to the logical community when von Plato and Siders\n(2012) were able to give a very simple proof of a fully general\nnormalization theorem for a system of classical logic including all\nthe usual operators.\n\nFor the normalization result of von Plato and Siders, we will choose,\nas our classicizing rule, the principle of Indirect Proof: a formula,\n\\(A\\), may be asserted after a subproof, with hypothesis \\(\\neg A\\),\nhaving a pair of contradictory formulas, \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\), as\nitems. The possibility of normalization then depends on our being able\nto modify derivations to eliminate cases where a formula, \\(C\\), is\nobtained by Indirect Proof and is then used as the (major) premiss of\nan elimination rule to obtain another formula, \\(D\\): we might call\nmanoeuvres like this in a derivation \u201cclassicizing\ndetours\u201d. This is illustrated in\n figure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Example of Classical\nReduction. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\n(Depending on details, further reductions may be needed within the new\nsubproof.) To avoid such detours, we instead use indirect proof to\nobtain \\(D\\). This fix, a classicizing reduction, is analogous to the\npermutative reductions discussed above. The new indirect proof\nsubproof will have \\(\\neg D\\) as its hypothesis; since \\(D\\) is\nimmediately derivable (by an elimination rule!) from \\(C\\), we can use\n\\(\\neg\\)-Int to infer \\(\\neg C\\), after which the argumentation of the\noriginal subproof will yield a contradiction.\n\nIn normalizing an entire derivation, we can start by attacking the\nmost deeply embedded classicizing detours (those in whose (original)\nindirect proof subproofs no further classicizing detours occur) and\nworking outward. Combining this with applications of the earlier\nreductions, it is not hard to see that the entire derivation can be\nconverted into one in normal form. Normal derivations in classical\nlogic have only the weak (but still useful!) subformula property\nmentioned in\n \u00a75.3\n in connection with Nelson\u2019s variant of intuitionistic\nlogic.\n\nGiven the simplicity of von Plato and Siders\u2019s technique, it is\nsomewhat surprising that it took so long to discover a method of\nnormalizing natural deduction. Perhaps the barrier was psychological:\nthe intuitively obvious part of the Gentzen/Prawitz normalization of\nintuitionistic logic is in the immediate reductions, the permutative\nreductions in contrast being perceived as annoying technical details\nneeded for a few rules. So perhaps logicians didn\u2019t find it\nnatural to use permutative-style reductions more generally. In this\nconnection, it is perhaps significant that von Plato (2001) had worked\nwith systems having what are called general elimination\nrules. Here the other elimination rules are replaced by rules more in\nthe spirit of \\(\\lor\\)-E: the conclusion, which need not be an\nimmediate subformula of the (major) premise, is derived in a subproof\nhaving hypotheses sufficient for obtaining that premise by the\ncorresponding Introduction rule, and is taken to be established in the\nmain proof by the existence of the subproof. This was of course not a\nlogically necessary prerequisite\u2014normalization holds\nboth for classical natural deduction with general rules and, as we\nhave seen, for a more standard formulation of classical natural\ndeduction\u2014but psychologically it may have made it easy to see\nhow the problem could be solved.\n\nThe normalization proofs described, turning on applications of the\nvarious reductions in a certain order, are moderately complicated in\ndetail, but conceptually elementary: they (like Gentzen\u2019s 1934\nproof of the Hauptsatz for sequent calculi) are finitistic in\nthe sense of the Hilbert program. (The corollaries Gentzen derives\nfrom the Hauptsatz in the last section of Gentzen (1934),\nthough published after G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem, can\nthus be seen as among the successes of Hilbert\u2019s program.)\n\nThe theorems described, depending as they do on the order of\napplication of the reductions, are sometimes called weak normalization\ntheorems. There are also strong normalization theorems, to the effect\nthat any derivation can be converted into one in normal form by\napplication of the reductions in arbitrary order (Prawitz 1971). Their\nproof is necessarily less elementary. The theorems, and the methods\nused in their proof, are analogous to what is called\n\u201cnormalizability\u201d theorems in the context of the\nlambda-calculus (detailed discussions can be found in, e.g., Troelstra\n& Schwichtenberg 1996). There are also weaker theorems, called\nnormal form theorems, stating that for any derivation there\nis a derivation in normal form of the same conclusion from the same\npremises, without saying anything about a procedure for converting a\nnon-normal derivation into a normal one. Such theorems can be proven,\ne.g., semantically, by proving the completeness of a system restricted\nto normal derivations.\n",
