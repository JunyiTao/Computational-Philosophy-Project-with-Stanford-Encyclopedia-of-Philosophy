    "main_text": "Interpreting the formalism\n4. Interpreting the formalism\n\nThe main formal notions of the RTT are the notion of a revision\nrule (Definition 3.2), i.e., a rule for revising hypotheses; and\na revision sequence (Definition 3.7), a sequence of\nhypotheses generated in accordance with the appropriate revision rule.\nUsing these notions, we can, given a ground model, specify when a\nsentence is stably (or nearly stably) true or\nstably (or nearly stably) false (Definition 3.6 and\n3.10, respectively) in a particular revision sequence. Thus we could\ndefine two theories of truth, \\(\\boldsymbol{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{T}^{\\#}\\) (Definition 3.11), based on stability and near\nstability (respectively). The final idea is that each of these\ntheories delivers a verdict on which sentences of the language are\nvalid (Definition 3.11), given a ground model.\n\nRecall the suggestions made at the end of Section 2:\n\nIn a semantics for languages capable of expressing their own truth\nconcepts, \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\) will not, in general, have a classical\nsignification; and the \u2018iff\u2019 in the T-biconditionals will\nnot be read as the classical biconditional.\n\n\nGupta and Belnap fill out these suggestions in the following way.\n",
