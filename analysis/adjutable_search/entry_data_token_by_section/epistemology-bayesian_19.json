    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors || Subjective Bayesianism\n4.1 Subjective Bayesianism\n\nSubjective Bayesianism is the view that every prior is permitted\nunless it fails to be coherent (de Finetti 1970 [1974]; Savage 1972;\nJeffrey 1965; van Fraassen 1989: ch. 7). Holding that view as the\ncommon ground, subjective Bayesians often disagree over what coherence\nrequires (which was the topic of the preceding\n section 3).\n\nThe most common worry for subjective Bayesianism is that, on that\nview, anything goes. For example, under just Probabilism and\nRegularity, there is a prior that follows enumerative induction and\nthere also is a prior whose posterior never generalizes from data,\ndefying enumerative induction (see Carnap 1955 for details, but see\nFitelson 2006 for a concise presentation). Under just Probabilism and\nthe Principal Principle, there is a prior that follows Ockham\u2019s\nrazor in statistical model selection but there also is a prior that\ndoes not (Forster 1995: sec. 3; Sober 2002: sec.\n 6).[7]\n So, although subjective Bayesianism does not really say that anything\ngoes, it seems to permit too much, failing to account for some\nimportant aspects of scientific objectivity\u2014or so the worry\ngoes. Subjective Bayesians have replied with at least two\nstrategies.\n\nHere is one: argue that, despite appearances, coherence alone captures\neverything there is to scientific objectivity. For example, it might\nbe argued that it is actually correct to permit a wide range of\npriors, for people come with different background opinions and it\nseems wrong\u2014objectively wrong\u2014to require all of them to\nchange to the same opinion at once. What ought to be the case is,\nrather, that people\u2019s opinions be brought closer and closer to\neach other as their shared evidence accumulates. This idea of\nmerging-of-opinions as a kind of scientific objectivity can\nbe traced back to Peirce (1877), although he develops this idea for\nthe epistemology of all-or-nothing beliefs rather than credences. Some\nsubjective Bayesians propose to develop this Peircean idea in the\nframework of subjective Bayesianism: to have the ideal of\nmerging-of-opinions be derived as a norm\u2014derived solely from\ncoherence norms. That is, they prove so-called merging-of-opinions\ntheorems (Blackwell & Dubins 1962; Gaifman & Snir 1982).\nSuch a theorem states that, under such and such contingent initial\nconditions together with such and such coherence norms, two agents\nmust be certain that their credences in the hypotheses under\nconsideration will merge with each other in the long run as\nthe shared evidence accumulates indefinitely.\n\nThe above theorem is stated with two italicized parts, which are the\ntargets of some worries. The merging of the two agents\u2019 opinions\nmight not happen and is only believed with certainty to happen in the\nlong run. And the long run might be too long. There is another worry:\nthe proof of such a theorem requires Countable Additivity as a norm of\ncredences, which is controversial, as was discussed in\n section 3.2.\n See Earman (1992: ch. 6) for more on those\n worries.[8]\n For a recent development of merging-of-opinions theorems and a\ndefense of their use, see Huttegger (2015).\n\nWhether or not merging-of-opinions theorems can capture the intended\nkind of scientific objectivity, it is still debated whether there are\nother kinds of scientific objectivity that elude subjective\nBayesianism. For more on this issue, see\n section 4.2 of the entry on scientific objectivity,\n Gelman & Hennig (2017) (including peer discussions), Sprenger\n(2018), and Sprenger & Hartmann (2019: ch. 11).\n\nHere is a second strategy in defense of scientific objectivity for\nsubjective Bayesians: distance themselves from any substantive theory\nof inductive inference and hold instead that Bayesian epistemology can\nbe construed as a kind of deductive logic. This view draws on some\nparallel features between deductive logic and Bayesian epistemology.\nFirst, the coherence of credences can be construed as an analogue of\nthe logical consistency of propositions or all-or-nothing beliefs\n(Jeffrey 1983). Second, just as premises are inputs into a deductive\nreasoning process, prior credences are inputs into the process of an\ninquiry. And, just as the job of deductive logic is not to say what\npremises we should have except that they be logically consistent,\nBayesian epistemology need not say what prior credences we should have\nexcept that they be coherent (Howson 2000: 135\u2013145). Call this\nview the deductive construal of Bayesian epistemology, for\nlack of a standard name.\n\nYet it might be questioned whether the above parallelism really works\nin favor of subjective Bayesianism. Just as substantive theories of\ninductive inferences have been developed with deductive logic as their\nbasis, to take the parallelism seriously it seems that there should\nalso be a substantive account of inductive inferences with the\ndeductive construal of Bayesian epistemology as their basis. Indeed,\nthe anti-subjectivists to be discussed below\u2014objective Bayesians\nand forward-looking Bayesians\u2014all think that a substantive\naccount of inductive inferences is furnished by norms that go beyond\nthe consideration of coherence. It is to such a view that I turn now.\nBut for more on subjective Bayesianism, see the survey by Joyce\n(2011).\n\n",
