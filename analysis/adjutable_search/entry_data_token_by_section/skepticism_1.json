    "main_text": "Two Basic Forms of Philosophical Skepticism\n2. Two Basic Forms of Philosophical Skepticism\n\nOne interesting distinction between kinds of philosophical skepticism\npertains to the question whether they iterate. Thus, consider\nskepticism about the future: the claim that the only justified\nattitude with respect to propositions about the future is suspension\nof judgment. That kind of philosophical skepticism overlaps partly\nwith ordinary skepticism about the future. We should all grant, for\ninstance, that we should suspend judgment with respect to the\nproposition that the flip of this fair coin in the next second will\ncome up heads, but most of us think that we should believe, not\nsuspend judgment with respect to, the proposition that the sun will\ncome out tomorrow. Being a skeptic with respect to the first-order\nproposition that the sun will come out tomorrow (that is to say,\nholding that the only justified attitude with respect to that\nproposition is suspension of judgment) can be combined with any of the\nthree doxastic attitudes with respect to the second-order proposition\nthat the only justified attitude with respect to the proposition that\nthe sun will come out tomorrow is to suspend judgment. Generalizing,\nwhenever the skeptic holds that the only justified attitude with\nrespect to a field of propositions F is to suspend judgment, we\ncan ask them which attitude is justified with respect to the\nproposition that the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition in F is suspension of judgment. Perhaps the most\nstraightforward answer here is that the only justified attitude with\nrespect to that second-order proposition is belief. After all,\nisn\u2019t skepticism with respect to F precisely the\nbelief that we should suspend judgment with respect to any proposition\nin F? We will call this combination of views\u2014the view\nthat we should suspend judgment with respect to any proposition in\nF and believe the proposition that we should suspend judgment\nwith respect to any proposition in F\u2014\u201cCartesian\nSkepticism\u201d, because of the skeptical arguments investigated by\nDescartes and his critics in the mid-seventeenth century. Other\nphilosophers, following an ancient tradition, refer to this view as\n\u201cAcademic Skepticism\u201d (see the entry on\n ancient skepticism).\n\nBut some skeptics are skeptics regarding second- (and higher-) order\npropositions as well as regarding first-order propositions. Following\nthe same ancient tradition, we will call that kind of skepticism\n\u201cPyrrhonian Skepticism\u201d. Without any claim to historical\naccuracy, we will take Pyrrhonian Skepticism to be absolute\nskepticism\u2014the thesis that suspension of judgment is the only\njustified attitude with respect to any proposition p.\nIs Pyrrhonian Skepticism so understood self-refuting? It is certainly\nformally consistent: no contradiction follows just from the\npropositions that the only justified attitude with respect to the\nproposition that p is suspension of judgment and that the only\njustified attitude with respect to the proposition that the only\njustified attitude with respect to the proposition that p is\nsuspension of judgment is suspension of judgment (say that three times\nfast!). But consider the principle that whenever someone is committed\nto a proposition p they are also (perhaps implicitly) committed\nto the proposition that belief is the (or at least a) justified\nattitude towards p. Call this the \u201cCommitment Iteration\nPrinciple\u201d. If the Commitment Iteration Principle holds, then\nPyrrhonian Skepticism is indeed self-refuting. For Pyrrhonian skeptics\nare committed to the claim that suspension of judgment is the only\njustified attitude with respect to some proposition p. By the\nCommitment Iteration Principle, they are then committed to the claim\nthat belief is a justified attitude with respect to the proposition\nthat suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude with\nrespect to p. Therefore, if they are in addition committed to\nthe claim that suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude\nwith respect to that very same proposition, they are committed to an\ninconsistent set of propositions. But Pyrrhonian skeptics need not\nhold the Commitment Iteration Principle. Indeed, they are committed to\nthinking that suspension of judgment is the only justified attitude\nwith respect to the Commitment Iteration Principle itself (and also\nwith respect to analogous principles which may make trouble for\nPyrrhonian Skepticism). Of course, Pyrrhonian Skepticism will not be\nacceptable to anyone who does hold the Commitment Iteration\nPrinciple\u2014but neither will Pyrrhonian Skepticism be acceptable\nto anyone who holds that we should not suspend judgment with respect\nto some proposition. It is not clear, then, that the charge of\nself-refutation represents an independent indictment of Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism. In any case, contemporary philosophers find Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism interesting not because they take seriously the possibility\nof its truth, but rather because there are interesting arguments in\nits favor, the responses to which shape the contours of many\ncontemporary epistemological theories.\n\nWe have distinguished between Cartesian and Pyrrhonian Skepticism, but\nwe have characterized both views in terms of a generic field of\npropositions F. In the case of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, F\nincludes every proposition, but we can generate different versions of\nCartesian Skepticism by varying F. A prominent version of\nCartesian Skepticism is external-world skepticism\u2014i.e.,\nCartesian Skepticism with respect to any proposition about the\n\u201cexternal world\u201d (not about the subject\u2019s own\n mind).[4]\n In what follows, we concentrate on external world Cartesian\nSkepticism and Pyrrhonian Skepticism.\n",
