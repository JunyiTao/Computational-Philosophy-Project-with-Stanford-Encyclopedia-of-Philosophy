On Method: Ordinary Language\n\nIf Cook Wilson\u2019s reverence towards ordinary language derived\nfrom his training as a philologist, it was not limited to occasional\nreferences to instances of usage to buttress his arguments. He\nbelieved that in philosophy one must above all \u201cuncompromisingly\n[\u2026] try to find out what a given activity of thought\npresupposes as implicit or explicit in our consciousness\u201d, i.e.,\nto \u201ctry to get at the facts of consciousness and not let them be\noverlaid as is so commonly done with preconceived theories\u201d (SI,\n328). He also spoke of the latter as originating in \u2018reflective\nthought\u2019 and argued it has two major defects. First, it is based\non principles that, for all we know, might be false and,\nconcomitantly, it is too abstract, because it is not based on the\nconsideration of particular concrete examples. Indeed, in a passage\nwhere he criticized Bradley\u2019s regress arguments against the\nreality of relations (Bradley 1897, chap. III), Cook Wilson begins by\npointing out that \u201cthroughout this chapter there is not a single\nillustration, though it is of the last importance that there should\nbe\u201d (SI, 692). (On this critique of Bradley, see also Joseph\n(1916a, 37).) This is, however, slightly misleading, given that\nBradley opens his discussion in his previous chapter, where a first\nregress is deployed, with the case of a lump of sugar (Bradley 1897,\n16).) As H. H. Price put it later, for Cook Wilson and his epigones\n\u201cto philosophize without instances would be merely a waste of\ntime\u201d (Price 1947, 336).\n\nSecondly, Cook Wilson thought that philosophers are most likely to\nintroduce distinctions of their own that do not correspond to the\n\u2018facts of consciousness\u2019 and thus distort our\nunderstanding of them. He therefore strove to uncover these\n\u2018facts of consciousness\u2019 through an analysis of concrete\nexamples which would be free of philosophical jargon. This is strongly\nreminiscent of the \u2018descriptive psychology\u2019 of the\nBrentano School. As a matter of fact, Gilbert Ryle, who described\nhimself as a \u201cfidgetty Cook Wilsonian\u201d in his youth (Ryle\n1993, 106) and who was also probably the only Oxonian who knew\nsomething about phenomenology in the 1920s, believed Cook\nWilson\u2019s descriptive analyses to be as good as any from Husserl\n(Ryle 1971, vol. I, 176 & 203n.).\n\nIn what may be deemed a variant of the \u2018linguistic turn\u2019,\nCook Wilson believed that an examination of the \u201cverbal\nform of statement\u201d was needed in order \u201cto see what light\nthe form of expression might throw upon problems about the mental\nstate\u201d (SI, 90), thus that ordinary language would be the guide\nto the \u2018facts of consciousness\u2019, because it embodies\nphilosophically relevant distinctions:\n\nIt is not fair to condemn the ordinary view wholly, nor is it safe:\nfor, if we do, we may lose sight of something important behind it.\nDistinctions in current language can never safely be neglected. (SI,\n46)\n\n\nThe authority of language is too often forgotten in philosophy, with\nserious results. Distinctions made or applied in ordinary language are\nmore likely to be right than wrong. Developed, as they have been, in\nwhat may be called the natural course of thinking, under the influence\nof experience and in the apprehension of particular truths, whether of\neveryday life or of science, they are not due to any preconceived\ntheory. In this way the grammatical forms themselves have arisen; they\nare not the issue of any system, they are not invented by any one.\nThey have been developed unconsciously in accordance with distinctions\nwhich we come to apprehend in our experience. (SI, 874)\n\n\nReflective thought tends to be too abstract, while experience which\nhas developed the popular distinctions recorded in language is always\nin contact with the particular facts. (SI, 875)\n\n\nFor this reason, Cook Wilson considered it \u201crepugnant to create\na technical term out of all relation to ordinary language\u201d (SI,\n713) and SI is replete with appeals to ordinary language. For example,\nhe argued in support of his views on universals that \u201cordinary\nlanguage reflects faithfully a true metaphysics of universals\u201d\n(SI (208), see section 7). But such appeals were not just meant to\nundermine \u2018preconceived theories\u2019, they were also\nconstructive, e.g., when he distinguished between the activity of\nthinking and \u2018what we think\u2019, i.e., between\n\u2018act\u2019 and \u2018content\u2019 (SI, 63\u201364), arguing\nthat this is \u201clikely to be right\u201d because \u201cit is the\nnatural and universal mode of expression in ordinary untechnical\nlanguage, ancient and modern\u201d (SI, 67) and \u201cit comes from\nthe very way of speaking which is natural and habitual with those who\ndo not believe in any form of idealism\u201d (SI, 64). As it turns\nout, Cook Wilson believed that the \u2018content\u2019, i.e.,\n\u2018what we think\u2019 is not about the thing we think\nabout, but the thing itself (so knowledge contains its object, see\nsection 6). \n\nThese views were to prove particularly influential in the case of J.\nL. Austin, who began his studies at Oxford four years after the\npublication of SI. It is a common mistake to think of Wittgenstein as\nhaving had some formative influence on Austin, as he was arguably the\nleast influenced by Wittgenstein of the Oxford philosophers (Hacker\n1996, 172). (On this point see also Marion (2011), for the contrary\nclaim, Harris & Unnsteinsson (2018).) At any rate, the evidence\nadduced here and elsewhere since Marion (2000) ought not to be ignored\nand, the philosophy of G. E. Moore notwithstanding, it is rather Cook\nWilson and epigones such as Prichard that are the source of the\npeculiar brand of \u2018analytical philosophy\u2019 that was to take\nroot in Oxford in the 1930s, known as \u2018Oxford philosophy\u2019\nor \u2018ordinary language philosophy\u2019. One merely needs here\nto recall the following well-known passage from Austin\u2019s\n\u2018A Plea for Excuses\u2019, which is almost a paraphrase of Cook\nWilson:\n\nOur common stock of words embodies all the distinctions men have found\nworth drawing, and the connections they have found worth marking, in\nthe lifetimes of many generations: these surely are likely to be more\nnumerous, more sound, since they have stood up to the long test of the\nsurvival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in all ordinary and\nreasonably practical matters, than any that you or I are likely to\nthink up in our arm-chairs of an afternoon\u2014the most favoured\nalternative method. (Austin 1979, 182)\n\n\nNeither Cook Wilson nor Austin believed, however, that ordinary\nlanguage was not open to improvements. Cook Wilson was explicit about\nthis when detailing his procedure:\n\n\nObviously we must start from the facts of the use of a name, and shall\nbe guided at first certainly by the name: and so far we may appear to\nbe examining the meaning of a name. Next we have to think about the\nindividual instances, to see what they have in common, what it is that\nhas actuated us. [\u2026] At this stage we must take first what\nseems to us common in certain cases before us: next test what we have\ngot by considering other instances of our own application of\nthe name, other instances in which has been working in us. Now when\nthus thinking of other instances, we may see that they do not come\nunder the formula that we have generalized. [\u2026] There is a\nfurther stage when we have, or think we have, discovered the nature of\nthe principle which has really actuated us. We may now correct some of\nour applications of the name because we see that some instances do not\nreally possess the quality which corresponds to what we now understand\nthe principle to be. This explains how it should be possible to\ncriticize the facts out of which we have been drawing our data. (SI,\n44\u201345)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s \u2018linguistic phenomenology\u2019 (Austin 1979,\n182) was devised along similar lines (on this point, see Longworth\n2018a), and he also thought that ordinary language could be improved\nupon:\n\n\nCertainly ordinary language has no claim to be the last word, if there\nis such a thing. [\u2026] ordinary language is not the last\nword: in principle it can everywhere be supplemented and improved upon\nand superseded. Only remember, it is the first word. (Austin\n1979, 185)\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Cook Wilson uses in the above passage the\nexample of Socrates\u2019 search for definitions as an illustration\nof his procedure. This strongly suggests that he derived it from\nconsideration of the method of induction\n(\u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) in Ancient philosophy:\ncollect first a number of applications of a given term and, focussing\non salient features of these cases, formulate as an hypothesis a\ngeneral claim covering them, then test it for counterexamples against\nnovel applications. (Longworth (2018a) has also drawn some interesting\nparallels with \u2018experimental mathematics\u2019 (see Baker\n(2008) and the entry to this Encyclopedia).)\n",
