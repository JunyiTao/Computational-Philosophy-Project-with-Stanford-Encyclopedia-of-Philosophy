    "main_text": "Contemporary Controversies || Substance and teleology\n3.5 Substance and teleology\n\nThere is one mark of substance that was important to Aristotle that we\nhave not discussed. This is the connection between substance and\nteleology; that is, the notion that what something is is\nintimately connected with its natural purpose, end or function. The\nassociation with teleology does not naturally recommend itself to the\nmodern mind. Wiggins, for example, says that \u201cit would have been\nboth possible and advantageous for Aristotle to distance [his account\nof substance] from his concern with final causes\u2026\u201d (2001:\n80). The concern with teleology is presumably thought to be too\nclosely connected with Aristotle\u2019s theology, or the idea that it\nis divine design or intelligence that gives natural objects their\nends. Nevertheless, it is not easy for an Aristotelian to make a\ncomplete break from teleology. Teleology is what distinguishes living\nthings that act for purposes and have organs with functions from lumps\nand rocks, and it is the former that Aristotelians see as the paradigm\nsubstances. It is no accident, therefore, that artefacts, which are\ngenerally defined by their function, are often cited as good\nillustrations\u2014even if not paradigm cases\u2014of substances. So\nwe have a tension developing. On the one hand, lumps and rocks are\ngood paradigm cases of our notion of natural enduring objects. But\nthey are bad cases of objects with purposes or ends. Artefacts are\ngood cases of things with purposes, and are reasonably enduring, but\nare not natural objects. Living things come near to getting the best\nof both worlds. They are natural and enduring, and they have purposes,\nin the sense of natural goals in their behaviour. (Although, according\nto the modern perspective they do not possess a final end, unlike\nartefacts: a knife is for cutting, but there is nothing a dog is\nfor, though it has many ends en passant.)\n\nThis teleological approach to substance could be expressed as\nfollows.\n\nThe substances in a given system are those entities crucial from\nthe teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucial\u2019, here, means that other things exist either to\nconstitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\n\n\nThe tension between the teleological mark of the substantial and the\nothers we have considered might make it useful to distinguish between\ndescriptive ontological priority and teleological\nontological priority. The former is interested in a purely\ndescriptive account of what exists, and it, therefore, rates as the\nsubstances those entities that a purely descriptive science would\ncount as basic. The latter, however, counts as substances those things\nthat are deemed fundamental because of the role or function they play\nin the world. This contrast is most plain in the case of artefacts. An\nartefact is made of its parts, and, in a sense, they are more basic\nthan it because they constitute it. But if there were not artefacts of\nthe appropriate kind, those parts would never have come into\nexistence: if there were no motor cars, there would be no steering\nwheels or accelerator pedals. Thus, like Aristotle\u2019s severed\nfinger (Metaphysics 1035b 23\u20135), these latter do not\ncount as substances. But it is not true that the parts would not exist\nwithout the whole if one takes parts right down to the\nnatural elements and atoms that make the artefact. Then one has a\nconflict about what is deemed basic between the descriptive and the\nteleological criteria. It is to avoid this conflict that Aristotle\nrejects atomism, by allowing that there are no true entities, only\nstuffs, more basic than those he wants to treat as substances by the\ncriteria of teleological significance. He avoids having to face the\nproblem that one set of things is basic or substantial descriptively,\nnamely the atoms from which everything is constituted, and another set\nof things\u2014the macroscopic objects of our ordinary\nlives\u2014are substances by the criterion of teleological\nimportance. Because matter is stuff, not individuals, the objects that\nare teleologically important are also the descriptively basic objects,\nbecause what they are made of are not objects at all.\n\nIt could be argued that atomism can be reconciled with treating the\nthings that are significant for us as substances only if one thinks of\nthe atoms as existing only in order to constitute such objects. This\nwould be so if God had created the atoms so as to construct\nmacroscopic objects from them, just as we create the parts of\nartefacts only for the sake of the artefacts. It might be argued that\nthe same objective could be reached without theism if there is\nirreducible teleology in nature that gives significance to the rest.\nThomas Nagel\u2019s view in his (2012) either adopts or comes close\nto this position. But Nagel\u2019s position seems to challenge\nnatural science within its own realm, whereas the \u201ctheological\nartefact\u201d model does not. It is uncontroversial that an\nartefact, such as a clock, can be both mechanical and defined as the\nkind of thing that it is by its function. Applying this model to\nnature as a whole would involve bringing theology into\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics more directly than he, or indeed\nAquinas, intended. The notion that an object is what it is because of\nits use is found in Heidegger (1927 [2008]) but this is the use to\nwhich we put objects, not a divinely ordained teleology;\nHeidegger\u2019s theory imports the subjective perspective implicit\nin phenomenology, and this runs counter to Aristotle\u2019s\nobjectivism. If, however, one takes the teleology to be designed into\ncreation, this subjectivism is eliminated, and if one thinks that\nteleology is the key determinant of substantial identity, as with\nartefacts, then one has preserved the doctrine of substance, rather\nthan replacing it by a mere theory of function. This would have the\nconsequence that if the designer could change the purpose of an object\nwhilst leaving it physically unchanged\u2014as we do if we use a\nknife as a screwdriver\u2014then its substantial identity will change\n(Schillebeeckx, 1968, Dummett, 1987, Robinson, 2016)\n",
