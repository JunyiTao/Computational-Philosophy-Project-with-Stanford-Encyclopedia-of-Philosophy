    "main_text": "Walter Burley\u2019s standard theory\n3. Walter Burley\u2019s standard theory\n\nAccording to Walter Burley\u2019s presentation of the obligational\ntheory in the species of positio, the respondent faces a\nsequence of propositions that he must either grant or deny, one by\none. The sequence starts with a positum that is normally a\nfalse sentence which the respondent has to grant. Then the following\npropositions are evaluated in accordance with what Burley calls the\nessential rules of obligations. Three of these rules can be found from\npractically all medieval discussions of the technique. According to\nthem, the positum must be granted if it is put forward,\nanything following from the positum must be granted, and\nanything incompatible with the positum must be denied. (Cf.\nGreen 1963, Kretzmann and Stump 1988. Modern discussions of\nBurley\u2019s rules can be found in e.g., Ashworth 1981; Keffer 2001;\nSpade 1982; Spade and Stump 1983; Stump 1985; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 1994 and\n2001.)\n\nIn Burley\u2019s formulations the core rules are as follows:\n\n1.\nEverything that is posited and put forward in the form of the\npositum during the time of the positio must be\ngranted.\n2.\nEverything that follows from the positum must be\ngranted.\n3.\nEverything incompatible with the positum must be\ndenied.\n\n\nAlready these rules show that the technique (in Burley\u2019s\nversion) is aiming at consistency in the answers. He seems to have\nthis insight in mind when he gives later in the treatise a\n\u201cuseful rule\u201d that \u201call responses must be directed\nto the same instant\u201d, as if implying that any description of one\ninstant of time needs to be consistent.\n\nThe above three basic rules are not sufficient, as they cover only\nwhat follows from the positum alone or is incompatible with\nit alone. An important part of the obligational technique is to\nunderstand all propositions put forward in an obligational disputation\nas either relevant (pertinens) or irrelevant\n(impertinens). A proposition that follows or is incompatible,\nis relevant, and others are irrelevant. Relevant propositions are to\nbe answered according to their logical status, or in other words\naccording to rules 2. and 3. On how to answer irrelevant propositions,\nBurley gives the following rule:\n\n4.\nIf it is irrelevant, it must be responded to on the basis of its\nown quality.\n\n\nAs Burley carefully explains, \u201cits own quality\u201d means what\nwe take its truth value to be. Thus, a proposition known to be true\nmust be granted, and one known to be false must be denied. Answering\nwith doubt is also possible, according to Burley.\n\nThe rule concerning irrelevant propositions is generally accepted by\nall medieval authors writing on obligations, but in importantly\ndifferent exact versions. We will come back to some of these versions\nin the following, but first we must make clear about Burley\u2019s\nversion. He puts special attention to the following question: a\nproposition is relevant if it follows or is incompatible, but follows\nfrom exactly what, or is incompatible with exactly what? As Burley\nsees it, this relevance must be determined on the basis of all answers\nthat have been given in the disputation so far. On the first step\nimmediately after the positio, relevance is based on\nfollowing from the positum, or being incompatible with it.\nBut suppose the respondent must evaluate some salient irrelevant\nproposition on the first step. Then this answer must be taken into\naccount in determining whether a later proposition follows or is\nincompatible in the disputation. That is, the respondent must take\ncare not only that he does not deny his positum but that all\nhis answers remain consistent as a set.\n\nBurley formulated these ideas as further clarifications of rules 2.\nand 3., but let us here give them new numbers:\n\n5.\nEverything that follows from the positum either together\nwith an already granted proposition (or propositions), or together\nwith the opposite of a proposition (or the opposites of propositions)\nalready correctly denied and known to be such, must be granted.\n6.\nEverything that is incompatible with the positum together\nwith an already granted proposition (or propositions), or together\nwith the opposite of a proposition (or the opposites of propositions)\nalready correctly denied and known to be such, must be denied.\n\n\nA crucial effect of these rules is that at every step where an\nirrelevant proposition is answered, the class of relevant propositions\nexpands. Burley makes this explicit through a \u201cuseful\nrule\u201d that \u201cone must pay special attention to the order\n[of the propositions]\u201d. Something that is irrelevant at the\nfirst step might not be so anymore later in the disputation.\n\nNow, consider the following disputation as an example:\n\n\n\n\nPositum\nYou are in Rome.\nAccepted as possible. \n\nProposition\u00a01\nYou are not in Rome or you are a bishop\nGranted, true and irrelevant (rule 4). \n\nProposition\u00a02\nYou are a bishop.\nGranted, follows (rule 5).  \n\n\nDisputation D1\n\n\nAccording to Burley\u2019s approach, proposition 1 has to be\nevaluated as irrelevant, because it does not follow from the\npositum alone, and because of the first disjunct it is taken\nto be true even if the respondent is not a bishop (apologies to any\nreader actually in Rome). It must therefore be granted. However, this\nanswer makes the other disjunct relevant, because the first disjunct\nhappens to be the negation of the positum. Thus, Proposition\n2 must be granted. Indeed, by suitable selection of propositions,\nalmost anything at all may have to be granted at the later steps of a\ndisputation with a false positum. Burley gives a useful rule\nto make this clear: \u201cwhen a false contingent proposition is\nposited, one can prove any false proposition that is compossible with\nit.\u201d (Kretzmann and Stump 1988, 391.)\n\nBurley uses the word \u201ccompossible\u201d\n(compossibile). It is important to notice that at the time\nBurley was writing, the concept of consistency was not a standard part\nof technical logical language. He and his contemporaries did not speak\nabout consistent sets of sentences, because they did not have the\nvocabulary. This seems like a simple reason why Burley never says\ndirectly and explicitly that all answers must stick to consistency.\nInstead, it seems more probable that building the concept was a part\nof the development in the obligational technique.\n\nIn any case, the above example and the principle that almost anything\nmay have to be granted are not problematic in Burley\u2019s eyes.\nThis reflects a clear-eyed understanding that obligational\ndisputations were not about what is true and what is not, they were\nabout logical relationships between sentences.\n",
