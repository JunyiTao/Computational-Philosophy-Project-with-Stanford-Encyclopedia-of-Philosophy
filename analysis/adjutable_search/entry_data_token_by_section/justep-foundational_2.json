    "main_text": "The Classical Analysis of Foundational Justification || Foundational Justification as Infallible Belief\n2.1 Foundational Justification as Infallible Belief\n\nDescartes is often taken to be the paradigm of a classical\nfoundationalist. Determined to build knowledge on appropriate and\nsecure foundations, he seemed to want to identify foundational\nknowledge with infallible belief (though there is another\ninterpretation that we\u2019ll turn to in the next section, one that\nidentifies foundational knowledge with infallible\njustification). Implicitly or explicitly, others seemed to\nfollow his lead by restricting foundationally justified beliefs to\nbeliefs that cannot be mistaken. Following Lehrer (1974: 81) we might\nformulate the following definition of infallible belief:\nS\u2019s belief that P at t is infallible\nif S\u2019s believing P at t\n entails[4]\n that P is true.\n\nAs Lehrer and others have pointed out, it is far from clear that this\nconcept of infallible belief has much relevance to an attempt to\nunderstand the epistemic concept of foundational justification. The\nfirst and most striking problem involves necessary truths. Every\nnecessary truth is entailed by every proposition, and thus if I happen\nto believe a necessary truth, P, that I believe P\nwill entail that P is true. Thus, by the above definition my\nbelief that P will be infallible--and so, on the present\naccount, foundationally justified--whenever P is a necessary\ntruth even if P is something exceedingly complicated that I\ncan barely even comprehend.\n\nFurthermore, a foundation of knowledge and justified belief restricted\nto infallible beliefs (as defined above) would arguably be far too\nthin to support any sort of substantial epistemic edifice. There are a\nfew contingent propositions that are entailed by the fact that they\nare believed. My belief that I exist entails that I exist, that I have\nat least one belief, that someone has beliefs, etc. But once we get\npast these sorts of \u201cself-referential\u201d propositions,\npropositions whose very subject matter is encompassed by the fact that\nthey are believed, it is hard to come up with uncontroversial examples\nof contingent infallible beliefs. Ayer (1956: 19) argues that as long\nas the belief that P is one state of affairs and\nP\u2019s being the case is an entirely different state of\naffairs (not including as a constituent the former) there can be no\nlogical absurdity in the supposition that the former could occur\nwithout the latter (see BonJour 1985: 27, for a similar argument).\n",
