    "main_text": "The Atomism of Kal\u0101m || Space and Time\n1.2 Space and Time\n\nIn addition to God, atoms and accidents, certain Muslim theologians\nalso posited (empty) space. Averroes claimed that they did so in order\nfor there to be a place in which God temporally creates the atoms and\naccidents, although such a claim is not clearly stated by the\ntheologians themselves. Concerning space two questions were debated\namong the atomists: one, \u201cIs space discrete (like the atoms that\noccupy it) or continuous?\u201d and, two, \u201cIs there any\nunoccupied space, or more exactly, could there be interstitial void\nspaces between atoms or is the cosmos a plenum?\u201d\n\nWhile the Islamic theologians were virtually unanimous that matter is\ndiscrete, they varied concerning the make up of the space that atoms\noccupied, namely, whether space is constituted out of exactly fitting\natom-sized cells, or whether it is an open continuous expanse. The\ndebate centered on the issue of whether an atom could be placed on top\nof two atoms such that the top atom straddles both of the bottom atoms\nequally, for instance like the top block on a small pyramid made up of\nthree equally sized blocks. Those who argued that space must be\ndiscrete did so on the basis that if it were not, then atoms would\nturn out to be at least conceptually divisible, yet all Muslim\natomists agreed that atoms are not only physically indivisible, but\nalso conceptually indivisible. One of their most common arguments\nbegan with the premise that the atom represents the smallest possible\nmagnitude. If space is continuous such that an atom could straddle two\natoms at their boundary and so form something like the aforementioned\nthree-block pyramid, then imagine two such pyramids joined at their\nbases so that a gap is formed between the two top atoms. In that case,\nthe two top atoms would be separated from one another by a magnitude\nless than an atom. Since the atom is the least possible magnitude, and\nyet the magnitude between the two top atoms is purportedly less than\nan atom, there is a contradiction; for there is a magnitude less than\nthe smallest possible magnitude. Those who argued for a continuous\nspace in contrast began with the premise that an atom can occupy and\nmeasure any vacant space that is of a sufficient size to hold it. Thus\nthey had one imagine a line three atoms long and then two more atoms\non top of these, where one atom is exactly over the far-right, bottom\natom, for example, and another atom is exactly over the far-left\nbottom atom. Next they had one imagine that at the exact same moment\ntwo equal forces push the two top atoms towards each other. Either the\ntwo atoms straddle the two boundaries of the three bottom atoms or\nnot. If they straddle them, then space must be continuous and not\ndiscrete. If the opponent denies that they straddle the boundaries,\nthen he owes us an answer as to why they do not. Certainly the two\natoms can be moved in the manner described; for the only thing that\ncould prevent the motion would be the presence of an obstacle, and yet\nthe adjacent space into which the atoms are moved is supposedly empty.\nAlthough this last argument offered a serious challenge to the notion\nof discrete space, most of the later theologians were in fact inclined\nto make all magnitudes discrete, whether that magnitude was corporeal,\nspatial or even, as we shall see, temporal.\n\nThe second question concerning space involved the possible existence\nof interstitial voids and focused on whether two atoms could be\nseparated from one another without a third atom\u2019s existing between\nthem. Dhanani (Dhanani 1994, 74\u201381) has classified the arguments\nagainst such a possibility into two types: those involving non-being\nand those involving the principle \u2018nature abhors a void.\u2019\nAn example of the first kind of argument is the following. Assume that\ntwo atoms are separated and that purportedly nothing exists between\nthem. Since one cannot perceive what does not exist, then in the\npresent case one should not be able to perceive a truly empty space\nbetween the separated atoms; however, it seems evident that one would\nbe able to perceive the space between them and so that space could not\nbe truly empty, but must be occupied by an atom. An example of the\nsecond sort of argument against interstitial voids is taken from the\nmedical arts and the use of cupping glasses for blood letting. It is\nobserved that when a cupping glass is placed over a vein and the air\nis withdrawn, the flesh is drawn up into the cup. The detractors of\ninterstitial voids used this phenomenon as a verification of the\nprinciple that nature abhors a vacuum. Consequently, since nature does\nabhor a vacuum, void spaces will not exist in nature. Interestingly,\nthe proponents of interstitial voids were able to turn the cupping\nglass phenomenon against their opponents to show that a void must\nexist. They had one imagine that a sheet of atoms one atom thick is\nplaced between two cupping glasses and then the air is simultaneously\nremoved from both glasses. Either the sheet is drawn into one or the\nother glass or it is not. If the sheet is drawn into one cupping\nglass, there is a void in the other; if the sheet is not drawn into\none or the other cupping glass, then there is a void in both. In\neither case a void has been produced.\n\nAs for time, although Moses Maimonides would claim in the Guide of\nthe Perplexed that Muslim theologians had a single atomic theory\nof time, such a claim seems to be gainsaid by earlier sources\navailable to us (Maimonides 1963, ch. 73, premise 3). The theologian\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b lists no less than three different accounts of the\nmoment and time (al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b 1980, 443). One theory makes time an\naggregate of moments, where the moment is a \u2018certain duration\nbetween one action and the next action\u2019 (Ibid). It is not clear\nwhether the duration in question is some minimal temporal unit or some\npotentially divisible temporal unit or even whether it could be either\ndepending upon the action in question. If it is some minimal temporal\nunit, or time atom, then such a view would clearly advocate time\u2019s\nhaving an atomic structure. A second theory considers the moment an\naccident. The philosopher Avicenna (980\u20131037), who was writing a\nlittle more than a generation later, commented on this view and noted\nthat the moment-accident posited by certain theologians is what\ntemporally locates an atom and that time is simply a collection of\nsuch accidents. The final theory of time, which was by far the most\npopular among the theologians, made the moment simply some\nconventionally specified event, such as someone\u2019s entering a house,\nand as such it has no special ontological status, whereas\n\u2018time\u2019 is just another name for the motion of the heavens.\nIt should be noted, however, that if the motion in question had an\natomic structure, then ipso facto time would be atomic, and\nindeed many of those who held this conception of time endorsed atomic\nmotion. Although it not clear whether Muslim theologians explicitly\nespoused a theory of atomic time, as we shall see in the next section,\nsome of them adopted a theory of occasionalism, which at least\nimplicitly endorses such a view.\n",
