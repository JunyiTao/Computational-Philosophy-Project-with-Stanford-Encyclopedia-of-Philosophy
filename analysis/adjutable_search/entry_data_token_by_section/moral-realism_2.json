Psychology\n\n\nNonetheless, realists and anti-realists alike are usually inclined\nto hold that Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument is getting at\nsomething important\u2014some feature of moral claims that makes\nthem not well captured by nonmoral claims.\n\n\nAccording to some, that \u2018something important\u2019 is that\nmoral claims are essentially bound up with motivation in a way that\nnonmoral claims are not (Ayer 1936, Stevenson 1937, Gibbard 1990,\nBlackburn 1993). Exactly what the connection to motivation is supposed\nto be is itself controversial, but one common proposal (motivation\ninternalism) is that a person counts as sincerely making a moral claim\nonly if she is motivated appropriately. To think of something that it\nis good, for instance, goes with being, other things equal, in favor of\nit in ways that would provide some motivation (not necessarily\ndecisive) to promote, produce, preserve or in other ways support it. If\nsomeone utterly lacks such motivations and yet claims nonetheless that\nshe thinks the thing in question is good, there is reason, people note,\nto suspect either that she is being disingenuous or that she does not\nunderstand what she is saying. This marks a real contrast with nonmoral\nclaims since the fact that a person makes some such claim sincerely\nseems never to entail anything in particular about her motivations.\nWhether she is attracted by, repelled by, or simply indifferent to some\ncolor is irrelevant to whether her claim that things have that color\nare sincere and well understood by her.\n\n\nNoncognitivists often appeal to this apparent contrast to argue that\nmoral claims have this necessary connection to motivation precisely\nbecause they do not express beliefs (that might be true or false) but\ninstead express motivational states of desire, approval, or commitment\n(that might be satisfied or frustrated but are neither true nor false).\nNonmoral claims, they maintain, commonly express beliefs and for that\nreason are rightly seen as purporting to report facts and as being\nevaluable as true or false. Yet, because beliefs alone are\nmotivationally inert, the fact that someone is sincerely making such a\nclaim (that is, is expressing something she actually believes) is\ncompatible with her having any sort of motivation, or none at all. In\ncontrast, claims that commonly express desires, preferences, and\ncommitments do not purport to report facts and are not evaluable as\ntrue or false. Yet, because these are all motivationally loaded, the\nfact that someone sincerely makes such a claim (that is, is expressing\nsomething she actually feels) is incompatible with her failing to have\nthe corresponding motivations. As soon as the contrast is in place,\nnoncognitivists argue, we can well explain the motivational force of\nsincere moral claims and explain too the insight behind Moore\u2019s\nOpen Question Argument, by seeing moral claims as not beliefs but\n(perhaps a distinctive kind of) desire, preference, or commitment.\n\n\nSome moral realists respond to this line of argument by rejecting\nthe idea that beliefs are all motivationally inert (Platts 1979).\nAccording to them moral beliefs stand as a counter example. But it is\nnot the only apparent counter example. Consider, for instance, first\nperson claims concerning the prospect of pain. If a person claimed that\nan experience would be painful and yet had no motivation whatsoever,\nother things equal, to resist, oppose, or in some way avoid that\nexperience, there would be reason to suspect either that she is being\ndisingenuous or that she does not understand what she is saying. That,\nthough, is no reason to think a sincere claim that some experience\nwould be painful does not express a belief, purport to report a fact,\nand open itself to evaluation as true or false. This all suggests,\nthese realists argue, that moral claims might well carry motivational\nimplications, and that might be the insight behind Moore\u2019s Open\nQuestion Argument, even though those claims express beliefs and, as a\nresult, purport to report facts and can be evaluated as true or\nfalse.\n\n\nOther moral realists reject the idea that moral claims are as\ntightly bound up with motivation as the noncognitivist argument\nsupposes. They point out that, while an absence of appropriate\nmotivation would raise questions, there might be answers. The person\nmaking the claims might be so depressed or so weak-willed or so evil,\nthat she remains utterly unmoved even when she sincerely thinks action\nwould secure something valuable. To suppose this is not possible is to\nbeg the question against those who would grant that beliefs are\nmotivationally inert while holding that moral claims express\nbeliefs.\n\n\nThose that take this line can, and often do, go on to argue\nnonetheless both (i) that there is a distinctive connection between\nmoral claims and action and (ii) that the connection helps to explain\nthe insight behind Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument. However, they\nmaintain, the distinctive connection is either itself a normative\nconnection between the claims and motivation or else it is a conceptual\nconnection between the claims (or their truth) and which actions a\nperson has reason to perform (Smith 1994). On the first suggestion, a\nperson might well fail to be motivated appropriately by the moral\nclaims she sincerely embraces, but in failing to be appropriately\nmotivated she would thereby count as irrational. On the second\nsuggestion, again a person might well fail to be motivated\nappropriately by the moral claims she sincerely embraces, but either\nthe fact that she sincerely embraces the claims or the truth of the\nclaims she embraces (if they are true) provide reasons for her to act\nin certain ways. All of these views involves rejecting motivational\ninternalism even as they each maintain that there is a conceptual\nconnection of some sort between moral claims (or their truth) and\naction (or the motivation to act). (The resulting views are often\ncharacterized as versions of reason internalism.) Nonmoral claims alone\nnever imply anything in particular about what people have reason to do\nor refrain from doing, but moral claims, in contrast, do have such\nimplications, they argue. On this view, there is a necessary connection\nbetween moral claims and action, but it is between these claims (or\ntheir truth) and reason (or rationality), and is not such that\nsincerely embracing a moral claim guarantees appropriate\nmotivation.\n\n\nNone of this is to defend, as realists must, the idea that some of\nthe claims are actually true. But it does suggest that moral realists\ncan acknowledge a necessary connection between moral claims and action\nwithout abandoning the cognitivism that is central to their\nposition.\n\n\nSome error theorists do argue that combining cognitivism with\nmotivational internalism results in an untenable position (Mackie\n1977). According to them, the moral facts that would make motivating\nbeliefs true would themselves have to be, in some way, intrinsically\nmotivating states of the world. And, they add, there is no reason to\nthink there are such states. Yet if the motivational internalism one\nembraces for moral claims has a parallel for pain claims, then this\nargument must be wrong (assuming it is true of some experiences that\nthey are painful). Either motivational internalism does not require\nintrinsically motivating states of the world in order for the relevant\nclaims to be true or else we have independent reason (provided by our\nawareness of pain) to think there are such states. While there may well\nbe reason to think there are no moral facts, this argument does not\nprovide it.\n",
