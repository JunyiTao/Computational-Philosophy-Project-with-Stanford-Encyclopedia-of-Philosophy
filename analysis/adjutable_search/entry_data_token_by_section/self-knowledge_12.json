    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Reasons Accounts\n3.5 Reasons Accounts\n\nAbove, we saw that on standard views of beliefs and desires, these\nattitudes are at least partly constituted by dispositions to reason,\nbehave, and affectively react. This is one basis for thinking that\nself-knowledge of attitudes must be inferential. After all,\ndispositions seem to be linked with counterfactual truths, and such\ntruths can be known only through inference.\n\nThe reasons account of self-knowledge, first advanced by\nPeacocke (1999), says that we can sometimes know our beliefs without\nrelying on inference. While beliefs are dispositional states,\njudgments are occurrent: a judgment that p is an\nevent. Peacocke argues that judging it\u2019s\nsnowing (say) provides you with a reason to think that you have\nthe dispositions associated with the belief that it\u2019s\nsnowing\u2014e.g., to put on boots when leaving the house (if you\ndesire dry feet). In other words, Peacocke thinks that judging\nit\u2019s snowing gives you reason to believe that you\nbelieve that it\u2019s snowing.\n\nNotably, on this view the judgment can serve as a reason for the\ncorresponding self-ascription of belief so long as the judgment is\nconscious. You need not be aware of the judgment. An analogy\nmay illuminate the basic idea here. An itch can serve as a reason for\nscratching even if there is no further conscious state (distinct from\nthe itch) that constitutes an awareness of the itch. Peacocke\nargues that, in a broadly similar way, a conscious judgment that\np can serve as a direct reason for my self-ascribing the\nbelief that p, without my introspecting the judgment and\ninferring that I believe that p, or even having any distinct\nawareness of that judgment. (Compare Silins 2012.)\n\nThe non-inferential transition from judging that p (a\nconscious, occurrent state) to believing that one believes that\np (that is, to self-ascribing a belief) is a rational one, on\nthis view, because judging is conceptually linked with believing:\nmaking a judgment \u201cis the fundamental way to form a\nbelief\u201d (Peacocke 1999: 238). Similarly, since remembering that\np is conceptually linked with believing that p, a\nconscious memory that p can justify the belief that one\nbelieves that p. And anyone in a position to self-ascribe a\nbelief will possess the concept of belief, and so will grasp\u2014or\nat least, manifest cognitive dispositions appropriately\nreflecting\u2014these conceptual\n truths.[7]\n\nDrawing on Peacocke, Paul (2012) develops a reasons account of how we\nknow our intentions. On this account, the transition from deciding to\ndo something (or remembering that one has so decided) to believing\nthat one intends to do that thing is rational, since it is a\nconceptual truth that deciding normally suffices for intending.\n\nSilins (2020) presents a different argument for the reasons account as\napplied to belief. He thinks that judgments like it\u2019s\nsnowing but I don\u2019t believe that it is\u2014known as\n\u201cMoore-paradoxical judgments\u201d\u2014are plainly irrational. But if the\njudgment that p didn\u2019t provide justification for\nself-ascribing the belief that p, these judgments could be\nperfectly rational. Silins concludes that judging that p\nprovides (propositional) justification for self-ascribing the belief\nthat p. This explains why Moore-paradoxical judgments are\nirrational: in making such a judgment \u201cyou flout the justification\ngiven to you by your judgment that p\u201d (Silins 2020: 334).\n\nColiva (2008) objects that judgments cannot rationalize\nself-ascriptions of belief in the way the reasons theorist contends,\nbecause they are not suitably accessible. Her argument rests, in part,\non a claim reminiscent of the self-interpretation view: that the\nphenomenology of a conscious thought\u2014such as \u201cthings will\nlook up\u201d\u2014does not indicate whether this is the content of\na judgment or, instead, of a wish. McHugh (2012) responds on behalf of\nthe reasons account, arguing that there is a \u201cphenomenology\ncharacteristic of judging that p\u201d that is present in\ncases where ordinary self-knowledge is possible (2012: 148). This\ndispute suggests that the prospects for the reasons account, as an\naccount of self-knowledge of the attitudes, may depend in part on\nwhether attitudes have \u201cproprietary phenomenology\u201d (Pitt\n2004).
