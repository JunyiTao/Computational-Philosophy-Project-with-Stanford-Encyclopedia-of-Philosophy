    "preamble": "\n\nThe first centuries after \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha\u2019s death saw\nthe rise of multiple schools of thought and teacher lineages within\nthe Buddhist community as it spread throughout the Indian\nsubcontinent. These new forms of scholarly monastic communities had\ndistinct theoretical and practical interests and, in their efforts to\norganize, interpret, and reexamine the Buddha\u2019s scattered\nteachings, they developed a particular system of thought and method of\nexposition called Abhidharma (Pali, Abhidhamma). The Sanskrit term\nabhidharma seems to derive from the expression\n\u201cconcerning (abhi) the teaching(s) (Skt.,\ndharma, Pali, dhamma).\u201d For the Buddhist\nexegetical tradition, however, the term means approximately\n\u201chigher\u201d or \u201cfurther\u201d teaching, and it refers\nboth to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement\nand to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of\nBuddhist thought. This body of literature includes the third of the\n\u201cthree baskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the\nAbhidharma-pi\u1e6daka (Pali,\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka), its commentaries, and later\nexegetical texts.\n\nBoth as an independent literary genre and a branch of thought and\ninquiry, Abhidharma is to be contrasted with S\u016btr\u0101nta, the\nsystem of the Buddha\u2019s discourses (Skt., s\u016btras,\nPali, suttas). Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that\nare colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined\nto ensure analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive\nin its efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist\npractice of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of\nsentient experience. It does so by analyzing conscious\nexperience\u2014and in this sense one\u2019s\n\u201cworld\u201d\u2014into its constituent mental and physical\nevents (Skt., dharm\u0101, Pali, dhamm\u0101,\nhereafter dharmas/dhammas respectively). The overarching\ninquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple\ncategories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of\ntheir manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as\nthe \u201cdharma theory.\u201d The exhaustive\ninvestigations into the nature and interaction of dharmas\nextended into the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology,\nand generated doctrinal controversies among different Buddhist\nschools. The Abhidharma analysis of and methods of argumentation about\nthese controversies provided the framework of reference and defined\nthe agenda for the Mah\u0101y\u0101na schools of Madhyamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. As a distinct doctrinal movement, then, Abhidharma\nhad a remarkable impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and gave rise\nto Buddhist systematic philosophy and hermeneutics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Abhidharma: its origins and texts\n\nThe early history of Buddhism in India is remarkably little known and\nthe attempt to construct a consistent chronology of that history still\nengrosses the minds of contemporary scholars. A generally accepted\ntradition has it that some time around the beginning of the third\ncentury BCE, the primitive Buddhist community divided into two parties\nor fraternities: the Sthaviras (Pali, Theriyas) and the\nMah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghikas, each of which thenceforth had its own\nordination traditions. Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so,\ndoctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the\nformation of various schools of thought (v\u0101da;\n\u0101cariyav\u0101da) and teacher lineages\n(\u0101cariyakula) (Vin 51\u201354; Mhv V\n12\u201313. See Cousins 1991, 27\u201328; Frauwallner 1956, 5ff\n& 130ff; Lamotte 1988, 271ff; Wynne 2019, 269\u2013283).\n\nAccording to traditional Buddhist accounts, by the time the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines arose, roughly in the first century BCE,\nthere were eighteen sub-sects or schools of Sthaviras, the tradition\nancestral to the Therav\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine of\nthe elders\u201d). The number eighteen, though, became conventional\nin Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons\n(Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve\ndivergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The\nlikelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist\ncommunity gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed\nspontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over\nthe entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems\nthat confronted each monastic community (sa\u1e45gha). Each\nsa\u1e45gha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay\ncircles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy,\nand use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed,\nthe names of the \u201ceighteen schools\u201d are indicative of\ntheir origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or\nthe legacy of particular founders: for instance,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that all\nthings exist\u201d), Sautr\u0101ntikas (\u201cthose who rely on the\ns\u016btras\u201d)/D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntikas\n(\u201cthose who employ\n examples\u201d),[1]\n and Pudgalav\u0101da (\u201cthose who affirm the existence of the\nperson\u201d); Haimavatas (\u201cthose of the snowy\nmountains\u201d); or V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (\u201cthose\naffiliated with V\u0101ts\u012bputra\u201d) respectively. As noted by\nGethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in\nChristianity, \u201cat least some of the schools mentioned by later\nBuddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought\nin the manner of \u2018Cartesians,\u2019 \u2018British\nEmpiricists,\u2019 or \u2018Kantians\u2019 for the history of\nmodern\n philosophy.\u201d[2]\n\nIt is customarily assumed that the multiple ancient Buddhist schools\ntransmitted their own versions of Abhidharma collections, but only two\ncomplete canonical collections are preserved, representing two\nschools: the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, who emerged as an independent\nschool from within the Sthaviras around the second or first century\nBCE, became dominant in north, especially northwest India, and spread\nto central Asia; and the Sinhalese Therav\u0101da, a branch of the\nSthaviras that spread out in south India and parts of southeast Asia.\nThese two extant collections comprise the third of the \u201cthree\nbaskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon. The exegetical\ntraditions of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da understand\ntheir respective canonical Abhidharma to consist of a set of seven\ntexts, though each school specifies a different set of texts. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma-pi\u1e6daka consists of\nthe Sa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya (Discourse on the\nCollective Recitation), the Dharmaskandha\n(Compendium of Dharmas), the\nPraj\u00f1apti\u015b\u0101stra (Manual of\nConcepts), the Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya\n(Compendium of Consciousness), the\nDh\u0101tuk\u0101ya (Compendium of Elements), the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da (Literary\nExposition), and the J\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na\n(The Foundation of Knowledge). These seven texts survive in\nfull only in their ancient Chinese translations. The Therav\u0101din\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka comprises the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i (Enumeration of\nDhammas), the Vibha\u1e45ga (Analysis),\nthe Dh\u0101tukath\u0101 (Discourse on Elements),\nthe Puggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti (Designation of\nPersons), the Kath\u0101vatthu (Points of\nDiscussion), the Yamaka (Pairs), and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Causal Conditions). These\nseven texts are preserved in Pali and all but the Yamaka have\nbeen translated into English.\n\nLater generations composed commentaries on the canonical Abhidharma\nand introduced a variety of exegetical manuals that expound the\nessentials of the canonical systems. These post-canonical texts are\nthe products of single authors and display fully developed polemical\nstances and sectarian worldviews of their respective schools. Much of\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma system is contained in\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s comprehensive Visuddhimagga (The Path\nof Purification, fifth century CE). More direct introductory\nAbhidhamma manuals are Buddhadatta\u2019s\nAbhidhamm\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to\nAbhidhamma, fifth century CE) and Anuruddha\u2019s\nAbhidhammatthasa\u1e45gaha (Compendium of the Topics of\nAbhidhamma, twelfth century CE). The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\ntradition preserves in Chinese translation three different recensions\nof an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 dated to the first or second century\nCE, the last and best known of which is called the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. The\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia document several centuries\nof scholarly activity representing multiple Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nbranches, most notably the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of Kashmir who are\nknown as Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da manual most influential for later Chinese and\nTibetan Buddhism, however, is Vasubandhu\u2019s\nAbhidharmako\u015ba (Treasury of Abhidharma, fifth\ncentury CE). The Abhidharmako\u015ba\u2019s auto-commentary\ncontains substantial criticism of orthodox Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\npositions, which later Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nmasters attempted to refute. Particularly famous in this category is\nthe Ny\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra (Conformance to Correct\nPrinciple) of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra, a contemporary of Vasubandhu.\nThis comprehensive treatise reestablishes orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da views and is considered one of the final\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da works to have\n survived.[3]\n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma/Abhidhamma texts are by and large compositions\ncontemporary with the formative period in the history of the early\nBuddhist schools, providing the means by which one group could define\nitself and defend its position against the divergent interpretations\nand criticisms of other parties. Although much of the Abhidharma\nmindset and something of its method draw on the\n\u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas, i.e., the collections of\ns\u016btras (Pali, suttas), the main body of its\nliterature contains interpretations of the Buddha\u2019s discourses\nspecific to each school of thought and philosophical elaborations of\nselectively emphasized doctrinal issues. These continued to be refined\nby subsequent generations of monks who contributed to the\nconsolidation of the two surviving Therav\u0101da and\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da schools.\n1.1 Literary style and genre\n\nScholarly opinion has generally been divided between two alternative\ninterpretations of the term abhidharma, both of which hinge\nupon the denotation of the prefix abhi. First, taking\nabhi in the sense of \u201cwith regard to,\u201d\nabhidharma is understood as a discipline whose subject matter\nis the Dharma, the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Second, using\nabhi in the sense of preponderance and distinction,\nabhidharma has also been deemed a distinct, higher teaching;\nthe essence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings or that which goes beyond\nwhat is given in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, in a sense somewhat\nreminiscent of the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d (e.g.,\nDhs-a 2\u20133; Horner 1941; von Hin\u00fcber 1994).\nBuddhist tradition itself differentiates between the\nS\u016btr\u0101nta and Abhidharma methods of instructing the teachings\nby contrasting the S\u016btr\u0101nta \u201cway of putting\nthings\u201d in partial, figurative terms that require further\nclarification, versus the Abhidharma exposition and catechism that\nexpound the teachings fully, in non-figurative terms (A IV\n449\u2013456; Dhs-a 154). This coincides with additional\ndistinctions the tradition makes between texts that have implicit\nmeaning (Skt., ney\u0101rtha, Pali, neyyattha)\nversus those that have explicit meaning (Skt.,\nn\u012bt\u0101rtha, Pali n\u012btattha) (A\nI 60; Ps I 18), and texts that are expressed in conventional\nterms (Skt., sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti, Pali, sammuti)\nversus others that are expressed in ultimate terms (Skt.,\nparam\u0101rtha, Pali, paramattha) (Vibh\n100\u2013101; Mp I\n 94\u201397).[4]\n From Abhidharma perspective, the s\u016btras were conveyed\nin conventional terms whose ultimate meaning required further\ninterpretation.\n\nThe texts of the canonical Abhidharma are works that evolved over\ndecades, if not centuries, out of materials already present in the\nS\u016btra and Vinaya portions of the canon. This is evidenced in two\ncharacteristics of the genre that can be traced to earlier Buddhist\nliterature. The first is the analytical style of the texts, which\nattempt to summarize meticulously the significant points of the Dharma\nand provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the mental and physical\nfactors that constitute sentient experience. This analytical\nenterprise includes the arrangement of major parts of the material\naround detailed lists of factors and combinations of sets of their\ncategories yielding matrices (Skt., m\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101,\nPali, m\u0101tik\u0101) of doctrinal topics. Already in the\ncollections of the Buddha\u2019s discourses, certain texts are\narranged according to taxonomic lists, providing formulaic treatment\nof doctrinal items that are expounded elsewhere. Lists were clearly\npowerful mnemonic devices, and their prevalence in early Buddhist\nliterature can be explained partly as a consequence of its being\ncomposed and for some centuries preserved\n orally.[5]\n For instance, one of the four primary \u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas, the\ncollection of \u201cgrouped\u201d sayings\n(sa\u1e43yukta/sa\u1e43yutta), groups the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings according to specific topics, including the four noble\ntruths, the four ways of establishing mindfulness, the five\naggregates, the six sense faculties, the seven constituents of\nawakening, the noble eightfold path, the twelve links of dependent\norigination, and others. Similar taxonomic lists form the table of\ncontents of the Vibha\u1e45ga and\nPuggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti of the Therav\u0101da and the\nSa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya and Dharmaskandha of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, which are structured as commentaries on\nthose lists.\n\nThe second characteristic of Abhidharma literature is its bent for\ndiscursive hermeneutics through catechetical exposition. The texts\nseem to be the products of discussions about the doctrine within the\nearly Buddhist community. Again, such discussions are already found in\nthe \u0100gama/Nik\u0101ya collections (e.g., M I\n292\u2013305, III 202\u2013257): they often begin with a doctrinal\npoint to be clarified and proceed to expound the topic at stake using\na pedagogical method of question and answer. The texts also record\nmore formal methods of argumentation and refutation of rival theories\nthat shed light on the evolution of the Abhidharma as responding to\nthe demands of an increasingly polemical environment. The process of\ninstitutionalization undergone by Buddhist thought at the time and the\nspread of the Buddhist community across the Indian subcontinent\ncoincided with a transition from oral to written methods of textual\ntransmission and with the rise of monastic debates concerning the\ndoctrine among the various Buddhist schools. Intellectual assimilation\nand doctrinal disputes also existed between the Buddhist monastic\ncommunity and the contemporaneous Sanskrit Grammarians, Jains, and\nBrahmanical schools with their evolving scholastic and analytical\nmovements, which must also have contributed to the Abdhidharma\ndiscursive hermeneutics and argumentative style. The dialectic format\nand the display of awareness of differences in doctrinal\ninterpretation are the hallmarks of the Kath\u0101vatthu and\nthe Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya. Later on, post-canonical\nAbhidharma texts became complex philosophical treatises employing\nsophisticated methods of argumentation and independent investigations\nthat resulted in doctrinal conclusions quite far removed from their\ncanonical antecedents.\n\nAbhidharma literature, then, arose from two approaches to discussing\nthe Dharma within the early Buddhist community: the first intended to\nsummarize and analyze the significant points of the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings, the second to elaborate on and interpret the doctrines by\nmeans of monastic disputations (Bronkhorst 2016, 29\u201346; Cousins 1983,\n10; Dessein 2016, 4\u20137; Gethin 1992b, 165; Gethin 2022, 227\u2013242).\n1.2 Abhidharma exegesis: from Dharma to dharmas\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s discourses collected in the\n\u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas analyze sentient experience from different\nstandpoints: in terms of name-and-form (n\u0101ma-r\u016bpa),\nthe five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha),\nthe twelve sense fields (\u0101yatana), or the eighteen sense\nelements (dh\u0101tu). All these modes of analysis provide\ndescriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and\nmental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and\nconditions. A striking difference between the S\u016btr\u0101nta and\nthe Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time\nscale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment\nto moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by\nwhich the s\u016btras portray sequential processes as\napplying to discrete, momentary events (Cousins 1983, 7; Ronkin 2005,\n66\u201378).\n\nThese events are referred to as dharmas (Pali,\ndhammas), differently from the singular\ndharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha\u2019s teaching(s).\nThe \u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas use the form dharmas to convey a\npluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory\nphenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six\nsense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind\n[manas]). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw\nsubtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the\ndifferences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within\nthis context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific\nmental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt.,\nmanovij\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, Pali,\nmanovi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a) that is considered the\ncentral cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception.\nMental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that\ndiscerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and\nthat emerges when the requisite conditions come together.\nDharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts,\nor memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness,\ndharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid\nconsciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in\nsequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with\nthe five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory,\netc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray\ndharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse\ncapacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a\nparticular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set\nor mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and\nconceptualizing\n it.[6]\n\nUltimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential\nevents are understood as arising from the interaction of\ndharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here,\ndharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena,\nand are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or\ndynamic properties rather than enduring\n substances.[7]\n The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive\naccount of every possible type of experience\u2014every type of\noccurrence that may possibly present itself in one\u2019s\nconsciousness\u2014in terms of its constituent dharmas. This\nenterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception\ninto their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their\nrelations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming\nboth the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and\ntheir synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold\nrelationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the\n\u201cdharma theory.\u201d\n2. The dharma taxonomy: a metaphysics of experience\n\nThe Abhidharma attempts to individuate and determine the unique\nidentity of each dharma yield complex intersecting taxonomies\nof dharmas organized by multiple criteria or sets of\nqualities. Abhidharma texts of different schools proposed different\ndharma taxonomies, enumerating a more or less finite number\nof dharma categories. It is important to remember, though,\nthat the term dharma signifies both any category that\nrepresents a type of occurrence as well as any of its particular\ntokens or instances. The Therav\u0101da introduced a system of\neighty-two dhamma categories, meaning that there are\neighty-two possible types of occurrence in the experiential world, not\neighty-two occurrences. These are organized into a fourfold\ncategorization. The first three categories include the bare phenomenon\nof consciousness (citta) that encompasses a single\ndhamma type and of which the essential characteristic is the\ncognizing of an object; associated mentality (cetasika) that\nencompasses fifty-two dhammas; and materiality or physical\nphenomena (r\u016bpa) that include twenty-eight\ndhammas that make up all physical occurrences\n(Abhidh-av 1). All the eighty-one dhamma types in\nthese three broad categories are conditioned\n(sa\u1e45khata). Conditioned dhammas arise and\ncease subject to numerous causes and conditions and constitute\nsentient experience in all realms of the round of rebirth\n (sa\u1e43s\u0101ra).[8]\n The eighty-second dhamma that comprises the fourth category\nis unconditioned (asa\u1e45khata): it neither arises nor\nceases through causal interaction. The single occurrence in this\nfourth category is nirvana (Pali, nibb\u0101na).\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da adopted a system of seventy-five basic\ntypes of dharmas organized into a fivefold categorization.\nThe first four categories comprise all conditioned\n(sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta) dharmas and include, again,\nconsciousness (citta, one single dharma); associated\nmentality (caitta, encompasses forty-six dharmas);\nand physical phenomena (r\u016bpa, eleven dharmas);\nbut also factors dissociated from thought\n(cittaviprayuktasa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, fourteen\ndharmas). The last category is mentioned neither in the\ns\u016btras nor in the Therav\u0101da lists, but is found\npredominantly in northern Indian Abhidharma texts of all periods. The\nspecific dharmas included within it vary, but they are all\nunderstood as explaining a range of experiential events, being\nthemselves dissociated from both material form and thought. The fifth\ncategory in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da taxonomy, that of the\nunconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta), comprises three\ndharmas, namely, space and two states of cessation\n(nirodha), the latter being a term that connotes the\nculmination of the Buddhist path (Cox 1995; 2004A, 553\u2013554).\n\nThe Abhidharma analyzes in great detail each of these categories, thus\ncreating relational schemata whereby each acknowledged experience,\nphenomenon, or occurrence can be determined and identified by\nparticular definition and function. Especially important is the\nanalysis of consciousness or citta, on which much of\nAbhidharma doctrinal thought is built. Consider the Therav\u0101da\nanalysis of consciousness, whose basic principles are shared with the\nother Abhidharma systems.\n\nThe epitome of the operation of consciousness is citta as\nexperienced in the process of sensory perception that, in Abhidharma\n(as in Buddhism in general), is deemed the paradigm of sentient\nexperience. Citta can never be experienced as bare\nconsciousness in its own origination moment, for consciousness is\nalways intentional, directed to a particular object that is cognized\nby means of certain mental factors. Citta, therefore, always\noccurs associated with its appropriate cetasikas or mental\nfactors that perform diverse functions and that emerge and cease\ntogether with it, having the same object (either sensuous or mental)\nand grounded in the same sense faculty. Any given consciousness\nmoment\u2014also signified by the very term citta\u2014is\nthus a unique assemblage of citta and its associated mental\nfactors such as feeling, conceptualization, volition, or attention, to\nname several of those required in any thought process. Each assemblage\nis conscious of just one object, arises for a brief instant and then\nfalls away, followed by another citta combination that picks\nup a different object by means of its particular associated mental\nfactors.\n\nThe classic Abhidhamma scheme as gleaned from the first book of the\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka, the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, and as organized by the\ncommentarial tradition describes eighty-nine basic types of\nconsciousness moments, i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncetasika (Dhs Book I; Vism XIV\n81\u2013110; Abhidh-av 1\u201315; Abhidh-s\n1\u20135). It classifies these basic citta types most\nbroadly according to their locus of occurrence, beginning with the\nsense-sphere (k\u0101m\u0101vacara) that includes forty-five\ncitta types, most prominently those that concern the\nmechanics of perception of sensuous objects; next come eighteen\nform-sphere (r\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that\nconcern the mind that has attained meditative absorption\n(jh\u0101na); followed by eight formless-sphere\n(ar\u016bp\u0101vacara) consciousnesses that constitute the\nmind that has reached further meditative attainments known as formless\nstates; finally, there are eighteen world-transcending\n(lokuttara) consciousnesses that constitute the mind at the\nmoment of awakening itself: these have nirvana as their object. Within\nthese four broad categories many other classifications operate. For\ninstance, some dhammas are wholesome, others unwholesome;\nsome are resultant, others are not; some are motivated, others are\nwithout motivations. These attribute matrices, writes Cox (2004A,\n552), form \u201can abstract web of all possible conditions and\ncharacteristics exhibited by actually occurring dharmas. The\nindividual character of any particular dharma can then be\nspecified in accordance with every taxonomic possibility, resulting in\na complete assessment of that dharma\u2019s range of\npossible occurrences.\u201d\n\nVarious scholars have argued that this system reflects a dynamic\nconception of dharmas: that Abhidharma understands\ndharmas as properties, activities, or patterns of\ninterconnection that construct one\u2019s world, not as static\nsubstances (e.g., Cox 2004A, 549ff; Gethin 1992A, 149\u2013150;\nKarunadasa 2010, Ch. 4; Nyanaponika 1998, Ch. 2 & 4; Ronkin 2005,\nCh. 4; Waldron 2002, 2\u201316). The Abhidharma lists of dharmas are\n\u201cexplicitly open\u201d and reflect \u201ca certain reluctance\nand hesitancy to say categorically that such and such is the\ndefinitive list of dharmas\u201d (Gethin 2017, 252), leaving room for\ncontinued debates about what is and is not a dharma. For the\nAbhidharma, as for Buddhism in general, the limits of one\u2019s\nworld are set by the limits of one\u2019s lived experience, and the\ncausal foundation for lived experience is the operation of one\u2019s\ncognitive apparatus. According to the Buddhist path, the nature of\nlived experience as based on one\u2019s cognitive apparatus is to be\ncontemplated by investigating the very nature of one\u2019s mind\nthrough the practice of meditation. From this perspective, Abhidharma\nrepresents the theoretical counterpart to the practice of meditation.\nWithin this context of Buddhist practice, dharmas are\ndistinct (but interrelated) functions, energies, or causally\nsignificant aspects\u2014in this sense\n\u201ccomponents\u201d\u2014of consciousness moments.\n\nThe categorial analysis of dharmas is therefore a meditative\npractice of discernment of dharmas: it is not intended as a\nclosed inventory of all existing dharmas \u201cout\nthere\u201d in their totality, but rather \u201chas a dual\nsoteriological purpose involving two simultaneous processes\u201d\n(Cox 2004A, 551). First, as \u201cevaluative\u201d analysis, the\ndharma typology maps out the constituents and workings of the\nmind and accounts for what makes up ordinary wholesome consciousness\nas opposed to the awakened mind. For instance, consciousness types\nthat arise in a mind that has attained meditative absorption become\nincreasingly refined and may never involve certain tendencies or\ndefilements that might potentially occur in ordinary (even wholesome)\nconsciousness. To watch dharmas as dharmas, writes\nGethin (2004, 536), \u201cinvolves watching how they arise and\ndisappear, how the particular qualities that one wants to abandon can\nbe abandoned, and how the particular qualities that one wants to\ndevelop can be developed. Watching dhammas in this way one\nbegins to understand [\u2026] certain truths\n(sacca)\u2014four to be exact\u2014about these\ndhammas: their relation to suffering, its arising, its\nceasing and the way to its ceasing. And in seeing these four truths\none realizes the ultimate truth\u2014dhamma\u2014about the\n world.\u201d[9]\n\nThe second, \u201cdescriptive\u201d soteriological process involved\nin the categorization of dharmas reveals the fluid nature of\nsentient experience and validates the fundamental Buddhist teaching of\nnot-self (Skt., an\u0101tman, Pali, anatta). The\nincreasingly detailed enumerations of dharmas demonstrate\nthat no essence or independent self could be found in any phenomenon\nor its constituents, since all aspects of experience are impermanent,\narising and passing away subject to numerous causes and conditions.\nEven the handful dharmas that are categorized as\nunconditioned (that is, having no cause and no effect) are shown to be\nnot-self. The practice of the discrimination of dharmas thus\nundermines the apparently solid world we emotionally and\nintellectually grasp at that is replete with objects of desire and\nattachment. \u201cTry to grasp the world of the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i, or the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na,\u201d Gethin notes (1992B, 165),\n\u201cand it runs through one\u2019s fingers.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the very notion of the plurality of dharmas as\nthe building blocks or the final units of analysis of sentient\nexperience signifies a considerable shift in the Buddhist\nunderstanding of dharma. Abhidharma thought was gradually\ndrawn into espousing a naturalistic explanation of dharmas as\nthe fundamental constituents of the phenomenal world, increasingly\nassociating dharmas as primary existents. The category of the\nunconditioned within the dharma taxonomy also asserted the\npossibility of enduring or permanent dharmas, in contrast to\nall other dharmas that arise and cease through causal\ninteraction. The Abhidharma exegesis, then, occasioned among Buddhist\ncircles doctrinal controversies that could be termed ontological\naround such issues as what the nature of a dharma is; what,\nin the internal constitution of a dharma, makes it the very\nparticular it is; the manner of existence of dharmas; the\ndynamics of their causal interaction; and the nature of the reality\nthey constitute. The distinctive principles and their ensuing\nontological interpretations constructed by the Buddhist schools were\nlargely shaped by a radical construal of impermanence as\nmomentariness.\n3. Time: from impermanence to momentariness\n\nBoth the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the post-canonical Therav\u0101da\nconstructed a radical doctrine of momentariness (Skt.,\nk\u1e63\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, Pali,\nkh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da) that atomizes phenomena temporally\nby dissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events\nthat pass out of existence as soon as they have originated. Albeit not\na topic in its own right in the Buddha\u2019s discourses, the\ndoctrine of momentariness appears to have originated in conjunction\nwith the principle of impermanence (Skt., anitya, Pali,\nanicca). This idea is basic to the Buddha\u2019s\nempirically-oriented teaching about the nature of sentient experience:\nall physical and mental phenomena are in a constant process of\nconditioned construction and are interconnected, being dependently\noriginated (e.g., A I 286; M I 230, 336, 500;\nS II 26, III 24\u20135, 96\u20139, IV 214). The Suttanta\nelaboration on these three interlocking ideas results in a formula\n(A I 152) that states that conditioned phenomena (Skt.,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101, Pali,\nsa\u1e45kh\u0101r\u0101) are of the nature of origination\n(upp\u0101da), \u201cchange of what endures\u201d\n(\u1e6dhitassa a\u00f1\u00f1athatta), and dissolution or\ncessation (vaya). This formula is known as the \u201cthree\ncharacteristics of what is conditioned\u201d\n(tisa\u1e45khatalakkha\u1e47a). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika introduced four\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena: origination, endurance,\ndecay, and dissolution. These are classified under the dharma\ncategory of \u201cfactors dissociated from thought.\u201d\n\nThe Buddhist schools used the characteristics of conditioned phenomena\nas a hermeneutic tool with which to reinterpret impermanence in terms\nof momentariness. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nproposed a fully-fledged doctrine of momentariness according to which\nall physical and mental phenomena are momentary. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins use the term \u201cmoment\u201d\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47a) in a highly technical sense as the\nsmallest, definite unit of time that cannot be subdivided, the length\nof which came to be equated with the duration of mental events as the\nbriefest conceivable entities. There is no Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\nconsensus on the length of a moment, but the texts indicate figures\nbetween 0.13 and 13 milliseconds in modern terms (Gethin 1998, 221;\nvon Rospatt 1995, 94\u2013110). This usage presupposes an atomistic\nconception of time, for time is not reckoned indefinitely divisible.\nIndeed, the term k\u1e63a\u1e47a is often discussed in\njuxtaposition to the concepts of material atoms and syllables, which\nare likewise comprehended as indivisible.\n\nWithin the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, material reality\n(r\u016bpa-dharma) is reduced to discrete momentary atoms,\nand much attention is drawn to ontological and epistemological\nquestions such as whether sense objects are real at any time, or\nwhether atoms contribute separately or collectively to the generation\nof perception. Atomic reality is understood as constantly changing:\nwhat appears to us as a world made up of enduring substances with\nchanging qualities is, in fact, a series of moments that arise and\nperish in rapid succession. This process is not random, but operates\nin accordance with the specific capability and function of each atom.\nThe spirit of this atomistic analysis of material reality applies\nequally to mental reality: consciousness is understood as a succession\nof discrete consciousness moments that arise and cease extremely\n rapidly.[10]\n Thus, the ratio of change between material and mental phenomena in\nany given moment is one to one: they occur in perfect synchronicity\n(Kim 1999, 54). On this point the Sautr\u0101ntika agreed with the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that\nall things exist\u201d) were unique in their stance that the\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena exist separately as real\nentities within each moment. Their claim, then, is that all\nconditioned dharmas\u2014whether past, present, or\nfuture\u2014exist as real entities (dravyatas) within the\nspan of any given moment. This induced a host of problems, one of\nwhich is that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da definition of a moment is\ndifficult to reconcile with its conception as the shortest unit of\ntime (von Rospatt 1995, 44\u201346 & 97\u201398). The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da replies to this criticism by stating that the\nactivities (k\u0101ritra) of the four characteristics of\nconditioned phenomena are sequential: the limits between the birth and\ndissolution of any event are referred to as one moment. This solution,\nhowever, implies that a single event undergoes four phases within a\ngiven moment, which inevitably infringes upon its momentariness (Cox\n1995, 151; von Rospatt 1995, 52ff).\n\nThe Therav\u0101dins created their own distinct version of the\ndoctrine of momentariness. They do not seem to have been as concerned\nas the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins with the ontology and epistemology of\nmaterial and mental realities per se. Rather, they were more\npreoccupied with the psychological apparatus governing the process of\ncognizing of sense data, and hence with the changing ratio between\nmaterial and mental phenomena. The Yamaka of the canonical\nAbhidhamma offers what is probably the first textual occurrence of the\nterm \u201cmoment\u201d (kha\u1e47a) in the sense of a\nvery brief stretch of time that is divided into origination and\ncessation instants (Kim 1999, 60\u201361). Relying on the three\ncharacteristics of conditioned phenomena, the Pali commentaries later\npresent a scheme wherein each moment of every phenomenon is subdivided\ninto three different instants of origination\n(upp\u0101dakkha\u1e47a), endurance\n(\u1e6dhitikkha\u1e47a) and cessation\n(bha\u1e45gakkha\u1e47a) (Spk II 266;\nMp II 252). These are three phases of a single momentary\nphenomenon defined as one single dhamma or consciousness\nmoment. A dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second, and ceases in the third (Karunadasa 2010, 234ff). The\ncommentarial tradition thus analyzes phenomena temporally by\ndissecting them into a succession of discrete, momentary events that\nfall away as soon as they have originated in consciousness. As one\nevent is exhausted, it conditions a new event of its kind that\nproceeds immediately afterwards. The result is an uninterrupted,\nflowing continuum (sant\u0101na) of causally connected\nmomentary events. These succeed each other so fast that we conceive of\nthe phenomena they constitute as temporally extended.\n\nThe Therav\u0101dins use the term kha\u1e47a as the\nexpression for a brief instant, the dimension of which is not fixed\nbut may be determined by the context. For example,\ncittakkha\u1e47a refers to the instant taken by one\nmental event. In this basic sense as denoting a very brief stretch of\ntime, the term \u201cmoment\u201d does not entail an atomistic\nconception of a definite and ultimate, smallest unit of time, but\nleaves open the possibility that time is infinitely divisible (von\nRospatt 1995, 59\u201360 & 94\u201395). Here the three moments\nof origination, endurance, and cessation do not correspond to three\ndifferent entities. Rather, they represent three phases of a single\nmomentary phenomenon and are defined as one single consciousness\nmoment: a dhamma occurs in the first sub-moment, endures in\nthe second sub-moment and perishes in the third one. In this way, the\nTherav\u0101dins avoided some of the difficulties faced by the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, of how to compress the\ncharacteristics of the conditioned into one single indivisible moment\nand of how to account for their ontological status. The\nTherav\u0101dins also claimed that only mental phenomena are\nmomentary, whereas material phenomena (e.g., common-sense objects)\nendure for a stretch of time. The Therav\u0101din commentarial\ntradition subsequently elaborated on this proposition and produced a\nunique view of the ratio between material and mental phenomena,\nasserting that a material phenomenon lasts for sixteen or seventeen\nconsciousness moments (Kv 620; Vibh-a 25\u201328;\nVism XX 24\u201326; Kim 1999, 79\u201380 &\n\u00a73.1).\n\nDespite their different interpretations of the concept of\nmomentariness, the early Buddhist schools all derived this concept\nfrom the analysis of impermanence in terms of the dynamics of\ndharmas qua physical and mental events. The equation of a\nmoment with the duration of these transient events as extremely short\noccurrences\u2014even the shortest conceivable\u2014led to the\ndirect determination of the moment in terms of these occurrences. Yet\nthe doctrine of momentariness spawned a host of problems for the\nBuddhist schools, particularly with regard to the status of the\nendurance moment and to the explanation of continuity and conditioning\ninteraction among the dharmas (see section 5 below). If\ndharmas go through an endurance phase or exist as real\nentities within the span of any given moment, how can they be\nmomentary? And if experience is an array of strictly momentary\ndharmas, how can continuity and causal conditioning be\npossible?\n\nOne might argue that the conceptual shift from\n\u201cimpermanence\u201d to \u201cendurance\u201d is a result of\nscholastic literalism and testifies to the Abhidharma tendency towards\nreification and hypostatization of dharmas (Gombrich 1996,\n36\u201337, 96\u201397 & 106\u2013107). Nevertheless, the\nobject of the doctrine of momentariness is not so much existence in\ntime or the passage of time per se, but rather, in epistemological\nterms and a somewhat Bergsonian sense, the construction of temporal\nexperience. Instead of a transcendental matrix of order imposed on\nnatural events from without, time is seen as an inherent feature of\nthe operation of dharmas. The doctrine of momentariness\nanalyzes dharmas as they transpire through time: as\npsycho-physical events that arise and cease in consciousness and, by\nthe dynamics of their rise and fall, construct time. The sequence of\nthe three times is therefore secondary, generated in and by the\nprocess of conditioned and conditioning dharmas. In fact, the\nconceptual shift from the principle of impermanence to the theory of\nmomentariness is a shift in time scales. While the S\u016btr\u0101nta\nworldview interprets the three times as referring to past, present,\nand future lives, the Abhidharma sees them as phases that any\nconditioned dharma undergoes each and every moment.\nImpermanence marks dharmas over a period of time, but is also\nencapsulated in every single consciousness moment (Vibh-a\n7\u20138; Sv 991; Vism XIV 191; Collins 1992, 227).\n4. Intrinsic nature: between categorization and ontology\n\nTo preserve the principle of impermanence and explain continuity and\ncausal conditioning in ordinary experience, the Buddhist schools\nintroduced novel interpretations of the nature of dharmas. At\nthe heart of these interpretations is the concept of intrinsic nature\n(Skt., svabh\u0101va, Pali, sabh\u0101va) that plays\na major role in the systematization of Abhidharma thought, is closely\nrelated to the consolidation of the dharma theory, and is\nregarded as that which gave an impetus to the Abhidharma growing\nconcern with ontology.\n\nThe term svabh\u0101va/sabh\u0101va does not feature in the\ns\u016btras/suttas and its rare mentions in other\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da canonical texts offer no\naccount of dharma as defined by a fixed intrinsic nature that\nverifies its real\n existence.[11]\n This situation changes significantly in the post-canonical\nliterature, in which svabh\u0101va becomes a standard concept\nextensively used in dharma exegesis. A recurring idea in the\nexegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their\nsvabh\u0101va. For instance, a definition transmitted in the\nAbhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya reads:\n\u201cdharma means \u2018upholding,\u2019 [namely],\nupholding intrinsic nature (svabh\u0101va),\u201d and the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 states that \u201cintrinsic\nnature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it [\u2026]\nas in the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to\nuphold their own identity\u201d (Cox 2004A, 558\u2013559).\nSimilarly, a definition prevalent in Therav\u0101din Abhidhamma\ncommentaries is: \u201cdhammas are so called because they\nbear their intrinsic natures, or because they are borne by causal\nconditions\u201d (e.g., Dhs-a 39-40; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 18; Vism-mh\u1e6d I 347). The commentaries also regularly\nequate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabh\u0101va interchangeably. For\nexample, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that\n\u201cdhamma means but intrinsic nature\u201d\n(Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i indicates that \u201cthere is no\nother thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature\nborne by it\u201d and that \u201cthe term sabh\u0101va\ndenotes the mere fact of being a dhamma\u201d\n(Dhs-m\u1e6d 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch.\n1).\n\nThese commentarial definitions of dharmas as carrying their\nintrinsic natures should not be interpreted ontologically as implying\nthat dharmas are substances having inherent existence. The\nPali commentaries, cautions Gethin (2004, 533), \u201care often\nviewed too much in the light of later controversies about the precise\nontological status of dharmas and the Madhyamaka critique of\nthe notion of svabh\u0101va in the sense of \u2018inherent\nexistence.\u2019\u201d In fact, defining dharmas as bearing\ntheir intrinsic natures conveys the idea that there is no enduring\nagent behind them. Adding that dharmas are borne by causal\nconditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying\nsubstances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are\npsycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate\nconditions and qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on\nother conditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real\nthan they are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13\u201316;\nNyanaponika 1998, 40\u201341).\n\nWe must also note that the context within which dharmas are\nrendered in terms of their intrinsic natures is that of\ncategorization, where multiple criteria and qualities are applied to\ncreate a comprehensive taxonomic system that distinguishes the\nparticular character of any given dharma. Cox (2004A:\n559\u2013561) has shown that in the early period of northern Indian\nAbhidharma texts, as represented by the\n\u015a\u0101riputr\u0101bhidharma\u015b\u0101stra and\nportions of the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, the concept\nof intrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of\ninclusion (sa\u1e43graha), that is, the process by which the\ninclusion of dharmas within a specific category is to be\napplied. Dharmas are determined (parini\u1e63panna)\nby the intrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be\nconsidered to possess a separately existing intrinsic nature.\n\u201c\u2018Determination\u2019 implies two further features of\ndharmas [\u2026] First, just as categories in a\nwell-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to\nfluctuation, so also dharmas, as \u2018determined,\u2019\nare clearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely\nindividualized and as such are not subject to confusion with other\ndharmas. [Second,] determination by intrinsic nature\nundergoes no variation or modification, and hence, dharmas,\nwhich are in effect types or categories of intrinsic nature, are\nestablished as stable and immutable\u201d (ibid, 562). In\nthe early Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegetical texts, then,\nsvabh\u0101va is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion\ndetermining what a dharma is, not necessarily\nthat a dharma exists. The concern here is primarily\nwith what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather\nthan with the ontological status of dharmas.\n\nNevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature\nAbhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of\ndharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma\ncoincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term\nsvabh\u0101va, which is grounded logically and etymologically\nin the term bh\u0101va that came to denote \u201cmode of\nexistence\u201d (ibid, 565\u2013568). In the\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia and contemporaneous texts,\n\u201cthe explicit emphasis upon categorization per se\nrecedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character\nand eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas.\nAccordingly, the term svabh\u0101va acquires the dominant\nsense of \u2018intrinsic nature\u2019 specifying individual\ndharmas [\u2026] And determining individual\ndharmas through unique intrinsic nature also entails\naffirming their existence, as a natural function both of the\netymological sense of the term svabh\u0101va and of the role\nof dharmas as the fundamental constituents of experience.\nThis then leads to the prominence of a new term that expressed this\nontological focus: namely, dravya\u201d (ibid,\n569). Dravya means \u201creal existence\u201d and, within\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, dharmas that are\ndetermined by intrinsic nature exist as real entities\n(dravyatas), as opposed both to composite objects of ordinary\nexperience that exist provisionally and to relative concepts or\ncontingencies of time and place that exist relatively. The presence of\nintrinsic nature indicates that a dharma is a primary\nexistent, irrespective of its temporal status, namely, whether it is a\npast, present or future dharma, and hence the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da declaration that \u201call things\nexist.\u201d\n\nThe Therav\u0101da rejected the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological\nmodel, claiming that dhammas exist only in the present. But\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma shares with the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nthe same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory\nthat individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic\nfunction of sabh\u0101va gave rise to ontological\nconnotations of existence in the characterization of dhammas.\nAs the final units of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are\nreckoned the ultimate constituents of experience. \u201cThere is\nnothing else, whether a being, or an entity, or a man or a\nperson,\u201d a famous Pali commentarial excerpt proclaims\n(Dhs-a\n 155).[12]\n While this statement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalav\u0101da\nposition of the reality of the person by insisting that there is no\nbeing or person apart from dhammas, there emerges the idea\nthat the phenomenal world is, at bottom, a world of dhammas:\nthat within the confines of sentient experience there is no other\nactuality apart from dhammas and that what constitutes any\ngiven dhamma as a discrete, individualized particular is its\nintrinsic nature. The Therav\u0101da elaborates on the concept of\nsabh\u0101va in juxtaposition to its theory of momentariness,\nand it acquires the sense of what underlies a dhamma\u2019s\nendurance moment and as a point of reference to the moments of\norigination and cessation. Before a dhamma eventuates it does\nnot yet obtain an intrinsic nature and when it ceases it is denuded of\nthis intrinsic nature. As a present occurrence, though, while\npossessing its intrinsic nature, it exists as an ultimate reality and\nits intrinsic nature is evidence of its actual existence as such\n(Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII 234, XV 15). One commentarial\npassage even goes so far as naming this instant \u201cthe acquisition\nof a self\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d I 343).\n5. Causation: existence as functioning\n\nThe Abhidharma\u2019s ontological investigations occasioned a host of\ndoctrinal problems that became the subject of an ongoing debate among\nthe Buddhist schools. One primary controversy centered on the\nprinciple of impermanence: if all phenomena are impermanent, the\nSautr\u0101ntika challenged the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the\nTherav\u0101da, then dharmas must be changing continuously\nand can neither exist in the past and future nor endure for any period\nof time, however short, in the present. On the other hand, the\nsystematic analysis of experience in terms of momentary\ndharmas required the Abhidharma to provide a rigorous account\nof the processes that govern psychological and physical continuity.\nWhat fuels these processes is causal interaction, but the very notion\nof causation is allegedly compromised by the theory of momentariness.\nIf causes, conditions, and their results are all momentary events, how\ncan an event that has ended have a result? How can an event that\nundergoes distinct stages of origination, endurance, and cessation in\na brief moment have causal efficacy? Notwithstanding their doctrinal\ndifferences, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and the Therav\u0101da\nAbhidhamma had to confront these challenges, and they did so by\nformulating complex theories of immediate contiguity that grant causal\nefficacy.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da developed an analysis of causal\nconditioning in terms of intricate interrelations among four types of\ncondition (pratyaya) and six types of cause (hetu).\nAs documented in the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(AKB 2.49) based on canonical texts including the\nVij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya, the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da, and the\nJ\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na, the four conditions are: 1)\nroot cause (literally \u201ccause as condition,\u201d\nhetupratyaya), reckoned the foremost in inciting the process\nof fruition and origination; 2) immediate antecedent, which holds\nbetween a consciousness moment and its immediately preceding moment in\nthat consciousness series; 3) object support, which applies to all\ndharmas insofar as they are intentional objects of\nconsciousness; and 4) predominance, which facilitates sensory\ndiscriminative awareness, e.g., the faculty of sight\u2019s\npredominance over visual cognitive awareness. The six causes are: 1)\ninstrumentality (k\u0101ra\u1e47ahetu), deemed the primary\nfactor in the production of a result; 2) simultaneity or coexistence,\nwhich connects phenomena that arise simultaneously; 3) homogeneity,\nexplaining the homogenous flow of dharmas that evokes the\nseeming continuity of phenomena; 4) association, which operates only\nbetween mental dharmas and explains why the elements of\nconsciousness always appear as assemblages of mental factors; 5)\ndominance, which forms one\u2019s habitual cognitive and behaviorist\ndispositions; and 6) fruition, referring to whatever is the result of\nactively wholesome or unwholesome dharmas. The four\nconditions and six causes interact with each other in explaining\nphenomenal experience: for instance, each consciousness moment acts\nboth as the homogenous cause as well as the immediate antecedent\ncondition of the rise of consciousness and its concomitants in a\nsubsequent\n moment.[13]\n\nUnderlying this analysis of causal conditioning is the notion of\nexistence as efficacious action, or karma. Karma, a fundamental\nprinciple in Buddhist thought from its inception, is what fuels the\nrepetitive experience in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the round of\n rebirth.[14]\n In Abhidharma exegesis, the efficacious action or distinctive\nfunctioning of dharmas is understood predominantly as causal\nfunctioning. For the orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, the existence of\ndharmas as real entities (dravyatas) is determined\nby both their intrinsic nature and particular causal functioning.\nIntrinsic nature, however, is an atemporal determinant of real\nexistence. What determines a dharma\u2019s spatio-temporal\nexistence is its distinctive causal functioning: past and future\ndharmas have capability (s\u0101marthya) of\nfunctioning, while present dharmas also exert a distinctive\nactivity (k\u0101ritra). Present activity is an internal\ncausal efficacy that assists in the production of an effect within a\ndharma\u2019s own consciousness series. It is this activity\nthat determines a dharma\u2019s present existence and\ndefines the limits of the span of its present moment. Capability, by\ncontrast, is a conditioning efficacy externally directed towards\nanother consciousness series: it constitutes a condition that assists\nanother dharma in the production of its own effect (Cox\n2004A, 570\u2013573; Williams 1981, 240\u2013243). A\ndharma\u2019s present activity arises and falls away, but\npast and future dharmas all have potential for causal\nfunctioning and exist as real entities due to their intrinsic nature.\nFor the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, this model\u2014which insists on\nconstant change within the limits of the present moment and implies\nthe existence of dharmas in the three time\nperiods\u2014preserves both the principle of impermanence yet\nexplains continuity and causal efficacy.\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika distinction between a\ndharma\u2019s activity and capability implies that each\ndharma or consciousness moment effects the next moment within\nits series, but it can also act as a contributory condition towards\nproducing a different sort of effect. Activity engenders the next\nmoment within a dharma\u2019s series, while capability\ngenerates a different effect and explains the causal efficacy of past\ndharmas. Williams (1981, 246\u2013247) helpfully notes that\nwe may render this \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncausality, within a consciousness series and transcending it\nrespectively. For example, an instant of visual awareness horizontally\nproduces the next moment of visual awareness and may or may not,\ndepending on other factors such as light and so on, vertically produce\nvision of the object. \u201cIt follows that to be present is to have\nhorizontal causality, which may or may not include vertical\ncausality\u2014a fact which serves to remind us that we are dealing\nhere with primary existents which are frequently positioned within the\nsystem in terms of what they do\u201d (ibid). Thus activity\nor horizontal causality\u2014a dharma\u2019s function of\nprecipitating the next moment of its own consciousness\nseries\u2014individuates that dharma as a particular event\nof its kind. A dharma\u2019s capability or vertical\ncausality, by which it facilitates the occurrence of other\ndharmas outside its consciousness series, locates it within\nthe web of interrelations that connects it with the incessant rise and\nfall of other dharmas, and hence further individuates it as\nthat very particular dharma by manifesting its unique quality\nand intensity of operation.\n\nThe Satur\u0101ntika and the Therav\u0101da developed alternative\ntheories of causal conditioning in conjunction with their rejection of\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological model and their claim that\ndharmas exist only in the present. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nexplained causal interaction among past and future dharmas by\nreference to the idea of \u201cseeds\u201d (b\u012bja), or\nmodifications in subsequent dharma series. The\nSautr\u0101ntika theory of seeds is the precursor of two extremely\nimportant concepts of later Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thought,\nnamely, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s concepts of \u201cstore\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) and of\nBuddha-nature (tath\u0101gatagarbha) (Cox 1995, 94\u201395; Gethin\n1998, 222). The Therav\u0101da theory of causal conditioning, as set\nout in the Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, proposes a set of\ntwenty-four conditional relations (paccaya) that account for\nall possible ways in which a phenomenon may function in conditioning\nthe rise of another phenomenon. The twenty-four conditional relations\nare: 1) root cause (hetupaccaya); 2) object support; 3)\npredominance; 4) proximity; 5) contiguity; 6) simultaneity; 7)\nreciprocity; 8) support; 9) decisive support; 10) pre-existence 11)\npost-existence; 12) habitual cultivation; 13) karma; 14) fruition; 15)\nnutriment; 16) controlling faculty; 17) jh\u0101na \u2013 a\nrelation specific to meditation attainments; 18) path \u2013 a\nrelation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path; 19) association;\n20) dissociation; 21) presence; 22) absence; 23) disappearance; 24)\n non-disappearance.[15]\n The majority of the Therav\u0101da twenty-four conditions have\ncounterparts in the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da theory and both systems\nshow various other parallel interests and points of resemblance. The\nlikelihood, then, is that the two systems originated before the two\nschools separated and continued to evolve after their separation\n(Conze 1962, 152\u2013153; Kalupahana 1961, 173).\n\nTheir differences notwithstanding, both the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and\nthe Therav\u0101da theories of causal conditioning are based on the\nnotions that dharmas are psycho-physical events that perform\nspecific functions, and that to define what a dhamma is\nrequires one to determine what it does (Gethin 1992A, 150). It turns\nout, then, that the relative positioning of each dharma\nwithin a network of causes and conditions is, first and foremost, a\nmeans for its individuation. Only in a subsidiary sense is this\nnetwork an analysis of causal efficacy. What reappears here is the\ncategorial dimension of the dharma analysis qua a\nmetaphysical theory of mental events in terms of sameness of\nconditional relations. Analogous to the space-time coordinate system\nthat enables one to identify and describe material objects, the\nnetwork of conditional relations may be seen as a coordinate system\nthat locates within it any given dharma, implying that to be\na dharma is to be an event that has a place in that web of\nrelations\u2014an idea reminiscent of Donald Davidson\u2019s\nprinciple of sameness of causes and effects as a condition of identity\nof events (2001 119\u2013120 & 154\u2013161). Two\ndharma instances of the same type would fit into the web of\ncausal conditions in exactly the same way, but would then be\ndistinguished as individual instances on the grounds of their unique\ndegrees and modes of causal efficacy.\n6. Epistemology: Perception and the theory of the consciousness process\n\nIn attempting to account for what effects liberating insight and what\nmakes up the awakened mind, Abhidharma inquiries extended into the\nfield of epistemology. We have seen that the Abhidharma\u2019s\nanalysis of sentient experience reveals that what we perceive as a\ntemporally extended, uninterrupted flow of phenomena is, in fact, a\nrapidly occurring sequence of causally connected consciousness moments\nor cittas (i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncaitta/cetasika), each with its particular object. The mature\nAbhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of\nphenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly\ncomplex description of the consciousness process, dissolving the\ncausal relations between ordered successions of consciousness moments\ninto the activity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for\nthe Abhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory\nperception is the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like\nevery instance of consciousness, sensory perception is intentional,\nencapsulated in the interaction among the sense faculties, their\ncorresponding types of discriminative consciousness, and their\nappropriate sense objects. Different Buddhist schools, however, held\ndifferent positions on the distinctive nature of perceptual\nexperience, and on the specific roles of the sense faculties and\nstatus of sense objects in it. The Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma and the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika both espouse a view that\nproposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its\nsense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for\nwhat we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible\nqualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism\n(Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336).\n\nThe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the consciousness\nprocess (citta-v\u012bthi) in its commentaries and manuals,\nmainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th century CE), and\nAnuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier descriptions in\nthe Dhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Vism XIV 111\u2013124,\nXVII 126\u2013145; Dhs-a 82\u2013106 & 267\u2013287;\nVibh-a 155\u2013160; Abhidh-s 17\u201321). The\ntheory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the\nanalysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2.\nRather, in congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial\nor ontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as\nresulting from particular functions that are performed by the\neighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy.\nAccording to this analysis, the specific functions in the\nconsciousness flow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as\nthe normal flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up and\nputting down sense objects by means of successive sets of associated\nmental factors. The result is a fairly static account of mental and\nmaterial phenomena as they arise in consciousness over a series of\nconsciousness\n moments.[16]\n\nRestricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary\nbeings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes\n(pa\u00f1cadv\u0101ra) and mind-door processes\n(manodv\u0101ra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door\nprocesses may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account\nfor sensory perception as information is directly received from the\nfields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes\ninternalize the information received through the sense faculties and\ncharacterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects\nat the \u201cdoor\u201d of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist\nthought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future,\npurely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object\nat the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there\nis no perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep,\nthe mind is in a state of rest called inactive mode\n(bhava\u1e45ga). Throughout one\u2019s life, the same type\nof citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is\nthe natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its\ninactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory\noccurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields.\nThe simplest mind-door process is a succession of the following\nfunctions: 1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that\nlasts one moment and becomes internalized as an object support; 2)\nimpulsion: occurs for up to seven moments and performs the function of\nthe mind\u2019s responding actively to the object with wholesome or\nunwholesome karma; 3) retaining: holding on to the object of the\nconsciousness process for one or two moments.\n\nThe mind switches from its inactive mode to any of the five-sense-door\nprocesses when an object occurs at the \u201cdoor\u201d of the\nappropriate sense faculty. This process of sensory perception involves\na greater number of functions: 1) disturbed inactive mind: a function\nthat arises due to the stimulus of the sense object. It lasts for two\nmoments, during which sensory contact takes place, i.e., a physical\nimpact of the sense object on the physical matter of the appropriate\nsense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one moment, during which the mind\nturns towards the object at the appropriate sense \u201cdoor;\u201d\n3) perceiving: lasts one moment and is the sheer perception of the\nsense object with minimal interpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one\nmoment and performs the intermediary role of enabling transit to and\nfrom the appropriate discriminative consciousness, whether visual,\nauditory, etc.; 5) investigating: lasts one moment and performs the\nrole of establishing the nature of the sense object and of determining\nthe mind\u2019s response to that object that has just been\nidentified; 6) impulsion: same as in the mind-door process; 7)\nretaining: same as in the mind-door process. As an example, visual\nperception involves not only seeing itself, but also a succession of\nmoments of fixing of the visual object in the mind, recognition of its\ngeneral features, and identification of its nature. In both the\nmind-door and five-sense door processes, the sense faculty and its\nsense object condition the arising of a present moment of a\ncorresponding apprehending consciousness, that is, perception here is\nmodeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in both the mind-door and\nfive-sense door processes, when the retaining function ceases, the\nmind reenters its inactive mode.\n\nThe consciousness types that perform most of the functions that make\nup the mind-door and the five-sense-door processes fall into the\ncategory of resultant cittas, that is, those that are the\nresult of past actively wholesome or unwholesome consciousness. This\nmeans that the experience of the sense data presented to one\u2019s\nmind is determined by one\u2019s previous actions and is beyond of\none\u2019s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or\nconceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that\nis desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous\nwholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are\nundesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness\nrespectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process,\nwhen the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some\nway, actively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates\nand constitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma\nthus \u201cprovides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of\ndependent arising\u201d (Gethin 1998, 216).\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika proposes a similar\naccount of sensory perception, but argues that the sensory object\nexists as a real entity. The Sautr\u0101ntika theory of perception,\nhowever, is rather different. It rests on the Sautr\u0101ntika radical\nview of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration\nbut only a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of\ncausation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects\ncome into existence. The application of these principles to sensory\nperception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly\napprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when\ntheir apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautr\u0101ntika reply is\nthat consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects.\nBy contrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautr\u0101ntika view of\nperceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism:\nit sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the\nmediation of aspects (\u0101k\u0101ra) representative of\ntheir objects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380\u2013381).\n\nWhat is common to all the three main Abhidharma\ntraditions\u2014Therav\u0101da, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014is that they manifest a somewhat similar\nparadigm shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned\nworld into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was\npart of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain,\nand Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical\nquestions about the nature of the external world and the self, and\nfocused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language.\nTheir purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and\nmeans of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this\nepistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asa\u1e45ga and\nVasubandhu, the founders of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (400\u2013480 CE),\nand, most notably, Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti (around 500 CE)\nwho developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems\n(ibid, 15\u201319). The Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for\nthis epistemological turn. The new emphasis becomes dominant from the\nperiod of the vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward and is\nevident in a shift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to\ndescribe the nature of dharmas. This terminological shift is\nindicated by the terms \u201cparticular inherent\ncharacteristic\u201d (Skt., svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\nsalakkha\u1e47a) and \u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d\n(Skt., s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\ns\u0101m\u0101nyalakkha\u1e47a).\n\nThe term lak\u1e63a\u1e47a/lakkha\u1e47a means a mark, or\na specific characteristic that distinguishes an indicated object from\nothers. The Logicians use this term in the sense of\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of a concept or logical category. The\nAbhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of\ndharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic\ncharacteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas\nand (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a\ndharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any\nother instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus\nassimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with\nthat of intrinsic nature. \u201cDhammas,\u201d the\nTherav\u0101din commentarial literature states, \u201care so called\nbecause they bear their particular inherent characteristics\u201d\n(Vibh-a 45; Vibh-m\u1e6d 35; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic \u201cis\nthe intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other\ndhammas\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d II 137). Used in\nconjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular\ninherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma\u2019s unique\ndefinition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and\nlinguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance\nthat is defined by a distinct verbal description.\n\nThe Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 of the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika similarly distinguishes\nbetween a dharma\u2019s particular inherent and generic\ncharacteristics and identifies the former with intrinsic nature, thus\ndiscriminating \u201clevels in the apprehension or discernment of\ndharmas that serve to clarify the ambiguity encountered in\nthe application of the term svabh\u0101va to both individual\ndharmas and to categorial groups\u201d (Cox 2004A, 575). The\ndifference between the analytical description of dharmas in\nterms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox\n(ibid, 576), is that \u201cwhereas intrinsic nature acquires\nits special significance in the context of exegetical categorization,\nthe starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic\ncognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in\nterminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a\nconcurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an\nepistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively\ndetermined.\u201d This new epistemological emphasis looms in through\na modified definition of existence proposed by the mature\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegesis that sees the causal efficacy\nunderlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development\nin the history of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da thought is Sa\u1e45ghabhadra\n(fifth century CE), who states in his\nNy\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra: \u201cto be an object-field that\nproduces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of\nexistence\u201d (ibid). This means that dharmas as\nthe constituents of our experiential world are objectively\nidentifiable through cognition.\n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma project, as evident by the dharma\ntheory and its supporting doctrines, is, at bottom, epistemologically\noriented. Yet the project also intends to ascertain that every\nconstituent of the experiential world is knowable and nameable, and\nthat the words and concepts used in the discourse that develops around\nthe discernment of these constituents uniquely define their\ncorresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore paves\nthe way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the\nnotion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our concepts\nand statements, on the one hand, and the features of an independent,\ndeterminate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism does not\nnecessarily have implications for the ontological status of this\nreality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is to\nmake a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching that\npresents the Buddha\u2019s view of language as\n conventional.[17]\n",
