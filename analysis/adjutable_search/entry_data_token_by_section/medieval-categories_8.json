    "main_text": "Later Middle Ages || John Duns Scotus (b. ca. 1266, d. 1308)\n5.1 John Duns Scotus (b. ca. 1266, d. 1308)\n\n\nAccording to Scotus, neither the logician nor the metaphysician is\ncapable of showing that there are ten categories. There are in fact ten\ncategories, but any attempt to prove that there are only ten is faulty.\nIn his Questions on the \u201cMetaphysics,\u201d he puts it\nthus: \u201cThe various ways for showing the sufficiency of the\ncategories [so far] all seem to err in two ways\u201d (Scotus 1997, V,\nq. 5\u20136, n. 73). The first error consists in the attempt to try to\nprove that there are ten and only ten categories, for such a proof does\njust the opposite. According to Scotus, purported demonstrations of ten\ncategories rely upon an initial division of predication into two basic\nclasses: predicates that indicate a \u201cbeing in itself\u201d and\npredicates that indicate a \u201cbeing not in itself.\u201d But this\nimplies that there are only two ultimate genera of being, not ten.\nIndeed, if one were to accept that the modes of predication and the\nmodes of being correspond to each other, as those who try to derive the\nnumber of categories from the modes of predication do, then one must\nconclude that there are only two categories\u2013\u2013substance and\naccident, respectively\u2013\u2013not ten. For the two most basic\nkinds of predication are either \u201cbeing in a subject\u201d or\n\u201cnot being in a subject.\u201d\n\n\nThe second error, Scotus argues, is begging the question. Any\nattempt to demonstrate that there are only ten categories presupposes\nthe very thing to be demonstrated, namely, that there are ten and only\nten categories. \u201cAll these ways of dividing do not prove [the\nproposal], for one would have to prove that what is divided is thus\ndivided, and precisely in this way, and this to the issue at hand,\nnamely, that the dividends constitute these most general\n[categories]\u201d (ibid., n. 75).\n\n\nEven though Scotus does not believe that it can be demonstrated that\nthere are only ten categories, he accepts that there are in fact only\nten categories of being (Pini 2005). Clearly, for him, reality (the\nactual number of categories) and what we know about them (what we can\ndemonstrate about them) do not correspond to each other. The\ncategories, as distinct kinds of things, are diverse from each other\nand this diversity entails that there is nothing from which we can\nestablish their number. As Pini notes, \u201c[e]ven when Scotus comes\nto think that being is a univocal concept, he will always make clear\nthat there is no one real mode of being corresponding to that concept\nfrom which the different categories can be derived. Metaphysically\nspeaking, there are ten irreducible essences, even though they can be\nunderstood under a common concept\u201d (Pini 2003, 13). Scotus'\nview of categories reveals that he does not accept the isomorphism\nbetween thought and reality common among medieval authors before him.\nFor him, however, the inability to deduce the number of categories is\nonly one of the ways in which signifying, understanding, and being are\nnot demonstrably isomorphic.\n\n\nA second difference between the order of being (reality) and the\norder of signifying (language) is revealed by the process known as\n\u201ccontraction.\u201d In the conceptual order, a thing is\ncontracted from its genus to its species by a differentia that\ndistinguishes the species from other kinds within a genus. For example,\nthe genus \u201canimal\u201d is contracted to the species\n\u201cman\u201d by the differentia \u201crational,\u201d\nthus setting human beings apart from other kinds of animals. In the\norder of reality, however, being is not contracted to any of the ten\ngenera, because \u2018being\u2019 does not have the same meaning when\napplied to every category. The ten highest genera have nothing in\ncommon with each other other than the fact that they are called\n\u2018being\u2019 (Pini, 2005). However, insofar as the user of the\nterm is concerned, \u2018being\u2019 can be contracted to one of the\ncategories, for when one says \u2018being in itself,\u2019 one\nintends to signify substance, even though in the order of reality no\nsuch contraction occurs. This difference between reality and thought\nlies at the heart of Scotus' doubt concerning the possibility of\nderiving the number of categories.\n\n\nAnother example may help clarify the difference between the two\norders. Say that the word \u2018John\u2019 signifies at least two\npersons: John Scotus and John Eriugena. This means that when one uses\nthe word \u2018John\u2019 to refer to these two persons, it is used\nequivocally, for there is nothing common to both Scotus and Eriugena\nthat is signified by the term. Nevertheless, by adding a surname to\n\u2018John,\u2019 say \u2018Scotus,\u2019\nthe name is contracted to \u2018John Scotus\u2019 as opposed to\n\u2018John Eriugena.\u2019 Now, when a nature (e.g., man) is\ncontracted in the extra-mental order to Scotus or Eriugena, the\nnature, as it exists, is really contracted, but when \u2018John\u2019\nis contracted by the addition of \u2018Scotus,\u2019 the nature is\nnot contracted, only the utterance is. It is in this latter way, Scotus\nargues, that the expressions \u2018being absolute\u2019 or\n\u2018being per se\u2019 contract \u2018being\u2019 to a\nsubstance in the conceptual order, for this contraction is based on the\nintent of the speaker, not on what is signified (i.e., not on the\nextra-mental order).\n",
