    "main_text": "The Psychology of the Oppressor\n4. The Psychology of the Oppressor\n\nWhile there has been some feminist writing to date on the psychology\nof the oppressor, Robin Dillon calls for much more work in this area\n(Dillon 2012). In particular, Dillon urges that feminists develop what\nshe calls \u201ccritical character theory,\u201d a way of theorizing\ncharacter from a feminist perspective (85). Such a theory recognizes\nthat domination and subordination operate not just at the political\nand social levels, but through character. Among the things it asks is\nwhether certain traits might contribute to or undermine oppression. It\nis particularly concerned to speak to vice, which Dillon believes is\nfor the most part left out of moral theories. Knowing about vice is\nnot only intrinsically important, but it is important for how we raise\nour children and develop their moral characters, especially in regard\nto enabling them to combat oppression (91\u201392). A feminist moral\ntheory should examine how systematic oppression reflects and\nreinforces domination values, and how it normalizes and buttresses\nvice in members of dominant groups (94). It should also suggest how we\nmight repair character damage, not just externally, by making\nsystematic changes, but internally too. Dillon suggests that it might\nbe the case that repairing character is a necessary condition or at\nleast an effective way of transforming unjust social conditions like\noppression.\n\nDillon agrees with Lisa Tessman that oppression fosters certain vices\nin the privileged, including arrogance, self-centeredness,\ncallousness, indifference, and social irresponsibility, and adds that\nit damages the characters of those who perpetrate or are complicit in\noppression, and it does so in ways that the benefits of privilege do\nnot outweigh (96). Tessman argues that under oppression, the self can\nbe damaged in such a way that it cannot flourish (Tessman 2005, 4).\nShe develops the notion of \u201cburdened virtues,\u201d virtues one\nhas that are cultivated in an oppressive context. The privileged,\nparticularly ones who culpably passively accept their privilege, if\nnot positively endorse it, exhibit the \u201cordinary vices of\ndomination\u201d which prevent them from flourishing in spite of\nbenefiting. Aside from the vices already mentioned, the privileged\noften exhibit a lack of certain moral virtues, including compassion\nfor others not in their group, generosity, cooperativeness, and\nopenness to appreciating others (55). While the privileged can\nflourish among the privileged, and in this way meet Aristotle\u2019s\ncriteria for eudaimonia, they cannot flourish on a conception of\neudaimonia that reflects the fact of social inequality. Tessman argues\nthat moral goodness requires not only a pursuit of one\u2019s own\nwell-being and the well-being of others on whom one depends, as\nAristotle believes, but also the well-being of others whose lack of\nwell-being may have been a condition of one\u2019s privilege (76).\nTessman\u2019s attention to vice in the context of oppression is\nexactly the kind of work that Dillon believes might be essential in\nending oppression, and Dillon\u2019s own work on arrogance is likely\nto be followed by feminist progress in this area (Dillon 2004).\n\nBoth Dillon and Tessman are rejecting ideal theory as an approach to\ntheorizing character. According to Charles Mills, who also rejects it,\nideal theory represents the actual as a simple deviation from the\nideal that is not worth theorizing in its own right, or it falsely\nstates that starting from the ideal is the best way of realizing the\nideal (Mills 2005, 168). The problem is that ideal models abstract\naway in a problematic way from realities that are crucial to\nunderstanding injustice, such as structural domination, exploitation,\ncoercion, and oppression (170). In so doing, ideal theory represents\nthe experiences of the dominant group only, and thus serves their\ninterests (172). But since ethics is supposed to be about how actual\npeople act, and since ideal theory does not reflect the experiences of\nsubordinate groups, it is not the best way of doing ethics.\nTessman\u2019s work on \u201cimpossible cases\u201d critiques ideal\nmoral theory on the grounds that it fails to capture moral dilemmas\nwhich involve non-negotiable moral requirements which are grounded in\ninnate values such as love and life that cannot be unproblematically\ncompromised (e.g., killing your crying baby in order to protect a\ngroup from the Nazis) (Tessman 2017). We can imagine feminist cases of\nthis phenomenon, such as killing a rapist in order to protect your\ndignity.\n\nDillon\u2019s call for more work in critical character theory\nnotwithstanding, there is some earlier literature that is either\nexplicitly feminist or that can be used by feminists that speaks to\nthe psychology of members of the dominant group, men, who act in\nsexist ways, thereby contributing to women\u2019s oppression.\nFeminists and their supporters have offered explanations for how a\nsexist comes to be, examining in particular the role that a bad\nsociety, corrupt socialization, and the adoption of patriarchal values\nand beliefs play in his development. They have also attempted to\nexplain the underlying motivation in a person who engages in sexist or\nracist behavior that contributes to the oppression of a group.\n\nLaurence Thomas offers an account of how a society in which there is a\ngeneral lack of trust that others will not harm a person can make a\nperson come to cultivate indifference to harming others, if not worse\n(1996). Thomas\u2019s account can be applied to sexist forms of evil,\nor, immorality. He believes that society is adversely affected by the\nwide-scale absence of goodwill among its members, and that\ngame-theoretic models for social cooperation as offered by\ncontemporary moral and political theorists that do not acknowledge\nmotivation cannot accommodate this shortcoming (272). Thomas considers\nthe Golden Rule, which dictates that you \u201cDo unto others as you\nwould have them do unto you.\u201d He claims that rather than comply\nwith this rule out of fear, which shows a lack of respect for others,\nwe should comply in ways the rule was intended, out of the\nother-regarding motive of not wanting to cause another harm or\nsuffering, a feeling that is generated both by our own experience of\nbeing harmed and from the nature of human beings in general. For\ninstance, those who have this other-regarding motive will know what it\nis like to experience the moral pain of being a victim of a racial\nepithet, which should suffice to prevent him or her from using a\nracial epithet against others. In a moral climate, a person is more\nlikely to have this other-regarding sentiment, but in a society where\ntrust that others will not harm us is lacking, we are likely to lose\nit and develop virtue-derailing sentiments, first becoming indifferent\nto harming others, then morally numb, then eventually evil beings.\n\nThomas suggests that there is a parallel between the family structure\nand society with respect to the failure to develop the moral\nsensibilities that the Golden Rule calls for (273). It is only through\nparental love (or the love of parental surrogates), Thomas believes,\nthat self-love is securely underwritten (279). The child who is loved\nby his parents can first come to see himself as having intrinsic\nvalue, which is the basis for self-love. Self-love, in turn,\nunderwrites the other-regarding sentiments. Thomas is not suggesting\nthat all children who come from abusive homes will lack\nother-regarding sentiments and become evil persons, but instead is\nsaying that other-regarding sentiments have a more difficult time\ngaining a secure foothold in children in abusive homes than in loving\nones (281). This is because the abused child is typically consumed\nwith when and how he will be abused and how he will cope, his own\nwell-being and survival, and developing virtue-derailing motives, such\nas bitterness, rancor, and a desire for vengeance, which are at odds\nwith other-regarding sentiments. Thomas believes that in a similar\nway, a society where trust (that others who can harm us will not) is\nlacking impedes a person\u2019s having other-regarding sentiments\ntoward strangers that is called for by the Golden Rule. If we live in\na society in which we lack trust in others that they will not harm us,\nour concern with whether our own actions will not harm others will be\nsubstantially weakened, leading to indifference toward harming others,\nor, moral numbness. If the moral climate in society becomes bad\nenough, it will give rise to bitterness, rancor, and a desire for\nvengeance (285). Thomas believes that when we are the object of\nsystematic hostility, presumably the kind associated with systematic\nracism and sexism, a natural reaction on our part is to develop\nhostility, bitterness, and rancor. Although Thomas does not link his\ndiscussion to the cultivation of sexists per se, other philosophers\nwriting about evil, including feminists writing especially about the\nevil of oppression, explain the immoral character of members of the\ndominant group who act in sexist or racist ways toward those in\nsubordinate groups, by displaying indifference to their humanity, or,\nthe intrinsic value they have in virtue of being persons, as will be\ndiscussed later in this section (see also Section 3.1).\n\nLarry May is a feminist who has written specifically about the role of\nmale socialization in the cultivation of sexist attitudes and\nbehaviors in men. In one of his articles, May examines the\nsocialization practiced by formerly all-male military institutions\nsuch as the Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute (1998b). These\ninstitutions practice separatism in order to establish a male culture\nand instill traditional male values without pressure from the outside,\nparticularly from women. They are formed as places for boys to become\nmen or to prove they are men, perpetuating a form of masculinity\nsupported by other all-male sports settings, all-male clubs, and so on\n(117). In these military institutional settings, the conditions are\nstark, the quarters are tight and lack privacy, and the cadets are\nconsidered to be mere \u201crats,\u201d not unique persons deserving\nof respect, and are forced to suffer mental stress, punishment, even\nbeatings. The point of such treatment is for the cadets to develop\nself-discipline and spirit thought necessary for leadership skills and\ncharacter, to form a sense of bonding with fellow sufferers and former\ntormenters, and to channel young male aggression (118).\n\nThe problem, though, according to May, is that this training\nbackfires, and male aggression gets re-directed especially toward\nwomen: when the cadets think of themselves as \u201crats,\u201d\nrather than as persons deserving of respect, it is only a small step\nto thinking that women, who are generally portrayed as even less\ndeserving than themselves, are less than rats and beneath contempt\n(129). Men who go through this military training have trouble\ncontaining their aggression in simulated combat situations at least\npartly because when aggression is deemed acceptable, this sometimes\nmakes it more likely that a man will display more and stronger\naggression than would otherwise be the case (132). And sometimes the\nfact that this training forbids the cadets to show any aggression\ntoward the upperclassmen who verbally or physically assault them can\nbackfire, and they display heightened aggression to their peers or to\nwomen in the context of civilian life (132). May argues that the male\nvalues protected by these military institutions are ones that have\nhistorically produced hatred and abuse toward women (121). Not only in\nthe military, but in civilian life, male aggression is channeled in\nways that are not necessarily respectful of women, such as intense\npursuit of protection and support for family. This\n\u201cbreadwinner\u201d role is often linked with a view of men as\ndominant over women in family life (133). In another article, May\nargues that practices like sexual harassment promote male solidarity\nthat keeps women in an inferior position and excludes them from full\nand equal participation (1998a, 105). Posting a Playboy centerfold in\na common area of a workplace contributes to a form of male bonding\nthat makes females feel unwelcome; it is a signal to any woman who\nenters the room that women are to be viewed as comparable to the woman\nin the picture, not welcome in this location as an equal to men. She\nis excluded for the reason that she is a woman, not for any\nidiosyncratic reason (1998a, 106). Women\u2019s exclusion builds male\nsolidarity. The same kind of bonding and exclusion may go on in the\nprofessions, especially ones where women are currently significantly\nunderrepresented (see Kaufman 1999, 199\u2013201; Valian,1999;\nSuperson 2002). These forms of socialization and practices at least\npartly explain why some members of the dominant group men develop\nsexist characters or act in sexist ways.\n\nFeminists have also attempted to explain what it is about a\nperson\u2019s motivations or attitudes that prompt him to engage in\nsexist behavior. Several feminists writing about various explicitly\nsexist behaviors attribute the behaviors to the person\u2019s\nendorsing sexist stereotypes. Kathleen Waits describes the\nwoman-batterer as endorsing traditional sex roles, believing that the\nman should be \u201cthe master\u201d of the house and that it is the\nwoman\u2019s job to satisfy all his needs and wants (1993, 193). The\nbatterer often projects a macho exterior, has a tremendous need to\ndominate and control his wife, and believes that he has the right to\nuse violence against her in order to enforce his will (193). Susan\nGriffin cites studies and social data describing the convicted rapist\nas having, on a statistical average, a normal sexual personality,\ndiffering from the normal, well-adjusted male only in having a greater\ntendency to express violence and rage (1981, 318). The rapist endorses\nstereotypical views about male dominance and female submission, which\nGriffin notes are the same views erotically expressed in the practice\nof heterosexual love in our culture. According to our culture\u2019s\nheterosexual norms, male eroticism is wedded to power, and the man\nmust demonstrate his superior strength with gestures of dominance\nwhich are perceived as amorous (317\u2013318). One reason the courts\nhave had a hard time distinguishing consensual sex from rape is that\nthe same gender stereotypes that are present in \u201cnormal\u201d\nheterosexual sex are present in rape, though in rape they are carried\nto more violent extremes. The practice of female genital mutilation,\nor FGM, also reflects the acceptance of sexist stereotypes about male\ndominance and female submission. Although FGM is typically carried out\nby female relatives or a midwife, the whole society, particularly its\nmale leaders, are the ones who set the social norms. We might think of\nthe women who perform the procedure as vessels through which the real\nproponents of the practice act. Semra Asefa argues that FGM has long\nbeen justified by the belief that women are unable to control their\nown sexuality in the face of their strong desire for sex (1994 and\n1998, 98). The practice of FGM aims to diminish or destroy the\nwoman\u2019s capacity for sexual enjoyment, making her into a\nbreeding machine to perpetuate her husband\u2019s line. Cultures that\npractice FGM often also require domestic confinement as another\nelement of the husband\u2019s control, and include severe punishment\nof women for adultery, while encouraging males to be polygamous\nbecause it is believed that a man\u2019s virility increases\nproportionately with the number of children he has (99). The practice\nof FGM reflects the view that men are dominant in that they control a\nwoman\u2019s capacity to have sex for pleasure and whether she has a\nchoice to have sex with men other than her husband (see Nussbaum\n1999b).\n\nCentral to the stereotypes of male dominance and female submission is\nthe notion that men are superior in worth, and women, inferior. Jean\nHampton offers a feminist analysis of what goes on with the sexist\nimmoralist who targets a person in virtue of her group membership\n(1999). Hampton defines a wrongful action as one that is disrespectful\nof a person\u2019s value, conveying the view that the wrongdoer is\nsuperior in value to his victim. A wife abuser sends the message that\nhis wife has the value of chattel; a rapist conveys the attitude that\nwomen are even lower than chattel, as mere objects to be used whenever\nthe male feels the need to do so (134\u2013135). Indeed, Hampton\nargues, rape harms all women, not just its direct victim, by aiming to\nestablish men\u2019s mastery over women: \u201cAs a woman, you are\nthe kind of human being who is subject to the mastery of people of my\nkind,\u201d and that \u201cYour kind isn\u2019t the equal in worth\nof my kind\u201d (135). Rape, on the Kantian view Hampton favors,\nattempts to lower, or \u201cdiminishes,\u201d the intrinsic value\nall humans have in virtue of being rational and autonomous beings,\nthough Hampton agrees with Kant that a person\u2019s intrinsic value\ncan never actually be lowered. Thus, the motivation of the rapist and\nother sexists who commit wrongful actions against their victims is\nthat they lack respect for women as persons having intrinsic\nvalue.\n",
