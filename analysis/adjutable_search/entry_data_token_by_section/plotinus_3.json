    "main_text": "Beauty\n4. Beauty\n\nPlotinus\u2019 chronologically first treatise, \u2018On Beauty\u2019 (I\n6), can be seen as parallel to his treatise on virtue (I 2).  In it,\nhe tries to fit the experience of beauty into the drama of ascent to\nthe first principle of all.  In this respect, Plotinus\u2019 aesthetics is\ninseparable from his metaphysics, psychology, and ethics.\n\nAs in the case of virtue, Plotinus recognizes a hierarchy of beauty.\nBut what all types of beauty have in common is that they consist in\nform or images of the Forms eternally present in Intellect (I 6. 2).\nThe lowest type of beauty is physical beauty where the splendor of the\nparadigm is of necessity most occluded.  If the beauty of a body is\ninseparable from that body, then it is only a remote image of the\nnon-bodily Forms.  Still, our ability to experience such beauty serves\nas another indication of our own intellects\u2019 undescended character. We\nrespond to physical beauty because we dimly recognize its paradigm.\nTo call this paradigm \u2018the Form of Beauty\u2019 would be\nsomewhat misleading unless it were understood to include all the Forms\ncognized by Intellect.  Following Plato in Symposium, Plotinus\ntraces a hierarchy of beautiful objects above the physical,\nculminating in the Forms themselves.  And their source, the Good, is\nalso the source of their beauty (I 6. 7).  The beauty of the Good\nconsists in the virtual unity of all the Forms.  As it is the ultimate\ncause of the complexity of intelligible reality, it is the cause of\nthe delight we experience in form (see V 5. 12).\n",
