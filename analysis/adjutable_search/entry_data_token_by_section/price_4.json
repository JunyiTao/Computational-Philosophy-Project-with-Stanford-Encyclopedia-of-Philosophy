    "main_text": "Four General Features || Commonsense\n2.3 Commonsense\n\nThird, Price defends the authority of commonsense as \u201cthe\nstarting-point of all philosophy\u201d (1930b: 202), extending\nMoore\u2019s (1925) defence (see 1930b: 198f), generally using it as\na methodological touchstone. He frequently objects to criticism of\ncommon thinking from science: because science relies on\nordinary thinking and experience, such criticisms undermine themselves\n(e.g., 1930b: 198; 1932: chapter 2). He also identifies this\n\u201cfallacy\u201d in anti-commonsense, genetic debunking arguments\nand Bergsonian arguments that commonsense is practically biased\n(1930a: 34\u201335). Furthermore, Price tends to say that our\ncognitive practices and nature simply have to be accepted for what\nthey are. Of paramount importance is the existence of what he calls\nthe \u201cinner life\u201d, involving toothaches, dreams, and mental\nimages (1959c: 481\u2013482; 1964c: 7; 1969: 295; he cites this as\none of Wittgenstein\u2019s 1953 main themes, too; see also Kneale\n1994: xvii). According to him, the contemporary attack on the\n\u201cinner life\u201d has \u201cgone a long way towards a kind of\n\u201cdehumanisation\u201d of man\u201d (1959c: 482).\n\nFinally, commonsense guides which topics he focuses on. For instance,\nhis famous discussion of the metaphysics of properties focuses on\nAristotelian universals in things (in rebus) rather than\nPlatonic universals anterior to things (ante rem) not because\nhe thinks the latter is unimportant but because \u201cit is more\nremote from common sense and our ordinary everyday habits of\nthought\u201d (1953a: 10; this responds to Findlay\u2019s 1954: 71\ncriticism).\n",
