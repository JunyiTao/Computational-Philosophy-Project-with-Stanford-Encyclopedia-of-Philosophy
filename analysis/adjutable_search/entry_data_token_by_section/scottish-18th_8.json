    "main_text": "Smith on moral sentiments\n9. Smith on moral sentiments\n\nReid and Hume both owed an immense debt to Hutcheson. So also did Adam\nSmith (1723\u20131790) who, unlike the others, studied under\nHutcheson at Glasgow University. In 1751 Smith was appointed to the\nchair of logic and rhetoric at Glasgow and the following year\ntransferred to the chair of moral philosophy that Hutcheson had\noccupied. Smith\u2019s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of\nthe Wealth of Nations appeared in 1776. Essays on\nPhilosophical Subjects appeared posthumously in 1795. He also\npublished an essay on the first formation of languages, and student\nnotes of his lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres, and on\njurisprudence have survived. But much his most important work in\nphilosophy is the Theory of Moral Sentiments which appeared\nin 1759 and of which six authorised editions appeared during\nSmith\u2019s lifetime. The second and sixth editions contain\nsignificant revisions and additions. Smith sets out to provide a\ntheory that will address the weaknesses of existing systems of moral\nphilosophy (critcised in Part VII of the Moral Sentiments).\nHe does so by rejecting attempts to reduce morality to a single\nprinciple and instead seeks to provide an account of the operation of\nordinary moral judgment that recognises the central role of\nsocialisation.\n\nThe concepts of sympathy and spectatorship, central to the doctrine of\nTMS, had already been put to work by Hutcheson and Hume, but\nSmith\u2019s account is distinct. As spectator of an agent\u2019s\nsuffering we form in our imagination a copy of such \u2018impression\nof our own senses\u2019 as we have experienced when we have been in a\nsituation of the kind the agent is in: \u201cwe enter as it were into\nhis body, and become in some measure the same person with the\nagent\u201d (Smith 1790, p. 9). Smith gives two spectacular examples\nof cases where the spectator has a sympathetic feeling that does not\ncorrespond to the agent\u2019s. The first concerns the agent who has\nlost his reason. He is happy, unaware of his tragic situation. The\nspectator imagines how he himself would feel if reduced to this same\nsituation. In this imaginative experiment, in which the spectator is\noperating on the edge of a contradiction, the spectator\u2019s idea\nof the agent\u2019s situation plays a large role while his idea of\nthe agent\u2019s actual feelings has a role only in that the\nagent\u2019s happiness is itself evidence of his tragedy. The second\nof Smith\u2019s examples is the spectator\u2019s sympathy for the\ndead, deprived of sunshine, conversation and company. Again Smith\nemphasises the agent\u2019s situation, and asks how the spectator\nwould feel if in the agent\u2019s situation, deprived of everything\nthat matters to people.\n\nSmith relates sympathy to approval. For a spectator to approve of an\nagent\u2019s feelings is for him to observe that he sympathises with\nthe agent. This account is used as the basis of the analysis of\npropriety. For a spectator to judge that an agent\u2019s act is\nproper or appropriate is for him to approve of the agent\u2019s act.\nThe agent\u2019s act lacks propriety, in the judgment of the\nspectator, if the spectator does not sympathise with the agent\u2019s\nperformance.\n\nPropriety and impropriety are based on a bilateral relation, between\nspectator and agent. Smith attends also to a trilateral relation,\nbetween a spectator, an agent who acts on someone, and the person who\nis acted on, the \u2018recipient\u2019 of the act. There are several\nkinds of response that the recipient may make to the agent\u2019s\nact, and Smith focuses on two, gratitude and resentment. If the\nspectator judges the recipient\u2019s gratitude proper or appropriate\nthen he approves of the agent\u2019s act and judges it meritorious,\nor worthy of reward. If he judges the recipient\u2019s resentment\nproper or appropriate then he disapproves of the agent\u2019s act and\njudges it demeritorious, or worthy of punishment. Judgments of merit\nor demerit concerning a person\u2019s act are therefore made on the\nbasis of an antecedent judgment concerning the propriety or\nimpropriety of another person\u2019s reaction to that act. Sympathy\nunderlies all these judgments, for in the cases just mentioned the\nspectator sympathises with the recipient\u2019s gratitude and with\nhis resentment. He has direct sympathy with the affections and motives\nof the agent and indirect sympathy with the recipient\u2019s\ngratitude; or in judging the agent\u2019s behaviour improper the\nspectator has indirect sympathy with the agent\u2019s resentment\n(Smith 1790, p. 74).\n\nWe have supposed, in each of these cases, that the recipient really\ndoes have the feeling in question, whether of gratitude or resentment.\nHowever, in Smith\u2019s account the spectator\u2019s belief about\nwhat the recipient actually feels about the agent is not important for\nthe spectator\u2019s judgment concerning the merit and demerit of the\nagent. The recipient may, for whatever reason, resent an act that was\nkindly intentioned and in all other ways admirable, and the spectator,\nknowing the situation better than the recipient does, puts himself\nimaginatively in the shoes of the recipient while taking with him into\nthis spectatorial role information about the agent\u2019s behaviour\nthat the recipient lacks. The spectator judges that were he himself in\nthe recipient\u2019s situation he would be grateful for the\nagent\u2019s act; and on that basis, and independently of the\nrecipient\u2019s actual reaction, he approves of the agent\u2019s\nact and judges it meritorious. Here the spectator considers himself as\na better (because better informed) spectator of the agent\u2019s act\nthan the recipient is.\n\nAs regards judgments of merit and demerit, Smith sets up a model of\nthree people, but the three differ in respect of the weight that has\nto be given to their work, for the recipient does almost nothing. He\nis acted on by the agent, but apart from that he is no more than a\nplace holder for the spectator who will imaginatively occupy his shoes\nand make a judgment concerning merit or demerit on the basis solely of\nhis conception of how he would respond to the agent if he were in the\nplace of the recipient. He does not judge on the basis of the actual\nreaction of the recipient, who might approve of the agent\u2019s act\nor disapprove or have no feelings about it one way or the other.\n\nUp to this point we have attended to the spectator\u2019s moral\njudgment of the acts of others. What of his judgment of his own acts?\nIn judging the other the spectator has the advantage of disinterest,\nbut he may lack requisite information and much of the work of creative\nimagination goes into his rectifying the lack. In judging himself he\nhas, or may be presumed to have, the requisite information but he has\nthe problem of overcoming the tendency to a distorted judgment caused\nby self-love or self-interest. He must therefore factor out of his\njudgment those features that are due to self-love. He does this by\nsetting up, by an act of creative imagination, a spectator, an\nother who, qua spectator, is at a distance from\nhim.The point about the distance is that it creates the possibility of\ndisinterest or impartiality, but it is still necessary to ask how\ndisinterest or impartiality is achieved if it is the agent himself who\nimagines the spectator into existence.\n\nLet us move to an answer by wondering who or what it is that is\nimagined into existence? Is it the voice of society, representing\nestablished social attitudes? At times in the first edition of The\nTheory of Moral Sentiments Smith comes close to saying that it\nis. In the second edition Smith is clear that this is not the role of\nthe impartial spectator for the latter can, and occasionally does,\nspeak against established social attitudes. Nor can the judgment of\nthe impartial spectator be reduced to the judgment of society, even\nwhere those two judgments coincide. Nevertheless the impartial\nspectator exists because of real live spectators. Were it not for our\ndiscovery that while we are judging other people, those same people\nare judging us, we would not form the idea of a spectator judging us\nimpartially.\n\nSmith\u2019s account of justice is built upon his account of the\nspectator\u2019s sympathetic response to the recipient of an\nagent\u2019s act. If a spectator sympathises with a recipient\u2019s\nresentment at the agent\u2019s act then he judges the act\ndemeritorious and the agent worthy of punishment. In the latter case\nthe moral quality attributed to the act is injustice. An act of\ninjustice \u201cdoes a real and positive hurt to some particular\npersons, from motives which are naturally disapproved of\u201d (Smith\n1790, p. 79). Since a failure to act justly has a tendency to result\nin injury, while a failure to act charitably or generously does not, a\ndistinction is drawn by Smith, in line with Humean thinking, between\njustice and the other social virtues, on the basis that it is so much\nmore important to prevent injury than promote positive good that the\nproper response to injustice is punishment, whereas we do not feel it\nappropriate to punish someone who does not act charitably or\ngratefully. In a word, we have a stricter obligation to justice than\nto the other virtues.\n\nThough there are important points of contact between Smith\u2019s\naccount of justice and Hume\u2019s, the differences are considerable,\nchief of them being the fact that Hume grounds our approval of justice\non our recognition of its utility, and Smith does not. We do sometimes\ntake it into account in coming to a judgment, but more often than not\nit is something of a quite different nature that wells up in us:\n\u201cAll men, even the most stupid and unthinking, abhor fraud,\nperfidy, and injustice, and delight to see them punished. But few men\nhave reflected upon the necessity of justice to the existence of\nsociety, how obvious soever that necessity may appear to be\u201d\n(Smith 1790, p. 89). There are a few cases where utility is plainly\ninvolved in our judgment, but they are few, and they are in a distinct\npsychological class. Smith instances the sentinel who fell asleep\nwhile on watch and was executed because such carelessness might\nendanger the whole army. Smith\u2019s comment is: \u201cWhen the\npreservation of an individual is inconsistent with the safety of a\nmultitude, nothing can be more just than that the many should be\npreferred to the one. Yet this punishment, how necessary soever,\nalways appears to be excessively severe. The natural atrocity of the\ncrime seems to be so little, and the punishment so great, that it is\nwith great difficulty that our heart can reconcile itself to it\u201d\n(Smith 1790, p. 90). And our reaction in this kind of case is to be\ncontrasted with our reaction to the punishment of \u2018an ungrateful\nmurderer or parricide\u2019, where we applaud the punishment with\nardour and would be enraged and disappointed if the murderer escaped\npunishment. These very different reactions demonstrate that our\napproval of punishment in the one case and in the other are founded on\nvery different principles.\n\nSmith extends the discussion of merit and demerit into a naturalised\naccount of the development of religious belief. In his Essays on\nPhilosophical Subjects Smith provides an account of early\nreligious belief as a precursor to science and philosophy. In the\ncase of both, the desire to explain the world is driven by anxiety\ncreated through novel experience. Here the appeal to heaven is a\npsychological coping mechanism that we develop to address injustices\nthat go unrecognised in this world. Smith then argues that our views\non the rules of justice more generally come to be associated with\nreligion and this lends a further social sanction to morality.\n",
