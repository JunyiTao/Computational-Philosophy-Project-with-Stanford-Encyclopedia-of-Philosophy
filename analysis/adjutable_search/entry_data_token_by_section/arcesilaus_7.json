    "main_text": "The practical criterion || The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n5.1 The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nProponents of the NRNB view take the argument of Plutarch\nto give a general theory of action that supports universal\nsuspension of judgment as a natural reaction to equally balanced\narguments. On this theory all actions are merely impulsive, i.e.,\ncaused just by impressions of what appears suitable\n(\u2018oikeion\u2019). Since the skeptic doesn\u2019t make\njudgments, the only sense in which she is committed to her impressions\nis that she acts on them. It is unclear how this is compatible with the\nevidence of Sextus on \u2018the reasonable\u2019, where the skeptic\nconsiders reasonable justifications in deciding what to do. But some\nadvocates of NRNB combine the two so that a class of impulsive\nactions count as voluntary if, after their performance, one can\nreasonably justify them as successful (e.g., Ioppolo 1981; 1986; 2000).\n\n\nEven allowing for this attenuated sense of the voluntary, it is\nunclear why Arcesilaus would come to accept this impulsivist theory of\naction, if it were true: since\u2014as the theory\nmaintains\u2014theory doesn\u2019t inform action, it is difficult to\nexplain theoretical commitments solely in terms of what appears suited\nto an agent (see Maconi 1988, Trabattoni 2005, and Vezzoli\n2016). An NRNB reading of \u2018the reasonable\u2019\ntherefore concedes that Sextus may have elided important details (see\nIoppolo 2018).\n",
