    "main_text": "\n\nMetaphysics is the study of the basic structure of reality, of what\nthere is and what it is like. It considers, for example, concepts such\nas identity, causation, substance, and\nkind, that seem to be presupposed by any form of inquiry; and\nit attempts to determine what there is at the most general level. For\nexample, are there minds in addition to bodies? Do things persist\nthrough change? Is there freewill or is all action determined by prior\nevents? But since metaphysics not only concerns itself with what there\nis (ontology), but also the nature of that which exists,\nmetaphysicians ask, for example, whether numbers, if they exist, are\ndependent upon human thought and practices in some way, whether the\nconcepts and categories we use to think of and describe reality\ninfluence or determine in any way what is described, and whether and\nhow values are embodied in our categories and descriptions. It should\nthus not come as a surprise that there could be a specifically\nfeminist metaphysics, where the question of prime importance is to\nwhat extent the central concepts and categories of metaphysics, in\nterms of which we make sense of our reality, could be value laden in\nways that are particularly gendered.\n\nIn this way, feminist theorists have asked whether and, if so, to what\nextent our frameworks for understanding the world are distorting in\nways that privilege men or masculinity. What, if anything, is eclipsed\nif we adopt an Aristotelian framework of substance and essence, or a\nCartesian framework of immaterial souls present in material bodies?\nAnd is what\u2019s left out of such frameworks relevant to the\ndevaluation or oppression of women? Feminists have also considered the\nstructure of social reality and the relationship between the social\nworld and the natural world. Because social structures are often\njustified as natural, or necessary to control what\u2019s natural,\nfeminists have questioned whether such references to nature are\nlegitimate. This has led to considerable work on the idea of social\nconstruction and, more specifically, the social construction of\ngender.\n",
