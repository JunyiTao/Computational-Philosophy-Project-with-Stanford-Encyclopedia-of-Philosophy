    "main_text": "\n\nWhy should philosophers pay attention to microbes? Many philosophical\ntopics seem quite obviously unmicrobial, insofar as they\nfocus on issues concerning human capacities, activities, and\ninterests. Even philosophers of biology used to focus almost\nexclusively on animals, meaning that the field neglected many lineages\nof life. But redressing that imbalance is underway, and fungi and\nplants as well as microbes are receiving some attention in philosophy\nof biology. However, such topics are a minority interest in philosophy\nat large, where the focus is mostly (if not exclusively) on humans and\nour minds, worldviews, reasoning, and other endeavors. Microbes are\nminute and mindless, which makes them hard to appreciate without a\nmicroscope. Nevertheless, paying attention to microbes is justified in\nbroader philosophy of science as well as other general philosophical\nfields.\n\nThe entry begins with a discussion of the biology and biological uses\nof microbes, before expanding into more generally philosophical\ndomains, which we discuss in detail in Sections 2\u20135:\n\n Microbes carry out the bulk of biological activities on the\nplanet. They were the Earth\u2019s first lifeforms, and lie at the\nbase of every major transition to new forms of life.\n Microbiology is a science that has given rise to modern medicine,\nmolecular biology, genomics, molecular evolution, and numerous other\nfields, all of which generate rich philosophical\ndiscussion.\n Microbes have capacities to be used as material models of general\nphenomena in experimental settings.\n Contemporary microbiome research shows how microbes and\nmicrobiology can inform broader philosophical discussions about human\nnature, individuality, and causality, among other topics.\n\n",
