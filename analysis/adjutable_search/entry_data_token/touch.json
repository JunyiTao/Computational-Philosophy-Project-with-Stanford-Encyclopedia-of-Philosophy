Background and Terminology\nTouch is a fundamental form of non\u2013visual perception, one\nthat plays a crucial role in nearly all of our sensory experiences (a\nfeature noted by Gibson 1966). It is, unlike many of the other senses,\nmore plausibly taken to be inherently multisensory, given the\ndiversity of its constituent systems and forms of experience. In\naddition, it seems to have unique and philosophically interesting\nconnections to exploratory action and bodily awareness.\nBefore turning to these issues, it will be helpful to provide some\nbackground on the terminology typically used to talk about\ntouch. These are standard terms used in both philosophy and cognitive\nscience, and they are (for the most part) neutral ways of talking\nabout the diverse constituents involved in typical touch\nexperiences.\nWhat we typically refer to as \u201cthe sense of touch\u201d is\nwhat we will call \u201cactive\u201d or \u201chaptic\u201d\ntouch. This refers to touch that involves some movement. This movement\ncan be voluntary, exploratory movements of the hands and other sensory\nsurfaces involved in touch, or it can also refer to experiences\ngenerated by objects moving against a stationary body. In most cases,\nhaptic touch will involve the engagement of kinesthesis (awareness of\nmovement) and proprioception (awareness of bodily position). Some\napply the term \u201chaptic\u201d for any touch that involves the\nactivation of (the physiologically and functionally distinct)\nkinesthetic or proprioceptive systems (e.g., Loomis and Lederman\n1986). Touch mediated entirely through the skin will be referred to as\n\u201ccutaneous touch\u201d. The term \u201ctactual\u201d will be\nused as a broad term to refer to any form of touch experience (so\nit\u2019s used in the same way that \u201cauditory\u201d and\n\u201colfactory\u201d are used for hearing and smell ). For the\nfeatures and objects made available through touch the term\n\u201ctangible\u201d will be used (again, in the same way as\n\u201cvisible\u201d is used for for features and objects made\navailable by vision).\n2. Is Touch Multisensory?\nTouch is often classified as one of the traditional five senses,\nalong with sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Touch is, in several\nways, seemingly different from these other senses, however. For one\nthing, touch does not seem to have a single sense organ. The skin, of\ncourse, is the most plausible candidate sensory organ, but the skin\nitself is not sensory. Instead, the skin contains many different\nsensory systems. Many of them, like those that code for pain and itch,\ndo not seem to be tied directly to the sense of touch. For instance,\nwe don\u2019t, at least in most contexts, seem to treat cutaneous\npains as part of the sense of touch proper. The same seems\ntrue for itch, tingles, and twinges, though perhaps these seem more\nclosely tied with touch. At any rate, they are not paradigm instances\nof tactual perception, and if they seem more closely tied to touch,\nthen this is something in need of explanation.\nEven if we focus only on those systems usually associated with\ntouch, we find a number of distinct sensory channels. Some of these\nhave proven incredibly difficult to isolate and study (see e.g., the\nhistorical discussion in Gallace and Spence 2014). Indeed, we are just\nnow starting to understand the role and function of the most basic\nreceptor types involved in touch. Another methodological challenge, to\nwhich we\u2019ll return, concerns the deep connection between touch\nand exploratory action (nicely summarized in Jones and Lederman\n2006). For touch, many of the historically important empirical\ninvestigations have focused on cutaneous touch, especially on mapping\nthe two\u2013point threshold over the extent of the body. This\nthreshold is the minimal distance at which a subject can discriminate\ntwo distinct stimuli. Its study requires subjects to remain completely\nstill, while very small probes (like horse hair) are used to generate\nstimuli. It is much more difficult to measure touch in ecologically\nsalient contexts where there are unconstrained movements using the\nwhole body.\nThis raises some interesting questions about what counts as the\nsense of touch. There have been various attempts to define touch. One\nattempt concludes that the typical means of unifying the systems\ninvolved in touch fail to give anything like a coherent account. The\nconclusion is that:\n[T]his leaves us with something so heterogeneous\n that no criteria can unite its various characteristics and at the\n same time exclude characteristics of other senses. \n (Ratcliffe 2012: 3)\nThese discussions reveal the depth and difficulty of the\nproblem. Here are some reasons why the issue is so difficult. At the\nphysiological level, the afferent nerve channels that carry\ninformation about thermal properties are very similar to those that\ncode for pain and itch, and they also differ significantly from those\ninvolved in the coding of pressure, shape, and vibration (for some\nempirical background, see Lumpkin and Caterina (2007); for important\nrecent caveats, see Saal and Bensmaia (2014)). In other words, thermal\nchannels are physiologically and functionally more similar to the\nnociceptive channels involved in pain than they are to the channels involved in\ndiscriminative touch (Schepers and Ringkamp 2010). And yet thermal\nawareness is often considered part of touch, indeed, it has often been\nthought of as one of the central aspects of touch. Pains, on the other\nhand, are almost never considered part of touch.\nIsolating touch on physiological and functional grounds is thus\ndifficult. In addition, there is the problem that haptic touch\ninvolves many essential receptors that are located in the muscles,\njoints, and tendons, and not in the skin at all. Since these receptors are\nalmost always thought to be involved in coding for touch, there is the\nadditional problem that even the rich set of receptors in the skin are\nnot the only ones involved in typical touch experiences.\nGiven these facts, touch cannot be associated solely with the skin\nin any simplistic way. The skin contains a heterogeneous set of\ndistinct receptor populations, and these populations differ in their\nphysiological and functional properties. In addition, our ways of\nclassifying elements as part of touch don\u2019t seem sensitive to\nany of these differences in obvious ways. It thus seems clear that the\nsense of touch isn\u2019t simply that form of perceptual awareness\nconstituted by signals made available through the receptors in our\nskin.\nPerhaps because of this functional physiological diversity, the\ndominant view of touch in the recent cognitive science literature has\ntypically treated touch as inherently multisensory rather than a\nsingle unified modality like vision and audition (for examples and\ndiscussion, see Loomis and Lederman 1986; Fulkerson 2011; Gallace and\nSpence 2014; Jones and Lederman 2006; Linden 2015).\nWork in philosophy on the individuation of the senses has often\nfound touch to be a difficult case. This often has little to do with\nthe physiological and functional diversity alluded to above. Even if\nwe focus only on the phenomenological features of tactual perception,\nor on the typical objects of tactual awareness, touch seems to possess\na diversity that resists any single unified account. Aristotle noted\nthat touch, unlike the other dominant modalities, seemingly lacked a\nsingle \u201cproper sensible\u201d (for a recent empirical\ntreatment, see Kung 2005).  On this account, a proper sensible is a\nsensory feature only available in a single modality, one that was\nconstitutive of that modality (Marmodoro 2014). For\nvision color is the proper sensible. Any experience of color\nis visual, since no other modality provides awareness of that\nfeature. The proper sensibles were contrasted with the common sensibles\nfound in more than one modality. Touch doesn\u2019t have a single\nplausible proper sensible. Instead it has multiple potential proper\nsensibles, including pressure and temperature. This too might be a\nstrong reason for treating touch as a collection of distinct senses\nrather than a single modality.\nThe question of how to individuate sensory modalities has recently\nbeen of central importance in philosophy. In what follows, we will\nbriefly consider a few key accounts and how they might apply to the\nsense of touch.\nOne approach is to treat the individual sensory\nmodalities as specialized informational channels or \u201croutes\ninto\u201d an organism (Keeley 2002). According to this criterion, touch would\nagain seem to count as a collection of multiple sensory modalities,\nsince touch involves a number of distinct informational channels. They\ndiffer in the nature of the stimuli they are sensitive to, the nature\nof their activation profiles and functional properties, and even in\ntheir evolutionary \nhistory.[1]\n Another plausible view that in many ways is more amenable to\nunifying the sense of touch is to treat sensory modalities as a\nconventional kind, something we make use of but that isn\u2019t defined\nentirely by the relevant sciences (Nudds 2003). If this is right,\nthen we shouldn\u2019t expect there to be some underlying\nphysiological unity or connection that grounds our conception of\ntouch. Instead, we use the talk of sensory modalities to mark what a\nsubject might know on the basis of the experience. On this account,\nwhat we call the sense of touch is that form of awareness that\ntypically provides awareness of an object\u2019s weight, texture, and\ntemperature, etc. Learning that Anna touched the vase conveys\nthe information that she was in a position to become aware of the\nwarmth and solidity of the vase, among the other typical tangible\nproperties.\nWe could also reject entirely the idea that we can adequately\nclassify the senses along any single dimension. Instead, we could\nclassify the senses using all of the available criteria, constructing\na multidimensional space of possible sensory modalities (Macpherson\n2010). On this account, touch would be classified according to its\ntypical sensory organs, its representational content, the physical\nstimuli to which it is sensitive, and its phenomenal character. On\nthis view, human touch would seemingly occupy a larger expanse of\nmodality space than the other major human senses. This would probably\nreveal one kind of major difference in kind between human touch and\nthe other sensory modalities.\nAnother option is to argue that, while touch does have a disunified\nand heterogeneous functional and physiological profile, this is also\nlargely true of the other sensory modalities. What each of the\nsystems that seem to be unisensory have in common then isn\u2019t\nunity in any of the major criteria listed above (physiology, content,\nstimuli, etc.). Instead, it could be that each of the diverse\nsystems involved in human touch function together to connect or bind\nsensory features together (Fulkerson 2014c). This binding thesis suggests one way in\nwhich the diverse systems involved in touch might hang together, even\nif there is no single dimension on which touch is always unified.\n3. Touch and the Other Senses\nIn addition to its own constituent systems, touch interacts with\nother modalities in interesting ways. This is important in the history\nof philosophy especially because the most discussed interaction, or\npotential interaction, concerned the connection between touch and\nvision. Both senses bring information about shape and size and\nlocation, but they seem to do so in very different ways. The central\nquestion has long been the nature and strength of these\ndifferences.\nThis question has received the most attention in large part because\nof Molyneux\u2019s famous letter to Locke (see the entry on\n Molyneux\u2019s problem).\n Molyneux asked whether whether a subject born blind\ncould, upon complete restoration of sight, tell a cube from a sphere\n(a difference learned through touch) using sight alone. This raises\nmany questions about the transferability and connection between the\nspatial representations made available in touch and vision. There are\nmany assumptions underlying Molyneux\u2019s question, which have long\nbeen investigated by philosophers and psychologists (Evans 1985;\nCampbell 1996; Hopkins 2005).\nIn addition, there has been considerable discussion of how touch\nand vision might differ in terms of their spatial features. Vision, it\nseems, provides a rich felt awareness of objects in a spatial\nfield\u2013an area where there are potential objects but where none\ncurrently reside (that is, we seem in vision to be able to see empty\nspace). Touch, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t seem to present\nfeatures in this way. Instead, like audition, touch seems only to\nbring awareness of individual objects that each seem to occupy a\nspecific location.\nThe relation between touch and agency reveals more interesting\nareas for further investigation. In particular, it seems plausible\nthat the sense of touch has a closer connection to our agential\nactions. This is partially a result of the fact that touch seems to\nrequire active exploratory movements, and these movements are often\nguided and voluntary. Given these close\nconnections, it is probably not surprising that touch has such a close\nconnection to agency.  One could even use of this close connection\nbetween touch and agency to address epistemological problem of\nperception (see Smith (2002), and the entry on the\n problem of perception). When\nwe press against a solid object, the resistance to our agential act of\npressing gives our experience a more solid epistemic foundation than\nwhat we experience through the other sensory modalities. Only in touch do we\nseem to come into direct contact with reality, a reality that actively\nresists our voluntary actions.\nPhilosophers have also been interested in the relation between\ntouch and other sensory modalities. It seems plausible to think that\ntouch, unlike vision, does not have a full, 3-dimensional sensible\nfield in external space. Instead, touch seems confined to the limits\nof the body, and so the tangible field is, unlike in the other\nmodalities, defined by the limits and extent of the surface of the\nbody. Fardo et al (2018) offer a plausible empirical model for how this limited surface could generate rich spatial awareness. This supposed difference in the nature of their spatial awareness marks a clear structural difference between touch and\nvision, even when they represent the same sets of objective\nfeatures. Similarly, one could claim that touch also differs from the\nother senses in always involving bodily awareness\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 1989). Externally\u2013directed touch awareness\non such a view would only be made possible against a background of\nbodily awareness. This sort of view has been labeled \u201cthe\ntemplate view\u201d (Scott 2001).\n4. Tangible Qualities\nAny discussion of a perceptual modality often turns to the nature\nof the perceptual qualities or features made available by that\nmodality. A discussion of vision, for instance, naturally leads to\nmetaphysical questions about the nature of the colors. A discussion of\naudition similarly would bring up questions about the nature of\nsounds. Touch is unique in this respect, however, since there has been\nlittle philosophical investigation of the nature of tangible\nqualities.\nOne exception, already noted above, concerns the thermal qualities\nof hot and cold. But even here, little attention has been paid to the\nmetaphysical nature of these qualities. This is understandable, given\nthat touch seems to bring us into contact with ordinary material\nobjects and their properties. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any\nserious worries about the nature of solidity, texture, vibration, and\nthe like. There is an important question about the structure of felt\ntangible qualities, however. How are these ordinary tangible features\nrepresented or experienced?\n One possibility is that, ultimately, all of the tangible\nqualities, with the exception of hot and cold, can be reduced to the\nspatial properties of objects (Armstrong 1962). Such a view could be \nconnected to recent work on the spatial content of touch (for instance, \nviews like those explored in Fardo et al 2018). Defending such a\nreductive claim involves making an important distinction\nbetween transitive and intransitive bodily\nsensation. The transitive sensations are those like warmth and\npressure that have a sensory component as well as a real world\nproperty. Intransitive sensations do not have any\nnon\u2013sensational real world feature. This is one way to separate\nout pains, twitches, and tingles from perceptual touch proper. The\nspatial view then states that nearly all of the objective tangible\nfeatures made available through transitive sensation are relational\nspatial properties. On this relational view of touch, all immediate\ntactual perception involves a relation holding between our body and\nobjects in contact with it. A rough surface is one that is solid, has\nhardness, and a certain uneven shape. A smooth surface only differs in\nhaving a regular shape. Roughness and smoothness can be analyzed in\nterms of shape. A hard object is one that does not change its shape. A\nsoft object changes its shape under pressure. Liquidity is defined as\nhaving a particular shape in particular circumstances. Pressure plays\na role here, so the view also requires a spatial account of\npressure. One possibility is that pressure is a quality that has a\ntendency to cause a change in the shape of the body. Stickyness could\nbe when something remains in contact with the same spot on the skin,\nslippery things do not. Despite the possibilities for reduction here,\nmany of these moves feel ad hoc and unsupported by the empirical\nevidence. A better account is needed.\nA more recent view holds that tangible qualities are best\nunderstood as intensive features that vary in intensity along\na single dimension of variation (Fulkerson 2014b). When we feel\nvibration, for instance, it seems to increase in intensity (in this\ncase, in frequency) along a single qualitative dimension. This seems\nto be true of most tangible features. They are not typically complex,\nbut simples that vary along a single dimension. This view accords well\nwith the empirical data and offers a unified explanation for the\nstructural connections between an otherwise disjoint collection of\nsensory features. One worry for this view, however, again concerns our\nawareness of hot and cold. Variations in intensity alone do not seem\napt for capturing the nature of hot and cold experiences (see\nbelow). Rather than varying along a single dimension, our experiences\nof hot and cold seem to vary in intensity in two directions around a\nneutral point (Gray 2012). Cold experiences are those that vary away\nfrom neutral in one direction; our experiences of warmth vary away\nfrom neutral in the other (increasing) direction. More importantly, it\nseems the nature of these movements depends more on changes in our\ncurrent bodily state than the objective measures of temperature. So\nonce again, thermal properties seem to pose additional difficulties\nnot faced by other tangible qualities.\n5. Thermal Awareness\nPhilosophers have long been interested in the thermal system. As\nnoted above, thermal properties are difficult to connect with other\ntangible features for both spatial and intensity views. On either view,\nit seems difficult to make sense of the unique structure and bodily\nrole played by our thermoreceptive systems. One possibility for this\ndifficulty may be due to the fact that thermal properties\nare secondary qualities. A secondary quality is one that (in\nsome manner) crucially depends on our subjective awareness.\n  \nThe idea is that out in the world there really is no such thing as\n\u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d. Instead, there are only\ndiffering amounts of temperature or mean kinetic energy. We feel\nsomething much more structured than this through our skin (a fact most\nkeenly developed in Gray 2012). We feel objects as very cold, to cool,\nand then on to neutral, and only within a fairly narrow total\nrange. After this neutral point, objects take on an entirely different\ncharacter, and start to feel warm, followed by hot (again, up to a\nlimit). This space of thermal awareness involves a kind of inversion\nthrough a neutral point. But this neutral point is unique to human\nexperience; there is no neutral point in the temperature taken\nobjectively. More importantly, the temperatures that we typically feel\nas neutral depends on the context and especially on the current\nthermal conditions of our body and sensory surfaces.\nThis presents something of a problem for our naive conception of\nthermal awareness. We generally tend to think that our awareness of\nhot and cold provides objective or at least useful information about\nactual temperature. We use it to check baby bottles, determine if the\nheater is on, and make sure the bath isn\u2019t going to scald us. If\ninstead, thermal awareness only gives us awareness of a purely\nsubjective experience only loosely connected with temperature, then it\nseems thermal awareness isn\u2019t quite what we generally take it to\nbe. A warm stimuli feels cold when our bodies are already heated, but\nit feels hot when our bodies are in a cold state. This difference can\nbe experienced at once by simultaneously heating one hand in hot water\nand cooling another in an ice bath, and exposing them both to a\nneutral water bath. The same water will feel hot and cold at the same\ntime.\nThermal awareness, and its unsteady connection to objective\ntemperature, has been used to argue that sensory systems generally\naren\u2019t in the business of (only) conveying objective sensory\ninformation (Akins 1996). Instead, it seems to only convey\ninformation about our current bodily state (Craig 2002). If this is\nright, then it might explain some well\u2013known but puzzling\nphenomena, such as metal feeling cool to the touch, and wood feeling\nwarm, even when they are of the same objective temperature. It also\nexplains our different levels of thermal awareness for body parts at\ndifferent temperatures.\n6. Touch and Bodily Awareness\nThe sense of touch is closely connected to bodily awareness. This\nconnection is seemingly much stronger than what we find in the other\nsenses (though this is somewhat controversial, as we\u2019ll see).\nThis close connection is easy to understand. Whenever we touch, and\nespecially when we engage in active or haptic touch, we are\nforced to use our bodies. Setting aside the worries discussed above\nabout defining the organ of touch, there is some truth to the claim\nthat we touch with our whole body. After all, we touch using our skin,\nmuscles, joints, and we can touch using nearly every surface along the\nwhole body.[2]\nArmstrong\u2019s view, discussed above, suggested that touch was\nalways a felt relation between our bodies and some objective feature\nconnected directly to us.\nOne possibility is that the sense of touch, while distinct from\nproprioception, nevertheless always involves it (O\u2019Shaughnessy\n1998, 2000; Ratcliffe 2008). Since proprioception is nothing other\nthan awareness of the location and orientation of our own bodies,\nthere is a strong sense in which touch nearly always involves\nawareness of the body. Citing groundbreaking work on the relation\nbetween tactual and bodily awareness by Merleau-Ponty (2002), Gibson\n(1966), and Martin (1992), Ratcliffe (2012) offers a detailed overview\nof the ways in which touch seems to bring both an awareness of things\nexternal to the body and of the body itself.  The body is that by\nwhich we measure the features of things in the external world, and so\nis always present in our awareness of things through touch. There are\nmany reasons for thinking of this connection as relatively weak. There\nare plausible examples, like playing sports or quickly touching\nobjects, where we seem to have external awareness through touch but no\ndirect bodily awareness (Scott\n2001).[3]\nMattens (2017) has argued that philosophers have typically focused too\nmuch on external objects and object perception in their work on touch. The fine-grained\nmanipulation and exploration of objects with human hands is not, according\nto Mattens, the best way to think about touch. Instead, tactile awareness serves \nprimarily as a kind of protective signaling system that warns about incoming threats (cf. the Bodyguard Hypothesis defended by De Vignemont 2018).\nOn this view, touch is primarily about bodily awareness, about what is happening with\nand to our bodies, and only derivatively about the nature of external object.\n Another possibility is that, while touch indeed involves bodily\nawareness, the nature and structure of this awareness is importantly\ndifferent from what we see in typical cases of mediated\nperception. Touch does not involve awareness of the body as a part of\nsome external feature (as in other cases of mediated perception) nor\ndoes it involve any explicit cognitive attitude. Instead, it could be\nthat some bodily sensation is necessary for tactual perception\n(Richardson 2011). This view has the advantage both explaining why\ntouch necessarily involves bodily awareness but also why it differs\nfrom more typical cases of mediated perception. In particular, it\ndiffers from the template view by dropping any requirement for a\nmatching of spatial or other contents between the tactual perception\nand the bodily awareness. For this reason, it more easily accommodates\nextended touch.\nExtended touch, or awareness of distal objects and features through\na cane or other tool, can be used to argue for a related but distinct\nview of the relation between perceptual touch and bodily awareness\n(Fulkerson 2012). That we experience through touch objects and\nfeatures located some distance from the body raises questions about\nthe mediating role of bodily awareness. Given the nature of extended\ntouch, it seems implausible to hold that there is anything like a\nmatching of the contents of perceptual touch (or the features made\navailable through touch) with the content or features involved in the\nbodily awareness. Instead, perceptual touch seems to depend on bodily\nawareness informationally. The idea is that both bodily\nawareness (proprioception and kinesthesis especially) and\ndiscriminative touch make use of the very same sensory\ninputs. Perceptual touch is the result of extracting distal\ninformation from the more proximal bodily information, for use by\ndedicated downstream systems (cf. Serino and Haggard 2010). Since all\nperceptual touch will be the result of such extraction, there will\nalways be bodily information available for awareness.\nThese various views all take a stand on the extent to which touch\nbrings direct awareness of external features and objects, and to what\nextent such awareness is mediated by awareness of the body. In\naddition, they are usually forced to take a stand on the spatial\ncontents of perceptual touch. On views according to which all external\ntactual awareness is ultimately a form of bodily awareness, it is\nsimply not possible to have extended touch experiences. On other views\nthat hold a less restrictive dependence between perceptual touch and\nbodily awareness, there is an additional burden to explain how distal\ntouch is possible. These choices have analogues in the empirical\nliterature. Some, for instance, want to make a clear distinction\nbetween \u201cinteroception\u201d and \u201cexteroception\u201d\n (Craig 2002). According to this view, many aspects of touch,\nthough primarily its thermal properties and most forms of pure bodily\nsensation (itch, tingles, twinges, etc.) are primarily directed not at\nthe external world, but at the present state of our bodies. This is\npart of how our bodies maintain homeostasis. This results in\nthe possibility of very different functional roles for certain aspects\nof bodily awareness, especially as they function in the generation of\nperceptual touch.\n7. Touch and Action\nAs noted in the beginning, touch seems to have both a passive and\nan active nature. In its more passive forms, touch involves cutaneous\nactivations across the surface of the body. These include bodily\nsensations of hot and cold, pressure, vibration, and the like. In\naddition, these activations have a limited, entirely bodily spatial\ncharacter. This form of touch has played an important role in the\nearly empirical study of touch, especially in determining the nature\nand acuity of our sensory receptor populations. This has often been\naccomplished through the measure of the two\u2013point threshold\nmentioned above. This distance varies across the body and is a\nreliable guide to the density and spatial resolution of many tactual\nreceptors on the \n body.[4]\n While these passive forms of touch are\nimportant, especially in the empirical investigation of touch, in\ntypical, unconstrained touch, we use every part of our bodies to\nactively explore the environment. We use our hands and arms and\nfingers, we move our trunks and legs, and we actively feel with nearly\nevery surface of our body. Touch in ordinary use involves specialized\nmovements and grips. Such prehensile manipulation through touch is\noften distinguished from stereognosis, or object recognition through\ntouch. In addition, these movements recruit and make use of many\nreceptive systems that seem inherently active. For instance, haptic\ntouch involves feedback from our movements, along with information\nfrom our motor activities (both in motor planning and efference\ncopies). Perhaps most importantly, it also includes information from\nreceptors in our muscles and joints. All of these elements interact\nand play a critical role in forming and developing our sense of\ntouch. For this reason, touch, especially of the active, haptic\nvariety, seems like an ideal model for views of perception according\nto which perception is essentially a form of action, or at least a\nform of experience that involves action in a unique manner.\nGiven its active nature and dependence on exploratory movement,\nmany have taken touch to be best understood as an extended \u201c\nhaptic system\u201d that includes both surface receptors and motor\nareas (Gibson 1966). The wider haptic system so understood involves\nthe entire body and brings direct awareness of things in the\nenvironment by engaging and actively connecting together a number of\ndistinct sensory networks. Many later theorists have been influenced\nby this compelling account of touch.\nThe connections between touch and exploration run deep. To cite\njust one example, subjects have a remarkable ability to determine the\nsize and shape of many large objects simply by hefting and wielding\nthe objects through space (Turvey 1996). These actions provide a rich\nand distinctive form of awareness that cannot be generated or\nrecreated through skin activations alone. These dynamic touch\nexperiences reveal the strong connection between touch and action.\nMany theorists now think of perception as inherently active. This\nis a large, diverse group, one that includes motor theorists,\nenactivists, and many others (see the entry on\n embodied cognition).  Touch,\nespecially of the dynamic and interactive kind described by Gibson and\nTurvey, would seem to provide strong evidence in favor of such\nviews. Or at the least, if the case is to be made, one would expect it\nto be strongest for the sense of touch in its dynamic forms. To cite\nhere just one prominent example: No\u00eb (2004) defends an account of\nperception that takes it to be essentially a form of action. He begins\nhis discussion by arguing that vision is \u201ctouch like\u201d,\ninvolving sampling and exploratory probing of the environment. The\nactive nature of touch is never in question, and can be used in this\ncontext as a model for understanding other forms of perception. It is\ntrue that haptic touch seems inherently active, but many detailed\nquestions remain about the metaphysical relations between action and\ntouch (for instance, whether action is merely causally necessary or\nconstitutive of touch). This is likely to be an area of ongoing active\nresearch.\n8. Pleasant Touch\nA final area of increasing philosophical investigation concerns the\nrole of pleasure and pain in perception, something typically referred\nto as\n \u201caffect\u201d.[5]\n The question is central to our full\nunderstanding of the richness and complexity of perceptual\nexperience. While perception is often assumed to be entirely receptive\nand descriptive, it is just as often evaluative and motivational. When\nwe smell something awful or see something graphic, we have intense\nreactions to these experiences, and are directly motivated to act in\nvarious ways. These forms of affective perceptual experience seemingly\nbridge the gap between experience, emotion, and evaluative\njudgment. For these reason, there are many importantly different\naccounts available for explaining the valenced nature of these\nexperiences.\nTouch again is an excellent source for such investigation. Our\ntactual experiences often seem to have a felt pleasant or unpleasant\ncharacter. This isn\u2019t simply an\nassociated but distinct state of pleasure or pain that accompanies the\nperceptual experience, but part of the perceptual experience\nitself. Paradigm examples include the pleasure derived from delicious\nfood or the awfulness of certain bad smells. Here again, touch is\nready for increased investigation. In recent\nyears, researchers have discovered a specialized class of afferent\nnerve channels that seem to be responsible for the experience of\npleasantness (L\u00f6ken et al. 2009; McGlone et al. 2012). These\nchannels, called CT-Afferents, are maximally responsive to\nslow, regular activations like those generated by a feather pulled\ngently across the arm. These channels seem like pleasant versions of\nthe famous C-fibers implicated in pain experiences.\nWhile the discovery of these afferents has been an exciting\ndevelopment in our understanding of affective perceptual experience,\nthey also raise many questions. How can a receptor \u201ccode for\npleasantness\u201d? Are there other similar receptors for pleasant\ntouch in glabrous skin (the smooth, hairless skin of the lips and\npalms where they are no CT\u2013afferents). What do these receptors\nmean for our understanding of pleasure and pain and affective\nexperience more generally? And returning to where we started, we can\nseriously wonder whether and to what extent the CT system seems to be\na part of touch. The CT system seems, unlike that for cutaneous pain,\nto be a genuine component of the touch system; on the other hand, the\nCT system also doesn\u2019t appear to have any direct discriminative\nfunction. CT interactions reveal much about the complex ways in which\nemotions and motivation can come to be closely connected to perceptual\nexperience. They can also be seen as a bridge to a better\nunderstanding of affiliative touch, the close form of caring touch\nthat forms an essential element of social bonding and human\ndevelopment, especially of the immune system (Field 2003). This should\nprove to be an area of increasing research.\n\nIn addition, the unique aesthetic properties of touch have recently been explored by Korsmeyer (2019, 2020). In particular she has, explored the ways in which direct contact with objects mediated by touch can confer a sense of authenticity and value to an object that it cannot get through any other modality. This connects with recent trends in tangible art installations that encourage rather than prohibit direct contact and exploration. \n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Akins, K., 1996, \u201cOf sensory systems and the\n\u2018aboutness\u2019 of mental states\u201d, <em>The Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 93(7): 337\u2013372.", "Armstrong, D.M., 1962, <em>Bodily Sensations</em>, London:\nRoutledge &amp; Kegan Paul.", "Aydede, M. and G.
