    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s View of the mind || Unity of Consciousness\n3.4 Unity of Consciousness\n\n\nFor Kant, consciousness being unified is a central feature of the\nmind, our kind of mind at any rate. In fact, being a single integrated\ngroup of experiences (roughly, one person\u2019s experiences) requires two\nkinds of unity.\n\nThe experiences must have a single common subject (A350);\n\nand,\n\n\nThe consciousness that this subject has of represented objects\nand/or representations must be unified.\n\n\n\nThe first requirement may look trivial but it is not. For Hume, for\nexample, what makes a group of experiences one person\u2019s experiences is\nthat they are associated with one another in an appropriate way (the\nso-called bundle theory), not that they have a common subject. The need\nfor a subject arises from two straightforward considerations:\nrepresentations not only represent something, they represent it to\nsomeone; and, representations are not given to us \u2013 to become a\nrepresentation, sensory inputs must be processed by an integrated\ncognitive system. Kant may have been conscious of both these points,\nbut beyond identifying the need, he had little to say about what the\nsubject of experience might be like, so we will say no more about it.\n(We will, however, say something about what its consciousness of itself\nis like later.)\n\n\nKant seems to have used the terms \n \u2018unity of consciousness\u2019 (A103)\n and \u2018unity of apperception\u2019 (A105, A108) \ninterchangeably. The well-known argument at the beginning of the first\nedition attack on the second paralogism (A352) focuses on this unity\nat a given time (among other things) and what can (or rather, cannot)\nbe inferred from this about the nature of the mind (a topic to which\nwe will return below). The attack on the third paralogism focuses on\nwhat can be inferred from unified consciousness over time. These are\nall from the first edition of CPR. In the second edition,\nKant makes remarks about unity unlike anything in the first edition,\nfor example, \u201cthis unity \u2026 is not the category of\nunity\u201d (B131).  The unity of consciousness and Kant\u2019s\nviews on it are complicated issues but some of the most important\npoints include the following.\n\n\nBy \u2018unity of consciousness\u2019, Kant seems to have the\nfollowing in mind: I am conscious not only of single experiences but of\na great many experiences at the same time. The same is true of actions;\nI can do and be conscious of doing a number of actions at the same\ntime. In addition to such synchronic unity, many global\nrepresentations, as we called them, display temporal unity: current\nrepresentation is combined with retained earlier representation.\n(Temporal unity is often a feature of synthesis of recognition.) Any\nrepresentation that we acquire in a series of temporal steps, such as\nhearing a sentence, will have unity across time (A104; A352).\n\n\nKant himself did not explicate his notion of unified consciousness\nbut here is one plausible articulation of the notion at work in his\nwritings.\nThe unity of consciousness =df. (i) a single act\nof consciousness, which (ii) makes one conscious of a number of\nrepresentations and/or objects of representation in such a way that to\nbe conscious by having any members of this group is also to be\nconscious by having others in the group and of at least some of them as\na group.\n\n\nAs this definition makes clear, consciousness being unified is more\nthan just being one state of consciousness. Unified consciousness is\nnot just singular, it is unified.\n\n\nKant placed great emphasis on the unity of consciousness, both\npositively and negatively. Positively, he held that conceptualized\nrepresentation has to be unified both at and across time. Negatively,\nfrom a mind having unified consciousness, he held that nothing follows\nconcerning its composition, its identity, especially its\n identity across time,\n nor its materiality or immateriality. He argued these points in his\nattacks on the second, third and fourth Paralogisms.\n",
