    "main_text": "Schopenhauer\u2019s Later Works\n6. Schopenhauer\u2019s Later Works\n\nAt the end of the first volume of The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818), Schopenhauer intimates that the ascetic\nexperiences an inscrutable mystical state of consciousness that looks\nlike nothing at all from the standpoint of ordinary, day-to-day,\nindividuated and objectifying consciousness. Conversely, he adds that\nfrom the standpoint of the ascetic\u2019s mystical consciousness,\nwhere only knowledge remains and where \u201cthe will [to live] has\nvanished,\u201d the physical world itself, with all of its suns and\ngalaxies \u201cis \u2013 nothing,\u201d likening this consciousness\nto \u201cthe Prajna-Paramita of the Buddhists\u201d (WWR,\nSection 71) to conclude the book. He also states in the same section\nthat this mystical consciousness has an ocean-like calmness,\ntranquillity, confidence and serenity, adding that if one were to seek\na positive characterization of the mystical state, we could refer\nloosely to words and phrases such as \u201cecstasy,\u201d\n\u201crapture,\u201d \u201cillumination\u201d and \u201cunion\nwith God.\u201d Schopenhauer recognizes a positive content to the\nascetic\u2019s mystical experience, but he regards the experience as\nineffable.\n\nThis advocacy of mystical experience creates a puzzle: if\neverything is Will without qualification, then it is unclear\nwhere to locate the will-less mystical state of mind. According to\nSchopenhauer\u2019s three-tiered philosophical schema, which is now\ncoming into question, it must be located either at the level of Will\nas it is in itself, or at the level of Platonic Ideas, or at the level\nof individual things in space and time. It cannot be the latter,\nbecause individuated consciousness is the everyday consciousness of\ndesire, frustration and suffering. Neither can it be located at the\nlevel of Will as it is in itself, because the Will is a blind\nstriving, without knowledge, and without satisfaction. \n\nThe ascetic consciousness might be most plausibly located at the level\nof the universal subject-object distinction, akin to the music-filled\nconsciousness, but Schopenhauer states that the mystical consciousness\nabolishes not only time and space, but also the fundamental forms of\nsubject and object: \u201cno will: no representation, no world\u201d\n(WWR, Section 71). So in terms of its degree of generality,\nthe mystical state of mind seems to be located at a level of\nuniversality comparable to that of Will as thing-in-itself. Since he\ncharacterizes it as not being a manifestation of Will, however, it\nappears to be keyed into another dimension altogether, in total\ndisconnection from Will as the thing-in-itself. This is to say that if\nthe thing-in-itself is exactly congruent with Will, then it is\ndifficult to accept Schopenhauer\u2019s mystical characterizations of\nthe ascetic consciousness, and at the same time identify a consistent\nplace for it within Schopenhauer\u2019s three-tiered philosophical\nschema of reality.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s position on whether the thing-in-itself is Will\nconsequently presents some interpretive difficulties. In On the\nWill in Nature (1836/1854), he almost always speaks as if the two\nare identical. In the second volume of The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1844), he addresses the above complication, and\nqualifies his claim that the thing-in-itself is Will. He states in the\n1844 work (reciting manuscript notes from 1821 almost verbatim, so\nthis is not an \u201c1844\u201d or \u201clater\u201d view) that it\nis only \u201cto us\u201d that the thing-in-itself appears as Will\nand that it remains possible that the thing-in-itself has other modes\nof being that are incomprehensible in ordinary terms, but that might\nbe accessible to mystical consciousness (WWR, II, Chapter\nXVIII, \u201cOn the Possibility of Knowing the\nThing-in-Itself\u201d). He concludes that mystical experience is only\na relative nothingness, that is, when it is considered from the\nstandpoint of the daily world, but that it is not an absolute\nnothingness, as would be the case if the thing-in-itself were Will in\nan unconditional sense, and not merely Will to us. \n\nIn light of this, Schopenhauer sometimes expresses the view that the\nthing-in-itself is multidimensional, and although the thing-in-itself\nis not wholly identical to the world as Will, it nonetheless includes\nas its manifestations, the world as Will and the world as\nrepresentation. This lends a panentheistic structure to\nSchopenhauer\u2019s view (noted earlier in the views of K.C.F.\nKrause). From a scholarly standpoint, it implies that interpretations\nof Schopenhauer that portray him as a Kantian who believes that\nknowledge of the thing-in-itself is impossible, do not fit with what\nSchopenhauer himself believed. It also implies that interpretations\nthat portray him as a traditional metaphysician who claims that the\nthing-in-itself is straightforwardly, wholly and unconditionally Will,\nalso stand in need of qualification.\n",
