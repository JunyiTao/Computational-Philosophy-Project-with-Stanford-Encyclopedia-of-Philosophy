    "main_text": "Double Extension Set Theory: A Curiosity\n10. Double Extension Set Theory: A Curiosity\n\nA recent proposal of Andrzej Kisielewicz (1998) is that the paradoxes\nof set theory might be evaded by having two different membership\nrelations \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\), with each membership relation\nused to define extensions for the other.\n\nWe present the axiomatics. The primitive notions of this theory are\nequality \\((=)\\) and the two flavors \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\) of\nmembership. A formula \\(\\phi\\) is uniform if it does not\nmention \\(\\varepsilon\\). If \\(\\phi\\) is a uniform formula, \\(\\phi^*\\)\nis the corresponding formula with \\(\\in\\) replaced by \\(\\varepsilon\\)\nthroughout. A set \\(A\\) is regular iff it has the same\nextension with respect to both membership relations: \\(x \\in A \\equiv\nx \\varepsilon A\\).\n\nThe comprehension axiom asserts that for any uniform formula\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) in which all parameters (free variables other than \\(x\\))\nare regular, there is an object \\(A\\), for which we use the notation\n\\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\), such that \\(\\forall x ((x \\in A \\equiv \\phi^*)\n\\amp (x \\varepsilon A \\equiv \\phi))\\).\n\nThe extensionality axiom asserts that for any \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\\(\\forall x(x \\in A \\equiv x \\varepsilon B) \\rightarrow A = B\\).\nNotice that any object to which this axiom applies is regular.\n\nFinally, a special axiom asserts that any set one of whose extensions\nis included in a regular set is itself regular.\n\nThis theory can be shown to interpret ZF in the realm of\nhereditarily regular sets. Formally, the proof has the same\nstructure as the proof for Ackermann set theory. It is unclear whether\nthis theory is actually consistent; natural ways to strengthen it\n(including the first version proposed by Kisielewicz) turn out to be\ninconsistent. It is also extremely hard to think about!\n\nAn example of the curious properties of this theory is that the\nordinals under one membership relation are exactly the regular\nordinals while under the other they are longer; this means that the\napparent symmetry between the two membership relations breaks!\n",
