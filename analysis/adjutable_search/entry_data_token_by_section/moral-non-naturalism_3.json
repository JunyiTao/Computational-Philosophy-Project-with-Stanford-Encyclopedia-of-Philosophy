    "main_text": "Explanatory Impotence\n4. Explanatory Impotence\n\n\nDeveloping a plausible epistemology (intuitionist or otherwise) is\nalso essential to meet some of the most pressing objections to\nnon-naturalism. One such objection begins with the premise that\nnon-natural properties do not figure in the best explanations of our\nexperiences and observations. Gilbert Harman famously argues that prima\nfacie there is a sharp contrast between moral beliefs and scientific\nbeliefs on this score. The best explanation of scientific beliefs often\nseems to entail the truth of those beliefs\u2014Harman gives the example\nof a scientist\u2019s belief that a proton is in a cloud chamber which seems\nto be best explained, in part, by the actual presence of a proton in\nthe chamber. By contrast, this does not seem to be true of our moral\nbeliefs. Rather, people\u2019s moral beliefs can be explained more elegantly\nand plausibly in terms of their upbringing and psychology without\nreference to any mysterious non-natural moral properties. This\ncontrast, combined with the epistemological principle that we should\nbelieve in a property only if it figures in the best explanations of\nour experiences entails that non-naturalism should be rejected. Indeed,\nHarman\u2019s argument would, if sound, also apply to anti-reductionist\nforms of naturalism. However, the anti-reductionist naturalist can try\nto avoid this line of argument by maintaining that the natural\nproperties constituting moral properties do figure in the best\nexplanations of our experiences. Nicholas Sturgeon, for example, argues\nthat reference to the moral property of being oppressive figures in the\nbest explanation of the growth of the anti-slavery movement in the\nUnited States between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War (see\nSturgeon 1988: 245; see also Railton 1986), and this is but one of a range of examples\ndiscussed by Sturgeon (for a reply, see Blackburn 1990). However, this\nstrategy is unavailable to the non-naturalist on many interpretations\nof what it is for a property to be a non-natural one. For example, if\nit is part of the definition of non-natural properties that they are\nnot invoked in scientific explanations then this defense is\nunavailable. However, on some interpretations of non-naturalism this\nmove is available. If, for example, non-natural properties are simply\nunderstood as properties that do not figure in similarity relations\nthen the non-naturalist might argue that often the best explanation of\nour moral judgements actually does advert to moral properties.\nIntuitionism and its plausibility are likely to be relevant here. The\nnon-naturalist might argue that people\u2019s clear and distinct experiences\nof moral properties can be explained only as hallucinations of some\nkind in a naturalistic framework, and that this does not do justice to\nthe clarity and ubiquity of such perceptions.\n\n\nAlternatively, the non-naturalist might point out that the charge of\nexplanatory impotence itself must refer to evaluative properties (see\nSayre-McCord 1988b). For the naturalist\u2019s objection must be that the\nbest explanation of our experiences does not presuppose the\nexistence of moral properties of the sort the non-naturalist has in\nmind. After all, if any old explanation you like would do then the\nnon-naturalist could no doubt provide some mediocre explanations of our\nexperiences that made reference to non-natural moral properties. Once\nthe naturalist allows that there are non-moral evaluative properties\nthat are relevant to the assessment of theories there is room for the\nnon-naturalist to argue that moral evaluative properties need not be\nall that different (metaphysically and epistemologically) and hence no\nmore problematic than the evaluative properties presupposed by the\nobjection. Moreover, this line of argument suggests that there is\nsomething self-defeating about the naturalist\u2019s epistemological\nprinciple. It requires that we believe in properties only if they\nfigure in the best explanation of our experiences. However, it is not\nclear that the property of being a good explanation itself figures in\nthe best explanation of our experiences. In which case, the\nepistemological principle seems to recommend its own rejection. The\nproblem here is very similar to a problem facing verificationist\ntheories of meaning which seemed to entail their own meaninglessness.\nPresumably the naturalist\u2019s best strategy is to argue that the values\nshe has in mind are purely naturalistic ones that we do have\nindependent reason to accept because they figure in the best\nexplanations of our experiences. Whether this strategy is plausible\nwill depend on the details of the naturalistic theory on offer.\n\n\n\nYet another reply to the objection is to argue that belief in moral\nproperties (or, more broadly, normative properties) construed in terms\nof non-naturalism, is indispensable to our deliberation.  The idea\nbehind this strategy is to argue that there is no reason we should\nprivilege explanatory indispensability over deliberative\nindispensability (see Enoch 2011). One worry about this strategy is\nthat it is not clear that it helps support belief in specifically\nmoral properties, but once we embrace non-naturalist realism about\nother normative properties there may be no further ontological costs\nto accepting the appearances about moral properties too.  Like all\ntranscendental arguments, this defense of non-naturalism is subject to\nworries about why the indispensability of some belief to our\ndeliberation speaks in favor of its truth.  Finally, it is not\nentirely clear why one must believe in normative properties as\nconstrued by non-naturalism in order to deliberate.  A lot of the work\nof this argument consists in debunking naturalist and expressivist\nconceptions of moral belief as inadequate for our deliberative\npurposes.  See both Enoch 2011 and Fitzpatrick 2011 for relevant\ndiscussion of this last point.  \n",
