Historical treatments\n\nThe following historical trajectory motivates the characteristic\nfeatures and certain treatments of determinables and determinates;\nthose interested in cutting to the contemporary chase can skip to\n\u00a72 with little loss of continuity.\n\nThe terminology of determinables and determinates stems from ancient\nand scholastic treatment of the definition of a species, as analyzable\ninto two parts: a genus, or generic part of an essence\u2014the\npars determinabilis essentiae, and the differentia, or\ndifferentiating part of an essence\u2014the pars determinans\nessentiae. As we\u2019ll see, the terminology and its original\napplication eventually went separate ways, with the genus-species\nrelation standardly being treated in conjunctive terms (with a given\nspecies being identified with the conjunction of a genus and one or\nmore differentia), and determination being treated as a distinctive\nnon-conjunctive specification\n relation.[1]\n",
