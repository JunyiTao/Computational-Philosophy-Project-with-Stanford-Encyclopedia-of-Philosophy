    "main_text": "Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? || The argument in the text\n1.2 The argument in the text\n\nThe EPR text is concerned, in the first instance, with the logical\nconnections between two assertions. One asserts that quantum mechanics\nis incomplete. The other asserts that incompatible quantities (those\nwhose operators do not commute, like the x-coordinate of\nposition and linear momentum in direction x) cannot have\nsimultaneous \u201creality\u201d (i.e., simultaneously real values).\nThe authors assert the disjunction of these as a first premise (later\nto be justified): one or another of these must hold. It follows that\nif quantum mechanics were complete (so that the first assertion\nfailed) then the second one would hold; i.e., incompatible quantities\ncannot have real values simultaneously. They take as a second premise\n(also to be justified) that if quantum mechanics were complete, then\nincompatible quantities (in particular coordinates of position and\nmomentum) could indeed have simultaneous, real values. They conclude\nthat quantum mechanics is incomplete. The conclusion certainly follows\nsince otherwise (if the theory were complete) one would have a\ncontradiction over simultaneous values. Nevertheless the argument is\nhighly abstract and formulaic and even at this point in its\ndevelopment one can readily appreciate Einstein\u2019s disappointment.\n\nEPR now proceed to establish the two premises, beginning with a\ndiscussion of the idea of a complete theory. Here they offer only a\nnecessary condition; namely, that for a complete theory \u201cevery\nelement of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the\nphysical theory.\u201d The term \u201celement\u201c may remind one\nof Mach, for whom this was a central, technical term connected to\nsensations. (See the entry on\n Ernst Mach.)\n The use in EPR of elements of reality is also technical but\ndifferent. Although they do not define an \u201celement of physical\nreality\u201d explicitly (and, one might note, the language of\nelements is not part of Einstein\u2019s usage elsewhere), that expression\nis used when referring to the values of physical quantities\n(positions, momenta, and so on) that are determined by an underlying\n\u201creal physical state\u201d. The picture is that quantum systems\nhave real states that assign values to certain quantities. Sometimes\nEPR describe this by saying the quantities in question have\n\u201cdefinite values\u201d, sometimes \u201cthere exists an\nelement of physical reality corresponding to the quantity\u201d.\nSuppose we adapt the simpler terminology and call a quantity on a\nsystem definite if that quantity has a definite value; i.e.,\nif the real state of the system assigns a value (an \u201celement of\nreality\u201d) to the quantity. The relation that associates real\nstates with assignments of values to quantities is functional so that\nwithout a change in the real state there is no change among values\nassigned to quantities. In order to get at the issue of completeness,\na primary question for EPR is to determine when a quantity has a\ndefinite value. For that purpose they offer a minimal sufficient\ncondition (p. 777):\n\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of reality\ncorresponding to that quantity.\n\n\nThis sufficient condition for an \u201celement of reality\u201d is\noften referred to as the EPR\n Criterion of Reality.\n By way of illustration EPR point to those quantities for which the\nquantum state of the system is an eigenstate. It follows from the\nCriterion that at least these quantities have a definite value;\nnamely, the associated eigenvalue, since in an eigenstate the\ncorresponding eigenvalue has probability one, which we can determine\n(predict with certainty) without disturbing the system. In fact,\nmoving from eigenstate to eigenvalue to fix a definite value is the\nonly use of the Criterion in EPR.\n\nWith these terms in place it is easy to show that if, say, the values\nof position and momentum for a quantum system were definite (were\nelements of reality) then the description provided by the wave\nfunction of the system would be incomplete, since no wave function\ncontains counterparts for both elements. Technically, no state\nfunction\u2014even an improper one, like a delta function\u2014is a\nsimultaneous eigenstate for both position and momentum; indeed, joint\nprobabilities for position and momentum are not well-defined in any\nquantum state. Thus they establish the first premise: either quantum\ntheory is incomplete or there can be no simultaneously real\n(\u201cdefinite\u201d) values for incompatible quantities. They now\nneed to show that if quantum mechanics were complete, then\nincompatible quantities could have simultaneous real values, which is\nthe second premise. This, however, is not easily established. Indeed\nwhat EPR proceed to do is odd. Instead of assuming completeness and on\nthat basis deriving that incompatible quantities can have real values\nsimultaneously, they simply set out to derive the latter assertion\nwithout any completeness assumption at all. This\n\u201cderivation\u201d turns out to be the heart of the paper and\nits most controversial part. It attempts to show that in certain\ncircumstances a quantum system can have simultaneous values for\nincompatible quantities (once again, for position and momentum), where\nthese are definite values; that is, they are assigned by the real\nstate of the system, hence are \u201celements of reality\u201d.\n\nThey proceed by sketching an iconic thought experiment whose\nvariations continue to be important and widely discussed. The\nexperiment concerns two quantum systems that are spatially distant\nfrom one another, perhaps quite far apart, but such that the total\nwave function for the pair links both the positions of the systems as\nwell as their linear momenta. In the EPR example the total linear\nmomentum is zero along the x-axis. Thus if the linear\nmomentum of one of the systems (we can call it Albert\u2019s) along the\nx-axis were found to be p, the x-momentum\nof the other system (call it Niels\u2019) would be found to be\n\u2212p. At the same time their positions along x\nare also strictly correlated so that determining the position of one\nsystem on the x-axis allows us to infer the position of the\nother system along x. The paper constructs an explicit wave\nfunction for the combined (Albert+Niels) system that embodies these\nlinks even when the systems are widely separated in space. Although\ncommentators later raised questions about the legitimacy of this wave\nfunction, it does appear to guarantee the required correlations for\nspatially separated systems, at least for a moment (Jammer 1974, pp.\n225\u201338; see also Halvorson 2000). In any case, one can model the\nsame conceptual situation in other cases that are clearly well defined\nquantum mechanically (see\n Section 3.1).\n\nAt this point of the argument (p. 779) EPR make two critical\nassumptions, although they do not call special attention to them. (For\nthe significance of these assumptions in Einstein\u2019s thinking see\nHoward 1985 and also section 5 of the entry on\n Einstein.)\n The first assumption (separability) is that at the time when\nthe systems are separated, maybe quite far apart, each has its own\nreality. In effect, they assume that each system maintains a separate\nidentity characterized by a real physical state, even though each\nsystem is also strictly correlated with the other in respect both to\nmomentum and position. They need this assumption to make sense of\nanother. The second assumption is that of locality. Given\nthat the systems are far apart, locality supposes that \u201cno real\nchange can take place\u201d in one system as a direct consequence of\na measurement made on the other system. They gloss this by saying\n\u201cat the time of measurement the two systems no longer\ninteract.\u201d Note that locality does not require that nothing at\nall about one system can be disturbed directly by a distant\nmeasurement on the other system. Locality only rules out that a\ndistant measurement may directly disturb or change what is counted as\n\u201creal\u201c with respect to a system, a reality that\nseparability guarantees. On the basis of these two assumptions they\nconclude that each system can have definite values (\u201celements of\nreality\u201d) for both position and momentum simultaneously. There\nis no straightforward argument for this in the text. Instead they use\nthese two assumptions to show how one could be led to assign position\nand momentum eigenstates to one system by making measurements on the\nother system, from which the simultaneous attribution of elements of\nreality is supposed to follow. Since this is the central and most\ncontroversial part of the paper, it pays to go slowly here in trying\nto reconstruct an argument on their behalf.\n\nHere is one attempt. (Dickson 2004 analyzes some of the modal\nprinciples involved and suggests one line of argument, which he\ncriticizes. Hooker 1972 is a comprehensive discussion that identifies\nseveral generically different ways to make the case.) Locality affirms\nthat the real state of a system is not affected by distant\nmeasurements. Since the real state determines which quantities are\ndefinite (i.e., have assigned values), the set of definite quantities\nis also not affected by distant measurements. So if by measuring a\ndistant partner we can determine that a certain quantity is definite,\nthen that quantity must have been definite all along. As we have seen,\nthe\n Criterion of Reality\n implies that a quantity is definite if the state of the system is an\neigenstate for that quantity. In the case of the strict correlations\nof EPR, measuring one system triggers a reduction of the joint state\nthat results in an eigenstate for the distant partner. Hence any\nquantity with that eigenstate is definite. For example, since\nmeasuring the momentum of Albert\u2019s system results in a momentum\neigenstate for Niels\u2019, the momentum of Niels\u2019 system is definite.\nLikewise for the position of Niels\u2019 system. Given separability, the\ncombination of locality and the Criterion establish a quite general\nlemma; namely, when quantities on separated systems have strictly\ncorrelated values, those quantities are definite. Thus the strict\ncorrelations between Niels\u2019 system and Albert\u2019s in the EPR situation\nguarantee that both position and momentum are definite; i. e., that\neach system has definite position and momentum simultaneously.\n\nEPR point out that position and momentum cannot be measured\nsimultaneously. So even if each can be shown to be definite in\ndistinct contexts of measurement, can both be definite at the same\ntime? The lemma answers \u201cyes\u201d. What drives the argument is\nlocality, which functions logically to decontextualize the reality of\nNiels\u2019 system from goings on at Albert\u2019s. Accordingly, measurements\nmade on Albert\u2019s system are probative for features corresponding to\nthe real state of Niels\u2019 system but not determinative of them. Thus\neven without measuring Albert\u2019s system, features corresponding to the\nreal state of Niels\u2019 system remain in place. Among those features are\na definite position and a definite momentum for Niels\u2019 system along\nsome particular coordinate direction.\n\nIn the penultimate paragraph of EPR (p. 780) they address the problem\nof getting real values for incompatible quantities simultaneously.\n\nIndeed one would not arrive at our conclusion if one insisted that two\nor more physical quantities can be regarded as simultaneous elements\nof reality only when they can be simultaneously measured or predicted.\n\u2026 This makes the reality [on the second system] depend upon the\nprocess of measurement carried out on the first system, which does not\nin any way disturb the second system. No reasonable definition of\nreality could be expected to permit this.\n\n\nThe unreasonableness to which EPR allude in making \u201cthe reality\n[on the second system] depend upon the process of measurement carried\nout on the first system, which does not in any way disturb the second\nsystem\u201d is just the unreasonableness that would be involved in\nrenouncing locality understood as above. For it is locality that\nenables one to overcome the incompatibility of position and momentum\nmeasurements of Albert\u2019s system by requiring their joint consequences\nfor Niels\u2019 system to be incorporated in a single, stable reality\nthere. If we recall\n Einstein\u2019s acknowledgment to Ehrenfest\n that getting simultaneous position and momentum was \u201cnot\nlogically necessary\u201d, we can see how EPR respond by making it\nbecome necessary once locality is assumed.\n\nHere, then, are the key features of EPR.\n\nEPR is about the interpretation of state vectors (\u201cwave\nfunctions\u201d) and employs the standard state vector reduction\nformalism (von Neumann\u2019s \u201cprojection postulate\u201d).\nThe Criterion of Reality\n affirms that the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenstate of a\nsystem is a value determined by the real physical state of that\nsystem. (This is the Criterion\u2019s only use.)\n(Separability)\n Spatially separated systems have real physical states.\n(Locality)\n If systems are spatially separate, the measurement (or absence of\nmeasurement) of one system does not directly affect the reality that\npertains to the others.\n(EPR Lemma) If quantities on separated systems have strictly\ncorrelated values, those quantities are definite (i.e., have definite\nvalues). This follows from separability, locality and the Criterion.\nNo actual measurements are required.\n(Completeness)\n If the description of systems by state vectors were complete, then\ndefinite values of quantities (values determined by the real state of\na system) could be inferred from a state vector for the system itself\nor from a state vector for a composite of which the system is a\npart.\n In summary, separated systems as described by EPR have definite\nposition and momentum values simultaneously. Since this cannot be\ninferred from any state vector, the quantum mechanical description of\nsystems by means state vectors is incomplete. \n\n\nThe EPR experiment with interacting systems accomplishes a form of\nindirect measurement. The direct measurement of Albert\u2019s system\nyields information about Niels\u2019 system; it tells us what we\nwould find if we were to measure there directly. But it does this\nat-a-distance, without any physical interaction taking place between\nthe two systems.  Thus the thought experiment at the heart of EPR\nundercuts the picture of measurement as necessarily involving a tiny\nobject banging into a large measuring instrument. If we look back at\nEinstein\u2019s reservations about complementarity, we can appreciate\nthat by focusing on an indirect, non-disturbing kind of measurement\nthe EPR argument targets Bohr\u2019s program for explaining central\nconceptual features of the quantum theory. For that program relied on\nuncontrollable interaction with a measuring device as a necessary\nfeature of any measurement in the quantum domain. Nevertheless the\ncumbersome machinery employed in the EPR paper makes it difficult to\nsee what is central. It distracts from rather than focuses on the\nissues. That was Einstein\u2019s complaint about Podolsky\u2019s\ntext in his June 19, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger.\nSchr\u00f6dinger responded on July 13 reporting reactions to EPR that\nvindicate Einstein\u2019s concerns. With reference to EPR he\nwrote:\n\nI am now having fun and taking your note to its source to provoke the\nmost diverse, clever people: London, Teller, Born, Pauli, Szilard,\nWeyl. The best response so far is from Pauli who at least admits that\nthe use of the word \u201cstate\u201d [\u201cZustand\u201d] for\nthe psi-function is quite disreputable. What I have so far seen by way\nof published reactions is less witty. \u2026 It is as if one person\nsaid, \u201cIt is bitter cold in Chicago\u201d; and another\nanswered, \u201cThat is a fallacy, it is very hot in Florida.\u201d\n(Fine 1996, p. 74)\n\n",
