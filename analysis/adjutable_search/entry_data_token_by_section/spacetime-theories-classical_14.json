    "main_text": "Leibniz || Motion and Dynamics\n6.3 Motion and Dynamics\n\nHowever, from what has been said so far it is still possible that the\nfolk reading is accurate when it comes to Leibniz\u2019s views on the\nphenomena of motion, the subject of his theory of mechanics. The case\nfor the folk reading is in fact supported by Leibniz\u2019s\nresolution of the tension that we mentioned earlier, between the\nfundamental role of force/virtus (which we will now take to\nmean mass times speed2) and its\nassociation with Aristotelian form. Leibniz\u2019s way out (e.g.,\nSpecimen of Dynamics) is to require that while considerations\nof force must somehow determine the form of the laws of motion, the\nlaws themselves should be such as not to allow one to determine the\nvalue of the force (and hence true speed). One might conclude that in\nthis case Leibniz held that the only quantities which can be\ndetermined are those of relative position and motion, as the folk\nreading says. But even in this circumscribed context, it is at best\nquestionable whether the interpretation is correct.\n6.3.1 Leibniz\u2019s Mechanics\n\nConsider first Leibniz\u2019s mechanics. Since his laws are what is\nnow (ironically) often called \u2018Newtonian\u2019 elastic\ncollision theory, it seems that they satisfy both of his requirements.\nThe laws include conservation of kinetic energy (which we identify\nwith virtus), but they hold in all inertial frames, so the\nkinetic energy of any arbitrary body can be set to any initial value.\nBut they do not permit the kinetic energy of a body to take on any\nvalues throughout a process. The laws are only Galilean relativistic,\nand so are not true in every frame. Furthermore, according to the laws\nof collision, in an inertial frame, if a body does not collide then\nits Leibnizian force is conserved while if (except in special cases)\nit does collide then its force changes. According to Leibniz\u2019s\nlaws one cannot determine initial kinetic energies, but one certainly\ncan tell when they change. At the very least, there are quantities of\nmotion implicit in Leibniz\u2019s mechanics \u2013 change in force\nand true speed \u2013 that are not merely relative; the folk reading\nis committed to Leibniz simply missing this obvious fact.\n6.3.2 The Equivalence of Hypotheses\n\nThat said, when Leibniz discusses the relativity of motion \u2013\nwhich he calls the \u2018equivalence of hypotheses\u2019 about the\nstates of motion of bodies \u2013 some of his statements do suggest\nthat he was confused in this way. For another way of stating the\nproblem for the folk reading is that the claim that relative motions\nalone suffice for mechanics and that all relative motions are on a par\nis a principle of general relativity, and could Leibniz \u2013 a\nmathematical genius \u2013 really have failed to notice that his laws\nhold only in special frames? Well, just maybe. On the one hand, when\nhe explicitly articulates the principle of the equivalence of\nhypotheses (for instance in Specimen of Dynamics) he tends to\nsay only that one cannot assign initial velocities on the\nbasis of the outcome of a collision, which requires only Galilean\nrelativity. However, he confusingly also claimed (On Copernicanism\nand the Relativity of Motion, also in Garber and Ariew 1989) that\nthe Tychonic and Copernican hypotheses were equivalent. But if the\nEarth orbits the Sun in an inertial frame (Copernicus), then there is\nno inertial frame according to which the Sun orbits the Earth (Tycho\nBrahe), and vice versa: these hypotheses are simply not Galilean\nequivalent (something else Leibniz could hardly have failed to\nrealize). So there is some textual support for Leibniz endorsing\ngeneral relativity for the phenomena, as the folk reading\nmaintains.\n\nA number of commentators have suggested solutions to the puzzle of the\nconflicting pronouncements that Leibniz makes on the subject: Stein\n1977 argues for general relativity, thereby imputing a\nmisunderstanding of his own laws to Leibniz; Roberts 2003 argues for\nGalilean relativity, thereby discounting Leibniz\u2019s apparent\nstatements to the contrary. Jauernig 2004 and 2008 points out that in\nthe Specimen, Leibniz claims that all motions are composed of\nuniform rectilinear motions: an apparently curvilinear motion is\nactually a series of uniform motions, punctuated by discontinuous\ncollisions. This observation allows one to restrict the scope of\nclaims of the kind \u2018no motions can be attributed on the basis of\nphenomena\u2019 to inertial motions, and so helps read Leibniz as\nmore consistently advocating Galilean relativity, the reading Jauernig\nfavors (see also Huggett\u2019s 2006 \u2018Can Spacetime Help Settle\nAny Issues in Modern Philosophy?\u2019, in the Other Internet\nResources, which was inspired by Jauernig\u2019s work). Note that\neven in a pure collision dynamics the phenomena distinguish a body in\nuniform rectilinear motion over time, from one that undergoes\ncollisions changing its uniform rectilinear motion over time: the laws\nwill hold in the frame of the former, but not in the frame of the\nlatter. That is, apparently contrary to what Jauernig says,\nLeibniz\u2019s account of curvilinear motion does not collapse\nGalilean relativity into general relativity. In that case,\nLeibniz\u2019s specific claims of the phenomenal equivalence of\nCopernican and Tychonic hypotheses still need to be accommodated.\n",
