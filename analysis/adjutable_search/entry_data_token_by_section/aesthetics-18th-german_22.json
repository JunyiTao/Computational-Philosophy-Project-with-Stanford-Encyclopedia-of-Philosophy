    "main_text": "Schiller\u2019s Response to Kant\u2019s Aesthetics: Grace, Dignity, and Aesthetic Education || Aesthetic Education and the Achievement of Morality\n9. Herder\u2019s Critique of Kant: A Rapprochement between the Two Approaches?\n\n\nIn the five years after the publication of Schiller\u2019s Letters on\nAesthetic Education in 1795, both Romanticism and Absolute\nIdealism emerged, the former in works by Friedrich von Hardenburg\n(\u201cNovalis\u201d) and Friedrich Schlegel, the latter in works by\nJohann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. But\nsince both of these movements blossomed more fully in the early\ndecades of the nineteenth century, they will not be included in this\nsurvey. Instead, it will conclude with a second look at the work of\nJohann Herder, in this case with his late critique of Kant\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory. Herder, who as we saw had done the bulk of his work in\naesthetics long before the publications of Kant and Schiller, indeed\neven before the publication of Sulzer\u2019s encyclopedia, reacted\nviolently to the new aesthetics of play in his late\nwork Kalligone (1800), i.e., \u201cThe Birth of\nBeauty.\u201d This work, published only three years before Herder\u2019s\ndeath and after his renown had been eclipsed by such new stars as\nSchelling and Fichte, has never received much attention, but beneath\nits bursts of ill-temper it contains interesting and important\ncriticisms of Kant. The theme of Kalligone may be summed up\nwith this statement from its table of contents: \u201cNothing harms\nimmature taste more than if one makes everything into play\u201d\n(Kalligone, p. 660). Herder\u2019s critique came too late in his\nKant\u2019s life for him to respond to it.  If he had been able to respond,\nhe would have had no good reply to some of Herder\u2019s criticisms; but if\nHerder had had more sympathy for Kant\u2019s expository method in the\nthird Critique, he might have realized that on some of the\ncentral substantive points of his criticism the distance between\nhimself and Kant is not as great as it initially seems. In particular,\nHerder\u2019s representation of Kant\u2019s aesthetics as a pure theory of\nmental play mistakes Kant\u2019s initial analysis of the simplest form of\nnatural beauty for his whole theory of natural and artistic beauty. If\nHerder had recognized the importance for Kant of the more complicated\ncases of adherent and artistic beauty, he would have seen that there\nis considerable common ground between Kant\u2019s aesthetics of free play\nand his own aesthetics of the sensory apprehension of truth.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s criticisms of Lessing and Riedel (section 5.1) prefigure\nseveral of his objections to Kant. He objects to Kant\u2019s abstract\nmethod in aesthetics, to his failure to emphasize adequately the r\u00f4le\nof the senses and the differences among them both in his account of\naesthetic experience and in his classification of the arts, to an\ninadequate recognition of the importance of truth (indeed truth in\nseveral senses ) in our experience of art, and to what he sees as\nKant\u2019s inadequate emphasis on the way in which aesthetic experience\ngives us a feeling of being alive. But what is missing from Herder\u2019s\nearly critical aesthetics is an objection to the aesthetics of play,\nfor the simple reason that Kant had not yet made that prominent in\nGerman aesthetics. In turning now to Herder\u2019s criticisms of Kant\nin Kalligone, we will have to add that objection to his list\nof charges.\n\nKalligone is a polemic against Kant\u2019s Critique of the\nPower of Judgment, more precisely against its first half, the\n\u201cCritique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment,\u201d loosely\nstructured in parallel with Kant\u2019s work, although with numerous\ndigressions, sometimes even in dialogue form, and statements of\nHerder\u2019s own positions. Like Herder\u2019s polemic with Lessing in\nthe Groves of Criticism, his response to Kant\u2019s work is\nlonger than its target, and not all of its themes can be discussed\nhere. In ways anticipated in Herder\u2019s earlier work, Kalligone\nattacks Kant\u2019s methodology and his neglect of the concrete r\u00f4le of the\nsenses in a discipline that is, as defined by Baumgarten, supposed to\nfocus precisely on them. In an expression of the naturalism that\npervades his work, Herder also attacks Kant\u2019s appeals to the\n\u201csupersensible\u201d in his interpretation of aesthetic\nexperiences, especially the experience of sublimity. But Herder\u2019s most\nvehement objections are to Kant\u2019s insistence upon the\ndisinterestedness of aesthetic judgment and to his exclusion of a r\u00f4le\nfor determinate concepts in the free play of the mental powers in\naesthetic experience, which Herder sees as excluding any r\u00f4le for the\nknowledge of truth in aesthetic experience. We will focus here on\nHerder\u2019s criticisms of the disinterestedness and non-conceptuality of\naesthetic judgment.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s general theory of aesthetic experience is that it is an\nexperience of well-being arising from a perception of the\ntrue order of nature, which he opposes to Kant\u2019s theory of\nthe disinterestedness of aesthetic experience and\nattachment. Before we turn to that central issue, however, we may note\nHerder\u2019s objection that Kant\u2019s aesthetics does not pay sufficient\nattention to the concrete r\u00f4le of the senses in aesthetic\nexperience. The charge of insensitivity to the specificity of the\nsenses, as we saw, was at the heart of Herder\u2019s early aesthetics,\nbeginning with his critique of Lessing, and it manifests itself in\nvarious ways in his critique of Kant. One point at which it is\nparticularly clear is in his objection to Kant\u2019s scheme for the\nclassification of the fine arts, a scheme based on the differing\ncapacities of different media for meaning, tone, and gesture that\nHerder claims \u201cthrows us back into the old chaos.\u201d Kant\u2019s\nbasic division is between the verbal (redende) and the\nformative or visual (bildende) arts, and Herder says that\nKant\u2019s account of the\nso-called verbal arts [is] built upon\na word-play, which makes them\u2026into play, and not in\nthe technical sense of this word; and about the formative\narts as well as about the arts that effect sentiments nothing is said\nthat serves for the essence of each and the essence of\nall. (Kalligone, p. 939)\n\n\nBy contrast, Herder argues that any division of the arts, as well\nas any account of the way in which different arts need to be\ncultivated and contribute to our overall cultivation and development,\nmust attend to the specificity of our senses. For Herder, any\nclassification of the arts, and indeed any theory of aesthetic\neducation and the contribution of aesthetic education to general\neducation, must be based upon a firm grasp of the differences as well\nas the similarities among sight, hearing, touch, speech, and song (for\nthat too is among the arts of the tongue).  In his view Kant does not\nhave that grasp. Nor does it seem too much of a stretch to think that\nSchiller\u2019s theory of aesthetic education is deficient in this regard,\ntoo. Although Herder does not mention Schiller by name anywhere\nin Kalligone, he does begin the work by bemoaning the\ninfluence of Kant\u2019s third Critique upon his followers, and\nSchiller might be supposed to be the foremost among these, albeit one\nwith whom Herder had to maintain cordial relations in Weimar and\nperhaps spared for this reason.\n\n\nWe may now turn to the two main topics of Herder\u2019s criticism, namely\nKant\u2019s theory of the disinterestedness of aesthetic judgment and of\nhis doctrine of the purposeless play of imagination and understanding\nas the basis of such judgment. Herder had already expressed doubt\nabout disinterestedness as a fundamental aesthetic category in his\npolemic with Riedel in the fourth Grove, where he had\nrejected Riedel\u2019s definition of the beautiful as \u201cthat which can\nplease without an interested aim [interessierte Absicht] and\nwhich also can please if we do not possess it\u201d (\u201cFourth\nGrove,\u201d p. 291). At that time, however, Herder\u2019s objection\nseemed to be only that the concept of disinterestedness is not\n\u201coriginal,\u201d that is, that disinterestedness by itself\ncannot explain our pleasure in the beautiful and thus could\nat best be a consequence of some more fundamental explanation of\nbeauty. In Kalligone, however, he argues much more broadly\nthat our pleasure in beauty is not disinterested, but rather\nthat it is intimately connected with our most fundamental interest,\nour interest in life itself. He does this by rejecting Kant\u2019s rigid\ndistinction between the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good,\narguing that all of these notions are intimately connected and that\nthey all reflect our fundamental interest in enjoying a harmonious,\nwell-adapted life.\n\n\nThe first step in Herder\u2019s argument is to reject Kant\u2019s identification\nof agreeableness with sensory gratification narrowly understood. For\nHerder, the agreeable (angenehm) is what actually liberates\nand strengthens me and gives me a feeling of liberation and strength,\nof not merely being alive but of living freely and strongly. This\nfeeling can come through the engagement of any or all of my senses:\nwhatever preserves, promotes, expands, in short\nis harmonious with the feeling of my existence, each\nof my senses gladly accepts that, appropriates that to itself, and\nfinds it agreeable.\n\n\nWhat gives us such feelings is moreover\nuniversally pleasing, because \u201cwell-being, welfare,\nhealth\u201d (Wohlsein, Heil, Gesundheit) are the\n\u201cground and end of the existence of every living thing\u2026We\nall desire well-being, and whatever promotes this well-being in any\nway is agreeable\u201d (Kalligone, p. 668).\n\n\nWith the agreeable so broadly conceived, it is then easy for Herder to\nsuggest that the beautiful cannot be rigidly separated from it, but\nmust rather be more like a species of it, namely that which gives us\nsuch agreeable feelings of well-being through the \u201cnoble\nsenses,\u201d through figures, colors, tones, and the re-creation of\nall of these through the artificial signs of literary language.  To be\nsure, there are specific contexts in which we might call something\nthat is disagreeable good, or something that is beautiful\ndisagreeable, but these are the exceptions, not the rule\u2014a\nmedicine that is good for one, for example, may nevertheless be\ndisagreeable (Kalligone, pp. 672\u20133n.). But although the\nagreeable, the beautiful, and the good, which Kant construed as three\nfundamentally \u201cdifferent relations of representations to the\nfeeling of pleasure and displeasure\u201d (CPJ, \u00a75,\n5:209), do have to be distinguished in certain contexts, they\nnevertheless are all expressions of our pleasure in a free and healthy\nlife. Given this assumption, it is then not hard for Herder to argue\nthat so far from being disinterested, our pleasure in beauty is\nnecessarily of the greatest interest to us. But while he argues that\nthe beautiful necessarily interests us, Herder also insists that the\nbeautiful does not appeal to self-interest\nor self-love: the pleasure and interest in the genuinely\nbeautiful as well as the agreeable and good is universal, not personal\nor idiosyncratic.\n\n\nIt could well be argued that this is all that Shaftesbury originally\nmeant when he introduced the concept of disinterestedness into modern\nmoral and aesthetic discourse. For him, the opposite of disinterested\nis mercenary, that which one wants or does just for a\npersonal reward (Shaftesbury, Sensus Communis, Part II,\nSection III, in Characteristicks, vol. I, p. 55).  And this\nis arguably all that Riedel meant when he said that the beautiful is\nthat which can please us \u201cwithout possession.\u201d It would\nnot be reasonable, however, to claim that all that Kant meant by\nsaying that the pleasure in beauty is disinterested is that it must be\nable to please anyone apart from personal possession and use or\nconsumption of the beautiful object. He certainly seems to insist that\nthe source of our pleasure in the beautiful has nothing to do with the\nsources of our pleasure in the agreeable and the good. Kant is\napparently open to Herder\u2019s criticism, if indeed Herder\u2019s claim is\nthat our pleasures in the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good all\nultimately rest on our pleasure in the feeling of free and healthy\nlife. However, before we consider whether the distance here between\nKant and Herder is as great as Herder thinks, let us consider one last\ncharge on Herder\u2019s indictment of Kant, namely his objection to Kant\u2019s\ntheory that the experience of beauty is an experience of a free and\nconceptless play of the mental powers of imagination and\nunderstanding.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Herder\u2019s antipathy to Kant\u2019s central notion of the\nfree play of our cognitive powers is evident from the outset\nof Kalligone. In his Preface, Herder writes bitterly that\n\u201cthe self-named only possible philosophy\u201d has\ntransformed the arts \u201cinto a short or long, boring\napelike play\u201d (Kalligone, p.  648). In the body of\nthe text, Herder argues both generally that all response to objects,\nfeeling and sentiment as well as judgment, is accompanied with a\nconcept of the object. He also argues that, more specifically, our\npleasure in beautiful objects is always a pleasure in a sensed or felt\nrecognition of their adaptation to their environment, whether natural\nor artificial, that is impossible without the application of a concept\nto the object. Herder launches his general attack immediately\nfollowing his critique of Kant\u2019s first moment. Kant\u2019s second moment,\nHerder says, asserts that the \u201cbeautiful is what\npleases without a concept,\u201d and the third speaks of a\n\u201cForm of purposiveness without representation of an\nend.\u201d In Herder\u2019s view, however, \u201c [t]hat something could\nplease without a concept, and indeed please universally, is contrary\nto nature and experience\u201d (Kalligone,\np. 675). Depending on how we take this claim, of course, Herder may\nnot be saying anything with which Kant would disagree: Kant more than\nanyone else argues that all experience of an object requires\nconsciousness of a concept as well as of empirical intuitions of that\nobject, the matter of which is sensation. But he also holds that we\ncould have a feeling of pleasure in an object\nwithout considering what concepts apply to it, and on the\nbasis of such a feeling make the judgment that it is beautiful. Herder\nis specifically rejecting that claim. On what basis does he do so?\n\n\nHe does so by means of the more particular argument that our pleasure\nin beauty is in fact a pleasure in our sensed or felt recognition of\nan object\u2019s adaptation to its environment, together with the premise\nthat such a pleasure cannot be felt without a recognition of the\napplication of a relevant concept to the object. Herder argues for\nthis premise by going through a series of cases, precisely the kinds\nof particular examples that he accuses Kant of neglecting. First he\nconsiders figures (Gestalten), then colors and tones, and\nthen a series of kinds of natural things, from stones and crystals to\na series of living things ranging from flowers to human beings. In all\nof these cases, he argues, we respond to a recognition of the\ncharacter of a thing and its relation to its environment that is\nnecessarily mediated by our application of a concept to it. Before we\nconsider whether this is a fair objection to Kant, more generally\nwhether there is as much distance between Kant\u2019s views and Herder\u2019s as\nHerder himself believes, let us ask why Herder thinks such perception\nof an object\u2019s essence and its well-being in its environment is so\npleasing to us and so important for our own sense of well-being.\n\n\nThe answer to this question is what we might call a harmonic or\nsympathetic theory of the connection between pleasure in well-being\nand truth: Herder thinks that the perception of true harmony and\nwell-being in the things around us generates a parallel harmony and\nfeeling of it in ourselves:\nMay we not rejoice that we live in a world of\ngood order and good form [Wohlordnung und Wohlgestalt],\nwhere all results of the laws of nature in gentle forms reveal to us\nas it were a band of rest and motion, an elastic-effective constancy\nof things, in short beauty as the bodily expression of a corporeal\nperfection that is harmonious both within itself and to our\nfeeling? (Kalligone, p.  687)\n\n\nThe key idea here is not that we take pleasure in the direct\nconsumption of the fruits of a harmonious nature, but rather that\nthere is a kind of resonance between harmony and well-being in nature\nand our own sense of well-being: the perception of harmony in nature\nmakes our own being feel well-ordered, just as the perception of\ndisharmony in nature inevitably although painfully attracts our\nattention. This is the underlying vision of Herder\u2019s mature\naesthetics: our feeling of beauty does not arise from a free play with\nforms that might be triggered by something in the objective world but\nis not constrained by it. Rather, the feeling of beauty is a\nsubjective response to the perception of objective harmony, a\nsubjective feeling of well-being triggered by empathy with the\nwell-being of other things in the world.\n\n\nHowever, on several central points the differences between Kant and\nHerder are not quite as great as the latter supposed. First, Kant\nhimself interpreted the feeling of the free play of the cognitive\npowers in aesthetic experience as a feeling of life, and thus at the\ndeepest level his conception of the source of aesthetic pleasure is\nnot that different from Herder\u2019s. Second, although Kant began his\nanalysis with the simplest case of the free judgment of natural\nbeauty, which is supposedly not dependent upon our conceptualization\nof its object, it does not end there. As he complicated his analysis\nof aesthetic experiences to include the cases of the adherent beauty\nof works of nature as well as of human art in the general sense and of\nfine art in particular, Kant clearly recognized the r\u00f4le of\nconceptualization in our response to the work, and in the case of art\nin the production as the well the reception of the work, and\ntransformed his conception of free play with the mere form of an\nobject into a conception of felt harmony between the form and the\nconcept of the object which is not so different from Herder\u2019s\nconception of the harmony in a beautiful object.  Finally, when Kant\ncomplicated his initial conception of the disinterestedness of\naesthetic judgment to take account of our intellectual interest in the\nexistence of natural beauty, he recognized that our experience of\nbeauty is an experience of well-being and being at home in the world\nthat is not unrelated to Herder\u2019s conception of our experience of\nbeauty. Nevertheless, as Kant\u2019s terminology suggests, his conception\nof this interest may have remained more intellectual and moralistic\nthan Herder himself would prefer.\n\n\nIndeed, in his lectures on anthropology\u2014which he began offering\nonly in 1772\u201373, thus a decade after Herder had studied with\nhim\u2014Kant had made the connection between the free play of the\nfaculties and the feeling of life clear and central to his aesthetic\ntheory.  There Kant argued that \u201cGratification or pleasure is\nthe feeling of the promotion of life,\u201d indeed that life itself\n\u201cis the consciousness of a free and regular play of all the\npowers and faculties of human beings.\u201d He equated the free play\nof our powers and faculties with their unhindered activity, and thus\nfound the ultimate source of all pleasure in the unhindered activity\nof our powers:\nThe play of the powers of the mind\n[Gem\u00fcths Kr\u00e4fte] must be strongly alive and free if\nit is to animate. Intellectual pleasure consists in the consciousness\nof the use of freedom in accordance with rules. Freedom is the\ngreatest life of the human being, through which he exercises his\nactivity without hindrance. (Vorlesungen \u00fcber\nAnthropologie, 27:559\u201360)\n\n\nIn fact, Kant completes this discussion, which\nopens his lectures on the second part of psychology, on the faculties\nof approval and disapproval, with the remark that \u201cAll\ngratifications are related to life. Life, however, is a unity, and in\nso far as all gratifications aim at this, they are all homogeneous,\nlet the sources from which they spring be what they are\u201d (ibid.,\np. 561). Herder could have included these sentences in the footnote\nfrom Kalligone (pp. 672\u20133) in which he objects to\nKant\u2019s supposedly complete separation of the beautiful from the\nagreeable and the good.\n\n\nFinally, perhaps the deepest of Herder\u2019s criticisms of Kant is his\nattack upon the disinterestedness of aesthetic judgment, his\ninsistence that there is a continuum rather than discontinuity between\nour responses to the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good. But on\nthe matter of disinterestedness, too, Kant begins with a simple\nstatement of a position that then turned out to be more complicated\nthan it initially appeared. There can be no question that Kant wants\nto distinguish genuinely aesthetic experience from merely\nphysiological gratification of the senses, from the approval of\nutility, or from moral approval, and that he does this by saying that\naesthetic judgment neither presupposes nor gives rise to any interest\nin the existence of its object. But numerous factors complicate this\npicture.\n\n\nFirst, Kant always defines pleasure as a state of mind connected with\na disposition toward its own continuation, and in the first draft of\nthe Introduction to the third Critique he adds that pleasure\nis a ground \u201cfor producing its object\u201d (First Introduction\nto CPJ, section VIII, 20:230\u20131). There are technical\nreasons why Kant does not want to speak here of an interest\nin the continuation of pleasure and/or the production of its object,\nbut it is certainly reasonable to say that on Kant\u2019s own account any\npleasure, including even the purest pleasure in beauty, is accompanied\nwith some form of attachment to the possibility of its own\ncontinued and future experience, and therefore ordinarily to the\navailability of the objects that trigger that pleasure.\n\n\nFurther, Kant explicitly argues that the properly aesthetic pleasure\nin beautiful objects enters into combination with interests, also\nproperly so called, in the existence of those objects. Under the\nrubric of the \u201cempirical interest\u201d in the beautiful, he\nargued that there are societal reasons for taking interest in the\navailability and possession of beautiful objects. Although he denies\nthat there is any a priori relation of these reasons to the\nexperience of beauty (CPJ, \u00a741, 5:297), this is not to\ndeny the existence of such attachments.  Under the rubric of the\n\u201cintellectual interest in the beautiful,\u201d Kant then\ndescribes a reason for attachment to the beautiful that is apparently\nsupposed to be a priori, namely, that the existence of beauty\nis a \u201ctrace\u201d or \u201csign\u201d that nature is amenable\nto the satisfaction of our moral interests (CPJ,\n\u00a742, 5:300).\n\n\nKant\u2019s conception of an intellectual interest in the beautiful does\nnot seem entirely remote from Herder\u2019s view that our sense of\nwell-being in an object is accompanied with a corresponding sense of\nour own well-being, although there are two key differences. For one,\nHerder insists upon a recognition of an objective well-being\nto which our subjective feeling of well-being is a response, while for\nKant well-being is always subjective, that is, our own, and\nthe satisfaction of our aesthetic aims and of our moral aims may be\nparallel, but are both subjective. Our aesthetic pleasure in natural\nbeauty is a sign of the possibility of our moral well-being in nature,\nnot a response to a harmony in nature that has nothing to do with\nus. Second, Kant clearly wants to keep the connection between the\nsatisfaction of our aesthetic aims and the satisfaction of our moral\ninterests separate although connected, thus not collapsing aesthetic\npleasure into moral satisfaction. Further, Kant seems to suggest that\na sound moral interest in nature\u2019s amenability to our objectives is\na condition of the intellectual but aesthetic interest in the\nexistence of (natural) beauty. From Herder\u2019s point of view, that might\nseem to be an excessive moralization of an interest in the beautiful\nthat should be entirely natural, although from Kant\u2019s point of view\nHerder\u2019s insistence on the continuity of the beautiful and the good\nmight actually run the risk of an excessive moralization of aesthetic\nexperience. So no doubt there are differences between them, but it is\nmisleading of Herder to suggest that Kant simply fails to recognize\nthat we have a real attachment to the interest in the beautiful. Kant\ndid recognize that, but wanted to keep that attachment somewhat\ncomplicated and indirect in order to avoid the risk of an excessive\nmoralization of the aesthetic but at the same time\nalso avoid the risk of an excessive aestheticization of the moral.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Kant occupied a central place in\neighteenth-century German aesthetics, although he is hardly the only\nimportant figure in the period. Rather, he synthesized the aesthetics\nof truth, especially moral truth, represented by the Wolffians with\nthe aesthetics of play represented in Germany by Mendelssohn and\nSulzer, but did so in a subtle and complicated way that resisted the\nsimplifications that Schiller and Herder, for all their other\ninsights, attempted to press upon him.  At the same time, Kant\nrefused to allow the importance of the arousal of emotions for its own\nsake in tasteful aesthetic experience, and thus rejected this\naspect of aesthetic experience that had been recognized by Baumgarten\nand Meier and analyzed in considerable detail by Mendelssohn.  So\nKant\u2019s synthesis of approaches to aesthetic experience was by no means\ncomplete.  It might then be expected that the history of aesthetics in\nthe period immediately following Kant would have turned to the task of\nintegrating emotional impact into a complex theory of aesthetic\nexperience.  That is not what happened, however, as both Hegel and\nSchopenhauer developed different versions of purely cognitivist\naesthetics, rejecting Kant\u2019s theory of play, and downplayed the\nemotional impact of aesthetic experience even more than Kant had done.\nIt would take the rest of the nineteenth century to integrate the\nthree approaches to aesthetics that had been developed in the\neighteenth century.\n",
