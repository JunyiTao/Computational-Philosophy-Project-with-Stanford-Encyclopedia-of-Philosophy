    "main_text": "Origins and Character\n1. Origins and Character\n\nWhat we now know as transcendentalism first arose among the liberal\nNew England Congregationalists, who departed from orthodox Calvinism\nin two respects: they believed in the importance and efficacy of human\nstriving, as opposed to the bleaker Puritan picture of complete and\ninescapable human depravity; and they emphasized the unity rather than\nthe \u201cTrinity\u201d of God (hence the term\n\u201cUnitarian,\u201d originally a term of abuse that they came to\nadopt.) Most of the Unitarians held that Jesus was in some way\ninferior to God the Father but still greater than human beings; a few\nfollowed the English Unitarian Joseph Priestley (1733\u20131804) in\nholding that Jesus was thoroughly human, although endowed with special\nauthority. The Unitarians\u2019 leading preacher, William Ellery\nChanning (1780\u20131842), portrayed orthodox Congregationalism as a\nreligion of fear, and maintained that Jesus saved human beings from\nsin, not just from punishment. His sermon \u201cUnitarian\nChristianity\u201d (1819) denounced \u201cthe conspiracy of ages\nagainst the liberty of Christians\u201d (P, 336) and helped give the\nUnitarian movement its name. In \u201cLikeness to God\u201d (1828)\nhe proposed that human beings \u201cpartake\u201d of Divinity and\nthat they may achieve \u201ca growing likeness to the Supreme\nBeing\u201d (T, 4).\n\nThe Unitarians were \u201cmodern.\u201d They attempted to reconcile\nLocke\u2019s empiricism with Christianity by maintaining that the\naccounts of miracles in the Bible provide overwhelming evidence for\nthe truth of religion. It was precisely on this ground, however, that\nthe transcendentalists found fault with Unitarianism. For although\nthey admired Channing\u2019s idea that human beings can become more\nlike God, they were persuaded by Hume that no empirical proof of\nreligion could be satisfactory. In letters written in his freshman\nyear at Harvard (1817), Emerson tried out Hume\u2019s skeptical\narguments on his devout and respected Aunt Mary Moody Emerson, and in\nhis journals of the early 1820s he discusses with approval\nHume\u2019s Dialogues on Natural Religion and his underlying\ncritique of necessary connection. \u201cWe have no experience of a\nCreator,\u201d Emerson writes, and therefore we \u201cknow of\nnone\u201d (JMN 2, 161).\n\nSkepticism about religion was also engendered by the publication of an\nEnglish translation of F. D. E. Schleiermacher\u2019s Critical\nEssay Upon the Gospel of St. Luke (1825), which introduced the\nidea that the Bible was a product of human history and culture.\nEqually important was the publication in 1833\u2014some fifty years\nafter its initial appearance in Germany\u2014of James Marsh\u2019s\ntranslation of Johann Gottfried von Herder\u2019s Spirit of\nHebrew Poetry (1782). Herder blurred the lines between religious\ntexts and humanly-produced poetry, casting doubt on the authority of\nthe Bible, but also suggesting that texts with equal authority could\nstill be written. It was against this background that Emerson asked in\n1836, in the first paragraph of Nature: \u201cWhy should we\nnot have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and\na religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs\u201d\n(O, 5). The individual\u2019s \u201crevelation\u201d\u2014or\n\u201cintuition,\u201d as Emerson was later to speak of it\u2014was\nto be the counter both to Unitarian empiricism and Humean\nskepticism.\n\nAn important source for the transcendentalists\u2019 knowledge of\nGerman philosophy was Frederic Henry Hedge (1805\u201390).\nHedge\u2019s father Levi Hedge, a Harvard professor of logic, sent\nhim to preparatory school in Germany at the age of thirteen, after\nwhich he attended the Harvard Divinity School. Ordained as a Unitarian\nminister, Hedge wrote a long review of the work of Samuel Taylor\nColeridge for the Christian Examiner in 1833. Noting\nColeridge\u2019s fondness for \u201cGerman metaphysics\u201d and\nhis immense gifts of erudition and expression, he laments that\nColeridge had not made Kant and the post-Kantians more accessible to\nan English-speaking audience. This is the task\u2014to introduce the\n\u201ctranscendental philosophy\u201d of Kant, (T, 87)\u2014that\nHedge takes up. In particular, he explains Kant\u2019s idea of a\nCopernican Revolution in philosophy: \u201c[S]ince the supposition\nthat our intuitions depend on the nature of the world without, will\nnot answer, assume that the world without depends on the nature of our\nintuitions.\u201d This \u201ckey to the whole critical\nphilosophy,\u201d Hedge continues, explains the possibility of\n\u201ca priori knowledge\u201d (T, 92). Hedge organized what\neventually became known as the Transcendental Club, by suggesting to\nEmerson in 1836 that they form a discussion group for disaffected\nyoung Unitarian clergy. The group included George Ripley and Bronson\nAlcott, had some 30 meetings in four years, and was a sponsor of\nThe Dial and Brook Farm. Hedge was a vocal opponent of\nslavery in the 1830s and a champion of women\u2019s rights in the\n1850s, but he remained a Unitarian minister, and became a professor at\nthe Harvard Divinity School.\n\nAnother source for the transcendentalists\u2019 knowledge of German\nphilosophy was Germaine de Sta\u00ebl (Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker)\n(1766\u20131817), whose De l\u2019Allemagne (On\nGermany) was a favorite of the young Emerson. In a sweeping\nsurvey of European metaphysics and political philosophy, de Sta\u00ebl\npraises Locke\u2019s devotion to liberty, but sees him as the\noriginator of a sensationalist school of epistemology that leads to\nthe skepticism of Hume. She finds an attractive contrast in the German\ntradition that begins with Leibniz and culminates in Kant, which\nasserts the power and authority of the mind.\n\nJames Marsh (1794\u20131842), a graduate of Andover and the president\nof the University of Vermont, was equally important for the emerging\nphilosophy of transcendentalism. Marsh was convinced that German\nphilosophy held the key to a reformed theology. His American edition\nof Coleridge\u2019s Aids to Reflection (1829) introduced\nColeridge\u2019s version\u2014much indebted to Schelling\u2014of\nKantian terminology, terminology that runs throughout Emerson\u2019s\nearly work. In Nature, for example, Emerson writes:\n\u201cThe Imagination may be defined to be, the use which the Reason\nmakes of the material world\u201d (O, 25).\n\nGerman philosophy and literature was also championed by Thomas\nCarlyle, whom Emerson met on his first trip to Europe in 1831.\nCarlyle\u2019s philosophy of action in such works as Sartor\nResartus resonates with Emerson\u2019s idea in \u201cThe\nAmerican Scholar\u201d that action\u2014along with nature and\n\u201cthe mind of the Past\u201d (O, 39) is essential to human\neducation. Along with his countrymen Coleridge and Wordsworth, Carlyle\nembraced a \u201cnatural supernaturalism,\u201d the view that\nnature, including human beings, has the power and authority\ntraditionally attributed to an independent deity.\n\nPiety towards nature was also a main theme of William Wordsworth,\nwhose poetry was in vogue in America in the 1820s. Wordsworth\u2019s\ndepiction of an active and powerful mind cohered with the shaping\npower of the mind that his collaborator in the Lyrical\nBallads, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, traced to Kant. The idea of\nsuch power pervades Emerson\u2019s Nature, where he writes\nof nature as \u201cobedient\u201d to spirit and counsels each of us\nto \u201cBuild \u2026 your own world.\u201d Wordsworth has his\nmore receptive mode as well, in which he calls for \u201ca heart that\nwatches and receives\u201d (in \u201cThe Tables Turned\u201d), and\nwe find Emerson\u2019s receptive mode from Nature onward, as\nwhen he recounts an ecstatic experience in the woods: \u201cI become\na transparent eyeball. I am nothing; I see all; The currents of the\nuniversal being circulate through me.\u201d (O, 6).\n\nEmerson\u2019s sense that men and women are, as he put it in\nNature, gods \u201cin ruins,\u201d led to one of\ntranscendentalism\u2019s defining events, his delivery of an address\nat the Harvard Divinity School graduation in 1838. Emerson portrayed\nthe contemporary church that the graduates were about to lead as an\n\u201ceastern monarchy of a Christianity\u201d that had become an\n\u201cinjuror of man\u201d (O, 58). Jesus, in contrast, was a\n\u201cfriend of man.\u201d Yet he was just one of the \u201ctrue\nrace of prophets,\u201d whose message is not so much their own\ngreatness, as the \u201cgreatness of man\u201d (O, 57). Emerson\nrejects the Unitarian argument that miracles prove the truth of\nChristianity, not simply because the evidence is weak, but because\nproof of the sort they envision embodies a mistaken view of the nature\nof religion: \u201cconversion by miracles is a profanation of the\nsoul.\u201d Emerson\u2019s religion is based not on testimony but on\na \u201cperception\u201d that produces a \u201creligious\nsentiment\u201d (O, 55).\n\nThe \u201cDivinity School Address\u201d drew a quick and angry\nresponse from Andrews Norton (1786\u20131853) of the Harvard Divinity\nSchool, often known as the \u201cUnitarian Pope.\u201d In \u201cThe\nNew School in Literature and Religion\u201d (1838), Norton complains\nof \u201ca restless craving for notoriety and excitement,\u201d\nwhich he traces to German \u201cspeculatists\u201d and\n\u201cbarbarians\u201d and \u201cthat hyper-Germanized Englishman,\nCarlyle.\u201d Emerson\u2019s \u201cAddress,\u201d he concludes,\nis at once \u201can insult to religion\u201d (T, 248) and \u201can\nincoherent rhapsody\u201d (T, 249).\n\nAn earlier transcendentalist scandal surrounded the publication of\nAmos Bronson Alcott\u2019s Conversations with Children Upon the\nGospels (1836). Alcott (1799\u20131888) was a self-taught\neducator from Connecticut who established a series of schools that\naimed to \u201cdraw out\u201d the intuitive knowledge of children.\nHe found anticipations of his views about a priori knowledge in the\nwritings of Plato and Kant, and support in Coleridge\u2019s Aids\nto Reflection for the idea that idealism and materiality could be\nreconciled. Alcott replaced the hard benches of the common schools\nwith more comfortable furniture that he built himself, and left a\ncentral space in his classrooms for dancing. The Conversations\nwith Children Upon the Gospels, based on a school Alcott (and his\nassistant Elizabeth Peabody) ran in Boston, argued that evidence for\nthe truth of Christianity could be found in the unimpeded flow of\nchildren\u2019s thought. What people particularly noticed about\nAlcott\u2019s book, however, were its frank discussions of\nconception, circumcision, and childbirth. Rather than gaining support\nfor his school, the publication of the book caused many parents to\nwithdraw their children from it, and the school\u2014like many of\nAlcott\u2019s projects, failed.\n\nTheodore Parker (1810\u201360) was the son of a farmer who attended\nHarvard and became a Unitarian minister and accomplished linguist. He\npublished a long critical essay on David Friedrich Strauss\u2019s\nDas Leben Jesu, and translated Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de\nWette\u2019s Introduction to the Old Testament, both of\nwhich cast doubt on the divine inspiration and single authorship of\nthe Bible. After the publication of his \u201cA Discourse Concerning\nthe Transient and Permanent in Christianity\u201d (1841) he was\ninvited to resign from the Boston Association of Ministers (he did\nnot), and was no longer welcome in many pulpits. He argued, much as\nEmerson had in the \u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d that\nChristianity had nothing essential to do with the person of Jesus:\n\u201cIf Jesus taught at Athens, and not at Jerusalem; if he had\nwrought no miracle, and none but the human nature had ever been\nascribed to him; if the Old Testament had forever perished at his\nbirth, Christianity would still have been the Word of God \u2026\njust as true, just as lasting, just as beautiful, as now it\nis\u2026\u201d (T, 352). Parker exploited the similarities between\nscience and religious doctrine to argue that although nature and\nreligious truth are permanent, any merely human version of such truth\nis transient. In religious doctrines especially, there are stunning\nreversals, so that \u201cmen are burned for professing what men are\nburned for denying\u201d (T, 347).\n\nSurveying the scene in his 1842 lecture, \u201cThe\nTranscendentalist,\u201d Emerson begins with a philosophical account,\naccording to which what are generally called \u201cnew views\u201d\nare not really new, but rather part of a broad tradition of idealism.\nIt is not a skeptical idealism, however, but an anti-skeptical\nidealism deriving from Kant:\n\nIt is well known to most of my audience, that the Idealism of the\npresent day acquired the name of Transcendental, from the use of that\nterm by Immanuel Kant, of Konigsberg [sic], who replied to the\nskeptical philosophy of Locke, which insisted that there was nothing\nin the intellect which was not previously in the experience of the\nsenses, by showing that there was a very important class of ideas, or\nimperative forms, which did not come by experience, but through which\nexperience was acquired; that these were intuitions of the mind\nitself; and he denominated them Transcendental forms (O, 101\u20132).\n\n\nEmerson shows here a basic understanding of three Kantian claims,\nwhich can be traced throughout his philosophy: that the human mind\n\u201cforms\u201d experience; that the existence of such mental\noperations is a counter to skepticism; and that\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d does not mean \u201ctranscendent\u201d\nor beyond human experience altogether, but something through which\nexperience is made possible. Emerson\u2019s idealism is not purely\nKantian, however, for (like Coleridge\u2019s) it contains a strong\nadmixture of Neoplatonism and post-Kantian idealism. Emerson thinks of\nReason, for example, as a faculty of \u201cvision,\u201d as opposed\nto the mundane understanding, which \u201ctoils all the time,\ncompares, contrives, adds, argues\u2026.\u201d (Letters,\nvol. 1, 413). For many of the transcendentalists the term\n\u201ctranscendentalism\u201d represented nothing so technical as an\ninquiry into the presuppositions of human experience, but a new\nconfidence in and appreciation of the mind\u2019s powers, and a\nmodern, non-doctrinal spirituality. The transcendentalist, Emerson\nstates, believes in miracles, conceived as \u201cthe perpetual\nopenness of the human mind to new influx of light and\npower\u2026\u201d (O, 100).\n\nEmerson keeps his distance from the transcendentalists in his essay by\nspeaking always of what \u201cthey\u201d say or do, despite the fact\nthat he was regarded then and is regarded now as the leading\ntranscendentalist. He notes with some disdain that the\ntranscendentalists are \u201c\u2019not good members of\nsociety,\u201d that they do not work for \u201cthe abolition of the\nslave-trade\u201d (though both these charges have been leveled at\nhim). He closes the essay nevertheless with a defense of the\ntranscendentalist critique of a society pervaded by \u201ca spirit of\ncowardly compromise and seeming, which intimates a frightful\nskepticism, a life without love, and an activity without an aim\u201d\n(O, 106). This critique is Emerson\u2019s own in such writings as\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d and \u201cThe American Scholar\u201d;\nand it finds a powerful and original restatement in the\n\u201cEconomy\u201d chapter of Thoreau\u2019s Walden.\n",
