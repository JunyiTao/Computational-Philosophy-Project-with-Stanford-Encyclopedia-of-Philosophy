    "main_text": "History || Hobbes, Locke, Kant\n1.2 Hobbes, Locke, Kant\n\nThese three modern-era thinkers, though they differ in many ways, hold\nsurprisingly similar views of the nature of coercion and its role in\nthe function of justice and the state. Hobbes\u2019s fame as a\npolitical theorist derives at least in part from the central role he\ngives to coercion as a necessary part of a state\u2019s function.\nNoticing that many contracts require one party to perform one\u2019s\nobligations before the other party acts, Hobbes suggests that such\nfirst performance would be irrational if one had no means to secure\nthe subsequent performance of one\u2019s bargaining partner.\n\nFor he that performs first has no assurance the other will perform\nafter; because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle men\u2019s\nambition, avarice, anger, and other Passions, without the fear of some\ncoercive Power. \u2026 But in a civil estate, where there is a Power\nset up to constrain those that would otherwise violate their faith,\nthat fear is no more reasonable; and for that cause, he which by the\nCovenant is to perform first, is obliged so to do (Hobbes 1651,\nCh.14).\n\n\nInterestingly, Hobbes seems to share Aquinas\u2019 view that acting\nfrom fear does not undercut the voluntariness of one\u2019s acts, as\nhe famously asserts that \u201ccovenants extorted by fear are\nvalid\u201d (Hobbes 1651, Ch. 14).\n\nMore generally, the very possibility of establishing justice and\ninjustice depends on the possibility of coercing subjects to abide by\ntheir covenants.\n\n[W]here there is no coercive Power erected, that is, where there is no\nCommonwealth, there is no Propriety; all men having Right to all\nthings: Therefore where there is no Commonwealth, there nothing is\nUnjust. So that the nature of Justice, consists in keeping of valid\nCovenants: but the Validity of Covenants begins not but with the\nConstitution of a Civil Power, sufficient to compel men to keep them:\nAnd then it is also that Propriety begins (Hobbes 1651, Ch. 15).\n\n\nHobbes thus holds that coercion is essential to both the justification\nof and function of the state or commonwealth. In fact, it is a law of\nnature that we seek the protection of the Leviathan\u2019s coercive\npowers in order to exit the perilous conditions of the state of\nnature.\n\nLocke very rarely uses the term \u201ccoercion\u201d or its\n variants,[3]\n but he believes like Hobbes that the function of the state is\nintimately tied to its role in securing individuals against those who\nwould kill, injure or rob them.\n\nPolitical power, then, I take to be a right of making laws, with\npenalties of death, and consequently all less penalties for the\nregulating and preserving of property, and of employing the force of\nthe community in the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the\ncommonwealth from foreign injury, and all this only for the public\ngood (Locke 1823 [1689], Sec. 3).\n\n\nLocke, more so than Hobbes, is wary of the power of the sovereign, but\nis less anxious about conditions in the state of nature. One reason\nfor this reversal of concern, he suggests, is that sovereigns are more\npotent oppressors than ordinary inhabitants of the state of nature,\ndue to the ability of sovereigns to organize force and violence (Locke\n1823 [1689], Sec. 137).\n\nBecause individuals cannot reasonably give up power to an unchecked\nsovereign, Locke also holds that an agent\u2019s ability to possess\nand use that power effectively depends in many ways on the rightness\nof that agent\u2019s use of power. In particular, Locke seems to\nsuggest that a system of property rights cannot be enforced by the\nstate if it renders others unable to secure their own economic\nsurvival. One is entitled to the protection of what one has labored to\ncreate so long as, with respect to land and other natural resources,\n\u201cthere is enough, and as good, left in common for others\u201d\n(Locke 1823 [1689], Sec. 27). This \u201cLockean proviso,\u201d as\nNozick called it (Nozick 1974, p. 175 ff), creates a sort of\nbaseline condition against which the acceptability of any set of\ncoercive arrangements can be judged. So for Locke, more than for\nHobbes, the power of the sovereign rests on the consent of those\ngoverned \u2014 not only for its justification, but also for its\nstability against revolution, about which Locke was clearly more\nsanguine than Hobbes.\n\nKant also gives considerable attention to the importance of coercion\nfor guaranteeing rights of citizens, though he says little that would\nexplain what he means by his use of the term. Kant\u2019s only\nprominent discussion of coercion occurs in his Doctrine of\n Right,[4]\n a treatise on the nature of law. Kant thinks there are two sorts of\n\u201cincentives\u201d to follow the law: ethical and\njuridical. The ethical (i.e., rational) incentive to follow\nthe law is the motive of duty. But since the wills of some people are\ndetermined pathologically \u2014 that is, by inclinations and\naversions, rather than by duty \u2014 there needs also to be a way to\nget such persons to follow the law as well, through such means as\naversion to punishment (Kant 1996 [1797], 20 [AK 6, 219]). Coercion is\nthen a tool the law uses to get the lawless to respect the rights of\nothers whether they want to or not. He associates it with the\nexecutive authority of the state\u2019s ruler, and the ruler\u2019s\nuse of punishment in conformity with the law. Kant makes clear that\ncoercion counts as a hindrance to freedom, in which respect it is\nsimilar to all violations of a person\u2019s rights. But coercion can\nbe used to prevent other rights violations, and thus may be justified\non the grounds that it counts as a hindrance to a hindrance to\nfreedom. \u201cRight and authorization to use coercion therefore mean\none and the same thing\u201d (Kant 1996 [1797], 26 [AK 6, 232]).\n\nKant\u2019s views on the necessity of coercion for the existence of\nright differ from those of Hobbes and Locke, but he is in general\nsympathetic to the idea that states require the ability to use\ncoercion in defense of the equal freedom of their subjects. Without\nsuch coercive abilities, one can have \u201cprivate right,\u201d but\nthat is no more than the rights one has in the state of nature, which\nare by no means secure.\n\nIt is true that the state of nature need not, just because it is\nnatural, be a state of injustice, of dealing with one another\nonly in terms of the degree of force each has. But it would still be a\nstate devoid of justice \u2026 in which when rights are\nin dispute there would be no judge competent to render a\nverdict having rightful force. Hence each may impel the other by force\nto leave this state and enter into a rightful condition; \u2026\n[the] acquisition [of right] is still only provisional as\nlong as it does not yet have the sanction of public law, since it is\nnot determined by public (distributive) justice and secured by an\nauthority putting this right into effect (Kant 1996 [1797], 90 [AK 6,\n312]).\n\n\nSo Kant, like Hobbes and Locke, sees it as a necessity for people to\nestablish a state with coercive powers in order to achieve\njustice.\n",
