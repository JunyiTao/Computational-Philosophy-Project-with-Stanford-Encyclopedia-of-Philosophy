Dissolving Descriptions\n\nAs noted in the beginning of this article, the Russellian account of\ndescriptions not only offers a quantificational as opposed to a\nreferential account of descriptions, but it packs three different\nclaims into the analysis of descriptions: an existence claim,\na uniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. As we\nwill see, all of these claims can be put under pressure, and all three\narguably collapse under that pressure. Let\u2019s begin by examining\nthe uniqueness claim.\n",
