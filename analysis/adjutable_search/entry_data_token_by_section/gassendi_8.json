    "main_text": "Logic\n9. Logic\n\n\nBroadly speaking, Gassendi expresses some three notions of logic in\nthe Syntagma. The first, enunciated in the history of logic\nsection that appears immediately prior to the Institutio\nLogica, suggests a picture of logic along heuristic and didactic\nlines, in the manner of Ramus, whose theory Gassendi lauds as a guide\nto organizing and presenting existing knowledge (O I 59a-62b). The\nsecond suggests that logic consists in the Aristotelian syllogistic,\nthe understanding thereof, and related methodological concerns. The\nthird suggests that logic consists in the study and use of causal\nreasoning, and related methodological concerns\u2014most notably\nincluding an exposition of regressus demonstrativa theory in\nthe manner of Zabarella and Nifo (this notion expressly contradicts\nhis Exercitationes view that such causal reasoning cannot be\njustified).  These latter two notions yield the main thrust of the\nInstitutio (though the discussion of demonstration in Book IV\nhas clear Ramist debts). They also have great currency for Gassendi,\nwho typically crafts his use of syllogism and causal inference and\nmethod after his Institutio conceptions, or at least signals\nthat he intends to do so. The same may not be said for his Ramist\nconception.  For although he makes ample use of rhetoric, he does not\nturn to definition, distribution, or division for the purposes of\ndiagramming or expounding existing knowledge\u2014per the logic of\nRamus\u2014in any way that matches his interest in the traditionally\nAristotelian conception of analysis as problem-solving.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that a fourth notion\u2014a psychologistic\naccount of cognitive operations, and perception in particular\u2014is\na prominent goal of Gassendi's logic (Michael, 1997). While such\ndiscussion forms part of the Institutio presentation, it is\nby no means the main goal of the work or of Gassendi's conception of\nlogic.  This can be seen from the thrust and length of his discussion\nof the first three elements, and in particular syllogistic and causal\nreasoning, and their attendant methodologies.\n",
