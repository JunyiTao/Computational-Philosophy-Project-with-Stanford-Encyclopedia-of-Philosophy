    "main_text": "\n\nMoses Mendelssohn (b. 1729, d. 1786) was a creative and eclectic\nthinker whose writings on metaphysics and aesthetics, political theory\nand theology, together with his Jewish heritage, placed him at the\nfocal point of the German Enlightenment for over three decades. While\nMendelssohn found himself at home with a metaphysics derived from\nwritings of Leibniz, Wolff, and Baumgarten, he was also one of his\nage\u2019s most accomplished literary critics. His highly regarded\npieces on works of Homer and Aesop, Pope and Burke, Maupertuis and\nRousseau \u2014 to cite only a fraction of his numerous critical\nessays \u2014 appeared in a series of journals that he co-edited with\nG. E. Lessing and Friedrich Nicolai. Dubbed \u201cthe Jewish\nLuther,\u201d Mendelssohn also contributed significantly to the life\nof the Jewish community and letters in Germany, campaigning for\nJews\u2019 civil rights and translating the Pentateuch and the Psalms\ninto German. Not surprisingly, as a Jew with an unwavering belief in\nthe harmonizing effects of rational analysis and discourse,\nMendelssohn rankled both institutional and self-appointed advocates of\nChristianity as well as Judaism. Thus, Johann Lavater infamously\nchallenged him to refute the arguments of the Pietist theologian,\nCharles Bonnet, or convert to Christianity (a challenge that\nMendelssohn effectively disabled with a plea for tolerance and a\nseries of reasons for refraining from such religious controversy).\nSimilarly, some Jewish thinkers took exception to Mendelssohn\u2019s\nJerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism and its argument\nfor conceiving Judaism as a religion founded upon reason alone. In\naddition to the \u201cLavater affair\u201d and his work as editor\nand critic, Mendelssohn was probably best known to his contemporaries\nfor his penetrating accounts of the experience of the sublime, for\nlucid arguments for the soul\u2019s immortality and God\u2019s\nexistence, for his close association with G. E. Lessing, for his\nprotracted \u201cpantheism dispute\u201d\n(Pantheismusstreit) with Jacobi during the 1780s, and for his\ninsistence that Lessing was not the Spinozist that Jacobi portrayed\nhim to be. To posterity he is perhaps best known as the model for\nNathan der Weise, the protagonist in Lessing\u2019s famous\nplay of the same name, championing religious tolerance. In the history\nof 18th century German philosophy, the contrasting yet also\noften complementary styles and approaches of Mendelssohn\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s philosophies play a central role. In a monumental\ncomparative study of their philosophies, Paul Guyer demonstrates that\nboth philosophers are \u201csynthesizers of rationalism and\nempiricism\u201d with different accents and strengths respectively\n\u2013 Kant drawing a \u201cricher picture\u201d of the human\nintellect, Mendelssohn of human experience (not least when it comes to\naesthetics and religion; see Guyer 2020, 4\u20135). \n",
