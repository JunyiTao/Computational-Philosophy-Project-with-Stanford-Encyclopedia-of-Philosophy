    "main_text": "The Nature of Intuitions || Intuitions as Dispositions to Believe\n1.2 Intuitions as Dispositions to Believe\n\nPeter van Inwagen claims that intuitions might be\n\n\nin some cases, the tendencies that make certain beliefs attractive to\nus, that \u2018move\u2019 us in the direction of accepting certain\npropositions without taking us all the way to acceptance. (1997:\n309)\n\n\nThis suggests something like the following:\n\n[A4] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if S is disposed to believe\np.\n\n\nIf a disposition to believe is a propositional attitude, such an\naccount would allow that intuitions are propositional attitudes and,\nunlike belief analyses, allow that one may have an intuition without\nbelief. However, [A4] appears too liberal in placing no constraints on\nthe nature or source of the disposition in question. One might be\ndisposed to believe that a dog is nearby if one turns one\u2019s head\nand looks, disposed to believe one is in pain if one reflects upon\nit, or even disposed to believe a complex theorem if one were to reason\nappropriately. None of these cases of being disposed to believe is,\ntaken alone, sufficient for an intuition. Additionally, [A4] has, on\nsome views of dispositions, the implication that a person\u2019s\nbelieving p cannot be explained by their having an intuition\nthat p.\n\nSuch concerns about [A4] may be met with a restriction on the ground\nof the disposition. A more plausible account (Sosa 1998) is:\n\n[A5] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if S is disposed to believe\np merely on the basis of understanding p.\n\n\nHowever, many claim that the primary notion of intuition is one on\nwhich S has an intuition that p only when S is\noccurrently in the relevant conscious psychological state. If so, any\npurely dispositionalist account fails to capture the occurrent\nconscious character of intuitions in much the way dispositional\nanalyses of other conscious states fail. It is quite possible to have,\nat a time, a large number of dispositions to believe while failing to\nhost, at that time, a single intuition. For example, a person might\nhave an intuition that the na\u00efve comprehension axiom is true when\nasked to consider it, but not have such an intuition while driving\nhome in heavy traffic. And yet it may be true throughout that she is\ndisposed to believe the proposition merely upon understanding it\n(Bealer 1998: 209). As well, one may now have direct introspective\nknowledge that one has an intuition that p while one has no\nsuch direct introspective knowledge regarding one\u2019s\ndispositions, especially one\u2019s non-activated dispositions, to\nbelieve on the basis of mere understanding.
