    "main_text": "The Debate After Davidson || Changing the Subject\n3.3 Changing the Subject\n\n\nA final revisionist strand now emerging in the literature takes the\nagent\u2019s better judgment even farther out of the picture. In an\noutstandingly lucid and stimulating essay published in 1999 (see also\nhis 2009, ch. 4), Richard Holton argued that weakness of will is not\naction contrary to one\u2019s better judgment at all. The literature has\ngone astray in understanding weakness of will in this way; weakness of\nwill is actually quite a different phenomenon, in which the agent\u2019s\nbetter judgment plays no\n role.[14]\n For Holton, when ordinary people speak of weakness of will they have \nin mind a certain kind of failure to act on one\u2019s \nintentions. What matters for weakness of will, then, is not whether\nyou deem another course of action superior at the time of action. It \nis whether you are abandoning an intention you previously formed. \nWeakness of will as the untutored understand it is not \nakrasia (if we reserve that term for action contrary to \none\u2019s better judgment), but rather a certain kind of failure to stick to \none\u2019s plans.[15] \nThis understanding of weakness of will changes the \nsubject in two ways. First, the state of the agent with which the \nweak-willed action is in conflict is not an evaluative judgment (as \nin akrasia) but a different kind of state, namely an \nintention. Second, it is not essential that there be \nsynchronic conflict, as akrasia demands. You must \nact contrary to your present better judgment in order to \nexhibit akrasia; conflict with a previous better \njudgment does not indicate akrasia, but merely a change of \nmind. However, you can exhibit weakness of will as Holton understands\nit simply by abandoning a previously formed intention.\n\n\nOf course not all cases of abandoning or failing to act on a \npreviously formed intention count as weakness of will. I intend \nto run five miles tomorrow evening. If I break my leg tomorrow \nmorning and fail to run five miles tomorrow evening, I will not have \nexhibited weakness of will. How can we characterize \nwhich failures to act on a previously formed intention count\nas weakness of will? Holton\u2019s answer has two parts. First, he says, \nthere is an irreducible normative dimension to the question whether \nsomeone\u2019s abandoning of an intention constituted weakness of will \n(Holton 1999, \n p. 259).[16] \nThat is, there is no purely \ndescriptive criterion (such as whether her action conflicted with her\nbetter judgment) which is sufficient for weakness of will; in order \nto decide whether a given case was an instance of weakness of will we\nmust consider normative questions, such as whether it was \nreasonable for the agent to have abandoned or revised that \nintention, or whether she should have done so. In the case \nof my broken leg, for instance, it was clearly reasonable for me to \nabandon my intention; that is why I could not be charged with \nweakness of will in that case.\n\n\nSecond, says Holton, we need to attend to an important subclass of \nour intentions to do something at a future time, namely \ncontrary-inclination-defeating intentions, or, as he\nlater terms them (Holton 2003), resolutions. \nResolutions are intentions that are formed precisely in order to \ninsulate one against contrary inclinations one expects to feel when \nthe time comes. Thus one reason I might form an intention on Monday \nto run five miles on Tuesday\u2014as opposed to leaving the issue \nopen until Tuesday, for decision then\u2014is to reduce the effect \nof feelings of lassitude to which I fear I may be subject when \nTuesday rolls around. Then suppose Tuesday rolls around; I am indeed \nprey to feelings of lassitude; and I decide as a result not to run. \nNow I can be charged with weakness of will. Weakness of will\ninvolves, specifically, a failure to act on a resolution; \nthis is sufficient to differentiate weakness of will from mere change\nof mind and even from caprice (which is a different species \nof unreasonable intention revision, according to Holton).\n\n\nAs a later paper by Alison McIntyre shows (McIntyre 2006), \nunderstanding weakness of will in this way casts a fresh light on the\nissue of its rational status. The weak-willed agent abandons a \nresolution because of a contrary inclination of exactly the type \nwhich the resolution was expressly designed to defeat. Therefore, as \nMcIntyre underlines, weak-willed action always involves a procedural \nrational \n defect:[17]\n a technique of self-management has been deployed but has failed \n(McIntyre 2006, p. 296). To that extent we have grounds to \ncriticize weak-willed action simply in virtue of the second of the \nways in which Holton wishes to distinguish weakness of will from a \nmere change of mind, without even resolving the potentially murky \nissue of whether the agent was reasonable in abandoning her \nintention.\n\n\nMcIntyre holds, however, that it would be overstating the case to say\nthat because weakness of will involves this procedural defect, it is \nalways irrational (McIntyre 2006, p. 290; \npp. 298\u20139; p. 302). She proposes rather that \npractical rationality has multiple facets and aims, and that failure \nin one respect or along one dimension does not automatically justify \nthe especially severe form of rational criticism which we intend by \nthe term \u201cirrational.\u201d For example, consider an agent who\nsuccumbs to contrary inclination of exactly the type expected when \nthe time comes to act on a truly stupid resolution. (Holton \ngives the example of resolving to go without water for two days just \nto see what it feels like: Holton 2003, p. 42.) There will \nindeed be a blemish on this agent\u2019s rational scorecard if he \neventually gives in and drinks: he will have failed in his attempt at\nself-management. But wouldn\u2019t it be rationally far worse for\nhim to stick to his silly resolution no matter what the cost?\n\n\nWe can also re-examine the issue of the rationality of \nakrasia in light of this analysis of weakness of will; for \nwe can distinguish between akratic and non-akratic cases of the \nlatter. As McIntyre points out, resolutions typically rest on \njudgments about what it is best that one do at a (future) time \nt. If an agent fails to act on a previously formed \nresolution to do a at t, thus exhibiting weakness \nof will, we can distinguish the case in which he still endorses at \nt the judgment that it is best that he do a at \nt (even though he does not do it) from the case in which he \nabandons that judgment as well as his resolution. In the latter, \nnon-akratic type of case, the agent in effect rationalizes his \nfailure to live up to his resolution by deciding that it is not after\nall best that he do a at t. McIntyre points out \nthat the traditional view that akrasia is always irrational \nseems to give us a perverse incentive to rationalize, since in that \ncase we escape the grave charge of practical irrationality, being \nleft only with the procedural practical defect present in all cases \nof weakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 291). But this seems\nimplausible: are the two sub-cases so radically different in their \nrational status? Indeed, she argues, if anything, akratic weakness of\nwill is typically rationally preferable to rationalizing \nweakness of will (McIntyre 2006, p. 287; pp. 309ff.). \n\u201cIn the presence of powerful contrary inclinations that bring \nabout a failure to be resolute,\u201d she writes, \u201cresisting \nrationalization and remaining clearheaded about one\u2019s reasons to act \ncan constitute a modest accomplishment\u201d (McIntyre 2006, \np. 311). Have we witnessed the transformation of \nakrasia from impossible, to irrational, to downright \nadmirable?\n",
