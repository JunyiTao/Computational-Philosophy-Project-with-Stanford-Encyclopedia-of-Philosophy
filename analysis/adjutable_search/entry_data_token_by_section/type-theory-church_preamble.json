    "main_text": "\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory, aka simple type theory, is a formal\nlogical language which includes classical first-order and\npropositional logic, but is more expressive in a practical sense. It\nis used, with some modifications and enhancements, in most modern\napplications of type theory. It is particularly well suited to the\nformalization of mathematics and other disciplines and to specifying\nand verifying hardware and software. It also plays an important role\nin the study of the formal semantics of natural language. When\nutilizing it as a meta-logic to semantically embed expressive\n(quantified) non-classical logics further topical applications are\nenabled in artificial intelligence and philosophy.\n\nA great wealth of technical knowledge can be expressed very naturally\nin it. With possible enhancements, Church\u2019s type theory\nconstitutes an excellent formal language for representing the\nknowledge in automated information systems, sophisticated automated\nreasoning systems, systems for verifying the correctness of\nmathematical proofs, and a range of projects involving logic and\nartificial intelligence. Some examples and further references are\ngiven in Sections\n 1.2.2\n and\n 5\n below. \n\nType theories are also called higher-order logics, since they allow\nquantification not only over individual variables (as in first-order\nlogic), but also over function, predicate, and even higher order\nvariables. Type theories characteristically assign types to entities,\ndistinguishing, for example, between numbers, sets of numbers,\nfunctions from numbers to sets of numbers, and sets of such functions.\nAs illustrated in\n Section 1.2.2\n below, these distinctions allow one to discuss the conceptually rich\nworld of sets and functions without encountering the paradoxes of\nnaive set theory.\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory is a formulation of type theory that was\nintroduced by Alonzo Church in Church 1940. In certain respects, it is\nsimpler and more general than the type theory introduced by Bertrand\nRussell in Russell 1908 and Whitehead & Russell 1927a. Since\nproperties and relations can be regarded as functions from entities to\ntruth values, the concept of a function is taken as primitive in\nChurch\u2019s type theory, and the \u03bb-notation which Church\nintroduced in Church 1932 and Church 1941 is incorporated into the\nformal language. Moreover, quantifiers and description operators are\nintroduced in a way so that additional binding mechanisms can be\navoided, \u03bb-notation is reused instead. \u03bb-notation is\nthus the only binding mechanism employed in Church\u2019s type\ntheory.\n",
