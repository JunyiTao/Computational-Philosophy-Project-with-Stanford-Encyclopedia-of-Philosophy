Transformational pacifism articulates\na broad framework of cultural criticism and includes an effort to\nreform educational and cultural practices that tend to support\nviolence and war. The goal of transformational pacifism is a world in\nwhich war and violence appear to be archaic remnants of less civilized\npast. The author of the present entry has contributed to the idea of\n\u201ctransformative pacifism\u201d as a critical theory of society\nthat critiques militarism and the assumptions of warrior culture while\noffering a more peaceful ethical alternative (Fiala 2018).\n\nOne traditional version of transformational pacifism can be found in\npacifist religious traditions. For example, Jesus articulated a\nrevaluation of values from the standpoint of a more pacific\nunderstanding of God\u2019s commandments. Instead of retaliation and\nthe logic of \u201can eye for eye,\u201d Jesus claimed that we must\nevolve a new idea\u2014of not returning evil for evil.\nTransformational pacifism is often connected to a progressive\ninterpretation of history that points toward a pacifist goal for human\nevolution. Gandhi thought that such progress was already underway and\nthat history \u201chas been steadily progressing towards ahimsa\n(nonviolence)\u201d (Gandhi 1972, 310\u201311).\n\nTransformational pacifism has been described by Joseph J.\nFahey\u2014who also calls it \u201creconstructionist\u201d\npacifism\u2014as follows: \u201ctransformational pacifists stress\nthe spiritual unity of all people\u2026 they seek not only the\nabolition of war, but also the creation of an international juridical,\npolitical, and economic order that will promote the rights of all\nspecies\u201d (Fahey 1997, 393). War resistance can be located under\nthis general rubric\u2014insofar as war resistance is linked to a\ngeneral criticism of those structures of authority, economic and\npolitical choices, and institutional frameworks that support what is\noften called \u201cthe war system\u201d (see Atack 2001).\n\nTransformational pacifism can also be linked to feminism and feminist\ncritiques of the masculine values found in warrior cultures and the\nwar system (see Poe 2017. Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams is a\nprominent figure here. Addams connected her pragmatic hope for peace\nto democracy and the empowerment of women and the oppressed masses,\nwho had in the past silently suffered from the horrors of war. During\nWorld War I, Addams and her Women\u2019s Peace Party worked to end\nthe war and eventually ended up creating the Women\u2019s\nInternational League for Peace and Freedom. More recently authors such\nas Sara Ruddick and Nel Noddings have connected feminist criticism\nwith pacifism and the ethics of care. Ruddick notes that military\nthinking utilizes a variety of conceptual strategies that create a\nmyth of \u201cthe manly just warrior, which interlocks myths of\nmasculinity, sacrifice, and heroic death\u201d (Ruddick 1995, 202).\nNoddings has noted that \u201ccare ethics\u201d does not support\nabsolute pacifism, since care-givers may in rare circumstances kill in\norder to defend those they love. Nonetheless, Noddings argues that\ncare ethics and feminism are concerned with a general critique of the\nmilitaristic and violent assumptions of male-dominant culture.\nNoddings contends that our culture \u201cputs a high value on the\naggressive tendencies of males\u201d (Noddings 2010, 215). Her\nsolution is to re-create culture and education in such as way as to\ndevalue aggression and provide support for love, nurturance,\nsolidarity, and care.\n",
