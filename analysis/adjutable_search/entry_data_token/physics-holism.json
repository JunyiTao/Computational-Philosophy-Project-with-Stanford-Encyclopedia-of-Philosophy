Introduction\n\nHolism has often been taken as the thesis that the whole is more than\nthe sum of its parts. Several different interpretations of this\nepigram prove relevant to physics, as we shall see. Here is a\ncorrespondingly vague initial statement of nonseparability: The state\nof the whole is not constituted by states of its parts. It is already\napparent both that holism and nonseparability are related notions and\nthat their exact relation needs to be clarified.\n\nIn one interpretation, holism is a methodological thesis\n (Section 2),\n to the effect that the best way to study the behavior of a complex\nsystem is to treat it as a whole, and not merely to analyze the\nstructure and behavior of its component parts. Alternatively, holism\nmay be taken as a metaphysical thesis\n (Section 3):\n There are some wholes whose natures are simply not determined by the\nnature of their parts. Methodological holism stands opposed to\nmethodological reductionism, in physics as well as in other sciences.\nBut it is a certain variety of metaphysical holism that is more\nclosely related to nonseparability. What is at issue here is the\nextent to which the properties of the whole are determined by the\nproperties of its parts: property holism\n (Section 4)\n denies such determination, and thereby comes very close to a thesis\nof nonseparability. In turn, nonseparability can be analyzed either as\nstate nonseparability\n (Section 5),\n or as spatiotemporal nonseparability\n (Section 6).\n By and large, a system in classical physics can be analyzed into\nparts, whose states and properties determine those of the whole they\ncompose\n (Section 7).\n But all hands agree that the state of a system in quantum theory\nresists such analysis. The quantum state of a system specifies its\nchances of exhibiting various properties on measurement. In ordinary\nquantum mechanics, the most complete such specification is given by\nwhat is called a pure state. Even when a compound system has a pure\nstate, some of its subsystems may not have their own pure states.\nEmphasizing this characteristic of quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger\ndescribed such component states as \u201centangled\u201d\n (Section 8).\n Superficially, such entanglement of states already demonstrates\nnonseparability. At a deeper level, it has been maintained that the\npuzzling statistics that arise from measurements on entangled quantum\nsystems either demonstrate, or are explicable in terms of, holism or\nnonseparability rather than any problematic action at a distance\n (Sections 8,\n 9). The Aharonov-Bohm effect\n (Section 10)\n also appears to exhibit action at a distance, as the behavior of\nelectrons is modified by a magnetic field they never experience. But\nthis effect may be understood instead as a result of the local action\nof nonseparable electromagnetism. And indeed, this type of holism is\nnot rooted in quantum mechanics or entanglement: though the\nmeasurement of the Aharonov-Bohm effect uses quantum ingredients, it\nbuilds on the existence of non-separable quantities in classical gauge\ntheory (e.g. electromagnetism) in a vacuum. But even focussing on\ntheories without gauge symmetry, we can obtain puzzling correlations\nbetween distant simultaneous measurements in the vacuum, according to\nquantum field theory\n (Section 12).\n A form of quantum theory used to study them represents systems by\nalgebras of operators with new kinds of states defined on them,\nthereby making room for failures of state and system separability with\nno analogs in ordinary quantum mechanics. String theory\n (Section 13)\n is an ambitious research program in the framework of quantum field\ntheory. According to string theory, all fundamental particles can be\nconsidered to be excitations of underlying non-pointlike entities in a\nmulti-dimensional space. The particles\u2019 intrinsic charge, mass\nand spin may then arise as nonseparable features of the world at the\ndeepest level.\n2. Methodological Holism\n\nMethodologically, holism stands opposed to reductionism, somewhat as\nfollows.\n\nMethodological Holism: An understanding of a certain kind of\ncomplex system is best sought at the level of principles governing the\nbehavior of the whole system, and not at the level of the structure\nand behavior of its component parts.\n\n\nMethodological Reductionism: An understanding of a complex\nsystem is best sought at the level of the structure and behavior of\nits component parts.\n\n\nThis seems to capture much of what is at stake in debates about holism\nin social and biological science. In social science, societies are the\ncomplex systems, composed of individuals; while in biology, the\ncomplex systems are organisms, composed of cells, and ultimately of\nproteins, DNA and other molecules. A methodological individualist\nmaintains that the right way to approach the study of a society is to\ninvestigate the behavior of the individual people that compose it. A\nmethodological holist, on the other hand, believes that such an\ninvestigation will fail to shed much light on the nature and\ndevelopment of society as a whole. There is a corresponding debate\nwithin physics. Methodological reductionists favor an approach to\n(say) condensed matter physics which seeks to understand the behavior\nof a solid or liquid by applying quantum mechanics (say) to its\ncomponent molecules, atoms, ions or electrons. Methodological holists\nthink this approach is misguided: As one condensed matter physicist\nput it \u201cthe most important advances in this area come about by\nthe emergence of qualitatively new concepts at the intermediate or\nmacroscopic levels\u2014concepts which, one hopes, will be compatible\nwith one\u2019s information about the microscopic constituents, but\nwhich are in no sense logically dependent on it.\u201d (Leggett 1987,\np.113)\n\nIt is surprisingly difficult to find methodological reductionists\namong physicists. The elementary particle physicist Steven Weinberg,\nfor example, is an avowed reductionist. He believes that by asking any\nsequence of deeper and deeper why-questions one will arrive ultimately\nat the same fundamental laws of physics. But this explanatory\nreductionism is metaphysical in so far as he takes explanation to be\nan ontic rather than a pragmatic category. On this view, it is not\nphysicists but the fundamental laws themselves that explain why\n\u201chigher level\u201d scientific principles are the way they are.\nWeinberg (1992) explicitly distinguishes his view from methodological\nreductionism by saying that there is no reason to suppose that the\nconvergence of scientific explanations must lead to a convergence of\nscientific methods.\n3. Metaphysical Holism\n\nThe metaphysical holist believes that the nature of some wholes is not\ndetermined by that of their parts. One may distinguish three varieties\nof metaphysical holism: ontological, property and nomological\nholism.\n\nOntological Holism:\n Some objects are not wholly composed of basic physical parts.\n\n\nProperty Holism: Some objects have properties that are not\ndetermined by physical properties of their basic physical parts.\n\n\nNomological Holism: Some objects obey laws that are not\ndetermined by fundamental physical laws governing the structure and\nbehavior of their basic physical parts.\n\n\nAll three theses require an adequate clarification of the notion of a\n basic physical part.\n One way to do this would be to consider objects as basic, relative to\na given class of objects subjected only to a certain kind of process,\njust in case every object in that class continues to be wholly\ncomposed of a fixed set of these (basic) objects. Thus, atoms would\ncount as basic parts of hydrogen if it is burnt to form water, but not\nif it is converted into helium by a thermonuclear reaction. But this\nway excludes consideration of time-slices and point events (for\nexample) as basic (spatio)temporal parts of an object. What counts as\na part, and what parts are basic, are matters best settled in a\nparticular context of enquiry.\n\nWeinberg\u2019s (1992) reductionism is opposed to nomological holism\nin science. He claims, in particular, that thermodynamics has been\nexplained in terms of particles and forces, which could hardly be the\ncase if thermodynamic laws were autonomous. In fact thermodynamics\npresents a fascinating but complex test case for the theses both of\nproperty holism and of nomological holism. One source of complexity is\nthe variety of distinct concepts of both temperature and entropy that\nfigure in both classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\nAnother is the large number of quite differently constituted systems\nto which thermodynamics can be applied, including not just gases and\nelectromagnetic radiation but also magnets, chemical reactions, star\nclusters and black holes. Both sources of complexity require a careful\nexamination of the extent to which thermodynamic properties are\ndetermined by the physical properties of the basic parts of\nthermodynamic systems. A third difficulty stems from the problematic\nstatus of the probability assumptions that are required in addition to\nthe basic mechanical laws in order to recover thermodynamic principles\nwithin statistical mechanics. (An important example is the assumption\nthat the micro-canonical ensemble is to be assigned the standard,\ninvariant, probability distribution.) Since the basic laws of\nmechanics do not determine the principles of thermodynamics without\nsome such assumptions (however weak), there may well be at least one\ninteresting sense in which thermodynamics establishes nomological\nholism. The related entry\n philosophy of statistical mechanics\n contains further discussion of these difficulties, especially in\nSection 6.\n4. Property/Relational Holism\n\nWhile some form of\n ontological holism\n has occasionally been considered, the variety of metaphysical holism\nmost clearly at issue in quantum mechanics and in gauge theory is\nproperty holism. But to see just what the issue is we need a more\ncareful formulation of that thesis.\n\nFirst the thesis should be contextualized to physical\nproperties of composite physical objects. We are interested\nhere in how far a physical object\u2019s properties are fixed by\nthose of its parts, not in some more general determinationist\nphysicalism. Next, to arrive at an interesting formulation of property\nholism we must accept that this thesis is not only concerned with\nproperties, and not concerned with all properties. The properties of a\nwhole will typically depend upon relations among its proper\nparts as well as on properties of the individual parts. But if we are\npermitted to consider all properties and relations among the\nparts, then these trivially determine the properties of the whole they\ncompose. For one relation among the parts is what we might call the\ncomplete composition relation\u2014that relation among the parts\nwhich holds just in case they compose this very whole with all its\nproperties.\n\nLet us call a canonical set of properties and relations of the parts\nwhich may or may not determine the properties and relations of the\nwhole the supervenience basis. To avoid trivializing the theses we are\ntrying to formulate, only certain properties and relations can be\nallowed in the supervenience basis. The intuition as to which these\nare is simple\u2014the supervenience basis is to include just the\nqualitative intrinsic properties and relations of the parts, i.e., the\nproperties and relations which these bear in and of themselves,\nwithout regard to any other objects, and irrespective of any further\nconsequences of their bearing these properties for the properties of\nany wholes they might compose. Unfortunately, this simple intuition\nresists precise formulation. It is notoriously difficult to say\nprecisely what is meant either by an\n intrinsic property\n or relation, or by a purely qualitative property or relation. And the\nother notions appealed to in expressing the simple intuition are\nhardly less problematic. But, imprecise as it is, this statement\nserves already to exclude certain unwanted properties and relations,\nincluding the complete composition relation, from the supervenience\nbasis.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the following opposing theses:\n\nPhysical Property Determination:\n Every qualitative intrinsic physical property and relation of a set\nof physical objects from any domain D subject only\nto type P processes supervenes on qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties and relations in the supervenience basis\nof their\n basic physical parts\n relative to D and P.\n\n\nPhysical Property Holism:\n There is some set of physical objects from a domain D\nsubject only to type P processes,\nnot all of whose qualitative intrinsic physical properties and\nrelations supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties and\nrelations in the supervenience basis of their\n basic physical parts\n (relative to D and \\(P)\\).\n\n\nIf we take the real state of a set of physical objects to be given by\ntheir qualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations, then\nphysical property determination says (while physical property holism\ndenies) that the real state of wholes is determined by the real state\nof their parts.\n\nThere is some residual unclarity in the notion of supervenience that\nfigures in these theses. The idea is familiar enough\u2014that there\ncan be no relevant difference in objects in D\nwithout a relevant difference in their basic physical parts. I take it\nthat the modality involved here is not logical but broadly physical.\nOne might try to explicate the notion of supervenience here in terms\nof models of a true, descriptively complete, physical theory. At issue\nis whether such a physical theory has two models which agree on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations of the basic\nparts of one or more objects in D but disagree on\nsome qualitative intrinsic property or relation of these objects.\n\nTeller (1989) has introduced the related idea of what he calls\nrelational holism.\n\nRelational Holism:\n There are non-supervening relations\u2014that is, relations that do\nnot supervene on the nonrelational properties of the relata. (p. 214)\n\n\nWithin physics, this specializes to a close relative of physical\nproperty holism, namely:\n\nPhysical Relational Holism: There are physical relations\nbetween some physical objects that do not supervene on their\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties.\n\n\nPhysical property holism entails physical relational holism, but not\nvice versa. For suppose that F is some qualitative\nintrinsic physical property or relation of one or more elements of D\nthat fails to supervene on qualitative intrinsic\nphysical properties and relations in the supervenience basis of their\nbasic physical parts. We may define a (non-intrinsic) physical\nrelation \\(R_{F}\\) to hold of the basic physical parts of elements of\nD if and only if F holds of\nthese elements. Clearly \\(R_{F}\\) does not supervene on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties of these parts. So physical\nproperty holism entails physical relational holism. But the converse\nentailment fails. For let \\(R_{G}\\) be a physical relation that holds\nbetween the basic parts of some elements in D when\nand only when those elements are in the relation \\(S_{G}\\). \\(R_{G}\\)\nmay fail to supervene on the qualitative intrinsic physical properties\nof these basic parts, even though all qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties and relations of elements of D\n(including \\(S_{G}\\)) supervene on the qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties and relations of their basic parts.\n\nPhysical relational holism seems at first sight too weak to capture\nany distinctive feature of quantum phenomena: even in classical\nphysics the spatiotemporal relations between physical objects seem not\nto supervene on their qualitative intrinsic physical properties. But\nwhen he introduced relational holism Teller (1987) maintained a view\nof spacetime as a quantity: On this view spatiotemporal relations do\nin fact supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties of\nordinary physical objects, since these include their spatiotemporal\nproperties.\n5. State Nonseparability\n\nPhysics treats systems by assigning them states. The thermodynamic\nstate of a gas specifies its pressure, volume and temperature. The\nstate of a system of classical particles is represented as a point in\na phase space coordinatized by their positions and momenta. One\nexpects that if a physical system is composed of physical subsystems,\nthen both the composite system and its subsystems will be assigned\nstates by the relevant physical theory. One further expects that the\nstate of the whole will not be independent of those of its parts, and\nspecifically that if a system is composed of two subsystems, A\nand B, then it will satisfy a\nprinciple formulated by Einstein (1935). Howard (1985, p.180) gives\nthe following translation of this principle, which I\u2019ll call\nthe\n\nReal State Separability Principle:\n The real state of the pair \\(AB\\) consists precisely of the real\nstate of A and the real state of B,\nwhich states have nothing to do with one another.\n\n\nBut the assignment of states to systems in quantum mechanics seems not\nto conform to these expectations (see related entry\n quantum mechanics).\n Recall that the quantum state of a system specifies its chances of\nexhibiting various properties on measurement. At least in ordinary\nquantum mechanics, the mathematical representative of this state is an\nobject defined in a Hilbert space\u2014a kind of vector space. This\nis analogous in some ways to the representation of the state of a\nsystem of particles in classical mechanics in a phase space. Let us\nformulate a principle of\n\nState Separability:\n The state assigned to a compound physical system at any time is\nsupervenient on the states then assigned to its component subsystems.\n\n\nThis principle could fail in one of two ways: the subsystems may\nsimply not be assigned any states of their own, or else the states\nthey are assigned may fail to determine the state of the system they\ncompose. Interestingly, state assignments in quantum mechanics have\nbeen taken to violate state separability in both ways.\n\nThe quantum state of a system may be either pure or mixed (see related\nentry\n quantum mechanics).\n In ordinary quantum mechanics a pure state is represented by a vector\nin the system\u2019s Hilbert space. On one common understanding, any\n entangled quantum systems\n violate state separability in so far as a vector representing the\nstate of the system they compose does not factorize into a product of\nvectors, one in the Hilbert space of each individual subsystem, that\ncould be taken to represent their pure states. On the other hand, in\nsuch a case each subsystem may be uniquely assigned what is called a\nmixed state represented in its Hilbert space not by a vector but by a\nmore general object\u2014a so-called von Neumann density operator.\nBut then state separability fails for a different reason: the\nsubsystem mixed states do not uniquely determine the compound\nsystem\u2019s state. A failure of state separability may not occasion\nmuch surprise if states are thought of merely in their role of\nspecifying a system\u2019s chances of exhibiting various possible\nproperties on measurement. But it becomes more puzzling if one\nbelieves that a system\u2019s quantum state also has a role in\nspecifying some or all of its categorical properties. For that role\nmay connect a failure of state separability to metaphysical holism and\nnonseparability.\n6. Spatial and Spatiotemporal Nonseparability\n\nThe idea is familiar (particularly to Lego enthusiasts!) that if one\nconstructs a physical object by assembling its physical parts, then\nthe physical properties of that object are wholly determined by the\nproperties of the parts and the way it is put together from them. A\nprinciple of spatial separability tries to capture that idea.\n\nSpatial Separability:\n The qualitative intrinsic physical properties of a compound system\nare supervenient on those of its spatially separated component systems\ntogether with the spatial relations among these component systems.\n\n\nIf we identify the real state of a system with its qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties, then spatial separability is related to\na separability principle stated by Howard (1985, p. 173) to the effect\nthat any two spatially separated systems possess their own separate\nreal states. It is even more closely related to Einstein\u2019s\n(1935)\n real state separability principle.\n Indeed, Einstein formulated this principle in the context of a pair\n\\(A, B\\) of spatially separated systems.\n\nSpatial nonseparability\n \u2014the denial of spatial separability\u2014is also closely\nrelated to\n physical property holism.\n At least classically, spatial relations are the only clear examples\nof qualitative intrinsic physical relations required in the\nsupervenience basis for physical property determination/holism: other\nintrinsic physical relations seem to supervene on them, while any\ninstance of physical property holism due to the spatial separation of\nbasic physical parts would entail spatial nonseparability. But if one\nthought a spatially localized object has a determinate value for a\nmagnitude like mass only by virtue of its mass relations to other such\nobjects elsewhere then one might decide to include those relations in\nthe supervenience basis also (see Dasgupta (2013)).\n\nIf we take a spacetime perspective, then spatial separability\nnaturally generalizes to\n\nSpatiotemporal Separability:\n Any physical process occupying spacetime region R\nsupervenes upon an assignment of qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties at spacetime points in R.\n\n\nSpatiotemporal separability is a natural restriction to physics of\nDavid Lewis\u2019s (1986, p. x) principle of Humean supervenience. It\nis also closely related to another principle formulated by Einstein\n(1948, pp. 233\u2013234 of Howard\u2019s (1989) translation) in the\nfollowing words: \u201cAn essential aspect of [the] arrangement of\nthings in physics is that they lay claim, at a certain time, to an\nexistence independent of one another, provided these objects\n\u2018are situated in different parts of space\u2019\u201d (the\ncontext of the quote suggests that Einstein intended his principle to\napply to objects provided they\u00a0occupy spacelike separated regions\nof spacetime).\n\nAs Healey (1991, p. 411) shows, spatiotemporal separability entails\nspatial separability, and so spatial nonseparability entails\nspatiotemporal nonseparability. Because it is both more general and\nmore consonant with a geometric spacetime viewpoint, it seems\nreasonable to consider spatiotemporal separability to be the primary\nnotion. Accordingly, separability without further qualification will\nmean spatiotemporal separability in what follows, and nonseparability\nwill be understood as its denial.\n\nNonseparability:\n Some physical process occupying a region R of\nspacetime is not supervenient upon an assignment of qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in R.\n\n\nIt is important to note that nonseparability entails neither\n physical property holism\n nor\n spatial nonseparability:\n a process may be nonseparable even though it involves objects without\nproper parts. But this section has explained that either of the latter\nprinciples entails nonseparability under quite weak assumptions.\n7. Holism and Nonseparability in Classical Physics\n\nClassical physics presents no definitive examples of either\n physical property holism\n or\n nonseparability.\n As section 6 explained, almost any instance of physical property\nholism would demonstrate nonseparability. This justifies restricting\nattention to the latter notion. Now the assumption that all physical\nprocesses are completely described by a local assignment of magnitudes\nforms part of the metaphysical background to classical physics. In\nNewtonian spacetime, the kinematical behavior of a system of point\nparticles under the action of finite forces is supervenient upon\nascriptions of particular values of position and momentum to the\nparticles along their trajectories. This supervenience on local\nmagnitudes extends also to dynamics if the forces on the particles\narise from fields defined at each spacetime point.\n\nThe boiling of a kettle of water is an example of a more complex\nphysical process. It consists in the increased kinetic energy of its\nconstituent molecules permitting each to overcome the short range\nattractive forces which otherwise hold it in the liquid. It thus\nsupervenes on the assignment, at each spacetime point on the\ntrajectory of each molecule, of physical magnitudes to that molecule\n(such as its kinetic energy), as well as to the fields that give rise\nto the attractive force acting on the molecule at that point.\n\nAs an example of a process in Minkowski spacetime (the spacetime\nframework for Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity), consider\nthe propagation of an electromagnetic wave through empty space. This\nis supervenient upon an ascription of the electromagnetic field tensor\nat each point in the spacetime.\n\nBut it does not follow that classical processes like these are\nseparable. For one may question whether an assignment of basic\nmagnitudes at spacetime points amounts to or results from an\nassignment of qualitative intrinsic properties at those points. Take\ninstantaneous velocity, for example: this is usually defined as the\nlimit of average velocities over successively smaller temporal\nneighborhoods of that point. This provides a reason to deny that the\ninstantaneous velocity of a particle at a point supervenes on\nqualitative intrinsic properties assigned at that point. Similar\nskeptical doubts can be raised about the intrinsic character of other\n\u201clocal\u201d magnitudes such as the density of a fluid, the\nvalue of an electromagnetic field, or the metric and curvature of\nspacetime (see Butterfield (2006)).\n\nOne response to such doubts is to admit to a minor consequent\nviolation of separability while introducing a weaker notion,\nnamely\n\nWeak Separability: Any physical process occupying spacetime\nregion R supervenes upon an assignment of\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties at points of R\nand/or in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those\npoints.\n\n\nAlong with a correspondingly strengthened notion of\n\nStrong Nonseparability: Some physical process occupying a\nregion R of spacetime is not supervenient upon an\nassignment of qualitative intrinsic physical properties at points of\nR and/or in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of\nthose points.\n\n\nNo holism need be involved in a process that is nonseparable, but not\nstrongly so, as long as the basic parts of the objects involved in it\nare themselves taken to be associated with arbitrarily small\nneighborhoods rather than points. Versions of Weak\nSeparability are offered by both Belot (1998, p. 540), whose term\nis Synchronic Locality, and by Myrvold (2011, p. 425), who calls it\nPatchy Separability. The idea is that the state of a region supervenes\non assignments of intrinsic properties to patches of the region, where\nthe patches may be taken to be arbitrarily small.\n\nAny physical process fully described by a local spacetime theory will\nbe at least weakly separable. For such a theory proceeds by assigning\ngeometric objects (such as vectors or tensors) at each point in\nspacetime to represent physical fields, and then requiring that these\nsatisfy certain field equations. But processes fully described by\ntheories of other forms will also be separable. These include many\ntheories which assign magnitudes to particles at each point on their\ntrajectories. Of familiar classical theories, it is only theories\ninvolving direct action between spatially separated particles which\ninvolve nonseparability in their description of the dynamical\nhistories of individual particles. But such processes are weakly\nseparable within spacetime regions that are large enough to include\nall sources of forces acting on these particles, so that the\nappearance of strong nonseparability may be attributed to a mistakenly\nnarrow understanding of the spacetime region these processes actually\noccupy.\n\nThe propagation of gravitational energy according to general\nrelativity apparently involves strongly nonseparable processes, since\ngravitational energy cannot be localized (it does not contribute to\nthe stress-energy tensor defined at each point of spacetime as do\nother forms of energy). But even a non-locally-defined gravitational\nenergy will still be supervenient upon the metric tensor defined at\neach point of the spacetime, and so the process of its propagation\nwill be weakly separable.\n\nThe definition of nonseparability becomes problematic in general\nrelativity, since its application requires that one identify the same\nregion R in possible spacetimes with different\ngeometries. But while there is no generally applicable algorithm for\nmaking a uniquely appropriate identification, some identification may\nappear salient in a particular case. For example, one can meaningfully\ndiscuss whether or not the field is the same everywhere in the region\noutside the solenoid in the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect\n with an increased current flowing, even though the size of the\ncurrent will have a (tiny) influence on the geometry of that region.\nNote that the definition of nonseparability does not require that one\nidentify the same point in spacetimes of distinct geometries.\n\nWhile strictly outside the domain of classical physics, quantum\nphenomena such as the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect\n may be considered manifestations of nonseparability and holism even\nin classical electromagnetism. Nonseparability would be a\ntrivial notion if no qualitative intrinsic physical properties were\never assigned at spacetime points or in their neighborhoods. But this\nwould require a thorough-going relationism that took not just\ngeometric but all local features to be irreducibly relational (cf.\nEsfeld (2004)). We will return to this point in our discussion of the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n8. The Quantum Physics of Entangled Systems\n\nQuantum entanglement is in the first instance a relation between not\nphysical but mathematical objects representing the states of quantum\nsystems. Different forms of quantum theory represent quantum states of\nvarious systems by different kinds of mathematical object. So the\nconcept of quantum entanglement has been expressed by a family of\ndefinitions, each appropriate to a specific form and application of\nquantum theory (see Earman (2015)). The first definition\n(Schr\u00f6dinger (1935)) was developed in the context of applications\nof ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to pairs of\ndistinguishable particles that have interacted, such as an electron\nand proton.\n\nA hydrogen atom may be represented in ordinary non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics as a quantum system composed of two subsystems: an\nelectron e and a nuclear proton p.\nWhen isolated, its quantum state may be represented\nby a vector \\(\\Psi\\) in a space H constructed as a\ntensor product of spaces \\(H_{p}\\) and \\(H_{e}\\) used to represent\nstates of \\(e, p\\) respectively. The states of \\(e, p\\) are then\ndefined as entangled if and only if\n \n \n\n\\[ \\Psi \\ne \\Psi_{p} \\otimes \\Psi_{e}\\]\n\n\nfor every pair of vectors \\(\\Psi_{p}, \\Psi_{e}\\) in\n\\(H_{p}\\), \\(H_{e}\\) respectively. This definition naturally\ngeneralizes to systems composed of n\ndistinguishable particles. But alternative definitions seem preferable\nfor a collection of indistinguishable particles\u2014of electrons or\nof photons for example (see Ghirardi et al. (2002), Ladyman\net al. (2013)).\n\nIt follows that the states of electron and proton in an isolated\nhydrogen atom are entangled. But one may also represent the hydrogen\natom as composed of a center-of-mass subsystem C\nand a relative subsystem R represented by vector\nstates \\(\\Psi_{C}\\), \\(\\Psi_{R}\\) in \\(H_{C}, H_{R}\\) respectively\nsuch that\n \n \n\n\\[ \\Psi = \\Psi_{C} \\otimes \\Psi_{R}\\]\n\n\nIf the state of the hydrogen atom is represented by \\(\\Psi\\) then the\nstates of quantum subsystems \\(C, R\\) are not entangled but the states\nof quantum subsystems \\(p, e\\) are entangled. This illustrates the\nimportant point that one cannot draw metaphysical conclusions from a\nmathematical condition of quantum entanglement without first deciding\nwhich quantum systems are physical parts composing some physical\nwhole. It may seem natural to take the physical parts of a hydrogen\natom to be an electron and a proton. But note that the state of an\nisolated hydrogen atom is usually represented by \\(\\Psi_{R}\\), and not\nby \\(\\Psi\\) or \\(\\Psi_{e}\\).\n\nViewed as basic physical parts of a hydrogen atom represented by state\n\\(\\Psi\\), its electron and proton may be considered entangled physical\nparts since \\(\\Psi\\) cannot be expressed as a product of vectors\nrepresenting the state of each. The electron and the proton may each\nbe assigned a mixed state, but these do not uniquely determine the\nstate \\(\\Psi\\): state separability is violated. This may occasion no\nsurprise if a system\u2019s state merely specifies its chances of\nexhibiting various possible properties on measurement. But it may have\nmetaphysical significance if a system\u2019s quantum state plays a\nrole in specifying its categorical properties\u2014its real state, so\nthat the\n real state separability principle\n is threatened. His commitment to this principle is one reason why\nEinstein denied that a physical system\u2019s real state is given by\nits quantum state (though it\u2019s not clear what he thought its\nreal state consisted in). But according to (one variant of) the rival\nCopenhagen interpretation, the quantum state gives a physical\nsystem\u2019s real dynamical state by specifying that it contains\njust those qualitative intrinsic quantum dynamical properties to which\nit assigns probability 1. On this last interpretation, violation of\nstate separability in quantum mechanics leads to\n physical property holism:\n it implies, for example, that a pair of fundamental particles may\nhave the intrinsic property of being spinless even though this is not\ndetermined by the intrinsic properties and relations of its component\nparticles.\n\nIf an entangled pure vector state of a pair of quantum systems\nviolates state separability then there are measurements of dynamical\nvariables (one on each subsystem) whose joint quantum probability\ndistribution cannot be expressed as a product of probability\ndistributions for separate measurements of each variable. Quantum\ntheory predicts such a probability distribution for each of many types\nof spatially separated measurements of variables including spin and\npolarization components on a pair of entangled physical entities\nassigned such a state, and many of these distributions have been\nexperimentally verified. If one thought that quantum theory treats\neach dynamical variable by replacing a precise real value assignment\nby a probability distribution for the results of measurements of that\ndynamical variable, one might take this already to violate the real\nstate separability principle. But if one entertains a theory that\nsupplements the quantum state by values of additional\n\u201chidden\u201d variables, then the quantum probabilities would\nbe taken to arise from averaging over many distinct hidden states. In\nthat case, it would rather be the probability distribution conditional\non a complete specification of the values of the hidden variables that\nshould be taken to specify the underlying chances of system and\nsubsystems exhibiting various possible properties on measurement. The\nreal state might then include all these conditional probability\ndistributions. The best known example of such a theory is the Bohm\ntheory (see the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics),\n where the \u201chidden\u201d variables are spatial positions. In\neach specific experimental context all conditional probabilities are 0\nor 1, so the joint conditional probability distributions indeed\nfactorize. But the outcome of a measurement of a chosen dynamical\nvariable on one subsystem depends on what dynamical variable is chosen\nand measured on the other, no matter just when or how far apart these\nmeasurements are selected and made.\n\nBell (1964, [2004]) reasoned that any local hidden variable\ntheory must yield conditional probabilities of 0 or 1 for each local\noutcome in order to reproduce all quantum predictions but could not\npermit these to depend on the choice of distant measurement. He then\nproved that the probabilistic predictions of any local hidden variable\ntheory must satisfy particular inequalities violated by predictions of\nquantum theory for certain entangled state assignments (see entry\n Bell\u2019s Theorem).\n In later work Bell (1990, [2004]) generalized this argument to apply\nto any theory of a certain type meeting a condition he called Local\nCausality which, he claimed, quantum mechanics does not meet. Howard\n(1989, 1992) took outcome independence \u2014 the probabilistic\nindependence of the outcomes of a given pair of measurements, one on\neach of a pair of entangled systems, conditional on definite values\nfor any assumed hidden variables on the joint system\u2014as a\nseparability condition. Outcome independence may be contrasted with\nparameter independence\u2014the condition that, given a definite\nhidden variable assignment, the outcome of a measurement on one of a\npair of entangled systems is probabilistically independent of what\nmeasurement, if any, is made on the other system. Together with\nparameter independence, outcome independence implies the factorization\nof conditional probabilities that leads to what are now called Bell\ninequalities. These inequalities constrain the patterns of statistical\ncorrelations to be expected between the results of measurements of\nvariables such as spin and polarization on a pair of entangled systems\nin any quantum state. Quantum mechanics predicts, and experiment\nconfirms, that such Bell inequalities do not always hold. The Bohm\ntheory accommodates this fact by its violation of parameter\ndependence, and hence Local Causality. But Howard (1989), as well as\nTeller (1989), suggested that we appeal instead to a failure of\noutcome independence to understand why Bell inequalities do not always\nhold, and that this failure is associated rather with holism or\nnonseparability. Howard (1989) blamed the violation of Bell\ninequalities on the violation of his separability condition: Teller\n(1989) took it to be a manifestation of\n relational holism.\n They both acquit parameter independence of blame because they believe\nthat (at least when the measurement events on the entangled systems\nare spacelike separated) parameter independence (unlike outcome\nindependence) is a consequence of relativity theory: (note that the\nBohm theory requires a preferred frame not provided by relativity\ntheory).\n\nHenson (2013) and others have questioned this line of reasoning,\nincluding the conclusion that its appeal to holism or nonseparability\nhelps one to understand how these correlations involving entangled\nsystems come about without any action at a distance that violates\nrelativity theory, Local Causality or Einstein\u2019s (1948)\n\nPrinciple of Local Action:\n If A and B are spatially\ndistant things, then an external influence on A has\nno immediate effect on B.\n\n\nHoward\u2019s (1989,1992) identification of outcome independence with\na separability condition has proved controversial, as has\nTeller\u2019s (1989) claim that violations of Bell inequalities are\nno longer puzzling if one embraces (physical) relational holism\n(Laudisa 1995; Berkowitz 1998; Henson 2013). Winsberg and Fine (2003)\nobject that separability requires only that the conditional joint\nprobabilities be determined as some function of the marginal\nprobabilities, whereas outcome independence arbitrarily restricts this\nto be the product function. By allowing other kinds of functional\ndependence they are able to construct models of experiments whose\nresults would exhibit violations of Bell inequalities. They claim that\nthese models are both local and separable even though they violate\noutcome independence. But Fogel (2007) presents alternative\nformalizations of the separability condition, of which several indeed\nimply outcome independence. The view that violations of outcome\nindependence are consistent with relativity theory, while violations\nof parameter independence are not, has also been criticized (Jones\n& Clifton 1993; Maudlin 2011). But Myrvold (2016) has responded by\narguing that locally-initiated state-vector collapse in violation of\noutcome dependence may be perfectly compatible with relativity.\n\nWhile diverging from the Copenhagen prescription mentioned above, some\n modal interpretations\n take real states of systems to be closely enough related to quantum\nstates that entangled systems\u2019 violation of quantum state\nseparability implies some kind of holism or nonseparability. Van\nFraassen (1991, p. 294), for example, sees his modal interpretation as\ncommitted to \u201ca strange holism\u201d because it entails that a\ncompound system may fail to have a property corresponding to a tensor\nproduct projection operator \\(P\\otimes I\\) even though its first\ncomponent has a property corresponding to P. In\nfact, a clearer case of holism would arise in a modal interpretation\nthat implied that the component lacked P while the\ncompound had \\(P\\otimes I\\): ceteris paribus, that would\nprovide an instance of physical property holism. Healey (1989,1994)\noffered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model account\nof the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting from the\noperation of a process that violates both\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal separability.\n He argued that, on this interpretation, the\n nonseparability\n of the process is a consequence of\n physical property holism;\n and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how\nthe correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory\nor\n Local Action.\n But subsequent work by Clifton and Dickson (1998) and Myrvold (2001)\ncast doubt on whether the account can be squared with relativity\ntheory\u2019s requirement of Lorentz invariance. More recently Healey\n(2016) has given a different account of how quantum theory may be used\nto explain violations of Bell inequalities consistent with Lorentz\ninvariance and Local Action. This account involves no metaphysical\nholism or nonseparability.\n\nEsfeld (2001) takes holism, in the quantum domain and elsewhere, to\ninvolve more than just a failure of supervenience. He maintains that a\ncompound system is holistic in that its subsystems themselves count as\nquantum systems only by virtue of their relations to other subsystems\ntogether with which they compose the whole.\n9. Ontological Holism in Quantum Mechanics?\n\nAs applied to physics,\n ontological holism\n is the thesis that there are physical objects that are not wholly\ncomposed of basic physical parts. Views of Bohr, Bohm and others may\nbe interpreted as endorsing some version of this thesis. In no case is\nit claimed that any physical object has nonphysical parts.\nThe idea is rather that some physical entities that we take to be\nwholly composed of a particular set of basic physical parts are in\nfact not so composed.\n\nIt was Bohr\u2019s (1934) view that one can meaningfully ascribe\nproperties such as position or momentum to a quantum system only in\nthe context of some well-defined experimental arrangement suitable for\nmeasuring the corresponding property. He used the expression\n\u2018quantum phenomenon\u2019 to describe what happens in such an\narrangement. In his view, then, although a quantum phenomenon is\npurely physical, it is not composed of distinct happenings involving\nindependently characterizable physical objects\u2014the quantum\nsystem on the one hand, and the classical apparatus on the other. And\neven if the quantum system may be taken to exist outside the context\nof a quantum phenomenon, little or nothing can then be meaningfully\nsaid about its properties. It would therefore be a mistake to consider\na quantum object to be an independently existing component part of the\napparatus-object whole.\n\nBohm\u2019s (1980, 1993) reflections on quantum mechanics led him to\nadopt a more general holism. He believed that not just quantum object\nand apparatus, but any collection of quantum objects by themselves,\nconstitute an indivisible whole. This may be made precise in the\ncontext of Bohm\u2019s (1952) interpretation of quantum mechanics by\nnoting that a complete specification of the state of the\n\u201cundivided universe\u201d requires not only a listing of all\nits constituent particles and their positions, but also of a field\nassociated with the wave-function that guides their trajectories. If\none assumes that the basic physical parts of the universe are just the\nparticles it contains, then this establishes ontological holism in the\ncontext of Bohm\u2019s interpretation. But there are alternative\nviews of the ontology of the Bohm theory (see the entry\n Bohmian mechanics).\n\nSome (Howard 1989; Dickson 1998) have connected the failure of a\nprinciple of separability to ontological holism in the context of\nviolations of Bell inequalities. Howard (1989) formulates the\nfollowing separability principle (pp. 225\u20136)\n\nHoward Separability:\n The contents of any two regions of space-time separated by a\nnonvanishing spatiotemporal interval constitute separable physical\nsystems, in the sense that (1) each possesses its own, distinct\nphysical state, and (2) the joint state of the two systems is wholly\ndetermined by these separate states.\n\n\nHe takes Einstein to defend this as a principle of individuation of\nphysical systems, without which physical thought \u201cin the sense\nfamiliar to us\u201d would not be possible. Howard himself\ncontemplates the possible failure of this principle for\n entangled quantum systems,\n with the consequence that these could no longer be taken to be wholly\ncomposed of what are typically regarded as their subsystems. Dickson\n(1998), on the other hand, argues that such holism is not \u201ca\ntenable scientific doctrine, much less an explanatory one\u201d (p.\n156).\n\nOne may try to avoid the conclusion that experimental violations of\nBell inequalities manifest a failure of\n Local Action\n by invoking ontological holism for events. The idea would be to deny\nthat these experiments involve distinct, spatiotemporally separate,\nmeasurement events, and to maintain instead that what we usually\ndescribe as separate measurements involving an entangled system in\nfact constitute one indivisible, spatiotemporally disconnected, event\nwith no spatiotemporal parts. But such ontological holism conflicts\nwith the criteria of individuation of events inherent in both quantum\ntheory and experimental practice.\n10. The Aharonov-Bohm Effect and Field Holonomies\n\nAharonov and Bohm (1959) drew attention to the quantum mechanical\nprediction that an interference pattern due to a beam of charged\nparticles could be produced or altered by the presence of a constant\nmagnetic field in a region from which the particles were excluded.\nThis effect has since been experimentally demonstrated. At first\nsight, the Aharonov-Bohm effect seems to involve action at a distance.\nIt seems clear that the (electro-)magnetic field acts on the particles\nsince it affects the interference pattern they produce; and this must\nbe action at a distance since the particles pass through a region from\nwhich that field is absent. But alternative accounts of the phenomenon\nare possible which portray it rather as a manifestation of (strong)\n nonseparability\n (Healey 1997). There need be no action at a distance if the behavior\nboth of the charged particles and of electromagnetism are nonseparable\nprocesses. While such a treatment of electromagnetism (and other gauge\ntheories) is increasingly common in physics, to treat the motion of\nthe charged particles as a nonseparable process is to endorse a\nparticular position on how quantum mechanics is to be interpreted.\n\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics that ascribes a nonlocalized\nposition to a charged particle on its way through the apparatus is\ncommitted to a violation of\n spatiotemporal separability\n in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, since the particle\u2019s passage\nconstitutes a nonseparable process. To see why the electromagnetism\nthat acts on the particles during their passage may also be taken to\nbe nonseparable it is necessary to consider contemporary\nrepresentations of electromagnetism in terms of neither fields nor\nvector potentials.\n\nFollowing Wu and Yang\u2019s (1975) analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect, it has become common to consider vacuum electromagnetism to be\ncompletely and nonredundantly described neither by the electromagnetic\nfield, nor by its vector potential, but rather by the so-called Dirac\nphase factor: \n\n\\[ \\exp[(ie/\\hbar) \\oint_C A_{\\mu}(x^{\\mu}.dx^{\\mu}] \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A_{\\mu}\\) is the electromagnetic potential at spacetime point\n\\(x^{\\mu}\\), e is the particles\u2019 charge, and\nthe integral is taken over each closed loop C in\nspacetime. This can be seen as an instance of the more general notion\nof the holonomy of a closed curve, a notion that has come to the fore\nin contemporary formulations of gauge theories including\nelectromagnetism in terms of fiber bundles (Healey (2007)). Applied to\nthe Aharonov-Bohm case, this means that the constant magnetic field is\naccompanied by an association of a phase factor \\(S(C)\\) with all\nclosed curves C in space, where \\(S(C)\\) is defined\nby \n\n\\[ S(C) = \\exp[-(ie/\\hbar) \\oint_C \\mathbf{A(r).}d\\mathbf{r}] \\]\n\n\n(where \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the magnetic vector potential at\npoint \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) of space). This approach has the advantage that\nsince \\(S(C)\\) is gauge-invariant, it may readily be considered a\nphysically real quantity. Moreover, the effects of electromagnetism in\nthe field-free region may be attributed to the fact that \\(S(C)\\) is\nnonvanishing for certain closed curves C within\nthat region. But it is significant that, unlike the magnetic field and\nits potential, \\(S(C)\\) is not defined at each point of space at each\nmoment of time.\n\nCan \\(S(C)\\) at some time be taken to represent an intrinsic property\nof a region of space corresponding to the curve C?\nThere are two difficulties with this suggestion. The first is that the\npresence of the quantity e in the definition of\n\\(S(C)\\) appears to indicate that \\(S(C)\\) rather codes the effect of\nelectromagnetism on objects with that specific charge. If in fact\nall charges are multiples of some minimal value e,\nthen this would no longer be a problem: the value of\n\\(S(C)\\) for this minimal charge could then be viewed as representing\nan intrinsic property of a region of space corresponding to the curve\nC. If not, one could rather take \n\n\\[ I(C) = \\oint_C \\mathbf{A(r).}d\\mathbf{r} \\]\n\n\nto represent an intrinsic property of C. The second\ndifficulty is that closed curves do not correspond uniquely to regions\nof space: e.g., circling the region in which there is a magnetic field\ntwice on the same circle will produce a different curve from circling\nit once. But this does not prevent one from taking \\(S(C)\\) at some\ntime to represent an intrinsic property of a loop\u2014the oriented\nregion of space traced out by a closed curve C that\nintersects itself only at its end-point.\n\nOnce these difficulties have been handled, it is indeed possible to\nconsider electromagnetism in the Aharonov-Bohm effect as faithfully\nrepresented at a time by a set of intrinsic properties of loops in\nspace (or more generally space-time). But if one does so, then\nelectromagnetism itself manifests (strong)\n nonseparability.\n For these intrinsic properties do not supervene on any assignment of\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in the\nregion concerned, nor even in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those\npoints. Whether the magnetic field remains constant or changes, the\nassociated electromagnetism constitutes a nonseparable process, and so\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect violates\n spatiotemporal separability.\n If the motion of the particles through the apparatus is a\nnonseparable process, then it is possible to account for the \\(AB\\)\neffect in terms of a purely local interaction between electromagnetism\nand this process. For the particles effectively traverse loops traced\nout by closed curves C on their nonlocalized\n\u201ctrajectories\u201d, and so they interact with electromagnetism\nprecisely where this is defined.\n\nAssuming it exhibits nonseparability, does the Aharonov-Bohm effect\ninvolve some kind of holism? The states of the particles need not be\nentangled with each other. But the state of the field may be thought\nto be holistic, in so far as the electromagnetic properties of loops\ndo not supervene on properties (such as electric and magnetic field\nstrengths) at the points that make up those loops. Since these are\nclassical fields, the Aharonov-Bohm effect may be taken to demonstrate\nholism as well as nonseparability even in classical physics.\nHowever, a loop may also be thought of as traced out by a curve\ncomposed by \u201cstringing together\u201d a set of curves that\ntrace out smaller loops, and removing segments traversed by two such\ncurves in opposite directions. In that case, in a simply-connected\nregion, the holonomy properties of any loop will be determined by\nthose of an arbitrary set of smaller loops that compose it in this\nway. But when spacetime is not simply connected, there are loops that\ncannot be decomposed in this way: e.g. the loop that encompasses\n\u201cthe hole\u201d in space cannot be further decomposed.\n\nMyrvold (2011) interprets this result as saying that Weak Separability\n(what he calls Global Patchy Separability) fails for non-simply\nconnected spacetimes, even though locally\u2014over simply-connected\npatches\u2014separability holds. Moreover, he here sees a marked\ndistinction between the holonomy and the field formalism for gauge\ntheories: in which supposedly separability always holds.\n\nBut Gomes (2021) effaces this distinction: he argues that a field\nformalism maintains separability, but only at the cost of dealing with\ngauge variant field variables. Once we restrict attention to\nthe gauge-invariant quantities, the nonseparability\nillustrated above (using the holonomy variables) is restored.\nMoreover, he argues that only in a vacuum is nonseparability\nconditional on the topology of spacetime. In the presence of charged\nmatter, there may be gauge-invariant quantities that cannot be\ndecomposed into smaller patches, even for simply-connected regions.\nAnd this is easy to illustrate: suppose that, instead of the phase\nfactor \\(S(C)\\), for a closed loop C, we write \\(S(I)\\) for an open\nsegment I, that begins at point x and ends\nat point y. For a (Klein-Gordon) charged scalar\nfield \\(\\varphi\\) that vanishes everywhere except at small\nneighborhoods \\(\\nu_x, \\nu_y\\), of x and y,\nthe function:\n\n\\[\n \\bar\\varphi(x)S(I)\\varphi(y)\n\\]\n\n\nis gauge-invariant, and it cannot be further decomposed into\nquantities with support on patches that do not include the entirety of\n\\(I. \\)For instance, if there are two patches, each containing either\n\\(\\nu_x\\) or \\(\\nu_y\\), then that patch has insufficient charges to\ncomplete \\(S(I)\\) into a gauge-invariant function. This example is in\nline with the physics literature, which largely takes gauge-invariance\n(and in particular the existence of a generalized Gauss constraint),\nto signal some general type of nonlocality (cf. Strocchi (2013, Ch.\n7)).\n11. Alternative Approaches\n\nThis entry has focused mainly on\n metaphysical holism\n and its relation to nonseparability. That there is a variety of\nalternative ways of understanding holism in physics is illustrated by\na special issue of the journal Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Physics (2004) devoted to this topic.\n\nSeevinck (2004) proposes an epistemological criterion of holism and\nillustrates its application to physical theories. A physical theory\ncounts as holistic by this criterion if and only if it is impossible\nin principle to infer the global properties, as assigned in the\ntheory, by local resources available to an agent, where these include\n(at least) all local operations and classical communication. To apply\nthis criterion it is necessary to specify how a theory assigns\nproperties, a matter on which different interpretations of the theory\nmay disagree. Seevinck (2004) argues that neither classical physics\nnor Bohmian mechanics is holistic in this sense. Applying the\neigenvalue-eigenstate link to a particular state of a bipartite\nquantum system he then shows that this manifests epistemological\nholism, even when the state of the system is not\n entangled.\n\nPlacek (2004) understands quantum state holism as involving a thesis\nabout probabilities: that the probability of a joint result of a\ncombined measurement on a pair of entangled quantum systems is not\ndetermined by the probabilities of the two results. But he takes this\nto be only one ingredient of a more complete conception, whose\nformulation and analysis requires a modal framework combining\nindeterminism, (rudiments of) relativistic space-time, and\nprobability\u2014Belnap\u2019s (1992) theory of branching\nspace-times.\n\nEsfeld (2004) argues for a metaphysics of relations based on a\ncharacterization of quantum entanglement in terms of non-separability,\nthereby regarding entanglement as a sort of holism. He there\ncharacterizes non-separability as follows:\n\nNon-separability: The states of two or more systems are\nnon-separable if and only if it is only the joint state of the whole\nthat completely determines the state-dependent properties of each\nsystem and the correlations among these systems (to the extent that\nthese are determined at all).\n\n\nHe takes this to imply that any case of quantum entanglement is a case\nof non-separability, and non-separability is the reason why quantum\nentanglement is a sort of holism. (He discusses the relation between\nnon-separability and holism in chapter 8 of Esfeld (2001).)\n\nLyre (2004) and Healey (2004) see electromagnetism and other gauge\ntheories as manifesting nonseparability for reasons different from\nthose arising from quantum entanglement (cf.\n The Aharonov-Bohm Effect).\n Lyre takes this to be a variant of spatiotemporal holism, and\nconnects it to structural realism. Healey (2007) argues that general\nrelativity does not manifest this kind of nonseparability even though\nit may be formulated as a gauge theory. Weatherall (2016) argues that\na distinction exists, but it is not enough to rule out spatiotemporal\nholism in general relativity. If there are more than one spatial\ndimensions, an analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in general\nrelativity (using the directions of parallel-propagated vectors)\ntheoretically exhibits a similar type of nonseparability as that\nobserved in gauge theory.\n12. Quantum Field Theory\n\nCertain phenomena that arise within quantum field theory have been\ntaken to challenge principles of separability or to involve holism.\nThese have been analyzed most intensively by mathematical physicists\nand philosophers taking an algebraic approach to quantum theory, even\nthough many empirical successes of quantum field theory have been\nachieved by following other approaches.\n\nAlgebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) represents the state in a region\nof spacetime by means of a function from an algebra of associated\n\u201cfield\u201d or \u201cobservable\u201d operators: the value\nof this function for a self-adjoint operator represents the expected\nresult of a measurement of the corresponding observable on that\nregion. A state is said to be decomposable (some say separable) across\nalgebras \\(R_{A}, R_{B}\\) associated with regions \\(A, B\\) if its\nrestriction \\(\\omega\\) to the algebra \\(R_{AB}\\) generated by \\(R_{A},\nR_{B}\\) is a product state\u2014i.e. satisfies\n\\(\\omega(XY)=\\omega(X)\\omega(Y)\\), for all \\(X\\in R_{A}, Y\\in R_{B}\\);\nor if \\(\\omega\\) is a limit of convex combinations of product states:\notherwise, it is said to be entangled across \\(R_{AB}\\) (see e.g.\nValente 2010, pp. 1031\u20132). This is a natural reformulation of a\ngeneralization to mixed states of the first condition for entanglement\ngiven in\n section 8.\n\nEntanglement is endemic in AQFT. Summers and Werner (1985) proved that\nthe vacuum state of a quantum field is not only entangled across\nalgebras associated with certain spacelike separated regions of\nMinkowski spacetime, but that it also maximally violates Bell\ninequalities for algebras associated with these regions. They also\nproved (1988) that every state on a pair of space-like\nseparated open regions whose closures share a single point is\nmaximally entangled across their algebras. For each state, the degree\nof entanglement decreases rapidly with spatial separation. But if and\nonly if \\(R_{A}, R_{B}\\) possess what is called the split\nproperty is any state decomposable across these algebras.\n\nThe split property (Valente 2010, p. 1035) is a strengthening of the\ncondition of microcausality (observables on space-like separated\nregions commute). Summers (2009) argues that it is meaningful to speak\nof independent subsystems in relativistic quantum theory if they can\nbe localized in spacetime regions \\(A, B\\) whose algebras \\(R_{A},\nR_{B}\\) posses the split property; and that most, if not all,\nphysically relevant models of quantum field theories have this\nproperty (for sufficiently space-like separated regions \\(A, B)\\).\n\nThe split property is a kind of independence condition. R\u00e9dei\n(2010) argues that, by conforming to this and other independence\nconditions, an AQFT can meet all the requirements Einstein (1948)\nconsidered necessary for a quantum theory satisfactorily to realize\nthe field-theoretic ideal. These were the requirement that physical\nthings be arranged in a space-time continuum (Spatiotemporality); that\nthings located in space-like separated regions have their own distinct\nstates (Independence); and that if \\(a, b\\) are located in space-like\nseparated regions \\(A, B\\) respectively, then an external influence on\na has no immediate effect on b\n(Local Action).\n (The first two names are R\u00e9dei\u2019s: the last is\nEinstein\u2019s.) R\u00e9dei takes AQFT to satisfy\nSpatiotemporality because of its basic assumption that observables are\nlocalized in space-time regions; that an AQFT\u2019s satisfaction of\nthe split property and other members of a hierarchy of independence\nconditions establishes Independence; and that an AQFT obeys Local\nAction insofar as it meets a condition he calls operational\nseparability.\n\nIn evaluating R\u00e9dei\u2019s argument it is important to ask\nwhat counts as a physical thing. Einstein mentioned two possible\ncandidates: bodies and fields.\n Howard\u2019s separability principle\n permits a natural transposition of Einstein\u2019s\n real state separability principle\n to field theory. Entangled states in AQFT violate section 5\u2019s\n state separability\n principle just as they do in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics even\nthough the split property and related independence conditions on their\nalgebras hold. So if the content of a space-time region were specified\nby its algebra in AQFT, considered as a physical system with real\nphysical state given by a state on that algebra, then Howard\u2019s\nseparability principle would fail. (Although the failure of the split\nproperty or other algebraic independence conditions for certain\nregions in a quantum field theory would represent a more radical\nthreat to the separate existence of such physical systems in those\nregions than mere entanglement). But it is doubtful that Einstein\nwould have counted observables or their algebras as physical things.\nIf instead these are taken to represent magnitudes of physical fields\nor the spatio-temporal region on which they are defined then meeting\nR\u00e9dei\u2019s Independence requirement is still consistent with\nfailure of Howard\u2019s (stronger) separability principle. Finally\nmeeting R\u00e9dei\u2019s operational separability condition only\nfor non-selective operations would not suffice to ensure\nconformity to Local Action. Einstein\u2019s reasons for rejecting the\ncompleteness of quantum mechanical description are naturally extended\nto AQFT: if a state on its local algebra completely specifies the real\nstate of a space-time region then either the natural extension of his\n real state separability principle\n or his principle of\n Local Action\n fails.\n\nMetaphysical holism\n presupposes a division of a whole into parts. To apply the part/whole\ndistinction here one must address the ontology of quantum field\ntheory. Taking spacetime regions to be the relevant physical objects,\none could understand the system/subsystem and part/whole relations in\nterms of spatiotemporal inclusion. To assess\n physical property holism\n or\n nonseparability\n we need to determine the qualitative intrinsic properties and\nrelations pertaining to spacetime regions in quantum field theory.\n\nArageorgis (2013) gives an example of quantum field states entangled\nacross two regions which nevertheless, he argues, fail to exhibit the\nsame kind of\n state nonseparability\n as singlet and triplet spin states of a pair of quantum particles\n(see Maudlin 1998). But he suggests that his example does exhibit a\nkind of epistemological state nonseparability, in so far as an agent\nconfined to a single region cannot determine its state by operations\nconfined to that region. By applying the eigenvalue-eigenstate link to\nhis example, Arageorgis (2013) argues that the energy of a particular\ncompound quantum field system is not determined by the energies (or\nany other qualitative intrinsic properties and relations) of its\ncomponent subsystems. He concludes that this example manifests\nphysical property holism.\n\nWayne (2002) has suggested that quantum field theory is best\ninterpreted as postulating extensive holism or nonseparability. On\nthis interpretation, the fundamental quantities in quantum field\ntheory are vacuum expectation values of products of field operators\ndefined at various spacetime points. The field can be reconstructed\nout of all of these. Nonseparability supposedly arises because the\nvacuum expectation value of a product of field operators defined at an\nn-tuple of distinct spacetime points does not\nsupervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties defined at\nthose n points, together with the spatiotemporal\nrelations among the points. But it is not clear that vacuum\nexpectation values of products of field operators defined at n-tuples\nof distinct spacetime points represent either\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties of these n-tuples\nor physical relations between them. Improved\nassessment of the extent to which quantum field theory illustrates\n holism\n or\n nonseparability\n must await further progress in the interpretation of quantum field\ntheory. (Kuhlman, Lyre and Wayne (2002) represents a relevant first\nstep: but see also Fraser (2008), Baker (2009).)\n13. String Theory\n\nString theory (or its descendant, M-theory) has\nemerged as a speculative candidate for unifying much of fundamental\nphysics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity. Existing\nstring theories proceed by quantizing classical theories of basic\nentities that are extended in one or more dimensions of a space that\nhas 6 or 7 tiny compact dimensions in addition to the three spatial\ndimensions of ordinary geometry. If these additional dimensions are\nappropriately considered spatial, then it is natural to extend the\nconcepts of\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal\n separability to encompass them. In that case, processes involving\nclassical strings (or p-branes with \\(p \\gt 0\\))\nwould count as (spatiotemporally) nonseparable, even though all\nparticles and their properties conform to spatial separability.\n\nThe status of\n nonseparability\n within a quantized string field theory is not so easy to assess,\nbecause of the general problems associated with deciding what the\nontology of any relativistic quantum field theory should be taken to\nbe.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aharonov, Y. and Bohm, D., 1959, \u201cSignificance of\nElectromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory\u201d, <em>Physical\nReview</em>, 115: 485\u201391.", "Arageorgis, A., 2013, \u201cHolism and Nonseparability by\nAnalogy\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern\nPhysics</em>, 44: 206\u2013214.", "Baker, D., 2009, \u201cAgainst Field Interpretations of Quantum\nField Theory\u201d, <em>British Journal for Philosophy of\nScience</em>, 60: 585\u2013609.", "Bell, J.S., 1964, \u201cOn the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox\n\u201d, <em>Physics</em>, 1: 195\u2013200.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1990, \u201cLa nouvelle cuisine\u201d, in\nSarlemijn and Krose (eds.), <em>Between Science and Technology</em>:\n97\u2013115.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2004, <em>Speakable and Unspeakable in\nQuantum Mechanics</em>, second revised edition, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.", "Belnap, N., 1992, \u201cBranching Space-time\u201d,\n<em>Synthese</em>, 92: 385-434.", "Belot, G., 1998, \u201cUnderstanding Electromagnetism\u201d,\n<em>British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</em>, 49:\n531\u201355.", "Berkovitz, J., 1998, \u201cAspects of Quantum Non-Locality\nI\u201d, <em>Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern\nPhysics</em>, 29B: 183\u2013222.", "Bohm, D., 1952, \u201cA suggested interpretation of the quantum\ntheory in terms of \u2018hidden variables\u2019, I and II\u201d,\n<em>Physical Review</em>, 85: 166\u2013193.", "Bohm, D., 1980, <em>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</em>,\nLondon: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.", "Bohm, D. and Hiley, B.J., 1993, <em>The Undivided Universe</em>,\nNew York: Routledge.", "Bohr, N., 1934, <em>Atomic Theory and the Description of\nNature</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Butterfield, J., 2006, \u201cAgainst <em>Pointillisme</em> about\nMechanics\u201d, <em>British Journal for the Philosophy of\nScience</em>, 57: 655\u2013689.", "Clifton, R. and Dickson, M., 1998, \u201cLorentz-Invariance in\nModal Interpretations\u201d, in D.
