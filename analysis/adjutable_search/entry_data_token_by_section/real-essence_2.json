Historical Antecedents: Bacon and Boyle\n\nWhile the concept and definition of \u2018real essence\u2019 is\noriginal with Locke, at least a generation before him there were\nEnglishmen who defended non-Scholastic taxonomical theories that\nemployed material structures, either atomic or corpuscularian\nstructures, to play both roles (a) and (b), and therefore serve as the\nessences of physical substances. One notable example is from Sir\nFrancis Bacon.\n\nIn Book II \u00a7\u00a7i\u2013vii of The New Organon (1620),\nBacon seems to give a version of corpuscular natural kinds by\nredefining the concept of \u2018formal cause\u2019 as both the\nmaterial structure of bodies and the laws that govern the natural\neffects of these structures that accounts for their species and genus\nmembership. For example, in II.ii he says,\n\n\nFor though nothing exists in nature except individual bodies which\nexhibit pure individual acts [powers] in accordance with law\u2026It\nis this law and its clauses which we understand by the term\nForms\u2026. (Bacon 1620, 103)\n\n\nAnd later in II.iii: \u201cBut he who knows forms comprehends the\nunity of nature in very different materials\u201d (Bacon 1620, 103).\nThese Baconian forms, as they constitute the powers of material\nbodies, divide nature into two classes of material structures: the\nelements (what he calls \u2018major associations\u2019) and the\ngenera and species of natural bodies (his \u2018minor\nassociations\u2019):\n\n\nWe want elements to be understood in the sense not of the prime\nqualities of things, but of the major constituents of natural bodies.\nFor the nature of things is so distributed that the quantity or mass\nof certain bodies is very great, because their structure requires the\ntexture of an easy and common material\u2026But the quantity of\ncertain other bodies in the universe is small and occurs rarely,\nbecause the texture of their matter is very different, very subtle and\nfor the most part delimited and organic; such are the species of\nnatural things, metals, plants, animals. (Bacon 1620, 226)\n\n\nAccording to Bacon, more general material structures convene to create\nlarger\u2014and more sparse\u2014bodies, and given the laws of\nnature that correlate powers to these structures, these bodies have\ntheir natures and belong to a species or genus due to the structures\nand causal powers of their constituent parts. Baconian forms exhibit\nthe two features of what me might call \u2018corpuscular\nforms\u2019: material structures plus the laws of nature combine to\ncause and explain the properties of bodies and determine their species\n membership.[2]\n\nSimilarly, in the Origine of Formes and Qualities, Robert\nBoyle employs the concept of a material essence when he argues for the\nexistence of corpuscular forms that do all the same philosophical and\nexplanatory work as both the real and nominal essences:\n\n\n\u2026why may we not say, that the Form of a Body, being made up of\nthose Qualities united in one Subject, doth likewise consist in such a\nConvention of those newly nam\u2019d Mechanical Affections of Matter,\nas is necessary to constitute a Body of that Determinate kind. And so,\nthough I shall for brevities sake retain the word Forme, yet\nI would be understood to mean by it, not a Real Substance\ndistinct from Matter, but onely the Matter it self of a Natural Body,\nconsider\u2019d with its peculiar manner of Existence [corpuscular\nstructure], which I think may not inconveniently be call\u2019d\neither its Specifical or its Denominating State, or\nits Essential Modification, or, if you would have me express\nit in one word, its Stamp: for such a Convention of Accidents\nis sufficient to perform the Offices that are necessarily\nrequir\u2019d in what Men call a Forme, since it makes the\nbody such as it is, making it appertain to this or that Determinate\nSpecies of Bodies, and discriminating it from all other Species of\nBodies whatsoever\u2026. (Boyle 1666, p. 324.)\n\n\nThat is, Boylean corpuscular forms both cause and explain the\nqualities of bodies and sort natural bodies into species based on the\nstructure of the matter and the laws binding qualities to the specific\n structures.[3]\n\nSo, we see that there are corpuscular versions of natural kind realism\nafoot in early seventeenth-century England where both roles of\ndetermining the species or genus membership and of causing and\nexplaining the observable qualities are played by the same entity:\ncorpuscular structure. The degree to which Locke agrees with, rejects\nor even engages with these views is a matter of scholarly\ncontroversy.\n\nNevertheless, we can say that, just as with the Scholastic natural\nphilosophy, there were adherents to the mechanical natural philosophy\nwho postulated a single entity to play both the causal and\nclassificatory roles; we can call these philosophers\n\u2018corpuscular realists\u2019 and we may say that they argue for\nthe existence of what we might call \u2018corpuscular species\u2019,\ni.e., species created by nature by corpuscular forms. By contrast,\nagain, Locke objects to this general approach for the creation of a\nscientific taxonomy:\n\n\nNor indeed can we rank, and sort Things, and\nconsequently (which is the end of sorting) denominate them by\ntheir real Essences, because we know them not. Our Faculties\ncarry us no farther towards the knowledge and distinction of\nSubstances, than a Collection of those sensible Ideas, which\nwe observe in them; which however made with the greatest diligence and\nexactness, we are capable of, yet is more remote from the true\ninternal Constitution, from which those Qualities flow, than, as I\nsaid, a Countryman\u2019s Idea is from the inward\ncontrivance of that famous Clock at Strasburg, whereof he\nonly sees the outward Figure and Motions. (III.vi.9)\n\n\nIf we have no knowledge of real essences, then there is no way to use\nreal essences in our sorting practice. Moreover, as he alludes at the\nend of the quotation, in order for a general inference about the\ninternal constitutions of substances to be justified, we would have to\nknow a lot more about the causal connections between the internal\nconstitution and what we observe than we do:\n\n\n\u2026it is impossible for us to know, that this or that quality or\nIdea has a necessary connexion with a real Essence, of which\nwe have no Idea at all, whatever Species that supposed real\nEssence may be imagined to constitute. (IV.vi.5)\n\n\nThe differences between Locke and the natural kind realists from among\nthe ranks of the corpuscularians can be illustrated by the following\nchart:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n(a) Determines Species/Genus\n\nMembership\n(b) Causes/Explains Observable\n\nQualities \n\nScholastics\nSubstantial Form\nSubstantial Form \n\nCorpuscular Realists\nCorpuscular Form\nCorpuscular Form \n\nLocke\nNominal Essence\nReal Essence  \n\n\nThere are Locke scholars who (though this is controversial) argue that\nLocke uses this distinction between real and nominal essences to\ncriticize the taxonomical theories of both the Scholastics and those\nmechanistic natural philosophers who invoke corpuscular species forms\n(see Jones 2010, pp. 147\u2013172).\n\nIt is universally agreed that Locke thinks that we sort things into\nspecies and genera based on nominal essences and species and genera\nare a kind of human linguistic categorization process. On the other\nhand, one might think, Locke has no reason to reject natural kinds\n(which concern the metaphysics of nature, and not the meanings of\nnames) simply because our sorting process is arbitrary. In other\nwords, there are those who argue that Locke was a natural kind\nrealist, even though he was convinced that taxonomies are the\nworkmanship of the understanding. Whether Locke thinks that there are\nnatural kinds, i.e., types of real essences independently of human\nsorting activities, is an interpretive issue we shall address in\n 4.3 below.\n",
