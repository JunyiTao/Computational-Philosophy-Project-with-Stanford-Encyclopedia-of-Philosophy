    "main_text": "Perfectibility\n5. Conclusion\n\nAnne Conway presents her system as an answer to the dominant\nphilosophies of her time. Several chapters of her treatise are devoted\nto a refutation of the dualism of Henry More and Descartes. (She does,\nhowever, express her admiration for Descartes\u2019 physics). She also\ntakes issue with Hobbes and Spinoza, whom she charges with material\npantheism, which confounds God and created substance. Anne Conway\u2019s\nconcept of substance probably owes much to Platonism and Kabbalism\n(which, in the version she encountered was heavily Platonised). Her\nthinking also shows the impact of the teachings of the heterodox\nChristian theologian, Origen, who was much admired by her teacher,\nHenry More. In many respects, her system anticipates the philosophy of\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who recognized affinities with his own\nphilosophy. (Leibniz in fact owned a copy of her\ntreatise\u2014probably a gift to him by their mutual friend, Van\nHelmont). However, although she was unusual as a female philosopher of\nthe seventeenth century, by virtue of the fact that her philosophy\nachieved publication, the anonymity of Conway\u2019s work has ensured\nthat she has suffered the same neglect that has been the lot of most\npre-modern female philosophers.\n",
