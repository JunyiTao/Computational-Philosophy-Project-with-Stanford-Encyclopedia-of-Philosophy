    "main_text": "\n\nMedieval philosophical texts are written in a variety of literary\nforms, many peculiar to the period, like the summa or\ndisputed question; others, like the commentary, dialogue, and axiom,\nare also found in ancient and modern sources but are substantially\ndifferent in the medieval period from the classical or modern\ninstantiations of these forms. Many philosophical texts also have a\nhighly polemical style and/or seem deferential to the authoritative\nsources they cite. Further, medieval philosophical thinkers operated\nunder the threat of censure from political and religious authority,\nmoving them, some have argued, to write esoterically or indirectly to\nprotect themselves from persecution for their true views. All these\nliterary and rhetorical features make medieval philosophical texts\nconsiderably more difficult to understand and interpret than modern or\neven classical philosophical texts. Moreover, the broad range of\ngenres used in medieval philosophy raises questions about the nature\nof philosophical writing in general when compared to the much more\nrestricted set of accepted forms in modern and contemporary\nphilosophical works.\n",
