    "main_text": "Truth in Fiction\n2. Truth in Fiction\n\nWhatever the right theory of the nature of fiction, (nearly) everyone\nagrees that there are paradigm cases of works of fiction. Many of the\nsentences in such works are, of course, not true since in paradigm\ncases of fiction much of the content is made up. For example, the\nsentence \n\n\nIt was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy\nnight, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker\nStreet. (The Hound of the Baskervilles: ch. 15) \n\n\nis not true at any real context of utterance since there is no\nSherlock Holmes, and no Dr. Watson to utter the sentence. More\ngenerally, sentences that purport to describe the world depicted in a\nwork of fiction are often false (or at least not true) since they\nmisdescribe the world as it actually is; \u201cHolmes was a detective\nliving at 221B Baker Street, London\u201d, for example. Still, this\nsentence sounds true, whereas a sentence like \u201cHolmes\nwas a short-order cook living in Paris\u201d sounds false. One way of\ncapturing this point is to say that fictional sentences are elliptic\nfor sentences with an \u201cin the story\u201d prefix (Lewis 1978\n[1983]): what is true is that in The Hound of the\nBaskervilles Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes sat reminiscing in\ntheir sitting-room in Baker Street on a raw and foggy night in\nNovember, just as it is true that in The Hound of the\nBaskervilles (and virtually all the Holmes stories) Holmes was a\ndetective living at 221B Baker Street, London. \n\nThis shifts the problem of how to understand the kind of truth that\nsentences have in a work of fiction to the actual truth of sentences\nof the form \u201cIn work of\nfiction F, \u03c6\u201d. How should we understand such\nprefixed sentences? It can\u2019t simply be that a such a sentence is\ntrue if and only if \u03c6 is explicitly stated in the text\nof F. For one thing, some things are not true in a work despite\nbeing explicitly stated\u2014the internal narrator of a story may be\nhighly unreliable (for example Charles Kinbote in\nNabokov\u2019s Pale Fire [1962]). In addition, to identify\nsomething as an (obvious) truth of fiction we often have to rely on\nvarious (uncontentious) interpretive moves that belong to the\npragmatics rather than semantics of language \u2013 what is stated\nmay go beyond what the words explicitly say (this is so even in the\ncase of a paradigm fictional truth like \u201cHolmes lived at 221B\nBaker Street\u201d; see Hanley 2004).\n\nPut the problem of the unreliable narrator aside for now, and assume\nthat normal practices of interpretation apply when identifying the\nfictional truths stated in a work of fiction. Philosophers of fiction\nhave been mainly interested in the second problem: that of\ncharacterizing what it is for a sentence to be true in a work despite\nnot being stated in the work. A first attempt might focus on the\nbackground of actual fact that is available to readers of the work:\ngiven that London is the capital of Great Britain, the fact that the\nHolmes stories say that Holmes lived in London suggests that it is\nalso true in the Holmes stories that Holmes lived in the capital of\nGreat Britain. The simplest way to capture this thought would be to\nsay that it is true in a fiction that p iff p is a\nlogical consequence of the set of propositions that are represented as\ntrue in a story, combined with the set of all actual truths. But this\nsuggestion won\u2019t do. Many actual truths are inconsistent with\nwhat is stated in a story, and so can\u2019t be drawn upon in this\nway to yield claims about what is true in the story. (It\nis actually true, for example, that London did not have as\ninhabitant a famous detective called \u201cHolmes\u201d who lived at\n221B Baker St. But it is not true in the Holmes stories that Holmes\nlived in a city that did not have as inhabitant a famous detective\ncalled \u201cHolmes\u201d who lived at 221B Baker St.) We need to\nfilter out the background that we can legitimately draw upon when we\ndetermine what is true in a work.\n",
