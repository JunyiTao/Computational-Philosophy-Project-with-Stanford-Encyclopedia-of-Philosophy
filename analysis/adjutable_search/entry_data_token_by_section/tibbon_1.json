    "main_text": "Life of Samuel Ibn Tibbon\n2. Life of Samuel Ibn Tibbon\n\n\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon\u2014the second generation of the Ibn Tibbon\ndynasty\u2014was born in Lunel, a small but very active rabbinic\ncenter in southern France. There\nhis father raised him and educated him according to the ideals of\nIslamic Spain. Thus, in addition to classical Jewish\nsubjects\u2014Hebrew language, Hebrew Bible, and Rabbinic\nliterature\u2014Samuel studied Arabic, philosophy and\nmedicine. Samuel was also introduced to the literary arts, including\ncalligraphy, poetry, and epistolary. But the world of belles lettres\ndid not find favor with the younger Ibn Tibbon; he was far more\ninterested in philosophy than poetry.\n\n\nAlthough Samuel was raised in Lunel, he traveled extensively for\nbusiness and in pursuit of knowledge. During his youth, he visited\nMarseilles with his father in order to engage in commerce. He\ncompleted his translation of the Guide of the Perplexed in\nArles in 1204, consulted manuscripts of the Meteorology in\nToledo and Barcelona (between 1204\u20131210), and traveled twice to\nAlexandria, returning in 1210 and 1213 (while in Egypt he seems to\nhave acquired Maimonides\u2019 \u201cLetter to Yemen\u201d and an\nautograph copy of the Mishneh Torah). By 1211, Samuel\nseems to have moved his primary residence to Marseilles. There Jewish\nsages, on their way to the holy land, visited him in order to consult\nhis translation of the Guide. It was in Marseilles, moreover,\nwhere he taught his son-in-law and most famous disciple Jacob\nAnatoli.\n\n\nDuring his early years, Samuel was influenced primarily by his\nfather. His mature work, in contrast, was built largely upon the\nfoundations of Maimonides. Samuel translated the Guide and\nother writings by Maimonides, and corresponded with the \u201cTrue\nSage\u201d regarding problems of translation and interpretation. In\nfact, much of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s life work was devoted to the explanation\nand dissemination of the teachings of Maimonides. But promoting\nMaimonides meant engaging philosophy more generally as well. Thus he\nacquired extensive knowledge of al-Farabi, cited and discussed\nAvicenna, and was one of the first scholars to make use of Averroes\nand al-Bitruji. There is some evidence that Samuel had contact with\nearly Christian scholasticism as well. This is suggested by the\nsurprising similarity between the interests of Ibn Tibbon and those of\nhis contemporaries, such as Michael Scot and Alfred of Sarashel.\n\n\nOf all the members of the Ibn Tibbon family, Samuel was the most\ninfluential. He was already quoted and eulogized by his contemporary,\nDavid Kimhi, and had decisive impact on the work of his son Moses and\nson-in-law Jacob Anatoli. But his influence is felt elsewhere as well.\nFor example, in thirteenth-century Provence, he was plagiarized by\nGershom b. Solomon, cited and discussed by Levi b. Abraham, and\ndefended by Menahem ha-Meiri. In Italy, his writings were consulted\nand commented upon by Moses of Salerno, Zerahyah b. Isaac b. Shealtiel\nHen, Judah Romano, and especially Immanuel of Rome, who excerpted\nlarge sections from Ibn Tibbon\u2019s writings and incorporated them into\nhis commentaries on the Bible. So important was Ibn Tibbon\u2019s work that\nhe was singled out by the opponents of philosophy. Thus Jacob b.\nSheshet wrote a full-length critique of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, while Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier \u2014\nthe main anti-Maimonidean activist during the Maimonidean controversy\nof the 1230s \u2014 accused him of revealing the secrets of\nthe Guide to the uninitiated.  In the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries, Ibn Tibbon was second to none as Maimonidean\nauthority in philosophy and philosophical exegesis.\n",
