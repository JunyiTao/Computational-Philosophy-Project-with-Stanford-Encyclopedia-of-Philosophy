Ecological Fitness and the Problem of Evolutionary Drift\n \n\nThe difficulties that face both the subjective probability view of\nfitness and the probabilistic propensity definitions of fitness are\nserious enough to make the notion of \u201cecological fitness\u201d\nworth revisiting. Recall that on this view \u2018\\(a\\) is fitter than\n\\(b\\) in \\(E\\)\u2019 is defined as \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019s traits result\nin its solving the design problems set by \\(E\\) more fully than\n\\(b\\)\u2019s traits.\u2019 The terms in which this definition is\ncouched are certainly in as much need of clarification as is\n\u2018fitness\u2019. It is cold philosophical comfort to point out\nthat definitions have to stop somewhere, that the definition of a\ntheoretical term must be distinct from the operational measure of the\nproperty it names, and that testability is not a matter of theory\nmeeting data one proposition at a time. In consequence none of these\nconsiderations have convinced philosophers of biology to accept the\ndesign problem definition, and to give up the project of defining\nfitness by reference to its effects in reproduction. Nevertheless,\nthere does appear to be important biological work that the ecological\nfitness concept can do, and which no definition of fitness in terms of\ndifferential reproductive rates\u2014actual, expected, or\ndispositional\u2014can do.\n\n\nTo see what these tasks are, consider the question, How do we decide\nwhether a divergence from a long run relative frequency prediction\nabout fitness differences is a matter of drift, a disconfirmation of\nthe hypothesis of natural selection, or a reflection of a\nmismeasurement of fitness differences to begin with? Suppose we\nmeasure the fitness differences between population \\(a\\) and\npopulation \\(b\\) to be in the ratio of 7:3 (e.g., \\(w_a = 1\\), \\(w_b =\n.428\\)) and suppose further that in some generation, the actual\noffspring ratio is 5:5. There are four alternatives: (a) the fitness\nmeasure of 7:3 is right but there was drift\u2014i.e., the initial\nconditions at this generation are unrepresentative of those which\nobtain in all relevant generations; (b) the fitness measure of 7:3 was\nincorrect and there was no drift; (c) both drift and wrong fitness\nmeasure or (d) the principle of natural selection is\ndisconfirmed. Ignoring the fourth alternative, how do we discriminate\namong the first three of these?\n\n\nIn the absence of information about the initial conditions of the\ndivergence, there is only one way empirically to choose between\nalternatives (a)\u2013(c). This way requires that there are\necological fitness differences, and that we can detect them. Suppose\nthat fitness differences were matters of probabilistic differential\nreproductive success (no matter what interpretation of probability is\nadopted). Then the only access to fitness differences is via\npopulation censuses in previous generations (since these form the\nbases of the probabilities). Suppose that this census does indeed show\na 7:3 ratio between as and bs in the recent past. In order to exclude\nthe absence of fitness differences instead of drift, as the source of\nthe current generation\u2019s 5:5 outcome, we need to be able to\nestablish that the 7:3 differences in previous populations were not\nthemselves the result of drift. But this is the first step in a\nregress, since we began with the problem of discriminating drift from\nmismeasures of fitness. To solve the initial problem, we now have to\nassure ourselves that the 7:3 ratios in the past were not the result\nof drift. Whence the regress. Of course the problem does not arise\nif we have access to fitness differences independently of previous\npopulation censuses. And this access we have, at least in\nprinciple, if fitness is a matter of differences in the solution of\nidentifiable design problems, that is, if there is such a thing as\necological fitness and it is (fallibly) measured by probabilistic\npropensities to leave offspring.\n\n\nOnce we have access to ecological fitness differences, we can, at\nleast in principle, decide whether the divergence from predicted\nlong-run relative frequencies, especially where small populations are\nconcerned, is a matter of drift or reflects our ignorance either of\necological fitness differences or the unrepresentativeness of the\ninitial conditions of individual births, deaths, and\nreproductions.\n\n\nThis result also has important implications for the interpretation of\nthe theory of natural selection as one wholly about populations, and\nnot also about individual fitness differences, discussed above\n(individual versus trait fitness). Note that the problem of\ndistinguishing drift from selection in ensembles\u2014i.e., large\npopulations\u2014has the same character, and is in principle\nsusceptible to the same solution as the problem of drift makes for\nevolution among lineages with small numbers of individual members. We\ncan distinguish drift from selection in ensembles as well, if\nwe accept that there is such epistemic access to ecological fitness\ndifferences and to the initial conditions of births, deaths and\nreproductions, taken one at a time, and we accept that these\nindividual-differences aggregate into ensemble-differences.\n\n\nBecause populations no matter how large are always finite in size,\nthere is always some drift which needs to be distinguished from\nfitness differences. Thus even in population biology there is in the\nend no substitute for ecological fitness and no way to dispense with\nits services to the theory of natural selection. And since ecological\nfitness is ultimately a relationship between organisms (or\nindividuals) taken two at a time, the theory is as much a set of\nclaims about individuals as it is about populations.\n\n\nThis line of reasoning highlights the next phase of the debate. From a\ndiscussion about fitness, the debate has evolved into a general debate\nconcerning the nature of natural selection and drift. A number of\nalternative views have emerged in thinking about these topics. Some\n(e.g., Walsh, Lewens, Ariew, and Matthen) think about natural\nselection solely as population wide patterns caused by non selective\nprocesses: this view deprives fitness of any causal or explanatory\npower. Others (e.g., Millstein and Stephens) see fitness and natural\nselection as a cause, operating at the population level, to bring\nabout the differential reproduction rates. Finally others argue that,\nif it is to play an explanatory role in our theory, fitness has to be\nan individual and causal concept. As these debates suggest, far from\nbeing merely a 19th century slogan, understanding the\nmeaning of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is of\nphilosophical and biological urgency.\n",
