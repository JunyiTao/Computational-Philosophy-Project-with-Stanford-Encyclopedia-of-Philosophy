    "main_text": "Ontology and Epistemology Inspired by Logic || Reism\n5.1 Reism\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski developed a general doctrine, called reism. It has\ntwo aspects, ontological and semantic. Hence, we can speak about\nsemantic reism and ontological reism, although this distinction was\nclarified by Kotarbi\u0144ski later. In general, reism goes against\nthe acceptance of the existence of general (abstract) objects, that\nis, facts, properties, states of affairs, relations, etc. The main\nontological thesis of reism is as follows (it is subdivided into two\nsubtheses): (R1) any object is a material, spatio-temporal, concrete\nthing; (R2) no object is a state of affairs, property of relation\n(according to Kotarbi\u0144ski, these three categories exhaust the\ndomain of alleged abstract objects). Now (R1), that is, the positive\nthesis of reism has a rich content. Firstly, it marks a formal feature\nof existing objects, namely their concrete character.\n\nSecondly, it characterizes things as material and spatio-temporal\nentities, that is, as physical objects. Leibniz conceived monads as\nspiritual concreta. For the later Brentano, every object is concrete,\nbut there are souls and bodies. Thus, Leibniz\u2019s reism was\nmonistic and spiritualistic, Brentano\u2019s was dualistic, and\nKotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s monistic and materialistic. Although the\nterminology varies (one can equivalently speak about reism, concretism\nor nominalism), two claims of any theory going against general\n(abstract) objects should be very sharply distinguished. The first is\nformal-ontological and points out the formal feature of existents,\nnamely that they are individuals; but the second is\nmaterial-ontological or metaphysical and focuses on their nature as\nphysical or psychical entities.\n\nSemantic reism is parallel to the ontological aspect of this doctrine.\nThe key idea consists in the distinction of genuine names and apparent\nnames (onomatoids). A name is genuine if and only if refers to things,\nthat is, to concrete physical things. By contrast, onomatoids are\nwords that allegedly refer to abstract entities,\n\u201callegedly\u201d because their referents do not exist. At first\nglance, apparent names are similar to empty terms. However, this\nresemblance is merely apparent, because empty nouns are genuine names\nand can always be decomposed into non-empty genuine names (e.g.,\n\u201cround square\u201d). This becomes evident when we try to\nformulate the conditions of meaningfulness for sentences. In general,\na sentence is meaningful if and only if it consists (except for\nlogical constants) only of genuine names or is reducible to such\nsentences. For example, the sentence \u201call cats are\nanimals\u201d is reistically meaningful, but \u201cproperties are\nabstract objects\u201d is not. Furthermore, \u201ca square triangle\nis rectangular\u201d is good, but \u201csets exist outside of time\nand space\u201d is not. The sentence \u201cwhiteness is a property\nof snow\u201d can be reduced to \u201csnow is white\u201d. This\nexample shows how to translate some sentences with apparent names into\npurely reistic statements.\n\nMatters become clearer if one remembers that Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\ncalculus of names is the underlying logic of reism. The copula\n\u201cis\u201d in \u201csnow is white\u201d functions with its\nmeaning defined by the axiom of LO (see above). Thus, this sentence is\ntrue if its subject refers to an individual object. The traditional\ninterpretation of common nouns and adjectives, consistent with LO, as\ngeneral terms referring to many objects, saves their reistic\ncharacter. Thus, one can say that the formal-ontological aspect of\nreism is adequately displayed by LO. Of course, reism as a\nmetaphysical doctrine is an addition to LO.\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski recommended reism as a sound view. In particular, it\ndefends philosophy and ordinary thinking before hypostases, that is,\naccepting the existence of abstract objects on the basis of using\napparent names. Thus, reism defends us against idola fori in\nBacon\u2019s sense. Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s reism is perhaps the\nmost radical materialistic nominalism in the history of philosophy.\nReism is exceptional to the main tendency in the LWS in that it\nproposes a uniform language, proper everywhere, including the\nhumanities, sociology and psychology (Kotarbi\u0144ski supplemented\nreism by radical realism, that is, the view that there are no mental\ncontents). In this respect, reism resembles physicalism. The troubles\nof reism are typical those which are in the case of any reductive\nmaterialism and nominalism, and concern the interpretation of\nmathematics, semantics, psychology, the humanities and social\nsciences.\n",
