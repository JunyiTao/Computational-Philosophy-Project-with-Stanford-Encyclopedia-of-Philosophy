    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Analects (Lunyu) and Mencius\n2.3 Analects (Lunyu) and Mencius\n\nOstensibly a collection of sayings by Confucius and his students, much\nif not all of the Analects was composed after\nConfucius\u2019s death, and its various chapters express the\nteachings of individuals who identified themselves with\nConfucius\u2019s legacy. The earliest chapters in the text\n(mid-5th to mid-4th century BCE; chs. 3\u20139)\nmay well be the earliest written philosophical reflection in China,\nbut show little direct concern with governance. In one of the most\ndramatic shifts in the text, governance takes center stage in a set of\nchapters (12, 13, 2) which may date from the last quarter of the\n4th century BCE (Brooks & Brooks 1998). The theory of\nthis segment of the Analects has much in common with the\nGuanzi. Asked about government, \u201cConfucius\u201d is\nmade to say: \u201cEnough food; enough weapons; the people having\nconfidence in the ruler\u201d (LY 12:7, p. 91). Of these,\n\u201cconfidence (xin)\u201d is most important.\n\u201cConfidence\u201d here means that one identifies with\none\u2019s ruler, doing so because he manifestly seeks what is good\nfor one (see also LY 13:29\u201330).\n\nThe dynamic of people identifying with and modeling themselves on the\nruler permeates the text\u2019s understanding of governance. Asked\nwhether a ruler should kill those who fail to follow the way\n(dao), Confucius responds:\n\n\nYou are there to govern; what use have you for killing? If you desire\nthe good, the people will be good. The virtue of the gentleman is the\nwind; the virtue of the little people is the grass. The wind on the\ngrass will surely bend it. (LY 12:19, p. 94; see also LY 2:1)\n\n\nUnlike the emphasis put on \u201cpunishments\u201d as one kind of\n\u201cstandard (fa)\u201d in the Guanzi, the\nAnalects here minimizes the importance of killing. This point\nis reinforced in perhaps the most famous saying in the text about\ngovernance:\n\n\nLead them with government and regulate them by punishments, and the\npeople will evade them with no sense of shame. Lead them with virtue\nand regulate them by ritual, and they will acquire a sense of\nshame\u2014and moreover, they will be orderly. (LY 2:3, p. 110)\n\n\nThere are only a few passages in the text that stress the continued\nneed for punishments in a good society, and they all come quite late\nin the text: 13:3 is an obvious interpolation, and like the similar\n20:2, probably dates to the mid-third century BCE.\n\nIn a variety of ways the Mencius picks up where\nAnalects 12, 13, and 2 left off. One innovation of the\nMencius is to give a name to its preferred mode of\ngovernance: \u201chumane government (renzheng)\u201d. This\nmeans that one should rule by loving the people like a parent loves\nhis children: providing for them, educating them, giving them a role\nmodel. The text stresses that while this policy is beneficial to all\ninvolved, one must pursue it out of humane concern rather than out of\ncold calculation. Because of the ruler\u2019s ability to transform\nothers through his example, if he acts on the basis of \u201cbenefit\n(li)\u201d alone, his subjects will do so as well, and each\nfrom his or her own, narrow perspective. The result will be chaos and\nsuffering, rather than order, harmony, and mutual benefit, all of\nwhich would arise from genuinely humane governance (MC 1A:1).\n\nThe Mencius emphasizes humane governance as well as the\ndistinction between rightness (yi) and mere concern with\nbenefit, rejecting utilitarian calculation without regard to\nrightness. It also opposes coercive authority, recognizing that even\nmodeling and role-emulation work indirectly:\n\n\nYou can never win the allegiance of people by trying to dominate them\nwith goodness; but if you use goodness to nurture them, then you will\nwin the allegiance of the whole world. (MC 4B:16; see also 7A:14)\n\n\nFrom other places in the text we can tell that Mencius (or his\nfollowers) knew and disapproved of the Mohists; this passage\ncriticizes the Mohist practice of directly enforcing a standard of\ngoodness through hierarchy. The Mencius contains numerous\nhierarchical ideas (see esp. MC 3A:4), but it has considerable faith\nin the people\u2019s ability to do good if they are provided for, and\nnot otherwise (see MC 1A7, 3A3).\n\nBoth the Mozi and the Guanzi stress the need for\nobjective standards (fa), as will many subsequent texts. In\nthis context Analects 12, 13, and 2 and Mencius\nstand out as not taking fa seriously. Even when we come upon\nthe tool metaphor in Mencius (MC 4A:1), it is applied to the\nidea of \u201chumane government\u201d rather than to specific,\ninstitutionalizable standards. This is not to say that the\nAnalects and Mencius were devoid of any notion of\n\u201cstandard\u201d. Their standard, though, is resolutely\nparticular, rather than objective and general: the model set by the\nethical ruler. The later Analects (e.g., 13:3, a late\ninterpolation) and the Xunzi (see below) recognize a role for\ncoercion, but authority in the earlier \u201cConfucian\u201d texts\nis non-coercive. People follow willingly, initially because the good\nruler provides for them, and increasingly because they come to love\nhim as a father: they are transformed from individuals into members of\na single, state-wide family.\n",
