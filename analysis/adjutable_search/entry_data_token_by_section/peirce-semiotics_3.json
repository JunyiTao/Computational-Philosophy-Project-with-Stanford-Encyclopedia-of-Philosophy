    "main_text": "Basic Sign Structure || The Interpretant\n1.3 The Interpretant \n\nAlthough there are many features of the interpretant that bear further\ncomment, here we shall mention just two. First, although we have\ncharacterized the interpretant as the understanding we reach of some\nsign/object relation, it is perhaps more properly thought of as the\ntranslation or development of the original sign. The idea is that the\ninterpretant provides a translation of the sign, allowing us a more\ncomplex understanding of the sign\u2019s object. Indeed, Liszka (1996) and\nSavan (1988) both emphasize the need to treat interpretants as\ntranslations, with Savan even suggesting Peirce should have called it\nthe translatant (Savan 1988, 41). Second, just as with the sign/object\nrelation, Peirce believes the sign/interpretant relation to be one of\ndetermination: the sign determines an interpretant. Further, this\ndetermination is not determination in any causal sense, rather, the\nsign determines an interpretant by using certain features of the way\nthe sign signifies its object to generate and shape our understanding.\nSo, the way that smoke generates or determines an interpretant sign of\nits object, fire, is by focusing our attention upon the physical\nconnection between smoke and fire.\n\nFor Peirce, then, any instance of signification contains a\nsign-vehicle, an object and interpretant. Moreover, the object\ndetermines the sign by placing constraints which any sign must meet if\nit is to signify the object. Consequently, the sign signifies its\nobject only in virtue of some of its features. Additionally, the sign\ndetermines an interpretant by focusing our understanding on certain\nfeatures of the signifying relation between sign and object. This\nenables us to understand the object of the sign more fully.\n\nAlthough this is a general picture of Peirce\u2019s ideas about sign\nstructure, and certain features are more or less present, or given\ngreater or lesser emphasis at various points in Peirce\u2019s development\nof his theory of signs, this triadic structure and the relation\nbetween the elements is present in all of Peirce\u2019s accounts. In what\nfollows, we shall see three of Peirce\u2019s attempts at giving a full\naccount of signs and signification, the corresponding sign typologies,\nlook at the transitions between these accounts, and examine some of\nthe issues that arise from them.\n",
