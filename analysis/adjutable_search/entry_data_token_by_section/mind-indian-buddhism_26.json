It is \ndebatable, however, whether this position on the intrinsic validity \nof perceptual cognitions implies that the Buddhist epistemologists \npursue a kind of epistemic foundationalism (akin to that of modern \nsense datum theorists) or, rather, that they are concerned with the \nintentional character of the phenomenal contents of experience (see \nSiderits 2004, Dreyfus 1996, Tillemans 1999, 2003, Coseru 2012).\n\n\nPhilosophers of the Abhidharma traditions had argued that our \ncognitive propensities are beginningless, each thought being merely \nthe continuation of an endless series of previous thoughts, which \nconstantly inform, influence, and direct the cognitive process (see \nAKBh ad III, 19). They maintained that these cognitive \npropensities are most vividly manifest in traces of memory and in the\nactivity of conceptual thought. The Buddhist epistemologists, \nhowever, came to reject both memory (s\u1e43rti) and \nconceptual elaboration (kalpan\u0101) as reliable sources of\nknowledge. These cognitive modalities were completely dissociated \nfrom direct perception, the only type of cognitive awareness that \nDign\u0101ga regarded as warranted.\n\n\nThe Buddhist epistemologists adopt a parsimonious epistemology: only \ntwo sources or instruments of cognition (pram\u0101\u1e47a)\nare accepted are reliable: perception (pratyak\u1e63a) and \ninference (anum\u0101na). Dign\u0101ga gives a most basic \nreason why we ought to accept only these two sources as warranted: \nthat is, because there are only two types of objects, those bearing \ntheir own characteristic mark (i.e., particulars) and those whose \ncharacteristic is that of universality (i.e., universals), each \ncorresponding to a specific mode of apprehension (PSV ad I, \n2; Hattori 1968, 24, 79). What we have here is an attempt to \ntranslate the two fundamental categories of particular and universal \nback to their specific knowledge source: particulars to perception \nand universals to inferential reasoning. Dign\u0101ga, thus, appears \nto be claiming that all objects of cognition, whether external or \ninternal, cannot be properly understood if separated from the types \nof cognitive events in which they are instantiated, a view best \ndescribed as phenomenalism.\n",
