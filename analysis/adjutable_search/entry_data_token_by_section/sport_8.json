    "main_text": "Topics in the Philosophy of Sport || Cheating\n3.2 Cheating\n\n\nIn contrast to sportsmanship, cheating represents, at least prima\nfacie, the chief form of moral failure in sport.\n\n\nCheating has proved to be a notoriously difficult concept to define.\nA commonsense understanding of cheating as the \u2018intentional\nviolation of the rules to gain a competitive advantage\u2019 is\nreplete with difficulties (Green, 2006; Russell, 2017). For example, if\ncheating is necessarily a type of rule violation, what of the\nviolation of conventions and other norms not captured by the formal\nrules? If cheating must be aimed at the attainment of competitive\nadvantage, what of intentional rule-breaking that aims to rectify an\nearlier injustice (e.g. cheating or refereeing error) that advantaged\none\u2019s opponent?\n\n\nLeaving aside definitional issues and turning to the moral status of\ncheating, moral objections to cheating typically rest on two principal\narguments. The first invokes the logical incompatibility thesis \u2013\nthe idea that rule-breaking is not compatible with game playing,\nbecause game playing requires strict adherence to the rules (see sect.\n2.1). This argument could justify a prohibition of only forms of\ncheating that involve rule-breaking: it could not ground an\nobjection to cheating that involves the violation of conventions or\nbroad internalist principles. The second argument relies on the idea\nthat cheating is an attempt to gain an unfair advantage, that is, an\nadvantage not permitted under the agreement between players or the set\nof norms by which players are expected to abide (Gert, 2004).\nFairness-based objections may not ground a prohibition to\n\u2018retaliatory\u2019 or \u2018compensatory\u2019 cheating that\nis undertaken to re-establish fairness following an injustice that has\nplaced a competitor at an unfair disadvantage (Kirkwood, 2012).\n\n\nThe moral impermissibility of cheating has been challenged from\nseveral directions. The case of cyclist Lance Armstrong has provided a\nfocal point for some of this debate (Moore, 2017b; Pike and Cordell,\nforthcoming): is cheating wrong if one\u2019s competitors (or at least a\nsignificant proportion of one\u2019s competitors) are also cheating?\nThat is, does one\u2019s duty not to cheat cease if one\u2019s\ncompetitors do not discharge their duty not to cheat? Here the problem\nof ethics in non-ideal theory (i.e. acting in conditions of only\npartial compliance with justice) arises in sport.\n\n\nOliver Leaman has argued that cheating can become part of the skill\nand strategy of a game, thereby adding to the game\u2019s excitement\nand interest for both players and spectators. If cheating is accepted\nas part of the game such that all competitors recognize cheating as an\noption (whether or not they avail of that option), then concerns over\nequality and justice do not arise (Leaman, 1981) In these\ncircumstances, according to Leaman, cheating would be morally\npermissible.\n\n\nHugh Upton (2011) has gone further to suggest not only that cheating\nmay be morally permissible in certain circumstances but that\none may be morally required to cheat. This moral requirement\narises specifically in team sports where, from a duty of loyalty, a\nplayer may owe her teammates maximum effort to win the game subject\nonly to the requirements of fair play that are routinely observed in\nthe sport. To observe standards of fair play that are not usually\nobserved in the sport may be \u2018self-indulgent\u2019,\ndemonstrating an undue concern for one\u2019s own ethical propriety at\nthe expense of one\u2019s teammates. On this view, the duty not to let down\none\u2019s teammates may imply a duty to cheat.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the related discussion of\n\u2018gamesmanship\u2019. This is a term used to denote conduct that\nfalls short of cheating (as it does not violate the formal rules) but\nis morally dubious nonetheless. Such acts might include the\nintimidation of one\u2019s opponent, the manipulation of officials, or\nthe intentional disruption of an opponent\u2019s preparations (e.g.\ncoughing just as she is about to putt). Gamesmanship may add a test of\none\u2019s psychological robustness to the sporting contest, but this\nmay diminish the contest as a test of athletic excellence (Howe, 2004).\nWhile such conduct is not formally proscribed, it speaks to a question\nthat every athlete must ponder: what should I be prepared to do to\nwin?\n",
