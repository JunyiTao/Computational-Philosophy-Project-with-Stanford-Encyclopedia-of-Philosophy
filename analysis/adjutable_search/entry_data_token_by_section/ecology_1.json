    "main_text": "Population Ecology\n2. Population Ecology[9]\n\n\nThe golden age of theoretical ecology (1920-1940)\u2014to borrow\nthe title of a book edited by Scudo and Ziegler\u2014consisted\nprimarily of population\n ecology.[10]\n The next generation saw a shift of theoretical interest to community\necology. In recent years, interest has reverted to population ecology,\nsometimes in the form of metapopulation models (consisting of a set of\npopulations with migration between them).  Models in population\necology are based on representing an ecological system as the set of\npopulations (of the same or different species) it consists of. Each\npopulation, in turn, consists of potentially interacting individuals\nof a species. Populations may be characterized by their state\nvariables (parameters representing properties of the population as a\nwhole, for instance, size, density, growth-rate, etc.) or by\nindividual variables, that is, the properties of the\nindividuals in them (for instance, individual fecundity, interactions,\n etc.).[11]\n Classical population ecology was restricted to the study of\nstate-based models primarily because of the requirement that models be\ntractable, so as to permit predictions and\n explanations.[12]\n State-based models will be the focus of this section;\nindividual-based models will be discussed in\n Section 5.1.\n Classical population ecology is the part of ecology that is\ntheoretically the most developed. The central issue of interest in\npopulation ecology is the change in the size of populations (their\n\u201cabundances\u201d) over time.\n\n\nPopulation ecology considers both deterministic and stochastic\nmodels. Much of philosophical writing on population ecology has been\nrestricted to deterministic population models and this relatively large\nbody of work will only be very briefly summarized. More attention will\nbe paid to stochastic models which raise much more interesting\nphilosophical issues that have not been adequately explored.\n",
