Sequential higher-order computation: the full abstraction problem for PCF\n\nThe full abstraction problem has proved especially hard for a version\nof simply typed \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus with arithmetic primitives called\nPCF (Programming with Computable Functions) (Plotkin 1977), a toy\nprogramming language based on the Logic for Computable Functions of\nScott (1969) and Milner (1973). In this section we introduce (a\nversion of) the language with its operational and denotational\nsemantics, and outline how the full abstraction problem arises for\nthis language. The problem has been one of the major concerns of the\ntheoretical investigation of programming languages for about two\ndecades, from its original formulation in the landmark papers (Milner\n1977; Plotkin 1977) to the first solutions proposed in 1993 (Abramsky\net al. 2000; Hyland & Ong 2000) using game semantics, for which\nsee\n Section 3.\n",
