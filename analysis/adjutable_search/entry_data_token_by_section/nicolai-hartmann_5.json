What is the Place of Humankind in the World? || Anthropology\n4.3 Anthropology\n\nFischer has argued that Hartmann should be counted among the members\nof a \u201cCologne Constellation\u201d of thinkers whose main\nproject was the development of a philosophical anthropology that\ncombined serious reflection on human being as a biological creature\nwith the findings of the human sciences and humanities (Fischer 2012).\nMax Scheler, Helmuth Plessner (1892\u20131985), Hartmann, and later, Arnold\nGehlen (1904\u20131976), are included in this group. They all shared the\ndesire to bridge the dualism between natural scientific and humanistic\naccounts (Scheler 1928, Plessner 1928, Gehlen 1940). They knew each\nother\u2019s work, and their mutual influences remain to be\ndisentangled. While Hartmann did not write a book devoted to\nphilosophical anthropology, his ideas on the topic are scattered\nthroughout a number of works, including The Problem of Spiritual\nBeing (1933), OLF (1935), a long review of Gehlen\u2019s book\n(1941), and \u201cNaturphilosophie und Anthropologie\u201d (1944).\nCharacteristically, Hartmann\u2019s view rejects both reductive\nnaturalistic accounts as well as the anthropocentric exceptionalism\nthat characterizes many idealist humanistic views. In The Problem\nof Spiritual Being, Hartmann explains that the category of the\n\u201cspirit\u201d is divided into personal, objective and\nobjectivated spirit. Personal spirit is the spirit of the individual;\nobjective spirit is the living spirit of communities; and objectivated\nspirit characterizes the products of spirit. As he also explained in\nthe Ethics, the categorial features of personal spirit are\nconsciousness, will, foresight and teleological activity. None of\nthese features pass to objective spirit. There is no consciousness\napart from individual consciousness, and the same applies to the other\ncapacities. He thus rejects the idealist conception of a unifying\nabsolute spirit. In order to ward off materialist reductionism, he\nembraces a nonreductive naturalism that acknowledges the ontological\ndependence of higher functions on lower processes without detriment to\nthe autonomy and novelty of the higher. He carefully works to\nreconcile the disparate facets of the human phenomenon, such as the\nfact that human beings are vanishing specks of dust in a vast cosmos\nas well as the only beings capable of creating masterpieces of art\nthat give meaning to the world. Human beings are ontologically\nstratified creatures, including physical, biological, mental, and\nspiritual features that reflect the stratified structure of reality.\nHartmann\u2019s anthropological ideas have gotten a good deal of\nattention in recent research (Kalckreuth et al. 2019; Hartung and\nWunsch 2014), and could also form an intriguing starting point for\ncomparison between Hartmann and other writers, such as McDowell\n(Wunsch 2020). The nature of the stratified ontology of the real world\non which it is based remains to be explained.\n",
