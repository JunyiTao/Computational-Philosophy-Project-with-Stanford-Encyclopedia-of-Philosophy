    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology || Absolute Idealism\n2.3 Absolute Idealism\n\nSo far, Green\u2019s idealism would seem to involve a plurality of\nlocal idealisms. Reality (or knowable reality) is the product of\nfinite self-conscious minds, with the result that there would be as\nmany realities (knowable realities) as there are finite\nconsciousnesses. Green finds such a conception of objectivity\ninsufficiently robust; objectivity requires a single inclusive and\neternal self-consciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a726, 67, 69;\nWorks II 85).\n\n\nWe must hold then that there is a consciousness for which the\nrelations of fact, that form the object of our gradually attained\nknowledge, already and eternally exist; and that the growing knowledge\nof the individual is a progress towards this consciousness.\n(PE \u00a769)\n\n\nThis corporate consciousness makes Green\u2019s version of idealism a\nversion of absolute idealism. The consciousnesses of individuals stand\nto this single corporate consciousness much as stages or parts of a\nperson\u2019s life stand to the person.\n\nGreen\u2019s main argument for this form of absolute idealism seems\nto be his concern with the possibility of error (PE\n\u00a726). Just as we must make room for the possibility of local\nerror in an individual\u2019s conscious experience, so too we have to\nallow for the possibility of systematic error within an\nindividual\u2019s conscious experience. But just as the idealist\nexplains the possibility of local individual error against the\nbackground of larger patterns in the individual\u2019s experience, so\ntoo she must explain the possibility of systematic individual error\nagainst the background of some larger pattern of experience. In order\nto find a larger pattern of experience, we must go outside individual\nconsciousness. But the experiences of other individuals cannot, as\nsuch, form part of a common and larger set of experiences. If the\ncontent and truth conditions of an individual\u2019s thoughts are\ndependent on the relations between those thoughts and other elements\nof his consciousness, then individuals, as such, would have\nincommensurable experiences and thoughts. We can block this\nrelativistic conclusion if there is a single trans-historical\ncorporate mind of which particular finite minds are proper parts. For\nthen there will be a common determinant of the content and truth\nconditions of the experiences and thoughts of different finite agents.\nGreen\u2019s view seems to be that knowledge and, hence, inquiry\npresuppose absolute idealism (PE \u00a726).\n\nMany idealist metaphysical views are responses to skeptical worries\nthat our realist conclusions about objective reality outstrip the\nnature of our evidence. The idealist responds by denying that reality\nis objective in a way that could exceed our evidence. Green\u2019s\nidealism fits this pattern. By denying that our beliefs about the\nworld concern things in themselves, independently of the way that they\ndo or can seem to us, Green denies the skeptic\u2019s gap between our\nevidence and reality.\n\nThere are various questions one might raise about this sort of\nidealism. First, one might think that the idealist response concedes\ntoo much to the skeptic. Perhaps we can and should accept a gap\nbetween our evidence and the claims for which they are evidence,\nresisting the skeptic\u2019s demand that evidence guarantee the truth\nof the propositions it supports. We can concede that our justified\nbeliefs about the world are fallible. Second, we might note that\nabsolute idealism cannot guarantee truth either, because it outstrips\nthe knowledge available to individual conscious minds. The existence\nof a corporate consciousness is something outside the conscious grasp\nof any of us individually. This is especially true, given that Green\nthinks that the corporate consciousness lies outside of space and\ntime. Third, Green can be read as offering a transcendental argument\nthat empirical knowledge is possible only on the assumption that\nabsolute idealism is true. Even if that argument were otherwise\nsuccessful, it would establish absolute idealism only if empirical\nknowledge is possible. But if absolute idealism is the price of\nempirical knowledge, then one might wonder if we do indeed have\nempirical knowledge.\n",
