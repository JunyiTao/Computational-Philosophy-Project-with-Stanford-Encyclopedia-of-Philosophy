    "main_text": "Specific Fields || Logic\n5.1 Logic\n\nAnderson wrote a Textbook on Logic in the early 1920s\n(JAA, Textbook on Logic, released 2010) and its fate\ntells us much about his philosophical ambitions. According to his\nbiographer, Anderson submitted the manuscript not to narrowly academic\npublishers but to A. R. Orage, the editor of The New Age\n(Kennedy 1995 p. 64), described by the historian of Scottish\nphilosophy, George Davie, as serving a readership \u201cof\nlibertarian and often leftist autodidacts\u201d (Davie 1977 p. 57).\nUnder Orage the journal was nonetheless a highly influential avant\ngarde modernist vehicle for literary and political criticism. Anderson\nconceived his logic to have wider cultural aims than merely codifying\nforms of reasoning and when Orage rejected the work due to its\nsupposed eccentricity Anderson was deeply disappointed.\n\nLogic for Anderson is concerned with statements, and not with\nquestions, commands, prescriptions, exhortations or other forms of\nexpression. Logic is concerned fundamentally with statements that\nraise an \u201cobjective issue\u201d and these other forms of speech\ndo so only indirectly (JAA, Lectures on Scientific\nMethod, c.1950). Discourse implies a common logic of assertion,\nimplication and definition (EMP, 6). Apparent\ndifferences in logical form are due simply to different modes of\nexpression. Any statement, if it is saying anything at all, can be\nshown by transformation into logical form to be asserting some matter\nof fact: a description of a certain thing as being of a certain kind,\na claim that something is the case. Anderson\u2019s students were set\na range of statements to be transformed into one of the four\nAristotelian propositional forms, traditionally designated as the A,\nE, I and O forms. In any field, until questions or issues are posed in\none of these four propositional forms they will inevitably be confused\nand potentially misleading bases for inquiry.\n\n\nA\nAll As are B\n(AaB) \n\nE\nNo As are B\n(AeB) \n\nI\nSome As are B\n(AiB) \n\nO\nSome As are not\nB\n(AoB) \n\n\nSo, from typical examination papers in Andersonian logic:\n\n\u201cMany hands make light work\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003A \u2013 All shared activities are\nlightened\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking\neggs\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003E \u2013 No omelettes are things\nmade without breaking eggs\n\u201cIt is by no means unusual to find adulteration in\nmanufactured products\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003I \u2013 Some manufactured products\nare adultered\n\u201cHis valour is greater than his discretion\u201d\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003O \u2013 Some valourous activities\nof his are not discreet\n\n\nIn Anderson\u2019s view of traditional logic, the universal\nproposition \u201cAll As are B\u201d asserts the\nsimple fact that all As are B; a thing\u2019s being of\na certain sort is the irreducible minimum of a fact or state of\naffairs; there is no assertion of some \u201cgeneral\nconnection\u201d over and above that fact. Nor does the universal\nproposition assert that some class relation holds between A and\nB \u2013 the assertion of a class relation is just a way of\nsaying that certain propositions are true. Nor is it about some\ntotality A: it asserts simply of each and every A that\nit is B. And although it does not directly assert the existence\nof A, it certainly presupposes it. It is indeed the great\nvirtue for Anderson of his version of traditional logic that it fully\nbrings out the existential presuppositions of the proposition. In\naddition, Anderson thinks that what are often taken to be supreme\nlogical truths (for example, identity statements) are not truths at\nall, for they say nothing. There is no analytic truth: if a\nproposition says anything at all, it can be false. Anderson rejects\nthe view that mathematical truths are so only within a calculus, that\nis, derivable from a given set of chosen postulates.\n\nAnderson rejects Mill\u2019s view that universal statements are\ngeneralisations from experience. Universal propositions cannot be\nderived by generalisation from particular experiences, because there\nsimply are no such immediate experiences. Such truths are derived from\nother universal propositions and tested in experience. In discussing\nthe functions of subjects, predicates and the copula in propositions\nand the logical relations between propositions, logic is already\ndiscussing universals, individuals, identity, space-time and\ncausality. And, contra Mill\u2019s inductivism, because we have\ndirect experience of generality and of relations, a single instance is\nsufficient to establish the universal proposition (say, that all glass\nis brittle). Further investigation may challenge such assertions since\nall our beliefs are fallible but wholesale doubt is simply not an\noption. The logical gap between particulars and universals that\ninductive reasoning proposes is a gap that no amount of human\nreasoning could hope to span. Hume was right in this, but instead of\nembracing skepticism he should have concluded as did William James\nthat generality and relations are as much a part of our experience as\nare particulars.\n\nThe validity of the syllogism is fundamental and Anderson rejects the\nabsolute independence from syllogistic reasoning of other forms of\nreasoning such as the relational, hypothetical and disjunctive. The\nsyllogism demonstrates clearly that the subject in one proposition can\nfunction as the predicate in another. The difference between subject\nand predicate is purely one of function: the function of the subject\nterm is to locate, that of the predicate to describe. There are not\ntwo classes of entities involved here; that is, there are no pure\nlocations/particulars/substances, just as there are no pure\ndescriptions/universals. There is no logical gap that needs to be\nspanned between subject and predicate terms: any term can play the\nrole of particular or general, subject or predicate. \n\nFor Anderson logic is the science of the most general features of\nreality. Logic is not simply a useful calculus following on from an\ninitial choice of primitives, and Anderson\u2019s logic is not simply\none version of predicate calculus among others. His view is that logic\ndescribes the general structure of facts and the relations between\nthem. It provides the conditions of possibility for all discourse, but\nit is not about forms of language nor about special status entities\nsuch as universals. It is about the most general features of facts.\nUnderlying this propositional view of reality is the thesis that\nthings within space and time are irreducibly complex. Every situation\nhas both particular and general aspects represented by the subject and\npredicate functions within the proposition. Every predicate can be the\nsubject of a further proposition. The simplest unit is a being there\nand so, a state of affairs in which a particular is characterised in\nsome specific way, but neither the particular nor the universal could\nexist independently. We never arrive at absolutely simple elements in\nany field. The quest for such simples urged by Russell, Moore and the\nearly Wittgenstein indicated a residual rationalist element in their\nthinking. On the other hand, against the idealist opponents of these\nearly realists, Anderson of course insisted that no entities could be\nconstituted, wholly or in part, by their relations\n(EMP, 43). \n\nMackie described Anderson as the last of the Aristotelian logicians\nand observed some awkward consequences for his conception of logic:\nthe problem of false propositions; the absence of a way of\ndealing with singular propositions; an inability to deal with multiple\nquantification; the difficulty in expressing relational propositions\nin subject-predicate and syllogistic form. For Mackie, any logic\ndealing with false propositions, relations of contradiction and\ncontrariety, entertained arguments, falsifications and reductions\nad absurdum must be something more than an account of\npropositions as what is there (Mackie 1985).\n\nAnderson distinguished idealism\u2019s substance-attribute logic that\nhad been condemned by Russell from his own subject-predicate logic.\nNonetheless, his Aristotelian logic of everyday experience did seem to\nsit uneasily with the broader search for logics that could more\nadequately capture forms of reasoning across a wide variety of\ndomains. Ontological logics like Anderson\u2019s came to seem\n\u201cnaively realistic and Aristotelian\u201d, and \u201chard to\nhang on to\u201d in the history of twentieth century philosophy\n(Rorty 1986). It is not just that 20th century philosophy\u2019s\n\u201ccounter-intuitive redescription and relativisation to choice of\nprimitives\u201d (Rorty 1986) ignored Anderson\u2019s insistence\nthat logic is not a calculus. Technical developments in the logic of\nmodal, tense and relational terms proceeded without reference to\nAnderson\u2019s form of onto-logic.\n",
