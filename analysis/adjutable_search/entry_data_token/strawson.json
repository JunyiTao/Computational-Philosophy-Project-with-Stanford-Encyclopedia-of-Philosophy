His writings\nrange over philosophical logic, the philosophy of language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and the history of philosophy.  Across these\ndebates, Strawson aimed to identify the most fundamental concepts\ninvolved in our ordinary ways of thinking. He took these to include\nsuch core concepts as those of body, person, space and time, and\ncausation. Strawson aimed to show both that sceptical challenges to\nour use of such concepts are spurious and unwarranted and also that\nour entitlement to use these concepts does not depend on their being\nreduced to some supposedly more naturalistically acceptable basis,\nsuch as experience as conceived of by the empiricists, or the concepts\ninvolved in fundamental science. According to Strawson, the proper task\nof metaphysics is to describe these indispensable notions and their\ninterconnections. His work was influential in moving Oxford philosophy\naway from the anti-metaphysical work of A.J. Ayer and J.L. Austin\ntowards a re-engagement with many traditional philosophical questions.\nStrawson\u2019s work continues to command attention. \n", "toc": [{"#Life": "1. Life"}, {"#Refe": "2.

Life\n\nPeter Frederick Strawson was born, in London, on November 23, 1919. He\nstudied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at St. John\u2019s\nCollege, Oxford, between 1937 and 1940. His philosophy tutors were\nJ.D. Mabbott, an eminent political philosopher, later to become Master\nof the college, and H. P. Grice, whom Strawson himself described as\n\u2018one of the cleverest and most ingenious thinkers of our\ntime\u2019. (This quotation comes from Strawson\u2019s\n\u2018Intellectual Autobiography\u2019 contained in Hahn 1998.\nStrawson\u2019s account there of his life and thought contains much\nthat is of philosophical interest, and it also reveals much about him\nas a person.) Strawson was then called up for military service and\nbelongs to that generation of British philosophers, including Ayer,\nHampshire, Hare, Hart and Wollheim, who saw service in the Second\nWorld War. His first post after the war was at Bangor, in Wales. After\nwinning the prestigious John Locke Prize in Oxford (a prize awarded on\nthe basis of a written examination to philosophy graduates in Oxford),\nhe received an appointment at University College, Oxford, which made\nhim a Fellow in 1948. Two years later, in 1950, with the publication\nof \u2018On Referring\u2019 in Mind and his debate with\nAustin about truth, he achieved international fame.\n\nHis subsequent life as a philosopher was spent mostly in positions at\nOxford, first as a Fellow at University College, and then, after 1968,\nas Gilbert Ryle\u2019s successor as Wayneflete Professor of\nMetaphysical Philosophy, at Magdalen College. Writing extensively, in\nboth books and articles, about the philosophy of language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and the history of philosophy, he succeeded\nin redirecting Oxford philosophy away from the limitations which had\nto some extent been accepted under the influence of Austin, towards a\nre-engagement with some traditional abstract philosophical issues.\nFrom the early 1950s onwards he established a pre-eminence within\nOxford philosophy, both through his publications and also through his\nquite exceptional critical abilities. Part of the way that\nStrawson\u2019s approach to philosophy contrasted with Austin\u2019s\nis that Strawson was committed to the value of publication, of books\nand articles, whereas Austin seemed content to develop his views and\npromulgate them in lectures and talks. His achievements were\nrecognised by election in 1960 to the British Academy, by the\nreception of a knighthood in 1977 and by many other honours. In 1998\nhe became the twenty-sixth philosopher to have a volume devoted to him\nin the famous Library of Living Philosophers series, adding another\nBritish name to the list of recipients of this honour, previous ones\nbeing Whitehead, Russell, Moore, Broad and Ayer. He was probably the\nmost famous and most discussed British philosopher within the academic\nworld of philosophy from the 1950s until the late 1980s. His status is\nevidenced by the fact that his writings attracted the attention of,\nand were discussed by, the world\u2019s leading philosophers,\nincluding, Russell, Sellars, Putnam, Quine, Davidson, and Kripke.\n\nStrawson was married and had four children. He was a highly cultured\nman, with a passion for literature, especially poetry, large amounts\nof which he could recite and which he also wrote. In conversation,\nmanners and appearance, the overwhelming impression was of elegance\nand effortless intelligence.\n\nStrawson retired in 1987, but remained philosophically active until\nhis death in Oxford on February 13, 2006.\n2. Reference\n\nStrawson published \u2018On Referring\u2019 in 1950. (Like Frege,\nRussell and, later, Kripke and Evans, Strawson made his name by\nwriting about reference.) He subsequently modified and developed his\nviews on reference, but the central claim of \u2018On\nReferring\u2019 is something he always defended. Strawson\u2019s\ntitle contains, of course, an allusion to Russell\u2019s famous\narticle \u2018On Denoting\u2019, the central idea of which Strawson\nis criticising. Strawson\u2019s conception of the debate is that\nRussell offered his theory of descriptions as a complete account of\nthe role of definite descriptions in English (such expressions as\n\u2018the queen of England\u2019), whereas the truth is that the\nrole of the word \u2018the\u2019 when embedded in definite\ndescriptions cannot be captured in a single account. There are uses\nwhich do not fit Russell\u2019s theory because the phenomenon is\nsimply more complex than Russell allowed. It is not, therefore, that\nStrawson is offering his own complete theory; it is, rather, that he\nis picking out uses for which, according to him, Russell\u2019s\ntheory fails, and characterising them. Russell\u2019s theory had\nachieved the status of orthodoxy at the time that Strawson launched\nhis attack on it. That this is the way to understand Strawson\u2019s\ncontribution to the debate has the important consequence that it is no\nobjection to his approach to point to uses of \u2018the\u2019 about\nwhich, arguably, Russell (or something close to Russell\u2019s view)\nmight be correct. Such points do not touch Strawson\u2019s central\nclaim. This undermines a number of responses to Strawson.\nStrawson\u2019s paper initiated a debate about definite descriptions\nthat has run ever since its publication, and in which his views have\nremained central.\n\nRussell claimed that a sentence of the form \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 says; \u2018There is one and only one F\nand it is G.\u2019 The difference from \u2018An F\nis G\u2019 is that the latter merely claims that there is\na (G) F, whereas the use of the definite\narticle imports the extra claim of uniqueness. Both are alike in\nmaking an existential claim about Fs, namely, there is an\nF, and hence, according to Russell, at least part of the role\nof \u2018the\u2019 is to be (or to introduce) what is called an\nexistential quantifier. This, in a crude presentation, is\nRussell\u2019s Theory of Definite Descriptions. Against this Strawson\nargued, first, that it is unsupported. He claimed that Russell\u2019s\nmain support for his theory is that a sentence such as \u2018The king\nof France is bald\u2019 remains meaningful even though there is no\nking of France. Its having meaning cannot, therefore, depend on there\nbeing a referent for the apparent subject expression. According to\nStrawson, Russell infers from that to the conclusion that the semantic\nrole of the apparent subject expression in such sentences (i.e.\n\u2018the F\u2019) cannot be to refer to or designate an\nobject, and must, rather, function as a quantifier. Against this,\nStrawson suggested that the meaningfulness of \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 should be thought of as, roughly, there being rules\nas to what a use of the sentence in different circumstances will\namount to. If the circumstances are right, then it can be used in a\nreferring way; if not, then the use might not succeed in being an act\nof reference. Strawson\u2019s distinction between a sentence\u2019s\nhaving a meaning and the speech act performed by its use on an\noccasion is clearly sound and important. One question that was debated\nis whether all of Russell\u2019s reasons for his theory are disarmed\nby the introduction of this distinction.\n\nHowever, against the Russellian theory itself Strawson made the\nimportant point that the theory implies that a sentence of the form\n\u2018The F is G\u2019 must count as false when\nused in circumstances where there is no F. (These cases are\noften described as ones involving \u2018reference failure\u2019). It\nmust do so because, according to the theory, part of the role of\n\u2018The F\u2019 (at least in such declarative sentences)\nis to say that there is an F. Contrary to this, Strawson\nclaims that we would not always regard a saying of \u2018The\nF is G\u2019 as false in such circumstances. We\nwould not react by saying \u2018That is false\u2019 but would rather\nsay something like \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 or \u2018You must\nbe under a misapprehension\u2019. He suggests that in such\ncircumstances the use amounts neither to saying something true nor to\nsaying something false. It exhibits what came to be called a\n\u2018truth-value gap\u2019. In subsequent discussion it became\nclear that it is difficult to determine what we should say about the\ntruth value of sentences involving referential failure.\nStrawson\u2019s main objection to Russell\u2019s account is, though,\nthat it is simply obvious that sometimes we use \u2018The\nF\u2019 to refer to or pick out an object, and we do not\nthen use it to say that there is an F.\n\nStrawson\u2019s attitude is well presented in a later important paper\nwhere he says:\n\nThe distinction between identifying reference and uniquely existential\nassertion is something quite undeniable. The sense in which the\nexistence of something answering to a definite description used for\nthe purpose of identifying reference, and its distinguishability by an\naudience from anything else, is presupposed and not asserted in an\nutterance containing such an expression, so used, stands absolutely\nfirm, whether or not one opts for the view that radical failure of the\npresupposition would deprive the statement of a truth-value. It\nremains a decisive objection to the theory of Descriptions \u2026\nthat \u2026 it amounts to a denial of these undeniable distinctions.\n(Strawson 1964, 85)\n\n\nThis passage reveals four important aspects of Strawson\u2019s\napproach to definite descriptions.\n\nThe first is that his fundamental objection to Russell is that it is\nsimply obvious to him as a sensitive and self-reflective user of\nlanguage that the use of the word \u2018the\u2019 does not conform\nto the theory. Whatever puzzles there may be about language and\nreference their solution cannot require us to deny such obvious facts.\nIt is a recurring theme in, or perhaps a recurring part of the method\nof, Strawson\u2019s philosophical discussion of language that some\naspects of language are more or less obvious to us. Second, the\ncontrast that strikes Strawson as especially obvious is that between\nsaying that there is (one and only one) F and\nemploying, in certain contexts, the definite description \u2018The\nF\u2019. If, standing in front of our familiar car, I say to\nmy family, \u2018The car will not start\u2019, I am hardly telling\nthem that we have, or there is, a certain car. Why should I engage in\na communicative act of that sort? It is the importance of this\ncontrast that impressed Strawson, as opposed to the problem often now\nraised against Russell\u2019s theory, that the uniqueness commitment\nseems equally problematic. Strawson notes the issue about uniqueness\nbut attends most to the assertion of existence problem. This reading\nof the nature of Strawson\u2019s main objection to Russell implies\nthat a crucial question is whether it is indeed an implication of\nRussell\u2019s analysis that the person employing the description\n\u2018The F\u2019 (in normal discourse) says that\nthere is one (and only one) F. If that is not an implication\nof Russell\u2019s analysis then Strawson\u2019s main objection\nlapses. It might also be asked whether any analysis of descriptions in\nterms of quantifiers, even if developed in a more sophisticated way,\nmust have such a problematic implication.\n\nThird, one central concept in Strawson\u2019s developed description\nof the role of such an expression as \u2018The F\u2019 is\nthat it can be a device for what he calls identifying reference.\nRoughly, Strawson\u2019s idea is that the definite description is\nsometimes chosen to enable the audience to fix on or pick out as the\nsubject matter of the claim an item of which they already know. In\nthis role it cannot be that \u2018the F\u2019 tells them of\nthe existence of such an F, since its role rests on the prior\nexistence of such knowledge. Strawson provides a detailed analysis of\nthis function in the first chapter of Individuals, as well as\nin the article from which the above quotation comes. Finally, a notion\nthat Strawson introduced in his own description of the nature of\ndefinite descriptions and which surfaces in the quotation is that of\npresupposition. Strawson said that the use of a definite\ndescription standardly presupposes the existence of an object fitting\nthe description even though it does not say, nor therefore entail,\nthat there is such an object. This concept met with resistance amongst\nphilosophers but has had a colossal influence on linguists, who have\ntended to see it as a useful concept in the description of language\n(see Huang 2007, ch. 7). This encourages us to ask whether it is more\nlikely that linguists or philosophers have the better insight into\nlanguage.\n3. Truth\n\nThe other very important debate that Strawson was involved in the\nearly 1950s was that with Austin about truth. Viewed in terms of the\npolitics of Oxford philosophy at that time, the debate perhaps\nrepresents a power struggle between Austin, the hitherto acknowledged\nleader, and Strawson, the younger challenger. Philosophically,\nStrawson took exception to Austin\u2019s attempt (in Austin 1950) to\nformulate a reconstructed version of the correspondence theory of\ntruth. Austin\u2019s account of truth is complex, but, roughly, he\nheld that in saying that a statement is true one is saying that the\nstate of affairs which a particular kind of linguistic convention,\nwhich he called the referential conventions, ensure are picked out by\nthe use of the original sentence in the given circumstances, satisfy\nthe conditions which another sort of convention \u2014 called the\ndescriptive conventions \u2014 target the rest of the sentence onto.\nAustin\u2019s idea can be illustrated with an example. The sentence\n\u2018The television is broken\u2019 is governed by certain\nreferential conventions which target it onto some state of affairs in\nthe world involving a particular television set; there are also\ncertain descriptive conventions built into the sentence linking it to\na type of state of affairs (the containing-a-broken-television type);\nthe former state of affairs conforms to, or falls under, the\ndescriptively correlated type. Strawson\u2019s criticism principally\nalleges that Austin has no clear conception of what the supposed\nreferential conventions link sentences with. Is it objects \u2014\nsay, the television? If so, then that is not a state of affairs, and\ncertainly not a fact.\n\nStrawson also argues that facts and states of affairs should not be\nregarded as things in the world. He suggests that we employ such nouns\nas \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018state of affairs\u2019 as\nnon-referential devices for expressing claims. Thus, I can say\n\u2018It is a fact that P\u2019 instead of simply saying\n\u2018P\u2019, but the former remark in no way introduces\nan entity beyond anything introduced in the second claim. (This might\nbe labelled a redundancy theory of facts.) Having queried the\nontology of Austin\u2019s account, Strawson, somewhat surprisingly\nseems prepared to allow that the conditions that Austin\u2019s\naccount incorporates are, in effect, correlated with the\ntruth of the sentence in question, but, he says, the fulfilment of\nthese conditions is not what we are claiming to obtain when\nwe say that it is true. It is simply obvious that remarks about truth\nare not remarks about linguistic conventions. This criticism\nseems to have a similar status to the central criticism of Russell.\nStrawson\u2019s point against Austin is that it is simply obvious\nthat the theory cannot be correct because it is obvious to us as\nlanguage users that when we speak of truth we are not talking about\nsuch things as referential (and descriptive) linguistic conventions.\nFinally, Strawson pointed out that Austin\u2019s account could only\napply to a limited range of statements. If I say \u2018There are no\nunicorns\u2019 what are the referential targets of my\nremark?\n\nStrawson\u2019s criticisms were taken by most people to have fatally\nwounded Austin\u2019s theory. The subsequent discussion occasioned by\ntheir debate primarily concerned some issues about the degree to which\nStrawson\u2019s criticisms as a whole were fair to Austin, and also\nwhether the approach to truth that Strawson himself favoured was\nadequate. Strawson\u2019s account, rather than Austin\u2019s, became\nthe focus of debate. Strawson himself returned to the former question\nin later articles, arguing persuasively that even on the most\ncharitable interpretation Austin\u2019s idea of two sorts of\nconventions cannot be made sense of. Strawson himself favoured a view\nwhich took as the central insight about truth (one deriving from F. P.\nRamsey) that to say that P is true is equivalent to saying that P.\nStrawson\u2019s own main contribution to working out this idea was to\nstress the linguistic acts that the word \u2018true\u2019 enables us\nto perform. This left him free to point out that even if\nRamsey\u2019s equivalence is the fundamental core of the notion of\ntruth, it would not follow that the expression \u2018true\u2019 is a\nredundant expression. The presence in our language of the term\n\u2018true\u2019 might be of great\u2014indeed,\nindispensable\u2014utility.\n\nG. J. Warnock (in Warnock 1964) thought he discerned a problem in\nStrawson\u2019s account because the theory might not allow that in\nsaying that a certain remark is true a speaker is saying something\nabout that remark, which Warnock thought a desirable element in an\naccount of truth. Rather, Warnock felt that according to Strawson the\nspeaker is simply saying the same as the original remark. In his\nresponse Strawson pointed out that it is possible to incorporate\nreference to the statement in the analysis he gave of truth\nascriptions. Thus, the claim \u2018John\u2019s statement that\nP is true\u2019 can be treated as equivalent to (say)\n\u2018P, as John\u2019s statement said\u2019. This is\ningenious, but it leaves one aspect of Strawson\u2019s view\nunexplained, and it may have been this aspect that Warnock was trying\nto home in on. Strawson stressed that it is statements that are truth\nbearers. If, however, truth should not be thought of as a property of\nanything, then what is the point of carefully identifying the things\nthat are its bearers? (On some of these issues, see Searle 1998.)\n4. Logical Theory\n\nStrawson published his first book An Introduction to Logical\nTheory in 1952. In it he attempts to explain the nature, and the\nscope and limits, of formal logic. The eminence he had already\nachieved was reflected in the fact that it received a review by Quine\nin Mind. Strawson\u2019s aim, generated in part by his\nreflections on the correct treatment of definite descriptions, is to\nsay what formal logic is by explaining and elucidating its central\nconcepts, among them the notion of entailment. Strawson favours\nexplaining \u2018P entails Q\u2019 as\n\u2018\u2018P and not Q\u2019 is\nself-contradictory\u2019, and explains or elucidates the notion of\nself-contradiction in terms of sentences saying nothing; in effect,\nthey give and then take back simultaneously. Strawson then looks at\nthe notion of form and of proof systems. He applies his ideas to\ntraditional syllogistic logic as well as to modern propositional and\npredicate logic. It can be wondered how far his elucidation of the\ncentral notions is adequate, and it can also be wondered whether he\nattends to all the notions that need explanation in relation to formal\nlogic (e.g., consistency and completeness). The main part of his book\ndoes not seem to have had a large influence on philosophers or\nlogicians. However, three elements in his discussion had and continue\nto have considerable influence. First, he gave a fuller explanation of\nthe notion of presupposition than he had previously provided. Second,\nStrawson asked how far the meaning of ordinary language connectives,\nsuch as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018if \u2026\nthen\u2026\u2019, can be equated with those of the truth functional\nconnectives, such as \u2018&\u2019, \u2018\u2228\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2192\u2019, that logicians employ. Strawson argued that\nthere are significant differences. His conclusion is that these\nordinary expressions do not have what might be called a precise logic.\nThe question that Strawson asked has continued to be central in the\nphilosophy of language and has not been resolved. Grice took an\nopposite view to Strawson and part of the point of Grice\u2019s\naccount of implication, as opposed to meaning or saying, was to\ngenerate an explanation for the data that Strawson appealed to in\narguing for a semantic difference between ordinary language and formal\nlogic, without having to postulate a semantic difference. Strawson\nhimself later criticised Grice\u2019s theory, at least in relation to\nconditionals. Third, he proposed an approach to the problem of\ninduction. We shall describe that later when looking at\nStrawson\u2019s contribution to epistemology.\n5. Individuals\n\nIn 1959 Strawson published his second book Individuals. It is\nambitious, abstract, wide ranging and original, and it has continued\nto be read and discussed, especially the first half. Strawson coined\nthe terms \u2018descriptive metaphysics\u2019 to capture his task\nand opposed that to what he called \u2018revisionary\nmetaphysics\u2019. By using \u2018metaphysics\u2019 Strawson was\nprimarily emphasising the abstractness and generality of his\nquestions. A consequence of this generality, Strawson suggests, is\nthat the methods needed for settling them are different in kind from\nthose employed in debating less abstract conceptual or philosophical\nquestions. One such method, employed in chapter 2, when exploring the\nsound world, involves imagining creatures with quite different\nexperiences from our own, and trying to determine their capacities for\nthinking about objects. By calling it \u2018descriptive\u2019\nStrawson means, in part, that he is not recommending revisions or\nadditions to how we think. But the term also signals Strawson\u2019s\nconviction that there is a shared and universal conceptual scheme\nwhich we human beings have, and know that we have, and for which no\njustification in terms of more fundamental concepts or claims can be\ngiven. He writes:\n\n[T]here is a massive central core of human thinking which has no\nhistory\u2014or none recorded in histories of human thought; there\nare categories and concepts which, in their most fundamental\ncharacter, change not at all. Obviously these are not the specialities\nof the most refined thinking. They are the commonplaces of the least\nrefined thinking; and yet are the indispensable core of the conceptual\nequipment of the most sophisticated human beings. (Strawson 1959, 10)\n\n\nThe claim that there are a shared set of concepts which are at the\nindispensable core of human thinking is a recognisably Kantian thesis.\n(We say more about Strawson\u2019s relation to Kant below.)\nDescriptive metaphysics aims to describe and analyse this universal\nconceptual scheme. In particular, Strawson aims to focus on\none part of that total structure, namely our ability to\ndirect our thoughts, and speech, onto items in the world. It is\npossible therefore to see Individuals as, in part, a\ndevelopment of Strawson\u2019s interest in reference.\n\nIndividuals is very much a book of two halves. In the first\nfour chapters Strawson\u2019s focus is on our ability to refer to and\nthink about items in our environment, including ourselves. In the\nsecond part, again of four chapters, the aim is to elucidate the\ndistinction between subject expressions and predicate expressions.\nThis latter task belongs more to philosophical logic or the philosophy\nof language than to metaphysics, but the link is, according to\nStrawson, that the central cases of subject expressions are those\npicking out the entities to which we basically refer, the character of\nwhich it has been the task of the first half to determine. Since, in\nfact, the book\u2019s colossal and immediate impact was due primarily\nto the brilliance and originality of its first three chapters, we\nshall describe them in somewhat more detail than the rest of the book.\nThe truth is that reading the argument developed in those chapters\ngenerates a continuous intellectual excitement, which the later\nchapters do not quite match. It is also true that issues to do with\nthe subject-predicate distinction appeal to fewer people than do the\nissues focused on in the early part.\n\nChapter 1 focuses on the question of whether there is a category of\nentities which we can think about without depending on thought about\nentities of other categories. The focus initially is not so much on\nthought as on linguistically referring to something when in\nconversation with an audience, and Strawson clarifies the relevant\nidea of talking about an item by invoking the notion of identifying\nreference which emerged in his theory of reference. Strawson proposes\nthe following model of latching onto an identifying reference. One\ncase is where the referent is picked out as a currently perceived item\n\u2013 say, this page. In such a case the audience succeeds\nwhen they pick out the same item in their own field of experience. The\nother is where it is picked out as falling under a description.\nStrawson\u2019s idea is that ultimately such descriptions need to\nrelate the item in some way to currently perceived items \u2013 say,\nas the author of this page \u2013 for otherwise the\npossibility of reduplication would prevent us from picking out a\nunique item. (Such a two\u2013fold structure of thought was also\naccepted by Russell, but arguments in the theory of perception\npersuaded him that the perceived scene was private rather than, as\nStrawson holds, public.)\n\nHow should we think of these descriptive relations? Strawson claims in\nchapter 1 that these descriptive relations are fundamentally\nspatio-temporal. That is, my ability to think of James I rests on\nthinking of him as the person ascending the throne in 1603, the\npresent time being 2018. Ultimately I fix on him via his place in a\nspatio-temporal framework which is centred on my currently perceived\nenvironment. Strawson further points out that since we need to update\nthis relational framework over time as we move around, we need to be\nable to re-identify objects and places encountered at different times.\nStrawson draws an epistemological conclusion from this. Since our\nability to maintain a grasp on the spatio-temporal framework depends\non acceptance of such identifications it is incoherent to be sceptical\nabout the procedures we rely on to confirm them while still thinking\nin terms of the spatio-temporal framework itself. With these\nconclusions in place, Strawson returns to his fundamental question as\nto whether there is a basic category of items of reference. Some forms\nof reference seem parasitic on other forms of reference: reference to\ntheoretical entities is dependent on reference to material\nparticulars; reference to experiences, such as Mary\u2019s pain in\nher leg, are dependent on references to their subjects.\nStrawson\u2019s assumption seems to be that putting these two\ncategories to one side leaves us with two candidates for the basic\nitems of reference: material bodies (in a broad sense) and\noccurrences. Occurrences, however, cannot be basic since they too are\nstandardly picked out dependently \u2013 e.g., the fire in that\nhouse \u2013 and, moreover, according to Strawson, they do not\nform a structured framework allowing the spatio-temporal framework to\nbe grounded. Thus Strawson\u2019s conclusion: bodies (in a fairly\ninclusive sense) are referentially basic.\n\nStrawson next asks, in chapter 2, whether it is possible that there\nshould be a conceptual scheme that acknowledges the existence of\nobjective particulars but in which material bodies are not the basic\nparticulars. Since, according to the initial argument, referential\nthought rests on a spatio-temporal framework only if it rests on\nthought about bodies, this question becomes: can there be thought\nabout objective entities which doesn\u2019t involve thinking of them\nin spatial terms? To investigate this question, Strawson considers\nwhether the notion of an objective particular would be comprehensible\nto a creature with only auditory experience, the assumption being that\nauditory experience on its own is non-spatial and thus that a creature\nin such a situation wouldn\u2019t have access to spatial ways of\nthinking. What objective notions would be available to such a\ncreature? Strawson imaginatively enters into the sound world to see\nhow far ideas analogous to those that space makes available can be\nfound. The best option relies on relating individual sounds to a\ncontinuous \u2018master sound\u2019 which, as it were, defines\nsomething analogous to space. Strawson himself appears to think this\nmight work. His view thus seems to be that although spatio-temporal\nthinking rests on bodies, objective thinking cannot be shown to\nrequire spatio-temporal thinking per se, but even in cases where there\ncan be objective thought without spatio-temporal thinking, there must\nbe something in in the subject\u2019s way of thinking which performs\na role analogous to the role that thought about space performs for us.\nStrawson\u2019s argument was influentially discussed by Gareth Evans\nin \u2018Things Without the Mind\u2019 (1980), a commentary on\nchapter 2 of Individuals; further commentary can be found in\nSnowdon 2006 and Cassam 2005.\n\nIn the next chapter, entitled \u2018Persons\u2019, Strawson leaves\nbehind speculation about concepts based on attenuated experiences, and\nfocuses on our rich thought about ourselves. His argument involves a\ncomparison between three conceptions of such thought. The first is\nwhat he calls the no-ownership view. This is the view that we do not\nreally refer to ourselves when we use the first-person pronoun, even\nthough we seem to. There is nothing that owns or has the experiences\nto which to refer. Strawson\u2019s response is to argue that once\nthis view is developed, genuine self-reference emerges as involved in\nthe theory\u2019s explanation of the illusion of ownership of\nexperiences. One question for this response is whether it is a\ndecisive objection to the no-ownership theory that an incoherence\nemerges in its standard explanation as to why we tend to believe that\nour experiences are owned. Why must the no-ownership view supply such\nan explanation? The second conception is that deriving from Descartes,\naccording to which, the item that \u2018I\u2019 picks out is\nsomething distinct from the physical body. Strawson argues that this\nconception is incompatible with the principle that one can ascribe\nexperiences to oneself only if one is prepared to ascribe them to\nothers. This is because a subject can meet this requirement only if\nthey are able to pick out other subjects, and, Strawson holds, one\ncannot pick out non-spatial subjects. Strawson concludes that when we\nself-refer we refer to an entity which has two sides or aspects, the\nphysical and the mental, and not to a thing which possesses only the\nmental sort of feature, something else having the physical features.\nIn effect, Strawson is representing ordinary thought as having the\nstructure of what others have called a dual-aspect theory. Persons are\nthings with two aspects \u2013 bodily and mental. He famously\ndescribes this as the idea that the concept of a person is a\nprimitive concept. Second, since we can self-ascribe we must\nbe able to other-ascribe, and that means that our methods for doing so\nmust be adequate. As Strawson puts it, the criteria we employ for\npsychological ascription to others must be \u2018logically\nadequate\u2019. There cannot, therefore, be a genuine\nproblem of other minds. Again, as in the first chapter, Strawson\nderives a significant epistemological consequence from his conceptual\ninvestigations. This famous chapter has exercised a fascination on\nphilosophers thinking about ourselves and has been, perhaps, as much\ndiscussed as any piece of philosophical argument that Strawson wrote.\n(For interesting discussion of this chapter see Ayer 1963, Martin\n1969, and Snowdon 2009.)\n\nFinally, Strawson takes Leibniz as an opponent of some of his\nmajor theses and considers whether Leibniz might be able to avoid his\nconclusions. He argues, displaying considerable ingenuity in\nsuggesting different interpretations of Leibniz, that Leibniz does not\nescape the problems.\n\nIndividuals then shifts focus to the subject-predicate\ndistinction. Strawson\u2019s initial aim is, in effect, to show that\na novel theory is required. There are two reasons. First, we lack a\nproper explanation as to why absolutely anything can be the reference\nof a subject expression but only universals can be what predicates\nexpress. Second, he classifies the different accounts on offer and\nargues that they are either open to objection, or open to the demand\nfor further explanation. The contrast between subjects and predicates\nthat Strawson himself proposes for the central cases is that\nunderstanding a subject expression depends on the possession of\nempirical information, whereas the understanding of predicates does\nnot. For example, to understand the name \u2018James I\u2019 I need\nto know something like; there was a king who ascended the throne in\n1603. But to understand the predicate \u2018\u2026 is\ntriangular\u2019, there is no empirical information about the world\nthat I need to grasp. There need not be, or have been, any triangles\nat all. I have, rather, to grasp the principle of classification\nlinked to the term. Strawson\u2019s proposal is ingenious, but faces\na number of questions. First, is it clear that all predicates express\nprinciples of classification the grasp of which involves no empirical\nknowledge? Consider such natural kind involving predicates as\n\u2018is gold\u2019 or \u2018is a dog\u2019. Second, is it obvious\nthat understanding subject expressions requires accepting the\nempirical claims, as opposed to merely knowing what the assumptions\nare? Third, what entitles Strawson to attach a priority within his\naccount to empirical claims? Why is non-empirical discourse, such as\nmathematics, to be regarded as secondary? Strawson then attempts to\nexplain some other elucidations of the subject-predicate distinction\nas deriving from his own suggestion, and to develop a more general\ncriterion on the basis of his own account having captured the core\ncases. In the next chapter Strawson asks the very interesting and\nnovel question whether, just as the employment of (the core type of)\nsubject expressions presupposes empirical information, there is a type\nof proposition the truth of which is presupposed by subject-predicate\npropositions in general. He picks out what he calls\nfeature-placing sentences, such as \u2018It is\nraining\u2019. Such a sentence does not designate an object and\ndescribe it, rather the sentence affirms the presence of a feature.\nStrawson argues that where there are true subject-predicate\npropositions there must also be true feature-placing sentences. That\nis his answer to the question.\n\nIndividuals is far richer in argument than we have been able\nto convey. It occasioned, more or less immediately, considerable\ndebate, and has continued to do so ever since. The epistemological\nconclusions that Strawson advanced, both about bodies and about other\nminds, were closely scrutinized. The overall arguments of the chapter\non persons and the chapter on bodies were closely analysed. The\ncontrast between descriptive and revisionary metaphysics, although\nbriefly presented by Strawson, entered into the folk taxonomy of\nphilosophy. As well as occasioning disagreement, Strawson\u2019s book\nstimulated, over time, a series of books all of which could be\ndescribed as essays in descriptive metaphysics with a similar focus\nto, though not with identical conclusions to, Individuals.\nThese include Gareth Evans\u2019 The Varieties of Reference,\nJohn Campbell\u2019s Past, Space and Self, and David\nWiggins, Sameness and Substance. (For a good general critical\ndiscussion of Individuals see Williams 1961.)\n6. The Bounds of Sense\n\nIn 1966, seven years after the publication of Individuals\nStrawson published his third book, The Bounds of Sense,\nsubtitled An essay on Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason.\n\nStrawson\u2019s introduction to Kant arose out of the historical\npeculiarities of Oxford\u2019s degree in Philosophy, Politics and\nEconomics. At that time, the degree was structured such that there\nwere two special subjects which those who wished to specialise in\nphilosophy were obliged to take: Logic and Kant, the latter to be\nstudied through the Critique of Pure Reason and the\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. In the Critique\nof Pure Reason, Strawson found \u2018a depth, a range, a\nboldness, and a power unlike anything I had previously\nencountered\u2019 (Strawson 2003, 8).\n\nStrawson lacks sympathy with Kant\u2019s description of his task as\nthe explanation of the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements.\nHis approach to the first Critique is instead captured by his\ncharacteristically elegant title which contains a three-fold pun.\nFirst, it is an echo of a title that Kant considered for the\nCritique. Second and third, it plays on the ambiguity of the\nword \u2018sense\u2019 which can denote both sense-experience and\nsense-meaning. According to Strawson, Kant sets a lower limit on\nsense, arguing that \u2018a certain minimal structure is essential to\nany conception of experience which we can make truly intelligible to\nourselves\u2019 (1966, 11). And he sets an upper limit on sense,\nholding \u2018that the attempt to extend beyond the limits of\nexperience the use of structural concepts, or of any other concepts,\nleads only to claims empty of meaning\u2019. Finally, he does all of\nthis from \u2018a point outside [the bounds of sense], a point which,\nif they are rightly drawn, cannot exist\u2019 (1966, 12). This point\noutside the bounds of sense is Kant\u2019s metaphysics of\ntranscendental idealism and the \u2018imaginary subject of\ntranscendental psychology\u2019 (1966, 32). Strawson\u2019s analytic\nproject is to extract what is valuable of the first two strands from\nthe supposed incoherence of the last.\n\nWith regards to the lower limit of sense and the constructive part of\nthe first Critique, Strawson examines Kant\u2019s argument\nthat our experience must be of recognisably independent objective\nitems, which are spatial and temporal, and which must satisfy some\nstrong principles of permanence and causation. Strawson argues, with\nboth care and brilliance, that Kant\u2019s arguments are defective in\nvarious ways, but that somewhat weaker, yet nonetheless important,\nconclusions along similar lines can be defended. The most fecund and\nbrilliant part of Strawson\u2019s argument, and the part which has\ncorrespondingly attracted the most attention, is Strawson\u2019s take\non Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, in which\nStrawson argues that \u2018for a series of diverse experiences to\nbelong to a single consciousness it is necessary that they should be\nso connected as to constitute a temporally extended experience of a\nunified objective world\u2019 (1966, 97). That is, the experience of\na self-conscious creature must involve, and be recognised as\ninvolving, perception of objects. Strawson\u2019s reconstruction of\nthe argument relies on the idea that the experiences of a\nself-conscious creature must provide room for the thought of\nexperience itself. But one can apply that notion only in the context\nof the application of categories of things which are not experiences.\nHowever, such categories can be available to a subject only if its\nexperiences provide it with the grounds for applying them, which\ninvolves the idea that its experiences relate it to non-experiences,\nthat is to say, independent things. This argument is discussed in\nRorty 1970, Harrison 1970, and Gomes 2016.\n\nWith regards to the upper limit to sense and the destructive part of\nthe first Critique, Strawson examines Kant\u2019s arguments\nin the Dialectic, and develops further requirements on our conception\nof experience analogous to those Kant advances. The discussion of the\nParalogisms is particularly important for Strawson, containing, as he\nsees it, a deep insight about the failures of Cartesian dualism. Kant\ndoesn\u2019t combine, according to Strawson, this recognition of the\nfailures of dualism with a correspondingly accurate account of\nourselves, but this failure is to be explained by Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism, and once shorn of this theory, Kant\u2019s\nview is able to be supplemented with a plausible and realistic account\nof ourselves.\n\nFinally, Strawson considers Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, and\nthough he is ultimately unsympathetic, he explores its interpretation\nwith great care and considers why Kant might have adopted it. One\nissue which he presses is whether there is a coherent way to fit\nourselves as objects into a framework of transcendental idealism,\ngiven Kant\u2019s seeming view that real objects, things in\nthemselves, are unknowable and beyond our experience. The rejection of\ntranscendental idealism requires Strawson to scrutinize Kant\u2019s\narguments for it, and he very carefully and sympathetically analyses\nand rejects Kant\u2019s arguments about space and time, and geometry,\nand also the argument, presented in the Antinomies, that\ntranscendental realism generates contradictions. Strawson further\nabandons much of Kant\u2019s talk of mechanisms of synthesis in the\ngeneration of proper experience. Much of Strawson\u2019s discussion\nhere relies on his particular interpretation of transcendental\nidealism, which has been heavily criticised, for instance in Matthews\n1969.\n\nThe Bounds of Sense had an immediate impact and continues to\nbe extremely influential. Its interpretation of Kant quickly became a\ntarget of discussion in Kant scholarship, and Strawson returned to\nsome issues of Kant interpretation in four essays which are collected\nin Strawson 1997. But it also, as Putnam remarks, \u2018opened the\nway to a reception of Kant\u2019s philosophy by analytic\nphilosophers\u2019 (Putnam 1998 in Hahn 1998, 273). One particular\nfocus has been on Strawson\u2019s use of a style of argument which he\ntook Kant himself to have developed. These arguments have come to be\ncalled \u2018transcendental arguments\u2019. In Individuals\nand The Bounds of Sense they take the form of uncovering\ndependencies in our ways of thinking of the world. These dependencies\ncan be taken to have anti-sceptical implications if claims about which\nthe sceptic is sceptical can be shown to be required for the\njudgements which the sceptic makes, or ones which are involved in the\nsceptic\u2019s own understanding of their view. In the years\nfollowing its publication this anti-sceptical response was closely\ninvestigated, a large literature on it was generated, including\nnotably a number of powerful contributions by the American philosopher\nBarry Stroud. (See Stroud 1968 and 2000.) One problem is that it is\nextraordinarily difficult to show that there are the conceptual\ndependencies which such transcendental arguments rely on.\nInterestingly, Strawson himself soon devised a different response to\nscepticism, but it is also true that the anti-sceptical approach that\nStrawson developed here remains appealing to a range of\nepistemologists, and this debate continues. Some discussion of the\nprospects for such arguments can be found in Stern 1999 and Gomes\n2017a.\n\nSome issues that have been raised about The Bounds of Sense\nare the following: (1) Does Strawson himself provide a satisfactory\nidentification of a good question that Kant\u2019s Critique\ncan be regarded as trying to answer? At about the same time that\nStrawson published his book on Kant, Jonathan Bennett, in his book\nKant\u2019s Analytic suggested that Kant\u2019s claims have\nto be regarded as unobviously analytic if they are to be correct. Is\nStrawson\u2019s conception better than this? (2) Is Strawson\u2019s\ninterpretation of Kant \u2013 especially his account of\ntranscendental idealism \u2013 correct? (3) Does Strawson\u2019s\nversion of Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction of the Categories\nfare any better than Kant\u2019s own? (4) Is Strawson right to think\nthat there are insights in Kant\u2019s project that can be separated\nfrom his transcendental idealism? And (5) does Strawson defend the\nanti-sceptical transcendental arguments cogently? Strawson\u2019s\nrelation to Kant is discussed in Glock 2003, Gomes 2017b, and the\npapers collected in a special issue of the European Journal of\nPhilosophy (2016) marking the 50th anniversary of The Bounds\nof Sense.\n7. Later Books\n\nStrawson published three more books (other than collections of essays)\nin English (plus another in French which overlaps with one of those in\nEnglish). In 1974 Subject and Predicate in Logic and Grammar\nappeared. Strawson himself described this book as \u2018probably the\nmost ambitious and certainly the one that has received the least\nattention\u2019 (Strawson 2004, ix). He is right about the second\npoint but not, we suspect, about the first. It is an ambitious book,\nbut can hardly be ranked above either Individuals or The\nBounds of Sense in that respect! In the first part of it Strawson\npresents a revised version of his account of the normal\nsubject-predicate distinction, and also presents a partial theory of\none particular case of subject expressions, namely proper names. In\nthis he was responding to the emergence of direct referential accounts\nof the kind that Kripke had made popular. The discussion of the\nsubject-predicate distinction is clearer and more direct than the one\nachieved in Individuals. What Strawson particularly brings\nout is that in ordinary language predicates have a complex role,\ninvolving the indication of universals, the expression of\nexemplification, plus expression also of temporal aspects. This\nfunctional complexity explains the correctness of certain other\naccounts of the distinction. No consensus about the assessment of\nStrawson\u2019s proposal has emerged, the reason being that there has\nstill been no very general interest in the subject-predicate\ndistinction. In the second part, Strawson develops an approach to the\nunderstanding of grammar in which he attempts to relate grammar, in\nthe sense of syntax, to much more basic functional specifications of\nthe elements of a language, such that it becomes possible to see\nactual grammars as different ways to achieve these functional roles.\nAgain, no consensus has emerged about this highly original way to\nthink about grammar.\n\nIn 1985 Strawson published Skepticism and Naturalism: Some\nVarieties. The book grew out of Strawson\u2019s Woodbridge\nLectures at Columbia University in 1983. It is, in a sense, a book of\nphilosophy about philosophy. In each chapter Strawson focuses\non a philosophical dispute in which there is a strong tendency to deny\nthe reality or existence of an aspect which common sense affirms. The\nterm \u2018skepticism\u2019 in the title stands for this general\nsceptical tendency. The first chapter concerns knowledge itself,\ndenied by the philosophical sceptic. The later chapters consider the\ndenial of certain aspects of ordinary human thought and experience,\nsuch as the reality of colour by scientifically inspired philosophers,\nand the reality of thought and experience by a certain sort of\nmaterialist. The thread linking these chapters is the sceptical\nthought that these aspects of our ordinary human experience are to be\nfound wanting on account of their not being reducible to a more\nscientifically acceptable, physicalist base. In each case,\nStrawson\u2019s aim is to deny the denial, and to explain, as one\nmight say, how philosophers can have their cake and eat it. Against\nthe sceptic about knowledge, Strawson stresses that the claims that\nthey deny are presuppositions of all human thought and enquiry;\nagainst the reductive naturalist he goes further, not only stressing\nthe inescapability of the ordinary human standpoint but also allowing\nit its own validity from its own particular standpoint.\n\nThe book is about philosophy in another sense, since it employs and\nilluminates some ideas from earlier philosophers, especially Hume and\nWittgenstein, and reveals Strawson\u2019s very deep understanding of\nthem. The book marks, also, a further development in Strawson\u2019s\nengagement with epistemological scepticism. Strawson expresses\nagreement with some of his earlier critics (in particular Stroud) that\ntranscendental arguments are problematic as anti-sceptical devices,\nand suggests instead that scepticism can be set aside because no-one\nis persuaded by sceptical arguments. Philosophical sceptical doubts\nare not serious doubts, and so are not to be taken\nseriously. This further twist in Strawson\u2019s\nepistemology has, again, inspired considerable debate, and no\nconsensus has yet emerged. In particular, it remains to be determined\nhow strongly we should take Strawson\u2019s suggestions that certain\nclaims are presuppositions on human thought and enquiry. One worry\nwhich remains is that Strawson\u2019s point that no one is remotely\ninclined to accept the sceptic\u2019s claim establishes at most that\nwe regard such arguments as having the status of defending a\nparadoxical conclusion; it does not, in itself, explain why the\nconclusion is incorrect. However, as well as being an original\ncontribution to epistemology, the book presents an approach to\nontology which deserves to be called Oxonian, because it has been\npopular in Oxford. The idea is that there is no good reason not to be\nrealists about most aspects of the world, including colour, mentality,\nmeaning, and perhaps value, but that this does not require the defence\nof a reduction to some features of a supposedly more\nfundamental realm. This is a relaxed realism that does not\nset its face against the claims of natural science, but rather refuses\nto take them as calling into question the legitimacy of our ordinary\nways of thinking about the world. This form of Oxford realism was\ninfluential on a generation of British philosophers, many of whom were\nStrawson\u2019s students.\n\nFinally, in 1992, Strawson published Analysis and Metaphysics: an\nIntroduction to Philosophy. Strawson had given introductory\nlectures once he became a professor, and the lectures became this\nbook. It is, again, a book about philosophy, contrasting different\nconceptions of the subject, and defending Strawson\u2019s own\nconception of the nature and value of analysis. Of importance here is\nStrawson\u2019s distinction between reductive and connective\nanalysis. Strawson\u2019s attitude is that the aim of analysis is to\nreveal conceptual links and connexions, thereby illuminating some\nfeatures of our concepts, but that there is no favoured basic level of\nthought to which it is the goal of philosophical analysis to reduce\neverything else. Echoing the name for his conception of ontology, one\nmight call that a conception of relaxed analysis. Strawson in\nfact repeatedly wrote about the nature of philosophy, and the views in\nthis book are his final conclusions. It is also a book in which he\npractises what he preaches in relation to certain chosen areas,\nincluding, for example, the topics of causation and explanation,\nexperience, meaning, and freedom. Whether it is a good introductory\nbook or not, it is certainly a deep and interesting treatment of its\ntopics for the non-beginner! Strawson himself prepares the reader by\nremarking brilliantly that the book \u2018though introductory\n\u2026 is not elementary. There is no such thing as elementary\nphilosophy. There is no shallow end to the philosophical pool\u2019\n(Strawson 1992, vii).\n8. \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d\n\nStrawson always joked that he would turn to moral philosophy only when\nhis powers were waning. He wrote very little on the topic, commenting\nlater on his \u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 and \u2018Social\nMorality and Individual Ideal\u2019, that \u2018[b]etween them,\nthese two papers effectively embody all I have thought or have to say\nin a philosophical area which, important as I recognize it to be, I\nhave never found as intellectually gripping as those to which I have\ngiven more attention\u2019 (Strawson 1998, 11). Nevertheless,\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 (Strawson 1962) is perhaps now\nStrawson\u2019s most famous and widely discussed paper.\n\nStrawson\u2019s aim in this paper is to dissolve the so-called\nproblem of determinism and responsibility. He does this by drawing a\ncontrast between two different perspectives we can take on the world:\nthe \u2018participant\u2019 and \u2018objective\u2019 standpoints.\nThese perspectives involve different explanations of other\npeople\u2019s actions. From the objective point of view, we see\npeople as elements of the natural world, causally manipulated and\nmanipulable in various ways. From the participant point of view, we\nsee others as appropriate objects of \u2018reactive attitudes\u2019,\nattitudes such as gratitude, anger, sympathy and resentment, which\npresuppose the responsibility of other people. These two perspectives\nare opposed to one another, but both are legitimate.\n\nStrawson\u2019s paper notes two broad ways in which we can withdraw\nfrom the participant perspective. The first involves cases in which\nthe agent remains someone to whom reactive attitudes are appropriate\nbut where something about the circumstances means that the attitude is\nnot appropriate in this particular case. Perhaps you stood on my foot\nbecause you were pushed. In this case, you have a good excuse for your\nbehaviour and resentment is no longer appropriate. The second involves\ncases in which the agent has more or less permanent incapacities which\nremove them from the domain of reactive attitudes in general. Perhaps\nthe person who stood on my foot is a child or in the grip of some\npsychopathological illness. In these cases, we cease to treat the\nagent as a fitting object of reactive attitudes, even if only\ntemporarily.\n\nStrawson takes these observations about the reactive attitudes to bear\non the reconciliation of determinism and responsibility because of the\ninescapability of the reactive attitudes. They are a central part of\nwhat it is to be human. The truth of determinism cannot, then, force\nus to give up the participant standpoint, because the reactive\nattitudes are too deeply embedded in our humanity. Between determinism\nand responsibility there can be no conflict.\n\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 has spawned an extensive\nliterature. It introduced the notion of reactive attitudes to debates\nabout free will and responsibility and one set of questions raised by\nthe paper concerns the nature of these attitudes. Strawson\ncharacterises them initially as those belonging to involvement or\nparticipation with others in interpersonal human relationships and he\ntakes them to target the good will of others as manifested in their\nbehaviour. Others have broaded the notion, instead emphasising their\nconnection to holding someone to some expectation or demand (see\nWallace 1994). Another set of questions concerns the relation between\nthe reactive attitudes and moral responsibility. Gary Watson, in a\npaper first published in 1987, reads Strawson as holding that the\nreactive attitudes are constitutive of moral responsibility and raises\na challenge for such a view in explaining our attitudes towards cases\nof extreme evil (Watson 2004). Others have queried whether Strawson\nintends the reactive attitudes to have such explanatory priority\n(Alvarez 2021)\n\nA final set of questions concerns the inescapability of the\nparticipant stance and its role in the overall structure of\nStrawson\u2019s argument. Some have emphasised the connections with\nStrawson\u2019s reading of Hume and Wittgenstein as set out in\nSkepticism and Naturalism; see, for example, Russell 1992. Others such\nas Allais 2014 have emphasised the connections with Kant, not least\nthe suggestive affinity with Kant\u2019s attempt to dissolve the\nproblem of free will in the Critique of Pure Reason. More recently,\nHieronymi 2020 provides a book-length defence of a \u2018social\nnaturalist\u2019 reading of Strawson\u2019s paper and De Mesel 2022\ntraces the connection between \u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 and\nStrawson\u2019s later (and underappreciated) writings on the same\nthemes. \n\nStrawson\u2019s paper and many of its important responses are\ncollected together in McKenna and Russell 2008. A set of papers\npublished to mark its 50th anniversary are collected in Shoemaker and\nTognazzini 2014.\n9. Some Themes in Strawson\u2019s Writings\n\nStrawson contributed ideas to debates about a wide range of topics,\nonly some of which can be described here. We have selected five areas\nto describe.\n9.1 Perception\n\nStrawson made a major contribution to the theory of perception. His\nconception is articulated to some extent in The Bounds of\nSense, but also in a series of articles, of which the most famous\nis \u2018Perception and Its Objects\u2019 (1979). He suggests that\nthe concept of perception should be analysed as a causal concept. His\nversion of the causal theory differs in two main respects from that of\nGrice, who also famously defended a similar analysis. First,\nStrawson\u2019s argument for view turns on the idea that perception\nis essentially a method of acquiring knowledge; he suggests that this\nrequires that the concept of perception is a causal concept. Second,\nStrawson claims that Grice\u2019s attempt to spell out the right\ncausal chain by picking it out via examples is circular, and he\ninstead invokes notions of match and range. Strawson\u2019s version\nattracted considerable attention. More important is Strawson\u2019s\nclaim that there is no way to describe perceptual experience in terms\nwhich are not physical-object concept involving. That this can be\ndone, he thinks, is the crucial mistake of the traditional empiricist\nmodel, as represented, for example, in the thought of A. J. Ayer.\nAccording to Strawson we are not reading in or interpreting our\nexperiences when we respond to them by making objective judgements; we\nare simply endorsing their content. Strawson therefore holds that it\nis myth to suppose that we can locate a level of claim on the basis of\nwhich we can defend the validity of our application of physical object\nconcepts. Rather, our experience is \u2018saturated\u2019 by those\nconcepts themselves. In a more recent terminology, Strawson holds that\nperception involves the occurrence in us of experiences having\nobjective representational content, and that there can be\nhallucinations with a similar content but which are not properly\nperceptual because the complex causal requirements for being\nperceptual are not met. Strawson\u2019s claims about perception are\ndiscussed in Snowdon 1998.\n9.2 Language\n\nStrawson\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of language is also\nfar more extensive and important than so far indicated. He developed\nhis views in relation to the leading ideas of others about language.\nOne conception that he opposed is that of Quine. Writing with Grice,\nhe argued that Quine\u2019s criticisms of the idea of analyticity\nrest on a commitment to a kind of reduction that itself is simply a\ndogma. Moreover, repeatedly over the next twenty years he argued that\nQuine\u2019s sceptical approach to meaning and related notions is\nboth unfounded and also wrong in that it deprives us of notions that\nwe cannot do without in the study of logic and language. Strawson also\nengaged with Davidson\u2019s account of meaning, mainly in his\ninaugural lecture \u2018Meaning and Truth\u2019 (1969), but also\nelsewhere. Strawson suggests that truth is itself a notion secondary\nto saying (and communication) and cannot play the role in an account\nof meaning that Davidson proposed. His other reaction to the\nDavidsonian programme, which accepted a notion of logical form for\nnatural language sentences specified in the complex formulae of\npredicate logic, was to deny that there is a requirement to map\nordinary language onto artificial logical structures. This attitude\nplaced Strawson in opposition to a movement of thought that swept\nthrough Oxford\u2019s younger philosophers during his time as a\nprofessor. And what Strawson never quite achieved was an alternative\nexplanation to Davidson\u2019s of what a theory of meaning should be.\nHis attitude to truth, and his slogan that ordinary language has no\nprecise logic, implied that centring an analysis of meaning on truth\nconditions and a search for logical forms in natural language\nexpressible in the predicate calculus was misguided. But he did not\ngive a positive account of how we do understand linguistic\nutterances.\n\nStrawson also made important contributions to the assessment of\nAustin\u2019s theory of speech acts and Grice\u2019s own model of\nmeaning. Finally, he responded to the anti-realist approach developed\nby Dummett, which also gained its adherents, in \u2018Scruton and\nWright on Anti-Realism\u2019 (1976), a brief but brilliant critique\nwhich argued that there are no obvious reasons to adopt the\nanti-realist account of truth, and moreover that it is hard to make\nthat account consistent with what appear to be obvious facts about the\nknowability (or unknowability) of our psychological lives and the\npast.\n9.3 History of Philosophy\n\nAnother theme that needs stressing is Strawson\u2019s engagement with\nthe history of philosophy. His work on Kant in The Bounds of\nSense and in other articles is perhaps the most straightforward\nexample of this engagement, but it is not the only instance. In\nIndividuals and elsewhere he wrote about Descartes,\nespecially his account of the self. Leibniz is the hero, or perhaps\nanti-hero, of chapter 4 of Individuals. Hume and Wittgenstein\nare the central characters in Skepticism and Naturalism, and\nhe wrote about Spinoza, especially his theory of freedom. From the\nlast century, he wrote about Wittgenstein, in a famous review of the\nPhilosophical Investigations, published in Mind\n(reprinted in Strawson 2011), and also G.E. Moore. These writings\nreveal both a deep knowledge and a deep understanding of these\nthinkers, never unsympathetic and always able to see the wood as well\nas the trees. Strawson had a sense of the age of philosophical\nproblems, and of the insights from the great dead philosophers that\nneed preserving and renewing.\n9.4 Scepticism and knowledge\n\nWe have set out, to some extent, the development of Strawson\u2019s\nepistemological views, but have not described his earliest proposal in\nrelation to the problem of induction. In An Introduction to\nLogical Theory he pioneered what came to be called the\n\u2018analytical solution\u2019, according to which there cannot be\nany question as to the rationality of the employment of induction,\nsince by being rational we mean, amongst other things, using\ninduction. The question whether induction is rational resembles,\naccording to this approach, the question whether the law is legal.\nSince \u2018being legal\u2019 means \u2018being in accordance with\nthe law\u2019, there can be no question about the legality of the\nlaw. This remains a discussed approach. In Individuals he\ntalked of the satisfaction of certain conditions as being criterial\nfor the ascription of some disputed claims, and justified that by\ntranscendental arguments. The Bounds of Sense can be regarded\nas an extended anti-sceptical transcendental argument. Finally, in\nSkepticism and Naturalism he attempts to oppose the sceptic\nby appealing to the inescapability of the claims opposed by the\nsceptic. The unity amongst all these proposals is that the response to\nscepticism is never the production of a proof or demonstration based\non a level of thought external or prior to the discourse in question.\nEach solution aims to turn aside scepticism in some other way.\nStrawson\u2019s ingenuity in devising such responses is very\nimpressive and he is the source of at least three major anti-sceptical\napproaches.\n10. Conclusion\n\nStrawson did not seek to make disciples, nor did he write too much by\nway of defence of his views against critics (except, as it were, when\nhe had to). However, he produced a continuous flow of original and\nprofound, and elegantly expressed, philosophy dealing with a very\nbroad range of topics. He thereby exerted a considerable influence on\nphilosophy, both during his lifetime and, indeed, since his death.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<h4>A.
