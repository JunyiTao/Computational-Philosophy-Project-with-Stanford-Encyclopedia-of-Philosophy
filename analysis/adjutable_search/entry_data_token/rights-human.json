The General Idea of Human Rights\n\nThis section attempts to explain the general idea of human rights by\nidentifying four defining features. The goal is to answer the question\nof what human rights are with a description of the core concept rather\nthan a list of specific rights. Two people can have the same general\nidea of human rights even though they disagree about which rights\nbelong on a list of such rights and even about whether universal moral\nrights exist. The four-part explanation below attempts to cover all\nkinds of human rights including both moral and legal human rights and\nboth old and new human rights (e.g., both Lockean natural rights and\ncontemporary human rights). The explanation anticipates, however, that\nparticular kinds of human rights will have additional features.\nStarting with this general concept does not commit us to treating all\nkinds of human rights in a single unified theory (see Buchanan 2013\nfor an argument that we should not attempt to theorize together\nuniversal moral rights and international legal human rights).\n\n(1) Human rights are rights. Lest we miss the obvious, human\nrights are rights (see Cruft 2012 and the entry on\n rights\n ). Most if not all human rights are claim rights that impose duties\nor responsibilities on their addressees or dutybearers. Rights focus\non a freedom, protection, status, or benefit for the rightholders\n(Beitz 2009). The duties associated with human rights often require\nactions involving respect, protection, facilitation, and provision.\nRights are usually mandatory in the sense of imposing duties on their\naddressees, but some legal human rights seem to do little more than\ndeclare high-priority goals and assign responsibility for their\nprogressive realization. One can argue, of course, that goal-like\nrights are not real rights, but it may be better to recognize that\nthey comprise a weak but useful notion of a right (See Beitz 2009 for\na defense of the view that not all human rights are rights in a strong\nsense. And see Feinberg 1973 for the idea of \u201cmanifesto\nrights\u201d). A human rights norm might exist as (a) a shared norm\nof actual human moralities, (b) a justified moral norm supported by\nstrong reasons, (c) a legal right at the national level (where it\nmight be referred to as a \u201ccivil\u201d or\n\u201cconstitutional\u201d right), or (d) a legal right within\ninternational law. A human rights advocate might wish to see human\nrights exist in all four ways (See Section 2.1 How Can Human Rights\nExist?). \n\n(2) Human rights are plural. If someone accepted that there\nare human rights but held that there is only one of them, this might\nmake sense if she meant that there is one abstract underlying right\nthat generates a list of specific rights (See Dworkin 2011 for a view\nof this sort). But if this person meant that there is just one\nspecific right such as the right to peaceful assembly this would be a\nhighly revisionary view. Human rights address a variety of specific\nproblems such as guaranteeing fair trials, ending slavery, ensuring\nthe availability of education, and preventing genocide. Some\nphilosophers advocate very short lists of human rights but\nnevertheless accept plurality (see Cohen 2004, Ignatieff 2004).\n\n(3) Human rights are universal. All living humans\u2014or\nperhaps all living persons\u2014have human rights. One does\nnot have to be a particular kind of person or a member of some\nspecific nation or religion to have human rights. Included in the idea\nof universality is some conception of independent existence.\nPeople have human rights independently of whether they are found in\nthe practices, morality, or law of their country or culture. This idea\nof universality needs several qualifications, however. First, some\nrights, such as the right to vote, are held only by adult citizens or\nresidents and apply only to voting in one\u2019s own country. Second,\nthe human right to freedom of movement may be taken away temporarily\nfrom a person who is convicted of committing a serious crime. And\nthird, some human rights treaties focus on the rights of vulnerable\ngroups such as minorities, women, indigenous peoples, and\nchildren.\n\n(4) Human rights have high-priority. Maurice Cranston held\nthat human rights are matters of \u201cparamount importance\u201d\nand their violation \u201ca grave affront to justice\u201d (Cranston\n1967). If human rights did not have high priority they would not have\nthe ability to compete with other powerful considerations such as\nnational stability and security, individual and national\nself-determination, and national and global prosperity. High priority\ndoes not mean, however, that human rights are absolute. As James\nGriffin says, human rights should be understood as \u201cresistant to\ntrade-offs, but not too resistant\u201d (Griffin 2008). Further,\nthere seems to be priority variation within human rights. For example,\nwhen the right to life conflicts with the right to privacy, the latter\nwill generally be outweighed. \n\nLet\u2019s now consider five other features or functions that might\nbe added. \n\nShould human rights be defined as inalienable? Inalienability\ndoes not mean that rights are absolute or can never be overridden by\nother considerations. Rather it means that its holder cannot lose it\ntemporarily or permanently by bad conduct or by voluntarily giving it\nup. It is doubtful that all human rights are inalienable in this\nsense. One who endorses both human rights and imprisonment as\npunishment for serious crimes must hold that people\u2019s rights to\nfreedom of movement can be forfeited temporarily or permanently by\njust convictions of serious crimes. Perhaps it is sufficient to say\nthat human rights are very hard to lose. (For a stronger view of\ninalienability, see Donnelly 2003, Meyers 1985).\n\nShould human rights be defined as minimal rights? A number of\nphilosophers have proposed the view that human rights are minimal in\nthe sense of not being too numerous (a few dozen rights rather than\nhundreds or thousands), and not being too demanding (See Joshua Cohen\n2004, Ignatieff 2005, and Rawls 1999). Their views suggest that human\nrights are\u2014or should be\u2014more concerned with avoiding the\nworst than with achieving the best. Henry Shue suggests that human\nrights concern the \u201clower limits on tolerable human\nconduct\u201d rather than \u201cgreat aspirations and exalted\nideals\u201d (Shue 1996). When human rights are modest standards they\nleave most legal and policy matters open to democratic decision-making\nat the national and local levels. This allows human rights to have\nhigh priority, to accommodate a great deal of cultural and\ninstitutional variation among countries, and to leave open a large\nspace for democratic decision-making at the national level. Still,\nthere is no contradiction in the idea of an extremely expansive list\nof human rights and hence minimalism is not a defining feature of\nhuman rights (for criticism of the view that human rights are minimal\nstandards see Brems 2009 and Raz 2010). Minimalism is best seen as a\nnormative prescription for what international human rights\nshould be. Moderate forms of minimalism have considerable appeal, but\nnot as part of the definition of human rights. \n\nShould human rights be defined as always being or\n\u201cmirroring\u201d moral rights? Philosophers coming to\nhuman rights theory from moral philosophy sometimes assume that human\nrights must be, at bottom, moral rather than legal rights. There is no\ncontradiction, however, in people saying that they believe in human\nrights, but only when they are legal rights at the national or\ninternational levels. As Louis Henkin observed, \u201cPolitical\nforces have mooted the principal philosophical objections, bridging\nthe chasm between natural and positive law by converting natural human\nrights into positive legal rights\u201d (Henkin 1978). Theorists who\ninsist that the only human rights are legal rights may find, however,\nthat the interpretations they can give of universality, independent\nexistence, and high priority are weak.\n\nShould human rights be defined in terms of serving some sort of\npolitical function? Instead of seeing human rights as grounded in\nsome sort of independently existing moral reality, a theorist might\nsee them as the norms of a highly useful political practice that\nhumans have constructed or evolved. Such a view would see the idea of\nhuman rights as playing various political roles at the national and\ninternational levels and as serving thereby to protect urgent human\nand national interests. These political roles might include providing\nstandards for international evaluations of how governments treat their\npeople and specifying when use of economic sanctions or military\nintervention is permissible (see\n Section 2.3 Political Conceptions of Human Rights\n below). \n\nPolitical theorists would add to the four defining elements suggested\nabove some set of political roles or functions. This kind of view may\nbe plausible for the very salient international human rights\nthat have emerged in international law and politics in the last fifty\nyears. But human rights can exist and function in contexts not\ninvolving international scrutiny and intervention such as a world with\nonly one state. Imagine, for example, that an asteroid strike had\nkilled everyone in all countries except New Zealand, leaving it the\nonly state in existence. Surely the idea of human rights as well as\nmany dimensions of human rights practice could continue in New\nZealand, even though there would be no international relations, law,\nor politics (for an argument of this sort see Tasioulas 2012). And if\nin the same scenario a few people were discovered to have survived in\nIceland and were living without a government or state, New Zealanders\nwould know that human rights governed how these people should be\ntreated even though they were stateless. How deeply the idea of human\nrights must be rooted in international law and practice should not be\nsettled by definitional fiat. We can allow, however, that the sorts of\npolitical functions that Rawls and Beitz describe are\ntypically served by international human rights today. \n2. The Existence and Grounds of Human Rights\n2.1 How Can Human Rights Exist?\n\nA philosophical question about human rights that occurs to many people\nis how it is possible for such rights to exist. Several possible ways\nare explored in this section.\n\nThe most obvious way in which human rights come into existence is as\nnorms of national and international law that are created by enactment,\ncustom, and judicial decisions. At the international level, human\nrights norms exist because of treaties that have turned them into\ninternational law. For example, the human right not to be held in\nslavery or servitude in Article 4 of the\n European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n (Council of Europe, 1950) and in Article 8 of the\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n (UN 1966) exists because these treaties establish it. At the national\nlevel, human rights norms exist because they have through legislative\nenactment, judicial decision, or custom become part of a\ncountry\u2019s law. For example, the right against slavery exists in\nthe United States because the\n 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n prohibits slavery and servitude. When rights are embedded in\ninternational law we speak of them as human rights; but when they are\nenacted in national law we more frequently describe them as civil or\nconstitutional rights. \n\nEnactment in national and international law is clearly one of the ways\nin which human rights exist. But many have suggested that this cannot\nbe the only way. If human rights exist only because of enactment,\ntheir availability is contingent on domestic and international\npolitical developments. Many people have looked for a way to support\nthe idea that human rights have roots that are deeper and less subject\nto human decisions than legal enactment. One version of this idea is\nthat people are born with rights, that human rights are somehow innate\nor inherent in human beings (see Morsink 2009). One way that a\nnormative status could be inherent in humans is by being God-given.\nThe\n U.S. Declaration of Independence\n (1776) claims that people are \u201cendowed by their Creator\u201d\nwith natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On\nthis view, God, the supreme lawmaker, enacted some basic human\nrights.\n\nRights plausibly attributed to divine decree must be very general and\nabstract (life, liberty, etc.) so that they can apply to thousands of\nyears of human history, not just to recent centuries. But contemporary\nhuman rights are specific and many of them presuppose contemporary\ninstitutions (e.g., the right to a fair trial and the right to\neducation). Even if people are born with God-given natural rights, we\nneed to explain how to get from those general and abstract rights to\nthe specific rights found in contemporary declarations and\ntreaties.\n\nAttributing human rights to God\u2019s commands may give them a\nsecure status at the metaphysical level, but in a very diverse world\nit does not make them practically secure. Billions of people do not\nbelieve in the God of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. If people do\nnot believe in God, or in the sort of god that prescribes rights, and\nif you want to base human rights on theological beliefs you must\npersuade these people of a rights-supporting theological view. This is\nlikely to be even harder than persuading them of human rights. Legal\nenactment at the national and international levels provides a far more\nsecure status for practical purposes.\n\nHuman rights could also exist independently of legal enactment by\nbeing part of actual human moralities. All human groups seem to have\nmoralities in the sense of imperative norms of interpersonal behavior\nbacked by reasons and values. These moralities contain specific norms\n(for example, a prohibition of the intentional murder of an innocent\nperson) and specific values (for example, valuing human life.) If\nalmost all human groups have moralities containing norms prohibiting\nmurder, these norms could partially constitute the human right to\nlife.\n\nThe view that human rights are norms found in all human moralities is\nattractive but has serious difficulties. Although worldwide acceptance\nof human rights has been increasing rapidly in recent decades (see\n 4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices),\n worldwide moral unanimity about human rights does not exist. Human\nrights declarations and treaties are intended to change existing\nnorms, not just describe the existing moral consensus. \n\nYet another way of explaining the existence of human rights is to say\nthat they exist most basically in true or justified ethical outlooks.\nOn this account, to say that there is a human right against torture is\nmainly to assert that there are strong reasons for believing that it\nis always morally wrong to engage in torture and that protections\nshould be provided against it. This approach would view the Universal\nDeclaration as attempting to formulate a justified political morality\nfor the whole planet. It was not merely trying to identify a\npreexisting moral consensus; it was rather trying to create a\nconsensus that could be supported by very plausible moral and\npractical reasons. This approach requires commitment to the\nobjectivity of such reasons. It holds that just as there are reliable\nways of finding out how the physical world works, or what makes\nbuildings sturdy and durable, there are ways of finding out what\nindividuals may justifiably demand of each other and of governments.\nEven if unanimity about human rights is currently lacking, rational\nagreement is available to humans if they will commit themselves to\nopen-minded and serious moral and political inquiry. If moral reasons\nexist independently of human construction, they can\u2014when\ncombined with true premises about current institutions, problems, and\nresources\u2014generate moral norms different from those currently\naccepted or enacted. The Universal Declaration seems to proceed on\nexactly this assumption (see Morsink 2009). One problem with this view\nis that existence as good reasons seems a rather thin form of\nexistence for human rights. But perhaps we can view this thinness as a\npractical rather than a theoretical problem, as something to be\nremedied by the formulation and enactment of legal norms. The best\nform of existence for human rights would combine robust legal\nexistence with the sort of moral existence that comes from widespread\nacceptance based on strong moral and practical reasons.\n2.2 Normative Justifications for Human Rights\n\nJustifications for human rights should defend their main features\nincluding their character as rights, their universality, and their\nhigh priority. Such justifications should also be capable of providing\nstarting points for justifying a plausible list of specific rights (on\nstarting points and making the transition to specific rights see\nNickel 2007; see also\n Section 3 Which Rights are Human Rights?\n below). Further, justifying international human rights is\nlikely to require additional steps (Buchanan 2012). These requirements\nmake the construction of a good justification for human rights a\ndaunting task.\n\nApproaches to justification include grounding human rights in\nprudential reasons, practical reasons, moral rights (Thomson 1990),\nhuman well-being (Sumner 1987, Talbott 2010), fundamental interests\n(Beitz 2015), human needs (Miller 2012), agency and autonomy (Gewirth\n1996, Griffin 2008) dignity (Gilabert 2018, Kateb 2011, Tasioulas\n2015), fairness (Nickel 2007), equality, and positive freedom (Gould\n2004, Nussbaum 2000, Sen 2004). Justifications can be based on just\none of these types of reasons or they can be eclectic and appeal to\nseveral (Tasioulas. 2015).\n\nGrounding human rights in human agency and autonomy has had strong\nadvocates in recent decades. For example, in Human Rights: Essays\non Justification and Application (1982) Alan Gewirth offered an\nagency-based justification for human rights. He argued that denying\nthe value of successful agency and action is not an option for a human\nbeing; having a life requires regarding the indispensable conditions\nof agency and action as necessary goods. Abstractly described, these\nconditions of successful agency are freedom and well-being. A prudent\nrational agent who must have freedom and well-being will assert a\n\u201cprudential right claim\u201d to them. Having demanded that\nothers respect her freedom and well-being, consistency requires her to\nrecognize and respect the freedom and well-being of other persons.\nSince all other agents are in exactly the same position as she is of\nneeding freedom and well-being, consistency requires her to recognize\nand respect their claims to freedom and well-being. She\n\u201clogically must accept\u201d that other people as agents have\nequal rights to freedom and well-being. These two abstract rights work\nalone and together to generate equal specific human rights of familiar\nsorts (Gewirth 1978, 1982, 1996). Gewirth\u2019s aspiration was to\nprovide an argument for human rights that applies to all human agents\nand that is inescapable. From a few hard-to-dispute facts and a\nprinciple of consistency he thinks we can derive two generic human\nrights\u2014and from them, a list of more determinate rights.\nGewirth\u2019s views have generated a large critical literature (see\nBeyleveld 1991, Boylan 1999).\n\nA more recent attempt to base human rights on agency and autonomy is\nfound in James Griffin\u2019s book, On Human Rights (2008).\nGriffin does not share Gewirth\u2019s goal of providing a logically\ninescapable argument for human rights, but his overall view shares key\nstructural features with Gewirth\u2019s. These include starting the\njustification with the unique value of human agency and autonomy\n(which Griffin calls \u201cnormative agency\u201d), postulating some\nabstract rights (autonomy, freedom, and well-being), and making a\nplace for a right to well-being within an agency-based approach.\n\nIn the current dispute between \u201cmoral\u201d (or\n\u201corthodox\u201d) and \u201cpolitical\u201d conceptions of\nhuman rights, Griffin strongly sides with those who see human rights\nas fundamentally moral rights. Their defining role, in Griffin\u2019s\nview, is protecting people\u2019s ability to form and pursue\nconceptions of a worthwhile life\u2014a capacity that Griffin\nvariously refers to as \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cnormative\nagency,\u201d and \u201cpersonhood.\u201d This ability to form,\nrevise, and pursue conceptions of a worthwhile life is taken to be of\nparamount value, the exclusive source of human dignity, and thereby\nthe basis of human rights (Griffin 2008). Griffin holds that people\nvalue this capacity \u201cespecially highly, often more highly than\neven their happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cPracticalities\u201d also shape human rights in\nGriffin\u2019s view. He describes practicalities as \u201ca second\nground\u201d of human rights. They prescribe making the boundaries of\nrights clear by avoiding \u201ctoo many complicated bends,\u201d\nenlarging rights a little to give them safety margins, and consulting\nfacts about human nature and the nature of society. Accordingly, the\njustifying generic function that Griffin assigns to human rights is\nprotecting normative agency while taking account of\npracticalities.\n\nGriffin claims that human rights suffer even more than other normative\nconcepts from an \u201cindeterminacy of sense\u201d that makes them\nvulnerable to proliferation (Griffin 2008). He thinks that tying all\nhuman rights to the single value of normative agency while taking\naccount of practicalities is the best way to remedy this malady. He\ncriticizes the frequent invention of new human rights and the\n\u201cballooning of the content\u201d of established rights. Still,\nGriffin is friendly towards most of the rights in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Beyond this, Griffin takes human rights\nto include many rights in interpersonal morality. For example, Griffin\nthinks that a child\u2019s human right to education applies not just\nagainst governments but also against the child\u2019s parents.\n\nGriffin\u2019s thesis that all human rights are grounded in normative\nagency is put forward not so much as a description but as a proposal,\nas the best way of giving human rights unity, coherence, and limits.\nUnfortunately, accepting and following this proposal is unlikely to\nyield effective barriers to proliferation or a sharp line between\nhuman rights and other moral norms. The main reason is one that\nGriffin himself recognizes: the \u201cgenerative capacities\u201d of\nnormative agency are \u201cquite great.\u201d Providing adequate\nprotections of the three components of normative agency (autonomy,\nfreedom, and minimal well-being) will encounter a lot of threats to\nthese values and hence will require lots of rights. \n2.3 Political Conceptions of Human Rights\n\nViews that explain human rights in terms of the practical political\nroles that they play have had prominent advocates in recent decades.\nThese \u201cpolitical\u201d conceptions of human rights explain what\nhuman rights are by describing the things that they\ndo. Two philosophers who have developed political conceptions\nare discussed in this section, namely, John Rawls and Charles Beitz\n(for helpful discussions of political conceptions and their\nalternatives see the collections of essays in Etinson 2018 and Maliks\nand Schaffer 2017). \n\nAdvocates of political conceptions of human rights are often agnostic\nor skeptical about universal moral rights while rejecting\nwholesale moral skepticism and thinking possible the provision of\nsound normative justifications for the content, normativity, and roles\nof human rights (for challenges to purely political views see Gilabert\n2011, Liao and Etinson 2012, Sangiovanni 2017, and Waldron 2018).\n\nJohn Rawls introduced the idea of a political conception of human\nrights in his book,  The Law of Peoples (Rawls 1999). The\nbasic idea is that we can understand what human rights are and what\ntheir justification requires by identifying the main roles they play\nin some political sphere. In The Law of Peoples this sphere\nis international relations (and, secondarily, national politics).\nRawls was attempting a normative reconstruction of international law\nand politics within today\u2019s international system, and this helps\nexplain Rawls\u2019s focus on how human rights function within this\nsystem.\n\nRawls says that human rights are a special class of urgent\nrights. He seems to accept the definition of human rights given\nin Section 1 above. Besides saying that human rights are rights that\nare high priority or \u201curgent,\u201d Rawls also accepts that\nthey are plural and universal. But Rawls was working on a narrower\nproject than Gewirth and Griffin. The international human\nrights he was concerned with are also defined by their roles in\nhelping define in various ways the normative structure of the global\nsystem. They provide content to other normative concepts such as\nlegitimacy, sovereignty, permissible intervention, and membership in\ngood standing in the international community.\n\nAccording to Rawls the justificatory process for human rights is\nanalogous to the one for principles of justice at the national level\nthat he described in A Theory of Justice (Rawls 1971).\nInstead of asking about the terms of cooperation that free and equal\ncitizens would agree to under fair conditions, we ask about the terms\nof cooperation that free and equal peoples or countries would\nagree to under fair conditions. We imagine representatives of the\nworld\u2019s countries meeting to choose the normative principles\nthat constitute the basic international structure. These\nrepresentatives are imagined to see the countries they represent as\nfree (rightfully independent) and equal (equally worthy of respect and\nfair treatment). These representatives are also imagined to be\nchoosing rationally in light of the fundamental interests of their\ncountry, to be reasonable in seeking to find and respect fair terms of\ncooperation, and impartial because they are behind a \u201cveil of\nignorance\u201d\u2014they lack information about the country they\nrepresent such as its size, wealth, and power. Rawls holds that under\nthese conditions these representatives will unanimously choose\nprinciples for the global order that include some basic human rights\n(for further explanation of the global original position see the\nentries on\n John Rawls\n and\n original position).\n\nRawls advocated a limited list of human rights, one that leaves out\nmany fundamental freedoms, rights of political participation, and\nequality rights. He did this for two reasons. One is that he wanted a\nlist that is plausible for all reasonable countries, not just liberal\ndemocracies. The second reason is that he viewed serious violations of\nhuman rights as triggering permissible intervention by other\ncountries, and only the most important rights can play this role.\n\nLeaving out protections for equality and democracy is a high price to\npay for assigning human rights the role of making international\nintervention permissible when they are seriously violated. We can\naccommodate Rawls\u2019underlying idea without paying that price. To\naccept the idea that countries engaging in massive violations of the\nmost important human rights are not to be tolerated we do not need to\nfollow Rawls in equating international human rights with a\nheavily-pruned list. Instead we can work up a view\u2014which is\nneeded for other purposes anyway\u2014of which human rights are the\nweightiest and then assign the intervention-permitting role to this\nsubset.\n\nCharles Beitz\u2019s account of human rights in The Idea of Human\nRights (Beitz 2009) shares many similarities with Rawls\u2019s\nbut is much more fully developed. Like Rawls, Beitz deals with human\nrights only as they have developed in contemporary international human\nrights practice. Beitz suggests that we can develop an understanding\nof human rights by attending to \u201cthe practical inferences that\nwould be drawn by competent participants in the practice from what\nthey regard as valid claims of human rights.\u201d Observations of\nwhat competent participants say and do inform the account of what\nhuman rights are. The focus is not on what human rights are at some\ndeep philosophical level; it is rather on how they work by guiding\nactions within a recently emerged and still evolving discursive\npractice. The norms of the practice guide the interpretation and\napplication of human rights, the appropriateness of criticism in terms\nof human rights, adjudication in human rights courts,\nand\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014responding to serious\nviolations of human rights. Beitz says that human rights are\n\u201cmatters of international concern\u201d and that they are\n\u201cpotential triggers of transnational protective and remedial\naction.\u201d\n\nBeitz does not agree with Rawls\u2019s view that these roles require\nan abbreviated list of human rights. He accepts that the requirements\nof human rights are weaker than the requirements of social justice at\nthe national level, but denies that human rights are minimal or highly\nmodest in other respects.\n\nBeitz rightly suggests that a reasonable person can accept and use the\nidea of human rights without accepting any particular view about their\nfoundations. It is less clear that he is right in suggesting that good\njustifications of human rights should avoid as far as possible\ncontroversial assumptions about religion, metaphysics, ideology, and\nintrinsic value (see the entry\n public reason).\n Beitz emphasizes the practical good that human rights do, not their\ngrounds in some underlying moral reality. This helps make human rights\nattractive to people from around the world with their diverse\nreligious and philosophical traditions. The broad justification for\nhuman rights and their normativity that Beitz offers is that they\nprotect \u201curgent individual interests against predictable dangers\n(\u201dstandard threats\u201c) to which they are vulnerable under\ntypical circumstances of life in a modern world order composed of\nindependent states.\u201d\n3. Which Rights are Human Rights?\n\nThis section discusses the question of which rights belong on lists of\nhuman rights. The Universal Declaration\u2019s list, which has had\ngreat influence, consists of six families: (1) Security rights that\nprotect people against murder, torture, and genocide; (2) Due process\nrights that protect people against arbitrary and excessively harsh\npunishments and require fair and public trials for those accused of\ncrimes; (3) Liberty rights that protect people\u2019s fundamental\nfreedoms in areas such as belief, expression, association, and\nmovement; (4) Political rights that protect people\u2019s liberty to\nparticipate in politics by assembling, protesting, voting, and serving\nin public office; (5) Equality rights that guarantee equal\ncitizenship, equality before the law, and freedom from discrimination;\nand (6) Social rights that require that governments ensure to all the\navailability of work, education, health services, and an adequate\nstandard of living. A seventh category, minority and group rights, has\nbeen created by subsequent treaties. These rights protect women,\nracial and ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, children, migrant\nworkers, and the disabled.\n\nNot every question of social justice or wise governance is a human\nrights issue. For example, a country could have too many lawyers or\ninadequate provision for graduate-level education without violating\nany human rights. Deciding which norms should be counted as human\nrights is a matter of considerable difficulty. And there is continuing\npressure to expand lists of human rights to include new areas. Many\npolitical movements would like to see their main concerns categorized\nas matters of human rights, since this would publicize, promote, and\nlegitimize their concerns at the international level. A possible\nresult of this is \u201chuman rights inflation,\u201d the\ndevaluation of human rights caused by producing too much bad human\nrights currency (See Cranston 1973, Orend 2002, Wellman 1999, Griffin\n2008). \n\nOne way to avoid rights inflation is to follow Cranston in insisting\nthat human rights only deal with extremely important goods,\nprotections, and freedoms. A supplementary approach is to impose\nseveral justificatory tests for specific human rights. For example, it\ncould be required that a proposed human right not only protect some\nvery important good but also respond to one or more common and serious\nthreats to that good (Dershowitz 2004, Donnelly 2003, Shue 1996,\nTalbott 2005), impose burdens on the addressees that are justifiable\nand no larger than necessary, and be feasible in most of the\nworld\u2019s countries (on feasibility see Gilabert 2009 and Nickel\n2007). This approach restrains rights inflation with several tests,\nnot just one master test.\n\nIn deciding which specific rights are human rights it is possible to\nmake either too little or too much of international documents such as\nthe Universal Declaration and the European Convention. One makes too\nlittle of them by proceeding as if drawing up a list of important\nrights were a new question, never before addressed, and as if there\nwere no practical wisdom to be found in the choices of rights that\nwent into the historic documents. And one makes too much of them by\npresuming that those documents tell us everything we need to know\nabout human rights. This approach involves a kind of fundamentalism:\nit holds that when a right is on the official lists of human rights\nthat settles its status as a human right (\u201cIf it\u2019s in the\nbook that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d) But the process of\nidentifying human rights in the United Nations and elsewhere was a\npolitical process with plenty of imperfections. There is little reason\nto take international diplomats as the most authoritative guides to\nwhich human rights there are. Further, even if a treaty\u2019s\nratification by most countries can settle the question of whether a\ncertain right is a human right within international law, such a treaty\ncannot settle its weight. The treaty may suggest that the right is\nsupported by weighty considerations, but it cannot make this so. If an\ninternational treaty enacted a right to visit national parks without\ncharge as a human right, the ratification of that treaty would make\nfree access to national parks a human right within international law.\nBut it would not be able to make us believe that the right to visit\nnational parks without charge was sufficiently important to be a real\nhuman right (see Luban 2015).\n3.1 Civil and Political Rights\n\nThe least controversial family of human rights is civil and political\nrights. These rights are familiar from historic bills of rights such\nas the\n French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\n (1789) and the\n U.S. Bill of Rights\n (1791, with subsequent amendments). Contemporary sources include the\nfirst 21 Articles of the\n Universal Declaration,\n and treaties such as the\n European Convention,\n the\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\n the\n American Convention on Human Rights,\n and the\n African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n Some representative formulations follow: \n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought and expression. This\nright includes freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and\nideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in\nwriting, in print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of\none\u2019s choice. (American Convention on Human Rights, Article\n13.1)\n\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom\nof association with others, including the right to form and to join\ntrade unions for the protection of his interests (European Convention,\nArticle 11).\n\n\nEvery citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the\ngovernment of his country, either directly or through freely chosen\nrepresentatives in accordance with the provisions of the law. 2. Every\ncitizen shall have the right of equal access to the public service of\nhis country. 3. Every individual shall have the right of access to\npublic property and services in strict equality of all persons before\nthe law (African Charter, Article 13).\n\n\nMost civil and political rights are not absolute\u2014they can in\nsome cases be overridden by other considerations. For example, the\nright to freedom of movement can be restricted by public and private\nproperty rights, by restraining orders related to domestic violence,\nand by legal punishments. Further, after a disaster such as a\nhurricane or earthquake free movement is often appropriately suspended\nto keep out the curious, permit access of emergency vehicles and\nequipment, and prevent looting. The International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights permits rights to be suspended during times\n\u201cof public emergency which threatens the life of the\nnation\u201d (Article 4). But it excludes some rights from suspension\nincluding the right to life, the prohibition of torture, the\nprohibition of slavery, the prohibition of ex post facto criminal\nlaws, and freedom of thought and religion.\n3.2 Social Rights\n\nThe Universal Declaration included social (or \u201cwelfare\u201d)\nrights that address matters such as education, food, health services,\nand employment. Their inclusion has been the source of much\ncontroversy (see Beetham 1995). The European Convention did not\ninclude them (although it was later amended to include the right to\neducation). Instead they were put into a separate treaty, the\n European Social Charter.\n When the United Nations began the process of putting the rights of\nthe Universal Declaration into international law, it followed the same\npattern by treating economic and social standards in a treaty separate\nfrom the one dealing with civil and political rights. This treaty, the\n International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights\n (the \u201cSocial Covenant,\u201d 1966), treated these standards as\nrights\u2014albeit rights to be progressively realized.\n\nThe Social Covenant\u2019s list of rights includes nondiscrimination\nand equality for women in economic and social life (Articles 2 and 3),\nfreedom to work and opportunities to work (Article 4), fair pay and\ndecent conditions of work (Article 7), the right to form trade unions\nand to strike (Article 8), social security (Article 9), special\nprotections for mothers and children (Article 10), the right to\nadequate food, clothing, and housing (Article 11), the right to basic\nhealth services (Article 12), the right to education (Article 13), and\nthe right to participate in cultural life and scientific progress\n(Article 15).\n\nArticle 2.1 of the Social Covenant sets out what each of the parties\ncommits itself to do about this list, namely to \u201ctake steps,\nindividually and through international assistance and\nco-operation\u2026to the maximum of its available resources, with a\nview to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights\nrecognized in the present Covenant.\u201d In contrast, the Civil and\nPolitical Covenant commits its signatories to immediate compliance, to\n\u201crespect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory\nthe rights recognized in the present Covenant\u201d (Article 2.1).\nThe contrast between these two levels of commitment has led some\npeople to suspect that economic and social rights are really just\nvaluable goals. Why did the Social Covenant opt for progressive\nimplementation and thereby treat its rights as being somewhat like\ngoals? The main reason is that many of the world\u2019s countries\nlacked the economic, institutional, and human resources to realize\nthese standards fully or even largely. For many countries,\nnoncompliance due to inability would have been certain if these\nstandards had been treated as immediately binding.\n\nSocial rights have often been defended with linkage arguments that\nshow the support they provide to adequate realization of civil and\npolitical rights. This approach was first developed philosophically by\nHenry Shue (Shue 1996; see also Nickel 2007 and 2016). Linkage\narguments defend controversial rights by showing the indispensable or\nhighly useful support they provide to uncontroversial rights. For\nexample, if a government succeeds in eliminating hunger and providing\neducation to everyone this promotes people\u2019s abilities to know,\nuse, and enjoy their liberties, due process rights, and rights of\npolitical participation. Lack of education is frequently a barrier to\nthe realization of civil and political rights because uneducated\npeople often do not know what rights they have and what they can do to\nuse and defend them. Lack of education is also a common barrier to\ndemocratic participation. Education and a minimum income make it\neasier for people near the bottom economically to follow politics,\nparticipate in political campaigns, and to spend the time and money\nneeded to go to the polls and vote.\n\nDo social rights yield a sufficient commitment to equality?\nObjections to social rights as human rights have come from both the\npolitical right and the political left. A common objection from the\nleft, including liberal egalitarians and socialists, is that social\nrights as enumerated in human rights documents and treaties provide\ntoo weak of a commitment to material equality (Moyn 2018; Gilabert\n2015). Realizing social rights requires a state that ensures to\neveryone an adequate minimum of resources in some key areas but that\ndoes not necessarily have strong commitments to equality of\nopportunity, to strong redistributive taxation, and to ceilings on\nwealth (see the entries\n equality,\n equality of opportunity,\n distributive justice,\n and\n liberal feminism).\n\nThe egalitarian objection cannot be that human rights documents and\ntreaties showed no concern for people living in poverty and misery.\nThat would be wildly false. One of the main purposes of including\nsocial rights in human rights documents and treaties was to promote\nserious efforts to combat poverty, lack of education, and unhealthy\nliving conditions in countries all around the world (see also Langford\n2013 on the UN Millennium Development Goals). The objection also cannot\nbe that human rights facilitated the hollowing out of systems of\nwelfare rights in many developed countries that occurred after 1980.\nThose cuts in welfare programs were often in violation of the\nrequirements of adequately realizing social rights.\n\nPerhaps it should be conceded that human rights documents and treaties\nhave not said enough about positive measures to promote equal\nopportunity in education and work. A positive right to equal\nopportunity, like the one Rawls proposed, would require countries to\ntake serious measures to reduce disparities between the opportunities\neffectively available to children of high-income and low-income\nparents (Rawls 1971).\n\nA strongly egalitarian political program is best pursued partially\nwithin but mostly beyond the human rights framework. One reason for\nthis is that the human rights movement will have better future\nprospects for acceptance and realization if it has widespread\npolitical support. That requires that the rights it endorses appeal to\npeople with a variety of political views ranging from center-left to\ncenter-right. Support from the broad political center will not emerge\nand survive if the human rights platform is perceived as mostly a\nleftist program.\n\nDo social rights protect sufficiently important human\ninterests? Maurice Cranston opposed social rights by suggesting\nthat social rights are mainly concerned with matters such as holidays\nwith pay that are not matters of deep and universal human interests\n(Cranston 1967, 1973. Treatments of objections to social rights\ninclude Beetham 1995; Howard 1987; and Nickel 2007). It is far from\nthe case, however, that most social rights pertain only to superficial\ninterests. Consider two examples: the right to an adequate standard of\nliving and the right to free public education. These rights require\ngovernments to try to remedy widespread and serious evils such as\nsevere poverty, starvation and malnutrition, and ignorance. The\nimportance of food and other basic material conditions of life is easy\nto show. These goods are essential to people\u2019s ability to live,\nfunction, and flourish. Without adequate access to these goods,\ninterests in life, health, and liberty are endangered and serious\nillness and death are probable. Lack of access to educational\nopportunities typically limits (both absolutely and comparatively)\npeople\u2019s abilities to participate fully and effectively in the\npolitical and economic life of their country. \n\nAre social rights too burdensome? Another objection to social\nrights is that they are too burdensome on their dutybearers. It is\nvery expensive to guarantee to everyone basic education and minimal\nmaterial conditions of life. Frequently the claim that social rights\nare too burdensome uses other, less controversial human rights as a\nstandard of comparison, and suggests that social rights are\nsubstantially more burdensome or expensive than liberty rights.\nSuppose that we use as a basis of comparison liberty rights such as\nfreedom of communication, association, and movement. These rights\nrequire both respect and protection from governments. And people\ncannot be adequately protected in their enjoyment of liberties such as\nthese unless they also have security and due process rights. The costs\nof liberty, as it were, include the costs of law and criminal justice.\nOnce we see this, liberty rights start to look a lot more costly. \n\nFurther, we should not generally think of social rights as simply\ngiving everyone a free supply of the goods they protect. Guarantees of\nthings like food and housing will be intolerably expensive and will\nundermine productivity if everyone simply receives a free supply. A\nviable system of social rights will require most people to provide\nthese goods for themselves and their families through work as long as\nthey are given the necessary opportunities, education, and\ninfrastructure. Government-implemented social rights provide\nguarantees of availability (or \u201csecure access\u201d), but\ngovernments should have to supply the requisite goods in only a small\nfraction of cases. Note that education is often an exception to this\nsince many countries provide free public education irrespective of\nability to pay.\n\nCountries that do not accept and implement social rights still have to\nbear somehow the costs of providing for the needy since these\ncountries\u2014particularly if they recognize democratic rights of\npolitical participation\u2014are unlikely to find it tolerable to\nallow sizeable parts of the population to starve and be homeless. If\ngovernment does not supply food, clothing, and shelter to those unable\nto provide for themselves, then families, friends, and communities\nwill have to shoulder this burden. It is only in the last hundred or\nso years that government-sponsored social rights have taken over a\nsubstantial part of the burden of providing for the needy. The taxes\nassociated with social rights are partial replacements for other\nburdensome duties, namely the duties of families and communities to\nprovide adequate care for the unemployed, sick, disabled, and aged.\nDeciding whether to implement social rights is not a matter of\ndeciding whether to bear such burdens, but rather of deciding whether\nto continue with total reliance on a system of informal provision that\ndistributes assistance in a very spotty way and whose costs fall very\nunevenly on families, friends, and communities.\n\nAre social rights feasible worldwide? Another objection to\nsocial rights alleges that they are not feasible in many countries (on\nhow to understand feasibility see Gilabert 2009). It is very expensive\nto provide guarantees of subsistence, measures to protect and restore\npeople\u2019s health, and education. Many governments will be unable\nto provide these guarantees while meeting other important\nresponsibilities. Rights are not magical sources of supply (Holmes and\nSunstein 1999).\n\nAs we saw earlier, the Social Covenant dealt with the issue of\nfeasibility by calling for progressive implementation, that is,\nimplementation as financial and other resources permit. Does this view\nof implementation turn social rights into high-priority goals? And if\nso, is that a bad thing?\n\nStandards that outrun the abilities of many of their addressees are\ngood candidates for treatment as goals. Viewing them as largely\naspirational rather than as imposing immediate duties avoids problems\nof inability-based noncompliance. One may worry, however, that this is\ntoo much of a demotion for social rights because goals seem much\nweaker than rights. But goals can be formulated in ways that make them\nmore like rights. They can be assigned addressees (the parties who are\nto pursue the goal), beneficiaries, scopes that define the objective\nto be pursued, and a high level of priority (see Langford 2013 and\nNickel 2013; see also\n UN Human Rights and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals).\n Strong reasons for the importance of these goals can be provided. And\nsupervisory bodies can monitor levels of progress and pressure\nlow-performing addressees to attend to and work on their goals.\n\nTreating very demanding rights as goals has several advantages. One is\nthat proposed goals that greatly exceed our abilities are not so\nfarcical as proposed duties that do so. Creating grand lists of social\nrights that many countries cannot presently realize seems farcical to\nmany people. Perhaps this perceived lack of realism is reduced if we\nunderstand that these \u201crights\u201d are really goals that\ncountries should seriously promote. Goals coexist easily with low\nlevels of ability to achieve them. Another advantage is that goals are\nflexible: addressees with different levels of ability can choose ways\nof pursuing the goals that suit their circumstances and means. Because\nof these attractions it may be worth exploring sophisticated ways to\ntransform very demanding human rights into goals. The transformation\nmay be full or partial. It is possible to create right-goal mixtures\nthat contain some mandatory elements and that therefore seem more like\nreal rights (see Brems 2009). A right-goal mixture might include some\nrights-like goals, some mandatory steps to be taken immediately, and\nduties to realize the rights-like goals as quickly as possible. \n3.3 Rights of Women, Minorities, and Groups\n\nEquality of rights for historically disadvantaged or subordinated\ngroups is a longstanding concern of the human rights movement. Human\nrights documents repeatedly emphasize that all people,\nincluding women and members of minority ethnic and religious groups,\nhave equal human rights and should be able to enjoy them without\ndiscrimination. The right to freedom from discrimination figures\nprominently in the Universal Declaration and subsequent treaties. The\nCivil and Political Covenant, for example, commits participating\nstates to respect and protect their people\u2019s rights\n\u201cwithout distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex,\nlanguage, political or other opinion, national or social origin,\nproperty, birth, or social status\u201d (on minority and group rights\nsee Kymlicka 1995, Nickel 2007).\n\nA number of standard individual rights are especially important to\nethnic and religious minorities, including rights to freedom of\nassociation, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom\nfrom discrimination. Human rights documents also include rights that\nrefer to minorities explicitly and give them special protections. For\nexample, the Civil and Political Covenant in Article 27 says that\npersons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities\n\u201cshall not be denied the right, in community with other members\nof their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice\ntheir own religion, or to use their own language.\u201d\n\nFeminists have often protested that standard lists of human rights do\nnot sufficiently take into account the different risks faced by women\nand men. For example, issues like domestic violence, reproductive\nchoice, and trafficking of women and girls for sex work did not have a\nprominent place in early human rights documents and treaties. Lists of\nhuman rights have had to be expanded \u201cto include the degradation\nand violation of women\u201d (Bunch 2006, 58; see also Lockwood 2006\nand Okin 1998). Violations of women\u2019s human rights often occur\nin the home at the hands of other family members, not in the street at\nthe hands of the police. Most violence against women occurs in the\n\u201cprivate\u201d sphere. This has meant that governments cannot\nbe seen as the only addressees of human rights and that the right to\nprivacy of home and family needs qualifications to allow police to\nprotect women within the home.\n\nThe issue of how formulations of human rights should respond to\nvariations in the sorts of risks and dangers that different people\nface is difficult and arises not just in relation to gender but also\nin relation to age, profession, political affiliation, religion, and\npersonal interests. Due process rights, for example, are much more\nuseful to young people (and particularly young men) than they are to\nolder people since the latter are far less likely to run afoul of the\ncriminal law.\n\nSince 1964 the United Nations has mainly dealt with the rights of\nwomen and minorities through specialized treaties such as the\n International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\n (1965); the\n Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\n (1979); the\n Convention on the Rights of the Child\n (1989), and the\n Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n (2007). See also the\n Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\n (2007). Specialized treaties allow international norms to address\nunique problems of particular groups such as assistance and care\nduring pregnancy and childbearing in the case of women, custody issues\nin the case of children, and the loss of historic territories by\nindigenous peoples.\n\nMinority groups are often targets of violence. Human rights norms call\nupon governments to refrain from such violence and to provide\nprotections against it. This work is partly done by the right to life,\nwhich is a standard individual right. It is also done by the right\nagainst genocide which protects some groups from attempts to\ndestroy or decimate them. The Genocide Convention was one of\nthe first human rights treaties after World War II. The right against\ngenocide is clearly a group right. It is held by both individuals and\ngroups and provides protection to groups as groups. It is largely\nnegative in the sense that it requires governments and other agencies\nto refrain from destroying groups; but it also requires that legal and\nother protections against genocide be created at the national\nlevel.\n\nCan the right against genocide be a human right? More generally, can a\ngroup right fit the general idea of human rights proposed earlier? On\nthat conception, human rights are rights of all persons.\nPerhaps it can, however, if we broaden our conception of who can hold\nhuman rights to include important groups that people form and cherish\n(see the entry on\n group rights).\n This can be made more palatable, perhaps, by recognizing that the\nbeneficiaries of the right against genocide are individual humans who\nenjoy greater security against attempts to destroy the group to which\nthey belong (Kymlicka 1989).\n3.4 Environmental Rights\n\nIn spite of the danger of rights inflation, there are doubtless norms\nthat should be counted as human rights but are not generally\nrecognized as such. After all, there are lots of areas in which\npeople\u2019s dignity and fundamental interests are threatened by the\nactions and omissions of individuals and governments. Consider\nenvironmental rights, which are often defined to include rights of\nanimals or even of nature itself (see the entry on\n environmental ethics).\n Conceived in this broad way environmental rights don\u2019t have a\ngood fit with the general idea of human rights because the\nrightholders are not humans or human groups. \n\nAlternative formulations are possible, however. A basic environmental\nhuman right can be understood as requiring maintenance and restoration\nof an environment that is safe for human life and health. Many\ncountries have environmental rights of this sort in their\nconstitutional bills of rights (Hayward 2005). And the European\nUnion\u2019s Bill of Rights, the\n Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\n includes in Article 37 an environmental protection norm: \u201cA high\nlevel of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality\nof the environment must be integrated into the policies of the Union\nand ensured in accordance with the principle of sustainable\ndevelopment.\u201d \n\nA human right to a safe environment or to environmental protection\ndoes not directly address issues such as the claims of animals or\nbiodiversity, although it might do so indirectly using the idea of\necosystem services to humans (see\n Biodiversity and Human Rights.\n A justification for a human right to a safe environment should show\nthat environmental problems pose serious threats to fundamental human\ninterests, values, or norms; that governments may appropriately be\nburdened with the responsibility of protecting people against these\nthreats; and that most governments actually have the ability to do\nthis. \n\nClimate change is currently a major environmental threat to many\npeople\u2019s lives and health, and hence it is unsurprising that\nhuman rights approaches to climate change have been developed and\nadvocated in recent decades (see Bodansky 2011, Gardiner 2013, and\n UN Human Rights and Climate Change).\n One approach, advocated by Steve Vanderheiden accepts the idea of a\nhuman right to an environment that is adequate for human life and\nhealth and derives from this broad right a more specific right to a\nstable climate (Vanderheiden 2008). Another approach, advocated by\nSimon Caney, does not require introducing a new environmental right.\nIt suggests instead that serious action to reduce and mitigate climate\nchange is required by already well-established human rights because\nsevere climate change will violate many people\u2019s rights to life,\nfood, and health (Caney 2010). One could expand this approach by\narguing that severe climate change should be reduced and mitigated\nbecause it will cause massive human migrations and other crises that\nwill undermine the abilities of many governments to uphold human\nrights (for evaluation of these arguments see Bell 2013). \n4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices\n\nTwo familiar philosophical worries about human rights are that they\nare based on moral beliefs that are culturally relative and that their\ncreation and advocacy involves ethnocentrism. Human rights prescribe\nuniversal standards in areas such as security, law enforcement,\nequality, political participation, and education. The peoples and\ncountries of planet Earth are, however, enormously varied in their\npractices, traditions, religions, and levels of economic and political\ndevelopment. Putting these two propositions together may be enough to\njustify the worry that universal human rights do not sufficiently\naccommodate the diversity of Earth\u2019s peoples. A theoretical\nexpression of this worry is \u201crelativism,\u201d the idea that\nethical, political, and legal standards for a particular country or\nregion are mostly shaped by the traditions, beliefs, and conditions of\nthat country or region (see the entry on\n moral relativism).\n The anthropologist William G. Sumner, writing in 1906, asserted that\n\u201cthe mores can make anything right and prevent condemnation of\nanything\u201d (Sumner 1906).\n\nRelativists sometimes accuse human rights advocates of ethnocentrism,\narrogance, and cultural imperialism (Talbott 2005). Ethnocentrism is\nthe assumption, usually unconscious, that \u201cone\u2019s own group\nis the center of everything\u201d and that its beliefs, practices,\nand norms provide the standards by which other groups are\n\u201cscaled and rated\u201d (Sumner 1906; see also Etinson 2018 who\nargues that ethnocentrism is best understood as a kind of cultural\nbias rather than as a belief in cultural superiority). Ethnocentrism\ncan lead to arrogance and intolerance in dealings with other\ncountries, ethical systems, and religions. Finally, cultural\nimperialism occurs when the economically, technologically, and\nmilitarily strongest countries impose their beliefs, values, and\ninstitutions on the rest of the world. Relativists often combine these\ncharges with a prescription, namely that tolerance of varied practices\nand traditions ought to be instilled and practiced through measures\nthat include extended learning about other cultures.\n\nThe conflict between relativists and human rights advocates may be\npartially based on differences in their underlying philosophical\nbeliefs, particularly in metaethics. Relativists are often\nsubjectivists or noncognitivists and think of morality as entirely\nsocially constructed and transmitted. In contrast,\nphilosophically-inclined human rights advocates are more likely to\nadhere to or presuppose cognitivism,\n moral realism,\n and\n intuitionism.\n\nDuring the drafting in 1947 of the Universal Declaration, the\nExecutive Board of the American Anthropological Association warned of\nthe danger that the Declaration would be \u201ca statement of rights\nconceived only in terms of the values prevalent in Western Europe and\nAmerica.\u201d Perhaps the main concern of the AAA Board in the\nperiod right after World War II was to condemn the intolerant\ncolonialist attitudes of the day and to advocate cultural and\npolitical self-determination. But the Board also made the stronger\nassertion that \u201cstandards and values are relative to the culture\nfrom which they derive\u201d and thus \u201cwhat is held to be a\nhuman right in one society may be regarded as anti-social by another\npeople\u201d\n (American Anthropological Association Statement on Human Rights 1947).\n\nThis is not, of course, the stance of most anthropologists today.\nCurrently the American Anthropological Association has a\n Committee on Human Rights\n whose objectives include promoting and protecting human rights and\ndeveloping an anthropological perspective on human rights. While still\nemphasizing the importance of cultural differences, anthropologists\nnow often support cultural survival and the protection of vulnerable\ncultures, non-discrimination, and the rights and land claims of\nindigenous peoples.\n\nThe idea that relativism and exposure to other cultures promote\ntolerance may be correct from a psychological perspective. People who\nare sensitive to differences in beliefs, practices, and traditions,\nand who are suspicious of the grounds for extending norms across\nborders, may be more inclined to be tolerant of other countries and\npeoples than those who believe in an objective universal morality.\nStill, philosophers have been generally critical of attempts to argue\nfrom relativism to a prescription of tolerance (Talbott 2005). If the\nculture and religion of one country has long fostered intolerant\nattitudes and practices, and if its citizens and officials act\nintolerantly towards people from other countries, they are simply\nfollowing their own traditions and cultural norms. They are just doing\nwhat relativists think people mostly do. Accordingly, a relativist\nfrom a tolerant country will be hard-pressed to find a basis for\ncriticizing the citizens and officials of the intolerant country. To\ndo so the relativist will have to endorse a transcultural principle of\ntolerance and to advocate as an outsider cultural change in the\ndirection of greater tolerance. Because of this, relativists who are\ndeeply committed to tolerance may find themselves attracted to a\nqualified commitment to human rights.\n\nEast Asia is the region of the world that participates least in the\ninternational human rights system\u2014even though some important\nEast Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea do participate. In\nthe 1990s Singapore\u2019s Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and others\nargued that international human rights as found in United Nations\ndeclarations and treaties were insensitive to distinctive \u201cAsian\nvalues\u201d such as prizing families and community (in contrast to\nstrong individualism); putting social harmony over personal freedom;\nrespect for political leaders and institutions; and emphasizing\nresponsibility, hard work, and thriftiness as means of social progress\n(on the Asian Values debate see Bauer and Bell 1999; Bell 2000; Sen\n1997; and Twining 2009). Proponents of the Asian values idea did not\nwish to abolish all human rights; they rather wanted to deemphasize\nsome families of human rights, particularly the fundamental freedoms\nand rights of democratic participation (and in some cases the rights\nof women). They also wanted Western governments and NGOs to stop\ncriticizing them for human rights violations in these areas.\n\nAt the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, countries\nincluding Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Iran advocated\naccommodations within human rights practice for cultural and economic\ndifferences. Western representatives tended to view the position of\nthese countries as excuses for repression and authoritarianism. The\nConference responded by approving the\n Vienna Declaration.\n It included in Article 5 the assertion that countries should not pick\nand choose among human rights: \u201cAll human rights are universal,\nindivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international\ncommunity must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner,\non the same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the\nsignificance of national and regional particularities and various\nhistorical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind,\nit is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and\ncultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the debate about relativism and human rights has become\nobsolete. In recent decades widespread acceptance of human rights has\noccurred in most parts of the world. Three quarters of the\nworld\u2019s countries have ratified the major human rights treaties,\nand many countries in Africa, the Americas, and Europe participate in\nregional human rights regimes that have international courts (see\nGeorgetown University Human Rights Law Research Guide in the Other\nInternet Resources below). Further, all of the world\u2019s countries\nnow use similar political institutions (law, courts, legislatures,\nexecutives, militaries, bureaucracies, police, prisons, taxation, and\npublic schools) and these institutions carry with them characteristic\nproblems and abuses (Donnelly 2003). Finally, globalization has\ndiminished the differences among peoples. Today\u2019s world is not\nthe one that early anthropologists and missionaries found. National\nand cultural boundaries are breached not just by international trade\nbut also by millions of travelers and migrants, electronic\ncommunications, international law covering many areas, and the efforts\nof international governmental and non-governmental organizations.\nInternational influences and organizations are everywhere and\ncountries borrow freely and regularly from each other\u2019s\ninventions and practices.\n\nWorldwide polls on attitudes towards human rights are now available\nand they show broad support for human rights and international efforts\nto promote them. Empirical research can now replace or supplement\ntheoretical speculations about how much disagreement on human rights\nexists worldwide. A December 2011 report by the\n Council on Foreign Relations\n surveyed recent international opinion polls on human rights that\nprobe agreement and disagreement with propositions such as\n\u201cPeople have the right to express any opinion,\u201d\n\u201cPeople of all faiths can practice their religion freely,\u201d\n\u201cWomen should have the same rights as men,\u201d \u201cPeople\nof different races [should be] treated equally,\u201d and governments\n\u201cshould be responsible for ensuring that [their] citizens can\nmeet their basic need for food.\u201d Big majorities of those polled\nin countries such as Argentina, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iran,\nKenya, Nigeria, China, India, and Indonesia gave affirmative answers.\nFurther, large majorities (on average 70%) in all the countries polled\nsupported UN efforts to promote the human rights set out in the\nUniversal Declaration. Unfortunately, popular acceptance of human\nrights ideas has not, however, prevented a recent slide in many of\nthese same countries towards authoritarianism.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Bibliography: Books and Articles in the Philosophy of Human Rights", "Recent Collections"], "cat_ref_text": {"Bibliography: Books and Articles in the Philosophy of Human Rights": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ashford, E., 2015, \u201cA Moral Inconsistency Argument for a Basic\nHuman Right to Subsistence,\u201d in Cruft, R., Liao, S., and Renzo, M.\n(eds.), <em>Philosophical Foundations of Human Rights</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "Beetham, D., 1995, \u201cWhat Future for Economic and Social\nRights?\u201d, <em>Political Studies</em>, 43: 41\u201360.", "Beitz, C., 2015, \u201cThe Force of Subsistence Rights,\u201d in Cruft,\nR., Liao, S., and Renzo, M.
