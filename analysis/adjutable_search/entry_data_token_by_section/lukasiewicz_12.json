    "main_text": "History of Logic || Aristotle\n6.2 Aristotle\n\nIn \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s logic textbook of 1929, after treating\npropositional calculus he does not go on, as one would nowadays, to\nexpound predicate logic, but gives a brief formal account of\nAristotle\u2019s categorical (non-modal) syllogistic, presupposing\ntwelve theorems of propositional calculus. This foreshadowed his 1951\nbook, Aristotle\u2019s Syllogistic, by 22 years. This book,\nwhich revolutionized the study of Aristotle\u2019s logic, had a long\nand interrupted genesis. A talk on the subject given at Krak\u00f3w\nin 1939 was published in Polish only in 1946. In 1939 \u0141ukasiewicz\nprepared a Polish monograph, but the partial proofs and manuscript\nwere destroyed in the bombing of Warsaw. In 1949 he was invited to\nlecture on Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic at University College Dublin,\nand those lectures formed the basis of the book, completed in 1950 and\npublished the following year, his first in English. The first edition\ndealt only with categorical syllogistic. For the second edition,\ncompleted in 1955, less than a year before his death, \u0141ukasiewicz\nadded three chapters on the modal syllogistic, employing the modal\nlogic \u0141 that he had developed in the meantime. The second edition\nwas proof-read and indexed by Lejewski, and appeared in 1957.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s understanding of Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic is based on two specific interpretative principles and a\ngeneral attitude. The first principle is that Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogisms are not, as had traditionally been supposed, inference\nschemata, of the form \u2018p, q, therefore\nr\u2019, but conditional propositions of the form \u2018if\np and q, then r\u2019. This leads\ndirectly into the second principle, which is that there is behind the\nsyllogistic treatment of term logic a deeper logic, that of\npropositions, and in particular a logic of opposition,\n\u2018and\u2019 and \u2018if\u2019, as well as (in modal\nsyllogistic) \u2018necessarily\u2019 and \u2018possibly\u2019.\n\u0141ukasiewicz takes this propositional basis to be occasionally\ninvoked by Aristotle, for instance in the treatment of indirect\nproofs, but for the most part left as tacit, and he therefore regards\nit as legitimate to criticise Aristotle (unlike the Stoics) for not\nexplicitly formulating the underlying propositional logic.\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trenchant and controversial views sparked a\ncontroversy over how to interpret the syllogistic. While the\nprinciples did win an early adherent in Patzig (1968), subsequent\ncriticisms by Corcoran (1972, 1974) and, independently, Smiley (1974)\nestablished clearly that syllogisms are not propositions but\ninferences, and that Aristotle had no need of a prior logic of\npropositions. That view is now universal among scholars of\nAristotle\u2019s logic. In retrospect, it appears that\n\u0141ukasiewicz was keen to wish onto Aristotle his own (Fregean)\nview of logic as a system of theorems based on a propositional\nlogic.\n\nThe general attitude, present throughout \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\ntreatment, is that Aristotle\u2019s work is of sufficient precision\nand stature to warrant and withstand exposition using the most\nrigorous modern logical methods and concepts. In other words, the\ndevelopment of modern logic, while it may highlight lacunae and\ndeficits of Aristotle\u2019s logic, in fact brings out its merits,\ninnovations and genius more clearly than previous traditional or\nphilological studies. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s attitude has prevailed\nand is now pervasive among those studying Aristotle\u2019s logic,\nwhether or not they agree with his specific interpretative\nprinciples.\n\nAfter an exposition of the basics of Aristotle\u2019s treatment of\nsyllogistic, in which he criticises earlier commentators and notes\nthat Aristotle originated the method of rejected forms in order to\nshow not just which are the valid syllogisms but also to prove the\ninvalid forms to be such, \u0141ukasiewicz presents his formalization\nof categorical syllogistic, based on the following logical\nexpressions\n\n\n\nExpression\nMeaning \n\n\\(Aab\\)\nAll \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) (or \\(b\\) belongs to all \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Eab\\)\nNo \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) (or \\(b\\) belongs to no \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Iab\\)\nSome \\(a\\) is \\(b\\) (or \\(b\\) belongs to some \\(a\\)) \n\n\\(Oab\\)\nSome \\(a\\) is not \\(b\\) (or \\(b\\) does not belong to some\n\\(a\\))  \n\n\nTaking \\(A\\) and \\(I\\) as primitive and defining \\(E = NI\\) and \\(O =\nNA\\), the axioms, added to propositional calculus, are\n\n\n\n\\(\\vdash Aaa\\)\n\u00a0 \n\n\\(\\vdash Iaa\\)\n\u00a0 \n\n\\(\\vdash CKAbcAabAac\\)\n(Barbara in the first figure) \n\n\\(\\vdash CKAbcIbaIac\\)\n(Datisi in the second figure) \n\n\n\ntogether with modus ponens and a substitution rule for term variables.\nThis in fact was the system that \u0141ukasiewicz had put forward in\nhis 1929 textbook. As the second axiom indicates, \u0141ukasiewicz is\nhere following Aristotle in assuming that all terms denote. Rejected\nforms can be added: \u0141ukasiewicz gives from the second figure\n\n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& \\dashv CKAcbAabIac & \\text{and}\\\\\n & \\dashv CKEcbEabIAc & \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nwhich together with detachment and substitution for rejection deliver\nall Aristotle\u2019s 232 rejected moods. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nverdict on Aristotle\u2019s categorical syllogistic is, that despite\nits narrowness, it is \u201ca system the exactness of which surpasses\neven the exactness of a mathematical theory, and this is its\neverlasting merit.\u201d (AS, 131)\n\nThe modal syllogistic on the other hand is little studied, according\nto \u0141ukasiewicz, both because it falls well below the standards of\nperfection of the categorical, and for lack of a \u201cuniversally\nacceptable system of modal logic\u201d, which \u0141ukasiewicz takes\nhimself, with \u0141, now to have provided. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nown treatment falls short of being definitive, though it provides\nmaterial for later studies, and we shall not pursue it here.\nInterestingly, in Aristotle\u2019s attempts in Book I, Chapter 15 of\nthe Prior Analytics, to establish the theses \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& CCpqCLpLq \\\\\n & CCpqCMpMq \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz sees an Aristotelian endorsement for the idea of a\nprinciple of extensionality for modal operators as well as for\ncategorical ones.\n",
