They argue that these accounts of technology, and\nthe technology/society relationship, posit technology and society as\nif speaking about the one does not immediately and already draw upon\nthe other for its ongoing sense or meaning. For the phenomenologist\nsociety and technology co-constitute each other from the very start;\nthey are each other\u2019s ongoing condition or possibility for being\nwhat they are. For them technology is not just the artifact,\n\u2018out there\u2019 as it were. Rather, for them the artifact\nalready emerges from a prior \u2018technological\u2019 attitude\ntowards the world (Heidegger 1977), or is indeed already the\nconstitutive possibility for the human to be human as such (Stiegler,\n1998, 2009). For example, as the already technologically oriented\nhuman beings that we are, we will tend to conceive communication as a\nproblem requiring a technological solution. Thus, technology is\nalready the outcome of a technological way of looking and relating\nourselves to the world. Once in place technology allows the world to\n\u2018show up\u2019 in particular ways (Introna and Ilharco 2003).\nFor example you are a different person to me with a mobile phone than\nwithout one. With a mobile phone you become disclosed, or show up, as\n\u2018contactable\u2019, \u2018within reach\u2019 as it were. It\nis this way of thinking about information technology, as co-original\nwith the human, and as a horizon of meaning and action, that we want\nto elaborate further before we can elaborate how these various ways of\nconceptualizing technology shape our views on the social and ethical\nimplications of such technologies. Before proceeding it should be\nnoted that the most recent work of Bruno Latour (2002, 2005) suggests\nthat he has taken up many of the insights of phenomenology in his\nongoing work. Thus, the later Latour (2002, 2005) can be seen as a\nbridging figure between the constructivist tradition and the\nphenomenological tradition (for more detailed arguments in this regard\nrefer to Graham Harman\u2019s (2009) book on Latour\u2019s\nmetaphysical ground). \n",
