    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n \nMichael Oakeshott\u2019s father, Joseph Oakeshott, was a member\nof the Fabian Society, a socialist but not radical organization (its\nsymbol was the tortoise), many of whose members participated in\nestablishing the British Labor Party. The Society\u2019s leaders,\nBeatrice and Sidney Webb, were among the founders of the London School\nof Economics. The younger Oakeshott studied history at Gonville and\nCaius College, Cambridge, in the early 1920s and became a life fellow\nin 1925. After serving in the British Army between 1940 and 1945, he\nreturned to Cambridge, then taught briefly at Nuffield College,\nOxford, before becoming Professor of Political Science at the LSE in\n1951. At some point during his years at the LSE he launched an annual\ncourse of lectures in the history of political thought. Focused\ninitially on canonical authors and texts, after the fashion of the\nlectures he delivered at Harvard in 1958 (Oakeshott 1993b), the course\ngradually became a more comprehensive examination of the political\nexperience and thought of four peoples: the ancient Greeks, the\nRomans, medieval Christians, and modern Europeans (Oakeshott 2006). He\nalso led a seminar in the history of political thought for\npostgraduate students and, as an emeritus professor, was active in it\nuntil 1980, contributing papers on the historical study of political\nthought and the philosophy of history. Brief accounts of\nOakeshott\u2019s life can be found in two memorial collections\n(Norman 1993; Marsh 2001) and a biographical essay (Grant 2012). The\nnotebooks Oakeshott kept for much of his life (Oakeshott 2014) offer\nadditional insights, as do his unpublished letters.\n\n\nAlthough Oakeshott criticized the postwar Labor government\u2019s\nbelief in planning, in his youth he thought of himself as a\nsocialist. But it was a romantic socialism concerned with spiritual\ntransformation, not economic redistribution (L. O\u2019Sullivan\n2014). And though he later repudiated Fabianism, Marxism, and other\nleft-wing ideologies, the late Oakeshott still sympathized with the\nanarchism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, sharing the latter\u2019s vision\nof a liberal order combining community and equality with individuality\nand independence. His reputation as a conservative thinker was\nsubstantially shaped by his trenchant essays on the limits of reason\nin political life, collected as Rationalism in Politics and Other\nEssays (first edition 1962, cited hereafter as RP). On\nthe basis of these essays he has been compared to a host of\nconservative figures from Burke to Wittgenstein. Others argue that he\nis better characterized as a liberal. As a theorist of the rule of\nlaw, he invites comparison with Friedrich Hayek and Carl Schmitt. But\nefforts to label Oakeshott as either conservative or liberal founder\nnot only on the ambiguities of those terms but on the partisanship\nthey imply: Oakeshott was emphatically not politically engaged. As he\nprovocatively informed those attending the twentieth-anniversary\ncelebration of the National Review in 1975, the Right\u2019s\ndifferences with the Left were a petty squabble over how the spoils of\nthe state as a corporate enterprise were to be distributed\n(RP 459). To grasp the philosophical significance of\nOakeshott\u2019s thought one must move beyond the vocabulary of\ntwentieth-century political dispute.\n\n\nIn his first book, Experience and Its Modes (1933, cited as\nEM), Oakeshott barely mentions politics. But this does not\nmean that he was not interested in political philosophy when he wrote\nit. The book grew out of his Cambridge lectures from the late 1920s,\n\u201cThe Philosophical Approach to Politics\u201d, now included in\nEarly Political Writings (Oakeshott 2010). In these lectures\nhe distinguishes different ways of thinking about politics, but in the\nbook these different ways of thinking are detached from the subject of\npolitics and presented as general modes of experience. By the time he\nwrote Experience and Its Modes, Oakeshott had come to believe\nthat political philosophy was necessarily defective\u2014that it was\nlimited by its commitment to a pre-philosophically demarcated sphere\nof experience and therefore not genuine philosophy. The book is a\nhighly individual performance in the style of British philosophical\nIdealism, written at a time when that approach to philosophy was\nrapidly going out of fashion. In it, Oakeshott credits the influence\nof Hegel, Bradley, and Bosanquet, but it was evident that he had\nabsorbed their views \u201cinto an insistent literary personality\nwhich moved freely and suggestively in many types of literature\u201d\n(Cowling 2003: 256). When Oakeshott took up politics again in the late\n1930\u2019s, it was in relation to the controversies of the day. At\nthe urging of the Cambridge political scientist Ernest Barker, and\npartly motivated by the hope it would gain him a professorship, he\ncompiled an anthology of texts expounding the \u201cdoctrines\u201d\nof contemporary Europe: Representative Democracy, Catholicism,\nCommunism, Fascism, and National Socialism (Oakeshott 1939). His first\npostwar publication was an edition of Hobbes\u2019s\nLeviathan, with an influential introduction later published\ntogether with other essays on Hobbes in Hobbes on Civil\nAssociation (Oakeshott 1975b). In 1947 he founded the\nCambridge Journal, a short-lived but critically esteemed\nvehicle treating politics and culture as topics for civilized\nconversation rather than ideological polemics or academic\nresearch. Several of the essays reprinted in Rationalism in\nPolitics first appeared there.\n\n\nOakeshott\u2019s magnum opus, On Human Conduct (1975a, cited\nas OHC) appeared late in his career. It was greeted in some\nquarters with incomprehension and in others with hostility, but mostly\nwith silence. Even those who judged the book important found its style\nforbidding, and its impact has been muted. Also difficult are the\nthree late essays on the philosophy of history included in On\nHistory and Other Essays (1983, cited as OH). His essays\non the idea of liberal education and its practical implications,\ncollected in The Voice of Liberal Learning (1989, cited as\nVLL), are more accessible and continue to receive attention\n(Williams 2007; Backhurst and Fairfield 2016). After Oakeshott\u2019s\ndeath other writings appeared, first in a series of volumes published\nby Yale University Press (Oakeshott 1993a, 1993b, and 1996) and then\nin a series from Imprint Academic (Oakeshott 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008,\n2010, and 2014). There has also been a steady stream of secondary\nworks, including two companion volumes (Franco and Marsh 2012;\nPodoksik 2012). Comparison with philosophical\ncontemporaries\u2014Collingwood, Wittgenstein, Schmitt, Strauss,\nHayek, Gadamer, Arendt, Foucault, MacIntyre\u2014offers another angle\nfrom which to view his place in twentieth-century thought (Dyzenhaus\nand Poole 2015; Plotica 2015; N. O\u2019Sullivan 2017). This\nliterature, together with the attention his less accessible writings\nare starting to receive, suggests that Oakeshott occupies an\nincreasingly secure place in the history of philosophy and political\nthought.\n",
