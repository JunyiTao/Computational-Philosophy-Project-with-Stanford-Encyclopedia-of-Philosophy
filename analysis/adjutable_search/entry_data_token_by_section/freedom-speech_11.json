    "main_text": "Back to the Harm Principle\n5. Back to the Harm Principle\n\nWe began this examination of free speech with the harm principle; let\nus end with it. The principle suggests that we need to distinguish\nbetween legal sanction and social disapprobation as means of limiting\nspeech. As already noted, the latter does not ban speech but it makes\nit more uncomfortable to utter unpopular statements. Mill does not\nseem to support the imposition of legal penalties unless they are\nsanctioned by the harm principle. As one would expect, he also seems\nto be worried by the use of social pressure as a means of limiting\nspeech. Chapter III of On Liberty is an incredible assault on\nsocial censorship, expressed through the tyranny of the majority,\nbecause he claims it produces stunted, pinched, hidebound and withered\nindividuals: \u201ceveryone lives as under the eye of a hostile and\ndreaded censorship\u2026[i]t does not occur to them to have any\ninclination except what is customary\u201d (1978, 58). He\ncontinues:\n\nthe general tendency of things throughout the world is to render\nmediocrity the ascendant power among mankind\u2026at present\nindividuals are lost in the crowd\u2026the only power deserving the\nname is that of masses\u2026[i]t does seem, however, that when the\nopinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or\nbecoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that\ntendency would be the more and more pronounced individuality of those\nwho stand on the higher eminences of thought. (1978, 63\u20134)\n\n\nWith these comments, and many others, Mill demonstrates his distaste\nof the apathetic, fickle, tedious, frightened and dangerous majority.\nIt is quite a surprise, therefore, to find that he also seems to\nembrace a fairly encompassing offense principle when the sanction does\ninvolve social disapprobation:\n\nAgain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious\nonly to the agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted,\nbut which, if done publicly, are a violation of good manners and,\ncoming thus within the category of offenses against others,\nmay rightly be prohibited. (1978, 97 author's emphasis)\n\n\nSimilarly, he states that \u201cThe liberty of the individual must be\nthus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance\u201d (1978,\n53). In the latter parts of On Liberty Mill also suggests\nthat distasteful people can be held in contempt, that we can avoid\nthem(as long as we do not parade it), that we can warn others about\nthem, and that we can persuade, cajole and remonstrate with those we\ndeem offensive. These actions are legitimate as the free expression of\nanyone who happens to be offended as long as they are done as a\nspontaneous response to the person's faults and not as a form of\npunishment.\n\nBut those who exhibit cruelty, malice, envy, insincerity, resentment\nand crass egoism are open to the greater sanction of disapprobation as\na form of punishment, because these faults are wicked and\nother-regarding. It may be true that these faults have an impact on\nothers, but it is difficult to see how acting according to malice,envy\nor resentment necessarily violates the rights of others. The\nonly way that Mill can make such claims is to incorporate an offense\nprinciple and hence give up on the harm principle as the only\nlegitimate grounds for interference with behavior. Overall, Mill's\narguments about ostracism and disapprobation seem to provide little\nprotection for the individual who may have spoken in a non-harmful\nmanner but who has nevertheless offended the sensibilities of the\nmasses.\n\nHence we see that one of the great defenders of the harm principle\nseems to shy away from it at certain crucial points; even Mill was\nunable to mount a defense of free speech on this \u201cone simple\nprinciple\u201d alone. It does, however, remain a crucial part of the\nliberal defense of individual freedom. \n",
