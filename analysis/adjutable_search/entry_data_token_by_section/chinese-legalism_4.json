    "main_text": "Philosophical Foundations || Evolutionary view of History\n2.1 Evolutionary view of History\n\nThe Warring States period was an age of comprehensive sociopolitical\nchange, and thinkers of different intellectual affiliations had to\ncome to terms with this change. The majority tried to accommodate it\nwithin the framework of the \u201cchanging with the times\u201d\nparadigm (Kern 2000: 170\u2013174). Namely, certain innovations and\nmodifications of existent policies are inevitable, but these do not\nrequire a radical overhaul of the current sociopolitical system, and\ndo not undermine the usefulness of the past as a guideline for the\npresent. The fa thinkers, by contrast, readily dispensed with\ntraditional modes of rule; they questioned the very relevance of the\npast to the present. They dismissed \u201cthe assumption that despite\nthe difference between past and present there remains a fundamental\ncorrespondence between them,\u201d promoting instead the idea of\n\u201csequential history\u201d which justified radical departures\nfrom earlier sociopolitical patterns (Vogelsang, forthcoming). Their\nattack on supporters of emulating the past was twofold. First, there\nwas simply no uniform model of orderly rule in the past to be\nconformed to. Second, and more importantly, society evolves, and this\nevolution turns behavioral modes, institutions, and even values of the\npast obsolete.\n\nThe first of these arguments is presented in chapter 1,\n\u201cRevising the laws,\u201d of the Book of Lord Shang.\nShang Yang argues: \n\n\nFormer generations did not adopt the same teaching: So which antiquity\nshould one imitate? Thearchs and Monarchs did not repeat one another:\nSo which rituals should one conform to? ... There is no single way to\norder the generation; to benefit the state, one need not imitate\nantiquity. (Book of Lord Shang 1.4)\n\n\nHan Fei adds another reason for dismissing the past models: we simply\ncannot verify exactly what they were. Those who claim the authority of\nantiquity\u2014such as adherents of Confucius and Mozi\u2014cannot\nagree which lessons of the past are to be applied in the present: \n\n\nHe who claims certain knowledge without examining the issue is a fool;\nhe who relies on things which are impossible to ascertain is an\nimpostor. Thus, those who openly adduce the former monarchs as\nevidence and claim they can determine indubitably [the way of the\nparagon legendary rulers] Yao and Shun, are either fools or impostors.\n(Han Feizi 50.1, \u201cIllustrious teachings\u201d)\n\n\nYet having postulated the impossibility of learning from the past\nmodels, Shang Yang and Han Fei propose an alternative lesson that can\nbe learnt: that changing circumstances may require not a piecemeal but\na comprehensive readjustment of the sociopolitical system. To\ndemonstrate the magnitude of change in the past, both thinkers turn to\nremotest antiquity, and trace how the state was formed. For instance,\nShang Yang presents the story of social evolution from primeval\npromiscuous life to an incipient stratified society and then to a\nfully mature state with laws, regulations, officials, and the power of\ncoercion (Book of Lord Shang 7.1, \u201cOpening the\nblocked\u201d). At the earlier stages of human history, the people\ncould be constrained by moral suasion; yet this was only because that\nwas the age of relative abundance. Han Fei further explains: in the\nremote past \u201cthe people were few whereas goods were plenty;\nhence people did not compete.\u201d Yet this age of primeval morality\nhas gone forever because of the devastating impact of demographic\ngrowth: \u201cNowadays, five children are not considered too many,\nand each child also has five children; the grandfather is still alive,\nand he already has twenty-five grandchildren. Therefore, the people\nare plenty whereas commodities and goods are few; people work\nlaboriously, but provisions are scanty; hence the people\ncompete\u201d (Han Feizi 49.2, \u201cFive vermin\u201d).\nUnder these new circumstances, moral norms are no longer sufficient to\ncontrol social contention; it can be quelled only through\ncoercion.\n\nThe evolutionary view of history and especially the understanding that\nmaterial conditions can alter moral values, distinguish the\nfa thinkers critically from proponents of alternative models\nof state formation (Pines 2013a). The fa texts imply that\neverything is changeable: as socioeconomic conditions change, human\nbehavior changes as well; and this in turn requires adaptation of\npolitical institutions. Shang Yang summarizes:\n\n\nWhen the affairs of the world change, one should implement a different\nWay. \u2026 Therefore, it is said: \u201cWhen the people are\nignorant, one can become monarch through knowledge; when the\ngeneration is knowledgeable, one can become monarch through\nforce.\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 7.1\u20137.2,\n\u201cOpening the blocked\u201d)\n\n\nThe last phrase represents the rationale behind Shang Yang\u2019s\nmodel of state formation. If radical restructuring of society was\nlegitimate in the past, so it is in the present. In the current\nsituation, when the people are \u201cknowledgeable,\u201d a powerful\nstate, which is able to coerce its subjects, is the only viable\nsolution. The Book of Lord Shang (but not Han Feizi)\nallowed for the possibility that in the future the need for excessive\nreliance on coercion would end, and a milder, morality-driven\npolitical structure would evolve; but these utopian digressions are of\nminor importance in the text (Pines 2013a). Unlike supporters of\nhistorical progress in the Occident, the fa thinkers never\ndeveloped a philosophy of history, nor the idea of its telos\n(Vogelsang, forthcoming). What mattered for them was the bottom line:\nradical reforms were inevitable in the past; and they are inevitable\nin the present.\n",
