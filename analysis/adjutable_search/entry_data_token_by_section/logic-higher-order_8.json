    "main_text": "The Infamous Power of Second-Order Logic || Does second-order logic depend on the Axiom of Choice?\n5.4 Does second-order logic depend on the Axiom of Choice?\n\nThe Axiom of Choice (AC) is a philosophical puzzle in the foundations\nof mathematics. Roughly speaking, this axiom, that originally emerged\nin set theory, says that if we have a set \\(A\\) of non-empty disjoint\nsets, then we can form a new set \\(B\\) which contains exactly one\nelement from each set in \\(A\\). What can be seen as a problem is the\nfact that when \\(A\\) is infinite, forming the set \\(B\\) seems to\nrequire making an infinite number of choices. See entry on\n Axiom of Choice\n for a thorough definition and discussion. On the one hand the Axiom\nof Choice seems magic, for example when it implies that the wildest\nsets have a well-ordering. On the other hand it seems innocuous, for\nexample when it implies that the Cartesian product of a family of\nnon-empty sets is non-empty. The Axiom of Choice is typically used to\nconstruct odd \u201cparadoxical\u201d sets, such as a non-Lebesgue\nmeasurable set of real numbers, a well-ordering of the real numbers, a\nparadoxical decomposition of the sphere (see entry on\n set theory),\n and so on. Such sets are usually in one sense or another undefinable.\nFor example, a non-Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers\nhas to be undefinable in second-order logic over\n\\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\), if there are sufficiently large cardinals (see the\nentry on\n large cardinals and determinacy).\n\nThe puzzling Axiom of Choice arises also in the middle of second-order\nlogic: Let \\(\\theta\\) be the sentence  \n\n\\[\n\\forall X(\\forall x\\,\\exists y\\,X(x,y)\\to\\exists F\\,\\forall x\\,X(x,F(x))).\n\\]\n\n\nThen \\(\\oR\\models\\theta\\) essentially says that if a binary relation\n\\(X\\) relates to each \\(x\\in\\oR\\) a non-empty set \\(\\{y\\in\\oR :\nX(x,y\\}\\), then there is a function \\(F\\) which chooses for each\n\\(x\\in\\oR\\) some \\(y=F(x)\\) such that \\(X(x,y)\\). In set theory this\nis one of many equivalent ways of saying that the Axiom of Choice\nholds for (continuum size) families of subsets of \\(\\oR\\). The basic\ntenet of second-order logic is that \u201call\u201d properties of\nelements of a fixed domain exist and we can quantify over them. In\nset-theoretical terms this means that all subsets, definable or not,\nof a set of any cardinality exists and we can quantify over them. In\nthis spirit the Axiom of Choice seems innocent and is usually accepted\nin the literature of second-order logic.\n\nBy Cohen\u2019s results (1966) there are N and \\(N'\\)\nsatisfying the axioms of ZF (without the Axiom of Choice) such that\n\u201c\\(\\oN\\models\\theta\\)\u201d holds in N but does not hold\nin \\(N'\\). This is a further demonstration of the dependence of the\nsemantics of second-order logic on the metatheory.\n\n\n",
