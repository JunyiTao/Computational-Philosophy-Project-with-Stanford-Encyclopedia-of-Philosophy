    "main_text": "Quinean Epistemology || More Complex Forms of Cognitive Language\n4.3 More Complex Forms of Cognitive Language\n\nQuine\u2019s treatment of more sophisticated parts of language is\nnotably sketchier and more speculative than his detailed discussion of\nobservation sentences. In part this may be because he holds that it is\nmost important to understand the very first step into cognitive\nlanguage, how such language is possible at all. It may also be that\nthe difficulty of getting a satisfactory account of observation\nsentences impeded him.\n\nBeyond these points, however, there is, from a Quinean perspective, a\nlimit to how detailed an account we should expect to have of the\nacquisition of sophisticated cognitive language. Mastery of an\nobservation sentence corresponds (more or less) to a relatively\nstraightforward disposition: to assent when receiving a stimulation\npattern within a certain range. For most sentences, however, this is\nnot the case. What disposition must one have acquired in order to\ncount as understanding a sentence such as \u201cThe economy is in\nrecession\u201d? No doubt the disposition to assent in response to\nevidence is required, but what counts as evidence is almost\nunmanageably diffuse. In such a case, the links between sensory\nstimulation (such as that induced by the sight of words in a\nnewspaper) and assent are \u201cmultifarious [and] not easily\nreconstructed even in conjecture\u201d (1960, 11). A relatively\nclear-cut account, of the sort that Quine gives of observation\nsentences, is simply not available.\n\nSo Quine does not offer any sort of detailed account of the\nacquisition cognitive language beyond the observation sentences. (For\ncomparison of Quine\u2019s approach here with the very different\napproach of Chomsky, see Smith 2014.) Instead, he considers stages on\nthe way, forms of language which one might suppose could be easily\nacquired by a child who has mastered observation sentences and which\nmight provide steps leading to yet more advanced language.\n\nOne such step, which is emphasized in Quine\u2019s later work, is the\nmastery of what he calls observation categoricals (1981 p. 28) These\nare sentences of the form \u201cWhenever X [happens], Y\n[happens]\u201d, where the schematic letters are to be replaced by\nobservation sentences. (E.g. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s smoke,\nthere\u2019s fire.\u201d) It is plausible to suppose that a child\nwho has learnt the observation sentences can come by a mastery of the\nrelevant observation categorical. Observation sentences are what Quine\ncalls occasion sentences, true on some occasions and false on others,\nwhereas observation categoricals are eternal sentences, true or false\nonce for all. Quine suggests that we can think of observation\ncategoricals as a plausible first step towards a general mastery of\neternal sentences, which make up our serious theoretical\nknowledge.\n\nAnother step of the same kind is what Quine calls eternal\npredications, subject-predicate sentences true or false once for all,\nsuch as \u201cFido is a dog\u201d. Assuming the child has learnt\neach term as an observation sentence, the sight of the dog will\ndispose him to assent to each. Quine speculates that the sound of the\nword \u201cFido\u201d may have something of the same effect as the\nsight of the beast, inclining our learner to assent to\n\u201cDog\u201d and thus to \u201cFido is a dog\u201d. It is\nnotable that there is a sort of use-mention confusion operating here,\nif Quine\u2019s suggestion is correct. Language is learnt by\nconfusion and \u201cshort leaps of analogy\u201d rather than by\n\u201ccontinuous derivation\u201d (1975b, 77f.); indeed a holistic\nlanguage cannot be learnt without such leaps.\n\nA further advance, in Quine\u2019s view, takes place when the child\ncomes to use similar sentences but with two general terms, such as\n\u201cDogs are animals\u201d. Such a sentence, Quine remarks is\n\u2018\u2018really a universal categorical, \u2018Every \u03b1 is\na \u03b2\u2019.\u2019\u2019 (1974, 66). This kind of sentence, can\nbe represented using pronouns (\u201cIf something is a dog then it is\nan animal\u201d) or, more or less equivalently, using the logical\ndevice of quantifiers and variables. Such sentences have a particular\nimportance for Quine in connection with the idea of reference. Merely\nto be able to use a name, to be able to name Fido upon seeing him, for\nexample, is not yet to refer; one might simply be using the term as a\nresponse to the sight of the dog, hence as an observation sentence.\nReference, as Quine sees the matter, requires the capacity to\nreidentify the object over time and changing circumstances: if a dog\nis barking then it\u2014that very same dog\u2014is hungry; hence the\nimportance of pronouns.\n",
