    "main_text": "Visual thinking and discovery || Propositional discovery\n4.1 Propositional discovery\nTo discover a truth, as that expression is being used\nhere, is to come to believe it by one\u2019s own lights (as opposed\nto reading it or being told) in a way that is reliable and involves no\nviolation of epistemic rationality (given one\u2019s epistemic\nstate).  One can discover a truth without being the first to discover\nit (in this context); it is enough that one comes to believe it in an\nindependent, reliable and rational way. The difference between merely\ndiscovering a truth and proving it is a matter of transparency: for\nproving or following a proof the subject must be aware of the way in\nwhich the conclusion is reached and the soundness of that way; this is\nnot required for discovery.\nSometimes one discovers something by means of visual thinking using\nbackground knowledge, resulting in a cogent argument from which one\ncould construct a proof. A nice example is a visual argument that any\nknot diagram with a finite number of crossings can be turned into a\ndiagram of an unknot by interchanging the over-strand and under-strand\nof some of its crossings (Adams 2001: 58\u201390). That argument is a\nbit too long to present accessibly here. For a short example, here is\na way of discovering that the geometric mean of two positive numbers\nis less than or equal to their arithmetic mean (Eddy 1985) using\nFigure 6.\n\n\nFigure 6\n\nTwo circles (with diameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) meet at a single\npoint. A line is drawn between their centres through their common\npoint; its length is \\((a + b)/2\\), the sum of the two radii. This\nline is the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle with one other side\nof length \\((a - b)/2\\), the difference of the radii.\nPythagoras\u2019s theorem is used to infer that the remaining side of\nthe right-angled triangle has length \\(\\sqrt{(ab)}\\).Then visualizing\nwhat happens to the triangle when the diameter of the smaller circle\nvaries between 0 and the diameter of the larger circle, one infers\nthat \\(0 < \\sqrt{(ab)} < (a + b)/2\\); then verifying\nsymbolically that \\(\\sqrt{(ab)} = (a + b)/2\\) when \\(a = b\\), one\nconcludes that for positive \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(\\sqrt{(ab)} \\le (a +\nb)/2\\).\nThis thinking does not constitute a case of proving or following a\nproof of the conclusion, because it involves a step which we cannot\nclearly tell is valid. This is the step of attempting to\nvisually imagine what would happen when the smaller circle varies in\ndiameter between 0 and the diameter of the larger circle and inferring\nfrom the resulting experience that the line joining the centres of the\ncircles will always be longer than the horizontal line from the centre\nof the smaller circle to the vertical diameter of the larger circle.\nThis step seems sound (does not lead us into error) and may\nbe sound; but its soundness is opaque. If in fact it is\nsound, the whole thinking process is a reliable way of reaching the\nconclusion; so in the absence of factors that would make it irrational\nto trust the thinking, it would be a way of discovering the conclusion\nto be true.\n",
