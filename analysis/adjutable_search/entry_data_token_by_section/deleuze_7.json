    "main_text": "Collaboration with Guattari || What is Philosophy?\n4.3 What is Philosophy?\n\nAfter a long period in which each pursued his own interests, Deleuze\nand Guattari published a last collaboration in 1991, What Is\nPhilosophy? In answering their title question, Deleuze and\nGuattari seek to place philosophy in relation to science and art, all\nthree being modes of thought, with no subordination among them.\nThought, in all its modes, struggles with chaos against opinion.\nPhilosophy is the creation or construction of concepts; a concept is\nan intensive multiplicity, inscribed on a plane of immanence, and\npeopled by \u201cconceptual personae\u201d which operate the\nconceptual machinery. A conceptual persona is not a subject, for\nthinking is not subjective, but takes place in the relationship of\nterritory and earth. Science creates functions on a plane of\nreference. Art creates \u201ca bloc of sensation, that is to say, a\ncompound of percepts and affects\u201d (WP 164).\n\nWe will deal with Deleuze and the arts in some detail below. In\ndiscussing What is Philosophy?, let us concentrate on the\ntreatment of the relation of philosophy and science. We should\nremember at the outset that the nomad or minor science evoked in A\nThousand Plateaus is not the Royal or major science that makes up\nthe entirety of what Deleuze and Guattari call \u2018science\u2019\nin What is Philosophy?. The motives for this conflation are\nunclear; in the eyes of some, this change considerably weakens the\nvalue of the latter work.\n\nBe that as it may, in What is Philosophy? Deleuze and\nGuattari vigorously deny that philosophy is needed to help science\nthink about its own presuppositions (\u201cno one needs philosophy to\nreflect on anything\u201d [WP 6]). Instead, they emphasize the\ncomplementary nature of the two. First, they point out a number of\nsimilarities between philosophy and science: both are approaches to\n\u201cchaos\u201d that attempt to bring order to it, both are\ncreative modes of thought, and both are complementary to each other,\nas well as to a third mode of creative thought, art.\n\nBeyond these similarities, Deleuze and Guattari distinguish between\nphilosophy as the creation of concepts on a plane of immanence and\nscience as the creation of functions on a plane of reference. Both\nrelate to the virtual, the differential field of potential\ntransformations of material systems, but in different ways. Philosophy\ngives consistency to the virtual, mapping the forces composing a\nsystem as pure potentials, what the system is capable of. Meanwhile,\nscience gives it reference, determining the conditions by which\nsystems behave the way they actually do. Philosophy is the\n\u201ccounter-effectuation of the event,\u201d abstracting an event\nor change of pattern from bodies and states of affairs and thereby\nlaying out the transformative potentials inherent in things, the roads\nnot taken that coexist as compossibles or as inclusive disjunctions\n(differentiation, in the terms of Difference and Repetition),\nwhile science tracks the actualization of the virtual, explaining why\nthis one road was chosen in a divergent series or exclusive\ndisjunction (differenciation, according to Difference and\nRepetition). Functions predict the behavior of constituted\nsystems, laying out their patterns and predicting change based on\ncausal chains, while concepts \u201cspeak the event\u201d (WP 21),\nmapping out the multiplicity structuring the possible patterns of\nbehavior of a system\u2014and the points at which the system can\nchange its habits and develop new ones.\n\nFor Deleuze and Guattari in What is Philosophy?, then,\nscience deals with properties of constituted things, while philosophy\ndeals with the constitution of events. Roughly speaking, philosophy\nexplores the plane of immanence composed of constellations of\nconstitutive forces that can be abstracted from bodies and states of\naffairs. It thus maps the range of connections a thing is capable of,\nits \u201cbecomings\u201d or \u201caffects.\u201d Science, on the\nother hand, explores the concretization of these forces into bodies\nand states of affairs, tracking the behavior of things in relation to\nalready constituted things in a certain delimited region of space and\ntime (the \u201cplane of reference\u201d). How do concepts relate to\nfunctions? Just as there is a \u201cconcept of concept\u201d there\nare also \u201cconcepts of functions,\u201d but these are purely\nphilosophical creations \u201cwithout the least scientific\nvalue\u201d (WP 117). Thus concrete concepts like that of\n\u201cdeterritorialization\u201d are philosophical concepts, not\nscientific functions, even though they might resonate with, or echo,\nscientific functions. Nor are they metaphors, as Deleuze and Guattari\nrepeatedly insist:\n\n\u201cOf course, we realize the dangers of citing scientific\npropositions outside their own sphere. It is the danger of arbitrary\nmetaphor or of forced application. But perhaps these dangers are\naverted if we restrict ourselves to taking from scientific operators a\nparticular conceptualizable character which itself refers to\nnon-scientific areas, and converges with science without applying it\nor making it a metaphor\u201d (Deleuze 1989: 129).\n\nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s refusal to recognize that their work\ncontains metaphors is due to their struggle against the\n\u201cimperialism\u201d of the signifying regime, a major theme in\nboth Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus: not every\nrelation between different intellectual fields can be grasped by the\nmost common notions of \u201cmetaphor,\u201d reliant as they are on\nthe notion of a transfer of sense from primary to secondary\nsignification.\n",
