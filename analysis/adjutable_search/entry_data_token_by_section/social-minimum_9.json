    "main_text": "Why a social minimum? || Egalitarian liberalism\n2.4 Egalitarian liberalism\n\nWithin contemporary political philosophy, egalitarian liberalism seeks\nto present an alternative both to utilitarianism and to the two\nversions of libertarianism discussed above. Egalitarian liberals agree\nwith libertarians that utilitarianism fails to take seriously the\ninviolability of the person. Unlike libertarians, however, egalitarian\nliberals do not think that respect for the inviolability of the person\ncommits us to the principle of self-ownership (for more on this issue,\nsee section\n 3.1.2\n below). Consequently, they feel much less compunction in advocating\ntax-transfer schemes, which the libertarian finds objectionable, so as\nto secure a full social minimum. Indeed, they argue that justice\ndemands that we do introduce such schemes. Let us take a look at one\ninfluential egalitarian liberal theory of justice, and its\nimplications for the justifiability of enacting a social minimum (see\nalso Dworkin 1985, 2000).\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice, first published in 1971\n(with a revised edition in 1999) poses an intriguing question: What\nprinciples would you accept to govern your society if you did not know\nyour actual or likely position in this society? In practice, we are\nall aware of the religion we have (if we have one), we have some sense\nof the natural abilities we have been born with, and the advantages or\ndisadvantages we have gained from our social background. But, for a\nmoment, envisage that we did not know such things and possessed only\nvery general information about the kind of society we are going to\nlive in. Behind this \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, not knowing our\nreligion, natural ability, or social background, what principles would\nwe choose to govern the institutions that affect the distribution of\n\u201cprimary goods\u201d like income and wealth?\n\nFamously, Rawls argues that in an \u201coriginal position\u201d of\nthis kind, parties will choose to arrange social and economic\ninequalities so that\n\n\nthey are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and\n(b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of\nfair equality of opportunity. (Rawls 1971 [1999]: 72)\n\n\nSimplifying somewhat, part (a) of this formulation tells us that\ninequality in goods like income and wealth is just if it is arranged\nso that the group that is worst-off under this inequality is better\noff than it would be under any other level of inequality. Rawls calls\nthis the difference\n principle.[5]\n\nMany critics have found Rawls\u2019s argument for the difference principle\nunconvincing (see, for example, Kymlicka 2001: 60\u201370). They ask\nwhy people behind the veil of ignorance would not choose to gamble,\nselecting an alternative principle that is less favorable to the\ndisadvantaged in society than the difference principle but which would\ngive higher rewards than this principle should one turn out in fact to\nbelong to one of the more favored social classes. However, even if\nthis is valid as a criticism of Rawls\u2019s argument for the difference\nprinciple, it can be argued that Rawls\u2019s thought experiment\nnevertheless provides strong intuitive support for those who believe\nthat justice requires at least the enactment of a social minimum. For\nwhile most people placed behind the veil of ignorance might not be so\nrisk averse as to choose the difference principle to govern their\nsociety, it is reasonable to suppose that most would at least be\nconcerned to insure themselves against the danger of desperate poverty\nand would hence desire principles of justice that ensure everyone\nreasonable access to a social minimum. Interestingly, efforts by\npsychologists to model decision-making in situations akin to the\noriginal position show that people in practice tend to choose a\nprinciple that calls for the maximization of average well-being but\nsubject to the constraint that nobody falls below a specified floor\n(see Frolich and Oppenheimer 1992).\n\nFurther support for the enactment of a social minimum from within\nRawls\u2019s theory comes from his discussion of the importance of the\n\u201cstrains of commitment\u201d in determining what is just (Rawls\n1971 [1999]: 153\u2013160). The parties behind the veil of ignorance\nmust recognize that they are selecting principles of justice that,\nhaving been chosen, they must stick with in social life for good.\nThus, before they make their decision, they must honestly ask whether,\nshould they turn out to be the most disadvantaged under a chosen set\nof principles, they could really bear the strains of commitment\nentailed by living under these principles. Again, it is debatable as\nto whether this consideration points unequivocally to the difference\nprinciple as the appropriate principle to govern the distribution of\nincome and wealth. However, it seems plausible that this consideration\nwould rule out any principles that do not ensure everyone reasonable\naccess to the resources needed for a minimally decent life. How could\none honestly commit to the strains of living in a society that did not\nguarantee you this? This consideration reinforces the argument that\nthe parties behind the veil of ignorance would choose principles of\njustice that assure everyone of reasonable access to a social\nminimum.\n\nMoreover, it might be argued that even if one rejects the veil of\nignorance thought experiment as a way of exploring what justice\nconsists in, the strains of commitment idea still has force as a\nconsideration favoring the enactment of a social minimum. Even if one\nhas full knowledge of one\u2019s own and others\u2019 position in society,\none can put oneself in the place of others and consider the kind of\nstrains of commitment that they are likely to be suffering under the\npresent system. If one does this, can one really give assent to a\nsocial system that, by failing to guarantee reasonable access to a\nsocial minimum for some people, puts some of your fellow citizens\nunder what must be intolerable strains of commitment? Since one would\nsurely find such strains intolerable oneself, how can one reasonably\nexpect others to put up with them? (For more discussion of the strains\nof commitment, see Barry 1995: 61\u201367, and, with specific\nconnection to case for the social minimum, see Waldron 1993a).\n\nRawls\u2019s theory as it stands is, however, by no means the last word on\njustification of the social minimum. For example, Rawls\u2019s own\ndiscussion abstracts away from disability but a theory of the social\nminimum obviously needs to include the claims of disabled people. How\nfar can a \u2018contractualist\u2019 approach like that set out by Rawls be\nextended to include disabled people? (See Nussbaum 2006, chapter 2,\nfor discussion of this question, and for wider discussions of justice\nand disability see Barnes 2016, Begon 2021.) Does a Rawlsian,\negalitarian liberal approach need supplementing (or replacing with?)\nan alternative that can perhaps better capture the claims of disabled\npeople?\n",
