    "main_text": "The Procession and Reversion of Beings\n8. The Procession and Reversion of Beings\n\n\nIn distinguishing the various kinds of beings that constitute the\nhierarchical universe, Dietrich again follows Proclus. First there is\nGod, Proclus\u2019 One, followed by the intelligences, then souls and\nfinally bodies. Using material found in Proclus, the Liber de\ncausis, and Avicenna\u2019s Metaphysics, Dietrich explains\nthe order of the procession of these four kinds of beings as follows:\nFrom God there proceeds that which is called the first\nintelligence. Here the first stage in the procession has been reached\nand a kind of rank is established which corresponds to the traditional\nno\u00fbs of classical Neoplatonism. From the first\nintelligence the second intelligence flows forth along with the soul\nof the first celestial sphere and the first celestial sphere\nitself. This is the second stage.  Then the process is repeated with\nthe procession of the third intelligence, the soul of the second\nheaven, the second heaven itself, on down through all the celestial\nworlds until the intelligence and soul of the lowest heaven and the\nlowest heaven itself is reached. This intelligence, Dietrich informs\nus, causes the substance of the sublunary beings that undergo\ngeneration and corruption, that is, bodies. Thus all four kinds of\nbeings are accounted for and are ordered according to their place in\nthe celestial procession.\n\n\nThe entire universe of beings is thus in a state of active procession\nof all creatures from God. Each of the four orders of being is in a\ndynamic state, even God when viewed as the creator. God exhibits a\n\u201ccertain interior relational overflowing\u201d which of course\nis his creativity. He establishes the rest of the universe of being\nout of nothing, Dietrich tells us. And at the lowest rank of the order\nof beings, at the level of bodies there is also a dynamic at work. For\nbodies in their natural desire for form are in the process of\nreturning to their source. Consequently there is a hierarchical\nprinciple at work that consists in God who is an eternal outpouring\nwho, being the source of all emanation, has no need to return, bodies\nthat are only in the state of return but have nothing further into\nwhich they can proceed, and intellects and souls that are both in the\nstate of procession and reversion, since they both receive being and\npass it on to those below.\n\n\nDietrich seems to suggest that reditive activity is not found in\nGod. He says that all things are turned back to God, but he does not\nsay that God in any way turns back upon himself. One should remember,\nhowever, that by restricting himself to giving a purely philosophical\naccount of the nature of being and the universe Dietrich was not free\nto speculate theologically about whether exitus or\nreditus had any r\u00f4le to play in the life of the\nTrinity.  That Dietrich is very close to making the commonplace\nidentity of the second hypostasis, the first intelligence, with the\nSecond Person of the Blessed Trinity is hinted at when he talks about\nintellect and desire being the principles of return. Quoting directly\nfrom Proclus he remarks that what is desirable to all things is\nintellect and that all things proceed from intellect as well as return\nthrough it. But he restrains himself from making any theological\nidentity. It is clear, however, that love marks all the ranks of the\nhierarchy, every member of which is driven to return to its source by\ndesire for intellect.  Tacitly he has left the door open for the\ninterpretation that the God who is love as reported in Sacred\nScripture has left the mark of that love in the universe of beings and\nthat intellect (often identified by the earlier Christian\nNeoplatonists with the Second Person of the Trinity) is the crucial\nagent in both the unfolding and retrieval of being.\n",
