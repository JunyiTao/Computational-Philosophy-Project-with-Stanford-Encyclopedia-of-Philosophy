    "main_text": "The Problem of Demarcating Social Ontology || Social Versus Non-Social\n2.1 Social Versus Non-Social\n\nSocial ontology is the study of social entities and\nproperties. But which things are social? How are they distinguished\nfrom those that are not social? Not every theory in social ontology\nneeds to make this distinction\u2014but many rely on it. Michael\nBratman, for instance, analyzes \u201cshared intentions\u201d of a\ngroup in terms of the knowledge and intentions of individual members\nof the group (Bratman 1993, 2014). His project is designed to remove\nthe mystery behind shared intention by analyzing it in terms of\nnon-social mental states of individual people. More generally,\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d theories of the social world sharply\ndistinguish the social from the non-social. These\ntheories\u2014descendants of Mill 1843\u2014hold that all social\nfacts are determined by the psychological states of individual\npeople.\n\nThe \u201clevel of the social\u201d is often divided from other\n\u201clower levels\u201d in arrangements of the sciences into\nhierarchies (Comte 1830\u20131842, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). This\narrangement of the sciences into levels is sometimes challenged\naltogether (e.g., Wimsatt 1976, Thalos 2013). But even if certain\ndomains of science can be arranged into levels, the level of the\nsocial has difficulties unique to it. One is the problem of\nidentifying just which entities are the social ones. Even cases that\nwould seem straightforward can be contentious. A crowd, for instance,\nwas regarded by many in the late nineteenth century as the\nparadigmatic social object. But in recent years it has become less\nobvious that this is so. Margaret Gilbert, for instance, hesitates to\nattribute \u201csociality\u201d to crowds: sociality, she argues,\narises from norms and commitments, which many crowds lack. According\nto Gilbert, it is with joint commitment that a group is genuinely\nsocial (Gilbert 1989). Other philosophers and sociologists make\nalternative claims about the \u201cmark of the social\u201d, while\nstill others deny that there is any criterion for distinguishing the\nsocial from the non-social (see Greenwood 1997).\n\nA second problem is to identify which categories of social entities\nare the best focus for analysis of the social world. Social theorists\nhave treated a variety of different categories of social entities as\nbasic, including social laws (Mill 1843, Spencer 1895);\nsocial facts (Durkheim 1894, Mandelbaum 1955); social\ngroups (Oppenheim & Putnam 1958, Gilbert 1989, Tuomela 2013);\nhuman kinds (Boyd 1991, 1999b; Millikan 1999, Mallon 2016); institutional\nfacts (Searle 1995); social objects and social\nproperties (Macdonald & Pettit 1981, Ruben 1985); social\npredicates (Kincaid 1986); social practices (Bourdieu\n1977, Giddens 1984, Schatzki 1996); and social processes\n(Whitehead 1929, Rescher 2000, Livet & Nef 2009). Some theories\nfocus on a category because it is significant, but do not claim that\nit comprehensively covers the social world. Others choose a category\nof social entities in order to be comprehensive. In doing this, a\ntheory may aim to set up an exhaustive determination claim: for\ninstance, it may claim that all social objects are\ncomposed of individual people interacting with one another,\nor that all social properties supervene on individualistic\nproperties, or that all social facts are grounded by\nphysical facts. As these examples illustrate, the category of social\nentities a theory focuses on is tied to how the theory interprets\n\u201cdetermination\u201d (for more on this, see\n section 2.3).\n\nEven more contentious is which objects are not social. To\nmany theorists, individual people are paradigmatically non-social.\nMany philosophers, however, argue that individuals are socially\nconstituted (see sections\n 1.2,\n 3.1.2, and the sections\n A.3.2,\n and\n A.4.2 of the\n  supplement on the history of social ontology).\n Thus some projects in social ontology look for a middle ground. They\nintend to accommodate the social nature of individuals, and yet to\naccount fully for the social in terms of individuals (see\n section 3.2.2).\n\nOne option for interpreting the \u201cnon-social entities\u201d is\nthat they include only the objects of physics, chemistry, biology, and\nother \u201chard sciences\u201d. According to some theorists, even\nthese are socially constructed and therefore fall on the social side\nof the division (Pickering 1984, Woolgar 1988). But even presuming\nthat objects of the \u201chard sciences\u201d are non-social, they\nmay be inadequate for practical purposes as a characterization of the\nset of non-social things. After all, social theory aims to say more\nthan merely that the social world is somehow built out of physical\nentities (see\n section 3.1.4).\n A variety of approaches to the building blocks of the social are\ndiscussed in\n section 3.\n",
