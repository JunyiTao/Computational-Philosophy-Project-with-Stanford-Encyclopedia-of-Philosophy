Problems for Constructivism\n\nConstructivism seems correct about some putative diseases; that is,\nsocieties have at times thought that some human activities were\npathological because of values rather than scientific evidence.\nHowever, it is another task to show that constructivism is correct\nabout our concept of disease. And this would be true even if there\nwere no diseases; it might still be the case that our concept of\ndisorder is naturalist even if nothing falls under it.\n\nThe chief problem for constructivism is that we routinely make a\ndistinction between the sick and the deviant, or between pathological\nconditions and those that we just disapprove of. Our disease concepts\ncannot just be matter of disvaluing certain people or their\nproperties. It must involve a reason for disvaluing them in a medical\nway rather than some other way. Illness has never been the only way to\nbe deviant. So Szasz is just wrong to claim that \u201cwhen a person\ndoes something bad, like shoot the president, it is immediately\nassumed that he might be mad\u201d (1974, 91). Most of the time when\npeople do bad things nobody doubts their sanity, just their morals.\nPhysically or mentally ill people, even if they are seen as\nnorm-breakers, are seen as a distinctive class of norm-breakers.\nWhat\u2019s distinctive about them?\n\nThe problem is that we routinely judge that people are worse off\nwithout thinking they are ill in any way \u2013 for example, the\nugly, the poor, people with no sense of humor or lousy taste or a\npropensity for destructive relationships. We don\u2019t treat these\njudgments of comparative disadvantage as a prelude to medical inquiry,\nso why do we do so in some other cases?\n\nNotice that the problem is not just one of establishing that someone\nis badly off or is in some other disvalued state. Rather, the trouble\nis caused by the requirement that someone is badly off in a specific,\nhealth-related or medically significant way. Rachel Cooper, for\nexample (2002, 272\u201374), analyzes the concept of disease as a bad\nthing to have that is judged to require medical attention. She deals\nwith the objection that specifying when someone is badly off is very\ndifficult. Cooper admits that it is a hard problem, but replies that\nit is a widespread problem, one which crops up in many areas of moral\nphilosophy.\n\nThis response is correct as a general point but does not touch the\npresent objection. The objection is not that it is hard to say when\nsomeone is badly off, but that it is hard to isolate the specific\nclass of ways of being badly off that we regard as medically relevant\nwithout relying on a notion of natural malfunction. Glackin (2019,\np.272\u20133), however, denies that this is a problem at all. He argues\nthat to justify treating some conditions as medical issues, and\n\"others as social or legal, rather than medical, all a normativist\nneeds to say is that this is morally speaking the right thing to do.\"\nFor Glackin, we can defend the claim that someone is sick by saying\nthat according to our values they are sick, and no more need be\nsaid.\n\nOther scholars do think there is more to say. John Harris, for\nexample, posits an \u201cER test\u201d (2007, 91) according to which\nwe can think of a disorder as a condition that makes someone worse off\nand is such that emergency room personnel would be negligent if they\ndid not remedy it if they could. But as it stands the ER test is much\ntoo broad. Taken literally the ER tests requires medical personnel to\nteach the local language to immigrants whose lives are worsened by a\nlack of competence in it. A general theory of ill-being would be as\ndesirable as a theory of well-being. But without further elaboration\nit would not discriminate between medical and non-medical forms of\nill-being. Like Cooper, Harris faces the difficulty of specifying what\nis distinctively medical about the conditions that we expect medical\npersonnel to treat: of course, a thesis about what counts as a medical\nintervention that was put in terms of combating disease or pathology\nwould be circular. Reznek (1987, 163) argues that we can delimit a\npurely medical sphere \u201cenumeratively without reference to the\nconcept of disease \u2013 in terms of pharmacological and surgical\ninterventions.\u201d However, as we saw at the start of this essay, a\nlot of medical attention is directed at conditions which we do not\ncall diseases. Prescribing contraceptive pills is a pharmacological\nintervention, but it is not directed against a disease; going on the\npill is not like beginning a course of anti-malarial tablets.\n\nThe naturalist answer to the question what makes some medical\ninterventions directed against disease is that conditions which\ndoctors treat are diseases in so far as they involve natural\nmalfunctions. The constructivist view is that the class of what we\ncall malfunctions is picked out by its involvement in medical\npractice, and not the other way round. Cooper and Harris try to base\ntheir analysis on our practices, but they are unable to distinguish\nmedical practices from non-medical ones. \n\nBroadbent (2019) has a value-independent account, but it is also\navowedly anti-realist about disease and so can be treated here.\nBroadbent calls his view of disease subjective but he has a different\nway of dealing with the problem of specifying the human response that\nis characteristic of disease judgments. His theory is that health and\ndisease are secondary qualities like color \u201cthat depends on, or\nperhaps is partly constituted by, the dispositions of observers or\nthinkers to have certain perceptual or cognitive reactions\u201d\n(p.108). What human observers bring to physiological states of affairs\nis not value judgments, but a disposition to track them as making\ncharacteristic contributions to survival and reproduction. Broadbent\nis alert to the issue that there might be cross-cultural differences\nin judgments about health and disease, but regards these as compatible\nwith very broad agreement on the extension of healthy and diseased\nstates, just as he thinks there is sufficient agreement on spectral\nphenomena to speak of color in different contexts. The same treatment\nwould need to be given with respect to judgments within a society that\nvary over time, assuming that objects can change color as a society\nalters its color categories. \n\nSo apart from Glackin there seems to be agreement that the\nconstructivist needs to explain how the judgments that we direct at\nputative sick or healthy people form a special class of judgments. And\nthat explanation has to show, in addition, why we think the conditions\nthat we single out as diseases with those special judgments are\ncandidates for a particular set of causal explanations. It\u2019s all very\nwell to point out, as Reznek does (p.88) that an etiology only\nexplains a pathology if we have already decided that it is a\npathology. This is correct, but it dodges the conceptual question of\nwhy we first decide that only some people or conditions are\npathological. The naturalist says this: we think some people are worse\noff because of a special kind of causal process, namely a disturbance\nof normal physical or psychological function. It is that causal\njudgment that has conceptual priority, even if, as a matter of timing,\nthe violation of a norm is what is detected first. Note that it does\nnot refute naturalism to point out that the concept of disease is\nsometimes misapplied, so that we think people are sick but discover\nthat they are not. In such cases (e.g. homosexuality) the explanation\nfor why it happened may be that our values caused the initial\njudgment, but that does not show that the concept of disease is\nconstructivist, rather than naturalist. No concept is correctly\napplied every time.\n\nReznek, for instance, argues that to judge \u201cthat homosexuality\nis a disease we first have to make a value-judgment. We have first to\njudge that we would be worse off being homosexual\u201d (1987, 212).\nReznek then says that we could discover that homosexuality is not a\ndisease if we find out that it develops by a normal psychological\nprocess. Reznek calls this is a form of constructivism (or\nnormativism, in his terms) because value judgments have conceptual\npriority: but in fact in the case he describes it seems that value\njudgments are actually only heuristics, drawing our attention to\nwhether something might be wrong with someone. If the initial judgment\ncan be overturned by a biological discovery, then it seems that\nbiological facts are necessary for a final judgment. That is to say\nthat our concept of disease necessarily involves both biological and\nevaluative judgments. That is a version of naturalism, since the\nbiological facts are the ultimate foundation for the judgment. Indeed,\nnaturalism seems to explain why constructivist interpretations are\nsometimes correct. We say now that homosexuality was never a disease,\nand was just diagnosed on moral grounds, because it was not caused by\nmalfunctions according to any even moderately correct theory of human\nbiology or psychology. Values stopped people from getting the science\nright, but homosexuality was correctly understood, and no longer seen\nas a disease, when the science was done in a properly disinterested\nway.\n\nNaturalism embodies the important insight that we do in fact think\nthat disease involves a causal process that includes biological\nabnormalities. It does not mean, however, that all diseases have to\nreceive the same biological explanation. The class of diseases will\ninclude a variety of different conditions that receive different\ncausal explanations. That is, even if diseases are natural kinds, the\nsuperordinate category of disease may not be. Not just any sort of\nstory about the causes of abnormal behavior will do, and it is\ndifficult to reach a satisfactory specification of the sorts of causes\nthat common sense might recognize. We also distinguish, based on our\ncommon sense understanding of human biology, between pathological and\nnon-pathological versions of the same outward phenomena. Because aging\nis normal we acknowledge that an elderly person will differ from a\nyoung adult, so our assumptions about normality are sensitive to\nbackground conditions. But when aging is abnormal, we call it a\ndisease. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, for instance, causes\nchildren to undergo all the stages of human aging at a bizarrely\naccelerated rate. They nearly always die by seventeen, far gone in\nsenescence. Even though we don\u2019t know much about it, we think of\nHutchinson-Gilford as a disease not just because we don\u2019t like being\nold but because we think it is different from getting old in a way\nthat must be caused by some underlying pathology. The concept of\ndisease necessarily requires, just as naturalism insists, that a\ncondition have a causal history involving abnormal biological systems.\nSo let\u2019s turn to naturalism, and see whether it should be a\nconservative or revisionist position.\n",
