    "main_text": "\n\n\nRosa Luxemburg (1871\u20131919), described by one of\nher colleagues as the \u201cmost brilliant intellect of all the\nscientific heirs of Marx and Engels\u201d (Fr\u00f6hlich 1940/2010:\n153 citing Franz Mehring in Neue Zeit) is one of the most\noriginal and influential thinkers in the history of Marxism. Her life\nand works stand out for the unique combination of intellectual rigour\nand political integrity, a rare ability to merge deep theoretical\ninsight with sharp political vision, the development of knowledge which\nis at the same time militant activism.\n\n\nLuxemburg is best known for her contributions to\nsome of the most important economic and political debates that have\nshaped the development of socialist thought: the critique of capitalism\nand the dynamics of capital accumulation, the development of\nglobalisation and its relation to colonialism and imperialism, the\nlimits of national self-determination, the relationship of revolution\nto democracy, the challenges of parliamentary reform, the role of\nstrikes and trade unions in political organisation, political parties,\nthe critique of liberal feminism, the analysis of racism in connection\nto capitalist exploitation. She defended freedom, understood as a form\nof individual and collective self-rule, which could only be fully\nrealised in a democratic socialist society, and gave her life for the\ncause. She was uncompromising in both her critique of capitalism and of\nbureaucratic authoritarian socialism. For this reason, and in part also\ndue to her tragic death, her legacy has been appropriated (and\ndistorted) by both Western Marxists keen to chart an alternative path\nto state socialism, and socialist states attracted to her theory of\ncapitalist crisis and her radical critique of social-democracy. In the\ncontext of an ongoing electoral decline of traditional\nsocial-democratic parties, and with the rise of far-right challenges to\ncrisis-ridden liberal political institutions, Luxemburg\u2019s work\nhas enjoyed a significant revival. It remains an important source of\ncritique of the global political economy, one of the most sophisticated\nattempts to think about democracy and revolution, and an ongoing source\nof inspiration to reflect on the meaning of socialist emancipation\nbeyond national boundaries.\n",
