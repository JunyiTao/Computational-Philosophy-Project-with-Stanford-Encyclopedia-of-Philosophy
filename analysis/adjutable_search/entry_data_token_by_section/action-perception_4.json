    "main_text": "Sensorimotor Contingency Theories\n2. Sensorimotor Contingency Theories\n\nAction-based accounts of perception proliferate diversely in\n20th century. In this section, we focus on the reafference\ntheory of Richard Held and the more recent enactive approach of J.\nKevin O\u2019Regan, Alva No\u00eb, and others. Central to both\naccounts is the view that perception and perceptually guided action\ndepend on abilities to anticipate the sensory effects of bodily\nmovements. To be a perceiver it is necessary to have knowledge of what\nO\u2019Regan and No\u00eb call the laws of sensorimotor\ncontingency\u2014\u201cthe structure of the rules governing the\nsensory changes produced by various motor actions\u201d\n(O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb 2001: 941).\n\nWe start with two sources of motivation for theories that make\nknowledge of sensorimotor contingencies necessary and/or sufficient\nfor spatially contentful perceptual experience. The first is the idea\nthat the visual system exploits efference copy, i.e., a copy\nof the outflowing saccade command signal, in order to distinguish\nchanges in visual stimulation caused by movement of the eye from those\ncaused by object movement. The second is a long line of experiments,\nfirst performed by Stratton and Helmholtz in the 19th\ncentury, on how subjects adapt to lens-, mirror-, and prism-induced\nmodifications of visual experience. We follow up with objections to\nthese theories and alternatives.\n",
