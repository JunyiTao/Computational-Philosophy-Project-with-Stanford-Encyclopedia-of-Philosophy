    "main_text": "Topic neutrality\n4. Topic neutrality\n\n\nLogic, it seems, is not about anything in particular; relatedly, it is\napplicable everywhere, no matter what we are reasoning about. So it is\nnatural to suppose that the logical constants can be marked out as the\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d expressions (Ryle 1954, 116; Peacocke 1976, 229; Haack\n1978, 5\u20136; McCarthy 1981, 504; Wright 1983, 133; Sainsbury 2001,\n365). We have reason to care about the topic-neutral expressions, and\nto treat them differently from others, because we are interested in\nlogic as a universal canon for reasoning, one that is\napplicable not just to reasoning about this or that domain, but to all\nreasoning.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the notion of topic neutrality is too vague to be of\nmuch help when it comes to the hard cases for which we need a\nprinciple of demarcation. Take arithmetic, for instance. Is it\ntopic-neutral? Well, yes: anything can be counted, so the theorems of\narithmetic will be useful in any field of inquiry. But then again, no:\narithmetic has its own special subject matter, the natural numbers and\nthe arithmetical relations that hold between them. The same can be\nsaid about set theory: on the one hand, anything we can reason about\ncan be grouped into sets; on the other hand, set theory seems to be\nabout a particular corner of the universe\u2014the sets\u2014and\nthus to have its own special \u201ctopic.\u201d The general problem of which\nthese two cases are instances might be called the antinomy of\ntopic-neutrality. As George Boolos points out, the antinomy can\nbe pressed all the way to paradigm cases of logical constants: \u201cit\nmight be said that logic is not so \u2018topic-neutral\u2019 as it\nis often made out to be: it can easily be said to be about the notions\nof negation, conjunction, identity, and the notions expressed by\n\u2018all\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019, among others \u2026\u201d\n(1975, 517). It is plausible to think that the source of the antinomy\nis the vagueness of the notion of topic neutrality, so let us consider\nsome ways in which we might make this notion more precise.\n\n\nGilbert Ryle, who seems to have coined the expression\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d, gives the following rough criterion:\nWe may call English expressions \u201ctopic-neutral\u201d if a\nforeigner who understood them, but only them, could get no clue at all\nfrom an English paragraph containing them what that paragraph was\nabout. (1954,\n 116)[8]\n\n\nThere are, I suppose, a few paradigm cases of such expressions:\n\u201cis\u201d, for instance, and \u201cif\u201d. But the criterion gives little help when\nwe venture beyond these clear-cut cases. The problem is that one might\nanswer the question \u201cwhat is this paragraph about?\u201d at many different\nlevels of generality. Suppose I understand English badly, and I hear\nsomeone say:\nblah blah blah and not blah blah blah because\nit blah blah blah to be blah blah blah and was\nalways blah blah blah. But every blah blah is\nblah blah, although a few blah blah might be\nblah.\n\n\nDo I have any clue as to what the paragraph is about? Well, surely I\nhave some clue. \u201cBecause\u201d reveals that the passage is about\ncausal or explanatory relations. \u201cIt\u201d reveals that the passage is about\nat least one object that is not known to be a person. The tense\noperator \u201cwas always\u201d reveals that it is about events that occur in\ntime. \u201cMight be\u201d reveals that it is about the realm of the possible (or\nthe unknown), and not just the actual (or the known). Finally, \u201cevery\u201d\nand \u201ca few\u201d reveal that it is about discrete, countable objects.\nPerhaps some of these words are not topic-neutral and should not be\nincluded in the domain of logic, but we certainly don\u2019t want to rule\nout all of them. And Ryle\u2019s criterion gives no guidance about\nwhere to draw the line. One might even suspect that there is no line,\nand that topic neutrality is a matter of degree, truth-functional\nexpressions being more topic-neutral than quantifiers, which are more\ntopic-neutral than tense and modal operators, which are more\ntopic-neutral than epistemic expressions, and so on (Lycan 1989).\n\n\nThe problem with Ryle\u2019s account is its reliance on vague and\nunclarified talk of \u201caboutness.\u201d If we had a precise philosophical\naccount of what it is for a statement to be about a particular\nobject or subject matter, then we could define a topic-neutral\nstatement as one that is not about anything\u2014or, perhaps, one that\nis about everything indifferently. Here we might hope to appeal to\nNelson Goodman\u2019s classic account of \u201cabsolute aboutness,\u201d which implies\nthat logical truths are not absolutely about anything (1961, 256), or\nto David Lewis\u2019s (1988) account of what it is for a proposition to be\nabout a certain subject matter, which implies that logical truths are\nabout every subject matter indifferently. However, neither\naccount is appropriate for our purpose. On Goodman\u2019s account, \u201cwhat a\nstatement is absolutely about will depend in part upon what logic is\npresupposed,\u201d and hence upon which expressions are taken to be logical\nconstants (253\u20134), so it would be circular to appeal to Goodman\u2019s\naccount of aboutness in a demarcation of the logical constants. On\nLewis\u2019s account, all necessarily true propositions turn out to\nbe topic-neutral. But if there is any point to invoking topic\nneutrality in demarcating logic, it is presumably to distinguish the\nlogical truths from a wider class of necessary propositions, some of\nwhich are subject matter-specific. If we are willing to broaden the\nbounds of logic to encompass all necessary propositions (or,\nalternatively, all analytic sentences), then we might as well demarcate\nlogic as the realm of necessary truth (alternatively, analytic truth).\nIt is only if we want to distinguish the logical from the\ngenerically necessary, or to demarcate logic without appealing to modal\nnotions at all, that we need to invoke topic neutrality. And in neither\nof these cases will Lewis\u2019s criterion of aboutness be of service.\n\n\nWe rejected Ryle\u2019s criterion for topic-neutrality because it\nappealed to an unclarified notion of aboutness. We rejected Goodman\u2019s\nexplication of aboutness because it assumed that the line between logic\nand non-logic had already been drawn. And we rejected Lewis\u2019s account\nof aboutness because it did not distinguish logical truths from other\nkinds of necessary truths. How else might we cash out the idea that\nlogic is \u201cnot about anything in particular\u201d? Two approaches have been\nprominent in the literature.\n\n\nThe first starts from the idea that what makes an expression\nspecific to a certain domain or topic is its capacity to\ndiscriminate between different individuals. For example, the\nmonadic predicate \u201cis a horse\u201d, the dyadic predicate \u201cis taller than\u201d,\nand the quantifier \u201cevery animal\u201d all distinguish between Lucky Feet,\non the one hand, and the Statue of Liberty, on the other:\n\n\u201cLucky Feet is a horse\u201d is true; \u201cThe Statue of Liberty is a horse\u201d\nis false.\n\u201cThe Statue of Liberty is taller than Lucky Feet\u201d is true; \u201cLucky\nFeet is taller than the Statue of Liberty\u201d is false.\nThe truth of \u201cEvery animal is healthy\u201d depends on whether Lucky\nFeet is healthy, but not on whether the Statue of Liberty is\nhealthy.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the monadic predicate \u201cis a thing\u201d, the dyadic\npredicate \u201cis identical with\u201d, and the quantifier \u201ceverything\u201d do not\ndistinguish between Lucky Feet and the Statue of Liberty. In fact, they\ndo not distinguish between any two particular objects. As far\nas they are concerned, one object is as good as another and might just\nas well be switched with it. Expressions with this kind of indifference\nto the particular identities of objects might reasonably be said to be\ntopic-neutral. As we will see in the next section, this notion of topic\nneutrality can be cashed out in a mathematically precise way as\ninvariance under arbitrary permutations of a domain. It is in this\nsense that the basic concepts of arithmetic and set theory are not\ntopic-neutral, since they distinguish some objects (the empty set, the\nnumber 0) from others.\n\n\nThe second approach locates the topic neutrality of logic in its\nuniversal applicability. On this conception, logic is useful for the\nguidance and criticism of reasoning about any subject\nwhatsoever\u2014natural or artefactual, animate or inanimate, abstract\nor concrete, normative or descriptive, sensible or merely\nconceptual\u2014because it is intimately connected somehow with the\nvery conditions for thought or reasoning. This notion of topic\nneutrality is not equivalent to the one just discussed. It allows that\na science with its own proprietary domain of objects, like arithmetic\nor set theory, might still count as topic-neutral in virtue of its\ncompletely general applicability. Thus, Frege, who took arithmetic to\nbe about numbers, which he regarded as genuine objects, could still\naffirm its absolute topic neutrality:\n\u2026the basic propositions on which arithmetic is based\ncannot apply merely to a limited area whose peculiarities they express\nin the way in which the axioms of geometry express the peculiarities of\nwhat is spatial; rather, these basic propositions must extend to\neverything that can be thought. And surely we are justified in\nascribing such extremely general propositions to logic. (1885, 95, in\nFrege 1984; for further discussion, see MacFarlane 2002)\n\n\nThe tradition of demarcating the logical constants as expressions\nthat can be characterized by purely inferential introduction and\nelimination rules can be seen as a way of capturing this notion of\ncompletely general applicability. For, plausibly, it is the fact that\nthe logical constants are characterizable in terms of notions\nfundamental to thought or reasoning (for example, valid inference) that\naccounts for their universal applicability.\n\n\nThe antinomy with which we started can now be resolved\nby disambiguating.  Arithmetic and set theory make distinctions among\nobjects, and so are not topic-neutral\nin the first sense, but they might\nstill be topic-neutral in the second sense, by virtue of their universal\napplicability to reasoning about any subject.\nWe are still faced with a decision about which of\nthese notions of topic neutrality is distinctive of logic. Let us postpone this\nproblem, however, until we have had a closer look at both notions.\n\n",
