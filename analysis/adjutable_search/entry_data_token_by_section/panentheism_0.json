    "main_text": "Terminology\n1. Terminology\n\nBecause modern \u201cpanentheism\u201d developed under the influence\nof German Idealism, Whiteheadian process philosophy, and current\nscientific thought, panentheists employ a variety of terms with\nmeanings that have specialized content.\n\nTheological terms as understood by panentheists:\n\n1. Classical Theism\nClassical theism as a specific form of theism understands God as\ntranscendent, immutable, impassible, timeless (Mullins 2020, 393).\nUltimate reality is a reality which is distinct from the world (J.\nCooper, 2008, 11; Stenmark, 2019, 30). This distinction at times\ndevelops into an ontological separation between God and the world that\nmakes any interaction between God and the world problematic. Classical\nChristian theism bases God\u2019s immanence and presence in the world\non God\u2019s transcendence. This priority of transcendence implies\nthat God\u2019s presence is always partial. God\u2019s difference\nfrom the world is crucial. Even if God\u2019s relationship to the\nworld is dynamic rather than static, developing rather than fixed,\ndivine transcendence does not allow the world to affect God.\n2. Pantheism\nA type of theism that stresses the identity of God and the world\nontologically. This identity is expressed in different manifestations\nso distinctions can be made, but the distinctions are temporary. There\nis often a strong sense of necessity in God\u2019s creation of the\nworld so that God as God must express deity in creation.\n3. Transcendence\nGenerally, God\u2019s externality to the world so that God is\nunlimited by any other being or reality. Hegel and then Hartshorne,\nhowever, understand transcendence as including all the parts that make\nup the world in order to avoid any reality external to God that limits\nGod (Whittemore 1960, 141; Davis 2019, 8 [Other Internet\nResources]).\n4. Immanence\nGod\u2019s presence and activity within the world. Panentheists\nassert that classical theism limits its affirmation of God\u2019s\nimmanence by deriving God\u2019s immanence from God\u2019s\ntranscendence. God is present in every situation because God is\nunlimited by any reality external to God.\n5. Kenosis\nDivine self-emptying, or withdrawal, of divine attributes.\nTraditionally, the limitation of the exercise of the divine attributes\nresulted from the divine will whether in the case of Jesus\u2019\nhuman life or in God\u2019s relation to the creation.\n6. Essential Kenosis\nGod\u2019s nature is self-giving and other-empowering. Thomas J.\nOord\u2019s concept of essential kenosis bases the emptying of divine\nattributes on the divine nature rather than the divine will (Oord\n2015, 158\u2013166).\n\n\nTerms influenced by the German Idealism of Hegel and Schelling:\n\n1. Dialectic\nThe presence of contradictory realities where the contradiction is\novercome by including elements from each of the contradictory elements\nin a synthesis that is more than the combination of each member of the\ncontradiction. Whitehead\u2019s understanding of God\u2019s\nredemption of evil by placing an evil event in a contrast to a good\nevent expresses a similar understanding although he is not as explicit\nas Hegel in understanding all of reality as a dialectical\ndevelopment.\n2. Infinite\nThe obvious understanding of the infinite is as a negation of any\nlimits such as a bounded space or time. However, many panentheists,\nand other thinkers (Williams 2010, 143), understand the infinite in a\npositive sense as the inclusion of all that is and that might be\n(Clayton 2008a, 152). Panentheists influenced by process philosophy\nemphasize that divine infinity deals with possibility not actuality\n(Dombrowski 2013, 253; Keller 2014, 80). In process thought, God\ncontains all possibilities and presents every possible response that\nan actual event might make to any events from the past that influence\nwhat that event becomes.\n3. Perichoresis\nThe ontological intermingling of Christ\u2019s divine and human\nnatures and the ontological intermingling of the members of the\nTrinity (Otto 2001). This concept of intermingling has also been\nutilized to describe the Incarnation and the relationship between God\nand individuals/creation. Moltmann generalizes perichoresis to the\ncosmic realm by affirming the presence of God in the world and the\nworld in God (J. Cooper 2006, 252 citing Moltmann 1985, 17).\n\n\nTerms influenced by Whiteheadian process philosophy:\n\n1. Internal and External Relations\nInternal relations are relations that affect the being of the\nrelated beings. External relations do not change the basic nature or\nessence of a being. For panentheism, the relationship between God and\nthe world is an internal relationship in that God affects the world\nand the world affects God.\n2. Dipolar\nRefers especially to God as having two basic aspects. Schelling\nidentified these aspects as necessary and contingent. Whitehead\nreferred to God\u2019s primordial and consequent natures meaning that\nGod has an eternal nature and a responsive nature. Whitehead\nunderstood all reality to be dipolar in that each event includes both\nphysical and mental aspects in opposition to a mind-body dualism.\nHartshorne identified these aspects as abstract and concrete.\n3. Panpsychism\nIn the most general description, panpsychism assumes that\nfundamental entities possess mental and physical properties\n(G\u00f6cke 2018, 208). Process panentheism and panpsychism are\nfrequently connected although neither entails the other. The basis for\nthe connection between panentheism and panpsychism is\nWhitehead\u2019s concept that every actual occasion consists of a\nmental and physical pole. Whitehead understood this mental pole as\nalways present, but Philip Clayton understands mentality as emergent\n(Clayton 2020b).\n\n\nTerms related to current scientific thought:\n\n1. Research Program\nDrawing on scientific practice, a research program in philosophy\ninvolves central affirmations and auxiliary hypotheses which are\nconsistent with available data. Consistency with data, rather than\nbeing either true or false, characterizes research programs (Clayton\n2019).\n2. Dualism\nWhile dualism may refer to a variety of pairs of opposites, in\nscientific thought and process philosophy dualism refers to the\nposition that consciousness and matter are fundamentally different\nsubstances, or types of reality. Panentheists generally reject the\ndualism of consciousness and matter (Clayton 2004c, 3). As an\nalternative, panentheists tend to affirm that consciousness and matter\nare different manifestations of a basic ontological unity. This basic\nontological unity may take the form of panpsychism, in which all\nactualities include an element of mentality. Griffin prefers the term\n\u201cpanexperientialism\u201d because all actualities have an\nexperiential component (2004, 44\u201345). Clayton takes an\nalternative approach to overcome the consciousness-material dualism by\nadvocating strong emergence in which ontologically different types of\nexistence develop out of the basic ontological unity (2004c,\n3\u20136). J. Leidenhag identifies difficulties with each of these\napproaches (2016).\n3. Reductionism\nThe properties of one scientific domain consists of properties of\na more elementary scientific domain (Kim 2005, 164). Modern\nreductionism primarily holds that all of reality can be explained by\nusing only physical, sub-atomic, entities and denies the existence of\nmental realities as a separate kind of existence. Any reference to a\nhigher type of existence results from a lack of information about the\nphysical entities that are involved. Causation always moves from the\nbottom-up, from the basic physical entities to higher forms of\norganization. For example, thought is caused by the physical\ncomponents of the brain. Reductionism allows for weak emergence but\nnot strong emergence and top-down causation (Davies 2006, 37).\nPanentheism critiques reductionism as an oversimplification of reality\nand the experience of reality.\n4. Supervenience\nGenerally refers to a relation between properties. Popular usage\nrefers to one property depending on another property such as mind\nbeing a quality that supervenes on physical structures. Analytic\nphilosophy instead emphasizes a logical relation between classes of\nproperties with a variety of understandings of the nature of the\nrelationship (Leuenberger 2008; McLaughlin and Bennett 2014).\n5. Emergence\nA. Meaning:\nEmergence is a process that occurs when a new property arises out\nof a combination of elements. The traditional example is that water\nemerges out of the combination of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in certain\nproportions. The concept of emergence arose in a scientific response\nto reductionistic explanations of reality that failed to recognize the\nimportance of a system as a whole as well as the parts of that whole\n(Clayton 2004a, 85). Four characteristics are involved in emergence:\n1) ontological monism but not physicalism, 2) emergence of properties\nthat are potential in complex objects, but absent from any of the\nobject\u2019s parts, and distinct from any structural property of the\nobject, 3) recognizing distinct levels of causal relations, and 4)\ndownward causation that cannot be reduced to the structural\nmacro-properties (Clayton 2006a, 2\u20134). Emergence may be either\nstrong or weak. Strong emergence understands evolution to produce new\nand distinct levels characterized by their own laws, regularities, or\ncausal forces. Weak emergence holds that the new level follows the\nfundamental causal process of physics (Clayton 2004c, 9). Strong\nemergence is also known as ontological emergence and weak as\nepistemological emergence (Clayton 2006b, 67). Strong emergence holds\nthat genuinely new causal agents or processes come into existence over\nthe course of evolutionary history. Weak emergence insists that as new\npatterns emerge, the fundamental processes remain ultimately\nphysical.\nB. Role in panentheism:\nEmergence as a scientific concept helps explain the\n\u201cin\u201d of panentheism (Clayton 2004a, 84). The scientific\nrecognition of the limitations of reductionistic understandings of\nreality led to an interest in emergence as recognition of the\nimportance of the system as a whole as well as the parts of the whole\n(Clayton 2004a, 85). Further, the scientific understanding of matter\nas having a propensity to self-organization leading to a more and more\ncomplex system makes possible an internalist understanding of\nGod\u2019s action and creativity (Clayton 2001, 209). Emergence\nprovides the best current way to understand the immanence of God in\nthe world (Clayton 2004a, 87) by exemplifying the radically different\nsorts of inclusion relations found in the natural world (Clayton\n2008a, 132).\n6. Top-Down Causation\nMore complex levels of objects or events affect less complex\nelements. A common example of top-down causation is the effect of\nthought upon a person\u2019s body. This contrasts with bottom-up\ncausation where the simple is the cause of the more complex. In\nbottom-up causation, physical elements cause other, more complex,\nobjects or events. Scientists debate the possibility of top-down\ncausation (Davies 2006).\n7. Entanglement\nIn quantum theory, the correlation of two particles that originate\nin a single event even though separated from each other by significant\ndistance. Entangled objects behave in ways that cannot be predicted on\nthe basis of their individual properties. The impossibility of\nprediction can be understood epistemically if behavior is considered\nthe result of an average of many similar measurements or ontologically\nif behavior results from the existence of the world in an indefinite\nstate prior to measurement. Both Bohr\u2019s indeterministic and\nBohm\u2019s deterministic understandings of quantum theory accept\nthis relational understanding of physical processes. Understanding the\nworld as composed of persistent relationships among particles that are\nphysically separated provides a model based in science for\nunderstanding God\u2019s relation to the world. God\u2019s influence\ncan be present at the level of individual events although this\nentanglement would remain hidden from a local perspective. However,\nthe implications of entanglement for concepts of causality become even\nmore complex when considering the relation between God and the world.\nPolkinghorne suggests that causality may be active information,\n\u201cpattern-forming operations\u201d of what might be called\n\u201cthe causal principle\u201d, rather than an exchange of energy\n(2010, 9).\n\n\nAlthough numerous meanings have been attributed to the\n\u201cin\u201d in panentheism (Clayton 2004b, 253), the more\nsignificant meanings are:\n\n1. Locative\nLocation that is included in a broader location. For example,\nsomething may be located in a certain part of a room. Such a meaning\nis problematic in reference to God because of the common understanding\nthat God is not limited by spatial categories. If spatial categories\ndo not apply to God in ordinary usage, to say something is located in\nGod becomes problematic. \u201cIn\u201d then takes on metaphysical\nmeanings.\n2. Metaphysical basis for being\nBeings come into existence and continue to exist due to the\npresence of divine Being. The concept of participation in both\nclassical theism and panentheism often includes the understanding that\nthe world comes into being and continues to exist through taking part\nin God\u2019s Being (Clayton 2008a, 118\u2013119).\n3. Metaphysical-Epistemological basis for being\nPresence in God provides both identity and being. Karl\nKrause\u2019s panentheism asserted a metaphysical structure that\ninvolved both how an entity differs from other entities\n(epistemological identity) and what it is in itself (ontological\nstatus) (G\u00f6cke 2013a).\n4. Metaphysical interactive potential\nNeither God\u2019s actions nor the world is completely\ndetermined. This lack of complete determination leads to an\nunpredictable self-organizing relation of both God and the world based\non prior actualizations of each. \u201cThe \u2018en\u2019\ndesignates an active indeterminacy, a commingling of unpredictable,\nand yet recapitulatory, self-organizing relations\u201d (Keller 2003,\n219).\n5. Emergence metaphor\nA more complex entity comes from at least a partial source.\n6. Mind/Body analogy\nThe mind provides structure and direction to the organization of\nthe organism of the body. The world is God\u2019s body in the sense\nthat the world actualizes God as specifically who God is and manifests\nGod while different from God.\n7. Part/Whole analogy\nA particular exists in relation to something that is greater and\ndifferent from any of its parts and the total sum of the parts. The\nworld is in God because the world shares in the greater unity of\nGod\u2019s being and action.\n\n",
