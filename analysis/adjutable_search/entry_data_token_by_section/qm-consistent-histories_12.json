    "main_text": "Quantum Reasoning || General principles\n5.1 General principles\nThe histories interpretation of quantum mechanics, as noted\nearlier, is probabilistic, and hence the processes of reasoning are\nthose that scientists generally use for probabilistic models. This\nrequires a method of assigning probabilities along with procedures for\ndrawing inferences, usually in the form of conditional\nprobabilities. In both these respects quantum theory resembles other\napplications of probabilistic reasoning. The main difference is the\nnecessity in the quantum case of paying close attention to the problem\nof choosing a sample space (which then determines the event algebra)\nor framework, and then confining the logical reasoning process, from\nassumptions to conclusions, to a single framework. We have\nalready encountered some applications of this single framework rule,\nand additional ones are discussed later, but at this point it is\nuseful to summarize some of the basic principles involved, which can\nbe conveniently placed under four headings:\n\n(R1)\n\nLiberty. The physicist is free to employ as many frameworks as desired\nwhen constructing descriptions of a particular quantum system,\nprovided the principle R3 below is strictly observed.\n\n(R2)\n\nEquality. No framework is more fundamental than any other; in\nparticular, there is no \u201ctrue\u201d framework, no framework\nthat is \u201csingled out by nature\u201d.\n(R3)\n\nIncompatibility. The single framework rule: incompatible frameworks\nare never to be combined into a single quantum\ndescription. The (probabilistic) reasoning process starting from\nassumptions (or data) and leading to conclusions must be carried out\nusing a single framework.\n(R4)\n\nUtility. Some frameworks are more useful than others for answering\nparticular questions about a quantum system.\n\nThe reasoning process begins with some initial data, which\nmay reflect some knowledge of the system under discussion or may be\npurely hypothetical. Here \u201cinitial\u201d refers to the\nbeginning of a logical argument, not necessarily to the initial state\nof a quantum system, though the latter is often included in the\ninitial data. These data must then be expressed in appropriate quantum\nterms as some sort of property or properties, subspaces of an\nappropriate Hilbert space, which could be a space of histories, all\nbelonging to a single framework or event algebra, principle\nR3. Generally there will be more than one framework that can contain\nthe initial data, and the physicist is at liberty to choose among\nthese possibilities, R1. However, the types of conclusions which can\nbe drawn using a particular framework (and thus event algebra) will\ndepend upon the framework, and for this reason the physicist\u2019s\ninterests can, and in general will, influence the choice of\nframework. It is utility, R4, which determines this choice; from a\nfundamental point of view all frameworks are equally good, R2.\nThe link between initial data and the conclusions one can draw from\nthem will be probabilistic (sometimes with probabilities 0 or 1, hence\ndeterministic). One might be concerned that the flexibility in\nframework choice provided by R1 and R2 could lead to different results\nwhen using different frameworks. However, it is straightforward to\nshow, see Ch. 16 of Griffiths (2002a),\nthat as long as both frameworks contain all the events needed to\nexpress the initial data and also those needed for drawing\nconclusions, the probabilities linking data and conclusions will be\nidentical even if the two frameworks in question are mutually\nincompatible. This ensures an overall consistency. The discussion of\nquantum preparation and measurement found in\n section 7 below will show how principles\nof quantum reasoning apply to\nmeasurements, a topic that has given rise to a lot of confusion.\n",
