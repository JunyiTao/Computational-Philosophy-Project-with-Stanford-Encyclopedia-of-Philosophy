    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views || Propositional justification vs. doxastic justification\n4.5 Propositional justification vs. doxastic justification\n\nFinally, Paul Silva (2017) and Declan Smithies (2019) each\nargue\u2014though in different ways\u2014that we can resolve the\nconflict by distinguishing between propositional and doxastic\njustification. (Also see Ye 2020 for objections to the move to\ndoxastic justification in this context.) Let us consider Silva\u2019s\nproposal first. An agent like Aisha, he argues, is\npropositionally justified in believing G, and in\nbelieving that her evidence may well not support G. But she\ncannot come to rationally hold the belief that G: in\nother words, she cannot be doxastically justified in\nbelieving G. Silva\u2019s argument for this claim is in part\nan inference to the best explanation: although Aisha\u2019s evidence\nsupports G, it seems irrational for Aisha to act on that\nbelief, suggesting that Aisha lacks knowledge of G. If\nAisha\u2019s belief is propositionally justified but not known, this\nin turn suggests that the belief is not doxastically justified. (See\nalso van Wietmarschen 2013 for a similar proposal in the case of peer\ndisagreement. Van Wietmarschen\u2019s argument does not appeal to\nknowledge; rather, he argues directly that an agent\u2019s belief is\nnot well-grounded, or doxastically justified, if her basis for holding\nit does not respond to her higher-order evidence.)\n\nSmithies (2019) invokes this distinction to a slightly different end.\nAs mentioned above, he argues that we can never be propositionally\njustified in believing falsehoods about what our evidence\nsupports\u2014so, Aisha is propositionally justified in believing\nG, and propositionally justified in believing that\nher evidence supports this. But assuming that Aisha is a normal,\nnon-ideal believer, her own doxastic dispositions won\u2019t be\nsensitive enough to the evidence to safely track her propositional\njustification. This means that she can\u2019t be doxastically\njustified in believing that her evidence supports G.\nInterestingly, Smithies argues that in this case a non-ideal agent\nlike Aisha should be epistemically akratic; the ideal,\nnon-akratic state isn\u2019t available to her, and an akratic state\nis, he argues, the best she can do.\n",
