    "main_text": "Coincident Objects\n2. Coincident Objects\n\nThe most popular reply to the puzzle of material constitution is to\nembrace the conclusion: Lump and Statue exist at the same place at the\nsame time, but differ in their historical and modal properties, so it\nis possible for there to be two material objects in the same place at\nthe same time. This view is sometimes referred to as the\nconstitution view since it holds that the statue is constituted\nby, but not identical to, the lump of clay from which it is formed. In\na slogan: constitution is not identity (Johnston 1992).\nConstitution is distinguished from identity insofar as it is an\nasymmetric relation\u2014Lump constitutes Statue, but not\nvice versa. Constitution is also taken to be a\ndependence relation\u2014as David Wiggins (1968, p. 91) puts\nit, the statue \u201cconsists in\u201d and is \u201cnothing over\nand above\u201d the lump of clay. (For more on the nature of\nconstitution, see Wasserman 2004.)\n\nThe constitution view is extremely popular, having been defended by\nWiggins (1968), Doepke (1982), Lowe (1983, 1995, 2003), Simons (1985),\nYablo (1987), Oderberg (1996), Baker (1997, 2000, 2002), Thomson\n(1998), Shoemaker (1999), Fine (2003), Koslicki (2008), and many\nothers. Indeed, the view is so common, it is sometimes called\n\u201cthe standard account\u201d (Burke 1992). Why not join the\ncrowd?\n\n\u201cJust try to walk through a wall,\u201d quips the skeptic.\n\u201cTwo things can\u2019t be in the same place at the same\ntime!\u201d We will call this the impenetrability objection,\nsince it appeals to the common idea that impenetrability is the mark\nof the material (Descartes 1641 [1993, p. 13]).\n\nThe constitution theorist has a ready reply to the this objection.\nUnlike you and the wall, David and Lump share the same parts, and this\nmaterial coincidence explains how they are able to occupy the\nsame place at the same time (Wiggins 1968). Material coincidence also\nhelps to answer another common complaint. Suppose that Lump weighs\n10lbs. David will obviously weigh the same. So why don\u2019t you get\na reading of 20lbs. when you place both on the scale? (Lewis 1986, p.\n252) Answer: because the two objects share the same weight as\na result of sharing the same parts (Zimmerman 1995, p. 89, fn. 57).\nHere it is important to note that we do not determine the weight of a\nwall, for example, by summing up the weight of its bricks and\nits constituent molecules, since that would involve counting some parts\nmore than once. According to the constitution theorist, weighing David\nand Lump would involve the same kind of double-counting.\n\nMaterial coincidence may explain how spatial coincidence is possible,\nbut what about material coincidence itself? On the face of it, the\nclaim that different things can be made up out of the exact same parts\nis no more plausible than the claim that different things can be\nlocated in the exact same place. We will call this the\nextensionality objection, since it appeals to the common idea\nthat wholes are individuated by their parts in the same way that sets\nare individuated by their members.\n\nOne obvious response to this objection is to reject extensionality\n(Thomson 1983). However, this move comes at a cost since it requires\ngiving up on classical\n mereology.\n A second response is to deny that objects like David and Lump share\nall their material parts. For example, Baker (2000, p. 81)\nsuggests that David\u2019s nose is a part of David, but not a part of Lump.\nA third response is to grant that coinciding objects share all their\nmaterial parts, while insisting that they differ in some\nnon-material aspect (see, for example, Rea 1998, McDaniel\n2001. Paul 2002, Koslicki 2008, and Brower 2014). The most familiar\nversion of this view traces back to Aristotelian idea that material\nobjects are compounds of matter and form (see\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n\nWhether or not David and Lump share all the same parts, it is clear\nthat they share many of the same properties. Both have the same\nweight, the same size, and the same shape. Indeed, the two seem to be\nperfect duplicates, right down to their sub-atomic structure. But this\nraises a puzzle: how could duplicates of this kind differ in their\ntemporal properties, persistence conditions, and the like? We will\nrefer to this as the grounding objection since it appeals to\nthe common idea that such properties must be grounded in more basic\nfeatures of an object. (For different statements of this worry, see\nSimons 1987, pp. 225\u20136, Heller 1990, pp. 30\u20132, Burke 1992,\nZimmerman 1995, pp. 87\u20138, and Olson 2001. The objection is\nsometimes put in terms of\n supervenience,\n but, as Bennett 2004 points out, supervenience is importantly\ndifferent from\n grounding.)\n\nThe natural response to this objection is to appeal to differences in\nkind (Wiggins 1980). Lump can survive being squashed or\nrolled into a ball, for example, since Lump is a mere lump of clay.\nDavid, however, is a statue, and statues cannot survive changes of\nthese kinds. This response, however, pushes back the explanatory\nchallenge: how could intrinsic duplicates like Lump and David differ\nin kind? One option would be to appeal to relational\ndifferences. For example, Lynne Rudder Baker suggests that\nDavid\u2014unlike Lump\u2014is a statue because it is essentially\nrelated to an artworld\u2014it is the sort of thing that is admired,\nreviewed, and discussed (Baker 2000, pp. 35\u201346). The problem is\nthat this seems to get things backwards, for it is natural to say that\nDavid is admired, reviewed, and discussed because it is a\nstatue (rather than a mere lump of clay). A related idea is to\nexplain the difference in kind by appealing to differences in\nhistorical facts (Burke 1992, p. 15). For example, one might\nsay that Lump is a mere lump of clay because it was created by a\nclaymaker whose intent was to create a lump, whereas David was created\nby a sculptor whose intent was to create a statue. One worry for this\nline of response is that it cannot be extended to every case of\nconstitution. For example, Alan Gibbard (1975) asks us to imagine a\ncase in which an artist sculpts a statue of the biblical giant Goliath\nin two pieces\u2014bottom and top\u2014and then brings those pieces\ntogether, simultaneously creating a statue (\u2018Goliath\u2019) and\na new piece of clay (\u2018Lumpl\u2019). The next day, the artist\nsmashes the statue to bits, simultaneously destroying both the statue\nand the lump. The crucial feature of this case is that Lumpl and\nGoliath share all of their historical properties and appear\nto stand in the same relations to everything else around\nthem. For example, both are created at the same time, by the same\nperson, with a single set of intentions. Both are put on display in\nthe same galleries and gazed upon by the same patrons. Both are\ndestroyed at the same time, in exactly the same way. In short, Lumpl\nand Goliath seem to share all their relational properties while still\ndiffering in kind, in which case the explanatory challenge remains\nunanswered. (For recent discussions of this issue, see DeRosset 2011,\nEinheuser 2011, Sutton 2012, Saenz 2015, and Koslicki 2018.)\n\nAt this point we have reviewed the three most common complaints about\nthe constitution view: the impenetrability worry, the extensionality\nobjection, and the grounding problem. A fourth and final concern is\nwhat we might call the anthropic objection (see, for example,\nSosa 1987, Sider 2001, pp. 156\u20138, and section 2.5 of the entry\non\n ordinary objects.)\n So far, we have focused on the question of whether two material\nobjects\u2014like David and Lump\u2014could exist at the same place\nand time. But why stop at two? Consider the mereological\nsum of David and Lump\u2019s material simples. Those simples existed\nlong before David or Lump came into existence, so the sum would appear\nto be another object in addition to the statue and the lump. But why\nstop at three? Consider the instatue that coincides\nwith David whenever that statue is indoors and then goes out of\nexistence whenever David is taken outside (cf. Hirsch 1982, p. 32).\nThere is also the tablestatue (that exists when and only when the\nstatue is on a table), the litstatue (that exists when and only when\nthe statue is in the light), the dinnerstatue (that exists only when\nthe statue\u2019s sculptor is eating dinner), and so on. Ernest Sosa\n(1987) refers to this multiplication of entities as \u201cthe\nexplosion of reality\u201d.\n\nDefenders of the constitution view may try to run from the explosion\nand insist that there are only two (or three, or four) objects in the\nsame place at the same time. But what could justify this exclusionary\nattitude? Granted, we do not normally concern ourselves with\ninstatues, litstatues, and the rest. Ordinary English does not even\nhave sortal terms for discussing these entities. But these\nare facts about our interests and linguistic decisions. Why should we\nthink that there is a correspondence between the sortal terms\nin our language and the kinds of objects in the world? One\nway to explain this correspondence would be to claim that reality is\ndetermined, in some sense, by our conceptual scheme. But the\nconstitution view is normally offered as an alternative to\nanti-realist views of this kind. Perhaps, then, the constitution\ntheorist should accept Sosa\u2019s explosion and say that our\ninattentiveness does not exclude things like instatues and litstatues\nfrom the realm of being? Perhaps all of those objects exist at the\nsame place at the same time, sharing the same parts and the same\nmatter (Yablo 1987, Bennett 2004, Hawthorne 2006, Fairchild 2019)?\nPerhaps. But this brings us very close to adopting a different view\nof material constitution. It is to that view that we now turn.\n",
