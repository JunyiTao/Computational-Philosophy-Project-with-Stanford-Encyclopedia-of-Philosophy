    "main_text": "Epistemology: The Cognitive Functions of Models || Explaining with models\n3.3 Explaining with models\n\nSome models explain. But how can they fulfill this function given that\nthey typically involve idealizations? Do these models explain\ndespite or because of the idealizations\nthey involve? Does an explanatory use of models presuppose that they\nrepresent, or can non-representational models also explain? And what\nkind of explanation do models provide?\n\nThere is a long tradition requesting that the explanans of a\nscientific explanation must be true. We find this requirement in the\ndeductive-nomological model (Hempel 1965) as well as in the more\nrecent literature. For instance, Strevens (2008: 297) claims that \u201cno causal\naccount of explanation \u2026 allows nonveridical models to\nexplain\u201d. For further discussions, see also Colombo et al.\n(2015).\n\nAuthors working in this tradition deny that idealizations make a\npositive contribution to explanation and explore how models can\nexplain despite being idealized. McMullin (1968, 1985) argues that a\ncausal explanation based on an idealized model leaves out only\nfeatures which are irrelevant for the respective explanatory task (see\nalso Salmon 1984 and\nPiccinini and Craver 2011 for a discussion of mechanism sketches).\nFriedman (1974) argues\nthat a more realistic (and hence less idealized) model explains better\non the unification account. The idea is that idealizations can (at\nleast in principle) be de-idealized (for a critical discussion of this\nclaim in the context of the debate about scientific explanations, see\nBatterman 2002; Bokulich 2011; Morrison 2005, 2009; Jebeile and\nKennedy 2015; and Rice 2015). Strevens (2008) argues that an explanatory\ncausal model has to provide an accurate representation of the relevant\ncausal relationships or processes which the model shares with the\ntarget system. The idealized assumptions of a model do not make a\ndifference for the phenomenon under consideration and are therefore\nexplanatorily irrelevant. In contrast, both Potochnik (2017) and Rice\n(2015) argue that models that explain can directly distort\nmany difference-making causes.\n\nAccording to Woodward\u2019s (2003) theory, models are tools to find\nout about the causal relations that hold between certain facts or\nprocesses, and it is these relations that do the explanatory work.\nMore specifically, explanations provide information about patterns of\ncounterfactual dependence between the explanans and the explanandum\nwhich \n\n\nenable us to see what sort of difference it would have made for the\nexplanandum if the factors cited in the explanans had been different\nin various possible ways. (Woodward 2003: 11) \n\n\nAccounts of causal explanation have also led to various claims about\nhow idealized models can provide explanations, exploring to what\nextent idealization allows for the misrepresentation of irrelevant\ncausal factors by the explanatory model (Elgin and Sober 2002;\nStrevens 2004, 2008; Potochnik 2007; Weisberg\n2007, 2013). However, having the causally relevant features in common\nwith real systems continues to play the essential role in showing how\nidealized models can be explanatory.\n\nBut is it really the truth of the explanans that makes the model\nexplanatory? Other authors pursue a more radical line and argue that\nfalse models explain not only despite their falsity, but in\nfact because of their falsity. Cartwright (1983: 44)\nmaintains that \u201cthe truth doesn\u2019t explain much\u201d. In\nher so-called \u201csimulacrum account of explanation\u201d, she\nsuggests that we explain a phenomenon by constructing a model that\nfits the phenomenon into the basic framework of a grand theory (1983:\nCh.\u00a08). On this account, the model itself is the explanation we seek.\nThis squares well with basic scientific intuitions, but it leaves us\nwith the question of what notion of explanation is at work (see also\nElgin and Sober 2002) and of what explanatory function idealizations\nplay in model explanations (Rice 2018, 2019). Wimsatt (2007: Ch.\u00a06)\nstresses the role of false models as means to arrive at true theories.\nBatterman and Rice (2014) argue that models explain because the\ndetails that characterize specific systems do not matter for the\nexplanation. Bokulich (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012) pursues a similar line\nof reasoning and sees the explanatory power of models as being closely\nrelated to their fictional nature. Bokulich (2009) and Kennedy (2012)\npresent non-representational accounts of model explanation (see also\nJebeile and Kennedy 2015). Reiss (2012) and Woody (2004) provide general discussions of the relationship between\nrepresentation and explanation.\n",
