Global Pragmatist Feminisms\n\nNancy McHugh\u2019s (2015) The Limits of Knowledge\nhighlights one of the most compelling aspects of feminist pragmatist\nwork: the need to engage along and across borders. McHugh argues for a\ntransactionally situated approach that aims to generate and sustain a\nvantage point from which to see complex, interconnected problems\nfacing both local and global communities across social, economic,\ncultural, educational, and political divides. This means we begin in\n\u201cthe complexities of the everyday world\u201d and engage with\nthose who are impacted by the results. At its best, such an approach\nseeks out \u201c marginalized views and marginalized\nknowledge,\u201d recognizing that long-standing histories shape the\npresent situation, and that our location is embodied (10). Phillip\nDorstewitz highlights how feminist pragmatists seek to engage\n\u201cat the system\u2019s edges\u201d (370) in order to engage in\nphilosophic-activist work. Susan Griffin (2009) notes that such work\nis critical for fostering \u201c the capacity to recognize the actual\ncircumstances of the world, while simultaneously seeing what lies\nbeneath them\u201d (9).\n\nIn the twentieth century, those identifying as pragmatist feminist\nscholars were mostly from North America. In the first two decades of\nthe twenty-first century, global pragmatist feminist voices have made\nimportant contributions to the field. For instance, Clara Fischer, who\nalso writes on Irish Feminism, turns to John Dewey to address\nbody/mind and emotion/reason dualisms, demonstrating that feminists\ncould draw on the pragmatist tradition to address philosophies of\nembodiment (2018). Dorothy Rogers current projects seek to highlight\nthe work of indigenous and early Mexican feminists who rejected the\nassimilationist agenda in education (2020, Other Internet Resources)\nand Alessandri and Stehn uncover the Mexican influences on Gloria\nAnzaldua\u2019s writing (2020). N\u00faria Sara Miras Boronat,\nUniversitat de Barcelona, organized a feminist pragmatist conference\nin Barcelona in January 2020. She has published on Addams and\npragmatist peace philosophies (2019), and also works on philosophies\nof play, drawing on Mead\u2019s work which was influenced by his\ninteraction with Hull House (2013). There has also recently been a\nshift towards uncovering and exploring the philosophic-activist work\nunfolding beyond the borders of the global north. \n",
