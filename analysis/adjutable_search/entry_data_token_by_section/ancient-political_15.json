Hellenistic Philosophies and Politics\n\nImportant developments in political thinking and practice took place\nunder the Hellenistic kingdoms that supplanted Macedon in its\nsuzerainty over the formerly independent Greek city-states. These\nincluded, for example, a genre of rhetorical letters addressed to\nrulers, and the important analysis of Greek and Roman constitutional\nchange by the second-century Greek historian Polybius (Hahm 2000). As\nkingships flourished among the Hellenistic kingdoms until they in turn\ncame under Roman rule, not only the value of political participation,\nbut also the proper domains of politics, were widely debated.\nDifferent authors would orient themselves respectively to\nstill-surviving polis communities and the various leagues which united\nmany of them in the Hellenistic period; to the kingdoms mentioned\nabove; to the Roman constitution, and eventually to the special forms\nof imperial power which eventually arose therein; and in more\nphilosophical terms, to the cosmos as a whole and all rational beings\nwithin it.\n",
