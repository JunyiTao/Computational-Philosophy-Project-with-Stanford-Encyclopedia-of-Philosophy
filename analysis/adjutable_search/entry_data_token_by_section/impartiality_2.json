    "main_text": "Morality and impartiality || The ideal observer theory\n2.2 The ideal observer theory\n\nRather than being put in terms of an impartial point of view, the\nrelation between morality and impartiality is sometimes made out in\nterms of an impartial agent or observer \u2013 a person who makes\nmoral judgments without being influenced by the sort of contaminating\nbiases or prejudices that tend to arise from the occupation of some\nparticular point of view. (Smith 1976 [1759]; Hume 1978 [1740]; Firth\n1952; Brandt 1954; Hare 1989.) The observer may also be defined as\n\u2018ideal\u2019 in various other ways. It is generally stipulated\nthat she is in possession of all the nonmoral facts that are relevant\nto the judgments she has to make (Firth 1952). It is also fairly\ncommon to assume that she is an ideal reasoner, and thus immune to\nlogical fallacy or mistaken inference, etc. (Indeed, Hare goes so far\nas to state that his \u2018archangel\u2019 possesses\n\u201csuperhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no human\nweaknesses\u201d (Hare 1989, 44).) The \u2018ideal observer\ntheory\u2019 of morality, in its most straightforward form, states\nthat moral judgments simply are the judgments an ideal observer of\nthis sort will make.\n\nAny advantage it has over the conception of morality as an impartial\npoint of view presumably arises from the fact that the ideal observer\nis not completely defined in terms of impartiality. (If she were, the\ntwo conceptions would simply coincide.) Yet many ideal observer\ntheorists seem to accept a characterization of the ideal observer\nwhich concentrates on her impartiality and impersonality. Firth, for\nexample, suggests that the ideal observer is both\n\u2018disinterested,\u2019 in the strong sense of being\n\u2018entirely lacking in particular interests,\u2019 and\n\u2018dispassionate,\u2019 in that she is \u2018incapable of\nexperiencing any emotions at all.\u2019 (Firth, 1952) Defined in this\nway, however, the ideal observer sounds not only impersonal but deeply\nindifferent; and the idea that the moral judgments of a person who had\nneither emotional responses nor particular interests could be trusted,\nlet alone that they might be considered definitive of morality,\nstrikes some critics as highly implausible (Brandt 1979).\n\nSuppose, then, that the ideal observer theorist decides that the\ndefinition of the ideal observer must include more than the\nbare idea of impartiality \u2013 that in addition the observer must\nbe, say, compassionate (and thus not indifferent); and that she must\npossess a considerable facility for proper moral judgments \u2013\npractical wisdom, in the Aristotelian sense. Such a theorist will now\nface a different problem: the more we build into the definition of our\nideal observer, the less useful it becomes as a heuristic device.\nStipulating that the ideal observer is very wise, for example, is not\nvery helpful if we ourselves are not wise, and so have no idea what an\nideally wise observer would choose. Indeed, ideal observer analyses\nthat go too far in this direction seem to become circular \u2013 the\n\u2018ideal\u2019 observer is ideal because she always makes proper\njudgments, those being defined as just those judgments the ideal\nobserver would make (Broad 1959, 263). A circularity of this sort\nseems to be present in John Stuart Mill\u2019s claim:\n\nImpartiality, in short, as an obligation of justice, may be said to\nmean, being exclusively influenced by the considerations which it is\nsupposed ought to influence the particular case in hand; and resisting\nthe solicitation of any motives which prompt to conduct different from\nwhat those considerations would dictate. (Mill 1861/1992, 154; see\nalso Firth 1952, 336)\n\n\nThe ideal observer, then, to be useful, must be given some independent\ndefinition, and not simply defined as \u2018an agent who always gets\nit right.\u2019 The challenge is to find such a definition. Here, as\nwith the conception of morality as defined by an impartial point of\nview, the phenomenon of morally admirable partiality proves a\nparticularly difficult issue. Should we define the ideal observer as\nbeing loyal to her country, or as being above loyalty? If the former,\ncan she serve as an adequate moral example to people who do not share\nher allegiances? If the latter, how can she serve as an adequate\nexample to anyone? Any process of idealization of the sort required to\nmake such a conception work seems likely to result in an individual so\nremoved from the concrete lives and concerns of actual human moral\nagents, that her moral judgments will turn out to be in large part\nirrelevant to the question of how such agents ought to live (see\nWalker 1991).\n",
