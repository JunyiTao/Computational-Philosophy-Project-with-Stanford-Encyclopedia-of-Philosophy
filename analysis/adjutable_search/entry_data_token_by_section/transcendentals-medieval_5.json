    "main_text": "Three Models of the Transcendentals: Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent and Eckhart, and John Duns Scotus || The second model: The theological transformation of the first concepts (Henry of Ghent & Eckhart)\n4.2 The second model: The theological transformation of the first concepts (Henry of Ghent & Eckhart)\n\n\nTypical of the doctrine of the transcendentals of Henry of Ghent\n(\u2020 1293) is his defense of the doctrine of God as first known,\nwhich had been elaborated in the Franciscan tradition by Bonaventure\nand had been rejected by Aquinas. On account of his different\nunderstanding of analogy, not treated as a mode of predication as in\nAquinas, but as the property of a concept, Henry achieves an\nintegration of the divine names in his doctrine of the transcendentals\nas the most general aspects of being that recognizes a priority of the\ndivine over the creaturely within the transcendental concepts as such.\nWhat has been called Henry\u2019s \u201cnew way to God\u201d starts\nwith the acknowledgement that something finite is good and goes on to\npurify this content of \u2018good\u2019 along different degrees of\nabstraction, in order to reach the infinite realization of this content\nin God. The claim is that it can only be understood that something\nfinite is good, if the infinite realization of the good is always\nalready implicitly understood (and the same holds for being and the\nother transcendentals). Naturally, there is a major difference in the\nepistemic status of the evidence, on the one hand, that being and the\nother transcendentals are first known objects in the analysis of\ncognition, and of the evidence, on the other hand, that God is first\nknown, exerting a natural priority within these transcendental concepts\nas such. Whereas God is absolutely yet indistinctly the first known,\n\u2018being\u2019 is distinctly known first. Another important shift\nin comparison to Thomas Aquinas lies in Henry\u2019s identification of\nthe concepts of \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018thing\u2019, i.e. the\nessentialist interpretation of being. Henry construes his doctrine of\nthe transcendentals, quoting Aquinas, as a series of conceptual\nadditions to being as first known, but disagrees with Aquinas as\nregards the meaning of the concept of being: it does not signify the\nactuality of being, but the aspect of essence, for which Aquinas had\nreserved the term \u2018thing\u2019 (res). Although Henry\nfollows Aquinas in his affirmation that only negations and conceptual\nrelations can add something to being without contracting it \u2013 he\nstrongly emphasizes the origin of these conceptual additions in the\nintellect \u2013, he asserts that the \u2018negation of\nnegation\u2019 expressed by \u2018the one\u2019 as adding the aspect\nof indivision is something positive.\n\n\nMeister Eckhart (ca. 1260\u20131328) presents the same model of the\ntranscendental as Henry of Ghent. The doctrine of the transcendentals\nhas an unprecedented importance in Eckhart\u2019s project of the\nOpus tripartitum, where the transcendental metaphysics of the\nOpus propositionum is foundational both for the systematic\ntheology in the Opus quaestionum and for the exegesis of the\nBible in the Opus expositionum et sermonum. The identification\nof the transcendentals with God, which is Eckhart\u2019s version of\nthe doctrine of God as first known, the doctrine of analogy, and the\ninclusion of spiritual perfections, such as justice and wisdom, among\nthe transcendentals, all betray the influence of Henry of Ghent.\n",
