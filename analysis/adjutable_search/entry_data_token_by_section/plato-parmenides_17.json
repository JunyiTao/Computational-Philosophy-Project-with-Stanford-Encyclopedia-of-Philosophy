The\nexceptions are D5A1C1, D5A1C2, D5A3C, D5A5C1, D5A8C1, D5A8C2, and\nD5A10C1, which do not depend on any previously established\nConclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 212\u2013223).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D5 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first four Deductions, the Arguments of D5 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1, D2, and the\nAppendix (but not D3 or D4). Again, it appears that most of the\npremises are, at least from Plato\u2019s point of view, either\ndefinitionally true or self-evident. Thus it appears that, from\nPlato\u2019s point of view, D5 establishes, without reliance on\nPurity-F or any other potentially problematic assumption, that if the\none is not, then the one has a host of contrary properties. In\nother words, as Plato sees it, D5 establishes that if the one is not,\nthen Purity-F is false.\n\n\nWhen combined with the results of D1 and D2 (or, alternatively, with\nthe results of D3 and D4), this result entails that Purity-F is in fact\nfalse. To see this, recall that D1 and D2 (as well as D3 and D4)\ntogether entail that if the one is, then Purity-F is false. Now,\nby D5, if the one is not, then Purity-F is false. So,\nwhether the one is or is not, Purity-F is false. So\nPurity-F is false.\n",
