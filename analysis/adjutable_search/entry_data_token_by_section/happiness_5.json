    "main_text": "Theories of happiness || Hedonism versus emotional state\n2.4 Hedonism versus emotional state\n\nA second set of issues concerns the differences between the two\naffect-based views, hedonism and emotional state. The appeal of\nhedonism is fairly obvious: the pleasantness of our experience is\nplainly a matter of great significance; many have claimed it to be the\nonly thing that matters. What, by contrast, motivates the\nemotional state account, which bears obvious similarities to hedonism\nyet excludes many pleasures from happiness? The question of motivation\nappears to be the chief worry facing the emotional state theory:\nwhat\u2019s to be gained by focusing on emotional state rather than\npleasure?\n\nOne argument for taking such a view is intuitive: some find it\nimplausible to think that psychologically superficial pleasures\ninvariably make a difference in how happy one is\u2014the typical\npleasure of eating a cracker, say, or even the intense pleasure of an\norgasm that nonetheless fails to move one, as can happen with\nmeaningless sexual activity. The intuitive distinction seems akin to\ndistinctions made by some ancient philosophers; consider, for\ninstance, the following passage from Epictetus\u2019s\nDiscourses:\n\n\u2018I have a headache.\u2019 Well, do not say \u2018Alas!\u2019\n\u2018I have an earache.\u2019 Do not say \u2018Alas!\u2019 And I\nam not saying that it is not permissible to groan, only do not\ngroan in the centre of your being. (Discourses, 1.18.19,\nemphasis added).\n\nThe Stoics did not expect us never to feel unpleasant sensations,\nwhich would plainly be impossible; rather, the idea was not to let\nsuch things get to us, to impact our emotional\nconditions.\n\nWhy should anyone care to press such a distinction in characterizing\nhappiness? For most people, the hedonic difference between happiness\non an emotional state versus a hedonistic view is probably minimal.\nBut while little will be lost, what will be gained? One possibility is\nthat the more \u201ccentral\u201d affects involving our emotional\nconditions may bear a special relation to the person or the\nself, whereas more \u201cperipheral\u201d affects, like the\npleasantness of eating a cracker, might pertain to the subpersonal\naspects of our psychologies. Since well-being is commonly linked to\nideas of self-fulfillment, this sort of distinction might signal a\ndifference in the importance of these states. Another reason to focus\non emotional condition rather than experience alone may be the greater\npsychological depth of the former: its impact on our mental lives,\nphysiology, and behavior is arguably deeper and more pervasive. This\nenhances the explanatory and predictive significance of happiness, and\nmore importantly its desirability: happiness on this view is not\nmerely pleasant, but a major source of pleasure and other good\noutcomes (Fredrickson 2004, Lyubomirsky, King et al. 2005).\nCompare health on this score: while many think it matters chiefly or\nentirely because of its connection with pleasure, there are few\nskeptics about the importance of health. As well, emotional state\nviews may capture the idea that happiness concerns the\nindividual\u2019s psychological orientation or disposition:\nto be happy, on an emotional state theory, is not just to be subjected\nto a certain sequence of experiences, but for one\u2019s very being\nto manifest a favorable orientation toward the conditions of\none\u2019s life\u2014a kind of psychic affirmation of one\u2019s\nlife. This reflects a point of similarity with life satisfaction views\nof happiness: contra hedonism, both views take happiness to be\nsubstantially dispositional, involving some sort of favorable\norientation toward one\u2019s life. But life satisfaction views tend\nto emphasize reflective or rational endorsement, whereas emotional\nstate views emphasize the verdicts of our emotional natures.\n\nWhile hedonism and emotional state theories are major contenders in\nthe contemporary literature, all affect-based theories confront the\nworries, noted earlier, that motivate life satisfaction\nviews\u2014notably, their looser connection with people\u2019s\npriorities, as well as their limited ability to reflect the quality of\npeople\u2019s lives taken as a whole.\n",
