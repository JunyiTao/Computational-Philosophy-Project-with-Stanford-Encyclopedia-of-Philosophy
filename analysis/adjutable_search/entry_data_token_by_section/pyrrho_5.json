    "main_text": "\u201cThe Nature of the Divine and the Good\u201d\n6. \u201cThe Nature of the Divine and the Good\u201d\n\nThere is one further, highly problematic fragment of Timon that seems\nto belong in the area of practical philosophy. This is a set of four\nlines of verse that make reference to \u201cthe nature of the divine\nand the good\u201d. There is no consensus on how to translate these\nlines, and different translations yield very different consequences\nfor interpretation. The first two lines can be rendered either\n\n\n\n(A)\n\u201cFor I will say, as it appears to me to be,\n\nA word of truth, having a correct standard:\u201d \n\nor\n  \n\n(B)\n\u201cFor I will say, as it is plain to me that it is,\n\nA word of truth, having a correct standard:\u201d  \n\n\nThe second two lines can be rendered either\n\n\n\n(C)\n\u201cThat the nature of the divine and the good is eternal,\n\nFrom which a most even-tempered life for a man is derived.\u201d\n\n\nor\n  \n\n(D)\n\u201cThat the nature of the divine and the good is at any time\n\nThat from which life becomes most even-tempered for a man.\u201d\n \n\n\nThere are numerous other disputes over the translation, but these\nalternatives put on display most of the central options for\ninterpretation.\n\nThe lines are quoted by Sextus Empiricus (M 11.20); there is\nno further trace of them in the surviving record. The context in which\nSextus introduces them shows that he is inclined to understand the\nfirst couplet according to reading (A) rather than reading( B); but he\nsuggests that he is not sure about this. The speaker into whose mouth\nTimon put these lines is never identified, but it has generally been\nassumed to be Pyrrho.\n\nIf one understands the second couplet according to reading (C), then\nthe speaker is apparently endorsing a position that attributes\ndefinite natures to things; and this appears flatly inconsistent with\nthe Pyrrho of the Aristocles passage, on any of the readings we\nhave considered. The tension is especially bad if one reads the first\ncouplet according to reading (B), in which case the speaker is\ninsisting that he is in possession of the truth. But even on reading\n(A), where the effect is to weaken the assertion to one about what\nappears to the speaker to be the case, the statement about \u201cthe\nnature of the divine and the good\u201d seems strikingly out of\nkeeping with the rest of what we hear about Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy.\nIt has been suggested that Pyrrho made an exception, in the case of\nthe divine and the good, to his general prohibition on attributing\ndefinite natures to things; but it is hard to see the motivation for\nsuch a move, and this interpretation has not been generally accepted.\nIt is true that Cicero speaks of Pyrrho as holding that virtue is the\nsole good, and that no distinctions of value are to be drawn among\nthings other than virtue and vice. However, as was mentioned earlier,\nCicero always attributes this view to Pyrrho alongside the unorthodox\nStoic Aristo of Chios; he never gives any details about Pyrrho\u2019s\nthinking specifically. We know from other sources that Aristo did hold\nthis position; and, as we have seen, there is good reason to think\nthat Pyrrho did refrain quite generally from attributing positive or\nnegative value to ordinary objects of concern (things other than\nvirtue and vice), which is one part of the position Cicero attributes\nto him and Aristo. So it looks as if Cicero has been misled (probably\nby the sketchiness of the information in his source) into thinking\nthat Pyrrho agreed with Aristo in both parts of his position rather\nthan in just one part. At any rate, Cicero cannot be regarded as\noffering any credible support for an interpretation of Pyrrho that has\nhim believing in a natural good; again, this is just too discordant\nwith the remainder of the evidence.\n\nReading (D) of Timon\u2019s second couplet (which is due, with minor\nmodifications, to Burnyeat (1980)) is intended to eliminate the\ntroublesome reference to an eternal real nature. According to this\ninterpretation, the phrase \u201cthe nature of the divine and the\ngood\u201d refers simply to a characteristic that is attributed to\nPyrrho, and labeled by poetic hyperbole as \u2018divine\u2019, in\nanother fragment of Timon, namely his extraordinary tranquility; the\ncouplet as a whole, then, is saying that tranquility is the source of\nan even-tempered life. And if one combines this with the less dogmatic\nreading (A) of the first couplet, this yields a set of remarks that\nare not obviously in conflict with anything else in the record on\nPyrrho.\n\nThe acceptability of the translation in reading (D) is not beyond\nquestion. There is also some question whether the claim that\ntranquility is the source of an even-tempered life is anything more\nthan vacuous. However, if one assumes that Pyrrho is the speaker of\nthese lines, then this interpretation or something close to it seems\nto be the only way to rescue his thought (as reported by Timon) from\ninconsistency. Another possibility, an interpretatively less\nburdensome one, is to drop the assumption that Pyrrho is the speaker;\nin this case, there is no reason to assume that the thought expressed\nby the lines must be consistent with what we know of Pyrrho\u2019s\nphilosophy. But if one takes this option, one must devise an\nalternative explanation for why Timon would have written these\nlines\u2014including some account of who else the speaker might be.\nThis challenge has recently been taken up in Clayman (2009), chapter\n2. Clayman argues that the speaker is Timon himself, and that the\nlines serve a programmatic function at the opening of the poem; in\nlight of parallel passages in other early Hellenistic poetry, the\nreference to truth is understood as an allusion to poetic\nverisimilitude rather than to anything philosophically problematic.\nFinally, it has been suggested (in Svavarsson 2002) that\nmuthon, rendered in both readings (A) and (B) by\n\u201cword\u201d, should rather be understood as \u201cmyth\u201d\nin the sense of \u201cfiction\u201d (and \u201cof truth\u201d\nlinked instead, as is linguistically quite possible, with\n\u201cstandard\u201d). In this case, again, there is no difficulty\nin understanding the second couplet as expressing a dogmatic position;\nindeed, such a reading is only to be expected, since the position is\nbeing debunked, not advocated. Green (2017) has extended\nSvavarsson\u2019s suggestion by proposing that \u201cword of\ntruth\u201d and \u201ccorrect standard\u201d are to be understood\nsarcastically rather than at face value, making fun of other\nthinkers\u2019 belief in these things (which would also render the\nthought less dogmatic; it would not simply be a declaration of\nfalsehood). But whether the word muthos, all by itself, can\ncarry this weight of significance\u2014or whether, if that is what\nTimon had intended, he would not have chosen some less ambiguous means\nof expressing it\u2014is open to question. It is fair to say that no\nresolution of these matters is in sight.\n",
