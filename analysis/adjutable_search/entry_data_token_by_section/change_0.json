    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe most general conception of change is simply difference or\nnonidentity in the features of things. Thus we speak of the change of\ntemperature from place-to-place along a body, or the change in\natmospheric pressures from place-to-place as recorded by isobars, or\nthe change of height of the surface of the earth as recorded by a\ncontour map. Contour lines record sameness in quantities (such as 100\nmetres) from the same quantity-kind (such as height), and the\ndifferences recorded by different contour lines are\nquantity-differences (100 metres as opposed to 200 metres). The\nphilosophical question here is how to construe such statements of\nidentity and nonidentity, and it seems that the problem of universals\nis the main issue.\n\n\nA narrower usage of \u201cchange\u201d is exemplified by change in\nthe properties of a body over time, that is temporal change. This\nessay will focus on temporal change. We begin by separating the\nconcept of change from several cognate concepts, specifically cause,\ntime and motion. Then we briefly survey attempts by such thinkers as\nParmenides and McTaggart to deny change. There follows an account of\nthe problem of the instant of change, where it is concluded that the\nproblem is too general to admit a single solution, but requires\nspecification of further metaphysical principles envisaged as\nconstraints on a type of solution. The final three sections, the bulk\nof the essay, consider the question of the consistency or\ninconsistency of change, which in one way or another looms over all\nour discussions. It emerges that the case for change as an\ninconsistent process is stronger than might be expected.\n",
