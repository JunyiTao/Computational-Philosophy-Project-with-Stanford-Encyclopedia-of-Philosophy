Von Wright\u2019s deontic logic and Prior\u2019s tense\nlogic were the first major successes in this field.\n\n\nPrior was convinced that no satisfactory metalinguistic\nanalysis can be given of sentences having the general modal form\n\u2018It is \u2014 that \\(p\\)\u2019. In Formal Logic\nhe wrote: \u2018It is quite plain, for example, that I am not talking\nabout the sentence \u201cSocrates is dead\u201d when I say \u201cI\nwish that Socrates were dead\u201d\u2019 (1955a: 219). In Time\nand Modality he reiterated the point, now in connection with the\ntenses: \u2018\u201cProfessor Carnap will be flying to the\nmoon\u201d \u2026 is quite obviously a statement about Professor\nCarnap, and quite obviously not a statement about the statement\n\u201cProfessor Carnap is flying to the moon\u201d\u2019 (1957:\n8).\n\n\nWhat, then, is the semantic value of an expression replacing\n\\(p\\) in a sentence of the general modal form \u2018It is \u2014\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019? Certainly not a truth value, as is the case\nwith the standard extensional propositional calculus, for substituting\na different expression with the same truth value into the sentence of\nthe form \u2018It is \u2014 that \\(p\\)\u2019 may alter the\ntruth value of the latter sentence. Prior\u2019s answer\u2014and in a\nsense it amounts to a rejection of the question\u2014is that modal\nfunctions take propositions as arguments, but propositions are logical\nconstructions. All sentences containing the word\n\u2018proposition\u2019\u2014including such sentences as \u2018A\nmodal operator expresses a function from propositions to truth\nvalues\u2019\u2014mean no more and no less than sentences which\ncontain neither the word \u2018proposition\u2019 nor an equivalent.\nIn essence, Prior\u2019s view is that there are intensional contexts\nbut no intensions. For the last six years of his life he worked on a\nbook that was to give systematic expression to his views on\npropositions. The incomplete manuscript, which Prior had entitled\nObjects of Thought, was published posthumously in 1971.\n",
