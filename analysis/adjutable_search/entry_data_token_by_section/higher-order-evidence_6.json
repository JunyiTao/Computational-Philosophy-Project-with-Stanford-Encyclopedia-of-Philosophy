    "main_text": "Accommodating the Import of Higher-Order Evidence || Independence principles\n3.1 Independence principles\n\nIndependence principles say, roughly, that higher-order evidence calls\nfor us to set aside some of our evidence, and not rely on it in our\nreasoning. This thought is required to rule out the kind of dogmatic\nresponse to higher-order evidence discussed above: if we did\nnot have to set aside our first-order evidence and reasoning,\nit would be rational to rely on it to dismiss any higher-order doubt.\nIndependence raises a number of questions. How can it be rational to\nignore evidence? What, exactly, do we have to ignore? And does\nIndependence open the door to skepticism?\n\nSome balk at Independence because it simply seems irrational to ignore\nevidence (see Kelly 2005, 2010, for example). Kelly (2010) presents\nthe objection roughly like this: if higher-order evidence requires us\nto ignore our first-order evidence, he asks, doesn\u2019t that make\nrationality far too easy to come by? It appears that someone could\nbotch their first-order reasoning completely, adjust their confidence\nin the face of higher-order evidence, and (since they are now\nobligated to ignore the first-order considerations) have all of their\nearlier rational mistakes forgiven. Christensen (2011) disagrees,\narguing that while someone in this situation may have responded to\npart of her evidence correctly, we can still distinguish\nbetween her final belief state and the belief state of someone who\ndidn\u2019t make the initial mistake: someone who did every step\nproperly is more rational than someone who did not. (See Sliwa &\nHorowitz 2015 for further discussion; see Schoenfield 2015a for an\nobjection.)\n\nIf Independence is right, there are remaining questions about exactly\nwhat needs to be set aside\u2014evidence? Reasoning? Something\nelse?\u2014and under what circumstances. As several authors have\nbrought out, it is not quite right to simply say that our assessment\nmust be independent of our first-order reasoning; often, facts\nabout that reasoning, sometimes involving very specific aspects\nof our evidence, are highly relevant and it would be irrational to\nignore them. (See Arsenault & Irving 2012, Kelly 2013, and Lord\n2014 for versions of this objection; see Christensen 2018 and 2019 for\nreplies.) It is also not quite right to say that our assessment must\nbe independent of our first-order evidence; often, a single piece of\nevidence has several different effects, some of which should be set\naside and others of which should be taken into account. See\nChristensen 2019 for detailed discussion of these complexities and\nothers.\n\nA different sort of question concerns how much evidence,\ninformation, or background beliefs we must set aside, and whether\nthere are any limits on this. Intuitively, the scope of what we must\nset aside depends on the scope of higher-order undermining we receive,\nand which instances or types of reasoning are called into question.\nBut how far can it go? What if everything is called into\nquestion? Considering this possibility leads to paradox. On the one\nhand, reason to universally doubt our reasoning seems to justify\nskepticism across the board. On the other hand, the way we would\narrive at that skeptical state would be by using our reasoning\u2026\nwhich has been, by hypothesis, called into question. Some\nepistemologists have suggested that since there is no stable and\nconsistent response to such cases, we ought to conclude that universal\ndefeat is impossible. But this response is hard to reconcile with the\nfact that defeat comes on a spectrum; if the extreme cases are\nimpossible, what about the intermediate cases? (For further\ndiscussion, see Egan & Elga 2005, Enoch 2010, Sliwa & Horowitz\n2015, Schoenfield 2015a, Christensen 2010a, 2019. See also the entry\non\n epistemic self-doubt\n for further discussion.)\n\nEven if we restrict our attention to more moderate cases of\nundermining, one still might wonder whether rationality can ask us to\ndoubt so much that we end up skeptics about large and important\ndomains (even if we are not skeptics across the board). Could it be\nrational for us to come to doubt, for example, all of our moral or\nreligious beliefs on the basis of higher-order undermining? Elga\n(2007) argues (again in the context of peer disagreement) that we\nshould not worry about this possibility. In order to doubt all of our\nmoral beliefs, for example, we must have independent grounds to judge\nthese beliefs to be unreliable. But if we set aside all of our moral\nbeliefs, Elga argues, we won\u2019t have enough left over to make any\nsort of reliability judgment\u2014and therefore, won\u2019t have\nrational grounds for doubt. So undermining can only happen locally.\n(And even then, he argues, many of our religious and moral beliefs\nwill be safe, since on any particular occasion, the targeted religious\nor moral belief will be supported by our other moral and religious\nbeliefs\u2014the ones that aren\u2019t called into question.) See\nVavova 2018 and Christensen 2011 for further discussion of this point.\nVavova and Christensen both differentiate between two possible ways to\nformulate Independence: one on which you must revise your beliefs\ninsofar as you fail to have good independent reason to\ntrust them, and one on which you must revise insofar as you\nhave good independent reason to think that you\u2019re\nmistaken. They argue that the first formulation has skeptical\nresults, while the second avoids them.\n",
