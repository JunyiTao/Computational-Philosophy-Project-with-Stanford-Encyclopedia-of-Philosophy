    "main_text": "Quantum Time Development || Kinematics\n4.1 Kinematics\nSuppose a coin is tossed three times in succession, with results\nheads (\\(H\\)) or tails (\\(T\\)). In the theory of stochastic processes one\nconstructs a sample space \\(\\SC\\) containing 8 events, let us call\nthem histories: \\(HHH\\), \\(HHT\\), \\(HTH\\), \u2026. Notice that\nformally the same sample space is obtained if instead of a coin tossed\nthree times in a row, three different coins are tossed\nsimultaneously. Since in quantum mechanics the Hilbert space of\nseveral separate systems is constructed as a tensor product of the\nindividual Hilbert spaces, this suggests that the Hilbert space for a\nsystem at a sequence of times, the histories Hilbert space,\ncan be constructed as the tensor product of copies of the Hilbert\nspace for a single time. We write it as\n\\[\\breve \\HC = \\HC_1\\odot\\HC_2\\cdots\\odot\\HC_f \\label{eqn12}\\]\nfor times \\(t_1 <t_2 <\\cdots < t_f\\), where \\(\\odot\\) is\nemployed in place of the usual \\(\\otimes\\) simply to emphasize that a\nsequence of times is involved.\nA single quantum history will typically correspond to a\nprojector\n\\[Y^\\alpha = P_1^{\\alpha_1}\\odot P_2^{\\alpha_2}\\odot\\cdots\nP_f^{\\alpha_f}, \\label{eqn13}\\]\nwhere the superscript \\(\\alpha_m\\) labels different possible\nprojectors at time \\(t_m\\), and \\(\\alpha =\n(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots\\alpha_f)\\) is a composite label for the\nentire history. (Since the square of a projector is the same as the\nprojector, the superscript position is not needed for exponents, and\nit is convenient to reserve the subscript to indicate the time.) If\nfor each time \\(t_m\\) it is the case that \\(\\sum_{\\alpha_m}\nP_m^{\\alpha_m} = I_m\\) it follows that \\(\\sum_\\alpha Y^\\alpha = \\breve\nI\\), the identity operator on \\(\\breve\\HC\\); thus the \\(\\{Y^\\alpha\\}\\) form\na projective decomposition of the identity \\(\\breve I\\), a quantum\nsample space or family of histories, one and only one of\nwhich will actually occur in any given experimental run. The physical\ninterpretation of \\eqref{eqn13} is that the property \\(P_1^{\\alpha_1}\\)\noccurs or is true at time \\(t_1\\), \\(P_2^{\\alpha_2}\\) at time \\(t_2\\), and\nso forth. Indeed, since we live in a quantum world, the\n\u201cclassical\u201d coin-tossing history \\(THT\\) can be written in\nthe form \\eqref{eqn13} using appropriate projectors to represent \\(T\\)\nand \\(H\\). As will be discussed later in section\n6, the histories approach employs the same mathematical procedures\nfor both microscopic and macroscopic physics, consistent with the\nbelief of most physicists that quantum theory applies to phenomena of\nany size.\nSeveral comments are in order. First, the projective decompositions\nof the identity at different times need not be the same. Thus for a\nspin half particle one could have the \\(S_z=\\pm 1/2\\) decomposition at\none time and the \\(S_x=\\pm 1/2\\) decomposition at some later\ntime. And more complicated history-dependent decompositions of\n\\(\\breve I\\) are possible; see the\n Further Reading supplement.\n\nSecond, there is\nno reference to measurements. Events occur or do not occur; whether a\nmeasuring apparatus is involved is entirely irrelevant, although\nhistories can be used to discuss what goes on in a measuring process;\nsee section 7. Third, the projectors in a\nhistory can be coarse-grained and specify only a small amount of\ninformation, e.g., the spin degree of freedom of an atom without\nreference to its position; they do not and generally will not project\nonto pure states. Fourth, there is no direct connection between the\nchoice of projectors entering a history and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\ntime-dependent equation, although in appropriate circumstances the\nlatter can be used to assign probabilities to the different histories\nin a family, as discussed next.\n",
