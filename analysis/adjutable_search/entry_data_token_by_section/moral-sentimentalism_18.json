    "main_text": "Epistemic Sentimentalism || Moral Understanding and Testimony\n6. The Many Moral Sentimentalisms (Reprise)\n\nIt was noted at the beginning that there are many things one can be a\nsentimentalist about. We are now in a position to make some\nobservations about relationships among them. First, explanatory\nsentimentalism is clearly independent of the rest. It is\nperfectly possible that emotions play some significant role in\nexplaining moral judgment, whatever such judgments or moral facts\nconsist in, and whether or not they\u2019re sources of moral\nknowledge. To be sure, if some simple form of judgment sentimentalism\nis true, emotions offer a kind of constitutive explanation of moral\njudgments \u2013 if I\u2019m angry with you, this explains why I\nmorally judge you\u2019ve wronged me, because it constitutes my\njudgment. And explanatory sentimentalism clearly has epistemic\nimplications. If emotions both explain our beliefs and justify them,\nour moral verdicts are vindicated. If, in contrast, emotions explain\nour beliefs but do not justify them \u2013 if explanatory\nsentimentalism is true but epistemic sentimentalism is false \u2013\nwe end up with a skeptical view.\n\nSecond, judgment sentimentalism has an evident kinship with\nmetaphysical sentimentalism. This is so especially for those\ncognitivist versions according to which our judgments attribute\nresponse-dependent properties, which are metaphysically linked to our\nsentimental responses. But there are also contextualists for whom\nmoral judgments describe ordinary natural properties, and fitting\nattitude theorists, for whom moral judgments are about the fittingness\nof attitudes, where facts about fittingness may themselves be\nnon-natural truths.\n\nFinally, epistemic sentimentalism is again in principle\nindependent of other varieties: we\u2019ve seen that one can be a\nmind-independent realist about moral properties while thinking that\nsome suitable emotions provide access to moral truths. But if moral\nfacts are constitutively related to our reactions and our judgments\nare about such facts, we will have a good a priori reason to\nthink that beliefs based on suitable emotions would not easily mislead\nus and may thus amount to knowledge. While different forms of\nsentimentalism are separable from each other, they are thus mutually\nsupportive, if held together.\n",
