For\ninstance, instead of employing usual singular quantification over\ntables and chairs, it is proposed that we use plural quantification\nover mereological atoms arranged tablewise or chairwise (Rosen and\nDorr 2002; Hossack 2000; van Inwagen 1990). For instance, instead of\nsaying that there is a chair in one\u2019s office, one should say\nthat there are some atoms in one\u2019s office arranged chairwise. In\nthis way one appears to avoid committing oneself to the existence of a\nchair. Note that such analyses require PFO+, not just PFO, since the\nnew predicates \u201care arranged \\(F\\)-wise\u201d are\nnon-distributive.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside purely metaphysical worries about such analyses\nas irrelevant to our present concern. What \\(we\\) would like to know\nis what demands these analyses put on the theory PFO+, in particular,\nwhich strains of the Logicality Thesis are needed. The most obvious\ndemands are that PFO+ be applicable to all kinds of simple objects and\nthat it be ontologically innocent, or at least not committed to\ncomplex objects of the sort to be eliminated.\n\nA less obvious demand has to do with the need to analyze ordinary\nplural quantification over complex objects, for instance\n\n(16)\n There are some chairs arranged in a circle.\n\n\nWe have already \u201cused up\u201d ordinary plural quantification\nand predication to eliminate apparent commitment to individual chairs\n(Uzquiano 2004). So in order to analyze (16), we will need something\nlike \u201csuper-plural\u201d quantification \u2014 quantification\nthat stands to ordinary plural quantification as ordinary plural\nquantification stands to singular \u2014 and corresponding\nnon-distributive predication. The legitimacy of such linguistic\nresources was discussed in\n Section 2.4.\n\nThere have also been attempts to use plural logic to eliminate\napparent reference to groups. Instead of referring to the Supreme\nCourt, say, perhaps we might get by with referring plurally to its\nmembers. An obvious challenge for this approach is that a group can\nhave different members at different moments of time and possible\nworlds, while the plurality of its (current and actual) members\nappears to be rigid, temporally as well as modally\n (Section 2.3).\n See (Horden and L\u00f3pez de Sa 2021) for a defense of the\nproposed elimination against such challenges. \n",
