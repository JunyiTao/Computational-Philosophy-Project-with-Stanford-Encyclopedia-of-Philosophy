    "main_text": "The Problem of Optimum Saving || The Overtaking Criterion\n3.3 The Overtaking Criterion\n\n\nWhat was needed was to de-link the question whether infinite\nwell-being integrals converge from the question whether optimum\nconsumption streams exist. That insight was provided by Koopmans (1965)\nand von Weizsacker (1965). The latter author\u2019s re-statement of\nthe problem of optimum saving was as follows:\n\n\nWe say that the feasible consumption stream \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\)\nis superior to a feasible consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) if\nthere exists \\(T \\gt 0\\) such that for all \\(t \\ge T\\),\n\n\\[\\tag{6}\n\\int^t_0 [U(C^*(s))]ds \\ge \\int^t_0 [U(C(s))]ds\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe call \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) optimum if it is superior\nto all other feasible consumption streams.\n\n\nThe condition that is represented in inequality (6) is known as the\nOvertaking Criterion (OC), for that is what it is. OC avoids\nasking whether the integrals on either side of inequality (6) converge\nas \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). If they do, OC reduces to Classical\nUtilitarianism. But OC is able to respond to Ramsey\u2019s saving problem in\na wider class of situations. In his work Koopmans (1965) identified a\ncanonical economic model in which the \\(U\\)-function is bounded\nabove and in which Ramsey Mark II is equivalent to an\noptimization problem that is posed in terms of OC.\n\n\nWhat are we to make of the ethics of discounting the well-beings of\nfuture generations? Ramsey (1928) began by dismissing it but then\nstudied it at the tail end of his paper. DM could of course justify\ndiscounting future well-being if there is a possibiliy of future\nextinction. Sidgwick (1907) himself noted that in the passage quoted\nearlier. If Classical Utilitarianism is taken to commend the expected\nsum of well-beings, then the \u201chazard rate\u201d at date\n\\(t\\) (i.e., the probability of extinction at date \\(t\\)\nconditional on society surviving until \\(t)\\) would appear in the\nexpression for expected well-being as a discount rate for well-being at\n\\(t\\). The question remains whether Classical Utilitarianism would\ninsist on zero-discounting of future utilities in a deterministic\nworld.\n\n\nIn a remarkable pair of works Koopmans (1960, 1972) exposed internal\ncontradictions in ethical reasoning in a deterministic world in both\nRamsey Mark I and Ramsey Mark II. He (and\nsubsequently Diamond, 1965) showed that if relatively weak normative\nrequirements are imposed on the concept of intergenerational well-being\nin a deterministic world, equal treatment of the \\(U\\)-function\nacross generations has to be abandoned. We turn to that now.\n",
