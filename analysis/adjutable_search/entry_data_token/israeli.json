Biography\n\nWe have only a few scant clues of his biography, and we cannot be sure\nof their veracity, especially in the issue of the date of his death.\nWe know that he lived the first half of his life in Egypt, before\nmoving to Karouan, Tunisia between the years of 905\u2013907. Most\nbiographers agree that he lived to the age of 100, though they\ndisagree on the years of birth and death. Sacid al-Andalusi\n(mid-11th century), in his work Kitab Tabakat\nal-Umam, indicates that he died in 932 (R. Blachere 1935, p.\n157). However, one of Israeli\u2019s pupils, Ibn al-Jazzar died in\n1009 at an approximate age of 80. If Israeli had died in 932, Ibn\nal-Jazzar would have been only five years old at his death, thus this\ndate is unlikely. Abraham Ibn Hasday, a translator of Israeli\u2019s\nworks from Arabic into Hebrew, provides the date of his passing as\n942. But Altmann and Stern (Isaac Israeli, p. xx) have\npointed out that Ibn Hasday likely made a transcription error in his\nquotation of Sacid al-Andalusi. Another student of Israeli,\nDunash Ibn Tamim, wrote a commentary on the Jewish mystical work\nSefer Yetzirah in 956, and indicated therein that Israeli was\nno longer alive, though not mentioning the year of his death.\n\nThe Arab chroniclers of physicians indicate that Isaac Israeli served\nas a doctor to Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi, the founder of the Fatimid\nDynasty of North Africa, who reigned from 910\u2013934. In his\ncapacity as physician, Israeli wrote several medical treatises which\nwere widely regarded in the Islamic world, and highly valued in\nChristian scholastic circles as well. These works include the Book\nof Fevers, the Book of Foodstuffs and Drugs, and the\nBook of Urine. Later Islamic historians relate accounts that\nthe first and third Fatimid rulers died from not following the sound\nadvice of Isaac Israeli, though the absence of these anecdotes in the\nearlier chronicles, combined with their literary trope-like character,\nrender the tales suspect. Nonetheless, these narratives do indicate\nthe great respect accorded to Isaac Israeli.\n\nAlthough the chronicler Ibn Abi Usaybi\u2019a, as well as titles of\nsome of Israeli\u2019s work in manuscripts, assign Israeli the\npatronymic term Abu Yacqub (\u201cfather of Jacob\u201d),\nthe biographers state that he never married or fathered children, and\nattribute to him the statement that his books will cause his name to\nbe remembered far better than children would. The assignment of\npatronymics to persons who did not marry and beget offspring is not\naltogether rare\u2014thus we also see the patronymic \u201cAbu\nAyub\u201d applied to the childless poet and philosopher Solomon Ibn\nGabirol. As some of Israeli\u2019s treatises have survived over a\nmillennium and remain the occasional subject of scholarly research,\nhis prediction is correct.\n2. Isaac Israeli\u2019s Philosophical Sources\n\nRegrettably, in his surviving treatises, Israeli does not discuss his\nphilosophical studies. We do know that by Isaac Israeli\u2019s\nlifetime, several Greek books of philosophy translated into Arabic as\nwell as original Arabic philosophical works were available, though\nperhaps some of these treatises, mostly produced in Baghdad and its\nenvirons, had not yet journeyed westward to North Africa. Much of\nAristotle\u2019s corpus had been translated in the previous century,\nas had Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge, often studied as an\nintroduction to Aristotle\u2019s works. Further, an Arabic partial\nparaphrase of Plotinus\u2019 Enneads circulated under the\npseudepigraphic title The Theology of Aristotle in two\nrecensions, the shorter of which is called the Vulgate Theology of\nAristotle (due to its larger number of manuscripts) while the\nother recension is called the Longer Theology of Aristotle.\nThere are both significant parallels and significant variances between\nIsraeli\u2019s writings and the Longer Theology of\nAristotle. Thus, the influences of Aristotle and Plotinus on\nIsraeli\u2019s philosophy are strong, and he likely read translations\nof their works as well as commentaries on them.\n\nS.M. Stern argues for the existence of a lost pseudepigraphic Arabic\ntreatise which influenced the longer recension of The Theology of\nAristotle and Isaac Israeli, and was quoted without proper\nattribution by both. Further, he argues that this same treatise is\nidentical to a philosophical excursus which was appended to the\nliterary tale The Tale of the Prince and the Ascetic (Hebrew:\nSefer ben ha-melech veha-nazir) when Abraham Ibn Hasday\ntranslated the text from Arabic (Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf) into\nHebrew in the thirteenth century. Although one may be tempted to\nconjecture that the Neoplatonist appendix is an original work by Ibn\nHasday which largely paraphrases Israeli\u2014a hypothesis\nstrengthened by the fact that Ibn Hasday had translated\nIsraeli\u2019s Book of the Elements\u2014Stern disproves\nthis possibility by demonstrating that Israeli\u2019s Book of\nSubstances is largely a commentary on the metaphysics of Ibn\nHasday\u2019s treatise, and Israeli\u2019s Book on Spirit and\nthe Soul is an attempt to reconcile Ibn Hasday\u2019s treatise\nwith scriptural proof texts. Hence, according to Altmann and Stern,\nIsraeli was strongly influenced by this treatise they call \u201cIbn\nHasday\u2019s Neoplatonist.\u201d Further, we know that Israeli did\nnot author this treatise, for when he quoted it, he cited \u201cthe\nphilosopher,\u201d thereby indicating that he thought he was quoting\nAristotle.\n\nMore recently, Fritz Zimmerman has argued that Stern\u2019s\nhypothesis of an otherwise unattested \u201cNeoplatonist\u201d as\nsource for Israeli is superfluous. Israeli\u2019s source may have\nbeen the Longer Theology of Aristotle, while Ibn\nHasday\u2019s source may simply have been Israeli, either\nsynthesizing the view\u2019s in Israeli\u2019s extant treatises, or\nparaphrasing a lost treatise of Israeli\u2019s. In the absence of\nfurther documentary evidence, neither Stern\u2019s nor\nZimmerman\u2019s theory can be definitively ruled out.\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s passages on intellection, interpreted by Stern\nas a misreading of al-Kindi, actually mirrors a passage in John of\nDamascus\u2019 (c. 676\u2013c. 749) De Fide Orthodoxa,\nwhich was translated into Arabic in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961:\n279\u2013280). While it is within the realm of possibility that\nIsraeli read this translation, it is also possible that both authors\nare citing a previous source which is no longer extant.\n\nA clear and strong influence of the Arab philosopher al-Kindi (d. 873)\nis evident in the work of Isaac Israeli. Like the former, he wrote a\nbook of definitions, many of which are strongly similar to definitions\nin al-Kindi\u2019s Fi Hudud al-ashya\u2019 wa-rusumiha.\nScholars Altmann and Stern illustrate the extensive similarities\nbetween the two books in their commentary on Israeli\u2019s Book\nof Definitions in their study Isaac Israeli: A Neoplatonic\nPhilosopher of the Early Tenth Century. Further, Israeli uses\nmuch of al-Kindi\u2019s terminology for both astronomical and\nterrestrial objects. Nonetheless, it would be wrong to call the book a\nparaphrase of al-Kindi, as there are numerous divergences as well.\n\nThough we see overlap with The Theology of Aristotle and\nal-Kindi, we do not have any evidence that Israeli read the works of\nhis younger contemporary al-Farabi (ca. 870\u2013ca. 950), nor do we\nsee the influence of his younger coreligionist philosopher Saadya Gaon\n(882\u2013942 C.E.).\n3. Metaphysics\n3.1 The Four Kinds of Inquiry\n\nThe four kinds of inquiry, introduced by Aristotle in his\nPosterior Analytics, and subsequently modified by\nNeoplatonist commentators, were such a universal and fundamental\ncomponent of the cultural episteme, that elaboration of the\nfour inquiries often formed part of the introduction to philosophical\nand medical treatises. Aristotle lists the four questions thusly:\n\n\u201c(1) whether the connexion of an attribute with a thing is a\nfact, (2) what is the reason of the connexion, (3) whether a thing\nexists, (4) what is the nature of the thing.\u201d (Posterior\nAnalytics ii.1, G.R.G. Mure translation)\n\nFollowing the practice of thinkers of his age, at the very beginning\nof his Book of Definitions and also at the beginning of his\nBook on Fevers, Isaac Israeli introduces the Aristotelian\ndistinction of the four kinds of inquiry, in a slightly modified\nform:\n\n\u201c(1) The first is existence: when one inquires whether so-and-so\nexists; (2) the second is quiddity: when one inquires what so-and-so\nis; (3) the third is quality: when one inquires how so-and-so is; (4)\nthe fourth is \u2018quarity\u2019: when one inquires why so-and-so\nis.\u201d (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\n10\u201311)\n\nIsraeli\u2019s description mirrors the list of al-Jahiz (d. ca. 869)\nin the Book of Indications and Considerations (Arabic:\nKitab al-Dala\u2019il wa\u2019l-cItibar) as well\nas cAli ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari (fl. 9th\ncentury), in his medical text Firdaws al-Hikmah fi al-Tibb.\nHis list varies slightly from that of al-Kindi, who in his treatise on\nmetaphysics Al-Falsafah al-cula defines the third\ninquiry as which, rather than how.\n3.2 The Four Causes\n\nJust as medieval thinkers adopted Aristotle\u2019s four inquiries, so\ntoo did they adopt his distinction of four types of causes (material,\nformal, efficient, and final) elaborated in Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics v.2 and other places. Although Israeli adopts the\nschema, he notes that within each of the four categories a cause can\nbe either spiritual or corporeal. While a \u201cspiritual material\ncause\u201d might sound oxymoronic to our ears, in his Book of\nDefinitions Israeli provides an example:\n\nA case of a spiritual material cause is that of the genera which are\ndivided into their species and are the substratum for their forms\nwhich complete their speciality, as for instance \u2018living\nbeing\u2019, which is the genus of man and horse and other species,\nand is the substratum for their forms which constitute their essence.\n(Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 24)\n\n\nJust as spiritual material causes are the material substratum for\ngenera, spiritual formal causes are substantial forms of genera. These\ngenera \u201ccause\u201d those objects which partake of them to be\nas they are. Israeli\u2019s example of a spiritual efficient cause is\nparadoxical:\n\nA case of the spiritual efficient cause is the power of the sphere\nwhich was appointed by the Creator, may He be exalted, in nature, and\nordained in it over the effects which take place in the corporeal\nmicrocosm\u2026 (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 25)\n\n\nThe prevalent medieval conception of the sphere of the cosmos is that\nit is not a vacuum, but rather, crystalline and composed of a fifth\nelement superior to the four elements of our terrestrial world. Hence,\nit would appear that the efficient spiritual cause could also be an\nefficient material cause. However, this difficulty is resolved if what\nIsraeli meant here was an intelligence or soul governing the sphere.\nAlthough Israeli does not in any of his surviving writings and\nfragments mention a soul of the spheres, his pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim\naffirms it in his commentary on Sefer Yetzirah.\n3.3 The Four Elements\n\nIsraeli adopts the Aristotelian doctrine of the four elements which\ncompose all material objects: earth, air, fire and water. These\nelements are generated by the motion of the heavenly sphere, and they\ninhere in a material substratum\u2014though Israeli does not\nelucidate its nature. Although Israeli does not explicitly state that\nthe elements are made up of form and matter, Altmann and Stern\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 183) present a strong case for his\nacceptance of this idea. In his Mantua Text, also known as\nthe Chapter on the Elements, he describes the generative\norder of the elements. The motion of the sphere of the world generated\nheat, and thus is fire brought into existence. As fire cooled, it\nbecame air, which, moving away from fire, cooled and moistened into\nwater, and as water moved from air it cooled and dried and generated\nearth (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\n120\u2013121).\n3.4 Substance, Form and Matter\n\nSimilar to most other Neoplatonists, Israeli accepted the Aristotelian\ndefinition of a substance as a something of which something is said or\npredicated\u2014and not something which is said of something else.\nWithin a substance, matter is the substratum for the form which\ndetermines its being as substance. Further matter can be either\nparticular or general and universal, and if particular \u201cit is\nthe substratum for a special form which constitutes the essence of a\nparticular species\u2026\u201d (Isaac Israeli, p. 86)\n3.5 Theology\n\nAlthough explication of the nature of God is absent in the surviving\nfragments of Israeli\u2019s philosophical corpus, it is apparent that\nIsraeli, like the Muslim philosopher al-Kindi before him, combined the\nNeoplatonist notion of God as the source of emanation of all things,\nwith the idea common to the monotheistic religions, of a willful\nCreator who created the world in time. In blending these two\nconceptions, these philosophers rejected the Aristotelian conception\nof the eternity of the world, as well as the idea of eternal emanation\nof some of the Greek Neoplatonists. Israeli\u2019s use of the Arabic\nterm, al-Bari, \u201cthe Creator\u201d reflects the\nreligious sensitivities of his age\u2014and is not simply a\ntranslation of Plotinus\u2019 \u201cThe One\u201d.\n\nIn Plotinus\u2019 Enneads, the founding text of Neoplatonist\nphilosophy, The One contains a will which is not separate\nfrom itself (Enneads, vi 8.21), and precedes the emanation of\nNous (The Intellect/Intelligence) a secondary entity from\nwhich all lower beings emanate. In Arabic paraphrases of Plotinus, the\nWill or Word of God is a secondary hypostasis which\ncreates Intellect (cAql). This model is also seen\nin later Jewish Neoplatonist philosophers Solomon Ibn Gabirol and\nJudah Halevi. However, Isaac Israeli, like Plotinus, does not treat\nthe will of God as a separate hypostasis or secondary being.\n\nOne prominent feature in most variants of Neoplatonist thought is\nNegative Theology, the idea that one cannot predicate anything of God.\nThe problems which this approach intended to avoid were two undesired\nimplications arising from predication of a quality of\nGod\u2014namely, that if we attribute a particular quality to God,\nthis quality exists co-extensively with God, and must hence be\nco-eternal; secondly, it introduces multiplicity to God. The\nNeoplatonists, in the main, wished to conceive of God as a simple and\nradical unity, preceding all multiplicity in the world, and as such,\nmust precede the existence of qualities. Hence the only two allowable\npredications of God are God\u2019s Unity and God\u2019s Existence.\nIn none of the surviving materials do we find Israeli expressing\nNegative Theology explicitly. Israeli\u2019s pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim\npromotes negative theology in his commentary on the mystical work\nSefer Yetzirah, which lead scholars Altmann and Stern\n(Isaac Israeli, pp. 157\u20138) to conclude that we can\nsafely assume that Israeli held this opinion as well.\n3.6 The Sequence of Emanation\n\nWhereas for Plotinus, the second being in the emanative chain is\nNous (Intellect), Israeli concurs with the model in\n\u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s Neoplatonist\u201d, that First Matter and\nFirst Form are the first and only \u201ccreations\u201d of the\nCreator\u2014that is, produced by an act of Will\u2014and precede\nthe Intellect. First Matter and First Form conjoin to form the First\nIntellect. After God creates First Matter and First Form, God\u2019s\nactive role in creation ceases and all subsequent beings emanate in a\nchain of hypostases from Intellect, downward to the three kinds of\nsoul, and culminating in the material and corporeal Sphere/Nature.\nFurther, Israeli adds a second Intellect which is a distinct\nhypostasis from First Intellect. First Intellect contains the totality\nof forms and knows itself intuitively with perfect unchanging\nknowledge. Second Intellect exists within the domain of Soul, and\nknows the actualization of particular things via temporal\nknowledge.\n\nSoul is the next realm in the emanative sequence, and Israeli here\nreplicates Aristotle\u2019s threefold division. This universal soul\nis made up of the higher Rational Soul, the Animal Soul and the\nVegetative/Nutritive Soul and from these emanates the superlunary\nsphere of heaven\u2014the point where the material world emerges from\nSoul. Whereas most other Neoplatonists use the term\n\u201cNature\u201d for the corporeal world, Israeli uses the term\n\u201cthe sphere.\u201d The motions of the superlunary sphere of\nheaven, made up of a fifth unchanging element, govern the combinations\nand recombinations of the four elements in the material world below\nthe moon\u2014hence they govern the processes of generation and\ncorruption. Israeli\u2019s student Dunash Ibn Tamim calls this fourth\nsoul the soul of the sphere.\n3.7 Metaphors of Light and Shadow\n\nIn Neoplatonist philosophy the metaphor of light emitted from its\nsource illustrates the process of emanation. The light spreads out\nfrom its source, but does not diminish its source. Similarly, the\ngeneration of emanated entities and hypostases in no way diminishes\nthe source of each emanation. Israeli accounts for the increasing\ncorporeality and particularity and imperfection of each emanated\nhypostasis by adding the idea of shadow or shade to emanation. Each\nemanated hypostasis has a lighter region closer to the source of its\nemanation, but it also contains regions of shade or shadow in areas\nfurther from their source. It is in these shaded regions that the\nemanation of the next sequential entity begins. Further, each emanated\nhypostasis receives light from its source but also shadow, which grows\ndenser as the ontological distance from the source of emanation\nincreases.\n3.8 On Generation and Passing Away\n\nAs is standard within the intellectual milieu dominated by\nAristotelian physics, Israeli opined that the generation and passing\naway of terrestrial objects was the result of recombination of\nelements and their attendant properties (heat, coldness, wetness and\ndryness), a process which is governed by the movement of the cosmic\nsphere. Later thinkers would, via astrology, attribute certain roles\nin this process to the \u201cintelligences\u201d governing\nindividual celestial objects and their relative positions. The\nheavens, which are not composed of the four elements and hence not\naffected by their contrary qualities, are not subject to generation\nand degeneration. (Isaac Israeli [Book of\nDefinitions], p. 48)\n4. Psychology\n4.1 Intellect and Intellection\n\nIn a few instances in his Book of Definitions, Israeli\ndiverges from models given by his forerunner al-Kindi. Although\nIsraeli posits a first intellect and a second\nintellect, Israeli describes three hypostases of intellect.\nFirst intellect, the entity which emerges from the\nconjunction of first matter and first form, contains all subsequent\nforms, which emanate from the first intellect and determine\nthe specificality of all substances and knows all things eternally.\nThe secondary hypostasis of intellect is actually in the rational\nsoul, and is potential intellect before it passes into the actual\nintellect of the first intellect. The \u201csecond intellect\u201d\n(actually the third hypostasis of intellect) is a faculty of the\nrational soul, which via sense perception and imagination (the\n\u201cinternal senses\u201d) conveys information to the higher\nhypostasis in the rational soul. The second intellect of the rational\nsoul unites with the objects of its intellection in a spiritual,\nnon-corporeal sense and similarly, upon conveyance of the intellection\nto the higher intellect of the rational soul, the higher hypostasis of\nintellect within the rational soul also spiritually unites with the\nobjects of its intellection. (Altmann and Stern, Isaac\nIsraeli, pp. 36\u20137) Since Israeli here diverges from\nal-Kindi, Stern accuses Israeli of a clumsy misreading of the latter.\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 39) However, since Israeli\u2019s\ndescription of internal senses largely mirrors the description in John\nof Damascus\u2019 De Fide Orthodoxa, (Book II, Chapter 20)\nit is likely that Israeli derived his overall schema of intellection\nfrom another source. While Stern rejected the connection between the\ntext of John of Damascus and Israeli (Isaac Israeli, p. 59), Harry\nWolfson rejoined that De Fida Orthodoxa was available in\nArabic translation in the tenth century (Wolfson, 1961, p. 279).\nFurther, it is possible that Israeli was drew his conception from\nanother lost source common to himself and John of Damascus, or from a\nlost Arabic commentator on the latter.\n4.2 Soul, Spirit and Body\n\nIsaac Israeli did not believe in the ensoulment of souls in bodies.\nThe three souls, despite their role in the governance of the body, and\nthe role of bodily sense perception in conveying information to the\nrational soul, remained outside the body. In his Book on Spirit\nand Soul, Israeli utilizes scriptural proof texts to argue that\nthe rational soul is what entitles mankind to reward or punishment\nafter death. But he writes tersely and vaguely on the subject of\nreward and punishment and does not explicitly clarify the relationship\nbetween the generic rational soul and rational souls of individuals.\nPresumably, we all have separate rational souls, otherwise the idea of\nreward and punishment of rational souls makes no sense. He notes that\nthe perfect actions of man pass beyond the corporeal sphere while\nthose actions to satisfy bodily appetites do not. Further, he affirms\nthat the soul of the righteous will endure in the upper realm with the\nintellect. Although he has sidestepped the traditional Rabbinic Jewish\nconception of bodily resurrection of the righteous by stating that the\nworld to come is the upper non-physical world, he does not spell out\nwhether this dwelling entails reintegration of one\u2019s rational\nsoul with the intellect, or a separate yet proximate existence.\n\nIsraeli, like the physician Qusta Ibn Luqa (ca. 835\u2013912), argued\nthat in addition to its connection with souls, a living being has a\nvital spirit, which unlike souls, is contained within the body and\ndies with the body, and he employs scripture (Psalms 78: 39) to argue\nthis point. Altmann and Stern show that Israeli\u2019s text very\nclosely parallels Ibn Luqa\u2019s, hence either derived it directly\nfrom the former, or they both are quoting the same prior source.\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 50)\n4.3 The Perfection of the Rational Soul\n\nIn addition to an emanative/generative order, a prominent feature of\nNeoplatonist philosophy is the idea that through withdrawal from\nbodily desires, and perfection of the intellect, one\u2019s rational\nsoul can attain unity with the higher world. The early\nNeoplatonists\u2014those outside of the \u201crevealed\u201d\nmonotheistic traditions of Islam, Judaism and\nChristianity\u2014suggest that it is possible for the rational soul\nto achieve unity with The One/God. However, the Neoplatonists who were\nmembers of established monotheist religions do not think that\none\u2019s rational soul is capable of so high an ascent up the\nemanative chain, and advocation of such belief might have lead to\nprosecution for blasphemy or heresy. Nonetheless, Neoplatonists of\nreligious traditions did think that the rational soul\u2019s union\nwith the realm of intellect was possible. Neoplatonists from Proclus\nonwards describe unification as a three-part process, which Altmann\nand Stern characterize as Purification\u2014Illumination\u2014Union.\nFor Israeli, the Purification stage involves three activities: an\nascetic rejection of bodily desires and pleasures, and the dominance\nof the two lower souls; a worship of God combined with ethical\nbehavior towards one\u2019s fellow men; and the study of philosophy\nto develop one\u2019s rational soul. In the second stage, the soul is\nilluminated by truth. In the third stage, one\u2019s rational soul\nbecomes spiritual and divine, though not achieving full unity with the\nCreator.\n4.4 Free Will and Negation of Akrasia\n\nAccording to Israeli, a human being can act in a number of ways when\nfaced with a specific situation. The reason for this ability is the\ncapacity of discernment, and more specifically of cogitation and\nconsideration. Due to these capacities people are able to acquire\ntheoretical and practical knowledge and to differentiate between good\nand evil. Because animals do not possess intellectual capacities, they\nare limited to acting in a definite way in particular situations.\nHowever, the ability of humans to act in different ways is a\nconsequence of humans\u2019 position between pure intellect and\nbeast. People use their cogitation and consideration to attain a\nhigher level of knowledge. However, as long as humans use those\ncapacities their knowledge will remain imperfect and they will\ncontinue to hesitate and be uncertain. When they are united with\nintellect they no longer are uncertain and act in the best possible\nway in all situations without any tension in their soul. According to\nIsraeli, the certainty of truth cancels all kinds of bad\ntemptations.\n\nOne may interpret Israeli here as saying that if a man has an\nimperfect knowledge that it is bad to eat unhealthy candies, his\nknowledge and his temptation for these candies are in struggle in his\nsoul. His capacities of consideration and cogitation\n(\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05db\u05e8) have to decide between this\nimperfect knowledge and the temptation. Once this person attains\nperfect knowledge, he or she no longer wishes to eat the candies. S.\nSadik argues that Israeli\u2019s remarks constitute a Socratic\nnegation of akrasia (Sadik 2013).\n5. Philosophical Works, Manuscripts and Translations\n\nAll of the following works, except the Book on the Elements,\nhave been translated by Alexander Altmann and S. M. Stern in their\nmonograph Isaac Israeli: A Neoplatonic Philosopher of the Early\nTenth Century. In the 1950s and 1960s these two scholars have\nalso published transcriptions of the fragments and manuscripts of\nthese works in a number of journals. In addition to publishing and\ntranslating known works of Isaac Israeli, Altmann and Stern firmly\nestablished the hypothesis suggested by Gershom Scholem that Isaac\nIsraeli authored a work previously erroneously attributed to\nAristotle: The Chapter on the Elements (Mantua Text).\nFurther, in their extensive analyses of Israeli\u2019s texts (in\nwhich they often compare Israeli\u2019s text to parallel passages in\nal-Kindi and other authors), they established the surprising antiquity\nof the Neoplatonic treatise which Abraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240)\nappended to his Hebrew translation of The Prince and the\nAscetic. This work, which they dubbed \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist\u201d actually predated and influenced both Isaac\nIsraeli and the Longer Recension of the Theology of\nAristotle, and Stern\u2019s article on \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist\u201d is an important component of any thorough study of\nthe philosophy of Isaac Israeli.\n5.1 The Book of Definitions\n\nOriginally written in Arabic, this work is extant in two Latin (Liber\nde Definicionibus/Definitionibus) and two Hebrew translations\n(Sefer ha-Gvulim), but only a fragment of the original Arabic\n(Kitab al-Hudud) survived. That this book was widely read by\nChristian scholastics is evidenced by Thomas Aquinas\u2019 and\nAlbertus Magnus\u2019 misattribution of Avicenna\u2019s definition\nof truth to Isaac\u2019s Book of Definitions (see Altmann\n& Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 59). This book is a collection\nof 57 definitions, the bulk of which are paraphrases and quotes (often\nwithout attribution) of various passages of al-Kindi. In some\ninstances, he cites \u201cthe philosopher\u201d who would be\nunderstood to mean Aristotle, but he is actually paraphrasing\nal-Kindi, who oftentimes purports to elucidate what Aristotle had\nwritten on a particular subject. Occasionally, his definitions derive\nfrom other possible sources such as Qusta ibn Luqa (a physician,\nmathematician, scientist and translator, lived 835\u2013912 C.E.),\nAmmonius Hermiae of Alexandria (Fifth Century C.E.) and John\nPhiloponus (490\u2013ca. 570 C.E.). A few ideas expressed in this\nwork are not attested in any other known sources. Yet, because of the\nbook\u2019s close adherence to al-Kindi, Stern hypothesizes that\nthese deviations are often either quotation of definitions of al-Kindi\nwhich have been lost, or are misreadings of al-Kindi. One of the\ncolophons at the end noted that the work is a\n\u201ccollection,\u201d perhaps indicating that the material was not\noriginal, nor intended to be read as such. In another manuscript the\ncolophon asserts that Isaac Israeli had written it, yet this same\ncolophon contains spurious information\u2014that Israeli was from\nSpain and that he had fathered children whom he hoped would study it\n(Altmann & Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 78), hence its claim\nthat the treatise is an entirely original work of Israeli\u2019s must\nnot be regarded as authoritative.\n\nBoth Latin versions were published by J.T. Muckle, \u201cIssac\nIsraeli, Liber de Definicionibus\u201d in Archives\nd\u2019histoire doctrinale et litteraire du moyen age,\n1937\u20138. The longer version was translated by Gerard of Cremona\n(1114\u20131187), and appears in manuscripts (Paris B.N. 14,700;\nParis B.N. 6443; Vatican Lat. 2186) as well as a printed edition\nOmnia opera Ysaac, from Lyons in 1515. M. Alonso speculated\nthat the shorter version (MS Munich Lat. 8001) is a translation by\nDomingo Gundissalinus and predated the longer version (Alonso, 1947,\npp. 295, 325) (See \u201cTraducciones del arcediano Domingo\nGundisalvo\u201d in Al-Andalus, 1947, pp. 295, 325). Altmann\nand Stern challenge this hypothesis, arguing that the shorter version\nis an epitome of the longer version, improving the translation at\npoints (Isaac Israeli, p. 5).\n\nNissim ben Solomon translated one of the Hebrew versions, and it can\nbe found in its entirety in H. Hirschfeld, Festschrift zum 80.\nGeburtstag M. Steinschneiders, pp. 131\u201342. J.L. Teicher was\nof the opinion that the Hebrew version was translated from the Latin\nversion (See \u201cThe Latin-Hebrew school of translators in Spain in\nthe twelfth century,\u201d in Homanaje a Millas-Vallicrosa,\nv.ii, pp. 416\u201322). Julius Guttman and Stern think that his\nprimary source was the Arabic version (Stern and Altmann, Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 6). The second Hebrew translation, whose translator\nis unknown, was published by Altmann in Journal of Semitic\nStudies, 1957, pp. 232\u201342.\n\nThe surviving Arabic fragment is written in Hebrew characters, but\nthere are indications that the original text was written in Arabic\nscript. The Arabic fragment can be found in the Cambridge\nTaylor-Schechter collection, document TS. 8 Ka.62 and has\nbeen published twice\u2014by H. Hirschfeld in \u201cThe Arabic\nportion of the Cairo Genizah at Cambridge,\u201d Jewish Quarterly\nReview xv (1902), pp. 689\u201393 and by Altmann in Journal of\nSemitic Studies, 1957, pp. 232\u201342. This work is accessible\nin English translation with commentary in Altmann and Stern\u2019s\nIsaac Israeli, 9\u201378.\n5.2 The Book of Substances\n\nThe Book of Substances (Arabic: Kitab al-Jawahir) is\nextant only in fragments of Judeo-Arabic (that is, Arabic written in\nHebrew letters) in the Firkovitch Collection in St. Petersburg and in\nthe British Museum. Stern established that both manuscripts were\nseparately transliterated from an original text in Arabic\ncharacters\u2014which is deducible from transcription errors arising\nfrom Arabic rather than Hebrew orthographic similarities, and that the\ntranscription and transliteration errors in the two manuscripts do not\nmatch (Stern, \u201cThe Fragments of \u2018The Book of\nSubstances\u2019\u201d, pp.16\u201317). Stern pieced together the\nfragments, adding some missing materials from a passage in \u201cIbn\nHasday\u2019s Neoplatonist\u201d and published them in the\nJournal of Jewish Studies, vii (1956), 13\u201329. The\nextant fragments largely paraphrase and add commentary to passages\nfrom the pseudo-Aristotelian \u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s\nNeoplatonist.\u201d Due to the close textual proximities between the\ntwo texts, Stern conjectured that in places where Israeli is quoting\n\u201cthe philosopher\u201d he is likely quoting a lost passage of\nthe Neoplatonist. These parallels allowed Stern to arrange the\ndiscontinuous fragments into an order mirroring its source treatise.\nAltmann and Stern subsequently published a translation of the\nfragments in Isaac Israeli, pp. 81\u2013105.\n5.3 The Book on Spirit and Soul\n\nJ.L. Teicher argues that Isaac Israeli is not the author of this work\n(Teicher, 1956 p. 424). However, since Israeli\u2019s pupil Dunash\nIbn Tamim quotes passages of it in his commentary on the mystical work\nSefer Yetzirah, Teicher\u2019s view is likely erroneous.\n\nTwo Hebrew translations (Sefer ha-Ruah v\u2019ha-Nefesh) and\na fragment of the Arabic original remain of this work. Altmann and\nStern provide a critical English translation based on the Hebrew\nmanuscripts (Munich Steinschneider\u2019s Cat. no. 307, fols. 47ff;\nCambridge Addler 1858 fols. 113v ff.) and A. Borisov\u2019s\npublication of the Arabic fragment in Isaac Israeli, pp.\n108\u2013117.\n\nThis treatise, unlike the Book of Definitions and Book of\nSubstances is a distinctly Jewish work of philosophy, as it\ncombines doctrines of soul drawn from Ibn Hasday\u2019s Neoplatonist\nwith Jewish scriptural proof texts, supporting a Neoplatonist\nconception of soul as distinct from mortal spirit, combined with the\nRabbinic Jewish belief in reward and punishment of souls.\n5.4 The Chapter on the Elements\n\nA single Hebrew translation (Shacar ha-Yesodot\nle-Aristo) is extant in manuscript Mantua 28c, folios\n16r\u201318r. This unsigned work was initially regarded as an\nanonymous commentary on Aristotle. Altmann, developing a hypothesis\nfirst proposed by Gershom Scholem, argues that this text is the work\nof Isaac Israeli. Also called the Mantua Text, it is\navailable in English translation by Altmann in two\npublications\u2014Journal of Jewish Studies, vii (1956) pp.\n31\u201357 and in Altmann and Stern\u2019s Isaac Israeli,\npp. 119\u201332.\n5.5 Book of the Elements\n\nLike most of his other philosophical works, Israeli\u2019s Arabic\noriginal (Kitab al-Ustuqussat) is lost, and we are left with\na Latin translation and two Hebrew versions. Gerard of Cremona\u2019s\nLatin translation of this book was published in the work Omnia\nopera Ysaac, Lyons: 1515. One Hebrew version (Leiden, Warner MS\nNo. 13) was rendered by Abraham ibn Hasday for David Qimhi. The other\ntranslation (Munich MS No. 43) is more eloquent, and likely an\nimprovement on the earlier translation, leading Salomon Fried to\nconjecture that the famous Medieval translator Moses ibn Tibbon\n(flourished mid-13th century, Provence) prepared it (Fried,\n1884, pp. 75\u201383).\n6. Israeli\u2019s Influence on Later Thinkers\n\nIn 956, Dunash Ibn Tamim, a pupil of Isaac Israeli, wrote an extensive\ncommentary on the short recension of Sefer Yetzirah, a\nmystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the\nletters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining\nthe structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so\nextensively that in the nineteenth century, a few scholars\nmisidentified the commentary as Israeli\u2019s.\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s medical treatises were studied for several\ncenturies both in the original Arabic and in Latin translation. In the\neleventh century, Constantine Africanus, a professor at the\nprestigious Salerno school of medicine, translated some of\nIsraeli\u2019s works into Latin. Many medieval Arabic biographical\nchronicles of physicians list him and his works.\n\nIsraeli\u2019s philosophical works exercised a considerable influence\non Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of influence\namong Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, following a major\nphase of the Christian reconquest of Spain, a group of scholars in\nToledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into\nLatin. One of the translators who migrated to this cultural center,\nGerard of Cremona, rendered Israeli\u2019s Book of\nDefinitions and Book on the Elements into Latin.\nIsraeli\u2019s work was quoted and paraphrased by a number of\nChristian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus, Thomas\nAquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and Nicholas of\nCusa (See Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, pp.\nxiii\u2013xiv; Julius Guttmann, Die Scholastik des 13.\nJahrhunderts in irhen Beziehungen zum Judentum und zur judische\nLiteratur, pp. 55\u201360, 129\u201330,150 and 172; as well as\nGuttmann, Das Verhaltniss des Thomas von Aquino zum Judentum und\nzur judischen Literatur, pp. 55\u201360).\n\nIsaac Israeli corresponded with Saadya ben Joseph al-Fayyumi\n(882\u2013942) prior to the latter\u2019s departure from Egypt.\nSaadya later became the head (Gaon) of the Talmudic Academy of Sura\nand one of the most influential figures in the medieval Judaism.\nSaadya Gaon was known for his Jewish legal rulings, his arrangement of\nthe Jewish prayer book (Siddur), his translation of the Hebrew Bible\ninto Arabic, his liturgical poetry and his philosophical work The\nBook of Beliefs and Opinions (Arabic: Kitab al-\u2018Amanat\nwal-\u2018Itikadat, Hebrew: Sefer emunot\nve-decot). Altmann and Stern suggest that it is\npossible that Saadya Gaon\u2019s concept of rational commandments was\ninfluenced by Israeli\u2019s concept of \u201cintellectual\nprecepts\u201d from his Book of Definitions. (Isaac\nIsraeli, p. 217) However, it is also possible that Saadya\nGaon\u2019s conception may have been a product of the vibrant and\nsomewhat ecumenical intellectual culture of Baghdad, in which a group\nof theologians known as the Muta\u2018zilites reconciled logic and\nscience with Islamic theology, arguing for the rationality of God and\nHis actions.\n\nThe great Jewish poet and Neoplatonist Solomon Ibn Gabirol (known in\nLatin as Avicebron and Avicebrol) likely read Isaac Israeli\u2019s\nworks as well as the widely-circulated encyclopedic Epistles of\nthe Brethren of Purity (Arabic: Rasa\u2019il Ikhwan\nas-Safa\u2019). Solomon Ibn Gabirol was at times close to the\nlatter in his models of emanation. He was also highly\ninnovative\u2014hence the influence of Isaac Israeli is difficult to\ngauge. Nonetheless, Israeli\u2019s Book on Spirit and Soul\nwas likely the only philosophical text which combined Neoplatonist\ncosmology and psychology with Biblical proof texts\u2014a task which\nIbn Gabirol accomplished so masterfully in his liturgical poem\nKeter Malkhut. It is probable that Ibn Gabirol\u2019s idea\nof spiritual matter was influenced by Israeli.\n\nAnother of the Golden Age Hebrew poets of Spain, Moses Ibn Ezra (c.\n1060\u20131139) quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his\ntreatise The Book of the Garden, explaining the meaning of\nMetaphor and Literal Expression (Originally in Judeo-Arabic:\nKitab al-Hadiqa fi Macna \u2018l-Majaz\nwa\u2019l-Haqiqa). Stern explores this matter in his article\n\u201cIsaac Israeli and Moses ibn Ezra.\u201d The poet and\nphilosopher Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq of Cordoba (d. 1149) authored a work\nThe Microcosm (the Judeo-Arabic original is lost, but the\nwork survived in Hebrew translation as Ha-colam\nha-Qatan) containing many ideas indebted to Israeli. Parallels\nbetween the two thinkers are illuminated in Altmann and Stern\u2019s\nIsaac Israeli (pp. 30, 44, 73\u201374, 117).\n\nIsaac Israeli\u2019s philosophical influence on Muslim authors is\nslight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli\u2019s philosophy\nin a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic,\nproduced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely\ncirculated in the West under the title Picatrix. Although\nthere are passages which correspond directly to Israeli\u2019s\nwritings, the author does not cite him by name.\n\nAs Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical\ntradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of\nIsaac Israeli diminished as well.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Altmann, Alexander, 1957. \u201cIsaac Israeli\u2019s Book of\nDefinitions: Some Fragments of a Second Hebrew Translation,\u201d\n<em>Journal of Semitic Studies</em>, 2(3): 232\u2013242.", "Altmann, Alexander, 1956. \u201cIsaac Israeli\u2019s\n\u2018Chapter on the Elements\u2019 (MS Mantua),\u201d <em>Journal\nof Jewish Studies</em>, 7 (1\u20132): 31\u201357.", "Altmann, Alexander and S.M.
