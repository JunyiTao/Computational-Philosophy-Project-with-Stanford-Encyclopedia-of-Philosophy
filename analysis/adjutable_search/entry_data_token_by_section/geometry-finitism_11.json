There is a rather devastating\nargument that shows the impossibility of a genuine distance function\nfor a discrete geometry. It dates back to 1949 and was first\nformulated by Hermann Weyl:\n\n\nIf a square is built up of miniature tiles, then there are as many\ntiles along the diagonal as there are along the sides; thus the\ndiagonal should be equal in length to the side. (Weyl 1949: 43)\n\n\nAt least three solutions to this problem have been formulated.\n\nVan Bendegem (1987) argued that in a finite geometry it should be a\nbasic fact that lines and points have extensions. In particular, lines\nare supposed to have a constant width (independent of the orientation\nof the line) \\(N_{D}\\) Thus \\(N_{D}\\) represents a large (finite)\nnumber, corresponding to the number of squares that form \\(N_{D}\\).\nGiven a line, the width is always defined as perpendicular to that\nline. Now suppose that the line has an orientation corresponding to an\nangle \\(\\alpha\\) between the line and the \\(x\\)-axis. Then the width\n\\(N_{D}\\) of that line, when projected on the \\(x\\)-axis will be\n\\(\\left[\\frac{N_{D}}{\\sin \\alpha}\\right]\\) where the expression\n\\([x]\\) indicates the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) between two points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is then defined\nas the number of squares in the rectangle formed by the line from\n\\(p\\) to \\(q\\) and the width \\(N_{D}\\), divided by \\(N_{D}\\). The idea\nis that, although in a discrete geometry lines must necessarily have a\nwidth, this is not an essential feature, so it can be divided out.\nHence: \n\\[d(p,q) = N_{L} \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{N_{D}}{\\sin \\alpha}\\right] (\\mathrm{div}\\, N_{D}).\\]\n\n\n\\(N_{L}\\) here corresponds to the number of layers parallel to the\n\\(x\\)-axis between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and \\(n (\\mathrm{div}\\, m)\\) is the\nquotient of the division of \\(n\\) by \\(m.\\)\n\nAs an illustration, consider the Weyl problem.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nWe have a right-angled triangle pqr such that for simplicity\nthe right sides \\(pq\\) and \\(qr\\) are equal to one another and are\naligned with the axes of the grid. Suppose that the number of squares\nin the right sides is \\(N_{L}\\). Then \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nd(p,q) &= d(q,r) \\\\\n&= N_{L} \\cdot [ N_{D}] (\\mbox{div}\\, N_{D}) \\\\\n&= N_{L},\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nsince, of course, \\([N_{D}]\\) = \\(N_{D}\\). However, the hypotenuse has\nan angle of \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Thus, \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nd(p,r) & = N_{L} \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{N_{D}}{\\sin \\alpha}\\right] (\\mbox{div}\\, N_{D})\\\\\n       & = N_{L}\\cdot [\\sqrt{2} \\cdot N_{D}] (\\mbox{div}\\, N_{D})\\\\\n       & = N_{L}\\cdot   [\\sqrt{2}]_{n},\n\\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n\nwhere \\([r]_{n}\\) means the number \\(r\\) up to \\(n\\) decimals. No\ncalculations are needed to show that (a close approximation of) the\nPythagorean theorem holds, i.e., \\(d^{2}(p,q) + d^{2}(q,r) =\nd^{2}(p,r)\\). Finally, there is an easy explanation why the Weyl\nproblem occurs: it corresponds to the limiting case \\(N_{D} = 1\\).\nWhen \\(N_{D} = 1\\), then \\([\\sqrt{2} \\cdot N_{D}] = [\\sqrt{2}] = 1\\),\nhence \\(d(p,r) = N_{L} \\cdot 1 = N_{L}\\) and Pythagoras\u2019 theorem\nfails.\n\nAlthough the introduction of a width \\(N_{D}\\) apparently solves the\nproblem, it is equally clear what the drawbacks are. Without classical\nEuclidean geometry in the background, there is really no way to get\nthe construction going. There is no definition of a line in terms of\nthe discrete geometry itself, and, above all, the projected width on\nthe \\(x\\)-axis of a line \\(L\\) is calculated according to a Euclidean\ndistance function that is not explicitly mentioned. In short, there is\na mixture of two distance functions.\n\nPeter Forrest (1995) presents another solution. He starts by\nintroducing a family of discrete spaces \\(E_{n,m}\\), where \\(n\\)\ncorresponds to the \u201cclassical\u201d dimension of space and\n\\(m\\) is a scale factor, to be understood as follows: \\(m\\) is a\nparameter to decide when two points are or are not adjacent, which is\nthe basic (and sole) concept of his geometry. Thus in the case \\(n =\n2\\), points are labeled by couples of integers \\((i,j)\\) and two\npoints \\((i, j)\\) and \\((i', j')\\) are adjacent if they are distinct,\nand \\((i-i')^{2} + (j-j') ^{2} \\le m^{2}\\).\n\nOnce adjacency has been stipulated, a distance function can be easily\nderived: the distance between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), \\(d(p,q)\\), is the\nsmallest number of \u201clinks\u201d in a chain of points connecting\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) such that each one is adjacent to the previous one.\nNext there is no problem to show that a straight line passing through\ntwo points is that chain of points that has the shortest distance.\n\nIf the parameter \\(m\\) has a small value, then the resulting distance\nfunction is not Euclidean. More specifically, if \\(m = 1\\), then we\nhave, once again, the situation presented by Weyl. But if, say, \\(m =\n10^{30}\\) (the figure proposed by Forrest himself), then the situation\nchanges. Then it is possible to show that the distance function on the\ndiscrete space will approximate the Euclidean distance function as\nclose as one wants. Without presenting all the details, one can show\nthat a Euclidean distance function \\(d_{E}\\) and the discrete distance\nfunction \\(d\\) are related by a scale factor, i.e., \\(d_{E}\n\\frac{(p,q)}{d(p, q)} = \\mbox{constant} (m)\\), where the constant is\ndetermined by the value of \\(m\\). No calculations are needed once\nagain, to show that the original distance function \\(d\\) satisfies the\nPythagorean theorem.\n\nIf one is looking for a weak point in this approach, then inevitably\none must end up with the basic notion of adjacency. What is the reason\nfor defining adjacency in Euclidean terms? For, after all, a condition\nsuch as \\((i-i')^{2} + (j-j')^{2} \\le m^{2}\\) looks as Euclidean as\ncan be. A possible way out is suggested in Van Bendegem (1997). One of\nthe advantages of a discrete approach\u2014and, as a matter of fact,\nthis seems to hold in general for strict finitist proposals\u2014is\nthat definitions that are classically equivalent turn out to be\ndistinct in a strict finitist framework. Thus, more specifically, a\ncircle can be defined in (at least) two ways:\n\nas the set of points \\(p\\) that have a fixed distance to a fixed\npoint,\nas the set of points \\(p\\) such that, given a fixed line segment\n\\(ab\\), the angle formed by \\(apb\\) is a right angle.\n\n\nClassically speaking, these two definitions are equivalent. However,\nthey are not in a discrete geometry. If, e.g., the distance function\nis defined as the lowest number of hodons that connect two given\npoints, then the two definitions are not equivalent. Using definition\n(a), the circle will have the shape of a square (a well-known fact in\nso-called taxicab geometry) and thus useless to define adjacency as\ndone above. Definition (b) on the other hand produces a figure that\ncan approximate a Euclidean circle as close as one likes. In that way\nForrest\u2019s definition for adjacency is acceptable within a\ndiscrete framework, as no reference is made to a Euclidean distance\nfunction.\n\nThe third solution is to be found in Crouse and Skufca (2019), which\npresents an interesting synthesis of the two previous proposals to\nsolve the distance function problem. What they suggest is a kind of\nphysical interpretation that makes three things possible. Firstly, it\nallows to determine the lowest sizes for hodons and chronons in terms\nof Planck length and time. Secondly, it suggests a definition of the\ndistance from A to B in terms of the distance travelled by a\n\u201ctest\u201d hodon (in discrete minimal steps, of course). This\nsolves immediately the anisotropy problem as no directions are\nprivileged. Thirdly, it does not suppose the a priori existence\nof a grid (or a similar structure) as an absolute frame of reference.\nThis opens up the possibility to reformulate special relativity\ntheory, which they do. Although Silberstein\u2019s approach (see\n section 2.4\n above) is not mentioned, it is clearly related and can be considered\nto be an improvement, as the physical basis is philosophically better\nmotivated.\n\nIf these proposals and suggestions can be considered to be adequate\nresponses to Weyl\u2019s tile problem, recently another fine example\nof a no-go approach (and accompanying theorem) is to be found in Fritz\n(2013). Start out with an abstract formulation of a periodic graph,\ni.e., a set of vertices and a set of edges. For practical purposes,\nthe periodicity can be thought of as a crystalline structure. This\nmeans that we have a basic finite unit that can cover the whole of the\ngraph through iterated copies of that basic unit. Take as an example a\ntwo-dimensional structure. The vertices can be labeled or\n\u201cweighted\u201d by two numbers \\((i, j)\\). A trajectory\n\\((f_{n})_{n\\in N}\\) is a sequence of weights of vertices, such that\nthe vertices carrying \\(f_{n}\\) and \\(f_{n+1}\\) are connected by an\nedge. Next we define the (macroscopic) velocity of such a trajectory\nas \n\\[\nu= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{(f_n - f_0)}{n},\n\\]\n\n\nwhich sounds perfectly acceptable. Example: the trajectory such that\n\\(f_{n} = (n, 0)\\), starting from \\(f_{0} = (0, 0)\\) will have\nmacroscopic velocity 1, as \\(f_{n} - f_{0} = (n, 0)\\) and, divided by\n\\(n\\), this leaves (1, 0). Without going into the details, he then\nshows that the geometrical structure of all (macroscopic) velocities\nin such a graph cannot correspond to that of Euclidean space. The\nreason is quite simple (though the proofs are not): in the graph there\nwill always be singled-out, \u201cspecial\u201d directions and\nanisotropy will remain detectable even at the macroscopic level.\nTherefore a transition from the discrete level to the macroscopic,\ncontinuous, Euclidean and isotropic level is excluded. This is a truly\ninteresting result as it casts a shadow on all attempts to use a\ndirect, often rather naive transition from the discrete to the\ncontinuous level. At the same time, it pleads in favor of more complex\ntransitions from the microscopic to the macroscopic level, e.g., by\ntaking into account the width of a line.\n\nThe dimension problem. Not much attention has been paid to\nthis problem although it is fundamental. If the plane consists of a\ndiscrete set of elements, hodons or atoms, then this set must have\ndimension zero. For, in order to determine the dimension, this set\nmust be equipped with a topology and the only possible candidate is\nthe discrete topology. This entails that the dimension is zero. Either\none takes the option to simply drop the notion of dimension on the\nbasis of the argument that the concept of dimension presupposes a\nconcept of continuity and topology and hence has no finitist meaning.\nOr one searches for an analog, but it is not clear at all what that\ncould be. Something one should not try to do is to derive a notion of\ndimension from an ordering relation. Suppose that the hodons are\nlabeled by integers \\((i, j)\\) in some appropriate coordinate system,\nsuch that \\(-L\\le i\\), \\(j\\le L\\), where \\(L\\) is some upper bound.\nThen quite different ordering relations are possible. One possibility\nis to define \\((i, j) \\lt(k, l)\\) if and only if \\(i + j \\lt k + l\\).\nBut another possibility is to define \\((i, j) \\lt(k, l)\\) if and only\nif either \\(i \\lt k\\) or, if \\(i = k\\), then \\(j \\lt l\\). It therefore\nrequires additional arguments to claim that among all possible order\nrelations on a given set, one and only one has a special status.\nHowever in\n section 3\n we will see that, using the tools of graph theory, a definition of\ndimension can indeed be given.\n\nThe isotropy problem. If the plane is built up from square\nhodons, as in the paragraph above, then the hodons are arranged in\nsuch a way that every hodon touches four other hodons, i.e., the plane\ncan be modeled as a square grid, then it is obvious that there are\npreferred directions, in this case, there will be two preferred\ndirections. However if instead of squares, hexagons are taken as\nhodons, then there are three preferred directions. Thus no matter what\nthe shape is of the hodon, there will be preferred directions and this\nimplies that the space is anisotropic. Note that these cases are\nnothing but special instances of the general approach of Tobias Fritz,\ndiscussed above. However, for physical applications one would like to\nhave isotropy (or at least as close as possible).\n\nTwo approaches are possible, that do not fall under the Fritz no-go\ntheorem. Either the hodons have a definite shape or they do not. In\nthe first case it has been suggested that instead of a regular\nperiodic tiling of the plane, one should look for an irregular\naperiodic tiling, such as the Penrose tiling.\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nAlthough no worked-out examples are available, it seems a promising\nline of attack. In the case of the Penrose tiling it is interesting to\nsee that there are no classically straight lines anymore, precisely\nbecause of the aperiodicity. In the second case vagueness is a\npossible way out. As Peter Forrest in his (1995), and Crouse and\nSkufca in their (2019) defend, the whole idea of a specific\nrepresentation of a discrete space, e.g., as built up from tiny\nsquares is fundamentally mistaken. If a hodon has a specific form,\nthen one cannot avoid asking questions about parts of a hodon, such as\nits border, but that does not make sense if hodons are the smallest\nspatial entities possible. An intermediate position defended in Van\nBendegem (1997) is to consider a series of discrete geometries\n\\(G_{i}\\), each with a hodon of a particular size, \\(h_{i}\\), such\nthat \\(h_{i}\\ne h_{j}\\), for \\(i\\ne j\\) and, in addition, there are\n\\(M\\) and \\(N\\) such that \\(M \\lt h_{i} \\lt N\\), for all \\(i\\). One\ncan then apply a supervaluation technique to the series. This means\nthat a statement will be True (False) if it is true (false) in every\ngeometry \\(G_{i}\\). In all other cases it is Undecided, i.e., true in\nsome and false in some others. Now if \\(A\\) is the statement\n\u201chodons have size \\(\\alpha\\)\u201d (where \\(\\alpha\\) is a\nspecific number), this will be Undecided, if a corresponds to at least\none of the \\(h_{i}\\). Such an approach however introduces all problems\nconnected with vagueness into the discussion, which is not necessarily\nan encouraging situation. For this problem too, an original answer can\nbe given from within the framework of graph theory.\n\nThe identification problem. Suppose that we do have a\nfull-fledged discrete geometry and suppose that we replace the\nclassical geometry of a physical theory with the discrete version. We\nwill now be talking about hodons and chronons. The\n\u201cnatural\u201d question that arises is what is to be identified\nwith what? Imagine that, in line with Silberstein, we are a bit\nna\u00efve and would be tempted to identify the hodon with the Planck\nlength, \\(l_{p} = 10^{-35}\\text{m}\\) and the chronon with Planck time,\n\\(t_{p} = 10^{-43}\\text{s}\\). If one now accepts that the maximum\nspeed is one hodon per chronon, then what comes out of this\nidentification is that the maximum speed is indeed \\(c =\n3.10^{8}\\text{m/s}\\). (Note: nothing amazing is happening here, since\nin classical physics, \\(l_{p}\\) is defined as \\(\\sqrt{\\hbar G/c^3},\\)\nand \\(t_{p}\\) as \\(\\sqrt{\\hbar G/c^5},\\) so that it is immediately\nobvious that \\(l_{p}/t_{p} = c\\). Now ask the simple question what the\nnext speed will be, just below \\(c\\)? The answer must be: one hodon\nper two chronons, but that means a velocity of \\(c/2\\). We seem to\nhave missed out the whole range between \\(c/2\\) and \\(c\\). There is a\nway out, but it supposes that \u201cjerky\u201d motion is considered\npossible, an aesthetically quite ugly idea. An object moves two hodons\nin two chronons and then waits for one chronon and then repeats the\nsame motion. The average velocity is then \\(2c/3\\). One possible way\nout, that will be briefly mentioned in\n section 3.2,\n is to introduce an element of randomness into the structure. For an\nappreciation of the full complexity of this topic, going beyond merely\nnumerical relationships, see the excellent overview and discussion of\nHagar (2014).\n",
