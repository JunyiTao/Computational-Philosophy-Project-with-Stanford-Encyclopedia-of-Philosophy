    "main_text": "Work on Modal Logic || Prior and Kripke\n2.4 Prior and Kripke\n\n\nKripke first became interested in modal logic in 1956, as a result\nof reading Prior\u2019s paper \u2018Modality and Quantification in\nS5\u2019 (Prior 1956a). Kripke was at this time still at high school,\nworking on logic in almost complete isolation in Omaha, Nebraska. In\n1958, he read Time and Modality and was impressed by the\nparallel Prior drew between tense and the alethic modalities.\n\n\nAt almost exactly the same time, Prior was reading Kripke\u2019s\nfirst paper, \u2018A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic\u2019\n(Kripke 1959a), in his capacity as referee for the Journal of\nSymbolic Logic. In this paper Kripke stated and proved a\ncompleteness theorem for an extension of S5 with quantifiers and\nidentity; the binary relation made no appearance. His first publication\nto mention the binary relation\u2014which he interpreted as a relation\nof relative possibility between worlds\u2014was written in 1962 and\nappeared in 1963 (Kripke 1963); the paper contained completeness proofs\nfor propositional \\(M\\), S4, \\(B\\), and S5. Kripke reported\n(in correspondence with Copeland) that the idea of the binary relation\noccurred to him much earlier than 1962, in fact shortly after his paper\non S5 was first submitted in the spring of 1958.\n\n\nBy the late summer of 1958, Kripke had a completeness result for S4.\nOn 3 September 1958 he wrote to Prior, mentioning his work on\nsemantical completeness theorems for quantified extensions of S4 with\nand without the Barcan formula (Marcus 1946, 1962). (Prior himself had\nalready given an early counterexample to the Barcan formula in a\ntense-modal context (Prior 1957: 26, Copeland 2016).) In his September\nletter, Kripke gave a branching-time matrix, characteristic for S4.\nThis is essentially a tense-logical interpretation of the reflexivity +\ntransitivity semantics for S4. He wrote:\n\n\n\nin an indetermined system, we perhaps should not regard time as a\nlinear series, as you have done. Given the present moment, there are\nseveral possibilities for what the next moment may be like\u2014and\nfor each possible next moment, there are several possibilities for the\nmoment after that. Thus the situation takes the form, not of a linear\nsequence, but of a \u2018tree\u2019.\n\n\n\n(Some of the Kripke\u2013Prior correspondence is now published in\nPloug and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2012.)\n\n\nThere was a two-way traffic of ideas. A constant domain was assumed\nin Kripke\u2019s 1959 \u2018A Completeness Theorem in Modal\nLogic\u2019, and Kripke suspects that Time and Modality first\ninterested him in the problem of treating variable domains. He worked\non Prior\u2019s suggestion\u2014formalised in Prior\u2019s system\n\\(Q\\)\u2014that variable domains might lead to truth-value gaps\neven at the level of propositional logic, although Kripke did not\npursue this approach in his published material. Further, Kripke thinks\nit probable that Prior\u2019s work on many-valued matrices in Time\nand Modality gave him the idea of converting possible worlds\nmodels into many-valued matrices, an approach he followed in his 1963\npaper \u2018Semantical Analysis of Modal Logic I: Normal Modal\nPropositional Calculi\u2019.\n",
