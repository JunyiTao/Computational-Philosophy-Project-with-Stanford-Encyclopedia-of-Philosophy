The fifth and last proposal about how to\nexplain the possibility of false belief attempts to remedy the fourth\nproposal\u2019s incapacity\u2014which Plato says refutes it,\n196c5\u20137\u2014to deal with cases of false belief involving no\nperception, such as false arithmetical beliefs. \n\n\nIt attempts this by deploying a distinction between knowledge that\nsomeone merely has (latent knowledge) and knowledge that he\nis actually using (active knowledge). (Perhaps Plato\nis now exploring \u201cthe intermediate stages between knowing and\nnot knowing\u201d mentioned at 188a2\u20133.) The suggestion is that false\nbelief occurs when someone wants to use some item of latent knowledge\nin his active thought, but makes a wrong selection from among the\nitems that he knows latently.\n\n\nIf this proposal worked it would cover false arithmetical belief.  But\nthe proposal does not work, because it is regressive. If there is a\nproblem about the very possibility of confusing two things, it is no\nanswer to this problem to suppose that for each thing there is a\ncorresponding item of knowledge, and that what happens when two\nthings are confused is really that the two corresponding\nitems of knowledge are confused\n(200a\u2013b).\n\n\nThe Aviary rightly tries to explain false belief by complicating our\npicture of belief. But it complicates in the wrong way and the wrong\nplace. It is no help to complicate the story by throwing in further\nobjects of the same sort as the objects that created the difficulty\nabout false belief in the first place. What is needed is a different\nsort of object for thought: a kind of object that can be thought of\nunder different aspects (say, as \u201cthe sum of 5 and 7,\u201d or\nas \u201cthe integer 12\u201d). There are no such aspects to the\n\u201citems of knowledge\u201d that the Aviary deals in. As with the\nconception of the objects of thought and knowledge that we found in\nthe Wax Tablet, it is this lack of aspects that dooms the Aviary\u2019s\nconception of the objects of knowledge too. Like the Wax Tablet, the\nAviary founders on its own inability to accommodate the point that\nthought cannot consist merely in the presentation of a series of inert\n\u201cobjects of thought.\u201d  Whether these objects of thought\nare mental images drawn from perception or something else, the\nthinking is not so much in the objects of thought as in what is\ndone with those objects (186d2\u20134).\n\n\nWe may illustrate this by asking: When the dunce who supposes that 5 +\n7 = 11 decides to activate some item of knowledge to be the answer to\n\u201cWhat is the sum of 5 and 7?,\u201d which item of\nknowledge does he thus decide to activate? At first only two answers\nseem possible: either he decides to activate 12, or he decides to\nactivate 11. If he decides to activate 12, then we cannot explain the\nfact that what he actually does is activate 11, except by saying that\nhe mistakes the item of knowledge which is 11 for the item of\nknowledge which is 12. But this mistake is the very mistake ruled out\nas impossible right at the beginning of the inquiry into false belief\n(188a\u2013c).  Alternatively, if he decides to activate 11, then we have\nto ask why he decides to do this. The most plausible answer\nto that question is: \u201cBecause he believes falsely that 5 + 7 =\n11.\u201d But as noted above, if he has already formed this false\nbelief, within the account that is supposed to explain false\nbelief, then a regress looms.\n\n\nIn fact, the correct answer to the question \u201cWhich item of\nknowledge does the dunce decide to activate?\u201d is neither\n\u201c12\u201d nor \u201c11.\u201d It is \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7.\u201d But this answer does\nnot save the Aviary theorist from the dilemma just pointed out; for it\nis not available to him. To be able to give this answer, the Aviary\ntheorist would have to be able to distinguish \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7\u201d from\n\u201c12.\u201d But since \u201c12\u201d is \u201cthat\nnumber which is the sum of 5 and 7,\u201d this distinction\ncannot be made by anyone who takes the objects of thought to be simple\nin the way that the Aviary theorist seems to.\n\n\nAt 199e1 ff. Theaetetus suggests an amendment to the Aviary. This is\nthat we might have items of ignorance in our heads as well as\nitems of knowledge. As Socrates remarks, these ignorance-birds can be\nconfused with knowledge-birds in just the same way as knowledge-birds\ncan be confused with each other. So the addition does not help.\n",
