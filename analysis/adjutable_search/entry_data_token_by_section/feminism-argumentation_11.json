    "main_text": "Credibility and Argumentative Injustice\n4. Credibility and Argumentative Injustice\n\nCredibility granted to speakers and their testimony affects processes\nof arguing and may adhere to social categories following lines of\ngender and other axes of oppression (Govier 1993). Miranda Fricker\n(2007) describes the case of testimonial injustice, which is a species\nof epistemic injustice, and identifies when a listener gives\ndiminished credibility or epistemic authority to a speaker based on\nthat speaker\u2019s social identity. Patrick Bondy (2010) defines\nanalogous \u201cargumentative injustice\u201d as consisting in a\nrelated harm done to the processes of arguing when people wrongly\nassess an arguer\u2019s credibility. We can underestimate or\noverestimate an arguer\u2019s credibility by using social stereotypes\nto assess it (2010). Bondy explains that both overestimation and\nunderestimation can result from viewing testifiers through social\nstereotypes\u2014typically men\u2019s credibility becomes\noverestimated whereas women\u2019s becomes underestimated.\nAdditionally, testimony from people with social identities different\nfrom our own may be difficult to accept simply because their\nexperiences contrast with our own and those experiences with which we\nidentify. This second problem when considered as a fallacy goes by the\nname of \u201cprovincialism\u201d (Kahane & Cavender\n2001)\u00a0and is sometimes attributed to the psychology of in-group\nbias (Brewer 1979; Rudman & Goodman 2004). Whether due to\nstereotypes or to in-group bias, being discounted as a participant in\ndiscussion amounts to an epistemic injustice that Christopher Hookway\n(2010) describes as \u201cparticipant injustice\u201d.\n\nBondy argues that an underestimated testifier loses at least some\ncapacity for critical engagement with other people. This capacity\nmight progressively deteriorate, or the person might internalize its\ndiminished form. Underestimating a testifier undermines the\nrationality of arguing processes with the result that the audience\ntends to lose potentially valuable information and insight. On the\nother hand, an overestimated testifier also can fail to gain valuable\ninformation from others, derailing the argumentative exchange by\npreventing the success of the better line of reasoning. After the\nparticular discussion, the overestimated person can come to be viewed\nas beyond scrutiny, thus losing (at least on occasion) the benefits of\nengaging in discursive argumentation. By contrast, Fricker\u2019s\noriginal conception of testimonial injustice accounts for the harmful\neffects on knowers only when their testimony is underestimated, and\nshe argues that epistemic injustice does not accrue from\noverestimating credibility.\n\nThe solution to argumentative injustice might be simply for the\nlistener to take care to treat arguers on their own terms. This would\navoid viewing people in terms of group membership, a practice that\nleaves reasoners vulnerable to stereotype-thinking (Govier 1993,\n1999). However, sometimes people\u2019s social identities are\nrelevant to the credibility of what they say, when, for instance, it\nconcerns their personal experience of discrimination. Also, social\nstereotypes influence our thinking unconsciously, in a way that earns\nthe label \u201cimplicit bias\u201d. This bias differs from in-group\nbias but works alongside it, sometimes reinforcing it and sometimes\nconflicting with it. As a result, women often hold prejudices against\nother women (and even themselves) just as men do, and people of color\nmay hold unconscious biases against their own ethnicity. When such\nbias persists despite conscious beliefs to the contrary, psychologists\ndescribe it as \u201caversive bias\u201d (Greenwald & Banaji\n1995; Jost, Banaji, & Nosek 2004; Kay & Zanna 2009).\n\nImplicit social biases work like other cognitive biases, such as those\nthat encourage us to generalize from small samples and personal\nexperience and can affect many of our best intentions in reasoning and\nargumentation. Insofar as these biases undermine our ability to manage\nour own confidence, they frustrate the virtue of intellectual humility\nthat otherwise might offset adversarial inclinations and momentum when\npeople argue (Kidd 2016; Aberdein 2016). Ian James Kidd considers ways\nin which arguing can foster humility, and suggests that ideally,\narguing\n\n\nis also a route to other intellectual and ethical goods such as truth,\nknowledge, and enlightenment, as the ancient philosophers maintained.\n(2016: 399)\n\n\nThe challenge remains to bridge the real and the ideal.\n\nBondy argues that because social bias may be inevitable in\npeople\u2019s perception of speakers\u2019 credibility, we need to\ncounteract it actively. He recommends that we adopt a general attitude\nof \u201cmetadistrust\u201d in which we exercise skepticism about\nour credibility judgments regarding testimony from people belonging to\nmarginalized social groups.\n\nAlternatively, we might try \u201cintellectual empathy\u201d based\non mutual compassion, which is the approach that Linker develops. She\nargues that compassion must involve consciousness of how oppression\noperates through specific intersecting social matrices, including\nsocial privileges that can be very difficult to recognize. Such\nintersectional intellectual empathy may especially help us realize\nthat it is our own biases or limited experiences that lead us\nto dismiss others\u2019 testimony by interpreting them as whining,\ncomplaining, or \u201cplaying the gender (or race, etc.) card\u201d\n(Linker 2011, 2015).\n\nAchieving epistemic justice when we argue requires some sort of\naccounting for the identities of arguers, and might include appeal to\nthe \u201cepistemic privilege\u201d described in feminist standpoint\nepistemology. Some standpoint theorists maintain that epistemic\nprivilege can accrue to people who oppose oppression. Their engagement\nwith the lives of oppressed people and their resistance to the\noppression structuring those lives provides a unique and valuable\nawareness of the social structures of power. Thus a \u201cfeminist\nstandpoint\u201d and those who achieve it may gain epistemic\nadvantage from fighting the oppressed condition of women\u2019s\nlives. Although it is not necessary to be a woman to achieve this\nstandpoint and its advantage, women themselves may most easily achieve\nit (Harding 1991; Intemann 2010).\n\nOne way that arguers might try to address the effects of social\nposition on arguing is through meta-debate\u2014a background argument\nmay address arguers\u2019 biases operating in the central discussion\n(Kotzee 2010). However, Linker (2014) argues that regardless of what\nthe meta-debate yields, the person with social privilege will continue\nto benefit from debates that are adversarial. Arguers have difficulty\nrecognizing when their biases reflect their own social privilege at\nany level of debate because social identity frequently affects\ntestimonial authority unconsciously.\n\nLinker suggests that we treat epistemic privilege as a form of\nexpertise about arguing. This allows feminists and other\nanti-oppression advocates to set the bounds for ending inquiry (2014).\nSuch advocates operate as the authority and determine the\nplace where explanation stops (Hanrahan & Antony 2005). Rooney\nargues that this kind of expertise should be accorded to women\nphilosophers whose lived experience tends to ground their feminist\nphilosophy. Arguers should recognize expertise in situations\n\n\nwhere A\u2019s minority status relative to B (with\nrespect to some locally salient status or power differential) makes it\nlikely that A has insights and understandings relating to\nP that are less available to B. (2012: 322)\n\n\nRooney says that speaking from personal experience becomes important\nfor arguing because of the \u201chermeneutical injustices\u201d\n(Fricker 2007) facing women. Hermeneutical injustice, according to\nFricker, means that women\u2019s experiences may not receive adequate\nconsideration because the language to describe them is underdeveloped.\nMen may therefore have trouble recognizing evidence that women\nprovide, and they\n\n\nare not in the same position as women to confidently assert whether\nthey find it plausible or not because they do not have access to the\nevidence in the way women are likely to have.
