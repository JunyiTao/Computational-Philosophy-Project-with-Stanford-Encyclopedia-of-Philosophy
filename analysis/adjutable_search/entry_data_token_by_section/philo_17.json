    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || Virtues, the paths to perfection\n5.3 Virtues, the paths to perfection\n\nMost philosophical themes related to virtue are present in the\nPhilonian treatises. The four traditional virtues (phronesis\n[prudence], s\u00f4phrosyn\u00e8 [temperance],\nandreia [courage], dikaiosun\u00e8 [justice]) are\ncompleted through enkrateia which pertains more specifically\nto the Cynic-Stoic tradition as the science of that which appears in\nline with right reason. In Spec. 4.135, we find a different\ndefinition of the four cardinal virtues: eusebeia (piety,\nsanctity) is defined as \u201cthe queen of virtues\u201d, and\nwisdom, temperance, and justice following. In the treatise De\nvirtutibus, metanoia (repentance) and eugeneia\n(nobility) have special importance (Wilson 2010). The first concept,\nconsidered an unhappy passion by the Stoics, is the equivalent of the\nJewish concept of teshuva. In Philo, it expresses the strong\nconnection between theological and moral reflection. Eugeneia\nhas nothing of a racist concept, since all those who are temperate and\njust are truly noble (Virt. 189). Abraham, son of a Chaldean\nastrologist, becomes the symbol of true nobility when he emigrated\nfrom polytheism to monotheism.\n\nOne of the most interesting elements in the Philonian presentation of\nvirtues is the understanding of matriarchs as allegorical symbols of\nvirtues. Gender differences are a complex and interesting aspect of\nthe Alexandrine\u2019s thought. One cannot deny his misogyny, which,\nhowever, is not common since it is expressed through rather\nsophisticated semantic webs. Virtue is, on his view, masculine in its\nessence, since it is powerful and active. The realm of reason is\nmasculine, \u201cfor nature is the law of men, and to follow nature\nis the mark of a strong and truly masculine reason\u201d\n(Ebr. 54\u20135). Why, then, are women, the matriarchs,\nchosen as symbols of virtues? The answer given in Fug. 51 is\nthat God used a feminine appearance so that even the most perfect\nhuman qualities would be imperfect. Each matriarch has her allegorical\npeculiarities. Sarah, for example, is said to have nothing to do with\nthe world of women and to be born, like Athena, from the father of\neverything (Ebr. 60\u20131). At the same time, she unites\nwith Abraham to give birth to Isaac, who is the allegory of joy, one\nof the three Stoic good passions (eupatheiai) which also\ninclude will (boul\u00e8sis) and caution\n(eulabeia).\n\nIn Stoicism, virtue, or human perfection, is the natural end\n(telos) of the programming of mankind by Providence. In\nPhilo, things are more complex because of Original Sin. For the\nStoics, there was no ontologisation of evil in a world which was\nentirely rational, and to become as perfect as God was not an absurd\nproject. Philo lived in a period when most philosophers chose a more\nmodest purpose: to become like God as far as possible by flying from\nthe earthly sphere to the heavenly realm (Plato, Theaetetus\n176 a\u2013b). To live in the least imperfect way was the goal, a\ngoal which had some similarities with the Stoic figure of the\nprokopt\u00f4n, the person making moral progress. Philo knew\nthe different aspects of this figure and gave his own interpretation\nof it in Agr. 15. The striving towards a lesser imperfection\ncould take three forms, a division with Platonic/Pythagorean origin\nbut embodied by the example of the patriarchs. Abraham embodies the\neffort to know, in traveling from astrology to real comprehension of\nnature, then from the comprehension of nature to \u201cthe maker and\nfather of the world\u201d; Isaac symbolizes the happy nature,\n\u201cthe new race, superior to reason and truly divine\u201d\n(Fug. 168); and Jacob, the struggle against senses and\npassions. Philo stresses the fact that each of these three types is\npresent in the other two (Abr. 52\u201353). From a formal\npoint of view, the relation among the three types is not fundamentally\ndifferent from that of the virtues in the Stoic system which aims to\nreconcile the unity of the whole and the specificity of each\nelement.On the specificities of the character of Joseph in\nHellenistic philosophy, see Niehoff (1992)\n\n\nThere is an element which differentiates Philo from his contemporary\nphilosophers and rabbis: the absence of a master. It is impossible to\nfind in his vast corpus the name of someone who initiated him to\nphilosophy or to Biblical exegesis. Why this silence about his\nmasters? One possible explanation is that for Philo, transmission is\ngreater than the transmitters. He is consistent regarding this\nposition when he speaks very little of himself. His main idea is that\n\u201cthe only good that is infallible and firm is faith in\nGod\u201d (Abr. 268). The human being can improve herself,\nand she can have a clear conscience (suneid\u00easis is a\nkey word of Philo\u2019s ethical vocabulary) of the ethical issues,\nbut this does not allow her to assert her real existence.\n",
