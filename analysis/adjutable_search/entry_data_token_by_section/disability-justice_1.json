    "main_text": "Models of Disability and Their Implications for Justice\n2. Models of Disability and Their Implications for Justice\n\n\u201cDisability\u201d is typically defined in terms of two\nelements: (i) a physical or mental characteristic labeled or perceived\nas an impairment or dysfunction, and (ii) a significant personal or\nsocial limitation associated with that characteristic. The\nrelationship between these two elements\u2014and the role of the\nenvironment in mediating them\u2014is a core issue in the\nconceptualization of, and social response to, disability. The\nmedical model treats disability as an individual physical or\nmental characteristic with significant personal and social\nconsequences. In particular, it sees the limitations faced by people\nwith disabilities as resulting primarily or solely from their\nimpairments. By contrast, the various social models see\ndisability as a relationship between individuals and their social\nenvironments: physical and mental characteristics are limiting only or\nprimarily in virtue of social practices that lead to the exclusion of\npeople with those characteristics. This exclusion is manifested not\nonly in deliberate segregation, but in built environments and social\npractices that restrict the participation of people regarded as having\ndisabilities (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n\nIn their extreme forms, which treat the impairment or environment\n(respectively) as the sole cause of personal and social limitation,\nthe medical and social models have few, if any, defenders. Rather,\nthey mark the limits of possible relationships between impairment and\nlimitation. Almost all writers on disability acknowledge some role for\nboth the impairment and the environment in causing limitations; the\ndisagreement largely concerns the assessment of their comparative\ncontribution, and their interaction. Most scholars who embrace some\nversion of the social model acknowledge that\nimpairments\u2014generally but not universally understood as\ndeviations from species-relative statistical norms\u2014can be\nsources of discomfort and limitation even in the absence of\ndisadvantaging social practices (e.g., Shakespeare 2006, Thomas 2004).\nThese scholars would argue, however, that such adverse effects are far\nless damaging than social exclusion, are greatly magnified by hostile\nenvironments, and could be significantly reduced by more inclusive\nenvironments. The medical model is less often explicitly defended than\nunreflectively adopted\u2014by health care professionals,\nbioethicists, and philosophers who ignore or underestimate the\ncontribution of social and other environmental factors to the\nlimitations faced by people with disabilities. Even among these\ngroups, however, there is a growing awareness of the environmental\ncontribution to disability and a partial embrace of the social model\n(Cureton and Brownlee 2009).\n\nTo the extent that it is held by anyone in unalloyed form, the medical\nmodel of disability would not deny that disability raises issues of\njustice. Indeed, that model might give support to the view that the\ndisadvantages perceived as inherent to disability raise some of the\nmost urgent claims of justice (Barclay 2011, 2018). But such a model\ndoes not recognize any principled rationale for preferring\nreconstruction of the social and built environment over compensation\nor correction as a means for correcting disability-related\ndisadvantage, a point made by Wolff (2009a, 2009b), among others. In\ncontrast, the social model strongly supports such a rationale, since\nit construes many aspects of disability-related disadvantage as\nessentially connected to various forms of literal and\nfigurative exclusion. Relatedly, the social model construes\nreconstruction as a public good: more accessible structures and more\ninclusive practices can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people with\nand without disabilities (Scotch and Schriner 1997). But such\nreconstruction also helps to achieve a fairer distribution of tangible\nand intangible goods, particularly social and economic\nopportunities.\n\nSome critics accuse social model theorists of assuming that any\ndisadvantage caused by the social environment is ipso facto\nunjust (Samaha 2007). This assumption would reflect an oversimplified\nview of the relationship between causing disadvantage and creating\ninjustice. The fact that social structures or practices cause\ndisadvantage does not imply that there is a duty of justice to correct\nor compensate for the disadvantage. That will depend on the costs of\nalleviating it, and\u2014under any plausible theory of\njustice\u2014some comparison with the advantages and disadvantages\nthat would result from alternative social arrangements. Thus, for\nexample, choosing to spend the bulk of a municipal arts budget on a\nconcert hall rather than an art museum may disadvantage those who\ncannot hear. But that disadvantage, although caused by a social\ndecision, is not necessarily unjust. That will depend, inter\nalia, on the availability of non-auditory forms of aesthetic\nexperience and the comparative costs of building the museum instead.\nTo take another example, placing ramps and elevators in new high-rise\nbuildings is relatively inexpensive and beneficial to most users,\nwhereas placing them in nineteenth century walk-ups is difficult and\nexpensive; holding public meetings or events in buildings with ramps\nand elevators has negligible costs, whereas moving an existing\nbusiness from a building that lacks them to one that has them may be\nvery expensive (Samaha 2007; Wasserman 2001).\n\nThe difficulty of inferring injustice from socially caused\ndisadvantage is clear in contexts where greater social provision\nsecures incremental advantage. In such contexts, the question of how\nmuch is just will not always have an obvious answer. For example, it\nwould at least marginally benefit wheelchair-users to have additional\nrestricted parking spaces, but we could hardly infer an injustice from\nthe fact that an institution provided N rather than N +\n1 such spaces. Intuitively, the allotment should be proportionate to\nthe number of wheelchair users in the community or at the facility,\nbut that number may be uncertain, and a range of spaces would likely\nsatisfy any proportionality\n requirement.[1]\n In deciding how many spaces are enough, we would receive no guidance\nfrom the indisputable fact that any disadvantage or advantage in this\ncontext would have social causes.\n\nConversely, the fact that social arrangements do not cause or\ncontribute to a disadvantage does not insulate it from claims of\njustice; the failure to alleviate that disadvantage may be unjust on\nplausible accounts of justice. Thus, although many\n\u201cnatural\u201d disasters like Hurricanes Katrina owe much\nof their destructive impact to social arrangements, it is plausible\nthat the state\u2019s duty to support the victims of hurricanes and\ntsunamis is not contingent on its responsibility for causing or\nexacerbating them (Wasserman\n 2001).[2]\n Indeed, as we discuss below, various forms of luck egalitarianism do\nnot distinguish between disadvantages caused versus merely not\ncorrected by society\u2019s institutions, provided that the relevant\ndisadvantages are equally severe and equally unchosen by those\ndisadvantaged.\n\nNevertheless, the causal claims made by social-model theorists are\nrelevant to justice in several ways. First, as suggested above, for\nmost theories of justice, the mere fact that the social environment\ncan be modified in ways that alleviate the disadvantages associated\nwith impairment places demands for their alleviation within the scope\nof justice\u2014as claims that a theory of justice must consider and\nweigh. Second, the fact that those disadvantages are caused by social\narrangements is relevant for those theories that regard society as\nhaving a stronger duty not to create or aggravate disadvantages than\nit has to prevent or correct them (Wasserman 2001, Schemmel 2012).\nFinally, alleviating the disadvantages attributable to prejudice or\nstigma will enjoy priority on any theory of justice that treats\ndisadvantage resulting from prejudice or stigma as a greater injustice\nthan innocently-created\n disadvantage.[3]\n\n\nBeyond a shared concern with the social causation of disability,\ndifferent versions of the social model emphasize different features of\nthe exclusionary structures and practices (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n The minority group model regards people with impairments as\na stigmatized minority group. It holds that the main reason people\nwith disabilities encounter special hardships is that they face\ndiscrimination akin to that faced by racial or ethnic minorities (Hahn\n1987, Oliver 1990). The human variation model holds that many\nof the challenges faced by disabled people do not result from\ndeliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch between their\ncharacteristics and the physical and social environment (Scotch and\nSchriner 1997). These two versions of the social model differ mainly\nin emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group model\ngenerally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with stigmatized differences. Yet the failure to\nfully accommodate people with various differences, from extreme height\nto intellectual impairment, does not necessarily arise from stigma.\nBut often, disparities in access that were initially caused by\nresource or technological limits are maintained by stigma. For\nexample, an employer\u2019s initial purchase of communications\ntechnology inaccessible to blind or deaf employees may be explained by\nthe fact that accessible technology had not been developed at the time\nof purchase. But those historic facts would not justify the\nemployer\u2019s refusal to include modestly priced accessibility\nfeatures when purchasing upgrades a decade later, for example.\n\nBoth versions of the social model require the removal of barriers and\npractices serving to exclude people with disabilities, and the\nreconstruction of the environment to more fully include them. Under a\nminority-group model, these measures are dictated primarily by a\ndemand for recognition and respect, and for the correction of past\nexpressions of disrespect found in the knowing exclusion of people\nwith disabilities from many aspects of social, political, and economic\nlife. The human variation model puts less weight on the expressive or\nsymbolic significance of past exclusion. Rather than construing people\nwith disabilities as a \u201cdiscrete and insular minority\u201d\ncreated by practices of more or less deliberate exclusion, the human\nvariation model construes people with disabilities as simply people\nwho differ in degree from the majority of statistically normal\npopulation with respect to one or more physical or mental\ncharacteristics. The purpose of reconstruction is not so much to end\nspecific exclusionary practices as to create a more inclusive physical\nand social environment. Given this difference in emphasis, it is\nnatural to understand the human variation model as appealing\nprincipally to norms of distributive fairness, ensuring equal or\nadequate access to the physical and social environment, in contrast to\nthe minority group model, which appeals more explicitly to norms of\nrespect and recognition. \n\nThe demand for greater inclusiveness is less categorical than the\ndemand to eliminate discrimination. Although any environment can be\nmade more inclusive, none can be fully inclusive for everyone (Barclay\n2010, 2018). This is not necessarily because, as Barclay, following\nShakespeare (2006), claims, the inclusionary features required for one\nimpairment often conflict with those required by another. Such\nconflicts may be minor, temporary, and remediable. The problem is more\ngeneral: 1) for many characteristics, from height to mathematical\naptitude, one \u201csize\u201d does not fit all; 2) providing\ndifferent sizes increases fit for a wider range of variation, but at\nincreasing cost (albeit less than often assumed); and 3) it is\nfrequently impractical, and may arguably be unjust, to ensure that\neveryone is equally well-or ill-fitted; it may, for example, be too\nexpensive to ensure that left-handed or extremely tall individuals\nsuffer no inconvenience in being statistical minorities. Full\ninclusion, like universal design, is an ideal\u2014one that cannot be\nfully achieved, and that must be compromised in the partial\nsatisfaction of other legitimate claims.\n\nEven if it would be impossible or unreasonable to achieve full\ninclusion through wholesale changes in the physical or social\nenvironment, modest changes could significantly increase inclusion at\nlittle cost. Some examples come from a study of environment\nmodification for autistic individuals (Owren 2013). Some people with\nautism face significant barriers to taking part in routine social\nactivities: they find such familiar stimuli as applause, light\ntouching, and deodorant as highly aversive; they must be explicitly\ninstructed about social expectations because they cannot\n\u201cread\u201d most facial expressions or social clues. The\nstudy\u2019s author recognizes that the \u201cneurotypical\nmajority\u201d cannot be expected to give up applause, light\ntouching, or even deodorant, let alone nuance in communication:\n\n\nWhat would be lost? Large parts of what may be some of the most\ntreasured areas of communication: the art of innuendo, the double\nmeaning at the heart of much comedy, irony, the implied meaning at the\nheart of so much poetry,\u2026 flirtation and \u201cfeeling each\nother out\u201d before committing to something that cannot be\nretracted. (2013: 23-24)\n\n\nAt the same time, the author points out that the majority could often\ngain from more modest accommodations. \n\n\nMany neurotypicals might profit from being more explicit and from\nothers being more explicit, as can be illustrated by the extensive\nfocus in couples therapy on getting partners to state their needs and\nexpectations more explicitly, not relying on other to pick up on\n\u201cvaguely described, implied, or unspoken behavioral\nexpectations\u201d. (2013: 92) \n\n\nThe author suggests (2013: 111) that it may be feasible to develop\n\u201cbest practices\u201d: \u201cstrategies for enhancing\naccessibility and reducing sensory issues in a larger scale\u201d\nwithout unduly burdening the majority:\n\n\nOne strategy might be to incorporate into Universal design the\npractice of providing access to low stimulation areas in mainstream\nsettings. Another might be to create more public acceptance of\nautistic behaviors like\n stimming,[4]\n which seem to help many autistic people reduce the impact of aversive\nsensory stimuli.\u2026 (2013: 111)\n\n\nSuch strategies clearly involve tradeoffs, but those tradeoffs would\ninvolve small economic and social costs for a majority to achieve\nlarge gains in inclusion for a minority. The claim that it is\nimpossible to achieve, or even understand, full inclusion for people\nwith autism does not deny that there is significant injustice in their\ncurrent state of social isolation.\n\nThe challenges for social models of disability for justice may seem\ngreatest for intellectual and psychiatric impairments, as well as for\ncomplex physical impairments such as fibromyalgia, multiple chemical\nsensitivity, and other conditions that radically and unpredictably\naffect energy, stamina, and functioning (Wendell 1989, 1996; Davis\n2005). First, these conditions strikingly display both aspects of\nimpairment, as markers for stigma and as sources of functional\nlimitation (see SEP entry,\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Cognitive and psychiatric impairments evoke some of the strongest\nprejudice and all present some of the most difficult functional\nlimitations, e.g., on the capacities to engage in practical reasoning,\nto recognize the intentions and attitudes of other people, or to\nparticipate in shared activities.Second, some theorists contend that\nthese conditions pose more of a practical challenge for the social\nmodel than even the most severe physical disabilities, in part because\nthe measures required for greater inclusion are not as concrete or\ntangible, and may demand greater imagination to envision and\n implement.[5]\n\n\nAlthough significant practical work has been done in educational and\nworkplace inclusion, philosophers have been daunted by the challenge\nof social reconstruction for cognitive disabilities. Thus Jonathan\nWolff, who generally favors such reconstruction\u2014which he calls\n\u201cstatus enhancement\u201d\u2014as the most respectful\nintervention, asks \n\n\nWhat would it mean to change the world so that people with cognitive\ndisabilities and other people were equally able to find a worthwhile\nplace in the world? Can we even imagine what this would be? (2009a:\n407) \n\n\nMany rights and privileges are thought to require a certain level of\ncognitive capacity, e.g., the right to vote or contract (Wikler 1979).\nSimilarly, most jobs are structured to require regular hours,\nuninterrupted activity, undivided attention, and general\nsociability.\n\nHow much should a society modify these requirements or restructure\nthese activities to include people with various intellectual,\npsychiatric, and complex physical disabilities? A total relaxation of\nsuch requirements would impose large, even \u201cunduly\nburdensome\u201d costs. However, many modifications to promote the\ninclusion of people with significant cognitive impairments would also\nbenefit people with typical cognitive function: simplified task\nexplanations, warning labels, news copy, and jury instructions. Many\naccommodations employers are already making to increase flexibility\nand reduce stress, from individually-tailored schedules to\ntelecommuting, would ease the entry of people with these disabilities\ninto the workplace. There is a growing body of practical and policy\nwork that applies social models of disability to people with\nintellectual, psychiatric, and complex physical impairments (e.g.,\nBiklen 1992; Block 2006; Connor et al. 2008; Hehir 2002).\n\nAs discussed later in this Entry, there is sharp disagreement about\nwhether individuals with the most severe intellectual impairments\nqualify as subjects of justice. But even if individuals with the most\nsubstantial intellectual impairments are regarded as subjects of\njustice, what justice demands for them, and of them, may be uncertain\nor disputed. Nussbaum (2009) contends that the equal citizenship of\nthose individuals requires that they be enabled to exercise such\npolitical rights as voting and jury service through appropriate\nsurrogates. Wasserman and McMahan (2012) question whether those rights\ncould be meaningfully exercised by surrogates for individuals with the\nmost severe intellectual disabilities.\n\nSome philosophical intimation of a social model approach to cognitive\ndisability can be found in Dan Wikler\u2019s 1979 essay,\n\u201cPaternalism and the Mildly Retarded\u201d. Wikler held that\nthe category of cognitive disability was socially constructed by the\ncompetence thresholds set for important social activities, such as\nsigning a contract or voting in an election. But although society\nchooses, in this sense, who will be cognitively impaired, it does not\nhave unlimited flexibility, since there can be significant social\ncosts in altering those thresholds. The issue, Wikler concluded, was\nultimately one of justice; of fairly distributing the burdens of\nsetting thresholds that will be too high for some or too low for\nothers. Yet Wikler questioned whether justice would require, or even\npermit, the kind of modifications necessary for significantly greater\nparticipation. Writing two decades later, Wolff cited Wikler in\nstating, \n\n\nthe fact is that what makes much of modern life possible now relies on\nbinding and enforceable contracts that in turn assume a certain level\nof intellectual competence. To change the world so that such a bar is\nlowered would have tremendous costs. (2009a: 407)\n\n\nThis pessimism has prevailed in the years since Wikler wrote, and\nthere has been little philosophical attention to practical\npossibilities for the inclusion of people with cognitive impairments.\nAlthough there have been interesting discussions of this issue in the\ncontext of education (e.g., Howe 1996; Ladenson 2005; Veatch 1986),\nthe general issue has tended to be dealt with in summary fashion.\n(Exceptions include Kittay and Carlson 2010; Hartley 2009a; Silvers\nand Francis 2009; Wong 2007, 2009.) Thus, for cognitive disabilities,\nWolff emphasizes \u201ctargeted resource enhancement\u201d rather\nthan status enhancement, arguing for an entitlement scheme that gives\npeople with cognitive disabilities maximum possible control over an\nindividual budget for personal assistance and social support (2009a:\n407\u2013413). He does regard some forms of status enhancement,\nnotably antidiscrimination measures, \u201cas essential\u201d, but\nhe accepts Wikler\u2019s conclusion that broader changes in social\npractice carry \u201cintolerable costs\u201d (2009a: 413).\n\nIn their influential book From Chance to Choice, Buchanan et\nal. (2000) repeat the assertion that there would be excessive social\ncosts in reconstructing society to permit the full participation of\npeople with significant cognitive impairments. They compare the\nreconstruction of society for greater inclusion with a family decision\nto play only the card games that a young child can understand. They\ncontend that just as adults will tire of a constant game of Go Fish,\nthe society will be \u201cdumbed down\u201d if it refashions itself\nto fully include people with cognitive impairments.\n\nAlthough the meaning of inclusion is debatable, and different forms of\ninclusion will have differing value for different people, the\ncard-game analogy oversimplifies the challenge. To present inclusion\nas a zero-sum allocation is to dumb down the incredibly complex task\nof rearranging society to respect and nurture all its members. The\nanalogy assumes that every activity must be done by everyone, which is\nfalse.\n\nA more apt analogy to organized social activity might be an assortment\nof games that can be played by different combinations of people in\ndifferent ways. Some games could be played by everyone; others could\nbe modified to include cognitively impaired people in a way that\npreserved the interest of non-disabled players; some would be beyond\nthe reach of people with certain cognitive impairments. But even the\nmost cognitively gifted individuals could not participate in all\ngames\u2014the sheer amount of training and practice required to\nmaster some of them, and the considerable time and energy many of them\nrequire, would preclude participation in many or most. Indeed, society\nmay function better if people have varying aptitudes for, and\ninterests in, different activities. (A similar criticism of the\ncard-game analogy is offered by Wong (2007), who recounts how her\nbrother with Down enriched rather than impoverished family life.) The\nfact that a smaller set of activities may be available to people with\ncognitive impairments need not present a problem, if it does not\nresult in their social isolation or deny them intellectual challenges\n(Parens & Asch 2000: 25\u201326 [quoting Philip Ferguson,\npersonal correspondence]). But ensuring their participation may\nrequire society to refashion itself in significant ways.\n\nIt is not clear that such refashioning would impose the\n\u201cintolerable costs\u201d feared by Wolff. Social inclusion does\nnot require, for example, that individuals with significant cognitive\nimpairments be able to make binding contracts in every domain of law\nand business; it requires that competence standards be graduated to\nreflect the complexity of specific tasks so that those individuals are\nnot categorically excluded \u2013a suggestion made more than two\ndecades ago by the authors of the card-game metaphor (Buchanan and\nBrock 1990). Social model theorists know full well that\nimpairments\u2014physical as well as cognitive\u2014differ from skin\ncolor in that they are sometimes relevant to what people can do, as\nare such other attributes as education and income. But that feature of\nimpairment hardly precludes social reconstruction. Indeed, the most\neffective rebuttal to the card-game metaphor may be found in the\npractical work that already has been done in educational and workplace\ninclusion (e.g., Biklen 1992; Block 2006; Hehir 2002; McGuire et al.\n2006). At the same time, it bears emphasis that the social model of\ndisability was originally conceptualized in terms of physical\ndisabilities. And there may be significant limitations on the extent\nto which it applies to cognitive disabilities. More generally,\nalthough it may be useful to speak of \u201cthe\u201d social model\nof \u201cdisability\u201d, the diversity of impairments that fall\nunder the extension of \u201cdisability\u201d suggests that the\naptness of the social model in any given context will vary depending\non the nature of the impairments at issue.\n",
