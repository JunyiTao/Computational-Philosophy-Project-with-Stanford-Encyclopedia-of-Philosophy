Punitive Perspectives on Work and Non-Work\n\nWhile it is reasonable to champion daydreams and play as intrinsic\ngoods, idle time itself is often not felt as a good or luxury, but\ninstead a psychic imposition. This is why one speaks of \u201cdoing\ntime,\u201d when one is sentenced to a prison term or worse, to death\nrow (Moses 2007). Imprisonment is anathema to Indigenous,\nsocio-centric peoples in the Global South, and imprisonment is closely\nconnected to the disciplinary apparatus of western colonization of the\nAmericas and Africa (Nagel 2007). The birth of the western modern\nprison focused on self-discipline, known as the \u201cseparate\nsystem\u201d of Philadelphia, PA, leading to enforced isolation and\nseparate celling. Day-dreaming in a solitary cell becomes positively\ndangerous and suicides and mental illness increase exponentially\n(Casella et al. 2016). Idle time is thus countered by another\nprison regime, the Auburn, NY, factory system, also known as the\n\u201csilent system,\u201d where prisoners worked in a factory, but\nthey were forbidden to talk with each other. Under the notorious\nSouthern U.S. convict lease system, representing the shift \u201cfrom\nthe prison of slavery to the slavery of prisons\u201d (Davis 1998),\nBlack female and male prisoners were toiling in chain gangs, a\nvisceral legacy of chattel slavery. Slavery or indentured servitude is\ncodified in the U.S. Constitution, turning the nation-state into a\npenal democracy (James, 2007). \n\nAnother haunting reminder of chattel slavery is the neoliberal welfare\nstate\u2019s intrusion in the family, charging parents with poor work\nethic and neglect of their children. In the US, poor children of\ncolor, especially Black, Latine, and American Indians living on\nreservations, are at higher risk of being taken away from their kin\nand carers and turned over to the family regulation system (Goldberg\n2015). The world over, parents who are socially displaced such as\nRomanian immigrants in Norway, are under greater scrutiny by state\nactors, e.g., child protective services. In the U.S., social\nworkers\u2019 own white middle class (protestant) work ideology is\nenforced paradoxically on working-class mothers: these stigmatized\nwomen are summoned to comply with social programming, a penal version\nof the cult of domesticity and are thus effectively forced out of a\npaid job, made dependent on the good will of the social worker and\nfamily court judge, who may grant access to child-supervised visits.\nParents charged with child abuse and/or neglect are thus unable to\npursue education or a job, often creating an intergenerational cycle\nof the violence of poverty (Nagel 2018). In ideological terms, this is\ncoded as welfare dependency and racialized as a controlling image,\nthus stereotyping young Black mothers (Fraser and Gordon 1994; Hill\nCollins 2000). In response, the National Welfare Rights Organization\nwas created to destigmatize welfare by postulating it as a human right\n(Toney 2000) and by also demanding a basic income, as alternative to\npunitive welfare (Weeks 2011, 138). The proposal for universal basic\nincome has gained traction in recent years (Chatzidakis et\nal. 2020). Migrant workers, worker-mothers who serve as domestic\nworkers are also at risk (of deportation and/or imprisonment) for\nfacing frivolous neglect charges or simply for lacking proper visa\nstatus. Gendered moral economies operate across national, racial and\ngeographic borders in enforcing a domestic and domesticating\npatriarchal ideology and determining who is a good victim and deserves\nto be rescued (Keogh 2015; Nagel 2013; Guti\u00e9rrez\nRodr\u00edguez 2010; Grewal and Kaplan 1992; Kaplan et al.\n1999).\n\nStigmatized work such as erotic labor or sex work has divided\nfeminists into two camps: those who support sex workers\u2019 rights\nto organize and seek labor law protection and carceral feminists who\nadvocate \u201crescuing\u201d women trafficked into sex work\n(Bernstein 2007; Nagel 2015). Some sex worker rights approaches focus\non eschewing the moralizing rallying cry of choice versus coercion and\nseek to destigmatize such labor and offer a postcolonial critique of\nprohibitionist ideology (Kempadoo and Doezema 1995). Others also focus\non the lived experiences and agencies of such workers and\ncontextualize their lives within structural constraints of the\nfeminization of poverty (Dewey 2010; Zheng 2009). Paradoxically, by\nfocusing narrowly on income-generating activities, Dewey (2010)\ncontents that such advocates actually reinscribe stigmatization. And\nsome sex workers\u2019 rights organizations such as COYOTE\n(\u201cCall Off Your Old Tired Ethics\u201d) also inadvertently\nendorse a traditional work-ethic ideology by appealing to a moralizing\ndiscourse of respectability (Weeks 2011, pp. 67\u201368).\n",
