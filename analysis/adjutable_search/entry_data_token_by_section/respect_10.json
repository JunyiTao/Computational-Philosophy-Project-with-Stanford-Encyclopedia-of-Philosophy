For example, appeals to self-respect have been used to\nargue for, among many other things, the value of moral rights\n(Feinberg 1970), moral requirements or limits regarding forgiving\nothers or oneself (Dillon 2001; Holmgren 1998, 1993; Novitz 1998;\nHaber 1991; Murphy 1982), and both the rightness and wrongness of\npractices such as affirmative action. Such arguments rely on rather\nthan establish the moral importance of self-respect. Most philosophers\nwho attend to self-respect tend to treat it as important in one of two\nways, which are exemplified in the very influential work of Kant and\nJohn Rawls.\n\nKant argues that, just as we have a moral duty to respect others as\npersons, so we have a moral duty to respect ourselves as persons, a\nduty that derives from our dignity as rational beings. This duty\nrequires us to act always in an awareness of our dignity and so to act\nonly in ways that are consistent with our status as ends in ourselves\nand to refrain from acting in ways that abase, degrade, defile, or\ndisavow our rational nature. That is, we have a duty of moral\nrecognition self-respect. In The Metaphysics of Morals\n(1797), Kant argues for specific duties to oneself generated by the\ngeneral duty to respect humanity in our persons, including duties to\nnot engage in suicide, misuse of our sexual powers, drunkenness and\nother unrestrained indulgence of inclination, lying, self-deception,\navarice, and servility. Kant also maintains that the duty of\nself-respect is the most important moral duty, for unless there were\nduties to respect oneself, there could be no moral duties at all.\nMoreover, fulfilling our duty to respect ourselves is a necessary\ncondition of fulfilling our duties to respect other persons. Kant\nmaintains that we are always aware of our dignity as persons and so of\nour moral obligation to respect ourselves, and he identifies this\nawareness as a feeling of reverential respect for ourselves. This is\none of the natural capacities of feeling which we could have no duty\nto acquire but that make it possible for us to be motivated by the\nthought of duty. Reverence for self is, along with \u201cmoral\nfeeling,\u201d conscience, and love of others, a subjective source of\nmorality, and it is the motivational ground of the duty of\nself-respect. Kant also discusses evaluative self-respect, especially\nin Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and his Lectures\non Ethics (1779), as a combination of noble pride, which is the\nawareness that we have honored and preserved our dignity by acting in\nmorally worthy ways, and a healthy dose of humility, which is the\nawareness that we inevitably fall short of the lofty requirements of\nthe moral law. Kant regards well-grounded evaluative self-respect as a\nsubjective motivation to continue striving to do right and be\ngood.\n\nRawls, by contrast, views self-respect neither as something we are\nmorally required to have and maintain nor as a feeling we necessarily\nhave, but as an entitlement that social institutions are required by\njustice to support and not undermine. In A Theory of Justice\n(1971) he argues that self-respect (which he sometimes calls\n\u201cself-esteem\u201d is a \u201cprimary good,\u201d something\nthat rational beings want whatever else they want, because it is vital\nboth to the experienced quality of individual lives and to the ability\nto carry out or achieve whatever projects or aims an individual might\nhave. It is, moreover, a social good, one that individuals are able to\nacquire only under certain social and political conditions. Rawls\ndefines self-respect as including \u201ca person\u2019s sense of his\nown value, his secure conviction that his conception of the good, his\nplan of life, is worth carrying out,\u201d and it implies \u201ca\nconfidence in one\u2019s ability, so far as it is within one\u2019s\npower, to fulfill one\u2019s intentions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 440). He\nargues that individuals\u2019 access to self-respect is to a large\ndegree a function of how the basic institutional structure of a\nsociety defines and distributes the social bases of self-respect,\nwhich include the messages about the relative worth of citizens that\nare conveyed in the structure and functioning of institutions, the\ndistribution of fundamental political rights and civil liberties,\naccess to the resources individuals need to pursue their plans of\nlife, the availability of diverse associations and communities within\nwhich individuals can seek affirmation of their worth and their plans\nof life from others, and the norms governing public interaction among\ncitizens. Since self-respect is vital to individual well-being, Rawls\nargues that justice requires that social institutions and policies be\ndesigned to support and not undermine self-respect. Rawls argues that\nthe principles of justice as fairness are superior to utilitarian\nprinciples insofar as they better affirm and promote self-respect for\nall citizens.\n\nRawls\u2019s view that the ability of individuals to respect\nthemselves is heavily dependent on their social and political\ncircumstances has been echoed by a number of theorists working in\nmoral, social, and political philosophy. For example, Margalit (1996)\nargues that a decent society is one whose institutions do not\nhumiliate people, that is, give people good reason to consider their\nself-respect to be injured (but see Bird 2010). Honneth\u2019s theory\nof social criticism (1995) focuses on the way people\u2019s\nself-respect and self-identity necessarily depend on the recognition\nof others and so are vulnerable to being misrecognized or ignored both\nby social institutions and in interpersonal interactions. Some\ntheorists have used the concept of self-respect to examine the\noppression of women, people of color, gays and lesbians, and other\ngroups that are marginalized, stigmatized, or exploited by the\ndominant culture, identifying the plethora of ways in which oppressive\ninstitutions, images, and actions can do damage to the self-respect of\nmembers of these groups. Other writers discuss ways that individuals\nand groups might preserve or restore self-respect in the face of\ninjustice or oppression, and the ways in which the development of\nself-respect in individuals living under oppression or injustice\nempowers them to participate in the monumental struggles for justice\nand liberation (for example, Babbitt 2000, 1993; Bartky 1990a, 1990b,\n1990c; Basevich 2022; Boxill 1992, 1976; Boxill and Boxill 2015;\nCollins 1990; Dillon 2021, 1997, 1995; Diller 2001; Hay 2013, 2011;\nHolberg 2017; Ikuenobe 2004; Khader 2021; Meyers 1989, 1986; Mohr\n1992, 1988; Moody-Adams 1992\u201393; Seglow 2016; Statman 2002;\nThomas 2001b, 1983a, 1978\u201379; Weber 2016). Some theorists,\nespecially those working within a feminist framework, have argued that\nthe prevailing conceptions of self-respect in Kantian theory or in\ncontemporary liberal societies themselves contain features that\nreflect objectionable aspects of the dominating culture, and they have\nattempted to reconceive self-respect in ways that are more conducive\nto empowerment and emancipation (for example, Borgwald 2012, Dillon\n1992c).\n\nIn moral philosophy, theorists have also focused on connections\nbetween self-respect and various virtues and vices, such as self-trust\n(Borgwald 2012; Govier 1993), justice (Bloomfield 2011), honesty\n(Mauri 2011), benevolence (Andrew 2011), humility (Dillon 2020, 2015;\nGrenberg 2010), self-forgiveness (Dillon 2001; Holmgren 1998; Novitz\n1998), self-improvement (Johnson 2011), general immorality (Bagnoli\n2009; Bloomfield 2008), and arrogance (Dillon 2022, 2021, 2015, 2007,\n2003).\n",
