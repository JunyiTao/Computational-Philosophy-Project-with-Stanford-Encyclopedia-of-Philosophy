This question has to do with what is\ncommonly called \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d, a central concept\nin health care law and ethics, and increasingly an independent topic\nof philosophical inquiry.\n\nDecisional capacity can be defined as the ability of subjects to make\ntheir own medical decisions. Somewhat similar questions of capacity\narise in other contexts, such as capacity to stand trial in a court of\nlaw and the ability to make decisions that relate to personal care and\nfinances. However, the history behind the more general legal notions\nof capacity to stand trial and capacity to manage one\u2019s life is\ndifferent and operates somewhat differently in law (Roth, Meisel,\n& Litz 1977; Zapf & Roesch 2005). For the purposes of this\ndiscussion the notion of decisional capacity will be limited to\nmedical contexts only; most notably, those where decisions to consent\nor to refuse treatment or participation in clinical research are\nconcerned.\n\nThis makes sense given that the current notion of decisional capacity\nin health care arose with, and remains closely tied to, the doctrine\nof informed consent. Informed consent is both a moral concept and a\nlegal practice that arose in the second half of the twentieth century\nin response to the widespread paternalism of physicians and clinical\nresearchers. It was only once patients and research subjects began to\nbe involved in making their own decisions that it became clear to many\nthat some sort of fair, formal method was needed for distinguishing\nbetween those who can make their own decisions (and so ought to be\nallowed to) and those who can\u2019t make their own decisions (and so\nshould not be expected to) (Kim 2010: 11\u201314).\n\nIt is fairly obvious that some individuals cannot make their own\ndecisions: persons who are unconscious (temporarily or permanently),\nindividuals with severe brain damage, infants and very small children,\nthose who are born with severe cognitive impairment, and those in the\nadvanced stages of dementia. We do these individuals no favor by\npretending that they can decide for themselves. Instead, we must try\nto look out for these vulnerable individuals in our midst, and to the\nextent possible, ensure that their perspectives are taken into account\nin making decisions for them (Silvers & Francis 2009). But these\nare the \u201ceasy\u201d cases. The more difficult task is to\ndevelop a fair and consistent notion of decisional capacity that\napplies to the more subtle cases, the ones in which individuals have\nsome but not all of the mental capacities of ordinary adult agents. It\nis a moral failure if we say of someone who lacks decisional capacity\nthat she has it, for then we fail to protect someone who genuinely\ncannot decide for herself. But it is also a serious moral failure to\nsay of someone who has decisional capacity that she lacks it, for we\nthen deprive someone of a very important moral power: the power to\ndirect her own life through making her own decisions (Buchanan &\nBrock 1989: 40\u201341; Kim 2010: 1). Those who tackle the issue of\ncapacity face moral danger of various types, and there is no easy way\nto avoid all moral pitfalls all the time.\n\nDespite the dangers, theoretical questions about decisional capacity\nremain extremely important because they have huge practical\nimplications. Indeed, it is the combined theoretical and practical\nnature of decisional capacity that makes it so intellectually\ncompelling to philosophers who write about it. But this is still\nlargely uncultivated philosophical territory. One reason is the highly\ninterdisciplinary and rapidly changing nature of the field. Clinical\nmethods and tests to assess capacity are proliferating even as\ndisagreements remain about whether these instruments track what is\ntruly important. Philosophers have much to contribute, but they must\ntread carefully if their contributions are to be timely and\nrelevant.\n", "toc": [{"#Term": "1.

Terminology\n1.1 \u201cCompetence\u201d or \u201cCapacity\u201d?\n\nAs defined above the term \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d refers to\nthe ability of subjects to make medical decisions; primarily,\ndecisions to consent to or refuse medical intervention. Yet somewhat\nsurprisingly, (at least for those new to the topic) there is a large\namount of disagreement over terminology in this area, particularly\nover whether \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d and its shortened\nversion, \u201ccapacity\u201d are the right terms to use. The other\ncandidate is \u201cmental competence\u201d or just\n\u201ccompetence\u201d for short. Disputes about how (if at all)\nthese terms differ can be very confusing and sadly there is no remedy\nother than familiarity with the various things people have said.\n\nOne potential problem with the term \u201ccompetence\u201d is that\nin other areas of law it is used more widely to refer to capacities\nthat go beyond those deemed significant in medical contexts. For\nexample, in criminal law, competence to stand trial usually requires\nknowing the difference between right and wrong. But such knowledge is\nnot part of competence (or capacity) for medical decisions.\n\nAlso relevant is the fact that the law (again in other non-medical\nareas) often seeks to make global assessments of a\nperson\u2019s decision-making abilities. For example, a global\ndetermination of incompetence to manage one\u2019s affairs may lead\nto one person losing a wide range of personal freedoms. It would\ntypically result in a family member or guardian being appointed to\nlook out for that individual\u2019s finances, living arrangements\netc. In short, a great many decisions are now off limits for that\nindividual. But in medical contexts, such global assessments are no\nlonger thought to be appropriate. Instead, the focus is supposed to be\non particular decisions (see decision relativity in\n \u00a75.2).\n Thus an individual can be deemed capable of making one decision, but\nnot another. \n\nNonetheless, some version of legal/medical divide is often appealed to\nas part of explaining the difference between competence and capacity.\nOne common explanation begins by focusing on who makes the\ndetermination: a clinician or a judge. It is said that a\nclinical assessment is a determination of \u201cdecisional\ncapacity\u201d, whereas \u201ccompetence\u201d refers to a legal\nassessment (Ganzini et al. 2005: S101). Yet despite the popularity of\nthis way of carving things up, the distinction breaks down in\npractice. On the one hand, clinicians who assess decisional capacity,\noften make assessments that effectively carry the weight of a legal\njudgment, even though the courts are not involved (Grisso &\nAppelbaum 1998: 11; Kim 2010: 17). Indeed, such assessments typically\nhave legal authority until or unless challenged in a court. On the\nother hand, these days many judges confronting particular cases of\nmedical decision-making restrict their focus to questions about the\nability of the patient to make the decision at hand.\n\nEven so, in some legal jurisdictions, like Britain, the term\n\u201ccapacity\u201d (or \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d) is\nusually taken to be a legal one (Tan & Elphick 2002). On the other\nhand, in the United States, it is the terminology of\n\u201ccompetence\u201d (or \u201cmental competence\u201d) that is\noften said to carry legal connotations and authority (Buchanan 2004;\nBerg, Appelbaum, & Grisso 1996). None of this is very helpful,\nsince as soon as we switch jurisdictions or engage in comparative\nwork, terms change.\n\nOne well-known text in this area solves the problem by developing a\nnew hybrid term. In their book, Deciding for Others, Allen\nBuchanan and Dan Brock write that, \u201ccompetence is competence\nfor some task, competence to do something\u201d\n(Buchanan & Brock 1989: 84; emphasis in original). They then\nspecify their own focus, which is \u201ccompetence to make a\ndecision\u201d (Ibid). This leads to a lengthy discussion of\nwhat the authors call \u201cdecision-making competence\u201d and its\nstandards, as well as the specific \u201cdecision-making\ncapacities\u201d that are said to underlie what they call\n\u201cdecisional competence\u201d. According to this strategy, the\nintroduction of a new term\u2014\u201cdecisional competence\u201d\nis the proposed solution. Unfortunately, this stipulative solution\narguably compounds rather than simplifies the problem, since it is\nmore common to speak of \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d than\n\u201cdecisional competence\u201d.\n\nThomas Grisso and Paul Appelbaum, in their landmark study,\nCompetence to Consent to Treatment, adopt yet a further\napproach. They explain:\n\n\n\u2026we talk of \u201cdecision-making capacities\u201d when we\nrefer to the abilities related to decisions. We use the term\n\u201ccompetence\u201d, however, to denote the state in which a\npatient\u2019s decision-making capacities are sufficiently intact for\ntheir decisions to be honored (and conversely for incompetence)\nregardless of who makes the determination. (Grisso & Appelbaum\n1998: 11)\n\n\nIn general, within the narrower realm of medical decision-making\n(which we take to include decisions to participate in clinical\nresearch) the two terms are roughly interchangeable or should be. For\nthis reason, many writers adopt the policy of using the terms\ninterchangeably while signaling recognition that this breaks with\ncertain conventions. This usually is done by adding a minor proviso or\ncaveat at the beginning of a discussion to that effect (Charland 2002:\n37 note 1; Checkland 2001: 53, note 2; National Bioethics Advisory\nCommission 1998: Ch 1, note 4). The strategy has the virtue of\navoiding the cumbersome repeated substitution of one term for the\nother in or across discussions where both are used. But it can also\ninadvertently perpetuate confusion of just the sort it is meant to\nobviate. For the rest of this entry the terms will be used\ninterchangeably.\n\nUltimately, what is most important is for readers to be aware of all\nthis terminological confusion and tread carefully. The rule of thumb\nremains: caveat emptor.\n1.2 Descriptive vs. Prescriptive\n\nWhatever term one settles on, it is also important to be aware that\nthese terms can be, and often are used in both descriptive as well as\nprescriptive or normative senses. As one commentator explains: \n\n\na psychiatrist may give expert testimony, in his capacity as a trained\nobserver, about a person\u2019s competence seen as a factual matter,\nand the judge may or may not give this testimony practical effect in\ndeciding how we ought to treat that person. (Freedman 1981: 55) \n\n\nIn this example, the first claim addresses the issue whether the\nindividual is decisionally capable. The second claim\naddresses the issue whether the individual should be\nconsidered decisionally capable, i.e., whether she ought to be allowed\nto make her own decisions and have these honored. In many contexts, if\na person is thought to have capacity (to factually possess certain\nrelevant mental abilities) the normative implications simply follow as\na matter of course. But as the example above reminds us, this is not\nalways the case. In some contexts, for example in courts, the person\nwho determines the facts about ability may not be the same person who\nissues the normative conclusion.\n\nThe distinction is particularly important to keep in mind in light of\nthe fact that there are ongoing debates about what capacity\nis\u2014debates that occur at various theoretical levels. At the\nfirst and most abstract level, we may be interested in clarifying our\nconcept or theory of decision-making capacity. To do\nthis we may ask what exactly it is that we are trying to do when we\nsort people into competent and incompetent. Asking such foundational\nquestions may help us get clearer about the work we need a concept or\ntheory of capacity to do. Closely related to debates about\nconcept/theory are debates about standards. At this level we\nask: what sorts of things should someone who has capacity in our\ndefined sense be able to do? What specific abilities are the right\nones to consider in light of the work the concept does? The most\ncommonly accepted standards are outlined in\n \u00a74\n below. As we will see, some theorists believe that this list of\nstandards is incomplete, in the sense that someone could satisfy these\nstandards and yet fail to satisfy our basic concept of capacity.\nFinally, there are specific tests or instruments developed to\ndetermine whether or not (and to what extent) a particular individual\nsatisfies the standards (Buchanan & Brock 1989). Confusion enters\nin because both empirical and normative claims can and do occur at all\nof these levels. Suppose, for example, that you examine A using\na particular instrument, and then declare on that basis that A\nhas the capacity to make decision X. And suppose I reject your\nclaim, i.e., I refuse to give normative force to your descriptive\nclaim. There may be several different reasons for this. I may doubt\nthat you used the instrument properly. Or I may doubt that the\ninstrument, even when used properly, is a good measure of whether\nsomeone meets the appropriate standards. Finally, I may simply think\nthat the operative theory or concept underlying the standards is\nincomplete\u2014that to truly determine capacity in a way that would\nlicense the normative conclusions, we need to consider more than just\nthe articulated standards.\n2. Moral Origins\n\nThe origins of our contemporary concept of decisional capacity lie in\na varied configuration of historical developments in health care law\nand ethics that accompany the rise of the doctrine of informed\nconsent. According to the most well developed and widely accepted\naccount of this doctrine, the moral purpose of requiring informed\nconsent in certain contexts is to promote and protect the autonomy of\npatients and research subjects (Faden & Beauchamp 1986). It is\ncommonly observed that respect for autonomy \n\n\nflows from the recognition that all persons have unconditional worth,\neach having the capacity to determine his or her own moral destiny.\n(Beauchamp & Childress 2001: 63\u20134). \n\n\nTo respect autonomy means that, \n\n\nwe have a fundamental obligation to ensure that patients have the\nright to choose, as well as the right to accept or decline\ninformation. (Beauchamp & Childress 2001: 63) \n\n\nOf course, the obligation to allow people to choose is only an\nobligation where the individuals in question can meaningfully be said\nto choose for themselves. Thus the need to define decisional capacity\nenters as soon as we try to define the scope of this obligation.\n\nTypically, in order to be deemed legally and ethically valid an\nindividual\u2019s consent must be properly informed and free of\nexternal coercion (Faden & Beauchamp 1986). Given that in most\nmedical contexts there is a huge asymmetry in possession of knowledge,\ndisclosure is usually required to ensure that the subject is informed,\nand is often listed as a requirement. Against this backdrop decisional\ncapacity is often thought of as a fourth requirement of validity. Thus\nmany health care professionals think of informed consent in terms of a\nfour-part checklist:\n\nSubject must have decisional-capacity.\nAll relevant information must be disclosed to the subject.\nThe subject must understand what has been conveyed.\nThe subject makes a voluntary choice either accepting or refusing\nwhat has been offered or proposed. \n\n\nPhilosophers might naturally suppose that moral theorizing about\ninformed consent would lead to and shape a theory of decisional\ncapacity. After all, if the point of informed consent is to enable and\npromote autonomous decision-making, one might naturally suppose that\nthe task is to distinguish those who can actually make autonomous\ndecisions from those who cannot. This, in turn, would require a more\ndetailed account of what goes into an autonomous decision. However,\nthis is not what one finds in the literature, and for good reason. To\nbegin with, to take such ideas seriously one would have to have an\nindependent theory of autonomous decision-making that was concrete\nenough to guide practice, i.e., the development of tests and\ninstruments. But philosophical theories of autonomy are, at least\ncurrently, far too abstract for this purpose. Moreover they are\ntypically far too demanding (i.e., they appear to count far too many\ndecisions as\n non-autonomous).[1]\n So, interestingly, although many philosophers and bioethicists\ncontinue to equate decisional capacity and the capacity for autonomous\ndecision-making, it is really not true that our current notion of\ndecisional capacity has been derived from the notion of\nautonomous decision-making. Instead, the current notion of decisional\ncapacity has been built from the ground up, largely (though not\nentirely) independently of philosophical theory. And this means that\nit is an open question whether a competent decision is an autonomous\ndecision.\n3. Moral Caution: What Follows from Incapacity?\n\nAlthough the topic of this entry is primarily the nature of\ndecision-making capacity, it is worth pausing briefly to comment on\nwhat morally follows from a declaration of incapacity. If a patient is\ndeemed incapable of making a particular decision, then someone else\n(usually a family member) will be designated to make it for her. If\nthe patient was refusing what others take to be beneficial treatment,\nthen a finding of incompetence means that the treatment could\nbe forced on the patient if a surrogate deems this best. However,\nwhile it is true that when a person is incompetent to make a decision,\nthis means that the final authority for decisions will lie elsewhere,\nthis doesn\u2019t automatically mean that the patient\u2019s current\nwishes, values, preferences etc. are of no importance or that they\nneed not be considered in making decisions for the patient. Many\nincompetent patients clearly have strong desires that should be\naccommodated, at least when doing so will not otherwise cause\nproblems. Given the strong link between well-being and what a person\ncares about, it is imperative for caretakers to at least consider what\nthe patient currently wants.\n\nSecond, although it is possible to force treatment on a patient if she\nis deemed to lack capacity, this does not mean that it is always\nadvisable to do so. There are many downsides to coercive treatment\nthat need to be considered. Treatment might not be effective if the\npatient is uncooperative. It may also be important in the case of\nchronic mental illnesses to maintain trust with a patient who will\nlikely need care again in the future. It may be that once these facts\nare taken into account, a treatment that seemed clearly beneficial\nwill not be so.\n\nA slightly different point concerns globally incompetent patients.\nDespite the emphasis in the field on treating DMC as\ndecision-relative, there are, of course, some patients who because of\nmore extreme impairments are unable to make all or almost all of their\nown medical decisions. In the case of globally incompetent patients\nwho once were competent and who wrote advance directives, it is\nusually assumed that the directive comes into force once the patient\nreaches this state (Appelbaum 2007; Krohm & Summers 2002).\nHowever, this simple assumption has been powerfully challenged. For\nexample, Jaworska (1999) has argued that many patients with mid-stage\nAlzheimer\u2019s dementia retain the capacity to value (they remain,\nin her words, \u201cvaluers\u201d), even though increasing confusion\nand forgetfulness about facts may mean that they no longer count as\ncompetent to make their own treatment decisions (because they fail\nunderstanding and reasoning). Jaworska argues that although such\npatients lack decision-making capacity, they are not yet at the point\nwhere their advance directives have the greatest authority. Their\ncurrently held values are still much more relevant to decisions made\nfor them. In short, Jaworska draws attention to the fact that\nvarious significant capacities of persons can come\napart. We usually value decision-making capacities like\nunderstanding and reasoning because these enable us to pursue\nour valued ends. But Jaworska underscores the fact that a person may\ncontinue to have currently valued ends even when she has lost the\nabilities needed for pursuing them effectively. In these cases, rather\nthan revert to an advanced directive, Jaworska thinks we should\n(within reason) aim to help such patients pursue the ends they are no\nlonger able to pursue on their own.\n4. Elements of Capacity\n\nDespite the fact that aspects of the concept of decisional capacity\nremain unspecified and undeveloped, it is possible to identify some\nshared elements that all or almost all theorists agree must be part of\nthe picture. Four sub-capacities are most prominent. These are (1)\nChoice, (2) Understanding, (3) Appreciation, and (4) Reasoning. Some\ntheorists have also suggested the need for something like (5) Value or\nAbility to Value (discussed in\n \u00a76.1)\n and still others have posited the need for (6) Authenticity (also\ndiscussed in\n \u00a76.1).\n Below is a presentation of the most basic and agreed upon elements\nand an explanation of how these have come to be understood in\npractice.\n4.1 Choice\n\nChoice is short for \u201cthe ability to express or communicate\none\u2019s choice\u201d, and it is the simplest and least mental\nelement of capacity. Indeed, its simplicity and obviousness may\nexplain why some authors do not include it. To see that such an\nability is necessary one needs only to imagine a case where\nunderstanding, appreciation and reasoning are all intact, but where\nthe subject has no way to express or communicate her intended\ndecision. Unless a subject\u2019s preferred choice can be expressed\nto others in some outward way, it is impossible to know their intended\ndecision. This is not trivial, since some patients\u2014for example\nstroke victims or some patients with Locked-In Syndrome\u2014can have\nan active mental life and satisfy the first three conditions but are\nunable to express anything verbally or through gestures (e.g.,\nblinking the eyes, lifting a finger, etc.). This is why Grisso &\nAppelbaum (1998: 34\u201337) include it as one of the elements lack\nof which compromises capacity.\n4.2 Understanding\n\nThe most basic mental element is understanding (Buchanan\n& Brock 1989: 23). Obviously, in order to be capable of consenting\nto or refusing a given intervention, a subject must have some basic\nunderstanding of the facts involved in that decision. Yet this\napparently simple requirement can turn out to be rather complex\ndepending on how \u201cunderstanding\u201d itself is defined (Drane\n1985). Basic comprehension and knowledge or cognition of facts is one\nminimal interpretation (Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 37\u201342).\nHowever, most commentators recognize that this level of mental ability\nis not enough for generating the sort of medical decisions we are\nconcerned with. On the other hand, the standard cannot be set too high\nlest we rule too many people incompetent (see inclusivity\n \u00a75.1).\n4.3 Appreciation\n\nIn addition to understanding in the basic factual sense alluded to\nabove, most writers on capacity agree that subjects must also have\nsome appreciation of the nature and significance of the decision that\nthey are faced with (Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 42\u201352). The\nfacts, and the implications of those facts for the subject\u2019s\nlife, must mean something to the subject. The most minimal\nway of interpreting this requirement is to see it as requiring that\nthe subject not only grasp information but genuinely\nbelieve that it truly applies to him. The appreciation\nelement of capacity is sometimes held to derive from the legal\nrequirement that each subject must have \u201cinsight\u201d into the\ncircumstances of a given decision (Glass 1997).\n\nMany theorists stop at this minimal interpretation, but even this\nrequirement is significant, for it rules out certain kinds of patients\nwho are delusional, who can grasp what their doctor is saying to them,\nbut refuse to believe that anything their doctor says is true (Grisso\n& Appelbaum 1998: 42\u201343). In addition, in order to apply\nthis requirement, clinicians must be able to distinguish between cases\nwhere patients refuse to believe doctors for doctrinal or cultural\nreasons\u2014for example a Christian Scientist who believes that\ndespite what her doctor says only prayer can heal\u2014and cases\nwhere failure of appreciation results from losing touch with reality\n(Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 45\u201349). For example, imagine a\ncase in which an elderly demented woman clearly grasps the fact\nthat her surgeons wish to amputate her feet because her feet are\ngangrenous and they believe that she is in real danger of dying if\nthey do not amputate. But despite being able to state these facts back\nto her doctors, the woman, who seems confused and disoriented, says\nthings that reveal she does not really believe there is anything\nseriously wrong with her feet. For example, she talks about what she\nwill do once her feet are all healed. She may fail appreciation and so\nmay not be deemed competent to refuse the treatment (based on a case\ndescribed in Abernathy 1984).\n\nMore robustly, appreciation may be understood as going beyond just\nacceptance of, or belief in, the facts. Some theorists argue further\nthat appreciation involves being able to \n\n\nappreciate the nature and meaning of potential alternatives\u2014what\nit would be like and \u201cfeel\u201d like to be in possible future\nstates and to undergo various experiences\u2014and to integrate this\nappreciation into one\u2019s decision-making. (Buchanan & Brock\n1989: 24) \n\n\nHowever, there are no easy ways to determine when this deeper kind of\nappreciation is present. Moreover, contemporary psychology has shown\nus just how infrequent such appreciation of future scenarios is among\nmost people. Appreciating what a future option will feel like requires\nwhat psychologists call \u201caffective forecasting\u201d, and\nnumerous studies have shown that we are, most of us anyway, very poor\naffective forecasters (Ubel, Loewenstein, Hershey, et al. 2001;\nWilson, Wheatley, Meyers, et al. 2000; Gilbert, Gill & Wilson 2002; Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson, et al. 1998; Wilson, Meyers & Gilbert 2001; Wilson & Gilbert 2005; Ubel,\nLoewenstein, Schwarz, et. al 2005; Ubel, Loewenstein, &\nJepson 2005; on the relevance of this to capacity see Halpern &\nArnold 2008). But given this, if we were to require such deep\nappreciation we would again risk ruling too many people incompetent\n(see inclusivity\n \u00a75.1).\n4.4 Reasoning\n\nWithout the mental ability to engage in reasoning and manipulate\ninformation rationally, it is impossible for understanding and\nappreciation to issue in a decision (Buchanan & Brock 1989:\n24\u201325; Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 52\u201358). Interestingly,\nhowever, the concept of reasoning is often left vague in discussions\nof decisional capacity. Probably this is because insisting on too high\nand specific a normative standard of reasoning might risk ruling that\na majority of subjects lack capacity, which, again, risks ruling too\nmany people incompetent.\n\nYet normative standards of reasoning sometimes do get mentioned, for\nexample, consistency and the ability to derive conclusions from\npremises (Freedman 1981). More often reasoning is said to include the\nability to weigh risks and benefits and evaluate putative\nconsequences. Again, no specific normative criteria for success are\nspelled out. Difficult cases must therefore be assessed\nindividually.\n\nMost theorists seem to agree that possessing these four abilities, at\nleast to some degree, is necessary for capacity. The primary\nissue (explored further in\n \u00a76)\n is about whether the four abilities are always sufficient or\nwhether there are cases in which something else, some further\nabilities or some further feature of the subject\u2019s choice, might\nbe relevant to the assessment of capacity. The three elements most\ncommonly cited by critics are (1) the subject\u2019s emotions, (2)\nthe subject\u2019s values, and (3) the authenticity of a\nsubject\u2019s choice.\n5. Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One)\n\nThere are five important assumptions that underlie virtually all\ncontemporary work on decisional capacity and with which anyone\ninterested in the topic must be familiar. For ease of reference we\nhave named them: (1) inclusivity, (2) decision-relativity, (3)\nall-or-nothing assessment, (4) value neutrality, and (5) independence\nfrom diagnosis. These are supported both by ethical theory and by\nrequirements that law imposes on the ethics of informed consent. A\nsixth assumption, (6) asymmetry, is fairly widely accepted, but\ncontinues to be debated.\n5.1 Inclusivity\n\nThe inclusiveness constraint derives entirely from the needs of\npractice. No matter what theory of decisional capacity we develop, it\nmust turn out that most ordinary adults count as having capacity most\nof the time (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 21; Appelbaum 1998). In other\nwords, as a society we are morally committed to imposing minimal\nrestraints on individual choice. Most people are free to make most\nchoices in their lives for themselves, even including self-harming\nchoices. It would therefore be intolerable if our account of\ndecisional capacity in medicine were to differ significantly from that\nnorm, especially given that the doctrine of informed consent arose in\nthe context of a movement aiming to give greater decisional power to\npatients and research subjects. Thus, it is generally recognized that\nfailure of a theory to be inclusive enough would be sufficient by\nitself for rejecting an account of decisional capacity.\n5.2 Decision Relativity\n\nDecision relativity refers to the now almost universally accepted idea\nthat an individual\u2019s decisional capacity should be assessed\nrelative to a specific decision, at a particular time, in a particular\ncontext (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 18\u201320; Culver & Gert\n1990: 620; Zapf & Roesch 2005). The requirement issues from the\nvalue placed on freedom to choose, along with the recognition of\nseveral facts. First, not all decisions require the same level of\nmental ability. Understanding all the facts relevant to making\ndecision A might be much easier than understanding all the\nfacts relevant to making decision B. The idea is to allow\npeople to make the most use they can of the mental abilities they\nhave.\n\nIt is also important to note that decisional capacity can vary within\na single individual over time and in relation to what else is going\non. For example, medications can make people drowsy or confused, but\nbetween doses when the medication wears off individuals may be\nperfectly capable of making decisions. Similarly, someone with\nmoderate dementia may become more disoriented in unfamiliar\nsurroundings or in the presence of someone she does not know, and so\nbe less able to focus on a decision. Commitment to maximizing a\nperson\u2019s chance of deciding for herself means that we ought to\nbe sensitive to such factors and should try to assess capacity under\nthe most favorable conditions (Appelbaum 2007).\n\nThis emphasis on decision-relativity differs markedly from ideas\naccepted in an earlier era when decisional capacity was thought to\nextend globally over time and place, irrespective of context. Indeed,\nthis more global notion continues to be employed in some areas of law.\nOne illustration of the now widespread acceptance of decision\nrelativity in medicine is that certain tests once thought to be\nperfectly acceptable tests of decisional capacity are no longer deemed\nto be so. A case in point is the mini-mental state examination\n(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh 1975). This is a simple psychometric\ntool that was developed to help clinicians assess how disoriented (or\nnot) their patients are, by ranking patient responses to familiar\nquestions such as, \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d Some\nquestions also address basic perceptual and mental skills (Can you\ncount back from 100 subtracting 7 at a time?). Although extremely\npopular and still used as a rough assessment of orientation, it is now\nthought to be too global and general to serve as assessment of a\npatient\u2019s mental capacity to make treatment decisions. By law,\nassessment must now be more \u201ccase-specific\u201d and responsive\nto \u201csituational variations in demands\u201d (Grisso &\nAppelbaum 1998: 22).\n5.3 All-or-Nothing Assessment (Relative to a Particular Decision)\n\nA third assumption that pervades contemporary work on decisional\ncapacity is that for practical purposes, a ruling on capacity must be\nall-or-nothing: either the patient in question has decisional capacity\nor she lacks it. Of course, in many contexts there is an obvious sense\nin which we can speak meaningfully of \u201cdegrees\u201d of\ncapacity, for we are indeed measuring abilities that fall along a\nspectrum. However, in practice we need a judgment of a bivalent type.\nThis is because we need to know who has final decision-making\nauthority and there is no such thing as \u201csort of\u201d having\nauthority over a decision. If a patient has the capacity to make\ndecision X, then others must honor her choice even if they disagree\nwith it. But if she lacks capacity to make decision X, someone else, a\nguardian or surrogate will have to decide for her. To avoid\npotentially endless controversy and ensure the smooth operation of the\nhealthcare system, law and practice need a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d\nverdict about whether a person can make a particular decision for\nherself or not (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 27).\n5.4 Value Neutrality\n\nWhat we here call \u201cthe value neutrality constraint\u201d is a\nbit more complex, but its significance makes it important to explain\nclearly. Value neutrality refers to the idea that we need to leave\nroom for patients to make unusual or unpopular choices (Craigie 2013a:\n1). People vary greatly in their values and so, even when confronted\nwith similar situations, make very different kinds of choices. If the\nfreedom to decide for oneself is to be meaningful, we need to ensure\nthat individuals are not deemed to lack decisional capacity to make a\nchoice simply because they are choosing something others disapprove\nof. The worry is real. In the not-too-distant medical past, doctors\noften did assume incapacity and would therefore refuse to honor\npatient wishes whenever a patient rejected what the doctor saw as\nbeneficial treatment (Culver, Ferrell, & Green 1980: 587). Thus it\nseems important to find a way to distinguish competent though unusual\nchoices from choices that are unusual because incompetent\n(because arrived at by flawed or inadequate mental processes).\n\nConsider the decision to accept death rather than a certain form of\ntreatment. The desire to die can, of course, be a sign of mental\nillness in certain cases and so possibly a sign of incapacity\n(though merely being mentally ill doesn\u2019t make someone\nincompetent: see\n \u00a75.5).\n But it would be hugely problematic to view all refusals of\nlife-sustaining treatment as indicative of either mental illness or\ndecisional incapacity (or both!). Some people refuse life-sustaining\ntransfusion of blood for doctrinal religious reasons (Charland 2001:\n137). Others may choose death as a preferable alternative to\nsuffering. For example, a long-term dialysis patient who is not a\ncandidate for transplant may accept death as the only way to escape\nfrom an existence she finds unbearable. Such a choice is intelligible\neven if it is not the choice most dialysis patients make. In both the\nreligious case and the dialysis case the choice appears to reflect\nvalues that are not shared by all people. Yet disagreements about\nvalues, troubling though they may be, are not generally thought to be\nindicative of any lack of mental ability. Since death can be chosen by\ncompetent individuals as well as incompetent ones, many theorists have\nargued that we must look to something other than simply what is\nchosen to distinguish competent choice from incompetent\nchoice.\n\nIt is usually assumed that the only way to satisfy the requirement of\nvalue neutrality is to draw a sharp distinction between process and\noutcome (Freedman 1981; Buchanan & Brock, 1989: 50\u201351;\nBanner 2013: 1). On this view, capacity has more to do with the nature\nof the process whereby one arrives at a decision, rather than the\ncontent or outcome of the actual decision itself.\n\nClosely associated with this approach is a particular picture of what\nit is for a decision to be rational. This is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cinternal\u201d rationality, because it makes rationality a\nmatter of the internal relations between beliefs, values and\nparticular choices. It could also be called \u201cinstrumental\nrationality plus\u201d. On this view, there must be internal\nconsistency among the beliefs and values relevant to the decision at\nhand. In addition, an individual must be able to prioritize among her\n(decision-relevant) ends, and continue to update this priority ranking\nas circumstances change and evolve. And it requires (this is the\ninstrumental part) being able to recognize which of the options\navailable will best serve her ends. So consider again refusal of\nlife-saving transfusion based on adherence to religious doctrine. It\ncan be argued that, in such a case, the subject is decisionally\ncapable to refuse the transfusion as long as the decision is rational\naccording to internal reasons that he recognizes as his own, i.e., his\nchoice (refusing transfusion/accepting death) best serves his\nends (adherence to God\u2019s commands as his religion interprets\nthese), even if others find the choice puzzling.\n\nHowever, there remain some theorists who insist that there are cases\nin which irrationality is also a matter of outcome, of what one\nchooses. They resist the idea that we should focus exclusively on\nprocess when assessing capacity because of worries about particular\nkinds of cases. Consider the example of a subject who refuses\nelectroconvulsive therapy for a severe depression that has not\nresponded to any other forms of treatment. The patient refuses because\nof a deep fear of the procedure, even though she consented to it and\nbenefited from it at one point in the past (Culver, Ferrell, &\nGreen 1980; Culver & Gert 2004). In this case, given how harmful\nthe subject\u2019s choice may ultimately be to her, the decision not\nto accept the treatment seems problematic and, according to Culver\n& Gert, ought to be challenged. However, in order to say that this\npatient is not capable of refusing this treatment, it seems that we\nwould be forced to abandon a restricted focus on process. For it is\nmost likely true that the process by which she reaches the\ndecision is beyond reproach from the standpoint of internal\nrationality. Her current fear of the therapy is so great that she\nwould rather die than undergo the treatment. Even if one thinks this\nis a re-prioritization of values brought on by her fear (which would\nbe hard to establish), it remains true that currently she is\nreaching a decision consistent with what she currently cares\nmost about. And that is all that is required by internal rationality.\nYet Culver & Gert think such a choice should be grounds for\ndeclaring the patient incompetent. They think such a choice is\nirrational in a broader sense than allowed by internal\nrationality.\n\nLike other theorists of capacity, Culver & Gert acknowledge the\nmoral importance of avoiding any approach to capacity assessment that\nresults in doctors being able to declare a patient incompetent\nwhenever a patient refuses a recommended treatment. But they think\nthere are ways to avoid this problem without recourse to the strong\npolicy of focusing exclusively on the processes leading up to a\ndecision. They suggest instead that we can appeal to a general notion\nof how \u201cmost reasonable people would judge\u201d.\n\nAlthough the problems raised by the ECT case are real, many theorists\nthink that the solution offered by Culver & Gert is deeply\nproblematic. Relying on what many people view as rational (in some\nbroad, non-internal sense of rational) or on what many people view as\n\u201ca significant harm\u201d will not offer sufficient protection\nfor competent adults with unusual values. If our goal is to ensure\nthat mentally intact individuals are free to pursue their own\nidiosyncratic and at times unpopular values, then we must avoid\nbuilding into our account of capacity any specific requirements on\nchoice. Culver & Gert may be right that their proposal would allow\nthem to handle religious cases properly, since many people these days\nrecognize the existence of religious diversity and the need to\ntolerate certain religiously motivated choices, particularly if those\nchoices primarily affect the subject making the choice. But it is not\nat all clear that their view could handle the dialysis case mentioned\nearlier. When precisely does the refusal of further life-saving\ntreatment make sense? How much suffering is too much? Deep continuing\ndisagreements about the proper answer to such questions suggests that\nit would not be safe to build any particular answer into our notion of\ncompetence. To do so is to risk allowing majority values to limit the\nfree choice of others in inappropriate ways by ruling too many people\nincompetent for the wrong reasons.\n\nThese days clinicians and others working in clinical settings take it\nas axiomatic that \n\n\nclinicians should not conclude that patients lack decision-making\ncapacity just because they make a decision contrary to medical advice.\n(Ganzini 2005: S101) \n\n\nMoreover, discussions of capacity assessment tend to assume (contra\nCulver & Gert) that the only safe way to avoid this problem (the\nproblem of equating disagreement with incapacity) is to focus\nexclusively on how patients reach a decision. So although\nphilosophers may still see issues to be explored further, for now the\nclinical realm views these issues as resolved. It is taken for granted\nthat the need to maintain value neutrality is real, and that\nthe way to do this is to adopt an exclusively process-oriented\napproach to capacity assessment.\n5.5 Independence from Diagnosis\n\nJust as it is usually assumed that a patient cannot be declared\nincompetent simply on the basis of her (perhaps unusual) values,\nsimilarly a patient cannot be declared incompetent simply on the basis\nof her diagnosis. For obvious reasons this is most relevant for\npatients with mental illnesses or cognitive impairments, where there\nis a history of assuming that all such patients are globally\nincompetent (Kim 2010: 11). Historically this resulted in large losses\nof freedom for many individuals.\n\nToday it is generally assumed that the diagnosis itself does not mean\na person is\n incompetent.[2]\n Rather, we must look to see if in fact the mental illness (or the\ncognitive impairment) is undermining decision-making capacity for a\nparticular individual and in relation to a particular decision.\nClinicians look for the same features that are supposedly relevant for\nordinary patients: understanding, appreciation, and reasoning, as\ndescribed above (Whiting 2015). This has the result that while some\npatients with a psychiatric diagnosis or a cognitive impairment are\ndeemed incompetent to make some decisions, many are deemed competent\nto make at least some decisions and still others may be deemed\ncompetent to make all of their own decisions. This has had the result\nthat these patient groups have much greater input into their own\ntreatment than in previous eras. Arguably, it has also helped to\ndecrease somewhat the stigma of mental illness and cognitive\nimpairment.\n5.6 Risk and Symmetry\n\nPart of what is involved in reasoning about a particular course of\naction and reaching a decision is weighing the risks and benefits\nassociated with the likely consequences of proposed options. In health\ncare contexts where consent is at issue, this normally amounts to a\ndecisional problem that is framed in symmetrical terms: either one\nconsents to a given treatment option, or one refuses that same option.\nThis way of framing things seems to assume that both poles of the\ndecision are symmetrical and that mental capacity necessarily remains\nfixed as one evaluates the two options. Yet this is an assumption that\ncan be philosophically challenged.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that consent and refusal to the same proposed\nintervention should not always be treated symmetrically, by which it\nis meant that an individual could sometimes be competent to consent to\na treatment that she is not competent to refuse. The reasoning is that\nthe risks respectively associated with consenting to or refusing\ntreatment are not always the same. From this it is inferred that the\ndecisions are not the same and that therefore, decisions to consent or\nrefuse the very same treatment should not automatically be\ntreated symmetrically.\n\nTo see what is at stake consider a case where a patient is refusing a\nlow risk treatment that is highly beneficial for those with her\ncondition. And suppose as well that the patient will die without it.\nOf course, it is always true of any patient in any situation that she\nmight make a mistake, i.e., a judgment that does not really serve her\ninterests even as she understands them. But in this case if refusal is\na mistake it is a mistake with much worse consequences for the\npatient. Since in this case the harms associated with mistaken refusal\nare much greater than the harms associated with mistaken consent, the\nlevel of competence required to refuse can legitimately be set higher.\n\n\nThere have been substantial debates over the symmetricality question\n(Brock 1991; Buller 2001; Cale 1999; Checkland 2001; Skene 1991;\nWicclair 1991, 1999; Wilks 1997, 1999). A key feature of the debate is\nwhether or not mental capacity should be considered a fixed mental\ncommodity (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 60). In other words, relative to\na particular yes-or-no decision such as the one described above,\nshould we articulate a single threshold (a certain level or degree of\nunderstanding, appreciation, etc. that the patient must have) such\nthat any patient above the threshold should be free to either consent\nor refuse? Or is it better to view such a choice as two different\ndecisions and so articulate two different thresholds, one for\nacceptance and one for refusal, setting the threshold higher for those\npatients inclined to refuse?\n\nThose who are skeptical of this approach point out that it is highly\ncounterintuitive to say that mental capacity can vary\naccording to external circumstances. Moreover, as some critics claim,\n\n\n\nOne point of determining whether a person is competent to make a\ndecision about medical treatment is to allow a competent patient to\nmake any decisions he wants regarding that kind of treatment. (Culver\n& Gert 1990: 620; Culver & Gert 2004) \n\n\nIn a way, it is true that abilities don\u2019t change simply because\nthe risks of exercising them do. To illustrate with a simple,\nnon-medical analogy, consider a cooking student who has learned to\nmake a perfect omelet and now succeeds in making one nine out of ten\nattempts. This is her current ability level and it does not change\neven if the consequences of failure change. In one case, perhaps,\nfailure simply means she has no omelet, but only scrambled eggs, for\nbreakfast, whereas in another case failure to make the omelet properly\nmight cost her admission to chef school. But the odds of failure are\nthe same in each case: 1 in 10. In effect those who favor an\nasymmetrical requirement think that it is fair to require a higher\nlevel of ability (and so a lower chance of failure) when the negative\nconsequences of failure are higher. And this does seem to be about\nprotection rather than ability per se.\n\nHowever, the moral rationale for the approach appeals to a more\ngeneral, overarching rationale for assessing capacity in the first\nplace (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 51). The claim is that we assess\ncapacity because we recognize the need to strike a balance between two\ndistinct and potentially conflicting values. On the one hand, as a\nsociety we place a very high value on personal autonomy and free\nchoice. But if that was our only societal value we would not bother to\nassess capacity but would simply honor any choice that a patient made\n(as long as she could express it). That we don\u2019t do this\ndemonstrates that we also clearly value patient welfare and recognize\nthat as mental capacities become more and more compromised the risk to\nwelfare posed by free choice increases. From the start then, setting\nthresholds for decision-making capacity is an exercise in trying to\nstrike the right balance between giving people as much freedom as\npossible while protecting the most vulnerable among us.\n\nThe asymmetrical approach to decisions simply extends this basic\nidea\u2014this desire to balance concern for autonomy and protection\nof welfare\u2014further. Once we recognize that choosing one way can\nplace welfare at much greater risk than choosing the other way, it\nmakes sense to strike the autonomy-welfare balance differently for\neach prong of the choice. Since welfare is more at risk in one case\nthan the other, we set the threshold for selecting that option higher\n(thereby slightly reducing the chance that the subject will be free to\nmake it). But since welfare is not at risk in the other case, the\nthreshold remains low, to maximize the chance that the patient will be\nfree to make that choice if she is inclined to.\n6. Are We Measuring the Right Thing?\n\nAs indicated earlier, there are two slightly different questions\ntheorists might have in mind when they ask: \u201cAre we measuring\nthe right thing?\u201d On the one hand, one might be asking whether a\nparticular instrument developed to help clinicians assess capacity is\nempirically valid. Or (closely related), one might be asking whether a\nparticular empirically valid instrument developed in one context, is\napplicable in a different legal context. On the other hand, one might\nbe asking a deeper question about whether the underlying standards\nwhich inspired the development of the instrument, and which the\ninstrument supposedly tracks, are really themselves adequate. In\nshort, the second question challenges the underlying framework itself,\nasking whether we ought to be considering things that it\nfails to capture. Here, the first sort of question will be considered\nbriefly before turning to the second. \n\nAt this point in time, the most widely used instrument is the MacCAT-T\n(Grisso, Appelbaum, & Hill-Fotouhi 1997). It reflects the most\nwidely influential theory of competence to date, that of Grisso and\nAppelbaum (1998). At the core of this theory are the same four\nabilities mentioned in\n \u00a74\n of this entry: the ability to communicate a choice, the ability to\nunderstand, the ability to appreciate, and the ability to reason.\nHowever, Grisso and Appelbaum (1998) develop detailed specifications\nfor how these four abilities should be interpreted. We shall call the\nview of competence defined in terms of these four abilities as\ninterpreted by Grisso and Appelbaum the \u201cfour-abilities\nmodel\u201d. The MacCAT-T is an instrument designed to help\nclinicians quickly and efficiently assess competence according to the\nfour-abilities model. Thus to ask if the MacCAT-T is empirically valid\nis to ask whether it is good at detecting the presence of the four\nabilities as specified by the model and whether it is good at\nmeasuring the degree to which a patient possesses them. A great deal\nof research has been done on the MacCAT-T, and at this point the\ngeneral consensus appears to be that the MacCAT-T is empirically valid\nin this narrow sense.\n\nA slightly different question is about whether the MacCAT-T can be\napplied in different legal contexts. The legal history in the United\nStates, Canada, and Great Britain has many common roots, and because\nof this many people assume that the same criteria apply in these\ndifferent regions. However, it is not always obvious that this is so.\nIn 2005 The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) was passed in England and Wales\nthat, at least on the surface, seems to embrace different criteria\nfrom the ones listed above. The MCA criteria are (1) understanding,\n(2) retaining, (3) using, and (4) weighing and communicating (see\nMental Capacity Act in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Some researchers have concluded that, for all practical purposes,\nthis is the same model. They take \u201cusing\u201d to cover\nappreciation (since one does not use information one does not fully\naccept) and \u201cweighing\u201d to cover reasoning (which is often\nunderstood as the ability to weigh and compare options). But as of now\nthere is no real consensus. Viewing the two sets of criteria as\nequivalent is, of course, convenient, since then one can make use of\nthe broader English-language literature on capacity assessment without\nworries about whether it strictly applies to one\u2019s own legal\ncontext. For example, based on the assumption that the two models are\nbasically equivalent, some researchers in England have conducted\nempirical studies of capacity in specific populations of patients\nusing the MacCAT-T (Owen, Szmukler, et al. 2009; Owen, Szmukler, et\nal. 2013).\n\nOf course, the MacCAT-T is only one of many instruments that have been\ndeveloped to assess capacity (Etchells et al. 1999; S. Welie 2001;\nVellinga et al. 2004; Dunn et al. 2006; Kim 2010: 61\u201365) and all\nsuch instruments must be assessed for empirical validity, namely the\nextent to which they successfully track and measure the properties\nthey claim to track and measure. However, questions of empirical\nvalidity, though obviously important, are generally of less interest\nto philosophers. The more interesting questions arise when we consider\nthe adequacy of the underlying theory a particular instrument is based\nupon. That means that in the case of the MacCAT-T, the deeper,\ninteresting question is whether the four abilities model as specified\nby Grisso and Appelbaum captures everything important about\ndecision-making capacity. Since to date the four abilities model has\nbeen the most influential model by far, the following discussion\nfocuses on it.\n\nAt the origin of any theory of capacity, there lies a set of paradigm\nexamples around which the theory is built and which it must account\nfor. Thus, in the initial instance, a theory is built around a\nselection of paradigm examples of what capacity and incapacity should\nbe taken to be. The criticisms examined below all appeal to cases that\nthe critics take to be obvious examples of incapacity, but which the\nfour abilities model seems to classify as cases of capacity. Most\ntheorists seem to agree that possessing the four abilities, at least\nto some degree, is necessary for capacity. The primary issue\nis about whether the four abilities are always sufficient or\nwhether there are cases in which something else, some further\nabilities or some further feature of the subject\u2019s choice, might\nbe relevant to the assessment of capacity. The three elements most\ncommonly cited by critics are (1) the subject\u2019s emotions, (2)\nthe subject\u2019s values, and (3) the authenticity of a\nsubject\u2019s choice.\n6.1 Challenging the Four Abilities Model: Emotions\n\nEmotions obviously play an important role in decision-making, yet the\nfour abilities model does not directly address the role of emotions. A\nnumber of critics of the model remain convinced that failure to attend\nto emotion in capacity assessment is problematic (White 1994; Charland\n1998b; Halpern 2011, 2012; Bursztajn et al. 1991; Breden &\nVollmann 2004; Hermann et al. 2016).\n\nWhen they think of emotion, most people think of discrete emotional\nepisodes, for example, particular experiences of anger, sadness or\njoy. While these are no doubt important, the realm of emotional\nphenomena is much broader, something that some theorists capture by\ntalking more generally of \u201caffect\u201d or \u201caffective\nphenomena\u201d. In addition to particular episodes of emotion,\npeople have emotional dispositions, moods and longer-term emotionally\nshaped outlooks. For example, someone who is depressed experiences\nmuch more than just a single discrete episode of sadness. To be\ndepressed is to view many things through a dark emotional lens that\ncan shape how a person views her life, what she cares about, and what\nshe sees as worth pursuing. \n\nThere are now a number of published studies that report that depressed\npatients are often decisionally capable and compare well with matched\ncontrols (Appelbaum & Grisso 1995; Vollmann et al. 2003;\nAppelbaum, Grisso, et al. 1999). However, what is being reported is\nthat these patients did well when assessed using instruments like\nthe MacCAT-T which is based on the four abilities model. Because\nthe authors of the studies have faith in that model they clearly\nintend their results to license normative conclusions. However,\ncritics worry that negative emotional outlooks can lead depressed\npatients to weigh risks and benefits differently (Elliot 1997; Rudnick 2002). Since such patients do not care as much about themselves or their own lives, they may not\ncare about risks in the same way they would if not depressed.\nSuch patients are cognitively intact: they understand the relevant\nfacts and grasp that the facts apply to them. But depressed affect may\nstill (so it is argued) undermine their ability to decide. More\nrecently it has been suggested that those who assess the capacity of\npersons with severe depression may need to consider their ability to\nproject themselves into the future as this may relate to hope or loss\nof hope that may impact on decision-making (Halpern 2012; Meynen 2011;\nOwen, Freyenhagen, et al. 2015; Owen, Martin, & Gergel 2018). Some\ntheorists have argued that affect and emotion play a central role in\nmany other mental disorders, even those not necessarily thought of as\ndisorders of affect. On that basis they have argued that the problems\noutlined here\u2014problems related to the fact that the\nfour-abilities model ignores emotion\u2014may also arise with these\npatients. Examples include addiction (Charland 2011), patients with\nOCD (Ruissen 2015; Ruissen et al. 2016), and patients with anorexia\nnervosa (Charland, Hope, et al. 2013; Charland 2015).\n\nCertainly it is true that emotional influences on decision-making can\nbe profound. Our cultural bias (no doubt elicited by the previous\nexample) is to think of emotions as making decisions worse (Charland,\n1998a: 359). But this is to overlook the very real ways that\nemotion\u2014even strong emotion\u2014can improve decision-making.\nMoreover, although it is not often acknowledged, it is only because we\nare creatures with affective capacities that we care about\nthings. A creature completely devoid of emotion or affect would\npresumably not care about anything and so would have no basis for\nmaking decisions (Charland 1998a,b).\n\nStill, the difficulty of focusing on emotions in the current context\nis that we do not have a principled way of distinguishing between the\ngood influences of emotion on decision-making and the bad influences.\nMoreover we need a way to draw this distinction that is independent of\nour opinion about the goodness or badness of the choices being made.\nMost of us tend to see the influence of emotion as bad when we think\nthe decision reached is bad, and vice versa. But value neutrality and\nthe related commitment to a process-based approach rule this out.\nFinally, some theorists have recently voiced worries about what might\nhappen if emotionality were included in capacity assessments in\nthe wrong way. Including emotionality might be good for some\npatients, e.g., those with depression, but might result in too much\nloss of freedom for autistic persons or other neurodiverse people\nwhose emotional responses are different from the norm but who arguably\nare quite able to make decisions for themselves (Mackenzie & Watts\n2011a,b).\n6.2 Challenging the Four Abilities Model: Values & Authenticity\n\nMany of the same theorists who invoke emotion also point to the fact\nthat the four abilities model ignores patient values (Charland 2002).\nHowever, in some cases where, intuitively, patients appear to lack\ncapacity, it is precisely their pursuit of unusual and\nself-destructive values that seems to be problematic. Addicts pursuing\ntheir drug of choice (Levy 2016) or anorexia patients pursuing extreme\nthinness are cases in point. Might there yet be a way to appeal to\nvalues in an assessment of capacity?\n\nThe adequacy of the four abilities model was challenged along these\nlines by Tan, Hope, Stewart and colleagues in a series of articles\nexploring the results of a small empirical study of patients with\nanorexia nervosa (Tan, Hope, & Stewart 2003a,b; Tan, Stewart,\nFitzpatrick, & Hope 2006a,b; Tan, Stewart, & Hope 2009). Ten\nyoung women with the illness were interviewed at length about their\nown understanding of their illness, why they pursued extreme weight\nloss, how they felt about treatment and what might lead them to refuse\ntreatment. In addition, the women were all assessed for\ndecision-making capacity using the MacCAT-T. They all scored very well\non the MacCAT-T, demonstrating high levels of understanding and\nreasoning ability, with scores basically equivalent to healthy\ncontrols (Tan, Stewart, et al. 2006a: 270). By the typical, purely\ncognitive criteria of capacity assessment, they were all (or mostly\nall, depending on how much emphasis one places on appreciation)\n competent.[3]\n Yet most of them also clearly intended to keep trying to lose weight.\nThe extremely high value they placed on being thin led them to\ndownplay other values that had once been more central to them. As they\nexplained to interviewers, thinness was more important to them than\nfamily, friends, education, work, and even life itself. In the words\nof one participant, \n\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t mind dying, I really didn\u2019t want to,\nit\u2019s just I wanted to lose weight, that was the main thing.\n(Tan, Hope, & Stewart 2003a: 702)\n\n\nIntuitively, at least for many people, these young women, diagnosed\nwith a serious mental disorder and pursuing thinness at the expense of\nhealth and life, lack the ability to make their own decisions. For\nsome theorists, indeed, such cases are paradigm cases of incapacity,\nthe kinds of cases a theory ought to be able to account for. However,\nthe cognitively focused four-abilities model cannot account for these\ncases because the young women, though pursuing self-destructive\nbehavior, are cognitively intact. Indeed, it is not uncommon for\npatients with severe anorexia to count as having capacity by the usual\ncriteria (Elzakkers et al. 2016). The only unusual thing about their\ndecisions seems to be what they decide to pursue and the\nvalues that lie behind this. Is there, then, a way to appeal to the\nvalues such patients express as part of explaining why they lack\ncapacity? The traditional understanding of value neutrality\n (\u00a75.4\n above) suggests we can\u2019t. But Tan and others (Tan, Hope, &\nStewart 2003a,b; Tan, Stewart, et al. 2006a) suggest that the key is\nto recognize that these values (unlike, for example, the unusual\nvalues of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness) are caused by the\nmental disorder itself (For a similar point in relation to addiction\nsee Charland 2002, 2011). The values in question are\n\u201cpathological values\u201d.\n\nAlthough this seems promising at first, a number of problems remain.\nTo start with, this view appeals to the idea that anorexia is the\nsource or cause of these values. Even if that were so, we would need\nto know more before we could leverage that into an explanation of\nincapacity. We need a way of explaining how these values\nundermine or are bad-for decision-making.\n\nSome critics of Tan et al. come very close to just asserting that\nsince the anorexic values in question do not undermine the usual four\nabilities, the values in question clearly should not be taken as\nevidence of incapacity (Whiting 2009). This is too simplistic,\nhowever, for it begs the question of whether there might be further\nabilities, in addition to the traditional four, that matter. However,\nit is also true that Tan et al. have not yet given a fully\nsatisfactory account. Even if the values driving decision-making are a\nproduct of mental illness, this doesn\u2019t by itself license the\nconclusion that these values are problematic. An additional link\nbetween the values in question and decision-making is needed and it is\nnot yet clear whether one can be provided.\n\nA second worry is that such an approach (one that appeals to\npathological values) risks giving up one feature of the current\nframework prized by many psychiatrists, namely the refusal to use\ndiagnosis as a basis for determinations of capacity\n (\u00a75.5\n above). If anorexia causes problematic values and if this is\nsufficient to render patients incompetent, then since all patients\nwith anorexia have such values, we will in effect be saying that all\nsuch patients lack the capacity to refuse treatment.\n\nFinally, it is controversial whether or not we can really say that\nanorexia causes these values, even though it is clear that\nanorexia correlates with the existence of them. Like most mental\ndisorders, anorexia nervosa is defined in terms of its symptoms rather\nthan an underlying cause. Namely, the disorder is defined in terms of\nthe strong desires for extreme thinness we have been discussing, as\nwell as the behavioral consequences of these desires. And these\ndesires in turn reflect the value these patients place on extreme\nthinness. It is thus not explanatorily helpful or illuminating in any\nway to say that these desires are caused by anorexia, for\nthis amounts to saying (unhelpfully) that strong desires for extreme\nthinness are caused by strong desires for extreme thinness or that\nvaluing extreme thinness causes the valuing of extreme thinness.\n\nThe issue here is not about whether anorexia is really an illness\n(undoubtedly it is, and a very serious one at that). Rather, the point\nis about our current resources for explanation. Individuals\ncan agree that (a) anorexia is a devastating condition and be puzzled\nby (b) the fact that such individuals typically count as having\ndecision-making capacity, and yet also remain puzzled about (c) how\nprecisely to explain incapacity in these cases in a way consistent\nwith the general values described earlier\n (\u00a75.1\u20135.5).\n\nA slightly different point about values and decision-making capacity\nhas been made more recently, also in the context of trying to\nunderstand patients with anorexia. After extensive and careful\nanalysis of the ways individual patients talk about and describe their\nillness, Hope et al. (2011, 2013) have raised doubts about whether or\nnot we can trust a patient\u2019s own description of her mental\nstates, because patients appear to use different words for the same\nexperience at different times. This is extremely important because,\ngiven the existing framework, everything turns on whether or not\npatients have false beliefs (thereby failing either the understanding\nrequirement or the appreciation requirement). But unusual values are\n(on the standard approach) allowed to stand. However, the research of\nHope et al. suggests that the line between beliefs and values can\nactually be deeply obscure for patients as well as clinicians.\n\nHope et al. (2013) have argued that individuals with anorexia are in\nthe grip of affective states that shape how they see the world. Yet,\nalthough the world presents to them as one way, they may at another\nmore reflective level, reject the appearances. Thus an individual may\nhave a strong feeling or emotional sense that she is\nfat. But even though these feelings incline her to accept the\nproposition that she is fat she may not in fact believe at a higher\nlevel that she is fat. She may know quite well that she is dangerously\nthin. An analogy here with optical illusions is helpful. The\nexperience of seeing a stick in water as bent is incredibly powerful,\nbut we may nonetheless know it is not bent. However, the mental state\nthat is most authoritative when it comes to reporting our beliefs may\nnot be the same as the mental state that is most motivationally\npowerful. When it comes time to make choices about treatment, the\nsalience of the affective phenomena and the relative lack of salience\nof the dangers of self-starvation may lead a person to refuse\ntreatment.\n\nHere is where the puzzle for capacity assessment arises. In a very\nreal sense, the refusal is based on a mental state with a certain\npropositional content that is false. So, under the traditional\nanalysis, it seems we should count the patient as lacking capacity.\nBut in another sense, since her reflective self does not accept that\ncontent (she does not strictly speaking believe it) she has no false\nbeliefs (Hope et al. 2013: 30). And she is credible in\nreporting this. So, again following the traditional analysis, it seems\nwe should count the patient as having capacity.\n\nShe will, of course, be called upon to justify her decision and it may\nnot be clear to her how to describe her mental states. We do not\ntypically report affective experiences in the same way we report\nbeliefs. The only logical argument she could possibly offer would be:\nI would prefer to risk death than to put on weight (Hope et al. 2013:\n30). And this looks like a preference. On the classic analysis she is\ncompetent because her refusing treatment logically follows, given her\npreferences. But as Hope et al. say:\n\n\nBut this preference is not one she clearly held before discussion with\nher physician. It was constructed to create a rational argument for\nrefusing treatment that can satisfy her physician. (Hope et al. 2013:\n30)\n\n\nIf these descriptions of what happens with anorexia patients are\ncorrect, it seems plausible to suppose such patients should not\n(normatively speaking) be counted as having decision-making capacity.\nThey are, on this picture, subject to the emotional equivalent of a\npowerful illusion, and they are unable to resist the illusion when it\ncomes to choice. However, many problems remain about how to properly\ndistinguish cases of capacity and incapacity. The description offered\nby Hope et al. is extremely important for what it calls to our\nattention, but it still leaves most of the core issues unresolved.\n\n\nFinally, a slightly different (but related) challenge to the\nfour-abilities model is made using the notion of authenticity.\nBuilding on the idea introduced by Tan, Stewart, Fitzpatrick, and Hope\n(2006a) that certain values are caused by mental disorder and suspect\nin virtue of this, these critics raise the worry that the values\ndriving decisions may not be authentic values of the patient. If\nauthenticity is, in turn, thought of as part of autonomy, then it\nmight be thought that inauthentic values undermine capacity (though\nsee discussion of autonomy and capacity\n \u00a72).\n So the question then becomes: can we require that the values driving\na treatment decision be authentic, and if not may we declare the\nperson incompetent?\n\nKim (2016) has recently defended a mild form of authenticity\nrequirement that he calls \u201cthe ability to value\u201d. The\nterminology can be misleading because it is not about whether one is\nable to value something as opposed to nothing, but\nabout whether one is able to bring one\u2019s own authentic values to\nbear on decision-making (Hawkins 2016). There are two questions raised\nby Kim that correspond neatly to the two requirements he sketches for\nthe ability to value: first, are the values driving a particular\ntreatment decision really the patient\u2019s own values, or is the\npatient acting out of character? Second, if the values seem\ninauthentic, can we demonstrate that the new problematic values arose\nwith the onset of mental disorder or after some illness related event\n(for example, a depressed person who stopped taking meds three weeks\nago, and started wanting to die shortly thereafter)? The second\nquestion is analogous to the second question that arises in assessing\nappreciation, where we have to determine whether or not a\npatient\u2019s failure to believe that the facts are true of her is\ncaused by a mental problem of some sort (e.g., dementia induced\nconfusion or ICU psychosis). If appreciation fails because of\nreligious or cultural beliefs, this is not a sign of incapacity. Kim\nis clear that he intends this requirement to be applied very\ncarefully, and that impairment in this domain is not sufficient for a\ndetermination of incapacity, though he is vague about what precisely\nit can contribute to such a decision.\n\nOne problem with this view arises if one considers the fact that some\nindividuals with mental disorder identify with their illness (Erler\n& Hope 2014). Tan, Hope, and Stewart (2003b) explore the ways that\nmany young women with anorexia see their illness as an essential part\nof who they are. Yet it is these same values that are influencing\ntheir treatment decisions. If we wish to find a way of explaining the\ndeep intuition that these women lack decision-making capacity, then if\nwe do so through appeals to authenticity, we will most likely have to\ngive up on the idea that individuals are themselves the final\nauthority about which values or features of themselves are the\nauthentic ones.\n\nAppeals to authenticity also face problems related to our ability to\ndistinguish truly inauthentic values from new but still authentic\nones. Not all new values are inauthentic, for it is possible for a\nperson to autonomously change her mind. Moreover, sometimes illness\ngives us experiences that seem highly relevant to our choices. Having\nonce experienced illness we may be inclined to make decisions we would\nnever have expected ourselves to make before we were ill. The\ndecisions are not caused by our illness, but rather reflect what we\nhave learned from illness. As such they should not count against\ncapacity. But to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen we need reliable\nways of distinguishing cases that can, in fact, be very hard to\ndistinguish from the outside. [Also, insofar as we are looking for\nsuspicious changes in values as signs of inauthenticity, this\nwill not help in many cases of anorexia nervosa, where the patients in\nquestion typically acquire the illness at a very young age before they\nhave developed characteristic values distinguishable from the values\nof the illness.]\n\nKim\u2019s awareness of the dangers of confusing real value changes\nwith pathologically induced changes leads him to emphasize the need\nfor extreme caution in this area. Indeed, one problem with Kim\u2019s\napproach is that his understandable caution means that in many cases\nwhere intuitively a patient may lack capacity, we will still not be\nable to rule the patient incompetent (Hawkins 2016). In short, the\noriginal range of ethical constraints on capacity assessment continues\nto make it difficult to capture all and only the cases that seem\nintuitively to be cases of genuine incapacity, and Kim\u2019s\nsolution, though perhaps capturing a few more cases than other views,\nis still restrained in ways that leave us with some highly\ncounterintuitive cases.\n7. A Different Kind of Challenge: Voluntarism\n\nInformed consent requires that a patient be able to make a\nmeaningful decision for herself. But this is just the pre-requisite.\nIf the individual has capacity then he or she must be given all\nrelevant information, and then he or she must make a free or\nvoluntary decision. Voluntariness is complicated terrain, and\nmost of the discussion of voluntariness in informed consent has\nfocused on the sorts of illegitimate behaviors by other people that\ncan undermine voluntariness: force, coercion (threats) and undue\ninducement (Hawkins & Emanuel 2005).\n\nHowever, a more neglected question (at least in the literature on\ninformed consent) is the question of whether factors internal\nto the person can undermine voluntariness. If so, what are these\nfactors and how do we identify them? If such factors exist, then they\nmay most usefully be discussed in connection with decisional capacity\nas opposed to external topics like coercion. This is because questions\nabout internal psychological barriers bring us back once more to\nquestions about the particular abilities of the individual patient or\nsubject, and because if there are problems here, their presence and\nextent are most likely to be assessed by clinicians. Arguably, just as\nfailure to grasp the facts of the situation can make a choice\nmeaningless, something like addiction\u2014which in certain contexts\nalmost guarantees that the person will choose in a particular\nway\u2014may also thereby make choice meaningless (Charland 2002,\n2011).\n\nIn the early days of psychiatry, it was widely recognized that there\ncould be lesions of the will, just as there could be lesions of the\nunderstanding and affective capacities. Towards the end of the\nnineteenth century the French philosopher-psychologist Theodule Ribot\npublished a highly influential book on the topic, entitled Les\nmaladies de la volent\u00e9\u2014later translated as\nDiseases of the Will (Ribot 1883). Ribot argued that the\ncapacity for voluntary choice could sometimes be compromised,\nperverted, or even virtually obliterated, by disease, and that the\nvarious impairments that resulted deserved to be scientifically\nstudied and classified. While it is no longer popular to speak of\n\u201cdiseases of the will\u201d contemporary clinicians and\nresearchers do recognize that human will and agency can be impaired or\neven depleted (Baumeister et al. 1998) in various ways by diseases of\nmany sorts. But there is still little understanding of what such\ndeficits mean for the doctrine of informed consent.\n\nThose contemporary theorists who think we need to acknowledge the\npossibility of genuine psychological barriers to voluntariness tend to\nask questions about the decision-making ability of patients with\naddiction (Charland 2002, 2011) or obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(Ruissen 2015; Ruissen et al. 2016).\n\nUnfortunately, the literature has paid little attention to the\ndistinction made above between internal psychological barriers and\nexternal barriers. For example, Appelbaum, Lidz, and Klitzman (2009)\nset out to chart the domain of voluntariness, but ended up focusing\nexclusively on external factors such as coercion and undue inducement.\nThey are explicit that since the law has traditionally treated\nvoluntariness in an external fashion\u2014as the absence of force,\ncoercion or undue inducement\u2014they have sought to explain only\nthese kinds of phenomena. However, this begs the ethical question of\nwhether there really might be internal barriers to meaningful choice\nand if so, whether the law ought to recognize them even if it\ncurrently doesn\u2019t. Other theorists such as Laura Weiss Roberts\n(2002a,b) have explored a wider range of factors that might affect voluntariness, but with the\nresult that far too much is included (as opposed to too much\nbeing excluded, as above). Approaches like hers fail to make crucial\ndistinctions between strong, though understandable, feelings a person\nmight have in response to a situation (but which need not undermine\nthe voluntariness of a choice) and more plausible threats to\nvoluntariness such as addiction. The difficulty is precisely to\ndistinguish genuine impediments to voluntary choice from the many and\nvaried internal factors that can influence choice, and/or lead to\nimprudent or unwise choices. Much work remains to be done here. \n8. Increasing Relevance and Significant Public Misperceptions\n\nThe literature on decision-making capacity has grown exponentially\nover the last decade, though interestingly most of the explosion is in\nthe clinical and research literature and has a decidedly empirical\nbent. Although new topics continue to be introduced, it is clear that\noutside philosophy much is assumed as settled that would not look\nsettled to a philosophical eye. Thus it will be interesting to see how\nthings develop over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, decision-making capacity is becoming more and more\nrelevant as certain types of ethical questions become hot topics of\npublic debate. For example, decisional-capacity is obviously of great\nimportance in relation to medical-assistance-in-dying laws\n (MAID),[4]\n and yet the public often fails to understand what is actually meant\nby decisional-capacity as well as how variable the practices of\nassessing capacity really are (Kim, Appelbaum, et al. 2011; Seyfried,\nRyan, & Kim 2013). This is particularly important since one of the\nmost divisive issues currently concerns whether those with mental\nillness or cognitive impairment should be candidates for assisted\ndying (Stewart, Peisah, & Draper 2011; Broome & de Cates 2015;\nPrice 2015; Schuklenk & van de Vathorst 2015; Appelbaum 2016;\nCharland, Lemmens, & Wada 2016; Doernberg, Peteet, & Kim 2016;\nKim & Lemmens 2016; Blikshavn, Husum, & Magelssen 2017). As\nthis entry makes clear, some of the most difficult questions about\ndecisional capacity arise specifically in the case of mental illness,\nmaking it even harder to determine whether MAID for the mentally ill\nis a policy that could be implemented appropriately, where\n\u201cappropriate\u201d here just means an implementation that\nstrikes just the right balance between protecting the truly\nvulnerable, on the one hand, and promoting freedom for those who can\nmeaningfully exercise it, on the other.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abernathy, V., 1984, \u201cCompassion, Control, and Decisions\nabout Competency\u201d, <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>,\n141(1): 53\u201358. doi:10.1176/ajp.141.1.53", "Appelbaum, Paul S., 1998, \u201cOught We to Require Emotional\nCapacity as Part of Decisional Competence?\u201d, <em>Kennedy\nInstitute of Ethics Journal</em>, 8(4): 377\u2013387.\ndoi:10.1353/ken.1998.0024", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006. \u201cDecisional Capacity of\nPatients with Schizophrenia to Consent to Research: Taking\nStock\u201d, <em>Schizophrenia Bulletin</em>, 32(1):\n22\u201325.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2007, \u201cAssessment of Patients\u2019\nCompetence to Consent to Treatment\u201d, <em>New England Journal of\nMedicine</em>, 357(18): 1834\u20131840. doi:10.1056/NEJMcp074045", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cPhysician-Assisted Death for\nPatients With Mental Disorders\u2014Reasons for Concern\u201d,\n<em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, 73(4): 325\u2013325.\ndoi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2890", "Appelbaum, Paul S. and Thomas Grisso, 1995, \u201cThe MacArthur\nTreatment Competence Study.
