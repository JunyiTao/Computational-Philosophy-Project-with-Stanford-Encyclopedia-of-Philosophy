    "main_text": "Bodily self-awareness\n4. Bodily self-awareness\n\nMuch of what we have said about self-consciousness may still seem\noverly mentalistic. It is important to note that for phenomenologists\nlike Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, pre-reflective self-awareness is both\nembodied and embedded in the world. The first-person point of view on\nthe world is never a view from nowhere; it is always defined by the\nsituation of the perceiver\u2019s body, which concerns not simply\nlocation and posture, but action in pragmatic contexts and interaction\nwith other people. Prereflective self-consciousness includes aspects\nthat are both bodily and intersubjective.\n\nThe claim is not simply that the perceiver/actor is objectively\nembodied, but that the body is in some fashion experientially present\nin the perception or action. Phenomenologists distinguish the\nprereflective body-awareness that accompanies and shapes every spatial\nexperience, from a reflective consciousness of the body. To capture\nthis difference, Husserl introduced a terminological distinction\nbetween Leib and K\u00f6rper, that is, between the\nprereflectively lived body, i.e., the body as an embodied first-person\nperspective, and the subsequent thematic experience of the\nbody as an object (Husserl 1973a, 57). Prereflective body-\n(Leib-) awareness is not a type of object-perception, but it\nis an essential element of every such perception. If I reach for a\ntool, I don\u2019t first have to find my hands; I know where to reach\nbecause I have a sense of where the tool is in relation to myself. I\nalso sense that I will be able to reach it, or that I will have to\ntake two steps towards it. My perception of the tool must involve\nproprioceptive and kinaesthetic information about my bodily situation\nand the position of my limbs, otherwise I would not be able to reach\nfor it or use it. If in such cases, we want to say that I have an\nawareness of my body, such bodily awareness is quite different from\nthe perception that I have of the tool. I may have to look or feel\naround in order to find where the tool is; but, under normal\ncircumstances, I never have to do that in regard to my body. I am\ntacitly aware, not only of where my hands and feet are, but also of\nwhat I can do with them. This tacit awareness of my body always\nregisters as an \u201cI can\u201d (or \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d\nas the case may be). Primarily, my body is experienced, not as an\nobject, but as a field of activity and affectivity, as a potentiality\nof mobility and volition, as an \u201cI do\u201d and \u201cI\ncan.\u201d\n\nThe body provides not only the egocentric spatial framework for\norientation towards the world, but also the constitutive contribution\nof its mobility. Perception does not involve a passive reception, but\nan active exploration of the environment. Husserl calls attention to\nthe importance of bodily movements (the movements of the eye,\nmanipulations by the hand, the locomotion of the body, etc.) for the\nexperience of space and spatial objects. He further claims that\nperception is correlated to and accompanied by\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic self-sensation or self-affection (Husserl\n1973c). Every visual or tactile appearance is given in correlation to\na kinaesthetic experience. When I touch a shaped surface, it is given\nin conjunction with a sensation of finger movements. When I watch the\nflight of a bird, the moving bird is given in conjunction with the\nkinaesthetic sensations of eye movement and perhaps neck movement.\nSuch kinaesthetic activation during perception produces an implicit\nand pervasive reference to one\u2019s own body. The implicit\nself-awareness of the actual and possible movements of my body helps\nshape the experience that I have of the world. To be clear, however,\nbodily self-awareness is not an awareness of the body in isolation\nfrom the world; it is embedded in action and perception. We do not\nfirst become aware of the body and subsequently use it to engage with\nthe world. We experience the world bodily, and the body is revealed to\nus in our exploration of the world. Primarily, the body attains\nself-awareness in action (or in our dispositions to action, or in our\naction possibilities) when it relates to something, uses something, or\nmoves through the\n world.[5]\n\nBodily self-awareness, like self-consciousness more generally, has\nlimitations. I am never fully aware of everything that is going on\nwith my body. Indeed, my body tends to efface itself as I perceive and\nact in the world. When I jump to catch a ball that is thrown over my\nhead, I certainly have a sense of what I can do, but I am not aware of\nmy precise movements or postures\u2014for example, that my right leg\nbends at a certain angle as I reach with my left hand. I can execute\nmovements without being explicitly conscious of them, and even what I\nam tacitly aware of is somewhat limited\u2014for example, I am not\naware of the shape of my grasp as I reach to grab the ball. Although I\nmay not be aware of certain details about my bodily performance, this\ndoes not mean however that I am unconscious of my body. Rather it\nmeans that the way that I am aware of my body is fully integrated with\nthe intentional action that I am performing. I know that I am jumping\nto catch the ball, and implicit in that, as an immediate sense rather\nthan an inference, I experience my body jumping to catch the ball.\n\nFurthermore, experiential aspects of my embodiment permeate my\nprereflective self-consciousness. There is something it is like to\njump to catch a ball, and part of what it is like is that I am in fact\njumping. There is something different about what it is like to sit and\nimagine (or remember) myself jumping to catch the ball, and at least\npart of that difference has to do with the fact that I am sitting\nrather than jumping, although none of this may be explicit in my\nexperience.\n\nAnother way to think of the self-awareness involved in action is to\nconsider the sense of agency that is normally an aspect of\nprereflective self-consciousness in action. If, as I am walking down\nthe street, I am pushed from behind, I am instantly aware of my body\nmoving in a way that I did not intend. The fact that I feel a loss of\ncontrol over my actions suggests that there had been an implicit sense\nof agency or control in my walking prior to being pushed. In voluntary\naction, I experience the movements of my body as my own actions, and\nthis is replaced by a feeling of loss of bodily control in the case of\ninvoluntary movement. Voluntary actions feel different from\ninvoluntary actions, and this difference depends respectively, on the\nexperience of agency or the experience of a lack of agency\u2014as\nthe case may be if my body is being moved by someone\n else.[6]\n\nHubert Dreyfus has famously argued that in the case of expert\nperformance we are not self-conscious, but rather \u201cusually\ninvolved in coping in a mindless way\u201d (Dreyfus 2007a, 356). On\nhis account, our immersed bodily life is so completely and totally\nworld-engaged that it is entirely oblivious to itself. Indeed, in\ntotal absorption, one ceases being a subject altogether (Dreyfus\n2007b, 373). It is only when this bodily absorption is interrupted\nthat something like self-consciousness emerges. Dreyfus consequently\ndoesn\u2019t deny the existence of self-consciousness, but he\ndefinitely wants to see it as a capacity that is only exercised or\nactualized on special occasions. Moreover, when this capacity is\nexercised it necessarily disrupts our coping and radically transform\nthe kind of affordances that are given to it (Dreyfus 2005, 61; 2007,\n354). A number of theorists, however, have taken issue with this\ncharacterization of expert performance and have argued that in the\nperforming arts (e.g., in dance, musical performance) and in athletics\n(e.g., baseball, cricket) expert performers may employ an enhanced but\nstill prereflective awareness (Legrand 2007), a heedful consciousness\nof the situation (e.g., Sutton et al. 2011), or even a skillful\nreflective monitoring (Montero 2010; 2014), or some variable\ncombination of these (H\u00f8ffding 2018), and that such\nconsciousness does not impede performance but improves it.\n\nBodily self-awareness is not influenced only by action-oriented\nmovement or motor control processes; it is also modulated by various\naffective (emotional), autonomic and interoceptive processes that are\ncontingent on current bodily states and closely related to\nenvironmental variations. What Dainton (2007) calls background\nsensations, as well as what Matthew Ratcliffe (2008) calls existential\nfeelings, are part of a mix of sensory processes that can provide what\nWilliam James (1890) terms the \u201cwarmth and intimacy\u201d of\nbodily sensations, or what Thomas Fuchs (2013) calls \u201cthe\nfeeling of being alive.\u201d\n",
