    "main_text": "Traces of Positivism in Religion and Metaethics\n9. Afterword\n\n\nHare\u2019s unpublished paper \u201cMoral Objectivity\u201d contains a\nstriking passage, unparalleled elsewhere, that confirms Lucas\u2019s\nsupposition (2002: 31) of a connection between his war experience and\na vein of existentialism. He imagines being an interpreter in a\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camp who is trying to persuade the Japanese\ncommander not to send sick people out to work on the railway:\n\nI ask him to visualise, not certain non-natural properties, but the\nvery natural, real properties of the situations that the alternative\ncourses of action will bring about \u2026 It is not by any appeal to\nintuition that I can conduct my argument; \u2026 it is by revealing\nto him the nature of his choice, and showing him what it involves,\nwhat in fact he is choosing. And when I have done all this, I can only\nleave him to choose; for it is after all his choice, not mine \u2026\nAt any rate I have myself chosen, so far as in me lies, my own way of\nlife, my own standard of values, my own principle of choice. In the\nend we all have to choose for ourselves; and no one can do it for\nanyone else.\n\n\nWhat makes Hare arguably unique, though at the same time closer in\napproach to Kant than to the utilitarians whose ally he became, was\nthat he combined this insistence upon the ineluctability of individual\nchoice with an optimistic view of the possibilities of making choices\nrationally. (Indeed, he played with the idea that Kant could have been\na utilitarian, 1993b.) What reconciles these two features of moral\nthinking, in his view, is nothing other than the logic of the\npractical \u201cought\u201d. That this is crucial and central was\nalready a claim within his early and unpublished monograph \u201cAn\nEssay in Monism\u201d. There, criticizing \u201cmaterialists\u201d\n(among whom he counts utilitarians) for letting \u201cthe word\n\u2018ought\u2019 slip out of their vocabulary\u201d, he remarks,\nBoth the Greeks of the Fourth Century B.C. and we\nin our own times have seen how quickly people like Thrasymachus spring\nup, and with what dire results, once men have forgotten the meaning of\n\u201cought\u201d. (ch. 19, p. 62)\n\n\nThis may already seem curious in two ways. First, one might suppose\nthat language is rather our servant than our master, and that the\nrationality of reasoning in the ways he recommends needs to be\nestablished on general grounds, and not made to depend upon theses\nabout the connotations of a word. Secondly, one of the theses in\nquestion\u2014that practical \u201cought\u201ds entail\nimperatives\u2014is hardly obviously true; one might rather expect an\nOxford philosopher, in the heyday of ordinary language philosophy, to\nbe sensitive to the objection that the modal \u201cYou ought to\ndo X\u201d no more entails the imperative\n\u201cDo X\u201d than the modal \u201cHe ought to have got\nhome by now\u201d entails the indicative \u201cHe has got home by\nnow\u201d. (Think how much more plausible it is to infer the second\nfrom \u201cHe must have got home by now\u201d.)\n\n\nHare had replies to both objections, which he sets out briefly\nin Moral Thinking (1981). He insists that we need our words\nto mean what they do mean if we are to answer the questions that we\nwant to ask:\nIf we were to alter the meaning of our words, we\nshould be altering the questions we were asking, and perhaps\nanswering, in terms of them \u2026 If we go trying to\nanswer those questions, we are stuck with those\nconcepts. (1981: 18)\nAnd yet, at the same time, he asserts no more\nthan that the practical \u201cought\u201d is a \u201cnear\nneighbour\u201d to the deontic \u201cmust\u201d (1981: 7),\nacknowledging\nIt is much odder to say \u201cI must\u201d at\nthe moment at which one is backsliding (i.e. doing what one says one\nmust not do) than it is to do this with \u201cought\u201d.  (1981:\n24)\nHere he may seem to vacillate between two different roles, that of\ndescribing our language as it is, and that of tightening it in order\nto make it more rigorous. Perhaps one may reconcile these through\nmaking much of the following qualification:\nBut \u201cought\u201d aspires to the status of\n\u201cmust\u201d, and \u2026 in rigorous, critical moral reasoning\nhas to be used like it. (1981: 24)\nIn Hare\u2019s view, it is human weakness that is\nserved better by \u201cought\u201d than by \u201cmust\u201d, and\nwe reveal our commitment to the logic of \u201cmust\u201d in uses of\n\u201cought\u201d that fall short of that logic, and yet constantly\naspire to live up to it.  \u201cIntuitive\u201d thinking may be as\nnecessary as \u201ccritical\u201d, and yet it is never such as to\nenjoy a secure resting-place in our hearts and minds.\n\n\nAt the heart of Hare\u2019s ethical theory, therefore, lies a vision of\nhuman beings as unable to live up to a way of thinking towards which\nthey are nonetheless ineluctably drawn. He perceives there to be a\ndrama inherent in the human condition to which no fully integrated and\nunified system could do justice. His philosophy is currently somewhat\nout of fashion, in part through a reversion to various forms of\ncognitivism in ethics, in part through changes in the style of\nphilosophy, which now pursues the clarity that he desired through a\nnew complexity and professionalization. At least in the short term, it\nis probable, and in accord with the \u201cstrange dream\u201d from\nwhich we started, that his thinking will come to be viewed from a\ndistance, as playing a once important role within the non-cognitivist\nstrain in ethics that was dominant through much of the 20th\ncentury. And yet it may yet come to hold the attention of a new\naudience through its recognition of the tensions inherent in any\npractical thinking that responds without complacency to the\naspirations of our ethical ideals, and the limitations of our moral\ncapacities.\n\n\n Supplementary Document:\n Hare\u2019s \u201cAn Essay on Monism\u201d\n\n\n",
