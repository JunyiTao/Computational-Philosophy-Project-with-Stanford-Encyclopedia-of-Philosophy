Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Writings and Their Background\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s surviving works contain well over a\nthousand pages that are devoted to explaining the contents of\nAristotle\u2019s logical writings and aimed at educated readers of\nArabic. Much of this material reveals al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nstrong interest in the nature of language.\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s intellectual background was not so\nmuch Aristotle himself. Rather it was the Aristotelian part of the\nsyllabus of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy that flourished in\nAlexandria (in Egypt) in the fifth and sixth centuries (see\nD\u2019Ancona 2022). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us that\neventually \u201cinstruction was moved from Alexandria to\nAntioch\u201d (in Syria), until the last members of the school\nscattered \u201ctaking their books with them\u201d. He says that he\nhimself studied with one of these last members,\nY\u016b\u1e25ann\u0101 bin \u1e24ayl\u0101n, and together they read\nAristotle up to the end of Posterior Analytics. He adds that\nthe Alexandrian school came to describe the part of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon from modal logic onwards as \u201cthe part that is\nnot read\u201d, since under the Christians the modal material had\nbeen kept hidden. (Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s account is in a\nlost work quoted by the historian Ibn Ab\u012b Usaybi\u2018a\n[\u2018Uy\u016bn 604f]; see the translation in Fakhry 2002:\n159.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has oversimplified the history (see Lameer\n1997 and Watt 2008). But he correctly implies that his understanding\nof Aristotle is based on the Alexandrian syllabus and its later\noffshoots in the Middle East. For example, the account of logic in his\ninfluential [Catalogue] has been shown to be an edited\ntranslation of a work from the Alexandrian teaching\n materials.[1]\n So for understanding al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b it becomes important to\nknow when he is giving his own considered view and when he is merely\npassing on parts of the Alexandrian syllabus. As yet there is no\nconsensus about this, or about the order in which he wrote his\nworks.\n\nThe Alexandrian Neoplatonists saw philosophy as an avenue by which we\ncan achieve happiness through knowledge of The One (see Wildberg\n2021). To add intellectual rigor to this mystical endeavor they\nincluded the logical writings of Aristotle in the early stages of\ntheir teaching syllabus. They devised a body of introductory texts to\nexplain how Aristotle\u2019s logic saves us from incorrect thinking\nand acting, and why Aristotle devised his logic syllabus\u2014his\nOrganon\u2014in the form that he gave\n it.[2]\n Some features of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s presentation are\nmost easily explained in terms of the Alexandrians. For example, the\nAristotelian part of their syllabus, after Porphyry\u2019s\nEisagoge, began with Aristotle\u2019s Categories,\nso al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b duly seeks reasons why categories are an\nessential first step in logic. Their Organon also included\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and his Poetics; so\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains why the arts of rhetoric and poetry\nare really parts of logic. If their Organon had contained a\nbook on music, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b would have explained why\nmusical theory is a branch of\n logic.[3]\n (On music see\n Section 10\n below.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s logical writings take various forms.\nSome of them are Long Commentaries on works of Aristotle, which\ndissect Aristotle\u2019s text in sometimes excruciating detail; only\nthe Long Commentary on De Interpretatione survives in full,\nthough we have parts of others. More friendly are the Epitomes, in\nwhich al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b rewrites works in the Organon\nfrom his own point of view. There are also a number of texts that\nserve as introductions to the Organon, though they are not\nnecessarily elementary. We call attention to three works in this last\ngroup. The first, [Indication], teaches that logic is the art\nof making correct discriminations, and hence is the key to happiness\nin life as a whole. It also explains that we must study language\nbefore we study logic. The second, [Expressions], is a sequel\nto [Indication] and introduces the vocabulary of logic. \n\nThe third work is the extraordinarily original and insightful\n[Letters], which weaves together language, logic, and\nmetaphysics. We will take this work as the best basis for\nunderstanding al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s overall view of\nlanguage and logic. Sections 2 to 5 below will review what we take to\nbe the core of this view. The remaining\n Sections 6 to 10\n will pick up particular themes.\n\nBesides the Alexandrian material, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b was able to\ncall on highly professional Arabic translations of the books of the\nOrganon. He also had translations of some logical writers\nfrom the Roman Empire, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius. He is not known to have made any use of earlier Arabic\ntexts relating to logic, such as the Logic of Ibn\nal-Muqaffa\u2018 and writings of al-Kind\u012b. (Zimmermann [1981:\nlxviii\u2013xcviii] and Lameer [1994: Chapter 1] discuss what earlier\nlogical writings were available to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b. See also\nWalzer [1962: 129\u2013136] for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nsources on Aristotle\u2019s poetics.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s work on logic and language had a\ndirect effect on several Arabic authors in the two hundred years after\nhis\n death.[4]\n These include Ibn B\u0101jja (in Latin Avempace), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n(Avicenna), Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (Algazel), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes).\nHe also influenced a number of medieval Jewish authors including\nMaimonides. The Latins knew him as Alfarabius or Alpharabius or\nAbunaser. His influence can be seen in Scholastic treatments of\ndeterminism, poetic argument, and the classification of\n sciences.[5]\n",
