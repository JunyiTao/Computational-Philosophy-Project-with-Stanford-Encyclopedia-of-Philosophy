    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || Dialogical vs. Monological Morality\n3.6 Dialogical vs. Monological Morality\n\nMuch depends on Habermas\u2019s articulation and defence of the\ndistinction between a dialogical and a monological ethics, and his\nargument for the superiority of the former, which he makes with\nvehemence and conviction both in his critical engagement with Lawrence\nKohlberg and later in his debate with Rawls. Nonetheless, critics have\nargued that the putative distinction between dialogical and\nmonological ethics is one without a difference, and have cast doubt on\nHabermas\u2019s argument for the cognitive superiority of dialogical\nethics. McMahon argues that (U) is ambiguous between two very\ndifferent conceptions of dialogicality. Weak dialogicality consists in\nthe concurrence of independent judgements about which norm would\nsatisfy the interest of all concerned, that is put together in\npiecemeal fashion (McMahon 2000: 521). Strong dialogicality, by\ncontrast, involves a collective, joint judgement by all affected.\nMcMahon claims that Habermas, and Rehg (1991 & 1994), whose\ninterpretation of (U) Habermas cites approvingly (1992b [1996b: 109]),\nendorse the strong conception. But the strong conception, which\nrequires that each participant in discourse suspend judgement until\nall other have cast their vote, is, so to speak, incoherent. For one\nthing, it robs each participant of any reason to judge from their own\nperspective whether a norm is valid. For another, it renders deviation\nfrom a norm impossible, because as soon as an agent deviates from a\nnorm, it is no longer valid, and cannot be criticized as mistaken\n(McMahon 2000: 529).\n\nAnother reason to think that the distinction is without a difference\nis that Habermas allows participants in an actual discourse to conduct\nadvocatory discourses whereby they imaginatively project themselves\ninto other people\u2019s points of view. He must allow this because\nit would be impossible to conduct an actual discourse with \u201call\naffected\u201d by a norm. So Habermas must allow that the\nconstituency of all participants in an actual discourse might be\nsmall, at the limit two people, and that the constituency of\n\u201call affected\u201d by a norm might consist of every moral\nagent and patient including the unborn. But with that degree of\nidealization, the difference between an ideal discourse conducted\nmonologically and an actual but advocatory dialogue between real\npeople has all but disappeared, and the cognitive superiority of the\nlatter cannot be maintained.\n",
