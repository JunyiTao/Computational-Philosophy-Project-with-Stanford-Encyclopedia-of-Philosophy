    "main_text": "Conclusion\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe study of nature was a search for answers to why-questions before\nand independently of Aristotle. A critical examination of the language\nof causality used by his predecessors, together with a careful study\nof natural phenomena, led Aristotle to elaborate a theory of\ncausality. This theory is presented in its most general form in\nPhysics II 3 and in Metaphysics V 2. In both texts,\nAristotle argues that a final, formal, efficient or material cause can\nbe given in answer to a why-question.\n\nAristotle further elaborates on the topic of causality in the rest of\nPhysics II and in Parts of Animals I. Aristotle\nexplores the systematic interrelations among the four modes of\ncausality and argues for the explanatory priority of the final cause.\nIn so doing Aristotle not only expands on his theory of causality; he\nalso builds explanatory principles that are specific to the study of\nnature. Aristotle considers these principles an indispensable\ntheoretical framework for a successful investigation of the natural\nworld. Both Physics II and Parts of Animals I have a\nfoundational character. More directly, Aristotle expects the student\nof nature to have mastered the principles advanced in these two texts\nbefore engaging in the investigation of the natural world.\n\nAlthough Aristotle\u2019s theory of causality is developed in the\ncontext of his science of nature, its application goes well beyond the\nboundaries of natural science. This is already clear from the most\ngeneral presentation of the theory in Physics II 3 and in\nMetaphysics V 2. Here the four causes are used to explain\nhuman action as well as artistic production. In addition, any\ntheoretical investigation that there might be besides natural science\nwill employ the doctrine of the four causes. \n\nConsider, briefly, the case of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\nHere Aristotle is seeking wisdom. Part of the argument of the\nMetaphysics is in an attempt to clarify what sort of wisdom\nAristotle is seeking. Suffice it to say that Aristotle conceives of\nthis wisdom as a science of substance that is, or is a part of, a\nscience of being qua being (for further information about this\nargument, see the entry Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, especially\nSections 1 and 3.) What is important is that this science consists in\na causal investigation, that is, a search for the relevant causes.\nThis helps us to understand why the most general presentation of\nAristotle\u2019s theory of causality is repeated, in almost the same\nwords, in Physics II 3 and in Metaphysics V 2.\nAlthough the Physics and the Metaphysics belong to\ntwo different theoretical enterprises, in both cases we are expected\nto embark on an investigation that will eventuate in causal knowledge,\nand this is not possible without a firm grasp of the interrelations\nbetween the four (types of) causes.\n",
