    "main_text": "Sources\n1. Sources\n\nThe major source for Epicurean doctrine is Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nthird-century C.E. Lives of Eminent Philosophers, a\ncompilation of information on the lives and doctrines of the\nphilosophers of classical Greece (see \u201cDoxography of Ancient\nPhilosophy\u201d). In the tenth and final book, devoted to\nEpicureanism, Diogenes preserves three of Epicurus\u2019 letters to\nhis disciples, in which he presents his basic views in a concise and\nhandy form. The Letter to Herodotus summarizes\nEpicurus\u2019 physical theory, the Letter to Menoeceus\noffers a pr\u00e9cis of Epicurean ethics, and the Letter to\nPythocles treats astronomical and meteorological matters. (There\nis some doubt about whether the last is by Epicurus himself or a\nfollower, but there seems to be sufficient reason to attribute it to\nthe founder himself.) Diogenes also quotes a collection of brief\nsayings, called the \u201cPrincipal Beliefs\u201d or\n\u201cPrincipal Doctrines\u201d (Kuriai Doxai), excerpted\nfrom the writings of Epicurus or, in some cases, of his close\nassociates; another such collection, partially overlapping with the\nfirst, survives in an independent manuscript and is conventionally\ncalled the Vatican Sayings. The purpose of both sets, like that of the\nLetters, was to make the core doctrines easy to remember. Diogenes\nalso fills in topics not covered in the Letters, and provides a list\nof Epicurus\u2019 writings and other biographical information (for\nthe text, see Dorandi 2013; for an English translation, Mensch 2018).\n\n\nShort citations of Epicurus\u2019 works appear in other writers\n(e.g., Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus, and the Greek commentators on\nAristotle), often taken out of context or presented in a polemical and\ndistorted fashion. (The standard edition of Epicurus\u2019 works in\nGreek is Arrighetti 1973; the fullest collection of fragments and\ntestimonies is still Usener 1887, repr. with Italian translation,\nRamelli 2002; for translations, see Bibliography: Editions,\nTranslations, Commentaries). In addition, several works of Epicurus,\nincluding parts of his major treatise, On Nature (Peri\nphuse\u00f4s) \u2014 a series of lectures running to 37 papyrus\nrolls \u2014 have been recovered in damaged condition from the\nlibrary of a villa in the town of Herculaneum, which was buried in the\neruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 C.E. The library almost certainly\ncontained the working collection of Philodemus, an Epicurean\nphilosopher from Syria who studied in Athens and moved to Italy in the\nfirst century B.C.E. Many of the rolls consist of Philodemus\u2019\nown writings, and provide valuable information about later issues in\nthe history of Epicureanism. One must be cautious about ascribing\nthese views to the founder himself, although the school tended to be\nconservative and later thinkers embellished rather than altered\nEpicurus\u2019 own teachings. New editions and translations are now\nmaking these difficult texts available to a wider readership.\n\nMore or less contemporary with Philodemus is Lucretius (first century\nB.C.E.), who composed in Latin De rerum natura (\u201cOn the\nNature of Things\u201d; the title, if it is Lucretius\u2019 own, is\nan adaptation of \u201cOn Nature\u201d) in six books of hexameter\nverse, the meter characteristic of epic and didactic poetry. As a\ndedicated Epicurean, passionate to promulgate the message of the\nfounder, Lucretius reproduced Epicurean doctrine faithfully (Sedley\n1998; Clay 1983 allows Lucretius more originality). His poem\nconcentrates principally on the physical and psychological or\nepistemological aspects of Epicureanism, and to a great extent omits\nthe ethical. From a hostile point of view, Cicero rehearsed and\ncriticized Epicurus\u2019 ideas, especially concerning ethics, in\nseveral of his philosophical works, including On Moral Ends\n(De finibus) and the Tusculan Disputations. Still\nlater, in the second century C.E., another Diogenes erected a large\ninscription, to this day only partially excavated, in the city of\nOenoanda (in southwestern Turkey), which contained the basic tenets of\nEpicureanism (authoritative edition by Smith 1993, but new fragments\nhave been published subsequently; see also Gordon 1996, Hammerstaedt\net alii, 2017).\n",
