    "main_text": "Later Developments and Influence || Neo-Confucianism\n8.1 Neo-Confucianism\n\nCompetition for power, prestige, and wealth led to sectarian conflicts\namong Buddhists, Daoists, and Confucians. In addition, some aspects of\ninstitutional Buddhism were socially problematic, including the vast\namounts of tax-exempt wealth controlled by monasteries and extreme\nreligious practices such as self-immolation and self-mutilation, which\nwere endorsed even by leading figures like Zhiyan and Fazang.\nEventually, Daoists encouraged the Tang Emperor Wuzong to launch the\nGreat Anti-Buddhist Persecution (Ch. huichang huifo) of\n842\u2013846. During this period, Buddhist monks and nuns were forcibly\ndefrocked, temples and shrines were destroyed, and their property\nseized. Although the persecution only lasted until the emperor\u2019s\ndeath and was reversed by the next emperor, Buddhism never fully\nrecovered from the damage to its social influence and intellectual\nprestige. \n\nFollowing the decline of Buddhism, the movement known in the West as\n\u201cNeo-Confucianism\u201d became increasingly influential.\n Neo-Confucianism\n presents itself as a revival of the original\nteachings of Confucianism against the mistaken doctrines of Daoism and\nBuddhism. However, after centuries of Buddhist dominance in\nphilosophy, it was almost inevitable that Neo-Confucian thinkers would\nunconsciously reinterpret their tradition in the light of Buddhist\nconcepts. For example, we saw how the Chinese term li\n(principle/pattern) is central to Huayan metaphysics. It is also\ncentral to \n Neo-Confucian metaphysics,\n even though the term is of\nperipheral importance in the Confucian classics. For example, of the\nFour Books of the Confucian canon, \u201cli\u201d\noccurs precisely zero times in all of the Analects of\nConfucius and the Great Learning, only twice in the\nMean, and a mere seven times in the Mengzi. In none\nof the passages where it does occur is there any suggestion that the\nterm has any deep metaphysical importance. (A typical use is in a\ndialogue in which someone asks Mengzi for help with his lack of\neloquence, describing himself as \u201cnot patterned (li) in\nregard to my mouth.\u201d) Nonetheless, Neo-Confucian philosophers\nlike \n Zhu Xi\n  (1130\u20131200) repeatedly use the term to explain what they\ntake to be the underlying meaning of the classics, and give it a\nmetaphysical meaning very reminiscent of Indra\u2019s net. Similarly,\nthe Neo-Confucian emphasis on the dangers of \u201cselfish\ndesires\u201d (Ch. siyu) and \u201cselfish thoughts\u201d\n(Ch. siyi) is not characteristic of ancient Confucianism, but\nrather reflects the centrality of selfishness in Buddhist accounts of\nhuman wrongdoing. \n",
