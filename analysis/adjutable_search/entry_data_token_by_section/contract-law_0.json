    "main_text": "General Theories of the Law of Contracts\n1. General Theories of the Law of Contracts\n\nThis first part examines general theories of contract that take\ncentral features of the common law as their explanatory starting\npoint. The range of possible contract law regimes is, of course, vast,\nand there is a risk of overgeneralization. Still, since many\nexchange-regimes share basic features, it is not an unreasonable\nexpectation that the principles extracted from a sophisticated and\nwell-functioning body of contract law might aid in our understanding\nof contract law as such, at least where the law functions to regulate\neconomic life in modern market orders.\n\nThere are at least five prominent accounts of the fundamental\nprinciples of the common law of contracts. The first, and most famous,\nholds that contract law enforces the basic moral duty to keep\npromises. A related though distinct view presents contract law as\nenforcing a duty not to harm others. A third conceives of the law not\nas enforcing parties\u2019 non-legal duties, but as promoting\nefficient investment and exchange. An association with economic theory\ngives this approach a prominence in legal scholarship that outstrips\nthe philosophical attention it has received. A fourth position\nemphasizes that contracts establish a distinctive relationship between\nthe parties to them and grounds contractual obligations in the value\nof acting jointly and cooperatively with others. A fifth position is\npluralistic and proposes that contract law has many fundamental goals\nthat need not be jointly satisfiable or even consistent. These\ncompeting views can be evaluated along several dimensions, including\n\u201cfit\u201d with actual doctrine, success in justifying the law,\nand internal coherence.\n",
