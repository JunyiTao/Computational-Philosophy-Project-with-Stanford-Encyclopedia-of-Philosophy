    "main_text": "Why be Anti-Behaviorist\n8. Conclusion\n\nIn 1977 Willard Day, a behavioral psychologist and founding editor of\nthe journal Behaviorism (later known as Behavior and Philosophy),\npublished Skinner\u2019s \u201cWhy I am not a cognitive\npsychologist\u201d (Skinner 1977). Skinner began the paper by stating\nthat \u201cthe variables of which human behavior is a function lie in\nthe environment\u201d (p. 1). Skinner ended by remarking that\n\u201ccognitive constructs give \u2026 a misleading account of\nwhat\u201d is inside a human being (p. 10)\n\nMore than a decade earlier, in 1966 Carl Hempel had announced his\ndefection from behaviorism:\n\nIn order to characterize \u2026 behavioral patterns, propensities,\nor capacities \u2026 we need not only a suitable behavioristic\nvocabulary, but psychological terms as well. (p. 110)\n\n\nHempel had come to believe that it is a mistake to imagine that human\nbehavior can be understood exclusively in non-mental, behavioristic\nterms.\n\nContemporary psychology and philosophy largely share Hempel\u2019s\nconviction that the explanation of behavior cannot omit invoking a\ncreature\u2019s representation of its world. Psychology must use\npsychological terms. Behavior without cognition is blind.\nPsychological theorizing without reference to internal cognitive\nprocessing is explanatorily impaired. To say this, of course, is not\nto a priori preclude that behaviorism will recover some of its\nprominence. Just how to conceive of cognitive processing (even where\nto locate it) remains a heated subject of debate (see Melser 2004; see\nalso Levy 2007, pp. 29\u201364). But if behaviorism is to recover\nsome of its prominence, this recovery may require a reformulation of\nits doctrines that is attune to developments (like that of\nneuroeconomics) in neuroscience as well as in novel therapeutic\norientations.\n\nSkinner\u2019s vantage point on or special contribution to\nbehaviorism mates the science of behavior with the language of\norganism/environment interactions. But we humans don\u2019t just run\nand mate and walk and eat in this or that environment. We think,\nclassify, analyze, imagine, and theorize. In addition to our outer\nbehavior, we have highly complex inner lives, wherein we are active,\noften imaginatively, in our heads, all the while often remaining as\nstuck as posts, as still as stones. Call our inner life\n\u2018behavior\u2019 if one wants, but this piece of linguistic\nstipulation does not mean that the probability or occurrence of inner\nevents is shaped by the same environmental contingencies as overt\nbehavior or bodily movements. It does not mean that understanding a\nsentence or composing an entry for this encyclopedia consist of the\nsame general modes of discriminatory responses as learning how to move\none\u2019s body in pursuit of a food source. How the Inner\nRepresentational World of mind maps into the Country of Behaviorism\nremains the \u201cism\u2019s\u201d still incompletely charted\nterritory. \n",
