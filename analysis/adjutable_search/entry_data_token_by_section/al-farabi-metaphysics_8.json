F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in On the\nAims of the Metaphysics had included unity alongside being in the\nobject of metaphysics; and when Book of Letters I follows the\nagenda and many of the subject-headings of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201clexicon\u201d in Metaphysics V, it is strange that it\nleaves out unity, which Aristotle treats in Metaphysics V,6.\nBut the treatment of unity, missing from the Book of Letters,\nis supplied by On the One and Unity [henceforth On the\nOne]. Since the Book of Letters as is incompletely\ntransmitted, it is not entirely out of the question that On the\nOne is a missing part of the Book of Letters. Perhaps\nmore likely, On the One was originally intended as a part of\nthe Book of Letters, but got too long and complicated, and\nwas spun off as a separate treatise. The treatise is too complicated\nand too little-studied (with major editorial problems) to treat here\nin full detail, but we can describe some major themes. The treatise is\nhelpful in understanding the notion of circumscription by a quiddity,\nwhich is thematized both in the Book of Letters and On\nthe One and used without explanation in the Perfect City\nand Political Regime, and also in understanding\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s explanation of Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim in Metaphysics IV,2 that being and unity are\ncoextensive and mutually entailing, and his account in the Perfect\nCity and Political Regime of how unity is predicated of\nGod.\n\nMain themes of the treatise include distinguishing a whole family of\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d (in a few cases F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nalso gives the corresponding senses of the abstract\n\u201cunity\u201d), but also and especially distinguishing different\nways that senses of \u201cone\u201d are related to senses of\n\u201cmany\u201d. The treatise can read like a dry catalogue, and\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee rarely gives arguments or admits that his\nclaims might be controversial, but it is often clear that he has an\nopponent in mind. That opponent might be a type rather than a\nparticular earlier philosopher, but it seems likely that it is\nspecifically al-Kind\u00ee. Kind\u00ee had argued in On First\nPhilosophy that any thing other than God that is called\n\u201cone\u201d is many as well as one, and therefore that it is one\nnot essentially but only accidentally, indeed that it is one only\nimproperly or \u201cmetaphorically\u201d; and he argues that such a\nthing can be one only through participation in some unity extrinsic to\nit, which (to avoid infinite regress) must be purely one and not also\nmany. Kind\u00ee also argues that any many is a collection of ones:\nand since everything is either one or many, and any many depends on\nones, and any one depends on a pure one, and God is the only\npure one, everything owes its existence directly or indirectly to God.\nWhile Kind\u00ee, like F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, gives a long list of\ndifferent kinds of things that can be said to be one, and while he has\ndifferent reasons for disqualifying each of them from being a pure\none, i.e., a one that is not also many, typically he seems to think\nthat each of these senses of \u201cone\u201d is predicated of some\nsubject which is many, so that if the unity were removed, that\nunderlying multiplicity would remain. Kind\u00ee infers that each of\nthese ones is a many-that-is-one, and therefore that it has contrary\nattributes, and therefore that it is not essentially one, and even\nthat it is only metaphorically one, since (as he argues in a tradition\ngoing back to Zeno of Elea and to the first Hypothesis of\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides) for something to be truly one is\nfor it not to be many in any way, e.g., by having many\n constituents.[34]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee by contrast maintains, following Aristotle in\nMetaphysics IV,2, that unity is coextensive with being, and\nthat both \u201cone\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d are truly and\nproperly said of many things. Indeed, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims,\nnot just that these many things are each truly being and truly one,\nbut that they are essentially so, i.e., that they are not\nbeing and one [mawj\u00fbd, w\u00e2\u1e25id]\nthrough an existence or unity [wuj\u00fbd,\nwa\u1e25da] which is accidental to them or extrinsic to\ntheir quiddity, as something is white through an accident of\nwhiteness. There are senses of being, notably being as the true, in\nwhich existence is accidental, but in the primary sense of being, and\nthe sense of primary interest to the metaphysician, the things\u2019s\nexistence is its quiddity or part of its quiddity; and so too,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims, for the unity corresponding to the\nsense of \u201cone\u201d of primary interest to the metaphysician,\nwhich is convertible with this sense of \u201cbeing\u201d. In order\nfor F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to deflect Kind\u00ee\u2019s arguments\nagainst the claim that there are many things that are each truly and\nessentially one, it is crucial for him not only to distinguish\ndifferent senses of \u201cone\u201d, but also to distinguish\ndifferent ways that senses of \u201cone\u201d can be related to\nsenses of \u201cmany\u201d. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee distinguishes\nbetween a many that is the subject of a one, a many that is\nopposite to a one, and a many that arises from a\none. When F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that some sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d is the opposite of some sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, he apparently means that these kinds of unity and\nmultiplicity are contraries or that one of them is the privation of\nthe other. When he talks about a many that arises from a one,\nhe seems to mean what Aristotle calls a many that is \u201cmeasured\nby\u201d a one, i.e., a many composed out of ones of this type, so\nthat the one or unit can be used to count the many. (Aristotle says in\nMetaphysics X that in this kind of one-many\nrelationship the unity and the multiplicity are correlatives,\nas the measure and the measured, whereas when one and many are related\nas indivisible and divisible, unity as indivisibility is a\nprivation of multiplicity as divisibility. Or perhaps he\nreally means that, although from the point of view of our language and\nour concepts divisibility is the more basic and indivisibility is its\nprivation, in reality indivisibility is basic and divisibility is its\nprivation. In Aristotle\u2019s terminology, possession and privation\nare one kind of opposites, contraries are another, contradictories are\nanother, and correlatives are yet another. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently does not count correlatives here\nas opposites.)\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee grants to his implicit opponent that some\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d do presuppose a many as their subject, so\nthat if the one were removed the many would remain. There are\ntwo-place senses of \u201cone\u201d, as there are two-place senses\nof \u201cbeing\u201d: for instance, we can say \u201cX and\nY are one in species\u201d. Or perhaps it is better to say,\nnot that these are two-place senses of \u201cone\u201d, but that\nthey are plural-subject senses, since we can equally well say\n\u201cX and Y and Z are one in\nspecies\u201d. In any case F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee grants that there\nare several senses of \u201cone\u201d which presuppose a many as\ntheir subject. Perhaps surprisingly, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee includes\nhere not only \u201cone in species\u201d and the like but also\n\u201cone in number\u201d: he thinks that the appropriate expression\nis not, e.g., \u201cAristotle is one in number\u201d but\n\u201cPlato\u2019s best student and Alexander\u2019s teacher are\none in number\u201d. Also perhaps surprisingly, he tries to trace\nback the other plural-subject senses of \u201cone\u201d to\n\u201cone in number\u201d, saying for instance that if X\nand Y are one in species, then the species of X and\nthe species of Y are one in number (#1\u2013#8).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also grants that there are some senses even\nof the one-place predication \u201cX is one\u201d which\npresuppose, not a plural subject, but still a subject consisting of\nmany parts, so that for X to be one is for X\u2019s\nparts to be related in an appropriate way. For instance, for\nX to be one as continuous is for X to have parts\nwhose limits are the same; for X to be one as contiguous is\nfor X to have parts whose limits, while not the same, are\nkept in contact by some bond; for X to be one as whole as for\nX to have all the parts it needs in order to perform its\nactivity well (#9\u2013#15). But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that\nwhere many things are said to be one, or where something is said to be\none in a way presupposing that it has many parts, this sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d and this sense of \u201cone\u201d are not\nopposite: nothing is predicated of its opposite. Thus the opposite of\none-in-number is many-in-number, but the subject of one-in-number is\nmany names or descriptions of the same thing; the opposite of\none-as-continuous is discretely many things disconnected from each\nother, but the subject of one-as-continuous is magnitude.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee insists equally emphatically that there are\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d that are not plural-subject senses and do\nnot presuppose a subject with many parts, and indeed in some cases\ncontradict having a subject with many parts. One sense of\n\u201cone\u201d is as \u201cundivided\u201d or\n\u201cindivisible\u201d (the Arabic phrase, like the Greek word, is\nambiguous between these two construals). Or perhaps rather, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee suggests at the end of the treatise, all\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d can be traced back in one way or another\nto being undivided (#95). Certainly there are many ways that something\ncould be divided, and filling them out leads to different senses of\none-as-undivided or one-as-indivisible. For instance, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee notes, \u201cone\u201d is said of something\nextended that is divisible but not actually divided; of something that\nis spatially located but quantitatively indivisible, i.e., a point; of\nwhat is not spatially located and is therefore quantitatively\nindivisible; of what has (or is) a simple quiddity not divisible into\nparts of a definition such as genus and differentia; and of what is\nnot \u201cdivided\u201d between a paronymously named subject\nX and an X-ness through which it is X\n(#20\u201324). Some of these senses of \u201cone\u201d, such as one\nin the sense of an indivisible point, are never predicated of\na many. Something can also be called one because it does not have a\npartner, i.e., because is the only F, for some predicate F,\nor if nothing else is F in the same way that it is F; and especially\nif F is its quiddity, as, e.g., the moon can be called\n\u201cone\u201d in the sense that there is nothing else of the same\nspecies as it (#25, pp.55\u20136). This sense of \u201cone\u201d,\ntoo, does not presuppose any plurality in its subject.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also talks about different senses of\n\u201cone\u201d as \u201ccircumscribed\u201d in some way (see\nbelow): at least some of these senses do not presuppose any plurality\nin their subject, and apparently in all these senses, if the subject\nthat is one were stripped of its unity, it would not become many\ninstead. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently does not say that\n\u201cone\u201d in such a sense does not have an opposite, but it\ndoes not have an opposite that is a sense of \u201cmany\u201d: the\nopposite of \u201cone\u201d in such a sense would be the\ncontradictory, \u201cnot one\u201d, but not a contrary or\nprivative \u201cmany\u201d.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also insists that the many arising\nfrom some sense of \u201cone\u201d, i.e., a many composed out\nof things that are each one in this sense, is not the many\nopposite to this sense of \u201cone\u201d, although he\nadmits that in some cases the many arising from the one and the many\nopposite to the one are the same per accidens\n(#37\u2013#49). As before, there are senses of \u201cone\u201d that\ndo not have an opposite sense of \u201cmany\u201d. There are also\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d that do have an opposite sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d, but where the many that arises from the one is not\nthe same as the many that is opposite to the one. Thus the many\narising from the one as a point (the one as what is indivisible\nalthough spatially located) is many points, while the opposite of the\none as a point is a continuous extension. The many arising from the\none as having-no-partner-in-its-species might be a plurality like a\nunique moon and a unique sun (or a unique phoenix), each without a\npartner in its distinct species, whereas the opposite of\nhaving-no-partner-in-its-species is having-a-partner-in-its-species.\nThe opposite of the one as indivisible quiddity is a divisible\nquiddity; the many arising from the one as indivisible quiddity is\nseveral indivisible quiddities, which could be a divisible\nquiddity if, say, one of them is an unanalyzable genus and the others\nare successive unanalyzable differentiae of that genus, but the\nseveral indivisible quiddities need not be a single quiddity\nat all. But, beyond these examples, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nbasic point is that, in the many arising from a one, the one\nis an essential constituent of the many, \u201ca part by which its\nconstitution [is]\u201d (#62, p.75): and so it can no more be\nopposite to this one than a species can be opposite to its constituent\ngenera and differentiae. And likewise, if a one, in some sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, is what it is by being a unit, a constituent of a\nmany, then it cannot be opposite to that many, even if there is some\nother sense of \u201cmany\u201d which is its opposite.\n\nWhen F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that there are senses of\n\u201cone\u201d which do not presuppose any plurality and which have\nno opposite except a bare contradictory\u2014so that there is no\nsense of \u201cmany\u201d opposite to these senses of\n\u201cone\u201d, although there is a sense of \u201cmany\u201d\narising from each such sense of \u201cone\u201d\u2014he is\ninterested above all in the sense of \u201cone\u201d as\n\u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d (first introduced #17).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not assume that the reader will already\nbe familiar with this analysis of a special sense of\n\u201cone\u201d: he tries to build up to it from other senses of\n\u201cone\u201d as \u201ccircumscribed\u201d in some other way. He\nstarts by talking about a \u201cbody circumscribed by a limit that\nspecifies [takhu\u1e63\u1e63u] it\u201d (#16, p.50).\n\u201cCircumscribed\u201d here has a straightforward literal sense:\nthe body is surrounded on all sides by its limit or boundary.\n\u201cSpecifies\u201d adds that everything inside that limit is the\nbody, and everything outside that limit is not the body. This may\nconnect with \u201cone\u201d as having no partner in some property,\nsince the body is the only thing inside its limit.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee passes from \u201cone\u201d as a body to a\ncircumscribed by a limit to \u201cone\u201d as a body circumscribed\nby a place, where a body\u2019s place is, on the Aristotelian\nanalysis, not the limit of the body itself but the limits of the\nbodies that surround it. Here again, everything that is in the place\nis the body, and everything that is not in the place is not the body.\nThus the limit, or the place, contributes in two ways to making the\nbody one: it makes the parts of the body one with each other, and it\nmakes the body one body distinguished from other bodies, with which it\nyields the many that \u201carises from\u201d this sense of one. The\nunity [wa\u1e25da] corresponding to these senses of\n\u201cone\u201d [w\u00e2\u1e25id] is presumably the\ncircumscription [in\u1e25iy\u00e2z] by the limit or the\nplace, which is an accident of an underlying\n subject.[35]\n But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee denies that if this unity were removed,\nits subject would thereby become a many: rather, it would fuse with\nother things into a larger one when the circumscription separating\nthem from each other is removed (#28). Still, these kinds of unity do\nalso unify a divisible subject, as do the unity of what is\none as continuous or contiguous or whole. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nis building up to a less familiar but more fundamental, non-spatial\nkind of circumscription which has only the function of distinguishing\na one from other ones and not the function of uniting a plurality.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee talks about the circumscription of a thing by\nany attribute, which would include limits and places and other\naccidents such as qualities (some examples at #78), but he\nconcentrates overwhelmingly on the circumscription of a thing by its\nquiddity. This can happen at different levels of generality\u2014it\ncan be a specific or a generic quiddity (#27). What is circumscribed\nby a quiddity, unlike what is circumscribed by a limit or a place,\nneed not be a body and need not be divisible, but can be as general as\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cthing\u201d (#64). In some cases, if a\nthing\u2019s circumscription by its quiddity were removed, it would\nfuse into a one with other ones when it the attributes distinguishing\nit from these others are removed, as a body circumscribed by a limit\nor place would fuse into a one with other bodies when its\ncircumscription by its limit or place is removed. If a thing\u2019s\ncircumscription by its specific quiddity were removed, it would still\nbe circumscribed by its generic quiddity, and would fuse into a one\nwith the other things in its genus, but if all\ncircumscription by a quiddity were removed from it, there would no\nlonger be anything left at all (#27). So there is no opposite to this\nsense of \u201cone\u201d except sheer non-being (#27): there is a\nsense of \u201cmany\u201d arising from this sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, but it is not opposite to this sense of\n\u201cone\u201d (#49). The cases of circumscription by a limit or a\nplace might wrongly lead us to think that whenever something is called\n\u201cone\u201d its unity is an accident attaching to some\nunderlying subject, but in the present case if the unity were removed\nthe quiddity would be destroyed. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does seem to\ndistinguish a thing\u2019s unity in this sense from its quiddity when\nhe says that the unity of a species, as circumscribed by its specific\nquiddity, is the differentia by which it is circumscribed from other\nspecies of its genus (#78): but this is still essential to the thing,\nand we know from the Book of Letters that the differentia can\nbe called the existence of the thing, as here it is called the unity\nof the thing.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that what is one in the strongest\n[a\u1e25r\u00e2] sense is what is circumscribed by a\nquiddity (#78). He says equally that what is circumscribed by a\nquiddity is \u201ccircumscribed by its portion [or allotment] of\nexistence [qis\u1e6d al-wuj\u00fbd]\u201d (#17), i.e., by\nits being what it is: this being-what-it-is is described in the\nBook of Letters as the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nthe thing, and On the One and Unity argues that it is also\nthe thing\u2019s unity [wa\u1e25da].\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee uses this analysis to try to make good on\nAristotle\u2019s programmatic claim in Metaphysics IV,2 that\nbeing and one are mutually entailing and in a way equivalent, or that\nthere is a sense of \u201cbeing\u201d and a sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, or a family of senses of \u201cbeing\u201d and a\ncorresponding family of senses of \u201cone\u201d which are mutually\nentailing and in a way equivalent. Thus here in On the One\n#17 he says that \u201cone\u201d in this meaning, i.e., the\nmeaning \u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d, is mutually\nentailing or equivalent [mus\u00e2wiq] with being. So\n\u201cone\u201d in this sense needs to apply to things in all\ncategories, not just substances, and indeed F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nsays that in #17, and he adds that it also applies to \u201cother\nthings, if there are any outside the categories\u201d (#17, p.51,\ncompare the Book of Letters on a possible ascent to a first\ncause of being to substances which would itself be outside all\ncategories including substance). Again, if \u201cone\u201d in this\nsense is necessarily coextensive with being, F\u00e2r\u00e2bi needs\nto say that not only species and genera but also individual substances\n(and individual qualities and so on) are each circumscribed by their\nown quiddity\u2014not merely by a shared quiddity and an individual\nplace or other accidental attributes\u2014so that there are\nmany things in each species, in the sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d arising from this sense of \u201cone\u201d.\n\n\nThe meaning [ma\u02bfn\u00e2] of human [i.e., the species\nhuman] is circumscribed and isolated from what is not human, i.e.,\nhorse and so on, and this human is circumscribed from\nthat human by a circumscription more perfect [or complete]\nthan the circumscription of human from horse. (#64, p.78)\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is thus committed to individual quiddities,\neven though our language does not allow us to formulate a\ndefinition of any individual. \u201cEvery being and every\nthing must have no partner in something which is attributed to\nit\u201d (#26, p.56), and \u201chaving no partner\u201d in turn is\nmutually entailing or equivalent [mus\u00e2wiq] with\n\u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d (#26, p.57).\n\n\n\u201cOne\u201d is said of everything that is circumscribed by a\nquiddity which specifies it [takhu\u1e63\u1e63uhu] and an\nexistence which specifies it, by which it is circumscribed from\neverything other than it, and it is one by a unity which is that by\nwhich it is circumscribed from other things. And if the quiddity of\neach thing is circumscribed from other things only by some category,\nit [i.e., this sense of \u201cone\u201d] is equivalent to the\n\u201cbeing\u201d that signifies the categories, and to whatever\nelse is equivalent to \u201cthing\u201d. (#94,\n pp.101\u2013102)[36]\n\n\nThus F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analyses of the senses of\n\u201cbeing\u201d in the Book of Letters, and of the senses\nof \u201cone\u201d in On the One, give the basis for his\naccount of a \u201ctranscendental\u201d sense of \u201cone\u201d\nin which it is mutually entailing with \u201cbeing\u201d, and also\nfor his account of how unity and existence are predicated of God (see\nthe next section): once we distinguish the different senses, and\nunderstand how they are related, we will see that circumscription by a\nquiddity is both the strongest sense of existence and the strongest\nsense of unity. And since every being in every category, individual or\nuniversal, is circumscribed by a quiddity,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analysis allows him to vindicate his\nclaim against Kind\u00ee that each of these things is truly one, and\nindeed essentially one.\n",
