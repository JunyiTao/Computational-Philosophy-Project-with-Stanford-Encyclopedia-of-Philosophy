    "main_text": "Search Engine Development and Evolution: A Short History || The Early Internet (pre-Web) Era (1980s)\n2.2 The Early Internet (pre-Web) Era (1980s)\n\n\nBy the 1960s, plans for developing a vast network of computer networks\n(i.e., what was eventually to become the Internet) were well\nunderway. And by 1970, work had begun on the ARPANET (Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency Network), which is commonly viewed as the\npredecessor of the Internet. This US-based project was funded by DARPA\n(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) into the late 1980s, when\nthe National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) took over the project\n(Spinello 2011). Although multiple computer networks existed during\nthis period, they were not easily able to communicate and exchange\ndata with one another; a common protocol was needed for the various\nnetworks to exchange data between systems. The Transmission Control\nProtocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) architecture was eventually\nselected as the standard protocol for the newly emerging\nInternet. With the implementation of this new standard, there was\nconsiderable optimism (especially among many in the academic research\ncommunity) about the potential for sharing the data that resided in\nthe various computers systems comprising the fledgling\nInternet. However, one very important challenge still remained: How\ncould Internet users locate the rich resources potentially available\nto them? To do this, a sophisticated search program/utility,\nwith a robust indexing system, was needed to point to the available\ncomputer databases that existed and to identify the content that\nresided in those databases. The first indexes on the Internet were\nfairly primitive, and as Halavais (2009) points out, \u201chad to be\ncreated by hand.\u201d\n\n\nWith TCP/IP now in place, privately owned computer\nnetworks\u2014including LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide\narea networks)\u2014were able to communicate with one another and, in\nprinciple at least, also able to exchange vast amounts of information\nover the network. However, another protocol\u2014one that would be\nlayered on top of TCP/IP\u2014was needed to accomplish this\nobjective. So, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), a client/server-based\nsystem, was developed and implemented in response to this need. To\nexchange or share files with a fellow Internet user in this scheme,\none first had to set up an FTP\n server.[1]\n Users could then upload files to and\nretrieve them from an FTP server, via an FTP client. Perhaps more\nimportantly, they could also now effectively\nsearch for files with one of the newly developed search\nengines, the first of which was called ARCHIE.\n\n\nThe ARCHIE search engine enabled users to enter queries based on a\nlimited set of features\u2014mainly \u201cfile names.\u201d\nARCHIE\u2019s searchable database of file names was comprised of the\nfile directory listings of hundreds of systems available to public FTP\nservers (and eventually to \u201canonymous\u201d FTP servers as\nwell). In the early 1990s, two other search engines were also fairly\nprominent: VERONICA (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-Wide Index to\nComputer Archives) and JUGHEAD (Jonzy\u2019s Universal Gopher\nHierarchy Excavation and Display). Both VERONICA and JUGHEAD had an\nadvantage over the ARCHIE search engine in that they were able to\nsearch for plain-text files, in addition to searching for file names.\nThese two search engines also worked in connection with a system called\nGOPHER. According to Halavais (2009, 22), GOPHER\u2019s\n\u201cmenu-driven approach\u201d to search helped to bring\n\u201corder to the Internet,\u201d since users \u201ccould now\nnavigate through menus that organized documents.\u201d\n\n\nSome of the technological breakthroughs that occurred during the\nearly-Internet era of search engine development exacerbated a\nprivacy-related ethical issue examined in Section 3. \nSpecifically,\nInternet-wide search functions, enabled by compliance with the TCP/IP\nand FTP protocols, dramatically increased the scope of the\nprivacy-and-monitoring concerns (initially generated in the\npre-Internet era via applications such as the UNIX \u201cFinger\u201d\nutility) that we examine in Sections 3.2\n and\n 3.3. Additionally,\n\u201canonymous\u201d FTP servers, also developed in this period,\nmade it possible for technically-savvy users to upload proprietary\nfiles, such as copyrighted software applications, on to the Internet\n(with anonymity). And the indexing schemes supported by the ARCHIE and\nGOPHER search systems enabled users to search for and download/share\nthose proprietary files with relative anonymity. Although intellectual\nproperty issues are not included among the ethical concerns examined in\nSection 3, it is worth noting that the\ndevelopment of some search-engine-related applications during this era\npaved the way for the kinds of illegal file-sharing practices\ninvolving copyrighted music that arose in connection with the Napster\nsite in the late 1990s. (The controversial Napster web site was one of\nthe first, as well as the most popular, sites used by many young\npeople at that time to exchange proprietary music online with their\nfriends).\n",
