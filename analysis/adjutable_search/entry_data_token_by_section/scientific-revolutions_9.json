    "main_text": "Kuhn\u2019s Later Account of Scientific Revolutions\n4. Kuhn\u2019s Later Account of Scientific Revolutions\n\nIn \u201cThe Road Since Structure,\u201d his 1990 Presidential\nAddress to the Philosophy of Science Association, Kuhn reported on a\nbook in progress, a project that would remain unfinished at his death.\n(See also Kuhn 1993.) In this and other fragments of that work, he\ndevelops the biological metaphor broached at the end of\nStructure. He retains his old parallel to biological\nevolution, that science progresses or evolves away from its previous\nforms rather than toward a final truth about the world; but he now\nextends the biological analogy by regarding scientific specialties\nthemselves as akin to biological species that carve out research and\nteaching niches for themselves. In the process, he significantly\nmodifies his conception of scientific revolutions and attendant claims\nconcerning crises and incommensurable breaks. No longer do we hear of\nrevolutions as paradigm change, certainly not in the sense of large\nparadigms. In fact, Kuhn prefers to speak of \u201cdevelopmental\nepisodes\u201d instead of revolutions. However, he does retain\nsomething of his original idea of small paradigms, the concrete\nproblem solutions that he had termed \u201cexemplars\u201d in the\n\u201cPostscript-1969\u201d to Structure. Most revolutions,\nhe tells us, are not major discontinuities in which a successor theory\noverturns and replaces its predecessor. Rather, they are like\n(allopatric) biological speciation, in which a group of organisms\nbecomes reproductively isolated from the main population.\n\n\n[R]evolutions, which produce new divisions between fields in\nscientific development, are much like episodes of speciation in\nbiological evolution. The biological parallel to revolutionary change\nis not mutation, as I thought for many years, but speciation. And the\nproblems presented by speciation (e.g., the difficulty in identifying\nan episode of speciation until some time after it has occurred, and\nthe impossibility even then, of dating the time of its occurrence) are\nvery similar to those presented by revolutionary change and by the\nemergence and individuation of new scientific specialties.\n\u2026\n\nThough I greet the thought with mixed feelings, I am increasingly\npersuaded that the limited range of possible partners for fruitful\nintercourse is the essential precondition for what is known as\nprogress in both biological development and the development of\nknowledge. When I suggested earlier that incommensurability, properly\nunderstood, could reveal the source of the cognitive bite and\nauthority of the sciences, its role as an isolating mechanism was\nprerequisite to the topic I had principally in mind. \u2026 [Kuhn\n2000, 98\u201399]\n\n\nIn short, specialization is speciation, a scientific progress\nheightens communication breakdown. Experts doing similar kinds of\nresearch come to realize that their use of key taxonomic terms no\nlonger jibes with mainline usage, in the sense that what Kuhn calls\n\u201cthe no overlap principle\u201d is violated: the group is using\na taxonomic hierarchy for crucial kind terms and the associated\ncategories that is incompatible with that of the established\ntradition. The group splits off and forms a distinct specialty with\nits own professional journals, conferences, etc., while leaving the\nrest of the field largely intact. The incommensurability is now a\nlocal, community-licensed, taxonomic one that creates something of a\nbarrier to communication with neighboring specialties. One thinks, for\nexample, of the way different biological specialties employ the\nspecies concept itself, and the concept of gene. This linguistic\nsensitivity as a group identifier permits the kind of fullness of\ncommunication, both linguistic and practical, within the group that\nKuhn had stressed already in Structure and thus permits the\ngroup to progress more rapidly. This multiplication of specialties is\nthe key to Kuhn\u2019s new conception of scientific progress. Two\nrecent books that directly engage these issues are Andersen et al.\n(2006) and Wray (2011), the first from a cognitive science point of\nview, the second with emphasis on Kuhn\u2019s social epistemology.\nSee also Nersessian (2003, 2008) and Kuukkanen (2012).\n\nAnother striking fact about Kuhn\u2019s last project is the demotion\nto \u201ca historical perspective\u201d of the history of science as\na detailed source of data or phenomena upon which philosophers of\nscience should draw. While Structure was already a curious\nmix of an inductive, history-based, bottom-up approach to modeling\nscientific development and a more formal, top-down approach based on\nKuhn\u2019s Kantianism (see below), he now concludes that his core\nposition follows from first principles alone.\n\nWith much reluctance I have increasingly come to feel that this\nprocess of specialization, with its consequent limitation on\ncommunication and community, is inescapable, a consequence of first\nprinciples. Specialization and the narrowing of the range of expertise\nnow look to me like the necessary price of increasingly powerful\ncognitive tools. [2000, p. 98]\n\n\nThus Kuhn\u2019s new emphasis is on synchronic revolutions, in which\na field splits into subfields, rather than on the diachronic\nreplacement of one paradigm complex by another that his early account\nfeatured. His conception of a science is therefore less monolithic. A\nvibrant field such as evolutionary biology can tolerate several\ndistinct species concepts at the same time, a fact that contributes\nrather than detracts from its vibrancy. The overall result is a less\ntightly integrated, less dogmatic conception of normal science under\nan overarching paradigm, a view that has implications also for the\nnecessity and size of future revolutions. For no longer need an\nesoteric discrepancy get the leverage to trigger a crisis that\neventuates in the replacement of an entire, tightly integrated system.\nIn this respect, Kuhn\u2019s conception of physics becomes somewhat\ncloser to Godfrey-Smith\u2019s characterization of progress in\nbiology as \u201ca deluge\u201d rather than a full-scale Kuhnian\nrevolution (see below and Godfrey-Smith 2007). Given that progress in\nbiological evolution is better regarded as the remarkable\nproliferation of intricate, useful design rather than movement toward\na goal, the explicit parallels that Kuhn draws to biological evolution\nsuggest that he is moving toward the same conception of scientific\nprogress as some see in biological evolution\u2014as the\nproliferation of adaptive design. We may know more about his final\nposition once more of the book manuscript, left incomplete at his\ndeath, is published.\n",
