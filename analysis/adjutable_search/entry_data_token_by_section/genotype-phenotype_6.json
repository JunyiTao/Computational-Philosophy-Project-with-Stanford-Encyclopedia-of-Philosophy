    "main_text": "From Mendelian Research and Models to the Present: Advances, Ambiguities and Persisting Questions || Identification of Phenotypes and Genotypes\u2014Complications\n3.2 Identification of Phenotypes and Genotypes\u2014Complications \n\nMendelian methods of inference based on a small set of traits and\npairs of genes were complicated by phenomena that came to be called\nepistasis, expressivity, penetrance, and incomplete dominance and, to\na lesser extent, by a background level of mutation for any gene being\nstudied. Muriel Wheldale\u2019s genetic analysis of the color of\nsnapdragon flowers, for example, showed that plants with one or more\ndominant alleles (i.e., variants of the gene) at a certain locus would\nshow color patterns that she was able to associate with the genotype\nat three other loci, but plants with two recessive alleles at the\nfirst locus would be white no matter what\u2014the homozygote\nrecessive genotype had an epistatic effect over the other\ngenotypes. A range of phenotypes may be shown to correspond to the\nsame genotype\u2014expressivity. A phenotype that is\nassociated with a certain genotype may be observed for only a fraction\nof individuals in or with that genotype\u2014penetrance.\nWith respect to expressivity and penetrance, researchers try to link\nthe observed variation to conditions occurring during development,\nstochastic developmental noise, or differences remaining at loci not\nunder study, and to decide where in the range of the trait, say,\nmelanin pigmentation, to demarcate one phenotype from another.\nIncomplete dominance means the occurrence of an intermediate\nphenotype (e.g., pink snapdragon flowers resulting from crosses of\nwhite and red inbred lines). \n\nIncomplete dominance removed some of the ambiguities in using\nphenotypes to distinguish genotypes, but the combination of the four\nphenomena and linkage for multiple loci meant that Mendelian\nresearchers had to distinguish among multiple hypotheses about the\ngenotypes consistent with observed patterns of traits in the offspring\nof crosses. Background levels of mutation, including mutations in\nnon-germ cells during the lifetime, ensure that even\ngenotypes-as-classes consisting of clones or of identical or\nmonozygotic twins are not made up of strictly identical\nmembers. Nevertheless, with suitable organisms and for certain traits,\nand under the inbreeding and control of conditions typical of\nMendelian experiments, the painstaking work of inferring genotypes (as\npairs of genes) from phenotypes could bear fruit.\n",
