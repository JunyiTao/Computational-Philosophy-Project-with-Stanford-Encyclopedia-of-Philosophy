Humean Supervenience\n\nRather than detailing all the critical issues that divide the\nsystems approach and the universals approach, attention has been on\nthe divisive issue of supervenience (i.e., determination). It concerns\nwhether Humean considerations really determine what the laws are.\nThere are some important examples that appear to show that they do\nnot.\n\n\nSuppose that there are ten different kinds of fundamental particles.\nSo, there are fifty-five possible kinds of two-particle interactions.\nSuppose that fifty-four of these kinds have been studied and\nfifty-four laws have been discovered. The interaction of X\nand Y particles have not been studied because conditions are\nsuch that they never will interact. Nevertheless, it seems that it\nmight be a law that, when X particles and Y\nparticles interact, P occurs. Similarly it might be a law\nthat when X and Y particles interact, Q\noccurs. There seems to be nothing about the local matters of\nparticular fact in this world that fixes which of these\ngeneralizations is a law (Tooley 1977, 669).\n\n\nThe failure of supervenience arises in other cases. Consider the\npossibility that there is a lone particle traveling through otherwise\nempty space at a constant velocity of, say, one meter per second. It\nseems that this might just be a nearly empty Newtonian universe in\nwhich it is accidentally true that all bodies have a velocity of one\nmeter per second; it just so happens that there is nothing to alter\nthe particle\u2019s motion. But, it might also be the case that this\nworld is not Newtonian and that it is a law that all bodies have\nvelocity at one meter per second; it could be that this generalization\nis not accidental and would have held true even if there were other\nbodies slamming into the lone particle. (Earman 1986, 100; Lange 2000,\n85\u201390.)\n\nMaudlin presses the case against the Humeans by focusing on the common\npractice among physicists of considering models of a theory\u2019s\nlaws.\n\nMinkowski space-time, the space-time of Special Relativity, is a model\nof the field equations of General Relativity (in particular, it is a\nvacuum solution). So an empty Minkowski space-time is one way the\nworld could be if it is governed by the laws of General Relativity.\nBut is Minkowski space-time a model only of the General\nRelativistic laws? Of course not! One could, for example, postulate\nthat Special Relativity is the complete and accurate account of\nspace-time structure, and produce another theory of gravitation, which\nwould still have the vacuum Minkowski space-time as a model. So under\nthe assumption that no possible world can be governed by the laws of\nGeneral Relativity and by a rival theory of gravity, the total\nphysical state of the world cannot always determine the laws (2007,\n67).\n\n\nThe suggestion here is that there is the possibility of a matter-less\nuniverse with the laws of General Relativity and another with laws of\na conflicting theory of gravitation. (For additional examples, see\nCarroll 1994, 60\u201380). What Maudlin sees as a consequence of\nstandard scientific reasoning, Humeans will see as an example exposing\nthe absurdity of nonsupervenience.\n\nHumeans contend that the various pairs of so-called possible worlds\nare not really possible. Sometimes this contention turns on the issue\nof whether laws govern, sometimes on epistemological or ontological\nconcerns, and sometimes on concerns about about how our language\nworks. One objection to the nonsupervenience arguments from the Humean\ncamp is that, if one comes to the debate with the governing conception\nin mind, one is likely to find the antisupervenience examples\nconvincing, but using this conception to reject Humean analyses of\nlawhood is somehow to beg the question or to otherwise be unconvincing\nbecause it is a conception Humeans reject (Beebee, 2000). (Also see\nLoewer 1996 and Roberts 1998.) In contrast, some are sympathetic to\nHumeanism and aspects of the governing conception (Schneider 2007,\nWard 2007, Roberts 2008). In particular, when we consider laws\ngoverning the nation, the laws don\u2019t do anything to the\ngoverned. What governs is the government that creates and\nenforces the laws. \u201cThe proposition that we call the law is not\nthe agent of the governing, but the content of the governing\u201d\n(Roberts 2008, 46).\n\nSome argue based on skeptical considerations that their brand of\nHumean supervenience is true (Earman and Roberts 2005ab). Others\nreject skeptical concerns (Schaffer 2008, 94\u201399, Carroll\n2008, 75\u201379). Schaffer presses an ontological concern\nto the effect that nonsupervening laws are ungrounded entities\n(Schaffer 2008, 84\u201385).\n\nAn original manner of responding to apparent counterexamples to\nsupervenience takes a semantic turn. In the lone-particle example\nreported above, there is a world with the lone particle traveling at\none meter per second, though it is not a law that all particles travel\nat that speed. There is also a world with the lone particle traveling\nat one meter per second, though it is a law that all particles are\ntraveling at that speed. This reasoning does not contradict\nsupervenience because of the context sensitivity of the predicate,\n\u2018is a law\u2019. Though the sentence, \u2018It is a law that\nall particles travel at one meter per second\u2019 is (i) true\nrelative to one context/world pair and (ii) false relative to a\ndifferent context/world pair. This difference in truth-value could\nmerely be the result of a difference between two contexts (Roberts\n2008, 357\u201361).\n\nFor Roberts, a possible world w in which there exists only a\nsingle particle traveling at constant velocity throughout all of\nhistory and relative to a context in which the salient theory is, say,\nNewtonian Mechanics, \u2018It is a law that all particles have a\nconstant velocity of one meter per second\u2019 is true just in case\nthe reference of the \u2018that\u2019 clause plays the law role in\nthe salient theory, which it doesn\u2019t in this case. It might\nplay the law role relative to some other theory, but this would\nbe a different context. A single generalization cannot\nboth play the law role and also not play the law role relative to a\nsingle theory, and so a different salient theory and so a different\ncontext is required for \u2018It is a law that all bodies travel at\none meter per second\u2019 to be true (Roberts 2008, 357\u201361). \nWhat is enticing about this reply is that it does not reject any\nintuitive claim about the laws in the various possible worlds. The\nantisupervenience judgments about what are the laws are reasonable\nclaims given the contexts. It is just that there is a failure to\nrecognize the influence of context. So, for example, Maudlin\u2019s\nso-called two possibilities would be seen by Roberts as descriptions\nof a single possibility that are made relative to two contexts with\ndifferent salient theories: General Relativity and some rival theory\nof gravity. (Parallel points could be made about Tooley\u2019s\nexamples involving the 10 different kinds of fundamental particles.)\nThe key is the context sensitivity that is built into the truth\nconditions of lawhood sentences. Other views that take lawhood\nsentences to be context sensitive might also be able to avail\nthemselves of Roberts\u2019 challenge to the antisupervenience\nexamples. What is not compelling about Roberts\u2019 position,\nthough, is his view on the context dependence of lawhood ascriptions.\nHis view is devised for one particular phrase of English:\n\u2018law of nature\u2019, but it would be better if the\ncontextual treatment of \u2018law of nature\u2019 melded neatly\nwith the context dependence of other natural language words and\nphrases. We should try to understand the context dependence of our\n\u2018law of nature\u2019 talk by appeal to linguistic principles,\nand the investigation should be driven by considerations of\nconversational practice (Carroll 2018, 131\u201332). \u2018Law of\nnature\u2019 should not be an isolated freak of our language\n(cf., Unger 1971, 202) on the verb \u2018to know\u2019.\n",
