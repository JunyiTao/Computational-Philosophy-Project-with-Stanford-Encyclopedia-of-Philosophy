    "main_text": "Better with Bounds || Homo Statisticus and Small Samples\n5.1 Homo Statisticus and Small Samples\n\nIn a review of experimental results assessing human statistical\nreasoning published in the late 1960s that took stock of research\nconducted after psychology\u2019s full embrace of statistical\nresearch methods\n (section 2.3),\n Petersen and Beach argued that the normative standard of probability\ntheory and statistical optimization methods were \u201ca good first\napproximation for a psychological theory of inference\u201d (Peterson\n& Beach 1967: 42). Petersen and Beach\u2019s view that humans\nwere intuitive statisticians that closely approximate the\nideal standards of homo statisticus fit into a broader\nconsensus at that time about the close fit between the normative\nstandards of logic and intelligent behavior (Newell & Simon 1956,\n1976). The assumption that human judgment and decision-making closely\napproximates normative theories of probability and logic would later\nbe challenged by experimental results by Kahneman and Tversky, and the\nbiases and heuristics program more generally\n (section 7.1).\n\nAmong Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s earliest findings was that people\ntend to make statistical inferences from samples that are too small,\neven when given the opportunity to control the sampling procedure.\nKahneman and Tversky attributed this effect to a systematic failure of\npeople to appreciate the biases that attend small samples, although\nHertwig and others have offered evidence that samples drawn from a\nsingle population are close to the known limits to working memory\n(Hertwig, Barron et al. 2004).\n\nOverconfidence can be understood as an artifact of small samples. The\nNa\u00efve Sampling Model (Juslin, Winman, & Hansson\n2007) assumes that agents base judgments on a small sample retrieved\nfrom long-term memory at the moment a judgment is called for, even\nwhen there are a variety of other methods available to the agent. This\nmodel presumes that people are na\u00efve statisticians (Fiedler &\nJuslin 2006) who assume, sometimes falsely, that samples are\nrepresentative of the target population of interest and that sample\nproperties can be used directly to yield accurate estimates of a\npopulation. The idea is that when sample properties are uncritically\ntaken as estimators of population parameters a reasonably accurate\nprobability judgment can be made with overconfidence, even if the\nsamples are unbiased, accurately represented, and correctly processed\nby the cognitive mechanisms of the agent. When sample sizes are\nrestricted, these effects are amplified.\n\nHowever, sometimes effective behavior is aided by inaccurate judgments\nor cognitively adaptive illusions (Howe 2011). The statistical\nproperties of small samples are a case in point. One feature of small\nsamples is that correlations are amplified, making them easier to\ndetect (Kareev 1995). This fact about small samples, when combined\nwith the known limits to human short-term memory, suggests that our\nworking-memory limits may be an adaptive response to our environment\nthat we exploit at different stages in our lives. Adult short-term\nworking memory is limited to seven items, plus or minus two. For\ncorrelations of 0.5 and higher, Kareev demonstrates that sample sizes\nbetween five and nine are most likely to yield a sample correlation\nthat is greater than the true correlation in the population (Kareev\n2000), making those correlations nevertheless easier to detect.\nFurthermore, children\u2019s short-term memories are even more\nrestricted than adults, thus making correlations in the environment\nthat much easier to detect. Of course, there is no free lunch: this\nsmall-sample effect comes at the cost of inflating estimates of the\ntrue correlation coefficients and admitting a higher rate of false\npositives (Juslin & Olsson 2005). However, in many contexts,\nincluding child development, the cost of error arising from\nunder-sampling may be more than compensated by the benefits from\nsimplifying choice (Hertwig & Pleskac 2008) and accelerating\nlearning. In the spirit of Brunswik\u2019s argument for\nrepresentative experimental design\n (section 3.2),\n a growing body of literature cautions that the bulk of experiments on\nadaptive decision-making are performed in highly simplified\nenvironments that differ in important respects from the natural world\nin which human beings make decisions (Fawcett et al. 2014). In\nresponse, Houston, MacNamara and colleagues argue, we should\nincorporate more environmental complexity in our models.\n",
