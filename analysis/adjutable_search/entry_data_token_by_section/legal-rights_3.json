    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Form || Legal Rights to Do Legal Wrongs\n3.2 Legal Rights to Do Legal Wrongs\n\nOne particularly puzzling combination of Hohfeldian relations is a\n\u201cright to do wrong\u201d. There is of course nothing puzzling\nin rights of one normative kind to violate duties of another normative\nkind. For example, legal rights to do that which one has a moral duty\nnot to do are not uncommon (such as exploiting tax havens). Yet, the\nidea of a right of one normative kind to do wrong of the same\nnormative kind can seem oxymoronic. \n\nAnd still, for many an essential feature of rights is providing for\ndoing even what one ought not to do. Dworkin, for example, explains\nthat:\n\n\n\u2026 when I say you have the right to spend your money gambling,\nthough you ought to spend it in a more worthwhile way. I mean that it\nwould be wrong for anyone to interfere with you even though you\npropose to spend your money in a way that I think is wrong. (1977:\n188) \n\n\nAnd Raz claims that \u201c[t]o show that one has a right to perform\nthe act is to show that even if it is wrong he is entitled to perform\nit\u201d (1979: 274).\n\nConceptually, the Hohfeldian analysis of rights as well as the\n\u201cfunctions\u201d of rights (see\n Section 4)\n seem to allow for rights to do wrong (Waldron 1981; Kramer 1998:\n14\u201317; Enoch 2002). X holds a right to do wrong if\nX has a claim against Y (and Y is under a\ncorrelative duty to X) that Y somehow facilitate or not\ninterfere with X doing something that X has a duty not\nto do. In Hohfeldian terms, rights to do wrong are claim-rights\nwithout privileges (Waldron 1981; George 1993: 118\u2013122). To\ndispel the sense of contradiction in the term \u201cright to do\nwrong\u201d, one needs to recognize that a right (claim-right) to do\nwrong does not bear on the rightness or the wrongness (lack of\nprivilege) of that which one has a (claim-)right to do. Arguably,\nimmunities can also function as rights to do wrong, as they secure a\nmeasure of freedom (relative to others) from intervention with\none\u2019s doing that which one has duty not to do (Herstein 2014:\n37\u201345).\n\nMoving from conceptual possibility to morality, while clearly there is\nno blanket moral right to do moral wrong, some argue that such rights\nare not a mere conceptual possibility. For example, even if one has a\nmoral duty (lack of privilege) not to join a bigoted association,\narguably one enjoys a moral claim protective of one\u2019s (wrongful)\nchoice to do so. Among the values claimed to ground such rights are\npersonal autonomy (Waldron 1981: 34\u201335; 1983: 325\u2013337;\nEnoch 2002: 379\u2013380; Herstein 2012: 354\u2013357); personal\nintegrity (George 1993: 124\u2013125); moral constitution of self\n(Herstein 2012, 357\u2013364); and of conscience (Brownlee, 2012:\n126\u2013128). In contrast, others deny morality contains rights to\ndo wrong (Galston 1983; \u00d8verland 2007; Bolinger 2017).\n\nNow to law. The concept of \u201clegality\u201d does not seem to\nrule out legal rights to do legal wrongs (Herstein 2014: 27\u201331;\nLaborde 2021: 6\u20137). And, as a conceptual matter, there can be\nlegal rights providing legal protections (claims, immunities) to do\nthat which the law forbids (Kramer 1998, 15\u201317; Herstein 2014:\n32\u201345). In contrast, Laborde argues for a\n\u201ctoleration\u201d conception of legal rights to do legal wrong,\nwherein right-holders are exempt (privilege) from legal prohibition on\n\u03c6-ing, yet remain vulnerable to expressive sanctions for \u03c6-ing\n(2021). Examples offered in the literature of legal rights to do legal\nwrong include diplomatic immunity (Herstein 2014: 43\u201344) and\nministerial exemptions (Laborde 2021).\n",
