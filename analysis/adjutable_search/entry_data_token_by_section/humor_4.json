Humor as Play, Laughter as Play Signal\n\nWhile the Incongruity Theory made humor look less objectionable than\nthe Superiority Theory did, it has not improved philosophers\u2019\nopinions of humor much in the last two centuries, at least judging\nfrom what they have published. Part of the continued bad reputation of\nhumor comes from a new objection triggered by the Incongruity Theory:\nIf humor is enjoying the violation of our mental patterns and\nexpectations, then it is irrational. This Irrationality Objection is\nalmost as old as the Incongruity Theory, and is implicit in\nKant\u2019s claim that the pleasure in laughter is only physical and\nnot intellectual. \u201cHow could a delusive expectation\ngratify?\u201d he asks. According to Kant, humor feels good in spite\nof, not because of, the way it frustrates our desire to understand.\nGeorge Santayana (1896, 248) agreed, arguing that incongruity itself\ncould not be enjoyed. \n\n\nWe have a prosaic background of common sense and everyday reality;\nupon this background an unexpected idea suddenly impinges. But the\nthing is a futility. The comic accident falsifies the nature before\nus, starts a wrong analogy in the mind, a suggestion that cannot be\ncarried out. In a word, we are in the presence of an absurdity, and\nman, being a rational animal, can like absurdity no better than he can\nlike hunger or cold.\n\n\nIf the widespread contemporary appreciation of humor is defensible,\nthen this Irrationality Objection needs to be addressed. To do that\nseems to require an explanation of how our higher mental functions can\noperate in a beneficial way that is different from theoretical and\npractical reasoning. One way to construct that explanation is to\nanalyze humor as a kind of play, and explain how such play can be\nbeneficial. \n\nRemarkably few philosophers have even mentioned that humor is a kind\nof play, much less seen benefits in such play. Kant spoke of joking as\n\u201cthe play of thought,\u201d though he saw no value in it beyond\nlaughter\u2019s stimulation of the internal organs. One of the few to\nclassify humor as play and see value in the mental side of humor was\nThomas Aquinas. He followed the lead of Aristotle, who said in the\nNicomachean Ethics (Ch. 8) that \u201cLife includes\nrest as well as activity, and in this is included leisure and\namusement.\u201d Some people carry amusement to\nexcess\u2014\u201cvulgar buffoons,\u201d Aristotle calls\nthem\u2014but just as bad are \u201cthose who can neither make a\njoke themselves nor put up with those who do,\u201d whom he calls\n\u201cboorish and unpolished.\u201d Between buffoonery and\nboorishness there is a happy medium\u2014engaging in humor at the\nright time and place, and to the right degree. This virtue Aristotle\ncalls eutrapelia, ready-wittedness, from the Greek for\n\u201cturning well.\u201d In his Summa Theologiae (2a2ae,\nQ. 168) Aquinas extends Aristotle\u2019s ideas in three articles:\n\u201cWhether there can be virtue in actions done in play,\u201d\n\u201cThe sin of playing too much,\u201d and \u201cThe sin of\nplaying too little.\u201d He agrees with Aristotle that humor and\nother forms of play provide occasional rest:\n\n\nAs bodily tiredness is eased by resting the body, so psychological\ntiredness is eased by resting the soul. As we have explained in\ndiscussing the feelings, pleasure is rest for the soul. And therefore\nthe remedy for weariness of soul lies in slackening the tension of\nmental study and taking some pleasure\u2026 . Those words and deeds\nin which nothing is sought beyond the soul\u2019s pleasure are called\nplayful or humorous, and it is necessary to make use of them at times\nfor solace of soul (2a2ae, Q. 168, Art. 2).\n\n\nBeyond providing rest for the soul, Aquinas suggests that humor has\nsocial benefits. Extending the meaning of Aristotle\u2019s\neutrapelia, he talks about \u201ca eutrapelos, a\npleasant person with a happy cast of mind who gives his words and\ndeeds a cheerful turn.\u201d The person who is never playful or\nhumorous, Aquinas says, is acting \u201cagainst reason\u201d and so\nis guilty of a vice.\n\n\nAnything conflicting with reason in human action is vicious. It is\nagainst reason for a man to be burdensome to others, by never showing\nhimself agreeable to others or being a kill-joy or wet blanket on\ntheir enjoyment. And so Seneca says, \u201cBear yourself with wit,\nlest you be regarded as sour or despised as dull.\u201d Now those who\nlack playfulness are sinful, those who never say anything to make you\nsmile, or are grumpy with those who do (2a2ae, Q. 168, Art. 4).\n\n\nIn the last century an early play theory of humor was developed by Max\nEastman (1936), who found parallels to humor in the play of animals,\nparticularly in the laughter of chimps during tickling. He argues that\n\u201cwe come into the world endowed with an instinctive tendency to\nlaugh and have this feeling in response to pains presented\nplayfully\u201d (45). In humor and play generally, according to\nEastman, we take a disinterested attitude toward something that could\ninstead be treated seriously. \n\nIn the late 20th century Ted Cohen (1999) wrote about the\nsocial benefits of joke-telling, and many psychologists confirmed\nAquinas\u2019 assessment of humor as virtuous. A chapter in the\nAmerican Psychological Association\u2019s Character Strengths and\nVirtues: A Handbook and Classification, under \u201cStrengths of\nTranscendence,\u201d is \u201cHumor [Playfulness].\u201d Engaging\nin humor can foster a tolerance for ambiguity and diversity, and\npromote creative problem-solving. It can serve as a social lubricant,\nengendering trust and reducing conflict. In communications that tend\nto evoke negative emotions--announcing bad news, apologizing,\ncomplaining, warning, criticizing, commanding, evaluating--humor can\nprovide delight that reduces or even blocks negative emotions.\nConsider this paragraph from a debt-collection letter:\n\n\nWe appreciate your business, but, please, give us a break. Your\naccount is overdue ten months. That means we\u2019ve carried you\nlonger than your mother did (Morreall 2009, 117).\n\n\nPlay activities such as humor are not usually pursued in order\nto achieve such benefits, of course; they are pursued, as Aquinas\nsaid, for pleasure. A parallel with humor here is music, which we\ntypically play and listen to for pleasure, but which can boost our\nmanual dexterity and even mathematical abilities, reduce stress, and\nstrengthen our social bonds. \n\nEthologists (students of animal, including human, behavior) point out\nthat in play activities, young animals learn important skills they\nwill need later on. Young lions, for example, play by going through\nactions that will be part of hunting. Humans have hunted with rocks\nand spears for tens of thousands of years, and so boys often play by\nthrowing projectiles at targets. Marek Spinka (2001) observes that in\nplaying, young animals move in exaggerated ways. Young monkeys leap\nnot just from branch to branch, but from trees into rivers. Children\nnot only run, but skip and do cartwheels. Spinka suggests that in play\nyoung animals are testing the limits of their speed, balance, and\ncoordination. In doing so, they learn to cope with unexpected\nsituations such as being chased by a new kind of predator.\n\nThis account of the value of play in children and young animals does\nnot automatically explain why humor is important to adult humans, but\nfor us as for children and young animals, the play activities that\nseem the most fun are those in which we exercise our abilities in\nunusual and extreme ways, yet in a safe setting. Sports is an example.\nSo is humor. \n\nIn humor the abilities we exercise in unusual and extreme ways in a\nsafe setting are related to thinking and interacting with other\npeople. What is enjoyed is incongruity, the violation of our mental\npatterns and expectations. In joking with friends, for example, we\nbreak rules of conversation such as these formulated by H. P. Grice\n(1975):\n\n Do not say what you believe to be false.\n Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\n Avoid obscurity of expression.\n Avoid ambiguity.\n Be brief.\n\n\nWe break Rule 1 when for a laugh we exaggerate wildly, say the\nopposite of what we think, or \u201cpull someone\u2019s leg.\u201d\nWe break Rule 2 when we present funny fantasies as if they were facts.\nRule 3 is broken to create humor when we reply to an embarrassing\nquestion with an obviously vague or confusing answer. We violate Rule\n4 in telling most prepared jokes, as Victor Raskin (1984) has shown. A\ncomment or story starts off with an assumed interpretation for a\nphrase, but then at the punch line, switches to a second, usually\nopposed interpretation. Consider the line \u201cI love cats. They taste a lot like chicken.\u201d Rule 5 is broken when we turn an ordinary\ncomplaint into a comic rant like those of Roseanne Barr and Lewis\nBlack. \n\nHumor, like other play, sometimes takes the form of activity that\nwould not be mistaken for serious activity. Wearing a red clown nose\nand making up nonsense syllables are examples. More often, however, as\nin the conversational moves above, humor and play are modeled on\nserious activities. When in conversation we switch from serious\ndiscussion to making funny comments, for example, we keep the same\nvocabulary and grammar, and our sentences transcribed to paper might\nlook like bona-fide assertions, questions, etc. This similarity\nbetween non-serious and serious language and actions calls for ways\nthat participants can distinguish between the two. Ethologists call\nthese ways \u201cplay signals.\u201d \n\nThe oldest play signals in humans are smiling and laughing. According\nto ethologists, these evolved from similar play signals in pre-human\napes. The apes that evolved into Homo sapiens split off from\nthe apes that evolved into chimpanzees and gorillas about six million\nyears ago. In chimps and gorillas, as in other mammals, play usually\ntakes the form of mock-aggression such as chasing, wrestling, biting,\nand tickling. According to many ethologists, mock-aggression was the\nearliest form of play, from which all other play developed (Aldis\n1975, 139; Panksepp 1993, 150). In mock-aggressive play, it is\ncritical that all participants are aware that the activity is not real\naggression. Without a way to distinguish between being chased or\nbitten playfully and being attacked in earnest, an animal\nmight respond with deadly force. In the anthropoid apes, play signals\nare visual and auditory. Jan van Hooff (1972, 212\u2013213) and\nothers speculate that the first play signals in humans evolved from\ntwo facial displays in an ancestor of both humans and the great apes\nthat are still found in gorillas and chimps. One was the \u201cgrin\nface\u201d or \u201csocial grimace\u201d: the corners of the mouth\nand the lips are retracted to expose the gums, the jaws are closed,\nthere is no vocalization, body movement is inhibited, and the eyes are\ndirected toward an interacting partner. This \u201csilent bared-teeth\ndisplay,\u201d according to van Hooff (1972, 217), evolved into the\nhuman social smile of appeasement. \n\nIn the other facial display, the lips are relaxed and the mouth open,\nand breathing is shallow and staccato, like panting. This vocalization\nin chimpanzees is on the in-breath: \u201cAhh ahh ahh.\u201d\nAccording to van Hooff, this \u201crelaxed open-mouth display\u201d\nor \u201cplay face\u201d evolved into human laughter. The relaxed\nmouth in laughter contrasts with the mouth in real aggression that is\ntense and prepared to bite hard. That difference, combined with the\ndistinctive shallow, staccato breathing pattern, allows laughter to\nserve as a play signal, announcing that \u201cThis is just for fun;\nit\u2019s not real fighting.\u201d Chimps and gorillas show that\nface and vocalization during rough-and-tumble play, and it can be\nelicited in them by the playful grabbing and poking we call tickling\n(Andrew 1963). \n\nAs early hominin species began walking upright and the front limbs\nwere no longer used for locomotion, the muscles in the chest no longer\nhad to synchronize breathing with locomotion. The larynx moved to a\nlower position in the throat, and the pharynx developed, allowing\nearly humans to modulate their breathing and vocalize in complex ways\n(Harris 1989, 77). Eventually they would speak, but before that they\ncame to laugh in our human way: \u201cha ha ha\u201d on the\nout-breath instead of \u201cahh ahh ahh\u201d on the in-breath.\n\nIn the last decade, thinkers in evolutionary psychology have extended\nvan Hooff\u2019s work, relating humor to such things as sexual\nselection (Greengross 2008; Li et al. 2009). In the competition for\nwomen to mate with, early men may have engaged in humor to show their\nintelligence, cleverness, adaptability, and desire to please\nothers.\n\nThe hypothesis that laughter evolved as a play signal is appealing in\nseveral ways. Unlike the Superiority and Incongruity Theories, it\nexplains the link between humor and the facial expression, body\nlanguage, and sound of laughter. It also explains why laughter is\noverwhelmingly a social experience, as those theories do not.\nAccording to one estimate, we are thirty times more likely to laugh\nwith other people than when we are alone (Provine 2000, 45). Tracing\nlaughter to a play signal in early humans also accords with the fact\nthat young children today laugh during the same\nactivities\u2014chasing, wrestling, and tickling\u2014in which\nchimps and gorillas show their play face and laugh-like vocalizations.\nThe idea that laughter and humor evolved from mock-aggression,\nfurthermore, helps explain why so much humor today, especially in\nmales, is playfully aggressive. \n\nThe playful aggression found in much humor has been widely\nmisunderstood by philosophers, especially in discussions of the ethics\nof humor. Starting with Plato, most philosophers have treated humor\nthat represents people in a negative light as if it were real\naggression toward those people. Jokes in which blondes or Poles are\nextraordinarily stupid, blacks extraordinarily lazy, Italians\nextraordinarily cowardly, lawyers extraordinarily self-centered, women\nextraordinarily unmathematical, etc. have usually been analyzed as if\nthey were bona fide assertions that blondes or Poles are\nextraordinarily stupid, blacks extraordinarily lazy, etc. This\napproach is announced in the title of Michael Philips\u2019\n\u201cRacist Acts and Racist Humor\u201d(1984). Philips classifies\nPolish jokes as racist, for example, but anyone who understands their\npopularity in the 1960s, knows that they did not involve hostility\ntoward Polish people, who had long been assimilated into North\nAmerican society. Consider the joke about the Polish astronaut calling\na press conference to announce that he was going to fly a rocket to\nthe sun. When asked how he would deal with the sun\u2019s intense heat,\nhe said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go at night.\u201d To\nenjoy this joke, it is not necessary to have racist beliefs or\nattitudes towards Poles, any more than it is necessary to believe that\nPoland has a space program. This is a fantasy enjoyed for its clever\ndepiction of unbelievable stupidity. \n\nWhile playing with negative stereotypes in jokes does not require\nendorsement of those stereotypes, however, it still keeps them in\ncirculation, and that can be harmful in a racist or sexist culture\nwhere stereotypes support prejudice and injustice. Jokes can be\nmorally objectionable for perpetuating stereotypes that need to be\neliminated. More generally, humor can be morally objectionable when it\ntreats as a subject for play something that should be taken seriously.\n(Morreall 2009, ch. 5). Here humor often blocks compassion and\nresponsible action. An egregious example is the cover of the July 1974\nNational Lampoon magazine, titled the \u201cDessert\nIssue.\u201d A few years earlier George Harrison and other musicians\nhad organized a charity concert to benefit the victims of a famine in\nBangladesh. From it they produced the record album  Concert for\nBangladesh. The album cover featured a photograph of a starving\nchild with a begging bowl. The photo on the cover of National\nLampoon\u2019s \u201cDessert Issue\u201d was virtually the\nsame, only it was of a chocolate sculpture of a starving\nchild, with part of the head bitten off. \n\nHaving sketched an account of humor as play with words and ideas, we\nneed to go further in order to counter the Irrationality Objection,\nespecially since that play is based on violating mental patterns and\nexpectations. What must be added is an explanation of how playfully\nviolating mental patterns and expectations could foster rationality\nrather than undermine it. \n\nPart of rationality is thinking abstractly\u2014in a way that is not\ntied to one\u2019s immediate experience and individual perspective.\nIf at a dinner party I spill a blob of ketchup on my shirt that looks\nlike a bullet hole, I could be locked into a Here/Now/Me/Practical\nmode in which I think only about myself and my soiled shirt. Or I\ncould think about embarrassing moments like this as experienced by\nmillions of people over the centuries. More abstract still would be to\nthink, as the Buddha did, about how human life is full of\nproblems.\n\nIn the lower animals, mental processing is not abstract but tied to\npresent experience, needs, and opportunities. It is about nearby\npredators, food, mates, etc. When something violates their\nexpectations, especially something involving a potential or actual\nloss, their typical reaction is fear, anger, disgust, or sadness. These\nemotions evolved in mammals and were useful for millions of years\nbecause they motivate adaptive behavior such as fighting, fleeing, avoiding noxious substances, withdrawing from activity, and avoiding similar situations in the\nfuture.\n\nFear, anger, disgust, and sadness are still sometimes adaptive in humans: A\nsnarling dog scares us, for example, and we move away quickly,\navoiding a nasty bite. We scream and poke the eyes of a mugger, and he runs off. But if human mental development had not gone\nbeyond such emotions, with their Here/Now/Me/Practical focus, we would\nnot have become rational animals. What early humans needed was a way\nto react to the violation of their expectations that transcended their\nimmediate experience and their individual perspective. Humorous\namusement provided that. In the humorous frame of mind, we experience,\nthink about, or even create something that violates our understanding\nof how things are supposed to be. But we suspend the personal,\npractical concerns that lead to negative emotions, and enjoy the\noddness of what is occurring. If the incongruous situation is our own\nfailure or mistake, we view it in the way we view the failures and\nmistakes of other people. This perspective is more abstract,\nobjective, and rational than an emotional perspective. As the theme\nsong of the old Candid Camera television program used to say, we\n\u201csee ourselves as other people do.\u201d Instead of tensing up\nand preparing to run away or attack, we relax and laugh. In laughter,\nas Wallace Chafe said in The Importance of Not Being Earnest\n(2007), not only do we not do anything, but we are disabled as we lose\nmuscle control in our torsos, arms, and legs. In extremely heavy\nlaughter, we fall on the floor and wet our pants. \n\nThe nonpractical attitude in humor would not be beneficial, of course,\nif I were in imminent danger. If instead of ketchup, I spilled\nsulfuric acid on my shirt, the Here/Now/Me/Practical narrow focus of\nfear would be preferable to the disengaged, playful attitude of humor.\nWhen immediate action is called for, humor is no substitute. But in\nmany situations where our expectations are violated, no action would\nhelp. In the Poetics (5, 1449a) Aristotle said that what is\nfunny is \u201ca mistake or unseemliness that is not painful or\ndestructive.\u201d But people have joked about problems as grave as\ntheir own impending death. As he approached the gallows, Thomas More\nasked the executioner, \u201cCould you help me up. I\u2019ll be able\nto get down by myself.\u201d On his deathbed, the story goes, Oscar\nWilde said: \u201cThis wallpaper is atrocious. One of us has to\ngo.\u201d\n\nNot only does such joking foster rationality and provide pleasure, but\nit reduces or eliminates the combination of fear and/or anger called\n\u201cstress,\u201d which is at epidemic levels in the\nindustrialized world. In fear and anger, chemicals such as\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol are released into the blood,\ncausing an increase in muscle tension, heart rate, and blood pressure,\nand a suppression of the immune system. Those physiological changes\nevolved in earlier mammals as a way to energize them to fight or flee,\nand in early humans, they were usually responses to physical dangers\nsuch as predators or enemies. Today, however, our bodies and brains\nreact in the same way to problems that are not physically threatening,\nsuch as overbearing bosses and work deadlines. The increased muscle\ntension, the spike in blood pressure, and other changes in stress not\nonly do not help us with such problems, but cause new ones such as\nheadaches, heart attacks, and cancer. When in potentially stressful situations\nwe shift to the play mode of humor, our heart rate, blood pressure,\nand muscle tension decrease, as do levels of epinephrine,\nnorepinephrine, and cortisol. Laughter also increases pain tolerance\nand boosts the activity of the immune system, which stress suppresses\n(Morreall 1997, ch. 4; Morreall 2016, ch. 5\u20136). \n\nA century ago, when psychologists still talked like philosophers, an\neditorial in the American Journal of Psychology (October\n1907) said of humor that \u201cPerhaps its largest function is to\ndetach us from our world of good and evil, of loss and gain, and to\nenable us to see it in proper perspective. It frees us from vanity, on\nthe one hand, and from pessimism, on the other, by keeping us larger\nthan what we do, and greater than what can happen to us.\u201d\n",
