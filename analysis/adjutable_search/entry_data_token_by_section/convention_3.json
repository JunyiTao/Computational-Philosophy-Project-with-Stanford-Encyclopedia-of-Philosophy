    "main_text": "Truth by convention\n2. Truth by convention\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s conventionalism was the culmination of the logical\npositivists\u2019 efforts to accommodate logic and\nmathematics within an empiricist setting. Rejecting the Kantian\nsynthetic a priori, the positivists held that logic and\nmathematics were analytic. Kant had explained the\n analytic-synthetic distinction\n in terms of concept-containment, which struck the positivists as\npsychologistic and hence \u201cunscientific.\u201d The positivists\ninstead treated analyticity as \u201ctruth by virtue of\nmeaning.\u201d Specifically, they treated it as the product of\nlinguistic convention. For instance, we can adopt the stipulative\nconvention that \u201cbachelor\u201d means \u201cunmarried\nman.\u201d \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried men\u201d is true by\nvirtue of this convention. The positivists sought to extend this\nanalysis to far less trivial examples, most notably mathematical and\nlogical truth. In this regard, they were heavily influenced by Gottlob\nFrege\u2019s logicism and also by Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s conception,\ndeveloped in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, of logical\ntruths as tautologous and contentless (sinnloss). Alberto\nCoffa (1993), Michael Friedman (1999), and Warren Goldfarb (1997)\noffer detailed discussion of the role played by conventionalism in\nlogical positivism.\n\n\nAlthough initially attracted to Carnap\u2019s conventionalism, W.V.\nQuine eventually launched a sustained attack on it in \u201cTruth by\nConvention\u201d (1935) and \u201cCarnap and Logical Truth\u201d\n(1963). Quine\u2019s anti-conventionalist arguments, in conjunction\nwith his attack upon the analytic-synthetic distinction, profoundly\nimpacted metaphysics and epistemology, casting conventionalist theories\nof logic, mathematics, and ontology into general disrepute.\n\n\nOne of the Quine\u2019s most widely cited arguments (1936),\ndirected against a crude conventionalism about logic, traces back to\nLewis Carroll. There are infinitely many logical truths. Human beings\nare finite, so we can explicitly stipulate only a finite number of\nstatements. Thus, in generating all the logical truths we must\neventually apply rules of inference to finitely many conventionally\nstipulated statements. But then we are employing logic to derive logic\nfrom convention, generating a vicious regress. Quine\u2019s point here\nis not just that logic did not in fact come into existence\nthrough conventional truth assignment. His point is that it could\nnot have thus come into existence.\n\n\nTo avoid the Quinean regress, one might propose that we\nconventionally stipulate a finite number of axioms and a\nfinite number of inferences rules, thereby fixing an infinite number of\nlogical truths. The question here is what it means to\n\u201cstipulate\u201d an inference rule. We can conventionally\nstipulate that we will henceforth obey a certain inference rule. But\nthat stipulation does not entail that we are entitled to\nreason in accord with the inference rule. Mere conventional stipulation\nthat we will henceforth obey a inference rule does not ensure that the\nrule carries truths into truths. What if we stipulate that the\ninference rule carries truths into truths? Then our stipulation is\nmerely another axiom. So we require a new inference rule to draw any\nconsequences from it, and the regress continues.\n\n\nWhile it is doubtful that Carnap or the other positivists held the\ncrude form of conventionalism attacked by Quine\u2019s argument, the\nargument suggests that conventionalism about logic requires an account\nof \u201ctacit\u201d conventions. If logic is indeed \u201ctrue by\nconvention,\u201d then some of the relevant conventions must\napparently be \u201cimplicit\u201d in our practice, rather than the\nresults of explicit stipulation. So we require an account of what an\n\u201cimplicit\u201d convention amounts to. Carnap offers no such\naccount. Jared Warren (2017) attempts to meet the challenge by developing an account of \u201cimplicit\u201d inference rules.\n\n\nAnother Quinean argument holds that \u201ctruth by\nconvention\u201d offers no explanatory or predictive advantage over\nthe far less exciting thesis that certain statements are true due to\nobvious features of extra-linguistic reality. For instance, we can all\nagree that linguistic convention makes it the case that\n\u201cEverything is identical to itself\u201d means what it does. But\nwhy should we furthermore hold that the truth of this sentence\nis due to linguistic convention, rather than to the fact that\neverything is indeed self-identical? According to Quine, Carnap has\noffered no reason for thinking that such truths are somehow vacuous as\nopposed to merely obvious.\n\n\nA final notable Quinean argument centers on the role of\n\u201cconventional stipulation\u201d in scientific theorizing.\nConsider a scientist introducing a new theoretical term by\ndefinitional stipulation. The new term is embroiled in an evolving\nbody of scientific doctrine. As this body of doctrine develops, the\noriginal legislated definition occupies no privileged status. We may\nreject it in light of new empirical developments. Thus,\n\u201cconventionality is a passing trait, significant at the moving\nfront of science but useless in classifying the sentences behind the\nlines\u201d (1954, p. 119). Hilary Putnam (1962) further develops\nthis argument, offering the example of \u201ckinetic energy\n\\(= \\bfrac{1}{2} mv^{2}\\)\u201d. Although that identity began\nas a stipulative definition in Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian\nmechanics deems it false. Inspired by such examples, Quine rejects as\nuntenable any distinction between statements \u201ctrue by\nconvention\u201d or otherwise.\n\n\nQuine therefore rejects Carnap\u2019s picture of science as a\ntwo-stage process: the first stage in which we conventionally stipulate\nconstitutive aspects of our scientific language (such as its ontology\nor logic) based solely upon pragmatic, non-rational factors; the second\nin which we deploy our language by subjecting non-conventional theories\nto rational scrutiny. For Quine, this two-stage picture does not\ndescribe even idealized scientific inquiry. There is no clear\nseparation between those aspects of theory choice that are solely\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d and those that are rational.\n\n\nThese and other Quinean arguments proved extremely influential.\nUltimately, many philosophers became convinced that Carnap\u2019s\nconventionalist program was fundamentally\n flawed.[3]\nThis reaction dovetailed with\nadditional developments inimical to conventionalism. For instance,\nHilary Putnam (1963, 1974) and various later philosophers, such as\nMichael Friedman (1983), vigorously attacked\ngeometric\n conventionalism.[4]\n\n\nOn the other hand, conventionalism still finds defenders. Lawrence\nSklar (1977) advocates a refurbished version of geometric\nconventionalism. Alan Sidelle (1989) advocates conventionalism about\nnecessary truth. Michael Dummett (1991), Christopher Peacocke (1987),\nand Dag Prawitz (1977) follow Gerhard Gentzen in treating certain\nfundamental inferences as \u201cimplicit definitions\u201d of the\nlogical connectives, a theory somewhat reminiscent of Carnap\u2019s\nconventionalism about logic. Jared Warren (2015) invokes implicit definition to elucidate arithmetical vocabulary, defending on that basis a conventionalist treatment of arithmetical truth. Thus, the issues raised by Quine remain\nunresolved. Still, it seems safe to say that philosophers nowadays\nregard conventionalist solutions within metaphysics and epistemology\nmore warily than philosophers from the pre-Quinean\n era.[5]\n",
