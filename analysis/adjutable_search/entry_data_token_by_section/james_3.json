Essays in Popular Philosophy\n\nJames\u2019s popular and influential, The Will to Believe and\nOther Essays in Popular Philosophy, published in 1897, collects\npreviously published essays from the previous nineteen years,\nincluding \u201cThe Sentiment of Rationality\u201d (discussed\nabove), \u201cThe Dilemma of Determinism,\u201d \u201cGreat Men and\nTheir Environment\u201d and \u201cThe Moral Philosopher and the\nMoral Life.\u201d The title essay\u2014published just two years\nearlier\u2014proved to be controversial for seeming to recommend\nirresponsible or irrationally held beliefs. James later wrote that he\nshould have called the essay \u201cthe right to\nbelieve,\u201d to indicate his intent to justify holding\ncertain beliefs in certain circumstances, not to claim that\nwe can (or should) believe things simply by an act of will.\n\nIn science, James notes, we can afford to await the outcome of\ninvestigation before coming to a belief, but in other cases we are\n\u201cforced,\u201d in that we must come to some belief even if all\nthe relevant evidence is not in. If I am on an isolated mountain\ntrail, faced with an icy ledge to cross, and do not know whether I can\nmake it, I may be forced to consider the question whether I can or\nshould believe that I can cross the ledge. This question is not only\nforced, it is \u201cmomentous\u201d: if I am wrong I may fall to my\ndeath, and if I believe rightly that I can cross the ledge, my holding\nof the belief may itself contribute to my success. In such a case,\nJames asserts, I have the \u201cright to\nbelieve\u201d\u2014precisely because such a belief may help bring\nabout the fact believed in. This is a case \u201cwhere a fact cannot\ncome at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming\u201d\n(WB, 25).\n\nJames applies his analysis to religious belief, particularly to the\npossible case in which one\u2019s salvation depends on believing in\nGod in advance of any proof that God exists. In such a case the belief\nmay be justified by the outcome to which having the belief\nleads.  He extends his analysis beyond the religious domain,\nhowever, to a wide range of secular human life:\n\nA social organism of any sort is what it is because each member\nproceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will\nsimultaneously do theirs\u2026. A government, an army, a commercial\nsystem, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on this\ncondition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is\neven attempted (WB 24).\n\n\nMoral questions too are both momentous and unlikely to be sustained by\n\u201csensible proof.\u201d They are not matters of science but of\n\u201cwhat Pascal calls our heart\u201d (WB 22). James defends our\nright to believe in certain answers to these questions anyway.\n\nAnother essay in the collection, \u201cReflex Action and\nTheism,\u201d attempts a reconciliation of science and religion.\nJames\u2019s expression \u201creflex action\u201d alludes to the\nbiological picture of the organism as responding to sensations with a\nseries of actions. In the higher animals a theoretical or thinking\nstage intervenes between sensation and action, and this is where, in\nhuman beings, the thought of God arises. James maintains that this\nthought is a natural human response to the universe, independent of\nany proof that God exists, and he predicts that God will be the\n\u201ccentre of gravity of all attempts to solve the riddle of\nlife\u201d (WB, 116). He ends the essay by advocating a\n\u201ctheism\u201d that posits \u201can ultimate opacity in things,\na dimension of being which escapes our theoretic control\u201d (WB\n143).\n\nThe Will to Believe also contains James\u2019s most\ndeveloped account of morality, \u201cThe Moral Philosopher and the\nMoral Life.\u201d  Morality for James rests on\nsentience\u2014without it there are no moral claims and no moral\nobligations. But once sentience exists, a claim is made, and morality\ngets \u201ca foothold in the universe\u201d (WB 198). Although James\ninsists that there is no common essence to morality, he does find a\nguiding principle for ethical philosophy in the principle that we\n\u201csatisfy at all times as many demands as we can\u201d (WB 205).\nThis satisfaction is to be achieved by working towards a \u201cricher\nuniverse\u2026the good which seems most organizable, most fit to\nenter into complex combinations, most apt to be a member of a more\ninclusive whole\u201d (WB 210). This work proceeds by a series of\nexperiments, by means of which we have learned to live (for the most\npart) without \u201cpolygamy and slavery, private warfare and liberty\nto kill, judicial torture and arbitrary royal power.\u201d (WB\n205) . However, James holds that there is \u201cnothing final in\nany actually given equilibrium of human ideals, [so that] as our\npresent laws and customs have fought and conquered other past ones, so\nthey will in their turn be overthrown by any newly discovered order\nwhich will hush up the complaints that they still give rise to,\nwithout producing others louder still\u201d (WB 206).\n\nJames\u2019s essay \u201cOn a Certain Blindness in Human\nBeings,\u201d published in his Talks to Teachers on Psychology\nand to Students on Some of Life\u2019s Ideals in 1899,\nillustrates another important element of James\u2019s moral outlook.\nThe blindness to which James draws attention is that of one human\nbeing to another, a blindness he illustrates with a story from his own\nlife. Riding in the mountains of North Carolina he comes upon a\ndevastated landscape, with no trees, scars in the earth, here and\nthere a patch of corn growing in the sunlight. But after talking to\nthe settlers who had cleared the forest to make room for their farm,\nJames comes to see it their way (at least temporarily): not as\ndevastation but as a manifestation of \u201cduty, struggle, and\nsuccess.\u201d James concludes: \u201cI had been as blind to the\npeculiar ideality of their conditions as they certainly would also\nhave been to the ideality of mine, had they had a peep at my strange\nindoor academic ways of life at Cambridge\u201d (TT 233\u20134).\nJames portrays a plurality of outlooks in the essay to which he\nattaches both a metaphysical/epistemological and an ethical import.\nThis plurality, he writes:\n\ncommands us to tolerate, respect, and indulge those whom we see\nharmlessly interested and happy in their own ways, however\nunintelligible these may be to us. Hands off: neither the whole of\ntruth nor the whole of good is revealed to any single observer,\nalthough each observer gains a partial superiority of insight from the\npeculiar position in which he stands. Even prisons and sick-rooms have\ntheir special revelations (TT 264).\n\n\nAlthough \u201cOn a Certain Blindness\u201d is about toleration and\nthe appreciation of different points of view, James sets out his own\nromantic point of view in his choice of heroes in the essay:\nWordsworth and Shelley, Emerson, and W. H. Hudson, all of whom are\nsaid to have a sense of the \u201climitless significance in natural\nthings\u201d (TT 244). Even in the city, there is \u201cunfathomable\nsignificance and importance\u201d (TT 254) in the daily events of the\nstreets, the river, and the crowds of people. James praises Walt\nWhitman, \u201ca hoary loafer,\u201d for knowing how to profit by\nlife\u2019s common opportunities: after a morning of writing and a\nbath, Whitman rides the omnibus down Broadway from 23rd street to\nBowling Green and back, just for the pleasure and the spectacle of it.\n\u201c[W]ho knows the more of truth,\u201d James asks,\n\u201cWhitman on his omnibus-top, full of the inner joy with which\nthe spectacle inspires him, or you, full of the disdain which the\nfutility of his occupation excites?\u201d (TT 252). James\u2019s\ninterest in the inner lives of others, and in writers like Tolstoy who\nshare his understanding of their \u201cmysterious ebbs and\nflows\u201d (TT 255), leads him to the prolonged study of human\nreligious experience that he presented as the Gifford Lectures in\n1901\u20132, published as The Varieties of Religious\nExperience in 1902.\n",
