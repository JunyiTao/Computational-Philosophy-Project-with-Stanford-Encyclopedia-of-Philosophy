    "main_text": "Metaphysical Solutions to the Central Problem || Comments on Metaphysical Solutions\n2.4 Comments on Metaphysical Solutions\n\nIf representative realism is the cause of the central epistemological\nproblem for perception, then perhaps direct realism or idealism will\nbe the solution. Some philosophers have thought that these\nmetaphysical views resolved the epistemological problem by closing the\ngap between appearance and reality, by making ordinary objects (e.g.,\ntables and rocks) directly present to the mind.\n\nOn further reflection, however, it is clear that the metaphysical\naccount will be, at best, a part of the solution.\n\nConsider again PEW:\n\nNothing is ever directly present to the mind in\nperception except perceptual appearances. (Indirectness\nPrinciple) Thus:\nWithout a good reason for thinking perceptual\nappearances are veridical, we are not justified in our perceptual\nbeliefs. (Metaevidential Principle)\nWe have no good reason for thinking perceptual\nappearances are veridical. (No-Good-Reason\nClaim)\nTherefore, we are not justified in our perceptual\nbeliefs.\n\n\nMost metaphysical solutions attack the Indirectness Principle as a way\nof undercutting the Metaevidential Principle. But they only attack\nmetaphysical readings of the Indirectness Principle, and while the\nvarious metaphysical theories of perception from sections\n 2.2\n and\n 2.3\n may have certain intuitive affinities with the Metaevidential\nPrinciple or its denial, it follows from Hume\u2019s \u201cno\nought from is\u201d dictum that none of them\nimmediately implies either premise\n (2)\n or its negation. Epistemological directness does straightforwardly\nentail the rejection of\n (2),\n but epistemological directness is compatible with any of the\nmetaphysical theories of perception glossed above and is entailed by\nnone of them. At best, a metaphysical theory of perception will block\none avenue of intuitive support for\n (2),\n but it will not imply that\n (2)\n is false.\n\nAn idealist, for example, will allow that we sometimes dream and that\nthere is a real difference between hallucination and veridical\nperception, even though in both cases the direct object of awareness\nis a collection of ideas. The standard view (Berkeley 1710) is that a\nhallucinatory table is a different sort of collection of\nideas than a real table; certain counterfactuals are true of the\nlatter that are not true of the former (e.g., that if I were to will\ncertain movements, my visual perceptions would change in certain ways,\netc.). But this reopens the gap between perceptual experiences and\nordinary objects. Tables are not just experiences; they are larger\nentities of which experiences are parts, and those parts can be shared\nby hallucinations. So what is directly present to the mind is\nsomething common to hallucination and veridical perception. So my\nperceptual experience would seem to be neutral with respect to whether\nI am seeing or hallucinating a table. So to be justified in believing\nthere is a table in front of me, I will need some reason to think this\nparticular experience is veridical, and PEW is back in business\n(Alston 1993, Greco 2000).\n\nDirect realism precludes this particular relapse into skepticism by\ndenying that the experience is the same in the good and the bad cases.\nIf our perceptual evidence includes the experience, then our evidence\nin the good case is different from our evidence in the bad\ncase\u2014they are different mental states. It does not follow,\nhowever, that these two bits of evidence have differing evidential\nimport; both may\u2014for all we\u2019ve been told so far\u2014be\nevidentially neutral with respect to, e.g., whether there is actually\na chair in front of me or whether it merely appears so. Even if they\nare very different mental states, it doesn\u2019t follow that they\nlicense different inferences; nothing prevents the direct realist from\nholding that both only license beliefs of the form \u2018I\u2019m\neither seeing or hallucinating a table\u2019. Additionally, the\ndirect realist is free to impose a metaevidential demand on justified\nperceptual belief, a demand that we know which kind of experience we\nare having before that experience can serve as evidence.\nUnsurprisingly, direct realists often endorse some kind or other of\nepistemological directness\n (section 3.3\n below), though some endorse the Metaevidential Principle, and in any\ncase, the metaphysical view is by itself silent on this\nepistemological issue.\n\nEven with the metaphysical premise\n (1)\n removed, a purely epistemological version of PEW, consisting of\n (2)\n through\n (4),\n still challenges the justification of our perceptual beliefs. A\nsatisfying solution to the problem of the external world requires the\narticulation of some plausible epistemic principles, one that explains\nwhich of the two crucial premises\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n of PEW are being rejected, and provides an epistemological context\nwhich renders that rejection plausible. An entirely metaphysical\nsolution to the problem of the external world will not suffice. An\nepistemological solution to this epistemological problem will be\nneeded in addition or instead.\n",
