    "main_text": "Quaker feminism\n3. Quaker feminism\n\n\nAs we have seen, Quaker preaching is not preaching in the\ntraditional sense of exhortation on scripture: \u201cFor it was not\nChrist nor the Apostles Practice to take others\nRecords & Writings that had been spoken from others,\u201d\nFell says, \u201cbut they spoke as the spirit gave them\nutterance\u201d (Fell 1660f, 4). In Fell\u2019s view, women can\njustifiably preach because true preaching does not require the\ntraditional book-learning of men, it requires only the light of Christ\nwithin. In their arguments, Fell and other Quaker authors repeatedly\ninvoke biblical quotations in support of the spiritual authority of\nwomen, such as the claims that \u201cthere is neither male nor female:\nfor ye are all one in Christ Jesus\u201d (Galatians 3:28), and that\n\u201cit shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour\nout of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall\nprophesy\u201d (Acts 2:17, quoting Joel 2:28). For many Quakers, the\nrise of the female preacher, like the conversion of the Jews, would be\na realization of millennial expectations about Christ\u2019s second\ncoming. In arguing thus, they were challenging widespread opposition to\nwomen\u2019s preaching at the time.\n",
