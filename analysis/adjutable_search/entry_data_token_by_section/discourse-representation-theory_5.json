    "main_text": "The DRS language: syntax, semantics, accessibility || Accessibility\n4.2 Accessibility\nAccessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and\nreflexive, i.e., it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the\nsmallest preorder for which the following holds, for all\nDRSs K, K\u2032,\nand K\u2033:\nif ConK\ncontains a condition of the form \u2026\n\n\u00acK\u2032,\n  then K is accessible\n  to K\u2032\nK\u2032\u2228K\u2033,\n  then K is accessible\n  to K\u2032\n  and K\u2033\nK\u2032\u21d2K\u2033,\n  then K is accessible\n  to K\u2032\n  and K\u2032 is accessible\n  to K\u2033\nK\u2032(\u2200x)K\u2033,\n  then K is accessible\n  to K\u2032\n  and K\u2032 is accessible\n  to K\u2033\n\nTo illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every\nDRS is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number doesn\u2019t\nprecede its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself):\n\n[1 \u2026 [2\n  \u2026 ](\u2200x)[3 \u2026 \u00ac[4\n  \u2026 ] ] ] \n[1 \u2026 [2\n  \u2026 ] \u21d2 [3 \u2026 \u00ac[4 \u2026\n  ] ] ] \n\nThe accessible domain of a\nDRS K, AK,\nis the set of discourse referents that occur in\nsome K\u2032 that is accessible\nto K,\ni.e., AK =\n{x:\u00a0 K\u2032 is accessible\nto K\nand x\n\u2208 UK\u2032}.\nThe main constraint which DRT imposes on the interpretation of\nanaphora is this:\n\nAccessibility constraint\n\nA pronoun is represented by a discourse\nreferent x which must be equated\nto some discourse referent y\n\u2208 AK,\nwhere K is the DRS in\nwhich x is introduced.\n\nIt is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility\nnor the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will\npresently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is\ninterpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate\nlogic).  Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility\nrelation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the\ntruth conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility\nconstraint is a semantic one.\nAs discussed in Section 2, the main syntactic constraint on\nbound-variable pronouns is that they be c-commanded by their\nantecedents. The domain of the accessibility constraint overlaps with\nthat of the c-command constraint, but it is wider. For one thing,\nsentence boundaries don\u2019t affect accessibility. For another, within\nthe confines of a sentence, the semantic correlate of an\nexpression E1 may be accessible to that\nof E2, even if E1 doesn\u2019t\nc-command E2.  To illustrate this point, consider\nthe conditional donkey sentence in [1a] and its sentence DRS in\n[1b]:\n\n[1a]\n[S\n[S If [S [NP\na farmer] [VP owns\n  a donkey]] [S\nhe beats\n it]\u2009]\n[1b]\n[1\n: [2 x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)] \u21d2\n[3 u, v: beats(u,v)] ]\n\nSyntactically speaking, neither \u201ca farmer\u201d nor \u201ca\ndonkey\u201d can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986) an expression\nbeyond the smallest clause in which they occur. In particular, neither\ncan bind any of the pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the\ndiscourse referents associated with these indefinites,\ni.e., x\nand y, are in the accessible\ndomain of [1b3], and therefore the anaphoric discourse\nreferents in this embedded DRS can be linked\nto x\nand y. Put otherwise, they are\nbindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic level.\n\n",
