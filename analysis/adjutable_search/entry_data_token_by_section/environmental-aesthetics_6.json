    "main_text": "Basic Orientations in Environmental Aesthetics\n3. Basic Orientations in Environmental Aesthetics\n\nAfter the emergence of environmental aesthetics as a significant area\nof philosophical research, some initial positions crystallized. In the\nlast part of the last century, these positions developed distinct\norientations concerning the aesthetic appreciation of natural\nenvironments. At that time, the positions were frequently\ndistinguished as belonging in one or the other of two groups,\nalternatively labeled cognitive and non-cognitive (Godlovitch 1994,\nEaton 1998, Carlson and Berleant 2004), conceptual and non-conceptual\n(Moore 1999), or narrative and ambient (Foster 1998). The distinction\nmarks a division between those points of view that take knowledge and\ninformation to be essential to aesthetic appreciation of environments\nand those that take some other feature, such as engagement, emotion\narousal, or imagination, to be paramount. The distinction thereby\ngives structure and organization to the diverse points of view\nrepresented in the field. Moreover, it is in line with similar\ndistinctions used in aesthetic theory concerning the appreciation of\nart, music, and literature.\n",
