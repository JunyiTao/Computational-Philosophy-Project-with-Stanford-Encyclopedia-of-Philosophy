    "main_text": "Philosophical Foundations\n2. Philosophical Foundations\n\nThe fa tradition is at times compared with modern social\nsciences (Schwartz 1985), and this comparison grasps well some of its\ncharacteristics. Angus C. Graham (1989: 269) notes that\n\u201cLegalists\u201d were the first political philosophers in China\n\u201cto start not from how society ought to be but how it is.\u201d\nIndeed, this was the most practical-oriented of all preimperial\nintellectual currents. Its proclaimed goal was to attain \u201ca rich\nstate and a strong army\u201d (fu guo qiang bing\n \u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175),[1]\n which would be the precondition for future unification of the entire\nsubcelestial realm. The thinkers\u2019 focus was on how to attain\nthis goal, and less on philosophical speculations. The fa\ntexts neither subordinate the political action to moralizing\ndiscourse, nor claim conformity to divine will\u2014topoi that recur\nin the writings of the followers of Confucius and Mozi. Cosmological\nstipulations of political order, which became hugely popular after the\n Laozi\n \u8001\u5b50 (fourth century BCE) are of slightly higher\nimportance for the fa thinkers: they are referred to in some\nof Shen Buhai and Shen Dao\u2019s fragments and, more notably, in\nseveral chapters of the Han Feizi. Yet these speculations are\nnot essential for these thinkers\u2019 arguments: hence, pace\nattempts to consider cosmological digressions of Han Feizi as\nfoundations of its political philosophy (Wang and Chang 1986), it\nwould be more accurate to see them as argumentative devices that were\n\u201cnot fully assimilated\u201d into Han Fei\u2019s thought\n(Graham 1991: 285; cf. Goldin 2020: 223\u201326). Generally, the\nfa texts display considerable philosophical sophistication\nonly when they have to justify departures from conventional approaches\nof other intellectual currents. In this regard their views of\nhistorical evolution and of human nature are highly engaging. These\nare the foundations for the overarching principle of the fa\nthought: the insistence on the rule by impartial standards as\nadvantageous over reliance on human factor in politics.\n",
