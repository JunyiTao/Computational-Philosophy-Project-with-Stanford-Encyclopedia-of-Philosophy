    "main_text": "Moral Status of Children\n9. Other Issues\n\nThe topics discussed above hardly exhaust the philosophy of childhood.\nThus, we have said nothing about, for example, philosophical\nliterature on personhood as it bears on questions about the morality\nof abortion, or bioethical discussions about when it is appropriate\nfor parents to consent to children\u2019s participation in medical\nresearch or refuse medical treatment of their children. There has been\nincreasing attention in recent years to questions about the\nappropriate limits of parental authority over children, about the\nsource and extent of parents and the state\u2019s responsibilities\nfor children, and about the moral permissibility of parents devoting\nsubstantial resources to advancing the life prospects of their\nchildren. These and many other topics concerning children may be\nfamiliar to philosophers as they get discussed in other contexts,\nparticularly within family ethics and bioethics. Discussing them under\nthe rubric, \u2018philosophy of childhood,\u2019 as well in the\nother contexts, may help us see connections between them and other\nphilosophical issues concerning children.\n",
