    "main_text": "Marriage and Morals || Contractual Views\n3.1 Contractual Views\n\nOn the contractual view, the moral terms and obligations of marriage\nare understood as promises between spouses. Their content is supplied\nby surrounding social and legal practices, but their promissory nature\nimplies that parties to the promise can negotiate the terms and\nrelease each other from marital obligations.\n\nOne rationale for treating marital obligations as such promises might\nbe thought to be the voluntaristic account of obligation. On this\nview, all special obligations (as opposed to general duties) are the\nresult of voluntary undertakings; promises are then the paradigm of\nspecial obligations (see entry on Special Obligations). Thus, whatever\nspecial obligations spouses have to one another must originate in\nvoluntary agreement, best understood as promise. We will return to\nthis below. A second rationale is the assumption that existing\nmarriage practices are morally arbitrary, in the sense that there is\nno special moral reason for their structure. Further, there are\ndiverse social understandings of marriage. If the choice between them\nis morally arbitrary, there is no moral reason for spouses to adopt\none specific set of marital obligations; it is up to spouses to choose\ntheir terms. Thus, the contractual account depends upon the assumption\nthat there is no decisive moral reason for a particular marital\nstructure.\n\nOn the contractual account, not just any contracts count as marriages.\nThe default content of marital promises is supplied by social and\nlegal practice: sexual exclusivity, staying married, and so on. But it\nentails that spouses may release one another from these moral\nobligations. For example, extra-marital sex has often been construed\nas morally wrong by virtue of promise-breaking: if spouses promise\nsexual exclusivity, extra-marital sex breaks a promise and is thereby\nprima facie wrong. However, if marital obligations are simply\npromises between the spouses, then the parties can release one\nanother, making consensual extra-marital sex permissible (Wasserstrom\n1974). Marriage is also sometimes taken to involve a promise to stay\nmarried. This seems to make unilateral divorce morally problematic, as\npromisors cannot release themselves from promissory obligations (Morse\n2006). But standard conditions for overriding promissory obligations,\nsuch as conflict with more stringent moral duties, inability to\nperform, or default by the other party to a reciprocal promise would\npermit at least some unilateral divorces (Houlgate 2005, Chapter 12).\nSome theorists of marriage have suggested that marital promises are\nconditional on enduring love or fulfilling sex (Marquis 2005, Moller\n2003). But this assumption is at odds with the normal assumption that\npromissory conditions are to be stated explicitly.\n\nRelease from the marriage promise is not the only condition for\npermissible divorce on the contractual view. Spouses may not be\nobligated to one another to stay married\u2014but they may have\nparental duties to do so: if divorce causes avoidable harm to\nchildren, it is prima facie wrong (Houlgate 2005, Chapter 12,\nRussell 1929, Chapter 16). However, in some cases divorce will benefit\nthe child\u2014as when it is the means to escape abuse. A vast\nempirical literature disputes the likely effects of divorce on\nchildren (Galston 1991, 283\u2013288, Young 1995). What is notable\nhere, philosophically, is that this moral reason against divorce is\nnot conceived as a spousal, but a parental, duty.\n\nMarriage is widely taken to have an amatory core, suggesting that a\nfurther marital promise is a promise to love, as expressed in wedding\nvows \u2018to love and cherish\u2019. But the possibility of such\npromises has met with skepticism. If one cannot control whether one\nloves, the maxim that \u2018ought implies can\u2019 entails that one\ncannot promise to love. One line of response has been to suggest that\nmarriage involves a promise not to feel but to behave a certain\nway\u2014to act in ways likely to sustain the relationship. But such\nreinterpretations of the marital promise face a problem: promises\ndepend on what promisors intend to promise\u2014and presumably most\nspouses do not intend to promise mere behavior (Martin 1993, Landau\n2004, Wilson 1989, Mendus 1984, Brake 2012, Chapter 1; see also\nKronqvist 2011). However, developing neuroenhancement technology\npromises to bring love under control through \u201clove drugs\u201d\nwhich would produce bonding hormones such as oxytocin. While the use\nof neuroenhancement to keep one\u2019s vows raises questions about\nauthenticity and the nature of love (as well as concerns regarding its\nuse in abusive relationships), it is difficult to see how such\ntechnology morally differs from other love-sustaining devices such as\nromantic dinners\u2014except that it is more likely to be effective\n(Savulescu and Sandberg 2008).\n\nOne objection to the contractual account is that, without appeal to\nthe purpose of the institution, there is no reason why not just any\nset of promises count as marriage (Finnis 2008). The objection\ncontinues that the contractual account cannot explain the point of\nmarriage. Some marriage contractualists accept this implication.\nAccording to the \u201cbachelor\u2019s argument,\u201d marriage is\nirrational: chances of a strongly dis-preferred outcome (a loveless\nmarriage) are too high (Moller 2003). Defenders of the rationality of\nmarriage have replied that marital obligations are rational because\nthey help agents to secure their long-term interests in the face of\npassing desires (Landau 2004). From the institutional perspective,\nevaluating the rationality of marriage thus, in terms of fulfilling\nsubjective preferences, clashes with the tradition of viewing it as\nuniquely enabling certain objective human goods; however, a positive\ncase must be made for the latter view.\n\nAnother objection to the contractual view concerns voluntarism.\nCritics of the voluntarist approach to the family deny that family\nmorality is exhausted by voluntary obligations (Sommers 1989).\nVoluntarist conceptions of the family conflict with common-sense\nintuitions that there are unchosen special duties between family\nmembers, such as filial duties. However, even if voluntarism is false,\nthis does not suffice to establish special spousal duties. On the\nother hand, voluntarism alone does not entail the contractual view,\nfor it does not entail that spouses can negotiate the obligations of\nmarriage or that the obligations be subject to release, only that\nspouses must agree to them. Voluntarism, in other words, need not\nextend to the choice of marital obligations and hence need not entail\nthe contractual account. The contractual account depends on denying\nthat there is decisive moral reason for marriage to incorporate\ncertain fixed obligations. Let us turn to the case that there is such\nreason.\n",
