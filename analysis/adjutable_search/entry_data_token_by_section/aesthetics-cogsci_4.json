    "main_text": "Authenticity\n5. Authenticity\n\nA Kant-inspired view of long standing is that aesthetics is concerned\nnot with how things are but with how they appear (e.g., Urmson 1957),\na view sometimes called aesthetic empiricism (Currie 1989) On\nthis view aesthetics takes no cognisance of authenticity, which\ndepends on history and not on appearance; a fake Vermeer does not\nbecome authentic by being visually indistinguishable from a genuine\none. Is an object\u2019s history really aesthetically irrelevant?\nThose with an interest in art, craft and the design of artefacts\ngenerally are much concerned with the object\u2019s history, and\nthere are arguments to support the view that the application of at\nleast some aesthetic properties depends on assumptions about that\nhistory. Consider two such attributions from Sibley\u2019s (1959)\nextensive list of aesthetic properties: being delicate and\nbeing dynamic. A line that is seen as delicate when thought\nto be drawn by hand may not seem so when revealed as the product of a\nmachine, and Walton (1970) argued that, of two works which are\nvisually indistinguishable, one may be fairly described as dynamic and\nthe other not, depending on differences in their category membership\n(for defences of aesthetic empiricism concerning visual art see\nZanwill and, on music, Dodd; for the aesthetic relevance of\ngenuineness or authenticity see Korsmeyer 2019). The suggestion of at\nleast the first of these examples (being delicate) is that\nthe aesthetic properties of a thing, and the aesthetic values that\npossession of these properties entails, depend on the kind of\nachievement that the fashioning of the work represents. What may be a\nconsiderable achievement for one person at one time may be a greater,\nlesser or at least a different achievement for someone else, working\nwith different materials or in a distinct artistic culture (Dutton\n1979; Currie 1989; Huddleston 2012; Levinson 2016); James Grant (2020)\nsuggests that we do better to think in terms of a work\u2019s\ncapacity to exhibit the skills of its maker rathen than in terms of\nits constituting an achievement of the maker (see also Currie\n2018).\n\nBoth formulations imply a close connection between valuing the work\nand valuing the maker, helping thereby to explain how an interest in\nthe authenticity of a work can belong to the space of aesthetic\nreasons. It also suggests a connection with our desire to preserve and\npossess otherwise unremarkable objects because of their relation to\nsome person or event that interests us (JFK\u2019s sweater). Some\npsychologists have thought to bring art works and other valued\nartefacts together under the heading of contagion, the idea that\n\n\na person\u2019s immaterial qualities or \u2018essence\u2019 can be\ntransferred to an object through physical contact; (Newman,\nDiesendruck, & Bloom 2011)\n\n\nan idea that goes back to early anthropological work by Frazer (1890\n[1994]) and others. As the examples just given indicate, the idea that\na person\u2019s essence is transferable to an object does not depend\non the object\u2019s aesthetic merits, and this severely limits the\nusefulness of this idea in explaining the role of authenticity in the\narts (see, however, Korsmeyer 2019 where it is argued that genuineness\nis itself an aesthetic property). Bloom and colleagues stress the role\nof physical contact in the contagion process: \u201cAn original\nPicasso may be valuable because Picasso actually touched it\u201d\n(Newman & Bloom 2012: 3). But Picasso may have got no closer than\na brush length from Guernica, a picture likely to command\nhigher art-world respect (and higher prices) than a restaurant napkin\nsketch he then wiped his hands on. However, a more general and perhaps\nrather vague sense of \u201ccloseness\u201d to the artist and their\nact of making does seem to be explanatory of some art-world practices,\nsuch as a preference for lower numbered (and hence earlier) prints\neven where there is no decline in quality across later ones (Smith,\nNewman, & Dhar 2016).\n\nBloom and colleagues offer another explanation for our interest in\nauthentic items, this one closer in spirit to the suggestion above\nthat aesthetic judgements are sensitive to achievement or the\nmanifestation of ability:\n\n\n[A]n original is different from a forgery because it is the end point\nof a different sort of performance . The original is a creative work\nwhile the forgery is not. (Newman & Bloom 2012: 559)\n\n\nGuernica, very likely, is a more creative work than the napkin sketch\nand plausibly valued more for that reason. A question which arises is\nthis: how do people make judgements of the quality of, say, a\npainting, if not solely on the basis of how it looks? For a few highly\ntrained experts the answer may be: through deep immersion in the\ncultural and artistic context of the work. The rest of us, where we\nmake a judgement at all, may be dependent on short cuts such as the\n\u201ceffort heuristic\u201d, which treats evidence of effort as\nevidence of quality. In an experiment, people asked to judge the\nrelative merits of pictures A and B tended to judge\nA as better than B when told A took longer\nto paint, while the group who were told that B took longer\npreferred B. This effect was found equally among experts and\namong laypersons, though the experts were \u201cself-described\u201d\n(Kruger et al. 2004).\n",
