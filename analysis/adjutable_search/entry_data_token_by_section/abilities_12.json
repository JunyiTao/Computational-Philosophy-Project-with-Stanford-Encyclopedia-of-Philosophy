    "main_text": "Modal theories of ability || The modal analysis: logical considerations\n4.2 The modal analysis: logical considerations\n\nThere are two questions that might be raised for this proposal about\nability. First, does ability indeed admit of some kind of modal\nanalysis? Second, if it does, how exactly are we to spell out the\ndetails of that analysis \u2014 in particular, how are we to\narticulate condition C? Let us begin with the first, more basic,\nquestion.\n\nAccording to (MA), performing an act at some possible world (or set of\nworlds) is both necessary and sufficient for having the ability to\nperform that act. One way of challenging this claim is to deny the\nnecessity claim: that is, to argue that it is sometimes the case that\nan agent is able to perform an act that she does not perform at any\npossible world.\n\nThis is an argument that has in fact been made by several authors.\nDescartes, for one, appears to have argued that God is such an agent\n(Curley 1984). A genuinely omnipotent being, one might argue, should\nbe able to perform any act whatsoever, even the impossible ones. This\nview of omnipotence is contentious, but it is not clear that it should\nbe ruled out formally, by the very analysis of ability, as (MA) does.\nSpencer (2017) argues that even non-omnipotent agents may sometimes\nhave the ability to perform acts that they do not perform at any\npossible world.\n\nLet us grant, however, that the possibility of performing an act is a\nnecessary condition for performing that act, and that in this sense an\nattribution of ability entails a possibility claim. One might\nnonetheless resist the view that ability admits of a modal analysis in\nthe manner suggested by (MA).\n\nThat is the kind of argument developed in a prescient discussion by\nAnthony Kenny (Kenny 1975; the presentation of Kenny here is indebted\nto the discussion in Brown 1988). Kenny argues that, if something like\n(MA) is indeed true, then ability should obey the principles that\ngovern the possibility operator in standard modal logics. Kenny claims\nthat ability\u00a0fails to satisfy the following two principles:\n\n(1) \\(A \\to \\Diamond A.\\)\n\n\nInformally, (1) expresses the principle that if an agent performs an\naction, then she has the ability to perform this action. This is,\nKenny argues, false of ability.\n\n(2) \\(\\Diamond(A \\lor B) \\to (\\Diamond A \\lor \\Diamond B).\\)\n\n\nInformally, (2) expresses the principle that if an agent has the\nability to perform one of two actions, then she has the ability to\nperform either the first action or the second action. This is, Kenny\nargues, false of ability.\n\nLet us begin with (1). Kenny claims that this principle is false in\nlight of cases like the following: \u2018A hopeless darts player may,\nonce in a lifetime, hit the bull, but be unable to repeat the\nperformance because he does not have the ability to hit the\nbull\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 136). This kind of \u2018fluky\nsuccess\u2019 has been extensively discussed in the philosophical\nliterature \u2014 perhaps most famously in Austin (1956) \u2014 in\norder to make a variety of points. Kenny\u2019s insight is to observe\nthat these simple cases tell against the modal analysis of ability, as\nthey violate an axiom of many modal logics, namely any system as\nstrong as the system T.\n\nA simple response to this point is to deny that T (or\nany stronger logic) is the correct logic for ability. To deny this is\nstill to allow for a treatment of ability within the framework of\npossible worlds. Notably, the modal logic K is one\nthat fails to validate (1). A natural response to Kenny\u2019s first\npoint, then, is to say that K, rather than\nT or some stronger system, is the correct modal logic\nof ability.\n\nThis response is not available, however, in response to Kenny\u2019s\nsecond objection. Recall that objection was that (2) is true of\npossibility but not of ability. Here the retreat to weaker modal\nlogics will not work, since (2) is provable on the weakest standard\nmodal logic, namely K. Yet the parallel claim does\nnot seem true of ability. Kenny gives the following example:\n\nGiven a pack of cards, I have the ability to pick out on request a\ncard which is either black or red; but I don\u2019t have the ability to\npick out a red card on request nor the ability to pick out a black\ncard on request. (Kenny 1975, 137)\n\n\nThis then appears to be a case where S has the ability to\nA or B but lacks the ability to A and lacks\nthe ability to B. So it appears that (2) is false of ability.\nIn light of this Kenny concludes that \u2018if we regard possible\nworlds semantics as making explicit what is involved in being a\npossibility, we must say that ability is not any kind of\npossibility\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 140).\n\nTo appreciate Kenny\u2019s conclusion, it is instructive to work\nthrough why precisely this is a counterexample to (MA). Consider an\nagent S who has the ability to pick a red card or a black\ncard, but does not have the ability to pick a red card or the ability\nto pick a black card. According to (MA), S has the ability\nto A iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C. Consider the case where (MA)\nappeals to a single world, not a set of worlds. If S has the\nability to pick a red card or pick a black card, then by (MA) there is\na world w satisfying condition C where S\npicks a red card or black card. Then either S picks a red\ncard at w or S picks a black card\nat w. Then, applying (MA) now in the other\ndirection, S has the ability to pick a red card or S\nhas the ability to pick a black card.  But that, by assumption, is not\nthe case. Since (MA) is the only substantive premise appealed to that\nargument, (MA) must be rejected.\n\nNote that this argument turned essentially on adopting the version of\n(MA) which appealed to a single world, rather than a set of worlds. So\none way of responding to this objection is by appealing to sets of\nworlds in the modal analysis of ability. This is precisely the\nproposal of Mark Brown, who argues that, if we take accessibility\nrelations to hold between a world and a set of worlds, then\u00a0we\nmay capture talk of ability within a possible worlds framework that is\nbroadly in the spirit of standard views (Brown 1988; see also Cross\n1986). Alternatively, we may take this sort of point to militate in\nfavor of a return to hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least\non Lewis\u2019s view of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a\ndisjunction follows from a counterfactual claim without either of its\ndisjuncts following from that claim (Lewis 1973, 79\u201380). Modal\naccounts that appeal to sets of worlds are \u2018non-normal\u2019 in\nthe sense that they do not satisfy the axiom K, but\nthey remain true to the letter of (MA) as well as the spirit of modal\nanalyses generally, insofar as they avail themselves only of possible\nworlds and quantification thereover.\n",
