    "main_text": "What is transcendental realism? || Kant\u2019s criticisms of Newton\n5.2 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Newton\n\nKant focuses most of his critical gaze in the Aesthetic on Leibniz and\nthe Leibnizians. This may reflect the fact that Leibniz held, as we\nhave seen, well-developed views concerning space and time and their\nrepresentation. Newton did not hold extensive views about the\nrepresentation of space and time (although he had a minimal\nperspective on such matters). It may also reflect the fact that Kant\nheld various broadly \u201cLeibnizian\u201d positions throughout the\npre-critical period, breaking rather substantively with Leibniz in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770. But this is not to say that Kant\nfocused exclusively on Leibniz and his followers in the Aesthetic. He\nalso presents two broad sorts of criticism of the Newtonian position.\nFirst, he criticizes the Newtonians for holding a transcendental\nrealist position concerning space and time\u2014his arguments against\ntranscendental realism presumably hold, if they are successful,\nagainst both the Leibnizian \u201cinherence\u201d view and the\nNewtonian \u201csubsistence\u201d view of space and time. Second, he\ncontends that their perspective, unlike Leibniz\u2019s, is marred by\na set of serious metaphysical problems. When discussing the Newtonian\nposition, Kant often emphasizes those problems. In \u00a77 of the\nAesthetic (in the B edition of 1787), Kant describes the\ntranscendental idealist conception of space and time, and then\ncharacterizes the relevant contrast class:\n\nThose, however, who assert the absolute reality [absolute\nRealit\u00e4t] of space and time, whether they take it to be\nsubsisting or only inhering, must themselves come into conflict with\nthe principles [Principien] of experience. For if they decide in favor\nof the first (which generally is the position of the mathematical\ninvestigators of nature), then they must assume two eternal and\ninfinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and time), which are\nthere (yet without there being anything actual) only in order to\ncomprehend everything actual within themselves.\n (A39/B56\u2013A40/B57)[25]\n\n\nKant contends that the Newtonians conceive of space as a kind of\nquasi-object. He seems to return here to the classical discussion of\nthe ontology of space mentioned at the outset of this entry. He\nemphasizes that on the Newtonian view, space and time are akin to\nsubstances\u2014in that they are independent of all objects and\nrelations, on the one hand, and independent of the mind (and of\nintuition), on the other\u2014and yet lack causal relations. They are\nalso imperceptible, and certainly in the case of space, infinite. Thus\nfor Kant, the Newtonians regard space as an infinite substance-like\nentity that is imperceptible and causally inert, a view that Kant\nregards as absurd on general metaphysical grounds. Numerous\nphilosophers throughout the eighteenth century, from Leibniz to\nBerkeley to Du Ch\u00e2telet, concurred. Kant adds that the Newtonian\nview seems to conflict with what he calls \u201cthe principles of\nexperience\u201d (see Shabel 2005, 46\u20137). Perhaps the idea behind\nthis second criticism can be discerned from Kant\u2019s comments\nelsewhere in the Critique and in the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science\u2014in those texts, Kant notes\nthat absolute space is not an object of possible experience and that\none cannot prove its existence by appealing to\n experience.[26]\n In this way, Kant\u2019s criticisms of the Newtonian view seem to\nrest on very general metaphysical and epistemic\nconsiderations\u2014they seem to be largely divorced from the sort of\nspecific views of intuition and of representation that played a\nsubstantial role in Kant\u2019s criticisms of Leibniz.\n",
