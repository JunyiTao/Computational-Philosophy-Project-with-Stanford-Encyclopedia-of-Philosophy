    "main_text": "The World and Rational Cosmology || The Mathematical Antinomies\n4.1 The Mathematical Antinomies\n\nThere are four \u201cantinomies\u201d of pure reason, and Kant\ndivides them into two classes. The first two antinomies are dubbed\n\u201cmathematical\u201d antinomies, presumably because in each\ncase, we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to\nbe sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and\nspace and time. An important and fundamental aspect of Kant\u2019s\nrejection of each of these sets of arguments rests on his view that\neach of these conflicts is traceable back to a fundamental error, an\nerror that can be discerned, according to Kant, in the following\ndialectical syllogism:\n\n\nIf the conditioned is given, then the whole series of conditions, a\nseries which is therefore itself absolutely unconditioned, is also\ngiven\n\nObjects of the senses are given as conditioned\n\nConsequently, the entire series of all conditions of objects of the\nsenses is already given. (cf. A497/B525).\n\n\nThere are a number of problems with this argument, according to Kant.\nObviously, one problem is located in the major premise, in the\nassumption that the unconditioned is \u201calready given.\u201d The\nproblem, maintains Kant, is that such a totality is never to be met\nwith in experience. The rational assumption that the total series of\nall conditions is already given would hold only for things in\nthemselves. In the realm of appearances, the totality is never given\nto us, as finite discursive knowers. The most we are entitled to say,\nwith respect to appearances, is that the unconditioned is set as a\ntask, that there is a rational prescription to continue to seek\nexplanations (A498/B526-A500/B528). As finite (sensible) cognizers,\nhowever, we shall never achieve an absolute completion of knowledge.\nTo assume that we can do so is to adopt the theocentric model of\nknowledge characteristic of the dreaded transcendental realist.\n\nThis hypostatization of the idea of the world, the fact that it is\ntaken to be a mind-independent object, acts as the underlying\nassumption motivating both parties to the two mathematical antinomies.\nThe first antinomy concerns the finitude or infinitude of the\nspatio-temporal world. The thesis argument seeks to show that the\nworld in space and time is finite, i.e., has a beginning in time and a\nlimit in space. The antithesis counters that it is infinite with\nregard to both space and time. The second antinomy concerns the\nultimate constitution of objects in the world, with the thesis arguing\nfor ultimately simple substances, whereas the antithesis argues that\nobjects are infinitely divisible. In this, the thesis positions are\neach concerned to bring the explanatory effort to a close, by arguing\nfor ultimate or, as Kant says, \u201cintelligible beginnings\u201d\n(cf. A466/B494). The claim that there is a \u201cfirst\nbeginning\u201d or an ultimately simple substance is sustained only\nby abstracting from the spatio-temporal framework. The alleged\nproponent of the antithesis arguments, on the other hand, refuses any\nconclusion that goes beyond the sensible conditions of space and time.\nAccording to the antithesis arguments, the world is infinite in both\nspace and time (these being infinite as well), and bodies are (in\naccordance with the infinite divisibility of space) also infinitely\ndivisible.\n\nIn each of these antinomial conflicts, reason finds itself at an\nimpasse. Satisfying the demands placed by our rational capacity to\nthink beyond experience, the thesis arguments offer what appears to be\na satisfying resting-place for explanation. The antithesis charges\nthat such a strategy fails to find any confirmation, and, citing the\nunjustified flight into an intelligible realm, lodges itself squarely\nin the domain of \u201cexperience.\u201d In each of these cases, the\nconflicts are resolved by demonstrating that the conclusions drawn on\nboth sides are false.\n\nHow does Kant demonstrate this? Both the thesis and antithesis\narguments are apagogic, i.e., that they constitute indirect proofs. An\nindirect proof establishes its conclusion by showing the impossibility\nof its opposite. Thus, for example, we may want to know, as in the\nfirst antinomy, whether the world is finite or infinite. We can seek\nto show that it is finite by demonstrating the impossibility of its\ninfinitude. Alternatively, we may demonstrate the infinitude of the\nworld by showing that it is impossible that it is finite. This is\nexactly what the thesis and antithesis arguments purport to do,\nrespectively. The same strategy is deployed in the second antinomy,\nwhere the proponent of the thesis position argues for the necessity of\nsome ultimately simple substance by showing the impossibility of\ninfinite divisibility of substance, etc.\n\nObviously, the success of the proofs depends on the legitimacy of the\nexclusive disjunction agreed to by both parties. Both parties, that\nis, assume that \u201cthere is a world,\u201d and that it is, for\nexample, \u201ceither finite or infinite.\u201d Herein lies the\nproblem, according to Kant. The world is, for Kant, neither finite nor\ninfinite. The opposition between these two alternatives is merely\ndialectical. In the cosmological debates, each party to the dispute\nfalls prey to the ambiguity in the idea of the world.\n\nKant thus structures his analysis of the mathematical antinomies by\nappealing to the general dialectical syllogism presented at the end of\nsection 4.0 (If the conditioned is given, the unconditioned is given,\nObjects of the senses are given as conditioned....etc.). Problems stem\nfrom the application of the principle expressed in the first premise\nto the objects of the senses (appearances). Here again, Kant diagnoses\nthe error or fallacy contained in this syllogism as that of ambiguous\nmiddle. He claims that the major premise uses the term \u201cthe\nconditioned\u201d transcendentally, as a pure concept, whereas the\nminor premise uses the term \u2018empirically\u2019 \u2013 that is\nas a \u201cconcept of the understanding applied to mere\nappearances\u201d (cf. A499\u2013500/B527\u2013528). What Kant\nmeans is that the major premise uses the term \u201cthe\nconditioned\u201d in a very general way, one that considers things in\nabstraction from the sensible conditions of our intuition. The minor\npremise, however, which specifically refers to objects in space and\ntime (appearances), is committed to an empirical use of the term.\nIndeed, such an empirical use would have to be deployed, if the\nconclusion is to be reached. The conclusion is that the entire series\nof all conditions of appearances is actually given. Put in other\nterms, the conclusion is that there is a world, understood as the sum\ntotal of all appearances and their conditions (A420/B448).\n",
