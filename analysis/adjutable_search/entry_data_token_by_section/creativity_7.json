The Cognitive Science of Creativity\n\nAlthough creativity has been relatively understudied by contemporary\nphilosophers, as we noted in\n \u00a71,\n it has been receiving a great deal of attention from psychologists\nover the past few decades. In 1950, J. P. Guilford gave a presidential\naddress at the American Psychological Association calling for research\non the topic, and the field soon took off with waves of research\ninvestigating the traits and dispositions of creative personalities;\nthe cognitive and neurological mechanisms at play in creative thought;\nthe motivational determinants of creative achievement; the range of\ninstitutional, educational, and environmental factors that enhance or\ninhibit creativity; and more. Today, the blossoming of this field can\nbe seen in the flurry of popular writing on its results; an official\ndivision of the American Psychological Association for the psychology\nof aesthetics, creativity, and the arts (Division 10); numerous\nacademic conferences; dedicated peer-reviewed journals (Psychology\nof Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts; Creativity\nResearch Journal; Journal of Creative Behavior;\nInternational Journal of Creativity and Problem Solving);\nspecial issues of journals (Current Opinion in Behavioral\nSciences, Takeuchi & Jung 2019); literature surveys\n(Hennessey & Amabile 2010; Runco & Albert 2010; Runco 2017;\nGlaveanu 2014; Williams et al. 2016); textbooks (J.C. Kaufman 2009;\nSawyer 2012; R. W. Weisberg 1986, 2006); and a comprehensive\nencyclopedia (Runco & Pritzker 2020). According to one overview,\ncreativity has been studied by nearly all of the most eminent\npsychologists of the twentieth century, and \u201cthe field can only\nbe described as explosive\u201d (Albert & Runco 1999: 17). There\nis also a groundswell of new work on creativity in the fields of\ncomputer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics.\n\nThe present section surveys empirical work in psychology along with\nsome related work in neuroscience, while the next section\n (\u00a76)\n covers research in computing, AI, and robotics. Throughout,\nwe\u2019ll see that philosophers are actively in dialogue with these\nfields under the broad, interdisciplinary umbrella of cognitive\nscience.\n\nThe vast body of empirical research of creativity can be seen as\naddressing a variety of issues, but the central question that concerns\nus here is the one we identified above as the challenge for explaining\ncreativity: How are people creative? This question is\nanalogous to a number of other questions in cognitive science: How do\npeople perceive through sense modalities such as vision? How do they\nform concepts? How do they acquire a language? How do they make\ninferences? Just as psychologists investigate the psychological and\nneurological processes, systems, and mechanisms at work in these other\nmental operations, as well as the internal and external factors that\neither enhance or hinder these operations, they are doing the same for\ncreativity. There is no pretension to achieving a complete\nexplanation which would include each and every causal factor, and\nprovide the basis for perfectly predicting creative outcomes in\nadvance. But to the extent that we identify some of the relevant\ncausal factors involved in creativity we thereby make progress in\nexplaining creativity, just as we do with other features of the\nmind.\n\nAs we noted in\n \u00a72,\n the standard definition of creativity in psychology says that a\nproduct (idea or artefact) is creative to the extent that it is both\nnew and valuable (\u201ceffective\u201d, \u201cuseful\u201d or\n\u201cappropriate\u201d), and, in turn, people and processes are\ncreative to the extent that they produce new and valuable things. As\nwe also noted, many psychologists do not actually employ this, or any,\ndefinition of creativity in conducting their research. In one sampling\nof studies of creativity published in peer-reviewed psychology\njournals, only 38% of them included an explicit definition of\ncreativity (Plucker, Beghetto, & Dow 2004), as they rely in one\nway or another on the assumption that we know it when we see it. For\nexample, many studies use the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT),\nwhereby experimental subjects produce things that are then rated for\nhow creative they are by a panel of experts in the relevant field; so\npaintings are rated by professional painters, stories by published\nauthors, etc. Many other research methodologies are used, as\nwe\u2019ll see below.\n\nEmpirical research on creativity departs in several ways from the\ntraditional approaches that seemed to place creativity outside the\nscope of science. For starters, in stark contrast to Plato\u2019s\nsupernaturalism, empirical psychologists take creativity to be a\ncompletely natural phenomenon. Creative people may of course be\n\u201cinspired\u201d in the sense of feeling energized or filled\nwith ideas, but rather than being literally \u201cbreathed\ninto\u201d by some god or muse, their thoughts and behaviors are\npresumed to have causes that are perfectly natural. While it is\ndifficult in practice to identify these causes, they are not in\nprinciple beyond the reach of science.\n\nFurther, the range of phenomena that contemporary researchers\ncountenance within the ambit of creativity is far broader and more\ndiverse than the traditional focus on poetry and the fine arts, as\ncreativity can be manifest in any kind of art or craft, as well as in\nthe sciences, technology, entrepreneurship, cooking, humor, or indeed\nin any domain where people come up with ideas or things that are novel\nand valuable in some way or another. Departing from Kant, genius, the\nhighest echelon of creativity, may be acknowledged in virtually any of\nthese domains, not just in the fine arts. And while a few researchers\n(e.g., Simonton 1984, 1994, 1997, 2009; Root-Bernstein &\nRoot-Bernstein 1999) venture to examine genius (so-called\n\u201cBig-C\u201d creativity), most of them focus instead on\nrelatively ordinary creative feats (\u201clittle-c\u201d creativity)\nincluding the kinds of story-making, drawing, and problem-solving that\ncan be elicited on command from regular people in experimental\nsettings. Some researchers propose that in order to understand how the\nmind generates new ideas, we should begin with even more rudimentary\nphenomena. For example, philosopher Jesse Prinz and psychologist\nLawrence Barsalou focus on how we form new concepts to categorize the\nthings we perceive, a process which they claim is creative, albeit in\na \u201cmundane\u201d rather than \u201cexceptional\u201d way\n(Prinz & Barsalou 2002; Barsalou & Prinz 1997; cf. Child\n2018).\n\nOf course, many feats of human creativity, and the ones that are most\ninteresting, go far beyond the basic formation of concepts. A major\nstep toward explaining those feats is to recognize that what we call\n\u201cthe creative process\u201d, as if it were a single, homogenous\nphenomenon, is in fact an assembly of multiple stages or operations.\nThe simplest recognition of this fact is the Geneplore model\nwhich distinguishes just two stages: generating ideas and\nexploring ideas (Finke 1996; Smith, Ward, & Finke 1995).\nThis distinction may be seen as echoing one made by philosophers of\nscience in the early twentieth century, between the context of\ndiscovery and the context of justification (Popper\n1934). Other theorists posit up to eight stages of creativity (for a\nsummary of proposals, see Sawyer 2012: 89). But the most influential\nstage-theory traces back to Henri Poincar\u00e9\u2019s lecture,\n\u201cMathematical Creation\u201d (1908 [1913: 383\u2013394]), in\nwhich he identifies four phases in his own innovative work as a\nmathematician:\n\nconscious hard work or preparation,\nunconscious incubation,\nillumination, and\nverification.\n\n\nIn his book, The Art of Thought (1926), the psychologist\nGraham Wallas endorses Poincar\u00e9\u2019s four stages with\ncorroborating evidence from the personal reports of other eminent\nscientists like Hermann von Helmholtz. Wallas\u2019s scheme, as a\ndevelopment of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, is still the one that is most\nwidely cited, and we employ a version of it here with some slightly\ndifferent terminology and with two more substantive alterations:\ninstead of \u201cincubation\u201d, we identify the second operation\nmore generally as the \u201cgeneration\u201d of ideas, which may\ninclude unconscious incubation but may also occur in conscious,\ndeliberate thought; and we add \u201cexternalization\u201d for a\ntotal of five operations:\n\nPreparation\u2014You invest a great deal of effort\nlearning and practicing in order to acquire the knowledge, skills, and\nexpertise required for work in a given domain.\nGeneration\u2014You produce new ideas, whether through\nconscious reflection or unconscious incubation.\nInsight\u2014You consciously experience the emergence of\na new idea, which would strike you with a feeling of surprise:\n\u201cAha!\u201d, \u201cEureka!\u201d\nEvaluation \u2013 You assess the idea to determine\nwhether it should be discarded, retained, revised, or amended.\nExternalization\u2014You express your idea in a\nconcrete, observable form.\n\n\nArtists provide compelling examples (though not the only ones) of each\nof these five operations. Such examples can be especially illustrative\nsince they come straight from the artists\u2019 mouths, as they\nreflect upon, and share, their creative process. The twentieth century\npainter Jacob Lawrence was known for painting in the style of visual\nnarratives. Lawrence developed a system, much like a filmmaker\u2019s\nstoryboard, for the preparation of these paintings. He would lay as\nmany as 60 wood panels on the studio floor, each with individual\nscenes and sometimes with captions. From these storyboards, Lawrence\nwould generate and evaluate ideas and insights for a visual narrative,\nculminating in the paintings such as those in his Migration\nSeries (see Whitney Museum, 2002, in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Toni Morrison, the Nobel prize winning novelist, remarks on the\nlabors and sustained effort required at the preparation, generation,\nevaluation, and externalization stages of a creative writing process.\nCommenting on her novel Jazz, she says,\n\n\nI thought of myself as like the jazz musician\u2014someone who\npractices and practices and practices in order to be able to invent\nand to make his art look effortless and graceful. I was always\nconscious of the constructed aspect of the writing process, and that\nart appears natural and elegant only as a result of constant practice\nand awareness of its formal structures.\n\n\nShe further notes that insight does not always come in a flash,\n\n\n[I]t\u2019s a sustained thing I have to play with. I always start out\nwith an idea, even a boring idea, that becomes a question I\ndon\u2019t have any answers to. (T. Morrison 1993)\n\n\nWriter Ishmael Reed claims that insight can come unexpectedly and in\nvarious contexts:\n\n\nOne can find inspiration from many sources. The idea of Japanese\nby Spring originated in a news item that claimed the endowment to\na major university was traced to Japanese mob, the Yakuza. Flight\nto Canada began as a poem. The Terrible series began\nwhen I heard someone at party mention that there was a black figure,\nBlack Peter, in the Dutch Christmas, and by coincidence I was invited\nto the Netherlands shortly afterwards, where I witnessed the arrival\nof Saint Nicholas and Peter on a barge that floated into Amsterdam\nwith crowds looking on. I took photos of the ceremony \u2026.\n(Howell 2020: 91)\n\n\nAnd with signature profundity, James Baldwin suggested that all\nelements of the creative artistic process, from preparation to\nexternalization, require a basic enabling condition: being (and\nwilling to be) alone (Baldwin 1962).\n\nAs Wallas recognized (1926: 81), and as the above examples suggest,\nthe \u201cstages\u201d of the creative process are not necessarily\ndiscrete steps that follow one another in a tidy sequence. Creative\nwork is messy: over time you have numerous ideas, keeping some and\nabandoning others in multiple rounds of trial-and-error; you incubate\nnew ideas for one problem while you\u2019re busy externalizing your\nideas for another; and your moments of insight, evaluation, and\nexternalization trigger further generative processes that send you\ncycling through these operations many times over. It\u2019s still\nimportant to distinguish these operations, however, because, as\nresearchers are confirming, they are enabled and influenced by\ndifferent causal factors.\n\nAmong the additional stages that researchers have posited, one of the\nmost widely discussed is known as problem-finding.\nPsychologists often conceptualize creative thought in terms of\nproblem-solving: the ideas generated within the creative process are\nseen as candidate solutions to a given problem\u2014where\n\u201cproblems\u201d are broadly construed to include any creative\naim, like that of producing a particular kind of artwork or proving a\nparticular theorem, etc. (Flavell & Draguns 1957: 201; Newell,\nShaw, & Simon 1962). But following some early work by Mihalyi\nCsikszentmihalyi (1965), many researchers came to appreciate that a\nlot of creative work is done not just in solving problems but in\nfinding the right problem to begin with (Abdulla et al. 2020;\nCsikszentmihalyi & Getzels 1970; Getzels 1965; Getzels &\nCsikszentmihalyi 1975). While we agree that problem-finding often\nplays a key role in creativity, we have not assigned it to a separate\nstage, for the following reasons. Consider that you might settle on a\nproblem to work on in either of two ways. On one hand, you might\nchoose a problem to work on from a pre-existing menu of options. In\nthat case, your choice would fall under the evaluation phase;\nit\u2019s just that the idea you select is a problem that calls for\nthe pursuit of further ideas. If, on the other hand, you develop a\nnew problem, you would thereby be engaging in the\ngeneration of a new idea\u2014the new problem\u2014which\nmay emerge in a moment of insight. Einstein and his colleague\ncelebrated the novelty in such problem-finding:\n\n\nThe formulation of a problem is often more essential than its\nsolution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental\nskill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old\nproblems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks\nreal advance in science. (Einstein & Infeld 1938: 92)\n\n\nEither way\u2014whether you \u201cfind\u201d a problem by picking a\npre-existing one or by coming up with a new one\nyourself\u2014problem-finding, though important, does not need to be\nseen as an additional operation beyond the five listed above;\nit\u2019s just a special case of generation, insight, or\nevaluation.\n\nThe next five sub-sections will respectively examine the five\noperations of creative work. Notice that three of\nthem\u2014preparation, evaluation, and externalization\u2014are\nuncontroversially ordinary activities that involve no apparent\nmystery; it\u2019s a challenge to explain them but no one is tempted\nto regard them as inexplicable or as violating the laws of nature. As\nwe saw in\n \u00a74,\n traditional skepticism about the possibility of explaining creativity\nis really focused on the two remaining phenomena: the\ngeneration of new ideas\n (\u00a75.2)\n and the experience of insight whereby an idea seems to come\nout of the blue, as if from a god\n (\u00a75.3).\n",
