    "main_text": "Mind and Metaphysics || Realism\n6.2 Realism \n\n\nAlthough all Abhidharma schools admit the ultimate reality of \ndharmas, only the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika (or Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da) \nSchool contends that dharmas exist in all three temporal dimensions \n(past, present, and future). The main arguments for this view \nare found in the Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya and the \nMah\u0101-Vibha\u1e63\u0101, as well as in Vasubandhu's \nAbhidharmako\u015ba, where they are systematically debated \nand refuted. In all, three types of arguments are put forward to \nsupport the notion that the past and future basic units of existence \n(dharmas) are presently real:\n\nThe argument from cognition: Past and future dharmas exist because\nof our ability to make past and future events the object of our\ncognitive awareness.\nThe dispositional argument: The presence of dispositions (as\nhabituations resulting from past intentional acts) implies that past\nand future dharmas associated with these dispositions must be\npresently manifest.\nThe causal argument: past dharmas must be real and present for\notherwise they would lack causal efficacy in bringing about a present\neffect.\n\n\n\nA plausible rationale for the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din\u2019s \nassertion of the continuing existence of past and future \ndharmas concerns the first and third arguments: it is \nimpossible to conceive of a non-existent intentional object or the \ncausal efficacy of a non-existent dharma. Given the \nprinciple of momentariness, which states that things exist only as \npoint instants, it would be impossible to explain the arising of a \nparticular type of cognitive awareness in the absence of an already \nexisting preceding cause. Cognitive awareness, which arises in \ndependence upon the object and the corresponding sense faculty, would\nlack support if past dharmas were unreal. In his commentary to \nthe verse portion of the Treasury of Higher Knowledge, \nVasubandhu explains the standpoint of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din as \nfollows: \n\nCognitive awareness (vij\u00f1\u0101na) occurs only if the\nobjective correlate exists, not otherwise. If past and future were\nnonexistent then the object of cognitive awareness would be a\nnonexistent cognitive support (\u0101lambana). Therefore\nconsciousness would not occur if its objective support does not\nexist. Furthermore if the past is nonexistent then how could there be\nin the future the effect of good and bad deeds? For the present cause\nof its fruition no longer exists at the time when the effect\narises. Therefore the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika maintain that past and\nfuture exist (AKBh ad V, 25; Poussin 1980, vol. IV, p.51).\n  \n\n\nFor the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas the justification for maintaining the \nexistence of dharmas in all three temporal dimensions is provided by \ntheir causal theory of cognition: since cognitive awareness cannot \narise in the absence of an objective support, the cognition must be \ncausally related to the object. The object, therefore, must be real, for \nnonexistent objects lack causal efficacy (as we discussed in \n \u00a75.1).\n \n",
