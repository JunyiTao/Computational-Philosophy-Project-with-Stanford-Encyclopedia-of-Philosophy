    "main_text": "Political Theory || Rights\n2.2 Rights\n\nWhile there may be suggestions of rights claims in Common\nSense and in a number of minor texts attributed by some to Paine\nbut where the authorship is a matter of dispute, it is clear that the\nfully fledged account of rights that Paine advances in the first part\nof Rights of Man (1791) represents a significant development\nin his thinking. It is common to attribute that development to the\nfoil he found in Burke\u2019s Reflections on the Revolution in\nFrance (1790), where Burke inveighs against the idea that rights\nare preserved from the state of nature in the civil state. \u2018Men\ncannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state\ntogether\u2026That he may secure some liberty, he makes a surrender\nin trust of the whole of it\u2019 (CW VIII, p. 110). And where he\nclaims that, in England, \u2018We have not been drawn and trussed, in\norder that we may be filled, like stuffed birds in a museum, with\nchaff and rage, and paltry, blurred shred of paper about the rights of\nman\u2019 (CW VIII, p. 137). It seems more likely, however, that\nPaine\u2019s distinction between natural rights, where we necessarily\nhave the power to execute the right (as in the right of conscience),\nas against rights where we need the arm of society to secure the right\n(as in property), although more sharply expressed in Rights of\nMan (1791), is a product of discussions with Jefferson and French\nsympathizers with America in the late 1780s, when they were discussing\nthe proposed Federal Constitution and its failure to contain a bill of\nrights. In a letter to Jefferson written in 1788/9 Paine draws a\ndistinction between \u2018rights they could individually exercise\nfully and perfectly, and those they could not\u2019 (CW II, 1298). In\nthe reply to Burke this is used to show that every civil right grows\nout of a natural right or \u2018is a natural right exchanged)\u2019;\nthat the civil power is made up of the aggregate of that class of the\nnatural rights of man, which becomes defective in the individual in\npoint of power; and that the power produced from the aggregate of\nnatural rights, imperfect in power in the individual\u2019, cannot be\napplied to invade the natural rights which are retained by the\nindividual\u2026\u2019 (CW I, 276).\n\nHow much, in fact, separates Paine from Burke? The rights in which our\npower is perfect, are relatively few\u2014so that many of the things\nthat really matter, access to means of labour and sustenance, freedom\nof movement and contract, seem to fall under Burke\u2019s sense of\nmatters of convenience which government orders on the basis of general\nutility. Although Paine does not provide much detail, it seems clear\nthat he sees himself as different from Burke primarily because he\nargues for continuing normative salience of the natural right and for\nthe on-going collective sovereignty of the people over the\narrangements that they make the better to secure those rights.\nPaine\u2019s readers had little doubt that he sought to defend their\nrights from invasion, but his distinction does not in-itself do that.\nAfter all, what is to stop the collective encroaching on the rights of\ncitizens? One answer is given in Paine\u2019s account of popular\nsovereignty.\n",
