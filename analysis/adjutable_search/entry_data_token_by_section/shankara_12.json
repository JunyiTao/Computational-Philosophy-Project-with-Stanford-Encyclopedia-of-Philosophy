    "main_text": "Contemplative Philosophical Methods || Action and Meditation\n4.1 Action and Meditation\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara is ambivalent about actions such as yogic\nmeditation, ritual practice, or ethical duties within his method. On\nthe one hand he strives to undermine the importance of mental or\nphysical action as an independent methodology for liberation. Action\nis a cause for bondage, not a means of liberation, because it always\npresupposes the reality of individual agency and contributes to a\ncycle of further desire and action. Furthermore, any product of action\nis finite and transient (Potter 1981: 38\u201341). \u015aa\u1e45kara\nviews action as having no epistemic fruitfulness independent of a\nmeans of knowledge. He draws a critical distinction based on content\ndependence. Physical actions such as ritual performance or mental\nactions like imagination or meditation are dependent on an\nindividual\u2019s will. They arise independently of the nature of the\nthing concerned. Veridical cognition, however, is ultimately dependent\non the nature of the object. It is determined by the object through a\nproper means of knowledge, with no options or alternatives in terms of\nan agent\u2019s choice. Action is therefore incapable of providing\nveridical knowledge whatsoever, let alone knowledge of non-duality\n(BrS\u016bBh 1.1.4). This critique of action collapses any\nmethodological dichotomy of theory and practice, which is intrinsic to\nboth ritual practice and yogic meditation methods. Liberating\nself-knowledge is not subject to any kind of ritual injunctions. It is\nnot procedural knowledge, nor the result of procedural knowledge. (See\nRam-Prasad 2000 on \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s distinction of knowledge\nand action. See Bader 1990 and Dalal 2016 on his approach to\nmeditation).\n\nOn the other hand, \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts the secondary importance\nof yogic practices that involve a variety of meditation methods,\ndevotional practices, ascetic austerities, moral psychology, and the\ndevelopment of ethical virtues and action ethics (see Sundaresan 2003\non Yoga in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s method). They may function as\nindirect means to liberation. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s ambivalence\ntowards action is not a contradiction. He recognizes a voluntary\nelement in any knowledge to some degree. One must create the proper\nconditions to align a means of knowledge. For example, to visually\nperceive an object one may have to open their eyes and turn their\nhead. Then visual knowledge automatically takes place. Similarly, the\nAdvaitin must possess a prepared mind to recognize brahman.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara provides a fourfold set of prerequisite conditions\ncharacterizing this qualified student: (1) discrimination between what\nis transient and eternal; (2) dispassion towards objects of enjoyment;\n(3) perfecting practices such as the control of the mind and senses;\nand (4) the desire for liberation (BrS\u016bBh 1.1.1).\n\nYogic and ethical practices, as well as analyses of the limitations of\ngoals like pleasure, wealth, status, and heaven provide the conditions\nfor self-knowledge by cultivating mental purity\n(anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a\u015buddhi). Mental purity is the\nremoval of epistemic obstructions to knowing brahman, such as\ngreed, anger, selfishness, violence, jealousy, and distraction. It\nalso includes developing positive qualifications such as ethical\nattitudinal values of equanimity, acceptance, truthfulness,\ncompassion, and benevolence. Mediation practices provide mental\nstability and focus. These qualifications hone the mind\u2019s\ncapacity to be a proper container for text-sparked knowledge; though,\nin theory, if a student is already sufficiently qualified, they need\nnot undergo any such practices.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s commentary on the\nBhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 provides a rich resource for his yogic\nmethods and ethical virtues. For example, following BhG ch. 2\u20134,\nhe endorses a yoga of action (karmayoga). Karmayoga\nis a yogic process that employs a philosophy of action to cultivate\nemotional growth and world participation. It extends Vedic ritual\nframeworks of sacrificial contribution and consumption to all actions.\nAll action becomes analogous to devotionally placing ritual oblations\ninto the sacrificial fire as offerings to deities. The Advaitin\nyogin offers actions altruistically to\n\u012b\u1e63vara for the benefit of all beings\n(lokasa\u1e45gra\u1e25) and the harmonious functioning of\nthe world. Just as the sacrificer equanimously consumes the remnants\nof sacrificial food offerings as a blessing, sans gustatory pleasure\nor aversion, so too does the yogin learn to accept the\nresults of their actions with equanimity. Karmayoga intends\nto free one from the binding attachment of desires caused by the\nmistaken belief that desired objects possess one\u2019s happiness. It\ndevelops internal renunciation, equipoise, gratitude, and benevolence,\nwhile releasing one from the anger, sadness, and inner turmoil that\narise from thwarted desire. This yogic attitude extends not only\nexternally to society, beings, and world, but also internally to\none\u2019s physiology and psychology.\n",
