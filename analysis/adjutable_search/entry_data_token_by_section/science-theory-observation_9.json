    "main_text": "Theory and value ladenness || Reuse\n3.5 Reuse\n\nEmpirical results are most obviously put to epistemic work in their\ncontexts of origin. Scientists conceive of empirical research, collect\nand analyze the relevant data, and then bring the results to bear on\nthe theoretical issues that inspired the research in the first place.\nHowever, philosophers have also discussed ways in which empirical\nresults are transferred out of their native contexts and applied in\ndiverse and sometimes unexpected ways (see Leonelli and Tempini 2020).\nCases of reuse, or repurposing of empirical results in different\nepistemic contexts raise several interesting issues for philosophers\nof science. For one, such cases challenge the assumption that theory\n(and value) ladenness confines the epistemic utility of empirical\nresults to a particular conceptual framework. Ancient Babylonian\neclipse records inscribed on cuneiform tablets have been used to\ngenerate constraints on contemporary geophysical theorizing about the\ncauses of the lengthening of the day on Earth (Stephenson, Morrison,\nand Hohenkerk 2016). This is surprising since the ancient observations\nwere originally recorded for the purpose of making astrological\nprognostications. Nevertheless, with enough background information,\nthe records as inscribed can be translated, the layers of assumptions\nbaked into their presentation peeled back, and the results repurposed\nusing resources of the contemporary epistemic context, the likes of\nwhich the Babylonians could have hardly dreamed.\n\nFurthermore, the potential for reuse and repurposing feeds back on the\nmethodological norms of data production and handling. In light of the\ndifficulty of reusing or repurposing data without sufficient\nbackground information about the original context, Goodman et al.\n(2014) note that \u201cdata reuse is most possible when: 1) data; 2)\nmetadata (information describing the data); and 3) information about\nthe process of generating those data, such as code, all all\nprovided\u201d (3). Indeed, they advocate for sharing data and code\nin addition to results customarily published in science. As we have\nseen, the loading of data with theory is usually necessary to putting\nthat data to any serious epistemic\nuse\u2014theory-loading makes theory appraisal possible.\nPhilosophers have begun to appreciate that this epistemic boon does\nnot necessarily come at the cost of rendering data \u201ctragically\nlocal\u201d (Wylie 2020, 285, quoting Latour 1999). But it is\nimportant to note the useful travel of data between contexts is\nsignificantly aided by foresight, curation, and management for that\naim.\n\nIn light of the mediated nature of empirical results, Boyd (2018)\nargues for an \u201cenriched view of evidence,\u201d in which the\nevidence that serves as the \u2018tribunal of experience\u2019 is\nunderstood to be \u201clines of evidence\u201d composed of the\nproducts of data collection and all of the products of their\ntransformation on the way to the generation of empirical results that\nare ultimately compared to theoretical predictions, considered\ntogether with metadata associated with their provenance. Such metadata\nincludes information about theoretical assumptions that are made in\ndata collection, processing, and the presentation of empirical\nresults. Boyd argues that by appealing to metadata to\n\u2018rewind\u2019 the processing of assumption-imbued empirical\nresults and then by re-processing them using new resources, the\nepistemic utility of empirical evidence can survive transitions to new\ncontexts. Thus, the enriched view of evidence supports the idea that\nit is not despite the intertwining of the theoretical and empirical\nthat scientists accomplish key epistemic aims, but often in virtue of\nit (ibid., 420). In addition, it makes the epistemic value of metadata\nencoding the various assumptions that have been made throughout the\ncourse of data collection and processing explicit.\n\nThe desirability of explicitly furnishing empirical data and results\nwith auxiliary information that allow them to travel can be\nappreciated in light of the \u2018objectivity\u2019 norm, construed\nas accessibility to interpersonal scrutiny. When data are repurposed\nin novel contexts, they are not only shared between subjects, but can\nin some cases be shared across radically different paradigms with\nincompatible theoretical commitments.\n",
