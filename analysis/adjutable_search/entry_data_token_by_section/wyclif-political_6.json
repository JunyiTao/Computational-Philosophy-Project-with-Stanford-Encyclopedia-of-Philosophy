Types of Human Dominium\n\n\nWyclif's definition of civil dominium as \u201cproprietary\nlordship in a viator over the goods of fortune fully\naccording to human law\u201d is centered not on legislative authority, but\non the private property ownership enjoyed by the viator, or\nwayfarer, along life's path (De Civili Dominio III ch. 11,\n p.178.9\u201317).[9]\n This is because all civil dominium is based on the use of\ngoods owned, which is the basis for all postlapsarian conceptions of\njustice (recall that for Wyclif, only God truly owns created things\nbecause creating a thing is necessary for owning it; hence, human\nbeings are only lent created things and can use them justly, or\nunjustly in case they appropriate them for themselves). Before the\nFall, our use of created goods was communal, unencumbered by the\ncomplexity that follows upon selfishness.  But now, Wyclif explains,\nthere are three types of use: that directly consequent upon civil\nownership, civil use without ownership, and evangelical use. The first\ntwo are natural results of the Fall, and the third is the result of\nChrist's Incarnation. Before the Incarnation, civil ownership and\ncivil use were grounded in man-made laws designed primarily to\nregulate property ownership. These legal systems tended to have two\ngeneral structures: they were either monarchies, as in most cases, or\nelse they were aristocratic polities. The harmony of the aristocratic\npolity is certainly preferable because it most resembles the state\nenjoyed before the Fall; the benevolent aristocracy, as evidenced in\nthe time of the Biblical judges, would foster the contemplative life,\ncommunalism, and an absence of corruptible governmental apparatus.\n\n\n\nThe most common species of civil dominium is monarchy, in\nwhich a chief executive power holds ultimate legislative\nauthority. This centralized authority in one man is necessary to\nimplement order; there is no real possibility that the many are\ncapable of ruling on behalf of the many, given the prevalence of\nsin. The point of civil dominium is not, as with\n Aristotle,\n the sustenance of individual virtuous activity. Civil\ndominium is a phenomenon based on Original Sin, and is\ntherefore unlikely to produce justice per se. If the government of\nCaesar is occasionally just, it is because it has accidentally\nrealized divine justice. But if civil dominium that is not\ngrounded directly in divine dominium is incapable of\nsustained just governance, and if natural dominium is the\ninstantiation of divine dominium for which man was created,\nhow can any talk of just civil dominium be possible? To\nreturn to the opening dictum of De Civili Dominio, if natural\ndominium is free from private property ownership, how can\ncivil dominium rely upon it in any way? \n\n\nBefore resolving this problem, we will need to address evangelical\ndominium as yet another factor in Wyclif's conception of\nman's postlapsarian state.  \n",
