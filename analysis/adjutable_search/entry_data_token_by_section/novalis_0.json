    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nFriedrich von Hardenberg was born into a family descending from the\nlower-Saxon nobility and spent most of his childhood on the family\nestate of the Oberwiederstedt manor. His father, Heinrich Ulrich\nErasmus von Hardenberg, was the manager of a salt mine and was known\nas a pietist and member of the Herrenhuter (Moravian) Church. His\nsecond wife, Auguste Bernhardine von Hardenberg (ne\u00e9 von B\u00f6lzig),\ngave birth to eleven children, the second of whom was Friedrich. After\nhis initial studies with a private tutor, von Hardenberg went on to\nthe Lutheran grammar school in Eisleben, where he, in line with the\ngeneral educational guidelines at the time, concentrated in rhetoric\nand ancient literature. From the age of twelve, he moved to the home\nof his uncle, Gottlob Friedrich Wilhelm von Hardenberg, who is said to\nhave taken an interest in French enlightenment philosophy. Von\nHardenberg later studied law in Jena, Leipzig, and Wittenberg. He\npassed his final exams in 1794 and moved on to work in the Prussian\ncivil service in Tennstedt, where he also met the young Sophie von\nK\u00fchn. The two got secretly engaged in 1795. Two years later, Sophie\ntragically died at the age of fifteen, an event that would move a\nwhole generation of poets and artists in Germany, including Goethe.\nJust prior to Sophie\u2019s death, Novalis, following in his\nfather\u2019s footsteps, commenced his studies of mining in Freiberg,\nSaxony, and eventually took up an administrative position at the salt\nmines in Wei\u00dfenfels. Throughout this period, he would retain his\ninterest in philosophy, but also explore subjects such as medicine,\ngeology, and biology. He advanced to director of the salt mines and\nbecame engaged for a second time.\n\nFrom his period as a student in Jena onwards, von Hardenberg was well\nconnected with the dominant intellectual circles of the time. He was\nacquainted with Goethe, Fichte, H\u00f6lderlin, Herder, and Jean Paul\n(Richter), and made close friends with Ludwig Tieck, the Schlegel\nbrothers, Schelling, and Schiller (whose lectures he attended in\n1790). Friedrich von Hardenberg died of tuberculosis in March\n1801.\n\nVon Hardenberg did not publish much during his lifetime. His first\npublication, emerging in 1791 in Christoph Martin Wieland\u2019s\nNeuem Teutschen Merkur, was the poem \u201cKlagen eines\nJ\u00fcnglings\u201d. In 1798, he published Pollen\n(Bl\u00fcthenstaub), a collection of 114 aesthetic-philosophical\nfragments and reflections, in the first issue of the\nAthenaeum. The text was edited by Friedrich Schlegel, and\nNovalis\u2019s Miscellaneous Observations is as close as we\nget to a final version from his hand. Only one other collection of\nfragments was published during his lifetime, the controversial\nFaith and Love, also from 1798. In 1799, Novalis finished his\npolitical-religious tract, Christianity or Europe, which\nremained unpublished until after the author\u2019s death. A year\nlater emerged the famous lyrical cycle Hymns to the Night.\nThe rest of his writing consists mainly of posthumously published\nnotes and sketches, including Notes for a Romantic\nEncyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon, 1798/99),\nstudies of Fichte (1795/96), Kant (1797), and Franz Hemsterhuis\n(1797). The pen name Novalis\u2014referring back to an old family\nname while, all the same, conveying the meaning of \u201cthe one who\nclears new ground\u201d\u2014was initially introduced in\n1798.\n\nAfter Novalis\u2019s death, his work was first edited by Tieck and\nFriedrich Schlegel and, subsequently, published in a number of\ndifferent editions. Since 2006, his complete work has been available\nin a six volume historical-critical edition (of which the first volume\nwas launched in 1960), edited by Paul Kluckhohn, Richard Samuel,\nHans-Joachim M\u00e4hl, and Gerhard Schulz, which provides a more adequate\npicture of Novalis\u2019s philosophical reflections than the previous\neditions, helpfully distinguishes between complete and incomplete\ntexts, and offers a valuable apparatus of historical-philological\nfootnotes and commentaries.\n\nIn spite of its momentous impact in the history of Western art and\nthinking, early romantic philosophy lasted for only a short period of\ntime, and is commonly dated to the few years between 1797 and 1801,\nor, in some cases, the period between 1794 and 1808. With its initial\ncenter of gravity in Jena, the famous university town and intellectual\npowerhouse of the time, the romantic circle soon moved its foothold to\nBerlin, whose vivid salon scene offered welcoming new quarters.\nThroughout this period, the early romantic movement evolved around the\nwork of Ludwig Tieck, the Schlegel-brothers Friedrich and August\nWilhelm, as well as the philosopher and classicist Friedrich\nSchleiermacher and the jurist and writer Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder.\nAmong the inner circle were also Caroline Schelling (married to August\nWilhelm Schlegel, later to Schelling), Dorothea Schlegel (married to\nthe banker Simon Veit, later to Friedrich Schlegel), and Sophie Tieck,\nthe poet\u2019s younger sister. Under the editorial leadership of the\nSchlegels, these self-designated romantic writers published the\nshort-lived, yet influential journal Athenaeum, whose famous\nmanifesto states that romanticism is neither merely an aesthetic, nor\na purely academic pursuit\u2014as von Hardenberg optimistically puts\nit: the entire world should be romanticized (LFI #66).\n\nThe notion of the Athenaeum writers establishing a unified\nphilosophical group is due, in part, to their call for a shared\nphilosophizing (Symphilosophie)\u2014their envisioning\nphilosophy as a progressive, collective enterprise, rather than a set\nof solitary contributions of the system-building variety\u2014and the\naccompanying critique of the idea of intellectual authorship that\nwould encourage the adoption of pen-names and countless anonymous\npublications, which also, conveniently, minimized the impact of\ncensorship on individual academic careers and allowed the\nmovement\u2019s female companions to publish and distribute their\nwork. Furthermore, from Hegel onwards, the critics of romantic\nphilosophy have typically favored sweeping claims and totalizing\nrejections rather than careful analysis of particular contributions\nand arguments. (I return to this point in Section Eight.) However, the\ngroup in question had rather porous and flexible boundaries. The\nAthenaeum philosophers were all part of the larger\nintellectual life in Germany. And the romantics not only responded to\nthe most well-known philosophical schools of the time, such as those\nof Kant or Fichte, but were also influenced by a whole host of writers\nand intellectuals whose work, at least within the Anglophone world,\nhave long been forgotten outside the circles of historically minded\nGerman scholars and experts on late eighteenth-century European\nthought. Rather than falling in rank under one unifying program, the\ncontributors to the Athenaeum stand forth as diverse with\nregard to philosophical orientations and insights as well as the\nhistorical-philosophical resources on which they draw.\n",
