    "main_text": "The Calm Between the Storms || Two Equal Competitors\n7.1 Two Equal Competitors\n\nBoth McVittie and Temple presented kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology as equal competitors in accounting for the\ncosmological observations. Unfortunately, as McVittie noted,\nobservations could not, at that time, discriminate between the two\ntheories. Temple\u2019s analysis of Milne\u2019s work praises its\nsimplicity and elegance, and refers in particular to its\noperationalism and axiomatization, which \u201cstart from a\ncompletely novel discussion of the correlation of measurements made by\ndifferent observers in terms of light signals only\u201d (Temple\n1939, p. 468). Throughout the rest of his discussion of the two\ntheories, Temple utilizes Milne\u2019s light-signal correlation\nmethod, explicitly rejecting rigid-rod transport for distance\nmeasurement. Milne\u2019s methods have triumphed.\n\nLater that year McCrea published an important paper in Philosophy\nof Science (McCrea 1939). Put most simply, the paper starts out\nto defend Milne\u2019s methods, but ends up by presenting a\nfull-blown and interesting, although quite unhistorical, account of\nthe evolution and structure of physical theories.\n",
