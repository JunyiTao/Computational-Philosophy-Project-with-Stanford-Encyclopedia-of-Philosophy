Processes are responsible for causal\npropagation, and provide the links connecting causes to\neffects. By opting for continuous processes, instead of causal chains\nconceived as collections of events, Salmon diverged from other\ntheories of probabilistic causality, such as those put forward by\nPatrick Suppes, Irving John Good and Hans Reichenbach. Salmon was\ndeeply convinced that the notion of a causal process can account for\nmany puzzling cases, which other theories find difficult to handle\n(see Salmon 1980 [1998]). Furthermore, he regarded causal processes as\n\u201cthe kinds of causal connections Hume sought but was unable to\nfind\u201d, holding that \u201csuch connections do not violate\nHume\u2019s strictures against mysterious powers\u201d (Salmon 1990b\n[1998: 71]). In order to characterize causal propagation, or\ntransmission, Salmon borrowed from Reichenbach the concept of mark\ntransmission, and from Bertrand Russell the at-at theory\nof causal propagation.\n5.5.1 The Mark Method\n\nReichenbach introduced the mark method in The Philosophy\nof Space and Time (1928 [1957]) to distinguish causal processes\nfrom pseudo-processes. Unlike the latter, causal processes have the\ncapacity to transmit marks, namely various sorts of signals or\ninformation. Salmon\u2019s favorite example is that of a rotating\nspotlight placed at the center of a circular room, which casts a spot\nof light on the wall. The light beam that travels from the source to\nthe wall is a causal process, whereas the light spot that moves around\nthe wall is a pseudo-process. In order to convince us that the light\nray is a genuine process, Salmon invites us to consider what happens\nif a red filter is placed near the source of the beam: the color of\nthe beam will turn red, and so will the spot on the wall. By\ninterposing a red filter between the source and the beam a mark has\nbeen introduced, which is then transmitted along the beam. By\ncontrast, the moving spot on the wall is not a causal process, because\nit lacks the capacity to transmit information; if for instance someone\nwere to place a piece of red cellophane on the wall at some point, the\nlight would turn red when the beam hit the cellophane, but the color\nwould not be retained as the spot moves on.\n\nAs Salmon emphasized, it is the ability to transmit marks\nthat characterizes processes, not the fact that they actually do\nso:\n\n\na process is causal if it is capable of transmitting a mark,\nwhether or not it is actually transmitting one. The fact that\nit has the capacity to transmit a mark is merely a symptom of the fact\nthat it is actually transmitting something else. That other something\nI described as information, structure, and causal influence. (Salmon\n1994b [1998: 253])\n\n5.5.2 The At-At Theory\n\nIn order to account for mark transmission without violating the\nstrictures of Hume\u2019s critique and being exposed to the suspicion\nof introducing some occult causal power, Salmon drew inspiration from\nthe theory of causal lines put forward by Russell in\nHuman Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948). According to\nSalmon, Russell came very close to conceiving a notion of a causal\nprocess similar to his own, when he stated that\n\n\na causal line may always be regarded as the persistence of\nsomething\u2014a person, table, a photon, or what not. Throughout a\ngiven causal line, there may be constancy of quality, constancy of\nstructure. [\u2026] That there are such more or less self-determined\ncausal processes is in no degree logically necessary, but is, I think,\none of the fundamental postulates of science. (Russell 1948: 459,\nquoted from Salmon 1984: 144)\n\n\nAlthough not completely satisfied with some aspects of Russell\u2019s\naccount, Salmon retained his at-at theory of motion, which he\nsummarized as follows:\n\n\nto move from A to B is simply to occupy the\nintervening points at the intervening instants. It consists in being\nat particular points of space at corresponding\nmoments. (Salmon 1984: 153)\n\n\nApplying the at-at theory to causal processes having the capacity to\ntransmit marks results in stipulating that the transmission of a mark\nfrom a given point A in a process to some point B in\nthe same process simply consists in the fact that it appears at each\npoint between A and B. Incidentally, as observed\nearlier\n (\u00a7 4)\n Salmon found Russell\u2019s at-at theory of motion a satisfactory\nsolution to Zeno\u2019s arrow paradox (Salmon 1984:\n151\u2013153).\n\nTo the definition of processes in terms of the capacity to transmit a\nmark, Salmon added a counterfactual clause, to the effect that:\n\n\nA mark that has been introduced into a process by means of a\nsingle intervention at point A is transmitted to point\nB if and only if it occurs at B and at all stages of\nthe process between A and B without additional\ninterventions. (Salmon 1977b [1998: 197], italics original; see\nalso Salmon 1984: 148)\n\n\nThis move was made necessary to obviate a problem connected with a\ncounterexample suggested by Nancy Cartwright. This can be summarized\nas follows: back to the example of the rotating spotlight, suppose\nthat a few nanoseconds before a piece of red cellophane is placed on\nthe wall and turns the moving spot red someone places a red lens on\nthe rotating beacon, so that the beam remains red, not because of the\ncellophane placed on the wall, but because of the lens placed near the\nlight source. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nin such a case the spot turns red owing to a local\ninteraction and remains red without any additional local\ninteraction. With or without the intervention on the wall, the\nspot of light moving around the wall would have been red from that\npoint on. Considerations of such cases required a counterfactual\nformulation of the principle of mark transmission. (Salmon 1994b\n[1998: 252])\n\n\nNotably, Salmon did not associate counterfactuals with the semantic\nview in terms of possible words, adopting instead an experimental\ninterpretation according to which counterfactual statements make\nreference to observed statistical relations which can be tested by\ncontrolled experiments (Salmon 1984: 149\u2013150).\n\nSalmon\u2019s view of processes has been criticized in various ways.\nIn particular, Philip Kitcher (1989) found the experimental view of\ncounterfactuals no more satisfactory than the attempts made by various\nauthors to justify counterfactuals on semantic grounds. Phil Dowe also\nexpressed dissatisfaction with Salmon\u2019s account of causal\nprocesses, and suggested mark transmission to be abandoned in favor of\nan alternative definition in terms of conserved quantities,\nlater adopted by Salmon.\n5.5.3 The Conserved Quantities Approach\n\nThe process theory of causality in terms of conserved quantities\nproposed by Dowe is based on the following:\n\nDefinition 1. A causal interaction is an\nintersection of world lines which involves exchange of a conserved\nquantity.\nDefinition 2. A causal process is a world line of\nan object which manifests a conserved quantity (Dowe 1992: 210).\n\n\nA world line is \u201cthe collection of points on a\nspace-time (Minkowski) diagram which represents the history of an\nobject\u201d, and a conserved quantity \u201cis any\nquantity universally conserved according to current scientific\ntheories\u201d (Dowe 1992: 210; see also Dowe 1995 and 2000).\nExamples of conserved quantities mentioned by Dowe are mass-energy,\nlinear momentum, angular momentum, and charge. Salmon regarded with\nfavor Dowe\u2019s proposal and accepted a slightly modified version\nof it, according to which\n\n\nA process transmits a conserved quantity between A and\nB \\((A \\ne B)\\) if and only if it possesses [a fixed\namount of] this quantity at A and at B and at\nevery stage of the process between A and B without\nany interactions in the open interval \\((A,B)\\) that involve an exchange\nof that particular conserved quantity. (Salmon 1997: 462, italics\noriginal)\n\n\nSalmon deemed a decisive advantage of conserved quantities over mark\ntransmission the fact that causal processes are defined in terms of\ncharacteristics they actually possess, rather than of their\ncapacity to transmit marks. This makes it unnecessary to\nappeal to counterfactuals. Moreover, the conserved quantities approach\nallows one to handle intersections that are untreatable by the mark\nmethod, such as those of Y and \\(\\lambda\\) types. These obtain\nwhenever two processes merge into one\u2014for instance, when a snake\nswallows a mouse\u2014or two processes emerge from one\u2014for\ninstance, when a single-celled organism splits into two cells. A major\ndifference with Dowe\u2019s approach is Salmon\u2019s insistence\nupon causal transmission, as opposed to the mere possession\nof conserved quantities, so that \u201ca process is causal if and\nonly if it transmits a conserved quantity\u201d (Salmon 2010: 10; see\nalso Salmon 1997). The capacity to transmit conserved quantities\nprovides an easy way to distinguish causal from pseudo processes,\nwhich do not have that capacity. The at-at theory of transmission is\nretained, to mean that a conserved quantity \u201cis at the\nappropriate place at the appropriate stage in the\nprocess\u201d (Salmon 2010: 10). The mark method keeps an important\nrole as a tool for detecting causal relationships.\n5.5.4 Causal Production\n\nAnother fundamental ingredient of Salmon\u2019s theory of causality\nis the notion of production. Causal production takes place\nwhenever two processes intersect each other in such a way that their\nstructure is modified, and the modification will be propagated by\nprocesses until another interaction takes place. The kind of\nintersection between processes that gives rise to causal production is\ndescribed by interactive forks.\n\nProcesses and conjunctive and interactive forks are the ingredients of\nthe mechanistic picture of the world that Salmon had in mind.\nConjunctive and interactive forks represent two different ways in\nwhich processes can intersect one another, and fulfill different tasks\nwithin Salmon\u2019s perspective. Thanks to their screening off\ncapacity, conjunctive forks detect order and asymmetries among the\ncausal connections forming mechanisms, whereas interactive forks are\nthe sites of causal production. The temporal asymmetry characterizing\nconjunctive forks is absent from interactive forks, which describe\nphysical interactions taking place at a certain moment in a certain\nplace. Interactive forks are more basic than conjunctive forks,\nbecause they express a causal concept which can be \u201cexplicated\nwithout recourse to other causal concepts\u201d (Salmon 1994b [1998:\n249]). Salmon called attention to the fact that\n\n\nthere is a striking difference between conjunctive common causes on\nthe one hand and causal processes and interactions on the other.\nCausal processes and causal interactions seem to be governed by basic\nlaws of nature in ways that do not apply to conjunctive forks.\n[\u2026] Although I am not prepared to argue the case in detail, it\nseems plausible to suppose that all fundamental physical\ninteractions can be regarded as exemplifications of the\ninteractive fork. Conjunctive common causes are not nearly as closely\ntied to the laws of nature. [\u2026] in contrast to causal processes\nand causal interactions, conjunctive forks depend crucially on de\nfacto background conditions. (Salmon 1982a [1998: 299])\n\n5.6 Two Levels of Explanation\n\nUnlike conjunctive forks, causal processes and interactions cannot be\ndefined in purely statistical terms. To stress this crucial\ndifference, Salmon referred to statistical causality in terms\nof screening off and conjunctive forks, and aleatory\ncausality in terms of processes and interactive forks. Aleatory\ncausality \u201cplaces primary emphasis on the mechanisms of\ncausality\u201d (Salmon 1990c [1998: 207]) and informs us about how\nphenomena fit within the mechanisms responsible for their occurrence.\nStatistical regularities are all that is needed by statistical\ncausality, whereas aleatory causality requires more, namely the\npossibility to speak of tendencies that are both causal and\nprobabilistic. Salmon thought that propensities, taken as causal\nprobabilistic tendencies\n (\u00a7 2.3),\n prove fruitful in that connection, and held that:\n\n\nif we think of propensities as probabilistic causes, we can use the\nconcepts of causal processes and causal mechanisms in order to explain\nthe mechanisms of probabilistic causality. (Salmon 1990c [1998:\n205])\n\n\nTo the two kinds of causality described by Salmon there correspond two\ndifferent levels of explanation: (1) the S-R model, which concerns\nconnections between kinds of events, and (2) causal mechanical\nexplanation, which bears upon single events. It should not pass\nunnoticed that while explanation of the first level, based on\nstatistical correlations, provides a good basis for prediction,\nexplanation in terms of aleatory causality traces back the history of\nevents after their occurrence. In the Eighties, Salmon thought that\nonly aleatory causality could offer an adequate understanding of\ncausality and regarded the causal mechanical level as genuine\nexplanation, assigning an ancillary role to the S-R level.\n\nIn a penetrating discussion Christopher Hitchcock observed that\nSalmon\u2019s causal mechanical explanation was too weak, because it\nenvisaged a geometrical network of processes and interactions but did\nnot convey any hint as to what properties should be taken as\nexplanatory. In agreement with Woodward (1984), Hitchcock held that\nexplanation should answer\n\u201cwhat-if-things-had-been-different\u201d questions, and claimed\nthat\n\n\na successful account of explanation had better make the relation of\nexplanatory relevance look roughly like that of counterfactual\ndependence. (Hitchcock 1995: 311)\n\n\nAccording to Hitchcock\n\n\nour demand that explanations provide relevant information\nrequires something stronger\u2014that we be told which\nearlier properties the properties specified in the explanandum depend\nupon. (Hitchcock 1995: 311)\n\n\na requisite Salmon\u2019s definition of processes and causal\ntransmission does not meet. By way of a counterexample, Hitchcock\nobserved that based on Salmon\u2019s theory a blue spot impressed on\na billiard ball by a stick on which a player had put blue chalk would\ncount as a mark transmitted by a causal process, and furthermore one\nwould be unable to tell why the linear momentum of the\nbilliard ball should be included in the explanation of its movement,\nwhereas the blue mark should not.\n\nIn reply to Hitchcock, Salmon revised his position by ascribing equal\nsignificance to the two levels of explanation. In \u201cA Reply to\nTwo Critiques\u201d he wrote:\n\n\nI would now say (1) that statistical relevance relations, in the\nabsence of connecting causal processes, lack explanatory import and\n(2) that connecting causal processes, in the absence of statistical\nrelevance relations, also lack explanatory import. [\u2026] Both are\nindispensable. (Salmon 1997: 476)\n\n\nThe causal model in terms of processes was compared to a telephone\nnetwork which exhibits the lines of communications and the\nconnections, but does not convey any information about the messages\nthat are sent. In order to identify the properties pertinent to given\noutcomes one needs information on statistical relevance relations; the\nprocedure of singling out such properties results from an interplay\nbetween causal and statistical relevance information. On the one hand,\na network of causal processes and interactions serves to exclude\nirrelevant factors which are not there at the considered place and\ntime; on the other, the network has to be filled with statistical\nrelevance relations linking the properties present.\n\nContextually, Salmon admitted that counterfactual considerations play\na role within explanation, and reaffirmed a close connection between\nstatistical relevance relations and counterfactuals. To take\nSalmon\u2019s example,\n\n\nwhen asserting that a window was shattered because it was struck by a\nbaseball traveling at a considerable velocity, we presumably have in\nmind that the window would not have broken if the intersection with\nthe baseball had not occurred. (Salmon 1997: 475)\n\n\nSuch a counterfactual is deemed unproblematic because it is supported\nby well-established assertions of statistical relevance, which are\nnothing other than reports of observed relative frequencies.\n5.7 Ontic Conception\n\nSalmon termed his conception of explanation ontic, as opposed\nto the epistemic conception heralded by Hempel, and the erotetic\napproach defended by van Fraassen (Salmon 1985a [1998] and 1982b\n[1998]). According to the ontic viewpoint events are explained by\nshowing how they fit into the mechanisms operating in the world, and\nthe causal processes and interactions of which mechanisms are\ncompounded are physical entities. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nTo understand the world and what goes on in it, we must expose its\ninner workings. To the extent that causal mechanisms operate, they\nexplain how the world works. [\u2026] A detailed knowledge of the\nmechanisms may not be required for successful prediction; it is\nindispensable to the attainment of genuine scientific understanding.\n(Salmon 1984: 133)\n\n\nAlbeit he never gave up the task of developing an objective and\nrealistic concept of explanation, in the Nineties Salmon granted the\nimportance of pragmatic considerations in connection with causal\nexplanation. In this vein, he admitted that causal analysis can be\nperformed at different levels of detail, depending on the\ncircumstances. In some cases, phenomena can be analyzed in great\ndetail, based on scientific theories, but more often they can be\nexamined at varying degrees of abstraction, determined by the context.\nIn \u201cA Realistic Account of Causation\u201d, published\nposthumously in 2002, Salmon argued that\n\n\nthe major obstacle to the creation of a fully objective and realistic\ntheory of cause-effect relations is the fact that the instances we\ntend to select are highly context dependent. (Salmon 2002: 123)\n\n\nAfter examining a number of examples he concluded that\n\u201ccause-effect statements are almost always\u2014if not\nalways\u2014context dependent\u201d (Salmon 2002: 125).\n\nThat said, Salmon retained the idea of a complete causal\nstructure including all the processes and interactions operating\nin a certain space-time region. Such a concept bears some resemblance\nto Peter Railton\u2019s \u201cideal explanatory text\u201d (Railton\n1981), the difference being that Railton has a text in mind, while\nSalmon\u2019s complete causal structure is a physical entity. The\nmost important feature characterizing the complete causal structure is\nits objectivity: \u201cthe complete causal structure is a fact of\nnature that exists quite independently of our knowledge or\ninterests\u201d (Salmon 2002: 126).\n\nThe role played by scientific theories within Salmon\u2019s\nmechanistic view should not pass unnoticed. Both causal production and\nprocesses defined in terms of conserved quantities include an appeal\nto theories and laws of nature, because only \u201cour current\ntheories tell us what quantities to think of as conserved\u201d\n(Salmon 1994b [1998: 258]). Similarly, to describe causal interactions\none must appeal to laws such as the conservation of energy and\nmomentum. This led Salmon to conclude:\n\n\nI realize that the theory I am proposing has a highly reductionistic\nflavor. It seems to me that my account should hold in the natural\nsciences\u2014including biology, but not quantum mechanics\u2014I am\nnot confident that it is suitable for psychology and the social\nsciences. (Salmon 2002: 131)\n\n\nA similar conclusion, which further clarifies Salmon\u2019s attitude\ntowards reductionism, is to be found in \u201cThe Causal Structure of\nthe World\u201d:\n\n\nFinally, although my tone in this talk has been rather reductionistic,\nI do not hold a reductionist point of view. It is quite possible that\nother kinds of causation are present in such areas as psychology and\nsociology, where human intentions and interrelations are involved.\nPhysical causation must apply at the basic level of perception and\ncommunication, but there may be more. I would not commit myself to a\nreductionist\u2014or antireductionist\u2014viewpoint unless I had at\nleast an acceptable solution to the mind-body problem, and that is\nsomething I don\u2019t have at present, and I doubt that I\u2019ll\never find one in my lifetime. (Salmon 2010: 12)\n\n\nFurther reading: On Hempel\u2019s theory of explanation see\nHempel 1965 and Fetzer 2010 [2017]. On the notion of probabilistic\ncausality and the relative debate see Hitchcock 1997 [2016] and Beebe,\nHitchcock & Menzies (eds.) 2009. Salmon\u2019s view of a causal\nprocess and Dowe\u2019s conserved quantities theory are discussed in\nDowe 2000. The debate on explanation is surveyed in Woodward 2003\n[2017].\n\nSalmon\u2019s theory of causal explanation had a strong impact on the\nliterature, especially in connection with the biological and medical\nsciences. Bringing to the fore the notion of mechanism, Salmon\nstimulated the formation of the so-called \u2018new\nmechanicism\u2019, see Glennan 2017, and spurred a renewed interest\nin the process approach to explanation, see among others Damman 2020,\nand Nicholson & Dupr\u00e9 (eds.) 2018.\n6. Rationality and Realism\n6.1 Rationality\n\nCausal explanation, probability, and the Bayesian method are the key\ningredients of Salmon\u2019s view of rationality, which is strictly\nentrenched with his version of realism. A further ingredient is the\nnotion of propensity taken as causal tendency (see\n \u00a7 2.3).\n Salmon\u2019s \u201cRationality and Objectivity in Science\u201d\n(1990d [2005]) defines three grades of rationality standing in\ndifferent relationships with objectivity. The first kind of\nrationality has no connection with objectivity and is identified with\nthe coherence of degrees of conviction, a key requirement of the\nBayesian method. This is called static rationality. Bayesian\nconditionalization, offering a tool to update one\u2019s degree of\nconviction, shapes a stronger type of rationality called\nkinematic. The highest grade of rationality is called\ndynamic, and involves a closer connection with\nobjectivity.\n\nDynamic rationality is dealt with in some detail in \u201cDynamic\nRationality: Propensity, Probability, and Credence\u201d (1988b\n[2005]). This kind of rationality revolves around the tenet that\nrational action must obey the maxim: Respect the frequencies.\nFor it to be accomplished, credence, or the degree of conviction\nleading to action, must be empirically informed, namely it should take\ninto account objective facts. Salmon holds that explanation has a\ncrucial role in that connection because causal knowledge of phenomena\nprovides the optimal basis for action. The notion of propensity is\ndeemed no less fundamental and is assigned the purpose of bridging the\ngap between objective probabilities, namely frequencies, and personal\nprobabilities on whose basis people act. Personal probabilities should\nnot be construed in a subjective sense, not only because for Salmon\nsubjectivism is not an admissible interpretation of probability\n (\u00a7 2.3),\n but more generally because subjective opinions cannot be taken to\noffer good grounds for rational action. Rational action can only be\nbased on rational degrees of conviction, the emphasis being on\nrational as opposed to merely subjective.\n\nAs Salmon observed,\n\n\nit is the operations of physical devices having [\u2026]\npropensities\u2014chance setups, including our own actions\u2014that\nproduce the actual short-run frequencies, on which our fortunes\ndepend, as well as the long-run frequencies which I am calling\nprobabilities. (Salmon 1988b [2005: 148])\n\n\nAssigning a propensity to a chance setup amounts to making a causal\nhypothesis, which can be evaluated by means of Bayes\u2019 rule.\nSince Salmon\u2019s objective Bayesianism\n (\u00a7 3.2)\n holds that prior probabilities are determined on the basis of\nobserved frequencies, the latter are the cornerstone on which the\nwhole procedure of confirming the hypotheses about propensities rests.\nTo sum up, dynamic rationality\n\n\nconsists in the attempt to use propensities\u2014i.e., probabilistic\ncauses\u2014as the weighting factors that occur in the formula for\nexpected utility. Since we cannot be sure that our choices and\ndecisions will be fully efficacious in bringing about desired results,\nit is reasonable to rely on the strengths of probabilistic causes.\nThis line of thought treats our voluntary choices, decisions, and\nactions as probabilistic causes of what happens as a result of our\ndeliberations. Dynamic rationality involves a\npropensity-driven view of objective probabilities and\nshort-run frequencies. (Salmon 1988b [2005: 150])\n\n6.2 Realism\n\nDeeply convinced of the tenability of scientific realism, Salmon\nargued in favor of its compatibility with empiricism. His argument\nrevolves around what he calls the key question, phrased as\nfollows:\n\n\nDo we have empirical evidence that gives us just about as much reason\nto believe in the existence of such entities as molecules, atoms,\nions, and subatomic particles as we have for our belief in\nmiddle-sized material objects? (Salmon 2005: 32)\n\n\nThe possibility of combining empiricism and realism is made to depend\non an affirmative answer to this question, which Salmon claimed had\nnot been given serious consideration by most philosophers of science,\nincluding van Fraassen, whose constructive empiricism implies a\nnegative answer to the key question, and therefore the incompatibility\nbetween empiricism and realism.\n\nIn order to provide an affirmative answer to the key question, Salmon\nonce again drew inspiration from Reichenbach\u2019s work. In\nExperience and Prediction Reichenbach tackled the issue of\nour knowledge of the external world by means of a fictional example.\nHe imagined a \u201ccubical world\u201d whose inhabitants cannot\npenetrate either the walls or the ceiling, made of a translucent\nsubstance. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nAs a result of a complicated arrangement of lights and mirrors,\nshadows of the birds outside of the cube are projected onto the\nceiling and the left-hand wall. The inhabitants of the cubical world\ncan see the shadows cast by the external birds, but they cannot see\nthe actual birds, mirrors, or lighting system. For beings in the\ncubical world, the birds are truly unobserved entities. (Salmon 1999:\n303)\n\n\nAfter careful observations, a scientist in the cubical world notices\nthere are correlations between the shadows on the ceiling and those on\nthe wall. After having repeatedly observed such correlations, the\nscientist infers the probabilistic hypothesis that there must exist\nsomething responsible for the shadows seen on the walls and ceiling.\nThe reasoning leading to that conclusion is nothing other than an\ninference to a common cause. Although the principle of the\ncommon cause (see\n \u00a7 5.4.1)\n was introduced by Reichenbach in The Direction of Time,\npublished posthumously in 1956, and does not appear at all in\nExperience and Prediction (1938), Salmon conjectured that the\nidea was already there, as testified by Reichenbach\u2019s tenet that\nany physicist who happens to repeatedly observe some coincidences\n\u201cwill not believe in a matter of chance but will look for a\ncausal connection\u201d (Reichenbach 1938: 121).\n\nFor Salmon, the fundamental role played by the principle of the common\ncause in connection with realism was testified by a great many\nexamples in the history of science, his favorite being Perrin\u2019s\nascertainment of Avogadro\u2019s number around 1912. As recounted by\nMary Jo Nye in Molecular Reality (1972), after Perrin showed\nthat Avogadro\u2019s number could be determined by means of thirteen\ndifferent methods, all producing results in close agreement, the\ncommunity of physicists was convinced of the reality of atoms and\nmolecules. According to Salmon, Perrin\u2019s conclusion was reached\nby means of an inductive reasoning which \u201ccan appropriately be\nschematized as a type of common cause argument\u201d (Salmon 1985b\n[2005: 17]). From this and other examples Salmon concluded that a\npowerful method for inferring hypotheses from empirical evidence of\nregularities, the principle of the common cause provides a tool for\ninferring unobservables from observables.\n\nThis, however, is only part of the story. Salmon believed that the\nanswer to the key question \u201clies in connecting the common cause\nprinciple and Bayes\u2019s theorem\u201d (Salmon 1994a [2005: 25]).\nAlthough crediting him for having grasped the same idea, Salmon found\nReichenbach\u2019s treatment incomplete, because it contains only\nsketchy remarks in that regard. He therefore set himself the task of\nworking out a detailed argument, spelled out in \u201cOrnithology in\na Cubical World\u201d (1999) and \u201cAn Empiricist Argument for\nRealism\u201d published as Chapter 3 of Reality and\nRationality. In Salmon\u2019s own words, his purpose was:\n\n\nto show how the considerations that convinced serious physical\nscientists of the reality of atoms and molecules in the early years of\nthe twentieth century provide a philosophically sound argument for\nrealism that does not exceed the bounds of empiricism. (2005: x)\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the fruitfulness of combining Bayes\u2019 rule with\nthe principle of the common cause amounts to the fact that those\nhypotheses which embody information on common causes are apt to be\nassigned higher prior probabilities than hypotheses which involve mere\ncoincidences.\n\nSalmon reached this conclusion by scrutinizing the way scientists\nachieved a number of important findings, such as the existence of\natoms and molecules. His in-depth analysis of case studies belonging\nto the history of science, carried out with respect to both\nmicroscopic objects and the submicroscopic domain, confers on\nSalmon\u2019s argument for realism a peculiar significance and\noriginality.\n\nFurther reading: The volume Reality and Rationality\n(Salmon 2005) contains many articles on Salmon\u2019s views on\nrationality and realism.",
