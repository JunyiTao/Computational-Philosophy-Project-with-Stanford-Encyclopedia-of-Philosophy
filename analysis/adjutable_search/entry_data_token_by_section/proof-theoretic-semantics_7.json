    "main_text": "Some versions of proof-theoretic semantics || Categorial proof theory\n2.5 Categorial proof theory\n\nThere is a considerable literature on category theory in relation to\nproof theory, and, following seminal work by Lawvere, Lambek and\nothers (see Lambek and Scott, 1986), category theory itself can be\nviewed as a kind of abstract proof theory. If one looks at an arrow\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) in a category as a kind of abstract proof of \\(B\\)\nfrom \\(A\\), we have a representation which goes beyond pure\nderivability of \\(B\\) from \\(A\\) (as the arrow has its individuality),\nbut does not deal with the particular syntactic structure of this\nproof. For intuitionistic systems, proof-theoretic semantics in\ncategorial form comes probably closest to what denotational semantics\nis in the classical case.\n\nOne of the most highly developed approaches to categorial proof theory\nis due to Do\u0161en. He has not only advanced the application of\ncategorial methods in proof theory (e.g., Do\u0161en and\nPetri\u0107, 2004), but also shown how proof-theoretic methods can be\nused in category theory itself (Do\u0161en, 2000). Most important\nfor categorial logic in relation to proof-theoretic semantics is that\nin categorial logic, arrows always come together with an identity\nrelation, which in proof-theory corresponds to the identity of proofs.\nIn this way, ideas and results of categorial proof theory pertain to\nwhat may be called intensional proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 3.7),\n that is, the study of proofs as entities in their own right, not just\nas vehicles to establish consequences (Do\u0161en, 2006; 2016).\n\nAs there is the strong relationship between arrows in the categorial\nsense and proofs in the sense of deductive reasoning, there are\ncategorial analogues to practically all concepts dealt with in the\ndeductive realm, often with novel methods, ideas and results that\nsupplement deductive approaches in a very productive way. Categorial\nproof-theoretic semantics is a very broad research area that runs in\nparallel to the deductive perspective adopted in this entry \u2015\nthe deductive perspective is by far more common in philosophy. In the\nfield of intuitionistic logic, categorial logic covers highly advanced\ntopics: beyond standard quantifier logic dependent type theories in\nthe tradition of Martin-L\u00f6f (see section\n 2.2.3)\n including homotopy type theory. For many other logical systems\ncategorial semantics have been developed, including classical logic\nand various substructural logics such as linear logic.\n\nA philosophically highly significant general feature of categorial\nproof-theory is its inherently hypothetical character. This is due to\nthe fact that it starts from hypothetical statements \\(A \\rightarrow\nB\\) (arrows) rather than categorical statements \\(A\\)\n(\u201ccategorical\u201d as opposed to \u201chypothetical\u201d,\nnot \u201ccategorial\u201d which is used here for \u201cpertaining\nto category theory\u201d). It this way it overcomes a paradigm of\nstandard, in particular validity-based, proof-theoretic semantics (see\nsection\n 3.6).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nFor categorial approaches in general see the entry on\n category theory\n and the entry on\n structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nFor categorial proof-theoretic semantics see Pym, Ritter, and\nRobinson (2023, other internet resources).\n",
