Randomness Without Chance\n\n\nThe counterexamples to RCT offered in\n \u00a7\u00a74.3\u20134.4\n suggest strongly that\nthe appeal of RCT depends on our curious tendency to take independent\nidentically distributed trials, like the Bernoulli process of fair coin\ntossing, to be paradigms of chance processes. Yet when we widen our\ngaze to encompass a fuller range of chance processes, the appeal of the\nright-to-left direction of RCT is quite diminished. It is now time to\nexamine potential counterexamples to the other direction of RCT. There\nare a number of plausible cases where a random sequence potentially\nexists without chance. Many of these cases involve interesting features\nof classical physics, which is apparently not chancy, and yet which\ngives rise to a range of apparently random phenomena. Unfortunately\nsome engagement with the details of the physics is unavoidable in the\nfollowing.\n\n\nOne obvious potential counterexample involves coin tossing. Some\nhave maintained that coin tossing is a deterministic process, and as\nsuch entirely without chances, and yet which produces outcome sequences\nwe have been taking as paradigm of random sequences. This will be set\naside until\n \u00a77,\n where the claim that determinism\nprecludes chance will be examined.\n",
