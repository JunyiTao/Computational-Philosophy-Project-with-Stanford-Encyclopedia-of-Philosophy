    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Realistic Empiricism: Powerful Qualities\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe traditional versions of neutral monism of Mach, James, and Russell\nreflect the empiricist outlook of their authors. This leads them to\nturn to experience when searching for their neutral entities. And this\nleads many to see their doctrines as tainted by mentalism. Perhaps the\ntraditional neutral monists were wrong to forge this tight link\nbetween the neutral entities and experience. Or perhaps critics are\ntoo quick in dismissing their efforts to discover a neutral base in\nthis area. The rising interest in the history of analytic\nphilosophy\u2014especially the gradual rediscovery of Russell as a\nmetaphysician and epistemologist\u2014offers some hope for better\nunderstanding of traditional neutral monism.\n\nBut the fortunes of neutral monism are no longer exclusively tied to\nthe fate of traditional neutral monism. The neutral monist strand\nwithin the broader movement of Russellian monism is a promising new\ndevelopment. And some contemporary attempts to revive neutral monism\nare free of any ties to the traditional versions of the doctrine.\nThomas Nagel\u2019s recent defense of neutral monism comes to mind.\nAnd the idea to make abstract entities\u2014information, structure,\ncomputation, mathematical reality\u2014into the neutral basis of a\nmetaphysical system is being actively developed by philosophers and\nscientists alike.\n\nUntil quite recently it seemed that neutral monism (in its traditional\nform) was a brief and unimportant sideshow on the grand stage of\nmetaphysics. Notwithstanding the fact that the three main\nprotagonists\u2014Mach, James, and Russell\u2014were important\nfigures, whose ideas profoundly influenced many areas of contemporary\nthought, their speculations about neutral monism seemed to have\nvanished from the philosophical scene. But the current wave of\ninterest in the traditional versions of neutral monism, as well as the\nlively development of alternative versions of neutral monism, indicate\nthat neutral monism is, once more, becoming a live option in the\nongoing efforts to explore the metaphysics of\n mind.[26]\n",
