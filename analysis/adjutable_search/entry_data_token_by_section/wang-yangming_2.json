    "main_text": "Unity of Knowing and Acting\n3. Unity of Knowing and Acting\nSome aspects of Wang\u2019s philosophy can be understood as refining or\ndrawing out the full implications of Lu Xiangshan\u2019s critique of Zhu\nXi.  Like Lu, Wang stressed that the Pattern is fully present in the\nmind of every person: \u201cThe mind is Pattern.  Is there\nany affair outside the mind?  Is there any Pattern outside the\nmind?\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n 264)[6] \n As a result, the\ntheoretical study of ethics is unnecessary.  All a moral agent needs\nto do is exercise \u201cpure knowing.\u201d This view may seem naive\nat first glance.  However, this is partially due to the different foci\nof Chinese and Western ethics.  Metaethics and normative ethical\ntheory are substantial parts of Western ethics, but less central to\nChinese ethics.  In addition, recent Western ethics manifests an\ninterest in abstract ethical dilemmas that is perhaps disproportionate\nto the relevance of these quandaries in practice.  In contrast, the\nfocus of much Chinese ethics, particularly Confucianism, is applied\nethical cultivation.  Consequently, Lu and Wang were primarily\ninterested in having a genuine positive effect on the ethical lives of\ntheir followers.  There is some plausibility to the claim that (even\nin our own complex, multicultural intellectual context) most of us\nknow what our basic ethical obligations are.  For example, as a\nteacher, I have an obligation to grade assignments promptly and\nfairly.  As a colleague, I have an obligation to take my turn serving\nas chair.  As a parent, I have an obligation to make time to share my\nchildren\u2019s interests.  Due to selfish desires, it is tempting to\nprocrastinate in grading essays, or try to evade departmental service,\nor ignore the emotional needs of one\u2019s children.  However, it is not\nas if it is genuinely difficult to figure out that these are our\nobligations.\nWang\u2019s most distinctive and well-known doctrine is the unity of\nknowing and acting (zh\u012b x\u00edng h\u00e9 y\u012b).\nIn order to grasp the significance of this doctrine, consider a\nstudent who is being questioned by a college honor code panel after\nbeing caught plagiarizing an essay.  If the honor code panel asked the\nstudent whether he knew that plagiarism was wrong, it would not be\nsurprising for the student to reply, \u201cYes, I knew it was wrong\nto plagiarize my essay, but I wanted so much to get an easy A that I\ngave in to temptation.\u201d Western philosophers would describe this\nas a case of akrasia, or weakness of will.  Zhu Xi, along\nwith many Western philosophers like Aristotle, would acknowledge that\nthe student had correctly described his psychological state.  However,\nWang Yangming would deny that the student actually knew that\nplagiarism was wrong: \u201cThere never have been people who know but\ndo not act.  Those who \u2018know\u2019 but do not act simply do not\nyet know\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 267).  One of Wang\u2019s\nprimary claims is that merely verbal assent is inadequate to\ndemonstrate actual knowledge: \u201cOne cannot say he knows filial\npiety or brotherly respect simply because he knows how to say\nsomething filial or brotherly.  Knowing pain offers another good\nexample.  One must have experienced pain oneself in order to know\npain.\u201d Wang also adduces cold and hunger as things that one must\nexperience in order to know.  We might object that Wang\u2019s example\nshows, at most, that someone must have had an experience of goodness\nor evil at some point in his life in order to know what it\nmeans for something to be good or evil.  This falls short of the\nconclusion that Wang needs, though, for just as I can know what you\nmean when you say \u201cI am hungry\u201d even if I am not currently\nmotivated to eat, so might I know that \u201cplagiarism is\nwrong,\u201d even if I am not motivated to avoid plagiarism myself in\nthis circumstance.\n\n\nA more promising line of argument for Wang is his appropriation of an\nexample from the Great Learning (Commentary 6), which\nsuggests that loving the good is \u201clike loving a lovely\nsight,\u201d while hating evil is \u201clike hating a hateful\nodor\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 191).  To recognize an odor\nas disgusting (a kind of knowing) is to be repulsed by it (a\nmotivation), which leads to avoiding the odor or eliminating its\nsource (actions).  The Chinese phrase rendered \u201cloving a lovely\nsight\u201d (h\u00e0o h\u01ceo s\u00e8) has connotations\nof finding someone sexually \nattractive.[7]\n To regard someone as sexually attractive (a\nkind of cognition) is to be drawn toward them (a kind of motivation\nthat can lead to action).  To this, one might object that Wang\u2019s\nexamples show, at most, that knowing something is good or bad requires\nthat one have some level of appropriate motivation.  Even if\nwe grant the relevance of Wang\u2019s examples, it is possible to have an\nintrinsic motivation that does not result in action.  Recognizing that\nsomeone is sexually attractive certainly does not always result in\npursuing an assignation, for example.\n Perhaps Wang\u2019s most compelling line of argument is a pragmatic one\nabout the aim or purpose behind discussing knowing and acting.  He\nallows that it may be useful and legitimate to discuss knowing\nseparately from acting or acting separately from knowing, but only in\norder to address the failings of specific kinds of individuals.  On\nthe one hand, \u201cthere is a type of person in the world who\nfoolishly acts upon impulse without engaging in the slightest thought\nor reflection.  Because they always act blindly and recklessly, it is\nnecessary to talk to them about knowing\u2026,\u201d without\nemphasizing acting.  On the other hand, \u201c[t]here is also a type\nof person who is vague and irresolute; they engage in speculation\nwhile suspended in a vacuum and are unwilling to apply themselves to\nany concrete actions\u201d (268). These latter people benefit from\nadvice that emphasizes action, without necessarily discussing\nknowledge.  However, those in Wang\u2019s era who distinguish knowledge and\naction (and here he has in mind those who follow the orthodox\nphilosophy of Zhu Xi) \u201cseparate knowing and acting into two\ndistinct tasks to perform and think that one must first know and only\nthen can one act.\u201d As a result, they become nothing more than\npedantic bookworms, who study ethics without ever living up to its\nideals or trying to achieve positive change in the world around them.\nWang concludes, \u201cMy current teaching regarding the unity of\nknowing and acting is a medicine directed precisely at this\ndisease.\u201d\n",
