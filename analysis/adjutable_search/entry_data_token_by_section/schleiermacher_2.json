    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n3. Philosophy of Mind\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of mind is found mainly in his\nlectures on psychology. It is too extensive to present in detail here.\nBut the following four central principles\u2014all of which have\ntheir roots in Herder, and especially in Herder\u2019s main work on\nthe philosophy of mind, On the Cognition and Sensation of the\nHuman Soul (1778)\u2014are especially striking and\nimportant:\n\nSchleiermacher argues for a strong dependence of the soul (or\nmind) on the body, and indeed for their identity. However, he resists\nreductionism in either direction, arguing that both what he calls\n\u201cspiritualism\u201d (i.e., the reduction of the body to the\nmind) and \u201cmaterialism\u201d (i.e., the reduction of the mind\nto the body) are errors. He refers to the sort of non-reductive unity\nof mind and body that he instead champions as \u201clife\u201d.\nSchleiermacher also identifies the soul (or mind) with\n\u201cforce\u201d. Thus already in On Freedom\n(1790\u20133) he writes that the soul is \u201ca force or a\ncomposite of forces\u201d.\nSchleiermacher also argues strongly for the unity of the soul (or\nmind) within itself: the soul is not composed of separate faculties\n(e.g., sensation, understanding, imagination, reason, desire). He\nhimself often works with a twofold distinction between what he calls\nthe mind\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d (i.e., sensory) and\n\u201cintellectual\u201d functions, but he holds these too to be at\nbottom identical.\nSchleiermacher argues that human minds, while they certainly share\nsimilarities, are also deeply different from each other\u2014not only\nacross social groups such as peoples and genders, but also at the\nlevel of individuals who belong to the same groups. He holds that the\ndeep distinctiveness of individual minds sometimes exercises an\nimportant influence on the development of society at large\u2014both\nin the political-ethical sphere (where he calls the individuals who\nplay such a role \u201cheroes\u201d) and in the sphere of thought\nand art (where he calls them \u201cgeniuses\u201d). He argues that\nthe distinctiveness of individual minds cannot be explained by any\nprocess of calculation (in particular, that it is a mistake to suppose\nthat all human minds begin the same and only come to differ due to the\nimpact of different causal influences on their development, which\nmight in principle be calculated). It can, however, be understood by\nmeans of \u201cdivination\u201d (concerning which more anon).\n\n\nFinally, one feature of Schleiermacher\u2019s philosophy of mind that\ndistinguishes it from Herder\u2019s, and from other German\npredecessors\u2019, is also worth noting: Schleiermacher says\nrelatively little about unconscious mental processes, and\nwhen he does mention them often seems skeptical about them. For\nexample, he argues that thought cannot be unconscious, and that\nso-called \u201cobscure representations\u201d are in fact merely\nsensuous images that do not involve thoughts.\n",
