Church\nsaid:\n\n\nThe author [Turing] proposes as a criterion that an infinite sequence\nof digits 0 and 1 be \u201ccomputable\u201d that it shall be\npossible to devise a computing machine, occupying a finite space and\nwith working parts of a finite size, which will write down the\nsequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a\nsufficiently long time. (Church 1937a: 42)\n\n\nHowever, there was no requirement proposed in Turing\u2019s 1936\npaper that Turing machines occupy \u201ca finite space\u201d or have\n\u201cworking parts of a finite size\u201d. Nor did Turing couch\nmatters in terms of the machine\u2019s writing down \u201cany\ndesired number of terms\u201d of the sequence, \u201cif allowed to\nrun for a sufficiently long time\u201d. Turing said, on the contrary,\nthat a sequence is \u201ccomputable if it can be computed by a\ncircle-free machine\u201d (Turing 1936 [2004: 61]); where a machine\nis circle-free if it is not one that\n\n\nnever writes down more than a finite number of symbols [0s and 1s].\n(Turing 1936 [2004: 60])\n\n\nIn consequence, Church\u2019s version of Turing\u2019s thesis is\nsubtly different from Turing\u2019s own:\n\n\nChurch\u2019s Turing\u2019s thesis:\n\nAn infinite sequence of digits is \u201ccomputable\u201d if (and\nonly if) it is possible to devise a computing machine, occupying a\nfinite space and with working parts of a finite size, that will write\ndown the sequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for\na sufficiently long time.\n\n\nIn so far as Church includes these three finiteness requirements\n(i.e., that the machine occupy a finite space, have finite-sized\nparts, and produce finite numbers of digits), his version of\nTuring\u2019s thesis can perhaps be said to be \u201cmore\nphysical\u201d than any of Turing\u2019s formulations of the thesis.\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements are in some respects\nreminiscent of Gandy\u2019s idea that the states of a discrete\ndeterministic calculating machine must be built up iteratively from a\nbounded number of types of basic components, the dimensions of which\nhave a lower bound (see\n Section 6.4.2).\n Although, as explained there, Gandy imposes further requirements on a\ndiscrete deterministic calculating machine, and these go far beyond\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements.\n\nNotwithstanding Church\u2019s efforts to inject additional physical\nrealism into the concept of a Turing machine, it is\u2014as in\nTuring\u2019s case\u2014unknown whether Church would, if queried,\nhave assented to the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n or any cognate thesis. There seems to be no textual evidence either\nway. Church was simply silent about such matters.\n",
