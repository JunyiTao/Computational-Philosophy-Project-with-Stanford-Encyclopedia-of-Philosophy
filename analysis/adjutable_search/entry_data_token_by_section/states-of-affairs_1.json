    "main_text": "Introducing States of Affairs || A Theoretical Role for States of Affairs\n1.2 A Theoretical Role for States of Affairs\n\nIn order to answer this question, consider a school exercise in\nprobability (see Kripke 1980: 16). Take two ordinary dice, \\(D_{1}\\)\nand \\(D_{2}\\), with six sides each. For each die, there are six\npossible outcomes of a throw. \\(D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{2}\\) are thrown and,\non landing, display two numbers. Hence, there are thirty-six possible\noutcomes of throwing the dice. Let us now calculate the probability\nthat the outcome of throwing the two dice is 11. There are only two\noutcomes of throwing the two dice in which they show together 11:\neither (i) \\(D_{1}\\) shows 5 and \\(D_{2}\\) 6 or (ii) \\(D_{1}\\) shows 6\nand \\(D_{2}\\) 5. The probability of the outcome of \\(D_{1}\\)\u2019s\nand \\(D_{2}\\)\u2019s jointly showing 11 is the ratio between all\npossible outcomes of \\(D_{1}\\)\u2019s and \\(D_{2}\\)\u2019s jointly\nshowing 11 and the totality of possible outcomes of throwing the two\ndice: 2/36 = 1/18.\n\nIn the calculations we assumed (1):\n\n(1)\n There are bearers of probabilities: things that are probable or\nimprobable to a certain degree.\n\n\nWe also assumed that there is a space of possible states of the dice;\nways the two dice might fall. A way the dice might fall exists even if\nit is not true that the dice have fallen that way:\n\n(2)\n The possible states (outcomes) of \\(D_{1}\\)\u2019s and\n\\(D_{2}\\)\u2019s showing jointly certain numbers exist whether it is\ntrue that they show this number or false that they do.\n\n\nThe possible states are possible states of objects. \\(D_{1}\\)\u2019s\nand \\(D_{2}\\)\u2019s Showing 5 is a possible state of the\ndice, however we describe them or ascribe the property. This suggests\n(3):\n\n(3)\nPossible states are different if they are states of different\nobjects or constituted by different ways an object can be.\n\n\nThe possible states involved in our exercise have the properties\nphilosophers take states of affairs to have. States of affairs are\nprobable to a degree or possible, as stressed by Reinach (1911:\n339\u201340; K\u00fcnne 1987: 185ff and Forbes 1989: 131 follow\nReinach). They are supposed to exist without obtaining (2) and to have\nobjects and properties as constituents (3).\n\n(2) distinguishes states of affairs from facts. The fact that Socrates\nis wise exists, if, and only if, Socrates is wise. If Socrates is not\nwise, there is no fact of him being wise. Hence, the fact that\nSocrates is wise cannot be a mere possibility for Socrates; it can, so\nto speak, only be an actuality. In contrast, the state of affairs that\nSocrates is foolish exists, even if Socrates is not foolish (see\nReinach 1911; Wittgenstein 1918: 2.04, 2.05; Plantinga 1974: 44;\nPollock 1984a: 52).\n\n(3) distinguishes states of affairs from thoughts:\n\n\n[States of affairs] are \u201cabout\u201d objects but not in terms\nof some mode of representation. States of affairs, in some sense,\ncontain objects as direct constituents. (Pollock 1984a: 53)\n\n\nThe state of affairs Marilyn Monroe\u2019s being an actress\nand the state of affairs Norma Jean Baker\u2019s being an\nactress, contain, in some sense, the same objects and properties\nas constituents in the same order. They are the same state of affairs\nunder different names. However, I can believe that Marilyn Monroe is\nan actress while doubting that Norma Jean Baker is an actress. Hence,\nif there are states of affairs, they are not the content of\npropositional attitudes like belief; thoughts are. This point leaves\nopen the possibility that a state of affairs is a set of thoughts that\nare equivalent in some respect (see\n section 2.2).\n\nThe model of a space of possible outcomes of a throw of a die gives us\nan initial idea of what the distinctive properties of state of affairs\nare and why it is plausible to assume that there are any states of\naffairs. It leaves questions about the precise nature of states of\naffairs open. For example, Wittgenstein (1918: 4.26) argued that only\nelementary sentences \u201cpicture\u201d states of affairs. An\nelementary sentence in Wittgenstein\u2019s sense is a concatenation\nof simple proper names each of which refers to a simple object. The\nnames in the elementary proposition are arranged in a way that can be\nmapped onto an arrangement of the simple objects named. This\narrangement of objects is the state of affairs pictured by the\nelementary sentence. Nothing said so far rules out that states of\naffairs that involve some objects and properties (relations) combine\nto form further complex states of affairs that have states of affairs\nas constituents. (Pollock 1984a: 55\u20136) defines negation,\nconjunction etc. for states of affairs. For example, if there is a\nstate of affairs \\(S_1\\) and a state of affairs \\(S_2\\), their\nconjunction is the state of affairs that obtains if, and only if, both\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) obtain. If one wants to restrict the space of\npossible states to combinations of simple objects, one needs to\nmarshal arguments that show that this and similar conceptions of\ncomplex states of affairs is flawed. (This entry is mainly concerned\nwith simple states of affairs.)\n\nSimilarly, the model of states of affairs as possible outcomes does\nnot rule out that there are impossible state of affairs. If there is a\nspace of possible states of the dice, there seems to be a space of\nimpossible states of them as well. For example, it is\nimpossible for the dice to show 17 or no number at all (see Rumfitt\n2015: 187f for a brief discussion of impossible states of\naffairs).\n",
