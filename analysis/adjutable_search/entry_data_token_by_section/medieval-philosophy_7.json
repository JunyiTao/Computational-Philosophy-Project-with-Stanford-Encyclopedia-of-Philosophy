    "main_text": "Styles of Medieval Philosophy || The Twelfth-Century Parisian Schools\n2.5 The Twelfth-Century Parisian Schools\n\nParis became the centre of philosophy in Latin Europe in the twelfth\ncentury, in part because the cathedral authorities, rather than just\nrunning one school, allowed many, competing ones: masters flocked\nthere, and students began to head to Paris from all over\n Europe.[15]\n\nMany of these masters concentrated on the logical curriculum, little\nchanged since the late tenth century, but now its texts had been\nthoroughly absorbed. This curriculum gave them the opportunity, not\njust to make advances in what is still considered logic, but also to\ndevelop a whole metaphysics, starting not from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics\u2014which they did not know\u2014but his\nCategories. The boldest of all these metaphysicians was\n Peter Abelard\n (1079\u20131142). Aristotle\u2019s Categories seems to\nimply that, as well as particular substances (this man, that dog) and\nparticular forms (this rationality, that whiteness), there are also\nuniversal substances and forms. Abelard did not agree, and he tried to\nconstruct the world and interpret Aristotle without admitting that any\nuniversals exist. He also attended to the ontological status of what\nsentences say\u2014their dicta. Dicta play a\ncentral role in his understanding of truth and of the basis of logical\nconsequence, but, he insists, they are not things at all. Gilbert of\nPoitiers (c. 1085\u201390\u20131154) constructed an even more\ncomplex metaphysical system, based on the distinction between types of\ndiscourse (natural, \u201cmathematical\u201d, theological,\nethical).\n\nBoth men, and their often innovative followers (Abelard\u2019s were\nthe nominales, Gilbert\u2019s the Porretani) in the\nsecond half of the century, also wrote on theology. Indeed,\nGilbert\u2019s surviving works are all theological, the most\nimportant of them a commentary on Boethius\u2019s short theological\ntreatises. Gilbert tried, unsuccessfully, to establish the method\nBoethius used in his Short Theological Treatises\u2014of\ngoing as far as possible with parallels between natural phenomena and\nsacred mysteries, and pointing out where he has to stop\u2014as\nstandard. Abelard\u2019s own particular theological ideas\u2014which\nincluded an (arguably) rationalizing approach to the Trinity, and the\nview that, unlike humans, God cannot act otherwise than he\ndoes\u2014were generally rejected, and some of them condemned. But\nhis method of trying to reconcile apparently contradictory\nauthoritative texts through conceptual analysis was widely adopted by\nhis contemporaries and would form the basis for later medieval\ntheology.\n\nOther approaches to philosophy, less centred on logic and theology,\nwere also developed, especially outside Paris. William of Conches (d.\nafter 1155) concentrated on expounding texts such as Boethius\u2019s\nConsolation and Plato\u2019s Timaeus, and on\nphysical science, in which he regarded Plato as an authority.\n",
