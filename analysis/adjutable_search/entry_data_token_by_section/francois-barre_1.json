    "main_text": "Cartesian Foundations\n2. Cartesian Foundations\n\nPoulain\u2019s treatises De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des\ndeux sexes and De l\u2019\u00e9ducation des dames are\nboth profoundly influenced by Descartes\u2019 philosophy, but in\ndifferent ways. In the first treatise Descartes is not mentioned by\nname, but Poulain\u2019s discussion of the equality between the sexes\ndraws heavily on his philosophical method as well as his metaphysics.\nThe second treatise discusses Cartesian philosophy in detail and the\nleading character Stasimachus is a proclaimed follower of Descartes,\nbut the book itself is not as evidently relying on Descartes\u2019\nphilosophical method. My discussion of Poulain\u2019s Cartesian\ninfluences will draw on both treatises and I will first discuss the\nrole of Cartesian method and then discuss to what extent Poulain\nadopted a Cartesian metaphysics.\n",
