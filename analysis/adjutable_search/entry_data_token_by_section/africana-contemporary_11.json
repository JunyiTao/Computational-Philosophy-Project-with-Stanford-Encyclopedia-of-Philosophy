The tradition itself then becomes grist\nfor the mill of philosophical activity. Some of this activity goes to\nidentifying and shoring up (what some people think of as) the\nhistorical foundations of the field, while some goes to expanding the\nedifice that has been built atop those foundations.\n\nOne version of what I\u2019m referring to as fortification or shoring\nup is the outcome of a heightened focus on a few high-profile\nicons\u2014call this the \u201ctentpole approach.\u201d These are\nnotables like Cooper, Du Bois, and Fanon, the touchstone\nfigures\u2014Gordon refers to them as the pillars of African American\nphilosophy\u2014with the clearest prima facie cases for canonical\nstatus. As more philosophers examine the work of these figures and\nproduce more commentary on them and each other, subfields start to\ngrow up around them. This gives Africana philosophy that familiar\nsubdisciplinary shape, whereby anyone who knows anything about the\narea must have something to say about a handful of towering figures.\nOne clear and influential example of this sort of intervention is\nRobert Gooding-Williams\u2019s (2009) magisterial In the Shadow\nof Du Bois.\n\nThe tentpole approach is useful not just for fortification but also\nfor expansion. The expansionist version focuses on iconic figures that\nhave yet to receive the sort of attention from philosophers that\nthey\u2019ve received elsewhere. The aim here\u2014sometimes\nexplicitly undertaken as an exercise in Africana thought, sometimes\nsimply as an exercise in responsible scholarship\u2014is to give\nfigures like James Baldwin, Martin Luther King, Jr., Lorraine\nHansberry, and Audre Lorde the kind of attention that Gordon\u2019s\npillars have received. Tommie Shelby and Brandon M. Terry\u2019s\n(2018) volume on King and Imani Perry\u2019s (2018) study of\nHansberry exemplify this tendency.\n\nAn alternative to the tentpole approach, also with expansionist and\nfortificationist varieties, focuses less on iconic figures than on the\nbroader sweep of the tradition that has grown up around the icons. The\nfortificationist approach here involves recovering the figures and\nideas with which the icons were in conversation, thereby recovering\nnot just the work of individual thinkers but also their environing\nepistemic communities and discursive contexts. This is the spirit in\nwhich Brittney Cooper\u2019s (2017) Beyond Respectability\nrecovers the work of Fannie Barrier Williams with the National\nAssociation of Colored Women at the turn of the twentieth century. The\nexpansionist version of this approach studies neglected texts or\nfigures, either to mine them for philosophical insight or to fill in\notherwise piecemeal histories. In this spirit, John H. McClendon III\nand Stephen C. Ferguson II (2019) offer their remarkable new volume\nAfrican American Philosophers and Philosophy to press for the\nrecovery of card-carrying academic philosophers of African\ndescent.\n",
