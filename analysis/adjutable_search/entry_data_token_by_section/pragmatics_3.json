    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory\n3. Contemporary Pragmatic Theory\n\nMost current pragmatic theorists are neo-Griceans in that they adopt\nat least some version of his main three contributions: \n\na fundamental distinction of what a speaker says and what she\nimplicates;\na set of rules or principles, derived from general principles of\nrationality, cooperation and/or cognition, that guide, constrain or\ngovern human linguistic communication (there are differences among\nneo-Griceans on the exact nature of these principles and of pragmatic\nreasoning generally, as we shall see); and\na notion of communicative intention (called M(eaning)-intention by\nGrice) whose fulfillment consists in being recognized by the\naddressee.\n\n\nGiven these similarities, there are many differences. One important\ndimension involves disciplines and methodology. Following Carston\n(2005) there are at least three different general tendencies: those\nwho see pragmatics, much in Grice\u2019s vein, as a philosophical\nproject; those who concentrate on its interaction with grammar; and\nthose who see it as an empirical psychological theory of utterance\ninterpretation.\n\nA second dimension has to do with the relative importance given to two\nmodels of communication. One is the coding-decoding model of Locke and\nSaussure, as developed in the twentieth century logic and philosophy\nin compositional theories of meaning and truth. The other model, which\nwe owe mostly to Grice, also has Lockean roots, in that communication\nof belief from speaker to hearer lies at its center. But the mechanism\nof discovery is not decoding according to conventional rules, but\nintention-recognition and discovery based on ampliative inference. The\ntwo models are not inconsistent, and all theorists accept elements of\neach. The issue is their relative centrality and importance in the\nphenomenon of human communication with language.\n",
