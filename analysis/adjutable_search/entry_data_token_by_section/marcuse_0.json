    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nHerbert Marcuse was born on July 19, 1898 in Berlin. His mother was\nborn Gertrud Kreslawsky and his father was a well-off businessman,\nCarl Marcuse. According to Marcuse, his childhood was that of a\ntypical German upper-middle class youth whose Jewish family was well\nintegrated into German society (Kellner 1984: 13). Marcuse\u2019s\nformal education began at the Mommsen Gymnasium and continued at the\nKaiserin-Augusta Gymnasium in Charlottenburg from 1911\u20131916. In\n1916 Marcuse was called to military service. It was in the military\nwhere his political education began, although during this period his\npolitical involvement was brief. The experience of war and the German\nRevolution led Marcuse to a study of Marxism as he tried to understand\n\u201cthe dynamics of capitalism and imperialism, as well as the\nfailure of the German Revolution\u201d (Kellner 1984: 17). Marcuse\nalso wanted to learn more about socialism and the Marxian theory of\nrevolution so that he may understand his own inability to identify\nwith any of the major Left parties at that time (Kellner 1984: 17).\nHowever, this study of Marxism would be brief. In 1918 Marcuse was\nreleased from military service.\n\nIn 1919 he entered Humboldt University in Berlin and took courses for\nfour semesters. In 1920 he transferred to Freiburg to concentrate on\nGerman literature and to take courses in philosophy, politics, and\neconomics. This period of study culminated in a doctoral dissertation\nentitled Der deutsche K\u00fcnstlerroman (The German\nArtist-Novel), which was accepted in 1922 (Kellner 1984: 18). This\nwork would be the first in a life-long engagement with aesthetics for\nMarcuse. \n After the acceptance of his dissertation Marcuse returned to\nBerlin where \u201chis father provided him with an apartment and a\nshare in a publishing and antiquarian book business\u201d\n(Wiggershaus 1994: 96). Marcuse worked mainly as a catalogue researcher\nand bibliographer, and published a Schiller bibliography in 1925\n(Kellner 1984: 32\u201333). In 1924 Marcuse married his first wife,\nSophie.\n\nWhile in Berlin, Marcuse began reading Martin Heidegger\u2019s newly\npublished Being and Time with a friend in 1927. Although\nMarcuse was already a student of philosophy, his interest in\nphilosophy had remained second to his interest in German literature up\nto this point. The excitement caused by Being and Time would\nlead Marcuse to a life-long serious engagement with philosophy.\nAccording to Douglas Kellner, this move from a primary concern with\nart to a deeper engagement with philosophy suggests that Marcuse was a\nbit skeptical about the power of art as a \u201ccognitive source of\nknowledge and as an instrument of personal liberation and social\nchange\u201d (Kellner 1984: 36\u201337). The impact of Heidegger was\nso great that Marcuse returned to Freiburg in 1928 to study philosophy\nwith Heidegger and Edmund Husserl. While in Freiburg Marcuse worked as\nHeidegger\u2019s assistant and began work on his second dissertation,\nHegel\u2019s Ontologie und die Grundlegung einer Theorie der\nGeschichtlichkeit (Hegel\u2019s Ontology and the Theory of\nHistoricity) (1932 [1987]). Although this dissertation was never\napproved by Heidegger (and according to Marcuse, perhaps not read), it\nwas published in 1932.\n In 1932 Marcuse and Heidegger parted ways due to the\nlatter\u2019s developing interest in National Socialism, although\nHeidegger didn\u2019t officially join the Nazi Party until 1933. As\nthe Nazis soared to power and anti-Semitism began to spread, it became\nclear to Marcuse that he \u201cwould never be able to qualify for a\nprofessorship under the Nazi regime\u201d (Kellner 1984: 92). Given\nhis situation, Marcuse began to inquire about employment with the\nInstitute for Social Research in Frankfurt. After an interview, a\nletter of support from Edmund Husserl, and a word of support from a\nmember of the Institute (Leo Lowenthal), Marcuse was hired\n(Wiggershaus 1994: 104; Kellner 1984: 92)\n Due to Nazi activity, Marcuse never actually worked in\nFrankfurt. Anticipating the fascist takeover, the Institute deposited\ntheir endowment in Holland. A branch office was established in Geneva\nwhere Marcuse began his work with the Institute. He would go to Paris\nfor a short time and then finally in July 1934 to New York. From\n1934\u20131942 Marcuse worked at the Institute\u2019s branch at\nColumbia University. In 1942 he moved to Washington D.C. to work first\nwith the Office of War Information and then with the Office of\nStrategic Services. Later Marcuse would teach at Brandeis University\nand then the University of California, San Diego. He became a United\nStates citizen in 1940 and remained in the United States until his\ndeath in 1979.\n",
