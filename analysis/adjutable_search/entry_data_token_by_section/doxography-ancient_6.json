    "main_text": "Reconstructing an old document\n7. Reconstructing an old document\n\nA text of A\u00ebtius in a single column has now been published (Mansfeld\nand Runia 2020), superseding Diels\u2019 text in two columns. The\nevidence of the primary and secondary sources for the reconstruction\nof each individual chapter is cited in full, though for Plutarch and\nStobaeus only in the positive apparatus criticus. A detailed\ncommentary follows. For each chapter its reconstruction from the\nwitnesses is explained, its position in the context of the\nPlacita and sometimes of the wider tradition determined, its\ncontents and structure analyzed, such parallel evidence as is\navailable, both earlier and later to much later, analyzed, and\nproblems of interpretation raised by the text and contents of\nindividual tenets are often separately discussed. Each chapter ends\nwith a generous collection of further related texts to widen the\nhorizon and place the topic of the chapter in the context of the\nhistory of ancient philosophy from beginning to end. These\ncommentaries and collections of texts situate the Placita at\na key point in the development over the centuries of Greek philosophy,\nlooking backwards as well as forward. The existing remains amount to\nabout six-sevenths of the original (see Jeremiah 2018).\n",
