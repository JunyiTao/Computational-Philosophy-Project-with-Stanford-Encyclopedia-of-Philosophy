    "main_text": "Theories of Color || Primitivism: The Simple Objectivist View of Colors\n2.1 Primitivism: The Simple Objectivist View of Colors\n\nOne of the most prominent views of color is that color is an\nobjective, i.e., mind-independent, intrinsic property, one possessed\nby many material objects (of different kinds) and light sources. (By\n\u201cobjective\u201d here, I mean \u201contologically\nobjective\u201d, i.e., mind-independent\u2014see Searle 2015: 16.)\nThis view, call it Color Objectivism, takes different forms,\nhowever. One form it takes is that colors are simple qualities, which\nshow their natures on their face: they are sui generis,\nsimple, qualitative, sensuous, intrinsic, irreducible properties.This\nview has come to be called \u201cColor Primitivism\u201d. Another\ncommon form is that colors are objective (mind-independent),\nproperties of material bodies and light sources, whose natures are\n\u201chidden\u201d from us, and require empirical investigation to\ndiscover. I shall use the term \u201cReductive Color\nPhysicalism\u201d to refer to it.\n\nColor Primitivism comes in two forms: a realist vision and an\neliminativist version. Color Primitivist Realism is the view that\nthere are in nature colors, as ordinarily understood, i.e., colors are\nsimple intrinsic, non-relational, non-reducible, qualitative\nproperties. They are qualitative features of the sort that stand in\nthe characteristic relations of similarity and difference that mark\nthe colors; they are not micro-structural properties or reflectances,\nor anything of the sort. There is no radical illusion, error or\nmistake in color perception (only commonplace illusions): we perceive\nobjects to have the colors that they really have. Such a view has been\npresented by Hacker 1987 and by J. Campbell 1994, 2005, and has become\nincreasingly popular: McGinn 1996; Watkins 2005; Gert 2006, 2008. This\nview is sometimes called \u201cThe Simple View of Color\u201d and\nsometimes \u201cThe Naive Realist view of Color\u201d. Primitivist\nColor realism contains a conceptual (and semantic) thesis about our\nordinary understanding of color, and a metaphysical thesis, namely,\nthat physical bodies actually have colors of this sort. It is possible\nto accept the conceptual thesis but deny the metaphysical thesis. This\ngives us an eliminativist form of Color Primitivism.\n\nOne major criticism with Primitivism concerns whether the arguments\nfor it depends on a questionable form of the doctrine of Revelation.\n(See Byrne & Hilbert 2007a, for an expression of this criticism, among a set of other\ncriticisms.) In response, many authors argue that the form of\nRevelation set out by Johnston is too strong, and there is a more\nmoderate form of the doctrine that is more plausible (see J. Campbell\n2005; Gert 2008; Allen 2011). It is worth noting that while Johnston\nand others cite Bertrand Russell and Galen Strawson as advocates of\nthe doctrine, these two authors actually say very different things, in\nthe quotes given to illustrate the doctrine. Russell, for example,\nplaces stress on the perceiver being acquainted with instances of\ncolor. The suggestion implicit in modest versions of the doctrine\nis that the appeal to Revelation needs little more than that.\n\nOne of the major problem, historically, concerns whether it is\npossible to reconcile the putative character of the intrinsic color\nfeatures with such features having a causal role in our experiences of\ncolors. The properties that do the causing of these experiences seem\nto be complex, micro-structural properties of surfaces of bodies (and\nsimilar properties for seeing volume colors, diffraction colors,\nscattering colors, etc). This problem is addressed by Hacker in his\ndefense of the claim that colors are intrinsic features of physical\nbodies. He insists that colors are properties that are used to provide\ncausal explanations. There is no more reason to deny this, he says,\nthan there is to deny the parallel claim for solidity and liquidity.\nThe explanation is not vitiated by the discovery that microstructural\nprocesses are involved, any more than explanations concerning solidity\nand liquidity are rendered otiose by the discovery of the\nmicrostructural base for these properties. A possible criticism of\nthis analogy would be that, in the case of solidity and liquidity, it\nis plausible to analyze these properties functionally: to be solid is\nto have some structure that is the causal basis for such and such ways\nof behaving. This is not the sort of analysis that the Primitivist\nrequires (see also Campbell 1994).\n\nThe Primitivist Realist needs to have some view about how colors are\nrelated to the physical properties of material objects, e.g., spectral\nreflectances, that are necessary in order for us to have experiences\nof color. That is to say, it is vital that they have some theory on\nthe matter. The standard view has come to be that colors are\nsupervenient on these physical properties. On some accounts, the\nsupervenience relations are nomological ones; on other accounts, they\nare metaphysical (rather than logical)\u2014see Hacker 1987, Campbell\n1994, Yablo 1995, McGinn 1996, Watkins 2005. Appeals to supervenience are fine as far as\nthey go but, as often been pointed out, they mark the start of an\nexplanation, rather than the end (see entry on\n supervenience).\n We need to specify which kind of supervenience is involved:\nnomological, logical or metaphysical (where and if the latter can be\ndistinguished from the logical form). Secondly, we need to give some\naccount of what it is that grounds the supervenience relation. Byrne\nand Hilbert, in a complex paper specifically on Primitivism (2007a), argue that appeals to both\nnomological and metaphysical supervenience face formidable\nobjections.\n\nAnother major problem for the realist version of Color Primitivism is\none that Hardin (2004, 2008) and Cohen (2009) have especially\nstressed. They draw attention to a vast range of facts concerning the\nvariety of conditions under which objects appear to have the colors\nthey do, and the variety of classes of observers for whom the colors\nappear. Since the only way to determine what primitivist color a body\nhas is by the way it appears, this raises the question of which is the\nbody\u2019s real color. Normal perceivers, for example, divide into\ndifferent groups on whether a body\u2019s color is, say, unique blue,\nor rather, a slightly reddish-blue, an even more reddish blue, or,\nalternatively, a greenish blue. Cohen and Hardin argue that there is\nno non-arbitrary way to pick out one group of perceivers as\nidentifying the \u201creal\u201d color. At most, one group is\ncorrect, but we would not know which; for all we know, none of the\ngroups is identifying the real color. Averill (1992) presents a pair\nof arguments that also depend on difficulties that stem from trying to\ngive a non-arbitrary account of normal observers and standard viewing\nconditions. We can easily suppose changes in either our eyes (and\nhence in normal observers) or in standard viewing conditions, such\nthat some objects that previously were yellow would look red, and\nothers would still look yellow\u2014while remaining otherwise\nphysically unchanged. If primitive colors are supposed to be\nsupervenient on physical microstructures, then it is difficult to see\nhow we could accommodate this sort of change. A possible, but radical,\nresponse to this problem is to modify the Realist position and to hold\nthat objects can have more than one color (indeed have many colors).\nSee Kalderon 2007 and Mizrahi 2006 for a defense of this view.\n",
