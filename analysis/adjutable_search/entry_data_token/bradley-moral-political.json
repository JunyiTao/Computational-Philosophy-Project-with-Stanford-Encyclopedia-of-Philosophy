H. Green and\nF. H. Bradley, reflect the influence of Kant and Hegel on English\nmoral philosophy in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century.  To the\nextent that either draws on other sources it is to Aristotle that they\nturn rather than to British moral philosophers such as Butler, Hume or\nReid; a point which is evident both from the fact that Green and\nBradley offer a type of perfectionist account of morality that is\narticulated in terms of the concept of self-realization and from the\nappearance of Aristotle\u2019s man of practical wisdom (the\nphronimos) in the fifth essay of Bradley\u2019s Ethical\nStudies.  In addition, much of their attention was taken up with\ncritical analyses of utilitarianism - the dominant ethical theory of\nthe day - and the hedonism to which it was wedded, whether that view\nadvanced the primacy of pleasure either in the form of a psychological\naccount of motivation or as the felt state that right actions aim at\nmaximizing.  Indeed, Bradley not only had to dispense with the claims\nof the older utilitarians, such as Bentham and Mill, but also had to\nface the new defense of utilitarianism advanced by Henry Sidgwick, who\npublished his The Methods of Ethics (1874) virtually\nsimultaneously with Bradley\u2019s Ethical Studies (1876).  For a\ngreater part of the Twentieth century Bradley\u2019s critical attacks on\nhedonism and utilitarianism were considered to be about the best part\nof his book.  During this same period it was also usual to read Essay\nV (\u201cMy Station and Its Duties\u201d) as expressing Bradley\u2019s own position,\nand this was interpreted as derivative, relying heavily on Hegel\u2019s\nview of society as an organism of interrelated persons.  It is later\nrealized, largely because of Peter Nicholson\u2019s studies of the moral\nand political philosophy of the British Idealists, that taking the\nperspective of \u201cMy Station\u201d as final misses the relevance of the next\nessay, entitled \u201cIdeal Morality,\u201d in the dialectical progress of\nBradley\u2019s essays.\nWhile this reminder about the importance of the later essays guards\nagainst a serious misreading of the arguments of Ethical\nStudies, it invites a different error by suggesting that Bradley\nis attempting to identify the supreme moral principle that should\nguide human choices and actions. Now, for Sidgwick that is the\nwhole point of moral philosophy and he criticizes Green\u2019s claim that\nthe end of action is self-realization on the grounds that this notion\nis simply too general and vague to be practically useful in informing\nus about what we should do in any given circumstance; and because of\nthis indeterminacy Sidgwick rejects it as a possible expression of the\nsupreme moral end.  (Of course, a plurality of irreducible ultimate\nprinciples also leaves us with no clear direction and his finding two\nsuch principles is what leads to the failure of Sidgwick\u2019s own\ntheory.)  By contrast, it is crucial to recognize that Bradley is not\nengaged in, or much interested in, this sort of enterprise. Rather, he\nwants to understand the moral perspective and the nature of moral\nagents and also to uncover the logical structure of deliberation and\nchoice.\nEthical Studies was Bradley\u2019s only book on moral\nphilosophy, published when he was very young, in 1876. Organized\naround the concept of self-realization, it presents a metaphysical\nethics in the sense that it is largely concerned with coming to\nunderstand the moral agent, which entails laying bare the structure of\nvolitional choice. In this respect, Bradley offers a theory of\npractical reasoning.  The overarching end of practical reasoning is\nself-realization and so it is no surprise that Bradley thinks the main\nobjective of moral action is to become as morally good as we can,\nmaking the world morally better in the process.  This perfectionist\ntheory is developed and defended not in terms of the moral virtues and\ntheir contribution to the good life, but on the ground that the\nrealization of the self is a necessary feature of the logical\nstructure of intentionally willed moral actions.\n The basic data for analysis of moral action come from observing\nthe practical judgments ordinary people make and their understanding\nand use of normative concepts. The role of the philosopher is to\nexplain this moral world rather than to generate principles dictating\nhow people should act. In this respect, Bradley offers a descriptive\nrather than a prescriptive ethical theory. Yet, he holds it equally\nimportant to learn how a child develops from a creature with appetites\nand needs into a mature, reflective moral agent capable of complex\ndeliberations and choices. Answering this question requires a\npsychological theory of moral development which explains why\nindividuals pursue the specific goals they do. In this respect\nEthical Studies has something of the flavor of a naturalized\nethics. Bradley claims that proving that the ultimate end of action is\nself-realization would require establishing the nature of the self, of\nreality and the process of realization, which would amount to having a\ndeveloped system of metaphysics, and that, lacking this, the best he\ncan do is to explain the thesis and try to make it plausible\n(Ethical Studies, p. 65). The reader should not be fooled by\nthis. Metaphysics was always Bradley\u2019s primary philosophical interest\nand his moral theory is shaped by his metaphysical views, some of\nwhich are already discernable in Ethical Studies. The lament\nthat he does not have a fully developed view, which is common in his\nwritings, merely reflects his feeling that there is always more to be\nsaid - at least until a fully developed metaphysical treatise reveals\nReality to us.\n", "toc": [{"#StrVolCho": "1.

The Structure of Volitional Choice\n\n\nBradley begins his study of morality and the moral agent with an\nanalysis of the ordinary person\u2019s understanding of moral\nresponsibility. The reason for this starting-place is revealed much\nlater, when he argues that children are not moral creatures until they\nhave developed a measure of self-consciousness. This, he says,\nmakes possible \u201cimputation and responsibility, and here begins\nthe proper moral life of the self\u201d (Ethical Studies, p.\n299). If an action has any moral significance whatsoever then the\nperson responsible (in the causal sense) can be held accountable\n(responsible in the normative sense). One could feel accountable\nto other people, to God or to one\u2019s own conscience, and with this\ngoes a sense of liability to censure or punishment. Actually being\nguilty and thereby deserving of censure or punishment requires the\nsatisfaction of three conditions: the person held accountable must be\nthe same person as the one who did the act, the act must have been that\nperson\u2019s, and he or she must have had some understanding of the\nmoral quality of the act. While not in a position to provide a\nphilosophical opinion on questions concerning personal identity or what\nconstitutes an action, the ordinary person nevertheless recognizes\ncases in which an accused person was \u201cnot himself\u201d or\n\u201cdid not mean to do it\u201d or acted under duress, and sees\nthese as mitigating circumstances. In sum, the ordinary person\u2019s\nview, as Bradley presents it, is Aristotelian: for the purposes\nof determining moral responsibility an act has to be the agent\u2019s\nin that its origin (arche) lies with or in the agent in some\nsense\u2014and the agent must not be acting under coercion or in a state\nof non-culpable ignorance. These last conditions reflect the\ncommon view that one cannot, in justice, hold someone accountable\nunless she had a measure of control over the situation and thereby\ncould be viewed as acting of her own free will.\n\n\nIf we turn to the theories of philosophers we find differing\nopinions about whether we enjoy this sort of freedom from external\ninfluences, and Bradley is interested in how the theories of\nDeterminism and Indeterminism differ from the views of the ordinary\npeople; not because he thinks the ordinary people will always be\ncorrect about such matters\u2014indeed, they likely have not thought much\nabout such things\u2014but because examining what the ordinary people say\nabout moral matters reveals the deep structures of a society\u2019s\nmoral thinking as that is embedded in its language and social\ninstitutions. This is also important, as we will see\nlater, because Bradley believes morality is relative to a communal\nsetting, and sees a child\u2019s moral development as dependent on\nmembership in a community.\n\n\nIn the matter of the free will debate the ordinary people believe\nneither side. Against Determinism they hold that they can and\noften do initiate actions\u2014and on this point Bradley portrays the\nordinary person as accepting the thesis now called \u201cagent\ncausality.\u201d What is omitted by the Determinists are\nexplanations of behavior which appeal to the reasons of the agent,\nthereby ignoring Aristotle\u2019s notion of final causality, or\npurposely reducing it to efficient causality. The Indeterminist\npresents herself as the friend of freedom but when she claims that\npeople are so free that they could choose any act at any time the\nordinary people object. They think it often possible to predict\nwhat someone will do, because she has a formed moral character and can\nbe counted on to act a certain way when faced with moral\nquestions. Moreover, the ordinary person thinks character is\ndeveloped by the choices people make and the kind of life they have\nled. Bradley notes, however, that character is malleable to\na degree and it is often difficult to determine the extent to which\nsomeone\u2019s character is more or less fixed and resistant to\nchange. Those matters aside, the key result of the\ndiscussion of moral responsibility is the portrayal of moral agents as\nnot only acting in the world in ways that shape that world\u2014especially\nthe social world\u2014but also in ways that shape the agent\u2019s moral\ncharacter. From the perspective of morality both the act\nand the doing of it are equally important.\n\nBut Bradley does not stop at character formation, claiming that human\nnature itself is evolving. He rejects the traditional view that\none\u2019s essential human nature remains unchanged even though there\nwill be some differences in people that are only historical\naccidents. The contrary position is a metaphysical doctrine,\noften called historicity, which claims that human beings are\nself-making within the limits of their natural and social\ncontexts. There is a dialectical relationship between these\naspects of the human condition: we are not only constrained by\nnatural and social contexts but can often alter natural conditions and\nsocial arrangements, thereby influencing how they impact on our\nchoices. For example, my ability to think certain things possible\nwill be a function of my conception of the social institutions of my\nsociety. If marriages are defined as being between a male and a\nfemale, I may not even contemplate the possibility of being in a\nsame-sex marriage leave alone feel free to act on the idea. Yet,\nchange is possible because human beings have the ability to represent\nstates of affairs that do not exist. In its most familiar form\nthis happens when you plan tomorrow\u2019s dinner.\n\n\nThe task, now, is to elaborate the logical structure of this\nself-making process, for Bradley\u2019s moral thesis is not merely\nthat the aim of moral action is to generate a better, superior self,\nand ultimately a perfect self, but that this is to be achieved by the\nagent herself, for it is a process of\n\u2018self-realization.\u2019 Eventually this theory must\nsupply an account of how anything we might recognize as moral content\ngets included in the picture, but the first task is to articulate the\nformal structure of \u201cvolitional choice\u201d (Ethical\nStudies, p.71). Bradley begins this task by noting the\ndifferent aims we have in pursuing theoretical knowledge versus our\naims in practical reasoning:\n\n\nWhat we want in theory is to understand the object; we want neither\nto remove nor alter the world of sensuous fact, but we want to get at\nthe truth of it. The whole of science takes it for granted that\nthe \u2018not-ourself\u2019 is really intelligible; it stands and\nfalls with this assumption. So long as our theory strikes on the\nmind as strange and alien, so long do we say we have not found truth;\nwe feel the impulse to go beyond, we alter and alter our views, till we\nsee them as a consistent whole. There we rest, because then we\nhave found the nature of our own mind and the truth of the facts in\none. And in practice again, with a difference, we have the same\nwant. Here our aim is not, leaving the given as it is, to find\nthe truth of it; but here we want to force the sensuous fact to\ncorrespond to the truth of ourselves. (Ethical Studies,\np.73)\n\n\nThis presents two very different kinds of intentional mental\nstates. In the case of empirical knowledge we have a subject in\nthe psychological state of believing that something is true of the\nworld; his belief has a propositional object as its content as\nBradley would call it. Since the goal is to correctly understand the\nworld, the subject is committed to altering his belief set until it\naccurately represents the external physical world. By contrast,\nwhen I wish or desire to become a better person I must first have\nrepresented the self or person I wish to be under some\ndescription. This sort of mental state also has a\npropositional object; e.g., in the statement, \u201cI wish that I\nwere a more patient person\u201d the italicized proposition\nfollowing the \u201cthat\u201d is the object of the mental state we\ncall wishing. What we have here, in Bradley\u2019s\nterminology is an ideal object which is the content\nof the wish. This is ideal because it is a mental representation\nof a state of affairs that does not exist at the point the wish is\nmade.\n\n\nAn ideal object can represent a possible different state of\nthe person contemplating it, which presupposes, in addition to the\nability to represent possible future states, a degree of\nself-awareness. An example of this sort of self-consciousness is\nfound in the addict who may be very aware of how his desires are\nruining his life. Once this sort of self-reflective awareness is\nachieved it is then possible to think of changing things. In\nBradley\u2019s language this addict has pictured a better self that he\nmight be, and if he comes to identify his satisfaction with realizing\nthis better self there is a possibility of change. This situation\nsets up a conflict between the actual person the addict now is and the\nrepresented better person he wishes to be and this generates disharmony\nor what Bradley often calls a \u201cfelt contradiction\u201d.\nThe pain of this conflict moves the individual toward resolving\nit. It is important to note that the addict cannot move forward\nwithout having a determinate ideal object, a definite conception of the\nideal self being represented. Without this, identifying his\nsatisfaction with realizing that state would be impossible.\n\n\nThis gives us a way to see what Bradley means when he says, in a\nlater article, that \u201cvolition is \u2018the self-realization of\nan idea with which the self is identified\u2019\u201d (Collected\nEssays, p. 476). In Ethical Studies the\nclaim made is that the only thing we can aim at in acting is to realize\nourselves\u2014or, better, the structure of practical reasoning and the\nfacts of moral psychology make it impossible that we could aim at\nanything other than self-realization. If volitional choice has a\npossible state of oneself as its object, and if one has identified\none\u2019s satisfaction with achieving this, then acting so as to\nrealize the superior self that has been pictured is an advancing of\noneself or realizing oneself. In fact, this would also be true of\na case in which the intentional object represents a state of affairs\nnot directly involving a change in oneself, for having identified\none\u2019s satisfaction with a possible state of affairs would mean\nthat its coming to be would be also a case of advancing oneself, for in\nthis case the agent has forced the world to conform to us. What\nis crucial is that the represented state be taken as the agent\u2019s\nend. As Bradley notes, \u201call my thoughts are not my\nends\u201d and if self-realization meant no more than having an idea\nof a future event in our mind which later happens, \u201cthen I should\nrealize myself practically when I see that the engine is going to run\noff the line, and it does so\u201d (Ethical Studies, p.\n67).\n2. The Perfect, Ideal Self\n\n\nVolitional choice therefore has a built-in normative feature in the\nform of an idea of a better state or self. But self-realization\nmeans more than this for ethical theory, for it purportedly represents\nthe over-arching, ultimate goal of moral action, which entails some\nidea of a perfect, ideal self that is being aimed at. This raises\nan epistemic problem. With individual cases, such as the addict\ncontemplating his situation, it may be that he gets an idea of how he\nmight change by observing other people or considering how he used to be\nbefore becoming an addict. But how can anyone know what the ideal\nself is, the superior self that is not merely better, but best?\nAnswering this is crucial if Bradley\u2019s ethical theory is not to\nfall victim to a criticism he made of Mill\u2019s thesis about the\nqualities of pleasures (Utilitarianism, Chapter 2).\nBradley leveled a barrage of criticisms against any theory, Utilitarian\nor otherwise, that proposed the maximization of pleasure as the\nultimate moral goal. The central objection was that since\npleasures are a \u201cperishing series,\u201d with each one passing\naway once it has been experienced, it is not possible to accumulate a\nsum of pleasures, and since there are always more pleasures available\nthan anyone has experienced, Mill\u2019s moral goal of maximizing\npleasant states was meaningless. But introducing the idea of\nqualitatively different kinds of pleasures that can be ranked suggests\nthat perhaps the hedonist can, after all, successfully articulate the\nself we should be aiming at. Perhaps the best self\u2014the ideal\nmoral self\u2014is the one that pursues the highest type of pleasure.\n\n\n In evaluating this Bradley stresses the relative,\ncomparative nature of terms such as \u2018higher\u2019 and\n\u2018lower\u2019. Contrast terms such as\n\u2018superior\u2019 and \u2018inferior\u2019 invite us to ask,\n\u201cin respect of what is A higher than, or superior to,\nB?\u201d Bradley insists that if I say Sally is superior\nto Joan I must first be comparing them in terms of some characteristic\nthey share\u2014for example, both are beautiful\u2014and, second, I am\npositioning them on a scale, which is conceived in terms of two\ndeterminate termini. We can perhaps see the point here by\nimagining what happens when, having said Sally is superior to Joan, we\nare next asked to rank Mary. If Mary is judged superior (in\nbeauty) to both, then she is being placed between Sally and someone who\nis right at the top of the scale. Mill\u2019s account of\nsuperior pleasures fails because he never explains what the scale is\nthat is being used and so never explains what the \u2018highest\u2019\nkind of pleasure is. Whether this criticism survives\nscrutiny does not matter all that much as far as the fate of hedonism\nis concerned, for Bradley\u2019s attack on qualitative hedonism is\nnothing short of thorough and he thinks there is no convincing case\nMill can make in support of it. For example, Mill\u2019s\ncompetent judges cannot say that this ranking just \u201cfeels\u201d\nright, for that is to confess that the talk of ranking is meaningless\nsince one could have just as well \u201cranked\u201d them\ndifferently. And the ranking cannot be made in terms of\nMary\u2019s beauty, because that is the quality that makes Mary a\ncandidate for placement on the scale in the first place; which leads\nBradley to hold, as did most of Mill\u2019s critics, that unless the\nwhole business really is nonsense, there must some criterion other than\npleasure being used and so Mill has given up hedonism. These, and\nsome other arguments are independent of the issue about knowing the\nupper limit end of the scale of pleasures That issue is\nimportant, however, because it marks a problem Bradley\u2019s theory\nof self-realization should also have to face: namely, that talk\nof a \u2018superior\u2019 or \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018more\nperfect\u2019 moral person would require an explication of the upper\nlimit of the scale these evaluations are employing. This seems a\nreasonable demand, for even apart from the question of whether judging\nsomething to be better than something else entails knowing what is\nbest, Bradley\u2019s thesis is not just that we try to become better\nwith each choice and action, but that we want to be the best possible,\nto be perfect moral agents.\n\n\nFortunately, Bradley has an answer. In the passage from\nEthical Studies quoted above Bradley said that in our\ntheoretical attempts at understanding the world we want to make our set\nof empirical beliefs coherent, and since we assume as a working\nhypothesis that the external world is systematic, a contradiction in\nour beliefs would indicate we have not yet arrived at the coherence and\nconsistency that is demanded. In addition, our empirical belief\nset has to include all the facts, has to be comprehensive.\nBradley claims a similar objective applies to intentional agents.\nWe look to produce a self that is an organic whole in which all is\nrelated so as to render it a system rather than a mere collection of\nrandom acts and characteristics. Yet it must also seek to be all\nit can become rather than living \u201cthe life of an\noyster.\u201d These two aspects he calls\n\u2018homogeneity\u2019 and \u2018specificity\u2019 respectively\n(Ethical Studies, p.74), and they appear to parallel\n\u201ccoherent\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d as applied to a\nset of beliefs.\n\n\nTo show that we aim at being a whole, Bradley first offers some\nempirical evidence.\n\n\nTo the extent that people consider the consequences of their actions\nthey demonstrate that they do not see their actions as disconnected\nfrom other things they have done and might do, and they subordinate\nsome ends to wider goals. That is, ordinary people not only\ndisplay a degree of prudence in making choices but also recognize that\nthe value of some actions is that they are means to more important\ngoals. In fact, he claims that most people act with some \u201cideal\nof life,\u201d or some idea of what would make them perfectly happy,\nhowever vaguely expressed, and this orders their lives, governing their\nchoices and actions. In a word, normal lives of mature adults are\nat least relatively systematic. Moreover, if a person has become\nhabituated to act in certain ways, has developed a disposition to act\nthus and so, then her actions will tend to be relatively\nconsistent. This sort of person has what Bradley calls a\n\u201cstanding will\u201d and it explains why those who know someone\nwell can predict what this person will do with a considerable\ndegree of certainty and why that person feels pleased that others know\nshe can be counted on to act appropriately. There is, in other words, a\nstructure to her actions suggesting her inner life\u2014her desires,\ndispositions, values and so on\u2014is unified. She is like an\norganism in that all these features work together as one unit, (= a\n\u201cwhole\u201d).\n\n\n Moving beyond empirical evidence,\nBradley claims that in volitional action \u201cthe self as a whole is,\nin the end, the content of our wills\u201d (Ethical Studies,\np. 71). In other words, in self-realization the ideal object with\nwhich the self will identify its ultimate satisfaction is a whole.\nThere are two articulations of this notion of a \u201cwhole\nself.\u201d First, Bradley notes that we find it natural to\nspeak of someone willing this or that, and we often speak of\nsomeone\u2019s will, as in \u201cher will to live.\u201d\nThis reveals two aspects of the will, of the individual person\ndeliberating and choosing a course of action. First, when Sally\nwills something there is a particular process that occurs in which\nSally deliberates, experiences certain desires or leanings toward one\nthing or another, eventually terminating in her doing such and\nsuch. Bradley calls this the particular aspect of the\nwill to indicate that volitional choice is geared toward specific\nactions in the world. Even if Sally cannot carry out her plans,\nsay because she is paralyzed, her willing still targets doing something\nspecific. On the other hand, when we say Sally has a will we are\nconceiving of her as persisting beyond any single specific choice, and\nseeing her as the owner and author of what she wills. Bradley\ncalls this the universal aspect of the will. The\n\u201cvolition as a whole \u00c9 is the unity of both these factors,\nand the projection or carrying of it out into external existence; the\nrealization both of the particular side, the this or that to be done,\nand the realization of the inner side of the self in the doing of\nit\u201d (Ethical Studies, p.72). The moral\nthesis of self-realization reflects the importance of both, for\ncreating our moral character through our choices and actions entails\nboth particular acts of will and a subsisting will that is\ndeveloped through these choices.\n\nIn his later articles on the will a volition is defined as \u201cthe\nself-realization of an idea with which the self is\nidentified.\u201d Again, this pictures a self that can identify\nwith an ideal object and can through action realize (bring\nabout) the state of affairs represented by the ideal object. When\nthis occurs the self is also realized because of its identification\nwith this object. The full analysis reveals five necessary\ncomponents:\n\n\nThere is (1) existence, (2) the idea of a change, and (3) the actual\nchange of the existence by the idea to (4) the idea\u2019s content.\nAnd (5) in this change the self feels itself realized. (Collected\nEssays, p. 477)\n\n\nThe self that entertains the ideal object (the intentional object)\nand identifies its satisfaction with that object and that feels\nsatisfaction when that object has become real in the world, must all be\nthe same self. This is the main point of saying that the will has\na universal aspect.\n\n\nThe thesis that we aim at being a whole is further illuminated by\nconsidering volitional choice from the inner perspective of the\nindividual moral agent. This agent is aware of being the same\nperson throughout specific acts of choosing\u2014an awareness of being the\n\u201cI\u201d that wills to do this or that. But at the same\ntime there is\u2014or should be\u2014some uncertainty about who or what this\n\u201cI\u201d is, for there is a dualism built right into the logical\nstructure of volitional choice in that it requires awareness of both\nthe existing state of the self and a superior state represented as a\npossible future state. Since both are felt to represent this\nperson a tension arises along with a desire to resolve the tension; so\nthere is, right at the heart the matter a kind of movement toward\nrestoring the unity of the self by overcoming the dualism that\nnecessarily exists in any volition. Later this sort of conflict\ngets introduced in Bradley\u2019s moral theory in terms of the\ndevelopment of, and the conflict between, the good self and the bad\nself.\n\nBradley next says that what we really desire is not merely to be a\nwhole, but an infinite whole. This introduces a\nparticular, and perhaps to some minds a peculiar, metaphysical\ndoctrine: that if A is dependent on B then A is not real in and\nof itself\u2014because it is defined by, or can only function\nthrough, its relationship to B. The real is independent; it is\nwhat it is in terms of its own features and functions. . (On this\nview \u2018real\u2019 is a normative term.) Something\nwhich has no external relations that impinge on what it is and can do\nis infinite. By contrast, a finite entity has something that\nlimits it. This relates to the analysis of the self of\nmoral action because, given this conception of what it means to be\n\u2018real\u2019\u2014as requiring total independence from anything else\nand thereby being free of all relations\u2014it would be analytic that the\ngoal of self-realization can be attained only if one could become an\ninfinite whole in Bradley\u2019s this technical sense of\n\u2018infinite\u2019. Of course, it is unlikely that the\neveryday moral agent has thought of her situation in these\nterms. But that is not necessary because each has a\nfelt impulse which points her in the right direction.\nExplaining this introduces yet another metaphysical doctrine,\nBradley\u2019s theory of immediate experience.\n\n\nThe best way to appreciate this theory is to consider the nature of\nthe most primitive stage of sensory experience. Some philosophers\nhave held that in our initial sensory states we have a subject or self\nconfronting and receiving information from an object\u2014which might be\neither a physical object or a sense-datum. The mistake here, in\nBradley\u2019s view, lies with the dualism this picture endorses, with\nthe idea that the initial experiences are ones in which the\nexperiencing self\u2019s consciousness is focused on an object.\nIn other words, these views see the initial stage of experience as\ncognitive (meaning there is an object before one\u2019s conscious\nawareness); in other words they are intentional mental states.\nBradley rejects this, arguing that there is level of a non-cognitive\nexperience at the foundation of all cognitive experiences. At\nthis logically prior level conscious experiences have no objects.\nBeing in pain is often offered as an example of this sort of mental\nstate. Bradley calls this level of experience\n\u201cfeeling\u201d to remind us that we are dealing with a\nnon-cognitive mental state below the level of thought; and it is also\ncalled \u201cimmediate experience\u201d because it is as yet\nunmediated by any mental operations such as attention and\nabstraction. The reason Bradley advances this view of immediate\nexperience lies with his analysis of the structure of thought.\nPut roughly, he claims that in judging that \u201cThe wolf is eating\nthe lamb,\u201d for example, we separate various aspects of what is\nimmediately given and assert a relationship between them, which\ninvolves mental operations such as attention and abstracting.\nOperations of this sort must be working on experience that is a\nnon-relational unity. (In a sense then, the argument for\nimmediate experience is transcendental, in the Strawsonian sense that\nit can be shown to be a necessary condition of the mental operations we\ncan and do perform.) Finally, at some point the subject-object or\nexperience-experienced dichotomy has to arise.\n\nThe details of Bradley\u2019s doctrine of immediacy need not detain us\nhere, but one point is of central importance: when we move to the\nhigher level of consciousness that entails intentional mental states\nthere supposedly remains a residual \u201cfeel\u201d of the unity of\nimmediate experience, and some residual sense of the\n\u201ccontents\u201d of immediate experience. This is relevant to\nthe question of why there is an impulse to become an infinite whole:\nit is because we carry a residual feel that all reality is a\nsystematic non-relational unity. In other words, there is a residual\ntrace of the primitive level of immediacy or feeling that moves us\ntoward wholeness in the sense that we feel at odds, incomplete, when\nwe conceive of ourselves as defined by our relations to\n\u2018things\u2019 and \u2018other selves\u2019. And when we\nconsider this along with the theory of the nature of thought, we\nrecognize that these experiences as they are expressed in statements\nactually leave out other aspects of the given and so are\nincomplete. In this way judgments are never completely accurate and\nonly partly true. (This is Bradley\u2019s theory of the degrees of truth.)\nThe consequence of this line of thinking for moral theory is that we\nhave a test by which to determine whether we have realized ourselves\nin a particular case: namely, have we arrived at a greater unity,\nwhich means fewer felt contradictions or explicit contradictions in\nour desires, our dispositions and the like? The ideal moral self is\nachieved when we arrive at a point at which it has no limiting\nrelations, which is to say, when we are an infinite whole, a\nsystematic organic unity. That we can be part way along in this\nprogress toward the ideal moral self, and in our understanding of what\nthe ideal moral self demands, reflects what will later become his\ntheory of degrees of reality. In the case of morality, one step on the\nroad to perfection occurs when we stop thinking of other people in our\ncommunity as forces or wills pitted against us\u2014that is, when we\nstop seeing our relations to them as external\u2014and begin to see\nothers as internally related to us. Being internally related to others\nin our community means that our relations to others are essential to\nus, in the sense of defining who and what we are. By contrast,\nexternal relations make no difference to their terms.  For example, my\nbeing in front of the Eiffel Tower is usually said to be an external\nrelation I bear to that object\u2014it does not make me a different\nperson. Put roughly, the difference between a mere collection of\npeople\u2014such as those who went to the parade yesterday\u2014and\na community or social unit such as a family\u2014lies in whether the\nrelationships each person bears to the others in the group makes a\ndifference to who and what they are. This internal bond is observed\nwhenever a member of the community talks of what \u201cwe\u201d\nbelieve, value, and so on. Here is the appearance of what has been\ncalled \u201cwe-intentionality.\u201d\n3. The Content of Volitional Choices\n\n\nThe next task is to show what provides the moral content for\npractical deliberations and choices about how to act. Most\nimportantly, we want to know what specific types of actions or goals\nwill allow us to realize ourselves. Here Bradley turns to historical\nethical theories to determine whether they can supply what is\nwanted. Bradley examines teleological hedonism and deontological\ntheories and finds both unacceptable. Deontological theories fail\nbecause they place no constraints on what can be willed by a moral\nagent and so no specific end is indicated and none barred.\nDeontology is one-sided and abstract: it has focused on the\nuniversal aspect of the will and disregarded the other, equally\nimportant particular element. What is in fact missing is any\nadequate psychological account of desire which explains how we are\nmotivated to do specific things, to make specific choices. By\ncontrast, ethical hedonism makes the opposite mistake of focusing on\nthe particular to the detriment of the universal side. Classical\nUtilitarianism, for example, sees particular pleasant states as the\ngoal of action but cannot present any of these as having any intrinsic\nvalue, for they are only means to the maximization of pleasure and\ncould be replaced by any other means that were more, or equally,\neffective. Moreover\u2014and this is an objection raised by all the\nBritish Idealists against hedonism\u2014since pleasant states perish\nthere is no sense in which a number of them can be enjoyed together as\nfelt states rather than merely remembered. So, a sum of pleasures\nor a maximum of pleasures cannot be the end moral agents are to aim\nfor.\n\n\nThere is another reason the British Idealists believed that pleasure\ncould not be the end of moral action. Henry Sidgwick correctly\nexpressed this objection: \u201cIt is said \u2026 by Mr. Green\nthat \u2018pleasure as feeling, in distinction from its conditions\nwhich are not feelings, cannot be conceived\u2019; and, therefore, of\ncourse, cannot be taken as an end of rational action\u201d\n(Hedonism and the Ultimate Good, p.36). The debate Green\nis weighing in on concerns what can and cannot be the intentional\nobjects of desires. Sidgwick claims that Green\u2019s argument\ntrades on an ambiguous use of \u2018conceive\u2019. We might\nnot be able to \u201cform the notion of an angle without the notion of\nthe sides containing it,\u201d says Sidgwick, but we can see\nthat an angle is greater than or equal to another \u201cwithout any\ncomparison of the containing sides\u201d (loc. cit.).\nThis misses the point. It is not that I have to compare sides in\norder to ascertain the size of an angle, but rather that our\nconception of an angle entails the notion of a space\ncontained, as it were, between two lines that meet at a point and we\ncannot \u2018think\u2019 of a \u2018mere angle\u2019 in the sense\nof an unbounded spatial quantity. Applied to pleasures, the issue\nis whether there are naked pleasures, as it were, and whether one can\nattach any meaning to the idea of a pleasure detached from the activity\nor whatever it is that is the pleasant experience. Bradley made a\nsimilar point in Ethical Studies: pleasure and pain are\nfeelings which \u201care as they are felt to be, but they\ntell us nothing. In a word they have no content: they are states\nof us, but they have nothing for us (Ethical Studies, p.\n94). If we cannot characterize pleasures\u2014because they\nhave no meaning or content in and of themselves\u2014then we cannot\nidentify with them and so they could not be the objects aimed at in\nrational choice, as Green had said.\n\n\nMill had in effect rejected this view by accepting that pleasures\ndisplay qualitative differences. Bradley recognizes that we\ntalk as though they do, using expressions which appear to\nentail that pleasures and pains have immediately given felt qualities\nbut he offers an explanation of why this is. He starts with the\nobservation that while it is uncertain whether all sensations are\n\u201dcoloured by pain and pleasure\u201c it is certain that\n\u201dwithout sensation we never have pleasure or pain\u201c\n(Collected Essays, p. 244). Just as sensations never occur\napart from some psychic context, which may make a significant\ndifference to the sensation, neither do pleasures and pains\n\u201dexist apart from sensation\u201c (Collected Essays,\np.  245). He goes on to assert that \u201dpains and pleasures have no\nqualities of their own,\u201c it being \u201dthe quality of the\nsensations, or arrangements of sensations, which we place to their\ncredit. The kinds of pains which have been urged in disproof of the\nabove, the feelings that shoot or that burn or gnaw, are each due to\nthe special sort of sensations, together with the rhythm of intensity\nin the pain\u201c (loc cit). If this is true, it offers a reason why\nwe might mistake a quantitative for a qualitative difference, namely,\nthat we mistake variations in sensory intensities and\nintensity-patterns over time, with which pleasure is attached or\nattendant, for qualitative differences in the pleasures\nthemselves. Given that further features of the overall experience are\nsaid to be attributable to the powers of the sensations,\nthese\u2014rather than the pains and pleasures\u2014appear to be the\ncausal agents. If this interpretation is correct, pains and pleasures\nare epiphenomena. For present purposes the importance of this is that\nit bolsters the Idealists\u2019 argument that pleasure cannot be the end of\nrational action, leave alone the ultimate end of moral action. It also\nexplains the so-called Paradox of Hedonism.\n\nBoth of these views\u2014hedonism and deontology\u2014approach morality from\nthe perspective of the individual person. This individual is\ntreated as a fully formed moral agent independent of any social\nrelations. Each is able to decide what is morally required by\nconsulting a formal principle in their mind (e.g., the Kantian\ncategorical imperative) or their own feeling states. In\nresponding to individualism, which he thinks ultimately rests on a\nfalse theory of human nature, Bradley\u2019s worry as far as morality\nis concerned is that it reflects a kind of egoistic antagonism to other\npeople that makes morality impossible: if the self we are\n\u201dto realize is an atom, a unit which repels other units, and can\nhave nothing in itself but what is exclusively its, its\nfeelings, its pleasure and pain\u2014then it is certain that it can stand\nto others, with their pleasures and pains, only in external relation;\nand since it is the end, the others must be the means, and nothing but\nthe means. On such a basis morality is impossible\n\u00c9\u201c (Ethical Studies, p, 115). It is\nimpossible because, since morality requires being an organic whole,\nsocial relations that are external defeat that goal. The sort of\nconfrontational individualism in which each asserts his or her will\nagainst the wills of others generates the intolerable situation that\ncontract theories take to be the motivation for creating the social\ncontract, which in its turn becomes another form of external constraint\non individuals that prevents the community from becoming anything other\nthan a mere collection of egoistic, atomic individuals.\n\n\nIn opposition to individualism Bradley endorses the thesis of\nholism. Debates pitting individualism and holism against each\nother usually focus either on questions about explanations or on\nquestions about the essential nature of social creatures such as human\nbeings. Methodological individualism takes a position on the\nfirst of these, claiming that the explanation of the behavior of\ncollective or corporate entities requires reduction to the beliefs,\naims, and desires of individuals making up that collective. There\nhas recently been some interesting literature on this debate, expressed\nin terms of whether corporations and other groups can be said to have a\nperspective (a set of beliefs and values) such that it would be\nappropriate to say that the collective itself has beliefs, desires, and\nso on, thereby exhibiting a form of collective intentionality\n(we-intentionality) that is not reducible to the intentional mental\nstates of its members (e.g., French and Wettstein\u2019s Shared\nIntentions and Collective Responsibility). Bradley at times\ntalks of society and the state in ways which suggest he would accept\nthe position of the proponents of collective intentionality, and\nperhaps he must commit to it if the argument for metaphysical holism,\nwhich is his main concern, goes through.\n\n\nThe metaphysical thesis claims that individuals are what they are\nbecause of their social relations. To the extent that Bradley\noffers anything in the way of argument for this position he tends to\nlean rather heavily on empirical evidence which shows us that people\nborn at different times and places, and born into this or that cultural\nor religious or ethnic group, will tend to inherit the practices and\nattitudes of those by whom they are raised. He does think of\nchildren as born with certain natural needs and desires and with\ncertain aptitudes and latent possibilities; but these need nurturing\nand some of these tendencies need to be \u201dcivilized\u201c, the\neffect being: \u201dThese \u2018civilized tendencies\u2019, if\nwe may use the phrase, are part of the essence of the\nchild: he would only partly (if at all) be himself without\nthem; he owes them to his ancestors, and his ancestors owe them to\nsociety\u201c (Ethical Studies, p. 170). Against the\nindividualist who objects that there was, nevertheless, a point at\nwhich there were no societies but only individuals, he elicits the aid\nof Darwin in support of the view that humans have always been\nsocial, having evolved from social animals. But Bradley has a\nmore interesting argument for holism which enters on language.\nThe language a community speaks has to be truly public, with understood\nand accepted meanings for its central terms, on pain of ending with\nnobody ever understanding what anyone else is talking about. The\nlanguage also has, embedded in it as it were, the values and beliefs of\nthe community that speaks it. In passing on its language to the\nchildren a society is passing on its values, its understanding of its\ninstitutions and so on. As Bradley says, for each child, learning\nto speak the language \u201dcarries into his mind the ideas and\nsentiments of the race \u00c9 and stamps them in indelibly\u201c\nThis child also observes and comes to participate in the practices of\nthe society: he \u201dgrows up in an atmosphere of example and\ngeneral custom\u201c (Ethical Studies, p.\n172).\n\nHolism has ramifications for the theory of self-realization, because if\none\u2019s social relations are constitutive of what one is then the\nself is only realized when it recognizes and endorses the duties it has\nas a member of a community\u2014a family, a state, and so on. At\nthis point the self\u2019s perspective shifts from the subjective\nfeelings and goals of the individual to the idea of moral\nobligations that are objective, in that they hold for all in the\ncommunity, and also objective in that one has them no matter what\npersonal desires one might have. Of course, with the recognition that\none is a member of the community the situation will not be construed as\n\u201dthem\u201c forcing \u201dme\u2019 to behave a certain way;\nbut will give rise to genuine collective intentionality, to viewing\nthings in terms of what we believe and value.\n\nOne key thing that happens at this stage is that the idea of realizing\nthe self is now given specific content. Earlier we saw the moral\nagent, the moral self, in terms of the formal structure of volitional\naction, but here we see a self that has specific content attached to\nits realization or perfecting of itself, for the communal morality\nindicates what is expected of someone if they wish to be regarded as a\nvirtuous member of that moral community. Moreover, society offers\nthe homogeneity and specificity that moral development demands:\nsocial life not only provides a greater degree of homogeneity, in that\nit removes the dualism of oneself and others, but it provides an\nexpansion of the self through the greater diversity (specificity) found\nin living with others, since that communal life expands one\u2019s\nexperience beyond what is available to her as a mere, isolated,\nindividual. Again, we have movement in the direction of being an\ninfinite whole because relations previously thought to be external to\nthe individual\u2014and thereby limiting factors\u2014are now seen as\ninternal to the self.\n\n\nIn passing, it is interesting to consider why Bradley approves of\nfollowing the feelings of the phronimos\u2014the person of\npractical wisdom\u2014when he has no faith in the judgments of Mill\u2019s\ncompetent judges who are said to be able to rank pleasures and no\nconfidence in Mill\u2019s Moral Almanac (Utilitarianism, Chapter\n2). The difference is that Mill\u2019s experts are simply reporting their\nown personal feelings\u2014which are not authoritative, for anyone\nelse could disagree and there is no test available to determine who is\nright\u2014and the Moral Almanac is merely a collection of\nthese sorts of experiences; while, by contrast, the phronimos\nhas, through long experience within his society, come to identify with\nthe values of that society and so his judgments and choices reflect\nthese values. The social norms have become such a part of who he is\nthat he need not think about what to do but has an intuitive\n\u201cfeel\u201d for what morality demands (Ethical\nStudies, p. 196). If this is correct, it seems then that\nthe phronimos no longer feels any conflict between the\nparticular self he is and the self he ought to be as a member of\nsociety. Bradley noted Goethe\u2019s directive to \u201cBe a\nwhole or join a whole,\u201d which he amended to, \u201cYou\ncan not be a whole, unless you join a whole\u201d\n(Ethical Studies, p.79). This is what the\nphronimos has done, thereby transforming his external\nrelations to others in society into the internal relations\ncharacteristic of parts of an organic unity. (Whether this means that\nthe phronimos is therefore not able to be an inspiration\nor a spur to initiating social change, or is unable himself to rise to\nthe level of Ideal Morality, is a question Bradley does not\naddress. But it should be the case, for the phronimos no\nlonger retains the degree of residual individuality which is required\nby the next level of morality, Ideal Morality.)\n\nBradley has two reservations about the morality of the community.\nFirst, there are some ways of realizing or perfecting oneself that\nappear to have nothing to do with morality proper or with society,\nwhich raises a question about the limits of morality, about whether the\ndemands of self-realization go beyond the moral obligation to perfect\noneself as a member of society. Does the artist have an\nobligation to perfect her talents? If so, is this a moral\nobligation? Bradley notes that it seems reasonable to say that we\nwill not realize ourselves if we fail to develop our talents and\nabilities and he even feels some temptation to call this a moral\nobligation\u2014or at least an obligation of some sort\u2014while at the same\ntime admitting that there are spheres of activity that are or should be\nfree of obligation, where we are left to our own devices.\nIn saying this he is admitting that individualism is not totally wrong,\nfor even members of a community remain individuals pursuing their own\nseparate plans and projects, albeit within the framework of the\ncommunity\u2019s social and political institutions and its normative\nunderstandings and commitments. The second reservation is that the\nreflective individual may come to feel that her society is wrong in\nsome respect or is in what Bradley calls a \u201crotten\u201d\ncondition. While it may not be clear what \u2018rotten\u2019\nwould mean or how one would determine whether a society was in this\ncondition or not, it is clear that change can be urged if we discover a\ncontradiction in the moral views of our society. For example, if\nthe constitution claimed all are equal before the law yet specific laws\ndenied benefits or access to the institutions of the state to some\ngroup, then we would have a contradiction. Denying same sex\npartners the opportunity to marry and enjoy whatever rights and social\nbenefits that go along with that status may be relevant contemporary\nexample. Given this possibility, there has to be some scope for\nrevising social rules and political institutions, which means one would\nbe opposing society\u2019s moral values and in doing this, more or\nless opposing oneself in that one\u2019s moral perspective has been\ninherited from members of that society, from the ancestors. In this\ncase the opposition between the subjective self and the superior moral\nself identified with the community breaks out again, which then becomes\nthe impetus to a change in moral values.\n\n\nThis illuminates Bradley\u2019s remark that social morality is both\nabsolute and relative. The morality of one\u2019s society has a\nprima facie claim on individual members and so is absolute in\nthe sense that no one is free simply to go her own way; yet the social\nmorality may change for the same reasons the perspective of an\nindividual might change\u2014for example, because of the discovery of new\nfacts or with the revelation of a contradiction which forces a\nre-thinking of present values\u2014and so they are only relative.\nThus, while the individual has a prima facie obligation to be\nas good as his society he also has the obligation to be reflective\nabout social morality and to determine whether it requires\nmodification.\n4. The Psychology of Moral Development\n\n\nWhat remains to be explained is how the moral consciousness arises,\nand Bradley\u2019s account, not surprisingly, depends on the fact that\nchildren are raised in a social environment and will learn by\nexperience. At an early stage of mental life the child will experience\npleasure from some object\u2014say an apple\u2014and transfers the\npleasant sensation to the object, so that it becomes part of the\ncontent of the apple, a part of what that object means to the child,\nor, better, a part of what the child sees in that object. The child\ngenerates an appetite for objects of this sort and in the presence of\nan apple the child will have a mixed reaction: a pleasant feeling\nbecause the object is seen as pleasant, but a painful feeling because\nshe is not in possession of, or enjoying, the apple. This produces a\nfelt tension\u2014\u201cfelt\u201d because it is occurring at a\npre-cognitive level, before the child has beliefs about the object is\nor able to make inferences about the object based on past\nexperience. This felt tension is desire and it moves the child to\naction, to try to take physical possession of it. Bradley\u2019s\npsychological account differs from the hedonist\u2019s in that whereas\nhedonism holds that a particular pleasure is willed, Bradley claims\nthat the ideal object willed is a particular thing which has had a\npleasant quality transferred to it and thereby attributed to the thing\nitself. Moreover, on Bradley\u2019s account the will\u2014once we get to\nthe stage of having a fully developed self capable of having a\nwill\u2014is actually seeking the object willed because it represents\nthe satisfaction of the self following the process of\nidentification. However, at this stage we have at best a very\nprimitive precursor of the self and it can only be said to affirm\nitself. That is, it lacks the developed consciousness necessary to\nrepresenting ideal objects. Moreover, the child at this stage lacks\nthe higher-order consciousness needed to see itself as realizing\nitself by attaining an ideal object with which it has identified its\nsatisfaction. It only \u201caffirms\u201d itself in that it puts its\nwill into the world as its appetites and desires respond to sensible\nobjects and in this its unarticulated objective is to possess the\nthing it desires. At this early stage the child desires the object\nonly when it is present; at a later stage the child will gain a sense\nof these things as independent external objects that persist,\nceteris paribus, and so can be desired in their\nabsence.\n\n\nThe child also experiences other people and is eventually going to\nrecognize them as individuals with independent wills\u2014i.e., as\nothers who have their own plans and projects and as selves attempting\nto realize themselves through their actions, and who, because of these\nfacts, may oppose or confirm its own desires, oppose its will. Since\ninitially these others are going to be family members or care-givers\nthere will be a pre-conscious bond of affection between them and the\nchild. When the child acts in accord with the will of another,\npleasure results from the affirmation from that other person, while\nopposition is experienced as painful because it negates the bond of\naffection. This produces the felt tension similar to that which occurs\nin the case of an inaccessible desired object: a tension between the\npleasure associated with the presence of the care-giver and the pain\nof being without the approval of that person. The main point here is\nthat the child will tend to be good (i.e., fit in with the norms and\nexpectations of the caregivers) solely because not doing so is\npainful, not because the child has, at this stage, any goal it is\ntrying to achieve by being good, nor even the ability to articulate\nwhy it acts as it does. As Bradley says, \u201cThe child is taught to\nwill a content which is universal and good, and he learns to identify\nhis will with it, so that he feels pleasure when he feels himself in\naccord with it, uneasiness or pain when his will is contrary thereto,\nand he feels that it is contrary. This is the beginning of personal\nmorality\u201d (Ethical Studies, p. 178).\n\nAs the child develops it learns the language of morality and thereby\nthe moral perspective embedded in it. In this process the child\nlearns the meaning of normative concepts and in doing so learns what\nthey mean to others in the shared linguistic community. In this\nway the social community imparts a moral perspective. In fact,\nthe community introduces the child to two levels of moral\nreflection: it imparts specific moral values and norms through\nits institutions and practices, and; it provides the moral concepts\nthat are necessary to the task of conceiving of ways to improve\nsociety, in this way making possible the move to the more comprehensive\nlevel of Ideal Morality.\n\nThe above rehearsal glosses over several identifiable stages of moral\ndevelopment set out in Bradley\u2019s moral psychology. These\ndetails can be ignored here, for the important point to note is that\nBradley attempts to supple a psychological account of moral development\nthat fills in the final part of his exposition of the theory of\nself-realization by explaining how one comes to identify one\u2019s\nsatisfaction with the achieving or realizing of particular moral\nends. It is also important to note the roles he assigns to\npleasure and pain. That these have a place in his moral theory\nindicates that the ethical hedonists were not totally wrong about their\nimportance, their mistake being to think that promoting pleasure and\ndiminishing pain marks the ultimate goal of moral\nactivity. By contrast, Bradley argues that in acting\nmorally we choose and will and act in terms of the idea of a state of\naffairs which represents a superior self to be realized. We feel\npleasure at the thought of that self with which we have identified\nbecause we feel affirmed by the thought of its realization. We\nfeel pain at the felt contradiction between this and our actual self\nand pain at the thought of not being the superior self we desire.\n5. The End of Morality\n\n\nBradley\u2019s excursion into moral psychology represents an\neffort to explain the process whereby one identifies one\u2019s\nsatisfaction with a particular ideal object, which is an essential\nelement in the structure of volitional action. He traces the\ntransitions from a very primitive state of mental life through to the\nsort of consciousness exhibited by a mature moral agent. From\nprimitive appetites which involve a precursor self that affirms itself\nthrough its desires we arrive at a variety of types of actions and of\nobjects of volition and different relations between the self and the\nobjects. Children move from the simple desire to possess the\nobject to the pleasure taken in the approval of others, to\nself-conscious moral action and its pleasures. These stages also reveal\nthe development of feelings and emotions and an increasing range of\ntypes of object that one might take pleasure in. In other words,\nthere is an extension of the individual\u2019s range of interests and\nthese move out beyond desired objects to an interest in other people\nand future events and so on. In this process the self is\ndeveloping its conception of itself and once it recognizes that its\nfate is tied to that of society we have a social self that does not see\nitself as being indifferent to the interests of others.\n\nAn important feature of this developmental process is gaining knowledge\nof good and bad and the capacity to will both. The need for this\narises, first, at the formal level of the structure of volitional\naction, which entails the dualism of inferior and superior selves (or\nconceptions of these). To get beyond formal necessary conditions\nto an account of specific actions this formal structure has to be\nfilled in with some determinate content which explains what the nature\nof these two selves is. At the level of social\nmorality this may involve no more than knowledge of what society\ndemands of me\u2014which I will identify as the superior, good self I\nshould be\u2014alongside my tendencies to go my own way which marks the\nbad self that opposes the social norms. But there must be more\nthan mere knowledge, for it is also necessary, psychologically, that we\nactually feel the tension produced by the conflicting tendencies to be\nboth good and bad. It is not simply that one fails to comprehend\nfully the nature of moral action without this, but that we also cannot\nfeel the contradictions that will move us to action, and without action\nthere is no morality. Hence, the common notion that moral agents\nare often viewed as having to expend a great deal of effort on the\ninternal struggle between the desire to be good and a propensity to do\nthings known to be bad is correct. In Bradley\u2019s theory the\nultimate moral end of self-realization presents two pictures of the\nself, labels one of these \u201csuperior\u201d and sets the moral\ntask as realizing that superior self in the face of the actual,\ninferior self. In this way moral conflicts are always internal\nstruggles. In acting morally I aim at realizing my good self,\nwhich I see as my true self. Yet I cannot in good faith say that\nmy bad self is not myself, with the result that, as Bradley rather\npicturesquely puts it, \u201cwhen I enter the lists against it, it is\nat my own breast that I lay my lance in rest\u201d (Ethical\nStudies, p. 277).\n\n\nUnfortunately, this also marks the final tension that renders\nmorality a self-contradiction. To the extent that people have both a\ngood and a bad self, they are a \u201cself-contradiction,\u201d and\nif these are necessary to morality as Bradley\u2019s suggests they are\nthen the ultimate moral end of action\u2014self-realization as an infinite\nwhole\u2014cannot be achieved. As he puts it, \u201cwe are a\nself-contradiction: we never are what we feel we really are; we really\nare what we know we are not; and if we became what we are, we should\nscarcely be ourselves\u201d (Ethical Studies, p. 234).\nMorality really seeks its own demise for were the ideal self realized\nthere would be nothing that remains to be actualized, at which point\nmorality is at an end. \u201cMorality aims at the cessation of\nthat which makes it possible\u201d (loc. cit.) This\nparallels Bradley\u2019s metaphysical position: if thought actually\nwere to capture the supra-relational unity that is Reality, thought\nwould have to have passed beyond itself, committing what Bradley calls\n\u201cthought\u2019s happy suicide.\u201d Because thought by\nits very nature analyzes and abstracts it cannot ever express the unity\nthat Reality is and which is only dimly felt in immediate\nexperience. Similarly for morality: \u201cit is the effort after\nnon-morality, and it presses forward beyond itself to a super-moral\nsphere where it ceases to exist as such\u201d (loc.\ncit.). Indeed, some writers think we can pass beyond\nmorality into the sphere of religion. One advantage of this is\nthat we might find an ideal moral type\u2014say the Jesus of Christianity\n- which provides an example of the ideal self we should be aiming\nat. In fact it could be claimed that in religion the self that is\nonly ideal in morality is actual in the religious experience. But at\nthe end of the day Bradley believes that the old moral dichotomy\nbetween good and bad will break out again, with \u2018sin\u2019\nreplacing the \u2018bad\u2019 of morality. Thus,\ndisharmony arises necessarily, and the moral self is not realized in\nreligious experience.\n\n\nNone of this should surprise us. Bradley\u2019s view is that\nevery study, whether it is of morality or the natural world or religion\nor whatever, begins from some working hypotheses. It is the job\nof metaphysics to lay bare these hypotheses and show how they all fit\ntogether. Were the final picture put together we would have an\nabsolute and finished view of reality. But attaining this\ncomprehensive and coherent view is impossible because of the nature of\nthought, and so the role of the notion of the Absolute\u2014a coherent,\ncomprehensive conception of Reality\u2014has the logic of a limiting\ncase. In morality we similarly seek an ideal self, one that is\nhomogeneous (coherent) but also fully specified (comprehensive),\nbut this is not attainable, as we have seen, thereby demonstrating that\nthe notion of an ideal self that is an infinite whole also has the\nlogic of a limiting case. It may guide our moral thinking and our\npractical reasoning, but it does not represent a condition anyone can\nachieve. Once we recognize that the end is not attainable,\nthat is the end of morality, and this is not a result of weakness on\nthe part of moral agents but a result of the logical structure of\nvolitional choice.\n6. Bradley\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nBradley never produced a book on political philosophy and the few\npublished papers touching on social and political themes present views\nthat do not diverge from the position he set out in\nEthical Studies, in particular, in the fifth essay, My\nStation and its Duties. From that text we can see that Bradley\nwould have sided with the Twentieth Century communitarians who opposed\nthe individualistic political theories of Rawls and Nozick (see\nKymlicka, Chapter 4). In terms of the more recent debates about\nLiberal neutrality (see Wall and\nKlosko\u2019sPerfectionism and Neutrality)\u2014in\nwhich the liberals advance the claim that that political institutions\nand society\u2019s laws and institutional structures are not to\nreflect any particular conception of the good\u2014Bradley would\nundoubtedly have sided with the opponents of neutrality who think\ncultural, ethnic, religious and other such groups have a set of values\nthat are central to who they are and which they rightly feel need\nprotecting. Similarly, Bradley\u2019s views on individual rights\nare consistent with the social holism of \u201cMy\nStation.\u201d He opposed natural rights, taking rights to be\nsocial constructs. Indeed, in a paper in 1894 he allied himself\nwith the Utilitarians in claiming that the general welfare takes\nprecedence over the rights of individuals and went so far as to say\nthat \u201cthe right of the moral organism is absolute\u201d over and\nagainst the rights of its members (Collected Essays, p.\n158). In one discussion of punishment he takes seriously the\n\u201cprinciple of social surgery\u201d taken as \u201cthe right and\nthe duty of the organism to suppress its undesirable growths\u201d\n(Collected Essays, p. 152). All of this is consistent\nwith the claim in Ethical Studies that the moral standards and\ndemands of the society\u2014and by implication, acceptance of\nsociety\u2019s political institutions\u2014have a prima facie claim on\nthe individual members of that society.\nBradley also recognized the importance of social nurturing and teaching\nthat raise a human being from the level of its basic desires and\nimpulses to the level at which she becomes, and is recognized as, a\nrational moral agent. Only if one has learned the normative\nlanguage of the community and shows by one\u2019s behavior that the\nvalues and standards are understood, and that one is able to act with\nthem in mind, does a person get recognized as a member of the moral\ncommunity and treated as a full and equal member who can be reasoned\nwith and who will take the values embedded in, and reflected in,\nsociety\u2019s social and political institutions into consideration in\nher volitional action. Social and political institutions are not\ncreated by atomic individuals out of some pre-social primordial\nmaterial, and this marks the place that contract theories of the state\ngo wrong. Their basic error is to think that talk of individuals\nabstracted from all social relations would have any meaning. This error\nis compounded by assuming that individuals are pure rational\ncalculators without emotional attachments to others around them who\nenter into social cooperation only for personal gain. This error\nthen gets connected to the earlier error in theories such as\nLocke\u2019s when it is claimed that these abstract atomic individuals\nenter the contracting situation with a bundle of natural rights which\nthey hold as perpetual constraints on what others can do. Bradley\nand all the British Idealists thought that contract theories and\nindividualistic approaches to social and political relations were\ngrounding their political philosophies on false views of human nature\nand human society. In a word, their basic errors were mistakes in\nmetaphysics.\nAlthough it is not a topic for this occasion, it would be of some\ninterest to consider what his contemporaries had to say regarding the\ninterplay of ethics and political theory.  On this issue, Green\u2019s work\non ethics and his lectures on political obligation would be worth\nconsulting. Moreover, the student of this period in the history of\nBritish moral philosophy would also do well to compare the writings of\nGreen, Bradley and Sidgwick.  All three published around the same\ntime: Sidgwick\u2019s Methods in 1874, Bradley\u2019s Ethical\nStudies in 1876 and Green\u2019s Prolegomena to Ethics\nposthumously in 1883.  Taken together, these works provide important\nassessments of the writings of earlier moral theorists, such as Kant\nand J. S. Mill, as well interesting discussions of moral psychology,\ncentral moral concepts, and the role of moral theory.  These are all\ndifficult and complex texts - which makes comparative studies of their\nviews rather daunting.  Fortunately, some studies have recently\nappeared that offer useful introductions to such a comparative study -\nespecially, Mander\u2019s studies of the British Idealists and Irwin\u2019s\nchapters on Sidgwick, Green and Bradley in his history of ethics (see\nthe bibliography, below).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Bradley, F.
