    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nJohannes Kepler was born on December 27, 1571 in Weil der Stadt, a\nlittle town near Stuttgart in W\u00fcrttemberg in southwestern\nGermany. Unlike his father Heinrich, who was a soldier and mercenary,\nhis mother Katharina was able to foster Kepler\u2019s intellectual\ninterests. He was educated in Swabia; firstly, at the schools Leonberg\n(1576), Adelberg (1584) and Maulbronn (1586); later, thanks to support\nfor a place in the famous T\u00fcbinger Stift, at the\nUniversity of T\u00fcbingen. Here, Kepler became Magister\nArtium (1591) before he began his studies in the Theological\nFaculty. At T\u00fcbingen, where he received a solid education in\nlanguages and in science, he met Michael Maestlin, who introduced him\nto the new world system of Copernicus (see Mysterium\nCosmographicum, trans. Duncan, p. 63, and KGW 20.1, VI, pp.\n144\u2013180).\n\nBefore concluding his theology studies at T\u00fcbingen, in\nMarch/April 1594 Kepler accepted an offer to teach mathematics as the\nsuccessor to Georg Stadius at the Protestant school in Graz (in\nStyria, Austria). During this period (1594\u20131600), he composed\nmany official calendars and prognostications and published his first\nsignificant work, the Mysterium Cosmographicum (= MC), which\ncatapulted him to fame overnight. On April 27, 1597 Kepler married his\nfirst wife, Barbara M\u00fcller von M\u00fchleck. As a consequence of\nthe anti-Protestant atmosphere in Graz and thanks also to the positive\nimpact of his MC on the scientific community, he abandoned Graz and\nmoved to Prague in 1600, to work under the supervision of the great\nDanish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601). His first contact\nwith Tycho was, however, extremely traumatic, particularly because of\nthe Ursus affair (see below Section 4.1). After Tycho\u2019s\nunexpected death on October 1601 Kepler succeeded him as Imperial\nMathematician. During his time in Prague, Kepler was particularly\nproductive. He completed his most important optical works,\nAstronomiae pars optica (=APO) and\nDioptrice (=D), published several treatises on astrology\n(De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus, Antwort auf\nRoeslini Diskurs; Tertius interveniens), discussed\nGalileo\u2019s telescopic discoveries (Dissertatio cum nuncio\nsidereo), and composed his most significant astronomical work,\nthe Astronomia nova (=AN), which contains his first two laws\nof planetary motion.\n\nOn August 3, 1611 Kepler\u2019s wife, Barbara M\u00fcller, died. In\n1612 he moved to Linz, in Upper Austria, and became a professor at the\nLandschaftsschule. There, he served as Mathematician of the\nUpper Austrian Estates from 1612 to 1628. In 1613, he married Susanne\nReuttinger, with whom he had six children. In 1615, he completed the\nmathematical works Stereometria doliorum and Messekunst\nArchimedis. At the end of 1617 Kepler successfully defended his\nmother, who had been accused of witchcraft. In 1619 he published his\nprincipal philosophical work, the Harmonice mundi (=HM), and\nwrote, partially at the same time, the Epitome astronomiae\ncopernicanae (=EAC). In 1624 Kepler continued his investigations\non mathematics, publishing his work on logarithms (Chilias\nlogarithmorum\u2026).\n\nIn pursuit of an accurate printer for the Tabulae\nRudolphinae, he moved to Ulm near the end of 1626 and remained\nthere until the end of 1627. In July 1628 he went to Sagan to enter\nthe service of Albrecht von Wallenstein (1583\u20131634). He died on\nNovember 15, 1630 at Regensburg, where he was to present his financial\nclaims before the imperial authorities (for Kepler\u2019s life,\nCaspar\u2019s biography (1993) is still the best work. KGW 19\ncontains biographically relevant documents).\n",
