    "main_text": "Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of effective method and decision method || Leibniz\n2.2 Leibniz\n\nLeibniz designed a calculating machine that he said would add,\nsubtract, multiply and divide, and in 1673 he demonstrated a version\nof his machine in London and Paris (Leibniz 1710). His interest in\nmechanical methods led him to an even grander conception, inspired in\npart by Llull\u2019s unclear but provocative speculations about a\ngeneral-purpose question-answering mechanism. Leibniz said that Llull\n\u201chad scraped the skin off\u201d this idea, but \u201cdid not\nsee its inmost parts\u201d (Leibniz 1671 [1926: 160]). Leibniz\nenvisaged a method, just as mechanical as multiplication or division,\nwhereby\n\n\nwhen there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us\ncalculate, without further ado, in order to see who is right. (Leibniz\n1685 [1951: 51])\n\n\nThe basis of the method, Leibniz explained, was that \u201cwe can\nrepresent all sorts of truths and consequences by Numbers\u201d and\n\u201cthen all the results of reasoning can be determined in\nnumerical fashion\u201d (Leibniz 1685 [1951: 50\u201351]). He hoped\nthe method would apply to \u201cMetaphysics, Physics, and\nEthics\u201d just as well as it did to mathematics (1685 [1951: 50]).\nThis conjectured method could, he thought, be implemented by what he\ncalled a machina combinatoria, a combinatorial machine\n(Leibniz n.d.1; Leibniz 1666). However, there was never much\nprogress towards his dreamed-of method, and in a letter two years\nbefore his death he wrote:\n\n\n[I]f I were younger or had talented young men to help me, I should\nstill hope to create a kind of universal symbolistic\n[sp\u00e9cieuse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] in which all truths\nof reason would be reduced to a kind of calculus. (Leibniz 1714 [1969:\n654])\n\n\nIn his theorizing Leibniz described what he called an ars\ninveniendi, a discovering or devising method. The function of an\nars inveniendi is to produce hitherto unknown truths of\nscience (Leibniz 1679 [1903: 37]; Leibniz n.d.2 [1890: 180];\nHermes 1969). A mechanical ars inveniendi would generate true\nstatements, and with time the awaited answer to a scientific question\nwould arrive (Leibniz 1671 [1926: 160]). Blessed with a universal\n(i.e., complete, and consistent) ars inveniendi, the user\ncould input any meaningful and unambiguous (scientific or\nmathematical) statement \\(S\\), and the machine would eventually\nrespond (correctly) with either \u201c\\(S\\) is true\u201d or\n\u201c\\(S\\) is false\u201d. As the groundbreaking developments in\n1936 by Church and Turing made clear, if the ars inveniendi\nis supposed to work by means of an effective method, then there can be\nno universal ars inveniendi\u2014and not even an ars\ninveniendi that is restricted to all mathematical statements,\nsince these include statements of the form \u201c\\(p\\) is\nprovable\u201d, or even to all purely logical statements.\n",
