    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || Internalism and Externalism\n3.4 Internalism and Externalism\n\nA number of philosophers have suggested that the content of\none\u2019s beliefs depends entirely on things going on inside\none\u2019s head, and not at all on the external world, except via the\neffects of the latter on one\u2019s brain. Consequently, if a genius\nneuroscientist were to create a molecule-for-molecule duplicate of\nyour brain and maintain it in a vat, stimulating it artificially so\nthat it underwent exactly the same sequence of electrical and chemical\nevents as your actual brain, that brain would have exactly the same\nbeliefs as you. Those who accept this position are\ninternalists about belief content. Those who reject it are\nexternalists.\n\nSeveral arguments against internalism have prompted considerable\ndebate in philosophy of mind. Here is a condensed version of one\nargument, due to Putnam (1975; though it should be said that\nPutnam\u2019s original emphasis was on linguistic meaning, not on\nbelief). Suppose that in 1750, in a far-off region of the universe,\nthere existed a planet that was physically identical to Earth,\nmolecule-for-molecule, in every respect but one: Where Earth had\nwater, composed of H2O, Twin Earth had something else\ninstead, \u201ctwater\u201d, coming down as rain and filling\nstreams, behaving identically to water by all the chemical tests then\navailable, but having a different atomic formula, XYZ. Intuitively, it\nseems that the inhabitants of Earth in 1750 would have beliefs about\nwater and no beliefs about twater, while the inhabitants of Twin Earth\nwould have beliefs about twater and no beliefs about water. By\nhypothesis, however, each inhabitant of Earth will have a molecularly\nidentical counterpart on Twin Earth with exactly the same brain\nstructures (except, of course, that their brains will contain XYZ\ninstead of H2O, but reflection on analogous examples\nregarding chemicals not contained in the brain suggests that this fact\nis irrelevant). Consequently, the argument goes, the contents of\none\u2019s beliefs do not depend entirely on internal properties of\none\u2019s brain.\n\nFor further detail on the debate between internalists and\nexternalists, see the entries on\n externalism about the mind\n and\n narrow mental content.\n",
