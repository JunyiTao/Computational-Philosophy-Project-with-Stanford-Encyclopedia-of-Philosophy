For example, color is a\ndeterminable having red, blue, and other specific\nshades of color as determinates; shape is a determinable\nhaving rectangular, oval, and other specific\n(including many irregular) shapes as determinates; mass is a\ndeterminable having specific mass values as determinates. Reflecting\nthat determinables admit of different degrees or levels of\nspecification, characterization of a property as determinable or\ndeterminate is typically relative; for example, red is a\ndeterminate of color and a determinable of\nscarlet.\n\nThe determination relation appears to differ from other specification\nrelations. In contrast with the genus-species and conjunct-conjunction\nrelations, where the more specific property can be understood as a\nconjunction of the less specific property and some independent\nproperty or properties, a determinate is not naturally treated in\nconjunctive terms (red is not a conjunctive property having\ncolor and some other property or properties as conjuncts);\nand in contrast with the disjunction-disjunct relation, where\ndisjuncts may be dissimilar and compatible (as with red or\nround), determinates of a determinable (at a given level of\nspecificity) are both similar and incompatible (red and\nblue are similar in both being colors; nothing can be\nsimultaneously and uniformly both red and blue).\nSupporting this latter contrast is that (as per Sorites phenomena, and\nordinary perceptual experience of macro-objects) our perceptions of\nproperties such as color and shape do not appear to\nbe of maximal determinates, as would be the case if determinables were\ndisjunctions of determinates (since every instance of a disjunction is\nan instance of one of its disjuncts).\n\nOf course, appearances can be deceiving, and there are strategies for\ntreating determinables and their mode of specification in deflationary\nterms. Whether these strategies succeed or fail is no small matter.\nFor the seemingly distinctive character of determinables and\ndetermination may enter into the best case for the claim that there\nare genuine features of reality that are less than maximally\nspecific\u2014a claim which, if true, has profound implications for a\nwide range of philosophical issues.\n\nWhat follows is organized into five sections. In \u00a71, we trace key\npoints of the historical trajectory whereby determination came to be\nseen as a distinctive form of specification. In \u00a72, we present\nthe commonly advanced features of determinables, determinates, and\ntheir relation; here also we discuss extensions of the (realistically\nconstrued) relation to ontological categories beyond properties. In\n\u00a73, we sketch the main anti-realist, reductionist, and\nnon-reductionist accounts of determinables and determinates, saying\nhow these aim to accommodate the seeming features of determinables and\ndeterminates, and flagging key concerns and responses; here also we\ndiscuss certain accounts of the structure or logic of determination.\nIn \u00a74, we consider reasons for and against thinking that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. In \u00a75, we\npresent three applications of these notions, on which the distinctive\nfeatures of determinables and/or determinates are seen as key to\nunderstanding physical laws of nature, mental/higher-level causation,\nand metaphysical (including quantum) indeterminacy.\n", "toc": [{"#HistTrea": "1.

Historical treatments\n\nThe following historical trajectory motivates the characteristic\nfeatures and certain treatments of determinables and determinates;\nthose interested in cutting to the contemporary chase can skip to\n\u00a72 with little loss of continuity.\n\nThe terminology of determinables and determinates stems from ancient\nand scholastic treatment of the definition of a species, as analyzable\ninto two parts: a genus, or generic part of an essence\u2014the\npars determinabilis essentiae, and the differentia, or\ndifferentiating part of an essence\u2014the pars determinans\nessentiae. As we\u2019ll see, the terminology and its original\napplication eventually went separate ways, with the genus-species\nrelation standardly being treated in conjunctive terms (with a given\nspecies being identified with the conjunction of a genus and one or\nmore differentia), and determination being treated as a distinctive\nnon-conjunctive specification\n relation.[1]\n1.1 Aristotle\u2019s identification of a non-conjunctive specification relation\n\nSome recent commentators have suggested that the notion of\ndetermination has a precursor in ancient times. For example, Granger\n(1984) has proposed that Aristotle\u2019s preferred treatment of the\nrelation between kinds and forms (a.k.a. genus and species) involves\nkey features of determination. Granger suggests that Aristotle\u2019s\nconception of a form/species evolves from a conjunctive conception (as\nin Topics VI.3. 140a27\u201329) to one on which differentia\nentail their associated kind/genus rather than conjunctively\nsupplementing it. Granger motivates the non-conjunctive conception on\ngrounds that \u201cAristotle clearly maintains that [...] the genus\ndoes not exist apart from its species, or exists merely as\nmatter\u201d (1984: 15); in turn, he takes this conception to\nindicate that\n\n\ngenus and differentia are best viewed in terms of determinable and\ndeterminate. [\u2026] A determinate [\u2026] is not a conjunction\nof its determinable and something else logically distinct from its\ndeterminable. (1984: 19)\n\n\nSalmieri (2008) offers further support for this interpretation, citing\nanother important feature of determination\u2014namely, that\ndeterminates differ specifically in respect of their determinable. As\nSalmieri puts it,\n\n\nCertain things are not merely other than one another\u2014as\nblue is other to both loud and\ninflation\u2014but are different from or \u201copponent\nto\u201d one another, as blue is different from\nred. (2008: 78)\n\n\nAnd he sees this distinction as operative in Aristotle\u2019s\n(Metaphysics I.3\u20134) remarks:\n\n\nBut difference (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u0300)\nand otherness (\u1f10\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) are\ndistinct (\u1f00\u0301\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf). For, while the\nother and that which it is other than are not necessarily other in\nsomething (for everything that is some being is either other or the\nsame), the different differs from something in something, so that\nit\u2019s necessary for there to be something the same in which they\ndiffer. This same thing is a kind or form; for every different thing\ndiffers either {i} in kind or {ii} in form [...]. (1054b22\u201331\ncf. 1018a9\u201315; translation quoted from Salmieri 2008, 79)\n\n\nThe previous features\u2014non-conjunctive entailment of the less by\nthe more specific, the specification\u2019s being somehow \u201cin\nrespect of\u201d the less specific, and the more specific\nfeatures\u2019 being opponent to one other\u2014are indeed\ncharacteristic features of determination, contrasting with other\nspecification relations (modulo deflationary strategies; we\nwon\u2019t always carry this qualification forward). As such, there\nis at least a case here for Salmieri\u2019s claim that \u201cwe\nought to recognise Aristotle as the originator of this\ndistinction\u201d (2008: 79).\n1.2 Early modern motivations for determination\n\nThroughout the scholastic and modern periods the genus-species and\ngenus-differentia relations are often treated in what Prior (1949)\ncalls \u201ca confused blending\u201d of the conjunct-conjunction\nand determination relations. In the modern period motivations for\ndistinguishing the latter relations become increasingly salient.\n\nOne motivation stems from Leibniz\u2019s observation that a\nconjunctive treatment of the genus-species relation does not fix a\ndirection of specification, since one can as easily take the\ndifferentia to be the genus, as vice versa (see Nouveaux\nEssais, III, iii, 10, Langley\u2019s translation, 313). Johnson\n(1924) interprets Descartes and Spinoza as attempting to ensure\nasymmetry by means of attributes and modes (see Descartes,\nPrinciples of Philosophy I.53; Spinoza, Ethics 1p8s1\nand Ep. 50), which Johnson suggests are \u201calmost\nequivalent\u201d to the notions of determinable and determinate:\n\n\nWhat I call a determinable is almost equivalent to what they call an\nattribute, and my determinate almost equivalent to their mode of an\nattribute. (1924: III, v. 1)\n\n\nPrior (1949) similarly sees Spinoza as aiming to ensure asymmetry by\nmeans of something like determination:\n\n\nIf Leibniz brought consistency into the medieval view of the\ndistinctness of genus and differentia by making the relation between\nthem symmetrical, Spinoza brought consistency into the medieval view\nof the asymmetry of the relation between them by denying their\ndistinctness. Spinoza\u2019s \u201cmodes\u201d are not new\nqualities added to his \u201cattributes\u201d, or qualities formed\nby the addition of something else to them, but determinations of them.\n(1949: 7)\n\n\nPrior also sees Locke as relying on the distinctive incompatibility of\nsame-level determinates as making sense of why \u201cany subject may\nhave of each sort of primary qualities but one particular at\nonce\u201d, and similarly for \u201call sensible ideas peculiar to\neach sense\u201d (Locke, Essay, IV iii 5).\n\nIn the work of Locke and other empiricists, we also see precursors of\ncertain contemporary anti-realist or reductivist accounts on which\ndeterminable attributions either indeterminately refer to determinate\nproperties (as Berkeley [1710] suggests, more generally, for\n\u2018abstract\u2019 terms), or on which determinable attributions\nare (merely) ways of classifying determinates. Prior\u2019s\ndescription of Locke\u2019s view might be seen as compatible with\neither approach:\n\n\nThough we speak of an object as colored, what is there being referred\nto is not really a quality of the object but a quality of one of its\nqualities; what is meant is that one of its qualities belongs to the\nclass \u201ccolors\u201d. (Prior 1949: 8\u20139)\n\n1.3 Johnson\u2019s systematic treatment of determination\n\nThe terminology of \u2018determinables\u2019 and\n\u2018determinates\u2019 as indicative of a distinctive relation is\nfirst found in Volume I, Chapter XI\u2014\u2018The\nDeterminable\u2019\u2014of W. E. Johnson\u2019s Logic\n(1921):\n\n\nI propose to call such terms as color and shape\ndeterminables in relation to such terms as red and\ncircular which will be called determinates; and, in\nintroducing this new terminology, to examine the distinction between\nthe relation of red to color and the relation of\nPlato to man \u2026. (1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nJohnson\u2019s discussion is also the first systematic attempt to\ncharacterize the key features of determinables, determinates, and\ntheir relation (see esp. 1921: 173\u2013185), though as below, he is\nnot always clear about whether these features apply to properties or\nrather to predicates. See Prior (1949) and Poli (2004) for detailed\ndiscussion of Johnson\u2019s views and his influence on later\nauthors.\n\nSome of these features are familiar, including that determination is a\nspecification relation:\n\n\nTo predicate color or shape of an object obviously characterises it\nless determinately than to predicate of it red or circular; (Johnson\n1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nthat this specification is non-conjunctive:\n\n\nthere is a genuine difference between that process of increased\ndetermination which conjunctivally introduces foreign adjectives, and\nthat other process by which without increasing, so to speak, the\nnumber of adjectives, we define them more\n determinately;[2]\n (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 3)\n\n\nthat same-level determinates are incompatible:\n\n\nif any determinate adjective characterises a given substantive, then\nit is impossible that any other determinate under the same\ndeterminable should characterise the same substantive; (Johnson 1921:\nI, xi, 4)\n\n\nand that same-level determinates are moreover\n\u201copponent\u201d:\n\n\nthe unique and peculiar kind of difference that subsists between the\nseveral determinates under the same determinable [\u2026] does not\nsubsist between any one of them and an adjective under some other\ndeterminable. (Johnson 1921: I, xi, 1)\n\n\nJohnson moreover develops these features, suggesting, for example,\nthat opponent differences often reflect that determinates are\ncomparable:\n\n\nmany determinates under the same determinable [are such] that the\ndifferences between different pairs of determinates can be compared\nwith one another [\u2026]; e.g. the difference between red and\nyellow is greater than that between red and orange. (Johnson 1921: I,\nxi, 4)\n\n\nAttention to determinate comparability leads Johnson to suggest that\ndeterminables may be determined along multiple\n\u201cdimensions\u201d:\n\n\n[A] color may vary according to its hue, brightness and saturation; so\nthat the precise determination of a color requires us to define three\nvariables which are more or less independent of one another in their\ncapacity of co-variation; but in one important sense they are not\nindependent of one another, since they could not be manifested in\nseparation. The determinate color is therefore single, though complex\n\u2026. (1921: I, xi, 4)\n\n\nThat determinables may have multiple determination dimensions is an\nimportant observation, which plays a foundational role in\nFunkhouser\u2019s (2006) model of determination (see\n \u00a73.6.1).\n\nTwo other aspects of Johnson\u2019s discussion are worth noting.\nFirst, he denies that determinables are in any sense shared by\ndeterminates: \u201cthe ground for grouping determinates under one\nand the same determinable is not any partial agreement between\nthem\u201d but rather \u201cthe special kind of difference\u201d\n(1921: I, xi, 1) distinguishing opposing\n determinates.[3]\n As we\u2019ll see, this is a choice point for contemporary accounts.\nSecond, Johnson assumes that while limits in our perceptual or\ninstrumental capabilities require that we characterize objects in\ndeterminable terms, it is nonetheless a\n\n\nuniversally adopted postulate that the characters of things which we\ncan only characterise more or less indeterminately, are, in actual\nfact, absolutely determinate. (1921: I, xi, 5)\n\n\nThe assumption that determinable characterization reflects (mere)\nepistemic, perceptual, or representational limits remains common, and\npushes towards giving one or other deflationary account of\ndeterminables. This is another choice point: on some contemporary\naccounts determinables are both real and irreducible to\ndeterminates.\n1.4 Contemporary additions and refinements\n\nIn this sub-section, we discuss certain comparatively recent\ncontributions which influentially shaped the present understanding of\ndetermination.\n\nPrior\u2019s (1949) two-part discussion of determinables and\ndeterminates is historically rich and philosophically subtle.\nInterestingly, he suggests that the difference between determinates is\nbrute, admitting no explanation:\n\n\nwe can say that the red and the blue agree in being colored, but of\ntheir difference we can only say either that their color is different,\nor that one is red and the other blue. (1949: 5\u20136)\n\n\nSome have seen this sort of statement as broadly contradictory, in\nsuggesting that what makes determinates similar (e.g., color)\nis also that in virtue of which they are different (\u201cof their\ndifference we can only say \u2026 that their color is\ndifferent\u201d);\n see \u00a73.2.\n\nPrior also considers and rejects Johnson\u2019s assumption that\ndeterminates are similar only in respect to their unique form of\ndifference, rather suggesting (c.f. Salmieri\u2019s discussion of\nAristotle, above) that determinates are similar \u201cin respect\nof\u201d that determinable:\n\n\n[I]t seems to me that determinates under the same determinable have a\nclass unity [\u2026]. Determinates under the same determinable have\nthe common relational property [\u2026] of characterising whatever\nthey do characterise in a certain respect. Redness, blueness, etc.,\nall characterise objects, as we say, \u201cin respect of their\ncolor\u201d; triangularity, squareness, etc., \u201cin respect of\ntheir shape\u201d. And this is surely quite fundamental to the notion\nof being a determinate under a determinable. (1949: 13)\n\n\nThat determinates characterize objects in respect of their\ndeterminables is indeed a key feature of determination, though there\nremains disagreement about how best to metaphysically articulate this\nfeature (e.g., as involving shared determinables or not).\n\nPrior takes this feature to push against deflationary approaches on\nwhich determinables exist, at best, merely to classify the having of\ndeterminate properties. On the contrary, he maintains, if determinates\nare unified by characterizing objects in a certain respect, then\n\n\nthe \u201crespects in which objects are to be characterised\u201d,\nto which determinable adjectives refer, are related to the objects not\nless but more intimately than the determinate qualities which\n\u201ccharacterise\u201d them. (1949: 13)\n\n\nMoving on, Searle (1959) usefully highlights that determination\nappears to contrast not just with the conjunct-conjunction relation,\nbut also with the disjunction-disjunct relation:\n\n\n[C]learly not any two terms which stand in the relation of greater to\nless specific ipso stand in the relation of determinate to\ndeterminable: \u201cyellow\u201d is in some sense more specific than\n\u201cyellow or angry\u201d but it is not a determinate of\n\u201cyellow or angry\u201d in the sense in which it is a\ndeterminate of \u201ccolor\u201d. (1959: 141\u20132)\n\n\nSearle also offers an explicit criterion of determination:\n\n\nFor any two terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(A\\) is a determinate of \\(B\\) if\nand only if \\(A\\) is a non-conjunctive specifier of \\(B\\), and \\(A\\)\nis logically related to all other non-conjunctive specifiers of \\(B\\)\n[where] any two terms are logically [i.e., conceptually] related if\neither entails the other or either entails the negation of the other.\n(1959: 148)\n\n\nInterestingly, this criterion doesn\u2019t rule out that \\(B\\) is a\ndisjunction of its determinates (\u2018non-conjunctive\nspecifiers\u2019), so long as the determinates stand in the requisite\nconceptual entailment relations. Note also that Searle moves fluidly\nbetween talk of determinable properties and talk of determinable\n\u2018terms\u2019; until recently, this sort of slide was\ncommon.\n\nSearle notes, as well, that the structure of determinables and\ndeterminates in the same family may give rise to \u201clevels\u201d\nof determinates ordered by degree of specificity; as he says,\n\u201cwe would like some way of showing that e.g., \u2018red\u2019\nand \u2018yellow\u2019 are on the same level as determinates of\n\u2018color\u2019 whereas \u2018scarlet\u2019 is on a different\nand lower level\u201d (1959: 145). Here too he offers a\ncriterion:\n\n\nTwo terms \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are same level determinates of \\(C\\) if and\nonly if they are both determinates of \\(C\\) and neither is a specifier\nof the other. (1959: 149)\n\n\n(Here the notion of a \u2018specifier\u2019 is one according to\nwhich X specifies Y iff X entails\nY, but Y does not entail X.) Seale\u2019s\ncriterion is flawed, however, since while it correctly deems\nred and yellow same-level determinates, and\ncorrectly deems red and scarlet different-level\ndeterminates, it incorrectly deems red and buttercup\nsame-level determinates.\n\nNext, Armstrong\u2019s investigations into the metaphysics of\nproperties (in, e.g., his 1978a,b, 1989, 1997, and 2010) are notable,\nfirst, in treating determination as an explicitly metaphysical\nrelation, and second, in raising to salience the important question of\nwhether determinables are ontologically reducible to determinates,\nasked against the commonly accepted background assumption that reality\nitself is maximally determinate. As we\u2019ll see, Armstrong\u2019s\nown position on this score swings from reductionism (1987) to\nnon-reductionism (1997), and back again (2010).\n\nFinally, Yablo\u2019s (1992) is notable in offering a modal account\nof (perhaps better: necessary condition on) determination as a\nrelation of asymmetric dependence, and in extending determination to\nparticulars (events) as well as properties. Since asymmetric\nnecessitation now serves as a common minimal characterization of\ndetermination, it\u2019s worth seeing how Yablo motivates this\napproach. He starts by observing a parallel between intuitive\ncharacterizations of identity and of determination, as holding between\nproperties:\n\n\n\\(P\\) is identical to \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to\nbe \\(Q\\).\n\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) iff: for a thing to be \\(P\\) is for it to be\n\\(Q\\), not simpliciter, but in a specific way.\n\n\nThe parallel is useful in suggesting that determination is, like\nidentity, a particularly intimate relation, in that determinable and\ndeterminate types and/or tokens may not be wholly distinct, and also\nin suggesting a modal treatment of determination. Hence just as the\ncharacterization of identity is illuminated by the following modal\ncondition (stemming from the principle of the indiscernibility of\nidenticals):\n\n(I) \\(P\\) is identical\nto \\(Q\\) only if: necessarily, for all \\(x\\), \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) iff\n\\(x\\) has \\(Q\\).\n\n\nso too is the characterization of determination illuminated by the\nfollowing modal condition:\n\n(D)\\(P\\) determines\n\\(Q\\) (\\(P > Q\\)) only if: (i) necessarily, for all \\(x\\), if \\(x\\)\nhas \\(P\\) then \\(x\\) has \\(Q\\); and (ii) possibly, for some \\(x\\),\n\\(x\\) has \\(Q\\) but lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nThe parallel also suggests that an account of determination\nneedn\u2019t impose conditions on conceptual entailment relations (as\nSearle\u2019s did): just as Kripke\u2019s (1980) results undermine\nthe need for a conceptual entailment requirement on identity (e.g.,\nwater might be identical with H\\(_2\\)O even if \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018H\\(_2\\)O\u2019 don\u2019t conceptually entail each other),\n\u201cwe should discount the traditional doctrine\u2019s conceptual\ncomponent and reconceive determination in wholly metaphysical\nterms\u201d (Yablo 1992: 253). That said, as Yablo admits, asymmetric\nnecessitation alone is insufficient to characterize determination\n(since, e.g., allowing conjunctions to determine their conjuncts). We\nwill later consider various ways of filling in the modal condition,\nincluding Yablo\u2019s own essence-based approach\n (\u00a73.5.1).\n\nYablo\u2019s discussion is also notable in highlighting an important\nseeming feature of determinables and determinates, according to which\nthey do not causally compete:\n\n\n[No causal exclusion principle can] apply to determinates and their\ndeterminables\u2014for we know that they are not causal rivals.\n[\u2026] any credible reconstruction of the exclusion principle must\nrespect the truism that determinates do not contend with their\ndeterminables for causal influence. (1992: 259)\n\n\nThis feature is key to a recently popular strategy for solving the\nproblem of mental (and more generally, higher-level)\ncausation\u2014an intriguing application which raised to salience the\npotential usefulness of determination for metaphysical and other\nphilosophical purposes (see \u00a75.2).\n2. Features and ontological categories\n2.1 Features\n\nWe are now in position to list the features commonly taken to\ncharacterize determinables, determinates, and their\n relation;[4]\n the presentation is in terms of properties, and may require\nadjustment to apply to entities of other categories\n (see \u00a72.2).\n This is not a minimal or axiomatic set: some features follow from\nothers; moreover, there are cases to be made that some of these\nfeatures do not hold in full generality. In addition, how to\nmetaphysically understand these features varies, in ways we will\ndiscuss down the line.\n\n\n\nIncreased specificity: If \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n(\u2018determines\u2019) \\(Q\\), then to be \\(P\\) is to be \\(Q\\), in\na specific way.\n\nDetermination relates properties that are more or less specific,\nrelative to each other. For example, red is a determinate of\ncolor; scarlet is a determinate of red. \n\n\nIrreflexivity, Asymmetry, Transitivity: For\nno \\(P\\) does \\(P\\) determine \\(P\\); if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), then\n\\(Q\\) does not determine \\(P\\); if \\(R\\) determines \\(P\\), and \\(P\\)\ndetermines \\(Q\\), then \\(R\\) determines \\(Q\\).\n\nThese features, characteristic of strict partial orderings, follow\njust from Increased specificity. For example,\nscarlet does not determine itself, since no property can be\nmore specific than itself. If scarlet determines\nred, then red does not determine scarlet,\nsince red cannot be both less and more specific than\nscarlet. And if to be scarlet is to be red, in a\nspecific way, and to be red is to be colored, in a specific\nway, then to be scarlet is to be a yet more specific way of\nbeing colored, such that scarlet determines\ncolor. \n\n\nRelative, leveled determination: Except for minimally\nspecific determinables and maximally specific determinates, a\nproperty\u2019s characterization as determinable or determinate is\nrelative. Relatedly, determinables can be determined at different\n\u2018levels\u2019 of specificity.\n\nFor example, red is a determinate of color, but a\ndeterminable of scarlet; red, blue, and\nyellow determine color at one level of\nspecification; scarlet, navy, and buttercup\ndetermine color at another (more finely grained) level of\nspecification. \n\n\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables: If\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), \\(P\\) is more specific than \\(Q\\) in respect\nof \\(Q\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates is, more\nspecifically, \u2018in respect of\u2019 the\n determinable.[5]\n For example, if red determines color, red\nis more specific than color in respect of color.\nDetermination in respect of a determinable is sometimes further\nexplicated as involving specification along one or more\n\u2018determination dimensions\u2019 of the determinable\u2014for\nexample, the determination dimensions of color are commonly\nsupposed to be hue, saturation, and\nbrightness. \n\n\nDeterminate similarity/comparability: If \\(P\\) and \\(R\\) are\ndifferent same-level determinates of a determinable \\(Q\\), then \\(P\\)\nand \\(R\\) are similar, and moreover comparable, in respect of\n\\(Q\\).\n\nThat determination is \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables gives\nrise to similarity and systematic comparability relations among\ndeterminates. For example, determinates of\ncolor\u2014red, blue, orange,\netc.\u2014are all similar in being colors, and any two colors are\ncomparable in this respect: red is more similar to\norange than to blue in respect of color,\nand so on. \n\n\nNon-conjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(P\\) is not identical with any conjunctive property conjoining\n\\(Q\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(Q\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve conjoining or otherwise combining the determinable with\nanother property independent of the determinable. For example,\nred is not appropriately understood as the conjunction of\ncolor and another property independent of color.\n\n\n\nNon-disjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(Q\\) is not identical with any disjunctive property disjoining\n\\(P\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(P\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve disjunctive elimination. For example, color is not a\ndisjunction of red and some other property or properties\nindependent of red. \n\n\nDeterminable inheritance: For every determinable \\(Q\\) of a\ndeterminate \\(P\\): if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) at a time \\(t\\) then \\(x\\) must\nhave \\(Q\\) at \\(t\\).\n\nObjects must have every determinable of any determinates they have.\nFor example, if something is scarlet, then it must also be both red\nand colored. \n\n\nRequisite determination: If \\(x\\) has a determinable \\(Q\\) at\na time \\(t\\), then for every level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(Q\\):\n\\(x\\) must have some \\(L\\)-level determinate \\(P\\) of \\(Q\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\nObjects must have a determinate of every determinable they have. For\nexample, if something is colored, then it must be some specific color\n(e.g., red), and if something is red, then it must be some specific\nshade of red (e.g., scarlet). \n\n\nMultiple determinates: For every determinate \\(P\\) of a\ndeterminable \\(Q\\), there is a determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) that is\ndistinct from, but at the same level of specificity as, \\(P\\).\n\nWith determinate specificity comes multiplicity or diversity. For\nexample, color has multiple determinates (red,\nblue, yellow, and so on); red has multiple\ndeterminates (scarlet, crimson, burgundy,\nand so on). \n\n\nDeterminate incompatibility: If \\(x\\) has determinate \\(P\\)\nof determinable \\(Q\\) at time \\(t\\), then \\(x\\) cannot have, at \\(t\\),\nany other determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) at the same level of specificity\nas \\(P\\).\n\nFor example, an object cannot be both red and blue\nall over, at a\n time.[6]\n Determinate incompatibility is moreover \u2018opponent\u2019 in\nthat same-level determinates are exclusive\n alternatives.[7]\n\n\n\nUnique determination: If \\(x\\) has a determinable \\(Q\\) at a\ntime, then \\(x\\) has a unique\u2014one and only one\u2014determinate\n\\(P\\) at any given level of specification at that time.\n\nUnique determination is entailed by Requisite\ndetermination and Determinate incompatibility. \n\n\nAsymmetric modal dependence: if \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n\\(Q\\), then if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) then \\(x\\) must have \\(Q\\), but for\nsome \\(y\\), \\(y\\) might have \\(Q\\) without having \\(P\\).\n\nFor example, anything that is scarlet must be red, but something might\nbe red without being scarlet (it might rather be, e.g., burgundy).\nAsymmetric modal dependence is entailed by Determinable\ninheritance, Requisite determination, and Multiple\ndeterminates. \n\n\nCausal compatibility: Determinables and determinates do not\ncausally compete.\n\nFor example, if a given patch is both red and\nscarlet, there is no in-principle difficulty with both\nred and scarlet being causally efficacious\nvis-\u00e1-vis the pecking of a pigeon trained to peck at\nany red patch. \n\n\nMotivated as they are by a limited range of paradigm cases, not all of\nthese features may be characteristic of determination in the strong\nsense of being required for the holding of that relation, as opposed\nto being typically or generally true of some or most instances of the\nrelation (or its relata).\n\nFor example, counterexamples have been offered to Determinate\nincompatibility (hence Unique determination). Johansson\n(2004) notes that if property is a determinable, then\nDeterminate incompatibility will fail, noting that on this\nscore \u201cJohnson [\u2026] generalized too quickly\u201d (2004:\n117); what is rather true is that \u201cfor some ontological\ndeterminables [\u2026] two determinates cannot possibly exist in the\nsame space-time region\u201d (2004: 118). Determinable odors, tastes,\nand sounds also appear to have (some) compatible determinates; as\nArmstrong (1978b) observes, \u201ca sauce may be both sour and sweet.\nA bell may have a tone which is composed of both a fundamental and a\nnumber of higher overtones\u201d (113; see also Fales 1990, Sanford\n2014, and Massin 2013).\n\nIt may also be questioned whether all determinates of determinables\ncan be systematically compared, as per Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability. It is unclear, for example, whether\nbeing pentagonal is more or less similar in respect of\nshape to being square or being sextagonal.\nIt is also unclear whether all determinates of smell admit of\nsystematic comparability (is the smell of pine more similar to the\nsmell of rose or of violet?), though recent empirical work identifying\nthe dimensions of \u201csmell space\u201d (see, e.g., Mamlouk &\nMartinetz 2004) may reveal an underlying structure of the sort\n(appealing to hue, saturation, and brightness) that serves as an\nunderlying basis for ordering determinate colors (which work might\nalso bear upon Armstrong\u2019s observations, above). The question of\nwhether all determinables may be systematically ordered with respect\nto their determinables, either explicitly or implicitly, matters to\nwhether determinate/determinable relations can be modeled in spatial\nterms along lines proposed by Funkhouser (2006)\n (see \u00a73.6.1).\n\nUnique determination and Requisite determination may\nalso admit of exceptions. One might maintain (see Wilson 2013) that\neven for paradigmatic determinables such as color, Unique\ndetermination is not generally correct, since the case of an\niridescent feather admits of a reasonable interpretation according to\nwhich the feather is (a) colored, (b) red from one perspective, and\n(c) blue from another perspective, such that no one determinate shade\nis non-arbitrarily identified as \u201cthe\u201d unique determinate\ndetermining the determinable color had by the feather; in\nsuch a case, the determinates are had, at best, in relativized\n fashion.[8]\n Fales observes that Requisite determination\n\n\nappears to admit of exceptions in the case of certain objects of\nmental acts: for example, as regards the number of spots on an\nimagined or a hallucinated speckled hen. (1990: 167)\n\n\nQuantum mechanics and the associated natural treatment of observables\nas determinables also offers apparent counterexamples to\nUnique and Requisite determination, associated with\nincompatible observables (so that if position is determinate,\nmomentum is not; see, e.g., Bokulich 2014: 463), and more\ngenerally cases of value indeterminacy\n (see \u00a75.3).\n Relatedly, certain understandings of vagueness or indeterminacy\ninvolve the rejection of Unique and Requisite\ndetermination. Rosen and Smith (2004) suggest that vagueness may\ninvolve an object\u2019s having a determinable without determinately\nhaving any corresponding determinate, and Wilson (2013) offers a\ndeterminable-based account of metaphysical indeterminacy as\ncharacteristically involving an entity (object, system) having a\ndeterminable but no unique determinate of the determinable, due either\nto there being too many candidate determinates (\u2018glutty\u2019\nindeterminacy) or too few (\u2018gappy\u2019 indeterminacy); the\nlatter determinable-based account has been applied to value\nindeterminacy in quantum mechanics\n (see \u00a75.3).\n The connection between the determinable position and\ntheories of location may also push against Unique and\nRequisite determination, insofar as the latter principles\ncorrespond to certain principles of location which are frequently\nasserted to be subject to counterexamples involving, e.g., gunky\nworlds, where an object may have a location but no exact location (see\nCalosi 2019).\n\nFinally, as we will see in\n \u00a73.4,\n a standard reductive approach to determinables takes these to be\ndisjunctive properties having associated determinates as disjuncts\n(see, e.g., Clapp 2001, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, Dosanjh 2021);\ndisjunctive reductionists uniformly reject Non-disjunctive\nspecification as ever true of determination or its relata. Here\nit is also worth noting that a common motivation for anti-realist or\nreductionist approaches involves the supposition that, contra\nCausal compatibility, determinables and determinates do\ncausally compete.\n2.2 Ontological categories: bearers and relata\n\nThough paradigm cases of determination (involving color,\nshape, mass, and so on) appear to hold between\nmonadic property types, it is straightforward to extend the notion to\nrelations, as in suggestions (see Mellor 1998 and French 2014) that\nlaws of nature are or are constituted by determinable relations\n (see \u00a75.1).\n Hence Johansson says that while the restriction to monadic types is\n\u2018traditional\u2019,\n\n\nI do not think there are any good reasons for the restriction.\n[\u2026] Relational concepts, just like property concepts, can be\nfitted into determinable-determinate trees. (2000: 117)\n\n\nGiven that determinables are properties (including relations), the\nquestion (what Meinertsen [2021] dubs \u201cMellor\u2019s\nquestion\u201d, following discussion in Mellor [1995], Ch. 16) arises\nof what determinables are properties of. It is commonly assumed that\ndeterminables, like determinates, are properties of particulars (and\nmoreover, of the same particular\u2014though certain applications of\ndetermination may depart from this assumption;\n see \u00a75.3),\n such that, e.g., the table is shaped as well as rectangular. But it\nhas also been maintained that determinables are second-order\nproperties\u2014that is, properties of associated determinates (see\nMellor 1995: 208; for a precursor see Prior 1949). See Meinertsen 2021\nfor a pro-particularist comparative assessment.\n\nMore controversially, determination has been taken to hold between\nentities of ontological (including representational) categories going\nbeyond properties and relations.\n\nTo start, as above, historical discussion of determinables and\ndeterminates (in, e.g., Johnson 1921) moves fairly freely between talk\nof these as representational (linguistic/conceptual) and as\nmetaphysical. In some such cases, the target is plausibly a properly\nmetaphysical\n distinction.[9]\n In other cases\u2014e.g., in empiricist treatments\u2014the\ncharacterization of determination in representational terms is clearly\nintended to be metaphysically deflationary. We will later revisit\nreasons for and against taking determinables or determination at\nmetaphysical face value\n (\u00a73.1,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nModulo deflationary concerns, there does not appear to be any\nin-principle barrier to allowing that determination can hold between\nentities of other\n categories.[10]\n Determination has been extended to actions or episodes (see, e.g.,\nMulligan 1992 and Cruse 1995: Ch. 6), events (Yablo 1992), fields (von\nWachter 2000), tropes (Funkhouser 2006), states (Fine 2011), and\nsubstances (Massin 2013). That said, one might maintain (either on\ngrounds of systematicity or parsimony, or as reflecting independent\ncommitment to a view of determinables as properties, as above) that\ndetermination as holding between entities of other categories is\nultimately a matter of these falling under or being partly constituted\nby determinable and determinate properties. Whatever one\u2019s\nposition on which ontological categories the relata of determination\ncan fall under, there are (as per metaphysical usual) different\navailable understandings of the categories at\n issue.[11]\n\nAnother question pertaining to ontological categories concerns whether\nsome or all specification relations are themselves determinates of a\nmore general relation determinable (see Johansson 2000: sec. 8 for\nendorsement of such a view).\n3. Contemporary accounts of determinables and determinates\n\nWe turn now to canvassing contemporary accounts of determinables,\ndeterminates, and their relation. The main varieties of contemporary\nontological accounts include anti-realist accounts, on which\ndeterminables do not exist; reductive accounts, on which determinables\nexist but are metaphysically reducible to (that is, identical with)\nsome or other construction of determinates; and non-reductive\naccounts, on which determinables exist and are not metaphysically\nreducible to any construction of determinates. Non-reductive accounts\nfurthermore split into versions on which determinables are (always)\nless fundamental than associated determinates, and accounts on which\ndeterminables can be as fundamental as, or even more fundamental than,\ndeterminates; we reserve treatment of this further issue for\n \u00a74.\n A different sort of contemporary account is directed not so much at\nthe ontological question(s) as at elucidating certain structural or\nbroadly logical aspects of determination or associated relata.\n\nAs background for the ontological accounts to come, we start with a\nnumber of considerations commonly offered as providing prima facie\nsupport for taking determinables to exist, and to moreover be\nontologically irreducible to (again: not identical to any construction\nof) determinates. We then consider some preliminary motivations for\ndeflationary (anti-realist or reductive) treatments of determinables.\nOne might wonder whether the motivations for taking determinables to\nexist might be presented independently of the motivations for taking\ndeterminables to be irreducible; this proves difficult, however, for\nthere typically isn\u2019t enough daylight between the initial\nmotivations for existence and for irreducibility to prise them apart.\nThe presentation thus reflects that the motivations for reducibility\n(or for anti-realism) come later, as pushing against taking the prima\nfacie appearances of irreducible determinables at face value.\n3.1 Preliminary motivations for the existence and irreducibility of determinables\n\nThere are perceptual, scientific, causal, semantic, and metaphysical\nconsiderations weighing in prima facie favor of determinables\u2019\nexisting and moreover being metaphysically irreducible to\ndeterminates. Again, these motivations are preliminary; as we\u2019ll\nsee down the line, anti-realists and reductionists take there to be\ngood reasons to resist taking the seeming appearances of existence\nand/or irreducibility at face value\n (see \u00a73.2).\n3.1.1 Determinables as perceived\n\nPerception provides one source of prima facie support for there being\nirreducible determinables. The best such motivations are indirect,\nsince bare claims that we can perceive determinables as distinct from\ndeterminates are\n disputable.[12]\n One such indirect motivation appeals to Sorites phenomena as\nindicating that we fail to perceive fully determinate instances of\nmany properties, including colors, tones, and textures. As Fales puts\nit:\n\n\n[This] is a conclusion which seems forced upon us by the fact that\neach member of a series of colors, etc., may be perceptually\nindistinguishable from its immediate neighbors but easily\ndistinguishable from more distant members of the series. (1990:\n 172)[13]\n\n\nSuch a conclusion supports not just the existence but also the\nirreducibility of determinables, since candidate reductions of\ndeterminables (to, e.g., disjunctions of associated determinates)\nappear to entail that any instance of a determinable is in fact an\ninstance of a (say, disjunct) determinate; but in that case\nneighbouring patches in a Sorites series would be perceptually\ndistinguishable, which they aren\u2019t.\n\nA second indirect perceptual motivation for irreducible determinables\nreflects that our perception of macro-objects typically fails to\nregister micro-determinate details. For example, shape is a\nparadigmatic determinable, but we do not perceive the shapes of trees,\ntables, and the like, in fully determinate microscopic detail (see\nHellie 2005, Stazicker 2016). In re this and the Sorites motivation,\nit is worth noting that even if perceived objects are themselves\nmaximally determinate, perceptual experience may still motivate\nirreducible determinables. As Wilson observes:\n\n\nPerhaps the (instances of) properties perceived are really maximally\ndeterminate, and only perceptual features or modes of presentation are\ndeterminable; but features of perceptual experience are also aspects\nof reality, so the larger point remains. (2012: 5)\n\n\nA third indirect perceptual motivation for irreducible determinables\nis that these best explain our being able to perceive that different\ndeterminates are similar in the relevant determinable respect. Hence\nFales suggests that since we are able \u201cto notice or be aware\nof\u201d the similarity between different shades of red, \u201cit\nseems clear that red is observable every time we observe an instance\nof a shade of red, even though it is not separable from that shade,\nbut is in the shade\u201d (1990: 172).\n3.1.2 Determinables as scientific posits\n\nBoth fundamental physical and special-scientific posits and laws\nappear to be characterized, at least in part, in determinable terms.\nAs Armstrong (1997) and French (2014) observe, it is natural to see\nfundamental physical laws as relating determinables, such as mass and\ncharge, or to themselves be determinable\n relations.[14]\n Special science laws are also naturally seen as involving features\nwhich are determinable in not being maximally precise; for example,\nthe features of aggregates relevant to thermodynamics and statistical\nmechanics average over features of the lower-level entities composing\nthe aggregate, and morphological and physiological features of plants\nand animals are characterized in determinable or functional terms,\nagain abstracting from micro-physical details. Relatedly, that special\nscience features abstract from micro-physical details enters into\nvarious arguments for these being irreducible (see, e.g., Batterman\n1998, Wilson 2010). More generally, the posit of existing and\nirreducible determinables in both fundamental and special sciences is\nin line with a principle of explanation pervasive in the sciences,\naccording to which good explanations do not cite unnecessary details\n(see, e.g., Strevens\n 2004).[15]\n3.1.3 Determinables as causally unspecific\n\nDeterminables appear to be causally unspecific, in having fewer\npowers\u2014in being able to contribute to causing fewer effects, in\nthe circumstances\u2014than their associated determinates. For\nexample, red has the power to get Sophie the pigeon, who\npecks at any red thing, to peck; but red doesn\u2019t have\nthe power to get Sophie\u2019s picky cousin Alice, who pecks only at\nscarlet patches, to peck; for a red patch might be not scarlet, but\nsome other shade of red\u2014say, burgundy (see Yablo 1992, Wilson\n1999, and Shoemaker 2001). Such a lack of causal specificity, combined\nwith a principle of individuation of scientific properties according\nto which they are (perhaps only contingently) distinguished by\ndifferent sets of powers, has been taken to support not just the\nexistence but the irreducibility of determinable features. For\nexample, since instances of disjunctive properties are identical to\ninstances of their disjuncts, reducing determinables to disjunctions\nof associated determinates would render determinable instances as\ncausally specific as determinate instances, and so fail to accommodate\nthe seeming causal unspecificity of determinables.\n3.1.4 Determinables as semantic referents\n\nOn a simple and in some sense default semantics, a sentence of the\nform \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u2019 is true just in case the entity\npicked out by \\(a\\) has the property picked out by \\(F\\). Hence if\n\u2018This ruby is red\u2019 is true then on the default semantics\nthe predicate \u2018red\u2019 refers to the determinable\nred. Irreducibility might moreover be motivated (see Rosen\n2010:128) by noting that a speaker may be competent with a\ndeterminable predicate without being familiar with all the associated\ndeterminates (as reductions of determinables to logical constructions\nof determinates might be thought to require).\n3.1.5 Determinables as a basis for similarity among determinates\n\nAs previously, one motivation for determinables is as providing a\nmetaphysical basis for perceived similarity among determinates\n(Johansson 2000). More generally, determinables may be considered\n\u2018natural\u2019 in the \u2018joint-carving\u2019 sense of\nLewis (1983) in virtue of providing a non-gerrymandered basis for\nobjective similarity among determinates (Wilson 2012).\n\nAgain, each of the motivations in (3.1.1) \u2013 (3.1.5) is\npreliminary. If the seeming appearance of there being irreducible\ndeterminables can be defended against objections, however, the\nphilosophical work these can do in encoding distinctively unspecific\naspects of reality (as per the applications in\n \u00a75)\n would constitute additional positive support for their posit.\n3.2 Preliminary motivations against the existence or irreducibility of determinables\n\nThe main preliminary motivations against determinables existing or\nbeing metaphysically irreducible to determinates reflect concerns that\nsuch determinables would be unparsimonious, give rise to causal\noverdetermination, and/or violate the supposition that reality is\nultimately or fundamentally maximally determinate. These concerns and\nassociated support for anti-realist (\u2018eliminativist\u2019) or\nrealist reductionist accounts are similar to those sometimes brought\nto bear against irreducible higher-level (e.g., special scientific)\ngoings-on. Here again, the motivations are preliminary; as we\u2019ll\nsee down the line, realists offer various responses to these\nconcerns.\n\n3.2.1 Reality as maximally determinate\n\nOne objection to irreducible determinables appeals to the supposition\nthat reality itself is maximally determinate, such that there are no\nirreducible determinable properties; as Armstrong maintains,\n\u201c[a]ll universals must be determinate\u201d (1978b: 117).\nRelatedly, many suppose that there is no \u201cvagueness\u201d in\nthe world; as Lewis maintains, \u201c[t]he only intelligible account\nof vagueness locates it in our thought and language\u201d (1986:\n 212).[16]\n\n3.2.2 Determinables as failing to track exact\nsimilarity\n\nAnother objection to irreducible determinables is that they could not\ndo the work of explaining exact similarity (in a given respect)\nbetween objects. Hence Armstrong takes \u201cthe powerful truism that\nuniversals are strictly identical in their distinct\ninstantiations\u201d to support the claim that \u201cproperties that\nare lowest determinates [\u2026] are good candidates for being\nuniversals\u201d (1997: 49). More weakly, one might maintain that the\nbest reason for positing properties, however understood, is as\nexplaining exact similarity (in a given respect) between objects.\nSupposing so, one might moreover maintain that only determinates\nexist, on grounds that particulars having determinable properties\nmight fail to exactly resemble in determinate respects (e.g., red\nobjects might be different shades of\n red).[17]\n\n3.2.3 Determinables as ontologically or causally\nredundant\n\nIrreducible determinables have been taken to be ontologically and\ncausally redundant, since determinates which we have independent\nreason to posit can explain or do anything that determinables\npurportedly explain or do. Hence Massin (2013) maintains against\nJohansson (2000) that perceived inexact resemblances between\ndeterminates can explain the \u201cseen unity of the determinate\ncolors\u201d, and Gillett and Rives maintain that determinables are\ncausally unnecessary:\n\n\n[P]ositing instances of determinate properties offers the best\nexplanation for the causal relations we observe in the world\n[\u2026] Should we also accept that there are instances of\ndeterminable properties corresponding to predicates such as \u2018is\ncolored\u2019 or \u2018is charged\u2019? [\u2026] There is a\nclear concern that it is ontologically profligate to take two\nproperties to be contributing causal powers, a determinable and its\ndeterminate, where one, the determinate, would apparently suffice.\n(2005: 487)\n\n\nHeil (2003) levels similar complaints.\n\n3.2.4 Determinables as inducing causal\noverdetermination\n\nRelated to the concern about causal redundancy is the concern that\nirreducible broadly scientific determinables induce problematic causal\noverdetermination (see again Heil 2003 and Gillett and Rives 2005). To\nstart, if such determinables exist, they need to earn their causal\n keep.[18]\n But following the concern about causal redundancy, determinables\nsimply reproduce the powers of their determinates, allowing instances\nof distinct properties to give rise to the same effect on a given\noccasion. And while such overdetermination sometimes occurs, as in\nfiring squad or double-rock-throw cases, this is not the right model\nfor determinables and\n determinates.[19]\n\n3.2.5 Determinables as incoherent\n\nAnother objection to determinables is that they are in some sense\nincoherent. Armstrong (1978a: 106\u20137, 117\u201318) maintains\nthis on grounds that determinables are supposed to constitute the\nrespect in which associated determinates are both similar and\ndissimilar, so that, e.g., red and yellow are\nsupposed to be both similar and different in respect of\ncolour (see Elder 1996: 151 for\n discussion).[20]\n Fales (1990: 174) sees the objection as incorrectly presupposing that\ndeterminables are second-order properties of or relations between\ndeterminates. Massin (2013) takes the objection to depend on whether\nthe similarity at issue is exact or inexact; if inexact, there is no\nproblem (\u201c[t]wo things that are imperfectly similar in their\ncolour can be imperfectly dissimilar in their colour\u201d) but if\nexact\u2014reflecting, e.g., determinables\u2019 being exactly\nsimilar constituents of determinates\u2014then incoherence follows,\nsince differences between determinates must be explained by what\n\u201cremains\u201d once the shared determinable is removed, but we\ncannot make sense of such removal.\n3.3 Anti-realist accounts\n\nWhile motivated by the previous concerns, anti-realists about\ndeterminables also aim to explain or explain away (or\n\u201cdebunk\u201d) at least some seeming motivations for\ndeterminables. A common debunking strategy appeals to something like\nBerkeley\u2019s (1710) claim that it is a mistake to suppose that\ngeneral terms denote abstract\n ideas.[21]\n For example, Heil (2003) echoes Berkeley\u2019s claim, taking\nseeming semantic reasons for positing determinables to reflect an\nuncritical tendency to suppose that \u201cwe can \u2018read\noff\u2019 features of reality from our ways of speaking about\nit\u201d (207), such that even if, e.g., the predicate \u2018is\nred\u2019 truly applies to some objects (tomatoes, apples, rubies) we\nshould not take this to be in virtue of their possessing the\n\u201cvery same property\u201d.\n\nAt least five positive anti-realist accounts of determinable terms or\nconcepts and their function are available. First is an account on\nwhich general terms/concepts indeterminately refer to determinate\nfeatures\u2014here, generality is placed in language or mind, rather\nthan world (see Berkeley\n 1710).[22]\n Second is a pragmatic account, on which the function of determinable\nterms reflects that we happen to have perceptual systems suited for\ntracking certain inexact similarities between objects having\n(ultimately highly complex) determinate properties (see Heil 2003).\nThat the \u2018work\u2019 determinable terms do consists in tracking\ninexact similarities between objects or determinates is also a theme\nin the remaining anti-realist accounts. Third is an account on which\ndeterminable terms are higher-order predicates of determinate\npredicates (see Searle\n 1959).[23]\n Fourth is an account on which determinable predicates are names of\nclasses of properties. Hence Mill maintains that determinable terms\nare\n\n\nnames not of one single and definite attribute, but of a class of\nattributes. Such is the word color, which is a name common to\nwhiteness, redness, etc. (1843/1973: I.ii.5)\n\n\nFifth is an account on which to have a determinable is just to have\none of the associated determinates. Hence Armstrong maintains that\n\n\nFor a particular to \u201cinstantiate\u201d a determinable is\n[\u2026] for it to instantiate just one of a class of\nuniversals\u2019 [\u2026] having the determinable property entails\nno more than having one of the determinate properties. (1997: 53; see\nalso Armstrong 1978)\n\n\nOne concern with anti-realist accounts has to do with the source of\nclassification of determinates under a determinable term or concept.\nAs above, this is usually taken to involve inexact resemblance, but if\ninexact resemblance is primitive, then objections of the sort leveled\nagainst resemblance nominalist treatments of inexact resemblance may\narise, mutatis mutandis\u2014notably, that differentially\nresembling pairs will themselves stand in second-order or higher\nprimitive resemblance relations, giving rise to regress (see Fales\n1990: 117\u201320 for discussion, and Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002: Ch. 6\nfor a response). An alternative means of classification of\ndeterminates appeals to \u201cnaturalness\u201d (as per Lewis 1983)\nas a primitive predicate or property binding determinates into\nclasses, but this approach, it might be complained, is not clearly\nexplanatory. Perhaps the most developed deflationary account of\ndeterminate classification is Armstrong\u2019s, on which \u201cthe\nresemblance of determinate universals is constituted by partial\nidentity, where the greater the resemblance the greater degree of\nidentity\u201d (1997: 51), such that, for example, determinate\nlengths resemble in virtue of sharing unit length\n universals.[24]\n Armstrong argues that his account makes sense of various features of\ndetermination: Determinate incompatibility is accommodated\nsince, e.g., an object\u2019s length cannot be identical to different\nsums of unit lengths; Determinate similarity/comparability is\naccommodated since different determinate lengths share some but not\nall unit lengths; Asymmetric modal dependence is accommodated\nsince specific sums of unit lengths entail the having of length, but\nnot vice versa. It has been complained, however, that such an\naccount cannot handle the full range of\n cases.[25]\n\nA second concern is that the presupposition that all properties are\nultimately maximally determinate violates certain possible and\npotentially actual conceptions of natural reality. For example, if\nobjects fill space, and space is both continuous and gunky (i.e., such\nthat every entity has proper parts), then the shapes and locations of\nobjects will be indefinitely subject to further determination (see\nSalmieri 2008: 78,\n n47).[26]\n And certain interpretations of quantum mechanics\n (see \u00a75.3\n for further discussion) and certain field-theoretic understandings of\nfundamental particles as having infinitely extensible boundaries\n(reflecting these particles\u2019 being constituted by long-range\ninteractions) suggest that natural reality is to some extent\nirreducibly determinable.\n\nA third and related concern is that it is unclear how the\neliminativist can accommodate (or debunk) all the motivations for\ndeterminables. It remains unclear, for example, how to explain Sorites\nphenomena if all properties\u2014including perceptual modes of\npresentation\u2014are maximally determinate.\n3.4 Reductionist accounts\n\nReductionists take determinables to exist but to be reducible to\ndeterminates\u2014that is, to be identical to classes or broadly\nlogical constructions of (ultimately maximal) determinates.\n3.4.1 Disjunctive reductionism\n\nThe most common reductionist strategy takes determinables to be\nidentical to disjunctions of (ultimately maximal) determinates (see,\ne.g., Clapp 2001; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002; Antony\n 2003;[27]\n Massin 2013, and Dosanjh 2021). On this view, for example,\ncolor is identical to a disjunctive property having every\nmaximally specific color shade as a disjunct.\n\nDisjunctivism explains several features of determination:\nRequisite determination is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunction requires the instancing of a disjunct;\nDeterminable inheritance is accommodated since the instancing\nof a disjunct entails the instancing of any associated disjunctions\n(see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, Massin 2013); Causal\ncompatibility is accommodated via the identity of determinable\n(disjunctive) and determinate (disjunct) instances (see Clapp 2001).\nAnd while disjunctivism violates Non-disjunctive\nspecification, disjunctivists preserve some contrast by\nstipulating that determinables are a special sub-class of the class of\ndisjunctive properties\u2014ones having resembling determinates as\ndisjuncts (see Clapp 2001; Dosanjh 2021) or which are projectible in\nGoodman\u2019s (1983) sense (see Antony 2002). Other stipulations may\nbe required to accommodate Determinate incompatibility,\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables, and\nUnique determination.\n\nThree concerns face disjunctivist accounts, besides concerns that the\nrequired stipulations are unexplanatory, and that reality may not be\n(ultimately, entirely) maximally determinate. The first reflects\nreasons for rejecting disjunctive properties. One such\nreason\u2014namely, Armstrong\u2019s concern that \u201cdisjunctive\nproperties offend against the principle that a genuine property is\nidentical in its different particulars\u201d (1978a: 20)\u2014may be\nput aside if the disjuncts at issue are genuinely resembling, as\nproponents of disjunctivism suppose. This response will not, however,\nsatisfy those taking disjunctions to be mere logical constructions,\nwith no metaphysical import.\n\nThe second concern is that taking the disjuncts identified with\ndeterminates to be genuinely resembling, as is needed in order to\nanswer Armstrong\u2019s concern and to provide an alternative basis\nfor the contrast flagged in Non-disjunctive specification,\nwill open the door to looking for a source of the supposed\ncommonality, which source might well end up being an irreducible\ndeterminable. Here again the question of how best to treat the inexact\nresemblance between determinates is pressing.\n\nThe third concern is that a disjunctive account cannot accommodate\ncertain prima facie motivations for determinables as present in\nperception and thought. To start, if determinables are disjunctions of\nmaximal determinates, then every instance of a determinable is an\ninstance of a maximal determinate; but Sorites phenomena and our\nfailure to perceive micro-determinate shapes of macro-objects seem\nprecisely to indicate that some instances of determinables in\nperception are not maximally determinate. Relatedly (as above), Rosen\nsuggests that a disjunctivist approach imposes implausibly strong\nconditions on competence with determinable terms or concepts, contra a\ncase in which someone familiar with many shades of blue has no\nconception of cerulean (indeed, is perhaps even incapable of\nthinking of this shade), but where this deficit \u201cwould not\nprevent him from being competent with the word \u2018blue\u2019, or\nfrom knowing a great deal about the color blue\u201d (2010: 128).\n3.4.2 Relational accounts\n\nOn a relational account of the sort advocated by Bigelow and Pargetter\n(1990), what it is for determinates to fall under a common\ndeterminable is for the determinates to instantiate second-degree\nrelations of difference from one another, and for pairs of these\ndifferences to in turn instantiate third-degree proportions\n(58\u201362). Bigelow and Pargetter motivate a relational account as\nexplaining both why determinates are similar and why they differ.\nIrreducible determinables are insufficient unto this task, they\nmaintain, on grounds, first, that taking determinables to be\nirreducibly distinct from but necessarily accompanied by determinates\nintroduces unexplained necessary connections (1990: 118), and second,\nthat determinables alone don\u2019t explain differences between\ndeterminates (1990: 54, 58; see also Armstrong 1978b: 113).\n\nBesides the usual concerns with reductive accounts, two concerns\nattach to a relational account. The first is that attention to the way\nin which determinates differ doesn\u2019t in itself serve to\ncharacterize the way in which determinates resemble. As Elder puts\nit,\n\n\nalthough properties such as being blue or rich or stabbingly painful\ndo come in different degrees or intensities, there is more that is\ncommon to the various precise \u201cvalues\u201d of these properties\nthan just that they differ from one another in graduated ways. (1996:\n155)\n\n\nThe second is that, as Elder also observes, from the metaphysical\nirreducibility of determinables to determinates, it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that their necessary connection is mysterious: if\n\n\nthe various determinates [\u2026] each embodies the same property as\nthe others [\u2026] it is hard to see any great mystery in the fact\nthat possession of any one of these determinate shades necessarily\ngoes with possession of the relevant determinable. (1996: 157)\n\n\nAlso worth noting is that concerns about necessary connections\ntypically arise from acceptance of Hume\u2019s Dictum, according to\nwhich there are no metaphysically necessary connections between\ndistinct existences; but post-empiricist motivations for believing\nthis principle are unclear (see MacBride 2005 and Wilson 2010).\n3.5 Non-reductive accounts\n\nWe turn now to accounts on which determinables are taken to\nirreducibly exist. These accounts are typically implemented under the\nassumption that determinables are less fundamental than\u2014are\nmetaphysically posterior to\u2014determinates. In\n \u00a74\n we\u2019ll consider whether determinables may be as fundamental as\ndeterminates, and whether certain of the non-reductive accounts to\nfollow are compatible with fundamental as well as non-fundamental\ndeterminables.\n3.5.1 Essence-based accounts\n\nAsymmetric necessitation (i.e., Asymmetric modal dependence)\nhas been taken to be a neutral modal basis for theorizing about\ndetermination. As Yablo initially suggests:\n\n\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\) just in case the traditional relation\u2019s\nfirst, metaphysical component is in place, where this consists\nprimarily in the fact that \\(P\\) necessitates \\(Q\\) asymmetrically.\n(1992: 253, note 23)\n\n\nSince reductionists also accept Asymmetric modal dependence,\na modal account requires supplementation if it is to be\nnon-reductive.\n\nYablo goes beyond asymmetric necessitation in considering how (token,\nparticular) events\u2014the assumed relata of the causal\nrelation\u2014might stand in the determination relation; his approach\nappeals to the notion of essence of an event, and to the idea that the\nessence of one such event might be included in or subsumed by the\nessence of another:\n\n\nDetermination involves the idea that the requirements associated with\none thing include the requirements associated with another; and\nalthough properties are requiremental on their face, particulars are\nnot. Hence the need for a notion of individual essence, where\nessential properties of a thing are those it cannot exist without.\n[T]he essence of a thing is supposed to be a measure of what is\nrequired in order to be that thing. Thus if more is required to be\n\\(y\\) than to be \\(x\\), this should be reflected in an inclusion\nrelation between their essences:\n\n\nWhen \\(q\\)\u2019s essence is a subset of \\(p\\)\u2019s essence, \\(p\\)\nis said to subsume \\(q\\) (\\(p \\geq q\\)); and \\(p\\) determines \\(q\\)\n(\\(p > q\\)) when the inclusion is strict. (1992: 261)\n\n\n\nGranting that essences exist and bracketing continuing controversy\nabout their nature (see, e.g., Robertson Ishii and Atkins 2020),\nYablo\u2019s approach characterizes determinable events (e.g., a\npatch\u2019s being coloured at a time) in properly non-reductive\nterms at both the type and token levels, and might be extended to a\nmore general non-reductive account of determinables, capable of\naccommodating the range of motivations for irreducible determinables.\nTaking determinable events to have essences contained within\nassociated determinate events would also clearly explain various\nfeatures of determination, including (besides Asymmetric modal\ndependence, which is presumably still in force), Determinable\ninheritance (constitutive objects of determinate events are also\nconstitutive objects of determinable events) and Determination\n\u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables (the essences\nof/requirements on determinates include but go beyond the essences\nof/requirements on their determinables). More needs to be said,\nhowever, if an appeal to essences is to explain other features of\ndetermination, including Non-conjunctive specification,\nRequisite determination, Determinate\nincompatibility, and\u2014importantly for Yablo\u2019s intended\napplication of determination to the problem of mental causation;\n see \u00a75.2\u2014Causal\n compatibility. The latter feature might be gained if the\nessences at issue are constituted by powers (see below), in which case\nan essence-based account might shade into a powers-based account, to\nbe next discussed.\n3.5.2 Causal and powers-based accounts\n\nCausal and powers-based accounts of determination are typically\nmotivated by the problem of mental/higher-level causation, expressed\nby the question: How can higher-level properties bring about effects,\nas they seem to do, given that the physical properties upon which\nthese higher-level properties depend are sufficient to cause these\neffects? As we\u2019ll see in\n \u00a75.2,\n different causal accounts provide different answers to this question.\nAn important choice point, which will be tracked here, concerns\nwhether determinable and determinate instances are taken to be\ntoken-identical.\n\nThough MacDonald and MacDonald (1986) don\u2019t officially offer an\naccount of determination, they were the first to see determination as\nuseful for addressing the threat of causal overdetermination.\nEffectively, they suggest that the relation between mental and\nphysical properties is analogous to determination: in both cases the\nproperties at issue are, they maintain, type-distinct but\ntoken-identical, thus avoiding problematic overdetermination while\npreserving type-level causal relevance. It is unclear, however,\nwhether taking determinables and determinates to be token-identical\ncan accommodate certain of the (e.g., perceptual) motivations for\nirreducible determinables; token-identity accounts are also subject to\nan extension of Horgan\u2019s (1989) \u2018problem of mental\nquausation\u2019 and the associated concern with reductive accounts\nof mental states, according to which, given that the causal relata are\nultimately located particulars (events, objects, property instances),\nthe efficacy of determinables qua determinable\u2014that is,\nqua distinctively unspecific\u2014requires that determinable\nand determinate tokens as well as types be distinct.\n\nAn explicitly causal account of determination is Fale\u2019s (1990)\naccount of \u2018determinable or generic\u2019 and\n\u2018specific\u2019 universals, on which the former have a proper\nsubset of the \u2018causal relations\u2019 of the latter:\n\n\nIf \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are specific universals and \\(G\\) is a\ndeterminable or generic universal under which they both fall, then the\ncausal relations between \\(G\\) and other universals are a subset of\nthe causal relations between \\(S\\) and other universals; and also a\nsubset of the causal relations between \\(S'\\) and other universals.\nFor \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) to be species of a common genus is for them to\nshare some subset of causal relations, which subset can itself\nconstitute the causal essence of a universal, such as \\(G\\). For \\(S\\)\nand \\(S'\\) to be distinct species is for this subset to be a proper\nsubset of the causal relations which characterize \\(S\\), and also of\nthe causal relations which characterize \\(S'\\): there must be some\ncausal relation which \\(S\\) has, but not \\(S'\\), and some causal\nrelation which \\(S'\\) has, but not \\(S\\). (1990: 175)\n\n\nA subset-of-causal-relations account of generic/determinable\nuniversals promisingly accommodates many features of determination,\nfor reasons similar to those attaching to powers-based accounts,\nbelow. It also ensures the metaphysical irreducibility of a\ngeneric/determinable type to any specific/determinate type, by the\nprinciple of the indiscernibility of identicals (if \\(G\\) has only a\nproper subset of causal relations of \\(S\\), \\(G\\) cannot be identified\nwith \\(S\\)); and if this proper subset relation is preserved at the\nlevel of tokens, it will also block token-identity. More needs to be\nsaid, however, if this account is to ensure accommodation of\nNon-disjunctive specification (and more generally, if it is\nto block the metaphysical reducibility of determinable types to\ncertain constructions of determinate types), since one might suggest\n(as a variation on the theme of Antony 2003) that disjunctive types,\nlike Fales\u2019s generic types, have (only) the causal relations in\nthe intersections of their disjunctions. Fales\u2019s account also\nfails to provide a clear basis for accommodating Non-conjunctive\nspecification, since as stated it is compatible with a given\ndeterminate/species\u2019 being conjunctively analyzable into (for\nexample) a genus and differentia, each associated with a proper subset\nof the powers of the species. Even so, Fales\u2019 account of\ndetermination is a clear precursor both of Yablo\u2019s (1992)\nessence-based\n account[28]\n and the powers-based account, to be next discussed.\n\nA powers-based account of determination may be seen as an application\nof a powers-based approach to the metaphysical dependence (a.k.a.\n\u2018realization\u2019) at issue in physicalism (see Wilson 1999).\nAs Wilson observes, powers serve as a properly metaphysical basis for\ncharacterizing realization (improving on supervenience-based and\nepistemic approaches to this notion, in particular); moreover, she\nargues, a variety of seemingly diverse non-reductive physicalist\naccounts, including Yablo\u2019s determination-based account, are\nsimilar in aiming to ensure that the powers of a realized property are\na proper subset of those of its realizing property (properties). Hence\nshe maintains:\n\n\nOne way to make [Yablo\u2019s] conjecture more plausible is to put\nthe point in terms of the causal powers of the properties involved.\n[\u2026] the reason why \u201cdeterminables and their determinates\nare not causal rivals\u201d is because it is plausible, in the case\nof determinables and determinates, that each causal power of the\ndeterminable is identical to a causal power of its determinate.\n[Moreover, and for example,] the property of being scarlet, which is a\ndeterminate of the property of being red, evidently has more causal\npowers than the property of being red. (1999: 47)\n\n\nThese considerations suggest the following first-pass powers-based\naccount of determination:\n\n\nPowers-based determination (first pass): Property \\(P\\)\ndetermines property \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty]\nproper subset of the powers associated with \\(P\\).\n\n\nOn this approach, a determinate is more specific than its determinable\n(as per Increased specificity) in being associated with a\nmore specific set of powers. Clarke (1999), Shoemaker (2001, 2007),\nand Clapp (2001) also take determination to be a case-in-point of a\nnon-reductive realization relation satisfying the proper subset\ncondition on powers, where the powers associated with a given\ndeterminable property are those in the intersection of the sets of\npowers associated with its determinates.\n\nA powers-based account of determination provides a basis for\ndistinguishing determinable and determinate instances, contra\nMacDonald and MacDonald (1986) and Ehring (1996); for on a\ntoken-identity approach, determinable instances would be associated\nwith more powers than are associated with their type\u2014but that\nwould be reason for denying that the instance was of the determinable\ntype (see Wilson 2011). Hence the proper subset relation between\npowers plausibly holds for determinable and determinate tokens as well\nas types. This consideration also pushes against taking determinable\ntypes to be metaphysically reducible to (identified with) disjunctive\nor other constructions from determinates, since such reductive\nstrategies entail that instances of determinables and determinates\n(and hence the respective sets of token powers) are token-identical.\nAs such, and in particular, a powers-based approach accommodates\nNon-disjunctive specification.\n\nProponents of powers-based accounts accommodate Non-conjunctive\nspecification in different ways. On Shoemaker\u2019s version of\na powers-based account of realization/determination,\nNon-conjunctive determination is stipulated:\n\n\nProperty \\(X\\) realizes property \\(Y\\) just in case the conditional\npowers bestowed by \\(Y\\) are a subset of the conditional powers\nbestowed by \\(X\\) (and \\(X\\) is not a conjunctive property having\n\\(Y\\) as a conjunct). (2001: 78).\n\n\nWilson (2009) rather accommodates Non-conjunctive\nspecification by requiring that the powers in the complement of\nthe sets associated with a determinate and any of its determinates,\nrespectively, do not themselves constitute a set associated with any\nproperty, as per her second-pass formulation:\n\n\nPowers-based determination (second pass): Property \\(P\\)\ndetermines property \\(Q\\) iff \\(Q\\) is associated with a [non-empty]\nproper subset of the powers associated with \\(P\\), and the set of\npowers had by \\(P\\) but not by \\(Q\\) is not [in itself] associated\nwith any property.\n\n\nA powers-based account accommodates most other standard features of\ndetermination. Causal compatibility is accommodated, since\nevery power of a determinable instance is token-identical with a power\nof an associated determinate. Asymmetry,\nIrreflexivity, and Transitivity are inherited as\nfeatures of the proper subset relation between powers.\nDeterminable inheritance is accommodated in that in having a\ndeterminate property with an associated set of powers, an object will\nthereby have the determinables associated with proper subsets of the\ndeterminate\u2019s powers (assuming that properties are at least\ncontingently individuated by associated powers; see below for further\ndiscussion). Determination \u2018in respect of\u2019\ndeterminables and Determinate similarity/comparability\nare accommodated by determinates\u2019 sharing the powers of their\nassociated determinable but having further powers, where the powers of\nthe determinable constitute the respect in which determinables are\nsimilar, and powers had by determinates but not the determinable serve\nas a basis for ordering the determinates by degree of similarity\n(effectively: determinates sharing more powers will be more similar).\nAccommodation of Determinable similarity/orderability also\nprovides a basis for responding to concerns that we cannot make sense\nof irreducible determinables since we cannot \u2018get a grip\u2019\non the difference-makers of determinates\n (see \u00a73.2):\n on a powers-based view, the difference-makers are, comprehensibly,\nthe powers in the complement of determinate and determinable sets.\nThat said, more could be said about how the sharing of determinable\npowers makes sense of how these additional powers count as being\n\u2018in respect of\u2019 the determinable and its powers, and as\nproviding a basis for ordering by\n similarity.[29]\n It is also worth noting that a powers-based account does not itself\nensure the accommodation of either Requisite determination or\nUnique\n determination,[30]\n though these omissions may ultimately be a virtue\n (see \u00a75.3).\n\nA powers-based approach to determination faces two main concerns. One\nis that the view requires endorsement of a controversial \u201ccausal\ntheory\u201d of properties, on which properties are (following, e.g.,\nShoemaker 1980) essentially and exhaustively constituted by their\npowers; for if properties have non-causal quiddities (primitive\nidentities, which float modally free of powers), satisfaction of the\nproper subset condition on powers won\u2019t guarantee that\ndeterminables are completely metaphysically dependent on\n(\u2018nothing over and above\u2019; \u2018grounded in\u2019)\ndeterminates (see, e.g., Melnyk 2006: 141\u201343 and McLaughlin\n2007), since the status of the determinable\u2019s\n\u2018quiddity\u2019 is left untreated; nor will it explain\nDeterminable inheritance, since satisfaction of the condition\non powers is compatible with the absence of the determinable\nquiddities. Here it is worth noting that while certain proponents of a\npowers-based approach to determination (e.g., Clarke, Shoemaker,\nClapp) presuppose a causal theory of properties, such a commitment may\nbe dispensable: since non-causal quiddities are scientifically\ninaccessible and besides the point of solving the problem of\nhigher-level causation\n (see \u00a75.2),\n their presence or absence is irrelevant to the status of\ndetermination (and more generally, realization) as a relation between\nbroadly scientific properties (see Wilson 2011, 2021).\n\nA second concern with a powers-based approach is that, in applying\nonly to broadly scientific goings-on, it doesn\u2019t make sense of\ndetermination as holding between abstracta or other entities lacking\npowers. In response, a proponent of a powers-based account might try\nto extend the approach beyond specifically causal powers to one\ninvolving non-causal functional roles associated with, e.g., being a\nnumber (determinable), and being a prime number (determinate). This\nextension remains speculative, however; at present the account is not\nfully general.\n3.5.3 Constitutional accounts\n\nIt is natural to think of irreducible determinables as in some sense\nshared parts or constituents of determinates. Such a view would\nprovide a natural way of accommodating Determinate\nsimilarity, Determinable inheritance, and other\nfeatures. A powers-based account might be seen as taking determinables\nor associated powers to be constituent parts of determinates; here we\nconsider non-powers-based constitutional accounts.\n\nJohansson (2000, 2004) endorses a constitutive account of\ndeterminables\u2014more precisely, of \u2018maximal\u2019\ndeterminables (such as color, shape, and smell) located at the top of\na determination hierarchy\u2014taking Determinate similarity\nand Determinate gradability as its starting point. According\nto Johansson, it is characteristic of determinables and determinates\nthat \u201ctwo different determinates of the same determinable can\nalways be continuously connected\u201d (2000: 108), in a way\nproviding the basis for the gradeable resemblance of the determinates.\nConversely, he maintains, determinates under wholly different\ndeterminables are not connected in this fashion: \u201cNo\ncolor-determinate resembles more closely a shape-determinate or\nvolume-determinate than any other\u201d (2000: 108). This\n\u2018gap\u2019 between determinables acts as a criterion, whereby a\ndeterminable is posited if and only if there is such a gap\u2014hence\nit is that only maximal determinates exist, by lights of\nJohansson\u2019s criterion. In cases where a determinable is\nappropriately posited, the determinable is shared by its determinates\nand explains their similarity; for example, all color-determinates\nhave the determinable property color in common (Johansson\n2000: sec. 3). Johansson\u2019s view is a mixed\neliminativist/non-reductionist view, since he assumes that any\nnon-maximal determinables do not exist, but are merely \u201cman-made\nconstructions\u201d (2000: 113). Such a view might be challenged,\nhowever, since even in the absence of a \u2018comparability\ngap\u2019 between same-level determinates (e.g., yellow and\nred), one might still suppose that the difference between\nyellow and red is not a matter of convention.\nAnother concern with Johansson\u2019s account reflects that the mere\nposit of a shared determinable does not (as Bigelow and Pargetter\n[1990] and Massin [2013] have observed) in itself make sense of\ndeterminable differences, though the appeal to the \u2018continuous\nconnection\u2019 between determinates may be able to do work\nhere.\n\nWorley (1997) sketches a different sort of a constitution-based\naccount, as a way of supplementing Yablo\u2019s (1992) asymmetric\nnecessitation account. She illustrates with triangularity, analyzed as\ninvolving the constituent features associated with being a closed,\nthree sided plane figure, which features can vary in ways associated\nwith equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles, among others.\nWorley sees this as motivating an account of determination on which\n\u201cthe constituents of each determinable are proper subsets of the\nconstituents of each of their determinates\u201d, such that, e.g.,\nthe determinable triangular and the determinate\nequilateral triangular would share features such as\nthree-sided and closed plane figure, but the latter\nwould be additionally constituted by equilateral. As Worley\nobserves, this account accommodates various features of determination,\nincluding Determinable inheritance:\n\n\nThere can be no metaphysically possible world in which an instance of\na determinate can fail to be an instance of its determinable, since\nanything which is an instance of a determinate will be so in virtue of\nhaving certain features, which features will also be sufficient to\nmake that object an instance of the determinable. (1997: 290)\n\n\nThe shared constituent features also provide a basis for\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinates and\nDeterminate similarity/comparability, and perhaps the\nadditional features of the determinates can provide a basis for\nDeterminate incompatibility. The main concern with\nWorley\u2019s account is that it doesn\u2019t accommodate\nNon-conjunctive determination, and in fact seems to require\nits denial.\n3.5.4 Grounding-based accounts\n\n\u2018Grounding\u2019 (here capitalized to distinguish use of this\nterm from traditional schematic uses of \u2018grounding\u2019 as\nneutrally ranging over specific metaphysical dependence relations) is\na recently-introduced primitive relation or notion of metaphysical\ndependence, taken to be operative in any context where such dependence\nis at issue (either as holding between facts or propositions\npertaining to some goings-on, or between worldly goings-on\nthemselves). Proponents of Grounding typically take determination to\nbe a paradigm case of such dependence, with determinables being\nGrounded in determinates. For example, Correia suggests that\n\u201cthe determinate features of a thing\u201d are the Grounds of\n\u201cthe determinable features of a thing\u201d (2005:\n49\u201350); Schaffer (2016b) takes a case of determination as the\nprimary exemplar of his \u2018structural equations\u2019 approach to\nGrounding; and Rosen (2010) endorses the following principle:\n\n\nDeterminable-Determinate Link: If \\(G\\) is a determinate of\nthe determinable \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) is \\(G\\), then \\([Fa] \\leftarrow\n[Ga]\\)\n\n\nHere, \\([Fa] \\leftarrow [Ga]\\) stands for \u2018the fact that \\(Fa\\)\nis Grounded in the fact that \\(Ga\\)\u2019.\n\nThough Grounding is primitive, proponents stipulate that it has\nvarious features\u2014most commonly, those of a strict partial order,\nin which case a Grounding-based account of determination will satisfy\nAsymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\n Transitivity.[31]\n The also-common assumption that Grounding entities metaphysically\nnecessitate Grounded entities accommodates Determinable\ninheritance. How to accommodate other features (including\nNon-conjunctive specification, Non-disjunctive\nspecification, Determination \u2018in respect of\u2019\ndeterminables, and so on) is less clear, since Grounding\ndoesn\u2019t itself distinguish determination from other dependence\nrelations.\n\nCorrespondingly, the main concern with a Grounding-based account is\nthat primitive Grounding alone fails to shed any substantive light on\ndetermination, instead simply registering the common supposition that\ndeterminables metaphysically depend on determinates in a way\nconforming to certain stipulated formal features. This concern is a\ncase-in-point of the more general concern raised in Wilson (2014),\naccording to which Grounding is too abstract to shed any useful\nmetaphysical light on its own. Some proponents of Grounding attempt to\nprovide more substance to a Grounding-based account of determination\nby deriving or modeling the claim that determinables are Grounded in\ndeterminates, but whether these attempts succeed is unclear; see,\ne.g., Schaffer\u2019s (2016a,b) suggestion that determination can be\nmodeled using the apparatus of structural equations (\u00e0\nla Pearl 2000 and Spirtes and Scheines 1993), and reasons to\nresist that suggestion offered by Koslicki (2016) and Wilson\n(2016).\n3.6 Accounts of the structure or logic of determination\n\nWe now discuss three accounts or models which are best seen as\nelucidating certain structural or broadly logical features of\ndetermination or determinates.\n3.6.1 Property-space accounts\n\nA property-space model of the sort advanced in Funkhouser 2006 (see\nFunkhouser 2014 for further exposition) starts by filling in what it\nis to have a determinable \u201cin a specific way\u201d\n(Increased specificity) by attention to \u2018determination\ndimensions\u2019\u2014features along which a determinable may be\ndetermined, such as, e.g., hue, saturation, and\nbrightness in the case of color. The suggested\nmethodology for identifying determination dimensions of a given\ndeterminable is broadly empirical, and involves inquiring after\n\u201cthe ways in which determinates under the determinable \\(X\\) can\ndiffer from one another with regard to their \\(X\\)-ness\u201d (2006:\n551), which suggestion picks up on both Determination \u2018in\nrespect of\u2019 determinables and Determinate\nincompatibility.\n\nFunkhouser then offers a model on which determination dimensions,\nassumed to have discrete or continuous ranges of values, serve as\ncoordinate axes of a \u2018property space\u2019 for a given\ndeterminable. The space as a whole corresponds to the determinable;\npoints in the space correspond to maximal determinates, associated\nwith specific assignments of values to each determination dimension;\nsubspaces of the space correspond to less than maximal determinates\n(which themselves may be determinables relative to contained subspaces\nor points). For example, color has determination dimensions\nhue, saturation, and brightness, such that,\ne.g., red determines color if and only if the\nproperty space of red is a proper subspace of the property\nspace of color. More generally:\n\n\nProperty \\(B\\) determines property \\(A\\) iff\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) share the same determination dimensions\n\\(B\\) has the non-determinable necessities of \\(A\\) and\nThe property space of \\(B\\) is a proper subset of the property\nspace of \\(A\\).\n\n\n\n\u2018Non-determinable necessities\u2019 are those features of a\ndeterminable not allowing for variation (e.g., being three-sided, in\nthe case of triangularity); condition (2) registers that sharing of\nnon-determinable necessities is also required for determination, in\naddition to the increase in specificity associated with conditions (1)\nand (3), registering that determinates differ with respect to the\nvalues of one or more determination dimensions associated with the\ndeterminable.\n\nModeling determinates as subspaces of a determinable space\naccommodates many features of determination, including, to start,\nIncreased specificity, Determination in-respect-of\ndeterminables, Asymmetry, Irreflexivity, and\nTransitivity. Determinate incompatibility follows\nfrom subspaces\u2019 being disjoint; Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability may be elucidated by reference to\nmetrics on the spaces, whereby subspaces of a determinable space may\nbe nearer or further apart. Funkhouser also aims to accommodate\nCausal compatibility by taking determinable and determinate\ninstances (tropes) to be identical.\n\nWith this latter claim, Funkhouser\u2019s account moves into\nontological territory, and might be plausibly seen as a sophisticated\nvariation on a disjunctivist or other reductionist theme\u2014say,\none elucidating the internal dimensional structure of determinate\ndisjuncts vis-\u00e1-vis associated\n determinables.[32]\n As with reductive accounts, Funkhouser\u2019s assumptions that\nreality is ultimately maximally determinate and that determinable and\ndeterminate instances are token-identical might be challenged as\neither empirically inadequate or such as to not properly accommodate\nthe perceptual and other motivations for determinables. That said, it\nseems likely that the structural aspects of Funkhouser\u2019s\napproach could be preserved even if these assumptions are relaxed,\nsuch that, e.g., \u2018points\u2019 in a property space aren\u2019t\ntaken to correspond to maximal determinates (see note 46).\n3.6.2 Metric-space accounts\n\nThe metric-space account of\n\u201cdeterminables-together-with-their-determinates\u201d advanced\nby Denby (2001) \u201cidentifies abundant determinables and\ndeterminates with impure sets and the having relation with a\nset-theoretical relation\u201d (2001: 316). Determinables are defined\nas follows:\n\n\n\\(F\\) is a determinable iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle S, f\\rangle\\)\nwhere:\n\n\\(S\\) is a metric space; and\n\\(f\\) is a function from concrete particulars into the points of\nthis metric space.\n\n\n\nHere a determinable is thought of as a \u201cclassification\u201d of\nparticulars. The metric space \\(S\\) is a collection of points together\nwith a \u201cdistance\u201d relation on these points; it defines the\npossible classificatory locations and how they are related. Each point\ncorresponds to a determinate of that determinable, and the distance\nrelation provides a measure of the similarities among them. The\nfunction \\(f\\) maps each concrete particular in its domain to a unique\npoint in the metric space.\n\nDeterminates are defined as follows:\n\n\n\\(F\\) is a determinate iff \\(F\\) is a pair \\(\\langle D, E_i\\rangle\\)\nwhere\n\n\\(D\\) is a determinable; and\n\\(E_i\\) is the extension of point \\(i\\) in the metric space\nencoded by \\(D\\).\n\n\n\nIn set-theoretic terms, a determinate is thought of as a\n\u201ccentered\u201d classification of particulars, defined by a\ndeterminable and by the determinate\u2019s extension. Denby moreover\nsees determinables as ultimately categorizing the possession of\nmaximal or \u201csparse\u201d\n determinates;[33]\n as such, he interprets his model along anti-realist or reductionist\nlines.\n\nThis approach to determinables and determinates is attractive, Denby\nargues, in that sets are ontologically unproblematic and their\nidentity-conditions and relations are well-understood (and similarly\nfor functions and metric spaces), and in that the account accommodates\n\u201cthe pre-theoretic intuitions about the logical relations among\nproperties\u201d (2001: 310), including Unique\n determination,[34]\nDeterminate\n similarity/comparability,[35]\n and Determinate incompatibility. The primary concerns here\nare again those associated with anti-realist or reductive views of\ndeterminables, though as with Funkhouser\u2019s account it might be\nthat the broad structure of Darby\u2019s metric conception of\ndeterminables is compatible with a non-reductivist reading.\n3.6.3 Co-determination accounts\n\nFine\u2019s aim in his 2011 is to characterize \u201cwhat it is for\nthe world to possess the kind of structure that it has when the\ndeterminate/determinable distinction is in play\u201d (2011: 162),\ntaking as inspiration Wittgenstein\u2019s post-Tractarian view, on\nwhich\n\n\nthe atomic propositions might exhibit the kind of dependence that is\ncharacteristic of the way in which different determinants of a given\ndeterminable are exclusive of one another. (2011: 161)\n\n\nFine\u2019s project reflects the usefulness of Determinate\nincompatibility for his truthmaker semantics (Fine\n2012a,b)\u2014most notably, in providing a non-similarity-based\naccount of the worlds entering into counterfactual deliberation, with\nthe general idea being that a counterfactual world will be just like\nthe actual world but for the replacement of some actual state \\(s\\)\nwith a state \\(s'\\) that is a determinate under the same determinable\nas \\(s\\). As such, Fine\u2019s ultimate aim is to provide a\ndefinition of the \u2018co-determinable\u2019 relation between\nstates\u2014a task which \u201cavoids the tricky question of saying\nwhat exactly a determinable is\u201d (2011: 184), though certain\nstructural characterizations of determinables fall out of his account.\nSince Fine\u2019s approach to characterizing determinable-determinate\nstructure is rather intricate, we direct the interested reader to the\nattached\n footnote.[36]\n4. Are determinates metaphysically prior to determinables?\n\nIt is commonly assumed that determinables, if they exist, are less\nfundamental than determinates. Of course, this assumption is true on\nreductionist\n accounts;[37]\n but even those taking determinables to be irreducible to determinates\noften suppose that the latter are prior to the former. In this section\nwe canvass reasons for and against taking determinates to be\nmetaphysically prior to determinables.\n4.1 Asymmetric necessitation/supervenience\n\nOne criterion of priority takes it to be sufficient for some goings-on\nto be less fundamental than some others that the former are\nasymmetrically necessitated by (or \u201cmetaphysically supervene\non\u201d) the latter. As per Asymmetric modal dependence, it\nis characteristic of determinates that they asymmetrically necessitate\ntheir associated determinables, thanks to the distinctively unspecific\nnature of determinables. Hence Armstrong says:\n\n\nA point to be taken very seriously is that because determinates entail\nthe corresponding determinable, the determinable supervenes on the\ndeterminates, and so, apparently, is not something more than the\ndeterminates. (1997: 50)\n\n\nAsymmetric necessitation appears to be insufficient for\nnon-fundamentality, however, as is reflected in standard concerns that\n(even asymmetric) supervenience is too weak to guarantee complete\nmetaphysical dependence (see, e.g., Horgan 1993, Wilson 2005, and\nMcLaughlin and Bennett\n 2005).[38]\n Nor is asymmetric necessitation necessary for the holding of a\npriority relation, as Fine\u2019s (1994) case of Socrates and the\nsingleton set of Socrates shows. As such, one can reasonably deny that\nthe asymmetric necessitation of determinables by determinates\nestablishes that determinables are less fundamental than\ndeterminates.\n\nEven accepting the criterion, one can question whether it shows that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. As French\n(2014) observes, while determinable instances do not entail any\nparticular determinate instances, there is nevertheless\n\u2018two-way\u2019 entailment: every determinate instance entails\ndeterminable instances, and every determinable instance entails some\ndeterminate instance. One might respond that the word\n\u2018some\u2019 expresses residual asymmetry in priority as opposed\nto simply reflecting that determinables are less specific than\ndeterminates, but as French notes, \u201cthose who exclude\ndeterminables from the fundamental base need to show what specificity\nhas to do with fundamentality\u201d (2014: 284).\n4.2 Naturalness\n\nAnother criterion takes more fundamental properties to be more\n\u2018natural\u2019, in the terminologically\n inapropos[39]\n meaning of Lewis (1983), in making for greater objective resemblance\nbetween their possessing particulars than do less fundamental\nproperties. This conception appears to deem determinables less\nfundamental than determinates: since determinables are less specific\nthan their associated determinates, particulars sharing a given\ndeterminate property (e.g., scarlet) will be more objectively\nsimilar in the relevant respect than will be particulars sharing an\nassociated determinable property (e.g., red). However,\nobjective resemblance can hold between properties as well as\nparticulars; hence even granting that determinates make for more\nobjective resemblance between particulars, one can reasonably maintain\nthat among the perfectly natural joints are those associated with\ndeterminables, understood as making for objective resemblance between\nassociated determinates (see Wilson\n 2012).[40]\n Such a consideration would support McDaniel\u2019s (2010)\nsupposition that the increase in specificity at issue in determination\ndiffers from that at issue in the disjunction-disjunct relation, in\nthat determinables, unlike disjunctions, are as natural as their\nspecifications.\n4.3 The argument from fixing\n\nAnother criterion of fundamentality, associated with intuitive\n\u201call God had to do\u201d scenarios, is one according to which\nfundamental entities fix all the rest. This criterion again seems to\nsupport taking determinates to be prior to determinables, for once the\nspecific, or determinate, facts are fixed, then, it seems, more\ngeneral/determinable facts are thereby fixed, with the latter being at\nbest ontologically real abstractions from the former. By way of\ncontrast, fixing the determinable facts does not fix the determinate\nfacts (as is reflected in Asymmetric modal dependence).\n\nThat determinable facts are fixed by determinate facts can be\nchallenged, however, by attention to the constitutive modal fact about\nany given determinable instance\u2014say, a given instance of\nred\u2014that it is of a type that might have been\ndifferently determined\u2014say, by scarlet rather than\nmaroon (see Wilson 2012). Here the suggestion is that no\ndeterminate fact or complex combination of such facts can provide a\nnon-gerrymandered basis for such a constitutive modal\n fact.[41]\n\nOne response is to maintain that a fundamental base need only ground\nthe contingent non-modal facts at a world, as Schaffer (2004: 90)\nsuggests; if so, then the failure of determinate instances to ground\ncertain modal facts about determinable instances won\u2019t impugn\nthe priority of determinates. One might maintain, however, that a\nsupposed \u201cground\u201d for some entity which failed to provide\na metaphysical basis for modal facts constitutive of the entity would\nbe incomplete, at best. As French puts it,\n\n\nfixing the non-modal facts and leaving modal flexibility out of the\npicture would yield an incomplete inventory. And the most obvious way\nof fixing the modal facts would be to include the determinables\nthemselves in the fundamental base. (2014: 284)\n\n\nThere is a worry that this line of thought will overgenerate, in that\nmany higher-level features and objects (e.g., tables) are to some\nextent constitutively modally flexible. A possible response is that\nwhether the line of thought applies to a given case will depend on\nwhether the basis for the modal flexibility is itself derivable from\nor otherwise clearly generated by lower-level goings-on. For example,\nmultiply realizable higher-level features (say, temperature in\nthermodynamic systems) whose modal flexibility results from the\nimposition of lower-level physical constraints would not be\nappropriately deemed fundamental (or as fundamental as their physical\nrealizers).\n4.4 Questions and implications\n\nThe previous considerations suggest that some determinable features of\nreality might be fundamental, or as fundamental as determinate\nfeatures. This result raises several questions, answers to which have\nimplications for our understanding of determinables and determinates,\nand of the fundamental.\n\nOne question pertains to whether the determinates associated with\nfundamental determinables are also part of the fundamental base. It\nmight seem so; for even granting that (fundamental) determinates\ncannot completely ground determinables, determinates seem also to be\nneeded to be existential witnesses for more specific goings-on. In\nthat case, a further question arises concerning how determinables and\ndeterminates jointly participate in a fundamental base. Wilson (2012)\nsuggests that a model for understanding such joint founding may be\nfound in the sciences, and more specifically in how general scientific\nlaws combine with initial or boundary conditions (15\u201316), an\nanalogy developed by French, who maintains that \u201cscientific\ndeterminables and determinates jointly enter into the fundamental base\nfor everything else\u201d (2014: 285). That said, there are arguably\nmetaphysical views on which only determinables are fundamental; for\nexample, Hubner and Matyasi (2020: 634) observe that Spinoza rejects\nthe view that determinates are among the fundamenta (insofar as the\none fundamental entity has only determinable features): \u201chis\nsubstance is both the least specific (indeterminate) and the most\nfundamental entity\u201d (e.g. Ep36; IV/185/29).\n\nA further question concerns whether existing non-reductionist accounts\nof determinables can make sense of these being fundamental. On the\nface of it, there is no special difficulty with accommodating\nfundamental determinables on either powers-based or constitution-base\naccounts of determination, or with such accounts\u2019 making sense\nof joint determinable/determinate founding. On Johansson\u2019s\n(2000) account, for example, it might be that determinates depend on\ndeterminables in that the latter are constitutive parts of the former\n(nota bene: not obeying weak supplementation), and\ndeterminables depend on determinates in that, modulo certain outside\ncase (e.g., gappy quantum indeterminacy;\n see \u00a75.3),\n determinable instances must be parts of some determinate whole.\n\nThat determinables and determinates may be jointly fundamental has\nimplications for our understandings of fundamentality and metaphysical\ndependence. Fundamental entities are commonly assumed to be\nindependent, in being wholly distinct, and (relatedly, as per\n\u2018Hume\u2019s Dictum\u2019) in being such that each can either\nexist together or exist apart. But if (some) determinables and\ndeterminates can be equally fundamental, this understanding is\nincorrect; for given the intimate relationship between determinables\nand determinates, to say that these are equally fundamental is\nevidently not to say either that they are wholly distinct or (even\ngranting Hume\u2019s Dictum) modally independent. Moreover, if\ndeterminables and determinates can mutually found each other, other\ncommonly stipulated suppositions are called into question\u2014e.g.,\nthat the fundamental entities are those that do not depend on any\nother entities, and that metaphysical dependence is asymmetric.\n\nThe possibility of fundamental determinables also bears on various\nfirst-order metaphysical topics. For example, Paul (2002, 2012)\nendorses a one-category ontology (\u2018mereological bundle\ntheory\u2019), on which properties and relations are fundamental, and\nproperty composition is \u201cthe fundamental glue\u201d (2012:\n242). Paul allows that determinables might be among the fundamental\nproperties and relations (note 22), and moreover suggests that such\nposits may be required to accommodate theories couched in terms of\nproperties and relations which are \u201cextremely abstractly\nspecified\u201d (2012: 245).\n5. Applications\n\nWe now canvass three topics in metaphysics where attention to\ndeterminables and determinates has played a significant\n role.[42]\n5.1 Laws of nature and nomological modality\n\nAs mentioned previously, determinables and determinates have been seen\nas relevant to our understanding of laws of nature in both physics and\nthe special sciences. Armstrong (1997) argues that irreducible\ndeterminables are needed to make sense of functionally specified laws\nin physics. Consider Newton\u2019s law of gravitation:\n\n\\[F = K (M_1 M_2)/D\\]\n\n\nAs Armstrong notes (see also Fales 1990: 61, Mellor 1998: 190, 208,\nand French 2014), substitution of the determinable quantities \\(F\\),\n\\(M\\), and \\(D\\) with determinate values gives rise to \u201ca law\nwhich stands as determinate to the original, determinable, law\u201d\n(1997: 63). One might try to provide an anti-realist or reductionist\ntreatment of these seemingly determinable laws. Armstrong (1997)\nargues, however, that such deflationary treatments cannot make sense\nof the role of functional laws in sustaining counterfactuals, at least\nif properties are Aristotelian universals, whose existence depends\nupon their being instantiated; for then there will typically (and\nperhaps necessarily, for the case of continuous quantities) be gaps in\nthe actual instantiations of functional laws. As such, the unity of\ndeterminates in these cases involves not just partial identities (as\ndiscussed in\n \u00a73.3)\n but \u201cstrictly identical second-order properties\u201d, which\nare the \u201creal [\u2026] determinables\u201d (1997: 247).\nMellor similarly maintains that in Newton\u2019s law, \u201cthe\ndeterminables ... are second order universals\u201d which exist along\nwith associated first-order determinate universals (1998: 209).\nFunctional laws of nature are then taken to be relations between these\ndeterminable universals.\n\nFrench offers a structuralist account of laws of nature as expressing\ndeterminable relations (a position Mellor also considers; 1998: 209).\nAs regards Newton\u2019s law, French says:\n\n\nIf we insert specific values [\u2026], we obtain a determinate\ninstance of the law, expressing the relation that holds between\ndeterminate properties. So, the law as a whole can be regarded as\nexpressing a determinable relation, which can be made determinate in\nspecific situations. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAgain, French allows that determinable laws/relations may be\nfundamental. Reflecting that one reason for taking (some)\ndeterminables to be fundamental is that these are partly constituted\nby modal facts pertaining to their possible determinations (see Wilson\n2012), French moreover suggests that the determinable nature of laws\nprovides a basis for physical modality:\n\n\nthese determinate instances correspond to solutions that can be\nrepresented by (more) specific models of the theory, and it is the\nshared structure between these models that yields the relevant\nphysical modality. The relationship between the more generic and more\nspecific models can be captured by that between determinables and\ndeterminates. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAnother application of determination to the metaphysics of laws\nconcerns whether these are contingent, in having at best a restricted\nphysical or nomological modality, or rather are metaphysically\nnecessary. Kistler (2005) argues that such laws are metaphysically\nnecessary, first arguing that the quantities in \u2018laws of\nassociation\u2019 such as the ideal gas law are reasonably seen as\ndifferent determinables of the same determinate states, such that such\nlaws are necessary; then generalizing on the base of systematicity\nconsiderations to other kinds of\n laws.[43]\n5.2 The problem of mental/higher-level causation\n\nHow can mental goings-on bring about physical effects, as they seem to\ndo, given that the physical realizers of mental goings-on are already\nsufficient to cause these effects? This question gives rise to the\nproblem of mental (more generally, higher-level) causation, encoding\ntwo threats: first, that mental properties, if efficacious,\nproblematically overdetermine their effects; second, that avoiding\noverdetermination requires that mental properties be causally excluded\nby their realizers. Overdetermination and exclusion are avoided if\nmental and physical goings-on are identical, but in that case it seems\nthat mental goings-on are not efficacious qua mental (see\nHorgan 1989); as Yablo puts it: \u201cMental events are effective,\nmaybe, but not by way of their mental properties\u201d (1992: 249).\nMoreover, type identity seems at odds with the multiple realizability\nof mental properties.\n\nSome, including MacDonald and MacDonald (1986), Yablo (1992), Wilson\n(1999), and Shoemaker (2001), have suggested that a better response\nproceeds by taking mental properties to be determinables of their\nphysical\n realizers.[44]\n The appeal to determination reflects various features of determinates\nand determinables, including Causal compatibility. As Yablo\nsays,\n\n\n[W]e know that [determinables and determinates] are not causal rivals.\n[\u2026] Determinables and their determinates, like objects and\ntheir parts, are guaranteed to be on the same team. (1992: 259)\n\n\nMoreover, as per Multiple determinates, determinables are\nmultiply determined, and given that determinables and determinates are\ntype- and perhaps also token-distinct, one can argue\n (see \u00a73.5)\n that determinables are distinctively efficacious. If mental\nproperties are determinables of physical realizers, these features are\ninherited: as causal non-competitors, overdetermination is avoided\nwhile accommodating multiple realizability, compatible with the\ndistinctness and distinctive efficacy of mental properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other higher-level goings-on, in which case\nrealization might be determination, more generally.\n\nA determinable-based approach to realization is subject to two main\nconcerns (besides those generally targeting a powers-based account;\n see \u00a73.5),\n each aiming to show that realization cannot be determination, on\ngrounds that realization lacks some key feature of determination (see\nEhring 1996; Funkhouser 2006, 2014; Walter 2007; Worley 1997). First\nis the argument from mental multiple realizability, according to which\nsuch realizability effectively violates Determination \u2018in\nrespect of\u2019 determinables (entailing that determinates\ndiffer in respect of determinables), since\n\n\nMental properties are said to be multiply realizable precisely because\ndistinct physical realizers can be exactly the same with respect to\nthe mental property they realize (Walter 2007: 219)\n\n\nin which case\n\n\n[T]he physical realizers of the mental will not differ mentally at\nall, as they should if they are determinates of the requisite mental\nstates. (Ehring 1996: 474)\n\n\nSecond is the argument from mental superdeterminates, according to\nwhich a mental property could be maximally specified qua\nmental\u2014as, e.g., a precise state of searing pain (Ehring), or a\nbelief maximally specified along the dimensions of content and\nconfidence (Funkhouser); but if realization is determination, this\nwould falsely imply that mental super-determinates could be further\ndetermined.\n\nOne response to these concerns, offered by Wilson (2009), proceeds by\nanalogical attention to color metamerism, in which colors of the same\nhue, saturation and brightness can differ in respect of color, and are\nmoreover reasonably taken to have physical determination dimensions.\nOne \u2018metameric moral\u2019 is that properties such as\ncolor may have physical determination dimensions; a second is\nthat the determination dimensions had by a given higher-level property\nmay be science-relative. Applying the morals: there is no in-principle\nproblem with mental properties\u2019 having physical determination\n dimensions;[45]\n moreover, which dimensions are associated with mental properties may\nbe science-relative. This allows accommodation of mental multiple\nrealizability: mental properties with diverse physical realizers can\nbe exactly alike, relative to the determination dimensions associated\nwith psychology, compatible with these mental properties being\ndifferent, relative to a lower-level physical science distinguishing\nthese realizers. And given that different sciences may treat a single\ndeterminable as having different determination dimensions, mental\nproperties may be super-determinate relative to a purely psychological\nscience, while being further determined relative to a lower-level\nscience.\n\nA powers-based implementation of the metameric\n morals[46]\n also provides a basis for a response to a third objection, due to\nWorley (1997), according to which the constituents of beliefs are not\nconstituents of their physical realizers, as they would have to be if\n(as per Worley\u2019s constitution-based account;\n see \u00a73.5)\n beliefs were determinables of physical\n determinates.[47]\n Supposing that constituents are associated with sets of powers, the\ncontent of a belief may be a constituent of its physical realizers,\nafter all\u2014not qua content per se, but\nqua the relevant subset of powers.\n5.3 Metaphysical indeterminacy\n\nMany phenomena appear to be indeterminate: macro-objects (clouds,\nmountains) appear to have imprecise boundaries; the future, it seems,\nmight be genuinely open; on many interpretations of quantum mechanics,\nsome properties of a system (e.g., position and momentum, orthogonal\nspin components) cannot jointly have precise values. In these and\nother cases there are reasons to think that the indeterminacy is\nmetaphysical, as opposed to merely semantic or epistemic. Elder (1996)\nsuggests that determinables might be useful for purposes of making\nsense of \u201cthe idea that corresponding to (at least some) vague\npredicates there really are, in the world, vague properties\u201d\n(1996: 150). Wilson (2013) more specifically argues that determinables\nand determinates provide the basis for an attractive account of\nmetaphysical indeterminacy\n (MI),[48]\n as follows:\n\n\nDeterminable-based MI: For a state of affairs to be\nmetaphysically indeterminate in a given respect \\(R\\) at a time \\(t\\)\nis for the state of affairs to constitutively involve an object\n(entity) \\(O\\) such that (i) \\(O\\) has a determinable property \\(P\\)\nat \\(t\\), and (ii) for some level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(P\\),\n\\(O\\) does not have a unique level-\\(L\\) determinate of \\(P\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\n\nOne application of Determinable-based MI is to macro-object\nboundary MI; here the conditions are satisfied in \u2018glutty\u2019\nfashion, reflecting that macro-objects typically have multiple\noverlapping realizers, as with Mount Everest and the multiple\noverlapping aggregates of rock in its vicinity at any given time. On\nthe suggested approach, Mount Everest has a determinable boundary\nproperty, but no unique determinate boundary property, since there are\ntoo many candidate determinates of the determinable, associated with\nthe comparatively precise boundaries of its realizing aggregates, to\nnon-arbitrarily pick out any one as the \u2018unique\u2019\ndeterminate boundary had by the mountain. At best, these determinate\nboundaries can be attributed to Mount Everest in relativized (or\ndegree-theoretic)\n fashion.[49]\n That ordinary objects typically have metaphysically indeterminate\nboundaries provides, in combination with a determinable-based account\nof realization\n see \u00a75.2,\n the basis for an argument that such objects are emergent\u2014that\nis, distinct from and distinctively efficacious as compared to the\nlower-level configurations upon which they cotemporally depend (see\nWilson 2021, Ch. 6). Another application is to open future MI: here\nthe conditions may be satisfied in \u2018gappy\u2019 fashion,\nreflecting that, while there might be present grounds for the future\ninstancing of a given determinable (say, being an outcome of a sea\nbattle) there may be no present grounds for the future instancing\nof any specific determinate of that determinable.\n\nDeterminable-based MI is also usefully applied to cases of\nvalue indeterminacy on (various interpretations of) quantum mechanics,\nassociated with superpositions, incompatible observables, and\nentangled states. Darby (2010) and Skow (2010) argue that metaphysical\nsupervaluationist accounts of MI (see Akiba 2004, Barnes 2010, and\nBarnes and Williams 2011) cannot accommodate quantum MI on the\northodox interpretation, for on these accounts MI is effectively a\nmatter of primitive unsettledness about which maximally precise world\nor state of affairs obtains; but such an approach cannot model quantum\nMI, since the Kochen-Specker theorem rules out simultaneously\nassigning definite values to all properties of a quantum system.\nCalosi and Wilson (2019 and forthcoming) defend this result against\ncertain objections, and extend the concern with supervaluationist\naccounts to cases of MI on the GRW and Everettian interpretations,\nassociated with GRW\u2019s \u2018tail\u2019 problem (see Lewis\n2016) and ineradicable incompatible observable MI within Everettian\nbranches (see A. Wilson 2020), respectively.\n\nBy way of contrast, Determinable-based MI is compatible with\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem, and more generally, with insuperable or\n(as Skow puts it) any \u2018deep\u2019 quantum MI associated with\nquantum phenomena. Whether individual such cases are best treated in\ngappy or glutty determinable-based terms remains controversial.\nBokulich (2014) and Wolff (2015) see a gappy implementation as most\npromising for the target case of spin value indeterminacy; as Wolff\nobserves:\n\n\nPermitting the instantiation of determinables without determinates\nhelps to describe this phenomenon, because we can say that \\(x\\)-spin\nand \\(y\\)-spin are determinables with two determinates each, and\n[after a spin-\\(z\\) measurement] neither of these determinates is\ninstantiated even though the determinables \u201cspin-\\(x\\)\u201d\nand \u201cspin-\\(y\\)\u201d are. (2015:\n 385)[50]\n\n\n(See also Schroeren 2021.) However, a glutty implementation has\ncertain advantages, including being able to preserve information\nassociated with coefficients of components states in a superposition.\nCalosi and Wilson (2021) advance a glutty implementation as providing\nthe basis for an intelligible explanation of the distinctive\ninterference patterns characteristic of the double-slit experiment,\nreflecting that a single particle in the experiment can (in\nrelativized or degree-theoretic fashion) go through both slits in such\na way as to be able to interfere with itself (as per Dirac\u2019s\noriginal suggestion).\n\nThat said, whether the value indeterminacy on (available readings of)\navailable interpretations of quantum mechanics should be understood in\nmetaphysical terms, and if so, whether it should be treated in\ndeterminable-based terms (or relatedly, whether a supervaluationist\napproach can be fixed up so as to do the job), remains an area of\nactive\n research.[51]\n The debate continues; still, here and in other cases of seeming MI\nthere is a case to be made that our experiential and theoretical\nfamiliarity with determinables goes at least some distance towards\nrendering MI intelligible\u2014offering, along the way, a nice\ncase-in-point of how determinables may be useful for purposes of\nilluminating the structure of natural reality.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Akiba, Ken, 2004, \u201cVagueness in the World\u201d,\n<em>No\u00fbs</em>, 38(3): 407\u201329.\ndoi:10.1111/j.0029-4624.2004.00476.x", "Antony, Louise M, 2003, \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Disjunctive\nProperties?\u201d <em>Philosophical Issues</em>, 13(1): 1\u201321.\ndoi:10.1111/1533-6077.00001", "Aristotle, <em>Metaphysics</em>, in J.A.
