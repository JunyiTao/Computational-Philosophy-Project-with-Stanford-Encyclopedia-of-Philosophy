Oruka\u2019s Project\n\nThe following two examples from this text illustrate the method and\npurpose of Oruka\u2019s questioning. When asked what he thought of his own\n(Luo) community\u2019s idea of communalism, Paul Mbuya Akoko responded as\nfollows:\n\nNow the sense in which we may justly say that the Luo in the\ntraditional setting practiced communalism is not one in which people\ngenerously shared property or wealth. Their idea of communalism is, I\nthink, of a co-operative nature. For example, where one person had\ncattle, everybody \u2018ipso facto\u2019 had cattle. For the owner\nof the cattle would distribute his cattle among people who did not\nhave cattle [of their own] so that the less well-off people may take\ncare of them\u2026[but] never completely given away\u2026The\nresult is that everybody had cows to look after and so milk to drink.\n(Oruka, 1990: 141)\n\n\nAnother sage, Okemba Simiyu Chaungo from the Bukusu community,\nresponded to the question, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d as follows:\n\nWhen something is true, it is just as you see it \u2026 it is just\nwhat it is \u2026 just like this bottle \u2026 it is true that it\nis just a bottle\u2026 just what it is. Truth is good. Falsehood is\nbad. It is evil. He who says the truth is accepted by good people. A\nliar may have many followers \u2026 but he is bad.\n[Obwatieri \u2026 bwatoto. Bwatoto nokhulola\nsindu ne siene sa tu \u2026 nga inchpa yino olola ichupa ni yene sa\ntu.] (Sage Philosophy, p. 111)\n\n\nAnd in response to an Interlocutor, who asks \u201cWhy would people tell\nlies?\u201d, he responded:\n\nSo that they may eat\u2026 so that they may get empty prestige. They\nwant to profit fraudulently. (Sage Philosophy, p. 111)\n\n\nFrom these examples some of the distinguishing characteristics of Sage\nPhilosophy can be gleaned. First, they display the deeply personal\nnature of the ideas, or opinions, that the sages expressed in response\nto the questions. Akoko\u2019s insight derives from his individual\nreflections on the practice of communalism to consider its\njustification. Second, they provide evidence of abstract thought about\nphilosophic topics. Chaungo considers what it means for a proposition\nto be true and expresses what turns out to be a correspondence theory\nof truth \u2014 according to which the proposition \u201cThis is a\nbottle\u201d is true if the object it refers to, this thing, is\nindeed a bottle. By pointing out that some people choose deliberately\nto be untruthful for unjust gain he also addresses the moral aspects\nof truth.\n\nOruka\u2019s survey of sages aimed to counter three negative claims\nregarding the philosophical status of indigenous African thought:\n\nUnlike Greek sages who used reason, African sages do not engage in\nphilosophic thought.\nAfrican sages are part of an oral tradition, whereas philosophic\nthought requires literacy.\nAfrican traditions encourage unanimity regarding beliefs and\nvalues and discourage individual critical thought.\n\n\nHis reply to these claims has significantly shaped the discourse on\nSage Philosophy. In what follows the criteria he proposed to determine\nwhat counts as Sage Philosophy will be considered in the light of his\ncritique of the Eurocentric bias against African philosophic thought\nand the question of whether literacy is required.\n2. The African Sage Tradition and Eurocentric Bias\n\nFirst, Oruka was concerned about the picture created under colonialism\nthat, while the sayings of numerous Greek sages such as Thales,\nAnaximander, Heraclitus, and other pre-Socratics, were regarded as\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d those of traditional African sages were\nnot. This bias arises out of the implicit belief that philosophy is\nthe privileged activity of certain races. He believed that this\nunjustified belief had further led to the image of philosophy as the\nrestricted property of Greeks, or Europeans, and, even more\nexclusively, the property of white males. Partly concerned with\nexposing the falsehood of this Eurocentric attitude, he recognized\nthat what had raised the apparently simple sayings of the\npre-Socratics to the status of philosophy was the subsequent sustained\ncommentaries by later philosophers. He maintained that the ideas\nexpressed by indigenous African sages were no different from those by\nthe earlier Greeks. When recorded later in books, the sayings of Greek\nsages came to be widely regarded as \u201cphilosophical,\u201d and\nthe people who produced them as \u201cphilosophers.\u201d Given such\na scenario, Oruka was led to wonder, why would the sayings of Akoko,\nor those of Chaungo, for example, not be similarly regarded after they\nare committed to writing by a professional philosopher?\n\nOruka supports his comparison of indigenous African sages with the\npre-Socratics by citing two methods that have contributed to the\ngrowth of philosophy in the West, beginning with its Greek roots. One\ndirect method of using dialogues is exemplified in the early Platonic\nworks. Socrates asks primary questions upon which the exposition of\nideas by his interlocutor is based. Oruka viewed his own dialogues\nwith the sages as an example of this practice in the African context.\nSocrates regarded himself as a \u201cmid-wife\u201d of sorts,\nbecause he merely helped those with the knowledge to bring it out. He\nbrought out what was in each case really the property of his\ninterlocutors, not his own. Oruka meant his dialogues, in similar\nfashion, to capture both this method and its outcome. He maintained\nthat the sages he and his disciples interviewed were the owners of\ntheir own ideas. The Western-trained philosopher, he says,\n\u201cplays the role of philosophical provocation\u201d (Sage\nPhilosophy, p. 47). The other method, exemplified in the later\nPlatonic works, involves indirect engagement with the sayings of the\nsages through a commentary on their ideas \u2014 derived from these\ndialogues, or from general acquaintance with the sages\u2019 views. Oruka\nbelieved that, by these two methods, the growth of African philosophy\ncan take place in a manner similar to the growth of Western\nphilosophy. Underlying Oruka\u2019s position was his hope that trained\nphilosophers, regardless of their origins, could take on the sages on\ntheir claims in their commentaries and critiques as this is how\nadvancement and growth of knowledge partly takes place. This is to\nsay, in hindsight, that even in Oruka\u2019s own view the sayings of the\nsages were not free of critique.\n3. Literacy and The Oral Tradition in Sage Philosophy\n\nThe influence of colonial bias against unwritten thought was also\nchallenged by Oruka\u2019s project. By publishing his interviews with the\nsages he aimed to counter the second negative claim regarding the\ndenigration of African thought, namely that \u201cphilosophy is and\ncan only be a \u2018written\u2019 enterprise; and so a tradition\nwithout writing is incapabale of philosophy [and that any claim to the\ncontrary] \u2026is a non-scientific, mythological claim\u201d\n(Sage Philosophy, p.xv). He insisted that there are African\nthinkers, not yet absorbed into the tradition of the written word,\nwhose memories are, in terms of consistency and organization, as good\nas the information recorded in books (Sage Philosophy, pp.\n49\u201350). Responding to adversaries, he cautioned that:\n\nto argue like the critics, not just of Sage philosophy but of African\nphilosophy generally have done that Africa is having a late start in\nphilosophy just because we have no written records of her past\nphilosophical activities is, wrongfully, to limit the sources from\nwhich we could detect traces of such activities (Sage\nPhilosophy, p. 50).\n\n\nPeter Bodunrin was particularly critical of Oruka\u2019s method of\nextracting Sage Philosophy. He argued that to show that there were\npeople, like the indigenous sages, who were capable of philosophical\nthinking was one thing, but it was a completely different thing to\nshow that there were African philosophers who have engaged in\norganized systematic reflections on the traditions of their people.\nRegarding Bodunrin\u2019s first objection, Oruka\u2019s response, as already\nindicated above, was that philosophers often work in response to other\nideas, whether they are the ideas of other philosophers, or popular\nideas in the philosopher\u2019s own setting. Oruka had a relatively longer\nresponse to Bodunrin\u2019s second objection. In another essay popularly\nassociated with his name, Oruka identified four main trends to be\nconstitutive of African philosophy, namely (i) African\nethnophilosophy, (ii) African nationalist-ideological philosophy,\n(iii) professional African philosophy, and of course, (iv) the African\nSage philosophy under consideration here. Not only do these trends\nshow different approaches that African philosophers have adopted to\nunravel and systematically to expose the underlying principles on\nwhich different departments of African life are based, they also\ndemonstrate that African philosophy is not limited or confined to the\nacademic institutions.\n\nIndeed, many African philosophers look far beyond the traditional\nphilosophical texts for sources and subject matter of philosophical\nreflection. For example, while engaging in subtle analytic\nphilosophical reflections, African philosophers incorporate with great\nease narratives from everyday lives and from literature into their\nreflections of the philosophical implications of their cultural\nevents. Oruka was especially wary of the sub-group among professional\nAfrican philosophers whose position regarding African traditional\nmodes of thought was analogous to European bias in denying reason to\nAfricans in their traditional settings. It was this attitude,\naccording to Oruka, that amounted to a claim that Africans lacked a\ntradition of organized systematic philosophical reflections on the\nthoughts, beliefs, and practices of their own people. He thought that\nthis view was exemplified in its most eloquent and strongest form by\nPeter Bodunrin. In his (Oruka\u2019s) own estimation, Bodunrin had\nseriously underestimated the central point in the long tradition of\nWestern scholarship, popularized by the works of L\u00e9vy-Bruhl,\nthat denied Africans not only the existence of organized systematic\nphilosophical reflection, but reason itself. Oruka thought that this\nview was rather absurd, for no society of humans can live for any\nreasonable amount of time, let alone making any advances in their own\nways of seeing and doing things, if they do not have reason, or if the\nideas and concepts upon which their cultures are built do not make\nsense. If, on the other hand, critics of African Sage philosophy based\ntheir refutation of the possibility of sage philosophy on the lack of\nwritten philosophical treatises, Oruka countered such a position by\narguing that to exist as a philosopher it is not necessary that one\u2019s\nthoughts must be written, or that they must progress \u2014 meaning\nthat they must be commented on or even be available to future\ngenerations. While systematicity is important to the structure and\nconsistency of good thinking, neither it nor preservation of thought\nnecessarily requires literacy. Preservation in particular, he thought,\nwas done selectively by generations for divers emerging reasons and\ncircumstances, and so was not, in and of itself, the measure of the\nphilosophical quality of someone\u2019s thoughts. For just as thoughts can\nbe expressed either in writing, or as unwritten oral reflections,\ne.g., sayings and argumentations of sages, so they may be preserved\nfor a long time by sages, or quickly forgotten and cast into\nhistorically insignificant bits of a community\u2019s past, only to be\nremembered by the few whom they touched in some special way.\n\nOruka\u2019s position, as is also argued forcefully by Kwasi Wiredu,\nanother African philosopher and Oruka\u2019s contemporary, is that there is\nno harm in African philosophers\u2019 creative fusion of influences from\nother traditions into their critical evaluations of African beliefs\nand practices in different fields (\u201cThe Ghanaian Tradition of\nPhilosophy\u201d in Person and Community, p. 2). Such a fusion is\npart of bringing into focus the interplay between philosophy and\npractice. Oruka believed, as he explains in Trends in Contemporary\nAfrican Philosophy (pp. 17\u201318), that this is precisely what Kwame\nNkrumah (1964), L\u00e9opold S. Senghor (1962), and Julius K.\nNyerere (1968, 1968a), for example, had done in forming their\npolitical-philosophical positions (what Oruka calls \u201cideological\ntrends\u201d), all with different results.\n4. Ethnophilosophy, Unanimity and African Critical Thought\n\nAlthough it had been used previously by other writers, the term\n\u201cethnophilosophy\u201d acquired its notoriety in the work of\nthe Beninois philosopher Paulin Hountondji (1970, 1983). Perhaps\nunaware that the term had been used earlier, Hountondji criticized the\nBelgian missionary, Placide Tempels\u2019 book, Bantu Philosophy\n(first French ed. 1945, and Eng. tr. 1959), as well as his disciples,\namong them the French philosopher and ethnographer Marcel Griaule, the\nRwandais philosopher Alexis Kagame, and the Kenyan theologian John\nMbiti, for casting African philosophy as an anonymous system of\nthought, without individual thinkers to claim or account for it. By\nthe end of the 1960s, the positive reception in Anglophone Africa, not\nonly of Tempels\u2019 Bantu Philosophy, but also John Mbiti\u2019s African\nReligions and Philosophy (1969) and Marcel Griaule\u2019s\nConversations with Ogotemm\u00eali that had recently been\ntranslated into English (1965), coincided with the rising tides of\npolitical and cultural nationalism throughout the continent.\n\nThe third negative claim Oruka aimed to challenge pertains to the\nphilosophical status of indigenous African thought. Ethnophilosophy\nhad falsely popularized the view that traditional Africa was a place\nof philosophical unanimity and that African traditions encouraged\nunanimity regarding beliefs and values. If this were true it would\nallow no room for individual thinkers like, say, Socrates or\nDescartes, with their own independent views on such matters. Oruka was\nconcerned that African intellectuals were drawn into this false\nassumption regarding the intellectual inclination of African people,\nmaintaining the belief that critique is absent from indigenous African\nthought. This situation was worsened by the new political movements of\npostindependence African nations where one-party political systems\nsprang up. By outlawing opposition politics as being both unAfrican\nand antinationalist, political leaders often appealed to this view of\nunanimity. The Sage Philosophy project objected to this claim\nregarding unanimity in Africa, which Oruka regarded as absurd, by\npresenting empirical evidence of the diversity of thought among\nindigenous thinkers. Oruka insisted that, while rulers everywhere will\nalways crave unanimity, thinkers thrive in dialogue and diversity of\nopinion. He pointed out that Sage philosophy was about thinkers, not\nrulers.\n\nOruka\u2019s desire to distinguish Sage philosophy from ethnophilosophy was\nalso in response to another false view, partly created by\nethnophilosophy, that indigenous African thought is anonymous. An\nimportant charge against ethnophilosophy has been that, by simply\npresenting the teachings of African beliefs in the allegorical modes,\nthe impression is created that indigenous African modes of thought are\ndeeply grounded in their mythical representations of reality, thus\nleaving the philosophic ideas largely unexplained. With this in mind,\nOruka\u2019s project aimed to counter two types of false perception of\nindigenous African thought. First, he separated the myths from the\nclearly thought out and logically valid philosophical ideas of\nindigenous individual thinkers to make clear what he frequently\nreferred to as the \u201canthropological fogs\u201d (Sage\nPhilosophy, pp. xxi-xxix). Secondly, he contested the idea that a\nqualitative mental leap from myth is required for Africans to embrace\nphilosophical thought. Such a view had been expressed by the Belgian\nphilosopher Franz Crahay in a widely read article, \u201cLe\nd\u00e9collage conceptuel: conditions d\u2019une philosophie\nbantoue\u201d (1965). Although he was critical of ethnophilosophy,\nHountondji was the first philosopher to distance himself from Crahay\u2019s\nposition, arguing that local knowledge systems were already separate\nfrom myths, as no humans can live on myths. Moral principles, for\nexample, would have to be abstract in character to be applicable in\ngeneral terms beyond one person (Hountondji 1970). According to Wiredu\n(1996: 182ff), such independent and critical thinking was available in\nvarying forms in Akan communities and was the basis of frequently\nprotracted disputations among elders in search of a consensus\nregarding matters that required negotiations. Thus, contrary to the\nview that knowledge at the communal level was anonymous, Wiredu argues\nthat it is precisely in regard to the importance of consensus on\nmatters of common good that disputation and careful navigation through\ndifferent opinions was not just considered to be crucial, but was put\non transparent display until some form of consensus was attained. In\nother words, consensus was not imposed, but relentlessly pursued. Such\nimportant matters like just claims to different kinds of rights were\nnot adjudicated without the input of those members of community who\nwere well regarded for their independent opinions.\n\nAnother point that Oruka makes against the perception of unanimity in\nAfrican traditional thought can be found in the expressions of\nthinkers whose ideas are grounded in critical analysis and evaluation\nof everyday experiences in their communities. Another example of this,\nbesides such figures as Paulo Mbuya Akoko and others who Oruka\nmentions and discusses in the book Sage Philosophy is the\nfamous Swahili poet, critic, and philosopher Shabaan bin Robert from\nthen Tanganyika, now Tanzania. Shabaan, famed as a pioneer in the\ninterface between the oral and the written traditions, has established\na unique legacy as an indigenous independent thinker, whose focus in\nhis written work was to theorize about metaphysical and social ideals.\nAbout the former, Shabaan theorizes in his work entitled Utubora\nMkulima the attributes of ideal personhood by arguing strongly,\nin a dialogical setting, that an ideal person is one whose moral\nrighteousness is aimed at being a perfect member of community, and\ntherefore his concerns for common good supersede individual interests\n(pp. 26\u201328). Regarding social ideals, Shabaan argues in\nKusadikika that a good society is defined as one in which all\nmembers are accorded their basic rights and treated with equality\nregardless of gender, age, or social status (pp. 29\u201343). This makes\nShabaan Robert an example of a liberal thinker whose ideas bridge\nbetween indigenous or pre-colonial social structures and values, and\nthe so-called modern society whose values were significantly\ninfluenced by colonial occupations and interests, as well as new\neconomic, political, and moral values. In these senses, Shabaan Robert\nthought and works complement those of other indigenous thinkers in\ncritiquing both indigenous and new modes of existence. To Oruka, these\nare signs that indigeneity is not, as is widely but falsely thought,\nsynonymous with anonymity and stagnation in thought.\n5. What counts as Sage Philosophy?\n\nAccording to Oruka, Sage Philosophy is \u201cthe expressed thoughts\nof wise men and women in any given community and is a way of thinking\nand explaining the world that fluctuates between popular wisdom (well\nknown communal maxims, aphorisms and general common sense truths) and\ndidactic wisdom, an expounded wisdom and a rational thought of some\ngiven individuals within a community\u201d (Sage Philosophy,\np. 28). Oruka, however, had very definite ideas about who qualifies as\na philosophic sage and how such persons are to be distinguished from\nother sages. When asked whether or not philosophy advances knowledge,\nBarasa is quoted as saying: \u201cYes. Being a rational method of\ninquiry into the real nature of things, philosophy is a means to\nre-examine knowledge and belief\u201d (Sage Philosophy, p.\n150). The tendency to express dissatisfaction with the status quo\nbelief system of their communities is an important critical component\nand a criterion Oruka used to identify sages as philosophical.\nDissatisfaction sometimes motivates the philosophic sage to advance\nthe knowledge that everyone has by subjecting it to scrutiny in order\nto determine its validity and worth. While philosophic sages may still\nshare with others some customary practices and beliefs, or aspects of\nthem, unlike other members of their community, they emphasize rational\nexplanations and justifications of courses of action. They owe greater\nloyalty to reason than to custom for its own sake. As a result, not\nonly are sages often a source of new knowledge, but they are also a\ncatalyst to change within their communities.\n\nIn the example cited above, Mbuya defines communalism in terms of a\nmorality that appeals to the welfare of others as a guide to action.\nHe indicates its goals, and limitations as a principle that aims at\nminimizing socio-economic disparity between the haves and the\nhave-nots. On Oruka\u2019s view, not every member of society carries out\nthese kind of elaborations and conceptual clarifications of the\nprinciples that underlie what the majority live at the pragmatic level\nonly as custom. While he recognizes that there are other indigenous\nsages in African communities, he distinguishes these from philosophic\nsages such as Mbuya and Chaungo, who are committed to critical inquiry\nand to the rational grounding of values and beliefs. Other indigenous\nsages, who may be wise in some sense, but not critically oriented, act\nas repositories of the statements of the beliefs of their communities,\nwhich they have learned and can repeat, or teach, to others exactly as\nthey are supposed to be remembered.\n\nThis lattter group is exemplified by Ogotemm\u00eali, a sage from the\nDogon community in present-day Mali. His teachings were transcribed\nand commented on by the French philosopher and ethnographer Marcel\nGriaule in the now classic text, Conversations with\nOgotemm\u00eali: Introduction to Dogon Religious Ideas (Eng. tr.\n1965), one of the outstanding texts of indigenous African thought.\nOgotemm\u00eali presents the commonly shared knowledge of the Dogon\ncommunity, including not only their very complex theories about the\norigin of the universe and the subsequent development of material and\nnon-material entities in it, but also a startling astronomical system\nthat points to the Dogon\u2019s pre-telescopic knowledge of the Sirius (A\nand B) and their paths across the skies. Yet, despite this pioneer\nscientific and mathematical genius, at no time throughout the entire\npresentation does one encounter Ogotemm\u00eali as a thinker, only as\nthe representative and narrator of the collective memory of his\ncommunity. His own voice is submerged into a communal mode of\nexpression. According to Oruka, the absence of any personal direct\nreflections on the issues at hand qualifies Ogotemm\u00eali only as a\nfolk sage. A folk sage is a highly intelligent and good narrator of\ntraditionally imposed beliefs and myths. He, or she, may explain such\nbeliefs and values with great detail and may even expound on the\nrelation between the mythical representations and the lessons in and\nfor society that they are intended to illustrate. But while the folk\nsage hardly veers off the narrative, by contrast, a philosophic sage\nis a person \u201cof traditional African culture, capable of the\ncritical, second-order type of thinking about the various problems of\nhuman life and nature; persons, that is, who subject beliefs that are\ntraditionally taken for granted to independent rational reexamination\nand who are inclined to accept or reject such beliefs on the authority\nof reason rather than on the basis of a communal or religious\nconsensus\u201d (Sage Philosophy, pp. 5\u20136).\n\nThe onisegun, deliberately kept anonymous by Hallen and Sodipo for\nreasons of privacy, and who expound and elucidate the traditional\nthought of the Yoruba, are certainly wise and very knowledgeable\npeople. On Oruka\u2019s criteria for philosophic sagacity, however, they\ntoo are only folk sages. They are like Ogotemm\u00eali, whose\npresentation, however complex and amazing in details, is exactly what\nevery wise Dogon person is expected to know (Sage Philosophy,\npp. 9\u201310). Oruka distinguishes between folk and philosophic\nsages, in terms of those who pursue the rational grounding of beliefs\nand values, as opposed to those who merely narrate them as they appear\nin their commuity\u2019s belief systems.\n\nW. V. O. Quine\u2019s indeterminacy thesis of radical translation presents\na major difficulty for the explanations of the conceptual content and\nmeaning of terms in Yoruba language provided by the onisegun to Hallen\nand Sodipo. Quine attacked the concept of universal propositions and\nmeanings that are frequently assumed by translators to exist across\nall languages. This draws in question the practice of anthropologists\nstudying African belief systems. Following Quine, Hallen argues that\n\u201cGiven the cumulative effects of the indeterminacy of\ntranslation between radically different languagaes, an alternative\nexplanation for such inconsistencies could be that translators have\nrecourse to contradiction because they, perhaps unwittingly, have not\nbeen able to arrive at a determinate or precise translation\u201d\n(A Short History of African Philosophy, pp. 37\u20138).\nFailing to find in non-Western modes of thought precise translations\nof comparable rational expressions in their own languages,\nanthropologists hastened to conclude that the problem must lie with\nthe non-Western modes of thought which appear to lack ways of\naccommodating rational expressions. Yet, Hallen and Sodipo\u2019s own\nconversations with the Yoruba sages illustrate what happens when one\ntries to translate, among others, the English term \u201cknow\u201d\ninto Yoruba. The outcome of their comparative analyses shows that our\nconceptual assumptions about reality are often tied to the natural\nlanguages we speak. To be fair, Hallen\u2019s and Sodipo\u2019s work is not a\nsimple description of what the onisegun said. Rather, they attempt to\ntease out what was intended conceptually in a language translated as\nfaithfully as possible into propositions which they contrast with\ncomparable ones in English. Nonetheless, Oruka maintained that any\nsuch use of Western philosophical language to analyze indigenous\nAfrican thought leads to the separation \u201cbetween an insider in\ntraditional African philosophy and the outsider analyzing or\ndescribing this philosophy in a language of Western thought. Given\nthis, the two cannot really meaningfully express their thought to each\nother and it would be absurd to find that one can be an expert in the\nthought of the other\u201d (Sage Philosophy, p. 15).\nConclusion\n\nIt is not entirely clear what Oruka believed ought to be the\nrelationship between the indigenous philosophic sage and his or her\nWestern-trained counterpart. What is clear from his remarks is that\nthe use of Western philosophers, like Quine or Wittgenstein, for\nexample, as tools for analyzing the conceptual content of African\nmodes of thought has allowed some scholars to champion \u201cwhat\nthey term \u2018African philosophy\u2019 by using terminology given\nin \u2018Western philosophy\u2019. None, so far, has given an\naccount of what is to be treated as the language of African\nphilosophy\u201d (Sage Philosophy, p. 15). On this point at\nleast, Oruka seems to position himself away from philosophers such as\nAppiah, Wiredu, and Gyekye. He understood the work of professional\nphilosophers to be distinct from that of the philosophic sages and\nexpressed the wish that they could remain so, as a way of preserving\ntraditions. This idea appears to be implied by his regret that\n\u201cThe tragedy for man is that the Western intellectual elite has,\nover the years, successfully imposed its own culture and philosophy\nover the masses. So, British philosophy, for example, is taken to be\nthe texts of Lockes, Humes, Bacons, Russels, etc.\u201d (Sage\nPhilosophy, p. 16). Oruka\u2019s concern with the preservation of\nindigenous thought suggests that he desired to keep the professional\nschool of philosophers separate from that of the philosophic sages to\nensure the preservation of the intellectual integrity, not only of the\nsages, but of the African heritage as a whole. He was concerned that\nthe language of African professional philosophers was too dependent on\nthe Western conceptual lexicon and that its unchecked imposition on\nindigenous conceptual schemes might finally contribute to the demise\nof the latter.\n\nAmong African philosophers, Kwasi Wiredu is particularly sympathetic\nto Oruka\u2019s concerns. Writing on the need for conceptual decolonization\nin African philosophy, Wiredu claims that such a need would mean both\n\u201cavoiding or reversing through a critical conceptual\nself-awareness the unexamined assimilation in our thought (that is, in\nthe thought of contemporary African philosophers) of the conceptual\nframeworks embedded in the foreign philosophical traditions that have\nhad impact on African life and thought\u2026[and] exploiting as much\nas is judicious the resources of our own indigenous conceptual schemes\nin our philosophical meditations on even the most technical problems\nof contemporary philosophy\u201d (Cultural Universals and\nParticulars, p. 136). At the same time, Wiredu agrees with other\nphilosophers like Appiah and Gyekye in insisting that while the\nbeliefs, proverbs, and customs of African cultures should be included\nin the philosophical reflections of the professional, such cultural\nelements of folk knowledge also must be subjected to critical analysis\nand evaluation because, \u201cThere is no pretense\u2026that\nrecourse to the African vernacular must result in instantaneous\nphilosophic revelation\u201d (Cultural Universals and\nParticulars, p. 138).\n\nOruka believed that professional African philosophers could interact\nwith their sagacious counterparts, provided there was sufficient room\nfor each to flourish separately. This idea suggests that he desired to\nexpand the location of legitimate philosophical activity beyond the\ninstitutional confines of the academy, which he considered to be\nintricately connected to the colonial legacy. It is in this regard\nthat the idea of African Sage philosophy has provided an important\nintervention in the development of contemporary African philosophy,\naddressing many crucial issues African philosophers continue to face\nin the wider context of postcolonial cultural inquiry, of which\nphilosophy is only a part. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in A\nCritique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of a Vanishing\nPresent (1999) has suggested that the self-awareness stage in\npostcolonial theory is largely over and that the formerly colonized\ncultures are settling down to utilizing their respective cultural\nreservoirs without significant attention to the need to reclaim their\nindigenous voices, and without minimizing the need for a continued and\nsustained awareness of the ever-present Eurocentric impositions. This\norientation is displayed, for example, in Wiredu\u2019s independent, but\ncomparative, analyses of Western and African concepts, whose\nwidely-debated epistemological position that \u201ctruth is nothing\nbut opinion,\u201d hinges on the contrast between the objectivist\nimplications of the claim \u201cI know that\u201d in English and the\nnon-objectivist implications in the Akan language.\n\nAlong with Wiredu, Hallen and Sodipo also hold that very complex\nphilosophical views are already signaled by many sayings in African\nlanguages, and wait to be teased out through careful analysis and\ninterpretation. Although Oruka\u2019s idea of the sages as philosophically\nsavvy in their own languages raises methodical questions as to whether\nsage philosophy is the property of the professional philosopher, or of\nthe indigenous wise person, and only teased out through the prompting\nof a professional philosopher, Hallen, Sodipo and Wiredu agree with\nhis insistence that the distinguishing marks of African philosophy\nemerge precisely out of analytical involvement by Western-trained\nphilosophers, who raise questions regarding the conceptual\nunderpinnings of indigenous beliefs, values, and languages, and\ncritically examine their meaning and implications. They propose, on\nthis basis, to accommodate both indigenous sages, and Western-trained\nprofessionals, as philosophers.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Akoko, Paulo Mbuya, 1945 [1938]. <em>Luo Kitgi gi Timbegi</em>,\nNairobi: East African Standard.", "Appiah, Kwame Anthony, 1992. <em>In My Father\u2019s House: Africa in\nthe Philosophy of Culture</em>, Oxford and New York: Oxford University\nPress.", "Bodunrin, Peter, 1981. \u201cThe Question of African Philosophy\u201d, in\n<em>Philosophy: The Journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy</em>,\nNo.56; also in <em>African Philosophy: An Introduction</em>, \nRichard A.
