    "main_text": "Naturalism || Normality and Variation\n4.4 Normality and Variation\n\nStatistically, a textbook heart, for example, may be very rare indeed.\nBut it is the account of the organ that gets into the physiology\ntextbook. The textbook tells you what a healthy organ is like by\nreference to an abstraction \u2013 an idealized organ. This concept\nof normality is not justified by appeal to a conceptual analysis that\naims to capture intuitions about what\u2019s normal. It draws all its\nauthority from its predictive and explanatory utility: against the\nbackground of assuming normal heart function, for example, we account\nfor variation in actual hearts (a particular rhythm, say), by citing\nthe textbook rhythmic pattern (which may be very unusual\nstatistically) and identifying other patterns as arrhythmic. The point\nof textbook depictions of human physiology is to identify an ideal\nsystem that enables us to answer \u201cwhat if things had been\ndifferent questions\u201d (Woodward 2003, Murphy 2006). The role of\nan idealization, in this system, is to let us classify real systems\naccording to their departure from the ideal. So normal human\nbiological nature, in this sense, is an idealization designed to let\nus impose order on variation.\n\nVariation in biological traits is ubiquitous, and so establishing\nwhether a mechanism is functioning normally is difficult: nonetheless,\nbiologists do it all the time. As Boorse notes, many objections argue\nthat pathological states are aspects of natural variation and conclude\nthat there is no clear distinction between the normal and the\npathological. But he contends that is a non-sequitur, since the\nexistence of widespread and extensive variation is compatible with the\nexistence of pathological states. Boorse (2014, p. 696\u20138) and\nMatthewson and Griffiths (2017) both point out that biologists often\njudge that members of a species come in forms that are not normal\nvariants but pathological states.\n\nHowever, how we ascertain what is pathological remains to be\ndetermined. Not all diagnoses can be tied to a break between normal\nand abnormal functioning of an underlying mechanism, such as a failure\nof the kidneys to conserve electrolytes. Nor can we always discover\nsome other abnormality, such as the elevated levels of helicobacter\npylori bacteria that have been found to be causally implicated in\nstomach ulcers (discussed in detail by Thagard 1999). Some conditions,\nsuch as hypertension, involve cutting between normal and pathological\nparts of a continuous variation, even in the absence of clear\nunderlying malfunctions that separate the populations. The Boorsian\ntradition has tried to deal with the problem of variation by tying\nassessments of function and malfunction to reference classes, which\nBoorse (1977) treated as natural classes of organisms that share a\nuniform blueprint. Kingma (2007, 2010) has recently argued that\nreference classes cannot be established without normative judgements,\ncontra Boorse, who takes them to be objectively discoverable parts of\nthe natural order. Kingma contends that Boorse\u2019s account of\nfunction needs to capture not only the qualitative causal contribution\nmade by a system to overall functioning, but also the quantitative\nfeatures of its contribution: a healthy heart is not just a pump, but\na pump that works at a given rate. In addition, a system must be\ncapable of working in a variety of situations, including rare ones\nthat require a physiological response to a crisis. Kingma argues that\nBoorse\u2019s biostatistical theory cannot capture statistically\nunusual yet functional situations, and concludes that we need to\nappeal to situation-specific functions. (Cf. Canguilhem (1991 p. 196),\nwho argued that disease is only abnormal relative to a clearly defined\ncontext.)\n\nKingma also points out that organs can become diseased even if they do\nact in a situationally appropriate way. Liver damage due to\nparacetamol overdose is obviously not healthy, she says, but the liver\nis not doing anything situationally inappropriate. That is, a reduced\nlevel of function in the context of paracetamol overdose is the\nsituationally appropriate way for the liver to perform. Kingma offers\nBoorse a dilemma. First, he can either abandon the notion of\nsituationally specific functions. This means failing to recognize the\ndynamic nature of physiology and leading to absurdities such as the\nclaim that a gut which is not currently digesting because it is empty\nof food is, in fact, diseased. Or, second, Boorse can acknowledge\nsituation-specific functions, in which case he must say that some\nsystems are healthy (because they are acting as they should in that\nsituation) even though our intuitions insist that they are unhealthy,\nbecause there are diseases that are statistically the norm in some\nsituations. Hausman (2011) responds that from a Boorsian perspective\nthe crucial question is whether the normal response \u2013 the\norganism doing its job under stress \u2013 renders the system\nincapable. The digestive system may respond appropriately to poison\nbut in doing so it becomes incapable of normal function on average. If\na victim of a poisoning were to a eat a large unpoisoned meal, her\ndigestive system would function much less well than that of the\naverage unpoisoned person in similar circumstances.\n\nFollowing Boorse, Hausman assumes that there is an average range of\nperformance within a normal population in normal circumstances that\ncan tell us what physiological profile a healthy system ought to have.\nHis reply is developed and expanded by Garson and Piccinini (2014).\nThe issue is whether these normal circumstances can be specified\nwithout begging the question, or whether Wachbroit is correct to think\nof medical normality as an idealization that is unrelated to\nstatistical normality. On any approach, a worry is that if we cite\nbehavioral factors in establishing normality they will reflect\ncontested conceptions of human flourishing. Distinguishing failures to\nflourish from functional abnormalities will always be a special\nproblem for psychiatry. For example, judgments of irrationality are\ncentral to many psychiatric diagnoses, and our standards of rational\nthought reflect not biological findings but standards derived from\nnormative reflection. The possibility of psychiatric explanation\nemploying the methods and models of physical medicine, then, depends\non how much of our psychology is like the visual system \u2013 i.e.\ndecomposable into structures to which we can ascribe a natural\nfunction (Murphy 2006). Within medicine more generally, the prospects\nfor a general naturalism about disease depend on our ability to\nunderstand human biology as a set of structures whose functions we can\ndiscover empirically, and our capacity to understand disease causally\nas the product of failures of those structures to perform their\nnatural functions.\n\nMore could be said on all these topics, but the essay will now shift\nto discuss health. A simple account of health might hold it to be\nsimply the absence of disease, so that if we agree everything is\nfunctioning as it should \u2013 subject to the complications outlined\nabove, then one is healthy. But most discussions of health insist that\nhealth is not just the absence of disease but something more. \n",
