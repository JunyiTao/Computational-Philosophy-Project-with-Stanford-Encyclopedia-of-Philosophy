    "main_text": "\n\n\nAt least in anglophone countries, Spinoza\u2019s reputation as a\npolitical thinker is eclipsed by his reputation as a rationalist\nmetaphysician. Nevertheless, Spinoza was a penetrating political\ntheorist whose writings have enduring significance. In his two\npolitical treatises, Spinoza advances a number of forceful and original\narguments in defense of democratic governance, freedom of thought and\nexpression, and the subordination of religion to the state. On the\nbasis of his naturalistic metaphysics, Spinoza also offers trenchant\ncriticisms of ordinary conceptions of right and duty. And his account\nof civil organization stands as an important contribution to the development of constitutionalism and the rule of law.\n",
