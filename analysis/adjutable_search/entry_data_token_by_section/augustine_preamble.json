    "main_text": "\n\nAugustine was perhaps the greatest Christian philosopher of Antiquity\nand certainly the one who exerted the deepest and most lasting\ninfluence. He is a saint of the Catholic Church, and his authority in\ntheological matters was universally accepted in the Latin Middle Ages\nand remained, in the Western Christian tradition, virtually\nuncontested till the nineteenth century. The impact of his views on\nsin, grace, freedom and sexuality on Western culture can hardly be\noverrated. These views, deeply at variance with the ancient\nphilosophical and cultural tradition, provoked however fierce\ncriticism in Augustine\u2019s lifetime and have, again, been\nvigorously opposed in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from\nvarious (e.g., humanist, liberal, feminist) standpoints. Philosophers\nkeep however being fascinated by his often innovative ideas on\nlanguage, on skepticism and knowledge, on will and the emotions, on\nfreedom and determinism and on the structure of the human mind and,\nlast but not least, by his way of doing philosophy, which\nis\u2014though of course committed to the truth of biblical\nrevelation\u2014surprisingly undogmatic and marked by a spirit of\nrelentless inquiry. His most famous work, the Confessiones,\nis unique in the ancient literary tradition but greatly influenced the\nmodern tradition of autobiography; it is an intriguing piece of\nphilosophy from a first-person perspective. Because of his importance\nfor the philosophical tradition of the Middle Ages he is often listed\nas the first medieval philosopher. But even though he was born several\ndecades after the emperor Constantine I had terminated the\nanti-Christian persecutions and, in his mature years, saw the\nanti-pagan and anti-heretic legislation of Theodosius I and his sons,\nwhich virtually made Catholic (i.e., Nicene) Christianity the official\nreligion of the Roman Empire, Augustine did not live in a\n\u201cmedieval\u201d Christian world. Pagan religious, cultural and\nsocial traditions were much alive in his congregation, as he often\ndeplores in his sermons, and his own cultural outlook was, like that\nof most of his learned upper-class contemporaries, shaped by the\nclassical Latin authors, poets and philosophers whom he studied in the\nschools of grammar and rhetoric long before he encountered the Bible\nand Christian writers. Throughout his work he engages with pre- and\nnon-Christian philosophy, much of which he knew from firsthand.\nPlatonism in particular remained a decisive ingredient of his thought.\nHe is therefore best read as a Christian philosopher of late antiquity\nshaped by and in constant dialogue with the classical tradition.\nTranslations from Greek or Latin texts in this entry are by the\nauthor, unless otherwise stated. Biblical quotations are translated\nfrom Augustine\u2019s Latin version; these may differ from the Greek\nor Hebrew original and/or from the Latin Vulgate.\n",
