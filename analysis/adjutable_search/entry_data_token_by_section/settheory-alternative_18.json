    "main_text": "Positive Set Theories || The system GPK\\(^{+}_{\\infty}\\) of Olivier Esser\n7.2 The system GPK\\(^{+}_{\\infty}\\) of Olivier Esser\n\nWe now present an axiomatic theory which has the\n\\(\\kappa\\)-hyperuniverses with \\(\\kappa \\gt \\omega\\) as (some of its)\nmodels. This is a first-order theory with equality and membership as\nprimitive relations. This system is called\nGPK\\(^{+}_{\\infty}\\) and is described in Esser 1999.\n\n\nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are the\nsame.\n\nGeneralized Positive Comprehension: For any\ngeneralized positive formula \\(\\phi , \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) exists.\n(Notice that since we view the false formula \\(\\bot\\) as positive we\nneed no special axiom asserting the existence of the empty set).\n\nClosure: For any formula \\(\\phi(x)\\), there is a set\n\\(C\\) such that \\(x \\in C \\equiv [\\forall y\\forall z(\\phi(z)\n\\rightarrow z \\in y) \\rightarrow x \\in y\\)]; \\(C\\) is the intersection\nof all sets which include all objects which satisfy \\(\\phi : C\\) is\ncalled the closure of the class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\).\n\nInfinity: The closure of the von Neumann ordinals is\nnot an element of itself. (This excludes the \\(\\omega\\)-hyperuniverse,\nin which the closure of the class of von Neumann ordinals has itself\nas an additional member).\n\n\nAs one might expect, some of the basic concepts of this set theory are\ntopological (sets being the closed classes of the topology on the\nuniverse).\n\nThis set theory interprets ZF. This is shown by demonstrating\nfirst that the discrete sets (and more particularly the (closed) sets\nof isolated points in the topology) satisfy an analogue of Replacement\n(a definable function (defined by a formula which need not be\npositive) with a discrete domain is a set), and so an analogue of\nseparation, then by showing that well-founded sets are isolated in the\ntopology and the class of well-founded sets is closed under the\nconstructions of ZF.\n\nNot only ZF but also Kelley-Morse class theory can be\ninterpreted; any definable class of well-founded sets has a closure\nwhose well-founded members will be exactly the desired members (it\nwill as a rule have other, non-well-founded members). Quantification\nover these \u201cclasses\u201d defines sets just as easily as\nquantification over mere sets in this context; so we get an\nimpredicative class theory. Further, one can prove internally to this\ntheory that the \u201cproper class ordinal\u201d in the interpreted\n\\(KM\\) has the tree property, and so is in effect a weakly compact\ncardinal; this shows that this theory has considerable consistency\nstrength (for example, its version of ZF proves that there is\na proper class of inaccessible cardinals, a proper class of\n\\(n\\)-Mahlos for each \\(n\\), and so forth): the use of large cardinals\nin the outlined model construction above was essential.\n\nThe Axiom of Choice in any global form is inconsistent with this\ntheory, but it is consistent for all well-founded sets to be\nwell-orderable (in fact, this will be true in the models described\nabove if the construction is carried out in an environment in which\nChoice is true). This is sufficient for the usual mathematical\napplications.\n\nSince ZF is entirely immersed in this theory, it is clearly\nserviceable for the usual classical applications. The Frege natural\nnumbers are not definable in this theory (except for 0 and 1); it is\nbetter to work with the finite von Neumann ordinals. The ability to\nprove strong results about large cardinals using the properties of the\nproper class ordinal suggests that the superstructure of large sets\ncan be used for mathematical purposes as well. Familiarity with\ntechniques of topology of \\(\\kappa\\)-compact spaces would be useful\nfor understanding what can be done with the big sets in this\ntheory.\n\nWith the negation of the Axiom of Infinity, we get the theory of the\n\\(\\omega\\)-hyperuniverse, which is equiconsistent with second-order\narithmetic, and so actually has a fair amount of mathematical\nstrength. In this theory, the class of natural numbers (considered as\nfinite ordinals) is not closed and acquires an extra element \u201cat\ninfinity\u201d (which happens to be the closure of the class of\nnatural numbers itself). Individual real numbers can be coded (using\nthe usual Dedekind construction, actually) but the theory of sets of\nreal numbers will begin to look quite different.\n",
