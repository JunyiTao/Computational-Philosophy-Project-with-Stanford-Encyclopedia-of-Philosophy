    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Deliberation about Ends\n4.6 Deliberation about Ends\n\nThe topics of value incommensurability and incomparability also arise\nin accounts that concern deliberation about ends. This section\ndiscusses two accounts.\n\nThe first account is by Henry Richardson (1994). Richardson argues for\nthe possibility of rational deliberation about ends. According to\nRichardson, if comparability is a prerequisite for rational choice,\nchoices involving conflicting values could be made rationally if each\nof the values were expressed in terms of their contribution to\nfurthering some common end. This conception of choice treats this\ncommon end as the one final end relevant for the choice. According to\nRichardson, the idea that comparability is a prerequisite for rational\nchoice seems to rule out rational deliberation about ends (1994,\n15).\n\nRichardson defends an account of rational deliberation about ends that\ndoes not depend upon comparability. In his account, rational\ndeliberation involves achieving coherence among one\u2019s ends.\nBriefly, coherence is \u201ca matter of finding or constructing\nintelligible connections or links or mutual support among them and of\nremoving relations of opposition or conflict\u201d (Richardson 1994,\n144). For Richardson, coherence among ends need not result in their\nbeing comparable (1994, 180).\n\nThe second account is by Elijah Millgram (1997). Like Richardson,\nMillgram argues that comparability is not a prerequisite for\ndeliberation. However, in contrast to Richardson, Millgram argues that\npractical deliberation results in the comparability of ends (1997,\n151). By this he means that through deliberation, one develops a\ncoherent conception of what matters and a \u201cbackground against\nwhich one can judge not only that one consideration is more important\nthan another, but how much more important\u201d (1997, 163).\nFor Millgram, comparing one\u2019s ends is a \u201ccentral part of\nattaining unified agency\u201d (1997, 162).\n\nMillgram proposes two ways in which deliberation results in the\ncomparability of ends. The first proposal is that one can learn what\nis important and how it is important through experience (1997, 161).\nThe second proposal is that deliberation about ends is\n\u201csomething like the construction by the agent of a conception of\nwhat matters \u2026 out of raw materials such as desires, ends,\npreferences, and reflexes\u201d (1997, 168). Millgram identifies an\nobjection to each proposal and briefly responds to each.\n\nThe objection to the first proposal is this. If the incomparability of\nends can be resolved by experience, this suggests that the judgment of\nincomparability reflects incomplete knowledge about the values\nexpressed in these ends. In other words, experience seems to help only\nif the values expressed in these ends are themselves comparable (1997,\n168). Millgram responds as follows. The agent who uses her experience\nto develop a coherent conception of what matters is like the painter\nwho uses her experience to paint a picture that is not a copy of an\nexisting image. Even if the ends are comparable in her conception of\nwhat matters, the values they reflect need not be comparable just as\nthe painting need not be an exact copy of an existing image.\n\nThe objection to the second proposal is this. The second proposal\nsuggests that deliberation is not driven by experience, which places\nit in tension with the first proposal. Millgram responds by continuing\nthe analogy with the painter. Imagine a painter who paints a picture\nthat is not a copy of an existing image. Just because the painting is\nnot a copy of an existing image does not mean there is no source of\ncorrection and constraint on it. Similarly, deliberation may involve\nthe construction by the agent of a conception of what matters, but\nthis does not imply that it is not informed or constrained by\nexperience (1997, 168\u2013169).\n",
