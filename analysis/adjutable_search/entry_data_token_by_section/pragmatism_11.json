    "main_text": "Further pragmatists || Neopragmatism\n5.2 Neopragmatism\n\nWhere Peirce and Dewey\u2014and even perhaps James\u2014were engaged\nin working out systematic philosophical visions, Rorty treated\n\u2018pragmatism\u2019 as a more critical or therapeutic\nphilosophical project. What pragmatists teach us about truth,\nhe tells us, is that there is nothing very systematic or constructive\nto be said about it. In particular, the concept does not capture any\nmetaphysical relation between our beliefs and utterances, on the one\nhand, and reality on the other. We can describe what we do with\nthe word \u2018true\u2019: we use it to express our endorsement of\nbeliefs and sentences, and sometimes we might find it useful to\nexpress our fallibility by saying that some of our beliefs may not be\ntrue. (Rorty calls this the \u2018cautionary\u2019 use of the term.)\nBut, beyond talking about the rather trivial formal properties of the\nconcept, there is nothing more to be said. He also uses what he\ndescribes as a \u2018pragmatist\u2019 principle to show that truth\ncannot be our aim when we inquire. This principle holds that we can\nonly adopt something as an aim when we are able to recognize that it\nhas been achieved. And since we are fallible, we are never in a\nposition to prove that one of our beliefs is actually true\u2014all\nwe can recognize is that it meets standards of acceptance that are\nendorsed, for the time being, in our community (Rorty 1991a: chapter\none; 2000; Hookway 2007). This consequentialist reading of pragmatist\nideas is also reflected in his account of how we can criticize and\nrevise our view of the world. We should be free to propose new\n\u2018vocabularies\u2019\u2014systems of classification and\ndescription. We do not test these vocabularies by seeing whether they\nenable us to discover truths or by showing that they can be\nread off the nature of reality. Instead, we evaluate them by seeing\nhow they enable us to achieve our current goals, formulate better and\nmore satisfying goals, and generally become better at being human\n(Rorty 1995).\n\nHilary Putnam has at times denied that he is a pragmatist because he\ndoes not think that a pragmatist account of truth can be sustained.\nIndeed, he shows little sympathy for the pragmatic maxim. However, he\nhas written extensively on James, Peirce, and Dewey\u2014often in\ncollaboration with Ruth Anna Putnam\u2014and has provided insightful\naccounts of what is distinctive about pragmatism, and what can be\nlearned from it (See Putnam 1994a). He has identified four\ncharacteristics of pragmatism: the rejection of skepticism; the\nwillingness to embrace fallibilism; the rejection of sharp dichotomies\nsuch as those between fact and value, thought and experience, mind and\nbody, analytic and synthetic etc; and what he calls \u2018the primacy\nof practice\u2019 (1994c). With the turn of the twenty first century,\nhe made ambitious claims for the prospects of a pragmatist\nepistemology. After surveying the apparent failures of the original\nenlightenment project, and attributing them to the fact that\nenlightenment philosophers were unable to overcome the fundamental\ndichotomies mentioned above, he expresses the hope that the future\nmight contain a \u2018pragmatist enlightenment\u2019 (Putnam\n2004:89\u2013108). The rich understanding of experience and science\noffered by pragmatists may show us how to find an objective basis for\nthe evaluation and criticism of institutions and practices. He is\nparticularly struck by the suggestion that pragmatist epistemology, by\nemphasizing the communal character of inquiry and the need to take\naccount of the experiences and contributions of other inquirers,\nprovides a basis for a defence of democratic values (1993:\n180\u2013202). This may be related to Rorty\u2019s suggestion that\npragmatists insist upon the priority of democracy over philosophy\n(Rorty 1991b).\n\nAnother symptom of a pragmatist revival is found in the work of Robert\nBrandom. Brandom\u2019s philosophical interests are rather different\nfrom those of the classical pragmatists, of whom he is quite critical\n(Brandom 2011), and who do not noticeably influence his work. His\nviews owe more to philosophers such as Wilfrid Sellars and Quine, his\nteacher Richard Rorty, and historical readings in thinkers such as\nKant and Hegel. As noted above, his concerns are mostly with semantics\nand the philosophy of language. By contrast to the representationalism\ndeplored by many neopragmatists, he develops a version of\ninferentialist semantics in order to construct accounts of our\nuse of words like \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018refers to\u2019 which\nare liberated from the idea that the function of thought and language\nis \u2018to provide a transcript of reality\u2019. The connection to\npragmatism is that his approach to language is focused upon what we\ndo with our practices of making assertions and challenging or\nevaluating the assertions of others. What constitutes an assertion is\nits normative pragmatics: it is the smallest unit of language\nfor which we can take responsibility within a \u2018game of giving\nand asking for reasons\u2019. Logical relations are then explicated\nin terms of the entitlements to make further moves in this\n\u2018language-game\u2019, which flow from the commitments one has\nassumed through one\u2019s previous assertions (Brandom 1994; Brandom\n2000). Brandom also joins the pragmatists in denying that\ntruth is a substantial metaphysical property that can be\npossessed by some propositions and not by others, and in seeking to\nreconstructing an account of reference which makes a difference in\npractice (his favored strategy is, broadly, explaining\nlanguage-users\u2019 capacity to perform anaphora). In (Brandom 2008)\nhe goes further to discuss how different vocabularies understood\npragmatically might be translated into\u2014 or reduced to\u2014 one\nanother, thereby constructing an overall account of the relationship\nbetween \u2018saying\u2019 and \u2018doing\u2019 that he hopes\nwill form a basis for reintegrating analytic and pragmatist\nphilosophy. \n\nAnother notable recent foray into pragmatist-inspired normative\npragmatics is found in the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a philosopher\nfrom the Frankfurt School who has engaged with unparalleled breadth\nacross the landscape of 20th century philosophy. He manages to combine\nanalytic philosophers\u2019 goal of systematically theorising\nlanguage with a neo-Marxian and hermeneutic critique of modernity,\nwhilst drawing on Mead\u2019s pragmatist analysis of the self as\nirremediably social. His central concept of communicative\naction (Habermas 1981) is advocated as a foil to the\ninstrumentalist rationality that he takes to be rampantly colonising\nthe human \u2018lifeworld\u2019 in the West. The discourse ethics\n which he develops in order to scaffold an authentic communicative\naction that is free from the distortions of power and ideology owes\nmuch to pragmatism\u2019s concept of the community of inquiry,\nalthough he is sceptical of Peirce\u2019s inquiry-based analysis of\ntruth as overly idealised (Habermas 2003). With major contributions in\npolitical philosophy, ethics, philosophy of law, aesthetics and\nphilosophy of religion, amongst other areas, Habermas\u2019 influence\nhas reached far into the social sciences \u2013 something Dewey would\nlikely have approved. \n",
