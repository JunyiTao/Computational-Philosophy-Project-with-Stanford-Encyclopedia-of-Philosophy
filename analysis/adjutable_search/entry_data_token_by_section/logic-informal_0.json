    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nPuppo 2019\n provides a recent collection of articles on the history of informal\nlogic and the issues it addresses. In many ways, informal logic as we\nknow it is a contemporary version of historical attempts to explain,\nsystematize, assess and teach arguing for practical purposes. \n\nIn ancient times, the First Sophistic is a movement motivated by the\nnotion that one can teach the art of logos in a way that can\nbe effectively employed in public argument and debate. In the century\nthat follows, Aristotle\u2019s logical and rhetorical works \u2014\nnotably the Prior Analytics and the Rhetoric \u2014\nprovide a systematic account of logic and argument which is applicable\nto an impressively broad range of real life arguments. Today, they\nremain important works that inform discussions of informal logic. \n\nIn modern times, The Port Royal Logic (Arnauld and Nicole\n1662, originally titled Logic or the Art of Thinking) is an\nattempt to outline a logic that can guide everyday reasoning. It is a\ncelebrated (and often disdained) introduction to the art of arguing\nwhich has been published in more than fifty French editions and five\npopular English translations. It understands \u201clogic\u201d as\n\u201cthe art of directing reason aright, in obtaining the knowledge\nof things, for the instruction both of ourselves and others\u201d\n(25). In keeping with this, it provides a practical account of good\nand poor argument, discussing fallacies, syllogisms, definitions, and\ndeductive and probable reasoning, emphasizing real rather than\nconcocted examples of argument (see Finocchiaro 1997). \n\nOne finds other analogues of contemporary attempts to study and teach\ninformal reasoning in nineteenth century textbooks on logic and\nrhetoric. Richard Whately is of special note in this regard. He began\nhis career as a professor of political economy at Oxford, was\nappointed Archbishop of Dublin, and attempted to establish a national\nnon-sectarian system of education, writing texts on reasoning that\ncould promote this cause. In many ways, Whately\u2019s\n Elements of Logic\n and Elements of Rhetoric (1826, 1830) are close analogues of\nearly versions of today\u2019s informal logic textbooks. \n\nAnother important text, critical of Whately, but in the same broad\ntradition is Mill\u2019s A System of Logic  (1882) (see\nGodden 2014). It defines logic as the \u201cart and science of\nreasoning,\u201d stipulating that \u201cto reason is simply to infer\nany assertion from assertions already admitted.\u201d The end result\nis a broad account of inference which is, like systems of informal\nlogic, designed to inform real life instances of argument. \n\nThe first use of the term \u201cinformal logic\u201d occurs in the\nlast chapter of Gilbert Ryle\u2019s book Dilemmas (1954). He\nintroduces it in an attempt to distinguish between formal logic and\nthe more varied, less strict, and less defined ways in which we need\nto assess many of the arguments that are used in philosophical\ndiscussion. \n\nIn North America, the rise of informal logic as it is now understood\nis tied to educational trends rooted in the 1960s \u2014 a time of\nsocial upheaval and protest (most notably, against the War in Vietnam)\nwhich produced calls for an education relevant to the issues of the\nday. This fueled an interest in the logic of everyday argument and the\nteaching of introductory logic, which was at the time taught with\ntextbooks like Copi\u2019s popular Introduction to Logic\n(1953). \n\nIn Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday\nLife (1971), Kahane more fully embraced instances of real life\narguing, discussing a wide range of examples in newspapers, the mass\nmedia, advertisements, books, and political campaigns. Other attempts\nto provide a general introduction to logic \u2014 by Carney and\nScheer (1964), Munson (1976), and Fogelin (1978) \u2014 employed the\nterm \u201cinformal logic\u201d to distinguish between formal logic\nand other methods of argument analysis which lay outside of it. \n\nThe idea that informal logic should be developed as a distinct field\nof inquiry was championed by Johnson and Blair at the University of\nWindsor. They published a popular textbook, Logical\nSelf-Defense (1977); organized and hosted \u201cThe First\nInternational Symposium on Informal Logic\u201d and edited the\nproceedings (Blair and Johnson, 1980); established the Informal\nLogic Newsletter (1978-1983); and ultimately turned the\nnewsletter into the journal Informal Logic (subtitled\n\u201cReasoning and Argumentation in Theory and Practice\u201d). In\nthis and other ways, they established informal logic as a field for\nstudy, research and development. Their contributions (and those of\ncolleagues at Windsor and in Ontario and Canada) is reflected in the\nnotion that informal logic is a Canadian (or, more narrowly, Windsor)\nschool of argument (see Puppo 2019). \n\nMuch of the discussion that has shaped the evolution of informal logic\nas a field has taken place in a number of journals that have played a\nmajor role in its development. They include Informal Logic,\nArgumentation, Philosophy and Rhetoric,\nArgumentation and Advocacy (formerly the Journal of the\nAmerican Forensic Association), Teaching Philosophy, and\n(more recently) Cogency and Argument and\nComputation. \n\nA key catalyst that promoted the development of informal logic was the\n\u201cCritical Thinking\u201d Movement within education (well\ndescribed in Siegel 1988, Ennis 2011, and Blair 2021). The movement\npushed (and continues to push) for educational developments which make\nthe critical scrutiny of our beliefs and assumptions a fundamental\ngoal, highlighting the significance of reasoning, inference, argument\nand critical assessment. \n\nIn 1980, a California State University Executive Order promoted the\nteaching of critical thinking and informal logic by requiring post\nsecondary institutions to include formal instruction in critical\nthinking in their curriculum. According to the order:\n\u201cInstruction in critical thinking is to be designed to achieve\nan understanding of the relationship of language to logic, which\nshould lead to the ability to analyze, criticize, and advocate ideas,\nto reason inductively and deductively and to reach factual or\njudgmental conclusions based on sound inferences drawn from\nunambiguous statements of knowledge or belief\u201d (Dumke 1980,\nExecutive Order 338). \n\nThe accounts of argument that informal logic and the Critical Thinking\nmovement provide are tied to pedagogical attempts to teach students\nand learners how to reason well. One result has been hundreds (perhaps\nthousands) of introductory textbooks used to teach logic, critical\nthinking, and argumentation skills to university and college students\nin Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland,\nChile, and other countries. \n\nTextbooks in English offer many theoretical and pedagogical\ninnovations. Established texts include Battersby 2016 (Is That a\nFact? A Field Guide for Evaluating Statistical and Scientific\nInformation, 2nd ed.); Bowell and Kemp 2014 (Critical\nThinking: A Concise Guide, 4th ed.); Browne and Keeley 2018\n(Asking the Right Questions, 12th ed.); Govier 2019 (A\nPractical Study of Argument, 7th ed.); Groarke, Tindale and\nCarozza 2021 (Good Reasoning Matters!, 7th ed.); Hughes,\nLavery and Doran 2014 (Critical Thinking: An Introduction to the\nBasic Skills, 7th ed.); Seay and Nuccetelli 2012 (How to\nThink Logically, 2nd ed.); Weston 2018 (A Rulebook for\nArguments, 5th ed.); and Wilson 2020 (A Guide to Good\nReasoning: Cultivating Intellectual Virtues, 2nd ed.). \n\nIn Poland, Ajdukiewicz\u2019s Pragmatic Logic (1974) is an\nintroduction to an independently developed \u201cpragmatic\nlogic\u201d which shares similar goals, teaching and promoting tools\nof logic as a central element of a general education. Its application\naims to ensure that students think clearly and consistently, express\ntheir thoughts and ideas systematically and precisely, and justify\ntheir claims with proper inferences (see Koszowy 2010). \n\nIn part because reasoning and argument are ubiquitous and of interest\nacross many disciplines, informal logic has in many ways been\ninfluenced by cognate fields which analyze argumentation in some way.\nThe latter include formal logic, speech communication, rhetoric,\nlinguistics, artificial intelligence, discourse analysis, feminism,\nsemiotics, cognitive psychology, and computational modelling.\nConsidered in this broader context, informal logic is a subfield of a\nbroader multi-disciplinary attempt to develop a comprehensive account\nof real life arguing which is commonly called \u201cargumentation\ntheory.\u201d \n\nInformal logic and argumentation theory have been highlighted at\nnumerous international conferences hosted by organizations committed\nto the study of argument. Key conferences include nine Amsterdam\nconferences (and a tenth conference in Zhenjiang) hosted by the\nInternational Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA); twelve\nWindsor conferences hosted by the Ontario Society for the Study of\nArgumentation (OSSA); six Tokyo Conferences on Argumentation hosted by\nthe Japanese Debate Association; three meetings of the European\nConference on Argumentation (ECA); eight meetings of the International\nConference on Computational Models of Argument (hosted by COMMA), and\nmany workshops on issues of argumentation, dialogue, and persuasion\norganized by the Polish group ArgDiaP. \n1.1 Formal and Informal Logic\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the early development of informal\nlogic was a desire for a logic which contained tools of analysis and\nassessment above and beyond the standard formal methods of the day:\npropositional logic, truth tables, syllogisms, the predicate calculus,\nand so on. Johnson emphasizes a \u201cdissatisfaction with formal\nlogic as the vehicle for teaching skill in argument evaluation and\nargument formation\u201d and a \u201cdesire to provide a complete\ntheory of reasoning that goes beyond formal deductive and inductive\nlogic\u201d (2014, p. 11). Though Ryle never developed a detailed\naccount of what he meant by \u201cinformal logic,\u201d his comments\npoint in a similar direction. \n\nPhilosophers and logicians teaching general courses on argument have\noften managed the issues that this raises by mixing formal and\ninformal methods of analysis. Though the artificial examples of\nargument that characterize early editions of Copi (and some other\ntexts that emphasize formal logic) have been roundly criticized (see\nJohnson 1996 and Blair 2015), other authors more successfully meld\nclassical formal logic and examples of real argument. Harrison 1969 is\nan example. So are the texts of Pospesel, which contain many examples\nof real life reasoning which illustrate the patterns of inference\nassociated with propositional and syllogistic logic (Pospesel and\nMarans 1978, Rodes and Pospesel 1991, and Pospesel 2002). Little 1980\ndevelops an approach to critical thinking and decision making that\nintegrates propositional and syllogistic reasoning. \n\nSome informal logicians moved in an opposite direction, developing\nversions of informal logic that were independent of formal logic,\nappealing to alternative accounts of argument borrowed from or\ninfluenced by philosophical reflection, or by other fields that study\nargument (notably, rhetoric, dialectics, and speech communication).\nToulmin\u2019s The Uses of Argument (1958) and\nHamblin\u2019s Fallacies (1970) became theoretical\ntouchstones for those looking for an informal logic rooted outside of\nformal logic. \n\nEven in these latter cases, systems and accounts of informal logic\nshared some core notions with their formal cousins. Most\nsignificantly, formal and informal logic assume (i) a premise,\ninference, and conclusion conception of argument; (ii) the notion that\na good argument has premises which are true (or\n\u201cacceptable\u201d) and a conclusion which follows from them\n(making the inference the argument depends on \u201cvalid\u201d in\nsome way); and (iii) the idea that many arguments can be assessed by\ntreating them as instances of more generalized forms of argument\n(\u201cschemes of argument\u201d which include standard deductive\npatterns of reasoning). \n\nToday, informal logic is \u201cinformal\u201d rather than\n\u201cformal\u201d primarily because it studies arguments as they\noccur in natural language discourse, and not in formal languages of\nthe sort that characterize formal logic. The latter are notable for\ntheir rigorously defined syntax, semantics, and grammar, and precisely\ndefined proof procedures. In contrast, arguments as they occur in real\nlife discourse are notable for their use of everyday language; for the\nmany different norms that apply to them in different contexts; and for\nthe diverse ways of making meaning (using pictures, facial\nexpressions, non-verbal sounds, music, etc.) that they employ. \n\nThe emphasis that informal logic and its historical precursors place\non natural language argument is in keeping with the social and\npedagogical goals that motivate their development. The latter are best\nserved by an easily understood, broadly disseminated, understanding of\nthe difference between strong and weak instances of real life\nargument. Formal methods (Venn diagrams, probability theory \u2014\nsee Zenker 2013, different kinds of formal logic, etc.) can at times\nsupport this goal, especially in analyses of particular kinds of\nargument, but the overriding aim is natural language discourse guided\nby the principles of successful reasoning. \n1.2 Argumentation Theory\n\nArgumentation theory is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies\nreal life argument. Developments in argumentation theory have been\ngreatly influenced by formal and informal logic; pragma-dialectics\n(developed by van Eemeren and Grootendorst and their Dutch or\n\u201cAmsterdam\u201d school of argumentation); the Critical\nThinking Movement; American speech communication; rhetoric;\npragmatics; and the Polish School of Argument (which has published a\nrelevant\n manifesto).\n In its attempt to understand argument, argumentation theory does not\nhesitate to make use of these and other related disciplines: cognitive\npsychology, computational modeling, semiotics, discourse analysis, the\nhistory of art, AI, and so on. \n\nAbove and beyond their study of general methods of argument analysis,\nargumentation theorists investigate arguments in a variety of ways: by\nexploring particular aspects of arguing (e.g., onus, burden of proof,\nor the norms that govern arguments in specific contexts); by analyzing\narguments from historical, social, political or feminist points of\nview; by studying particular kinds of argument (e.g., those expressed\nin works of art, or those that arise in specific legal contexts); and\nby investigating the assumptions, conditions (philosophical,\nepistemological, social, political, institutional, psychological,\neducational, etc.) which give rise to disagreement, arguing and\nargument in the first place. In many ways, such endeavors intersect\nwith informal logic. \n\nTheoretically, argumentation theory incorporates three approaches to\nargument that have been associated with logic, rhetoric, and\ndialectics since ancient times. Logic understands an argument as an\nattempt to justify a conclusion, emphasizing its probative or\nepistemic merit. Rhetoric treats an argument as an attempt to\npersuade, emphasizing its persuasive force. Dialectics understands an\nargument as an element of an exchange between interlocutors with\nopposing points of view, emphasizing its place in an interaction\nbetween arguers who argue back and forth. \n\nLike other forms of logic, informal logic emphasizes the epistemic\nmerit of an argument. That said, its development has been greatly\ninfluenced by rhetorical and dialectical considerations, for\nsuccessful real life arguments must convince their intended audiences\n(the public, scientists, the Members of Parliament, the readers of a\nparticular magazine, etc.) and (as Johnson 2000 emphasizes) include\nanswers to reasonable objections made by those with opposing points of\nview. Bermejo Luque 2011 has proposed a relevant theory of argument\nwhich aims to accommodate logical, rhetorical and dialectical points\nof view. \n",
