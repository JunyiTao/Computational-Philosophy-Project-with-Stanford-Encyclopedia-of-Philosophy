    "main_text": "Objections to Rigidity || Objections to Rigidity in General\n4.2 Objections to the Application of Rigidity to Terms for Kinds and Properties\n\nBoth Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975) famously extend the notion of\nrigidity to terms for natural kinds. Here controversy has\nensued. Let us begin with a singular term as an example; general terms\nintroduce additional complications (for discussion, see Linsky 1984;\nSoames 2002; Salmon 2003; 2005).\n\nWhat is rigidly designated by a kind term like \u2018Apis\nmellifera\u2019? Apparently it can not rigidly designate a\nscattered object comprised of all particular honeybees, say, since\nthose honeybees that presently go about their work might not have\nexisted. And others that do not exist might have existed instead (but\ncontroversy and complications attend this observation: see, e.g.,\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006; Zouhar 2009, p. 211). To be rigid, a term\nhas to designate the same thing in all possible worlds.\n\nSome philosophers have proposed that \u2018Apis\nmellifera\u2019 rigidly designates an abstract object, a kind or\nproperty. One might say that \u2018Apis mellifera\u2019\ndesignates the honeybee kind in every possible world: it\nnever designates any other kind, like the bumblebee kind, say. That\nmight be said to make the term rigid. Something similar could be said\nfor \u2018water\u2019, \u2018heat\u2019, and\n\u2018redness\u2019. But a number of objections have been\nissued.\n\nOne broad sort of objection, if it should be called that, is that\nrigidity does, in some respect, the work attributed to it; but\nrigidity is superfluous to the task of explaining that work because\nthe work is the result of other, more fundamental phenomena (for\ndifferent approaches along these lines, see Jylkk\u00e4 2008, pp.\n69\u201372; Schwartz 2002; Soames 2002, e.g., pp. 310\u201311). For all this objection tells, rigidity might remain interesting as a special case of more fundamental phenomena.  More damaging for property rigidity would be its rejection in favor of competing mechanisms alleged to do comparable work (Haukioja 2012; Nimtz 2019).\n\nAn objection more specifically directed toward efforts at extending\nrigidity to expressions for just kinds and properties, is that such\nefforts would also have to extend the status of rigidity to terms for\nartificial kinds or properties (see, e.g., Gl\u00fcer and Pagin\n2011; Haukioja 2012; Nimtz 2019; Schwartz 2002; 2018; 2020; whether this vast application of rigidity should be thought problematic might be questioned:  see e.g., Salmon 2005). The singular terms \u2018soda\npop\u2019, \u2018bachelorhood\u2019, \u2018livestock\u2019 and so\non, would also seem to designate an abstract object rigidly (soda\npop, bachelorhood, livestock, respectively), if terms for natural\nkinds and natural properties do so. So the foregoing proposal for the\nrigidity of kind and property terms might be thought to be too\nindiscriminate in what it allows to be rigid\u2014maybe even so\nindiscriminate that it mistakes sameness of meaning across\npossible worlds, which every meaningful expression enjoys, for\nsameness of designation, which only rigid designators are\nsupposed to have (Schwartz 2002, p. 272; 2020, p. 263n.). \n\nThe basic objection here to our counting certain singular terms\nto be rigid designators for properties might also tell against\ncounting certain general terms to be rigid designators. The\nthesis under fire is that according to which certain general terms\nrigidly designate properties, by virtue of designating the right\nproperty in every possible world. So according to this thesis,\n\u2018watery\u2019, like its singular variant \u2018water\u2019,\nis rigid by virtue of designating water with respect to every possible\nworld: and something similar can be said for \u2018honeybee\u2019,\n\u2018hot\u2019, and \u2018green\u2019. Again, the relevant\nobjection would be that if the foregoing general terms were rigid for\nthat reason, then something similar could be said for general terms\nthat cut more artificially, like \u2018bachelor\u2019; and that is\nsupposed to be a problem. \n\nA second group of objections to extending rigid status to expressions\nfor properties specifically (just tacitly include kinds with\nproperties\u2014kinds are often counted as a sort of property)\ncenters around the idea that the proposal seems committed to\nsubstantive metaphysical positions about abstract objects like kinds\nor properties, concerning which a theory of language ought to remain\nneutral (Devitt 2005; Haukioja 2006; Mart\u00ed 1998, p. 487). For\nexample, the proposal seems committed to rejecting nominalism. Some\ndefenders of property terms\u2019 rigidity are happy so to commit (Linsky\n1984). Other defenders of property terms\u2019 rigidity seek ways of\naccommodating nominalism (Mart\u00ed 1998). \n\nEven if we are happy to commit to properties, problems remain. Just as\na paucity of properties can create problems (nominalism), so can a\nplenum of properties. We\u2019ve already seen that expressions for\nartificial kinds and properties like \u2018livestock\u2019 might\ncreate troubles. There\u2019s a different sort of problem raised by\nstill-more artificial properties: a worry arises that allegedly\nnon-rigid designators for properties always end up rigidly\ndesignating some gruesome relational property or other in the plenum.\nConsider \u2018the biological species typically farmed for\nhoney\u2019, which we might initially be inclined to take for a\nnonrigid designator of Apis mellifera. \u201cIn virtue of\nwhat,\u201d as Devitt would ask (2005, p. 154; see also 2009, p.\n240), does such an expression \u201cnonrigidly designate that,\u201d\ni.e., Apis mellifera, rather than rigidly designate the property\nbeing the biological species typically farmed for honey? This\nproblem has been much discussed. Whether indeed there is a problem\nhere might depend on whether expressions for properties are singular\nterms or whether they are predicative. Arguably the problem is more\ntractable for singular terms than for thoroughly predicative terms,\nwhich seem especially unaccommodating. \n\nFor related reasons, most workers reject any rigid\u2013nonrigid\ndistinction for purely predicative expressions. That would include\n\u2018green\u2019 and \u2018honeybee\u2019, on a\nnominalist\u2019s approach according to which there is no property to\ndesignate and on some realist approaches, too, such as a Fregean\napproach according to which properties exist but cannot be named.\nOther still-more widely accepted candidates for purely predicative\nstatus would be the predicates \u2018is green\u2019, and \u2018is a\nhoneybee\u2019. \n\n\u2018Green\u2019 and \u2018honeybee\u2019 are weaker candidates\nfor purely predicative status than are predicates containing them,\nbecause according to a now-popular view, \u2018green\u2019 or\n\u2018honeybee\u2019 is \u201csingular\u201d in a broad\nsense. That popular view recognizes a \u201c\u2018singular\noccurrence\u2019 of a general term\u201d like \u2018green\u2019\n(Inan 2008, p.227), so that those holding the view do not count\n\u2018green\u2019 to be \u201cpurely predicative\u201d in the\nstrict respect of the foregoing paragraph, even though they might for\nall that count the containing expression \u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 as\npurely predicative (e.g., Soames counts\n\u2018green\u2019/\u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 as singular/predicative\nrespectively), and such theorists might accordingly apply the\nrigid\u2013nonrigid distinction to the singular \u2018green\u2019\nbut not to \u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 (Soames 2010, pp. 90\u201391; 2006, p.\n712; see also Robertson 2009, p. 136n.23). \n\nHow could \u2018green\u2019, a general term, have singular status\ntoo? According to the most commonly cited (but not the only)\nsuggestion along these lines, although general terms are not\nfirst-order singular terms\u2014on the contrary, they\u2019re\ngeneral terms precisely by virtue of being first-order\ngeneral terms\u2014they are higher-order singular terms\n(Linsky 1984; Salmon 2003; 2005). \n\nA few workers maintain both that there are purely predicative general\nterms and that some of them, like \u2018honeybee\u2019, are rigid.\nAccording to a now-familiar suggestion along these lines, what makes\nthe application of a general term F rigid is that any item x to\nwhich the term applies, in any possible world, is part of the\nextension of F in all worlds in which x exists, x\nbeing an F essentially (Cook 1980; Devitt 2005; Devitt and\nSterelny 1999, pp. 85\u20136; G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006). This\nnotion of rigid application might hold some attraction for someone\nbothered by the objections just mentioned against the view that terms\nrigidly designate properties. It would appear that terms for natural\nkinds but not artificial ones come out rigid: thus,\n\u2018honeybee\u2019 is rigid because any particular honeybee is\nessentially a honeybee and could not have been something else like a\ndragonfly or a fir tree instead. But \u2018livestock\u2019 does not\napply rigidly according to this account because animals that are\nlivestock are not essentially so. Neither does \u2018(is a member of\nthe-/the-) species typically farmed for honey\u2019 apply rigidly\naccording to this account. Furthermore, the account appears to be open\nto nominalism (about properties): nominalists recognize the legitimate\napplication of general terms. \n\nHowever, even if rigid application evades the above difficulties, it\nhas its limitations. One commonly noted problem is this: consider\nidentity statements like \u2018Water = H2O\u2019, or \u2018Red\nlight = light with wavelength 680 nm\u2019. Rigidity is apparently\nsupposed to guarantee the necessity, in case of truth, of identity\nstatements like these. Typically, fans of rigid application rewrite\nidentity statements to have this form: \u2018Anything is (an)\nF if and only if it is (an) F\u2032\u2019. But many\nphilosophers, including proponents of rigid application, have pointed\nout that it could be the case for two general terms F and F\u2032\nthat, (i) necessarily, every F is essentially F and\nevery F\u2032 is essentially F\u2032, so that F and\nF\u2032 are rigid appliers and (ii) in the actual world,\n\u2018Anything is F if and only if it is F\u2032\u2019 is true,\neven though (iii) God might have created an F that is not an\nF\u2032. In that event, \u2018Anything is F if and\nonly if it is F\u2032\u2019 comes out true with respect to\nthe actual world but not necessarily true (for an attempt to get\naround this difficulty, see G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006).\n\nApart from the foregoing minority suggestion of tying essentialism to\nrigidity, there has not been much done by way of articulating any\npurely predicative version of rigidity; again, prospects for any such\naccount are generally thought to be grim. There is however at least\none rival account of predicative rigidity to compete with the\nforegoing essentialism-centered account of predicative rigidity. The\nproposal follows a lead from Fregeans who recognize \u201cdefinite\nascriptions\u201d (Heintz 1973) for properties corresponding to\ndefinite descriptions for entities they are willing to name. Thus,\nGeach indicates that he would recognize a proper answer to the\nquestion \u201cwhat is the color of Antarctica?\u201d to be\n\u201cclouds, snow, etc.,\u201d or that an English statement like\nthe following is unobjectionable: \u201cHoneybees are the species\ntypically farmed for honey.\u201d In sentences like the\nforegoing, seemingly singular talk about an abstract entity, such as a\n\u201ccolor\u201d or a \u201cspecies,\u201d would have to be\ninterpreted as talk about concrete objects instead: clouds,\nbees, etc. (see, e.g., Anscombe and Geach 1961, pp. 155\u20136). Let\nus suppose, for the sake of argument, that expressions like\n\u2018white\u2019 and \u2018the color of Antarctica\u2019 are\npurely predicative, either because there are no properties to\ndesignate or because they cannot be designated by a singular\nexpression: still, the contrast between a typical one-word\npredicate like \u2018white\u2019 and the foregoing definite\nascription remains of interest for its bearing on the modal and\nepistemological status of biconditionals, in the ways relevant to\nrigidity, according to this line of thinking: compare \u2018Something\nis the color of Antarctica if and only if it is white\u2019 with\n\u2018Something is albescent if and only if it is white\u2019\n(understand \u2018albescent\u2019 as a synonym for\n\u2018white\u2019). That contrast suggests that we might articulate\nan account of rigidity that does not presuppose singular designation\nof any sort (Haze 2021; LaPorte 2013, chapter 5).\n",
