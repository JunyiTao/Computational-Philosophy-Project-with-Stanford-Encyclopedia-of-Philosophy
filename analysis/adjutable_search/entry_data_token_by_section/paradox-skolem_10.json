    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || The Multiverse\n3.3 The Multiverse\n\n\nOver the last decade, the set theorist Joel Hamkins has been arguing\nfor a conception of set theory which bears a surprising resemblance to\nthe traditional Skolemite position (though Hamkins' own motivations\nseem to come more from set theory itself than from the traditional\nphilosophical literature).  Hamkins notes that, as set theorists have\ndeveloped more and more powerful tools for constructing and comparing\ndifferent models of set theory\u2014forcing, inner model theory,\nlarge cardinal embeddings, etc.\u2014they have become less and less\nlikely to treat any particular model as cannonical.  Instead, set\ntheory has increasing come to focus on comparing different\nmodels of set theory, rather than singling out one model as\npriviledged.  Hamkins argues, therefore, that set theorists should\naccept what he calls a \u201cmultiverse\u201d conception of set\ntheory\u2014a conception in which no model of set theory is\nprivileged, and the purpose of set theory is simply to explore the\nrelations between the various models.\n\nThis multiverse conception is clearly related to the algebraic\nconception discussed in\nsections 3.1\u20133.2.\nFurther, it satisfies one of the key desiderata that we isolated in\nsection 3.2.  Hamkins defends the multiverse as an\nindependently plausible conception of set theory, and he argues that\nthe motivation for accepting it comes from within mathematical\npractice.  (I.e., Hamkins does not argue that, because forcing\nextensions are possible, we are stuck with\nset-theoretic relativity; rather, he argues that, because forcing\nextensions are natural, we should embrace\nset-theoretic relativity.)  In this sense, something like the\nmultiverse could well constitute the \u201cright\u201d way of\ndeveloping the algebraic conception.\n\nFurther, the multiverse conception leads naturally to the kinds of\nconclusions traditional Skolemites tended to favor.  Let a be\na set in some model M (where M lives\nsomewhere in the multiverse).  Then M has a forcing\nextension, M[G], in which a is only\ncountable.  This provides a natural gloss on the Skolemite claim that\n\u201cevery set is countable from some perspective.\u201d Similarly,\nthe Skolemite's bias in favor of countability (see\nsection 3.2) can be explained by the fact that,\nif a is countable in one model M, then it\nstays countable in all extensions of that model.  In contrast,\nuncountable sets can always be made countable by passing to an\nappropriate forcing extension.  For more on the multiverse, see\nHamkins 2011 and Hamkins 2012.  For some criticisms, see Koellner 2013 \n(under Other Internet Resources).\n",
