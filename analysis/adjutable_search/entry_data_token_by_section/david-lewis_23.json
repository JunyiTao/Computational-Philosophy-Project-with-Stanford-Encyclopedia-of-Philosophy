    "main_text": "Other Writings || Philosophy of Language\n7.2 Philosophy of Language\n\nLewis\u2019s major contribution to formal semantics was his theory of\ncounterfactual conditionals. But there were several other\ncontributions that he made, both on specific topics in formal\nsemantics, and on the role of semantic theory.\n\nIn \u201cAdverbs of Quantification\u201d (1975a), Lewis notes\nseveral difficulties in translating sentences involving\n\u201cusually\u201d, \u201cfrequently\u201d, \u201crarely\u201d\nor related adverbs into first-order logic or some similar formal\nsystem. Lewis\u2019s solution to the puzzles raised involves two\nformal advances. First, he treats the adverbs as unselective\nquantifiers, binding all free variables in their scope. The\nsecond advance concerns the if-clauses in sentences like Usually,\nif a team plays well, they win. It is difficult for various\nreasons to take the structure of this sentence to involve a quantifier\nover a compound sentence with a conditional connective. Lewis\u2019s\nsecond advance is to say that these if-clauses are simply domain\nrestrictors. The \u2018if\u2019 is no more a sentential connective\nthan the \u2018and\u2019 in New York is between Boston and\nWashington. Instead, the if-clause restricts what things the\nquantifier denoted by \u2018usually\u2019 ranges over.\n\nThis paper is not widely read by philosophers, but it has been very\ninfluential among linguists, especially semanticists. Indeed, its\nuptake by semanticists has made it the fourth most cited paper of\nLewis\u2019s on\n Google Scholar.\n His most cited paper on Google Scholar is also in philosophy of\nlanguage; it is \u201cScorekeeping in a Language Game\u201d\n(1979f).\n\nThat paper is about conversational dynamics. Lewis develops an\nextended analogy between the role of context in a conversation and the\nrole of score in a baseball game. One central role of the score is to\nkeep a record of what has already happened. In that way, score is\ninfluenced by what happens on the field, or in the conversation. But\nthe causal influence runs in the other way as well. Some events on the\nfield are influenced by the score. You\u2019re only out after the\nthird strike, for example. Similarly, Lewis holds that\ncontext (or the conversational score) can influence, or even be\npartially constitutive of, what happens in the conversation. If I say\n\u201cNone of the cats are afraid of Barney\u201d, which cats\nI\u2019ve managed to talk about depends on which cats are\nconversationally salient. And in saying this, I\u2019ve made Barney\nsalient, so the score changes in that respect. That change matters;\nnow I can denote Barney by \u201che\u201d.\n\nLewis argues that this model can make sense of a number of otherwise\npuzzling features of language. One notable example of this involves\nquantification. Most quantifiers we use do not range over the entire\nuniverse. We quantify only over a restricted range. Lewis says that it\nis the salient objects. He also says that this happens not just when\nwe explicitly quantify, but also when we use terms that have a\nquantificational analysis. He mentions in passing that\n\u201cknows\u201d might be one such term.\n\nThis idea is developed more fully in \u201cElusive Knowledge\u201d\n(1996b). Lewis argues that S knows that p is true iff\nS is in a position to rule out all possibilities in\nwhich p is false. But when we say S knows that p, we\ndon\u2019t mean to quantify over all possibilities there are, only\nover the salient possibilities. The big advantage of Lewis\u2019s\napproach is that it lets him explain the appeal of scepticism. When\nthe sceptic starts talking about fantastic possibilities of error, she\nmakes those possibilities salient. Since we can\u2019t rule them out,\nwhen we\u2019re talking to the sceptic we can\u2019t say we know\nvery much. But since those possibilities aren\u2019t usually salient,\nwe are usually correct in our knowledge-ascriptions. So Lewis lets the\nsceptic win any debate they are in, without conceding that ordinary\nknowledge-ascriptions are false.\n\nThe kind of position Lewis defends here, which came to be known as\n contextualism,\n has been a central focus of inquiry in epistemology for the last\nfifteen years. \u201cElusive Knowledge\u201d, along with papers such\nas Cohen (1986) and DeRose (1995) founded this research program.\n",
