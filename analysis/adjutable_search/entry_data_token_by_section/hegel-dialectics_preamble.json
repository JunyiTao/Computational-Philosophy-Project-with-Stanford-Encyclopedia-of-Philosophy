    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cDialectics\u201d is a term used to describe a method of\nphilosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory\nprocess between opposing sides. In what is perhaps the most classic\nversion of \u201cdialectics\u201d, the ancient Greek philosopher,\nPlato (see entry on\n Plato),\n for instance, presented his philosophical argument as a\nback-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character of\nSocrates, on one side, and some person or group of people to whom\nSocrates was talking (his interlocutors), on the other. In the course\nof the dialogues, Socrates\u2019 interlocutors propose definitions of\nphilosophical concepts or express views that Socrates challenges or\nopposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing sides produces a\nkind of linear progression or evolution in philosophical views or\npositions: as the dialogues go along, Socrates\u2019 interlocutors\nchange or refine their views in response to Socrates\u2019 challenges\nand come to adopt more sophisticated views. The back-and-forth\ndialectic between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomes\nPlato\u2019s way of arguing against the earlier, less sophisticated\nviews or positions and for the more sophisticated ones later.\n\n\u201cHegel\u2019s dialectics\u201d refers to the particular\ndialectical method of argument employed by the 19th Century German\nphilosopher, G.W.F. Hegel (see entry on\n Hegel),\n which, like other \u201cdialectical\u201d methods, relies on a\ncontradictory process between opposing sides. Whereas Plato\u2019s\n\u201copposing sides\u201d were people (Socrates and his\ninterlocutors), however, what the \u201copposing sides\u201d are in\nHegel\u2019s work depends on the subject matter he discusses. In his\nwork on logic, for instance, the \u201copposing sides\u201d are\ndifferent definitions of logical concepts that are opposed to one\nanother. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, which presents\nHegel\u2019s epistemology or philosophy of knowledge, the\n\u201copposing sides\u201d are different definitions of\nconsciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or\nclaims to know. As in Plato\u2019s dialogues, a contradictory process\nbetween \u201copposing sides\u201d in Hegel\u2019s dialectics leads\nto a linear evolution or development from less sophisticated\ndefinitions or views to more sophisticated ones later. The dialectical\nprocess thus constitutes Hegel\u2019s method for arguing against the\nearlier, less sophisticated definitions or views and for the more\nsophisticated ones later. Hegel regarded this dialectical method or\n\u201cspeculative mode of cognition\u201d (PR \u00a710) as the\nhallmark of his philosophy and used the same method in the\nPhenomenology of Spirit [PhG], as well as in all of the\nmature works he published later\u2014the entire Encyclopaedia of\nPhilosophical Sciences (including, as its first part, the\n\u201cLesser Logic\u201d or the Encyclopaedia Logic [EL]),\nthe Science of Logic [SL], and the Philosophy of\nRight [PR].\n\nNote that, although Hegel acknowledged that his dialectical method was\npart of a philosophical tradition stretching back to Plato, he\ncriticized Plato\u2019s version of dialectics. He argued that\nPlato\u2019s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claims\nand is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness (SL-M\n55\u20136; SL-dG 34\u20135; PR, Remark to \u00a731). According to\nthe logic of a traditional reductio ad absurdum argument, if\nthe premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must conclude\nthat the premises are false\u2014which leaves us with no premises or\nwith nothing. We must then wait around for new premises to spring up\narbitrarily from somewhere else, and then see whether those new\npremises put us back into nothingness or emptiness once again, if\nthey, too, lead to a contradiction. Because Hegel believed that reason\nnecessarily generates contradictions, as we will see, he thought new\npremises will indeed produce further contradictions. As he puts the\nargument, then, \n\n\nthe scepticism that ends up with the bare abstraction of nothingness\nor emptiness cannot get any further from there, but must wait to see\nwhether something new comes along and what it is, in order to throw it\ntoo into the same empty abyss. (PhG-M \u00a779) \n\n\nHegel argues that, because Plato\u2019s dialectics cannot get beyond\narbitrariness and skepticism, it generates only approximate truths,\nand falls short of being a genuine science (SL-M 55\u20136; SL-dG\n34\u20135; PR, Remark to \u00a731; cf. EL Remark to \u00a781). The\nfollowing sections examine Hegel\u2019s dialectics as well as these\nissues in more detail.\n",
