    "main_text": "Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism\n2. Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism\n\nHistorically, the starting point of ecological genetic research has\nbeen the discovery of variation within a natural population, i.e., a\nphenotypic polymorphism. The subsequent goal is three-fold: \n\n determination of whether or not the polymorphism has a genetic\ncomponent; \n determination of the frequency of each of the polymorphic types\nand their spatial and temporal variability; and, \ndetermination of how natural selection maintains the polymorphism,\neither alone or in combination with other evolutionary forces. \n\n\nFord defines genetic polymorphism as \n\n\n\u2026the occurrence together in the same locality of two or more\ndiscontinuous forms of a species in such proportions that the rarest\nof them cannot be maintained merely by recurrent mutation. (1975: 109;\nand see also Ford 1940) \n\n\nAlthough recurrent mutation can maintain a polymorphism indefinitely\nat mutation-selection balance, here Ford is clearly interested in a\nmore active role for natural selection in the maintenance of\npolymorphism. The first task was facilitated by early developments in\npopulation genetic theory, particularly the findings of Fisher (1930).\nFord interpreted these to mean that naturally occurring, discontinuous\nphenotypic variation is \u201cnearly always genetic\u201d. The\nreasoning stems from the theoretical findings that, in large\npopulations, it is unlikely that the positive and negative fitness\neffects of an allele (or chromosomal inversion) will be exactly\nbalanced. As a result, the number of individuals with a rare neutral\nmutation is proportional to the number of generations since its\norigin. Furthermore, if truly neutral, such alleles would spread so\nslowly through a large population by random genetic drift that the\n\n\n\ndelicate equipoise required for their neutrality will have been upset\nby changes in the environment and in the genetic outfit of the\norganism (Ford 1975: 110) \n\n\nbefore a neutral allele reached appreciable frequency. In addition,\nrecurrent mutation as a cause of persistent polymorphism was\nconsidered most unlikely and, in fact, this evolutionary cause is\nexplicitly excluded from the definition of genetic polymorphism by\nFord (see above). Hence, neutral genetic polymorphism was considered\nan exceptionally rare event by the founders of ecological genetics\nand, consequently, such polymorphisms were the hallmark of strong,\nactive natural selection.\n\nFord (1940) further distinguished two types of selective polymorphism,\ntransient polymorphism and balanced polymorphism. Transient\npolymorphism, caused by a new favorable mutation in the process\nof displacing its ancestral allele by natural selection, was\nconsidered unlikely, because \u201c\u2026advantageous genes will\nusually have been already incorporated into the genetic constitution\nof the species\u201d (Ford 1975: 110). This and statements like it\nreflect the viewpoint that organisms in nature are exquisitely adapted\nto their environments by the long-acting process of Fisherian\ngradualistic natural selection (see the entry on\n natural selection).\n It is a prelude to the more explicitly adaptationist views found in\nthe current behavioral literature (see review in Shuster & Wade\n2003). This view of the evolutionary process as primarily one of\nrefinement of existing organismal adaptation is an essential part of\nthe Fisherian theory of evolutionary genetics (Wade & Goodnight\n1998).\n\nThe presumptions of a genetic basis for discontinuous phenotypic\npolymorphism and its maintenance by natural selection are clear from\nthe writings of Ford cited above but these principles also can be\nfound together in a single statement: \n\n\nIn view of these considerations it is clear that if any unifactorial\ncharacter is at all widespread it must be of some [adaptive] value.\nIndeed, it is probably true that even if it occurs at as low a\nfrequency as 1 per cent, it must have been favored by selection. (Ford\n1975: 110) \n\n\nThus, the primary goal of the ecological geneticist is to discern\nexactly how natural selection is acting to maintain a balanced\npolymorphism by the relative strength of opposing fitness effects\nacting on the different sexes, at different stages in the life\nhistory, at different localities or at different times in the lifetime\nof the organism.\n\nThe existence of males and females was discussed by Ford as a prime\nexample of a balanced polymorphism because, \n\n\nIt is obvious that any tendency for the males to increase at the\nexpense of the females, or the reverse, would be opposed by selection.\n(Ford 1975: 111) \n\n\nFisher (1930) first argued that, because every individual has a mother\nand a father, the mean fitness of males must be equal to the mean\nfitness of females multiplied by the sex ratio, expressed as the\nnumber of females to males (i.e., the mean number of mates per male;\nsee also Shuster and Wade 2003, Chapter 1). As a result, fitness\nincreases with rarity, and, in this circumstance, whenever the\npopulation sex ratio deviates from unity, a gene that increases the\nnumbers of the minority sex at birth will have a selective advantage.\nThus, a sex ratio of unity is a stable, balanced polymorphism,\nachieved in many species by chromosomal determination of sex, which\nFord referred to as a \u201c\u2018built-in\u2019 genetic\nswitch-mechanism\u201d, characteristic of other genetic\npolymorphisms, like Batesian mimicry. In general, the fitnesses of two\ndifferent types constituting a phenotypic polymorphism must be equal\nto be maintained within a population by natural selection at a\nintermediate equilibrium frequency (a point recognized in Darwin 1871,\nVol. II, Chapter 14). However, the balance of selective forces for\nnon-sex related (or even sex-linked) polymorphisms is very different\nfrom that required to maintain an equal sex ratio. Using the existence\nof the separate sexes as an example of a balanced polymorphism is\nmisleading or, at least unrepresentative, of the selective forces\nnecessary to sustain balanced polymorphisms in general.\n",
