    "main_text": "Historical Origins of the Debate || An Argument that Utilitarianism is Formally Incoherent\n1.2 An Argument that Utilitarianism is Formally Incoherent\n\nThe historical origins of the debate may be traced back to work by\nLars Bergstr\u00f6m and Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda. In his A\nProblem for Utilitarianism (1968), Casta\u00f1eda argues that,\ngiven a few standard assumptions, utilitarianism is formally\nincoherent. His argument may be stated rather straightforwardly.\nFirst, Casta\u00f1eda assumes a principle of deontic logic known as\n\u201cought distributes through conjunction\u201d. This principle\nholds that if an agent S ought to do both A and\nB, then S ought to do A and S ought to do\nB (1968: 141). The term \u201cought\u201d is used in a\nvariety of different ways in the ethics literature. However, when it\nis used in the formulation of views in the actualism/possibilism\nliterature, it should be understood as denoting the ought of moral\nobligation. This idea may be represented more formally as \nOught Distributes Through Conjuction:\n\n\n(ODC)\\(\\rO(A \\lamp B) \\rightarrow \\rO(A) \\lamp \\rO(B)\\)\n\nIn other words, if an agent is obligated to perform a set of acts, then\nthat agent is obligated to perform each of the acts in that set. \n\nSecond, Casta\u00f1eda considers a principle he refers to as (U),\nwhich he takes to be a basic commitment of all existing forms of\nutilitarianism.\n\n(U)S is morally obligated to do x\nin circumstances C if and only if S\u2019s\ndoing x in C will bring about a greater balance of good\nover bad than her performing any other alternative action open to her\nin C (1968: 142).\n\n\nSome who have responded to Casta\u00f1eda, such as Zellner (1972:\n125), took (U) not only to be a commitment of utilitarianism, but a\nformulation of act-utilitarianism itself. Now, here\u2019s the\nsupposed problem. According to Casta\u00f1eda, (ODC) and (U)\ngenerate contradictory prescriptions. To see why he believed this,\nsuppose that an agent S\u2019s performing the conjunctive\nact-set \\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\) brings about a greater balance of\ngood over bad than any alternative act-set (singleton or plural)\nthat S can perform. It is supposed to follow from (U)\nthat S is obligated to perform \\(\\langle A \\lamp\nB\\rangle\\). Now, given (ODC), it follows that S is obligated to\nperform \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) and that\nS is obligated to perform \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). But,\nCasta\u00f1eda claims, given (U), performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\)\nwould result in more net good than performing any alternative,\nincluding \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\). Moreover, given (U), performing\n\\(\\langle B\\rangle\\) would also result in more net good than\nperforming any alternative, including \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\). Hence the\nsupposed contradiction. Performing \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) cannot result\nin both more good and less good than performing \\(\\langle B\\rangle\\).\nThis consequence may be illustrated with an example, drawn from\nWestphal (1972: 83\u201384). \n\n School Fire: Tom is a teacher at a\nschool that burned down. Prior to the disaster, when the weather was\nwarm at the beginning of the first class, he was told to \u27e8open\nthe window & shut the door\u27e9. The opened window would foster\ngood ventilation and the closed door would cut down on noise and\ndistractions in the hallway. Both would significantly help the\nstudents to learn.\n\n\nNaturally, the act-set of \u27e8opening the window & shutting\nthe door\u27e9 is the best that Tom can do in the circumstances he\nis in at the start on the warm day in question. Given\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s argument, Tom is obligated to \u27e8open\nthe window\u27e9 and he is obligated to \u27e8shut the\ndoor\u27e9. But if he is obligated to do each of them, then\n\u27e8opening the window\u27e9 must produce more net good than any\nalternative and \u27e8shutting the door\u27e9 must produce more\nnet good than any alternative. But, Casta\u00f1eda claims, each of\nthese acts cannot be uniquely optimific.\n",
