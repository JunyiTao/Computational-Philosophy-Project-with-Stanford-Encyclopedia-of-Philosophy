    "main_text": "Morality\n5. Morality\n\nWhen Hegel concludes Abstract Right, he seeks to resolve a tension.\nAbstract Right had been focused purely on the external appearance of\nright through taking possession and forming a contract through mutual\nrecognition. In reasserting and restoring right through\n\u201cpunishment,\u201d we do not merely honour the\nuniversality of right for us all but this move \u201cis also\nat the same time a further advance in the inner determination of the\nwill by its concept\u201d (PR \u00a7104). While we have\ndiscussed taking ownership and wrongs in relation to the mutual\nrecognition of external property, this points us forward to our having\nto grasp the particularity of our inner ownership of right.\nThis perspective leads Hegel to open a new, second stage he calls\nMorality, but again using common terms in uncommon ways.\n\nThe main point about Hegel\u2019s theory of morality is he\nredefines it in an unusual way. For Hegel, \u201cthe moral point of\nview\u201d is a purely abstract and hypothetical exercise that is\nlogically prior and separate to how morality is related to the world\n(PR \u00a7105). Hegel focuses on the\nindividual\u2019s power of choice. To this end, Hegel is a champion,\nnot an enemy, of individual liberty as he is clear that there must be\nspace for subjective freedom.\n\nThe problem with our individual power of choice is that we may well\nbe mistaken about what we choose (PR \u00a7140 Remark).\nRecalling our separateness from others in Morality, he says we may\nintend good but our only guide is our individual conception of the good\n(PR \u00a7140 Addition). A more substantive guide awaits\nreflecting about ourselves acting in relation to others concretely in\nEthical Life.\n\nOtherwise, the danger arising from such pure, inward abstraction is\nthat morality is an \u201cabstract universality \u2026 without\ncontent\u201d (PR \u00a7135). Thus, for Hegel, moral\nphilosophy of any kind is by its nature empty.\n\nPerhaps no area of the PR has attracted more controversy\nthan Hegel\u2019s so-called \u201cemptiness charge\u201d against\nKant: Kant is accused of offering no more than an empty formula of\n\u201cduty for duty\u2019s sake\u201d where our task is to avoid\ncontradicting a set formula (PR \u00a7135, see Hoy 1989,\nFreyenhagen 2012, Stern 2012). Hegel\u2019s criticisms centre on\nKant\u2019s Formula of Universal Law stating we should \u201cact only\nin accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same\ntime will that it become a universal law\u201d (Kant 1997, 4:421).\nUndoubtedly, Kant does offer Hegel some ammunition for this criticism.\nFor example, Kant says \u201cAll I need for morality is that freedom\ndoes not contradict itself and hence can at least be thought; I do not\nneed to have any further insight into it\u201d (Kant 1996, B xxix). At\nfirst glance, it might appear Kantian morality is about following a\nformula and no more.\n\nBut, of course, as Kant\u2019s defenders are correct to point out,\nHegel\u2019s criticism is unfair and misses its mark (Wood 1989). In\nfact, Kant purposefully offers multiple versions of his formula to help\ndraw our considerations of morality away from a purely rationalist\nexercise and bring it \u201cnearer to feeling\u201d (note 15). Our\nanthropology matters for Kant and he does not see our living ethically\nas merely living without contradiction.\n\nWe should recall that Hegel\u2019s emptiness charge might be made\nagainst moral philosophy. This is because Hegel has redefined morality\nas a purely hypothetical armchair exercise that by itself is\n\u201cwithout content\u201d (PR \u00a7135). Of course, this\nis not how the targets of Hegel\u2019s criticism conceive of morality\n\u2013 and, to some degree, Hegel is using his own redefinition of\nmorality to critique how others understand the same term defined\ndifferently.\n\nA more appropriate comparison might be drawn in relating\nKant\u2019s principled approach with Hegel\u2019s comments about the\nrelation of religion to the state (PR \u00a7270 Remark). Hegel\nclaims a religious point of view can help furnish individuals with\nethical principles and help us lead a more ethical life (PR\n\u00a7270 Addition). This kind of formulaic thinking in PR to\nhelp guide individuals to ethical, law abiding behaviour is perhaps\ncloser to the kind of moral project that Kant was engaged in where\nthere are clearer areas of commonality than in Hegel\u2019s critique in\nMorality (Brooks 2013).\n\nAs should be clear, Morality can only make so much progress in\nindividual abstraction. What is required is a transition bringing\ntogether the universality of Abstract Right enveloping us all\nand providing a foundation in mutual recognition with the\nparticularity of Morality where we both outwardly and inwardly\ngrasp the development of right. This bridge is to the concrete\nindividuality found in comprehending right \u2013 not in\nabstraction \u2013 but now in the world and its institutions.\n",
