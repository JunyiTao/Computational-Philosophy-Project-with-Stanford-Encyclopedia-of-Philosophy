    "main_text": "Even if intuitions can justify, can they yield knowledge of the external world?\n8. What is a priori knowledge?\n\nIt is widely, though not universally, held that knowledge is partly\nanalyzable in terms of justified true belief. But, as we\u2019ve\nseen, Gettier examples show that having a justified true belief is not\nsufficient for knowledge. We need some anti-luck condition in addition\nto JTB to rule out cases where there is a JTB but not knowledge\nbecause, in some sense, the person in the Gettier situation is lucky\nto have a true belief given the way his evidence is related to the\ntruth of his belief.\n\nThe Lottery Paradox suggests that even more than JTB and an anti-luck\ncondition are required for knowledge. The chances that you hold the\nwinning ticket in a one million ticket lottery is one in a million,\nand that you hold a losing ticket, 999,999 in a million. Suppose you\nknow what the probability of your holding a losing ticket is and that\nyou in fact have a losing ticket. Then you seem to have a justified\nbelief that your ticket is a loser (because you know that\u2019s very\nlikely true), and it is true that it is a loser. Assume, also, that\nyou are not in a Gettier situation. Still, you do not seem to know\nthat your ticket is a losing one. It seems that you need further\nconfirmation from a trustworthy source to know your ticket has\nlost.\n\nIf knowledge in general is justified true belief plus some condition\nto handle Gettier cases and another to handle the Lottery Paradox,\nthen on the account of knowledge that requires you to have a justified\ntrue belief, a priori knowledge will be a priori\njustified true belief plus some conditions to deal with Gettier and\nLottery Paradox cases. Specific versions of this view of a\npriori knowledge will depend on specific versions of a\npriori justification.\n\nBut there are rival accounts of knowledge that reject the view that\nknowledge is partly analyzable in terms of justification. One such\nview is called knowledge reliabilism; the other, the \u201cknowledge\nfirst\u201d view. Knowledge reliabilism is the view that a person\nknows P if and only if she has a reliably produced true belief,\nand a priori knowledge reliabilism would say a similar thing\nabout a priori knowledge. Perhaps just having reliable\nintuitions would be enough to have a priori knowledge\nregardless of whether they provided justification or not.\n\nThere are well-known examples that count against the idea that\nreliably produced true belief is sufficient for knowledge. Let\nTruenorth be a person who has true beliefs about what direction is\nnorth, south, etc., even when blindfolded. He has a kind of internal\ncompass like the ones found in migratory birds. But assume that\nTruenorth has no reason to think that his beliefs about compass\ndirections are accurate; he has never received confirmation of their\naccuracy, neither from the testimony of others nor by checking things\nout himself. Nevertheless, he is confident that his beliefs about what\ndirection is north, etc., are correct. Assume, also, that he has no\nreason to think that others in his society have, nor that they lack,\nhis directional ability. In general, assume that there are no\nundefeated defeaters of Truenorth\u2019s beliefs about what direction\nis north, etc. Intuitively, it seems that if he believes that some\ndirection he points to is north, he is not justified in believing,\nnor does he know, that it is north, even if what he believes\nregarding compass directions is always true.\n\nIf this is a problem for reliabilists about empirical\nknowledge, it may also be a problem for reliabilists when it comes to\na priori knowledge. Mere reliability does not seem sufficient\nfor knowledge. What seems missing in the case of Truenorth is any\nreason for him to think that his beliefs about compass directions are\nreliable. Perhaps what is missing on reliabilist accounts of a\npriori knowledge is similar, namely, that the subject lacks any\nreason to think that her a priori intuitions are reliable\neven if they are.\n\nBrian Weatherson offers an example involving a person he calls\n\u201cTamati\u201d, a young mathematician who has a sudden strong\nconviction that there is no largest prime upon noticing that as primes\nget larger the gap between them also gets larger (2019: 125\u201326).\nTamati believes that there is no largest prime on the basis of his\nstrong conviction, and Weatherson explains how Tamati\u2019s strong\nconvictions about mathematical propositions are reliable. But,\nintuitively, Tamati is not justified in believing, nor does he know,\nthat there is no largest prime without a proof that it\u2019s true.\nSo reliability is not sufficient for justification or knowledge even\nin the realm of the a priori.\n\nViews that see knowledge as resting on justification, whether\nempirical or a priori, might be said to make justification\nfirst. A \u201cknowledge first\u201d view sees justification as\nderivative at best. It equates one\u2019s total evidence with\none\u2019s total knowledge (Williamson 2014: 8; see, also, 4). If\njustification is a function of evidence, knowledge implies\njustification, but according to Williamson justification is not part\nof what knowledge is. He holds that knowledge is not analyzable even\npartly in terms of justification.\n\nThere seem to be clear counterexamples to the knowledge first view.\nSuppose you are driving out in the country and first pass by one of\nmany fields where sheep are grazing, and then a little later pass by\nthe field with the poodles that look just like sheep. In the first\ncases, you knew there were sheep in the field, but in the last case\nyou did not. Still, weren\u2019t you just as justified, didn\u2019t\nyou have the same sort of evidence, in the last case as in the first\nones? No, says Williamson, a defender of the knowledge first view. You\nare just as epistemically blameless in the last case as in\nthe earlier ones because, for all you know, you are looking at real\nsheep. You have a legitimate excuse for believing that you are looking\nat sheep, but you don\u2019t have evidence, nor are you justified in\nbelieving, that you are looking at sheep when you are looking at\npoodles (Williamson 2014: 4\u20135).\n\nWilliamson\u2019s criticism of any justified true belief account of\nknowledge would rest on the fact that no one has yet been able to\nsolve the Gettier problem (2014: 1\u20132), nor give a good account\nof what it is for beliefs to be justified because they fit the\nevidence. According to him, the attempt to analyze knowledge is in a\nshambles, and the knowledge first approach promises to shed light on\nthe nature of indiscriminability, norms of assertion, and epistemic\nlogic (2014: 6\u20137). So it promises to be fruitful while the old\napproach of analyzing knowledge has left behind a path strewn with\nfailures. This, says Williamson, is a good reason to change horses.\nBut Williamson\u2019s view seems to have its own liabilities. On the\nknowledge-first approach that he develops, you don\u2019t have any\nevidence that there are sheep in the field when you are looking at the\npoodles, and human footprints in the sand are not evidence that\nsomeone recently walked there if they were made by a monkey wearing\nrubber feet. The new horse bucks.\n",
