    "main_text": "Central Research Questions || Summing up\n2.8 Summing up\n\nBeside the above themes, ABMs have been applied to the study of\nnumerous other topics in philosophy of science: from the allocation of\nresearch funding, testimonial norms, strategic behavior of scientists,\nall the way to different procedures for theory-choice (see\n Section 4.8\n where we list models studying additional themes). Moreover, one ABM\ncan simultaneously address multiple questions (for example, social\ndiversity and scientific collaboration are often inquired\ntogether).\n\nTo study the questions presented in this section, philosophers have\nutilized different representational frameworks. Even if models are\naimed at the same research question, they are often based on different\nmodeling approaches. For instance, individual scientists may be\nrepresented as Bayesian reasoners, as agents with limited memory, as\nagents searching for peaks on an epistemic landscape, as agents that\nform their opinions by averaging information they receive from other\nscientists and from their own inquiry, or as agents that are equipped\nwith argumentative reasoning. Similarly, the process of evidence\ngathering may be represented in terms of pulls from probability\ndistributions, as foraging on an epistemic or an argumentation\nlandscape, or as receiving signals from others and from the world. We\nnow look into some of the common modeling frameworks employed in the\nstudy of the above questions.\n",
