    "main_text": "Probabilistic Toolkit || Probability and its interpretation\n1.1 Probability and its interpretation\n\nStandard probability theory consists of three axioms:\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nAxiom\nIn words\nIn symbols  \n\n\nNon-negativity\nThe probability of any proposition \\(A\\)\nis greater than or equal to 0.\n\\(\\Pr(A)\\geq 0\\) \n\nNormality\nThe probability of any logical tautology\nis 1.\nIf \\(\\models A\\), then \\(\\Pr(A)=1\\) \n\nAdditivity\n The probability of the disjunction of\ntwo propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the sum of their respective\nprobabilities, provided the two propositions are logically\nincompatible.\nIf \\(\\models \\neg (A \\wedge B)\\), then \\(\\Pr(A\\vee\nB)=\\Pr(A)+\\Pr(B)\\)  \n\n\n\nAn important notion in probability theory is that of conditional\nprobability, that is, the probability of a proposition \\(A\\)\nconditional on a proposition \\(B\\), in symbols, \\(\\Pr( A\\pmid B)\\).\nAlthough it is sometimes taken as a primitive notion, conditional\nprobability is usually defined as the probability of the conjunction\n\\(\\Pr(A \\wedge B)\\) divided by the probability of the proposition\nbeing conditioned on, \\(\\Pr(B)\\), or in other words,  \n\n\\[\\Pr(A \\pmid B)= \\frac{\\Pr(A \\wedge B)}{\\Pr(B)}\\quad \\text{ assuming \\(\\Pr(B)\\neq 0\\).}\\]\n\n\nThis notion is crucial in legal applications. The fact-finders at\ntrial might want to know the probability of \u201cThe defendant was\nat the scene when the crime was committed\u201d conditional on\n\u201cMrs. Dale asserts she saw the defendant run away from the\nscene\u201d. Or they might want to know the probability of \u201cThe\ndefendant is the source of the traces found at the crime scene\u201d\nconditional on \u201cThe DNA expert asserts that the\ndefendant\u2019s DNA matches the traces at the scene.\u201d In\ngeneral, the fact-finders are interested in the probability of a given\nhypothesis \\(H\\) about what happened conditional on the available\nevidence \\(E\\), in symbols, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\).\n\nMost legal probabilists agree that the probabilities ascribed to\nstatements that are disputed in a trial\u2014such as \u201cThe\ndefendant is the source of the crime traces\u201d or \u201cThe\ndefendant was at the crime scene when the crime was\ncommitted\u201d\u2014should be understood as evidence-based degrees\nof belief (see, for example, Cullison 1969; Kaye 1979b; Nance\n 2016). This interpretation addresses the worry that since past events did or\ndid not happen, their probabilities should be 1 or 0. Even if the\nobjective chances are 1 or 0, statements about past events could still\nbe assigned different degrees of belief given the evidence available.\nIn addition, degrees of belief are better suited than frequencies for\napplications to unrepeatable events, such as actions of individuals,\nwhich are often the focus of trial disputes Further engagement with these issues lies beyond the scope of this\nentry (for a more extensive discussion, see the entry on the\n interpretations of probability as well as Childers 2013; Gillies 2000; Mellor 2004; Skyrms 1966).\n\nSome worry that, except for obeying the axioms of probability, degrees\nof belief are in the end assigned in a subjective and arbitrary manner\n(Allen and Pardo 2019). This worry can be alleviated by noting that\ndegrees of belief should reflect a conscientious assessment of the\nevidence available which may also include empirical frequencies (see\n \u00a71.2\n below and the examples in ENFSI 2015). In some cases, however, the\nrelevant empirical frequencies will not be available. When this\nhappens, degrees of belief can still be assessed by relying on common\nsense and experience. Sometimes there will be no need to assign exact\nprobabilities to every statement about the past. In such cases, the relevant probabilities can be expressed approximately with sets of\nprobability measures (Shafer 1976; Walley 1991), probability\ndistributions over parameter values, or intervals (see later in\n \u00a71.4).\n",
