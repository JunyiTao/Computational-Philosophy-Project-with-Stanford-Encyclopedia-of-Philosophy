    "main_text": "Thematic Exposition of Levinas\u2019 Philosophy || Essays and Interviews after Otherwise than Being: The Tension between Ethics and Justice\n3. Concluding Remarks\n\nCommentators have differed on the comparative importance of\nLevinas\u2019 major works, Totality and Infinity and\nOtherwise than Being. Some have urged that we see in them two\nsides of a single coin: that of responsibility experienced in the\nface-to-face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective\ntrace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical\nphenomenology (Peperzak 1993: 7). Other commentators have argued that\nOtherwise than Being is Levinas\u2019 magnum\n opus,[50]\n a study on the intersubjective pre-conditions of language indebted\nto, yet diverging from, Heidegger\u2019s investigations of the poetic\nlogos (in which man dwells and being is intimated; Heidegger\nhe-EHP: 59\u201364). As we have seen, Derrida called Totality and\nInfinity a \u201ctreatise on hospitality\u201d (see\n \u00a72.4.1 above)\n and devoted, in sum, more attention to it than to Otherwise than\nBeing, although the latter work was in part a response to\nDerrida\u2019s criticisms in \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d\n(Derrida 1964 [1978]). There is little question that the novelty of\nOtherwise than Being lies in its three innovations: (1) the\nanalyses and tropes for transcendence-in-immanence (recurrence,\nproximity, obsession, persecution, and substitution); (2) the\ndeconstruction of language understood as the site in which existence\nis said and explained, and (3) Levinas\u2019 \u201cwager\u201d of\nstepping out of philosophical reasoning into a performative register\nthat both \u201csays\u201d and \u201cunsays\u201d itself by turns\n(OBBE: 167).\n\nDespite these innovations, Levinas\u2019 philosophical project\nremains largely constant: to rethink the meaning of existence in\nterms of the ethical transcendence of the other. To that end, he\nconsistently revisited Husserl\u2019s phenomenological method. He\nreconceived Heidegger\u2019s ontological difference as an irreducible\nseparation between being and the good we enact. He had extensive,\noften undeclared recourse to the profound, anti-totalizing intuitions\nof religious life found in Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s new thinking. By\nreason of his opposition to systems-thought, Levinas never adhered\nuncritically to any one philosophy. \n\nA common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings.\nTranscendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of\nresponsibility for another person. Responsibility is experienced in\nconcrete life and is variously expressed, from words like \u201chere\nI am\u201d to apologies and self-accounting. This is the case,\nLevinas argues, even before a de facto command is heard or\nreflected on. This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated\nmeaning of Jews \u201creceiving the Torah before knowing what was\nwritten in it\u201d (NTR: 42\u201343). Levinas names this\nresponsiveness Platonically the \u201cGood beyond being\u201d. We\nperform that good, that trace of the infinite, because\ninstances of answering to or for another are everyday events, though\nthey may not appear typical of natural or self-interested behaviors.\nAbove all, we do not choose to be responsible. Responsibility\narises as if elicited, before we begin to think about it, by the\napproach of the other person. Because this theme is found in his\nphilosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages,\nLevinas\u2019 thought has, at times, left both Talmud scholars and\nphilosophers dissatisfied. For some Talmudists, his thought seems\nsecularly humanistic, with \u201cinfinity\u201d suggesting a\nclandestine concept of divinity. No stranger to Mishna and Gemara\n(Talmud), his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional\ninter- and intra-textuality, than with the ethical content of\nthe teachings therein. To philosophers skeptical of him,\nLevinas\u2019 thought reinterprets Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutic\ncircle of facticity in a metaphysical vein. Indeed, its\nanti-foundationalist approach to responsibility, as the pre-reflective\nstructure of the embodied, intersubjective \u201cself\u201d\n(soi), appears to these critics to lie between phenomenology\nand religious thought, even if it lacks specific dogmatic commitments.\nAs we have seen, in his later philosophy, the seemingly metaphysical\nconcept of illeity expresses my emotive experience of a\n\u201cpower\u201d or an affective excess greater than I can contain.\nIn this way, it also resembles Descartes\u2019 \u201clight so\nresplendent\u201d (Descartes 1641 [1911], Meditation V). But\nit is precisely in these tensions, between the Jewish religious and\nphilosophical traditions, on the one hand, and his\nphenomenological-existential thinking-of-the-other, on the other hand,\nthat Levinas\u2019 originality lies.\n",
