    "main_text": "Further uses of visual representations\n7. Further uses of visual representations\nThere are other significant uses of visual representations in\nmathematics. This final section briefly presents a couple of them.\nAlthough the use of diagrams in arguments in analysis faces special\ndangers (as noted in 3.3), the use of\ndiagrams to illustrate symbolically presented operations can be very\nhelpful. Consider, for example, this pair of operations \\(\\{ f(x) + k,\nf(x + k) \\}\\). Grasping them and the difference between them can be\naided by a visual illustration; similarly for the sets \\(\\{ f(x + k),\nf(x - k) \\}\\), \\(\\{ |f(x)|, f(|x|) \\}\\), \\(\\{ f(x)^{-1}, f^{-1}(x),\nf(x^{-1}) \\}\\). While generalization on the basis of a visual\nillustration is unreliable, we can use them as checks against\ncalculation errors and overgeneralization. The same holds for\nproperties. Consider for example, functions for which \\(f(-x) =\nf(x)\\), known as even functions, and functions for which\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\), the odd functions: it can be helpful to\nhave in mind the images of graphs of \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(y = x^{3}\\) as\ninstances of evenness and oddness, to remind one that even functions\nare symmetrical about the \\(y\\)-axis and odd functions have rotation\nsymmetry by \\(\\pi\\) about the origin. They can serve as a reminder and\ncheck against over-generalisation: any general claim true of all odd\nfunctions, for example, must be true of \\(y = x^{3}\\) in\nparticular.\nThe utility of visual representations in real and complex analysis\nis not confined to such simple cases. Visual representations can help\nus grasp what motivates certain definitions and arguments, and thereby\ndeepen our understanding. Abundant confirmation of this claim can be\ngathered from working through the text Visual Complex\nAnalysis (Needham 1997). Some mathematical subjects have natural\nvisual representations, which then give rise to a domain of\nmathematical entities in their own right. This is true of geometry but\nis also true of subjects which become algebraic in nature very\nquickly, such as graph theory, knot theory and braid\ntheory. Techniques of computer graphics now enable us to use moving\nimages. For an example of the power of kinematic visual\nrepresentations to provide and increase understanding of a subject,\nsee the first two \u201cchapters\u201d of the online introduction to\nbraid theory by Ester Dalvit (2012, Other Internet Resources). \nWith regard to proofs, a minimal kind of understanding consists in\nunderstanding each line (proposition or formula) and grasping the\nvalidity of each step to a new line from earlier lines. But we can\nhave that stepwise grasp of proof without any idea of why it proceeds\nby those steps. One has a more advanced (or deeper) kind of\nunderstanding when one has the minimal understanding and a\ngrasp of the motivating idea(s) and strategy of the proof. The point\nis sharply expressed by Weyl (1995 [1932]: 453), quoted in (Tappenden\n2005:150)\n  We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept\na mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal\nconclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch. We want first an overview of the aim and the\nroad; we want to understand the idea of the proof, the deeper\ncontext.\nOccasionally the author of a proof gives readers the desired\nunderstanding by adding commentary. But this is not always needed, as\nthe idea of a proof is sometimes revealed in the presentation of the\nproof itself. Often this is done by using visual representations. An\nexample is Fisk\u2019s proof of Chv\u00e1tal\u2019s \u201cart\ngallery\u201d theorem. This theorem is the answer to a combinatorial\nproblem in geometry. Put concretely, the problem is this. Let the\n\\(n\\) walls of a single-floored gallery make a polygon. What is the\nsmallest number of stationary guards needed to ensure that every point\nof the gallery wall can be seen by a guard? If the polygon is convex\n(all interior angles < 180\u00b0), one guard will suffice, as guards\nmay rotate. But if the polygon is not convex, as in Figure 18, one\nguard may not be enough.\n\n\nFigure 18\n\nChv\u00e1tal\u2019s theorem gives the answer: for a gallery with\n\\(n\\) walls, \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) guards suffice, where\n\\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) is the greatest integer \\(\\le n/3\\). (If\nthis does not sound to you sufficiently like a mathematical theorem,\nit can be restated as follows: Let \\(S\\) be a subset of the Euclidean\nplane. For a subset \\(B\\) of \\(S\\) let us say that \\(B\\)\nsupervises \\(S\\) iff for each \\(x \\in S\\) there is a \\(y \\in\nB\\) such that the segment \\(xy\\) lies within \\(S\\). Then the smallest\nnumber \\(f(n)\\) such that every set bounded by a simple \\(n\\)-gon is\nsupervised by a set of \\(f(n)\\) points is at most \\(\\llcorner\nn/3.\\lrcorner\\)\nHere is Steve Fisk\u2019s proof. A short induction shows that\nevery polygon can be triangulated, i.e., non-crossing edges between\nnon-adjacent vertices (\u201cdiagonals\u201d) can be added so that\nthe polygon is entirely composed of non-overlapping triangles. So take\nany \\(n\\)-sided polygon with a fixed triangulation. Think of it as a\ngraph, a set of vertices and connected edges, as in Figure 19.\n\n\nFigure 19\n\nThe first part of the proof shows that the graph is 3-colourable,\ni.e., every vertex can be coloured with one of just three colours\n(red, white and blue, say) so that no edge connects vertices of the\nsame colour.\nThe argument proceeds by induction on \\(n \\ge 3\\), the number of\nvertices.\nFor \\(n = 3\\) it is trivial. Assume it holds for all \\(k\\), where\n\\(3 \\le k < n\\).\nLet triangulated polygon \\(G\\) have \\(n\\) vertices. Let \\(u\\) and\n\\(v\\) be any two vertices connected by diagonal edge \\(uv\\). The\ndiagonal \\(uv\\) splits \\(G\\) into two smaller graphs, both containing\n\\(uv\\). Give \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) different colours, say red and white, as\nin Figure 20.\n\n\nFigure 20\n\nBy the inductive assumption, we may colour each of the smaller\ngraphs with the three colours so that no edge joins vertices of the\nsame colour, keeping fixed the colours of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).  Pasting\ntogether the two smaller graphs as coloured gives us a 3-colouring of\nthe whole graph.\nWhat remains is to show that \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) or fewer\nguards can be placed on vertices so that every triangle is in the view\nof a guard. Let \\(b\\), \\(r\\) and \\(w\\) be the number of vertices\ncoloured blue, red and white respectively. Let \\(b\\) be minimal in\n\\(\\{b, r, w\\}\\). Then \\(b \\le r\\) and \\(b \\le w\\). Then \\(2b \\le r +\nw\\). So \\(3b \\le b + r + w = n\\). So \\(b \\le n/3\\) and so \\(b \\le\n\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\). Place a guard on each blue vertex. Done.\n The central idea of this proof, or the proof strategy, is\nclear. While the actual diagrams produced here are superfluous to the\nproof, some visualizing enables us to grasp the central idea.\n",
