    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective || Divine Command\n1.2 Divine Command\n\nThroughout history, the belief that political society and its rules\nare divinely ordained has been so strong as to keep many people, and\nprobably most, from considering the possibility that disobeying those\nrules might ever be justified. With the advent of Christianity,\nhowever, that possibility had to be taken seriously. For the\nChristian, the distinction Jesus draws (Matthew 22:15\u201322)\nbetween the tribute owed to Caesar and that owed to God makes it clear\nthat what the rulers command may be at odds with what God wants done.\nThat point became even clearer when the rulers tried to suppress\nChristianity. Nevertheless, Christian doctrine held that there is an\nobligation to obey the law grounded in divine command, with the most\nimportant text being Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans (13:1\u20132):\n\u201cFor there is no authority except from God, and those that exist\nhave been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities\nresists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur\njudgment.\u201d\n\nAs a theory of political obligation, divine command faces two general\nproblems. First, it presupposes the existence of divinity of some\nsort; and second, the commands of the divine being(s) are not always\nclear. It is one thing to know that we should give to Caesar what is\nCaesar\u2019s and to God what is God\u2019s, for example, and quite another to\nknow what exactly is Caesar\u2019s due. For Christians, however, the main\nchallenge was to reconcile Paul\u2019s text with the uncomfortable fact\nthat rulers were often hostile to Christianity \u2013 or, with the\nrise of Protestantism in the sixteenth century, hostile to what one\ntook to be true Christianity. To this challenge, one response was\nsimply to hold that hostile or vicious rulers must be endured, for God\nmust have given them power as a sign of His displeasure with a wicked\npeople. Other responses, though, made room for disobedience.\n\nOne such response was to distinguish the divinely ordained office from\nthe officer who occupied it. That is, God ordains that political\nauthority must exist, because the condition of human life since the\nfall from grace requires such authority; but God does not ordain that\nthis or that particular person hold a position of authority, and He\ncertainly does not want rulers to abuse their authority by ruling\ntyrannically. This distinction, employed as early as the fourth\ncentury by St. John Chrysostom, was invoked throughout the middle ages\n(McIlwain, pp. 152\u201353). A second response to the problem Romans\n13 posed was to distinguish disobedience from resistance. According to\nMartin Luther and others who drew this distinction, Christians may not\nactively resist their rulers, but they must disobey them when the\nrulers\u2019 commands are contrary to God\u2019s. Yet a third response was to\nnote the possibility of conflict between two or more of one\u2019s rulers.\nIn other words, if more than one person holds political authority over\nyou, and if they issue conflicting commands, then you may satisfy\nPaul\u2019s injunction by obeying the authority whose commands are more\ncongenial to your understanding of true Christianity, even when such\nobedience entails resisting the commands of others in authority.\n\nThese last two responses played an especially important part in the\npolitical disputes that accompanied the Protestant Reformation. Under\nthe pressure of those disputes, however, another theory of political\nobligation became increasingly prominent, as Protestants came to rely\non the belief that political authority derives from the consent of the\ngoverned (Skinner, vol. 2, chaps. 7\u20139).\n",
