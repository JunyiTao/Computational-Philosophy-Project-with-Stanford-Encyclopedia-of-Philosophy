    "main_text": "The Concept of Africana Philosophy\n1. The Concept of Africana Philosophy\n\n\nThere are significant challenges to the viability of the concept\nAfricana philosophy as well as to an effort to map out an\nencyclopedic overview of the extended and still expanding range of\nendeavors covered by the term. Foremost are the challenges to ordering\nthrough a single concept the geographical, historical, socio-political,\nand cultural differences and complexities that have defined and\ncontinue to define the realities of life of the many persons and\npeoples identified as \u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cof African\ndescent\u201d in many locales throughout the world. Yet, the viability\nof the concept is grounded on several centuries of continuous, linked,\ncomplicated histories during which Black peoples of Africa, and their\ndescendants, have been regarded as and engaged with, and more or less\nhave come to regard themselves, as \u201cAfrican\u201d peoples, as\npersons and peoples \u201cof African descent.\u201d The long\nhistories of this regarding, by others and by themselves, have thus\nconditioned substantively the history-makings, the socio-political\nlives, the culture-makings and culture-mediations, intellectual\nproductions and philosophizings included, of persons and peoples\nAfrican and of African descent.\n\n\nOn these socially constructive historical groundings rest several key\nheuristic presumptions that are central to Africana\nphilosophy as a metaphilosophical concept for organizing\nintellectual praxes. First, the presumption that there are sufficient\ndistinguishing anthropological, historical, and other commonalities\nand similarities that are shared, more or less, by the many\nbio-cultural groupings of human beings who have been identified, and\nwho subsequently generally have come to identify themselves, as, in\npart, \u201cAfrican\u201d or \u201cof African descent\u201d to\nwarrant ordering under a general heading particular instances of\nphilosophically articulate thought expressed by persons in these\ngroupings and shared with and debated by others within and beyond the\ngroupings. These identifications are consequences of the imposition on\nthe peoples of the continent named \u201cAfrica\u201d of an\nattempted homogenizing racializing ontology by peoples of\nnation-states on another continent that was named \u201cEurope\u201d\nin an aspiration for geo-political and anthropological\nunification. Many \u201cEuropeans\u201d came to believe that beneath\ntheir many formidable differences there was a foundational commonality\nthrough shared raciality and other constitutive virtues that was\ndefinitive of their anthropological and historical superiority as\nharbingers of a theologically and philosophically sanctioned destiny\nto achieve global predominance. It was out of this toxic mix of\nconvictions and aspirations that particular Europeans set about\nconstructing racialized, rank-ordered philosophical anthropologies\nthrough which they construed a continent of diverse peoples as a\nsingle \u201crace\u201d of \u201cAfricans\u201d or\n\u201cNegroes.\u201d The outcomes of the histories of these\ninventive forgings through complex, centuries-long struggles against\nEuropean imperialist impositions and the adaptive endurances of\ncolonization and dispersing enslavements by persons and peoples\nAfrican and African-descendant provide the warrant for the presumption\nof commonalities embraced by the concept Africana philosophy\nwhen considering the philosophizings of people African and\nAfrican-descended subsequent to their encounters with impositions of\nimperialism by people(s) of Europe and European Diasporas.\n\n\nThis first presumption is tempered by a second: namely, that the\nbio-cultural groupings of peoples African and of African descent are\nnot homogeneous, racially or otherwise, neither individually nor\ncollectively, but are constituted by differences and dissimilarities\nas well as by similarities and commonalities. All the more so as\nconsequences of the various groups having created differing\nlife-worlds in differing geographical, political, and historical\nlocations prior to and as a consequence of impositions and disruptions\nof their lives fostered by Europeans and others on one hand; and, on\nthe other, while living interactions and cultural exchanges with other\npeoples, European and European-descended peoples included, which have\ngiven rise to differences in individual and group genomes, histories,\ncultures, interests, and aspirations. Furthermore, identified shared\nsimilarities and commonalities are understood to be\ncontingent, thus neither necessary nor inherent and fixed and\nthus the same for all persons African or of African descent. This\npresumption rules out any ahistorical, a priori claims regarding\nsupposedly definitive \u201cnatural\u201d characteristics of\n\u201cthe\u201d thought of African and African-descended\npeoples assumed as non-contingently widely and generally shared across\nextended historical times and geo-cultural spaces. Africana\nphilosophy as an ordering concept, then, is neither the promise\nof, nor an aspiration for, a unifying philosophy already shared, or to\nbe shared, by all properly thoughtful persons African and/or of African\ndescent. Judgments regarding the always-contingent distinguishing\nfeatures of philosophizing thought and expression by persons African\nand of African descent, and of the extent to which such features are\nshared\u2014to what degree, under what circumstances, to what\nends\u2014are to be achieved by way of combined efforts of\nphilosophical anthropology, sociology of knowledge, and intellectual\nhistories: that is, by way of historically and socio-culturally\nsituated comparative studies of instances of philosophizing.\n\n\nA third presumption: Africana philosophy should not be\nregarded as normatively prescriptive for philosophers identified as\nAfrican or of African descent, as setting requirements for what their\nphilosophizing must have been, or must be, about and to what ends\nbecause of their racial/ethnic identities. Such identities neither\nconfer nor require particular philosophical commitments or obligations.\nSubstantive differences among African and African-descended thinkers\nhave been, and must continue to be, acknowledged and taken into account\nin the ordering of the field and setting agendas for Africana\nphilosophy. There have been, are, and will likely continue to be\npersons African and of African descent for whom their identities as\nsuch are of no import for their philosophizing.\n\n\nOf particular importance, work in Africana philosophy is also\nconditioned by the presumption that contributors need not be persons\nAfrican or of African descent. This presumption rests on the\nunderstanding that the conditioning circumstances, motivations, modes,\nagendas, and importance of the philosophically articulate thought and\naesthetic expressions of persons African and of African descent can be\nidentified, understood, researched, taught, commented on, and taken up\nwith respectful competence by persons neither African nor of African\ndescent. By virtue of their competencies such persons may be identified\nappropriately as, for example, \u201cAfricanists\u201d or\n\u201cAfro-Caribbeanists\u201d or \u201cAfrican\nAmericanists.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, the extent to which these heuristic presumptions are cogent\nand effective in guiding work in Africana philosophy is a matter that\nis to be continuously explored and tested in the agora of disciplined,\nethical scholarship and thus confirmed or disconfirmed, to whatever\nextent appropriate, in accord with proper methods of critical review\nproperly deployed.\n",
