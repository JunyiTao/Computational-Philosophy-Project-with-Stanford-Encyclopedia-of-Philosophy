    "main_text": "\n\nTwo older Indian philosophical traditions, the early Ny\u0101ya\n(grounded in Gautama Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da\u2019s\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra, c. 100 C.E., and dealing mainly with\nlogic, epistemology, and the theory of debate) and the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika (grounded in Ka\u1e47\u0101da\u2019s\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra, c. 100 B.C.E., dealing\nmainly with ontology), developed in parallel until, at some point in\nthe 11th or 12th century, they merged to form a new school, called\n\u201cNavya-Ny\u0101ya\u201d, the new Ny\u0101ya or \u201cnew\nreason\u201d school (Ganeri 2011). Despite its name, Navya-Ny\u0101ya\nincorporates and develops classical Vai\u015be\u1e63ika metaphysics\nas well as classical Ny\u0101ya epistemology. The Navya-Ny\u0101ya\nauthors also develop a precise technical language through the\nemployment of which many traditional philosophical problems could be\nclarified and resolved. Navya-Ny\u0101ya techniques proved to be so\nversatile that they were employed, not just by philosophers, but also\nin poetics, linguistics, legal theory, and other domains of medieval\nIndian thought. The foundational text of this school was\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s brilliant and innovative Jewel of\nReflection on the Truth (Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i).\nThe school continued to develop for about four centuries, reaching its\nheights with the works of Raghun\u0101tha, Jagad\u012b\u015ba and\nGad\u0101dhara (Ganeri 2014). The sophisticated use this school made\nof its technical vocabulary made it increasingly inaccessible, and so,\nin the 17th and 18th centuries, several manuals or compendia were\nwritten to explain in simplified language the basic tenets of the\nschool. I will describe the philosophical principles of\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya based on a synopsis of the most successful of these,\nAnnambha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s The Manual of Reason\n(Tarkasa\u1e43graha; henceforth TS), together with its\nauto-commentary, the D\u012bpik\u0101 (henceforth TSD), This\ntext was nicknamed B\u0101la-g\u0101d\u0101dhar\u012b, a sort\nof \u2018Beginners Guide to Gad\u0101dhara\u2019. As well as\npresenting the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory of categories (a mixture of\nphysical theory, metaphysics and philosophy of psychology), and the\nepistemological, methodological, and logical techniques of the new\nNy\u0101ya system, The Manual of Reason interjects\nfascinating discussions on a wide variety of topics of philosophical\ninterest, making the text an enjoyable and informative introduction to\nlater Indian analytical philosophy (trans. G. Bhattacharya 1983; for\ndiscussion of the text, see also Athalye 1930, Atreya 1948, C.\nBhattacharya 1966, Foucher 1949, Shastri 1961).\n",
