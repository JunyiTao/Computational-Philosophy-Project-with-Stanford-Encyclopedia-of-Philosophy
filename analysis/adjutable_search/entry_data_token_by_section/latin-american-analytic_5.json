    "main_text": "Development of Analytic Philosophy in Latin America || Colombia (1965\u2014)\n2.4 Colombia (1965\u2014)\n\nAnalytic philosophy has taken time to flourish in Colombia.\nHowever, some analytic authors became part of the philosophical canon\nat several universities by the end of the twentieth century. For a\nlong time, Colombian philosophers saw analytic philosophy either as an\nobject of study or as a resource to provide argumentative\nreconstructions of classical authors. Hence, many Colombian\nphilosophers whose work has analytic traits are reluctant to\nself-identify as analytic philosophers; they are happy to move freely\nbetween different intellectual traditions. The newer generations are\nmore willing to call themselves \u201canalytic philosophers\u201d,\nperhaps due to their earlier exposure to analytic philosophy and their\ntraining at centers of analytic philosophy abroad.\n\nAn early appearance of analytic philosophy can be found in a 1964\narticle by Carlos B. Guti\u00e9rrez that criticizes\nWittgenstein\u2019s solipsism from a phenomenological perspective.\nAfter him, Rub\u00e9n Sierra, another philosopher trained in\nphenomenology, adopted a more sympathetic approach. From the 1970s to\nthe mid-1980s, Sierra discussed the works of Russell, Frege, Carnap,\nAustin, Popper, and Strawson in lectures in the Philosophy Department\nat the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogot\u00e1 (UNAL). He\nalso translated some analytic texts and published several articles. In\nhis works, he treated analytic philosophy as an exotic object that had\nto be introduced and commented upon before it could be assimilated by\nhis Colombian\n readership.[59]\n Still in the late 1980s, Sierra described himself as a traditional\nand speculative philosopher who valued the clarity and argumentative\nrigor of analytic philosophy. After 1985, Sierra changed the course of\nhis intellectual efforts: he tried to reconstruct the fragmentary\ntradition of Colombian thought to make it available to human and\nsocial scientists. Sierra is today better known for those\nendeavors.\n\nThe situation of analytic philosophy started to change in the 1980s\nthanks to the work of Madgalena Holgu\u00edn, Adolfo Le\u00f3n\nG\u00f3mez, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Botero.\n\nAfter a PhD at Columbia University, Holgu\u00edn joined the\nPhilosophy Department at UNAL in 1981. She stayed there until 1992.\nDuring those years, Holgu\u00edn gained a reputation as the first\ntruly analytic philosopher in the country. She introduced\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy in her classes, supervised many theses\non that topic, published a few translations of analytic texts, and\nwrote a few articles on Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy. Her main\ncontribution is her book Wittgenstein y el escepticismo. In\nthat text, she offers an interpretation of On Certainty as\nproviding a \u201ctherapeutic dissolution\u201d of skepticism. On\nher reading, Wittgenstein holds that the skeptical problematic\noriginates from our misunderstanding of the contrasts between\nappearance and reality, the subjective and the objective, the internal\nand the external, and the private and the public. Holgu\u00edn\nexerted great influence on analytic and non-analytic philosophers\n alike.[60]\n\nWhile Holgu\u00edn was active in Bogot\u00e1, G\u00f3mez was the\nmain representative of analytic philosophy at Universidad del Valle in\nCali. He was active there from the late 1970s to the early 2000s.\nG\u00f3mez tried to develop a comprehensive understanding of speech\nacts inspired by Austin and Searle. He combined that account with\nPerelman\u2019s theory of argumentation, insisted on the primacy of\npractical reason over formal logic, and explored the ramifications of\nthat framework in the legal, ethical, and literary domains\n(G\u00f3mez 1991, 1997a, 1997b). Although G\u00f3mez was a pioneer\nof philosophy in Colombia, he did not leave many\n students.[61]\n\nFrom the late 1980s to the late 1990s, analytic philosophy slowly\nbecame part of the philosophical canon at UNAL. Moreover, the\nproduction of analytic works grew considerably. It is also during that\nperiod that we find the first analytic works that moved away from\nexegesis to the study of philosophical problems themselves\n(Rodr\u00edguez 2002). In a paper from 1987, Juan Jos\u00e9\nBotero, a phenomenologist by training, argued that one should study\nsense, not by focusing on linguistic meaning, but on the constitutive\nrole of mental\n states.[62]\n This and other works opened the door to philosophy of mind in\nColombia, one of the most-developed analytic areas in the country.\n\nAnalytic philosophy was established at UNAL throughout the 1990s.\nSeveral philosophers contributed to this development.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jaime Ramos, Ra\u00fal Mel\u00e9ndez,\nAlejandro Rosas, and Luis Eduardo Hoyos joined UNAL\u2019s Philosophy\nDepartment. Ramos and Botero created a research group in philosophy of\nmind. Ramos had worked on cognitivist philosophy of mind, but\nsubsequently focused on Wittgenstein and social philosophy. One of his\nmost significant articles used Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks on\nseeing-as to provide an account of mental phenomena as having three\nmutually irreducible aspects: physical, psychological, and social\n(Ramos 2001). Mel\u00e9ndez, a mathematician by training, pursued\nthe tradition of Wittgenstein scholarship initiated by Holgu\u00edn.\nHowever, he focused on topics like truth and the philosophy of\n mathematics.[63]\n Contrary to Ramos and Mel\u00e9ndez, Rosas and Hoyos started their\ncareers as Kant scholars. Analytic philosophy featured in their work\nas a tool to provide analytic reconstructions of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy. Rosas defended a reading of Kant\u2019s transcendental\nphilosophy inspired by Strawson (Rosas\n 1996).[64]\n Hoyos wrote a pioneering work on the skeptical reception of\nKant\u2019s philosophy. He argued that the skeptical debates of the\nlate eighteenth century in Germany anticipated subsequent themes and\narguments from Ayer, Moore, Strawson, and Stroud (Hoyos\n 2001).[65]\n\nThe arrival of Ignacio \u00c1vila, William Duica, and Adrian Cussins\nat the turn of the twentieth century gave analytic philosophy at UNAL\na new boost. Much of \u00c1vila\u2019s work has focused on a\nKantian theme: the constitutive links between objectivity,\nsubjectivity, and spatiality. Contrary to Rosas and Hoyos,\n\u00c1vila has pursued his work in dialogue with contemporary\nphilosophy of perception (\u00c1vila 2014, 2015). Duica has made\ncontributions to epistemology, notably the realism/anti-realism debate\nand relativism from a Davidsonian perspective (Duica 2014). In the\nearly 1990s, Cussins developed a theory of non-conceptual content that\nestablished a constitutive link between perceptual experience and\naction (Cussins 1990, 1992). Since Cussins\u2019 arrival in Colombia\nin the 2000s, his theory has had a great impact on a new generation of\nanalytic\n philosophers.[66]\n\nThe Universidad de Los Andes started to gain prominence as a center\nfor analytic philosophy in the early 2010s. After joining the\nPhilosophy Department in 2002, Andr\u00e9s P\u00e1ez sought to\ninstitutionalize the teaching of logic and consolidate a group in\nanalytic\n philosophy.[67]\n P\u00e1ez has been a pioneer in legal epistemology and the\nphilosophy of AI in the region (P\u00e1ez 2009, 2014, 2019). With\nCarlos Cardona from Universidad El Rosario, he organizes\nPHILOGICA, a series of international conferences that have\ncontributed to the training of students. Santiago Amaya has managed to\nattract international funding to consolidate a community around the\nphilosophy of action and moral psychology, organizing international\nworkshops and summer schools. This group has trained a new generation\nof philosophers that have pursued their careers abroad.\n\nWhile there is no journal exclusively devoted to analytic philosophy\nin Colombia, well-established venues like Ideas y Valores\n(Bogot\u00e1), Praxis Filos\u00f3fica (Cali), and\nEstudios de Filosof\u00eda (Medell\u00edn) regularly\npublish papers in the analytic\n tradition.[68]\n",
