    "main_text": "The Scope of Equality of Opportunity || Person Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n10.2 Person Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nThis dimension of the scope of Equality of Opportunity has thus far\nbeen framed as a matter of the range of persons to whom the conception\nof Equality of Opportunity is to be applied. However, it is worth\nnoting that we can think about this issue in slightly different\nterms\u2014understanding the identity or status of the person as one\nof the factors which should or should not affect a distribution. The\nexample of Equality of Opportunity for political office in France can\nbe understood as having a scope that is limited to French citizens,\nor, alternatively, it could be understood to have a global scope but\nwhere citizenship is a relevant factor which determines who should or\nshould not be able to run for office. Though it is true on a technical\nlevel that all such scope claims can be translated into the factors\nwhich should or should not affect success in a competition, it seems\nclearer to conceive of this in terms of the scope of application\nacross persons, given that it is a persons\u2019 identity\nwhich disbars them from consideration altogether.\n\nFurthermore, particularly when we think about telic ways of thinking\nabout Equality of Opportunity in terms of persons enjoying fair\nprospects for success, it seems more sensible to think of conceptions\nof Equality of Opportunity in terms of being scope limited across\npersons, rather than adding a person\u2019s identity to the range of\nfactors which legitimately affect the prospects for success. Consider,\nfor instance, the claim under Rawls\u2019 FEO that social class\nshould not affect persons\u2019 prospects for securing socially\nadvantageous positions. It seems clear that children in the poorest\nsocial class in, say, Afghanistan will have worse prospects for\nsuccess than the most prosperous social class in, say, Norway. And yet\nRawls does not class it as a failure of Equality of Opportunity if\nAfghan children fare worse in the competition for offices and\npositions in Norway than do Norwegian children. Rather than saying\nthat FEO has global scope but also includes the condition that\nprospects can legitimately vary according to nationality, it\nseems more sensible to say that Rawls\u2019 conception of FEO is\nlimited in scope to those persons within a particular social\nscheme. \n\nWhether Equality of Opportunity has a scope that traverses national\nborders is closely related to wider questions concerning the scope of\njustice (see the entries on\n global justice\n and\n international distributive justice)\n and is a debated matter (for defences of such a position, see Caney\n2000a,b; B. Barry 1991; Moellendorf 2002; Pogge 1994; for accounts\ncritical of coherent global scheme of Equality of Opportunity, see\nBoxill 1987; Miller 2005). There is no strict relationship between how\nformal or substantive a conception of Equality of Opportunity is and\nhow wide its person scope is. LE conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity tend to be associated with a global person scope, although\nLE is technically consistent with a more limited person scope. LE\ntilts in favour of a global person scope because conceptions of LE\ngenerally see all factors other than responsible\nchoice\u2014including citizenship and nationality\u2014as morally\narbitrary, and hence improper determinants of how well a person fares\nin comparison with others (Caney 2005: 123).\n",
