    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || The Problem of Emergence\n4.5 The Problem of Emergence\n\nThe basic idea of emergence has to do with the fact that complex\nsystems may display interesting novel properties\u2014properties not\npossessed by their parts. This idea has been regimented in various\nways. Following Chalmers, we can distinguish between\n\u201cweak\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d emergence. Weakly emergent\nphenomena are merely unexpected, given our knowledge of the domain\nfrom which they arise. Strongly emergent phenomena are not just\nunexpected; they cannot (not even in principle) be deduced from the\ndomain from which they arise (see Chalmers 2006: 244). There are\nongoing debates, however, about whether epistemic and/or logical\nnotions such as deducibility are reliable guides to the nature of\nreality. Such issues can be set aside by instead using the notion of\n\u201cradical\u201d emergence for cases in which complex systems\ndisplay novel features that are not wholly grounded in the nature,\nfeatures, or relations of their parts (Strawson 2006). Weak emergence\nwill, no doubt, be a wide-spread phenomenon in the neutral monist\nworld. It poses no problem. In contrast, neutral monism appears to\nrule out radical emergence. Things are less clear in the case of\nstrong emergence. Russell\u2019s method of logical construction is\nincompatible with strong emergence, but it is an open question whether\nother neutral monist accounts are.\n\nLandini adopts the contrary view that radical emergence plays a\ncrucial role in Russell\u2019s neutral monism. If the fundamental\ntransient physical particulars (or events) have no phenomenal\ncharacters (or qualia), such qualities must be understood as radically\nemergent features within the framework of Russell\u2019s\n account.[20]\n\nQualia never occur in transient particulars. In Russell\u2019s view,\nqualia emerge from the series of brain states\u2026colors, pitches,\nsmells, tastes and textures are emergent properties of series of brain\nstates\u2026. (Landini 2011: 302\u2013305)\n\n\nBut Russell\u2019s remarks about emergence (Russell 1927b:\n293\u201396) allow different reading. When called upon to present\nexamples of events, Russell gives the following list:\n\nseeing a flash of lightning\u2026hearing a tyre burst, or smelling a\nrotten egg, or feeling the coldness of a frog\u2026particular colors\nand sounds and so on are events. (Russell 1927b: 287\u201388)\n\n\nAll of these events are percepts\u2014the only kinds of events we can\nknow without inference. And, pace Landini, all of these events do have\nqualitative characters. When Russell speaks of emergence, he has in\nmind the relationship between physics\u2019 abstract mathematical\ndescriptions of events and their intrinsic qualitative characters. And\nhe maintains that latter are (strongly) emergent with respect to the\nformer because there is no inferential path leading from abstract\nmathematical descriptions of an event to its intrinsic qualitative\nfeatures. For such abstract and mathematical considerations\n\ncannot conceivably\u2026prove that there are visual events, or\nauditory events, or events of any of the kind that we know by\nperception. (Russell 1927b: 295)\n\n\nBut it is debatable whether such qualities radically emerge from\nanything. In any case, this is not how the neutral monist (who follows\nRussell\u2019s lead) starts out. Our percepts are our initial data,\nand they are qualitative through and through. We simply do not have to\ndeduce the existence of quality from other known facts, such as those\ninvolving complex brain states. Qualities are there, in the form of\nour percepts, at the very foundation of Russell\u2019s theory. Such\nother events as we may believe in, whose intrinsic qualities we do not\nknow, are all inferred from this qualitative bedrock. Even so, the\nneutral monist insists, it doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that\nsomething is irreducibly qualitative that it is intrinsically\nmental\u2014or mental at all.\n",
