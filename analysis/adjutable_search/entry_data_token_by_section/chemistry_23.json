    "main_text": "Chemical Reduction || Reduction of Molecular Species to Quantum Mechanics\n6.1 Reduction of Molecular Species to Quantum Mechanics\n\nBogaard (1978), Scerri (1991, 1994) and Hendry (1998) have all\nquestioned the possibility of fully reducing chemical theories about\natoms and molecules to quantum mechanics. Bogaard argues that many key\nchemical concepts such as valence and bonding do not find a natural\nhome in quantum mechanics. In a similar spirit, Scerri points out that\nthe quantum mechanical calculations of atomic spectra standardly\npresented in chemistry textbooks make highly idealized assumptions\nabout the structure of many-electron systems. These approximations are\nwell-motivated on pragmatic grounds. However, they do not allow\nquantum mechanics to \u201capproximately reduce\u201d chemical\nfacts, because the errors introduced by these approximations cannot be\nestimated (Scerri 1991, 1994). Further, one of the most important\nchemical trends, the length of periods in the Periodic Table, cannot\nbe derived from quantum mechanics, unless experimentally derived\nchemical information is specifically introduced (Scerri 1997).\nDrawing on the work of Woolley (1978) and Primas (1981), Hendry (1998)\nargues that there are principled difficulties in accommodating\nmolecular shape within quantum mechanics: the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation effectively adds structure by hand. Although quantum\nchemistry can be extremely illuminating, these authors argue that it\nhas not reduced chemistry to physics.\n\nIf one thinks that reduction means deriving the phenomenon of the\nhigher level exclusively from the lower level, then these arguments\nshould settle the question of reduction. More than 80 years after the\ndiscovery of quantum mechanics, chemistry has not been reduced to it.\nBut there are two possible reductionist responses to this\nargument.\n\nFirst, reductionists can argue that there are no principled reasons\nthat chemical phenomena have not been derived from quantum mechanics.\nThe problem is a lack of computational power and appropriate\napproximation schemes, not anything fundamental. Schwarz (2007) has\nmade this argument against Scerri, claiming that the electronic\nstructure of atoms, and hence the Periodic Table, is in principle\nderivable from quantum mechanics. He believes that quantum chemistry\u2019s\ninability to reduce chemical properties is simply a manifestation of\nthe problems shared by all of the computationally complex sciences.\nDebate then turns to the plausibility of such \u201creducibility in\nprinciple\u201d claims.\n\nThere are also arguments that focus, at least implicitly, on\nchemistry\u2019s ontology. A well-known strand of contemporary metaphysics\ndefends physicalism, the doctrine that everything in the\nuniverse is physical (see the entry on\n physicalism).\n According to the physicalist, chemistry is \u201cnothing but\u201d\nphysics, even though chemical explanations and theories are not\nderivable from physics. The physical world is simply composed of the\nfundamental particles of physics. Chemical entities and their\nproperties have no independent reality.\n\nThe status of arguments for physicalism and the supervenience of\neverything on the physical are contentious within metaphysics proper,\nbut beyond the scope of this entry. Yet we think that the failure of\nchemical theory to be fully derivable from physics raises interesting\nquestions about the doctrine of physicalism. Minimally, it points to\nlongstanding worries that the domain of the physical is not\nwell-defined. If chemical entities such as molecules and ions end up\nbeing part of the physical ontology, one might argue that this was not\na case of the reduction of chemistry to physics at all but simply the\nexpansion of the ontology of physics to encompass the ontology of\nchemistry.\n\nIndependent studies of the ontology of chemistry on the basis of\nmereology have been undertaken by several authors (Earley 2005,\nHarr\u00e9 and Llored 2011, Needham 2010a). In disputing Scerri\u2019s\n(2000, 2001) argument against claims (Zuo et al. 1999) that orbitals\nhave been observed, Mulder (2010) appeals to a general ontological\ndistinction between entities, which can appropriately be said to\nexist, and states which don\u2019t exist independently but are features of\nentities that exist. Ostrovsky (2005) and Schwarz (2006) take issue\nwith the role of approximations in Scerri\u2019s argument.\n\nMore controversially, some philosophers of chemistry have argued that\nchemical properties may constrain the behavior of physical systems,\nsomething akin to what philosophers of mind call strong emergence, or\ndownwards causation (Kim 1999). While acknowledging the central role\nof quantum mechanics in understanding structure, Hendry argues that in\nsome cases, molecular structure is an unexplained explainer. The issue\narises when we consider the quantum-mechanical description of\nstructural isomers, molecules with the same atoms, but with different\nmolecular structures. For example, dimethyl ether and ethanol share a\nHamiltonian, the quantum mechanical description of their physical\nstates. Nevertheless, they are very different molecules. Ethanol is\nextremely soluble in water, whereas dimethyl ether is only partially\nsoluble in water. Ethanol boils at 78.4\u00b0C, while dimethyl ether\nboils at 34.6\u00b0C. Drinking ethanol leads to intoxication, while\ndimethyl ether is toxic in quite different ways. Quantum mechanics can\nshow how each of these structures is energetically stable, and\nilluminate how they interact with other molecules and radiation to\nexplain the chemical and spectroscopic behaviour of ethanol and\ndimethyl ether, but the different structures are introduced as\nunexplained initial conditions. While he acknowledges that these facts\nare not incompatible with the claim that structure is reducible,\nHendry argues that strong emergence is just as plausible an\ninterpretation as reduction of the explanatory relationship between\nchemistry and quantum mechanics (2006b, 2010a).\n",
