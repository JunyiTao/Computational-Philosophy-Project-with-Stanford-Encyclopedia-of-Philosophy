Multiple Players, Tragedies of the Commons, Voting and Public Goods\n\nMost of those who maintain that the PD illustrates something important\nabout morality seem to believe that the basic structure of the game is\nreflected in situations that larger groups, perhaps entire societies,\nface. The most obvious generalization from the two-player to the\nmany-player game would pay each player the reward (\\(R\\)) if all\ncooperate, the punishment (\\(P\\)) if all defect, and, if some\ncooperate and some defect, it would pay the cooperators the sucker\npayoff (\\(S\\)) and the defectors the temptation (\\(T\\)). But it is\nunlikely that we face many situations of this structure.\n\nA common view is that a multi-player PD structure is reflected in what\nGarret Hardin popularized as \u201cthe tragedy of the commons.\u201d\nEach member of a group of neighboring farmers prefers to allow his cow\nto graze on the commons, rather than keeping it on his own inadequate\nland, but the commons will be rendered unsuitable for grazing if more\nthan some threshold number use it. More generally, there is some\nsocial benefit \\(B\\) that each member can achieve if sufficiently many\npay a cost \\(C\\). We might represent the payoff matrix as follows:\n\n\n\nmore than \\(n\\)\n\nchoose \\(C\\) \n\\(n\\) or fewer\n\nchoose \\(C\\)  \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(C+B\\)\n\\(C\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\\(0\\) \n\n\nThe cost \\(C\\) is assumed to be a negative number. The\n\u201ctemptation\u201d here is to get the benefit without the cost,\nthe reward is the benefit with the cost, the punishment is to get\nneither and the sucker payoff is to pay the cost without realizing the\nbenefit. So the payoffs are ordered \\(B \\gt (B+C) \\gt 0 \\gt C\\). As in\nthe two-player game, it appears that \\(\\bD\\) strongly dominates\n\\(\\bC\\) for all players, and so rational players would choose \\(\\bD\\)\nand achieve 0, while preferring that everyone would choose \\(\\bC\\) and\nobtain \\(C+B\\).\n\nUnlike the more straightforward generalization, this matrix does\nreflect, in a highly idealized way, common social choices \u2014\nbetween depleting and conserving a scarce resource, between using\npolluting and non-polluting means of manufacture or disposal, and\nbetween participating and not participating in a group effort towards\nsome common goal. When the number of players is small, it represents a\nversion of what has been called the \u201cvolunteer dilemma\u201d. A\ngroup needs a few volunteers, but each member is better off if others\nvolunteer. (Notice, however, that in a true volunteer dilemma, where\nonly one volunteer is needed, \\(n\\) is zero and the top right outcome\nis impossible. Under these conditions \\(\\bD\\) no longer dominates\n\\(\\bC\\) and the game loses its PD flavor.) A particularly vexing\nmanifestation of this game occurs when a vaccination known to have\nserious risks is needed to prevent the outbreak of a fatal disease. If\nenough of her neighbors get the vaccine, each person may be protected\nwithout assuming therisks.\n\nOne idealizion here of the situations described is that the costs and\nbenefits of cooperation are assumed to be independent of the number of\nthose who cooperate. Until the threshold of cooperation is exceeded,\nnobody gets the benefit. Afterwards, everyone does. They are, in the\nterminology of Frolich et al, lumpy. This is not true of, say, a lake\nmade clean when residents refrain from dumping waste into it, or a gas\nsupply maintained by users' conservation. We will consider relaxing\nthis idealization later. For now, note that a situation more closely\nmirrored by the matrix is faced by the supporters of a particular\npolitical candidate or proposition who face the choice of whether to\nvote in a majority-rule election. Once enough supporters to constitute\na majority choose to vote, additional votes will not increase their\nbenefit. For this reason we might call the game described by the\nmatrix above a voting game. \n\nThe voting game, as characterized above, has a somewhat different\ncharacter than the two-player PD. First, even if each player's moves\nare entirely independent of the others, the alternatives represented\nby the columns in the commons matrix above are no longer independent\nof the alternatives represented by the rows. My choosing \\(\\bC\\)\nnecessarily increases the chances that more than \\(n\\) people will\nchoose \\(\\bC\\). To ensure independence we should really redraw the\nmatrix as follows:\n\n\n\nmore than \\(n\\) others\n\nchoose \\(C\\)\n\\(n\\) others choose \\(C\\)\nfewer than \\(n\\) others\n\nchoose \\(C\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(C+B\\)\n\\(C+B\\)\n\\(C\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\) \n\n\nBut now we see that move \\(\\bD\\) does not dominate \\(\\bC\\),\nas it does in the 2-player prisoner's dilemma. When we are at the\nthreshold of adequate cooperation, where exactly \\(n\\) others choose\n\\(\\bC\\), I am better off cooperating. Similarly, whereas mutual\ndefection is the only nash equilibrium in the original PD, this game\nhas two equilibria. One is universal defection, since any player\nunilaterally departing from that outcome will move from payoff 0 to\n\\(C\\). But a second is the state of minimally effective\ncooperation, where the number of cooperators is just sufficient to\nobtain the benefit. A defector who unilaterally departs from that\noutcome will move from \\(B\\) to \\(B+C\\) and a cooperator who\nunilaterally departs will move from \\(B+C\\) to 0. Finally, in the\norginal PD, every outcome except universal defecton is pareto\noptimal--i.e., as long as at least one of the players cooperates,\nthere is no outcome in which in which each player is at least as well\noff and one is better off. In the voting game, on the other hand, only\nthe states of minimally effective cooperation are pareto optimal. If\nthe number of cooperators exceeds the threshold by one or more, a new\ndefector will benefit himself while hurting no others. \n\nIn view of these properties, it may seem that the voting game presents\nfar less of a dilemma than the PD. There are, after all, equilibria\nthat are pareto-optimal outcomes. In practice, however, it is\ndifficult to see how these equilibria could be attained and the\nall-defect equilibrium could be avoided. When n is large, defection\n\u201calmost dominates\u201d cooperation. In the voting case, for\nexample, a player might plausibly reason: if few of my fellow\nsupporters vote, my vote will be futile, if many of them do it will be\nunneccessary. Even if a group were in the unlikely situation of being\njust below the threshold of minimally effective cooperation, a\nprospective voter would have no way of knowing this. In the pollution\nand conservation examples moves should really not be modeled as\nsimultaneous (see Asynchronous Moves below), so we may perhaps be a\nlittle more optimistic. By observing the actions of those who have\nmoved previously a player might know whether at his turn the threshold\nof minimally effective cooperation is near. In most real-world\nsituations, however, a player can deduce this only by observing the\neffects of those actions, and often these effects manifest themselves\nonly after his move is made. A conspicuous example of this delay\neffect might be the succession of carbon-emitting activities leading\nto climate change.\n\nIn examples philosophers discuss as instances of prisoner's dilemma,\nit is taken to be obvious that universal cooperation is the most\nsocially desirable outcome. In the voters dilemma, since minimally\neffective cooperation is pareto superior, one might think that we\nshould aim instead for that outcome. But this seems to depend on the\nnature of the choices involved. In the medical example it may seem best\nto vaccinate everyone. In the agricultural example, however, it seems\nfoolish to stipulate that nobody use the commons. Someone who avoids\nvaccination in the former case is seen as a \u201cfree rider\u201d.\nAn underused commons in the latter seems to exemplify \u201csurplus\ncooperation.\u201d All these cases seem to raise questions of\nfairness. If t+1 is the size of a minimally effective collection of\nplayers, then any profile in which exactly t+1 players cooperate is a\npareto optimal equilibrium. If there is no reason to prefer one such\nprofile over another, it is possible that fairness would dictate\nchoosing the inferior outcome of universal cooperation. \n\nThe two-person version of the tragedy of the commons game (with\nthreshold of one) produces a matrix presenting considerably less of a\ndilemma.\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(B+C,B+C\\)\n\\(C,0\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(0,C\\)\n\\(0,0\\) \n\n\nThis game captures David Hume's example of a boat with one oarsman on\nthe port side and another on the starboard (provided we assume that\nHume's oarsmen must make their choices between rest (D) and exertion\n(\\(\\bC\\)) simultaneously). If either rows alone, she exerts herself to\nno good effect, which is worse than had she merely rested. Mutual\ncooperation here is identical to minimally effective cooperation and\ntherefore is both an equilibrium outcome and a pareto optimal outcome.\nGames of this sort are discussed in section 8 below,\n under the label \u201cstag hunt.\u201d\n\nThe above representations of the tragedy of the commons make the\nsimplifying assumptions that the costs and benefits of cooperation are\nthe same for each player, that the cost of cooperation is independent\nof the number of players who cooperate, and that the size of the\nbenefit (\\(0\\) or \\(B)\\)) depends only on whether the number of\ncooperators exceeds the threshold. A somewhat more general account\nwould replace \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) by functions \\(C(i,j)\\) and \\(B(i,j)\\),\nrepresenting the cost of cooperation to player \\(i\\) when he is one of\nexactly \\(j\\) players who cooperate and the benefit to player \\(i\\)\nwhen exactly \\(j\\) players cooperate. We suppose that there is some\nthreshold \\(t\\) for minimally effective cooperation so that \\(B(i,j)\\)\nis not defined unless \\(j \\gt t\\). We may also assume additional\ncooperation never reduces the benefit \\(i\\) gets from effective\ncooperation, i.e., \\(B(i,j+1) \\ge B(i,j)\\) when \\(j \\gt t\\) and that\nadditional defection never reduces the cost \\(i\\) bears in\ncooperating, i.e., \\(C(i,j+1) \\ge C(i,j)\\). Now suppose, in addition,\nthat, once the threshold of effective cooperation has been exceeded,\nany benefit one gets from from the presence of an additional\ncooperator is exceeded by one's cost of cooperation and that the costs\nof ineffective cooperation are genuine, i.e., for all players \\(i\\),\n\\(B(i,j) \\gt ( B(i,j+1)+C(i,j+1) )\\) when \\(j\\) is greater than \\(t\\)\nand \\(0 \\gt C(i,j)\\) when \\(j\\) is less than or equal to \\(t\\).\nFinally, suppose that the benefits to each player \\(i\\), of effective\ncooperation exceed the costs, i.e., for \\(j \\gt t\\), \\(B(i,j)+C(i,j)\n\\gt 0\\). We then have a tragedy of the commons game, which presents a\nfamiliar dilemma: defection benefits an individual in every\ncircumstance (except the one where exactly \\(t\\) others cooperate) but\neverybody is better off in any state of effective cooperation than in\nany state without it. This account could be easily be modified to\nallow threshold of minimally effective cooperation to differ from one\nindividual to another (\\(i\\)'s clean water requirements might be more\nstringent than \\(j\\)'s for example) or to allow \\(B\\) to be defined\neverywhere (thus eliminating the threshold, so that we always benefit\nfrom another's cooperation). The resulting game would still have its\nPD flavor.\n\nPhillip Pettit has pointed out that examples that might be represented\nas many-player PDs come in two flavors. The examples discussed above\nmight be classified as free-rider problems. My temptation is to enjoy\nsome benefits brought about by burdens shouldered by others. The other\nflavor is what Pettit calls \u201cfoul dealer\u201d problems. My\ntemptation is to benefit myself by hurting others. Suppose, for\nexample, that a group of people are applying for a single job, for\nwhich they are equally qualified. If all fill out their applications\nhonestly, they all have an equal chance of being hired. If one lies,\nhowever, he can ensure that he is hired while, let us say, incurring a\nsmall risk of being exposed later. If everyone lies, they again have\nan equal chance for the job, but now they all incur the risk of\nexposure. Thus a lone liar, by reducing the others' chances of\nemployment from slim to none, raises his own chances from slim to\nsure. As Pettit points out, when the minimally effective level of\ncooperation is the same as the size of the population, there is no\nopportunity for free-riding (everyone's cooperation is needed), and so\nthe PD must be of the foul-dealing variety. But (Pettit's contrary\nclaim notwithstanding) not all foul-dealing PDs seem to have this\nfeature. Suppose, for example, that two applicants in the story above\nwill be hired. Then everyone gets the benefit (a chance of employment\nwithout risk of exposure) unless two or more players lie.\nNevertheless, the liars seem to be foul dealers rather than free\nriders. A better characterization of the foul-dealing dilemma might be\nthat every defection from a generally cooperative state strictly\nreduces the payoffs to the cooperators, i.e., for every player \\(i\\)\nand every \\(j\\) greater than the threshold, \\(B(i,j+1)+ C(i,j+1) \\gt\nB(i,j)+ C(i,j)\\). A free-rider's defection benefits himself but does\nnot, by itself, hurt the cooperators. A foul-dealer's defection\nbenefits himself and hurts the cooperators.\n\nThe game labeled a many-person PD in Schelling, in Molander 1992, and\nelsewhere requires that the payoff to each co-operator and defector\nincreases strictly with the number of cooperators and that the sum of\nthe payoffs to all parties increases with the number of cooperators\n(so that one party's switching from defection to cooperation always\nraises the sum). Neither of these conditions is met by the formulation\nabove, and one may question whether they are appropriate for the\nexamples given. The margin of victory would not seem to raise the\nvalue of winning an election. Natural filtering systems may allow a\nbody of water to absorb a certain amount of waste with zero harmful\neffects. It is often plausible, however, to maintain that they hold\n\u201clocally,\u201d i.e., for \\(j\\) close to the threshold \\(t\\)\nfor minimally effective cooperation, it may be reasonable to assume\nthat:\n\nfor every individual \\(i\\), \\(B(i, j+1)+C(i,j+1) \\gt B(i,\nj)+C(i,j)\\) for \\(j \\gt t\\),\nfor every individual \\(i\\), \\(C(i, j+1) \\gt C(i,j)\\) for \\(j \\le\nt\\), and \n\n\\[\n\n\\begin{align}\n &B(1,j+1)+ C(1, j+1) + \\ldots +  B(j+1,j+1) + C(t+1,j+1) \\\\\n     & \\quad\\quad + B(j+2,j+1)) + \\ldots + B(n, j+1) \\\\\n     & \\ \\gt B(1,j) + C(1,j) + \\ldots + B(j,j) + C(j,j) \\\\\n     & \\quad\\quad + B(j+1,j) + \\ldots + B(n,j).\n\\end{align}\n\n\\]\n\n \n\n\nBy requiring that cooperation of others always strictly benefits each\nplayer, the Schelling and Molander formulations of the \\(n\\)-person PD\nfail to model the surplus cooperation/free rider phenomenon that seems\nto infuse many of the tragedy-of-commons examples. Their conditions\nmight, however be a plausible model for certain public good\ndilemmas. It is not unreasonable to suppose that any\ncontribution towards public health, national defense, highway safety,\nor clean air is valuable to all, no matter how little or how much we\nalready have, but that the cost to each for his own contribution to\nthose goods always exceeds the benefit that he derives from that\ncontribution. A particularly simple game meeting the conditions above\nis the public goods game. Each player may choose to\ncontribute either nothing or a fixed utility C to a common store.\nContributions to the store are added together, mutiplied by some\nfactor greater than one, and divided equally among the members of the\ngroup. In this way a player benefits by same amount from the\ncontributions of others whether she contributes herself or not, and\nloses by the same (smaller) amount from her own contribution whether\nothers contribute or not. This is not true of PD's in general, though\nit is true of the exchange game mentioned in the introduction.\n\nThe formulations of Schelling and Per Molander and the public goods\ngame have the advantage of focusing attention on the PD quality of the\ngame. Defection dominates cooperation, while universal cooperation is\nunanimously preferred to universal defection. Michael Taylor goes even\nfurther in this direction. His version of the many-person PD requires\nonly the two PD-conditions just mentioned and the one additional\ncondition that defectors are always better off when some cooperate\nthan when none do. (Taylor's main concern is with the iterated version\nof this game, a topic that will not be addressed here.)\n\nThese ideas can be made more perspicuous by some pictures, which\nsuggest additional refinements and extensions. Figure 2 below\nillustrates the voting game. In graph 2(a), twenty five\nsupporters are choosing whether to vote in a majority-rule\nelection. Utility to a player i is plotted against the number of those\nother than i who vote. Dark disks represent cooperators (voters) and\ncircles represent defectors (non-voters). When the number of other\nvoters is fewer than twelve or greater than twelve then defection\nbeats cooperation. But when exactly twelve others vote it benefits i\nto vote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)(b)\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nIn figure 2(b) smooth curves are drawn through the lines\nand circles to illustrate a more general form of the voting game. The\nutilities to cooperators and defectors are represented by two S-shaped\ncurves. The curves intersect in two places. Now, instead of a single\npoint of minimally effective cooperation, we have a small region\nbetween the two curves where cooperation beats defection. In terms of\nthe polluted lake example, we might suppose that to the left of the\nfirst intersection, pollution is so bad that my additional\ncontribution makes it no worse, and to the right of the second\nintersection, the lake is so healthy that it can handle my refuse with\nno ill effects. The intersection points are both equilibria, the\npolluting and fastitidious residents both lose by changing behavior.\nIn terms of the voting example, we might suppose that the behavior of\nnon-supporters is uncertain and the region between the curves\nrepresents the situations in which my vote increases the odds of\nwinning in a way that exceeds my cost of voting. \n\nThe more general voting game satisfies the Schelling/Molander\ncondition that utility of each player increases strictly with the\nlevel of cooperation only near the region where cooperation is\neffective. In figure 3 below the S-curves are bent so that this\ncondition is met everywhere. In 3(a) the two curves\nstill intersect twice. Bovens, which contains a very illuminating\ntaxonomy of n-player games, labels this form the voting game\nand argues that it best represents situations described in the\nliterature as tragedies of the commons. Note that if there is a\nvalue of x at which both curves lie above the equilibria, as there\nmust be if the curves are upward sloping, then the equilibria here\ncannot be pareto optimal (as the lone equilibrium was in the simplest\nversion of what was called the voting game above). Hence the tragedy.\nIn graph 3(b) there are no intersections between the two\ncurves. Thus the second of the Schelling/Molander conditions for a PD\nis also met: defection dominates cooperation. The final condition,\nthat cooperation always raises the sum of utilities, is not so easily\npictured, but, because the slopes of the two curves are positive, we\ncan be sure that it will be met if the population is sufficiently\nlarge. \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)(b)\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nBenefits are somewhat less lumpy in these two games than the previous\ntwo. Lumpiness can by further reduced by further flattening the\ncurves. At the limit, we get the public goods game shown in the first\ngraph of figure 4. Here the curves are straight lines. Each additional\ncooperator provides both defectors and cooperators with the same\nadditional benefit of mc/n where c is the cost of donation, m is the\nstipulated multiplier and n is the number of players in the game. If\nthe curves are sufficiently flat, they can intersect at most\nonce. Altogether there are three possibilities: the game pictured in\nfigure 4(a), where the two curves do not intersect, the one pictured\nin 4(b), where cooperators' utility is above the defectors'\nto the left of the intersection and below it to the right, and the one\npictured in 4(c), where the defectors' utility starts above that of\nthe cooperators' and ends up below it. In the 4(b), one\nbenefits by cooperating when few of the others do and defecting when\nmost of the others cooperate. Bovens plausibly suggests that this\nshould be regarded as a many-player version of the game of chicken: go\nstraight if your opponent swerves and swerve if your opponent goes\nstraight. In 4(c), one benefits by defecting when most others do\nand cooperating when most others do. As Bovens suggests, this might be\nregarded as a many-person version of the stag hunt: hunt together or\nseparately if your opponent does likewise.  (Stag hunt is further\ndiscussed in\n section 8 below).\n The first possibility, as we have seen, meets conditions plausibly\nassociated with the PD. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)(b)\n\n(c)\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n",
