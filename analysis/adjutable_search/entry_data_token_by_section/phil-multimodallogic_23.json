    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Knowledge and Obligations\n4.8 Knowledge and Obligations\n\nEqually important is the relationship between knowledge and\nobligations, as it is shown by the aforementioned\n paradox of epistemic obligation,\n which arises within the fusion\n (section 3.1)\n of a\n standard deontic logic\n and a standard epistemic logic. But the relationship between these\nconcepts goes beyond their interaction in such a basic system. For\nexample, if an agent does not know about the existence of an\nobligation, should she be expected to fulfill it? In some cases the\nanswer seems to be \u201cno\u201d: a physician whose neighbor is\nhaving a heart attack has no obligation to provide assistance unless\nshe knows about the emergency. Still, in some other cases, the answer\nseems to be \u201cyes\u201d: the juridical principle\n\u201cignorantia juris non excusat\u201d (roughly,\nignorance of the law is not excuse) is an example of this.\n\nThere have been proposals dealing with these issues. One of them is by\nPacuit, Parikh, & Cogan (2006), which uses a setting in which\nactions can be considered \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. It\nintroduces a notion of knowledge-based obligation under which\nan agent is obliged to perform an action \\(\\alpha\\) if and only if\n\\(\\alpha\\) is an action which the agent can perform and she\nknows that it is good to perform \\(\\alpha\\). This is then a\nform of absolute obligation which remains until the agent\nperforms the required action.\n\nInterestingly, the involvement of knowledge gives raise to forms of\n\u2018defeasible\u2019 obligations that can disappear in the light\nof new information. For example, having being informed about her\nneighbor\u2019s illness, the physician could have the obligation to\nadminister a certain drug; however, this obligation would disappear if\nshe were to learn that the neighbor is allergic to this medication.\nThis \u2018weaker\u2019 form of obligation can also be captured\nwithin the setting discussed in Pacuit et al. (2006).\n\nThe interaction between knowledge and obligations is not limited to\nthe way knowledge \u2018defines\u2019 obligations. An important role\nis also played by whether the agent consciously violates her\ncommitments. In fact, most juridical systems contain the principle\nthat an act is only unlawful if the agent conducting it has a\n\u2018guilty mind\u2019 (mens rea): for the agent to be\nguilty, she must have committed the act intentionally/purposely. Of\ncourse, there are different levels of \u2018guilty minds\u2019, and\nsome legal systems distinguish between them in order to assign\n\u2018degrees of culpability\u2019 (e.g., an homicide is considered\nmore severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally). For\nexample, on the one hand, stating that it is illegal to do \\(\\alpha\\)\nnegligently means that it is illegal to do \\(\\alpha\\) while\nbeing aware that the action carries a substantial and unjustifiable\nrisk. On the other hand, stating that it is illegal to do \\(\\alpha\\)\nknowingly means that it is illegal to do \\(\\alpha\\) while\nbeing certain that this conduct will lead to the\n result.[17]\n These and other modes of mens rea are formalized in Broersen\n(2011) within the\n STIT\n logic framework.\n",
