    "main_text": "Generalized 2D Semantics || Objections to generalized 2D semantics\n2.4 Objections to generalized 2D semantics\n\nThe G2D framework has attracted a wide variety of criticisms,\ntargeting its commitment to apriori conceptual analysis, its claim\nthat 1-intentions capture a type of meaning, and its internalist\napproach to assigning contents. The specific rationalist and\nempiricist applications of the G2D framework have also been\ncriticized. For a survey of these lines of criticism: see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nObjections to generalized 2D semantics\n\n",
