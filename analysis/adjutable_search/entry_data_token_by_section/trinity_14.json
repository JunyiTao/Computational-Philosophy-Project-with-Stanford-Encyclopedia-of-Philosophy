    "main_text": "Three-self Theories || Trinity Monotheism\n2.5 Trinity Monotheism\n\nThe Trinity monotheist says that even though there are three divine\nPersons, there is one God because there is one Trinity (Moreland and\nCraig 2017, 588; Craig 2006; Layman 1988, 2016). William Lane Craig\nhas defended the best known such theory. The aim is to go beyond mere\nanalogies, providing a literal model of how to understand traditional\ntrinitarian claims.\n\nCraig and Moreland offer Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek\nmythology as \u201can image of the Trinity among creatures\u201d\n(592). The point of this fictional example is that Cerberus would be\none dog with three \u201ccenters of consciousness\u201d. Though only\nparts of one dog, each head is literally canine. If we were to upgrade\nthe mental capacity of the three here, it would be one dog which is\nthree persons. And if we imagine that Cerberus survives\ndeath, in that case we can\u2019t say that the three are one dog\nbecause they have one body. In fact, we\u2019re now imagining one\n(canine) soul which supports three persons. Change canine to divine,\nand this is the model of the Trinity. (592\u20133)\n\nGod is an immaterial substance or soul endowed with three sets of\ncognitive faculties each of which is sufficient for personhood, so\nthat God has three centers of self-consciousness, intentionality, and\nwill\u2026the persons are [each] divine\u2026 since the model\ndescribes a God who is tri-personal. The persons are the minds of God.\n(Craig 2006, 101)\n\n\nOnly the Trinity, on this theory, is an instance of the divine nature,\nas the divine nature includes the property of being triune. (See\nsection\n 5.1.) \nBeyond the Trinity \u201cthere are no other instances of the divine\nnature\u201d (2017, 589). So if \u201cbeing divine\u201d means\n\u201cbeing identical with a divinity\u201d (i.e., being a thing\nwhich instantiates the nature divinity), then none of the Persons are\n\u201cdivine\u201d. But the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each\n\u201cdivine\u201d in that they are parts of the one God, somewhat\nas the bones of a cat are \u201cfeline\u201d, or as the heads of\nCerberus are \u201ccanine\u201d (592).\n\nBut the theory also makes the Persons \u201cdivine\u201d in other\nways too. In a sense the theory divides the divine attributes between\nthe Persons and the Trinity.\n\n\u2026when we ascribe omnipotence and omniscience to God, we are not\nmaking the Trinity a fourth person or agent. Divine attributes like\nomniscience, omnipotence and goodness are grounded in the\npersons\u2019 possessing these properties, while divine attributes\nlike necessity, aseity and eternity are not so grounded. With respect\nto the latter, the persons have these properties because God as a\nwhole has them. For parts can have some properties in virtue of the\nwholes of which they are parts. \u2026The point is\u2026 [the\npersons\u2019] deity seems in no way diminished because they are not\ninstances of the divine nature. (590)\n\n\nLike Swinburne (see section\n 2.3)\n Craig argues that it is impossible for God to be a single Person\nbecause \u201cif God is perfectly loving by his very nature, he must\n[eternally] be giving himself in love to another\u201d (593). And\nsince God is free not to create, but must be loving another,\n\u201cthe other to whom God\u2019s love is necessarily directed must\nbe internal to God himself\u201d (ibid.). For Craig this is\na plausibility argument rather than a strict proof, in support of the\nclaim that the concept of unipersonal God is incoherent. Unlike\nSwinburne, he does not seem to think that this argument is important\nto reasonable belief in the Trinity (Craig believes the Trinity can\nsomehow be derived from the Bible\u2013on which see section 5.4), nor\ndoes Craig mount a philosophical argument for why there must be\nexactly three divine Persons.\n\nOne may object that this argument depends on an equivocation on the\nphrase \u201cperfectly loving\u201d. One who thinks that God is a\nperfect being must hold that God has the character trait of being\nperfectly loving, but this doesn\u2019t seem to imply the action of\nperfectly loving (i.e. engaging in the best kind of loving\nrelationship with another) (Lebens and Tuggy 2019).\n\nDaniel Howard-Snyder (2003) offers numerous objections to\nCraig\u2019s theory. First, it can\u2019t avoid either polytheism or\ndifferent levels of divinity, either of which would make it\nunorthodox. The Cerberus analogy is criticized on the grounds that it\nwould not be one dog with three minds, but rather, three dogs with\noverlapping bodies. (This seems clear in the parallel case of human\nconjoined twins; everyone considers them to be siblings, two humans\nwith overlapping bodies, not a human with two heads.) While\nCraig\u2019s theory upholds (with the creeds) one divine substance,\nby his own criteria each of the three Persons must be a substance as\nwell, and the account says that each Person is divine. Thus, the\ntheory implies polytheism (393\u20135). Here God is not a personal\nbeing, in the sense of being numerically identical with a certain\nself, even though it (God) has parts which are selves. Craig wants to\nsay, for example, that each of the three is all-knowing, and also that\nGod is all-knowing, in that God has parts which are all-knowing. But\nHoward-Snyder objects that,\n\n\u2026there can be no \u201clending\u201d of a property [i.e., a\nwhole \u201cgetting\u201d a property from one of its parts] unless\nthe borrower is antecedently the sort of thing that can have\nit\u2026.[Therefore,] Unless God is antecedently the sort of thing\nthat can act intentionally\u2014that is, unless God is a\nperson\u2014God cannot borrow the property of creating the heavens\nand the earth from the Son\u2026.All other [statements involving]\nacts attributed to God [in the Bible] will likewise turn out to be,\nstrictly and literally, false. (399\u2013400)\n\n\nAccording to Trinity monotheism, a thing can exemplify the divine\nnature without itself being a self. Nor can divinity include\nproperties which require being a self, e.g., being all-knowing, being\nperfectly free. This, Howard-Snyder argues, is \u201can abysmally\nlow\u201d view of the divine nature, since \u201cIf God is not a\nperson or agent, then God does not know anything, cannot act, cannot\nchoose, cannot be morally good, cannot be worthy of worship\u201d\n(401).\n\nCraig replies to Howard-Snyder\u2019s objection to the Cerberus\nanalogy that the claim that it represents three dogs is\n\u201castonishing\u201d, as we all speak of two headed snakes,\nturtles and such (Craig 2003, 102). While on Trinity monotheism God\nisn\u2019t identical to any personal being, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat God isn\u2019t \u201cpersonal\u201d. He is personal in the\nsense of having personal parts. Further, the view that God isn\u2019t\na self\n\n\u2026is part and parcel of Trinitarian\northodoxy\u2026Howard-Snyder assumes that God cannot have such\nproperties [i.e., knowledge, freedom, moral goodness,\nworship-worthiness] unless He is a person. But it seems to me that God\ncan have them if God is a soul possessing the rational faculties\nsufficient for personhood. If God were a soul endowed with a single\nset of rational faculties, then He could do all these things. By being\na more richly endowed soul, is God thereby somehow incapacitated?\n(105)\n\n\nAs to the charge of polytheism, Craig accuses Howard-Snyder of\nconfusing monotheism with unitarianism (106), i.e. assuming that the\nexistence of exactly one god entails that there is exactly one divine\nself. Finally, Craig argues that the issue of whether or not the Three\ncount as parts of God is unimportant (107\u201313). Tuggy (2013b)\npresses some of Howard-Snyder\u2019s objections, concluding that the\ntheory is either not monotheistic, or turns out to be a one-self\ntheory.\n\nStephen Layman (2016) has constructed a similar and arguably better\ndeveloped three-self Trinity theory. Motivated by the New Testament,\nLayman says that the three Persons of the Trinity are three selves\n(124\u201331). Each is \u201cdivine\u201d in that he is a fitting\nobject of worship, and so is God the Trinity. God the Trinity is\nliterally a social entity, a concrete, primary substance which is\nstrongly analogous to a living thing, and which like a living thing is\na self-maintaining event (149\u201350). \u201cStrictly speaking,\nonly the Trinity, the community of divine persons, is God, that is,\nruler of all\u201d (148). Yet the Persons are \u201cof one\nsubstance\u201d in that \u201ceach belongs to the kind divine\nbeing\u201d, where this means a person which is a part of a god\n(150\u20131, 165\u20136).\n\nOne may object that a social entity can\u2019t be a god, as such a\nthing is merely an abstraction. Layman answers that social entities\nare concrete, not abstract, and can intentionally act (159\u201360).\nIntentionally acting requires having intentions, but social entities\nmay have these, even though they are not selves or even subjects of\nconsciousness. Social entities may have intentions because their parts\n(i.e. various selves) have them. As a fallback, Layman suggests the\nview that social entities may act even though they\u2019re incapable\nof intentional action (159). Like Craig, Layman argues that the\nTrinity can be omnipotent, perfectly good, and omniscient because its\npersons are (160). Why then is the Trinity not a fourth divine person\n(see section\n 3.1)?\n\nIn order to count as a person, an entity must be able to refer to\nitself rightly with the first-person singular pronoun \u201cI\u201d\n(or its equivalent). And the Trinity can not do this. (161)\n\n\nBut doesn\u2019t the Bible portray God as a self who speaks in the\nfirst-person? Layman concedes that the Old Testament does. But because\nthey believe in progressive divine revelation, Christians should read\nthe Old Testament as corrected by the New Testament. And in the New\nTestament arguably there are \u201cthree divine persons (conscious\nbeings)\u201d (164). Old Testament passages where \u201cGod\u201d\nspeaks first-person should be read as the Father speaking on behalf of\nthe Trinity (ibid.).\n\nThe account is not polytheism because only the Trinity is God, and\nbecause of the necessary unity of the three (160, 167). But\nisn\u2019t \u201cEvery divine person is a god\u201d true by\ndefinition? No, because \u201cdivine\u201d can mean relating to a\ngod (without being a god), and in this common meaning the Persons of\nthis theory are \u201cdivine\u201d. Similarly, a hand can be\n\u201chuman\u201d without itself being a human being (165).\n\nHow can the Son and Spirit be fully divine if each is caused by the\nFather and so does not exist a se? Layman answers that\n\u201cthe objector\u2019s intuition that divinity requires\naseity is not shared by those who drew up the [Nicene]\ncreed\u201d (167). Further, \u201cit seems to me that aseity is\nclearly not essential to divinity, that is, it is not essential for\nbeing worthy of worship\u201d (168). The qualities of omnipotence,\nomniscience, eternality, perfect goodness, and necessary existence are\nsufficient to guarantee the worship-worthiness of the Persons\n(ibid.).\n\nLike Swinburne and Craig, Layman argues that a God who is a single\nself is impossible. While aware than a theist may understand God to be\n\u201cperfectly loving\u201d in the sense of having a perfect\ndisposition to love which doesn\u2019t have to be actualized, Layman\nnonetheless asserts that\n\nThere is\u2026considerable plausibility in the claim that a truly\nsolitary person who throughout all eternity never expressed any love\nfor anyone would not be a perfectly loving person. (153)\n\n\nThus, given that God must be perfect independently of creation,\n\u201ca truly solitary person would not be divine, for it would not\nbe perfectly loving\u201d (154). Additionally, Layman argues that it\nis \u201cinconceivable\u201d that a divine Person should flourish\nwithout loving another, and that surely only the love of finite selves\nwould not be enough (154\u20135). A solitary divine Person would be\n\u201can appropriate object of pity\u201d (155). Again, Layman\nargues that the Bible suggests that a divine Person must have not only\nsplendor (exalted attributes) but also glory, \u201csomething at\nleast akin to fame\u2013a kind of recognition, approval, or\nappreciation\u201d which is conferred by another (156). A solitary\ndivine Person would be lacking this glory; but presumably a divine\nPerson must have glory. Thus, there couldn\u2019t be just one divine\nperson (156\u20137).\n\nLayman is skeptical about philosophical arguments purporting to show\nwhy there must be exactly three divine Persons, but he think\u2019s\nhe\u2019s shown why there can\u2019t be only one. The limit of\ndivine Persons to three, in his view, can only come from the Bible\n(157\u20138).\n\nTuggy (2015) objects to arguments that there can\u2019t be a single\ndivine self based on divine happiness or flourishing, urging instead\nthat a divine self who exists and is perfect of himself would\nautomatically be well-off, happy, or flourishing despite lacking\ncountless important goods. It is too anthropomorphic, he argues, to\nsuppose that a god or a divine self, like a human, is a social animal\nwhich can\u2019t flourish without interpersonal relationships.\n",
