    "main_text": "Life and main works\n1. Life and main works\n\nJuan Luis Vives was born in Valencia, Spain on March 6, 1493 (not\n1492, as is often found in the literature on him). His parents were\nJewish cloth merchants who had converted to Catholicism and who strove\nto live with the insecurities of their precarious situation. His\nfather, Luis Vives Valeriola (1453\u20131524), had been prosecuted in\n1477 for secretly practicing Judaism. A second trial took place in\n1522 and ended two years later when he was burned at the stake. His\nmother, Blanquina March (1473\u20131508), became a Christian in 1491,\none year before the decree expelling Jews from Spain. She died in 1508\nof the plague. Twenty years after her death, she was charged with\nhaving visited a clandestine synagogue. Her remains were exhumed and\npublicly burned.\n\nIn his youth, Vives attended the Estudio General of his hometown. In\n1509, he moved to Paris and enrolled as a freshman in the faculty of\narts. He was never to return to Spain. Vives began his studies at the\nColl\u00e8ge de Lisieux, where Juan Dolz had just started a\ntriennial course, but soon moved to the Coll\u00e8ge de Beauvais,\nwhere he attended the lectures of Jan Dullaert (d.1513). From the fall\nof 1512, Vives started to attend the course of the Aragonese Gaspar\nLax (1487\u20131560) at the Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu. Through\nNicolas B\u00e9rault (c.1470\u2013c.1545), who was an associate of\nGuillaume Bud\u00e9 (1467\u20131540) and taught at various colleges\nin Paris, Vives also came into contact with the Parisian humanist\ncircle.\n\nIn 1514, Vives left Paris without having taken any formal academic\ndegree and moved to the Low Countries. He settled in Bruges, where he\nwould spend most of his life. About this time, he was introduced to\nErasmus and appointed as tutor to the Flemish nobleman William of\nCroy. From 1517 until Croy\u2019s premature death in 1521, Vives\nlived in Louvain and taught at the Collegium Trilingue, a humanist\nfoundation based on Erasmian educational principles. In this period he\nwrote \u2018Fabula de homine\u2019 (\u2018A Fable about\nMan,\u2019 1518), an early version of his views on the nature and\npurpose of mankind; De initiis, sectis et laudibus\nphilosophiae (On the Origins, Schools and Merits of\nPhilosophy, 1518), a short essay on the history of philosophy;\nIn pseudodialecticos (Against the\nPseudo-Dialecticians, 1519), a lively and trenchant attack on\nscholastic logic; as well as a critical edition, with an extensive\ncommentary, of Augustine\u2019s De civitate Dei (City of\nGod, 1522), which was commissioned by Erasmus.\n\nFrom 1523 to 1528, Vives divided his time between England, which he\nvisited on six occasions, and Bruges, where he married Margarita\nValldaura in 1524. In England he attended the court of Henry VIII and\nCatherine of Aragon, and was tutor to their daughter, Mary. He also\nheld a lectureship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and associated\nwith English humanists such as Thomas More and Thomas Linacre. During\nthese years he published De institutione feminae Christianae\n(The Education of a Christian Woman, 1524), in which he set\nout pedagogical principles for the instruction of women; the extremely\npopular Introductio ad sapientiam (Introduction to\nWisdom, 1524), a short handbook of ethics, blending Stoicism and\nChristianity; and De subventione pauperum (On Assistance\nto the Poor, 1526), a program for the organization of public\nrelief, which he dedicated to the magistrates of Bruges. In 1528 he\nlost the favor of Henry VIII by siding with his fellow countrywoman\nCatherine of Aragon in the matter of the divorce. He was placed under\nhouse arrest for a time, before being allowed to return to Bruges.\n\nThe last twelve years of Vives\u2019 life were his most productive,\nand it was in this period that he published several of the works for\nwhich he is best known today. These include De concordia et\ndiscordia in humano genere (On Concord and Discord in\nHumankind, 1529), a piece of social criticism emphasizing the\nvalue of peace and the absurdity of war; De disciplinis\n(On the Disciplines, 1531), an encyclopedic treatise\nproviding an extensive critique of the foundations of contemporary\neducation, as well as a program for its renewal; and De anima et\nvita (On the Soul and Life, 1538), a study of the soul\nand its interaction with the body, which also contains a penetrating\nanalysis of the emotions. De veritate fidei Christianae\n(On the Truth of the Christian Faith), the most thorough\ndiscussion of his religious views, was published posthumously in 1543.\nHe died in Bruges on May 6, 1540.\n",
