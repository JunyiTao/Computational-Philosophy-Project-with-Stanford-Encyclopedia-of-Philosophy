    "main_text": "History of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n1. History of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n\nThe history of the pragmatic theory of truth is tied to the history of\nclassical American pragmatism. According to one standard account, C.S.\nPeirce gets credit for first proposing a pragmatic theory of truth,\nWilliam James is responsible for popularizing the pragmatic theory,\nand John Dewey subsequently reframed truth in terms of warranted\nassertibility (for this reading of Dewey see Burgess & Burgess\n2011: 4). More specifically, Peirce is associated with the idea that\ntrue beliefs are those that will withstand future scrutiny; James with\nthe idea that true beliefs are dependable and useful; Dewey with the\nidea that truth is a property of well-verified claims (or\n\u201cjudgments\u201d).\n",
