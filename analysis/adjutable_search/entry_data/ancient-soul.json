    "preamble": "\n\n\nAncient philosophical theories of soul are in many respects sensitive\nto ways of speaking and thinking about the soul [psuch\u00ea]\nthat are not specifically philosophical or theoretical. We therefore\nbegin with what the word \u2018soul\u2019 meant to speakers of\nClassical Greek, and what it would have been natural to think about\nand associate with the soul. We then turn to various Presocratic\nthinkers, and to the philosophical theories that are our primary\nconcern, those of Plato (first in the Phaedo, then in the\nRepublic), Aristotle (in the De Anima or On the\nSoul), Epicurus, and the Stoics.  These are by far the most\ncarefully worked out theories of soul in ancient philosophy.  Later\ntheoretical developments \u2014 for instance, in the writings of\nPlotinus and other Platonists, as well as the Church Fathers \u2014\nare best studied against the background of the classical theories,\nfrom which, in large part, they derive.\n\n Adopting a bird's-eye view of the terrain that we will be covering,\nand setting many details aside for the moment, we can describe it as\nfollows. From comparatively humble Homeric beginnings, the word\n\u2018soul\u2019 undergoes quite remarkable semantic expansion in\nsixth and fifth century usage.  By the end of the fifth century\n\u2014 the time of Socrates' death \u2014 soul is standardly thought\nand spoken of, for instance, as the distinguishing mark of living\nthings, as something that is the subject of emotional states and that\nis responsible for planning and practical thinking, and also as the\nbearer of such virtues as courage and justice. Coming to philosophical\ntheory, we first trace a development towards comprehensive\narticulation of a very broad conception of soul, according to which\nthe soul is not only responsible for mental or psychological functions\nlike thought, perception and desire, and is the bearer of moral\nqualities, but in some way or other accounts for all the vital\nfunctions that any living organism performs. This broad conception,\nwhich is clearly in close contact with ordinary Greek usage by that\ntime, finds its fullest articulation in Aristotle's theory. The\ntheories of the Hellenistic period, by contrast, are interested more\nnarrowly in the soul as something that is responsible specifically for\nmental or psychological functions. They either de-emphasize or sever\nthe ordinary-language connection between soul and life in all its\nfunctions and aspects.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Greek Notion of Soul\n\n The Homeric poems, with which most ancient writers can safely be\nassumed to be intimately familiar, use the word \u2018soul\u2019 in\ntwo distinguishable, probably related, ways. The soul is, on the one\nhand, something that a human being risks in battle and loses in\ndeath. On the other hand, it is what at the time of death departs from\nthe person's limbs and travels to the underworld, where it has a more\nor less pitiful afterlife as a shade or image of the deceased\nperson. It has been suggested (for instance, by Snell 1975, 19) that\nwhat is referred to as soul in either case is in fact thought of as\none and the same thing, something that a person can risk and lose and\nthat, after death, endures as a shade in the underworld. The\nsuggestion is plausible, but cannot be verified. In any case, once a\nperson's soul has departed for good, the person is dead. The presence\nof soul therefore distinguishes a living human body from a\ncorpse. However, this is plainly not to say that the soul is thought\nof as what accounts for, or is responsible for, the activities,\nresponses, operations and the like that constitute a person's\nlife. Homer never says that anyone does anything in virtue of, or\nwith, their soul, nor does he attribute any activity to the soul of a\nliving person. Thus, though the presence or absence of soul marks out\na person's life, it is not otherwise associated with that\nlife. Moreover, it is a striking feature of Homeric usage that, in\nFurley's words (Furley 1956, 4), to mention soul is to suggest death:\nsomeone's soul comes to mind only when their life is thought, by\nthemselves or others, to be at risk. Thus Achilles says that he is\ncontinuously risking his soul (Iliad 9.322), and Agenor\nreflects on the fact that even Achilles has just one soul\n(Iliad 11.569). It should also be pointed out that in the\nHomeric poems, only human beings are said to have (and to lose) souls.\nCorrespondingly, Homer never envisages shades or images of non-human\ncreatures in the underworld. These two facts taken together suggest\nthat in whatever precise way the soul is conceived of as associated\nwith life, it is in any case thought to be connected not with life in\ngeneral, or life in all its forms, but rather, more specifically, with\nthe life of a human being.\n \n Several significant developments occurred in the ways Greeks thought\nand spoke about the soul in the sixth and fifth centuries. The\nquestions about the soul that are formulated and discussed in the\nwritings of Plato and Aristotle to some extent arise from, and need to\nbe interpreted against the background of, these sixth and fifth\ncentury developments.  One factor that is of central importance is the\ngradual loss of the Homeric connection between mentioning a person's\nsoul and the thought that their life is vulnerable or at risk\n(contra Burnet 1916, 253). In ordinary fifth century Greek,\nhaving soul is simply being alive; hence the emergence, at about this\ntime, of the adjective \u2018ensouled\u2019 [empsuchos] as\nthe standard word meaning \u201calive\u201d, which was applied not\njust to human beings, but to other living things as well.  There is\nsome reason to think that the word \u2018soul\u2019 was used in this\nstraightforwardly positive way already in the sixth century. Thales of\nMiletus, who is credited with successfully predicting a solar eclipse\noccurring in 585, reportedly attributed soul to magnets, on the\ngrounds that magnets are capable of moving iron (Aristotle, De\nAnima 1.2, 405a19-21). Thales' thought was presumably that since\nit is distinctive of living things to be able to initiate movement,\nmagnets must in fact be alive or, in other words, ensouled. Thus,\nwhile Homer spoke of soul only in the case of human beings, in sixth\nand fifth century usage soul is attributed to every kind of living\nthing. What is in place, then, at this time is the notion that soul is\nwhat distinguishes that which is alive from that which is not. \n\n However, it is not just that soul is said to be present in every\nliving thing. It is also the case that an increasingly broad range of\nways of acting and being acted on is attributed to the soul. Thus it\nhas come to be natural, by the end of the fifth century, to refer\npleasure taken in food and drink, as well as sexual desire, to the\nsoul. (For detailed discussion, see Claus 1981, 73-85.) People are\nsaid, for example, to satisfy their souls with rich food (Euripides,\nIon 1170), and the souls of gods and men are claimed to be\nsubject to sexual desire (fragment assigned by Nauck to Euripides'\nfirst Hippolytus). In contexts of intense emotion or crisis,\nfeelings like love and hate, joy and grief, anger and shame are\nassociated with the soul. \u201cNothing bites the soul of a man more\nthan dishonor\u201d, says Ajax in a fragment from a tragedy of\nunknown authorship, just before he commits suicide (Nauck, TGF,\nAdesp. fr. 110).  Oedipus says that his soul laments the misery of\nhis city and its inhabitants (Oedipus Tyrannus 64). Moreover,\nthe soul is also importantly connected with boldness and courage,\nespecially in battle.  Courageous people are said, for instance in\nHerodotus and Thucydides, to have enduring or strong souls\n(cf. Laches' second definition of the virtue that is courage, in\nPlato's Laches 192c, as \u201cstrength of the soul\u201d;\nalso relevant is Pindar, Pythian 1.47-8, \u201cstanding in\nbattle with an enduring soul\u201d).  In the Hippocratic text\nAirs, Waters, Places, the soul is thought of as the place of\ncourage or, as the case may be, its opposite: in the case of lowland\ninhabitants, courage and endurance are not in their souls by nature,\nbut must be instilled by law (ch. 23); similarly in benign climates,\nmen are fleshy, ill-jointed, moist, without endurance and weak in soul\n(ch. 24). \n\n The connection between the soul and characteristics like boldness and\ncourage in battle is plainly an aspect of the noteworthy fifth century\ndevelopment whereby the soul comes to be thought of as the source or\nbearer of moral qualities such as, for instance, temperance and\njustice. In Pericles' funeral oration that Thucydides includes in his\naccount of the Peloponnesian War, he says that those who know most\nclearly the sweet and the terrible, and yet do not as a result turn\naway from danger, are rightly judged \u201cstrongest with regard to\nsoul\u201d (2.40.3). This text, and others like it (cf.  also\nHerodotus 7.153), indicate a semantic extension whereby\n\u2018soul\u2019 comes to denote a person's moral character, often,\nbut not always, with special regard to qualities such as endurance and\ncourage. While the connection with courage is obvious in a number of\ntexts, there are other texts in which the soul is the bearer of other\nadmirable qualities, such as a Euripidean fragment that speaks of the\ndesire characteristic of a soul that is just, temperate and good (fr.\n388). Hippolytus, in Euripides' play named after him, describes\nhimself as having a \u201cvirgin soul\u201d (Hippolytus\n1006), obviously to evoke his abstinence from sex. In Pindar's second\nOlympian, salvation is promised to those who \u201ckeep their souls\nfrom unjust acts\u201d (2.68-70). The last two texts mentioned may\nwell be influenced by Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs about the nature\nand immortality of the soul, to which we will turn in due course. But\nit would be a mistake to think that the moralization of the soul\n(i.e. its association with moral characteristics) wholly depended on\nOrphic and Pythagorean speculation. It would, at the very least, be to\ndisregard the soul's connection with courage in poetry, the historians\nand in Hippocratic writings.\n\n To educated fifth century speakers of Greek, it would have been\nnatural to think of qualities of soul as accounting for, and being\nmanifested in, a person's morally significant behavior. Pericles acts\ncourageously, and Hippolytus temperately (or chastely), because of the\nqualities of their souls from which such actions have a strong\ntendency to flow, and their actions express and make evident the\ncourage, temperance and the like that characterize their souls. Once\nwe are in a position properly to appreciate the connection between\nsoul and moral character that must already have been felt to be\nnatural at this stage, it should come as no surprise that the soul is\nalso taken to be something that engages in activities like thinking\nand planning. If the soul is, in some sense, responsible for\ncourageous acts, for instance, it is only to be expected that the soul\nalso grasps what, in the circumstances, courage calls for, and how, at\nsome suitable level of detail, the courageous act must be\nperformed. Thus in a speech of Antiphon, the jury is urged to\n\u201ctake away from the accused the soul that planned the\ncrime\u201d, in striking juxtaposition of the ideas of life-soul (as\nin Homer) and of soul as responsible for practical thought. Somewhat\nsimilarly, in a Sophoclean fragment (fr. 97) someone says that\n\u201ca kindly soul with just thoughts is a better inventor than any\nsophist\u201d (cf. also Euripides, Orestes 1180). Moreover, it\nis easy to see that there are connections between familiar uses of\n\u2018soul\u2019 in emotional contexts and attributions to the soul\nof cognitive and intellectual activities and achievements. There is,\nafter all, no clear-cut and manifest difference between, say, being in\nthe emotional state of fear and having a terrifying thought or\nperception. When Oedipus' soul laments, or Ajax's soul is bitten by\ndishonor, emotion obviously goes hand in hand with cognition, and if\nit is natural to refer the one to the soul, there should be nothing\npuzzling about attributions to it of the other. Thus in\nnon-philosophical Greek of the fifth century the soul is treated as\nthe bearer of moral qualities, and also as responsible for practical\nthought and cognition.  For further discussion, see this supplement\non the contrary claims of Burnet 1916: \n\nBurnet on the Greek Notion of Soul\n\n\n From Homer to the end of the fifth century, the word\n\u2018soul\u2019 undergoes remarkable semantic expansion, in the\ncourse of which it comes to be natural not only to speak of soul as\nwhat distinguishes the living from the dead and (not the same\ndistinction) the animate from the inanimate, but also to attribute to\nthe soul a wide variety of activities and responses, cognitive as well\nas emotional, and to think of it as the bearer of such virtues as\ncourage, temperance and justice. As a result of these developments,\nthe language made available something that Homeric Greek lacked, a\ndistinction between body and soul. Thus the Hippocratic author of\nAirs, Waters, Places writes of \u201cendurance in body and\nsoul\u201d (ch. 23).  Antiphon says of a defendant who is sure of his\ninnocence that though his body may surrender, his soul saves him by\nits willingness to struggle, through knowledge of its innocence. For\nthe guilty, on the other hand, even a strong body is to no avail,\nsince his soul fails him, \u201cbelieving the vengeance coming to him\nis for his impieties\u201d (Antiphon 5). Homer, by contrast, knows\nand speaks of a whole lot of different sources and bearers of\npsychological predicates, but lacks a word to pick out the soul as a\nsingle item to which the predicates in question can, in some way or\nother, be referred and which can be distinguished from, and in\nsuitable contexts contrasted with, the body (cf. Snell 1975,\n18-25). \n2. Presocratic Thinking about the Soul\n\n The semantic expansion of \u2018soul\u2019 in the sixth and fifth\ncenturies is reflected in the philosophical writings of the\nperiod. For instance, once it becomes natural to speak of soul as what\ndistinguishes the animate from the inanimate, rather than as something\nthat is restricted to humans, it becomes clear that the domain of\nensouled things is not limited to animals, but includes plants as\nwell. Empedocles and, apparently, Pythagoras (cf. Bremmer 1983, 125)\nthought that plants have souls, and that human souls, for instance,\ncan come to animate plants. (Note, though, that Empedocles, in extant\nfragments, rarely uses the word \u2018soul\u2019, preferring the\nword daim\u00f4n.) Empedocles in fact claimed to have been a\nbush in a previous incarnation, as well as, among other things, a bird\nand a fish (fr.  117, Kirk, Raven & Schofield 1983 [in what\nfollows KR&S], 417).  Incidentally, Empedocles, like Anaxagoras\nand Democritus, referred to plants as animals, presumably precisely\nbecause they are alive (z\u00ean, from which the word for\nanimal, z\u00f4on, derives) (for details, cf. Skemp 1947,\n56). In this he was followed by Plato (Timaeus 77b), but\nemphatically not by Aristotle (De Anima 2.2, 413b1f).\n\n There is, moreover, some reason to think that philosophical activity,\nnotably Pythagorean speculation (beginning around mid-sixth century),\ncontributed to the semantic expansion of \u2018soul\u2019. As we\nhave seen, at least some of the earliest extant texts that associate\nwith the soul moral virtues other than courage suggest Pythagorean\ninfluence. It is, in fact, not difficult to see how Pythagoreanism may\nhave furthered the expansion of \u2018soul\u2019.  Pythagoreanism\nwas concerned with, among other things, the continued existence of the\nperson (or something suitably person-like) after death. It is obvious\nthat against the Homeric background, \u2018soul\u2019 was an\neminently appropriate word to use so as to denote the person, or\nquasi-person, that continued to exist after death; there was, after\nall, the familiar Homeric use of \u2018soul\u2019 as that which\nendures in the underworld after a person's death. To make the\ncontinued existence of this soul significant as the continued\nexistence of the person in question, at least some of the states,\nactivities, operations and the like that seemed crucial to the\nidentity of the person had to be attributed to the soul (following\nFurley 1956, 11, who goes further than that, writing of the need for\nthe soul \u201cto include all the functions of\npersonality\u201d; cf. Barnes 1982, 103-6; Huffman forthcoming). This\ntendency is well illustrated by a story about Pythagoras, reported by\nXenophanes (fr. 7, KR&S 260): \u201cOnce, they say, he was\npassing by when a puppy was being whipped, and he took pity and said:\n\u2018Stop, do not beat it; it is the soul of a friend that I\nrecognized when I heard its [i.e., the soul's!]  voice.\u2019\u201d\nIt is not just that the soul of Pythagoras' friend accounts for the\ncharacter of the yelping (or whatever).  Pythagoras is in fact quoted\nas saying that it is his friend's soul that is doing the yelping! \n\n Heraclitus (fl. around 500 BC), who repeatedly mentions Pythagoras,\nattributes wisdom to the soul provided that it is in the right state\nor condition: \u201ca dry soul\u201d, he claims, \u201cis wisest\nand best\u201d (fr. 118, KR&S 230). He may have been the first\nthinker to articulate a connection between soul and motor\nfunctions. \u201cA man when he is drunk\u201d, Heraclitus remarks,\n\u201cis led by an unfledged boy, stumbling and not knowing where he\ngoes, having his soul moist\u201d (fr. 117, KR&S 231). On the\nmost plausible construal of Heraclitus' sentence, he is saying that\nthe drunken person stumbles because his perceptual abilities have been\nimpaired, and this impairment is due to moistness of soul (Schofield\n1991, 22). Like many (or indeed all) sixth and fifth century thinkers\nwho expressed views on the nature or constitution of the soul,\nHeraclitus thought that the soul was bodily, but composed of an\nunusually fine or rare kind of matter, e.g. air or fire. (A possible\nexception is the Pythagorean Philolaus, who may have held that the\nsoul is an \u2018attunement\u2019 of the body; cf. Barnes 1982,\n488-95,\n and Huffman.)\n The prevalence of the idea that the soul is bodily explains the\nabsence of problems about the relation between soul and body. Soul and\nbody were not thought to be radically different in kind; their\ndifference seemed just to consist in a difference in degree of\nproperties such as fineness and mobility. \n3. Plato's Theories of Soul\n\n The various developments that occurred in the sixth and fifth\ncenturies in how Greeks thought and spoke of the soul resulted in a\nvery complex notion that strikes one as remarkably close to\nconceptions of the soul that we find in fourth century philosophical\ntheories, notably Plato's.  There is thus some reason to think that\nthe philosophical theories in question are best interpreted as working\nwith, and on, the relatively non-theoretical notion of the soul that\nby the end of the fifth century has come to be embedded in ordinary\nlanguage. In what follows our main concern will be to characterize\nsome of the theories in question. But we should also attend, wherever\nthis seems appropriate and helpful, to ways in which familiarity with\nthe ordinary notion of the soul might enable us better to understand\nwhy a theory or an argument proceeds the way it does. In addition, we\nshould note ways in which philosophical theories might seem to clarify\nand further articulate the ordinary notion. We begin with Plato, and\nwith a question that is intimately tied up with the ordinary notion of\nthe soul as it developed from the Homeric poems onwards, namely\nwhether a person's soul does indeed survive the person's death.  \n3.1 The Phaedo's Theory of Soul\n\n It is probably true that in mainstream fifth century Greek culture,\nbelief in an afterlife of the soul was weak and unclear (Claus 1981,\n68; Burnet 1916, 248-9). If so, it is fitting that Socrates' arguments\nfor the immortality of the soul, most prominently in the\nPhaedo, are offered to interlocutors who, at the outset of the\ndiscussion, are by no means convinced of the idea. (In fact, in the\nApology, 40c, Socrates himself is presented as being\nnoncommittal about what happens to the soul at death, and even about\nwhether it survives at all.) \u201cMen find it very hard to\nbelieve\u201d, Cebes says at Phaedo 70a, \u201cwhat you said\nabout the soul. They think that after it has left the body it no\nlonger exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the\nday the man dies.\u201d This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as\nthe opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the\nidea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being\ndispersed, \u201clike breath or smoke\u201d (70a). Glaucon, in the\nlast book of the Republic (608d), is taken aback by\nSocrates' question,\n\n\n\u201cHaven't you realized that our soul is immortal and never\ndestroyed?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with wonder and said: \u201cNo, by god, I\nhaven't. Are you really in a position to assert that?\u201d\n\n\n Moreover, apart from the question of immortality or otherwise, there\nis the further question whether the soul, if it does have some form of\nexistence after the person has died, \u201cstill possesses some power\nand wisdom\u201d (Phaedo, 70b; cf. 76c).  Answering both\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\nexempt from destruction. However, the argument does not support such a\nstrong conclusion, and Socrates is aware of this.  \n\n What he does, in fact, conclude is that the soul is most like,\nand most akin to, intelligible being, and that the body is most\nlike perceptible and perishable being. To say this is plainly neither\nto assert nor to imply (as Robinson 1995, 30, appears to think) that\nsoul in some way or other falls short of intelligible, imperishable\nbeing, any more than it is to assert or imply that body in some way or\nother falls short of, or rather rises above, perceptible, perishable\nbeing. The argument leaves it open whether soul is a perfectly\nrespectable member of intelligible reality, the way human bodies are\nperfectly respectable members of perceptible reality, or whether,\nalternatively, soul has some intermediate status in between\nintelligible and perceptible being, rising above the latter, but\nmerely approximating to the former. Socrates does seem to take his\nconclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural\nfor the soul either \u201cto be altogether indissoluble, or nearly\nso\u201d, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to\ndissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular\nview has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\nthan the body.  However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates\ncan establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,\nconfidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced. Socrates'\nsoul may be a great deal more durable than his body, but as long as it\nis not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee that it will\nsurvive Socrates' impending death. For it might have experienced any\nnumber of incarnations already, and the current one might be its\nlast. So Socrates launches his most elaborate and final argument for\nthe immortality of the soul, which concludes that since life belongs\nto soul essentially, the soul must be deathless \u2014 that is,\nimmortal. \n\n The affinity argument is supposed to show not only that the soul is\nmost like intelligible, imperishable being, but also that it is most\nakin to it. Socrates argues that the soul is like intelligible being\non the grounds that it is not visible and, in general, not perceptible\n(anyhow to humans, as Cebes adds at 79b), and that it shares its\nnatural function with the divine, namely to rule and lead (the body in\nthe one case, mortals in the other). There is a separate argument for\nthe kinship of the soul with intelligible being. When the soul makes\nuse of the senses and attends to perceptibles, \u201cit strays and is\nconfused and dizzy, as if it were drunk\u201d (79c).  By contrast,\nwhen it remains \u201citself by itself\u201d and investigates\nintelligibles, its straying comes to an end, and it achieves stability\nand wisdom. It is not just that the soul is in one state or another\ndepending on which kind of object it is attending to, in such a way\nthat its state somehow corresponds to the character of the object\nattended to. That would not by itself show that the soul is more akin\nto the one domain rather than the other (this is the point of\nBostock's criticism, Bostock 1986, 119). To understand the argument\nproperly, it is crucial to note that when the soul attends to\nperceptibles, it is negatively affected in such a way that its\nfunctioning is at least temporarily reduced or impaired (\u201cdizzy,\nas if drunk\u201d), whereas there is no such interference when it\nattends to intelligibles (cf. Socrates' fear, at 99e, that by studying\nthings by way of the senses he might blind his soul). The claim that\nthe soul is akin to intelligible reality thus rests, at least in part,\non the view that intelligible reality is especially suited to the\nsoul, as providing it with a domain of objects in relation to which,\nand only in relation to which, it can function without inhibition and\ninterference and fully in accordance with its own nature, so as to\nachieve its most completely developed and optimal state, wisdom.\n\n It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\nbody and its desires and affections, \u201cespecially if it is a wise\nsoul\u201d (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain\nthat both of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things,\nincluding plants (cf. 70d, 71d). And in the final argument, Socrates\nexplicitly appeals to the idea that it is the soul that animates the\nbody of a living thing (105c): \n\nWhat is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? \u2014 A\nsoul.\n\n Now, as we have seen in some detail, the Greek notion of soul\nincluded the idea of soul as animating body probably as early as the\nsixth century, when Thales attributed soul to magnets. Connections\nbetween the soul and morally significant characteristics such as\ncourage, temperance and justice, and with cognitive and intellectual\nfunctions, notably with planning and practical thought, are firmly\nestablished in fifth century Greek usage. But it is obviously far from\nclear whether the ordinary notion of soul, as it develops from the\nHomeric poems down to the end of the fifth century, is a well-formed,\ncoherent notion, one that can suitably support the very prominent role\nthat Plato assigns to the soul, in the Phaedo as well as in\nother dialogues. Perhaps most pressingly, it is far from clear whether\nwhat distinguishes the animate from the inanimate is the very thing\nthat, in the case of some animate organisms, is responsible for\ncognitive functions such as sense-perception and thought, and that,\nspecifically in the case of human beings, is the bearer of moral\nqualities such as justice, courage and the like. The question is\nneither explicitly raised nor, of course, resolved in the\nPhaedo; but a passage in the Republic (352d-354a), with\nwhich we will be concerned in section 3.2, suggests that Plato took\nthe ordinary notion of soul, in all its richness and bewildering\ncomplexity, to be well-formed and coherent, and to be capable of\nsupporting the requirements of his own theory.\n\n Given the idea that soul is the distinguishing mark of all living\nthings, including plants, the Greek notion of soul is, as we have seen\nalready, broader than our concept of mind. For it is at least\nconceivable, and probably true as a matter of fact, that there are\nliving (hence ensouled) organisms without minds, without, that is to\nsay, desire and cognition by sense or intellect. (Plato appears to\nthink that plants do have minds in this sense, because he takes them\nto exhibit desire and sense-perception (Timaeus 77b), but that\nis presumably supposed to be a matter of empirical fact or inference,\nrather than simply a consequence of the fact that plants have souls.)\n\n\n In another way, the conception of soul that is in evidence in the\nPhaedo is significantly narrower than our concept of mind, in\nthat the soul, as conceived of in this particular dialogue, is not, in\nfact, responsible, or directly responsible, for all of a\nperson's mental or psychological activities and responses, but only\nfor a rather severely limited subset of them. Socrates attributes a\nlarge variety of mental states (etc.) not to the soul, but to the\n(animate) body, such as, for instance, beliefs and pleasures (83d),\nand desires and fears (94d). At the same time, the soul is not\nnarrowly intellectual: it too has desires (81d), even passionate ones\n(such as the nonphilosophical soul's love [er\u00f4s] of the\ncorporeal, 80b), and pleasures as well, such as the pleasures of\nlearning (114e). Moreover, the soul's functions are, as we have seen\nalready, not restricted to grasping and appreciating truth, but\nprominently include regulating and controlling the body and its\naffections (such as beliefs and pleasures, desires and fears), no\ndoubt in light of suitable judgments, arrived at, or anyhow supported\nand controlled, by reasoning. The soul of the Phaedo in fact\nseems to be precisely what in Republic 4 is identified as just\none part of the soul, namely reason, whereas the functions of the\nlower parts, appetite and spirit, are assigned, in the psychological\nframework of the Phaedo, to the animate body. And just as the\nfunctions of reason (in the Republic) and of the soul (in the\nPhaedo) are not restricted to cognition, but include desire and\nemotion, such as desire for and pleasure in learning, so the functions\nof non-rational soul (in the Republic) and of the body (in the\nPhaedo) are not restricted to desire and emotion, but include\ncognition, such as beliefs (presumably) about objects of desire,\n\u2018descriptive\u2019 or (rather) non-evaluative (\u201cthere's\nfood over there\u201d) as well as (contra Lovibond 1991, 49)\nevaluative (\u201cthis drink is delightful\u201d) (cf. Phaedo\n83d).\n\n One somewhat surprising, and perhaps puzzling, feature of the\nPhaedo framework is this. On the one hand, Socrates evidently\ntakes the soul to be in some way responsible for the life of any\nliving organism, and hence presumably for all the various\nactivities (etc.) that constitute, or are crucially involved in, any\norganism's life. On the other hand, he also takes it that there is a\nrestricted class of activities that the soul is responsible for in\nsome special way, such that it is not actually the case that the\nsoul is responsible in this special way for all of the relevant\nactivities that living organisms engage in.  Thus, given the idea that\nthe soul is responsible, in some way or other, for all the life of any\nliving organism, one would certainly expect it to be responsible, in\nsome way or other, for (say) the desires, emotions and beliefs of\norganisms whose lives include such psychological states \u2014 and\nnot just for some restricted subset of these desires, emotions and\nbeliefs, but in fact for all of them. However, Socrates' attribution\nto the soul of all and only desires, emotions and beliefs of\nreason (to use the Republic framework) is actually quite\ncompatible with the view that the soul is responsible for all the\nlife-activities organisms engage in, including, of course, the desires\n(etc.) of what in the Republic framework is the non-rational\nsoul. What Socrates needs is something that can certainly be supplied,\nsome suitable articulation of the different ways in which the soul can\nbe said to be responsible for relevant activities of a living\norganism. One such way is that to be capable of engaging in the\nactivity in question at all, an organism has to be ensouled, perhaps\nensouled in a certain way (for instance, in the way animals are rather\nthan in the way plants are).  Another (stronger) way in which the soul\ncan be responsible for an activity is directly: rather than\nbeing the thing in virtue of which the organism can do or undergo\nsomething or other (for instance, becoming thirsty and forming the\ndesire to drink on that basis), the soul can also perform activities\nin its own right (for instance, contemplating mathematical truths).\nSo, to restate somewhat more clearly: the Phaedo's conception\nof soul is narrower than our concept of mind in the following way. The\nrange of activities (etc.) that the soul is directly responsible for,\nand which may be described as activities of the soul strictly\nspeaking, is significantly narrower than the range of mental\nactivities. It does not include all of a person's desires, nor need it\ninclude all emotional responses, or even all beliefs. One plainly\ncould not have (for instance) \u2018bodily\u2019 desires such as\nhunger and thirst without being ensouled, but that does not mean that\nit must be the soul itself that forms or sustains such desires.  \n\n Once we properly understand the Phaedo's theory of soul, then,\nwe are in a position to see that it offers a psychological framework\nthat is coherent, though far from fully articulated. But we should\nalso note that the theory is somewhat unsatisfactory, in that it\nappears rather strikingly to fail to do justice to the unity of the\nmind. The various activities (etc.) that we characterize as mental or\npsychological, such as (most importantly) desire and cognition, seem\nto be, or manifest themselves to us as being, the activities of a\nsingle integrated subject; they do not (ordinarily) appear to belong\nto a plurality of distinct items that operate more or less separately\nfrom one another.  When Socrates' contemplation of mathematical truths\nis disrupted by an intense desire for food, it does not seem to be the\ncase that it is one thing (say, his soul) that has been doing the\ncontemplating and another thing (say, his body) that now wants to get\nsomething to eat. It is rather that both contemplation and desire to\neat seem to belong to one integrated subject, regardless of whether we\nwish to say that the subject in question is Socrates' mind, or whether\nwe prefer to say that it is Socrates insofar as he has a mind (or\nsomething like that). As things are, the psychological theory of the\nPhaedo assigns Socrates' contemplation directly to his soul,\nbut leaves his desire for food curiously remote from it, apparently\ntaking \u2018bodily\u2019 desire (for instance) to be related to the\nsoul in much the same way in which the operations involved in (say)\nmetabolism and growth are so related. (Those too take place only\nbecause his body is ensouled.) It is plausible, though not certain,\nthat Plato felt the force of this problem. It is, in any case,\nresolved by the new theory of soul that the Republic\npresents. \n3.2 The Republic's Theory of Soul\n\n The Phaedo was also known to ancient readers as Plato's On\nthe Soul, whereas the Republic has On Justice as an\nalternative ancient title. Plato, however, conceives of justice as the\nexcellent state of the soul, and so it is not surprising that the\nRepublic sheds a great deal of light on Plato's conception of\nthe soul. One way in which it does so is by explicitly integrating a\nnumber of central features of the ordinary notion of soul, features\nwhich, in the Phaedo, coexist somewhat uneasily: namely,\nresponsibility for the life of an organism (that is, in the human\ncase, responsibility for its being and remaining alive as a human\nbeing), for cognitive and (especially) intellectual functions, and for\nmoral virtues such as courage and justice.  Towards the end of\nRepublic 1, Socrates offers Thrasymachus an elaborate argument\nto the conclusion that \u201cinjustice is never more profitable than\njustice\u201d (354a). If we set aside, as irrelevant to the\ndialectical context, the possibility that injustice and justice are\nequally profitable, it is clear that the conclusion here is\nequivalent to the position that the Republic is designed to\nestablish, in response to Glaucon's request, at the beginning of Book\n2, to be convinced by Socrates \u201cthat it is better in every way\nto be just than to be unjust\u201d (357a). The argument at the end of\nBook 1 proceeds by attempting to prove an interim conclusion that is\nunnecessarily strong, namely that the just person is happy, whereas\nthe unjust person is wretched. To establish the desired conclusion, it\nis enough to prove that the just person is always happier than\nthe unjust person, which, unlike the unnecessarily strong interim\nconclusion, is compatible with the view that justice is not sufficient\nfor (fully completed) happiness, since that requires suitable external\ncircumstances in addition to justice. Nothing in Socrates' long answer\nto Glaucon (and Adeimantus) commits him to the view that justice is\nsufficient for (complete) happiness (cf. Irwin 1999). However, that\nview is not implied by the conception of the soul that Socrates relies\non in this (Book 1) argument.  Moreover, nothing in the\nRepublic contradicts or modifies this conception of the soul\n(on the contrary: cf.  445a9f., 609b f.), and so there is no reason\nnot to take it seriously as a contribution to Plato's on-going\nreflection on the soul, even though the argument that surrounds it is\ndesigned to support a conclusion that Socrates subsequently succeeds\nin avoiding. \n\n The argument begins with the premise that things perform their\nfunction well if they have the virtue appropriate to them, and badly\nif they have the relevant vice (353c). It then attributes to the soul\nthe function of \u201ccaring for things, ruling and deliberating (and\nall the things of this kind)\u201d, and adds that living is\nalso part of the function of soul (353d). This yields an interim\nconclusion, that a good soul cares, rules, deliberates (etc.) and\nlives well, whereas a bad soul does these things badly. A third\npremise is that justice is the virtue appropriate to the soul,\ninjustice being its vice. Hence another interim conclusion: a just\nsoul lives well; an unjust one, badly. But living well, says the next\npremise, is being happy (and living badly is being wretched). And so\nSocrates can draw the interim conclusion that we have encountered\nalready, which is that the just person (the person, that is, whose\nsoul is just) is happy, whereas the person whose soul is unjust is\nwretched.\n\n We make nonsense of the argument if we suppose (with Robinson 1995,\n36) that when Socrates introduces living as part of the\nfunction of soul, he has being alive in mind. The idea of being\ngood (or bad) at being alive is, obviously, very odd, as is the idea\nof being alive well or badly. But there is no need to suppose that\nsuch ideas are involved here, or that Socrates passes from one sense\nof \u2018living\u2019 [to z\u00ean] to another. It is, after\nall, open to us to interpret what Socrates is saying in terms of a\nconception that integrates the things that Socrates attributes to the\nsoul as functions, or as parts or aspects of its function, namely in\nterms of the conception of living a life, and not just any kind of\nlife, but a distinctively human one. Caring for the right sorts of\nthings in the right way, ruling or regulating oneself and (when\nappropriate) others, and deliberating about how to act are not just\nnecessary, but central aspects of living a human life, and all of\nthese things can be done well or badly. Depending on the condition of\ntheir soul, a person can be better or worse at doing these things. The\njust person, whose soul is in the best condition, is truly excellent\nat living a human life, in that they are excellent at doing the\nvarious things that are importantly involved in leading a\ndistinctively human life. If this is along the right lines, we might\nbe in a position to see Plato's answer to the question how it can be\nthat one thing, the soul, accounts for the life of an organism as well\nas for its cognitive and intellectual functions, and is also the\nbearer of virtues or excellences. The answer suggested by the Book 1\nargument is this. The way in which the human soul accounts for the\nlife of a human organism is by accounting for the distinctively human\nlife that the individual in question leads. But to account for such a\nlife, it must also account for the cognitive and intellectual\nfunctions which guide and shape such a life. Moreover, the dramatic\ndifferences in how good people are at leading lives, and relatedly the\ndramatic differences in how well they exercise their cognitive and\nintellectual functions, are due to differences in the conditions of\ntheir souls, namely the presence or absence of the virtues of justice,\nwisdom, courage and temperance. This answer significantly clarifies\n(the relevant aspects of) the ordinary Greek notion of soul (see\nsection 1).\nThe Republic also puts forward a new theory of soul, which\ninvolves the claim that the embodied human soul has (at least) three\nparts or aspects, namely reason, spirit and appetite. The argument for\nthis claim is presented in Book 4, and proceeds in roughly the\nfollowing way. Socrates begins by enunciating a principle to the\neffect that opposite actions, affections and states cannot be assigned\nto one thing in respect of the same part of it, in relation to the\nsame object and at the same time. It is then agreed that desiring and\nbeing averse are opposites, and hence that desiring to do something\nand being averse to doing that same thing are opposites in relation to\nthe same object. But it does frequently happen, Socrates points out\nand Glaucon agrees, that the soul desires to do something and at the\nsame time is averse to doing that same thing. This happens, for\ninstance, when a person is thirsty and on that basis wants to drink,\nbut at the same time wishes not to drink, on the basis of some\ncalculation or deliberation, and in fact succeeds in refraining from\ndrinking, thirsty though they are. It follows from the premises stated\nthat the human soul includes at least two distinct subjects, so that\none opposite (the desire to drink) can be assigned to one of them and\nthe other (the aversion to drinking) can be assigned to the\nother. Taking himself to have identified reason and appetite as\ndistinct parts of the soul, Socrates draws attention to other kinds of\nconflict between desires, which are meant to bring to light spirit,\nthe third part of the soul. \n\n The Republic contains a great deal of information that we can\nrely on in characterizing the three parts of the soul that Socrates\nintroduces, information that can be found not only in Book 4 itself,\nbut also (among other places) in the catalogue of corrupt forms of\ncity and soul in Books 8 and 9.  Here is an outline of what\nemerges. Reason is the part of the soul that is, of its own nature,\nattached to knowledge and truth. It is also, however, concerned to\nguide and regulate the life that it is, or anyhow should be, in charge\nof, ideally in a way that is informed by wisdom and that takes into\nconsideration the concerns both of each of the three parts separately\nand of the soul as a whole (442c); these concerns must be supposed to\ninclude a person's bodily needs, presumably via the concerns of\nappetite. The natural attachment of spirit is to honor and, more\ngenerally, to recognition and esteem by others (581a). As a motivating\nforce it generally accounts for self-assertion and ambition. When its\ndesires are frustrated, it gives rise to emotional responses such as\nanger and indignation, and to behavior that expresses and naturally\nflows from such responses.  Socrates takes spirit to be a natural ally\nof reason, at least part of its function being to support reason in\nsuch conflicts as may arise between it and appetite (440ef, 442ab). To\nassign it this function is neither to say nor to imply that spirit\ncannot, in the case of a corrupt and de-natured soul, turn against\nreason, even if well brought-up individuals like Glaucon are not\nfamiliar with such corruption either in their own case or in the case\nof others (440b). (Pace Robinson 1995, 45, who thinks Socrates\nis contradicting himself here.) Appetite is primarily concerned with\nfood, drink and sex (439d, 580e). It gives rise to desires for these\nand other such things which in each case are based, simply and\nimmediately, on the thought that obtaining the relevant object of\ndesire is, or would be, pleasant. Socrates also calls appetite the\nmoney-loving part, because, in the case of mature human beings at\nleast, appetite also tends to be strongly attached to money, given\nthat it is most of all by means of money that its primary desires are\nfulfilled (580e-581a). The idea must be that given suitable\nhabituation and acculturation in the context of a life lived in human\nsociety, appetite tends to become attached to money in such a way that\nit begins to give rise to desires for money which in each case are\nbased, simply and immediately, on the thought that obtaining money is,\nor would be, pleasant; and this idea is natural and plausible\nenough. (Irwin 1995 & Price 1995, 57-67, offer an alternative and\nincompatible interpretation.)\n\n Viewed from the perspective of the theory of soul presented in the\nPhaedo, the Republic theory involves not so much a\ndivision of soul as an integration into soul of mental or\npsychological functions that had been assigned, somewhat\nproblematically, to the body. In both dialogues, Socrates appeals to\nthe same Odyssey passage (Od. 20.17-18 at Phaedo\n94d, Od.  20.17 at Republic 4, 441b), in which Odysseus\nprevails over his own anger: in the Phaedo, to exemplify a\nconflict between soul and body; in the Republic, to exemplify a\nconflict between two parts or aspects of the soul, reason and spirit.\nWhat the Republic offers is a theory of soul which, among other\nthings, allows attribution of (in principle) all mental or\npsychological functions to a single subject, the soul. The theory thus\nrespects the unity of the mind, in a way that the Phaedo theory\ndoes not. Moreover, the Republic theory also offers an\nattractive and well-supported articulation of desire into different\nkinds, which has profound implications both for what it is to have\none's soul (or mind) in optimal condition and for how it is that this\ncondition is best brought about. (To see that Plato is acutely aware\nof these implications, one only needs to look at what the\nRepublic has to say about virtue and education.)  However, it\nmay be worth insisting once more that we should not disregard the fact\nthat the conception of the soul that features in the Republic\nis broader than our concept of mind, in that it continues to be part\nof this conception that it is soul that accounts for the life of the\nrelevant ensouled organism. But if it is soul that accounts for the\nlife of, say, human organisms, there must be some sense in which the\nhuman soul accounts not only for mental functions like thought and\ndesire, but also for other vital functions such as the activities and\noperations of the nutritive and reproductive systems. To the extent\nthat it leaves unclear how exactly it is that the soul is related to a\nbroad range of activities (etc.) that are crucially involved in the\nlives of ensouled organisms, Plato's theory of the soul, in the\nRepublic and beyond, remains incompletely developed. It is, of\ncourse, not surprising that the Republic does not confront the\nquestion how it is that the soul is related to life-functions that, as\nAristotle recognizes (Nicomachean Ethics 1.13, 1102b11-2), are\nirrelevant to the ethical and political concerns of the\nRepublic. However, context and subject matter impose no such\nconstraints on the \u2018plausible myth\u2019 of the Timaeus,\nand also that dialogue, in presenting a somewhat revised version of\nthe Republic's account (Tim. 69c ff.), fails to address\nthe question how the soul is related to non-mental vital\nfunctions.\n4. Aristotle's Theory of Soul\n\n Aristotle's theory, as it is presented primarily in the De\nAnima (for a complete account,\n see Aristotle's Psychology),\n comes very close to providing a comprehensive, fully developed\naccount of the soul in all its aspects and functions, an account that\narticulates the ways in which all of the vital functions of all\nanimate organisms are related to the soul. In doing so, the theory\ncomes very close to offering a comprehensive answer to a question that\narises from the ordinary Greek notion of soul, namely how precisely it\nis that the soul, which is agreed to be in some way or other\nresponsible for a variety of things living creatures (especially\nhumans) do and experience, also is the distinguishing mark of the\nanimate. According to Aristotle's theory, a soul is a particular kind\nof nature, a principle that accounts for change and rest in the\nparticular case of living bodies, i.e. plants, nonhuman animals and\nhuman beings. The relation between soul and body, on Aristotle's view,\nis also an instance of the more general relation between form and\nmatter: thus an ensouled, living body is a particular kind of\nin-formed matter. Slightly simplifying things by limiting ourselves to\nthe sublunary world (cf. De Anima 2.2, 413a32; 2.3, 415a9), we\ncan describe the theory as furnishing a unified explanatory framework\nwithin which all vital functions alike, from metabolism to reasoning,\nare treated as functions performed by natural organisms of suitable\nstructure and complexity. The soul of an animate organism, in this\nframework, is nothing other than its system of active abilities to\nperform the vital functions that organisms of its kind naturally\nperform, so that when an organism engages in the relevant activities\n(e.g., nutrition, movement or thought) it does so in virtue of the\nsystem of abilities that is its soul. \n\n Given that the soul is, according to Aristotle's theory, a system of\nabilities possessed and manifested by animate bodies of suitable\nstructure, it is clear that the soul is, according to Aristotle, not\nitself a body or a corporeal thing. Thus Aristotle agrees with the\nPhaedo's claim that souls are very different from bodies.\nMoreover, Aristotle seems to think that all the abilities that are\nconstitutive of the souls of plants, beasts and humans are such that\ntheir exercise involves and requires bodily parts and organs. This is\nobviously so with, for instance, the abilities for movement in respect\nof place (e.g., by walking or flying), and for sense-perception, which\nrequires sense-organs. Aristotle does not, however, think that there\nis an organ of thought, and so he also does not think that the\nexercise of the ability to think involves the use of a bodily part or\norgan that exists specifically for this use. Nevertheless, he does\nseem to take the view that the activity of the human intellect always\ninvolves some activity of the perceptual apparatus, and hence requires\nthe presence, and proper arrangement, of suitable bodily parts and\norgans; for he seems to think that sensory impressions\n[phantasmata] are somehow involved in every occurrent act of\nthought, at least as far as human beings are concerned (De\nAnima 3.7, 431a14-7; 3.8, 432a7-10; cf. De Memoria 1,\n449b31ff.). If so, Aristotle in fact seems to be committed to the view\nthat, contrary to the Platonic position, even human souls are not\ncapable of existence and (perhaps as importantly) activity\napart from the body (cf. De Anima 1.1, 403a3-25,\nesp. 5-16).\n\n It is noteworthy that Aristotle's theory does not mark off those\nvital functions that are mental by relating them to the soul in some\nspecial way that differs from and goes beyond the way in which vital\nfunctions in general are so related. It is certainly not part of\nAristotle's theory that the soul is specially and directly responsible\nfor mental functions by performing them on its own, whereas it is less\ndirectly responsible for the performance by the living organism of\nother vital functions such as growth. As this aspect of his theory\nsuggests, Aristotle is confident that once one has a proper\nunderstanding of how to explain natural phenomena in general, there is\nno reason to suppose that mental functions like perception, desire and\nat least some forms of thinking cannot be explained simply by\nappealing to the principles in terms of which natural phenomena in\ngeneral are properly understood and explained (cf. Frede 1992,\n97).\n\n It might be thought that since Aristotle's theory treats mental\nfunctions and other vital functions exactly alike, it obscures a\ncrucial distinction. This worry, however, turns out to be unjustified.\nThe theory treats mental and other vital functions alike only in that\nit views both kinds of functions as performed by natural organisms of\nthe right kind of structure and complexity. Viewing mental and other\nvital functions in this way is perfectly compatible with introducing a\ndistinction between mental and other functions if concerns of some\nkind or other call for such a distinction.  Aristotle is perfectly\ncapable, for instance, of setting aside non-mental vital functions as\nirrelevant for the purposes of practical philosophy\n (NE 1.13, 1102b11-12).\n5. Hellenistic Theories of Soul\n\n Coming from the theories of Plato and Aristotle, the first thing that\nmight strike us about the theories of soul adopted by the two dominant\nHellenistic schools, Epicurus' Garden and the Stoa, is the doctrine,\nshared by both, that the soul is corporeal. A number of Stoic\narguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down to us\n(see Annas 1992, 39-41). The best one of these is that the soul is a\nbody because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and soul and\nbody do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily damage and\nemotion. Epicurus employs the same argument in his Letter to\nHerodotus, which provides an outline of his physical doctrines\n(Long & Sedley 1987 [in what follows L&S] 14A7). In a way that\nreminds one of Presocratic theories, both Epicurus and the Stoics hold\nthat the soul is a particularly fine kind of body, diffused all the\nway through the perceptible (flesh-and-blood) body of the animate\norganism. As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias in the\nPhaedo presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks that the\nsoul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms, losing\nthe powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the\norganism that it ensouls (L&S 14A6). The Stoics agree that the\nhuman soul is mortal, but they also take it that it can and does\nsurvive the person's death \u2014 that is, its separation from the\nperceptible body. Chrysippus apparently thought that the souls of wise\npersons persist (as fine, imperceptible corporeal structures) all the\nway to the next conflagration in the cosmic cycle, whereas the souls\nof other people last for some time, and then get dispersed (Diogenes\nLaertius 7.157; cf. L&S 53W). Thus Chrysippus can accept, at least\nfor the souls of the wise, Socrates' claim in the Phaedo that\nthe soul is \u201caltogether indissoluble, or nearly so\u201d\n(Phaedo 80b), even though he plainly cannot accept all of\nSocrates' argument for this claim. \n5.1 Epicurus' Theory of Soul\n\n Epicurus is an atomist, and in accordance with his atomism he takes\nthe soul, like everything else that there is except for the void, to\nbe ultimately composed of atoms. Our sources are somewhat unclear as\nto exactly which kinds of materials he took to be involved in the\ncomposition of soul. It is very probable, though, that in addition to\nsome relatively familiar materials \u2014 such as fire-like and\nwind-like stuffs, or rather the atoms making up such stuffs \u2014\nthe soul, on Epicurus' view, also includes, in fact as a key\ningredient, atoms of a nameless kind of substance, which is\nresponsible for sense-perception. Thus it seems that while he thought\nhe could explain phenomena such as the heat or warmth of a living\norganism, as well as its movement and rest, by appealing to relatively\nfamiliar materials and their relatively familiar properties, he did\nfeel the need to introduce a mysterious additional kind of substance\nso as to be able to explain sense-perception, apparently on the\ngrounds that \u201csense-perception is found in none of the named\nelements\u201d (L&S 14C). It is worth noting that it is\nspecifically with regard to sense-perception that Epicurus thinks the\nintroduction of a further, nameless kind of substance is called for,\nrather than, for instance, with regard to intellectual cognition. What\nthis suggests, and what in fact we have independent reason to think,\nis that on Epicurus' view, once one is in a position adequately to\nexplain sense-perception, one will then also be in a position to work\nout an explanation of intellectual cognition, by appropriately\nextending the explanation of sense-perception. Let us consider briefly\nhow such extension might work. \n\n Perceptual beliefs, like the belief that \u2018there is a horse over\nthere\u2019, will be explained, in Epicurus' theory, in terms of\nsense-impressions and the application of concepts\n(\u2018preconceptions\u2019; for discussion cf.  Asmis 1999,\n276-83), and concept-formation is in turn explained in terms of\nsense-impression and memory. According to Diogenes Laertius' summary\n(L&S 17E1-2), the Epicureans say that \n\n preconception is, as it were, cognition or correct belief or\nconception or universal \u2018stored notion\u2019 (i.e. memory), of\nthat which has frequently become evident externally:\ne.g. \u2018such-and-such a kind of thing is a man\u2019. For as soon\nas the word \u2018man\u2019 is uttered, immediately its impression\nalso comes to mind by means of preconception, as a result of\nantecedent sense-perceptions. \n\n Moreover, sense-impressions, interpreted and articulated in terms of\nconcepts or preconceptions, yield experience concerning evident\nmatters, which in turn forms the basis for conclusions about\nnon-evident matters. For example, extensive experience can make clear\nto one not only that the human beings one has interacted with have a\ncertain feature (say, rationality), but also (later Epicureans will\nsay, probably somewhat developing Epicurus' position) that it is\ninconceivable that any human being could fail to have that feature\n(cf. L&S 18F4-5). And so, experience will not only make one\nexpect, with a very great deal of confidence, that any human being one\nwill ever encounter anywhere will be rational. Experience also,\naccording to the Epicureans, supports the inference to, and hence\njustifies one in accepting, the (non-evident) conclusion that all\nhuman beings, everywhere and at all times, are rational (for detailed\ndiscussion, cf. Allen 2001, 194-241). This obviously is an extremely\ngenerous view of what experience, and ultimately sense-perception, can\ndo! Once we recognize the enormously powerful and fundamental role\nEpicurus and his followers assign to sense-perception, we will not be\nsurprised to see that they feel the need to include in the composition\nof the soul a very special kind of material that accounts specifically\nfor sense-perception, but apparently do not think that, in addition to\nthat, some further special material is needed to enable intellectual\nor rational activity. \n\n In the Epicurean tradition the word \u2018soul\u2019 is sometimes\nused in the broad traditional way, as what animates living things\n(e.g., Diogenes of Oenoanda, fr. 37 Smith), but the focus of interest,\nso far as the soul is concerned, is very much on the mental functions\nof cognition, emotion and desire. A view that is common in the\ntradition and that very probably goes back to the founder is that the\nsoul is a composite of two parts, one rational, the other\nnonrational. The rational part, which Lucretius calls mind\n[animus], is the origin of emotion and impulse, and it is also\nwhere (no doubt among other operations) concepts are applied and\nbeliefs formed, and where evidence is assessed and inferences are\nmade. The nonrational part of the soul, which in Lucretius is somewhat\nconfusingly called soul [anima], is responsible for receiving\nsense-impressions, all of which are true according to Epicurus. Error\narises at a later stage, when sense-impressions are interpreted by the\nrational part of the soul, in a way that, as we have seen, crucially\ninvolves memory. Sense-perception, conceived of simply as the\nreception of sense-impressions by the nonrational soul, does not\ninvolve memory (cf. L&S 16B1). Since the formation and application\nof concepts requires memory, sense-perception, so conceived of, does\nnot involve conceptualization, either. The nonrational part is also\nresponsible for transmitting impulses originating from the rational\npart, as well as (presumably) for a wide variety of other vital\nfunctions. (When Epicurus distinguishes between pleasures and pains of\nthe soul and those of the body, incidentally, the distinction he has\nin mind must be between the rational part of the soul on the one hand\nand the body animated by nonrational soul, on the other.) \n5.2 The Stoic Theory of Soul\n\n Stoic physics allows for three different kinds of pneuma (lit.\n\u2018breath\u2019), a breath-like material compound of two of the\nfour Stoic elements, fire and air. The kinds of pneuma differ\nboth in degree of tension that results from the expanding and\ncontracting effects, respectively, of its two constituents, and in\ntheir consequent functionality. The lowest kind accounts for the\ncohesion and character of inanimate bodies (e.g., rocks); the\nintermediate kind, called natural pneuma, accounts for the\nvital functions characteristic of plant life; and the third kind is\nsoul, which accounts for the reception and use of impressions (or\nrepresentations) (phantasiai) and impulse (horm\u00ea:\nthat which generates animal movement) or, to use alternative\nterminology, cognition and desire. Our evidence, which unfortunately\nis fragmentary and often unclear, suggests strongly that according to\nthe Stoic theory, the body of an animal (human or non-human) contains\npneuma of all the three kinds, with the lowest kind responsible\nfor the cohesion and character of parts like teeth and bones, natural\npneuma in charge of metabolism, growth and the like, and\nfinally soul accounting for distinctively mental or psychological\nfunctions, crucially cognition, by sense and (in the case of humans)\nintellect, and desire (cf. Long 1999, 564, for discussion and\nreferences). If this is indeed the picture that the theory presents,\nthe soul is no longer responsible for all vital functions, and for all\naspects of life, but only for specifically mental or psychological\nfunctions. (Accordingly, the Stoics depart from the Platonic and\nAristotelian view that plants are ensouled organisms.) At the same\ntime, the Stoic theory does attempt to explain non-mental vital\nfunctions as well, in terms of the activity of \u2018nature\u2019,\nthe intermediate kind of pneuma.  In severing the deeply\nentrenched, Greek ordinary-language connection between soul and life\nin all its forms, the Stoic theory is taking an enormously momentous\nstep, one that obviously restricts rather dramatically the proper\nsubject matter of a theory of soul. In fact it is arguable that the\nStoics, in limiting the functions of soul in the way they did, played\nan important role in a complicated history that resulted in the\nCartesian conception of mind, according to which the mind plainly is\nnot something that animates living bodies. This narrowing of the\nconception of soul is one of two aspects of the Stoic theory that, for\nour purposes, deserve particular notice. \n\n The second noteworthy aspect is the insistence of the Stoic theory\nthat the mind of an adult human being is a single, partless item that\nis rational all the way down. According to the Stoic theory, there are\neight parts of the soul, the \u2018commanding faculty\u2019\n[h\u00eagemonikon] or mind, the five senses, voice and\n(certain aspects of) reproduction. The mind, which is located at the\nheart, is a center that controls the other soul-parts as well as the\nbody, and that receives and processes information supplied by the\nsubordinate parts. The minds of non-human animals and of non-adult\nhumans have faculties only of impression and impulse.  Achieving\nadulthood, for humans, involves gaining assent and reason.  Reason (it\nwould seem) makes assent possible, in that it enables the subject to\nassent to or withhold assent from impressions, and it transforms mere\nimpressions and mere impulses, such as other animals experience, into\nrational impressions and rational impulses. The rationality of an\nimpression (for example, of a tree one sees before oneself) consists\nin its being articulated in terms of concepts, possession of which is\nconstitutive of having reason; the rationality of an impulse consists\nin the fact that it is generated or constituted by a voluntary act of\nassent of the mind to a suitable practical (\u2018impulsive\u2019)\nimpression \u2014 the impression, for instance, that something within\nview would be nice to eat.  Thus, depending on the type of impression\nassented to, assent generates or constitutes belief (or knowledge)\nconcerning some matter of fact, or an impulse to act in some way or\nother.\n\n It is crucially important not to misunderstand these various\nfaculties as parts or aspects of the mind, items that operate with\nsome degree of autonomy from one another and can therefore\nconflict. On the Stoic theory, the faculties of the mind are simply\nthings the mind can do.  Moreover, it is a central part of the theory\nthat, in the case of an adult human being, there is no such thing as\nan impulse without an act of assent of the mind to a corresponding\npractical impression. In a rational subject, the faculty of impulse\ndepends on the faculty of assent, which, like all faculties of such a\nsubject, is a rational faculty. This theory leaves no room for the\nPlatonic conception that the souls of adult human beings contain\nnon-rational parts which can, and frequently do, generate impulse and\nbehavior independently of, and even contrary to, the designs and\npurposes of reason. Nor, relatedly, does it leave room for the shared\nPlatonic and Aristotelian view that desire, even in the case of adult\nhumans, comes in three forms, two of which are such that desires of\nthese forms do not arise from, or depend on, activities of reason.\nThe Stoic theory has the attractive consequence that each adult person\nis, through their own reasoned assent, unambiguously and equally\nresponsible for all their voluntary behavior: there are no Platonic\nnonrational parts, or Platonic-Aristotelian nonrational desires, that\ncould produce actions against one's own reason's helpless\nprotestations. However, the theory needed to be defended both against\nrival philosophical theories and against pre-theoretical intuitions\nthat militate in favor of these theories. One such intuition is that\npassion can, and frequently does, conflict with reason. To judge from\na report by Plutarch, it appears that the Stoics were able to explain\naway this particular intuition, and also to disarm the argument for\ntripartition of the soul in Republic 4, which depends on the\nsimultaneity of a desire for and an aversion to one and the\nsame thing. According to Plutarch (L&S 65G1),\n\n Some people [the Stoics] say that passion is no different from\nreason, and that there is no dissension and conflict between the two,\nbut a turning of the single reason in both directions, which we do not\nnotice owing to the sharpness and speed of the change.\n\n Introducing the idea of unnoticed oscillation of a single, partless\nmind is highly ingenious and must have been dialectically effective at\nleast to some extent. However, the theory of the soul that we find in\nclassical Stoicism appears to be committed to the view that in the\ncase of adult humans, there simply are no motivational factors that do\nnot depend on reason and that can significantly affect, often for the\nworse, how a person behaves and how their life goes. It must have been\ndifficult to defend this view against the Platonic-Aristotelian\nposition. And so it is not surprising that in an environment in which\ninterest in Plato's and Aristotle's writings was on the rise again, at\nleast one prominent Stoic philosopher, Posidonius (first century\nB.C.), apparently gave up at least part of the classical Stoic\ntheory. The evidence that we have is not easy to interpret, but it\nvery much appears that Posidonius introduced into a basically Stoic\npsychological framework the idea that even the minds of adult humans\ninclude, to put things cautiously, motivationally relevant forces (of\ntwo kinds) that do not depend on assent or reason at all and that are\nnot fully subject to rational control.  (For detailed discussion,\ncf. Cooper 1998, 77-111.)\n6. Conclusion\n\n Ancient philosophy did not, of course, end with classical Stoicism,\nor indeed with the Hellenistic period, and neither did ancient\ntheorizing about the soul. The revival of interest in the works of\nboth Plato and Aristotle beginning in the second half of the second\ncentury B.C.  prominently included renewed interest in Platonic and\nAristotelian conceptions of the soul, sparking novel theoretical\ndevelopments, such as, for instance, Plotinus' argument (directed in\nparticular against the Stoics) that the soul could not be spatially\nextended, since no spatially extended item could account for the unity\nof the subject of sense-perception (see Emilsson 1991).  Christian\nwriters such as Clement of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa were\nheavily indebted to philosophical theories of soul, especially\nPlatonic ones, but also introduced new concerns and interests of their\nown. Nevertheless, these and other post-classical developments in\nevery case need to be interpreted within the framework and context\nfurnished by the classical theories that we have been considering in\nsome detail.\n",
