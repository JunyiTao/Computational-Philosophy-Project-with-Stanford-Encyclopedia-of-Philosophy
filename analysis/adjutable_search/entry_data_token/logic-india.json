Reasoning and Logic\n\nHumans reason: that is, taking some things to be true, they conclude\ntherefrom that other things are also true. If this is done in thought,\none performs an inference; and if this is done in speech, one makes an\nargument. Indeed, inference and argument are but two sides of the same\ncoin: an argument can be thought, and hence become an inference; an\ninference can be expressed, and hence become an argument.\n\nLogic, at least as traditionally conceived, seeks to distinguish good\nreasoning from bad. More particularly, it seeks to identify the\ngeneral conditions under which what one concludes is true, having\ntaken other things to be true. These conditions can be sought in the\nnature of things. One asks, then, under what conditions do certain\nfacts require some other fact. This perspective on reasoning is an\nontic perspective. Next, insofar as facts are grasped in thought, one\ncan also ask under what conditions does knowledge of some facts permit\nknowledge of another fact. Such conditions, once identified, would\ndistinguish good inferences from bad inferences. This perspective on\nreasoning is an epistemic one. A third perspective is a dialectic one.\nHere one asks under what conditions does the acceptance by someone of\nsome stated facts require him or her to accept some other stated fact.\nSuch conditions distinguish good arguments from bad arguments.\nFinally, since an argument is an expression of an inference, and to\nthat extent, expressed in a language, it is natural to use the forms\nof linguistic expressions to identify forms of inferences and\narguments, thereby distinguishing forms of good inferences and\narguments from forms of bad inferences and arguments. This perspective\nis a linguistic one. The study of reasoning in India has been from the\nontic, epistemic and dialectic perspective, and not from the\nlinguistic perspective, the perspective best known to modern\nthinkers.\n2. Preclassical Period\n\nThe fact that humans reason is no guarantee that those who do reflect\non which reasoning is good and which is bad. Clearly, the activity of\nreasoning, on the one hand, and the activity of reflecting on which\nreasoning is good and which is not, on the other, are distinct, though\nnaturally they are intimately related. The exposition here, while\nreporting primarily on what is explicit, will also report on what is\nimplicit. In looking at the origins of reasoning in India, it is\nnatural to begin with the practices in which reasoning played a role\nand which, as a result, were likely candidates for reflection. The\nobvious starting points for such practices are all forms of rational\ninquiry.\n\nRational inquiry comprises the search for reasons for publicly\naccepted facts, subject to public and rational scrutiny. This activity\ninvolves people both severally and collectively. It involves people\nseverally insofar as people, individually, are the locus of inference.\nIt involves people collectively insofar as arguments, the public\nmanifestation of inferences, are sharpened by the scrutiny of\nothers.\n\nThough the origins in India of public debate, one form of rational\ninquiry, are not clear, we know that public verbal exchanges were\ncommon in preclassical India, starting around the fifth century bce,\nfor they are occasionally alluded to in various\nUpani\u1e63ads and frequently described at some length in\nthe Buddhist canon. As pointed out by Todeschini (2011, 92), these\nexchanges are not debates in the usual sense of the word, for they\ninclude everything from verbal instruction in the ideas of the Buddha\nto verbal sparring. The instruction may take the form of question and\nanswer, where the respondent is judged by how well he, or she,\nexpresses himself, or herself. An assessment depends on how persuasive\nthe answer is or how authoritative it sounds. Simile and analogy loom\nlarge. Rare are what we would call arguments. More than half of the\nsuttas of the D\u0131\u0304gha Nik\u0101ya contain such\nexchanges. These exchanges typically have the following features: a\ncentral character, typically the Buddha, a statement of his or her\ncredentials, an adversary, a statement of his or her credentials, a\ndescription of the location and audience, a greeting ceremony, a\nchallenge, a refutation of the adversary\u2019s position, the\nestablishment of the Buddhist position, a hypothetical case history, a\nsurrender and a reward (Mann\u00e9, 1992, 117). These exchanges\ncontain much, sometimes nearly the only surviving, information on the\nparticipants and the sects to which they belonged. (See Mann\u00e9,\n1992; von Hin\u00fcber, 1996, II.2.1; Solomon, 1976, 30\u201334;\nWatanabe, 1983; Todeschini, 2011, 79\u201389 for details.)\n\nPublic verbal exchanges also include public assemblies\n(pari\u1e63ad or sabh\u0101) of various sorts,\ncomprising relevant experts, convened to deliberate on a variety of\nmatters, including administrative, legal and religious matters. As\nreported by Solomon (1976, ch. 3), much of the legal vocabulary for\nsuch deliberations includes the well-known terms of debate and\nargument found in the philosophical literature (see also Preisendanz\n2009, 2010).\n\nAlso during this period, rational inquiry into a wide range of topics\nwas under way, including agriculture, architecture, astronomy,\ngrammar, law, logic, mathematics, medicine, phonology and statecraft.\nAside from the world\u2019s earliest extant grammar,\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, however, no works\ndevoted to these topics actually date from this preclassical period.\nNonetheless, scholars agree that incipient versions of the first\nextant texts on these topics were being formulated and early versions\nof them were redacted by the beginning of the common era. They include\nsuch texts as K\u1e5b\u1e63i-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise\non agriculture), \u015ailpa-\u015b\u0101stra\n(Treatise on architecture),\nJyoti\u1e63a-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on\nastronomy), Dharma-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on\nlaw), Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 (Caraka\u2019s\ncollection), a treatise on medicine, and\nArtha-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise on wealth), a\ntreatise on politics.\n\nThree late canonical Buddhist texts are especially noteworthy for the\nstudy of the history of reasoning in India. They are\nKath\u0101-vatthu (Points of controversy), attributed to\nMoggaliputta Tissa, Yamaka (Couplets) and\nMilinda-pa\u00f1ha (Questions of King Milinda).\nWhile all three are from the Therav\u0101da (or Sthavirav\u0101da)\ntradition, only the first two are canonical texts of the tradition,\nboth found in the Abhidhamma canon. The three date from around the\nthird century bce.\n2.1 Yamaka\n\nThe Yamaka (Couplets) is the sixth of the seven\nworks comprising the Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma. Were it printed in its\nentirety, it would be run to some 2,500 pages, according to von\nHin\u00fcber (1996, II.3.6). The printed editions are therefore highly\nabridged.\n\nThe Yamaka comprises ten chapters, most with up to three\nsections. Each chapter asks for various pairs, or yamakas, of\nterms falling under the chapter\u2019s rubric whether or not the\ncorresponding universal categorical proposition holds. Here is chapter\n2, section 1, in schematic form:\n\n\n\n1.1 Are all M MA?\n5.1 Are all -M -MA? \n\n1.2 Are all MA M?\n5.2 Are all -MA -M? \n\n2.1 Are all M MA?\n6.1 Are all -M -MA? \n\n2.2 Are all A SA?\n6.2 Are all -SA -A? \n\n3.1 Are all M A?\n7.1 Are all -M -A? \n\n3.2 Are all A M?\n7.2 Are all -A -MA? \n\n4.1 Are all M A?\n8.1 Are all -M -A? \n\n4.2 Are all A SA?\n8.2 Are all -A -SA?  \n\n\nwhere M is matter, A is aggregate, MA is matter-aggregate and SA\nsensation aggregate. We note the repetition in 1.1 and 2.1, 3.1 and\n4.1, 2.2 and 4.2, 5.1 and 6.2, 7.1 and 8.1 as well as in 6.2 and 8.2.\nWe also notice that 1.1 and 5.2 are contrapositives, as are 1.2 and\n5.1. Though the text contains no arguments, the fact that the same\nform of question is reinstantiated again and again reveals an\nawareness of the importance of linguistic form, an essential aspect of\nreasoning. However, while the systematicity of the text is evident,\nits logical point definitely is not.\n2.2 Kath\u0101-vatthu\n\nThe Kath\u0101-vatthu (Points of controversy) is the\nfifth of the seven canonical Abhidhamma works in the Therav\u0101da\ntradition. Unlike the Yamaka, the Kath\u0101-vatthu\nconsists of arguments. The arguments are designed to show the\ninconsistency of some two hundred propositions which are at odds with\nthe views of the Therav\u0101dins. The kind of arguments found in the\ntext is well exemplified in the following often cited passage, where\nthe Therav\u0101din questions his opponent, here a Pudgalav\u0101din,\nabout whether or not the soul is known truly and ultimately.\n\n\n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs the soul known truly and ultimately? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nYes. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs the soul known truly and ultimately just like any ultimate\nfact? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nNo. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nAcknowledge your refutation, \n\n\u00a0\nIf the soul is known truly and ultimately, then indeed, good\nsir, you should also say that the soul is known truly and ultimately\njust like any ultimate fact. \n\n\u00a0\nWhat you say here is wrong: namely, that we ought to say (a)\nthat the soul is known truly and ultimately; but we ought not to say\n(b) that the soul is known truly and ultimately just like any ultimate\nfact. \n\n\u00a0\nIf the latter statement (b) cannot be admitted, then indeed the\nformer statement (a) should not be admitted. \n\n\u00a0\nIt is wrong to affirm the former statement (a) and to deny the\nlatter (b).  \n\n\nOne easily abstracts from this the following form,\n\n\n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs A B? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nYes. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs C D? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nNo. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nAcknowledge your refutation, \n\n\u00a0\nIf A is B, then C is D. \n\n\u00a0\nWhat you say here is wrong: namely, that \n\n\u00a0\nA is B but that C is not D. \n\n\u00a0\nIf C is not D, then A is not B. \n\n\u00a0\nIt is wrong that A is B and C is not D.  \n\n\nIndeed, this form is repeatedly instantiated throughout Book 1,\nChapter 1.\n\nThree features of this text are important to note from the point of\nview of the history of logic. First, as the schema above shows,\narguments are put into a canonical form. While we have no record that\nsemantic ascent had taken place, there is no doubt from the arguments\nare intended to satisfy a certain form. Second, the sentences of the\nargument are logically related. The author takes for granted that the\nsentences assented to are inconsistent, corresponding to an instance\nof the following inconsistent propositional schemata of \\(\\alpha\\),\n\\(\\neg \\beta\\), \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\). He also takes it for\ngranted that it is wrong to hold inconsistent propositions. And he\nfinally presupposes that, if a sentence corresponding to propositional\nschema \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\) is true, then the sentence\ncorresponding to the propositional schema \\(\\neg \\beta \\rightarrow\n\\neg \\alpha\\) is also true; that is, he presupposes the natural\nlanguage counterpart to one direction of the equivalence of a\nconditional and its contrapositive. (See Ganeri 2001 for the most\nrecent attempt to explicate the dialectic implicit in the text.)\n2.3 Milinda-pa\u00f1ha\n\nMilinda-pa\u00f1ha (Questions of King Milinda),\nunlike the Kath\u0101-vatthu which comprises an argumentative\nexchange adhering to identifiable patterns, comprises a dialogue\nbetween the Greek Bactrian king, Menander (P\u0101li: Milinda), and an\notherwise unknown Buddhist monk, N\u0101gasena (von Hin\u00fcber,\n1996, III.4). The text is an exposition of Buddhist doctrine and\npractice, cast in terms of questions put by King Milinda to the monk\nN\u0101gasena and the latter\u2019s answers. Though there is some\nargumentation, for the most part, the text is expository, where the\nexposition is done almost entirely through analogy, sometimes very\nelaborate ones. For example, Book 5, entitled \u2018the problem of\ninference\u2019, which has almost nothing to do with inference, sets\nout an elaborate analogy between a great city and its various parts,\non the one hand, and the Buddha\u2019s teaching and its various\nparts, on the other. The pretext for this expository analogy is an\nargument put to N\u0101gasena by King Milinda. King Milinda asks\nwhether N\u0101gasena or his teachers has seen the Buddha.\nN\u0101gasena replies that neither he nor his teachers has. King\nMilinda concludes, then, that the Buddha did not exist. N\u0101gasena\nreplies by making a similar argument whose premiss King Milinda\naccepts but whose conclusion he rejects. King Milinda admits that\nneither he nor those who have taught him has seen the founders of his\nkingly lineage, yet he believes that the founder of his lineage\nexisted. (Bk. 5, sec. 2) Then King Milinda replies that he has\nevidence for belief in the existence of a founder, the existence of\nthe royal insignia. N\u0101gasena then counters that he too has\nevidence for the existence of the Buddha, namely, his various\ndoctrines, metaphorically the royal insignia of the Buddha. (Bk. 5,\nsec. 3) In short, just as one infers the existence of a founder of a\nlineage from the legacy of his royal insignia, so one infers the\nexistence of the Buddha from the legacy of his teachings.\nN\u0101gasena then turns to a similar argument which serves as a\npretext to elaborate various aspects of the Buddha\u2019s teaching:\njust as one can infer from a well planned city the fact that it had a\ndesigner, so one can infer from the well ordered doctrines of the\nBuddha that the Buddha existed. Over the ensuing 20 sections,\nN\u0101gasena first enumerates various features of the city and then\nelaborates on aspects of Buddhist doctrines put in correspondence with\nthem. The final section ends with eight arguments, each paired through\nanalogy with an argument pertaining to features of Buddhist thought\nand the existence or features of the Buddha. (1) From the greatness of\nthe city one infers the greatness of the architect. (2) From the\ngreatness of the waves, one infers the greatness of the ocean; (3)\nFrom seeing the peaks of mountains from afar, one infers the height of\nthe mountains; (4) From the greatness of an elephant\u2019s\nfootprint, one infers the size of the elephant; (5) From seeing\ncreatures crouching in fear, one infers that a lion has roared; (6)\nFrom the luxuriance of the vegetation, one infers the ampleness of\nrainfall; (7) From the marshiness of the earth, one infers the excess\nof rainfall; (8) From the scent in the air, one infers that flowers\nare in bloom. Each of these arguments has the form of what is dubbed\nto be the pram\u0101\u1e47a, the means of epistemic\ncognition, known as anum\u0101na, or inference.\n\nOne important principle of logic is presupposed in the dialogue: the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. It is presupposed in a variety of\nplaces throughout the text, but it is particularly in evidence in Book\n4, which is entitled \u2018Solving the dilemmas\u2019. The book\nconsists of dilemmas put to N\u0101gasena by King Milinda. Many of\nthem are pairs of apparently inconsistent statements or practices\ninconsistent with doctrine. They correspond to the following schema in\npropositional logic: \\(p \\land q,\\) \\(p \\to \\neg q,\\) \\(q \\to \\neg\np.\\) One particularly clear instance occurs in section 6 of Chapter 2.\nThere King Milinda says:\n\n\nIf the Blessed one, N\u0101gasena, really said that all men tremble at\npunishment and all are afraid of death, then the statement that the\nArhat has passed beyond fear must be false. But if that last statement\nis really by him, then the other must be false. (T. W. Rhys Davids\n1980.)\n\n\nN\u0101gasena\u2019s response is to point out, in effect, that the\nintended meaning is different from the literal meaning. He gives\nseveral examples of sentences in which the word all occurs but where\nall in not intended to include everyone in what we today call the\ndomain of discourse. He points out (in section 8) that a king might\ntell his four ministers that all must pay taxes, but the king does not\nintend that the ministers are included by all, ministers being free\nfrom the burden of taxation. In another example (section 9), he points\nout that a village headman may tell the village crier to bring\ntogether all the villagers, but in fact, what he intends is that only\nall the heads of households gather.\n3. Classical Period\n\nThe first five hundred years of the common era also saw the redaction\nof philosophical treatises in which proponents of diverse\nphilosophical and religious traditions put forth systematic versions\nof their world views. These latter works bear witness, in a number of\ndifferent ways, to the intense interest in argumentation during this\nperiod. Among the diverse forms of argument from this period, one\nemerges as a canonical one. In this section, we first review the texts\nrelevant to the development of logic from the end this preclassical\nperiod. We then turn our attention to surveying the emergence of a\ncanonical argument form. Finally, we conclude with a very brief\noverview of the treatment of fallacies in arguments and of missteps in\ndebate.\n3.1 Texts of the early classical period\n\nThe texts relevant to the study of the development of logic during\nthis period may be divided into three kinds: those which have\narguments but which do not mention or discuss either argument or\ninference as such, those which mention or discuss inference as such\nbut do not mention or discuss arguments as such, and those which\nmention or discuss arguments and possibly also mention or discuss\ninference, and may even provide illustrations of either.\n3.1.1 Texts with arguments\n\nDuring this period polemical texts, which consist almost entirely of\narguments, start to appear. The earliest among these are texts\nattributed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (2nd century ce),\namong which are the\nM\u016bla-madhyama-kak\u0101rik\u0101 (Basic verses on\nthe middle way), the Vigrahavy\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304\n(Exclusion of disputes) and the\nVaidalya-prakara\u1e47a (Tract on pulverization).\nShortly thereafter came a text by \u0100ryadeva (c. 3rd century ce),\nsaid to be a student of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna,\nentitled \u015aataka-\u015b\u0101stra (Treatise in one\nhundred verses), now extant only in its Chinese translation,\nB\u01cei l\u00f9n (\u767e\u8ad6). Of these texts, only\nthe Vaidalya-prakara\u1e47a is a prose text. While the\nothers are in verse, the Vigraha-vy\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304\nand the \u015aataka-\u015b\u0101stra, unlike the\nM\u016bla-madhyama-kak\u0101rik\u0101, are accompanied by the\nauthor\u2019s own commentary. Of the latter two, only the\nVigraha-y\u0101vartan\u0131\u0304 survives in its Sanskrit\noriginal. That the text has a commentary by its author and that both\nthe text and the commentary have survived in the original Sanskrit\noriginal make it the text which best reveals the reasoning of the\nperiod.\n\nThe text comprises seventy verses, each supplemented with the\nauthor\u2019s own commentary. The central question addressed is the\nclaim that nothing has a nature. The first twenty verses present four\narguments supporting the claim followed by six arguments against it.\nThe following fifty verses elaborate on the arguments and objections\nin the first twenty. The argumentation in the text is complex, using a\nnumber of different forms of argument and invoking or presupposing\nseveral principles of reasoning. To appreciate the kind of reasoning\nfound in this and the other texts mentioned above, we shall consider\nbriefly some of the arguments found in verses 31\u201350 and in their\naccompanying commentary.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s aim in the verses 31\u201350 is to show\nthat any argument to establish that there are\npram\u0101\u1e47as, means of epistemic cognition, ultimately\nleads to contradiction. He considers two cases: the case where it is\nmaintained that pram\u0101\u1e47as are established by other\npram\u0101\u1e47as and the case where each\npram\u0101\u1e47a establishes itself. The first case is\naddressed in verse 31 and its accompanying commentary, where\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that, if to establish a\npram\u0101\u1e47a other pram\u0101\u1e47as are\nrequired, then there results an endless (an-avasth\u0101 :\nliterally, foundationless) chain of such pram\u0101\u1e47as, in other\nwords, an infinite regress, which is taken to be an impossibility. The\nsecond case spans the remaining verses (33\u201350) and has two\nparts. In the first part (vv. 33\u201339), the proponent of the\nexistence of pram\u0101\u1e47as is challenged to justify\nwhy, of all the things whose existence is established by\npram\u0101\u1e47as, pram\u0101\u1e47as alone have\nthe peculiarity of not being established by (other)\npram\u0101\u1e47as. The opponent\u2019s answer is to\nmaintain that pram\u0101\u1e47as are not alone; light too,\nthe opponent claims, has the property of revealing the existence both\nof other things and itself. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna then puts forth four\narguments to show either that light does not reveal itself or that it\ndoes not reveal anything. In the second part (vv. 40\u201348),\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna maintains that a pram\u0101\u1e47a and\nits prameya, the object revealed by the\npram\u0101\u1e47a, are indistinguishable, which he seems to\nthink is absurd. He goes on to bolster this argument with what he\ntakes to be, and what he says is, another argument of the very same\nform, and which concludes father and his son, by dint of their\nrelation, are indistinguishable (vv. 49\u201350).\n\nWith the argumentative structure of the passage in mind, let us\nconsider three arguments in it which can be understood without\nelaboration. In verse 34, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says:\n\n\nFor fire does not illuminate itself. Just as a pot in the dark, not\nyet illuminated by fire, is not apprehended, and then at the very next\nmoment, illuminated by fire, is apprehended as existent, in the very\nsame way, if a fire were in the dark, not yet illuminated [and] at a\nlater time there were be [its] illumination by fire, then it would\nilluminate its existence. Yet that is not so.\n\n\nThe point is that, while the opponent holds that a\npram\u0101\u1e47a is self revealing, fire is not. When fire\nilluminates something, the thing the fire illuminates already exists\nin the dark before the fire\u2019s light reveals it; but a fire does\nnot exist in the dark before the fire\u2019s light reveals it. In\nthis way, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has shown that the opponent has failed\nto show that there is anything other than pram\u0101\u1e47as\nwhich are self revealing and that therefore the\npram\u0101\u1e47as remain exceptional.\n\nThis argument has, even to modern eyes, prima facie merit.\nHowever, the next two arguments do not. The argument in verse 35 is\nrestated in the\n\ncommentary as follows:\n\n\nAnd if, according to what you say, a fire illuminates its own\nexistence in the very same way as it illuminates the existence of\nother things too, will it not burn itself in the very same way as it\nburns other things too?\n\n\nThe argument is this: Fire illuminates other things and itself. Fire\nburns other things. Therefore fire burns itself. But fire does not\nburn itself. Therefore fire does not illuminate itself. The argument\nis framed as an argument by reductio ad impossibile with an\nargument by analogy within. As it happens, this argument by analogy is\neasily recast in the form of an analogical argument through\nsimilarity, one of two forms of argument treated as canonical in other\ntexts and to be discussed below. We can see that the argument here has\nno deductive cogency, if we render the argument as deductive by\nsupplying the following premiss: if fire bears one relationship to\nother things and to itself, then any other relationship it bears to\nother things it bears to itself.\n\nAn equally unconvincing argument is given in the next verse (36).\n\n\nAnd if, according to your thinking, fire illuminates its existence and\nthat of other things, would not darkness, being the opposite of fire,\nalso hide its existence and that of other things? Yet that is not\nobserved. In that case, your statement that fire illuminates its own\nexistence and that of other things is not true.\n\n\nThe argument here is also framed as an argument by reductio ad\nimpossibile with an argument by analogy within. As it happens,\nthis argument by analogy is easily recast in the form of an analogical\nargument through dissimilarity, the other of two forms of argument\ntreated as canonical in other texts and to be discussed below.\n3.1.2 Texts discussing inference\n\nWe know of four texts from this period which identify inference\n(anum\u0101na), as distinguished from argument\n(s\u0101dhana), as a means of epistemic cognition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a). They are the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on\nindividuation), a treatise of speculative ontology attributed to\nKa\u1e47\u0101da (c. 1st century ce), the\nSpitzer manuscript, a collection of fragments of a Sanskrit text (c.\n3rd century ce) of unknown authorship (Franco,\n2004, v. 1, 32\u201333), Sa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra\n(Aphorisms on release from bondage), an early Mah\u0101yana\ntext (between the 3rd and 5th centuries ce),\nalso of unknown authorship, and the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra (Sixty doctrines), a\nS\u0101\u1e43khya text attributed V\u0101r\u1e63aga\u1e47ya (4th\ncentury ce).\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra has passages which allude\nto inferences whereby one unobserved thing is inferred on the basis of\nsomething observed which bears one of five relations to the thing\ninferred (VS 9.18; Jambuvijaya (ed), 1961, 69; cp. VS 3.1.8). However,\nno examples are given. In contrast, six examples of inference are\nfound in the Spitzer manuscript among the surviving fragments\nreferring to the four means of epistemic cognition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47as) of perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na), analogy\n(aupamya) and tradition (aitihya) (Franco, 2003,\n126), though these inferences require piecing together (Franco, 2003,\n126\u2013136). A passage which also refers to the same\npram\u0101\u1e47as but with different words\n\nis found in the tenth and last chapter of the\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra, an early Mah\u0101yana\nBuddhist text, of unknown authorship, which survives only in a Tibetan\nand Chinese translation. The passage in question has also been\ntranslated into English and critically discussed by Yoshimizu (2010,\n142\u2013148). (See also Powers (trans.), 1991, 321ff.)\n\nFinally, there is the \u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra, which\nalso survives only in fragments, first collected by Frauwallner\n(1958), later expanded by Steinkellner (2017, Appendix 1). It defines\ninference (anum\u0101na) as follows: To infer is to establish\nsomething in the remainder, on the basis of a relation and something\nperceptible. One of the text\u2019s fragments lists six relations as\nones which underpin an acceptable inference. They are: the master\nservant relation (sva-sv\u0101mi-bh\u0101va-sa\u1e43bandha),\nthe matter alteration relation\n(prak\u1e5bti-vik\u0101ra-sa\u1e43bandha), the part whole\nrelation (k\u0101rya-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-sa\u1e43bandha), the\ncause effect relation (nimitta-naimittika-sa\u1e43bandha),\nthe source product relation\n(m\u0101tr\u0101-m\u0101trika-sa\u1e43bandha), the\nassociation relation (sahac\u0101ri-sa\u1e43bandha) and the\nincompatibility relation\n(vadhya-gh\u0101taka-sa\u1e43bandha). Though each of the\nrelations is illustrated, no example of an inference using them is\nfound among the known fragments.\n\nWhat emerges from the passages of the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra and the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra and what is consistent with\nthose in the Spitzer manuscript and\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra is that inferences have the\nfollowing form:\n\ninferential syllogism\n\n\n\nproposition:\np has S \n\nreason:\nbecause p has H. \n\nrelation:\nA relation which possessors of H bear to possessors of S.\n \n\n\n3.1.3 Texts discussing argument\n\nInterest in the nature of argument itself appears also at this time.\nThe best known text from this period is the Brahmanical treatise\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on logic) by\nGautama, also known as Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da (c. 2nd ce),\nthe actual redaction of which is thought by\nsome to date to the third century ce. This\nconcerns topics primarily pertaining to epistemology and debate.\nThough a few aphorisms found in the first chapter of the first and\nsecond books speak of inference, much more attention is devoted to\ndebate, essentially all of both chapters of Book 5, the entirety of\nthe second chapter of Book 1, and several aphorisms in the first\nchapter of Book 1. Unfortunately, the text\u2019s aphorisms\n(s\u016btras) are often not much more than lists of terms.\nWith little discussion and few examples, it is hard to get a clear\nidea of what the key terms mean.\n\nSome light is shed on this work by a contemporaneous Buddhist work,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Vaidalya-prakara\u1e47a, mentioned\nabove. It is organized around the key terms listed in the first\naphorism of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.1.1). However, it\ndoes not explain the terms nor does it illustrate them. Instead, it\nsets out for each term arguments intended to show its incoherence. It\nis therefore rich in arguments, most of which are analogical. The\nauthor also judges a number of counter arguments as fallacious,\npointing out either that they are circular or that they lead to an\ninfinite regress.\n\nLess laconic passages pertaining to some of the same topics are found\nin the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101, Classical India\u2019s\nearliest medical text, conjectured by some to have been redacted in\nits current form at the beginning of first century ce.\nThe text has three relevant passages: a short\none concerned with inference (CS 1.11.21\u201322), a longer one\nconcerned with pram\u0101\u1e47as (CS 3.4.1\u201314 ) and a\nstill longer one concerned with argument (CS 3.8.16\u201367).\n\nNot all Buddhist texts from this period are hostile to argumentation.\nTwo works contain short passages with lists and classificatory\ndefinitions of terms pertaining to debate. One is the\nSa\u1e43dhi-nirmocana-s\u016btra (Aphorisms on release\nfrom bondage), mentioned above. Another is the\nAbhidharma-samuccaya (Compendium of the higher\nteachings), a text usually attributed to the Buddhist thinker,\nAsa\u1e45ga (5th century ce), whose fifth\nchapter has a section, its seventh, often referred to as\nV\u0101da-vini\u015bcaya (Settling on what debate\nis), also devoted to debate.\n\nIn contrast to the passages in the two texts just mentioned, which\nlist, and even sometimes gloss, terms ive other texts from this period\nnot only mention and sometimes discuss, terms pertinent to inference\nand debate the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra\n(Treatise on the stages of the practice of yoga), a work\ntraditionally attributed to Asa\u1e45ga, but now generally thought to\nbe by a number of authors, has a passage, usually referred to as\nHetu-vidy\u0101 (Science of reasons), which provides\nsome fifty examples of simple common sense inferences, all of which\nare easily recast in the form of the inferential syllogism given\nabove. The inferences are divided into five categories. While relation\nwords are used for each category, the logical force of these relations\nis not made clear. The inferences provided include ones such as the\ninference of fire from smoke, of the presence of a lion from its roar,\nof being sick from unusual eating practices, as well as inferences\nmore closely connected with Buddhist doctrine.\n\nThere are two other works which have passages pertinent to the study\nof the history of reasoning in India, both works attributed to\nAsa\u1e45ga. The first is the Xi\u01cen y\u00e1ng sh\u00e8ng\nji\u00e0o l\u00f9n\n(\u986f\u63da\u8056\u6559\u8ad6), or Treatise which\nreveals and disseminates the wise teachings, which is a condensed\nversion of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-bh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra, and the\nSh\u00f9n zh\u014dng l\u00f9n (\u9806\u4e2d\u8ad6),\nor Treatise on following the middle way, which seems to be a\ncommentary on the introductory verse of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nM\u016bla-madhyamaka-k\u0101rik\u0101 (Katsura 1985 p.\n166).\n\nThe first work devoted entirely to argument and inference is the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n\n(\u65b9\u4fbf\u5fc3\u8ad6), or Treatise on the heart of\nmeans, translated into Chinese in 472 ce\nwithout attribution, though it later came to be attributed to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna. This text, translated into Sanskrit by G. Tucci\n(1929), is commonly known by scholars by the translation of its title\nby Tucci as Up\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya.\n\nFinally, shortly after Asa\u1e45ga, Vasubandhu (c. 5th century ce),\nanother Buddhist idealist, thought to be the\nyounger brother of the Asa\u1e45ga, wrote at least three works on\ndebate: V\u0101da-h\u1e5bdaya (Heart of debate),\nV\u0101da-vidh\u0101na (Precepts of debate) and\nV\u0101da-vidhi (Rules of debate). These texts have\nbeen lost, though fragments of the latter two, some in Sanskrit, many\nin Tibetan, have been collected (Frauwallner 1933, 1957; Ono 2020).\nAnother work, ascribed to Vasubandhu, which survives only in Chinese,\nis the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n\n(\u5982\u5be6\u8ad6), Treatise on truth. G. Tucci\n(1929), translating it back into Sanskrit, gave it the Sanskrit title\nTarka-\u015b\u0101stra, by which it is now generally known.\nHowever, as has been shown recently by Ono Motoi (Ono 2020 \u00a71),\nthis rendition is not correct.\n\nHaving surveyed the texts from the late preclassical period pertinent\nto the study of the development of logic, we now turn to the emergence\nof a canonical Indian syllogism.\n3.2 The emergence of a canonical syllogism\n\nThe earliest known example of the canonical Indian syllogism is found\nin the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101. The argument is clearly an\nanalogical one. The earliest known deductive version of the syllogism\nis found in the F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n, or\nUp\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya; and the earliest known discussion of\na deductive version of the syllogism is found in the\nR\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n, usually referred to as the\nTarka-\u015b\u0101stra. A concise version of the deductive\nversion is found in Vasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi.\n\nThe Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 (CS 3.8.31), like the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.1.32), takes the syllogism to\nhave five parts, the names for four of them being identical; however,\nunlike the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, the\nCaraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 provides an illustration of the\nsyllogism.\n\ncanonical syllogism (analogical)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nThe soul is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause of being un-produced. \n\nexample:\nSpace is unproduced and it is eternal. \n\napplication:\nAnd just as space is unproduced, so is the soul. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, the soul is eternal.  \n\n\n\nObserve that the first three statements in the syllogism have the form\nof the analogical syllogism using similarity as discussed above: p,\nthe soul, has S, the property of being eternal, because p, the soul,\nhas H, the property of being unproduced; as d, or space, has H, the\nproperty of being unproduced, and d, space, has S, the property of\nbeing eternal. However, the argument here adds two more statements:\nthe first spells out the analogy between the subject of the\nproposition and the example, using the correlative expression\nas (yath\u0101) \u2026 so\n(tath\u0101) \u2026; the second restates the\nargument\u2019s proposition.\n\nWhile Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 provides only one\nillustration of its canonical syllogism, the earliest extant\ncommentary on the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, called the\nNy\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya (Commentary on logic),\nhas passages in its commentary on NS 1.1.33\u201339, which permit the\nreconstruction of two analogical syllogisms, corresponding to those\nusing similarity and using dissimilarity discussed above. The\ncommentary, attributed to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (fifth ce),\nalso known as Pak\u1e63ilasv\u0101min,\nexplicitly distinguishes the syllogisms as one based on similarity\n(s\u0101dharmya) and the other based on dissimilarity\n(vaidharmya) discussed earlier. (For details, see Gillon\n2020.) The analogical syllogism based on similarity differs but\nslightly from the syllogism found in the\nCaraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101.\n\nThe F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n, or\nUp\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya, purports to be a primer on argument\nand reasoning, listing and defining many terms. It also contains many\narguments, several of which are analogical arguments both through\nsimilarity and through dissimilarity. The author of the text neither\nstates what an argument is nor what its parts are. Yet, in the first\nchapter, he speaks of excessive and deficient statements and says that\nthere are three kinds: deficiency of reason, deficiency of proposition\nand deficiency of example. (T1632 24.3.14\u201318; Gillon and Katsura\n2017 p. 215). Arguments which are not deficient in any of these ways\nis said to be complete. From the illustrations, it is clear that a\nnondeficient argument has the form: p has S, because of having H, like\nd, where d is assumed to have both H and S. In other words, a complete\nargument could be spelled out in the form whose explicit counterpart\nwould be that of an analogical syllogism using similarity of the kind\nfound in the polemical texts discussed earlier.\n\nThe only argument to appear in a form with five parts is given in the\nfourth, or last, chapter (T1632 28.1.4\u20136). Here is the argument\nas it occurs with the labels for the parts supplied for ease\ncomparison. Though the Chinese equivalent of proposition,\nreason and example appear in the text, the\nequivalents of application and conclusion do\nnot.\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nThe self is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is not perceptible by the senses. \n\nexample:\nSpace, because of not being perceptible by senses, is\neternal. \n\n\u00a0\nEverything which is not perceptible by senses\nis eternal. \n\napplication:\nAnd the self is not perceptible by senses. \n\nconclusion:\nCould the self possibly be non-eternal?  \n\n\n\nNote that example statement comprises two sentences: the first\nrestates what is expressed in the proposition and reason statements,\nthe second affirms a universal proposition, everything which is\nnot perceptible by senses is eternal. The example statement\ncomprises a deductively valid argument, as does the second sentence\ntogether with the reason and proposition statements. Surprisingly, the\nauthor rejects the syllogism as a bad one. The rejection is justified\nby an argument by analogy through dissimilarity.\n\nWhen we turn to the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n,\ncustomarily referred to as the Tarka-\u015b\u0101stra, we\nfind the logical situation has changed. A deductive syllogism similar\nto the one just set out is endorsed. Moreover, analogical syllogisms\nare explicitly rejected. For example, the text rejects the following\nanalogical syllogism (T1633 30.3.2\u20134).\n\ncanonical syllogism (analogical)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nSound is not eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause, arising due to an effort, it arises immediately.\n\n\nexample:\nAs a clay vessel, arising due to an effort, and\nhaving arisen, perishes, \n\napplication:\nsound too is that way. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, sound is not eternal.  \n\n\n\nThat the syllogism is analogical is made clear by the formulation of\nthe example and application statements.\n\nWhat the text\u2019s author advocates instead are syllogisms which\nare in fact deductively valid, similar to the syllogism cited and\nrejected in the F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n.\nHere is one example (T1633 30.3.7\u201310).\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nSound is not eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause, arising due to an effort, it arises immediately.\n\n\nexample:\nIf a thing is eternal, (then) it does not arise due to an\neffort. For example, space is eternal and does not arise due to an\neffort. \n\napplication:\nSound too is not that way. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, sound is not eternal.  \n\n\n\nThis argument, like the one rejected in F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n\nx\u012bn l\u00f9n, is deductively valid. The example statement\nalso comprises two sentences: the first, however, affirms a universal\nproposition, If a thing is eternal, (then) it does not arise due\nto an effort, and the second states an instance of the universal\nproposition, which is distinct from the subject of the argument. The\nproposition and reason statements, together with the first sentence of\nthe example statement, comprise a deductively valid argument.\n\nMoreover, we know that the author is fully aware of the\nsyllogism\u2019s logical force, for he states the three conditions,\nor three forms (tri-r\u016bpa), which a reason must satisfy\nfor the argument in which it occurs to be sound.\n\n\nthree forms (T1633 30.3.18\u201326):\n\nThe reason you set forth is not definite because eternality and\nnon-eternality appear throughout it. The reason I set forth has the\nthree marks. (1) The (reason) is a property of the subject, (2) it is\nincluded in things similar and (3) it is excluded from things\ndissimilar. Therefore, the reason I set forth succeeds in not\ndeviating, your reason does not. Therefore, your objection is\nconfused. If the reason you set forth were like my reason (in this\nrespect), your objection would succeed in being a proper\nobjection.\n\n\nAs noted by H. Ui 1929 (reported in Katsura 1985 p. 166), the earliest\nmention of the three forms appears in a brief passage in a non-logical\ntext, Sh\u00f9n zh\u014dng l\u00f9n (T1565 42a12,22ff).\nHowever, the author of this text, said to be Asa\u1e45ga, rejects the\ncriterion, a criterion thought to be of a non-Buddhist origin.\n\nFinally we come to Vasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi. Here\nthe endorsed argument retains the proposition and the reason, abandons\nthe application and the conclusion and simplifies the example, so that\nthe resulting syllogism has this form:\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nVasubandhu\n\n\n\nproposition:\np has S \n\nreason:\nbecause p has H. \n\nexample:\nThat which has H has S, like d. \n\n\u00a0\n(where d, distinct from p, has properties H and S). \n\n\n\n\nIt harks back to the form of the inferential syllogism mentioned\nearlier in our discussion of the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra and the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra. However, there is one\ncrucial difference: Vasubandhu is absolutely clear that the example\nstatement expresses an indispensability relation\n(a-vin\u0101-bh\u0101va: lit. not existing without,\nor sine qua non). As is clear, instances of this schema are\ndeductively valid arguments.\n3.3 Fallacies in arguments and missteps in debates\n\nThe obverse side of identifying a proper argument is identifying\nfallacious arguments. Fallacious arguments include, on the one hand,\nsyllogisms whose reasons have been identified as specious and, on the\nother hand, counter arguments, or rejoinders, identified as\ndefective.\n\nThe Caraka-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (CS 3.8.57) identifies and\nillustrates three kinds of arguments as defective. The first chapter\nof the fifth book of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 5.1) lists\nand briefly describes 24 arguments, which it designates as fallacious\nrejoinders (j\u0101ti). The fourth chapter of the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n lists and describes\ntwenty such arguments, which are either the same as, or similar to,\nthe arguments identified as fallacious rejoinders in the chapter of\nthe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra just mentioned. Surprisingly, the\nF\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n treats these\narguments as good rejoinders, as noted by Kajiyama (1989 p. 108). The\nmost interesting treatments of fallacious rejoinders are those found\nin the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n and in the\nV\u0101da-vidhi, where many of fallacious rejoinders have\nnames which are the same as those exemplified in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (Ono 2020 \u00a73.2 and \u00a73.5).\n(See also Randle 1930 ch. 6.2 and Solomon 1976 ch. 5.)\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra (VS 3.1.10\u201311) and\nthe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.2.4\u20139) name kinds of\nspecious reasons (hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa), but give neither\nexamples nor explanations of what they are. Three kinds are listed,\nand even briefly discussed, in the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101\n(CS 3.8.57). The F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n\nmerely lists eight kinds. Three kinds are exemplified and briefly\ndiscussed both in the V\u0101da-vidhi and in the\nR\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n. (See Randle 1930 ch. 3.5 and\nSolomon 1976 ch. 7.)\n\nBesides identifying fallacious syllogisms and rejoinders, some of\nthese texts also have either extended passages or entire chapters\ndevoted to the identification of behavior in debates which, when\ndisplayed by someone, warrants his being deemed to have lost. These\nmissteps, known as grounds for defeat\n(nigraha-sth\u0101na), range from making fallacious arguments\nto infringing the rules of debate procedure. The second chapter of the\nfifth book Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 5.2) sets out 22 cases,\nas does the third chapter of the R\u00fash\u00ed\nl\u00f9n. An extended passage of the\nCaraka-sa\u1e41h\u012bta (CS 3.8.50\u201365) lists 14\ncases. Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s Hetu-vidy\u0101 has an extended\npassage which classifies them into three kinds and provides cases of\neach. (See Randle 1930 ch. 6.3 and Solomon 1976 ch. 6.)\n4. Culmination of the Classical Period\n\nThe Buddhist thinker, Dign\u0101ga (c. 5th \u2013 6th century ce),\nconsolidates the insights into the canonical\ndeductively valid syllogism of his predecessors, and in particular\nthose of his teacher, Vasubandhu, as well as deepens them. He is, in\nfact, a pivotal figure in the history of Indian logic. This section is\ndivided into two parts: the first devoted to Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\ncontributions to Indian logic, especially the canonical syllogism, the\nsecond part summarizing other contributions from his contemporaries\nand successors, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist.\n4.1 Dign\u0101ga\n\nDign\u0101ga wrote three works pertaining to reasoning and argument.\nUnfortunately, in each case, the original Sanskrit text is not\navailable. One, the Ny\u0101ya-mukha (Introduction to\nlogic), is extant in Chinese translation.\u00a0However, a\nSanskrit manuscript is now known to exist in Tibet. It has yet to be\nedited and published. The remaining two are extant only in Tibetan\ntranslation: Hetu-cakra-\u1e0damaru (The drum wheel of\nreason) and his magnum opus,\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya (Compendium on epistemic\nmeans of cognition), four of whose six chapters are devoted to\ninference or argument.\n\nOne idea which is particularly clear in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work is\nhis explicit recognition that arguments which are expressed as\nsyllogisms are expressions of inferences. This is reflected in his\nterms inference for oneself\n(sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which refers to the cognitive\nprocess expressible as a syllogism, and inference for another\n(par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which refers to the verbal\nexpression of the syllogistic inference. These terms are also the\ntitles of the second and third chapters of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya.\n\nDign\u0101ga apparently enlarges the form of Vasubandhu\u2019s\ncanonical syllogism. Even though the texts just mentioned are not\nextant in Sanskrit, some of their commentaries are and some of these\ntexts\u2019 passages are found cited in existing Sanskrit works.\nAvailing himself of these works, S. Katsura (2004a p. 143) has\nidentified the following as an argument instantiating what\nDign\u0101ga considers the canonical form of a good syllogism.\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nDign\u0101ga\n\n\n\nthesis:\nSound is non-eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is immediately connected with an effort. \n\nsimilarity example:\nThat which is immediately connected with an effort is observed\nto be non-eternal, like a pot. \n\ndissimilarity example:\nThat which is eternal is observed not to be immediately\nconnected with an effort, like space.  \n\n\n\nBefore discussing the syllogism, we must take notice of the word\npak\u1e63a (thesis), which Dign\u0101ga uses\ninstead of pratij\u00f1\u0101 (proposition). The\nword is used both for the statement, previously called a proposition\nand now called a thesis, as well as for the factual situation it\nexpresses. It is also used to refer to the grammatical subject of the\nthesis statement as well as to the thing denoted by the grammatical\nsubject. (See Staal 1973 for a lucid exposition of this and other\nambiguities in the technical terms of classical Indian logic.)\n\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical syllogism, like that of Vasubandhu, has\nneither an application statement nor a conclusion statement. However,\nunlike that of Vasubandhu, it has two example statements. Each example\nstatement comprises a universal statement and a phrase naming\nsomething. In the case of the statement of similarity example, the\nuniversal statement asserts that whatever has the property adduced as\na reason (hetu) has the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma), which is mentioned in the\nsyllogism\u2019s thesis, while the phrase names something, distinct\nfrom the subject (pak\u1e63a), yet similar to it with\nrespect to the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma), and has the property adduced as the\nreason. The example named is said to be subject-like\n(sa-pak\u1e63a). In the case of the statement of\ndissimilarity example, the universal statement asserts that whatever\ndoes not have the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma) does not have the property adduced as a\nreason (hetu) and the phrase names something dissimilar to\nsubject with respect to the property to be established and not having\nthe property adduced as the reason. The example named here is said to\nbe subject-unlike (vi-pak\u1e63a). Finally, Dign\u0101ga\nseems to have added a word to the formulation of the universal\nstatement, namely, the word observed\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da), the past passive participle of the\nverb to see (d\u1e5b\u015b), which means not only\nto see but also to observe, to notice and even to know. Hereafter, we\nshall refer to a syllogism\u2019s reason statement as its minor\npremiss and the universal statement in its example statement as its\nmajor premiss.\n\nPerhaps most original in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work on argument and\ninference is what he called the wheel of reasons\n(hetu-cakra), an equivalent alternative to the three forms of\nreason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu). It comprises a three by three\nmatrix, which distinguishes a proper from an improper reason. It\nspecifies, on the one hand, the three cases of the reason\n(hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of subject-like things\n(sa-pak\u1e63a), and, on the other, the three cases of the\nreason (hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of\nsubject-unlike things (vi-pak\u1e63a). Letting H be the\nreason, S the subject-like things and \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) the\nsubject-unlike things, we obtain the following table.\n\n\n\n\nH occurs in:\nall S\nall S\nall S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) \n\nH occurs in:\nno S\nno S\nno S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) \n\nH occurs in:\nsome S\nsome S\nsome S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)  \n\n\n\nDign\u0101ga identified the syllogisms corresponding to the top and\nbottom cases of the middle column as good syllogisms and those\ncorresponding to the other cases as bad.\n\nThese developments have led to a rather lively debate among scholars\nof the development of logic in early classical India. A very succinct,\nbut somewhat misleading, way to put the question at the center of the\ndebate is whether or not Dign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical syllogism is\ninductive or deductive. A more cumbersome, but more precise, way to\nput the question is this: Is there a choice of a subject, of a\nproperty adduced as a reason, and of a property to be established\nwhich Dign\u0101ga would accept as constituting a good syllogism but\nwhich fails to satisfy the form corresponding to the canonical\nsyllogism given above?\n\nLet us now consider those aspects of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s treatment of\nthe syllogism which are at the center of this debate. One reason to\nthink that Dign\u0101ga would accept as a good syllogism one failing\nto be deductively valid might be his inclusion of the word\nobserved (d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) in the example\nstatement. In other words, one might think that Dign\u0101ga would\naccept as a good syllogism one in which, even though it is not the\ncase that whatever has H has S, it is the case that whatever is\nobserved to have H has S: that is to say, the major premiss pertains\nonly to observed cases of H, and not for every case of H. However, no\nsuch syllogisms are accepted by Dign\u0101ga. Indeed, the addition of\nthe word observed (d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) does not\npermit attributing such an idea to Dign\u0101ga, for the word is\nadded, not to the major premiss\u2019s subordinate, relative clause,\nbut to its main clause. Thus, what the major premiss says is not that\nevery observed instance of the reason (H) is an instance of the\nproperty to be established (S), but rather that every instance of the\nreason (H) is observed to be an instance of the property to be\nestablished (S). Moreover, if the word observed\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) has a factive sense, that is, a\nsense which presupposes the truth of the clause into which the word is\ninserted, as do several of its English translations, for example,\nnoticed, known, then the word in the statement\nleaves the truth conditions of major premiss unaffected.\n\nA further reason which has prompted scholars to think that included\namong the syllogisms Dign\u0101ga would accept as good ones are ones\nwhich might not be deductively valid is the fact that he has retained\nan example phrase in example statements, for such phrases have no\nbearing on the deductive validity of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical\nsyllogism. This doubt is re-enforced by the fact that example\nstatements, stripped of their example phrases, are contrapositives of\none another. Thus, one being logically equivalent to the other is also\nlogically superfluous with respect to it. Yet, Dign\u0101ga seems to\nbe aware of the equivalence, for he acknowledges in his commentarial\ndiscussion of the three forms (PS 2.5) that the second and third forms\nare equivalent (Katsura 2000 p. 245; Katsura 2004b pp. 121\u2013124),\nfrom which it follows that any two statements, one of which satisfies\nthe second form and the other of which satisfies the third form are\nequivalent.\n\nThat said, it is nonetheless perfectly reasonable to exclude some\ndeductively valid syllogisms as good syllogisms. Consider, for\nexample, a syllogism whose conclusion is identical with one of its\npremisses. It is a deductively valid syllogism, though it is utterly\nunpersuasive. Dign\u0101ga, like any rational thinker, would not, and\ndid not, accept as a good syllogism any syllogism in which the reason\n(H) and the property to be established (S) are the same property, even\nif such syllogisms have the same form as the canonical syllogism\nabove. Excluding such circular syllogisms is fully consistent with the\nview that the syllogisms accepted by Dign\u0101ga are only deductively\nvalid ones. (For extensive scholarly discussion of the role of\nexamples in Buddhist arguments, see the collection of articles in\nKatsura and Steinkellner (eds.) 2004.)\n\nA good reason for Dign\u0101ga to retain an example phrase in the\nexample statements of his canonical syllogism would be to exclude\nsyllogisms which are patently unpersuasive, even though, like circular\nsyllogisms, they are deductively valid. Consider the following\nargument:\n\n\n\nthesis:\nSound is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is audible. \n\nsimilarity example:\nWhatever is audible is eternal.  \n\n\nThis syllogism, rejected as a bad syllogism by Dign\u0101ga, was put\nforth by a school of Brahmanical thinkers who held, for doctrinal\nreasons, that sound is eternal. To maintain this claim in the face of\nobservation to the contrary, these thinkers maintained instead that\nwhat is transitory is the revelation of sound, not sound itself.\nAccording to them, in other words, sound is constantly present, but we\nhear it only when its presence is revealed.\n\nTheir syllogism as stated above, though deductively valid, is utterly\nunpersuasive. The reason is that the instances of audibility (H), are\ncoextensive with sound (p). Thus, there is no independent empirical\nevidence to support the universal statement that whatever is audible\nis eternal. Requiring that there be at least some thing different from\nsound which is both audible and eternal is an obvious and plausible\nway to eliminate such patently unpersuasive syllogisms. Dign\u0101ga,\ntherefore, rules out the syllogism as a bad syllogism, rather than, as\nwe would, accept it as a valid syllogism with an unpersuasive premiss.\n(See also Tillemans 1990.)\n\nBut this cannot be the entire explanation of why Dign\u0101ga appears\nto insist on example phrases in example statements, for nowhere does\nhe rule out as a good syllogism one which, though valid, is\nunpersuasive for want of some subject-unlike thing.\n\nBecause of the doubts just discussed, some scholars think that\nDign\u0101ga was not striving to work out a deductive form of\nreasoning and argument. Rather, according to some, such as Hayes\n(1980; 1988 ch. 4.2), Dign\u0101ga was seeking to develop an inductive\nform of reasoning and argument. According to others, such as Oetke\n(1994; 1996), Dign\u0101ga and some of his predecessors and\ncontemporaries were striving to spell out a defeasible form of\nreasoning and argument. (See Taber 2004 for a critical assessment of\nOetke\u2019s view.)\n\nA final contribution by Dign\u0101ga is found in the sixth and final\nchapter of his Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya, where he\naddresses fourteen fallacious rejoinders (j\u0101ti), each\nbearing the same name as one of the fourteen treated in\nVasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi, though sometimes the\nargument associated with a particular name in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya is different from the one\nassociated with the name in the V\u0101da-vidhi. His\ntreatment is often different from, and critical of, the treatment\nfound in this earlier work.\n4.2 Dign\u0101ga\u2019s contemporaries and immediate successors\n\nHowever much scholars may disagree about Dign\u0101ga\u2019s aim in\nthe formulation of the canonical syllogism, all agree that his works\nset the framework within which subsequent Buddhist thinkers addressed\nphilosophical issues pertaining to inference and debate. Thus,\n\u015aa\u1e47karasv\u0101min (c. 6th century ce),\na pupil of Dign\u0101ga (Frauwallner 1961,\n140), wrote a brief manual of inference for Buddhists, called the\nNy\u0101ya-prave\u015ba (Beginning logic), based\ndirectly on Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work. Not long thereafter,\nDharmak\u012brti (c. 7th century ce), the\ngreat Buddhist metaphysician, also elaborated his views on inference\nand debate within the framework found in Dign\u0101ga.\n\nThe canonical syllogism, treated as an inference, is that whereby one\nwho knows the truth of its premisses may also come to know the truth\nof its conclusion. While the truth of a particular statement is\nthought to be known either through perception or through inference,\nhow is the truth of a universal statement, such as the major premiss\nof a canonical syllogism, known? To know its truth would seem to\nrequire that one know of each thing which has H, whether or not it\nalso has S. Yet if one knew that, one would already know by perception\nthe canonical syllogism\u2019s conclusion. As a result, inference\nwould be a superfluous means of knowledge.\n\nThe earliest classical Indian philosopher thought to have recognized\nthe problem of how one comes to know the truth of a universal\nstatement seems to have been \u012a\u015bvarasena (Steinkellner 1997\np. 638). He appears to have thought that knowledge of the major\npremiss is grounded in non-perception (anupalabdhi). That is,\naccording to \u012a\u015bvarasena, knowledge that whatever has H has S\ncomes from the simple failure to perceive something which has H but\nwhich does not have S. (See Steinkellner 1993, where he draws on\nSteinkellner 1966.)\n\nHowever, this suggestion does not solve the problem, for reasons laid\nout in detail by Dharmak\u012brti (c. 7th century ce).\nHis extensive writing on epistemology in\ngeneral and on reason and argument in particular formed a watershed in\nclassical India philosophy. Besides his magnum opus,\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika (Gloss on the means of\nepistemic cognition), one of whose four chapters is devoted to\ninference (sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), comprising 340 verses\nand a commentary by him to it, and another devoted to argument\n(par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which comprises 285 verses, he\nwrote several smaller works, including\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-vini\u015bcaya (Settling on what the\nepistemic means of cognition are), Ny\u0101ya-bindu\n(Drop of logic), Hetu-bindu (Drop of\nreason) and V\u0101da-ny\u0101ya (Logic of\ndebate). As he makes abundantly clear in verses 13\u201325 and\nhis commentary thereto of the chapter on inference\n(sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na) of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101rttika, the simple failure to\nperceive something which has H but which does not have S is no\nguarantee that whatever has H has S; after all, while one has never\nencountered something which has H and does not have S, what guarantee\nis there that something which has H and does not have S is not among\nthe things which one has yet to encounter? Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nanswer was that the truth of the first premiss is guaranteed by either\nof two relations obtaining between properties: the causation relation\n(tadutpatti) and the identity relation\n(t\u0101d\u0101tmya). Unfortunately, as one might suspect,\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s solution does not work. (See Gillon 1991; see\nSteinkellner 2015 for a dissenting view.)\n\nStarting with Dign\u0101ga, those interested in logic started to add\nthe particle eva to the various clauses of the three forms of\nreason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu) (Katsura 1986).\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s formulation of the three forms came in for\ncriticism at the hands of the Ny\u0101ya thinker, Uddyotakara (c. late\n6th century ce), which was, in turn, addressed\nby Dharmak\u012brti, who uses the particle to express each of the\nthree conditions (NB 2.5).\n\nthree forms of reason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu)\n\n\n\nfirst form:\nthe reason\u2019s definite (eva) existence in the\nsubject; \n\nsecond form:\nthe reason\u2019s existence in subject-like things only\n(eva); \n\nthird form:\nthe reason\u2019s utter (eva) non-existence in\nsubject-unlike things.  \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the precision hoped for is undermined by the ambiguity\nin the meaning of the particle eva. The particle eva\nhas two principal uses: one emphatic, the other restrictive. What it\nemphasizes or restricts depends on the word after which it is placed.\nThe particle in the statement of the first form applies to the\nabstract noun existence and, in its emphatic use, is well\ntranslated by definite or actual. The particle in\nthe statement of the third form applies to the negative abstract noun\nnon-existence and, in its emphatic use with negation, is best\ntranslated by utter or at all. (Some scholars\ntranslate the particle in these statements as necessary.\nThere is, however, no philological justification for such a\ntranslation.) The particle in the second form applies to a concrete\nnoun. Though here the particle could have either an emphatic or a\nrestrictive use, only the restrictive use fits the context. A problem\narises from the word subject-like (sa-pak\u1e63a).\nIt can be construed in two ways: either as including or as excluding\nthe subject. If subject-like is construed as inclusive and\nthe particle eva is taken as restrictive, then the second and\nthird forms are logically equivalent; but the statement of the three\nforms has the rhetorical blemish of containing a logically superfluous\nform. If subject-like is taken as exclusive and the particle\nis taken as restrictive, then the three forms are inconsistent, for in\nthat case the second form entails the contradictory of the first form.\n(For details, see Gillon 1999.)\n\nIdeas on the nature of reasoning and argumentation very similar to\nthose of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s are found in the\nPad\u0101rtha-dharma-sa\u1e43graha (Summary of\ncategories and properties), a work better known as\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da-bh\u0101\u1e63ya\n(Pra\u015bastap\u0101da\u2019s commentary, customarily\nregarded as a commentary on the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra). Its author,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da (c. 6th century ce), is\na near contemporary of Dign\u0101ga. Like Dign\u0101ga,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da uses the expression inference for\nanother (par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na) to refer to\narguments cast in a syllogistic form, thereby making clear his\nrecognition that inferences, or cognitive processes, and arguments, or\nverbal expressions, are two sides of the same coin. Also like\nDign\u0101ga, Pra\u015bastap\u0101da adopts as a canonical syllogism\nan argument whose core is the same deductively valid argument as\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s. However, unlike Dign\u0101ga, he retains the\nfive members for the syllogism, in keeping with the five members of\nthe analogical syllogism set out by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, though some\nof the names for the members are different. The following syllogism is\nreassembled from Pra\u015bastap\u0101da\u2019s treatment of\ninference. (See Randle 1930 p. 176.)\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da\n\n\n\nproposition:\nWind is a substance [266] \n\nreason:\nbecause it possesses action. [268] \n\nexample:\nThat which possesses movement is observed to be a substance,\nlike an arrow. [278] \n\napplication:\nAnd in the same way wind possesses action. [281] \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, it is indeed a substance. [282]  \n\n\n\n(The numbers above in square brackets refer to the paragraph numbers\nof the passages containing the relevant sentences in Bronkhorst and\nRamseier (eds.) 1994.) Again, like Dign\u0101ga,\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da appeals to the same three conditions to define\na proper reason as those used in the three forms of a reason. And\nfinally, he identifies and classifies specious reasons in terms of the\nfailure of a reason to satisfy one or other of the three forms.\n\nThe question of whether the deductively valid canonical syllogism\nspread from Dign\u0101ga to Pra\u015bastap\u0101da, or from\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da to Dign\u0101ga, or from some other person to\nthe two of them both has yet to be decided. Whatever the answer is to\nthis question, it is clear that a deductively valid version of the\ncanonical syllogism came to be adopted virtually by every classical\nIndian thinker and that it made its way to China, Korea and Japan\nthrough the spread of Buddhism.\n\nIt was not long before the ideas pertaining to the canonical syllogism\nbecame generally accepted not only by other non-Brahmanical thinkers,\nsuch as the Jains, but also by Brahmanical thinkers. For example, the\nJain thinker, Jinabhadra (6th ce), a junior\ncontemporary of Dign\u0101ga, wrote a commentary on the Jain thinker\nBhadrab\u0101hu where he took claims in the latter\u2019s work and\nrecast them in the form of the canonical argument as found in\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s work (Uno 2009). In addition, one finds that the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 thinker Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n(c. early 7th century ce) adopted, without\nspecial comment, a deductively valid version of the canonical\nsyllogism. His thoughts on the matter are developed at length in the\none hundred eighty-eight verses of his\n\u015aloka-v\u0101rttika\u2019s (Gloss in verses)\nAnum\u0101na-pariccheda (Section on inference). At\nthe same time, though the Ny\u0101ya thinker Uddyotakara argued\nvigorously against many of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s views, he nonetheless\nadvocated a version of the canonical syllogism which is deductively\nvalid.\n\nIn spite of the metaphysical differences which distinguished the\nvarious schools of thought, both Buddhist and Brahmanical, all\nthinkers came to use a naive realist\u2019s ontology to specify the\nstates of affairs in connection with the canonical syllogism.\nAccording to this view, the world consists of individual substances,\nor things (dravya), universals (s\u0101m\u0101nya)\nand relations between them. The fundamental relation is the one of\noccurrence (v\u1e5btti). The relata of this relation are\nknown as substratum (dharmin) and superstratum\n(dharma) respectively. The relation has two forms: contact\n(sa\u1e43yoga) and inherence (samav\u0101ya). So,\nfor example, one individual substance, a pot, may occur on another,\nsay the reason, by the relation of contact. In this case, the pot is\nthe superstratum and the reason is the substratum. Or, a universal,\nsay treeness, may occur in an individual substance, say an individual\ntree, by the relation of inherence. Here, treeness, the superstratum,\ninheres in the individual tree, the substratum. The converse of the\nrelation of occurrence is the relation of possession. In addition, the\nrelation of pervasion (vy\u0101pti), or what had also been\nreferred to as the relation of indispensability\n(a-vin\u0101-bh\u0101va), can also be defined in terms of the\noccurrence relation: one superstratum pervades another just in case\nwherever the second occurs the first occurs. The converse of the\npervasion relation is the concomitance relation (anvaya) and\nits contrapositive is exclusion (vyatireka). As a result of\nthese relations, the world embodies a structure: if one superstratum,\ndesignated as H, is concomitant with another superstratum, designated\nas S, and if a particular substratum, say p, possesses the former\nsuperstratum, then it possesses the second. This structure is the one\nwhich underlies the classical Indian canonical syllogism.\n\nThough the canonical syllogism is central to the development of\nreflection on argument and reasoning in preclassical and classical\nIndia, other forms of argument were also recognized as good. One form,\nas mentioned above, is reductio ad absurdum\n(prasa\u1e45ga). Others include suppositional reasoning\n(tarka) (Bagchi 1953) and a form of reasoning akin to what\ncontemporaries would call disjunctive syllogism\n(arth\u0101patti) (Keating (ed.) 2020). At the same time,\nthere are forms of argument, different from the fallacious rejoinders\nand specious reasons, which were also regarded as bad. They include\narguments which lead to an infinite regress (anavasth\u0101),\nmentioned above, as well as various forms of circularity. Finally,\nthere are two important forms of argument: one peculiar to Buddhists,\nknown as the tetralemma (catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di), and the\nother peculiar to the Jains (sy\u0101dv\u0101da).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Original Texts", "General Works", "References"], "cat_ref_text": {"Original Texts": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "<em>Abhidharma-samuccaya</em> (<em>Compendium of the higher\nteachings</em>) by Asa\u1e45ga;
