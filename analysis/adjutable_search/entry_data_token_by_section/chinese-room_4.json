    "main_text": "The Chinese Room Argument\n3. The Chinese Room Argument\n\nIn 1980 John Searle published \u201cMinds, Brains and Programs\u201d\nin the journal The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. In this\narticle, Searle sets out the argument, and then replies to the\nhalf-dozen main objections that had been raised during his earlier\npresentations at various university campuses (see next section). In\naddition, Searle\u2019s article in BBS was published along\nwith comments and criticisms by 27 cognitive science researchers.\nThese 27 comments were followed by Searle\u2019s replies to his\ncritics.\n\nIn the decades following its publication, the Chinese Room argument\nwas the subject of very many discussions. By 1984, Searle presented\nthe Chinese Room argument in a book, Minds, Brains and\nScience. In January 1990, the popular periodical Scientific\nAmerican took the debate to a general scientific audience. Searle\nincluded the Chinese Room Argument in his contribution, \u201cIs the\nBrain\u2019s Mind a Computer Program?\u201d, and Searle\u2019s\npiece was followed by a responding article, \u201cCould a Machine\nThink?\u201d, written by philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland.\nSoon thereafter Searle had a published exchange about the Chinese Room\nwith another leading philosopher, Jerry Fodor (in Rosenthal (ed.)\n1991).\n\nThe heart of the argument is Searle imagining himself following a\nsymbol-processing program written in English (which is what Turing\ncalled \u201ca paper machine\u201d). The English speaker (Searle)\nsitting in the room follows English instructions for manipulating\nChinese symbols, whereas a computer \u201cfollows\u201d (in some\nsense) a program written in a computing language. The human produces\nthe appearance of understanding Chinese by following the symbol\nmanipulating instructions, but does not thereby come to understand\nChinese. Since a computer just does what the human does \u2013\nmanipulate symbols on the basis of their syntax alone \u2013 no\ncomputer, merely by following a program, comes to genuinely understand\nChinese.\n\nThis narrow argument, based closely on the Chinese Room scenario, is\nspecifically directed at a position Searle calls \u201cStrong\nAI\u201d. Strong AI is the view that suitably programmed computers\n(or the programs themselves) can understand natural language and\nactually have other mental capabilities similar to the humans whose\nbehavior they mimic. According to Strong AI, these computers really\nplay chess intelligently, make clever moves, or understand language.\nBy contrast, \u201cweak AI\u201d is the much more modest claim that\ncomputers are merely useful in psychology, linguistics, and other\nareas, in part because they can simulate mental abilities. But weak AI\nmakes no claim that computers actually understand or are intelligent.\nThe Chinese Room argument is not directed at weak AI, nor does it\npurport to show that no machine can think \u2013 Searle says that\nbrains are machines, and brains think. The argument is directed at the\nview that formal computations on symbols can produce thought.\n\nWe might summarize the narrow argument as a reductio ad\nabsurdum against Strong AI as follows. Let L be a natural\nlanguage, and let us say that a \u201cprogram for L\u201d is a\nprogram for conversing fluently in L. A computing system is any\nsystem, human or otherwise, that can run a program.\n\nIf Strong AI is true, then there is a program for Chinese such\nthat if any computing system runs that program, that system thereby\ncomes to understand Chinese.\nI could run a program for Chinese without thereby coming to\nunderstand Chinese.\nTherefore Strong AI is false.\n\n\nThe first premise elucidates the claim of Strong AI. The second\npremise is supported by the Chinese Room thought experiment. The\nconclusion of this narrow argument is that running a program cannot\nendow the system with language understanding. (There are other ways of\nunderstanding the structure of the argument. It may be relevant to\nunderstand some of the claims as counterfactual: e.g. \u201cthere is\na program\u201d in premise 1 as meaning there could be a program,\netc. On this construal the argument involves modal logic, the logic of\npossibility and necessity (see Damper 2006 and Shaffer 2009)). \n\nIt is also worth noting that the first premise above attributes\nunderstanding to \u201cthe system\u201d. Exactly what Strong-AI\nsupposes will acquire understanding when the program runs is crucial\nto the success or failure of the CRA. Schank 1978 has a title that\nclaims their group\u2019s computer, a physical device, understands,\nbut in the body of the paper he claims that the program\n[\u201cSAM\u201d] is doing the understanding: SAM, Schank says\n\u201c...understands stories about domains about which it has\nknowledge\u201d (p. 133). As we will see in the next section (4),\nthese issues about the identity of the understander (the cpu? the\nprogram? the system? something else?) quickly came to the fore for\ncritics of the CRA. Searle\u2019s wider argument includes the claim\nthat the thought experiment shows more generally that one cannot get\nsemantics (meaning) from syntax (formal symbol manipulation). That and\nrelated issues are discussed in section 5: The Larger Philosophical\nIssues.\n",
