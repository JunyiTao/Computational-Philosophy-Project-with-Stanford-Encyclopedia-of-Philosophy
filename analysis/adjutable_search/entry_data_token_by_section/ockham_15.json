    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || The Rejection of Species\n6.1 The Rejection of Species\n\nOckham\u2019s theory of knowledge, like his natural philosophy, is\nbroadly Aristotelian in form, although\u2014again, like his natural\nphilosophy\u2014it is \u201cAristotelian\u201d in its own way. For\nmost Aristotelians of the day, knowledge involved the transmission of\na\n \u201cspecies\u201d[39]\n between the object and the mind. At the sensory level, this species\nmay be compared to the more recent notion of a sense\n\u201cimpression.\u201d More generally, we can think of it as the\nstructure or configuration of the object, a structure or configuration\nthat can be \u201cencoded\u201d in different ways and found\nisomorphically in a variety of contexts. One recent author, describing\nthe theory as it occurs in Aquinas, puts it like\n this:[40]\n\nConsider, for example, blueprints. In a blueprint of a library, the\nconfiguration of the library itself, that is, the very configuration\nthat will be in the finished library, is captured on paper but in such\na way that it does not make the paper itself into a library. Rather,\nthe configuration is imposed on the paper in a different sort of way\nfrom the way it is imposed on the materials of the library. What\nAquinas thinks of as transferring and preserving a configuration we\ntend to consider as a way of encoding information.\n\n\nThe configuration of features found in the external object is also\nfound in \u201cencoded\u201d form as a species in the organ that\nsenses the object. (Depending on the sense modality, it may also be\nfound in an intervening medium. For example, with vision and hearing,\nthe species is transmitted through the air to the sense organ.) At the\nintellectual level, the so called \u201cagent intellect\u201d goes\nto work on this species and somehow produces the universal concept\nthat is the raw material of intellectual\n cognition.[41]\n\nOckham rejected this entire theory of species. For him, species are\nunnecessary to a successful theory of cognition, and he dispenses with\n them.[42]\n Moreover, he argues, the species theory is not supported by\nexperience; introspection reveals no such species in our cognitive\n processes.[43]\n This rejection of the species theory of cognition, which had been\nforeshadowed by several previous authors (such as Henry of Ghent in\nthe thirteenth century), was an important development in late medieval\n epistemology.[44]\n",
