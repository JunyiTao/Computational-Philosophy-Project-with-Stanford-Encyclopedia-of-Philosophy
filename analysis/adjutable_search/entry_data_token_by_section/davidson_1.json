    "main_text": "Action and Mind || Reasons as Causes\n2.1 Reasons as Causes\n\nMuch of Davidson\u2019s early work was in decision theory (see\nDecision-Making: An Experimental Approach [1957]), and it was\nnot until the early 1960s that the work for which he is best known\nbegan to appear in print. Indeed, Davidson\u2019s first major\nphilosophical publication was the seminal paper \u2018Actions,\nReasons and Causes\u2019 (1963). In that paper Davidson sets out to\ndefend the view that the explanation of action by reference to reasons\n(something we do, for instance, when we refer to an agent\u2019s\nintentions or motives in acting) is also a form of causal explanation.\nIndeed, he argues that reasons explain actions just inasmuch as they\nare the causes of those actions. This approach was in clear opposition\nto the Wittgensteinian orthodoxy of the time. On this latter account\ncausal explanation was viewed as essentially a matter of showing the\nevent to be explained as an instance of some law-like regularity (as\nwe might explain the whistling of a kettle by reference to certain\nlaws involving, among other things, the behaviour of gases under\npressure). Since rational explanation was held, in general, not to\ninvolve any such reference to laws, but rather required showing how\nthe action fitted into some larger pattern of rational behaviour,\nexplanation by reference to reasons was held to be distinct from and\nindependent of explanation by reference to causes.\n\nAlthough directed against the Wittgensteinian-inspired view that\nreasons cannot be causes, Davidson\u2019s argument nevertheless\neffectively redeploys several Wittgensteinian ideas (see Stoutland, in\nMalpas 2011: 297\u2013324, for a sympathetic, but not uncritical,\nexamination of the Davidsonian view of action from a largely\nWittgensteinian perspective). Two ideas play an especially significant\nrole in the Davidsonian account \u2013 ideas that are also, in one\nform or another, important in Davidson\u2019s thinking elsewhere. The\nfirst of these ideas is the notion of a \u2018primary reason\u2019\n\u2013 the pairing of a belief and a desire (or\n\u2018pro-attitude\u2019) in the light of which an action is\nexplained. Thus, my action of flipping the light switch can be\nexplained by reference to my having the belief that flipping\nthe switch turns on the light in combination with my having the\ndesire to turn on the light (for most explanations explicit\nreference to both the belief and the desire is unnecessary). An action\nis thereby rendered intelligible through being embedded in a broader\nsystem of attitudes attributable to the agent \u2013 through being\nembedded, that is, in a broader framework of rationality. The\nsecond idea is that of action \u2018under a description\u2019 (a\nphrase originally appearing in G. E. M. Anscombe\u2019s\nIntention, published in 1959). As with the concept of a\nprimary reason, the idea here is simple enough: one and the same\naction is always amenable to more than one correct description. This\nidea is especially important, however, as it provides a means by which\nthe same item of behaviour can be understood as intentional under some\ndescriptions but not under others. Thus, my action of flipping the\nlight switch can be redescribed as the act of turning on the light\n(under which it is intentional) and also as the act of alerting the\nprowler who, unbeknown to me, is lurking in the bushes outside (under\nwhich it is unintentional). Generalising this point, we can say that\nthe same event can be referred to under quite disparate descriptions:\nthe event of alerting the prowler is the same event as my flipping the\nlight switch which is the same event as my moving of my body (or a\npart of my body) in a certain way.\n\nDavidson treats the connection between reason and action (where the\nreason is indeed the reason for the action) as a connection\nthat obtains between two events (the agent\u2019s believing and\ndesiring on the one hand and her acting on the other) that can be\nvariously described. The connection is both rational, inasmuch as the\nbelief-desire pair (the \u2018primary reason\u2019) specifies the\nreason for the action, but it is also causal, inasmuch as the one\nevent causes the other if it is indeed the reason for it. It is\nprecisely because the reason is causally related to the action that\nthe action can be explained by reference to the reason. Indeed, where\nan agent has several reasons for acting, and yet acts on the basis of\none reason in particular, there is no way to pick out just that reason\non which the agent acts other than by saying that it is the reason\nthat caused her action.\n\nUnderstood as rational, the connection between reason and action\ncannot be described in terms of any strict law. Yet inasmuch as the\nconnection is also a causal connection, so there must exist some\nlaw-like regularity, though not describable in the language of\nrationality, under which the events in question fall (an explanation\ncan be causal, then, even though it does not specify any strict law).\nDavidson is thus able to maintain that rational explanation need not\ninvolve explicit reference to any law-like regularity, while\nnevertheless also holding that there must be some such regularity that\nunderlies the rational connection just inasmuch as it is causal.\nMoreover, since Davidson resists the idea that rational explanations\ncan be formulated in the terms of a predictive science, so he seems\ncommitted to denying that there can be any reduction of rational to\nnon-rational explanation.\n",
