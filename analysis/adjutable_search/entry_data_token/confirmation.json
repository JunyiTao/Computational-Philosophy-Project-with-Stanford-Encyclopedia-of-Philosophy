This general idea seems to underlie sound and\neffective inferential practices in all sorts of domains, from everyday\nreasoning up to the frontiers of science. Yet it is also clear that,\neven with extensive and truthful evidence available, drawing a\nmistaken conclusion is more than a mere possibility. For painfully\ntangible examples, one only has to consider missed medical diagnoses\n(see Winters et al. 2012) or judicial errors (see Liebman et al.\n2000). The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711\u20131776) is\nusually credited for having disclosed the theoretical roots of these\nconsiderations in a particularly transparent way (see Howson 2000,\nLange 2011, and Varzi 2008). In most cases of interest, Hume pointed\nout, many alternative candidate hypotheses remain logically compatible\nwith all the relevant information at one\u2019s disposal, so that\nnone of the former can be singled out by the latter with full\ncertainty. Thus, under usual circumstances, reasoning from evidence\nmust remain fallible.\n\nThis fundamental insight has been the source of a lasting theoretical\nchallenge: if amenable to analysis, the role of evidence as supporting\n(or infirming) hypotheses has to be grasped by more nuanced tools than\nplain logical entailment. As emphasized in a joke attributed to\nAmerican philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen (1880\u20131947), logic\ntextbooks had to be divided in two parts: in the first part, on\ndeductive logic, unwarranted forms of inference (deductive fallacies)\nare exposed; in the second part, on inductive logic, they are endorsed\n(see Meehl 1990, 110). In contemporary philosophy, confirmation\ntheory can be roughly described as the area where efforts have\nbeen made to take up the challenge of defining plausible models of\nnon-deductive reasoning. Its central technical term\u2014\nconfirmation\u2014has often been used more or less\ninterchangeably with \u201cevidential support\u201d,\n\u201cinductive strength\u201d, and the like. Here we will generally\ncomply with this liberal usage (although more subtle conceptual and\nterminological distinctions are sometimes drawn).\n\nConfirmation theory has proven a rather difficult endeavour. In\nprinciple, it would aim at providing understanding and guidance for\ntasks such as diagnosis, prediction, and learning in virtually any\narea of inquiry. Yet popular accounts of confirmation have often been\ntaken to run into troubles even when faced with toy philosophical\nexamples. Be that as it may, there is at least one real-world kind of\nactivity which has remained a prevalent target and benchmark, i.e.,\nscientific reasoning, and especially key episodes from the history of\nmodern and contemporary natural science. The motivation for this is\neasily figured out. Mature sciences seem to have been uniquely\neffective in relying on observed evidence to establish extremely\ngeneral, powerful, and sophisticated theories. Indeed, being capable\nof receiving genuine support from empirical evidence is itself a very\ndistinctive trait of scientific hypotheses as compared to other kinds\nof statements. A philosophical characterization of what science is\nwould then seem to require an understanding of the logic of\nconfirmation. And so, traditionally, confirmation theory has come to\nbe a central concern of philosophers of science.\n\nIn the following, major approaches to confirmation theory are\noverviewed according to a classification that is relatively standard\n(see Earman and Salmon 1992; Norton 2005): confirmation by instances\n(Section 1), hypothetico-deductivism and its variants (Section 2), and\nprobabilistic (Bayesian) approaches (Section 3).\n", "toc": [{"#ConIns": "1.

Confirmation by instances\n\nIn a seminal essay on induction, Jean Nicod (1924) offered the\nfollowing important remark:\n\n\nConsider the formula or the law: \\(F\\) entails \\(G\\). How can a\nparticular proposition, or more briefly, a fact affect its\nprobability? If this fact consists of the presence of \\(G\\) in a case\nof \\(F\\), it is favourable to the law [\u2026]; on the contrary, if\nit consists of the absence of \\(G\\) in a case of \\(F\\), it is\nunfavourable to this law. (219, notation slightly adapted)\n\n\nNicod\u2019s work was an influential source for Carl Gustav\nHempel\u2019s (1943, 1945) early studies in the logic of\nconfirmation. In Hempel\u2019s view, the key valid message of\nNicod\u2019s statement is that the observation report that an object\n\\(a\\) displays properties \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) (e.g., that \\(a\\) is a swan\nand is white) confirms the universal hypothesis that all \\(F\\)-objects\nare \\(G\\)-objects (namely, that all swans are white). Apparently, it\nis by means of this kind of confirmation by instances that one can\nobtain supporting evidence for statements such as \u201csodium salts\nburn yellow\u201d, \u201cwolves live in a pack\u201d, or\n\u201cplanets move in elliptical orbits\u201d (also see Russell\n1912, Ch. 6). We will now see the essential features of Hempel\u2019s\nanalysis of confirmation.\n1.1 Hempel\u2019s theory\n\nHempel\u2019s theory addresses the non-deductive relation of confirmation\nbetween evidence and hypothesis, but relies thoroughly on standard\nlogic for its full technical formulation. As a consequence, it also\ngoes beyond Nicod\u2019s idea in terms of clarity and rigor. \n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be the set of the closed sentences of a first-order\nlogical language \\(L\\) (finite, for simplicity) and consider \\(h, e\n\\in \\bL\\). Also let \\(e\\), the evidence statement, be consistent and\ncontain individual constants only (no quantifier), and let \\(I(e)\\) be\nthe set of all constants occurring (non-vacuously) in \\(e\\). So, for\nexample, if \\(e = Qa \\wedge Ra\\), then \\(I(e) = \\{a\\}\\), and if \\(e =\nQa \\wedge Qb\\), then \\(I(e) = \\{a,b\\}\\). (The non-vacuity clause is\nmeant to ensure that if sentence \\(e\\) happens to be, say, \\(Qa \\wedge\nQb \\wedge (Rc \\vee \\neg Rc)\\), then \\(I(e)\\) still is \\(\\{a, b\\}\\),\nfor \\(e\\) does not really state anything non-trivial about the\nindividual denoted by \\(c\\). See Sprenger 2011a, 241\u2013242.)\nHempel\u2019s theory relies on the technical construct of the\ndevelopment of hypothesis \\(h\\) for evidence \\(e\\), or the\n\\(e\\)-development of \\(h\\), indicated by \\(dev_{e}(h)\\). Intuitively,\n\\(dev_{e}(h)\\) is all that (and only what) \\(h\\) says once restricted\nto the individuals mentioned (non-vacuously) in \\(e\\), i.e., exactly\nthose denoted by the elements of \\(I(e)\\).\n\nThe notion of the \\(e\\)-development of hypothesis \\(h\\) can be given\nan entirely general and precise definition, but we\u2019ll not need\nthis level of detail here. Suffice it to say that the\n\\(e\\)-development of a universally quantified material conditional\n\\(\\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\) is just as expected, that is: \\(Fa\n\\rightarrow Ga\\) in case \\(I(e) = \\{a\\}\\); \\((Fa \\rightarrow Ga)\n\\wedge (Fb \\rightarrow Gb)\\) in case \\(I(e) = \\{a,b\\}\\), and so on.\nFollowing Hempel, we will take universally quantified material\nconditionals as canonical logical representations of relevant\nhypotheses. So, for instance, we will count a statement of the form\n\\(\\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\) as an adequate rendition of, say,\n\u201call pieces of copper conduct electricity\u201d.\n\nIn Hempel\u2019s theory, evidence statement \\(e\\) is said to confirm\nhypothesis \\(h\\) just in case it entails, not \\(h\\) in its full\nextension, but suitable instantiations of \\(h\\). The\ntechnical notion of the \\(e\\)-development of \\(h\\) is devised to\nidentify precisely those relevant instantiations, that is, the\nconsequences of \\(h\\) as restricted to the individuals involved in\n\\(e\\). More precisely, Hempelian confirmation can be defined as\nfollows:\n\nHempelian confirmation\n\nFor any \\(h,e \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(e\\) is consistent and contains\nindividual constants only (no quantifier):\n\n\nevidence \\(e\\) directly Hempel-confirms hypothesis \\(h\\)\nif and only if \\(e \\vDash dev_{e}(h)\\); \\(e\\) Hempel-confirms\n\\(h\\) if and only if, for some \\(s \\in \\bL\\), \\(e \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\)\nand \\(s \\vDash h\\);\nevidence \\(e\\) directly Hempel-disconfirms hypothesis\n\\(h\\) if and only if \\(e \\vDash dev_{e}(\\neg h)\\); \\(e\\)\nHempel-disconfirms \\(h\\) if and only if, for some \\(s \\in\n\\bL, e \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\) and \\(s \\vDash \\neg h\\);\nevidence \\(e\\) is Hempel-neutral for hypothesis \\(h\\)\notherwise.\n\n\n\nIn each of clauses (i) and (ii), Hempelian confirmation\n(disconfirmation, respectively) is a generalization of direct\nHempelian confirmation (disconfirmation). To retrieve the latter as a\nspecial case of the former, one only has to posit \\(s = h\\) \\((\\neg\nh\\), respectively, for disconfirmation).\n\nBy direct Hempelian confirmation, evidence statement \\(e\\) that, say,\nobject \\(a\\) is a white swan, \\(swan(a) \\wedge white(a)\\), confirms\nhypothesis \\(h\\) that all swans are white, \\(\\forall x(swan(x)\n\\rightarrow white(x))\\), because the former entails the\n\\(e\\)-development of the latter, that is, \\(swan(a) \\rightarrow\nwhite(a)\\). This is a desired result, according to Hempel\u2019s\nreading of Nicod. By (indirect) Hempelian confirmation, moreover,\n\\(swan(a) \\wedge white(a)\\) also confirms that a particular further\nobject \\(b\\) will be white, if it\u2019s a swan, i.e., \\(swan(b)\n\\rightarrow white(b)\\) (to see this, just set \\(s = \\forall x(swan(x)\n\\rightarrow white(x))\\)).\n\nThe second possibility considered by Nicod (\u201cthe\nabsence of \\(G\\) in a case of \\(F\\,\\)\u201d) can be\naccounted for by Hempelian disconfirmation. For the evidence statement\n\\(e\\) that \\(a\\) is a non-white swan\u2014\\(swan(a) \\wedge \\neg\nwhite(a)\\)\u2014entails (in fact, is identical to) the\n\\(e\\)-development of the hypothesis that there exist non-white\nswans\u2014\\(\\exists x(swan(x) \\wedge \\neg white(x))\\)\u2014which in\nturn is just the negation of \\(\\forall x(swan(x) \\rightarrow\nwhite(x))\\). So the latter is disconfirmed by the evidence in this\ncase. And finally, \\(e = swan(a) \\wedge \\neg white(a)\\) also\nHempel-disconfirms that a particular further object \\(b\\) will be\nwhite, if it\u2019s a swan, i.e., \\(swan(b) \\rightarrow white(b)\\),\nbecause the negation of the latter, \\(swan(b) \\wedge \\neg white(b)\\),\nis entailed by \\(s = \\forall x(swan(x) \\wedge \\neg white(x))\\) and \\(e\n\\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\).\n\nSo, to sum up, we have four illustrations of how Hempel\u2019s theory\narticulates Nicod\u2019s basic ideas, to wit:\n\n (the observation report of) a white swan (directly)\nHempel-confirms that all swans are white;\n (the observation report of) a white swan also Hempel-confirms\nthat a further swan will be white;\n (the observation report of) a non-white swan (directly)\nHempel-disconfirms that all swans are white;\n (the observation report of) a non-white swan also\nHempel-disconfirms that a further swan will be white.\n\n1.2 Two paradoxes and other difficulties\n\nThe ravens paradox (Hempel 1937, 1945). Consider the\nfollowing statements:\n\n(\\(h\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblack;\n(\\(e\\)) \\(raven(a)\n\\wedge black(a)\\), i.e., \\(a\\) is a black raven; \n(\\(e^*\\)) \\(\\neg\nblack(a^*) \\wedge \\neg raven(a^*)\\), i.e., \\(a^*\\) is a non-black\nnon-raven (say, a green apple).\n\n\nIs hypothesis \\(h\\) confirmed by \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) alike? That is, is\nthe claim that all ravens are black equally confirmed by the\nobservation of a black raven and by the observation of a non-black\nnon-raven (e.g., a green apple)? One would want to say no, but\nHempel\u2019s theory is unable to draw this distinction. Let\u2019s\nsee why.\n\nAs we know, \\(e\\) (directly) Hempel-confirms \\(h\\), according to\nHempel\u2019s reconstruction of Nicod. By the same token, \\(e^*\\)\n(directly) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all non-black objects\nare non-ravens, i.e., \\(h^* = \\forall x(\\neg black(x) \\rightarrow \\neg\nraven(x))\\). But \\(h^* \\vDash h\\) (\\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) are just\nlogically equivalent). So, \\(e^*\\) (the observation report of a\nnon-black non-raven), like \\(e\\) (black raven), does (indirectly)\nHempel-confirm \\(h\\) (all ravens are black). Indeed, as \\(\\neg\nraven(a)\\) entails \\(raven(a) \\rightarrow black(a)\\), it can be shown\nthat \\(h\\) is (directly) Hempel-confirmed by the observation of\nany object that is not a raven (an apple, a cat, a shoe),\napparently disclosing puzzling \u201cprospects for indoor\nornithology\u201d (Goodman 1955, 71).\n\n\\(Blite\\) (Goodman 1955). Consider the peculiar predicate\n\u201c\\(blite\\)\u201d, defined as follows: an object is blite just\nin case (i) it is black if examined at some moment \\(t\\) up to some\nfuture time \\(T\\) (say, the next expected appearance of Halley\u2019s\ncomet, in 2061) and (ii) it is white if examined afterwards. So we\nposit \\(blite(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge\n(\\neg ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow white(x))\\). Now consider the\nfollowing statements:\n\n(\\(h\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblack;\n(\\(h^*\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(raven(x) \\rightarrow blite(x))\\), i.e., all ravens are\nblite;\n(\\(e\\)) \\(e = raven(a)\n\\wedge ex_{t\\le T}(a) \\wedge black(a)\\), i.e., \\(a\\) is a raven\nobserved no later than \\(T\\) and it is black.\n\n\nDoes \\(e\\) confirm hypotheses \\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) alike? That is, does\nthe observation of a black raven before \\(T\\) confirms equally the\nclaim that all ravens are black as the claim that all ravens are\nblite? Here again, one would want to say no, but Hempel\u2019s theory\nis unable to draw the distinction. For one can check that the\n\\(e\\)-developments of \\(h\\) and \\(h^*\\) are both entailed by \\(e\\).\nThus, \\(e\\) (the report of a raven examined no later than \\(T\\) and\nfound to be black) does Hempel-confirm \\(h^*\\) (all ravens are blite)\njust as it confirms \\(h\\) (all ravens are black). Moreover, \\(e\\) also\nHempel-confirms the statement that a raven will be white if examined\nafter \\(T\\), because this is a logical consequence of \\(h^*\\) (which\nis directly Hempel-confirmed by \\(e\\)). And finally, suppose that\n\\(blurple(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge (\\neg\nex_{t\\le T}(x) \\rightarrow purple(x)).\\) We then have that the very\nsame evidence statement \\(e\\) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all\nravens are blurple, and thus also its implication that a raven will be\n\\(purple\\) if examined after \\(T\\)!\n\nA seemingly obvious idea, here, is that there must be something\ninherently wrong with predicates such as \\(blite\\) or \\(blurple\\) (and\nperhaps non-raven and non-black, too) and thus a\nprincipled way to rule them out as \u201cunnatural\u201d. Then one\ncould restrict confirmation theory accordingly, i.e., to\n\u201cnatural kinds\u201d only (see, e.g., Quine 1970). Yet this\npoint turns out be very difficult to pursue coherently and it has not\nborne much fruit in this discussion (Rinard 2014 is a recent\nexception). After all, for all we know, it is a perfectly\n\u201cnatural\u201d feature of a token of the \u201cnatural\nkind\u201d water that it is found in one physical state for\ntemperatures below 0 degrees Celsius and in an entirely different\nstate for temperatures above that threshold. So why should the time\nthreshold \\(T\\) in \\(blite\\) or \\(blurple\\) be a reason to dismiss\nthose predicates? (The water example comes from Howson 2000,\n31\u201332. See Schwartz 2011, 399 ff., for a more general assessment\nof this issue.)\n\nThe above, widely known \u201cparadoxes\u201d then suggest that\nHempel\u2019s analysis of confirmation is too liberal: it\nsanctions the existence of confirmation relations that are intuitively\nvery unsound (see Earman and Salmon 1992, 54, and Sprenger 2011a, 243,\nfor more on this). Yet the Hempelian notion of confirmation turns out\nto be very restrictive, too, on other accounts. For suppose that\nhypothesis \\(h\\) and evidence \\(e\\) do not share any piece of\nnon-logical vocabulary. \\(h\\) might be, say, Newton\u2019s law of\nuniversal gravitation (connecting force, distances and masses), while\n\\(e\\) could be the description of certain spots on a telescopic image.\nThroughout modern physics, significant relations of confirmation and\ndisconfirmation were taken to obtain between statements like these.\nIndeed, telescopic sightings have been crucial evidence for\nNewton\u2019s law as applied to celestial bodies. However, as their\nnon-logical vocabularies are disjoint, \\(e\\) and \\(h\\) must simply be\nlogically independent, and so must be \\(e\\) and \\(dev_{e}(h)\\) (with\nvery minor caveats, this follows from Craig\u2019s so-called\ninterpolation theorem, see Craig 1957). In such circumstances, there\ncan be nothing but Hempel-neutrality between evidence and hypothesis.\nSo Hempel\u2019s original theory seems to lack the resources to\ncapture a key feature of inductive inference in science as well as in\nseveral other domains, i.e., the kind of \u201cvertical\u201d\nrelationships of confirmation (and disconfirmation) between the\ndescription of observed phenomena and hypotheses concerning underlying\nstructures, causes, and processes.\n\nTo overcome the latter difficulty, Clark Glymour (1980a) embedded a\nrefined version of Hempelian confirmation by instances in his analysis\nof scientific reasoning. In Glymour\u2019s revision, hypothesis \\(h\\)\nis confirmed by some evidence \\(e\\) even if appropriate auxiliary\nhypotheses and assumptions must be involved for \\(e\\) to entail the\nrelevant instances of \\(h\\). This important theoretical move turns\nconfirmation into a three-place relation concerning the\nevidence, the target hypothesis, and (a conjunction of) auxiliaries.\nOriginally, Glymour presented his sophisticated neo-Hempelian approach\nin stark contrast with the competing traditional view of so-called\nhypothetico-deductivism (HD). Despite his explicit\nintentions, however, several commentators have pointed out that,\npartly because of the due recognition of the role of auxiliary\nassumptions, Glymour\u2019s proposal and HD end up being plagued by\nsimilar difficulties (see, e.g., Horwich 1983, Woodward 1983, and\nWorrall 1982). In the next section, we will discuss the HD framework\nfor confirmation and also compare it with Hempelian confirmation. It\nwill thus be convenient to have a suitable extended definition of the\nlatter, following the remarks above. Here is one that serves our\npurposes:\n\nHempelian confirmation (extended)\n\nFor any \\(h, e,k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(e\\) contains individual\nconstants only (no quantifier), \\(k = dev_{e}(\\alpha)\\) for some\n\\(\\alpha \\in \\bL\\) containing quantifiers only (no individual\nconstant) and such that \\(\\alpha \\not\\vDash h\\), and \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\nconsistent:\n\n\n \\(e\\) directly Hempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) if and only if \\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(h)\\); \\(e\\)\nHempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if and only\nif, for some \\(s \\in \\bL, e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\) and \\(s\\wedge\nk \\vDash h\\);\n\\(e\\) directly Hempel-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) if and only if \\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(\\neg h)\\);\n\\(e\\) Hempel-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if, for some \\(s\\in \\bL, e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(s)\\)a and\n\\(s\\wedge k \\vDash \\neg h\\);\n \\(e\\) is Hempel-neutral for \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) otherwise.\n\n\n\nOne can see that in the above definition the auxiliary assumptions in\n\\(k\\) are the \\(e\\)-development of further closed constant-free\nhypotheses (in fact, equations as applied to specific measured values,\nin typical examples from Glymour 1980a), where such hypotheses are\nmeant to be conjoined in a single statement (\\(\\alpha\\)) for\nconvenience. This implies that the only terms occurring\n(non-vacuously) in \\(k\\) are individual constants already occurring\n(non-vacuously) in \\(e\\). For an empty \\(\\alpha\\) (that is,\ntautologous: \\(\\alpha = \\top\\)), \\(k\\) must be empty too, and the\noriginal (restricted) definition of Hempelian confirmation applies. As\nfor the proviso that \\(\\alpha \\not\\vDash h\\), it rules out undesired\ncases of circularity\u2014akin to so-called \u201cmacho\u201d\nbootstrap confirmation, as discussed in Earman and Glymour 1988 (for\nmore on Glymour\u2019s theory and its developments, see Douven and\nMeijs 2006, and references therein).\n2. Hypothetico-deductivism\n\nThe central idea of hypothetico-deductive (HD) confirmation can be\nroughly described as \u201cdeduction-in-reverse\u201d: evidence is\nsaid to confirm a hypothesis in case the latter, while not entailed by\nthe former, is able to entail it, with the help of suitable auxiliary\nhypotheses and assumptions. The basic version (sometimes labelled\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d) of the HD notion of confirmation can be\nspelled out thus:\n\nHD-confirmation\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent:\n\n\n \\(e\\) HD-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\) and \\(k \\not\\vDash e\\);\n\\(e\\) HD-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash \\neg e\\), and \\(k \\not\\vDash \\neg\ne\\);\n\\(e\\) is HD-neutral for hypothesis \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) otherwise.\n\n\n\nNote that clause (ii) above represents HD-disconfirmation as plain\nlogical inconsistency of the target hypothesis with the data (given\nthe auxiliaries) (see Hempel 1945, 98).\n2.1 HD vs. Hempelian confirmation\n\nHD-confirmation and Hempelian confirmation convey different intuitions\n(see Huber 2008a for an original analysis). They are, in fact,\ndistinct and strictly incompatible notions. This will be effectively\nillustrated by the consideration of the following conditions.\n\nEntailment condition (EC)\n\nFor any \\(h,e,k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\wedge k\\) is consistent, \\(e\\wedge k\n\\vDash h\\) and \\(k \\not\\vDash h\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\).\n\nConfirmation complementarity (CC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\), \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(e\\) disconfirms \\(\\neg h\\) relative to \\(k\\).\n\nSpecial consequence condition (SCC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nand \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash h^*\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(h^*\\) relative to\n\\(k\\).\n\nOn the implicit proviso that \\(k\\) is empty (that is, tautologous: \\(k\n= \\top\\)), Hempel (1943, 1945) himself had put forward (EC) and (SCC)\nas compelling adequacy conditions for any theory of confirmation, and\ndevised his own proposal accordingly. As for (CC), he took it as a\nplain definitional truth (1943, 127). Moreover, Hempelian confirmation\n(extended) satisfies all conditions above (of course, for arguments\n\\(h\\), \\(e\\) and \\(k\\) for which it is defined). HD-confirmation, on\nthe contrary, violates all of them. Let us briefly discuss each one in\nturn.\n\nIt is rather common for a theory of ampliative (non-deductive)\nreasoning to retain classical logical entailment as a special case (a\nfeature sometimes called \u201csuper-classicality\u201d; see\nStrasser and Antonelli 2019). That\u2019s essentially what (EC)\nimplies for confirmation. Now given appropriate \\(e\\), \\(h\\) and\n\\(k\\), if \\(e\\wedge k\\) entails \\(h\\), we readily get that \\(e\\)\nHempel-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) in two simple steps. First,\ngiven that \\(e\\) and \\(k\\) are both quantifier-free, \\(dev_{e}(e\\wedge\nk) = e\\wedge k\\) according to Hempel\u2019s full definition of\n\\(dev\\) (see Hempel 1943, 131). Then it trivially follows that\n\\(e\\wedge k \\vDash dev_{e}(e\\wedge k)\\), so \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\n(directly) Hempel-confirmed and its logical consequence \\(h\\) is\nlikewise confirmed (indirectly). Logical entailment is thus retained\nas an instance of Hempelian confirmation in a fairly straightforward\nway. HD-confirmation, on the contrary, does not fulfil (EC). Here is\none odd example (see Sprenger 2011a, 234). With \\(k = \\top\\), just let\n\\(e\\) be the observation report that object \\(a\\) is a black swan,\n\\(swan(a) \\wedge black(a)\\), and \\(h\\) be the hypothesis that black\nswans exist, \\(\\exists x(swan(x) \\wedge black(x))\\). Evidence \\(e\\)\nverifies \\(h\\) conclusively, and yet it does not HD-confirm it, simply\nbecause \\(h \\not\\vDash e\\). So the observation of a black swan turns\nout to be HD-neutral for the hypothesis that black swans exist! The\nsame example shows how HD-confirmation violates (CC), too. In fact,\nwhile HD-neutral for \\(h\\), \\(e\\) HD-disconfirms its negation \\(\\neg\nh\\) that no swan is black, \\(\\forall x(swan(x) \\rightarrow \\neg\nblack(x))\\), because the latter is obviously inconsistent with\n(refuted by) \\(e\\).\n\nThe violation of (EC) and (CC) by HD-confirmation is arguably a reason\nfor concern, for those conditions seem highly plausible. The special\nconsequence condition (SCC), on the other hand, deserves separate and\ncareful consideration. As we will see later on, (SCC) is a strong\nconstraint, and far from sacrosanct. For now, let us point out one\nmajor philosophical motivation in its favor. (SCC) has often been\ninvoked as a means to ensure the fulfilment of the following condition\n(see, e.g., Hesse 1975, 88; Horwich 1983, 57):\n\nPredictive inference condition (PIC)\n\nFor any \\(e, k \\in \\bL\\), if \\(e\\) confirms \\(\\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow\nGx)\\) relative to \\(k\\), then \\(e\\) confirms \\(F(a) \\rightarrow G(a)\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\). \n\nIn fact, (PIC) readily follows from (SCC) and so it is satisfied by\nHempel\u2019s theory. It says that, if evidence \\(e\\) confirms\n\u201call \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\)s\u201d, then it also confirms that a\nfurther object will be \\(G\\), if it is \\(F\\). Notably, this does not\nhold for HD-confirmation. Here is why. Given \\(k = Fa\\) (i.e., the\nassumption that \\(a\\) comes from the \\(F\\) population), we have that\n\\(e = Ga\\) HD-confirms \\(h = \\forall x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\), because\nthe latter entails the former (given \\(k\\)). (That\u2019s the HD\nreconstruction of Nicod\u2019s insight, see below.) We also have, of\ncourse, that \\(h\\) entails \\(h^* = Fb \\rightarrow Gb\\). And yet,\ncontrary to (PIC), since \\(h^*\\) does not entail \\(e\\) (given \\(k\\)),\nit is not HD-confirmed by it either. The troubling conclusion is that\nthe observation that a swan is white (or that a million of them are,\nfor that matters) does not HD-confirm the prediction that a further\nswan will be found to be white.\n2.2 Back to black (ravens)\n\nOne attractive feature of HD-confirmation is that it largely eludes\nthe ravens paradox. As the hypothesis \\(h\\) that all ravens are black\ndoes not entail that some generally sampled object \\(a\\) will be a\nblack raven, the HD view of confirmation is not committed to the\neminently Hempelian implication that \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge black(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\). Likewise, \\(\\neg black(a) \\wedge \\neg raven(a)\\) does\nnot HD-confirm that all non-black objects are non-raven. The\nderivation of the paradox, as presented above, is thus blocked.\n\nIndeed, HD-confirmation yields a substantially different reading of\nNicod\u2019s insight as compared to Hempel\u2019s theory (Okasha\n2011 has an important discussion of this distinction). Here is how it\ngoes. If object \\(a\\) is assumed to have been taken among\nravens\u2014so that, crucially, the auxiliary assumption \\(k =\nraven(a)\\) is made\u2014and \\(a\\) is checked for color and found to\nbe black, then, yes, the latter evidence, \\(black(a)\\), HD-confirms\nthat all ravens are black \\((h)\\) relative to \\(k\\). By the same\ntoken, \\(\\neg black(a)\\) HD-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to the same\nassumption \\(k = raven(a)\\). And, again, this is as it should be, in\nline with Nicod\u2019s mention of \u201cthe absence of \\(G\\) [here,\nnon-black as evidence] in a case of \\(F\\) [here, raven as an auxiliary\nassumption]\u201d. It is also true that an object that is found\nnot to be a raven HD-confirms \\(h\\), but only\nrelative to \\(k = \\neg black(a)\\), that is, if \\(a\\) is assumed to\nhave been taken among non-black objects to begin with; and this seems\nacceptable too (after all, while sampling from non-black objects, one\nmight have found the counterinstance of a raven, but didn\u2019t).\nUnlike Hempel\u2019s theory, moreover, HD-confirmation does not yield\nthe debatable implication that, by itself (that is, given \\(k =\n\\top\\)), the observation of a non-raven \\(a\\), \\(\\neg raven(a)\\), must\nconfirm \\(h\\).\n\nInterestingly, the introduction of auxiliary hypotheses and\nassumptions shows that the issues surrounding Nicod\u2019s remarks\ncan become surprisingly subtle. Consider the following statements\n(Maher\u2019s 2006 example):\n\n(\\(\\alpha_1\\)) \\(\\forall\nx(white(x) \\rightarrow \\neg black(x))\\)\n\n(\\(\\alpha_2\\)) \n\\(\\exists x(swan(x)) \\rightarrow \\exists y(swan(y) \\wedge black(y))\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha_1\\) simply specifies that no object is both white and black,\nwhile \\(\\alpha_2\\) says that, if there are swans at all, then there\nalso is some black swan. Also posit, again, \\(e = swan(a)\n\\wedge white(a)\\). Under \\(\\alpha_1\\) and \\(\\alpha_2\\), the\nobservation of a white swan clearly disconfirms (indeed,\nrefutes) the hypothesis \\(h\\) that all swans are white. Hempel\u2019s\ntheory (extended) faces difficulties here, because for \\(k =\ndev_{e}(\\alpha_1 \\wedge \\alpha_2)\\) it turns out that \\(e\\wedge k\\) is\ninconsistent. But HD-confirmation gets this case right, thus capturing\nappropriate boundary conditions for Nicod\u2019s generally sensible\nclaims. For, with \\(k = \\alpha_1 \\wedge \\alpha_2\\), one has that\n\\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent and entails \\(\\neg e\\) (for it entails\nthat no swan exists), so that \\(e\\) HD-disconfirms (refutes) \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) (see Good 1967 for another famous counterexample to\nNicod\u2019s condition).\n\nHD-confirmation, however, is also known to suffer from distinctive\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d implications. One of the most frustrating is\nsurely the following (see Osherson, Smith, and Shafir 1986, 206, for\nfurther specific problems).\n\nThe irrelevant conjunction paradox. Suppose that \\(e\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) relative to (possibly empty) \\(k\\). Let statement \\(q\\)\nbe logically consistent with \\(e\\wedge h\\wedge k\\), but otherwise\nentirely irrelevant for all of those conjuncts (perhaps belonging to a\ncompletely separate domain of inquiry). Does \\(e\\) confirm \\(h\\wedge\nq\\) (relative to \\(k\\)) as it does with \\(h\\)? One would want to say\nno, and this implication can be suitably reconstructed in\nHempel\u2019s theory. HD-confirmation, on the contrary, can not draw\nthis distinction: it is easy to show that, on the conditions\nspecified, if the HD clause for confirmation is satisfied for \\(e\\)\nand \\(h\\) (given \\(k\\)), so it is for \\(e\\) and \\(h\\wedge q\\) (given\n\\(k\\)). (This is simply because, if \\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), then\n\\(h\\wedge q\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), too, by the monotonicity of classical\nlogical entailment.)\n\nKuipers (2000, 25) suggested that one can live with the irrelevant\nconjunction problem because, on the conditions specified, \\(e\\) would\nstill not HD-confirm \\(q\\) alone (given \\(k\\)), so that\nHD-confirmation can be \u201clocalized\u201d: \\(h\\) is the only bit\nof the conjunction \\(h\\wedge q\\) that gets any confirmation on its\nown, as it were. Other authors have been reluctant to bite the bullet\nand have engaged in technical refinements of the\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d HD view. In these proposals, the spread of\nHD-confirmation upon frivolous conjunctions can be blocked at the\nexpense of some additional logical machinery (see Gemes 1993, 1998;\nSchurz 1991, 1994).\n\nFinally, it should be noted that HD-confirmation offers no substantial\nrelief from the blite paradox. On the one hand, \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge\nex_{t\\le T}(a) \\wedge black(a)\\) does not, as such,\nHD-confirm either \\(h = \\forall x(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\) or\n\\(h^* = \\forall x(raven(x) \\rightarrow blite(x))\\), that is, for empty\n\\(k\\). On the other hand, if object \\(a\\) is assumed to have been\nsampled from ravens before \\(T\\) (that is, given \\(k = raven(a) \\wedge\nex_{t\\le T}(a))\\), then \\(black(a)\\) is entailed by both \u201call\nravens are black\u201d and \u201call ravens are blite\u201d and\ntherefore HD-confirms each of them. So HD-confirmation, too, sanctions\nthe existence of confirmation relations that seem intuitively unsound\n(indeed, indefinitely many of them: as we know, other variations of\n\\(h^*\\) can be conceived at will, like the \u201cblurple\u201d hypothesis).\nOne could insist that HD does handle the blite paradox after all,\nbecause \\(black(a)\\) (given \\(k\\) as above) does not HD-confirms that\na raven will be white if examined after \\(T\\) (Kuipers 2000, 29 ff.).\nUnfortunately (as pointed out by Schurz 2005, 148) \\(black(a)\\) does\nnot HD-confirm that a raven will be black if examined after \\(T\\)\neither (again, given \\(k\\) as above). That\u2019s because, as already\npointed out, HD-confirmation fails the predictive inference condition\n(PIC) in general. So, all in all, HD-confirmation can not tell black\nfrom blite any more than Hempel-confirmation can.\n2.3 Underdetermination and the Duhemian challenge\n\nThe issues above look contrived and artificial to some people\u2019s\ntaste\u2014even among philosophers. Many have suggested a closer look\nat real-world inferential practices in the sciences as a more\nappropriate benchmark for assessment. For one thing, the very idea of\nhypothetico-deductivism has often been said to stem from the origins\nof Western science. As reported by Simplicius of Cilicia (sixth\ncentury A.D.) in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nCaelo, Plato had challenged his pupils to identify combinations\nof \u201cordered\u201d motions by which one could account for\n(namely, deduce) the planets\u2019 wandering trajectories across the\nheavens as observed by the Earth. As a matter of historical fact,\nmathematical astronomy has engaged in just this task for centuries:\nscholars have been trying to define geometrical models from which the\napparent motion of celestial bodies would derive.\n\nIt is fair to say that, at its roots, the kind of challenges that the\nHD framework faces with scientific reasoning is not so different from\nthe main puzzles that arise from philosophical considerations of a\nmore formal kind. Still, the two areas turn out to be complementary in\nimportant ways. The following statement will serve as a useful\nstarting point to extend the scope of our discussion.\n\nUnderdetermination Theorem (UT) for\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d HD-confirmation\nFor any contingent \\(h, e \\in \\bL\\), if \\(h\\) and \\(e\\) are logically\nconsistent, there exists some \\(k \\in \\bL\\) such that \\(e\\)\nHD-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\). \n\n(UT) is an elementary logical fact that has been long recognized (see,\ne.g., Glymour 1980a, 36). In purely formal terms, just positing \\(k =\nh \\rightarrow e\\) will do for a proof. To appreciate how (UT) can\nspark any philosophical interest, one has to combine it with some\ninsightful remarks first put forward by Pierre Duhem (1906) and then\nfamously revived by Quine (1951) in a more radical style. (Indeed,\n(UT) essentially amounts to the \u201centailment version\u201d of\n\u201cQuinean underdetermination\u201d in Laudan 1990, 274.)\n\nDuhem (he himself a supporter of the HD view) pointed out that in\nmature sciences such as physics most hypotheses or theories of real\ninterest can not be contradicted by any statement describing\nobservable states of affairs. Taken in isolation, they simply do not\nlogically imply, nor rule out, any observable fact, essentially\nbecause (unlike \u201call ravens are black\u201d) they involve the\nmention of unobservable entities and processes. So, in effect, Duhem\nemphasized that, typically, scientific hypotheses or theories\nare logically consistent with any piece of checkable\nevidence. Unless, of course, the logical connection is underpinned by\nauxiliary hypotheses and assumptions suitably bridging the gap between\nthe observational and non-observational vocabulary, as it were. But\nthen, once auxiliaries are in play, logic alone guarantees that\nsome \\(k\\) exists such that \\(h\\wedge k\\) is consistent,\n\\(h\\wedge k \\vDash e\\), and \\(k \\not\\vDash e\\), so that confirmation\nholds in na\u00efve HD terms (that\u2019s just the UT result above).\nApparently, when Duhem\u2019s point applies, the uncritical supporter\nof whatever hypothesis \\(h\\) can legitimately claim (na\u00efve HD)\nconfirmation from any \\(e\\) by simply shaping \\(k\\) conveniently. In\nthis sense, hypothesis assessment would be radically\n\u201cunderdetermined\u201d by any amount of evidence practically\navailable.\n\nInfluential authors such as Thomas Kuhn (1962/1970) (but see Laudan\n1990, 268, for a more extensive survey) relied on Duhemian insights to\nsuggest that confirmation by empirical evidence is too weak a force to\ndrive the evaluation of theories in science, often inviting\nconclusions of a relativistic flavor (see Worrall 1996 for an\nilluminating reconstruction along these lines). Let us briefly\nconsider a classical case, which Duhem himself thoroughly analyzed:\nthe wave vs. particle theories of light in modern optics.\nAcross the decades, wave theorists were able to deduce an impressive\nlist of important empirical facts from their main hypothesis along\nwith appropriate auxiliaries, diffraction phenomena being only one\nmajor example. But many particle theorists\u2019 reaction was to\nretain their hypothesis nonetheless and to reshape other\nparts of the \u201ctheoretical maze\u201d (i.e., \\(k\\); the term is\nPopper\u2019s, 1963, p. 330) to recover those observed facts as\nconsequences of their own proposal. And as we\u2019ve seen,\nif the bare logic of na\u00efve HD was to be taken strictly,\nsurely they could have claimed their overall hypothesis to be\nconfirmed too, just as much as their opponents.\n\nImportantly, they didn\u2019t. In fact, it was quite clear that\nparticle theorists, unlike their wave-theory opponents, were striving\nto remedy weaknesses rather than scoring successes (see Worrall 1990).\nBut why, then? Because, as Duhem himself clearly realized, the logic\nof na\u00efve HD \u201cis not the only rule for our judgments\u201d\n(1906, 217). The lesson of (UT) and the Duhemian insight is not quite,\nit seems, that na\u00efve HD is the last word and scientific inference\nis unconstrained by stringent rational principles, but rather that the\nHD view has to be strengthened in order to capture the real nature of\nevidential support in rational scientific inference. At least,\nthat\u2019s the position of a good deal of philosophers of science\nworking within the HD framework broadly construed. It has even been\nmaintained that \u201cno serious twentieth-century\nmethodologist\u201d has ever subscribed to the na\u00efve HD view\nabove \u201cwithout crucial qualifications\u201d (Laudan 1990, 278;\nalso see Laudan and Leplin 1991, 466).\n\nSo the HD approach to confirmation has yielded a number of more\narticulated variants to meet the challenge of underdetermination.\nFollowing (loosely) Norton (2005), we will now survey an instructive\nsample of them.\n2.4 The extended HD menu\n\nNa\u00efve HD can be enriched by a resolute form of\npredictivism. According to this approach, the na\u00efve HD\nclause for confirmation is too weak because \\(e\\) must have been\npredicted in advance from \\(h\\wedge k\\). Karl Popper\u2019s\n(1934/1959) account of the \u201ccorroboration\u201d of hypotheses\nfamously embedded this view, but squarely predictivist stances can be\ntraced back to early modern thinkers like Christiaan Huygens\n(1629\u20131695) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716), and\nin Duhem\u2019s work itself. The predictivist sets a high bar for\nconfirmation. Her favorite examples typically include stunning\nepisodes in which the existence of previously unknown objects,\nphenomena, or whole classes of them is anticipated: the phases of\nVenus for Copernican astronomy or the discovery of Neptune for\nNewtonian physics, all the way up to the Higgs boson for so-called\nstandard model of subatomic particles.\n\nThe predictivist solution to the underdetermination problem is fairly\nradical: many of the relevant factual consequences of \\(h\\wedge k\\)\nwill be already known when this theory is articulated, and so unfit\nfor confirmation. Critics have objected that predictivism is in fact\nfar too restrictive. There seem to be many cases in which already\nknown phenomena clearly do provide support to a new hypothesis or\ntheory. Zahar (1973) first raised this problem of \u201cold\nevidence\u201d, then made famous by Glymour (1980a, 85 ff.) as a\ndifficulty for Bayesianism (see\n Section 3\n below). Examples of this kind abound in the history of science as\nelsewhere, but the textbook illustration has become the precession of\nMercury\u2019s perihelion, a lasting anomaly for Newtonian physics:\nEinstein\u2019s general relativity calculations got this long-known\nfact right, thereby gaining a remarkable piece of initial support for\nthe new theory. In addition to this problem with old evidence, HD\npredictivism also seems to lack a principled rationale. After all, the\ntemporal order of the discovery of \\(e\\) and of the articulation of\n\\(h\\) and \\(k\\) may well be an entirely accidental historical\ncontingency. Why should it bear on the confirmation relationship among\nthem? (See Giere 1983 and Musgrave 1974 for classical discussions of\nthese issues. Douglas and Magnus 2013 and Barnes 2018 offer more\nrecent views and rich lists of further references.)\n\nAs a possible response to the difficulties above, na\u00efve HD can be\nenriched by the use-novelty criterion (UN) instead. The UN\nreaction to the underdetermination problem is more conservative than\nthe temporal predictivist strategy. According to this view, to improve\non the weak na\u00efve HD clause for confirmation one only has to rule\nout one particular class of cases, i.e., those in which the\ndescription of a known fact, \\(e\\), served as a constraint in the\nconstruction of \\(h\\wedge k\\). The UN view thus comes equipped with a\nrationale. If \\(h\\wedge k\\) was shaped on the basis of \\(e\\), UN\nadvocates point out, then it was bound to get that state of affairs\nright; the theory never ran any risk of failure, thus did not achieve\nany particularly significant success either. Precisely in these cases,\nand just for this reason, the evidence \\(e\\) must not be\ndouble-counted: by using it for the construction of the theory, its\nconfirmational power becomes \u201cdried out\u201d, so to speak.\n\nThe UN completion of na\u00efve HD originated from Lakatos and some of\nhis collaborators (see Lakatos and Zahar 1975 and Worrall 1978; also\nsee Giere 1979, 161\u2013162, and Gillies 1989 for similar views),\nalthough important hints in the same direction can be found at least\nin the work of William Whewell (1840/1847). Consider the touchstone\nexample of Mercury again. According to Zahar (1973), Einstein did not\nneed to rely on the Mercury data to define theory and auxiliaries as\nto match observationally correct values for the perihelion precession\n(also see Norton 2011a; and Earman and Janssen 1993 for a very\ndetailed, and more nuanced, account). Being already known, the fact\nwas not of course predicted in a strictly temporal sense, and yet, on\nZahar\u2019s reading, it could have been: it was\n\u201cuse-novel\u201d and thus fresh for use to confirm the theory.\nFor a more mundane illustration, so-called cross-validation\ntechniques represent a routine application of the UN idea in\nstatistical settings (as pointed out by Schurz 2014, 92; also see\nForster 2007, 592 ff.). According to some commentators, however, the\nUN criterion needs further elaboration (see Hitchcock and Sober 2004\nand Lipton 2005), while others have criticized it as essentially\nwrong-headed (see Howson 1990 and Mayo 1991, 2014; also see Votsis\n2014). \n\nYet another way to enrich na\u00efve HD is to combine it with\neliminativism. According to this view, the na\u00efve HD\nclause for confirmation is too weak because there must have been a low\n(enough) objective chance of getting the outcome \\(e\\) (favorable to\n\\(h\\)) if \\(h\\) was false, so that few possibilities exist that \\(e\\)\nmay have occurred for some reason other than the truth of \\(h\\).\nBriefly put, the occurrence of \\(e\\) must be such that most\nalternatives to \\(h\\) can be safely ruled out. The founding figure of\neliminativism is Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626). John Stuart Mill\n(1843/1872) is a major representative in later times, and Deborah\nMayo\u2019s \u201cerror-statistical\u201d approach to hypothesis\ntesting arguably develops this tradition (Mayo 1996 and Mayo and\nSpanos 2010; see Bird 2010, Kitcher 1993, 219 ff., and Meehl 1990 for\nother contemporary variations).\n\nEliminativism is most credible when experimentation is at issue (see,\ne.g., Guala 2012). Indeed, the appeal to Bacon\u2019s idea of\ncrucial experiment (instantia crucis) and related\nnotions (e.g., \u201csevere testing\u201d) is a fairly reliable mark\nof eliminativist inclinations. Experimentation is, to a large extent,\nprecisely an array of techniques to keep undesired interfering factors\nat a minimum by active manipulation and deliberate control (think of\nthe blinding procedure in medical trials, with \\(h\\) the hypothesized\neffectiveness of a novel treatment and \\(e\\) a relative improvement in\nclinical endpoints for a target subsample of patients thus treated).\nWhen this kind of control obtains, popular statistical tools are\nsupposed to allow for the calculation of the probability of \\(e\\) in\ncase \\(h\\) is false meant as a \u201crelative frequency in a (real or\nhypothetical) series of test applications\u201d (Mayo 1991, 529), and\nto secure a sufficiently low value to validate the positive outcome of\nthe test. It is much less clear how firm a grip this approach can\nretain when inference takes place at higher levels of generality and\ntheoretical commitment, where the hypothesis space is typically much\ntoo poorly ordered to fit routine error-statistical analyses. Indeed,\nLaudan (1997, 315; also see Musgrave 2010) spotted in this approach\nthe risk of a \u201cbalkanization\u201d of scientific reasoning,\nnamely, a restricted focus on scattered pieces of experimental\ninference (but see Mayo 2010 for a defense). \n\nNa\u00efve HD can also be enriched by the notion of\nsimplicity. According to this view, the na\u00efve HD clause\nfor confirmation is too weak because \\(h\\wedge k\\) must be a simple\n(enough), unified way to account for evidence \\(e\\). A classic\nreference for the simplicity view is Newton\u2019s first law of\nphilosophizing in the Principia (\u201cadmit no more causes\nof natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain\ntheir appearances\u201d), echoing very closely Ockham\u2019s razor.\nThis basic idea has never lost its appeal\u2014even up to recent\ntimes (see, e.g., Quine and Ullian 1970, 69 ff.; Sober 1975; Zellner,\nKeuzenkamp, and McAleer 2002; Scorzato 2013).\n\nDespite Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1957, 181) suggestions to the contrary,\nthe success of Copernican astronomy over Ptolemy\u2019s system has\nremained an influential case study fostering the simplicity view\n(Martens 2009). Moreover, in ordinary scientific problems such as\ncurve fitting, formal criteria of model selection are applied\nwhere the paucity of parameters can be interpreted naturally as a key\ndimension of simplicity (Forster and Sober 1994). Traditionally, two\nmain problems have proven pressing, and frustrating, for the\nsimplicity approach. First, how to provide a sufficiently coherent and\nilluminating explication of this multifaceted and elusive notion (see\nRiesch 2010); and second, how to justify the role of simplicity as a\nproperly epistemic (rather than merely pragmatic)\nvirtue (see Kelly 2007, 2008).\n\nFinally, na\u00efve HD can be enriched by the appeal to\nexplanation. Here, the na\u00efve HD clause for confirmation\nis meant to be too weak because \\(h\\wedge k\\) must be able (not only\nto entail, but) to explain \\(e\\). By this move, the HD approach embeds\nthe slogan of the so-called inference to the best explanation\nview: \u201cobservations support the hypothesis precisely because it\nwould explain them\u201d (Lipton 2000, 185; also see Lipton 2004).\nHistorically, the main source for this connection between explanation\nand support is found in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce\n(1839\u20131914). Janssen (2003) offers a particularly neat\ncontemporary exhibit, explicitly aimed at \u201ccuring cases of the\nDuhem-Quine disease\u201d (484; also see Thagard 1978, and Douven\n2017 for a relevant survey). Quite unlike eliminativist approaches,\nexplanationist analyses tend to focus on large-scale theories and\nrelatively high-level kinds of evidence. Dealing with Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral relativity, for instance, Janssen (2003) greatly emphasizes\nits explanation of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass\n(essentially a brute fact in Newtonian physics) over the resolution of\nthe puzzle of Mercury\u2019s perihelion. Explanationist accounts are\nalso distinctively well-equipped to address inference patterns from\nnon-experimental sciences (Cleland 2011). \n\nThe problems faced by these approaches are similar to those affecting\nthe simplicity view. Agreement is still lacking on the nature of\nscientific explanation (see Woodward 2019) and it is not clear how far\nan explanationist variant of HD can go without a sound analysis of\nthat notion. Moreover, some critics have wondered why the relationship\nof confirmation should be affected by an explanatory connection with\nthe evidence per se (see Salmon 2001).\n\nThe above discussion does not display an exhaustive list (nor are the\nlisted options mutually exclusive, for that matter: see, e.g., Baker\n2003; also see Worrall 2010 for some overlapping implications in an\napplied setting of real practical value). And our sketched\npresentation hardly allows for any conclusive assessment. It does\nsuggest, however, that reports of the death of hypothetico-deductivism\n(see Earman 1992, 64, and Glymour 1980b) might have been exaggerated.\nFor all its difficulties, HD has proven fairly resilient at least as a\nbasic framework to elucidate some key aspects of how hypotheses can be\nconfirmed by the evidence (see Betz 2013, Gemes 2005, and Sprenger\n2011b for consonant points of view).\n3. Bayesian confirmation theories\n\nBayes\u2019s theorem is a very central element of the\nprobability calculus (see Joyce 2019). For historical reasons,\nBayesian has become a standard label to allude to a range of\napproaches and positions sharing the common idea that probability (in\nits modern, mathematical sense) plays a crucial role in rational\nbelief, inference, and behavior. According to Bayesian epistemologists\nand philosophers of science, (i) rational agents have credences\ndiffering in strength, which moreover (ii) satisfy the probability\naxioms, and can thus be represented in probabilistic form. (In\nnon-Bayesian models (ii) is rejected, but (i) may well be retained:\nsee Huber and Schmidt-Petri 2009, Levi 2008, and Spohn 2012.)\nWell-known arguments exist in favor of this position (see, e.g.,\nEaswaran 2011a; Pettigrew 2016; Skyrms 1987; Vineberg 2016), although\nthere is no lack of difficulties and criticism (see, e.g., Easwaran\n2011b; H\u00e1jek 2008; Kelly and Glymour 2004; Norton 2011b).\n\nBeyond the core ideas above, however, the theoretical landscape of\nBayesianism is quite as hopelessly diverse as it is fertile. Surveys\nand state of art presentations are already numerous, and ostensibly\ngrowing (see, e.g., Good 1971; Joyce 2011; Oaksford and Chater 2007;\nSprenger and Hartmann 2020; Weisberg 2015). For the present purposes,\nattention can be restricted to a classification that is still fairly\ncoarse-grained, and based on just two dimensions or criteria.\n\nFirst, there is a distinction between permissivism and\nimpermissivism (see Meacham 2014 and Kopec and Titelbaum 2016\nfor this terminology). For permissive Bayesians (often otherwise\nlabelled \u201csubjectivists\u201d), accordance with the probability\naxioms is the only clear-cut constraint on the credences of a rational\nagent. In impermissive forms of Bayesianism (often otherwise called\n\u201cobjective\u201d), further constraints are put forward that\nsignificantly restrict the range of rational credences, possibly up to\none single \u201cright\u201d probability function in any given\nsetting. Second, there are different attitudes towards so-called\nprinciple of total evidence (TE) for the credences on which a\nreasoner relies. TE Bayesians maintain that the relevant credences\nshould be represented by a probability function \\(P\\) which conveys\nthe totality of what is known to the agent. For non-TE approaches,\ndepending on the circumstances, \\(P\\) may (or should) be set up so\nthat portions of the evidence available are in fact bracketed.\n(Unsurprisingly, further subtleties arise as soon as one delves a bit\nfurther into the precise meaning and scope of TE; see Fitelson 2008\nand Williamson 2002, Chs. 9\u201310, for important discussions.)\n\nOf course, many intermediate positions exist between extreme forms of\npermissivism and impermissivism so outlined, and more or less the same\napplies for the TE issue. The above distinctions are surely rough\nenough, but useful nonetheless. Impermissive TE Bayesianism has served\nas a received view in early Bayesian philosophy of science (e.g.,\nCarnap 1950/1962). But impermissivism is easily found in combination\nwith non-TE positions, too (see, e.g., Maher 1996). TE permissivism\nseems a good approximation of De Finetti\u2019s (2008) stance, while\nnon-TE permissivism is arguably close to a standard view nowadays\n(see, e.g., Howson and Urbach 2006). No more than this will be needed\nto begin our exploration of Bayesian confirmation theories.\n3.1 Probabilistic confirmation as firmness\n\nLet us posit a set \\(\\bP\\) of probability functions representing\npossible states of belief about a domain that is described in a finite\nlanguage \\(L\\) with \\(\\bL\\) the set of its closed sentences. From now\non, unless otherwise specified, whenever considering some \\(h, e, k\n\\in \\bL\\) and \\(P \\in \\bP\\), we will invariably rely on the following\nprovisos:\n\n both \\(e\\wedge k\\) and \\(h\\wedge k\\) are consistent;\n \\(P(e\\wedge k), P(h\\wedge k) \\gt 0;\\)\n \\(P(k) \\gt P(h\\wedge k)\\) (unless \\(k \\vDash h\\));\n \\(P(e\\wedge k) \\gt P(e\\wedge h\\wedge k)\\) (unless \\(e\\wedge k\n\\vDash h\\)); and\n \\(P(e\\wedge h\\wedge k) \\gt 0\\), as long as \\(e\\wedge h\\wedge k\\)\nis consistent.\n\n\n(These assumptions are convenient and critical for technical reasons,\nbut not entirely innocent. Festa 1999 and Kuipers 2000, 44 ff.,\ndiscuss some limiting cases that are left aside here owing to these\nconstraints.)\n\nA probabilistic theory of confirmation can be spelled out through the\ndefinition of a function \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k): \\{\\bL^3 \\times \\bP\\}\n\\rightarrow \\Re\\) representing the degree of confirmation that\nhypothesis \\(h\\) receives from evidence \\(e\\) relative to \\(k\\) and\nprobability function \\(P\\). \\(C_{P}(h,e\\mid k)\\) will then have\nrelevant probabilities as its building blocks, according to the\nfollowing basic postulate of probabilistic confirmation:\n\n(P0) Formality\n\nThere exists a function \\(g\\) such that, for any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\)\nand any \\(P \\in \\bP\\), \\(C_{P}(h,e\\mid k) = g[P(h\\wedge e\\mid\nk),P(h\\mid k),P(e\\mid k)]\\). \n\nNote that the probability distribution over the algebra generated by\n\\(h\\) and \\(e\\), conditional on \\(k\\), is entirely determined by\n\\(P(h\\wedge e\\mid k)\\), \\(P(h\\mid k)\\) and \\(P(e\\mid k)\\). Hence, (P0)\nsimply states that \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) depends on that distribution,\nand nothing else. (The label for this assumption is taken from\nTentori, Crupi, and Osherson 2007, 2010.)\n\nHempelian and HD confirmation, as discussed above, are\nqualitative theories of confirmation. They only tell us\nwhether evidence \\(e\\) confirms (disconfirms) hypothesis\n\\(h\\) given \\(k\\). However, assessments of the amount of\nsupport that some evidence brings to a hypothesis are commonly\ninvolved in scientific reasoning, as well as in other domains, if only\nin the form of comparative judgments such as\n\u201chypothesis \\(h\\) is more strongly confirmed by \\(e_{1}\\) than\nby \\(e_{2}\\)\u201d or \u201c\\(e\\) confirms \\(h_{1}\\) to a greater\nextent than \\(h_{2}\\)\u201d. Consider, for instance, the following\nprinciple, a veritable cornerstone of probabilistic confirmation in\nall of its variations (see Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013 for a list\nof references):\n\n(P1) Final probability\n\nFor any \\(h,e_{1},e_{2},k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\),\n\\(C_{P}(h,e_{1}\\mid k) \\gtreqless C_{P}(h, e_{2}\\mid k)\\) if and only\nif \\(P(h\\mid e_{1} \\wedge k) \\gtreqless P(h\\mid e_{2} \\wedge k).\\)\n\n\n(P1) is itself a comparative, or ordinal, principle, stating\nthat, for any fixed hypothesis \\(h\\), the final (or posterior)\nprobability and confirmation always move in the same direction in the\nlight of data, \\(e\\) (given \\(k\\)). Interestingly, (P0) and (P1) are\nalready sufficient to single out one traditional class of measures of\nprobabilistic confirmation, if conjoined with the following (see Crupi\nand Tentori 2016, 656, Schippers 2017, and also T\u00f6rnebohm 1966,\n81):\n\n(P2) Local equivalence\n\nFor any \\(h_{1},h_{2},e,k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP\\), if \\(h_{1}\\)\nand \\(h_{2}\\) are logically equivalent given \\(e\\) and \\(k\\), then\n\\(C_{P}(h_{1},e\\mid k) = C_{P}(h_{2}, e\\mid k).\\) \n\nThe following can then be shown:\n\nTheorem 1\n\n(P0), (P1) and (P2) hold if and only if there exists a strictly\nincreasing function \\(f\\) such that, for any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) and\nany \\(P \\in \\bP\\), \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = f[P(h\\mid e\\wedge k)]\\). \n\nTheorem 1 provides a simple axiomatic characterization of the class of\nconfirmation functions that are strictly increasing with the final\nprobability of the hypothesis given the evidence (and \\(k\\)) (proven\nin Schippers 2017). All the functions in this class are ordinally\nequivalent, meaning that they imply the same rank order of\n\\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) and \\(C_{P^*}(h^*,e^*\\mid k^*)\\) for any \\(h,\nh^*,e, e^*,k, k^* \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P, P^* \\in \\bP.\\)\n\nBy (P0), (P1) and (P2), we thus have \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = f[P(h\\mid e\n\\wedge k)]\\), implying that the more likely \\(h\\) is given the\nevidence the more it is confirmed. This approach explicates\nconfirmation precisely as the overall credibility of a\nhypothesis (firmness is Carnap\u2019s 1950/1962 telling\nterm, xvi). In this view, \u201cBayesian confirmation theory is\nlittle more than the examination of [the] properties\u201d of the\nposterior probability function (Howson 2000, 179).\n\nAs we will see, the ordinal level of analysis is a solid and\nconvenient middleground between a purely qualitative and a thoroughly\nquantitative (metric) notion of confirmation. To begin with, ordinal\nnotions are in general sufficient to move \u201cupwards\u201d to the\nqualitative level as follows:\n\nQualitative confirmation from ordinal relations (QC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\):\n\n\n\\(e\\) \\(C_{P}\\)-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nif and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) \\gt C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid k);\\)\n\\(e\\) \\(C_{P}\\)-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) \\lt C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid\nk);\\)\n\\(e\\) is \\(C_{P}\\)-neutral for \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid\nk).\\)\n\n\n\nGiven Theorem 1, (P0), (P1) and (P2) can be combined with the\ndefinitions in (QC) to derive the following qualitative notion of\nprobabilistic confirmation as firmness:\n\nConfirmation as firmness (\\(F\\)-confirmation,\nqualitative)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\):\n\n\n\\(e\\) \\(F\\)-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) if\nand only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) \\gt \\bfrac{1}{2};\\) \n\\(e\\) \\(F\\)-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nif and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) \\lt \\bfrac{1}{2};\\)\n\\(e\\) is \\(F\\)-neutral for \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k\\) if and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) =\n\\bfrac{1}{2}.\\)\n\n\n\nThe point of qualitative \\(F\\)-confirmation is thus straightforward:\n\\(h\\) is said to be (dis)confirmed by \\(e\\) (given \\(k\\)) if it is\nmore likely than not to be true (false). (Sometimes a threshold higher\nthan a probability \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) is identified, but this\ncomplication would add little for our present purposes.)\n\nThe ordinal notion of confirmation is of high theoretical significance\nbecause ordinal divergences, unlike purely quantitative differences,\nimply opposite comparative judgments for some evidence-hypothesis\npairs. A refinement from the ordinal to a properly quantitative level\nis also be of interest, however, and much useful for tractability and\napplications. For example, one can have 0 as a convenient neutrality\nthreshold for confirmation as firmness, provided that the following\nfunctional representation is adopted (see Peirce 1878 for an early\noccurrence): \\begin{align} F(h,e\\mid k) & =\n\\log\\left[\\frac{P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)}{P(\\neg h\\mid e \\wedge k)}\\right]\n\\\\ & = \\log Odds(h\\mid e \\wedge k) \\end{align}\n\n\n(The base of the logarithm can be chosen at convenience, as long as it\nis strictly greater than 1.)\n\nA quantitative requirement that is often put forward is the following\nstringent form of additivity:\n\nStrict additivity (SA)\n\nFor any \\(h, e_{1},e_{2},k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\),\n  \\(\\ \\ \\ C_{P}(h, e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}\\mid k) = C_{P}(h, e_{1}\\mid k) +\nC_{P}(h, e_{2}\\mid e_{1} \\wedge k).\\) \n\nAlthough extraneous to \\(F\\)-confirmation, Strict Additivity will\nprove of use later on for the discussion of further variants of\nBayesian confirmation theory.\n3.2 Strengths and infirmities of firmness\n\nConfirmation as firmness shares a number of structural properties with\nHempelian confirmation. It satisfies the Special Consequence\nCondition, thus the Predictive Inference Condition too. It satisfies\nthe Entailment Condition and, in virtue of (P1), extends it smoothly\nto the following ordinal counterpart:\n\nEntailment condition (ordinal extension) (EC-Ord)\n\nFor any \\(h, e_{1},e_{2},k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\) such that\n\\(k \\not\\vDash h\\):\n\n\n if, \\(e_{1}\\wedge k \\vDash h\\) and \\(e_{2}\\wedge k \\not\\vDash\nh\\), then \\(h\\) is more confirmed by \\(e_{1}\\) than by \\(e_{2}\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\), that is, \\(C_{P}(h, e_{1}\\mid k) \\gt C_{P}(h,\ne_{2}\\mid k);\\)\nif, \\(e_{1}\\wedge k\\vDash h\\) and \\(e_{2}\\wedge k\\vDash h,\\) then\n\\(h\\) is equally confirmed by \\(e_{1}\\) and by \\(e_{2}\\) relative to\n\\(k\\), that is, \\(C_{P}(h, e_{1}\\mid k) = C_{P}(h, e_{2}\\mid\nk).\\)\n\n\n\nAccording to (EC-Ord) not only is classical entailment retained as a\ncase of confirmation, it also represents a limiting case: it is the\nstrongest possible form of confirmation that a fixed hypothesis \\(h\\)\ncan receive.\n\n\\(F\\)-confirmation also satisfies Confirmation Complementarity and,\nmoreover, extends it to its appealing ordinal counterpart (see Crupi,\nFesta, and Buttasi 2010, 85\u201386), that is:\n\nConfirmation complementarity (ordinal extension)\n(CC-Ord)\n\n\\(C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid k)\\) is a strictly decreasing function of\n\\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\), that is, for any \\(h, h^*,e, e^*,k \\in \\bL\\)\nand any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\gtreqless C_{P}(h^*,e^*\\mid\nk)\\) if and only if \\(C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid k) \\lesseqgtr C_{P}(\\neg\nh^*,e^*\\mid k).\\) \n\n(CC-Ord) neatly reflects Keynes\u2019 (1921, 80) remark that\n\u201can argument is always as near to proving or disproving a\nproposition, as it is to disproving or proving its\ncontradictory\u201d. Indeed, quantitatively, the measure \\(F(h, e\\mid\nk)\\) instantiates Confirmation Complementarity in a simple and elegant\nway, that is, it satisfies \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = -C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid\nk).\\)\n\n\\(F\\)-confirmation also implies another attractive quantitative\nresult, alleviating the ailments of the irrelevant conjunction\nparadox. In the statement below, indicating this result, the\nirrelevance of \\(q\\) for hypothesis \\(h\\) and evidence \\(e\\)\n(relative to \\(k\\)) is meant to amount to the probabilistic\nindependence of \\(q\\) from \\(h, e\\) and their conjunction (given\n\\(k\\)), that is, to \\(P(h \\wedge q\\mid k) = P(h\\mid k)P(q\\mid k),\\)\n\\(P(e \\wedge q\\mid k) = P(e\\mid k)P(q\\mid k)\\), and \\(P(h \\wedge e\n\\wedge q\\mid k) = P(h \\wedge e\\mid k)P(q\\mid k)\\), respectively.\n\n\nConfirmation upon irrelevant conjunction (ordinal\nsolution) (CIC)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, q, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP,\\) if \\(e\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\) and \\(q\\) is irrelevant for \\(h\\) and\n\\(e\\) relative to \\(k\\), then\n \\(\\ \\ \\ C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) \\gt C_{P}(h \\wedge q, e\\mid k).\\) \n\n\nSo, even in case it is qualitatively preserved across the tacking of\n\\(q\\) onto \\(h\\), the positive confirmation afforded by \\(e\\) is at\nleast bound to quantitatively decrease thereby.\n\nPartly because of appealing formal features such as those mentioned so\nfar, there is a long list of distinguished scholars advocating the\nfirmness view of confirmation, from Keynes (1921) and\nHosiasson-Lindenbaum (1940) onwards, most often coupled with some form\nof impermissive Bayesianism (see Hawthorne 2011 and Williamson 2011\nfor contemporary variations). In fact, \\(F\\)-confirmation fits most\nneatly a classical form of TE impermissivism \u00e0 la\nCarnap, where one assumes that \\(k = \\top,\\) that \\(P\\) is an\n\u201cobjective\u201d initial probability based on essentially\nlogical considerations, and that all the non-logical information\navailable is collected in \\(e\\). The spirit of the Carnapian project\nnever lost its appeal entirely (see, e.g., Festa 2003, Franklin 2001,\nMaher 2010, Paris 2011). However, the idea of a \u201clogical\u201d\ninterpretation of \\(P\\) got stuck into difficulties that are often\nseen as insurmountable (e.g., Earman and Salmon 1992, 85\u201389;\nGillies 2000, Ch. 3; H\u00e1jek 2019; Howson and Urbach 2006,\n59\u201372; van Fraassen 1989, Ch. 12; Zabell 2011). And arguably,\nlacking some robust and effective impermissivist policy, the account\nof confirmation as firmness ends up loosing much of its philosophical\nmomentum. The issues surrounding the ravens and blite paradoxes\nprovide a useful illustration.\n\nConsider again \\(h = \\forall x(raven(x) \\rightarrow black(x))\\), and\nthe main analyses of \u201cthe observation that \\(a\\) is a black\nraven\u201d encountered so far, that is: \n\n \\(k = \\top\\) and \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge black(a)\\), and\n \\(k = raven(a)\\) and \\(e = black(a).\\) \n\n\nIn both cases, whether \\(e\\) \\(F\\)-confirms \\(h\\) or not (relative to\n\\(k\\)) critically depends on \\(P\\): if the prior \\(P(h\\mid k)\\) is low\nenough, \\(e\\) won\u2019t do no matter what under either (i) or (ii);\nand if it is high enough, \\(h\\) will be \\(F\\)-confirmed either way. As\na consequence, the \\(F\\)-confirmation view, by itself, does not offer\nany definite hint as to when, how, and why Nicod\u2019s remarks apply\nor not.\n\nFor the purposes of our discussion, the following condition reveals\nanother debatable aspect of the firmness explication of\nconfirmation.\n\nConsistency condition (Cons)\n\nFor any \\(h, h^*,e, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP\\), if \\(k \\vDash\n\\neg(h\\wedge h^*)\\) then \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\) given \\(k\\) if and only\nif \\(e\\) disconfirms \\(h^*\\) given \\(k\\). \n\n(Cons) says that evidence \\(e\\) can never confirm incompatible\nhypotheses. But consider, by way of illustration, a clinical case of\nan infectious disease of unknown origin, and suppose that \\(e\\) is the\nfailure of antibiotic treatment. Arguably, there is nothing wrong in\nsaying that, by discrediting bacteria as possible causes, the evidence\nconfirms (viz. provides some support for) any of a number of\nalternative viral diagnoses. This judgment clashes with (Cons),\nthough, which then seems an overly strong constraint.\n\nNotably, (Cons) was defended by Hempel (1945) and, in fact, one can\nshow that it follows from the conjunction of (qualitative)\nConfirmation Complementary and the Special Consequence Condition, and\nso from both Hempelian and \\(F\\)-confirmation. This is but one sign of\nhow stringent the Special Consequence Condition is. Mainly because of\nthe latter, both the Hempelian and the firmness views of confirmation\nmust depart from the plausible HD idea that hypotheses are generally\nconfirmed by their verified consequences (see Hempel 1945,\n103\u2013104). We will come back to this while discussing our next\ntopic: a very different Bayesian explication of confirmation, based on\nthe notion of probabilistic relevance.\n3.3 Probabilistic relevance confirmation\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that the firmness notion of probabilistic\nconfirmation can be singled out through one ordinal constraint, (P2),\nin addition to the fundamental principles (P0)\u2013(P1). The\ncounterpart condition for the so-called relevance notion of\nprobabilistic confirmation is the following:\n\n(P3) Tautological evidence\n\nFor any \\(h_{1},h_{2},k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP\\),\n\\(C_{P}(h_{1},\\top \\mid k) = C_{P}(h_{2},\\top \\mid k).\\) \n\n(P3) implies that any hypothesis is equally \u201cconfirmed\u201d by\nempty evidence. We will say that \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) represents the\nprobabilistic relevance notion of confirmation, or\nrelevance-confirmation, if and only if it satisfies (P0), (P1) and\n(P3). These conditions are sufficient to derive the following, purely\nqualitative principle, according to the definitional method in (QC)\nabove (see Crupi and Tentori 2014, 82, and Crupi 2015).\n\nProbabilistic relevance confirmation (qualitative)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP:\\)\n\n\n\\(e\\) relevance-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\)\nif and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\gt P(h\\mid k);\\)\n\\(e\\) relevance-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\lt P(h\\mid k);\\)\n\\(e\\) is relevance-neutral for \\(h\\) relative to\n\\(k\\) if and only if \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) = P(h\\mid k).\\)\n\n\n\nThe point of relevance confirmation is that the credibility of a\nhypothesis can be changed in either a positive (confirmation\nin a strict sense) or negative way (disconfirmation) by the evidence\nconcerned (given \\(k\\)). Confirmation (in the strict sense) thus\nreflects an increase from initial to final probability, whereas\ndisconfirmation reflects a decrease (see Achinstein 2005 for some\ndiverging views on this very idea).\n\nThe qualitative notions of confirmation as firmness and as relevance\nare demonstrably distinct. Unlike firmness, relevance confirmation can\nnot be formalized by the final probability alone, or any increasing\nfunction thereof. To illustrate, the probability of an otherwise very\nrare disease \\((h)\\) can be quite low even after a relevant positive\ntest result \\((e)\\); yet \\(h\\) is relevance-confirmed by \\(e\\) to the\nextent that its probability rises thereby. By the same token, the\nprobability of the absence of the disease \\((\\neg h)\\) can be quite\nhigh despite the positive test result \\((e)\\), yet \\(\\neg h\\) is\nrelevance-disconfirmed by \\(e\\) to the extent that its probability\ndecreases thereby. Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between\nfirmness and relevance confirmation\u2014\u201cextremely\nfundamental\u201d and yet \u201csometimes unnoticed\u201d, as\nSalmon (1969, 48\u201349) put it\u2014had to be stressed time and\nagain to achieve theoretical clarity in philosophy (e.g., Popper 1954;\nPeijnenburg 2012) as well as in other domains concerned, such as\nartificial intelligence and the psychology of reasoning (see Horvitz\nand Heckerman 1986; Crupi, Fitelson, and Tentori 2008; Shogenji\n2012).\n\nThe qualitative notion of relevance confirmation already has some\ninteresting consequences. It implies, for instance, the following\nremarkable fact:\n\nComplementary Evidence (CompE)\n\nFor any \\(h, e, k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) if and only if \\(\\neg e\\) disconfirms \\(h\\) relative\nto \\(k.\\) \n\nThe importance of (CompE) can be illustrated as follows. Consider the\ncase of a father suspected of abusing his son. Suppose that the child\ndoes claim that s/he has been abused (label this evidence \\(e\\)). A\nforensic psychiatrist, when consulted, declares that this confirms\nguilt \\((h)\\). Alternatively, suppose that the child is asked and does\nnot report having been abused \\((\\neg e).\\) As pointed out by\nDawes (2001), it may well happen that a forensic psychiatrist will\nnonetheless interpret this as evidence confirming guilt\n(suggesting that violence has prompted the child\u2019s denial). One\nmight want to argue that, other things being equal, this kind of\n\u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d judgment would be\ninconsistent, and thus in principle untenable. Whoever concurs with\nthis line of argument (as Dawes 2001 himself did) is likely to be\nrelying on the relevance notion of confirmation. In fact, no other\nnotion of confirmation considered so far provides a general foundation\nfor this judgment. \\(F\\)-confirmation, in particular, would not do,\nfor it does allow that both \\(e\\) and \\(\\neg e\\) confirm \\(h\\)\n(relative to \\(k\\)). This is because, mathematically, it is perfectly\npossible for both \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\) and \\(P(h\\mid \\neg e \\wedge\nk)\\) to be arbitrarily high above \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}.\\) Condition (CompE),\non the contrary, ensures that only one between the\ncomplementary statements \\(e\\) and \\(\\neg e\\) can confirm hypothesis\n\\(h\\) (relative to \\(k\\)). (To be precise, HD-confirmation also\nsatisfies condition CompE, yet it would fail the above example all the\nsame, although for a different reason, that is, because the connection\nbetween \\(h\\) and \\(e\\) is plausibly one of probabilistic dependence\nbut not of logical entailment.)\n\nRemarks such as the foregoing have induced some contemporary Bayesian\ntheorists to dismiss the notion of confirmation as firmness\naltogether, concluding with I.J. Good (1968, 134) that \u201cif you\nhad \\(P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)\\) close to unity, but less than \\(P(h\\mid\nk)\\), you ought not to say that \\(h\\) was confirmed by\n\\(e\\)\u201d (also see Salmon 1975, 13). Let us follow this suggestion\nand proceed to consider the ordinal (and quantitative) notions of\nrelevance confirmation.\n3.4 Differences, ratios, and partial entailment\n\nJust as with firmness, the ordinal analysis of relevance confirmation\ncan be characterized axiomatically. With the relevance notion,\nhowever, a larger set of options arises. Consider the following\nprinciples.\n\n\n(P4) Disjunction of alternative hypotheses\n\nFor any \\(e, h_{1},h_{2},k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) if \\(k\\vDash\n\\neg (h_{1} \\wedge h_{2})\\), then \\(C_{P}(h_{1},e\\mid k) \\gtreqless\nC_{P}(h_{1} \\vee h_{2},e\\mid k)\\) if and only if \\(P(h_{2}\\mid e\n\\wedge k)\\gtreqless P(h_{2}\\mid k).\\) \n\n\n\n(P5) Law of likelihood\n\nFor any \\(e, h_{1}, h_{2}, k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\)\n\\(C_{P}(h_{1}, e\\mid k)\\gtreqless C_{P}(h_{2}, e\\mid k)\\) if and only\nif \\(P(e\\mid h_{1} \\wedge k)\\gtreqless P(e\\mid h_{2} \\wedge k).\\) \n\n\n\n(P6) Modularity (for conditionally independent data)\n\nFor any \\(e_{1},e_{2},h, k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) if\n\\(P(e_{1}\\mid \\pm h \\wedge e_{2} \\wedge k)=P(e_{1}\\mid \\pm h \\wedge\nk),\\) then \\(C_{P}(h, e_{1}\\mid e_{2} \\wedge k) = C_{P}(h, e_{1}\\mid\nk).\\) \n\n\nAll the above conditions occur more or less widely in the literature\n(see Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013 and Crupi and Tentori 2016 for\nreferences and discussion). Interestingly, they\u2019re all pairwise\nincompatible on the background of the Formality and the Final\nProbability principles (P0 and P1 above). Indeed, they sort out the\nrelevance notion of confirmation into three distinct, classical\nfamilies of measures, as follows (Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013;\nCrupi and Tentori 2016; Heckerman 1988; Sprenger and Hartmann 2020,\nCh. 1):\n\nTheorem 2\n\nGiven (P0) and (P1):\n\n\n(P4) holds if and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) is a\nprobability difference measure, that is, if there exists a\nstrictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that, for any \\(h, e, k\\in\n\\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = f[P(h\\mid e \\wedge\nk) - P(h\\mid k)];\\)\n(P5) holds if and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) is a\nprobability ratio measure, that is, if there exists a\nstrictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that, for any \\(h, e, k\\in\n\\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) =f[\\frac{P(h\\mid e\n\\wedge k)}{P(h\\mid k)}];\\)\n(P6) holds if and only if \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) is a\nlikelihood ratio measure, that is, if there exists a strictly\nincreasing function \\(f\\) such that, for any \\(h, e, k\\in \\bL\\) and\nany \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) =f[\\frac{P(e\\mid h \\wedge\nk)}{P(e\\mid \\neg h \\wedge k)}].\\)\n\n\n\nIf a strictly additive behavior (SA above) is imposed, one functional\nform is singled out for the quantitative representation of\nconfirmation corresponding to each of the clauses above:\n\n\\(D_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) - P(h\\mid k);\\)\n\\(R_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = \\log[\\frac{P(h\\mid e \\wedge k)}{P(h\\mid\nk)}];\\)\n\\(L_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = \\log[\\frac{P(e\\mid h \\wedge k)}{P(e\\mid \\neg\nh \\wedge k)}].\\)\n\n\n(The bases of the logarithms are assumed to be strictly greater than\n1.)\n\nBefore discussing briefly this set of alternative quantitative\nmeasures of relevance confirmation, we will address one further\nrelated issue. It is a long-standing idea, going back to Carnap at\nleast, that confirmation theory should yield an inductive\nlogic that is analogous to classical deductive logic in some\nsuitable sense, thus providing a theory of partial entailment, and\npartial refutation. Now, the deductive-logical notions of entailment\nand refutation (contradiction) exhibit the following well-known\nproperties:\n\n\nContraposition of entailment\n\nEntailment is contrapositive, but not commutative. That is, it holds\nthat \\(e\\) entails \\(h\\) \\((e\\vDash h)\\) if and only if \\(\\neg h\\)\nentails \\(\\neg e\\) \\((\\neg h\\vDash \\neg e),\\) while it does not hold\nthat \\(e\\) entails \\(h\\) if and only if \\(h\\) entails \\(e\\) \\((h\\vDash\ne).\\)\n\nCommutativity of refutation\n\nRefutation, on the contrary, is commutative, but not contrapositive.\nThat is, it holds that \\(e\\) refutes \\(h\\) \\((e\\vDash \\neg h)\\) if and\nonly if \\(h\\) refutes \\(e\\) \\((h\\vDash \\neg e)\\), while it does not\nhold that \\(e\\) refutes \\(h\\) if and only if \\(\\neg h\\) refutes \\(\\neg\ne\\) \\((\\neg h \\vDash \\neg\\neg e).\\)\n\n\nThe confirmation-theoretic counterparts are fairly\nstraightforward:\n\n\n(P7) Contraposition of confirmation\n\nFor any \\(e, h, k\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) if \\(e\\)\nrelevance-confirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k,\\) then \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) =\nC_{P}(\\neg e,\\neg h\\mid k).\\)\n\n(P8) Commutativity of disconfirmation\n\nFor any \\(e, h, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P \\in \\bP,\\) if \\(e\\)\nrelevance-disconfirms \\(h\\) relative to \\(k\\), then \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid\nk) = C_{P}(e, h\\mid k).\\)\n\n\nThe following can then be proven (Crupi and Tentori 2013):\n\nTheorem 3\n\nGiven (P0) and (P1), (P7) and (P8) hold if and only if \\(C_{P}(h,\ne\\mid k)\\) is a relative distance measure, that is, if there\nexists a strictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that, for any \\(h, e,\nk\\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP,\\) \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = f[Z(h, e\\mid\nk)],\\) where:\n\n\\( Z(h,e\\mid k)= \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) - P(h\\mid\nk)}{1-P(h\\mid k)} & \\mbox{if } P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) \\ge P(h\\mid k)\n\\\\ \\\\ \\dfrac{P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) - P(h\\mid k)}{P(h\\mid k)} &\n\\mbox{if } P(h\\mid e \\wedge k) \\lt P(h\\mid k) \\end{cases} \\) \n\n\nSo, despite some pessimistic suggestions (see, e.g., Hawthorne 2018,\nand the discussion in Crupi and Tentori 2013), a neat\nconfirmation-theoretic generalization of logical entailment (and\nrefutation) is possible after all. Interestingly, relative distance\nmeasures can be additive, but only for uniform pairs\nof arguments \u2013 both confirmatory or both disconfirmatory (see\nMilne 2014, p. 259). (Note: Crupi, Tentori, and Gonzalez 2007; Crupi,\nFesta, and Buttasi 2010; and Crupi and Tentori 2013, 2014, provide\nfurther discussions of the properties of relative distance measures\nand their intuitive motivations. Also see Mura 2008 for a related\nanalysis.)\n\nThe plurality of alternative probabilistic measures of relevance\nconfirmation has prompted some scholars to be skeptical or dismissive\nof the prospects for a quantitative theory of confirmation (see, e.g.,\nHowson 2000, 184\u2013185, and Kyburg and Teng 2001, 98 ff.).\nHowever, as we will see shortly, quantitative analyses of relevance\nconfirmation have proved important for handling a number of puzzles\nand issues that plagued competing approaches. Moreover, various\narguments in the philosophy of science and beyond have been shown to\ndepend critically (and sometimes unwittingly) on the choice of one\nconfirmation measure (or some of them) rather than others (see Festa\nand Cevolani 2017, Fitelson 1999, Br\u00f6ssel 2013, Glass 2013, Roche\nand Shogenji 2014, Rusconi et al. 2014, and van Enk\n2014).\n\nRecently, arguments have been offered by Huber (2008b) in favor of\n\\(D\\), by Park (2014), Pruss (2014), and Vassend (2015) in favor of\n\\(L\\) (also see Morey, Romeijn, and Rouder 2016 for an important\nconnection with statistics), and by Crupi and Tentori (2010) in favor\nof \\(Z\\). H\u00e1jek and Joyce (2008, 123), on the other hand, have\nseen different measures as possibly capturing \u201cdistinct,\ncomplementary notions of evidential support\u201d (also see\nSchlosshauer and Wheeler 2011, Sprenger and Hartmann 2020, Ch.1, and\nSteel 2007 for tempered forms of pluralism). The case of measure \\(R\\)\ndeserves some more specific comments, however. Following Fitelson\n(2007), one could see \\(R\\) as conveying key tenets of so-called\n\u201clikelihoodist\u201d position about evidential reasoning (see\nRoyall 1997 for a classical statement, and Chandler 2013 and Sober\n1990 for consonant arguments and inclinations). There seems to be some\nconsensus, however, that compelling objections can be raised against\nthe adequacy of \\(R\\) as a proper measure of relevance confirmation\n(see, in particular, Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 85\u201386;\nEells and Fitelson 2002; Gillies 1986, 112; and compare Milne 1996\nwith Milne 2010, Other Internet Resources). In what follows, too, it\nwill be convenient to restrict our discussion to \\(D, L\\) and \\(Z\\) as\ncandidate measures. All the results to be presented below are\ninvariant for whatever choice among these three options, and across\nordinal equivalence with each of them (but those results do\nnot always extend to measures ordinally equivalent to\n\\(R\\)).\n3.5 New evidence, old evidence, and total evidence\n\nLet us go back to a classical HD case, where the (consistent)\nconjunction \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not \\(k\\) alone) entails \\(e.\\) The\nfollowing can be proven:\n\nSurprising prediction theorem (SP)\n\nFor any \\(e, h, k \\in \\bL\\) and any \\(P\\in \\bP\\) such that \\(h \\wedge\nk\\vDash e\\) and \\(k\\not\\vDash e:\\)\n\n\nif \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1,\\) then \\(e\\) relevance-confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) and \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) is a decreasing function\nof \\(P(e\\mid k);\\)\nif \\(P(e\\mid k) = 1,\\) then \\(e\\) is relevance-neutral for \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k.\\)\n\n\n\nFormally, it is fairly simple to show that (SP) characterizes\nrelevance confirmation (see, e.g., Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 80;\nH\u00e1jek and Joyce 2008, 123), but the philosophical import of\nthis result is nonetheless remarkable. For illustrative purposes, it\nis useful to assume the endorsement of the principle of total evidence\n(TE) as a default position for the Bayesian. This means that \\(P\\) is\nassumed to represent actual degrees of belief of a rational\nagent, that is, given all the background information available. Then,\nby clause (i) of (SP), we have that the occurrence of \\(e\\), a\nconsequence of \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not of \\(k\\) alone), confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\) provided that \\(e\\) was initially uncertain\nto some degree (even given \\(k\\)). In other words: \\(e\\) must have\nbeen predicted on the basis of \\(h \\wedge k\\). Moreover, again by\n(i), the confirmatory impact will be stronger the more surprising\n(unlikely) the evidence was unless \\(h\\) was conjoined to \\(k\\). So,\nunder TE, relevance confirmation turns out to embed a squarely\npredictivist version of hypothetico-deductivism! As we know, this\nneutralizes the charge of underdetermination, yet it comes at the\nusual cost, namely, the old evidence problem. In fact, if TE is in\nforce, then clause (ii) of (SP) implies that no statement that is\nknown to be true (thus assigned probability 1) can ever have\nconfirmatory import. \n\nInterestingly, the Bayesian predictivist has an escape (neatly\nanticipated, and criticized, by Glymour 1980a, 91\u201392). Consider\nEinstein and Mercury once again. As effectively pointed out by Norton\n(2011a, 7), Einstein was extremely careful to emphasize that the\nprecession phenomenon had been derived \u201cwithout having to\nposit any special [auxiliary] hypotheses at\nall\u201d. Why? Well, presumably because if one had allowed\nherself to arbitrarily devise ad hoc auxiliaries (within\n\\(k\\), in our notation) then one could have been pretty much certain\nin advance to find a way to get Mercury\u2019s data right (remember:\nthat\u2019s the lesson of the underdetermination theorem). But\ngetting those data right with auxiliaries \\(k\\) that were not thus\nadjusted\u2014that would have been a natural consequence had\nthe theory of general relativity been true and it would have been\nsurprising otherwise. Arguably, this line of argument exploits\nmuch of the use-novelty idea within a predictivist framework. The\ncrucial points are (i) that the evidence implied is not a verified\nempirical statement \\(e\\) but the logical fact that \\(h \\wedge k\\)\nentails \\(e\\), and (ii) that the existence of this connection of\nentailment was not to be obviously anticipated at all, precisely\nbecause \\(h \\wedge k\\) and \\(e\\) are such that the latter did not\nserve as a constraint to specify the former. On these conditions, it\nseems that \\(h\\) can be confirmed by this kind of\n\u201csecond-order\u201d (logical) evidence in line with (SP)\nwhile TE is concurrently preserved.\n\nAt least two main problems arise, however. The first one is more\ntechnical in nature. Modelling rational uncertainty concerning logical\nfacts (such as \\(h \\wedge k \\vDash e\\)) by probabilistic means is no\ntrivial task. Garber (1983) put forward an influential proposal, but\ndoubts have been raised that it might not be well-behaved (e.g., van\nFraassen 1988; a careful survey with further references can be found\nin Eva and Hartmann forthcoming). Second, and more substantially, this\nsolution of the old evidence problem can be charged of being an\nelusive change of the subject: for it was Mercury\u2019s\ndata, not anything else, that had to be recovered as having\nconfirmed (and still confirming, some would add) Einstein\u2019s\ntheory. That\u2019s the kind of judgment that confirmation theory\nmust capture, and which remains unattainable for the predictivist\nBayesian. (Earman 1992, 131 voiced this complaint forcefully. Hints\nfor a possible rejoinder appear in Eells\u2019s 1990 thorough\ndiscussion; see also Skyrms 1983.)\n\nBayesians that are unconvinced by the predictivist position are\nnaturally led to dismiss TE and allow for the assignment of initial\nprobabilities lower than 1 even to statements that were known all\nalong. Of course, this brings the underdetermination problem back, for\nnow \\(k\\) can still be concocted ad hoc to have known\nevidence \\(e\\) following from \\(h \\wedge k\\) and moreover\n\\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\) is not prevented by TE anymore, thus potentially\nlicencing arbitrary confirmation relations. Two moves can be combined\nto handle this problem. First, unlike HD, the Bayesian framework has\nthe formal resources to characterize the auxiliaries themselves as\nmore or less likely and thus their adoption as relatively safe or\nsuspicious (the standard Bayesian treatment of auxiliary hypotheses is\ndeveloped along these lines in Dorling 1979 and Howson and Urbach\n2006, 92\u2013102, and it is critically discussed in Rowbottom 2010,\nStrevens 2001, and Worrall 1993; also see Christensen 1997 for an\nimportant analysis of related issues). Second, one has to provide\nindications as to how TE should be relaxed. Non-TE Bayesians of the\nimpermissivist strand often suggest that objective likelihood values\nconcerning the outcome \\(e\\)\u2014\\(P(e\\mid h \\wedge k)\\)\u2014can\nbe specified for the competing hypotheses at issue quite apart from\nthe fact that \\(e\\) may have already occurred. Such values would\ntypically be diverse for different hypotheses (thus mathematically\nimplying \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\)) and serve as a basis to capture formally\nthe confirmatory impact of \\(e\\) (see Hawthorne 2005 for an argument\nalong these lines). Permissivists, on the other hand, can not\ncoherently rely on these considerations to articulate a non-TE\nposition. They must invoke counterfactual degrees of belief\ninstead, suggesting that \\(P\\) should be reconstructed as representing\nthe beliefs that the agent would have, had she not known that \\(e\\)\nwas true (see Howson 1991 for a statement and discussion, and Sprenger\n2015 for an original recent variant; also see Jeffrey 1995 and Wagner\n2001 for relevant technical results, and Steele and Werndl 2013 for an\nintriguing case-study from climate science).\n3.6 Paradoxes probabilified and other elucidations\n\nThe theory of Bayesian confirmation as relevance indicates when and\nwhy the HD idea works: if \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not \\(k\\)) entails\n\\(e\\), then \\(h\\) is relevance-confirmed by \\(e\\) (relative to \\(k\\))\nbecause the latter increases the probability of the\nformer\u2014provided that \\(P(e\\mid k) \\lt 1\\). Admittedly,\nthe meaning of the latter proviso partly depends on how one handles\nthe problem of old evidence. Yet it seems legitimate to say that\nBayesian relevance confirmation (unlike the firmness view)\nretains a key point of ordinary scientific practice which is embedded\nin HD and yields further elements of clarification. Consider the\nfollowing illustration.\n\n\\((e_{1})\\) tigers\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((e_{2})\\) elephants\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((e_{2}^*)\\) lions\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((h)\\) all mammals\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\n\nQualitative confirmation theories comply with the idea that \\(h\\) is\nconfirmed both by \\(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}\\) and by \\(e_{1} \\wedge\ne_{2}^*.\\) In the HD case, it is clear that \\(h\\) entails both\nconjunctions, given of course \\(k\\) stating that tigers, lions, and\nelephants are all mammals (an Hempelian account could also be given\neasily). Bayesian relevance confirmation unequivocally yields the same\nqualitative verdict. There is more, however. Presumably, one might\nalso want to say that \\(h\\) is more strongly confirmed by \\(e_{1}\n\\wedge e_{2}\\) than by \\(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*,\\) because the former\noffers a more varied and diverse body of positive evidence\n(interestingly, on experimental investigation, this pattern prevails\nin most people\u2019s judgment, including children, see Lo et al.\n2002). Indeed, the variety of evidence is a fairly central issue in\nthe analysis of confirmation (see, e.g., Bovens and Hartmann 2002,\nSchlosshauer and Wheeler 2011, and Viale and Osherson 2000). In the\nillustrative case above, higher variety is readily captured by lower\nprobability: it just seems a priori less likely that species\nas diverse as tigers and elephants share some unspecified genetic\ntrait as compared to tigers and lions, that is, \\(P(e_{1} \\wedge\ne_{2}\\mid k)\\lt P(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*\\mid k).\\) By (SP) above, then,\none immediately gets from the relevance confirmation view the sound\nimplication that \\(C_{P}(h, e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}\\mid k)\\gt C_{P}(h,\ne_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*\\mid k).\\)\n\nPrinciple (SP) is also of much use in the ravens problem. Posit \\(h =\n\\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow black(x))\\) once again. Just as HD,\nBayesian relevance confirmation directly implies that \\(e = black(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) given \\(k = raven(a)\\) and \\(e^* =\\neg raven(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) given \\(k^* =\\neg black(a)\\) (provided, as we know,\nthat \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\) and \\(P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\lt 1).\\) That\u2019s\nbecause \\(h \\wedge k\\vDash e\\) and \\(h \\wedge k^*\\vDash e^*.\\) But of\ncourse, to have \\(h\\) confirmed, sampling ravens and finding a black\none is intuitively more significant than failing to find a raven while\nsampling the enormous set of the non-black objects. That is, it seems,\nbecause the latter is very likely to obtain anyway, whether or not\n\\(h\\) is true, so that \\(P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\) is actually quite close to\nunity. Accordingly, (SP) implies that \\(h\\) is indeed more strongly\nconfirmed by \\(black(a)\\) given \\(raven(a)\\) than it is by \\(\\neg\nraven(a)\\) given \\(\\neg black(a)\\)\u2014that is, \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid\nk)\\gt C_{P}(h, e^*\\mid k^*)\\)\u2014as long as the assumption\n\\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\) applies. \n\nWhat then if the sampling in not constrained \\((k = \\top)\\) and the\nevidence now amounts to the finding of a black raven, \\(e = raven(a)\n\\wedge black(a)\\), versus a non-black non-raven, \\(e^* =\\neg black(a)\n\\wedge \\neg raven(a)\\)? We\u2019ve already seen that, for either\nHempelian or HD-confirmation, \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) are on a par: both\nHempel-confirm \\(h\\), none HD-confirms it. In the former case, the\noriginal Hempelian version of the ravens paradox immediately arises;\nin the latter, it is avoided, but at a cost: \\(e\\) is declared flatly\nirrelevant for \\(h\\)\u2014a bit of a radical move. Can the Bayesian\ndo any better? Quite so. Consider the following conditions:\n\n \\(P[raven(a)\\mid h] = P[raven(a)] \\gt 0\\) \n \\(P[\\neg raven(a) \\wedge black(a)\\mid h] = P[\\neg raven(a) \\wedge\nblack(a)]\\)\n\n\nRoughly, (i) says that the size of the ravens population does not\ndepend on their color (in fact, on \\(h\\)), and (ii) that the size of\nthe population of black non-raven objects also does not\ndepend on the color of ravens. Note that both (i) and (ii) seem fairly\nsound as far as our best understanding of our actual world is\nconcerned. It is easy to show that, in relevance-confirmation terms,\n(i) and (ii) are sufficient to imply that \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge\nblack(a)\\), but not \\(e^* = \\neg raven(a) \\wedge \\neg\nblack(a)\\), confirms \\(h\\), that is \\(C_{P}(h,e) \\gt C_{P}(h,e^*) =\n0\\) (this observation is due to Mat Coakley). So the Bayesian\nrelevance approach to confirmation can make a principled difference\nbetween \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) in both ordinal and qualitative\nterms. (A much broader analysis is provided by Fitelson and Hawthorne\n2010, Hawthorne and Fitelson 2010 [Other Internet Resources]. Notably,\ntheir results include the full specification of the sufficient and\nnecessary conditions for the main inequality \\(C_{P}(h, e) \\gt\nC_{P}(h, e^*)\\).)\n\nIn general, Bayesian (relevance) confirmation theory implies that the\nevidential import of an instance of some generalization will often\ndepend on the credence structure, and relies on its formal\nrepresentation, \\(P\\), as a tool for more systematic analyses.\nConsider another instructive example. Assume that \\(a\\) denotes some\ncompany from some (otherwise unspecified) sector of the economy, and\nlabel the latter predicate \\(S\\). So, \\(k = Sa\\). You are informed\nthat \\(a\\) increased revenues in 2019, represented as \\(e = Ra\\). Does\nthis confirm \\(h = \\forall x(Sx \\rightarrow Rx)\\)? It does, at least\nto some degree, one would say. For an expansion of the whole sector\n(recall that you have no clue what this is) surely would account for\nthe data. That\u2019s a straightforward HD kind of reasoning (and a\nsuitable Hempelian counterpart reconstruction would concur). But does\n\\(e\\) also confirm \\(h^* = Sb \\rightarrow Rb\\) for some further\ncompany \\(b\\)? Well, another obvious account of the data \\(e\\) would\nbe that company \\(a\\) has gained market shares at the expenses of some\ncompetitor, so that \\(e\\) might well seem to support \\(\\neg h^*,\\) if\nanything (the revenues example is inspired by a remark in Blok, Medin,\nand Osherson 2007, 1362).\n\nIt can be shown that the Bayesian notion of relevance confirmation\nallows for this pattern of judgments, because (given \\(k\\)) evidence\n\\(e\\) above increases the probability of \\(h\\) but may well have the\nopposite effect on \\(h^*\\) (see Sober 1994 for important remarks along\nsimilar lines). Notably, \\(h\\) entails \\(h^*\\) by plain instantiation,\nand so contradicts \\(\\neg h^*\\). As a consequence, the implication\nthat \\(C_{P}(h,e\\mid k)\\) is positive while \\(C_{P}(h^*,e\\mid k)\\) is\nnot clashes with each of the following, and proves them unduly\nrestrictive: the Special Consequence Condition (SCC), the Predictive\nInference Condition (PIC), and the Consistency Condition (Cons). Note\nthat these principles were all evaded by HD-confirmation, but all\nimplied by confirmation as firmness (see above).\n\nAt the same time, the most compelling features of \\(F\\)-confirmation,\nwhich the HD model was unable to capture, are retained by confirmation\nas relevance. In fact, all our measures of relevance confirmation\n(\\(D, L\\), and \\(Z\\)) entail the ordinal extension of the Entailment\nCondition (EC) as well as \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = -C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid\nk)\\) and thereby Confirmation Complementarity in all of its forms\n(qualitative, ordinal, and quantitative). Moreover, the Bayesian\nconfirmation theorist of either the firmness or the relevance strand\ncan avail herself of the same quantitative strategy of \u201cdamage\ncontrol\u201d for the main specific paradox of HD-confirmation, i.e.,\nthe irrelevant conjunction problem. (See statement (CIC) above, and\nCrupi and Tentori 2010, Fitelson 2002. Also see Chandler 2007 for\ncriticism, and Moretti 2006 for a related debate.)\n\nWe\u2019re left with one last issue to conclude our discussion, to\nwit, the blite paradox. Recall that \\(blite\\) is so defined:\n\n\\[blite(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x)\\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge (\\neg\nex_{t\\le T}(x)\\rightarrow white(x)).\\]\n\n\nAs always heretofore, we posit \\(h = \\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow\nblack(x)),\\) \\(h^* = \\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow blite(x)).\\) We\nthen consider the set up where \\(k = raven(a) \\wedge ex_{t\\le T}(a),\\)\n\\(e= black(a),\\) and \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1.\\) Various authors have noted\nthat, with Bayesian relevance confirmation, one has that \\(P(h\\mid\nk)\\gt P(h^*\\mid k)\\) is sufficient to imply that \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid\nk)\\gt C_{P}(h^*,e\\mid k)\\) (see Gaifman 1979, 127\u2013128; Sober\n1994, 229\u2013230; and Fitelson 2008, 131). So, as long as the black\nhypothesis is perceived as initially more credible than its blite\ncounterpart, the former will be more strongly confirmed than the\nlatter. Of course, \\(P(h\\mid k)\\gt P(h^*\\mid k)\\) is an entirely\ncommonsensical assumption, yet these same authors have generally, and\nquite understandably, failed to see this result as philosophically\nilluminating. Lacking some interesting, non-question-begging story as\nto why that inequality should obtain, no solution of the paradox seems\nto emerge. More modestly, one could point out that a measure of\nrelevance confirmation \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) implies (i) and (ii)\nbelow.\n\nNecessarily (that is, for any \\(P\\in \\bP\\)), \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\).\nPossibly (that is, for some \\(P\\in \\bP\\)), each one of the\nfollowing obtains:\n\n\n\\(e\\) confirms that a raven will be black if examined after \\(T\\),\nthat is, \\((raven(b)\\wedge \\neg ex_{t\\le T}(b)) \\rightarrow\nblack(b),\\) relative to \\(k\\); and\n\\(e\\) does not confirm that a raven will be white if\nexamined after \\(T\\), that is, \\((raven(b)\\wedge \\neg ex_{t\\le T}(b))\n\\rightarrow white(b),\\) relative to \\(k\\).\n \n\n\nWithout a doubt, (i) and (ii) fall far short of a satisfactory\nsolution of the blite paradox. Yet it seems at least a legitimate\nminimal requirement for a compelling solution (if any exists) that it\nimplies both. It is then of interest to note that confirmation as\nfirmness is inconsistent with (i), while Hempelian and HD-confirmation\nare inconsistent with (ii).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Achinstein, P.
