    "main_text": "Theory of Perception\n2. Theory of Perception\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s earliest study of physiology was with Johannes\nM\u00fcller. M\u00fcller (1801\u20131858) was a keen experimenter and\nnaturalist along the lines of Ernst Haeckel and Alexander von\nHumboldt, sailing to the tropics to find specimens for his studies\n(Otis 2007, 6\u201314). Early in his career, M\u00fcller was also a\nproponent of Schelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie.\nNaturphilosophie took its cue from what Schelling took to be\nKant\u2019s assertion that, while each part of an organism supported\nthe whole, the only purpose of a living organism was itself.\n\u201cM\u00fcller\u2019s enormously influential Handbook of\nHuman Physiology, written and rewritten between 1833 and 1844,\nshows his simultaneous commitments to vitalism, philosophy, and\nrigorous science\u201d (Otis 2007, 21).\n\nAccording to the \u201cprojection\u201d theory of the physiology of\nperception, a stimulus causes its response directly. That is, our\nnerves are malleable, like wax, and the objects \u201cproject\u201d\nsignals onto the nerves directly, like a key pressed into the wax.\nBased on experiments in his laboratory, and on the phenomena of\nbinocular vision revealed by the stereoscope Charles Wheatstone\ninvented in the 1830s, M\u00fcller observed that several phenomena of\nthe physiology of perception contradict the projection theory. One\nsuch phenomenon is stereoscopic binocular vision, in which the two\nimages on our retinas are resolved into one image, the image we see.\nIf images are projected directly onto the sense nerves, M\u00fcller\nasked, then how is stereoscopic vision possible? M\u00fcller also\ncited the fact that images from objects are projected onto the retina\nupside down, but we see them as right side up. The projection theory\nhas no explanation of these effects.\n\nIn response to experimental data, M\u00fcller constructed the\n\u201claw of specific sense energies\u201d\n[Sinnesenergien]. M\u00fcller argued that each nerve is\nconfigured to receive a specific range of signals, as a radio is tuned\nto receive sound on a certain wavelength (of course, M\u00fcller did\nnot use this analogy). M\u00fcller called the configuration a\n\u201cspecific sense energy.\u201d M\u00fcller explained\nstereoscopic vision by arguing that each retina is able to perceive\nitself, that is, to perceive a priori the manifold, or grid, of points\nthat can be projected onto the retina. M\u00fcller hypothesized that\nthere was an organic correlation between the left and the right\nretinas of the eye (M\u00fcller 1837\u20131840, 2: 351\u2013385, see\nalso Turner 1993, 159\u2013160). Each point on the left retina is\nindexed to one and only one point on the right retina. M\u00fcller\nargues that for each point seen in stereoscopic vision, the two\nsignals from the corresponding points on the two retinas are projected\nonto a single point.\n\nM\u00fcller\u2019s explanation appeals to an a priori perception of\nthe retina by itself, and to the activity of projecting two points\nonto a theoretical projection surface a priori. M\u00fcller tries to\nuse Kantian philosophy to support his theory, arguing that by the\n\u201cmanifold accessible to pure intuition\u201d Kant meant, or\ncould have meant, the a priori possible manifold of physical points\nthat could be perceived by the retina. Robert DiSalle presents\nevidence that this view is not Kantian (DiSalle 1993, 502ff).\n\nFrom 1838 to 1842, Helmholtz studied medicine under M\u00fcller. From\n1842 to 1848, while working as an army surgeon in Potsdam, Helmholtz\nmade many trips to Berlin to work in Gustav Magnus\u2019s library.\nDuring these trips, Helmholtz stayed in contact with fellow students\nof M\u00fcller\u2019s he had met while working in M\u00fcller\u2019s\nlaboratory, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Ernst Br\u00fccke. In 1845,\nHelmholtz joined the Berlin Physical Society, which was founded by du\nBois-Reymond and also counted among its members Br\u00fccke and Werner\nvon Siemens. Du Bois-Reymond founded the Physical Society to support\nexperiment and to banish vitalism from scientific research. For more\non Helmholtz\u2019s early career and relationship with the Physical\nSociety, see Sulloway 1992, 14ff and 65ff, and Cahan 2012.\n\nWhile Helmholtz did not contradict M\u00fcller by name in his writings\non physiology, Helmholtz\u2019s research, in M\u00fcller\u2019s and\nMagnus\u2019s labs and later in his own labs in Bonn and\nK\u00f6nigsberg, is in conflict with the doctrine of specific sense\nenergies (see Otis 2007, 129\u2013130). Helmholtz proposes a\n\u201csign\u201d theory, according to which sensations symbolize\ntheir stimuli, but are not direct copies of those stimuli. While\nM\u00fcller explains the correspondence between sensation and object\nby means of an innate configuration of sense nerves, Helmholtz argues\nthat we construct that correspondence by means of a series of learned,\n\u201cunconscious inferences.\u201d\n\nIn his sign theory of perception as expressed in his early career\n(1848\u20131868), Helmholtz argues that the mind makes a series of\nmental adjustments, \u201cunconscious inferences,\u201d to construct\na coherent picture of its experiences. Helmholtz argues that spatial\nposition, often used as a criterion to individuate objects, is an\ninterpretation of our sensations, and not their immediate result.\nAgain, stereoscopic vision shows that what may appear, to us, as a\nsingle image is in fact two images resolved into one. Perspective can\ndistort size, as when one puts a finger in front of the moon.\nHelmholtz believes that we learn how to interpret spatial concepts\nthrough experience, which means that he has what he calls an empirical\ntheory of spatial perception. This theory coexists, in\nHelmholtz\u2019s epistemology, with his above commitment to the sign\ntheory, according to which spatial properties are only properties of\nrepresentations. Helmholtz\u2019s invention of the ophthalmoscope in\n1850\u20131851 contributed to his understanding of the physiology of\nperception (Schett 1999; for images of the original Helmholtz\nophthalmoscope see De Schweinitz and Randall 1899, 172ff).\nPhilosophically, Helmholtz\u2019s epistemology commits him to the\nview that representations arise in a physical process, but are signs\nand not copies of their objects.\n\nHelmholtz was inspired by the theory of\n Hermann Lotze\n (1817\u20131881) in his explanation of these phenomena. For Lotze,\nHelmholtz observes, \u201cto the sensations from spatially distinct\nnerve endings correspond various determinate Localzeichen\n[literally: place signs], whose spatial meaning is learned\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1968 [1869], 57). My various sensations of my finger are\noriginally unrelated, but I can relate them to each other by means of\nthe concept \u201cmy finger,\u201d which serves as a mental\nLocalzeichen that contains the data of all the sensations.\nThe space of perception is a general Localzeichen that\nrelates all possible sensations to each other. The usefulness of\nLotze\u2019s theory is that all psychological sensations are mapped\ndirectly onto mental concepts, and even space becomes a tool for\nconstructing an interpretation of sense-data, akin to a language.\n\nAccording to Helmholtz\u2019s explanations of the physiology of\nperception, the qualities of sensations \u201cbelong only to our\nnervous system,\u201d and we acquire our knowledge of spatial\nordering through perceiving an unchanging sequence of sense\nimpressions of the same object:\n\nIt is easy to see that by moving our fingers over an object, we can\nlearn the sequences in which impressions of it present themselves and\nthat these sequences are unchanging, regardless which finger we use.\nIt is thus that our knowledge of the spatial arrangement of objects is\nattained. Judgments concerning their size result from observations of\nthe congruence of our hand with parts or points of an object\u2019s\nsurface, or from the congruence of the retina with parts or points of\nthe retinal image. A strange consequence, characteristic of the ideas\nin the minds of individuals with at least some experience, follows\nfrom the fact that the perceived spatial ordering of things originates\nin the sequences in which the qualities of sensations are presented by\nour moving sense organs: the objects in the space around us appear to\npossess the qualities of our sensations. They appear to be red or\ngreen, cold or warm, to have an odour or a taste, and so on. Yet these\nqualities of sensations belong only to our nervous system and do not\nextend at all into the space around us. Even when we know this,\nhowever, the illusion does not cease, for it is the primary and\nfundamental truth. The illusion is quite simply the sensations which\nare given to us in spatial order to begin with (Helmholtz 1971 [1878],\n376\u20137).\n\n\nAs a concrete example of a judgment of relative spatial position,\nHelmholtz gives the case of someone grasping a pen in her fingers. She\ncannot infer directly from the sensation of the pen that it is in one\nplace, because each finger feels only the position of the pen relative\nto the finger itself. She would have exactly the same sensations if\nher fingers were touching two or three different pens, separated in\nspace. The belief that the pen is in one place only is based on her\nknowledge that his fingers are close enough together that only one pen\nwill fit between them. As Helmholtz remarks,\n\nWhen two different parts of the skin are touched at the same time, two\ndifferent sensitive nerves are excited, but the local separation\nbetween these two nerves is not a sufficient ground for our\nrecognition of the two parts which have been touched as distinct, and\nfor the conception of two different external objects which follows.\nIndeed, this conception will vary according to circumstances. If we\ntouch the table with two fingers, and feel under each a grain of sand,\nwe suppose that there are two separate grains of sand; but if we place\ntwo fingers one against the other, and a grain of sand between them,\nwe may have the same sensations of touch in the same two nerves as\nbefore, and yet, under these circumstances, we suppose that there is\nonly a single grain. In this case, our consciousness of the position\nof the fingers has obviously an influence upon the result at which the\nmind arrives\u2026 What, then, is it which comes to help the\nanatomical distinction in locality between the different sensitive\nnerves, and, in cases like those I have mentioned, produces the notion\nof separation in space? (Helmholtz 1995 [1868], 175\u20136)\n\n\nHelmholtz argues that perceived properties such as separation in space\nare well-founded inferences from two sources of knowledge: our\nexperience, and the properties of our sense organs. For Helmholtz,\nknowledge of the way our physiology works in perception is essential\nto any epistemological account of spatial properties. Helmholtz argues\nthat the more we know about the physiology of perception, the more\naccurate our inferences about our experience will be. In the case of a\nperson grasping a pen or touching a grain of sand, Helmholtz argues\nthat we become aware that the object touched is a single object by\nstudying the position of our sense organs: the nerve endings in our\nfingers, in this case. Our awareness of distinction of spatial\nposition, necessary for depth perception and perception of distance,\nis learned and not innate. Lenoir (2006) is a rich history of\nHelmholtz\u2019s influences on this score, including Johann Herbart,\nWilhelm Wundt, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and an analysis of\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory of perception as\n\u201coperationalizing\u201d the Kantian view.\n\nIn Helmholtz\u2019s early work, and in some later essays, perceptual\nspace is a mental generalization of our orientation with respect to\nobjects in space. We learn the general properties of space by\ndiscovering what spatial properties do not change when objects move,\nand when we move relative to the objects. The insight that the\nspatially relevant properties of objects are the properties that\nremain invariant when objects change position, or when we change\nposition relative to the objects, is fundamental to Helmholtz\u2019s\nlater work on topology.\n\nIn the third part of Helmholtz\u2019s Handbook of Physiological\nOptics, Helmholtz draws a distinction between nativism and\nempiricism in the physiology of perception. In drawing up the\nHandbook, Helmholtz\u2019s \u201ctask was to survey the\nfield of physiological optics for the purpose of writing a work that\nwould appear as volume nine of Karsten\u2019s Encyklop\u00e4die\nder Physik. The format of the Karsten series dictated that\nHelmholtz provide a thorough review of both past and present work, a\ntask he performed diligently. Wishing to provide a systematic\ntheoretical framework for his survey of the field, Helmholtz divided\nthe major theoretical positions with respect to spatial perception\ninto two groups, which he characterized with the adjectives\nempiristisch and nativistisch\u201d (Hatfield 1991,\n274\u2013275. I follow Hatfield in translating the term\n\u201cempirismus\u201d as \u201cempirism.\u201d). Turner (1993)\nhas argued that Helmholtz\u2019s empirism was pragmatic \u2013 that\nHelmholtz adopted an empirist stance to meet the challenges of\n\u201cimposing order on a chaotic new field of investigation\u201d\nand of defending his stance in his lifelong debate with Ewald Hering\n(Turner 1993,155).\n\nSignificant questions in the empirism \u2013 nativism debate include\nhow to explain perception of depth and relief (Turner 1993, 156). The\n\u201cprojection\u201d theory explained relief perception by\nclaiming that the mind interprets visual cues to construct a combined,\nrelief picture out of two flat pictures provided by the eyes (Turner\n1993, 158). By 1867, when Helmholtz published his Handbook of\nPhysiological Optics, Helmholtz had developed his\n\u201csign\u201d theory, according to which the brain\u2019s\nconstruction of phenomena such as depth and separation in space is\nlearned. This account brought Helmholtz into conflict with Hering.\n\nNativism [Hering\u2019s account] is the view that at birth (or\nsometime thereafter, depending upon the ontogenetic timetable) the\norganism, upon visual stimulation, will experience a spatially\norganized array of colored areas. The key notion is that the\ndisposition to have spatially organized visual experience is inborn\nand does not depend upon a process of learning. A nativist need not\nassert that an innately endowed organism will be visually competent at\nbirth, for the visual system might become functional only after a\nfurther period of maturation. Empirism [Helmholtz\u2019s account] is\nthe view that at least some of the spatial organization found in the\nvisual experience of the adult is the result of learning; it asserts\nthat some or all of the ability to perceive a spatially organized\nvisual world is acquired (Hatfield 1991, 276).\n\n\nThe debate between Helmholtz and Hering focused on several specific\ncases, in particular, how to account for the so-called\n\u201choropter\u201d problem. The horopter is the set of points that\nthe eye perceives as equidistant from the perceiving subject when the\neye is focusing on a single point. The eye perceives points on the\nhoropter as if they were lying on a straight line at a fixed distance\nfrom the eye. However, in reality the horopter line is a curve, that\nis, in reality the points are not equally distant from the eye.\n\nWhen looking at a single object, some points on the object stimulate\nboth eyes, but some points stimulate only the right or the left eye.\nThe brain resolves these common and distinct stimuli into a single\nimage (Hershenson 1999, 29\u201330). The fact that the brain must\nresolve two distinct images into one accounts for the horopter effect.\nWhen the eyes are focusing on a single point, the left and the right\neyes give different inputs to the brain about objects to the left or\nright of the point of focus. The brain corrects for the different\ninputs coming from the left and the right eyes by representing them as\nequally distant from the eyes as the object of focus.\n\nHering and Helmholtz disagree, not about the empirical results or the\nconcept of the horopter itself, but about how to explain the\nbrain\u2019s resolution of two images into one. Helmholtz argues that\nthe brain adjusts the retinal images by a process of\n\u201cunconscious inferences.\u201d Helmholtz contends that a\nchild\u2019s brain learns to respond to stimuli as the child\ndevelops, and that the brain unconsciously adjusts itself to produce a\ncoherent experience \u2014 for instance, to resolve retinal\ndisparities. For recent work on unconscious inference see De Kock\n2014a, De Kock 2014b, Patton 2018, Patton 2019.\n\nHering argues that the ability to experience objects as a single,\nspatially ordered image is a disposition inborn in human children, and\nnot acquired. While children may not be born with the ability to\nresolve two images into one, Hering claims that the ability develops\nwhen a child grows to maturity, and is not learned. Hering argues that\ndepth perception and stereoscopic vision are inherent physical\nabilities, like running or even breathing, that can be honed but are\nnot learned wholesale from experience. In fact, to Hering, the\nadjustments the brain and eyes make to different inputs are automatic\nand involuntary, like a heartbeat. Helmholtz contends that depth\nperception and stereoscopic vision require reciprocal adjustment to\nobjects and thus are skills that must be learned through experience,\nlike shaving in front of a mirror (an example he takes from\nM\u00fcller, see Otis 2007, 129). When shaving in front of a mirror,\none must learn to distinguish right from left in the mirror, and to\nturn the right or left side of one\u2019s face to the mirror\ncorrectly, even though the apparent motion in the mirror is the\nopposite of the felt motion in one\u2019s body. Helmholtz argues that\nthe ability to shave in front of a mirror cannot be innate, because it\nrequires learned adjustments to the properties of one\u2019s\nenvironment, that reflections in a mirror are inverted, for\ninstance.\n\nPatton (2022) argues that the Helmholtz-Hering debate \u201crevealed\ndeep fissures in nineteenth century accounts of scientific\nexplanation, as well as in the conception of how physiology,\npsychology, physics, and philosophy are related\u201d: \u201cHering\nwas a pioneer of Lamarckian explanations, arguing for an early version\nof the biogenetic law. Hering explains physical processes, including\nperception, in terms of \u2018organic memory\u2019 that is supported\nby \u2018vital forces\u2019 located throughout the body. Helmholtz,\non the other hand, argues that vital forces are in direct conflict\nwith the results he and others proved in the 1840s and 50s on the\nconservation of force.\u201d \n\nOtis (2007) and Turner (1993) argue that the most significant\ndifference between Hering and Helmholtz is not in their distinct\nexplanations of the empirical evidence. Rather, the difference is in\nthe epistemological consequences of their higher-order commitments. If\nHelmholtz is right, then our access to objective properties is not\ndirect, but constructed. In his early \u201csign\u201d theory,\nHelmholtz argues that perceptions of objects are not impressions like\nthe imprint of a key on wax, but are symbols or signs of their\nobjects, as a name is a symbol of a person. For Helmholtz, the degree\nof resemblance between perception and object may be as remote as the\ndegree of resemblance between a written name and the physical person\nto whom the name refers (Helmholtz 1882, 2:608, Helmholtz 1903,\n1:41ff; cited in Schiemann 1998, 26). Hering objects strenuously to\nthese epistemological consequences of Helmholtz\u2019s sign theory,\nand argues that we have direct access to real objects in\nperception.\n\nThere is significant debate over the question of how far\nHelmholtz\u2019s theory was influenced by Kantianism. David Galaty,\nNicholas Pastore, and David Leary have argued that Helmholtz was\nKantian in his approach (Galaty 1971, 159\u201366; Pastore 1978,\n355\u201376; and Leary 1982, 36; cited in Hatfield 1991, 325). As\nMichael Heidelberger has observed recently, the Neo-Kantian Alois\nRiehl refers to Kant as a \u201cman of the physiologists,\u201d and\nRiehl refers to Helmholtz\u2019s \u201cKantian understanding of\nsensory perception,\u201d although Heidelberger himself may not read\nHelmholtz as a Kantian (Riehl 1876, v and 5; Heidelberger 2007, 30).\nGary Hatfield and Edwin Boring have argued that Helmholtz\u2019s\nempiricism outweighs his Kantianism. Boring\u2019s classic history of\npsychology inaugurated the contemporary reading of Helmholtz as an\nempiricist or empirist (Boring 1942, chapter 15). Hatfield argues\nthat, while Helmholtz maintained some Kantian doctrines for a time,\nhis mature view departs from Kantianism (Hatfield 1991,\n325\u2013326), and Lenoir concurs (2006, 200\u2013204). In a 1918\narticle, the Marburg Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer supports this mixed\nreading of Helmholtz. According to Cassirer, although\nHelmholtz\u2019s view was \u201clinked deliberately to Kant,\u201d\nand Helmholtz was very influential in the origins of Neo-Kantianism,\nHelmholtz made the a priori dependent on the results of natural\nscience, a significant departure from Kantianism (Cassirer 2005\n[1918], 96). Edgar (2018) addresses the broader question of the place\nof Helmholtz in the neo-Kantian tradition.\n\nOne area of debate centers on the influence of Johann Gottlieb Fichte\non Helmholtz\u2019s work. Heidelberger (1995) and De Kock (2018)\nemphasize the influence of Fichtean idealist philosophy on Helmholtz,\nnoting, for instance, that Fichte\u2019s distinction between the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cnot-I\u201d is employed in\nHelmholtz\u2019s analysis of perceptual experience and in the\ndistinction between subjectivity and objectivity. Hatfield (2018)\nresponds that Helmholtz \u201crejected Fichtean idealism\u201d and\nwas influenced more profoundly by empirical physiologists of\nperception, including M\u00fcller and Wundt but also Johann Georg\nSteinbuch and Caspar Theobald Tourtual. Hatfield argues that\nHelmholtz\u2019s view in 1867 is better understood as \u201ca form\nof modest realism, a kind of structural realism\u201d avant la\nlettre, \u201cand that, in 1878, he consolidated this position in a\nway that renders it metaphysical\u201d (2018, 33).\n\nSwanson (2016) has argued that the \u2018predictive processing\u2019\nparadigm in contemporary cognitive and computational neuroscience has\nroots in Kant and Helmholtz. Predictive processing means\n\u201cperception involves the use of a unified body of acquired\nknowledge (a multi-level \u2018generative model\u2019) to predict\nthe incoming sensory barrage\u201d (Clark 2015). As Swanson notes,\n\u201cThe current PP paradigm emerged from early work on generative\nmodels, and this work explicitly identifies itself as being directly\ninspired by \u2026 Hermann von Helmholtz \u2026 For example, the\nseminal article on the use of generative models in machine perception,\ntitled \u2018The Helmholtz Machine,\u2019 states that\n\u2018Following Helmholtz, we view the human perceptual system as a\nstatistical inference engine whose function is to infer the probable\ncauses of sensory input\u2019\u201d (Swanson 2016, 10; Dayan et al.,\n1995, 89).\n\nTracz (2018) defends a reading that Helmholtz is a relationalist about\nperceptual properties, drawing on a related argument from Allais\n(2015) that transcendental idealism is a form of relationalism.\n\u201cHelmholtz\u2019s relationalism should be of interest to\nreaders of Kant, for according to one of the main strands of\ninterpretation, Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism treats all\nproperties that appear in perception as relational properties\u201d\n(2018, 65). Moreover, \u201crelationalism, particularly color\nrelationalism, is alive in contemporary philosophy of perception\n(e.g., Chirimuuta 2015, Cohen 2009). Despite this, the history of\nrelationalism is rarely thematized, so Helmholtz\u2019s views provide\nsome historical context of interest to present work in philosophy of\nperception\u201d (Tracz 2018, 65). Patton (2019, 73) adds that\n\nWhile the relationalist reading of Helmholtz is certainly defensible,\nit is not the end of the story: restricting ourselves to an argument\naccording to which Helmholtz only is defending contemporary\nrelationalism would risk losing some of the force and complexity of\nHelmholtz\u2019s view\u2026 for Helmholtz, habit and\ninference \u2013 and even deliberate interference \u2013\ncan change the relational properties involved, and thus change my\nperceptual experience\u2026 for Helmholtz, Fechner, and Weber,\nperceptual experience of complex phenomena like music and colored\nobjects is not reducible to the ground-level sensory response to\nphysical stimuli. (Patton 2019, 73)\n\n\nGiulio\u00a0Peruzzi and Valentina Roberti (2023) nominate Helmholtz as\none of the \u201cchief architects of the new color theory\u201d, who\ndefined \u201cthe first non-Euclidean line element in color space,\ni.e., a three-dimensional mathematical model used to describe color\ndifferences in terms of color distances\u201d. Hyder (2009), Turner\n(1996), and Kremer (1993) trace Helmholtz\u2019s engagement with the\nwork of James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann Grassmann on color. \n",
