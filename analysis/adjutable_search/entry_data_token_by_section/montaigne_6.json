    "main_text": "Montaigne\u2019s Legacy from Charron to Hobbes\n7. Conclusion\nMontaigne cultivates his liberty by not adhering exclusively to any\none idea, while at the same time exploring them all. In exercising his\njudgment on various topics, he trains himself to go off on fresh\ntracks, starting from something he read or experienced.  For Montaigne\nthis also means calling into question the convictions of his time,\nreflecting upon his beliefs and education, and cultivating his own\npersonal thoughts. His language can be said to obey only one rule,\nthat is, to be \u201can effect of judgment and \nsincerity,\u201d[70]\n which is the very one that he demands from the pupil. His language \nbears an unmistakable\ntone but contradicts itself sometimes from one place to another,\nperhaps for the very reason that it follows so closely the movements\nof thought.\nIf being a philosopher means being insensitive to human frailties\nand to the evils or to the pleasures which befall us, then Montaigne\nis not a philosopher. If it means using a \u201cjargon\u201d, and\nbeing able to enter the world of scholars, then Montaigne is not one\neither. Yet, if being a philosopher is being able to judge properly in\nany circumstances of life, then the Essays are the exemplary testimony\nof an author who wanted to be a philosopher for good. Montaigne is\nputting his judgment to trial on whatever subject, in order not only\nto get to know its value, but also to form and strengthen it.\nHe manages thus to offer us a philosophy in accordance with life. As\nNietzsche puts it, \u201cthat such a man has written, joy on earth has truly\nincreased\u2026If my task were to make this earth a home, I would attach\nmyself to him.\u201d Or, as Stefan Zweig said, in a context which was closer\nto the historical reality experienced by Montaigne himself : \u201cMontaigne\nhelps us answer this one question: \u2018How to stay free? How to preserve\nour inborn clear-mindedness in front of all the threats and dangers of\nfanaticism, how to preserve the humanity of our hearts among the upsurge of\nbestiality?\u2019\u201d\n",
