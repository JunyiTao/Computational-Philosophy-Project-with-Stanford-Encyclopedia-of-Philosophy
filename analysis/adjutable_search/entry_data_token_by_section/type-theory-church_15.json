    "main_text": "Applications || Semantics of Natural Language\n5.1 Semantics of Natural Language\n\nChurch\u2019s type theory plays an important role in the study of the\nformal semantics of natural language. Pioneering work on this was done\nby Richard Montague. See his papers \u201cEnglish as a formal\nlanguage\u201d, \u201cUniversal grammar\u201d, and \u201cThe\nproper treatment of quantification in ordinary English\u201d, which\nare reprinted in Montague 1974. A crucial component of\nMontague\u2019s analysis of natural language is the definition of a\ntensed intensional logic (Montague 1974: 256), which is an enhancement\nof Church\u2019s type theory. Montague Grammar had a huge impact, and\nhas since been developed in many further directions, not least in\nTypelogical/Categorical Grammar. Further related work on intensional\nand higher-order modal logic is presented in Gallin 1975 and Muskens\n2006.\n",
