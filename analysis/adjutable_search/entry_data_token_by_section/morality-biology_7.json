    "main_text": "Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: Explaining Morality in the Empirical Sense || Autonomous Moral Reflection and the Explanation of Reasoned Moral Judgment and Behavior\n2.4 Autonomous Moral Reflection and the Explanation of Reasoned Moral Judgment and Behavior\n\nSo far, we have focused on scientific projects that treat morality in\nthe empirical sense as calling simply for causal explanation, as by\nappeal to evolutionary influences. This is unexceptionable with regard\nto the origins of the general human capacity for moral judgment:\nclearly some causal explanation is required, and an evolutionary\nexplanation is plausible. But things are much more complicated when we\nconsider the explanation of the actual content of moral\njudgment, feeling and behavior.\n\nWe have had a taste above of the way in which scientists might propose\nto explain our particular moral attitudes or judgments by appeal to\nspecific evolutionary causes as filtered through cultural\ndevelopments. Human beings have a strong, emotionally-laden sense of\nbasic fairness, resentment of cheaters, and a desire that they be\npunished, all of which finds expression in both cultural norms and\nindividual moral judgments. You might experience such feelings if\nyou\u2019ve been the victim of a scam, morally condemning the\nperpetrators. And some of these psychological traits may have\nanalogues in other species. For example, Sarah Brosnan and Frans de\nWaal (2014) argue that \u201cevidence indicates that [inequity\naversion, i.e., negative reactions to unequal\nrewards for similar tasks] is widespread in cooperative species\nunder many circumstances\u201d--though some have disputed this and\noffered alternative hypotheses to explain the behavior, based on\nfurther research (Engelmann, Clift, Herrmann, and Tomasello\n2017).[5]\nIn the simplest case, an animal\nprotests when it sees a companion receive a superior reward for a\nsimilar task, as in a well-known study with brown capuchin monkeys,\nthough similar effects have now been observed even in non-primates,\nsuch as dogs and crows. In the more complex\ncase, chimpanzees sometimes react negatively to inequity even\nwhere they are the ones receiving the greater reward. A natural\nevolutionary hypothesis for the simpler case is that such a\ndisposition protected against \u2018wasting\u2019 cooperative\nefforts where they were not fitness-enhancing. Similarly, a natural\nexplanatory hypothesis for the more complex form of inequity\naversion is that it evolved in creatures with sufficient\npredictive capacities and emotional control because it\npreserved beneficial cooperative relationships that could be\nthreatened by such inequities, thus proving fitness-enhancing on the\nwhole given the benefits of continued cooperation (Brosnan and de\nWaal, 2014). All of this might suggest good prospects for causal\nexplanation of human moral traits in terms of evolved psychological\ntraits. Indeed, Brosnan and de Waal explicitly hypothesize that the\nevolved complex response observed in champanzees is what\n\u201callowed the development of a complete sense of fairness in\nhumans, which aims not at equality for its own sake but for the sake\nof continued cooperation\u201d (Brosnan and de Waal, 2014).\n\nCaution is needed here, however. Our moral judgments and resulting\nbehaviors cannot just be assumed to be mere causal upshots of\nsome such biological and psychological forces, on a par with the\ncooperative activity of bees or the resentment felt by capuchin\nmonkeys (or even the broader unease apparently felt by chimpanzees)\nover unequal rewards for equal work. When a rational agent makes a\njudgment, whether in the sphere of morality or in such areas as\nscience, mathematics or philosophy, the proper question is not in the\nfirst instance what caused that judgment to occur, but what\nreasons the person had for making it\u2014for thinking it to\nbe true. It is those reasons that typically constitute an explanation\nof the judgment. They explain by bringing out what the person\ntook (rightly or wrongly) to be the justification\nfor the belief in question\u2014the considerations showing the belief\nlikely to be true. All of this complicates the explanatory project in\nrelation to the thoughts, feelings and actions of rational agents.\n\nIt is helpful to illustrate the general point first with other kinds\nof judgment, and then to return to morality. Consider some judgments\nin mathematics, philosophy and science:\n\n\nM: There is at least one prime number between 5,000 and 10,000.\n\nP: If identity claims such as \u2018water = H2O\u2019 are\ntrue, then they are necessary truths (i.e., true in all\npossible worlds).\n\nS: There is no such thing as absolute simultaneity.\n\n\nHow do we explain someone\u2019s believing something like M, P or S? We\nnormally need to know her reasons for believing it to be\ntrue, which we can then go on to assess as good or bad reasons for\nsuch a belief. Either way, we typically take her reasons\u2014and the\nreasoning associated with them\u2014to explain her belief,\nwhich is why we engage seriously with her reasons as such in critical\ndiscussion, and go on to inquire into their merits. If, for example,\nwe ask a person why she believes M, and she cites a proof she has\nfound convincing, showing that for any natural number n >\n1 there is at least one prime number between n and\n2n, we normally take this as a sufficient explanation for why\nshe believes M. What we do not normally do is to appeal\ndirectly to independent causes, such as evolutionary or other\nbiological or psychological influences to explain people\u2019s beliefs\nin these areas. Such independent explanations for beliefs can\nsometimes be correct, as in the case of someone given a post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, in which case we may regard her judgment as merely\ncaused and the reasons offered as mere rationalization. But this\nis not the norm.\n\nThe reason why we normally explain beliefs such as M, P or S by appeal\nto the reasons the person gives for them is that we normally assume\nthat the person is capable of intelligent reflection and reasoning and\nhas arrived at her belief for the reasons she gives as a result of\nthat reflection (whether or not the belief is ultimately correct). We\nassume in general that people are capable of significant\nautonomy in their thinking, in the following sense:\n\nAutonomy Assumption: people have, to greater or lesser\ndegrees, a capacity for reasoning that follows autonomous\nstandards appropriate to the subjects in question, rather than in\nslavish service to evolutionarily given instincts merely filtered\nthrough cultural forms or applied in novel environments. Such\nreflection, reasoning, judgment and resulting behavior seem to be\nautonomous in the sense that they involve exercises of\nthought that are not themselves significantly shaped by specific\nevolutionarily given tendencies, but instead follow independent norms\nappropriate to the pursuits in question (Nagel 1979).\n\n\nThis assumption seems hard to deny in the face of such abstract\npursuits as algebraic topology, quantum field theory, population\nbiology, modal metaphysics, or twelve-tone musical composition, all of\nwhich seem transparently to involve precisely such autonomous\napplications of human intelligence. Even if there are\nevolutionary influences behind our general tendency to engage in\ncertain kinds of mental activity, or behind some of our motives in\nthese pursuits (e.g., if a given musician or poet is motivated to\ncompose music or poetry in order to impress a potential mate), this\nwould not show that the activity is governed in its details by such\ninfluences (cf. Buchanan and Powell 2015, 2018, and 2019). And again,\nthis assumption of autonomy is borne out in our normal explanations of\nbeliefs such as P above: we take a person at her word that what\nexplains her believing P, for example, is that due to philosophical\narguments she\u2019s read and has found convincing she takes\n\u2018water\u2019 to work like a proper name and thinks that it\nfollows from this that \u2018water\u2019 refers to whatever\nmolecular compound it picks out in the actual world in all possible\nworlds in which the compound exists.\n\nFew would deny the autonomy assumption altogether. To do so in the\nname of providing alternative evolutionary causal explanations of our\nbeliefs would risk self-defeat: for if we lack the relevant\nintellectual autonomy across the board, then even the\nbiologist\u2019s beliefs about evolutionary biology and its\nimplications would just be attributable to such biological\ncauses, rather than to reasons that provide real warrant for such\nbeliefs within a rational framework with truth-tracking integrity. The\nchallenge to the autonomy assumption is therefore more likely to come\nin a selective\n form.[6]\n\nThis brings us back to moral judgment. As with M, P and S, people\ntypically have reasons for their moral judgments, and whether\nor not we agree with them, we typically take those reasons to explain\nwhy they believe what they do. Consider again the moral judgment\nmentioned earlier:\n\nMJ: The person who cheated me did something wrong and should be\npunished.\n\n\nJust as with M, P and S, someone making this judgment will have\nreasons that she takes to justify this claim, ultimately tying into\nher overall conception of right and wrong. And we tend to take this at\nface value as an explanation of why she believes MJ, unless we have\nspecial reason to suspect distorting causes, such as prejudice leading\nto misperception and rationalization. We tend to think that a person\nhas the moral beliefs she does as a result of background moral\nreflection and reasoning, within her cultural context. In other words,\nwe tend to treat a person\u2019s moral beliefs much as we treat her\nreasoned mathematical, scientific, or philosophical beliefs, applying\nthe autonomy assumption in seeking to explain why she believes what\nshe does.\n\nOne potential lesson from evolutionary biology, however, is that even\nif the autonomy assumption equally applies in principle to\nthe sphere of moral judgment, it may be a mistake just to assume that\nmost moral judgment and behavior is in fact a result of the exercise\nof such autonomous reflection, reasoning and judgment. The autonomy\nassumption, after all, says only that we have the capacity for\nrelevantly autonomous reflection and judgment; it does not imply that\nwe always exercise it. Perhaps the human capacity for autonomous\nthinking is exercised only in some cases, while in others the process\nthat leads to moral belief is largely influenced by evolved\npsychological dispositions, such as emotional adaptations. While such\na situation may not tend to arise in relation to our mathematical,\nphilosophical, or scientific thinking, our evolutionary history may\nhave given rise to emotional dispositions that play a significant role\nin at least some of our moral thinking, feeling and behavior. (See\nsection 2.5 below.)\n\nOne plausible story, then, is that while many of our more reflective\nand reasoned moral judgments involve autonomous exercises of\ndomain-general intelligence, many other less reflective moral\njudgments are largely attributable to evolutionary\ninfluences\u2014both through direct conditioning of people\u2019s\nmoral judgments by evolved, domain-specific psychological dispositions\nand through background influences on cultural factors. On this\nhypothesis, we cannot treat moral judgments as a homogeneous set, but\nmust recognize that they can come about in very different ways,\nrequiring a plurality of explanatory models. While a model of\nautonomous reasoning might apply to some moral beliefs and behaviors,\na model appealing to evolutionary causal influences will apply to\nothers. And often some combination of models may be necessary, as in\ncases where both evolutionary influences and our own independent moral\nreflection might lead to similar judgments, overdetermining\nthem.\n\nFor example, even if it is true that evolutionary pressures favoring\ncaring for offspring have strongly influenced our attitudes towards\nour children, it does not follow that this is the complete explanation\nfor why we believe we have special obligations to care for our\nchildren and for why we behave as we do toward them. It may be\npart of the explanation, while another part may have to do\nwith an autonomous recognition of the appropriateness of\nspecial parental care: we see that we have good reasons to\ntake special care of our children, which ought to motivate us\neven if we weren\u2019t already motivated by instinctive feelings. We\nmight also employ autonomous, domain-general comprehensive moral\nreasoning to recognize that our instinctive feelings shouldn\u2019t\nalways be followed, e.g., in cases where considerations of justice\nconstrain certain pursuits of benefits for one\u2019s own children,\nproviding genuine overriding reasons to refrain from unjust actions.\n(We will consider another plausible example of overdetermination\ninvolving judgments about the much discussed \u2018Trolley\ncases\u2019 in section 3.)\n",
