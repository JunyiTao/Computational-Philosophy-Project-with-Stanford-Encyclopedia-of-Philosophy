    "main_text": "Metaphysics: sources and importance\n1. Metaphysics: sources and importance\n\nAvicenna reads his main reference\u2014Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics\u2014in the light of two interrelated\ntraditions: that of the Late Ancient commentators (e.g., Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Themistius, Ammonius of Hermias) and that of the\nNeo-Platonic writings known in the Arabic world\u2014the so-called\nPlotiniana and Procliana\n arabica[1]\u2014part\n of which were ascribed to Aristotle himself. He consequently\nreinterprets Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics and gives an\noriginal structure to his own text (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 5; Menn\n 2013).[2]\n The Arabic-Islamic traditions of philosophy and theology\n(Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u02bfAd\u012b, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, the\nKal\u0101m) are also essential to understanding Avicenna\u2019s\nmetaphysics: not only does Avicenna\u2019s terminology often depend\non his predecessors, but also some of the solutions he adopts are the\nresult of the ongoing discussion about their positions. Yet Avicenna\nsurpasses both his sources and his interlocutors. From a theoretical\npoint of view, his metaphysics is, in fact, incredibly rich and\nrefined. Many issues\u2014such as being and universality, the\nGod-world relationship, the problem of evil\u2014receive a quite\noriginal treatment in Avicenna\u2019s system. This clearly explains\nthe paramount importance Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics has for the\nhistory of philosophy, in both the West and the East. Indeed, thanks\nto the Toledo Latin version of the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t of\nKit\u0101b al-\u0160if\u0101\u02be (Liber de\nphilosophia prima sive scientia divina), every Latin medieval\nphilosopher from the late 12th century onwards encountered\none or more of Avicenna\u2019s interpretations (Hasse and Bertolacci\n2011; Bertolacci 2013). In the East (and especially in the Persian\narea), Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics not only profoundly influenced\nphilosophy and theology, but also founded a centuries-old tradition\nwhich can be considered still extant (Endress 2006; Michot 1993;\nWisnovsky 2004, 2011, 2014). \n",
