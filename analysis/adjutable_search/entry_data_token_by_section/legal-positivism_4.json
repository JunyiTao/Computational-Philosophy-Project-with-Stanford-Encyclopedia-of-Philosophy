    "main_text": "Law and Its Merits || The Fallibility Thesis\n4.1 The Fallibility Thesis\n\nLaw does not necessarily satisfy the conditions by which it is\nappropriately assessed (Lyons 1984: 63; Hart 1961 [2012:\n185\u2013186)]. Law should be just, but it may not be; it should\npromote the common good, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t; it should\nprotect moral rights, but it may fail miserably. This we may call the\nmoral fallibility thesis. The thesis is correct, but it is not the\nexclusive property of positivism. Aquinas accepts it, Fuller accepts\nit, Finnis accepts it, and Dworkin accepts it. Only a crude\nmisunderstanding of ideas like Aquinas\u2019s claim that \u201can\nunjust law seems to be no law at all\u201d might suggest the\ncontrary. Law may have an essentially moral character and yet be\nmorally deficient. Even if every law always does one kind of justice\n(formal justice; justice according to law), this does not entail that\nit does every kind of justice. Even if every law has a prima\nfacie claim to be applied or obeyed, it does not follow that it\nhas such a claim all things considered. The gap between these partial\nand conclusive judgments is all a natural law theory needs to\naccommodate the fallibility thesis. It is sometimes said that\npositivism gives a more secure grasp on the fallibility of\nlaw, for once we see that it is a social construction we will be less\nlikely to accord it inappropriate deference and better prepared to\nengage in a clear-headed moral appraisal of the law. This claim\nappealed to several positivists, including Bentham and Hart. But while\nthis might follow from the truth of positivism, it cannot provide an\nindependent argument for it. If law has an essentially moral character\nthen it is obfuscating, not clarifying, to describe it as a\nsource-based structure of governance.\n",
