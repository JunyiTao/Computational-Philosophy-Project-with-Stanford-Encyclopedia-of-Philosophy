    "main_text": "Theology\n3. Theology\n\nIn many ways Gregory was a philosopher\u2019s theologian, because he\nbegan with propositions from Scripture as premises for his arguments\nand proceeded deductively (Brown 1998b, 200\u2013201). In his deductive\ntheology, Gregory devoted much time and space to defining his terms\nand exploring exhaustively the implications of possible solutions, a\npractice that makes his Sentences commentary a joy to read\nand a philosophical classic.\n\nGregory\u2019s approach to trinitarian questions has been described\nas one of \u201cradical minimalism\u201d (Friedman 2013, 847). Like\nWalter Chatton, Robert Holkot and William of Rubio before him, Gregory\nadopts Praepositinianism: the divine persons are distinct by\nthemselves, they are not constituted, and there are no properties\ndistinct from the persons. As a result, divine simplicity is\npreserved, at the expense of explanation (Friedman 2013, 853\u2013854). In\nthis context, Gregory \u2019s trinitarian theology is radically\nminimalist because he went further than other defenders of\nPraepositinianism (Friedman 2013, 867) in thoroughly rejecting any\nprinciple of divine operations, therefore clearly dismissing what\nFriedman calls the \u201cpsychological model,\u201d according to\nwhich the intellect and the will, as divine attributes, would play the\npart of such principles.\n\nIn distinctions 38\u201341 of book I, Gregory tackled the general\nproblem of divine foreknowledge and future contingents and the\nspecific dilemma of predestination and free will. Gregory\u2019s\npositions on these questions have already been the subject of study\nfor many decades, and recently historians have attempted to put\nGregory into his immediate Parisian and Oxonian context. Moreover,\nGregory\u2019s nickname, \u201cthe Torturer of Infants,\u201d stems\nin part from his stance on predestination. A discussion of\nGregory\u2019s thought on these issues, therefore, provides a\nconvenient introduction both to his noetic and to his position in\nhistory.\n",
