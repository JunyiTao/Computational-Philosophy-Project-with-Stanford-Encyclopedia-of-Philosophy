    "main_text": "Final Causes Defended\n4. Final Causes Defended\n\nPhysics II 8 contains Aristotle\u2019s most general defense\nof final causality. Here Aristotle establishes that explaining nature\nrequires final causality by discussing a difficulty that may be\nadvanced by an opponent who denies that there are final causes in\nnature. Aristotle shows that an opponent who claims that material and\nefficient causes alone suffice to explain natural change fails to\naccount for their characteristic regularity. Before considering how\nthe defense is attempted, it is important to clarify that this defense\ndoes not perform the function of a proof. By showing that an approach\nto the study of nature that ignores final causality cannot account for\na crucial aspect of nature, Aristotle does not thereby prove that\nthere are final causes in nature. Strictly speaking, the only way to\nprove that nature exhibits final causality is to establish it on\nindependent grounds. But this is not what Aristotle does in\nPhysics II 8. Final causality is here introduced as the best\nexplanation for an aspect of nature which otherwise would remain\nunexplained.\n\nThe difficulty that Aristotle discusses is introduced by considering\nthe way in which rain works. It rains because of material processes\nwhich can be specified as follows: when the warm air that has been\ndrawn up is cooled off and becomes water, then this water comes down\nas rain (Phys. II 8, 198 b 19\u201321). It may happen that\nthe corn in the field is nourished or the harvest is spoiled as a\nresult of the rain, but it does not rain for the sake of any good or\nbad result. The good or bad result is just a coincidence\n(Phys. II 8, 198 b 21\u201323). So, why cannot all natural\nchange work in the same way? For example, why cannot it be merely a\ncoincidence that the front teeth grow sharp and suitable for tearing\nthe food and the molars grow broad and useful for grinding the food\n(Phys. II 8, 198 b 23\u201327)? When the teeth grow in just\nthis way, then the animal survives. When they do not, then the animal\ndies. More directly, and more explicitly, the way the teeth grow is\nnot for the sake of the animal, and its survival or its death is just\na coincidence (Phys. II 8, 198 b 29\u201332).\n\nAristotle\u2019s reply is that the opponent is expected to explain\nwhy the teeth regularly grow in the way they do: sharp teeth\nin the front and broad molars in the back of the mouth. Moreover,\nsince this dental arrangement is suitable for biting and chewing the\nfood that the animal takes in, the opponent is expected to explain the\nregular connection between the needs of the animal and the\nformation of its teeth. Either there is a real causal connection\nbetween the formation of the teeth and the needs of the animal, or\nthere is no real causal connection and it just so happens that the way\nthe teeth grow is good for the animal. In this second case it is just\na coincidence that the teeth grow in a way that it is good for the\nanimal. But this does not explain the regularity of the\nconnection. Where there is regularity there is also a call for an\nexplanation, and coincidence is no explanation at all. In other words,\nto say that the teeth grow as they do by material necessity, and to\nsay that this is good for the animal by coincidence is to leave\nunexplained the regular connection between the growth of the teeth and\nthe needs of the animal. Aristotle offers final causality as his\nexplanation for this regular connection: the teeth grow in the way\nthey do for biting and chewing food and this is good for the animal.\n(See Code 1997: 127\u2013134.)\n\nOne thing to be appreciated about Aristotle\u2019s reply is that the\nfinal cause enters in the explanation of the formation of the parts of\nan organism like an animal as something that is good either\nfor the existence or the flourishing of the animal. In the first case,\nsomething is good for the animal because the animal cannot survive\nwithout it; in the second case, something is good for the animal\nbecause the animal is better off with it. This helps us to understand\nwhy in introducing the concept of end (telos) that is\nrelevant to the study of natural processes Aristotle insists on its\ngoodness: \u201cnot everything that is last claims to be an end\n(telos), but only that which is best\u201d (Phys.\nII 8, 194 a 32\u201333).\n\nOnce his defense of the use of final causes is firmly in place,\nAristotle can make a step further by focusing on the role that matter\nplays in his explanatory project. Let us return to the example chosen\nby Aristotle, the regular growth of sharp teeth in the front and broad\nmolars in the back of the mouth. What explanatory role is left for the\nmaterial processes involved in the natural process? Aristotle does not\nseem to be able to specify what material processes are involved in the\ngrowth of the teeth, but he is willing to recognize that certain\nmaterial processes have to take place for the teeth to grow in the\nparticular way they do. In other words, there is more to the formation\nof the teeth than these material processes, but this formation does\nnot occur unless the relevant material processes take place. For\nAristotle, these material processes are that which is necessary to the\nrealization of a specific goal; that which is necessary on the\nhypothesis that the end is to be obtained.\n\nHypothetical necessity is often equated to conditional necessity. But\nthis equation can be a first approximation at best. Stating the\nconditions under which something is the case is not yet giving a\nsuccessful explanation. In other words, conditional necessity is a\nwider, and indeed weaker, notion than hypothetical necessity (I refer\nthe reader to Stein 2016: 353\u2013382 for a lucid reflection on this\npoint).\n\nPhysics II 9 is entirely devoted to the introduction of the\nconcept of hypothetical necessity and its relevance for the\nexplanatory ambition of Aristotle\u2019s science of nature. In this\nchapter, matter is reconfigured as hypothetical necessity. By so doing\nAristotle acknowledges the explanatory relevance of the material\nprocesses, while at the same time he emphasizes their dependency upon\na specific end.\n",
