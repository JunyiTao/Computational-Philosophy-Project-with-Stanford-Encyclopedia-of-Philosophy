The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project\nis not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader\ndevelopments in nineteenth-century culture and science also\nnecessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical\ncircumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the\nhistorical disciplines that had been underway since the early\nnineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and\nbest known philosophical contributions concerns the question what\ndistinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those\ndisciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from\nthe natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in\nline with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by\nexplicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method,\ncritical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against\nmethodological holism, namely the view that there is only one\nscientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural\nscience.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical\ndisciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883\nEinleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to\nthe human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between\nthe natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of\nspirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience.\nWhile outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in\nnatural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d\nhow the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations\n(Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner\nexperience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and\na descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of\ninner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with\na solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for\ndemarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg\nrector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d\n[\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue\nwith the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of\nspirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes\nDilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To\nthis he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not\nderive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a\ndubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with\nthe natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the\nhuman-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and\nnon-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally,\nWindelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the\nground that it suggests that the distinction between different\nsciences rests on a material distinction between different objects:\nspirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that\nis purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its\nmost abstract form as their starting point: justification in science\nis either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic\nrelation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and\nthe particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to\nbe sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science\nmight pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894:\n143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or\nthe particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145).\nThe former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d\nwhich seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the\nparticular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type\nor of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in\ncontrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that\nrepresent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and\nidiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and\nthe same object can be approached from both points of view, and which\nmethod is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the\ninvestigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and\nparticular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on\ngeneral and causal knowledge which has been derived from the\nnomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his\nanalysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms\n\u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the\nterms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences\ninterchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between\nscientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also\nsuggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic\nmethod. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical\nfacts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894:\n153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular\nfacts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden\nrelations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature\nis a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole\n[Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims\nthat we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which\nwe do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of\nthe individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of\nvalue\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these\nsuggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the\n\u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d\n\u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of\nculture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific\nconcept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the\n\u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on\na principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the\nnatural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this\nreason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and\nunrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in\ncontrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture\nindividual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do\nso on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which\nparticular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a\nspecific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being\n\u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or\n\u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can\nclearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis\nof historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies\non values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902:\n364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about\nhistorical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized\naccount of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately\nleads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study\namounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more\ndeveloped thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that\neach science creates its objects according to the manner in which it\nforms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely\non a system of universal values when making selections about what\nenters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n",
