    "main_text": "What is mental imagery? || The content of mental imagery\n1.4 The content of mental imagery\n\nMental imagery is a form of representation. But what does it represent\nand how does it do so? If mental imagery is a perceptual or at least\nquasi-perceptual representation, it seems that it represents the way\nperceptual states represent. Perceptual states attribute properties to\nthe perceived scene. Mental imagery attributes properties to the\nimagined scene (or imagined properties to the actual scene). Just what\nsuch \u2018imagined\u2019 attributed properties could be and how to\nthink of the \u2018imagined scene\u2019 are highly controversial\nquestions (see, e. g., Kulvicki 2014, Langland-Hassan 2015). What\nseems to be less controversial is that both forms of property\nattributions are underwritten by early cortical processes, and both\nare sensitive to the allocation of attention (Shea 2018, Dijkstra et\nal. 2019).\n\nThis similarity between perception and mental imagery in terms of\ncontent plays an important role in thinking about the phenomenology of\nthese states. One old question concerning the relation between\n(conscious) perception and (conscious) mental imagery is about the\nphenomenal similarity between the two (Hume 1739, 1.1.1). Mental\nimagery can feel similar to perception, so much so that under\nexperimental conditions, it is easy to confuse the two (Perky 1910,\nsee also Hopkins 2012 for a contrasting view). Assuming that the\nphenomenal character of a state depends in some ways on its content\n(an assumption that doesn\u2019t need to be as strong as that of\nintentionalism), we can explain this with reference to the similarity\nof the content of perception and the content of mental imagery.\n\nNot just the similarities, but the differences between mental imagery\nand perception also need to be explained. And the difference between\nperceptual content and the content of mental imagery also plays an\nimportant role in the debate about a phenomenologically salient and\nhistorically influential difference between the vividness of\nperception and the vividness of mental imagery. The historically\ninfluential view, championed most memorably by the British\nempiricists, is that mental imagery is paler and less vivid than\nperception. Even if we set aside hyperphantasics, who report very\nsimilar vividness for mental imagery and perception, this distinction\ndoes not seem to hold across the board. The properties that constitute\nthe content of mental imagery can be very determinate indeed \u2013\nand most of the properties that constitute perceptual content are not\nparticularly determinate (see Dennett 1996 for a classic argument).\nNonetheless, determinacy plays a role in yet another major difference\nbetween perceptual content and the content of mental imagery.\n\nWhen you look at a landscape and shift your attention from the tree on\nthe left to the mountain range on the right, this implies a change in\nthe determinacy of the perceptually attributed properties: the\nproperties attributed to the tree will be less determinate than before\nand the properties attributed to the mountain range will be more\ndeterminate than before (Yeshurun and Carrasco 1998). Let\u2019s\nfocus on the change in determinacy in the latter case: the extra\ndeterminacy of the perceptually attributed properties comes from the\nsensory input: perceptual attention increases determinacy by means of\nextracting more information from the sensory input. In the case of\nmental imagery, in contrast, there is no sensory input to exploit, so\nwhen you close your eyes and imagine the same landscape with the tree\non the left and the mountain range on the right and you shift your\nattention from the former to the latter, then the increased\ndeterminacy of the properties attributed to the mountain range\ncan\u2019t come from the sensory input. It must come from a top-down\nsource \u2013 your beliefs or expectations or memories about mountain\nranges (Nanay 2015).\n",
