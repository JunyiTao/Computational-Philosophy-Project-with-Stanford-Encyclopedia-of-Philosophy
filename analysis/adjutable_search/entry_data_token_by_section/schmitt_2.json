The Concept of the Political and the Critique of Liberalism\n\n\nThe sovereign dictator has the power, in taking the decision on the\nexception, to set aside the positive legal and constitutional order in\nits entirety and to create a novel positive legal and constitutional\norder, together with a situation of social normality that fits it. It\nfollows that the sovereign dictator cannot base his claim to be acting\nin the name of the people on any kind of formal authorization. If the\nold constitution no longer exists and the new one is not yet in force,\nthere is no formal procedure for generating a public will. And yet, the\nsovereign dictator claims to exercise the constituent power of the\npeople. What is more, the constitutional order he is to create is to be\nconsidered as legitimate since it rests on the people\u2019s right to give\nitself a constitution (CT 136\u20139). Schmitt\u2019s view assumes that it is\npossible to speak of the existence of a people in advance of the\ncreation of any positive constitutional framework. Schmitt therefore\nhas to explain what it means for a people to exist prior to any\nconstitutional framework, and he has to give an account of how the\npeople\u2019s political existence prior to any constitutional framework can\nground a sovereign dictatorship.\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s The Concept of the Political phrases the answer to this\nquestion as an account of the nature of \u2018the political.\u2019\n(Sartori 1989; Gottfried 1990, 57\u201382; Meier 1998; Hofmann 2002,\n94\u2013116; Mehring 2003; Kennedy 2004, 92\u2013118; Slomp 2009, 21\u201337; Schupmann 2017, 69\u2013105)\nSchmitt famously claims that \u201cthe specific political distinction\n\u2026 is that between friend and enemy.\u201d (CP 26) The\ndistinction between friend and enemy, Schmitt elaborates, is\nessentially public and not private. Individuals may have personal\nenemies, but personal enmity is not a political phenomenon.  Politics\ninvolves groups that face off as mutual enemies (CP 28\u20139). Two\ngroups will find themselves in a situation of mutual enmity if and\nonly if there is a possibility of war and mutual killing between\nthem. The distinction between friend and enemy thus refers to the\n\u201cutmost degree of intensity \u2026 of an association or\ndissociation.\u201d (CP 26, 38) The utmost degree of association is\nthe willingness to fight and die for and together with other members\nof one\u2019s group, and the ultimate degree of dissociation is the\nwillingness to kill others for the simple reason that they are members\nof a hostile group (CP 32\u20133).\n\n\nSchmitt believes that political enmity can have many different\norigins. The political differs from other spheres of value in that it\nis not based on a substantive distinction of its own. The ethical, for\nexample, is based on a distinction between the morally good and the\nmorally bad, the aesthetic on a distinction between the beautiful and\nthe ugly, and the economical on a distinction between the profitable\nand the unprofitable. The political distinction between friend and\nenemy is not reducible to these other distinctions or, for that matter,\nto any particular distinction \u2014 be it linguistic, ethnic,\ncultural, religious, etc. \u2014 that may become a marker of\ncollective identity and difference (CP 25\u20137). It is possible, for\ninstance, to be enemies with members of a hostile group whom one judges\nto be morally good. And it is equally possible not to be engaged in a\nrelationship of mutual enmity with a group whose individual members one\njudges to be bad. The same holds, Schmitt thinks, for all other\nsubstantive distinctions that may become markers of identity and\ndifference.\n\n\nThis is not to say, however, that one\u2019s conception of moral goodness\nor badness, for instance, will never play a role in a relationship of\npolitical enmity. Any distinction that can serve as a marker of\ncollective identity and difference will acquire political quality if it\nhas the power, in a concrete situation, to sort people into two\nopposing groups that are willing, if necessary, to fight against each\nother (CP 37\u20138). Whether a particular distinction will come to play\nthis role is not determined by its own intrinsic significance but by\nwhether a group of people relies on it to define its own collective\nidentity and comes to think of that identity, as based on that\ndistinction, as something that might have to be defended against other\ngroups by going to war. Since the political is not tied to any\nparticular substantive distinction, Schmitt argues, it is na\u00efve to\nassume that the political will disappear once conflicts arising from a\nparticular distinction no longer motivate opposing groups to fight.\nPolitical identification is likely to latch on to another distinction\nthat will inherit the lethal intensity of political conflict (See ND).\nBut wherever a distinction has political quality, it will be the\ndecisive distinction and the community constituted by it will be the\ndecisive social unit. Since the political community is the social unit\nthat can dispose of people\u2019s lives, it will be able, where it exists,\nto assert its superiority over all other social groups within its\nconfines and to rule out violent conflict among its members (CP\n37\u201345).\n\n\nSchmitt claims that one cannot judge, from an external perspective,\nthat a group is morally unjustified in defining its own identity in a\ncertain way and to introduce political enmity, with the attendant\npossibility of killing, to preserve that identity. Only members of a\ngroup are in a position to decide, from the perspective of an\nexistentially affected participant, whether the otherness of another\ngroup amounts to a threat to their own form of life and thus\npotentially requires to be fought (CP 27; See also CT 76\u20137, 136).\nSchmitt\u2019s reasoning implicitly relies on a collectivist version of the\nlogic of self-defence. The decision whether someone else\u2019s behaviour\nconstitutes a threat to one\u2019s own life, in some concrete situation, and\nthe decision whether it is necessary to use reactive or even\npre-emptive violence to remove or to escape that threat, cannot be\ndelegated to a third person. A group that perceives its own existence\nto be threatened by some other group, Schmitt argues, finds itself in\nan analogous position. The possibility of third-party mediation is\ntherefore ruled out in a truly political conflict (CP 45\u201353).\n\n\nA political community exists, then, wherever a group of people are\nwilling to engage in political life by distinguishing themselves from\noutsiders through the drawing of a friend-enemy distinction (CP 38,\n43\u20134). A group\u2019s capability to draw the distinction between friend and\nenemy does not require, Schmitt holds, that the group already possess a\nformal organization allowing for rule-governed collective\ndecision-taking. A people, thus, will have an existence prior to all\nlegal form as long as there is a sense of shared identity strong enough\nto motivate its members to fight and die for the preservation of the\ngroup. And as long as a people exists in this way it is capable,\nthrough its support, to sustain a sovereign dictatorship exercised in\nits name (CT 126\u201335).\n\n\nOf course, Schmitt\u2019s analogy between the collective and the\nindividual interest in self-preservation papers over an important\ndifference between the two cases. A political community does not enjoy\nsimple biological existence. It might die though all of its individual\nmembers continue to live. The drawing of a friend-enemy distinction,\ntherefore, is never a mere reaction to a threat to a form of existence\nthat is already given (but see Mouffe 1999, 49\u201350). Rather, it actively\nconstitutes the political identity or existence of the people and\ndetermines who belongs to the people. To belong one must identify with\nthe substantive characteristic, whatever it may be, that marks the\nidentity of the people, and one must agree that this characteristic\ndefines a form of life for the preservation of which one ought to be\nwilling to sacrifice one\u2019s own life, in the fight against those who\ndon\u2019t belong (CP 46).\n\n\nSchmitt realizes, of course, that it is possible for people who are\nnot willing to identify in this way to be legally recognized as\ncitizens, and to live law-abidingly, under the norms authorized by\nsome positive constitution. Liberal states, in Schmitt\u2019s view, have a\ntendency to fail to distinguish properly between friends and enemies,\nand thus to extend rights of membership to those who do not truly\nbelong to the political nation. In a liberal state, Schmitt fears, the\npolitical nation will slowly whither and die as a result of spreading\nde-politicization, it will succumb to internal strife, or it will be\noverwhelmed by external enemies who are more politically united (CP\n69\u201379; L 31\u201377). To avert these dangers, Schmitt suggests,\nit is necessary to make sure that the boundaries of the political\nnation and the boundaries of citizenship coincide. This demand\nexplains Schmitt\u2019s claim, in the first sentence of The Concept of\nthe Political, that the concept of the state presupposes the\nconcept of the political (CP 19).  The point of this remark is that a\nstate can only be legitimate if its legal boundaries embody a clear\nfriend-enemy distinction.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this aim, Schmitt clearly implies, a sovereign\ndictator, acting in the interstices between two periods of positive\nconstitutional order, must homogenize the community by appeal to a\nclear friend-enemy distinction, as well as through the suppression,\nelimination, or expulsion of internal enemies who do not endorse that\ndistinction (CP 46\u20138). In so doing, the sovereign dictator expresses\nthe community\u2019s understanding of what is normal or exceptional and of\nwho belongs, and he creates the homogeneous medium that Schmitt\nconsiders to be a precondition of the legitimate applicability of law.\nSchmitt observes that his concept of the political is not belligerent.\nIt does not glorify war, but merely claims that a community that is\ninterested in living politically needs to be willing to go to war if it\nperceives its political existence to be threatened (CP 32\u20135). But the\nintended analogy with self-defence seems to make little moral sense,\ngiven that Schmitt\u2019s conception of political existence demands the\nactive elimination of those whom a majority perceives as internal\nenemies, and even celebrates that elimination as the essential activity\nof the popular sovereign.\n Schmitt\u2019s understanding of the political provides the basis for\nhis critique of liberalism (Holmes 1993, 37\u201360; McCormick 1997;\nDyzenhaus 1997, 58\u201370; Kahn 2011). On a descriptive level,\nSchmitt claims that liberalism has a tendency to deny the need for\ngenuine political decision, to suggest that it is neither necessary\nnor desirable for individuals to form groups that are constituted by\nthe drawing of friend-enemy distinctions. Liberals believe that there\nare no conflicts among human beings that cannot be solved to\neveryone\u2019s advantage through an improvement of civilization,\ntechnology, and social organization or be settled, after peaceful\ndeliberation, by way of amicable compromise. As a result, liberalism\nis unable to provide substantive markers of identity that can ground a\ntrue political decision. Liberal politics, consequently, boils down to\nthe attempt to domesticate the polity, in the name of the protection\nof individual freedom, but it is unable to constitute political\ncommunity in the first place (CP 69\u201379; CPD 33\u201350).\n If this is a correct account of the character of liberal ideology\nand of the aims of liberal politics, Schmitt is right to conclude that\nliberalism has a tendency to undermine a community\u2019s political\nexistence, as he understands it. But in order for this observation to\namount to a critique of liberalism, Schmitt needs to explain why a\nliberal subversion of the political would be undesirable. Schmitt\u2019s\npolitical works contain a number of rather different answers to this\nquestion. A first line of thought emphasizes, with appeal to Hobbes,\nthat a state can only be legitimate as long as it retains the capacity\nto offer protection to its members (for Schmitt\u2019s engagement with\nHobbes see McCormick 1994; Tralau 2011; and Schmitt\u2019s L; SM; VR). And\na state that has suffered a subversion of the political, induced by\nliberal ideology, Schmitt argues, will be unable to offer protection\nto its members, because it will fail to protect them from the indirect\nrule of pluralist interest-groups that have successfully colonized the\nstate (LL 17\u201336, L 65\u201377) and, more importantly, because\nit will lack the power to protect them from external enemies (CP\n51\u20133). If a people is no longer willing to decide between friend\nand enemy the most likely result will not be eternal peace but anarchy\nor subjection to another group that is still willing to assume the\nburdens of the political.  This first answer, however, is not\nSchmitt\u2019s last word on why liberal de-politicization is\nundesirable. Schmitt seems to admit that a global hegemon might one\nday be able to enforce a global de-politicization, by depriving all\nother communities of the capacity to draw their own friend-enemy\ndistinctions, or that liberalism might one day attain global cultural\nhegemony, such that people will no longer be interested in drawing\nfriend-enemy distinctions (CP 35, 57\u20138). Schmitt, then, cannot rest\nhis case against liberal de-politicization on the claim that it is an\nunrealistic goal. He needs to argue that it is undesirable even if it\ncould be achieved (Strauss 2007).\n\n\nSchmitt replies to this challenge that a life that does not involve\nthe friend-enemy distinction would be shallow, insignificant, and\nmeaningless. A completely de-politicized world would offer human\nbeings no higher purpose than to increase their consumption and to\nenjoy the frolics of modern entertainment. It would reduce politics to\na value-neutral technique for the provision of material amenities. As\na result, there would no longer be any project or value that\nindividuals are called upon to serve, whether they want to or not, and\nthat can give their life a meaning that transcends the satisfaction of\nprivate desires (CP 35, 57\u20138; RK 21\u20137; PR\n109\u201362; WS 85\u2013108). But that a world in which one does not have the\nopportunity to transcend one\u2019s interest in individual contentment in\nthe service of a higher value would be shallow and meaningless does\nnot suffice to establish that a willingness to kill or to die for a\npolitical community will confer meaning on a life, much less that it\nis the only thing that can do so.  When Schmitt claims that the\ndefence of the political is the only goal that could possibly justify\nthe killing of others and the sacrifice of one\u2019s own life (CP 35;\n48\u20139) he assumes without argument that the life of political\ncommunity, as he understands it, is uniquely and supremely\nvaluable.\n\n\nSome interpreters have explained Schmitt\u2019s hostility towards liberal\nde-politicization as being grounded in the view that a willingness to\ndistinguish between friend and enemy is a theological duty (Mehring\n1989; Meier 1998; Groh, 1991; Herrero 2015, 143\u2013177; Vatter 2016). Schmitt argues in Political\nTheology that all key concepts of the modern doctrine of the\nstate are secularized theological concepts, which suggests that a\npolitical theory that continues to use these concepts needs a\ntheological foundation (PT 36\u201352). In The Concept of the\nPolitical, Schmitt claims that all true political theorists base\ntheir views on a negative anthropology which holds that man is by\nnature evil and licentious, and thus needs to be kept in check by a\nstrong state capable of drawing a friend-enemy distinction if there is\nto be social order (CP 58\u201368). This latter thesis, Schmitt\nadmits, can take a secular form, as in Hobbes or Machiavelli, as the\npurely descriptive claim that man is inherently dangerous to man. But\nSchmitt suggests that this secular version of a negative political\nanthropology is open to be transformed into the view that man, though\nby nature dangerous, is perfectible or into the view that man\u2019s\ndangerous behavior is a mere contingent consequence of a mistaken form\nof social organization (PT 53\u201366; L 31\u20139). In order to\nestablish a permanent need for political authority, negative political\nanthropology must be given a theological reading that portrays the\ndangerous nature of man as an irrevocable result of original sin.\nLiberal de-politicization, from this perspective, is to be rejected as\na sign of human pride that rebels against God, who alone, but only at\nthe end of history, can deliver humanity from political enmity.\n\n\nSchmitt himself admits that the theological grounding of politics is\nbased on an anthropological confession of faith (CP 58). And one is\ntempted to say that Schmitt\u2019s theory turns out to be philosophically\nirrelevant if this is really the last word. Schmitt would likely have\nreplied that the liberal assumption that man is perfectible, that\nhumanity can overcome political enmity, and that to do so is desirable,\nis also an article of faith. The theological partisan of the political,\nin Schmitt\u2019s view, is as justified in practicing his creed as the\nliberal cosmopolitan and to engage in a deliberate cultivation of\npolitical enmity (CPD 65\u201376). As long as the political theologian can\nmake sure that the friend-enemy distinction survives, liberals will be\nforced to enter the arena of the political and to go to war against the\npartisans of the political. And this fight, Schmitt hopes, is going to\nsecure the continuing existence of political enmity and prevent the\nvictory of liberal de-politicization (CP 36\u20137).\n",
