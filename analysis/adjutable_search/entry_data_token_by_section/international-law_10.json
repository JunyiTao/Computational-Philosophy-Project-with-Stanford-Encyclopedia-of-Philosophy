    "main_text": "Legitimacy || Consent Theory\n4.2 Consent Theory\n\nOne prominent approach traces the legitimacy of international law to\nthe actual consent (explicit or implicit) of its subjects. States are\nbound by treaties insofar as they consent to them; meanwhile, states\nare bound by customary international law insofar as they have\nexplicitly (opinio juris) consented to its norms in the\nprocess of their formation, or else implicitly done so (e.g., by\nfailing persistently to object to them). One problem with the consent\ntheory is that international law includes norms that purport to bind\nstates independently of whether they consented to them, such as norms\nthat came into being before the state came into existence, or norms\nthat have achieved the status of jus cogens norms (Dworkin\n2013). In response, the steadfast defender of the consent view might\nreply, \u201cSo much the worse for the legitimacy of these\nnorms\u201d.\n\nEven if we were to accept this hard-line response, a deeper challenge\nremains: why, if international law can help us achieve vital\ngoals\u2014such as the avoidance of war, prevention of human rights\nabuses or the mitigation of climate change\u2014on condition that all\nstates generally comply with it, should its authority over them be\nsubject to their consent? The question is all the more pointed once it\nis recognized that the governments of many states do not themselves\nenjoy the consent of their own subjects or even perpetrate grave\ninjustices against them. Considerations such as these have led many to\nconclude that, contrary to received views, actual consent is not in\ngeneral a necessary condition for international law\u2019s legitimacy\nbut is, at best, an idea that plays an important but limited role in\nexplaining the bindingness of treaties. Nor, it has been argued, is\nactual consent generally a sufficient condition for legitimacy, since\nstate consent to treaties that require the commission of human rights\nabuses would not be even presumptively binding (Buchanan 2010;\nTasioulas 2010; Murphy 2017).\n\nOne familiar move is to resort to a hypothetical version of consent\ntheory, appealing not to the actual consent of states, but to\ninternational standards that states have good reason to accept. Such a\nview is propounded by Rawls in The Law of Peoples, which\nenvisions legitimate international law as grounded in principles\n(\u201cthe Law of Peoples\u201d) that would be endorsed in social\ncontracts at two levels: first, among liberal peoples as regulating\nforeign relations among themselves; second, among liberal peoples\ntogether with a sub-category of non-liberal peoples\u2014decent\nhierarchical peoples. Rawls\u2019 account, however, is problematic in\na number of ways. First, it presupposes that decent hierarchical\nprinciples enjoy legitimacy with respect to their own populations\ndespite not adhering to basic liberal rights, such as freedom of\nspeech and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex or religion.\nSecond, and relatedly, the doctrine of human rights embodied in the\nLaw of Peoples is very minimalist, excluding not only the\naforementioned rights, but also socio-economic rights such as the\nrights to health, work, and an adequate standard of living. Finally,\ndespite its minimalism, Rawls\u2019 Law of Peoples is ultimately\ngrounded in the perspective of liberal societies\u2014the only\nmembers of the Society of Peoples that are \u201cfully\nreasonable\u201d. But given that \u201creasonableness\u201d is\ndefined by stipulation as stemming from ideas implicit in liberal\ndemocratic culture, rather than by reference to an objectively true\ncriterion, the whole approach is vulnerable to accusations of\nparochialism. (For another attempt to mobilize Rawlsian approach to\ninternational legal legitimacy, with a focus on the great pluralism\nthat characterizes the international order, see Roth 2011:\nch.2\u20134).\n",
