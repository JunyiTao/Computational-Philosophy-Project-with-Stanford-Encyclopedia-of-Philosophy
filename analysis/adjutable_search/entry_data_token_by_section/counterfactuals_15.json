    "main_text": "Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence || Conditional Probability Analyses\n3.2 Conditional Probability Analyses\n\nWhile premise semantics has been prominent among linguists, probabilistic theories have been very prominent among philosophers thinking about knowledge and scientific explanation.[40] Adams (1965, 1975) made a seminal proposal in this literature:\n\nAdams\u2019 Thesis\nThe assertability of q if p is proportional to \\(P(q\\mid p)\\), where P is a probability function representing the agent\u2019s subjective credences\u2014see Definition  1.\n\n\nHowever, Adams (1970) was also aware\nthat indicative/subjunctive pairs\nlike (3)/(4)\ndiffer in their assertability. To explain this, he proposed\nthe prior probability analysis of\ncounterfactuals (Adams 1976):\n\nAdams\u2019 Prior Probability Analysis The\nassertability of \\(\\phi>\\psi\\) is proportional to\n\\(P_0(\\psi\\mid\\phi)\\), where \\(P_0\\) is the agent\u2019s credence\nprior to learning that \\(\\phi\\) was false.\n\n\nIt would seem that this analysis accurately predicts our intuitions\nin (45) about \\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\). Let\n\\(P_0\\) be an agent\u2019s credence before learning that Switch B is\ndown. (45a) requires that\n\\(P_0(\\mathsf{L}\\mid \\mathsf{A\\land B})\\) is (or is close to)\n1, (45b) requires that \\(P_0(\\mathsf{\\neg\nL}\\mid \\mathsf{\\neg A\\lor \\neg B})\\) is (or is close to) 1. The agent\nalso learns that Switch A is up, so \\(P_0(\\mathsf{A})\\) is (or is\nclose to) 1. All of this together seems to guarantee that\n\\(P_0(\\mathsf{B\\mid L})\\) is also very high. However, this is due to\nan inessential artifact of the example: the agent learned that Switch\nB was down after learning that Switch A is up. This detail\ndoes not matter to the intuition. As was seen with\nexample (43), we often hold fixed facts that\nhappen after the antecedent turns out false. Indeed, Adams\u2019\nPrior Probability Analysis makes the incorrect prediction\nthat (43) is unassertible in its natural\ncontext.\n\nThis problem for Adams\u2019 Prior Probability Analysis is addressed in Edgington (2003, 2004: 21) who amends the analysis: \\(P_0\\) may also reflect any facts the agent learns after they learn that the antecedent is false, provides that those facts are causally independent of the antecedent. This parallels the idea pursued by Schulz (2007: Ch.5) to integrate causal dependence into the analysis of counterfactuals. This idea was also pursued in a probabilistic framework by Kvart (1986, 1992). Kvart (1986, 1992), however, does not propose a prior probability analysis and does not regard the probabilities as subjective credences: they are instead objective probabilities (propensity or objective chance). Skyrms (1981) also proposes a propensity account, but pursues a prior propensity account analogous to the subjective one proposed by Adams (1976).\n\nObjective probability analyses have been popular among philosophers trying to capture the way that counterfactuals feature in physical explanations, and why they are so useful to agents like us in worlds like ours. Loewer (2007) is a good example of such an account, who grounds the truth of certain counterfactuals regarding our decisions like (46) in statistical mechanical probabilities.\n\n\n(46)\nIf I were to decide to bet on the coin\u2019s landing heads, then the chance I would win is 0.5\n\n Loewer (2007) proposes that (46) is true just in case (where \\(P_{\\textit{SM}}\\) is the statistical mechanical probability distribution and \\(M(t)\\) is a description of the macro-state of the universe at t): \n\n\n(47)\n\\(P_{\\textit{SM}}(W\\mid M(t)\\land D_1)=0.5\\)\n\nLoewer (2007) acknowledges that this analysis is limited to counterfactuals like (46). He argues that it can address the philosophical objections to the similarity analysis discussed in \u00a72.6, namely why counterfactuals are useful in scientific explanations, and for agents like us in a world like our own.\n\nConditional probability analyses do not proceed by assigning\ntruth-conditions to (all) counterfactuals. They instead associate them\nwith certain conditional\nprobabilities.[41] This makes it difficult to integrate the\ntheory into a comprehensive compositional semantics and logic for a\nnatural language. Kaufmann (2005 2008)\nmakes important advances here, but it remains an open issue for\nconditional probability analyses. Leitgeb\n(2012a,b) thoroughly develops a new conditional probability\nanalysis which regards \\(\\mathsf{\\phi>\\psi}\\) as true when the\nrelevant conditional probability is sufficiently\nhigh.[42] But\nconditional probability analyses have other limitations. Without\nfurther development, these analyses are limited in their ability to\nexplain how humans judge particular counterfactuals to be true. There\nis a large literature in psychology, beginning\nwith Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky 1982,\nshowing that human reasoning diverges in predictable way from precise\nprobabilistic reasoning. Even if these performance differences\ndidn\u2019t turn up in counterfactuals and conditional probabilities,\nthere is an implementation issue. As discussed\nin \u00a71.2.3, directly implementing\nprobabilistic knowledge makes unreasonable demands on memory. Bayesian\nNetworks are one proposed solution to this implementation issue. They\nare also used in the analysis of causal dependence\n(\u00a71.3), which conditional\nprobability analyses must appeal to anyway. Since Bayesian Networks\ncan also be used to directly formulate a semantics of counterfactuals,\nthey provide an worthwhile alternative to conditional probability\nanalyses despite proceeding from similar assumptions.\n",
