    "main_text": "Intergenerational Justice || Intertemporal Discounting\n3.2 Intertemporal Discounting\n\nThe focus of the previous subsection was on principles of\nintergenerational justice. Much of the literature on intergenerational\njustice and climate change has, however, engaged with economic\nanalyses of the impacts of climate change, and economic analyses tend\nto employ the concept of a social discount rate to specify how people\nshould treat future generations. Given this a comprehensive treatment\nof climate justice and future generations needs to discuss the concept\nof discounting (see entry on\n Frank Ramsey and intergenerational welfare economics).\n \n\nRoughly stated, social discount rates specify the extent to which\npersons should \u201cdiscount\u201d the future and should allocate\nresources to the current time as opposed to the future. The social\ndiscount rate has several component parts.\n\nTime Discounting. One important component is \u201ctime\ndiscounting\u201d: this involves allocating less moral weight to a\nperson\u2019s well-being the further into the future it is. Many\nphilosophers have been highly critical of this approach, arguing that\nit is objectionable to discriminate against people on the basis of\nwhen they are alive. That, it is argued, penalises people for a\nproperty that lacks any moral significance (Caney 2014b:\n323\u2013327; Parfit 1984: 480\u2013486; Rawls 1999: 259\u2013262).\nOthers would demur, and some have offered communitarian defences of\nspecial obligations to those who are temporally near (de Shalit\n1995).\n\nGrowth Discounting. A second important component is what\nNordhaus calls \u201cgrowth discounting\u201d (1997: 317). The idea\nhere is clearly stated by the economist Nicholas Stern, who writes\nthat we \n\n\nshould discount the consumption of future generations on the basis\nthat they are likely to be richer than ourselves. This reason for\ndiscounting is, and should be, part of most models. (Stern 2008: 14)\n\n\n\nClearly what position one takes on this will depend on whether one\nadopts a broadly egalitarian position on intergenerational justice or\nnot. If one thinks that egalitarian commitments should inform our\npolicies towards future generations, and, if one thinks that those\nalive in the future will be wealthier (a crucial assumption that one\nmight at least query) then there is a case for growth discounting. So\none\u2019s verdict on growth discounting will depend on the nature of\none\u2019s principle of intergenerational justice (sufficiency,\nequality, priority, Llavador et al.\u2019s formulation and so on) as\nwell as empirical assumptions about future growth (and one\u2019s\nattitude to risk and uncertainty).\n",
