Position in the History of Philosophy\n\nAlthough Gregory of Rimini has received considerable attention from\nhistorians of medieval thought, understanding his position in the\nhistory of philosophy has been made difficult by several problems that\nhave plagued the historiography of fourteenth-century scholasticism.\nHe flourished at a time that has been judged by historians as on the\nwhole decadent, fideistic, and radically skeptical, in contrast to the\nperiod in which, for example, Thomas Aquinas worked (d. 1274); this\nhistorical viewpoint already made difficult an objective evaluation of\nRimini. Historians also labeled Gregory a \u201cnominalist,\u201d a\nterm so broad and vague when applied to fourteenth-century thinkers\nthat, when it was used without qualification, it tended to mislead and\nto obscure the differences among them, as for example between Ockham\nand Gregory. Finally, unlike Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns\nScotus, Gregory was active in a relatively understudied period, so\nthat placing Gregory in his context is difficult and statements about\nGregory\u2019s originality are precarious. The history of\nGregory\u2019s own University of Paris in the quarter century before\nhis Sentences lectures, in contrast to that of Oxford in the\nsame years, is particularly unclear. Few scholars realize, moreover,\nthat from the 1330s until the onset of the Great Schism in 1378,\ndecades when the traditional leaders of European thought, the\nFranciscans and Dominicans, were in decline, Gregory was the leading\nlight in an era in which his own Augustinian Order dominated, with\nsuch towering figures as Thomas of Strasbourg, Alphonsus Vargas of\nToledo, and Hugolino of Orvieto, and a number of other important\nauthors. Only careful diachronic studies of specific philosophical\nproblems can provide a precise picture of Gregory\u2019s role in the\nhistory of philosophy, and few such studies have been accomplished\nthus far. There are some, however, and natural philosophy,\nepistemology, foreknowledge, and predestination are examples of topics\nabout which we know quite a bit (see below).\n\nGenerally, what has been learned so far is that Gregory was really the\nfirst to introduce to the University of Paris the exciting ideas\ndeveloped at English schools between William of Ockham (ca. 1319) and\nThomas Bradwardine (ca. 1344). Beginning with Gregory the names of\nAdam Wodeham, Richard Fitzralph, Walter Chatton, William Heytesbury,\nThomas Buckingham, Richard Kilvington, Robert Halifax and others\nbecame common knowledge among Parisian scholars. Gregory was also\ndeeply influenced by recent thinkers at his own university, both\nnegatively and positively. The impact of Peter Auriol has long been\nrecognized to be great, but recent studies have made clear that other\nfigures, such as Francis of Marchia, Thomas of Strasbourg, Gerard\nOdonis, and Michael of Massa, had an influence on Gregory. The\nquestion of Gregory\u2019s relationship to his Parisian predecessors\nneeds to be investigated more fully.\n\nMore clear is Gregory\u2019s importance in the late Middle Ages and\nReformation, even if much of this period has received relatively\nlittle attention. Gregory\u2019s impact is obvious, because many\nscholastics after 1350 copied large passages from his works, including\nsuch prominent figures as the Cistercian James of Eltville, Pierre\nd\u2019Ailly, and Henry of Langenstein. Other important thinkers,\nsuch as Hugolino of Orvieto OESA, the Cistercian Pierre Ceffons,\nMarsilius of Inghen, and Peter of Candia OFM (Pope Alexander V) knew\nGregory\u2019s ideas well and cited them often. Few if any\nphilosophers in the later fourteenth century can have been unaffected\nby his ideas, and for many he was their main inspiration.\nGregory\u2019s impact both inside and outside the Augustinian Order\ncontinued into the fifteenth century. The common Sentences\ncommentary (the so-called Quaestiones communes) of the\nUniversity of Vienna in the first half of the century was largely\nbased directly or indirectly on Gregory\u2019s thought, often\nduplicating his words (see recently, Schabel 2020). In the celebrated\nquarrel over future contingents at the University of Louvain\n(1465\u20131474), several of the participants cited Gregory\u2019s\nposition or even adopted it without attribution. Of course, the fact\nthat only books I and II of Gregory\u2019s commentary circulated\nmeans that Gregory\u2019s direct impact is to be found in topics\ndiscussed in those books rather than in issues covered in books III\nand IV, such as the Immaculate Conception and the Eucharist, which had\ntheir own philosophical sub-issues.\n\nPerhaps the most central element of Gregory of Rimini\u2019s thought\nand influence is his adherence to Augustine and the nature of that\nadherence. For one thing, Gregory simply read Augustine more carefully\nand extensively than most previous thinkers, and so, for example,\nGregory was able to attack Peter Auriol for his faulty citations and\nquotations of Augustine. Gregory\u2019s interest in the works of\nAugustine has been seen as central to the development of a\n\u201chistorico-critical\u201d method in philosophical theology,\nespecially in the Augustinian Order, partly foreshadowing modern\nscholarly methods. In connection with this historico-critical method,\nGregory was part of a general attempt to establish reliable texts of\nAugustine and to separate authentic works from the pseudo-Augustinian\ncorpus. Quotations from Augustine, moreover, were cited with great\naccuracy and detail in Gregory\u2019s writings, and so his\nSentences commentary, when not plagiarized for his own ideas,\nwas often used as a source for Augustinian quotations (Trapp\n1956).\n\nNot surprisingly, Gregory\u2019s ideas are often Augustinian.\nGregory\u2019s brand of doctrinal Augustinianism, influenced rather\nby the Franciscan and Oxonian tradition than the more Dominican (and\nParisian) variety of Giles of Rome, soon dominated the Augustinian\nHermits\u2019 philosophy and theology. Thus by the early 16th century\nAegidistae and Gregoriistae schools of thought\nexisted, and a recognized via Gregorii was present in many\nuniversities such as Wittenberg, the university of Gregory\u2019s\nfellow Augustinian Hermit Martin Luther (McGrath 1987). The fact that\nGregory\u2019s extreme Augustinian views on predestination became\nvirtually official doctrine at the University of Vienna, and each book\nof his Sentences commentary was printed six times between\n1482 and 1532, further helps explain why some of Gregory\u2019s ideas\noften resemble those of Luther and Jean Calvin. Gregory\u2019s\nthought had a life after the reformation, perhaps influencing\nFrancisco Suarez, but certainly having an impact on\nseventeenth-century debates over such topics as predestination.\n\nA list of Gregory\u2019s philosophical positions would perhaps not be\ndifficult to make, and neither would it be hard to describe his\nrelation to Ockham on various topics (e.g. Smith 1999, Mandrella\n2016). In natural philosophy, for example, in agreement with Ockham,\nGregory was a nominalist and employed \u201cOckham\u2019s\u201d\nrazor in denying that sudden change, motion, and time are independent\nentities (Brown 1998b). Gregory also claims that the world could have\nbeen eternal. But in this case one would like to know better the\nstances of Gregory\u2019s immediate predecessors, especially\nParisians like Francis of Marchia, in order to determine the possible\nsources and degree of originality of Gregory\u2019s ideas. On the\neternity of the world, for example, Gregory\u2019s view was not very\nstrange in his day. Otherwise, a list of Gregory\u2019s ideas is just\nthat, a mere list. Consequently the focus here shall be on a few of\nthe issues on which the theories of Gregory and his predecessors have\nbeen investigated in some depth.\n",
