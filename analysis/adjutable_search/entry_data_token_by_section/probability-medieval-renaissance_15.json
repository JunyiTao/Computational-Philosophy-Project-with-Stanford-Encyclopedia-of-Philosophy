    "main_text": "Probability in the Renaissance\n5. Probability in the Renaissance\n\nThe Renaissance is considered here as a cultural movement which\nbridged two historical epochs, the Middle Ages and early modernity.\nThere is notorious disagreement on the temporal boundaries of the\nRenaissance. One familiar view is that it covers the period from the\nmiddle of the fourteenth century to the end of the sixteenth. The\nRenaissance is closely linked to the rise of humanism as a style of\nthought, and humanism is often conceived of as a rival and antagonist\nof scholasticism. Recent scholarship has found less clear-cut\nboundaries between humanism and scholasticism than were formerly\nassumed, and this is also true for humanist and scholastic uses of\nprobability-related terms. The whole range of Latin\nprobability-related words was used by Renaissance humanists and\nmedieval scholastics alike, with roughly similar meanings based on\nancient precedent. In the period from 1200\u20131500, there were no\ngreat debates on probability; and what Renaissance authors, like their\ncontemporaries, had to say about the subject fills a few lines at most\nin their works. Nonetheless, the differences between humanist and\nscholastic uses of probability should be noted.\n\nHumanist concern with probability was largely stimulated by attempts\nto clarify the relationship between rhetoric and dialectic. A second,\nbut related, field in which probability-terms became important for\nhumanists was the translation, recovery, and interpretation of ancient\ntexts, such as Aristotle\u2019s Topics or Quintilian\u2019s\nInstitutio oratoria. Yet the renewed attention to the texts\nof Cicero and Quintilian, or those of Aristotle\u2019s Greek\ncommentators, in the fifteenth century does not seem to have produced\nan immediate challenge to scholastic usages of probability. In\ngeneral, the terms probabilis or probabilitas appear\nto have been less central for humanists than for scholastic (moral)\ntheology and jurisprudence. Many humanists prolifically used the word\nprobabilis, but some shunned it and spoke instead of\nworthiness of belief (credibilitas). This may often signal\nnot much more than a predilection for the Latin of some ancient\nauthor. A contrast to scholastic usage can at best be expected from\nauthors who intended to make a break with scholastic dialectic such as\nLorenzo Valla and Rudolph Agricola (Mack 1993, 31, 146; Nauta 2009,\n233; Spranzi-Zuber 2011, 65).\n\nLorenzo Valla (Repastinatio, 253) attacked scholastic\ndialectic, referring to worthiness of belief and belief-worthy things\n(credibilia) rather than to probability and\nprobabilia. He follows Quintilian\u2019s (the complete text\nof the Institutio oratoria was rediscovered in the\nLatin West in 1416) division of belief-worthiness into very firm\n(firmissimum), strongly disposed (propensius), and\nnot ill-disposed (non\n repugnans).[47]\n Credibility and truth-likeness are also related to the modal category\nof possibility. Valla assumes degrees of possibility. Something can be\nvery or slightly possible. Only propositions qualified as very\npossible were worthy of belief and truth-like (verisimilis).\nIn this context, Valla never once uses the word probabilis.\nBut he approvingly quotes Cicero\u2019s connection of argumentation\nwith probable (probabilis) invention in Book 3 of his\nRepastinatio dialecticae, where he gets down to dialectic and\nlogic after much previous analysis of language. On the whole,\nValla\u2019s probability-related concepts do not seem to differ too\nstarkly from the semantic and proto-frequentist notions of probability\n(or belief-worthiness) which he shared with the scholastics.\n\nRudolph Agricola, another humanist innovator, put the word\nprobabilis center stage in his path-breaking reinterpretation\nof dialectic. For him, dialectic was the art of speaking with\nprobability on whatever issue. This definition appears traditional\nenough, but Agricola (De inventione dialectica, 210)\nexplicitly distanced himself from Aristotle\u2019s endoxon\nas the basis for probability in dialectic. As has been noted by modern\nscholars, \u201cspeaking with probability\u201d is a feature of a\nprocess for Agricola rather than one grounded in a property of\npropositions used in a dialectical syllogism. Probability arises from\nthe argumentative quality (argumentosus), aptness\n(aptus), and fittingness (consentaneus) of a\nreasoning process (Agricola, De inventione dialectica, 210,\n306; Mack 1993, 170; Spranzi-Zuber 2011, 89). This directs dialectic\naway from the reliance on authority implied by Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of reputable opinion. It is also significant that Valla and\nAgricola focus on the production of conviction (fides)\ninstead of mere opinion. They thus seem to call for more rhetorical\npersuasion or for higher epistemological standards in\ndialectic\u2019s quest for truth. It is difficult, however, to\ndevelop an uncontentious interpretation of what Agricola exactly meant\nby his peculiar, but undoubtedly influential, view of probability. In\nsixteenth-century century humanist discourse on probability,\nAgricola\u2019s dialectic was a key innovation, as were the new\ninterest in Aristotle\u2019s Topics, the rise of a\nProtestant tradition of dialectic, and much more. Together with\nadvancements in early modern scholasticism, these developments provide\na justification for ending the present survey around 1500.\n",
