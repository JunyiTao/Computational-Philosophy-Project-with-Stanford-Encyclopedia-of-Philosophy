    "main_text": "Other Logics || Non-classical Logics\n3.2 Non-classical Logics\n\nNon-classical logics (Haack 1978) such as modal logics, intuitionsitic\nlogic, multi-valued logics, autoepistemic logics, non-monotonic\nreasoning, commonsense and default reasoning, relevance logic,\nparaconsistent logic, and so on, have been increasingly gaining the\nattention of the automated reasoning community. One of the reasons has\nbeen the natural desire to extend automated deduction techniques to\nnew domains of logic. Another reason has been the need to mechanize\nnon-classical logics as an attempt to provide a suitable foundation\nfor artificial intelligence. A third reason has been the desire to\nattack some problems that are combinatorially too large to be handled\nby paper and pencil. Indeed, some of the work in automated\nnon-classical logic provides a prime example of automated reasoning\nprograms at work. To illustrate, the Ackerman Constant Problem asks\nfor the number of non-equivalent formulas in the relevance logic R.\nThere are actually 3,088 such formulas (Slaney 1984) and the number\nwas found by \u201csandwiching\u201d it between a lower and an upper\nlimit, a task that involved constraining a vast universe of\n20400 20-element models in search of those models that\nrejected non-theorems in R. It is safe to say that this result would\nhave been impossible to obtain without the assistance of an automated\nreasoning program.\n\nThere have been three basic approaches to automate the solving of\nproblems in non-classical logic (McRobie 1991). One approach has been,\nof course, to try to mechanize the non-classical deductive calculi.\nAnother has been to simply provide an equivalent formulation of the\nproblem in first-order logic and let a classical theorem prover handle\nit. A third approach has been to formulate the semantics of the\nnon-classical logic in a first-order framework where resolution or\nconnection-matrix methods would apply. (Pelletier et al.\n2017) describes an automated reasoning system for a paraconsistent\nlogic that takes both \u201cindirect\u201d approaches, the\ntranslational and the truth-value approach, to prove its theorems.\nModal logic\n\nModal logics find extensive use in computing science as logics of\nknowledge and belief, logics of programs, and in the specification of\ndistributed and concurrent systems. Thus, a program that automates\nreasoning in a modal logic such as K, K4, T, S4, or S5 would have\nimportant applications. With the exception of S5, these logics share\nsome of the important metatheoretical results of classical logic, such\nas cut-elimination, and hence cut-free (modal) sequent calculi can be\nprovided for them, along with techniques for their automation.\nConnection methods (Andrews 1981, Bibel 1981) have played an important\nrole in helping to understand the source of redundancies in the search\nspace induced by these modal sequent calculi and have provided a\nunifying framework not only for modal logics but also for\nintuitionistic and classical logic as well (Wallen 1990). Current\nefforts to automate modal logic reasoning revolve around the\ntranslational approach mentioned above, namely to embed modal logic\ninto classical logic and then use an existing automated reasoning\nsystem for the latter to prove theorems of the former.\n(Benzm\u00fcller & Paulson 2013) shows how to embed quantified modal\nlogic into simple type theory, proves the soundness and completeness\nof the embedding, and demonstrates with simple experiments how\nexisting higher-order theorem provers can be used to automate proofs\nin modal logic. The approach can be extended to higher-order modal\nlogic as well (Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo 2015).\nIntuitionistic logic\n\nThere are different ways in which intuitionsitic logic can be\nautomated. One is to directly implement the intuitionistic versions of\nGentzen\u2019s sequent and natural deduction calculi, LJ and NJ\nrespectively. This approach inherits the stronger normalization\nresults enjoyed by these calculi allowing for a more compact\nmechanization than their classical counterparts. Another approach at\nmechanizing intuitionistic logic is to exploit its semantic\nsimilarities with the modal logic S4 and piggy back on an automated\nimplementation of S4. Automating intuitionistic logic has applications\nin software development since writing a program that meets a\nspecification corresponds to the problem of proving the specification\nwithin an intuitionistic logic (Martin-L\u00f6f 1982). A system that\nautomated the proof construction process would have important\napplications in algorithm design but also in constructive mathematics.\nNuprl (Constable et al. 1986) is a computer system supporting\na particular mathematical theory, namely constructive type theory, and\nwhose aim is to provide assistance in the proof development process.\nThe focus is on logic-based tools to support programming and on\nimplementing formal computational mathematics. Over the years the\nscope of the Nuprl project has expanded from\n\u201cproofs-as-programs\u201d to \u201csystems-as-theories\u201d.\nSimilar in spirit and based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism, the Coq\nsystem formalizes its proofs in the Calculus of Inductive\nConstructions, a \u03bb-calculus with a rich system of types\nincluding dependent types (Coquand & Huet 1988, Coquand &\nPaulin-Mohring 1988). Like Nuprl, Coq is designed to assist in the\ndevelopment of mathematical proofs as well as computer programs from\ntheir formal specifications.\n",
