    "main_text": "Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results || A Philosophical Account\n1.3 A Philosophical Account\n\nRadder (1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012) distinguishes three types of\nreproducibility. One is the reproducibility of what Radder calls an\nexperiment\u2019s material realization. Using one of\nRadder\u2019s own examples as an illustration, two people may carry\nout the same actions to measure the mass of an object. Despite doing\nthe same actions, person A regards themselves as measuring the\nobject\u2019s Newtonian mass while person B regards themselves\nas measuring the object\u2019s Einsteinian mass. Here, then, the\nactions or material realization of the experimental procedure can be\nreproduced, but the theoretical descriptions of their significance\ndiffer. Radder, however, does not specify what is required for one\nmaterial realisation to be a reproduction of another, a pertinent\nquestion, especially since, as Radder himself affirms, no reproduction\nwill be exactly the same as any other reproduction (1996:\n82\u201383).\n\nA second type of reproducibility is the reproducibility of an\nexperiment, given a fixed theoretical description. For\nexample, a social scientist might conduct two experiments to examine\nsocial conformity. In one experiment, a young child might be\ninstructed to give an answer to a question before a group of other\nchildren who are, unknown to the former child, instructed to give\nwrong answers to the same question. In another experiment, an adult\nmight be instructed to give an answer to a question before a group of\nother adults who are, unknown to the former adult, instructed to give\nwrong answers to the same question. If the child and the adult give a\nwrong answer that conforms to the answers of others, then the social\nscientist might interpret the result as exemplifying social\nconformity. For Radder, the theoretical description of the experiment\nmight be fixed, specifying that if some people in a\nparticipant\u2019s surroundings give intentionally false answers to\nthe question, then the genuine participant will conform to the\nbehaviour of their peers. However, the material realization of these\nexperiments differs insofar as one concerns children and the other\nadults. It is difficult to see how, in this example at least, this\ndiffers from what either Schmidt or G\u00f3mez, Juristo, and Vegas\nwould refer to as establishing generalizability to a different\npopulation (Schmidt\u2019s [2009]\n Class 3\n and\n Function 5;\n G\u00f3mez, Juristo, and Vegas\u2019s [2010]\n way 5\n and\n Function 4).\n\nThe third kind of reproducibility is what Radder calls\nreplicability. This is where experimental procedures differ\nto produce the same experimental result (otherwise known as a\nsuccessful replication). For example, Radder notes that multiple\nexperiments might obtain the result \u201ca fluid of type f\nhas a boiling point b\u201d, despite having different kinds of\nthermometers by which to measure this boiling point (2006:\n113\u2013114).\n\nSchmidt (2009) points out that the difference between Radder\u2019s\nsecond and third types of reproducibility is small in comparison to\ntheir differences to the first type. He consequently suggests his\nalternative distinction between direct and conceptual replication,\npresumably intending a conceptual replication to cover Radder\u2019s\nsecond and third types.\n\nIn summary, whilst G\u00f3mez, Juristo, and Vegas\u2019s typology\ndraws distinctions in slightly different places to Schmidt\u2019s,\nits purpose is arguably the same\u2014to explain what types of\nalterations in replication studies fulfil different scientific goals,\nsuch as establishing internal validity or the extent of generalization\nand so on. With the exception of his discussion of reproducing the\nmaterial realization, Radder\u2019s other two categories can perhaps\nbe seen as fitting within the larger range of functions described by\nSchmidt and G\u00f3mez et al., who both acknowledge that in\npractice, direct and conceptual replications lie on a noisy continuum.\n\n",
