    "main_text": "Space and time\n8. Space and time\n\nConsidering whether space and time are infinite in extent and\ndivisibility has led to many famous puzzles, paradoxes and antimonies.\nIt was on account of such paradoxes that Kant was led to the claim\nthat whether space is finite or infinite escapes any possible\nempirical determination. Kant\u2019s presentation of the antinomies\nrested on a number of assumptions (such as the distinction between\ninfinite and unbounded) that were undermined by later results in\nmathematics or were simply found to be philosophically questionable.\nAnother interesting paradox relates to divisibility. In this section\nwe discuss Kant on the antinomies of space and time and a\nmeasure-theoretic solution to this paradox of divisibility. This is\nfollowed by a quick overview of some developments in non-Euclidean\ngeometries and relativistic cosmology. In the final part, we mention\nsome recent developments in cosmic topology, an area of cosmology that\nattempts to determine whether space is finite or infinite by a\ncombination of empirical observation and mathematical theorizing. The\nemphasis will be on the latter aspect.\n",
