    "main_text": "Faith as belief\n5. Faith as belief\n\nIf faith is not \u2018firm and certain\u2019 basic knowledge of\ntheistic truths, then a model of faith as having a propositional\nobject may still be retained by identifying faith with belief\nof relevant content\u2014and the question whether a faith-belief may\nhave sufficient justification to count (if true) as (non-basic)\nknowledge may remain open. To have theist faith might thus be\nidentified with holding a belief with theological content\u2014that\nGod exists, is benevolent towards us, has a plan of salvation,\netc.\u2014where this belief is also held with sufficient firmness and\nconviction. Richard Swinburne labels this the \u2018Thomist\nview\u2019 of faith, and expresses it thus: \u2018The person of\nreligious faith is the person who has the theoretical conviction that\nthere is a God\u2019 (Swinburne 2005, 138). (Aquinas\u2019s own\nunderstanding of faith is more complex than this formulation suggests,\nhowever, as will be noted shortly.)\n\nThe rationality of faith on this model will rest on the rationality of\nthe firmly held theological beliefs in which it consists. As Swinburne\nnotes, if such beliefs are founded on evidence that renders their\ntruth sufficiently more probable than not, then the beliefs concerned\nmay amount to knowledge on a contemporary \u2018justified true\nbelief\u2019 fallibilist epistemology, even though they fall short of\nknowledge on Aquinas\u2019s own criteria, which require that what is\nknown be \u2018seen\u2019 (i.e., fully and directly comprehended)\n(Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 4 & 5 (Aquinas 1265\u20131273\n[2006], 27)). In any case, the reasonableness of faith on this model\nof faith as (non-basic) theological belief depends on the beliefs\nconcerned being adequately evidentially justified. The claim that this\ncondition is satisfied is defended by John Locke in The\nReasonableness of Christianity (1695 [1999]), and, in\ncontemporary philosophy, by Richard Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\napproach to the epistemology of Christian belief (see, for example,\nSwinburne 2003).\n\nSome argue, however, that the truth of theism is \u2018evidentially\nambiguous\u2019\u2014that is, that our total available evidence is\nequally viably interpreted from both a theist and a naturalist/atheist\nperspective (Hick 1966 and 1989; Davis 1978; Penelhum 1995; McKim\n2001). This thesis of evidential ambiguity may be supported as the\nbest explanation of the diversity of belief on religious matters,\nand/or of the persistence of the debate about theism, with\nphilosophers of equal acumen and integrity engaged on either side. Or\nthe ambiguity may be considered systematic\u2014for example, on the\ngrounds that both natural theological and natural atheological\narguments fail because they are deeply circular, resting on implicit\nassumptions acceptable only to those already thinking within the\nrelevant perspective. (In relation to Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\nnatural theology, in particular, this objection surfaces in criticism\nof assumptions about how to set the prior probabilities implicated in\ncalculations of, for example, theism\u2019s probability on the\nevidence of the \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 of the Universe\u2019s\nbasic physical constants, or of the probability, on all our evidence,\nof the truth of the Resurrection.) If the ambiguity thesis is correct,\nthen\u2014assuming evidentialism\u2014firmly held theistic belief\nwill fail to be reasonable.\n\nOn this model of faith as non-basic belief, all that characterizes\nfaith apart from its theological content is the firmness or conviction\nwith which faith-propositions are held true. Firm belief in the truth\nof a scientific theoretical proposition, for example, fails to count\nas faith only through lacking the right kind of content. This\nmodel therefore shares with the Reformed epistemologist model in\ntaking its theological content as essential to what makes theistic\nfaith faith, and so rejects the suggestion that faith of the\nsame sort as found in the theist religious traditions might also be\nfound elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, in taking faith to consist in non-basic belief that\ntheological propositions are true, this model invites the assumption\nthat theological convictions belong in the same category of factual\nclaims as scientific theoretical hypotheses with which they\naccordingly compete. That assumption will lead those who think that\ntheological claims are not reasonably accepted on the\nevidence to regard faith as worthless and intellectually\ndishonourable\u2014at best, \u2018a degenerating research\nprogramme\u2019 (Lakatos 1970). (On this negative assessment of\nfaith\u2019s evidential support, persons of faith come perilously\nclose to the schoolboy\u2019s definition mentioned by William James:\n\u2018Faith is when you believe something that you know ain\u2019t\ntrue\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 29]). Or, if persons who have theistic\nfaith readily abandon theological explanations whenever competing\nscientific ones succeed, their God gets reduced to \u2018the God of\nthe gaps\u2019.) These misgivings about the model of faith as firmly\nheld factual theological belief dissolve, of course, if success\nattends the project of showing that particular theological claims\ncount as factual hypotheses well supported by the total available\nevidence. Those who doubt that this condition is or can be met may,\nhowever, look towards a model of faith that understands faith\u2019s\ncognitive content as playing some other role than that of an\nexplanatory hypothesis of the same kind as a scientific explanatory\nhypothesis.\n\nAquinas\u2019s account of faith\n\nThough firmly held theological belief is central to it,\nAquinas\u2019s understanding of faith is more complicated and nuanced\nthan the view that faith is \u2018the theoretical conviction that God\nexists\u2019. Aquinas holds that faith is \u2018midway between\nknowledge and opinion\u2019 (Summa Theologiae 2a2ae 1, 2\n(Aquinas [2006], 11)). Faith resembles knowledge, Aquinas thinks, in\nso far as faith carries conviction. But that conviction is not well\ndescribed as \u2018theoretical\u2019, if that description suggests\nthat faith has a solely propositional object. For Aquinas,\nfaith denotes the believer\u2019s fundamental orientation towards the\ndivine. So \u2018from the perspective of the reality believed\nin\u2019, Aquinas says, \u2018the object of faith is something\nnon-composite\u2019 (hence, definitely not\npropositional)\u2014namely God himself. Nevertheless, grasping the\ntruth of propositions is essential to faith, because\n\u2018from the perspective of the one believing \u2026 the\nobject of faith is something composite in the form of a\nproposition\u2019 (Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 1, 2 (Aquinas\n[2006], 11 & 13), our emphases).\n\nA further problem with describing as Thomist a model of faith simply\nas firm belief that certain theological propositions are true is that\nAquinas takes as central an act of \u2018inner assent\u2019\n(Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 2, 1 (Aquinas [2006],\n59\u201365)). This is problematic because, (i) in its dominant\ncontemporary technical usage belief is taken to be a mental\n(intentional) state\u2014a propositional attitude, namely,\nthe attitude towards the relevant proposition that it is true; (ii)\nbelief in this contemporary sense is widely agreed not to be under\nvolitional control\u2014not directly, anyway; yet (iii) Aquinas holds\nthat the assent given in faith is under the control of the will.\nAquinas need not, however, be construed as accepting \u2018believing\nat will\u2019, since assent may be construed as an act that has to be\nelicited yet terminates a process that is subject to the will\u2014a\nprocess of inquiry, deliberation or pondering that involves mental\nactions, or, in the case of theist faith, a process of divine grace\nthat can proceed only if it is not blocked by the will.\n\nMost importantly, however, Aquinas says that assent is given to the\npropositional articles of faith because their truth is revealed by\nGod, and on the authority of the putative source of this\nrevelation. Terence Penelhum puts it like this: \u2018Thomas tells us\nthat although what one assents to in faith includes many items not\nostensibly about God himself, one assents to them, in faith, because\nthey are revealed by God \u2026 It is because they come from him and\nbecause they lead to him that the will disposes the intellect to\naccept them\u2019 (Penelhum 1989, 122: see Summa Theologiae,\n2a2ae, 1, 1 & 2 (Aquinas [2006], 5\u201315)). So, Aquinas\u2019s\nmodel of faith is of believing (assenting to) propositional\ntruth-claims on the basis of testimony carrying divine\nauthority. John Locke follows the same model: \u2018Faith\n\u2026 is the assent to any proposition \u2026 upon the credit of\nthe proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way of\ncommunication\u2019 (Locke 1698 [1924, 355]; compare also Alston\n1996, 15).\n\nThe unanswered question of entitlement\u2014again\n\nTheist faith as assent to truths on the basis of an authoritative\nsource of divine revelation is possible, though, only for those\nwho already believe that God exists and is revealed through\nthe relevant sources. Might such faith, then, have to rest on a\nprior faith\u2014faith that God exists and that\nthis is God\u2019s messenger or vehicle of communication?\nThose foundational claims, it might be maintained, are held true on\nthe grounds of adequately supporting evidence, such as putatively\nprovided by arguments of natural theology and the claimed evidence for\nmiraculous endorsement of a prophet\u2019s authority. Theist faith\nmight then have a purely rational foundation. But this could hardly be\nso for every person of faith, since not everyone who believes\nwill have access to the relevant evidence or be able to assess it\nproperly. Besides, and more importantly, although Aquinas allows that\nrational assessment of the available evidence may lead a person to\nfaith, he does not think that such an assessment could ever elicit\nassent itself\u2014only demonstration could achieve that and so high\na level of proof is not here available (see Aquinas [2006], footnote\n2b, 58\u20139). Aquinas\u2019s view is thus that all\nbelievers stand in need of God\u2019s grace: \u2018the assent of\nfaith, which is its principal act \u2026 has as its cause God,\nmoving us inwardly through grace\u2019 (Summa Theologiae,\n2a2ae 6, 1 (Aquinas [2006], 167)). It follows, then, that, on\nAquinas\u2019s view, believing that God exists and is revealed in\nspecific ways is itself a matter of faith, and not a purely\nrationally evidentially secured prolegomenon to it.\n\nAquinas\u2019s model of faith thus shares with the Reformed\nepistemologist model the problem that it leaves unanswered the\nreflective believer\u2019s concern about entitlement. Attempting to\nsettle that concern by meeting the evidential requirement leads to\ncircularity: theological truths are to be accepted on divine\nauthority, yet the truth that there is such an\nauthority (historically mediated as the relevant tradition\nmaintains) is amongst those very truths that are to be accepted on\ndivine authority\u2014indeed, it is the crucial one. As Descartes\nputs it in the Dedication to his Meditations, \u2018It is of\ncourse quite true that we must believe in the existence of God because\nit is a doctrine of Holy Scripture, and conversely, that we must\nbelieve Holy Scripture because it comes from God. \u2026 But this\nargument cannot be put to unbelievers because they would judge it to\nbe circular\u2019 (Descartes 1641 [Cottingham et al. 1984, 3]). Thus,\nalthough they differ on the question whether the firm beliefs of faith\ncount as knowledge, both Aquinas and Calvin understand faith as\nessentially involving accepting the truth of propositions as revealed\nthrough willingly receiving God\u2019s gracious gift of that very\nrevelation. The question remains how accepting this gift could be\nepistemically rational. The externalist account of how Christian\nbeliefs may have epistemic worth proposed in Plantinga\u2019s model\nof faith (named \u2018the A/C\u2019 model because its sources are\nsupposedly found in Aquinas as well as Calvin) offers some help with\nthe required explanation, but (as noted in the final paragraph of\nSection 4 above) may arguably not by itself be sufficient.\n\nRevelation\u2014and its philosophical critique\n\nThe reasonableness of belief that God exists is a focal issue in the\nPhilosophy of Religion. Theist traditions typically, or some would say\nessentially, make a foundational claim about an authoritative source,\nor sources, of revealed truth. What is salient includes belief or some\nrelated sort of affirmation, not just that God exists but associated\ncontent such as that this God exists, the God who is revealed\nthus and so (in great historical acts, in prophets, in scriptures, in\nwisdom handed down, etc.). The reasonableness of theism is therefore\nas much a matter of the reasonableness of an epistemology of\nrevelation as it is of a metaphysics of perfect being. The question of\nhow God may be expected to make himself known has gained prominence\nthrough recent discussion of the argument for atheism from\n\u2018divine hiddenness\u2019 (Schellenberg 1993; Howard-Snyder and\nMoser 2002). That argument holds that a loving God would make his\nexistence clear to the non-resistant\u2014but this claim is open to\nquestion. Perhaps God provides only \u2018secret\u2019 evidence of\nhis existence, purposely overturning the expectations of our\n\u2018cognitive idolatry\u2019 in order to transform our egocentric\nself-reliance (Moser 2008); besides, there may be significant\nconstraints logically inherent in the very possibility of unambiguous\ndivine revelation to finite minds (King 2008).\n\nSimilarly, accounts of theistic faith will be open to critique when\nthey make assumptions about the mechanisms of revelation. In\nparticular, the model of faith as assent to propositions as revealed\nholds that, since God\u2019s grace is required for that assent, when\ngrace is effective the whole \u2018package deal\u2019 of\npropositional revealed truth is accepted. This yields the notion of\n\u2018the Faith\u2019, as the body of theological truths to\nbe accepted by \u2018the faithful\u2019, and it becomes a sign of\nresistance to divine grace to \u2018pick and choose\u2019 only some\ntruths, as heretics do (Greek: hairesis, choice; see\nSumma Theologiae 2a2ae 5, 3 (Aquinas [2006], 157\u201361)).\nFor heresy to be judged, however, some human authority must assume it\npossesses the full doctrinal revelation, with God\u2019s grace\noperating without resistance in its own case. Whether that assumption\ncan ever be sufficiently well founded to justify condemning and\npurging others is an important question, whose neglect may be\nseriously harmful, as we are reminded by the fact that the phrase for\n\u2018act of faith\u2019 in\nPortuguese\u2014auto-da-f\u00e9\u2014came to mean the\npublic burning of a heretic.\n\nBut the deeper assumption made by this model of faith as non-basic\n(justified) belief (as, too, by the model of it as basic knowledge\nyielded by the proper functioning of a special cognitive faculty) is\nthat God\u2019s self-revelation is primarily the revelation of the\ntruth of propositions articulated in human language (compare Swinburne\n1992). Alternative understandings of revelation are available,\nhowever. In particular, it may be held that it is primarily the\ndivine itself that is revealed\u2014the reality, not merely a\nrepresentation of it. (See Lebens 2023 for discussion of faith as\nknowledge by acquaintance with God from a Jewish perspective).\nPropositional articulations of what is revealed may still be\nessential, but they need to be accepted as at a remove from the object\nof revelation itself, and therefore as limited. The development of\npropositional articulations expressing the nature and will of the\nself-revealing God\u2014the doctrines of \u2018the\nFaith\u2019\u2014will, of course, be understood as a process under\nprovidential grace. It is often assumed that that process can achieve\n\u2018closure\u2019 in a completed set of infallibly known creedal\npropositions. But this assumption about how divine inspiration\noperates may be contested, both on the theological grounds that it\nreflects the all-too-human desire to gain control over God\u2019s\nself-revelation (to \u2018pin God down once and for all\u2019), and\non the wider epistemological grounds that any attempt to grasp\nindependent reality in human language will be in principle limited and\nfallible, subject to revision in the light of future experience.\n",
