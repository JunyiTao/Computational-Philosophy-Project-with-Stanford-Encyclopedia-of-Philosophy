    "main_text": "Internal-Sense Theories || Reid\n1.4 Reid\n\nThomas Reid\u2019s theory of taste, as developed in the final essay\nof his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (first\npublished in 1785), makes use of a range of theoretical resources that\nhad become available by the last decades of the Eighteenth Century.\nIts account of sublimity owes to Burke; its treatment of novelty owes\nto Addison and to Gerard; the use it makes of association may owe to\nGerard as well. But as an internal-sense theory its debt is\nprincipally to Hutcheson and to Shaftesbury.\n\nReid adheres to Hutcheson\u2019s notion of internal sense rather than\nto Shaftesbury\u2019s. Indeed Reid\u2019s account of\nHutcheson\u2019s notion is arguably sharper than any Hutcheson ever\ngives:\n\nBeauty or deformity in an object, results from its nature or\nstructure. To perceive the beauty therefore, we must perceive the\nnature or structure from which it results. In this the internal sense\ndiffers from the external. Our external senses may discover qualities\nwhich do not depend upon any antecedent perception \u2026. But it is\nimpossible to perceive the beauty of an object, without perceiving the\nobject, or at least conceiving it. On this account, Dr. Hutcheson\ncalled the senses of beauty and harmony reflex or secondary senses;\nbecause the beauty cannot be perceived unless the object be perceived\nby some other power of the mind. (Reid 1785 [1969, 760\u2013761])\n\n\nBut while Reid agrees with Hutcheson about what makes the sense of\nbeauty internal, he disagrees with Hutcheson about what is\n\u201cingredient\u201d to that sense (Reid 1785 [1969, 782]).\nHutcheson, as Reid understands him, posits but one ingredient: an\nagreeable feeling or emotion resembling nothing in the object. But it\nis in restricting himself to this single affective ingredient, Reid\nthinks, that Hutcheson puts himself on the path to Lockean\nanti-realism with respect to beauty, since it may be thought that if\nthe sensation of beauty consists merely in such a feeling it refers to\nnothing in the object, and if it refers to nothing in the object then\nit must refer merely to \u201cthe perception of some Mind\u201d\n(Hutcheson 1726 [2004, 27]).\n\nReid takes this position to be \u201cnot so much an error in\njudgment, as an abuse of words\u201d (Reid 1785 [1969, 782]). There are\nwords by which one may say of Virgil\u2019s Georgics that it\nis the cause of a feeling, but these are not the words The\nGeorgics is beautiful; there is no reason to think they say\nanything of The Georgics other than that it has the property\nof beauty (Reid 1785 [1969, 759]). Hence a theory of taste that does not\ncontradict \u201cthe universal sense of mankind, as expressed by\ntheir language\u201d (Reid 1785 [1969, 760]) must allow the internal\nsense of beauty to have, in addition to its affective ingredient, a\ncognitive one\u2014a judgment ascribing a property to the object.\n\nReid appears to acknowledge that allowing the sense of beauty this\ncognitive dimension does not commit one to realism regarding beauty:\nhe appears to acknowledge that it is one thing to allow that the\ndeliverances of internal sense comprise judgments and yet another to\nallow that the positive judgments they sometimes comprise are\nsometimes true (Reid 1785 [1969, 783]). The case Reid makes for realism\nregarding beauty (and sublimity) is complex. He makes a\nstraightforward appeal to common sense (Reid 1785 [1969, 770]). He\nargues, after Descartes, that our possession of an inherently\nfallacious sense would make a deceiver of God (Reid 1785 [1969, 783]).\nBut his deepest and most complicated reason for thinking beauty real\nhas to do with the nature of the properties that he takes to ground\nbeauty. Following Burke, Reid identifies the affect properly inspired\nby beautiful objects as love (this contrasts with the affect properly\ninspired by sublime objects, which he identifies as admiration). Since\nwe properly love only what is good, the properties that properly\ninspire love must be perfections or excellences of some kind. It\nfollows that the beauty of an object has its ground in whatever\nperfections properly inspire our love for it, and so has whatever\nreality those perfections have.\n\nReid concedes that we are only sometimes able to specify the\nperfections in virtue of which we judge things beautiful. He refers to\njudgments in which the perfection cannot be specified as\n\u201cinstinctive\u201d and judgments in which it can be as\n\u201crational\u201d (Reid 1785 [1969, 785\u2013787]). Hence it is\nnecessarily from an incomplete set of data that his enquiry into\nbeauty-grounding perfections proceeds. That enquiry begins with a\nconsideration of those perfections in virtue of which we judge minds\nbeautiful, that is, the perfections that inspire love for the minds\nthat possess them. Reid finds that these perfections divide into three\nclasses: first, the amiable moral virtues, which include\n\u201c[i]nnocence, gentleness, condescension, humanity, natural\naffection, public spirit\u201d; second, the amiable intellectual\ntalents, which include, \u201cknowledge, good sense, wit, humour,\ncheerfulness, good taste, excellence in any of the fine arts\u201d;\nand, third, certain perfections pertaining to the mind\u2019s active\npowers\u2014perfections that \u201crender the body a fit instrument\nfor the mind\u201d\u2014including \u201chealth, strength, and\nagility\u201d (Reid 1785 [1969, 792]). Reid finds further that these\nperfections are not relative to human nature but absolute:\n\nIs not power in its nature more excellent that weakness; knowledge\nthan ignorance; wisdom than folly; fortitude than pusillanimity?\n\u2026 Let us suppose, if possible, a being so constituted, as to\nhave a high respect for ignorance, weakness, and folly; to venerate\ncowardice, malice, and envy, and to hold the contrary qualities in\ncontempt \u2026. Could we believe such a constitution to be anything\nelse than madness and delirium? \u2026 We can as easily conceive a\nconstitution, by which one should perceive two and three to make\nfifteen, or a part to be greater than a whole. (Reid 1785 [1969, 770])\n\n\nThus Reid concludes that \u201c[t]here is therefore a real intrinsic\nexcellence in some qualities of mind, as in power, knowledge, wisdom,\nvirtue, magnanimity,\u201d and that a mind in possession of such\nqualities is therein really beautiful (Reid 1785 [1969, 771]).\n\nWhen Reid enquires next after the perfections in virtue of which we\nascribe beauty to material objects, his account takes a Shaftesburian\nturn. Reid revives Shaftesbury\u2019s distinction between original\nand representative beauty (though he prefers the term\n\u201cderived\u201d to \u201crepresentative\u201d) and also\nShaftesbury\u2019s claim that the beauty of material objects derives\nfrom the original beauty of minds. This allows him to maintain that\nthe perfections in virtue of which we attribute beauty to material\nobjects just are the perfections in virtue of which we attribute\nbeauty to minds. But whereas Shaftesbury simply infers without further\nargument the reduction of material to mental beauty from the premise\nthat material beauty is the effect of mind, Reid takes up instance\nafter instance of material beauty, arguing with respect to each that\nit is best understood as a \u201csign\u201d of some instance of\nmental beauty. The beauty we attribute to inanimate nature signifies\nthe wisdom and goodness of the mind that fashioned it for our use\n(Reid 1785 [1969, 799\u2013800]); the beauty we attribute to animals,\ninsofar as we regard them as minded, signifies \u201ctheir instincts,\ntheir appetites, their affections, their sagacity\u201d (Reid\n1785 [1969, 794]); the beauty we attribute to the human form signifies\neither \u201csome perfection of the body, as a part of the man, and\nan instrument of the mind\u201d or \u201csome amiable quality or\nattribute of the mind itself\u201d (Reid 1785 [1969, 806]).\n\nIt may be objected that such a reduction of material to mental beauty\ncannot serve Reid\u2019s case for realism, at least as it applies to\nmaterial objects. For it may seem that the beauty we attribute to\nmaterial objects can never be real, by Reid\u2019s lights, given that\nno material object ever can have any of the mental perfections capable\nof grounding beauty. But such an objection misses a subtlety of\nReid\u2019s position. Strictly speaking, material objects never are\nbeautiful. But this does not imply that the beauty that we attribute\nto them never is real. It is real, at least generally, though strictly\nspeaking it belongs only to the minds that the material objects in\nquestion signify. If it seems to us that these objects themselves\npossess beauty, this is because beauty is prone to be\n\u201ctransferred\u201d or \u201ccommunicated\u201d from the minds\nthat really have it to the material objects that merely signify it\n(Reid 1785 [1969, 788]). Reid never uses the term\n\u201cassociation\u201d to refer to the mechanism by which beauty is\nthus communicated from mental signified to material sign. But that he\ndoes not distance himself from association\u2014the mechanism by then\nat the center of a great deal of theorizing about taste\u2014makes it\nhard to deny that it has found a positive role in his own theory.\n",
