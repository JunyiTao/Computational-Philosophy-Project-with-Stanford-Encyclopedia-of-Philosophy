    "main_text": "Two Schools of Heuristics || Biases and Heuristics\n7.1 Biases and Heuristics\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Kahneman and Tversky conducted a series of\nexperiments showing various ways that human participants\u2019\nresponses to decision tasks deviate from answers purportedly derived\nfrom the appropriate normative standards (sections\n 2.4\n and\n 5.1).\n These deviations were given names, such as availability\n(Tversky & Kahneman 1973), representativeness, and\nanchoring (Tversky & Kahneman 1974). The set of cognitive\nbiases now numbers into the hundreds, although some are minor variants\nof other well-known effects, such as \u201cThe IKEA effect\u201d\n(Norton, Mochon, & Ariely 2012) being a version of the well-known\nendowment effect\n (section 1.2).\n Nevertheless, core effects studied by the biases and heuristics\nprogram, particularly those underpinning prospect theory\n (section 2.4),\n are entrenched in cognitive psychology (Kahneman, Slovic, &\nTversky 1982).\n\nAn example of a probability judgment task is Kahneman and\nTversky\u2019s Taxi-cab problem, which purports to show that subjects\nneglect base rates.\n\n\nA cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab\ncompanies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. You are given\nthe following data:\n\n\n\n85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.\n\n\nA witness identified the cab as a Blue cab. The court tested his\nability to identify cabs under the appropriate visibility conditions.\nWhen presented with a sample of cabs (half of which were Blue and half\nof which were Green) the witness made correct identifications in 80%\nof the cases and erred in 20% of the cases.\n\n\nQuestion: What is the probability that the cab involved in the\naccident was Blue rather than Green? (Tversky & Kahneman 1977:\n3\u20133).\n\n\nContinuing, Kahneman and Tversky report that several hundred subjects\nhave been given slight variations of this question and for all\nversions the modal and median responses was 0.8, instead of the\ncorrect answer of \\(\\bfrac{12}{29}\\) (\\(\\approx 0.41\\)). \n\n\nThus, the intuitive judgment of probability coincides with the\ncredibility of the witness and ignores the relevant base-rate, i.e.,\nthe relative frequency of Green and Blue cabs. (Tversky & Kahneman\n1977: 3\u20133)\n\n\nCritical responses to results of this kind fall into three broad\ncategories. The first types of reply is to argue that the\nexperimenters, rather than the subjects, are in error (Cohen 1981). In\nthe Taxi-cab problem, arguably Bayes sides with the folk (Levi 1983)\nor, alternatively, is inconclusive because the normative standard of\nthe experimenter and the presumed normative standard of the subject\nrequires a theory of witness testimony, neither of which is specified\n(Birnbaum 1979). Other cognitive biases have been ensnared in the\nreplication crises, such as implicit bias (Oswald, Mitchell,\net al. 2013; Forscher, Lai et al. 2017) and social priming\n(Doyen, Klein, et al. 2012; Kahneman 2017\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nThe second response is to argue that there is an important difference\nbetween identifying a normative standard for combining probabilistic\ninformation and applying it across a range of cases\n (section 8.2),\n and it is difficult in practice to determine that a decision-maker is\nrepresenting the task in the manner that the experimenters intend\n(Koehler 1996). Observed behavior that appears to be boundedly\nrational or even irrational may result from a difference between the\nintended specification of a problem and the actual problem subjects\nface.\n\nFor example, consider the systematic biases in people\u2019s\nperception of randomness reported in some of Kahneman and\nTversky\u2019s earliest work (Kahneman & Tversky 1972). For\nsequences of flips of a fair coin, people expect to see, even for\nsmall samples, a roughly-equal number heads and tails and alternation\nrates between heads and tails that are slightly higher than long-run\naverages (Bar-Hillel & Wagenaar 1991). This effect is thought to\nexplain the gambler\u2019s fallacy, the false belief that a\nrun of heads from an i.i.d. sequence of fair coin tosses will make the\nnext flip more likely to land tails. Hahn and Warren argue that the\nlimited nature of people\u2019s experiences with random sequences is\na better explanation than to view them as cognitive deficiencies.\nSpecifically, people only ever experience finite sequence of outputs\nfrom a randomizer, such as a sequence of fair coin tosses, and the\nlimits to their memory\n (section 5.1)\n of past outcomes in a sequence will mean that not all possible\nsequences of a given length with appear to them with equal\nprobability. Therefore, there is a psychologically plausible\ninterpretation of the question, \u201cis it more likely to see\nHHHT than HHHH from flips of a fair coin?\u201d,\nfor which the correct answer is, \u201cYes\u201d (Hahn & Warren\n2009). If the gambler\u2019s fallacy boils down to a failure to\ndistinguish between sampling with and without replacement, Hahn and\nWarren\u2019s point is that our intuitive statistical abilities\nacquired through experience alone is unable to make the distinction\nbetween these two sampling methods. Analytical reasoning is\nnecessary.\n\nConsider also the risky-choice framing effect that was mentioned\nbriefly in\n section 2.4.\n An example is the Asian disease example,\n\n\n\nIf program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.\n\n\nIf program B is adopted, there is a \u2153 probability that\n600 people will be saved, and a \u2154 probability that no people\nwill be saved (Tversky & Kahneman 1981: 453).\n\n\nTversky and Kahneman report that a majority of respondents (72\npercent) chose option (a), whereas a majority of respondents (78\npercent) shown an equivalent reformulation of the problem in terms of\nthe number of people who would die rather than survive chose (b). A\nmeta-analysis of subsequent experiments has shown that the framing\ncondition accounts for most of the variance, but it also reveals no\nlinear combination of formally specified predictors that are used in\nprospect theory, cumulative prospect theory, and Markowitz\u2019s\nutility theory, suffices to capture this framing effect\n(K\u00fchberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, & Perner 1999).\n\nThe point to this second line of criticism is not that people\u2019s\nresponses are at variance with the correct normative standard but\nrather that the explanation for why they are at variance will matter\nnot only for assessing the rationality of people but what prescriptive\ninterventions ought to be taken to counter the error. It is rash to\nconclude that people, rather than the peculiarities of the task or the\ntheoretical tools available to us at the moment, are in error.\n\nLastly, the third type of response is to accept the experimental\nresults but challenge the claim that they are generalizable. In a\ncontrolled replication of Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s lawyer-engineer\nexample (Tversky & Kahneman 1977), for example, a crucial\nassumption is whether the descriptions of the individuals were drawn\nat random, which was tested by having subjects draw blindly from an\nurn (Gigerenzer, Hell, & Blank 1988). Under these conditions,\nbase-rate neglect disappeared. In response to the Linda example\n(Tversky & Kahneman 1983), rephrasing the example in terms of\nwhich alternative is more frequent rather than which\nalternative is more probable reduces occurrences of the\nconjunction fallacy among subjects from 77% to 27% (Fiedler 1988).\nMore generally, a majority of people presented with the Linda example\nappear to interpret \u2018probability\u2019 non-mathematically but\nswitch to a mathematical interpretation when asked for frequency\njudgments (Hertwig & Gigerenzer 1999). Ralph Hertwig and\ncolleagues have since noted a variety of other effects involving\nprobability judgments to diminish or disappear when subjects are\npermitted to learn the probabilities through sampling, suggesting that\npeople are better adapted to making a decision by experience\nof the relevant probabilities as opposed to making a decision by their\ndescription (Hertwig, Barron et al. 2004).\n",
