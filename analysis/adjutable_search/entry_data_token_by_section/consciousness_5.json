    "main_text": "Problems of Consciousness\n3. Problems of Consciousness\n\n\nThe task of understanding consciousness is an equally diverse\nproject. Not only do many different aspects of mind count as conscious\nin some sense, each is also open to various respects in which it might\nbe explained or modeled. Understanding consciousness involves a\nmultiplicity not only of explananda but also of questions that they\npose and the sorts of answers they require. At the risk of\noversimplifying, the relevant questions can be gathered under three\ncrude rubrics as the What, How, and Why questions:\n\nThe Descriptive Question: What is consciousness? What are\nits principal features? And by what means can they be best discovered,\ndescribed and modeled?\nThe Explanatory Question: How does consciousness of the\nrelevant sort come to exist? Is it a primitive aspect of reality, and\nif not how does (or could) consciousness in the relevant respect arise\nfrom or be caused by nonconscious entities or processes?\nThe Functional Question: Why does consciousness of the\nrelevant sort exist? Does it have a function, and if so what is it?\nDoes it act causally and if so with what sorts of effects? Does it make a\ndifference to the operation of systems in which it is present, and if\nso why and how?\n\n\n\nThe three questions focus respectively on describing the features of\nconsciousness, explaining its underlying basis or cause, and\nexplicating its role or value. The divisions among the three are of\ncourse somewhat artificial, and in practice the answers one gives to\neach will depend in part on what one says about the others. One can\nnot, for example, adequately answer the what question and describe the\nmain features of consciousness without addressing the why issue of its\nfunctional role within systems whose operations it affects. Nor could\none explain how the relevant sort of consciousness might arise from\nnonconscious processes unless one had a clear account of just what\nfeatures had to be caused or realized to count as producing it. Those\ncaveats notwithstanding, the three-way division of questions provides a\nuseful structure for articulating the overall explanatory project and\nfor assessing the adequacy of particular theories or models of\nconsciousness.\n",
