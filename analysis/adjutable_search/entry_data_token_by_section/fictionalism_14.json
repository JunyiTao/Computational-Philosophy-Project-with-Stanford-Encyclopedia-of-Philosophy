    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || Criticisms concerning systematicity\n4.3 Criticisms concerning systematicity\n\nOne main worry that Stanley (2001) presses with respect to hermeneutic\nfictionalism concerns systematicity. Take the case of mathematics.\nInfinitely many sentences belong to mathematical discourse, and to be\ncompetent with mathematical discourse involves having the competence\nto grasp these infinitely many sentences. Standard considerations\nconcerning the finitude of our minds require that our grasp of these\ninfinitely many sentences is something we have by virtue of our grasp\nof some finite set of principles: a compositional semantic theory is\nrequired. But it is, the worry goes, unclear what a compositional\nfictionalist semantic theory might conceivably look like.\n\nYablo\u2019s (2001) response to the systematicity objection is to\nsay, \u201cThere are kinds of speech that finite beings clearly do\nunderstand, yet whose semantics does not seem to be compositional. One\ndoes not expect a compositional semantics for hyperbole, metonymy, or\nirony: one does not expect a compositional semantics for speech\ngoverned by shifting presuppositions. Somehow, though, we understand.\nThis suggests that [hermeneutic fictionalist] analyses directed at\nkinds of speech that resemble hyperbole, metonymy, or etc. should not\nbe held to the standard of strong-systematicity-or-bust\u201d. There\nis something odd about this response. The reason why we do not expect\na compositional semantics for hyberbole is that we do not really\nexpect a semantics for hyperbole at all. We do not think that\nthere are certain sentences that have hyperbolic meanings\n\u2014 whatever that would amount to \u2014 but rather that\nsometimes some sentences are used hyperbolically. Even so,\nthere is something telling about what Yablo says. The analogy with\nhyperbole and irony shows Yablo to be a use fictionalist: his\nhypothesis is not one about the types of meanings mathematical\nsentences have but about what we ordinarily do with mathematical\nsentences. From this perspective, the demand for a compositional\nfictionalist semantics for mathematical sentences is misplaced for the\nreason that the fictionalist does not propose a different semantics\nfor mathematical sentences at all.\n\nStanley discusses, and rejects, a response to his argument much like\nthe one here brought up. He considers the question of whether the\nfictionalist about D should be taken as making a claim about\nwhat proposition really is expressed in an ordinary utterance of a\ndeclarative sentence of D, or rather just a claim about what\nis pragmatically communicated. Apparently allowing that the\nfictionalist gets off the hook in the latter case, Stanley marshals a\nnumber of arguments in favor of the former alternative. However, the\ndistinction Stanley draws is clearly different from the distinction\nbetween meaning fictionalism and use fictionalism. One can be a use\nfictionalist while holding that one\u2019s view is about what\nproposition is expressed in an ordinary utterance of a relevant\nsentence. It is not clear why a fictionalist hypothesis about which\nproposition is expressed in an utterance should incur an obligation to\nhold that there is a compositional fictionalist semantics.\n\nThese remarks are not meant to indicate that the mathematical\nfictionalist does not owe us a systematic account of what is\ncommunicated by mathematical sentences. The point is just that what is\nowed is not a compositional semantics. Yablo\u2019s analogy,\nhyperbole, can be used to make the point, despite the obvious\ndifferences between this case and the mathematics case. All that is\nneeded properly to understand hyperbole is an ordinary compositional\nsemantics giving the literal meanings of the sentences involved plus a\ngeneral principle relating the propositions semantically expressed by\nthe sentences to the inflated propositions the sentences express when\nused hyperbolically. Similarly, given use fictionalism all that is\nneeded properly to understand what is communicated in ordinary\nutterances of mathematical sentences is an ordinary compositional\nsemantics, together with principles linking the literal contents of\nmathematical sentences to what the fictionalist says the utterances\nordinarily convey. \n",
