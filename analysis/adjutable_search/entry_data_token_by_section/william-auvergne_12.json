    "main_text": "The Soul || The Existence and Substantiality of Souls\n7.1 The Existence and Substantiality of Souls\n\nAmong William\u2019s many arguments for the existence of souls is the\nargument that bodies are instruments of souls and the power to carry\nout operations through an instrument cannot belong to the instrument\nitself. Thus, there must be something other than the bodies of living\nthings that operates by means of bodies, and this is their soul. In\nthe case of the human or rational soul, he argues that its existence\nfollows in particular from the fact that understanding and knowledge\nare found in a human being but not in the whole body or any part of\nit. Since these are operations of a living substance, there must be a\nliving incorporeal substance in which they are, and this is what\npeople mean when they speak of their soul.\n\nThese arguments serve not only to show the existence of souls, but\nalso that they are substances. In the case of the human soul, William\nargues, the operations of understanding and knowing must be treated as\nproper operations of the soul, and this requires that the soul itself\nbe a substance. To the objection that the soul itself does not\nliterally understand or know but is instead that thanks to which a\nhuman being can understand and know, William will argue that the soul\nand human being, which he equates with the referent of the pronoun\n\u201cI,\u201d are one and the same thing. More generally, the\nsubstantiality of souls\u2014and not just of human souls\u2014is\nindicated by the fact that bodies are their instruments.\n",
