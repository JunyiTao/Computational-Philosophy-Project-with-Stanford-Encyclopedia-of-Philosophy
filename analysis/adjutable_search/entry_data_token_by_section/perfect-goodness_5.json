    "main_text": "Is necessary perfect goodness possible? || The applicability of moral norms\n5.1 The applicability of moral norms\n\nOne potential obstacle, which received extensive discussion in\nresponse to some worries raised by William Alston (1990), is that\nthere might be thought to be a tension between the theses that God is\nnecessarily perfectly good (again, understood de re) and the\nthesis that the sort of goodness that God exhibits is moral goodness.\nFor it might be thought that to be morally good is to act in\naccordance with the true set of moral norms that applies to one, but\none might think that a set of moral norms can apply to one only if it\nis possible that one fail to perform an action that that set of norms\nrequires (Alston 1990, pp. 310\u2013315). Such an argument, if\nsuccessful, would show not only that an account of moral goodness that\ncharacterized it entirely in terms of compliance with some set of\nmoral norms could not be a correct standard in terms of which to\nunderstand God\u2019s perfect goodness; it would also show that an\naccount of moral goodness that took adherence to some set of moral\nnorms to be an irreducible part of moral goodness to be an\nimproper standard as well.\n\nThe idea that moral norms apply only to beings that can fail to act in\naccordance with them has a Kantian provenance, but the Kantian\nargument applies only to moral norms understood in a very specific\nway, as imperatives of a certain sort; Kant\u2019s view\nallows that moral norms can play a role in the lives of agents who are\nperfectly good, agents whom Kant calls \u201choly wills\u201d (Kant,\nGroundwork, 4: 414.) That holy wills invariably perform the\nactions that the moral norms call for does not show that these moral\nnorms do not apply to them. Far from it: that they apply\nexplains why the holy will acts in accordance with them, for\nif (per impossibile) those norms did not apply, the holy will\nmight well not act in accordance with them. There seems to be little\njustification for thinking that God\u2019s goodness could not be\nmoral goodness simply from the fact that God is necessarily perfectly\ngood.
