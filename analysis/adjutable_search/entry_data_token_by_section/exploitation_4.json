    "main_text": "The Concept of Exploitation\n2. The Concept of Exploitation\n\nPhilosophical analyses of exploitation are broad and varied. As is\noften the case with such analyses, there is no widespread agreement\nabout what, precisely, exploitation is. However, consensus has emerged\naround some of the domain conditions for exploitation. Most\u2014\nthough not all\u2014philosophers agree that exploitation involves\ntaking unfair advantage, though, of course, they disagree about what\nexactly this involves. And most, but not all, philosophers also agree\nthat in order to be an exploiter, \\(A\\) must benefit and this benefit\nmust come at \\(B\\)\u2019s expense. We think few philosophers would\ndeny that exploitations can be all- things-considered harmful.\nHowever, much more philosophical attention has been given to mutually\nbeneficial exploitations, in which the exploited benefits from the\ninteraction, albeit in a morally problematic way. The reason for this\nfocus is that harmful exploitations are less ethically puzzling than\nmutually beneficial exploitations. The wrongs of harmful exploitation\nare more familiar, often over determined, and usually coextensive with\nfraud and coercion. Harmful exploitations are also likely to be\nnon-consensual and, of course, the harm itself may also be sufficient\nto explain the wrongfulness of these cases.\n\nThere is far less consensus about another domain condition: whether\nexploitation is a structural feature of social systems, a property of\ndiscrete individual transactions, or both. Philosophers also disagree\nabout more substantive features of exploitation, such as how we should\nunderstand the unfairness present in exploitations, about whether\nexploitation also requires something more than unfairness, such as\nmorally problematic motives or attitudes on the part of the exploiter,\nand about what Alan Wertheimer (1996: 279) has called the \u2018moral\nweight\u2019 (exploitation\u2019s permissibility or\nimpermissibility) and \u2018moral force\u2019 of exploitation\n(whether third parties should intervene in exploitations).\n\nIn the rest of this section, we discuss exploitation\u2019s various\ndomain conditions before surveying debates about unfairness, and other\npossible necessary conditions. Exploitation\u2019s moral status is\ncovered in section three.\n",
