    "main_text": "Just War Doctrine\n6. Originality and Influence\n\nComing at last to a broader assessment of Grotius\u2019 contributions\nto the history of ideas, we should start by distinguishing the\nquestion of his originality from that of his influence. For our\npurposes, it will suffice to define originality as involving the\nformation of novel and important new concepts and/or methods while\ntaking influence to consist in having major effects on others. Let us\nhandle originality first before coming to the easier question of\nGrotius\u2019 influence.\n\nGiven that his work ranged across so many different\nfields\u2014ethics, political theory, politics, religion\u2014it is\nimpossible to make a blanket statement that Grotius was or was not an\noriginal thinker. Instead, the only responsible approach is to deal\nwith his alleged contributions on a case-by-case basis. Because it\nwould be tedious to go through all the cases here, let us just take\nthe two which are likely to be of greatest interest to philosophers:\nethics and political theory.\n\nThere is scholarly dispute about the originality of Grotius\u2019\nethics. Irwin (2008) has recently argued that because he merely\nextracts the major elements of his theory of morality from other\nauthors, especially Aquinas and Suarez, \u201cGrotius is no\npioneer\u201d in the history of ethics (98). By contrast, Schneewind\n(1993) thinks that Grotius deserves credit for introducing agonism\ninto ethics\u2014the notion that\n\n\nconflict is ineradicable, and could not be removed, even in principle,\nby the completest possible metaphysical knowledge of how the world is\nconstituted. (1993: 58).\n\n\nWriting decades before Irwin and Schneewind, the Italian scholar A.P.\nd\u2019Entr\u00e8ves argues that\n\n\nIt is not in its content that Grotius\u2019 theory of natural law\nbreaks away from Scholasticism. It is in its method.\n(d\u2019Entr\u00e8ves 1951 [1970: 54])\n\n\nAccording to d\u2019Entr\u00e8ves, Grotius attempted to\n\n\nconstruct a system of laws which would carry conviction in an age in\nwhich theological controversy was gradually losing the power to do so\n\u2026 His successors completed the task. The natural law which they\nelaborated was entirely \u201csecular\u201d. (1951 [1970: 55])\n\n\nOthers who have weighed in on the subject of the originality of\nGrotius\u2019 ethics include Kilcullen (1995), Darwall (2012), and\nMiller (2020). A clear and balanced assessment is given by Tierney\n(1997: Chapter XIII).\n\nTurning to political theory,\n Sections 4\u20135\n above identified various concrete contributions of Grotius\u2019 to\npolitics. For many scholars, however, Grotius is important not so much\nfor his new ideas as for his new way of thinking about political\nproblems. So, Kingsbury and Roberts say, \u201cthe greatest direct\ncontribution of\u201d the DIB is\n\n\nthe systematic reassembling of practice and authorities on the\ntraditional but fundamental subject of the jus belli,\norganized for the first time around a body of principles rooted in the\nlaw of nature. (1990: 3\u20134)\n\n\nThere is a different gauge of Grotius\u2019 originality in the domain\nof politics. Through his writings, he gave rise to a theory of\nstatehood and the relations among states which has come to be known\nas, simply, \u201cGrotian\u201d (the labels are used by Wight\n(1991), among others). This theory is an account of the origins and\nidentity conditions of states. It conceives of states as existing not\nin a pre- or anti-social condition but rather in an international\nsociety governed by a system of norms. Those norms hold apart from a\npositive action by a legislature or legislator. At the same time as it\ninsists on the existence and relevance of these norms (which are, of\ncourse, the laws of nature), it is also cognizant of the force of real\npolitick. Individual states will engage in the pursuit of their own\nperceived interests, regardless of whether such pursuits place them in\nconflict with the natural law. By doing all of this, the Grotian\nschool is supposed to negotiate a middle way between bare-knuckled\n\u201cMachiavellianism\u201d and excessively idealistic\n\u201cKantianism\u201d (for more, see Wight together with the\ncriticisms in Bull 1976). Depending on the fortunes of these schools\nat any particular moment in history, Grotius\u2019 influence on\ninternational relations will be waxing or waning.\n\nThat mention of the influence brings us to the second broad topic of\nthis concluding section. Scholars may argue about whether and how\nGrotius was original but no one can doubt his influence. For example,\nthe Swedish King Gustav Adolph is supposed to have kept a copy of the\nDIB under his pillow, next to the Bible. And King James I\nreacted strongly (and negatively) to Grotius\u2019 presentations\nduring a diplomatic mission to England.\n\nSo Grotius\u2019 influence was felt on some of the major actors of\nhis day. Naturally, though, his main impact was on other scholars.\nBayle called him \u201cone of the greatest men in Europe\u201d (1720\n[1740: 2.614]). Leibniz hailed \u201cthe incomparable Hugo\nGrotius\u201d (see Leibniz 1710 [1985], 77). Thomas Reid spoke of\n\u201cthe immortal Hugo Grotius\u201d (see Reid 1788 [1815],\n331), Hutcheson drew on him extensively, and Hume approvingly\ncited an argument of his about the origins of property in the third\nappendix of his second Enquiry (see Hume 1748 [1975], 307).\nTo be sure, not all were so impressed. Rousseau\u2019s opinion has\nalready been cited; the natural law theorist Samuel Pufendorf was also\nsceptical. And Voltaire found Grotius to be simply boring. Still,\nwhether for good or for ill, Grotius was at the center of letters for\nan enviably long time. For a brief synopsis of Grotius\u2019\ninfluence, focusing on the DIB , see Tuck (2005:\nix\u2013xii).\n",
