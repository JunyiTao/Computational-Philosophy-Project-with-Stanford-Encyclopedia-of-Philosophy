    "preamble": "\n\n\nQuantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a\nmathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic\nparticles \u2014 or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to\nexplore those behaviors \u2014 and in that capacity, it is spectacularly\nsuccessful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above\nany theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well\nunderstood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and\nwhy, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by\ndescribing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing\nperforms the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one\nend is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what\nkind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is very\nlittle agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what\nthe world is like according to quantum mechanics. Minimally\ninterpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the\nmicroscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our\nmeasuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language\nof classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a\nmicroscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed\nmanner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those\napparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the\nsort the theory\n describes.[1]\n\n\n\nThat is what an interpretation of the theory would provide: a proper\naccount of what the world is like according to quantum mechanics,\nintrinsically and from the bottom up. The problems with giving an\ninterpretation (not just a comforting, homey sort of interpretation,\ni.e., not just an interpretation according to which the world isn\u2019t too\ndifferent from the familiar world of common sense, but any\ninterpretation at all) are dealt with in other sections of this\nencyclopedia. Here, we are concerned only with the mathematical heart\nof the theory, the theory in its capacity as a mathematical machine,\nand \u2014 whatever is true of the rest of it \u2014 this part of the\ntheory makes exquisitely good sense.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Terminology\n\n\nPhysical systems are divided into types according to\ntheir unchanging (or \u2018state-independent\u2019) properties, and\nthe state of a system at a time consists of a complete\nspecification of those of its properties that change with time (its\n\u2018state-dependent\u2019 properties). To give a complete\ndescription of a system, then, we need to say what type of system it is\nand what its state is at each moment in its history. \n\n\nA physical quantity is a mutually exclusive and\njointly exhaustive family of physical properties (for those who know\nthis way of talking, it is a family of properties with the structure of\nthe cells in a partition). Knowing what kinds of values a quantity\ntakes can tell us a great deal about the relations among the properties\nof which it is composed. The values of a bivalent quantity, for\ninstance, form a set with two members; the values of a real-valued\nquantity form a set with the structure of the real numbers. This is a\nspecial case of something we will see again and again, viz.,\nthat knowing what kind of mathematical objects represent the elements\nin some set (here, the values of a physical quantity; later, the states\nthat a system can assume, or the quantities pertaining to it) tells us\na very great deal (indeed, arguably, all there is to know) about the\nrelations among them.\n\n\nIn quantum mechanical contexts, the term\n\u2018observable\u2019 is used interchangeably with\n\u2018physical quantity\u2019, and should be treated as a technical\nterm with the same meaning. It is no accident that the early developers\nof the theory chose the term, but the choice was made for reasons that\nare not, nowadays, generally accepted. The state-space\nof a system is the space formed by the set of its possible\n states,[2]\n i.e., the physically possible ways of\ncombining the values of quantities that characterize it internally. In\nclassical theories, a set of quantities which forms a supervenience\nbasis for the rest is typically designated as \u2018basic\u2019 or\n\u2018fundamental\u2019, and, since any mathematically possible way\nof combining their values is a physical possibility, the state-space\ncan be obtained by simply taking these as\n coordinates.[3]\n So, for instance, the state-space of a classical mechanical system\ncomposed of \\(n\\) particles, obtained by specifying the values of\n\\(6n\\) real-valued quantities \u2014 three components of position, and\nthree of momentum for each particle in the system \u2014 is a\n\\(6n\\)-dimensional coordinate space. Each possible state of such\na system corresponds to a point in the space, and each point in the\nspace corresponds to a possible state of such a system. The situation\nis a little different in quantum mechanics, where there are\nmathematically describable ways of combining the values of the\nquantities that don\u2019t represent physically possible states. As we will\nsee, the state-spaces of quantum mechanics are special kinds of vector\nspaces, known as Hilbert spaces, and they have more internal structure\nthan their classical counterparts.\n\n\nA structure is a set of elements on which certain\noperations and relations are defined, a mathematical\nstructure is just a structure in which the elements are\nmathematical objects (numbers, sets, vectors) and the operations\nmathematical ones, and a model is a mathematical\nstructure used to represent some physically significant structure in\nthe world.\n\n\nThe heart and soul of quantum mechanics is contained in the Hilbert\nspaces that represent the state-spaces of quantum mechanical systems.\nThe internal relations among states and quantities, and everything this\nentails about the ways quantum mechanical systems behave, are all woven\ninto the structure of these spaces, embodied in the relations among the\nmathematical objects which represent\n them.[4]\n This means that\nunderstanding what a system is like according to quantum mechanics is\ninseparable from familiarity with the internal structure of those\nspaces. Know your way around Hilbert space, and become familiar with\nthe dynamical laws that describe the paths that vectors travel through\nit, and you know everything there is to know, in the terms provided by\nthe theory, about the systems that it describes.\n\n\nBy \u2018know your way around\u2019 Hilbert space, I mean\nsomething more than possess a description or a map of it; anybody who\nhas a quantum mechanics textbook on their shelf has that. I mean know\nyour way around it in the way you know your way around the city in\nwhich you live. This is a practical kind of knowledge that comes in\ndegrees and it is best acquired by learning to solve problems of the\nform: How do I get from A to B? Can I get there without passing through\nC? And what is the shortest route? Graduate students in physics spend\nlong years gaining familiarity with the nooks and crannies of Hilbert\nspace, locating familiar landmarks, treading its beaten paths, learning\nwhere secret passages and dead ends lie, and developing a sense of the\noverall lay of the land. They learn how to navigate Hilbert space in\nthe way a cab driver learns to navigate his city.\n\n\nHow much of this kind of knowledge is needed to approach the\nphilosophical problems associated with the theory? In the beginning,\nnot very much: just the most general facts about the geometry of the\nlandscape (which is, in any case, unlike that of most cities,\nbeautifully organized), and the paths that (the vectors representing\nthe states of) systems travel through them. That is what will be\nintroduced here: first a bit of easy math, and then, in a nutshell, the\ntheory.\n2. Mathematics\n2.1 Vectors and vector spaces\n\n\nA vector \\(A\\), written \u2018\\(\\ket{A}\\)\u2019, is a\nmathematical object characterized by a length, \\(|A|\\), and a direction. A\nnormalized vector is a vector of length 1; i.e., \\(|A| = 1\\). Vectors can\nbe added together, multiplied by constants (including complex\nnumbers), and multiplied together. Vector addition maps any pair of\nvectors onto another vector, specifically, the one you get by moving\nthe second vector so that its tail coincides with the tip of the\nfirst, without altering the length or direction of either, and then\njoining the tail of the first to the tip of the second. This addition\nrule is known as the parallelogram law. So, for example, adding\nvectors \\(\\ket{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{B}\\) yields vector \\(\\ket{C} (= \\ket{A} + \\ket{B})\\) as\nin Figure 1: \n\n\nFigure 1.\nVector Addition\n\n\n\nMultiplying a vector \\(\\ket{A}\\) by \\(n\\), where \\(n\\) is a\nconstant, gives a vector which is the same direction as \\(\\ket{A}\\) but\nwhose length is \\(n\\) times \\(\\ket{A}\\)\u2019s length. \n\n\nIn a real vector space, the\n (inner or dot) product\n of a pair of vectors \\(\\ket{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{B}\\), written\n\u2018\\(\\braket{A}{B}\\)\u2019 is a scalar equal to the product of their\nlengths (or \u2018norms\u2019) times the cosine of the angle,\n\\(\\theta\\), between them:\n\n\\[\n\\braket{A}{B} = |A| |B| \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\ket{A_1}\\) and \\(\\ket{A_2}\\) be vectors of length 1\n(\u201cunit vectors\u201d) such that \\(\\braket{A_1}{A_2} = 0\\). (So\nthe angle between these two unit vectors must be 90 degrees.) Then we\ncan represent any two-dimensional vector \\(\\ket{B}\\) in terms of our unit vectors\nas follows: \n\n\\[\n\\ket{B} = b_1 \\ket{A_1} + b_2 \\ket{A_2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, here is a graph which shows how \\(\\ket{B}\\) can be represented\nas the sum of the two unit vectors \\(\\ket{A_1}\\) and \\(\\ket{A_2}\\): \n\n\nFigure 2.\nRepresenting \\(\\ket{B}\\) by Vector Addition of Unit Vectors\n\n\n\nNow the definition of the inner product \\(\\braket{A}{B}\\) has to be\nmodified to apply to complex spaces. Let \\(c^*\\) be the complex\nconjugate of \\(c\\). (When \\(c\\) is a complex number of the\nform \\(a \\pm bi\\), then the complex conjugate\n\\(c^*\\) of \\(c\\) is defined as follows:\n\n\\[\n[a+bi]^* = a-bi \\\\\n[a-bi]^* = a+bi\n\\]\n\n\n\nSo, for all complex numbers \\(c\\), \\([c^*]^* = c\\),\nbut \\(c^* = c\\) just in case \\(c\\) is real.) Now\ndefinition of the inner product of \\(\\ket{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{B}\\) for complex spaces\ncan be given in terms of the conjugates of complex coefficients as\nfollows. Where \\(\\ket{A_1}\\) and \\(\\ket{A_2}\\) are the unit\nvectors described earlier, \\(\\ket{A} = a_1 \\ket{A_1} + a_2 \\ket{A_2}\\) and \\(\\ket{B} = b_1 \\ket{A_1} + b_2 \\ket{A_2}\\), then \n\n\\[\n\\braket{A}{B} = (a_1^*)(b_1) + (a_2^*)(b_2)\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe most general and abstract notion of an inner product, of which\nwe\u2019ve now defined two special cases, is as follows. \\(\\braket{A}{B}\\) is an\ninner product on a vector space \\(V\\) just in case\n\n\\(\\braket{A}{A} = |A|^2\\), and \\(\\braket{A}{A}=0\\) if and only if \\(A=0\\)\n\\(\\braket{B}{A} = \\braket{A}{B}^*\\)\n\\(\\braket{B}{A+C}=\\braket{B}{A} + \\braket{B}{C}\\).\n\n\n\nIt follows from this that \n\nthe length of \\(\\ket{A}\\) is the square root of inner\nproduct of \\(\\ket{A}\\) with itself, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n|A| = \\sqrt{\\braket{A}{A}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nand \n\n\\(\\ket{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{B}\\) are mutually perpendicular, or\northogonal, if, and only if, \\(\\braket{A}{B} = 0\\).\n\n\n\nA vector space is a set of vectors closed under\naddition, and multiplication by constants, an inner product\nspace is a vector space on which the operation of vector\nmultiplication has been defined, and the dimension of\nsuch a space is the maximum number of nonzero, mutually orthogonal\nvectors it contains. \n\n\nAny collection of \\(N\\) mutually orthogonal vectors of length 1 in an\n\\(N\\)-dimensional vector space constitutes an orthonormal\nbasis for that space. Let \\(\\ket{A_1}, \\ldots, \\ket{A_N}\\) be such a collection of unit vectors. Then every\nvector in the space can be expressed as a sum of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\ket{B} = b_1 \\ket{A_1} + b_2 \\ket{A_2} + \\ldots + b_N \\ket{A_N},\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(b_i = \\braket{B}{A_i}\\). The \\(b_i\\)\u2019s here are\nknown as \\(B\\)\u2019s expansion coefficients in the \\(A\\)-basis.[5]\n\n\nNotice that:\n\nfor all vectors \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) in a given space,\n\n\\[\n\\braket{A}{B+C} = \\braket{A}{B} + \\braket{A}{C}\n\\]\n\nfor any vectors \\(M\\) and \\(Q\\), expressed in terms of the \\(A\\)-basis,\n\n\\[\n\\ket{M} + \\ket{Q} = \\sum_{i=1}^N (m_i + q_i) \\ket{A_i},\n\\]\n\n \n and\n\n \\[\n\\braket{M}{Q} = \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i^* q_i\n \\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another way of writing vectors, namely by writing their\nexpansion coefficients (relative to a given basis) in a column, like\nso: \n\n\\[\n\\ket{Q} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   q_1 \\\\\n   q_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nwhere \\(q_i = \\braket{Q}{A_i}\\) and the \\(A_i\\) are the\nchosen basis vectors. \n\n\nWhen we are dealing with vector spaces of infinite dimension, since\nwe can\u2019t write the whole column of expansion coefficients needed to\npick out a vector since it would have to be infinitely long, so instead\nwe write down the function (called the \u2018wave function\u2019 for\n\\(Q\\), usually represented \\(\\psi(i))\\) which has those coefficients as values. We write down, that is, the\nfunction:\n\n\\[\n\\psi(i) = q_i = \\braket{Q}{A_i}\n\\]\n\n\n\nGiven any vector in, and any basis for, a vector space, we can obtain\nthe wave-function of the vector in that basis; and given a\nwave-function for a vector, in a particular basis, we can construct the\nvector whose wave-function it is. Since it turns out that most of the\nimportant operations on vectors correspond to simple algebraic\noperations on their wave-functions, this is the usual way to represent\nstate-vectors. \n\n\nWhen a pair of physical systems interact, they form a composite\nsystem, and, in quantum mechanics as in classical mechanics, there is a\nrule for constructing the state-space of a composite system from those\nof its components, a rule that tells us how to obtain, from the\nstate-spaces, \\(H_A\\) and \\(H_B\\) for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nrespectively, the state-space \u2014 called the \u2018tensor\nproduct\u2019 of \\(H_A\\) and \\(H_B\\), and written\n\\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\) \u2014 of the pair. There are two important\nthings about the rule; first, so long as \\(H_A\\) and\n\\(H_B\\) are Hilbert spaces, \\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\) will\nbe as well, and second, there are some facts about the way\n\\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\) relates to \\(H_A\\) and\n\\(H_B\\), that have surprising consequences for the relations\nbetween the complex system and its parts. In particular, it turns out\nthat the state of a composite system is not uniquely defined by those\nof its components. What this means, or at least what it appears to\nmean, is that there are, according to quantum mechanics, facts about\ncomposite systems (and not just facts about their spatial\nconfiguration) that don\u2019t supervene on facts about their components; it\nmeans that there are facts about systems as wholes that don\u2019t supervene\non facts about their parts and the way those parts are arranged in\nspace. The significance of this feature of the theory cannot be\noverplayed; it is, in one way or another, implicated in most of its\nmost difficult problems.\n\n\nIn a little more detail: if \\(\\{v_{i}^A\\}\\) is an orthonormal basis\nfor \\(H_A\\) and \\(\\{u_{j}^B\\}\\) is an orthonormal basis for \\(H_B\\), then the\nset of pairs \\((v_{i}^A, u_{j}^B)\\) is taken to form an\northonormal basis for the tensor product space \\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\). The\nnotation \\(v_i^A \\otimes u_j^B\\) is used\nfor the pair \\((v_{i}^A,u_{j}^B)\\), and inner product on \\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\)\nis defined as:[6]\n\n\\[\n\\braket{v_i^A \\otimes u_m^B}{v_j^A \\otimes u_n^B} = \\braket{v_i^A}{v_j^A} \\braket{u_m^B}{u_n^B}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt is a result of this construction that although every vector in\n\\(H_A \\otimes H_B\\) is a linear sum of vectors expressible in the form\n\\(v^A \\otimes u^B\\), not every vector in the space is itself\nexpressible in that form, and it turns out that \n\nany composite state defines uniquely the states of its\ncomponents.\nif the states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are pure (i.e., representable by\nvectors \\(v^A\\) and \\(u^B\\),\nrespectively), then the state of \\((A+B)\\) is pure and represented by\n\\(v^A \\otimes u^B\\),\n and\nif the state of \\((A+B)\\) is pure and expressible in the form\n \\(v^A \\otimes u^B\\),\n then the states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are pure, but\nif the states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not pure, i.e., if they are mixed\nstates (these are defined below), they do not uniquely define the state\nof \\((A+B)\\); in particular, it may be a pure state not expressible in the\nform\n \\(v^A \\otimes u^B\\).\n\n2.2 Operators\n\n\nAn operator \\(O\\) is a mapping of a vector space onto\nitself; it takes any vector \\(\\ket{B}\\) in a space onto another\nvector \\(\\ket{B'}\\) also in\nthe space; \\(O \\ket{B} = \\ket{B'}\\). Linear operators are operators\nthat have the following properties: \n\n\\(O(\\ket{A} + \\ket{B}) = O \\ket{A} + O \\ket{B}\\), and\n\\(O(c \\ket{A}) = c(O \\ket{A})\\).\n\n\n\nJust as any vector in an \\(N\\)-dimensional space can be represented by a\ncolumn of \\(N\\) numbers, relative to a choice of basis for the space, any\nlinear operator on the space can be represented in a column notation by\n\\(N^2\\) numbers: \n\n\\[O = \\begin{bmatrix}\n O_{11} & O_{12} \\\\\n O_{21} & O_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(O_{ij} = \\braket{A_i}{O \\mid A_j}\\) and the \\(A_N\\) are the basis\nvectors of the space. The effect of the linear operator \\(O\\) on the vector\n\\(B\\) is, then, given by \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nO \\ket{B} &=\n  \\begin{bmatrix} O_{11} & O_{12} \\\\\n                  O_{21} & O_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\times \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{bmatrix}\n (O_{11}b_1 + O_{12}b_2) \\\\ (O_{21}b_1 + O_{22}b_2) \\end{bmatrix}  \\\\\n&= (O_{11}b_1 + O_{12}b_2)|A_1\\rangle + (O_{21}b_1 + O_{22}b_2|A_2\\rangle \\\\\n&=|B'\\rangle\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nTwo more definitions before we can say what Hilbert spaces are, and\nthen we can turn to quantum mechanics. \\(\\ket{B}\\) is an\n eigenvector of \\(O\\) with\neigenvalue \\(a\\) if, and only if, \\(O \\ket{B} = a \\ket{B}\\).\nDifferent operators can have different eigenvectors, but the\neigenvector/operator relation depends only on the operator and vectors\nin question, and not on the particular basis in which they are\nexpressed; the eigenvector/operator relation is, that is to say,\ninvariant under change of basis. A Hermitean operator\nis an operator which has the property that there is an orthonormal\nbasis consisting of its eigenvectors and those eigenvalues are all\nreal. \n\n\nA Hilbert space, finally, is a vector space on\nwhich an inner product is defined, and which is complete, i.e., which\nis such that any Cauchy sequence of vectors in the space converges to a\nvector in the space. All finite-dimensional inner product spaces are\ncomplete, and I will restrict myself to these. The infinite case\ninvolves some complications that are not fruitfully entered into at\nthis stage.\n3. Quantum Mechanics\n\n\nFour basic principles of quantum mechanics are: \n\n(3.1)\nPhysical States.\nEvery physical system is associated with a Hilbert Space, every unit\nvector in the space corresponds to a possible pure state of the system,\nand every possible pure state, to some vector in the\n space.[7]\n(3.2)\nPhysical Quantities.\nHermitian operators in the Hilbert space associated with a system\nrepresent physical quantities, and their eigenvalues represent the\npossible results of measurements of those quantities. \nThere is an operator, called the Hamiltonian, that plays a special\nrole in quantum theory because the dynamics of a system can be\nconveniently formulated by tracking its evolution. The Hamiltonian\n\u2013 written \\(H\\), or \\(\\hat{H}\\) \u2013 stands for the total\nenergy of the system. Its eigenvalues are the possible results that\nmight be obtained in measurements of total energy. It is given by\nsumming over the kinetic and potential energies of the system\u2019s\ncomponents.\n(3.3)\nComposition.\nThe Hilbert space associated with a complex system is the tensor\nproduct of those associated with the simple systems (in the standard,\nnon-relativistic, theory: the individual particles) of which it is\ncomposed. \n(3.4)\nDynamics.\n\na.\nContexts of type 1: Given the state of a system at\n\\(t\\) and the forces and constraints to which it is subject, there is\nan equation, \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nequation\u2019, that gives the state at any other time \\(U\n\\ket{v_t} \\rightarrow \\ket{v_{t'}}\\).[8]\n The important properties of \\(U\\) for our\npurposes are that it is deterministic, which is to\nsay that it takes the state of a system at one time into a unique\nstate at any other, it is unitary, which means that\nit is an automorphism of the Hilbert space on which it acts (i.e., a\nmapping of that space onto itself that preserves the linear space\nstructure and inner product), and it is linear, which\nis to say that if it takes a state \\(\\ket{A}\\) onto the state\n\\(\\ket{A'}\\), and it takes the state \\(\\ket{B}\\) onto the state\n\\(\\ket{B'}\\), then it takes any state of the form \\(\\alpha \\ket{A} +\n\\beta \\ket{B}\\) onto the state \\(\\alpha \\ket{A'} + \\beta\n\\ket{B'}\\).\nb.\nContexts of type 2 (\u201cMeasurement\n Contexts\u201d):[9]\nCarrying out a \u201cmeasurement\u201d of an observable \\(B\\) on a\nsystem in a state \\(\\ket{A}\\) has the effect of collapsing the system\ninto a \\(B\\)-eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue observed. This\nis known as the Collapse\nPostulate. Which particular \\(B\\)-eigenstate it\ncollapses into is a matter of probability, and the probabilities are\ngiven by a rule known as Born\u2019s Rule:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(b_i) = |\\braket{A}{B=b_i}|^2\n\\]  \n\n\n\nThere are two important points to note about these two kinds of\ncontexts:\n\nThe distinction between contexts of type 1 and 2 remains to be made\nout in quantum mechanical terms; nobody has managed to say in a\ncompletely satisfactory way, in the terms provided by the theory, which\ncontexts are measurement contexts, and\nEven if the distinction is made out, it is an open interpretive\nquestion whether there are contexts of type 2; i.e., it is an\nopen interpretive question whether there are any contexts in which\nsystems are governed by a dynamical rule other than\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation.\n\n4. Structures on Hilbert Space\n\n\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have\nabout the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the\nspatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all\nof the information that we have about the internal relations among (and\nbetween) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the\nmathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent\n them.[10]\n From a mathematical point of view, what\nreally distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors\nis that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form\nfamilies with a more interesting network of relations among their\nmembers. \n\n\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of\nquantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties\nof those relations, and the most important of them are easily\nsummarized:\n\n(P1)\nAny way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or\nmultiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the\nspace. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1),\nrepresent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is\nthe sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable \\(B\\) with distinct\neigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of \\(B\\), but will be\nassociated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or\nanother result in \\(B\\)-measurements.\n(P2)\nFor any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are\nothers, on the same space, with which it doesn\u2019t share a full set of\neigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such\noperators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\n\n\n\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say\nmore. Assume, for instance, that \n\n(4.1)\nEvery Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space\nassociated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence)\nevery normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2)\nA system has a value for observable \\(A\\) if, and only if, the\nvector representing its state is an eigenstate of the \\(A\\)-operator. The\nvalue it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with\nthat\n eigenstate.[11]\n\n\n\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an\neigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables\nwhich have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that\nno quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of\nthe quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of\nquantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values). \n\n\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product\n\\(H_1 \\otimes H_2\\) of a pair of Hilbert spaces\n\\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) ... In the event that \\(H_1\\) and\n\\(H_2\\) are the state spaces of systems \\(S1\\) and \\(S2\\),\n\\(H_1 \\otimes H_2\\) is the state-space of the complex\nsystem \\((S1+S2)\\). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are\nobservables pertaining to \\((S1+S2)\\) whose values are not determined by\nthe values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\n\n\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and\noperators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and\nobservables, and applying Born\u2019s Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to\ngive empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly\nwell understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics\nlies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical,\nmetaphysical, and epistemological.\n\nAnyone trying to come to an understanding about what quantum mechanics\nsays about the world has to grapple with one remaining fact. This\nproblem is not an issue with Hilbert spaces, but of the dynamics\n\u2013 the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow\nthrough the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more\nworrisome than anything discussed to this point. It not only presents\ndifficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation\nof the theory, but also seems to point to a logical inconsistency in\nthe theory\u2019s foundations.\n\n\nSuppose that we have a system \\(S\\) and a device \\(S^*\\) which measures an\nobservable \\(A\\) on \\(S\\) with values \\(\\{a_1,\na_2, a_3, ...\\}\\). Then there is some\nstate of \\(S^*\\) (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable \\(B\\)\nwith values \\(\\{b_1, b_2,\nb_3, ...\\}\\) pertaining to \\(S^*\\) (its \u2018pointer\nobservable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of\nthe pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument\nin registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if\n\\(S^*\\) is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way\nwith \\(S\\), and if the value of \\(A\\) immediately before the interaction is\n\\(a_1\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value immediately thereafter is\n\\(b_1\\). If, however, \\(A\\)\u2019s value immediately before the\ninteraction is \\(a_2\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value afterwards is\n\\(b_2\\); if the value of \\(A\\) immediately before the\ninteraction is \\(a_3\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value immediately after\nis \\(b_3\\), and so on. That is just what it\nmeans to say that \\(S^*\\) measures \\(A\\). So, if we represent the\njoint, partial state of \\(S\\) and \\(S^*\\) (just the part of it which specifies\nthe value of [\\(A\\) on \\(S\\) & \\(B\\) on \\(S^*\\)], the observable whose values\ncorrespond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on\n\\(S\\) and the pointer observable on \\(S^*\\)) by the vector\n\\(\\ket{A=a_i}_s \\ket{B=b_i}_{s^*}\\), and let \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d\nstand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between\nthe two, to say that \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for \\(A\\) is to say\nthat the dynamical laws entail that,\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*} \\\\\n\\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=b_2}_{s^*} \\\\\n\\ket{A=a_3}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_3}_s \\ket{B=b_3}_{s^*}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nand so on.[12]\n\n\nIntuitively, \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for an observable \\(A\\) just in\ncase there is some observable feature of \\(S^*\\) (it doesn\u2019t matter what,\njust something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the\ndevice), which is correlated with the \\(A\\)-values of systems fed into it\nin such a way that we can read those values off of \\(S^*\\)\u2019s observable\nstate after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, \\(S^*\\) is a\nmeasuring instrument for \\(A\\) just in case there is some observable\nfeature of \\(S^*\\) which tracks or indicates the \\(A\\)-values\nof systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way. \n\n\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of \\(S\\) (too\nmany to count) which are not eigenstates of \\(A\\), and if we consider what\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation tells us about the joint evolution of \\(S\\) and\n\\(S^*\\) when \\(S\\) is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the\npair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [\\(A\\) on \\(S\\)\n& \\(B\\) on \\(S^*\\)]. It doesn\u2019t matter what observable on \\(S\\) is being\nmeasured, and it doesn\u2019t matter what particular superposition \\(S\\) starts\nout in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable,\nif the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nequation, it follows just from the linearity of the \\(U\\) in that equation,\nthe operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the\nlater state of the pair, that the joint state of \\(S\\) and the apparatus\nafter the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this\nobservable on the joint system.\n\n\nSuppose, for example, that we start \\(S^*\\) in its ground state, and \\(S\\) in\nthe state\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_1}_s + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_2}_s\n\\]\n\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the\ncomposite system that the combined state of the pair is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_2}_s \\ket{B = \\text{ground state}}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\nand it follows from the fact that \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for \\(A\\),\nand the linearity of \\(U\\) that their combined state after\ninteraction, is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_2}_s \\ket{B = b_2}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n This, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of\ntype 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are\nany such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the\npair after interaction is either \n\n\\[\n\\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=b_2}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that it\nwill end up in the former, and a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that it will end up\nin the latter. \n\n\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical\nrule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by\ndenying that there are any such contexts), but then we have\nthe problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder\nthat that rule was included in the theory; we know what a\nsystem looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable,\nand we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after\nmeasurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we\nknow from the outset that if a theory tells us something else\nabout the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever\nthat something else is, it is wrong.\n\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum\nmechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about\nwhat the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in\nparticular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on,\nhas to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and\nthey can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components\nare in different pure states, or states of individual systems about\nwhich we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight\nattached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of\nthe ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective\nprobability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second\ncase, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in\nquestion to which the state is assigned is in that state.\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed\nstates, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure\nstates (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with\nthem) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors\nthat represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative\nway of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both\npure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them.\nThere is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density\noperator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it\nturns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about\nstate vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is\ncommon to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the\nofficial rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike \u2013 are\nrepresented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\n\n\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent\nour ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or\nanother pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an\nadequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are\nserious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical\nmixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries\non quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\n\n\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking,\napplies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a\ndiscrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize\nit to the case of continuous observables are\ncomplicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too,\nare best left for detailed discussion.\n\n\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to\napproach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics,\nbut it is only a first step. The more one learns about the\nrelationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space,\nabout how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones,\nand about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through\nthe space, the better will be one\u2019s appreciation of both the nature and\nthe difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny\nbackwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it\nendlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the\nharder the problems get.\n",

The book covers topics of a standard introduction\n to quantum physics, but focuses attention on questions of ontology\n often glossed over in standard texts. The physics student who wants to\n learn quantum mechanics either as preparation for studying foundations\n or simply in a way that looks for clear answers to questions like \u2018What\n are the basic objects in the quantum world?\u2019, \u2018What kinds of\n configurations can they assume?\u2019, \u2018How do they move and interact with one\n another?\u2019 can do no better than starting here.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li> Susskind, L. and Friedman, A., 2014, <em> Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum (2nd edition)</em>, New York: Basic Books.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n At 384 pages, this book isn\u2019t as pithy as the\n title would suggest. It provides very clear presentation of the\n principles of quantum mechanics for the physics student without\n any previous background. This is how one would learn quantum\n mechanics in a standard university course.\n </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"QuanMechText\">Quantum Mechanics Textbooks</h3>\n<p>\n\nThere are a great many textbooks available for studying quantum\nmechanics. Here are a few especially important ones with some notes to\nguide choices among them. It is good to work with two or three texts\nwhen learning QM. No text is perfect and differences in approach can\nilluminate the subject from different angles.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Ballentine, L., 1998, <em>Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Approach</em>,\nSingapore: World Scientific Publishing Company.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\nThis book is not recommended for beginners, and not\nrecommended as a textbook. It is recommended once one has some\ntechnical background to deepen understanding of the fundamental\nconcepts of quantum mechanics.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Basdevant, J.L., and J. Dalibard, 2005, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>,\nBerlin: Springer.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a brief, but elegant introduction. There aren\u2019t a\ngreat many problems, but detailed solutions are provided for those that\nare included. The book comes with a CD-ROM that is very helpful\nfor visualization.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Dirac, P.A.M., 1930 [1958], <em>The Principles of Quantum\nMechanics</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930; 4th edition, revised,\n1958.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a classic, beautiful book that remains one of the clearest\npresentations of quantum mechanics. Everything is presented with\nextreme simplicity using Dirac\u2019s formulation with non-commutative\nalgebra. Even a beginner will be able to follow the presentation. The\nbook emphasizes logical structure, in Dirac\u2019s words: \u201cproblems were\ntackled top-down, by working on the great principles, with the details\nleft to look after themselves.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>Cohen-Tannoudji, C., 2006, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>,\nNew York: Wiley-Interscience.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a comprehensive, encyclopedic text. It\u2019s\nnot the best to learn from, but is a good reference book.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Gasiorowicz, S., 1995, <em>Quantum Physics</em> (3rd edition),\nNew York: Wiley.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a decent text, relatively well-written.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Griffiths, D., 1995 [2018], <em>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</em>\n(2nd edition), Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall; 3rd edition, 2018.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a standard undergraduate text for a first\ncourse in QM, and I would recommend it as a starting point for\nbeginners. It is concise and very easy to read. There is an emphasis\non conceptual development. Unfortunately, there are no worked examples\nin the book, and the answers to the problems are available only to\ninstructors. It is easy to find and has recently been updated.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Liboff, R., 1998, <em>Introductory Quantum Mechanics</em> (4th edition),\nSan Francisco: Addison-Wesley.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a nicely designed book, relatively\nwell-written. It is a good starting point for beginners, but not at\ncomprehensive as Shankar.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Merzbacher, E., 1997, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> (3rd edition),\nNew York: Wiley.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a standard graduate text in the US, not recommended\nfor beginners, but quite good at an advanced level.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Sakurai, J.J., 1993 [2021], <em>Modern Quantum Mechanics</em>\n(revised edition), Reading, MA: Addison Wesley; third edition, with\ncoauthor Jim Napolitano, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is generally used as a graduate text. It is\nwell-written and there is emphasis on experimental phenomena and\nimportant questions like Bell\u2019s Inequality. The material is introduced\nat a higher level than Griffiths and Shankar, with lots of\nmathematics. There is a wealth of problems, but unfortunately few\nsolutions are provided, making it most useful in a classroom setting\nor in conjunction with a book that contains worked examples and\nderivations.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Schwinger, J., 2003, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> (corrected\nedition), Berlin: Springer.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This book is extremely mathematical in\nemphasis. There is less emphasis on conceptual development, and it is\nbest used after one has acquired a conceptual understanding of QM and\nwants to see the mathematical development. The approach is very\nrevealing. It is a difficult text, in part because some of the\nformalism is abstract and unconventional, but it is well worth the\neffort to comprehend. The problems throughout are excellent, but again\nunfortunately, solutions are not included in the text.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Shankar, R., 1994, <em>Principles of Quantum Mechanics</em>\n(2nd edition), Berlin: Springer.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This book is highly recommended as a starting\npoint. It starts from ground zero, developing the mathematical tools\nneeded to understand quantum mechanics. It is well written, and\nfriendlier than Griffiths for students who are learning the subject on\ntheir own. QM is not introduced until page 115. \u2028The\nintroductory chapter on linear algebra is very good. At 676 pages, it\nis comprehensive. It covers Feynman path integrals more thoroughly\nthan other books, and contains solved problems. If you buy one book on\nQM, this is a good choice.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Zettili, N., 2009, <em>Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications</em>,\nChichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a very good book as well. It covers\ntheory and problem solving in an integrated way. It is easy to follow\nand full of problems and solutions that are related to the\nexperimental basis of the theory.\n </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"UsefGeneTextMathPhys\">Useful General Texts in Mathematics and Physics</h3>\n<p>\n\nWhether studying quantum mechanics on one\u2019s own, or in a\nclassroom setting, it is useful to have these books on hand as\naccompaniments. Even a seasoned teacher will find himself from\ntime to time reaching for them:</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Benenson, W., J. Harris, H. Stoecker, , and H. Lutz,\n2006, <em>Handbook of Physics</em> (2nd edition), Berlin:\nSpringer.</li>\n<li>Bronshtein, I.N., and K.A.

Most of the active research is published in\njournals. The discussion surrounding standard non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics has stabilized in a way that makes it possible to\nsurvey. Three recent books absorb and organize the work of these\ndecades.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Barrett, J., 2019, <em>The Conceptual Foundations of Quantum\nMechanics</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is a recent text on the history and\n conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics. It will serve an\n excellent primary text on the foundations of quantum mechanics\n for philosophy students, and will also make an excellent\n supplement to the standard quantum physics texts of physics\n students.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Lewis, P., 2016, <em>Quantum Ontology: A Guide to the Metaphysics\nof Quantum Mechanics </em>, New York: Oxford University Press.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n Lewis\u2019s book gives a very good presentation of\n the most influential and well-developed interpretations of the\n formalism and provides an even-handed comparative assessment. It\n provides is an up-to-date survey of the landscape with\n sophisticated analysis and commentary. The book is well-suited\n for use in or for the layperson with a serious interest in\n foundations. The discussion is sophisticated without undue\n technicality and manages philosophical analysis in a jargon-free\n way.\n </p>\n</li>\n<li>Maudlin, T., 2019, <em>Philosophy of Physics: Quantum Theory</em>,\nPrinceton: Princeton University Press.\n <p class=\"bibnote\">\n This is an excellent, if challenging\n introduction to quantum foundations. The book is unparalleled in\n clarity and uncompromising in its insistence on ontological\n intelligibility. It is more selective than Lewis and Barrett\u2019s\n book (it covers Everettian Quantum Mechanics and Bohmian\n Mechanics and Spontaneous Collapse theories, but the Copenhagen\n approach is dismissed because it doesn\u2019t have an explicit\n ontology). The author makes no bones about where his own\n sympathies lie, but it will reward the study of any beginning\n student or seasoned practitioner.\n </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\nHere are some general texts to introduce you to the philosophy of\nQM.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Albert, D., 1994, <em>Quantum Mechanics and Experience</em>,\nCambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</li>\n<li>Bell, J.S., 1987, <em>Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum\nMechanics</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</li>\n<li>Busch, P., P.
