There are two\nprominent candidate reasons as to why this is so. For one, a central\naim of architecture is to design shelter and so meet a variety of\nsocial needs. For another, architecture as practice is a social\nprocess or activity as it engages people in interpersonal relations of\na social cast.\nThe first candidate reason stands or falls on whether, in\nfulfilling social needs, architecture is thereby rendered a social\nart. For an artform to be intrinsically social, any such need\nfulfilled should be critical rather than discretionary or\nextravagant. Thus, for example, addressing housing demands overall\nmeets the criticality test\u2014though addressing design demands for\na third home does not. The first reason looks right because architects\noften integrate social needs into design thinking. Armed with socially\nminded intentions, they create built structures which serve myriad\nsocial ends. A difficulty arises, however, in consistently upholding\nsuch intentions as a mark of the social if (a) such intentions are\nunclear from experiencing architectural objects, instantiations, or\nrepresentations thereof, (b) built structures are repurposed, or (c)\nthere are architectural objects with no corresponding relevant\nintentions. (As an instance, we might consider \u201cfound\u201d\narchitectural objects like inhabited caves.)\nA second candidate reason that architecture is a social art is that\nprocesses of making architecture are thoroughly and ineluctably social\nphenomena, constituted by interactions of social groupings created and\ngoverned by social conventions and arrangements. On this view, the\nsocial nature of architecture consists in the status of the discipline\nas shaped by social convention\u2014where such convention is\ndesignated by, and guides actions of, architects and other relevant\nagents. (This reason directly links the social nature of architecture\nto its social impact\u2014hence to sociology of architecture; see \u00a78.2.) Architectural phenomena are\nsocial, then, because they occur as a result of contracts, meetings,\nfirms, charettes, crits, juries, projects, competitions, exhibitions,\npartnerships, professional organizations, negotiations, workflow\norganization, division of labor, and myriad other conventional and\nagreement-bound purposive actions and groupings of architects and\nother architectural stakeholders. One might object that, on an\ninstitutional theory, all artforms are social in just these\nways. However, as played out in art worlds, institutional theories\ntell us what counts as an art object rather than how such objects are\nconstituted to begin with. Proponents of this candidate must rule out\na na\u00efve architecture scenario, the possibility of a lone\narchitect who has no socially significant engagements such as shape\nher creations.\nEither view is temporally sensitive. These parameters and how they\nconstitute architecture\u2019s sociality will change over time, along\nwith vicissitudes in social needs, conventions, and relations.\n",
