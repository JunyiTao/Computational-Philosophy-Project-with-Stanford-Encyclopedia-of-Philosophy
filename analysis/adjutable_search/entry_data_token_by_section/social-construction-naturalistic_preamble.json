    "main_text": "\n\nSocial \u201cconstruction,\u201d \u201cconstructionism\u201d and\n\u201cconstructivism\u201d are terms in wide use in the humanities\nand social sciences, and are applied to a diverse range of objects\nincluding the emotions, gender, race, sex, homo- and hetero-sexuality,\nmental illness, technology, quarks, facts, reality, and truth. This\nsort of terminology plays a number of different roles in different\ndiscourses, only some of which are philosophically interesting, and\nfewer of which admit of a \u201cnaturalistic\u201d approach\u2014an\napproach that treats science as a central and successful (if sometimes\nfallible) source of knowledge about the world. If there is any core\nidea of social constructionism, it is that some object or objects are\ncaused or controlled by social or cultural factors rather than natural\nfactors, and if there is any core motivation of such research, it is\nthe aim of showing that such objects are or were under our control:\nthey could be, or might have been, otherwise.\n\nDetermination of our representations of the world (including our\nideas, concepts, beliefs, and theories of the world) by factors other\nthan the way the world is may undermine our faith that any independent\nphenomena are represented or tracked, undermining the idea that there\nis a fact of the matter about which way of representing is correct.\nAnd determination of the non-representational facts of the world by\nour theories seems to reverse the \u201cdirection of fit\u201d\nbetween representation and reality presupposed by our idea of\nsuccessful epistemic activity. For both of these reasons, proponents\nand opponents of constructionist thought have held it to embody a\nchallenge to the naturalism endemic in contemporary philosophy. But\nsocial constructionist themes can be and have been picked up by\nnaturalists who hope to accommodate the interesting and important\ncultural phenomena documented by constructionist authors while denying\nmore radical anti-scientific and anti-realist theses widely associated\nwith social constructionism.\n\nI begin by discussing social constructionism, and I then discuss some\nthreads of contemporary naturalism. I go on to consider two different\nsorts of objects of social construction\u2014representations and\nhuman traits\u2014and discuss naturalistic, constructionist\napproaches to them.\n",
