    "main_text": "Double Extension Set Theory: A Curiosity\n11. Conclusion\n\nWe have presented a wide range of theories here. The theories\nmotivated by essentially different views of the realm of mathematics\n(the constructive theories and the theories which support nonstandard\nanalysis) we set to one side. Similarly, the theories motivated by the\ndesire to keep the universe small can be set to one side. The\nalternative classical set theories which support a fluent development\nof mathematics seem to be ZFC or its variants with classes\n(including Ackermann), NFU + Infinity + Choice with suitable\nstrong infinity axioms (to get s.c. sets to behave nicely), and the\npositive set theory of Esser. Any of these is adequate for the\npurpose, in our opinion, including the one currently in use. There is\nno compelling reason for mathematicians to use a different foundation\nthan ZFC; but there is a good reason for mathematicians who\nhave occasion to think about foundations to be aware that there are\nalternatives; otherwise there is a danger that accidental features of\nthe dominant system of set theory will be mistaken for essential\nfeatures of any foundation of mathematics. For example, it is\nfrequently said that the universal set (an extension which is actually\ntrivially easy to obtain in a weak set theory) is an inconsistent\ntotality; the actual situation is merely that one cannot have a\nuniversal set while assuming Zermelo\u2019s axiom of separation.\n",
