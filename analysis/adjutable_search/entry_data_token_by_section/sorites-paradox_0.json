    "main_text": "The Sorites in History\n1. The Sorites in History\n\nThe Megarian philosopher Eubulides (4th century BC) is\nusually credited with the first formulation of the puzzle. (The name\n\u2018sorites\u2019 derives from the Greek word soros,\nmeaning \u2018heap\u2019.) Although we don\u2019t know his\nmotivations for introducing it (along with several other legendary\npuzzles), the paradox was later used by Greek philosophers as a\ndialectical weapon, most notably by the Sceptics against the Stoics\u2019\nclaims to knowledge.\n\nCuriously, the paradox attracted little subsequent interest until the\nlate 19th century. Marxist philosophers in the neo-Hegelian\ntradition, like Plekhanov (1908 [1937: 114]), cited the paradox as\nevidence of the failure of \u201ccustomary\u201d logic and the\nutility of the \u2018logic of contradiction\u2019. In this way some\nMarxists sought to establish the triumph of the dialectic. Meanwhile,\nin Anglo-American philosophy, formal logic regained its central place,\nand its classical formalisation left no room for the vagueness of\nnatural language. Vagueness and the associated paradox were seen as\nlying beyond the scope of logic and so posing no challenge to it.\nHowever, since the demise of the ideal language doctrines of the\nlatter half of the twentieth century (see\n \u00a73.1),\n interest in the idiosyncrasies of natural language, including its\nvagueness, has greatly increased. \n",
