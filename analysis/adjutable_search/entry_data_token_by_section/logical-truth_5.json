    "main_text": "The Mathematical Characterization of Logical Truth || The Problem of Adequacy\n2.4 The Problem of Adequacy\n\nThe fact that the notions of derivability and model-theoretic validity\nare definable in standard mathematics seems to have been a very\nattractive feature of them among practicing logicians. But this\nattractive feature of course does not justify by itself taking either\nnotion as an adequate characterization of logical truth. On most\nviews, with a mathematical characterization of logical truth we\nattempt to delineate a set of formulae possessing a number of\nnon-mathematical properties. Which properties these are varies\ndepending on our pretheoretic conception of, for example, the features\nof modality and formality. (By \u201cpretheoretic\u201d it's not\nmeant \u201cprevious to any theoretical activity\u201d; there could\nhardly be a \u201cpretheoretic\u201d conception of logical truth in\nthis sense. In this context what's meant is \u201cprevious to the\ntheoretical activity of mathematical characterization\u201d.) But on\nany such conception there will be external, non-mathematical criteria\nthat can be applied to evaluate the question whether a mathematical\ncharacterization is adequate. In this last section we will outline\nsome of the basic issues and results on the question whether\nderivability and model-theoretic validity are adequate in this\nsense.\n2.4.1 Analysis and Modality\n\nOne frequent objection to the adequacy of model-theoretic validity is\nthat it does not provide a conceptual analysis of the notion of\nlogical truth, even for sentences of Fregean formalized languages (see\ne.g. Pap 1958, p. 159; Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 642; Field 1989, pp.\n33\u20134; Etchemendy 1990, ch. 7). This complaint is especially\ncommon among authors who feel inclined to identify logical truth and\nanalyticity simpliciter (see e.g. Kneale and Kneale,\nibid., Etchemendy 1990, p. 126). If one thinks of the concept\nof logical truth simply as the concept of analytic truth, it is\nespecially reasonable to accept that the concept of logical truth does\nnot have much to do with the concept of model-theoretic validity, for\npresumably this concept does not have much to do with the concept of\nanalyticity. To say that a formula is model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are no set-theoretic structures in which it is false;\nhence, to say that a formula is not model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are set-theoretic structures in which it is false. But to\nsay that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably does not mean\nanything about the existence or non-existence of set-theoretic\nstructures. Note that we could object to derivability on the same\ngrounds, for to say that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably\ndoes not mean anything about its being or not being the product of a\ncertain algorithm (compare Etchemendy 1990, p. 3). (One further\npeculiar, much debated claim in Etchemendy 1990 is that true claims of\nthe form \u201c\\(F\\) is logically true\u201d or \u201c\\(F\\) is not\nlogically true\u201d should themselves be logical truths (while the\ncorresponding claims \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d and \u201cNot\nMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d are not logical truths). Etchemendy's claim is\nperhaps defensible under a conception of logical truth as analyticity\nsimpliciter, but certainly doubtful on more traditional\nconceptions of logical truth, on which the predicate \u201cis a\nlogical truth\u201d is not even a logical expression. See\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9 and Soames 1999, ch. 4 for\ndiscussion.)\n\nAnalogous \u201cno conceptual analysis\u201d objections can be made\nif we accept that the concept of logical truth has some other strong\nmodal notes unrelated to analyticity; for example, if we accept that\nit is part of the concept of logical truth that logical truths are\ntrue in all counterfactual circumstances, or necessary in some other\nstrong sense. Sher (1996) accepts something like the requirement that\na good characterization of logical truth should be given in terms of a\nmodally rich concept. However, she argues that the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity is strongly modal, and so the \u201cno\nconceptual analysis\u201d objection is actually wrong: to say that a\nformula is or is not model-theoretically valid is to make a\nmathematical existence or non-existence claim, and according to Sher\nthese claims are best read as claims about the possibility and\nnecessity of structures. (Shalkowski 2004 argues that Sher's defense\nof model-theoretic validity is insufficient, on the basis of a certain\nmetaphysical conception of logical necessity. Etchemendy 2008\nrelatedly argues that Sher's defense is based on inadequate\nrestrictions on the modality relevant to logical truth. See also the\ncritical discussion of Sher in Hanson 1997.) Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n(1993) offers a view related to Sher's: model-theoretic validity\nprovides a (correct) conceptual analysis of logical truth for Fregean\nlanguages, because the notion of a set-theoretical structure is in\nfact a subtle refinement of the modal notion of a possible meaning\nassignment. Azzouni (2006), ch. 9, also defends the view that\nmodel-theoretic validity provides a correct conceptual analysis of\nlogical truth (though restricted to first-order languages), on the\nbasis of a certain deflationist conception of the (strong) modality\ninvolved in logical truth.\n\nThe standard view of set-theoretic claims, however, does not see them\nas strong modal claims\u2014at best, some of them are modal in the\nminimal sense that they are universal generalizations or particular\ncases of these. But it is at any rate unclear that this is the basis\nfor a powerful objection to model-theoretic validity or to\nderivability, for, even if we accept that the concept of logical truth\nis strongly modal, it is unclear that a good characterization of\nlogical truth ought to be a conceptual analysis. An analogy might\nhelp. It is widely agreed that the characterizations of the notion of\ncomputability in standard mathematics, e.g. as recursiveness, are in\nsome sense good characterizations. Note that the concept of\ncomputability is modal, in a moderately strong sense; it\nseems to be about what beings like us could do with certain symbols if\nthey were free from certain limitations\u2014not about, say, what\nexisting beings have done or will do. However, to say that a certain\nfunction is recursive is not to make a modal claim about it, but a\ncertain purely arithmetical claim. So recursiveness is widely agreed\nto provide a good characterization of computability, but it clearly\ndoes not provide a conceptual analysis. Perhaps it could be argued\nthat the situation with model-theoretic validity, or derivability, or\nboth, is the same.\n\nA number of philosophers explicitly reject the requirement that a good\ncharacterization of logical truth should provide a conceptual\nanalysis, and (at least for the sake of argument) do not question the\nusual view of set-theoretic claims as non-modal, but have argued that\nthe universe of set-theoretic structures somehow models the universe\nof possible structures (or at least the universe of possible\nset-theoretic structures; see McGee 1992, Shapiro 1998, Sagi 2014). In\nthis indirect sense, the characterization in terms of model-theoretic\nvalidity would grasp part of the strong modal force that logical\ntruths are often perceived to possess. McGee (1992) gives an elegant\nargument for this idea: it is reasonable to think that given any\nset-theoretic structure, even one construed out of non-mathematical\nindividuals, actualized or not, there is a set-theoretic structure\nisomorphic to it but construed exclusively out of pure sets; but any\nsuch pure set-theoretic structure is, on the usual view, an actualized\nexistent; so every possible set-theoretic structure is modeled by a\nset-theoretic structure, as desired. (The significance of this relies\non the fact that in Fregean languages a formula is true in a structure\nif and only if it is true in all the structures isomorphic to it.)\n\nBut model-theoretic validity (or derivability) might be theoretically\nadequate in some way even if some possible meaning-assignments are not\nmodeled straightforwardly by (actual) set-theoretic structures. For\nmodel-theoretic validity to be theoretically adequate, it might be\nheld, it is enough if we have other reasons to think that it is\nextensionally adequate, i.e. that it coincides in extension with our\npreferred pretheoretic notion of logical truth. In subsections 2.4.2\nand 2.4.3 we will examine some existing arguments for and against the\nplain extensional adequacy of derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity for Fregean languages.\n2.4.2 Extensional Adequacy: A General Argument\n\nIf one builds one's deductive calculus with care, one will be able to\nconvince oneself that all the formulae derivable in the calculus are\nlogical truths. The reason is that one can have used one's intuition\nvery systematically to obtain that conviction: one can have included\nin one's calculus only axioms of which one is convinced that they are\nlogical truths; and one can have included as rules of inference rules\nof which one is convinced that they produce logical truths when\napplied to logical truths. Using another terminology, this means that,\nif one builds one's calculus with care, one will be convinced that the\nderivability characterization of logical truth for formulae of the\nformalized language will be sound with respect to logical\ntruth.\n\nIt is equally obvious that if one has at hand a notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity for a formalized language which is based on a\nminimally reasonable notion of structure, then all logical truths (of\nthat language) will be model-theoretically valid. The reason is\nsimple: if a formula is not model-theoretically valid then there is a\nstructure in which it is false; but this structure must then model a\nmeaning assignment (or assignments) on which the formula (or its\nlogical form) is false; so it will be possible to construct a formula\nwith the same logical form, whose non-logical expressions have, by\nstipulation, the particular meanings drawn from that collective\nmeaning assignment, and which is therefore false. But then the idea of\nformality and the weakest conception of the modal force of logical\ntruths uncontroversially imply that the original formula is not\nlogically true. Using another terminology, we can conclude that\nmodel-theoretic validity is complete with respect to logical\ntruth.\n\nLet's abbreviate \u201c\\(F\\) is derivable in calculus \\(C\\)\u201d by\n\u201cDC\\((F)\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(F\\) is a logical truth (in our\npreferred pretheoretical sense)\u201d by \u201cLT\\((F)\\)\u201d.\nThen, if \\(C\\) is a calculus built to suit our pretheoretic conception\nof logical truth, the situation can be summarized thus:\n\n(4)  \\(\\text{DC}(F)\n\\Rightarrow \\text{LT}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{MTValid}(F).\\) \n\n\nThe first implication is the soundness of derivability; the second is\nthe completeness of model-theoretic validity.\n\nIn order to convince ourselves that the characterizations of logical\ntruth in terms of DC\\((F)\\) and MTValid\\((F)\\) are extensionally\nadequate we should convince ourselves that the converse implications\nhold too:\n\n(5) \n\\(\\text{MTValid}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{LT}(F) \\Rightarrow\n\\text{DC}(F).\\) \n\n\nObtaining this conviction, or the conviction that these implications\ndon't in fact hold, turns out to be difficult in general. But a remark\nof Kreisel (1967) establishes that a conviction that they hold can be\nobtained sometimes. In some cases it is possible to give a\nmathematical proof that derivability (in some specified calculus\n\\(C\\)) is complete with respect to model-theoretic validity, i.e. a\nproof of\n\n(6) \n\\(\\text{MTValid}(F) \\Rightarrow \\text{DC}(F).\\) \n\n\nKreisel called attention to the fact that (6) together with (4)\nimplies that model-theoretic validity is sound with respect to logical\ntruth, i.e., that the first implication of (5) holds. (Strictly\nspeaking, this is a strong generalization of Kreisel's remark, which\nin place of \u201c\\(\\text{LT}(F)\\)\u201d had something like\n\u201c\\(F\\) is true in all class structures\u201d\n(structures with a class, possibly proper, as domain of the individual\nvariables).) This means that when (6) holds the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity offers an extensionally correct\ncharacterization of logical truth. (See Etchemendy 1990, ch. 11,\nHanson 1997, G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9, and Field 2008, ch. 2, for\nversions of this observation, and Smith 2011 and Griffiths 2014 for\nobjections.) Also, (6), together with (4), implies that the notion of\nderivability is complete with respect to logical truth (the second\nimplication in (5)) and hence offers an extensionally correct\ncharacterization of this notion. Note that this reasoning is very\ngeneral and independent of what our particular pretheoretic conception\nof logical truth is.\n\nAn especially significant case in which this reasoning can be applied\nis the case of standard Fregean first-order quantificational\nlanguages, under a wide array of pretheoretic conceptions of logical\ntruth. It is typical to accept that all formulae derivable in a\ntypical first-order calculus are universally valid, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, a priori and analytic if any\nformula\n is.[10]\n So (4) holds under a wide array of pretheoretic conceptions in this\ncase. (6) holds too for the typical calculi in question, in virtue of\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem, so (5) holds. This means that one\ncan convince oneself that both derivability and model-theoretic\nvalidity are extensionally correct characterizations of our favorite\npretheoretic notion of logical truth for first-order languages, if our\npretheoretic conception is not too eccentric. The situation is not so\nclear in other languages of special importance for the Fregean\ntradition, the higher-order quantificational languages.\n2.4.3 Extensional Adequacy: Higher-order Languages\n\nIt follows from G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem that already\nfor a second-order language there is no calculus \\(C\\) where\nderivability is sound with respect to model-theoretic validity and\nwhich makes true (6) (for the notion of model-theoretic validity as\nusually defined for such a language). We may call this result the\nincompleteness of second-order calculi with respect to model-theoretic\nvalidity. Said another way: for every second-order calculus \\(C\\)\nsound with respect to model-theoretic validity there will be a formula\n\\(F\\) such that \\(\\text{MTValid}(F)\\) but it is not the case that\n\\(\\text{DC}(F)\\).\n\nIn this situation it's not possible to apply Kreisel's argument for\n(5). In fact, the incompleteness of second-order calculi shows that,\ngiven any calculus \\(C\\) satisfying (4), one of the implications of\n(5) is false (or both are): either derivability in\n\\(C\\) is incomplete with respect to logical truth or\nmodel-theoretic validity is unsound with respect to logical truth.\n\nDifferent authors have extracted opposed lessons from incompleteness.\nA common reaction is to think that model-theoretic validity must be\nunsound with respect to logical truth. This is especially frequent in\nphilosophers on whose conception logical truths must be a\npriori or analytic. One idea is that the results of a\npriori reasoning or of analytic thinking ought to be codifiable\nin a calculus. (See e.g. Wagner 1987, p. 8.) But even if we grant this\nidea, it's doubtful that the desired conclusion follows. Suppose that\n(i) every a priori or analytic reasoning must be reproducible\nin a calculus. We accept also, of course, that (ii) for every\ncalculus \\(C\\) sound with respect to model-theoretic validity\nthere is a model-theoretically valid formula that is not\nderivable in \\(C\\). From all this it doesn't follow that (iii)\nthere is a model-theoretically valid formula \\(F\\) such that\nfor every calculus \\(C\\) sound for model-theoretic validity\n\\(F\\) is not derivable in C. From (iii) and (i) it follows of\ncourse that there are model-theoretically valid formulae that are not\nobtainable by a priori or analytic reasoning. But the step\nfrom (ii) to (iii) is a typical quantificational fallacy. From (i) and\n(ii) it doesn't follow that there is any model-theoretically valid\nformula which is not obtainable by a priori or analytic\nreasoning. The only thing that follows (from (ii) alone under the\nassumptions that model-theoretic validity is sound with respect to\nlogical truth and that logical truths are a priori and\nanalytic) is that no calculus sound with respect to model-theoretic\nvalidity can by itself model all the a priori or\nanalytic reasonings that people are able to make. But it's not\nsufficiently clear that this should be intrinsically problematic.\nAfter all, a priori and analytic reasonings must start from\nbasic axioms and rules, and for all we know a reflective mind may have\nan inexhaustible ability to find new truths and truth-preserving rules\nby a priori or analytic consideration of even a meager stock\nof concepts. The claim that all analytic truths ought to be derivable\nin one single calculus is perhaps plausible on the view that\nanalyticity is to be explained by conventions or \u201ctacit\nagreements\u201d, for these agreements are presumably finite in\nnumber, and their implications are presumably at most effectively\nenumerable. But this view is just one problematic idea about how\napriority and analyticity should be explicated. (See also Etchemendy\n1990, chs. 8, 9, for an argument for the unsoundness of higher-order\nmodel-theoretic validity based on the conception of logical truth as\nanalyticity simpliciter, and G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9,\nSoames 1999, ch. 4, Paseau 2014, Florio and Incurvati 2019, 2021, and\nGriffiths and Paseau 2022, ch. 9, for critical reactions.)\n\nAnother type of unsoundness arguments attempt to show that there is\nsome higher-order formula that is model-theoretically valid but is\nintuitively false in a structure whose domain is a proper class. (The\n\u201cintended interpretation\u201d of set theory, if it exists at\nall, might be one such structure, for it is certainly not a set; see\nthe entry on\n set theory.)\n These arguments thus question the claim that each meaning\nassignment's validity-refuting power is modeled by some set-theoretic\nstructure, a claim which is surely a corollary of the first\nimplication in (5). (In McGee 1992 there is a good example; there is\ncritical discussion in G\u00f3mez-Torrente 1998/9.) The most\nwidespread view among set theorists seems to be that there are no\nformulae with that property in Fregean languages, but it's certainly\nnot an absolutely firm belief of theirs. Note that these arguments\noffer a challenge only to the idea that universal validity (as defined\nin section 2.3) is adequately modeled by set-theoretic validity, not\nto the soundness of a characterization of logical truth in terms of\nuniversal validity itself, or in terms of a species of validity based\non some notion of \u201cmeaning assignment\u201d different from the\nusual notion of a set-theoretic structure. (The arguments we mentioned\nin the preceding paragraph and in 2.4.1 would have deeper implications\nif correct, for they easily imply challenges to all characterizations\nin terms of species of validity as well). In fact, worries of this\nkind have prompted the proposal of a different kind of notions of\nvalidity (for Fregean languages), in which set-theoretic structures\nare replaced with suitable values of higher-order variables in a\nhigher-order language for set theory, e.g. with \u201cplural\ninterpretations\u201d (see Boolos 1985, Rayo and Uzquiano 1999,\nWilliamson 2003, Florio and Incurvati 2021; see also Florio and\nLinnebo 2021 and the entry on\n plural quantification).\n Both set-theoretic and proper class structures are modeled by such\nvalues, so these particular worries of unsoundness do not affect this\nkind of proposals.\n\nIn general, there are no fully satisfactory philosophical arguments\nfor the thesis that model-theoretic validity is unsound with respect\nto logical truth in higher-order languages. Are there then any good\nreasons to think that derivability (in any calculus sound for\nmodel-theoretic validity) must be incomplete with respect to logical\ntruth? There don't seem to be any absolutely convincing reasons for\nthis view either. The main argument (the first version of which was\nperhaps first made explicit in Tarski 1936a, 1936b) seems to be this.\nAs noted above, G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem implies that\nfor any calculus for a higher-order language there will be a\nmodel-theoretically valid formula that will not be derivable in the\ncalculus. As it turns out, the formula obtained by the G\u00f6del\nconstruction is also always intuitively true in all domains\n(set-theoretical or not), and it's reasonable to think of it as\nuniversally valid. (It's certainly not a formula false in a proper\nclass structure.) The argument concludes that for any calculus there\nare logically true formulae that are not derivable in it.\n\nFrom this it has been concluded that derivability (in any calculus)\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But a fundamental\nproblem is that this conclusion is based on two assumptions that will\nnot necessarily be granted by the champion of derivability: first, the\nassumption that the expressions typically cataloged as logical in\nhigher-order languages, and in particular the quantifiers in\nquantifications of the form \\(\\forall X\\) (where \\(X\\) is a\nhigher-order variable), are in fact logical expressions; and second,\nthe assumption that being universally valid is a sufficient condition\nfor logical truth. On these assumptions it is certainly very\nreasonable to think that derivability, in any calculus satisfying (4),\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But in the absence\nof additional considerations, a critic may question the assumptions,\nand deny relevance to the argument. The second assumption would\nprobably be questioned e.g. from the point of view that logical truths\nmust be analytic, for there is no conclusive reason to think that\nuniversally valid formulae must be analytic. The first assumption\nactually underlies any conviction one may have that (4) holds for any\none particular higher-order calculus. (Note that if we denied that the\nhigher-order quantifiers are logical expressions we could equally deny\nthat the arguments presented above against the soundness of\nmodel-theoretic validity with respect to logical truth are\nrelevant at all.) That the higher-order quantifiers are logical has\noften been denied on the grounds that they are semantically too\n\u201csubstantive\u201d. It is often pointed out in this connection\nthat higher-order quantifications can be used to define sophisticated\nset-theoretic properties that one cannot define just with the help of\nfirst-order quantifiers. (Defenders of the logical status of\nhigher-order quantifications, on the other hand, point to the wide\napplicability of the higher-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare analogous to the first-order quantifiers, to the fact that they\nare typically needed to provide categorical axiomatizations of\nmathematical structures, etc. See Quine (1970), ch. 5, for the\nstandard exponent of the restrictive view, and Boolos (1975) and\nShapiro (1991) for standard exponents of the liberal view.)
