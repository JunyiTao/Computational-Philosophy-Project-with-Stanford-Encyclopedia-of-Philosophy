    "main_text": "The Collapse of the Wave Function\n8. The Collapse of the Wave Function\n\nIn the previous section we indicated that collapse of the wave\nfunction can be regarded in Bohmian mechanics as a pragmatic affair,\nthat the collapse of the wave function is an effective\ncollapse.  However, there is a sense in which the collapse of the wave\nfunction in Bohmian mechanics is more than a matter of convenience, a\nsense in which the collapse is actual and not merely\neffective. Indeed, if we focus on the appropriate notion of the wave\nfunction, not of the composite of system and apparatus\u2014which\nstrictly speaking remains a superposition if the composite is treated\nas closed during the measurement process\u2014but of the system\nitself, we find that for Bohmian mechanics this wave function does in\nfact collapse, precisely as the quantum formalism says. The key\nelement here is the notion of the\nconditional wave function of a subsystem of a larger system,\nwhich we describe briefly in this section and that D\u00fcrr,\nGoldstein, & Zangh\u00ec 1992a: Section 5, discuss in some\ndetail, together with the related notion of the effective wave\nfunction. \n\nOne of the defining equations of Bohmian mechanics is\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, governing the evolution of the wave\nfunction. Among the defining equations there is no additional\nevolution equation prescibing collapse of the wave function.\nNonetheless the textbook collapse rule is a consequence of the Bohmian\ndynamics. To appreciate this one should first note that, since\nobservation implies interaction, a system under observation cannot be\na closed system but rather must be a subsystem of a larger closed\nsystem, which we may take to be the entire universe, or any smaller\nmore or less closed system that contains the system to be observed,\nthe subsystem. The configuration \\(Q\\) of this larger system\nnaturally splits into \\(X\\), the configuration of the subsystem, and\n\\(Y\\), the configuration of the environment of the\nsubsystem.\n\nSuppose the larger system has wave function \\(\\Psi = \\Psi(q) = \\Psi(x,\ny)\\). According to Bohmian mechanics, the larger system is then\ncompletely described by \\(\\Psi\\), evolving according to\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, together with \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The\nquestion then arises\u2014and it is a critical question\u2014as to\nwhat should be meant by the wave function of the subsystem.\n\nThere is a rather obvious answer for this, a natural function of \\(x\\)\nthat suitably incorporates the objective structure at hand, namely the\nconditional wave function \n\n\\[\\psi(x) = \\Psi(x, Y)\\]\n\n obtained by plugging\nthe actual configuration of the environment into the wave function of\nthe larger system. (This definition is appropriate only for scalar\nwave functions; for particles with spin the situation would be a\nlittle more complicated.) It then follows immediately that the\nconfiguration of the subsystem obeys\n the guiding equation\n with the conditional wave function on its right-hand side.\n\nMoreover, taking into account the way that the conditional wave\nfunction depends upon time \\(t\\) \n\n\\[\\psi_t (x) = \\Psi_t (x, Y_t)\\]\n\n via the time dependence\nof \\(Y\\) as well as that of \\(\\Psi\\), it is not difficult to see\n(D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec 1992a) the following two\nthings about the evolution of the conditional wave: First, that it\nobeys Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation for the subsystem when that\nsystem is suitably decoupled from its environment. Part of what is\nmeant by this decoupling is that \\(\\Psi\\) has a special form, what\nmight be called an effective product form (similar to but more general\nthan the superposition produced in an \u201cideal quantum\nmeasurement\u201d), in which case the conditional wave function of\nthe subsystem is also called its effective wave function.\nSecond, using the\n quantum equilibrium hypothesis,\n that it randomly collapses according to the usual quantum mechanical\nrules under precisely those conditions on the interaction between the\nsubsystem and its environment that define an ideal quantum\nmeasurement.\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that orthodox quantum theory lacks the\nresources that make it possible to define the conditional wave\nfunction, namely, the actual configuration \\(Y\\) of the environment.\nIndeed, from an orthodox point of view what should be meant by the\nwave function of a subsystem is entirely obscure.\n",
