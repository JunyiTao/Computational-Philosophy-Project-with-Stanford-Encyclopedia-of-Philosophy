    "main_text": "Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\n3. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\u2019s realistic theory of the two truths and the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory of the two truths both\naffirm the ultimate reality of physical objects constituted by atoms.\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra rejects physical realism of both the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and the Sautr\u0101ntika, although it agrees\nwith the Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s representationalist theory as far as they\nboth affirm representation as the intentional objects in perception\nand deny in perception a direct access to any external object. Where\nthey part their company is in their response to the questions: what\ncauses representations? Is the contact of senses with physical objects\nnecessary to give rise to representations in perception? The\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s reply is that external objects cause\nrepresentations, given that these representations are intentional\nobjects there is indeed a contact between senses and external objects.\nThis affirmative response allows the Sautr\u0101ntika to affirm\nreality of external objects. The Yog\u0101c\u0101rin however replies\nthat \u201csubliminal impressions\u201d (v\u0101san\u0101s) from\nfoundational consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na) are the\ncauses of the mental representations, and given that these impressions\nare only internal phenomena acting as intentional objects, the contact\nbetween senses and external objects is therefore rejected even\nconventionally. This allows the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin to deny even\nconventional reality of all physical objects, and argue that all\nconventional realities are our mental representations, mental\ncreations, cognitions etc.\n\nThe central thesis in the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy, the theory of\nthe two truths echoes is the assertion that all that is conventionally\nreal is only ideas, representations, images, creations of the mind,\nand that there is no conventionally real object that exists outside\nthe mind to which it corresponds. These ideas are only objects of any\ncognition. The whole universe is a mental universe. All physical\nobjects are only fiction, they are unreal even by the conventional\nstandard, similar to a dream, a mirage, a magical illusion, where what\nwe perceive are only products of our mind, without a real external\nexistence.\n\nInspired by the idealistic tendencies of various s\u016btras\nconsisting of important elements of the idealistic doctrines, in the\nthird and the fourth centuries many Indian philosophers developed and\nsystematised a coherent Idealist School. In the beginning of the\nVi\u1e43\u015batik\u0101 Vasubandhu treats citta,\nmanas, vij\u00f1\u0101na, vij\u00f1\u0101pti as\nsynonymous and uses these terms as the names of the idealistic school.\nThe chief founders were Maitreyan\u0101th (ca. 300) and\nAsa\u1e45ga (315\u2013390), propagated by Vasubandhu\n(320\u2013380), Dign\u0101ga (480\u2013540) Sthiramati (ca.\n500), Dharmap\u0101la (530\u2013561), Hiuan-tsang (602\u2013664),\nDharmak\u012brti (600\u2013660), \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n(ca.725\u2013788) and Kamala\u015b\u012bla (ca.740\u2013795). The\nlast two are Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-M\u0101dhyamikas in contrast with the\nearlier figures who are identified as Yog\u0101c\u0101rins.\n\nLike other Buddhist schools, the theory of the two truths captures the\ncentral Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrines. Maitreyan\u0101th asserts in his\nVerses on the Distinction Between Phenomena and Reality\n(Dharmadharmat\u0101vibha\u1e45ga-k\u0101rik\u0101,\nDDVK; Sems tsam phi 50b\u201353b)\u2014\u201cAll this is\nunderstood to be condensed in two categories: phenomena (dharma) and\nreality (dharmat\u0101) because they encompass all.\u201d\n(DDVK 2, Sems tsam phi) By \u201cAll\u201d\nYog\u0101c\u0101rin means every possible object of knowledge, and they\nare said to be contained in the two truths since objects are either\nconventional truth or ultimate truth. Things are either objects of\nconventional knowledge or objects of ultimate knowledge, and a third\ncategory is not admitted.\n",
