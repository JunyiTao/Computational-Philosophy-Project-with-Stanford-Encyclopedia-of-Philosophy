    "main_text": "Modality and the causal relation || Disputed principles\n3.4 Disputed principles\n\nAccording to Averroes, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b misreports the\nphilosophers\u2019 account of causal necessity in nature. Averroes\nalso suggests that his own revised version of their account is true.\nWhile al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b might accept the former claim, he would not\naccept the latter. This has to do with his understanding of the\nmodalities. On his account of \u201cnecessary\u201d, a connection\nbetween two things is not necessary if it is conceivable that it be\nsevered (Kukkonen 2000; Dutton 2001). So, if it is conceivable that\nthe cotton not burn, even though its contact with fire is unimpeded\nand it is dry, then it is not necessary that it burn, even when these\nconditions obtain. As we have seen, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b considers it\nconceivable that the cotton not burn, even when these conditions\nobtain. For he says that the connection between burning and contact\nwith fire\n\n\nis due to the prior decree of God, who creates them side by side, not\nto its being necessary in itself, incapable of separation.\n(al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 166)\n\n\nSo, according to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, it is conceivable that the\ncotton not burn, even though its contact with fire is unimpeded and it\nis dry, so it is not necessary that it burn, even when these\nconditions obtain. On this view, even Averroes\u2019 revised version\nof the philosophers\u2019 account of causal necessity in nature is\nmistaken. On the other hand, the philosophers do not accept\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s account of \u201cnecessary\u201d. More\ngenerally, they do not characterize the modalities in terms of\nconceivability. This suggests that the disagreement between\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and the philosophers about causal necessity in\nnature has partly to do with their differing accounts of the\nmodalities (Kukkonen 2000; Dutton 2001). However, the fundamental\nsource of their disagreement is  theological.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b attacks the philosophers\u2019 view of causal\nnecessity in nature in order to safeguard the Muslim belief in\nmiracles and divine omnipotence (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 165). These\ntenets of faith are incompatible with Avicenna\u2019s account of God.\nAs mentioned earlier (in\n \u00a73.1),\n Avicenna considers God\u2019s immutability to entail that his\nknowledge, volition and action are immutable. He also denies that\nGod knows particular things, except in a universal way (Avicenna MH:\n288; Marmura 1962; Adamson 2005). So, according to Avicenna, God\ncannot act otherwise than he does; furthermore, he cannot plan or\nexecute any particular event. So, God cannot cause a miracle by\naltering his action so as to interrupt the course of nature.\nFurthermore, God cannot cause a miracle by planning and executing a\ngrand series of particular events, which includes a deviation from the\ncourse of nature. On the contrary, God serves as the ultimate\nexplanation of order and stability in the universe, including in the\nrealm of nature. Likewise, Averroes\u2019 mature view, which describes\nGod as an ultimate final cause of motion, who is\nneither a creator, nor an efficient cause of earthly events,\nis obviously incompatible with the view that God can cause\nmiracles.\n\nOf course, Avicenna and Averroes do not always state in plain terms\nthat their accounts of God are incompatible with Muslim doctrine. They\noften take a conciliatory approach to religious tenets that are in\ntension with truths established by philosophy. This approach is\nrelated to their view that the role of religion is to transmit truth\nto the masses via narrative and metaphor, as discussed above (in\n \u00a72.2.3).\n",
