    "main_text": "The Rationality of Voting || Voting to Change the \u201cMandate\u201d\n1.2 Voting to Change the \u201cMandate\u201d\n\nOne popular response to the paradox of voting is to posit that voters\nare not trying to determine who wins, but instead trying to change the\n\u201cmandate\u201d the elected candidate receives. The assumption\nhere is that an elected official\u2019s efficacy\u2014i.e., her\nability to get things done in office\u2014depends in part on how\nlarge of a majority vote she received. If that were true, I might vote\nfor what I expect to be the winning candidate in order to increase her\nmandate, or vote against the expected winner to reduce her mandate.\nThe virtue of the mandate hypothesis, if it were true, is that it\ncould explain why it would be rational to vote even in elections where\none candidate enjoys a massive lead coming into the election.\n\nHowever, the mandate argument faces two major problems. First, even if\nwe assume that such mandates exist, to know whether voting is\nrational, we would need to know how much the nth\nvoter\u2019s vote increases the marginal effectiveness of her\npreferred candidate, or reduces the marginal effectiveness of her\ndispreferred candidate. Suppose voting for the expected winning\ncandidate costs me $15 worth of my time. It would be rational for me\nto vote only if I believed my individual vote would give the winning\ncandidate at least $15 worth of electoral efficacy (and I care about\nthe increased efficiency as much or more than my opportunity costs).\nIn principle, whether individual votes change the\n\u201cmandate\u201d this much is something that political scientists\ncould measure, and indeed, they have tried to do so. \n\nBut this brings us to the second, deeper problem: Political scientists\nhave done extensive empirical work trying to test whether electoral\nmandates exist, and they now roundly reject the mandate hypothesis\n(Dahl 1990b; Noel 2010). A winning candidate\u2019s ability to get\nthings done is generally not affected by how small or large of a\nmargin she wins by.\n\nPerhaps voting is rational not as a way of trying to change how\neffective the elected politician will be, but instead as a way of\ntrying to change the kind of mandate the winning politician enjoys\n(Guerrero 2010). Perhaps a vote could transform a candidate from a\ndelegate to a trustee. A delegate tries to do what she believes her\nconstituents want, but a trustee has the normative legitimacy to do\nwhat she believes is best.\n\nSuppose for the sake of argument that trustee representatives are\nsignificantly more valuable than delegates, and that what makes a\nrepresentative a trustee rather than a delegate is her large margin of\nvictory. Unfortunately, this does not yet show that the expected\nbenefits of voting exceed the expected costs. Suppose (as in Guerrero\n2010: 289) that the distinction between a delegate and trustee lies on\na continuum, like difference between bald and hairy. To show voting is\nrational, one would need to show that the marginal impact of an\nindividual vote, as it moves a candidate a marginal degree from\ndelegate to trustee, is higher than the opportunity cost of voting. If\nvoting costs me $15 worth of time, then, on this theory, it would be\nrational to vote only if my vote is expected to move my favorite\ncandidate from delegate to trustee by an increment worth at least $15\n(Guerrero 2010: 295\u2013297).\n\nAlternatively, suppose that there were a determinate threshold (either\nknown or unknown) of votes at which a winning candidate is suddenly\ntransformed from being a delegate to a trustee. By casting a vote, the\nvoter has some chance of decisively pushing her favored candidate over\nthis threshold. However, just as the probability that her vote will\ndecide the election is vanishingly small, so the probability that her\nvote will decisively transform a representative from a delegate into a\ntrustee would be vanishingly small. Indeed, the formula for\ndetermining decisiveness in transforming a candidate into a trustee\nwould be roughly the same as determining whether the voter would break\na tie. Thus, suppose it\u2019s a billion or even a trillion dollars\nbetter for a representative to be a trustee rather than a candidate.\nEven if so, the expected benefit of an individual vote is still less\nthan a penny, which is lower than the opportunity cost of voting.\nAgain, it\u2019s wonderful to win the lottery, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s rational to buy a ticket.\n",
