    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || The Narrative View\n2.3 The Narrative View \n\n\nThus far we have been assuming that the criterion of identity relevant\nto our practical concerns will answer to what Schechtman 1996 calls\na  reidentification question: What are the conditions under\nwhich a person at one point in time is properly reidentified at\nanother point in time? Answering this question calls for a criterion\nof diachronic numerical identity, a criterion of what makes\nsomething one and the same thing as itself at different times. But\naccording to Schechtman, what is actually more appropriate for the\nrelation between identity and ethics is an answer to the \ncharacterization question: What are the conditions under which\nvarious psychological characteristics, experiences, and actions\nare properly attributable to some person?\n\n\nOne reason to turn to this question may stem from recognizing the \ndifficulties various theories of numerical identity run into, both \nmetaphysically and in terms of fitting with our practical concerns \n(Schechtman 1996, 26\u201370). But another may be the natural fit between \nthe characterization question and our practical concerns. So in \nsearching for an account of the rationality of anticipation, we seem \nto be asking, \u201cWhat makes those expected experiences \nmine?\u201d Or in searching for an account of the special concern we\nhave only for ourselves, we seem to be asking, \u201cWhat makes \nthose future states I'm specially concerned about \nmine?\u201d And the same seems true of responsibility and \ncompensation: \u201cWhat makes those actions for which I'm \nresponsible, or those burdens for which I'm to be compensated, \nmine?\u201d And in each case, what makes some feature mine\nmay be a non-numerical type of identity, the type of identity we are\nthinking of when addressing the familiar question of an identity\ncrisis: \u201cWho am I really?\u201d This is the question of\nidentity as proper attributability, an account of the nature of one's\ndeep or true self and the various attributes genuinely belonging to\nit. (For early and influential discussion of proper attributability\nand identification, see various essays in Frankfurt 1988; for\ndiscussion of different theories of the deep/true self over the years,\nsee Shoemaker 2015).\n\n\nSo what is the right account of this sort of identity? According to \ntheorists attracted to this general approach, it is the  \nNarrative Criterion of Personal Identity: What makes an action, \nexperience, or psychological characteristic properly attributable to \nsome person (and thus a proper part of his or her true self) is \nits correct incorporation into the self-told story of his or her life\n(MacIntyre 1984, 1989, Taylor 1989, Schechtman 1996, DeGrazia 2005). \nNarrative identity is thus really about a kind of psychological \nunity, but not just an artless or random unity. Imagine, for \ninstance, a subject of experiences to whom various experiences merely\nhappened over time. The events would be unified in a purely passive \nrespect, simply as the experiences contained within the life of that \nsubject of experiences. But for that subject to be a person,\na genuine moral agent, those experiences must be actively unified, \nmust be gathered together into the life of one narrative ego by \nvirtue of a story the subject tells that  weaves them \ntogether, giving them a kind of coherence and intelligibility they \nwouldn't otherwise have had. This is how the various experiences and \nevents come to have any real meaning at all \u2013 rather than being\nmerely isolated events \u2013 by being part of a larger story that \nrelates them to one another within the context of one life \n(Schechtman 1996, 96\u201399).\n\n\nThis view purports to account for our practical concerns in a far more\nadequate way than the previous accounts of numerical identity.  So it\nmakes sense for me to rationally anticipate some future experiences\nonly if they will be mine, where what makes them mine is that they\nwill fit coherently and accurately into my own ongoing self-told\nstory. What explains my special sort of concern for myself is that I'm\nin fact an extended narrative ego \u2013 not some present time-slice\nconcerned about the well-being of some different future time-slice\n\u2013 and I'm constantly extending that narrative into the future,\nso my concern is global, a concern for the whole self I'm\ncreating via this story, the whole self whose various parts are\nmine. And as for responsibility, the Narrative Criterion \nimplies that what makes some past action mine (for which I'm eligible\nfor praise or blame) is that it flowed from my central values, \nbeliefs, and experiences, that there's a coherent story I may tell \nuniting it to the other elements of my life. And a similar story may \nbe told to account for compensation (Schechtman 1996, 136\u2013162).\n\n\nThere are, nevertheless, problems with the account. For one thing, it\nis not entirely clear why a self-told narrative is necessary to unite\nthe various experiences and events of one's life into a coherent\nwhole. I may have robust psychological unity without having told\nmyself any kind of story. But even if we allow for hypothetical\nnarratives to do this work, it remains unclear just what role a\nnarrative actually plays in our practical concerns. After all, some\nnarratives get it wrong \u2013 it can't just be that whatever I say\nabout the way the events of my life fit together is what goes \u2013\nand if we correct for that, then it seems we must admit that it isn't\nthe narrative itself that makes the various events and\nexperiences united with one another; rather, they must be united with\none another independently, and the (correct) narrative just serves as\na kind of post hoc overlay, an aesthetic articulation of the\npre-existing metaphysical unity.\n\n\nBut perhaps the most serious worry comes from the fact that, as it\nstands, narrative identity depends on numerical identity (as DeGrazia\n2005, 114, admits). What matters to us with respect to all of our\npractical concerns is that we ourselves continue to exist: it's a\nnecessary presupposition of my rational anticipation, self-concern,\npossibilities for compensation, and so on that I myself persist, but\nthis is an issue of numerical identity. Another way to put this point\nis that one can't be a person, on the narrative view, unless one\ngathers up the various experiences one has as a subject of experiences\ninto a coherent narrative, but then the identity of that subject of\nexperiences must be preserved across time for its experiences to be so\ngathered up. If narrative identity presupposes numerical identity,\nthough, then we still need a plausible account of numerical identity\nfirst, one that can ground an answer to the characterization question\nthe narrative view was built to address.  But given the problems of\nboth the Psychological and Biological views, is there a way to do so?\nA recent addition to the literature is promising.\n",
