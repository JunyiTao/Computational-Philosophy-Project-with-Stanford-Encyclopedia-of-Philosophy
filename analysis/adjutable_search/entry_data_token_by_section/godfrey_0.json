    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\n\nGodfrey of Fontaines was born in present day Belgium in the\nprincipality of Li\u00e8ge, very likely at the chateau of the noble\nfamily of which he was a member, at Fontaines-les Hoz\u00e9mont,\nprobably shortly before 1250. This approximate date can be inferred\nfrom the fact that he conducted his first quodlibetal dispute as a\nMaster of Theology at Paris in 1285, and that one could not become a\nMaster in this faculty before reaching the age of 35. While nothing is\nknown with certainty about his life prior to his arrival at Paris, he\nmust have pursued philosophical studies there in the Faculty of Arts in\nthe early 1270s. University statutes required one to spend at least\neight years in studying theology before becoming a Master, and it is\nalso known that he was inscribed at the Sorbonne before August 15,\n1274. Hence his theological studies should have begun by that date (De\nWulf, 1904, 3\u201316; Wippel, 1981, xv\u2013xviii).\n\n\nGodfrey was evidently a great lover of books, and among the surviving\n37 manuscripts he left to the Sorbonne is a valuable \u201cStudent\nNotebook\u201d (Paris: Bibl. Nat. lat. 16.297) which he himself compiled\nduring his student days at Paris, and into which he entered many\nwritings in his own hand.  While it was not completed by 1274 or\nearlier as was previously proposed, the most recent research indicates\nthat it was formed by Godfrey almost entirely between the end of 1276\nand 1278, with the exception of the final small portion copied at the\nearliest between 1278\u20131280 and at the latest between 1280\u20131281\n(Aiello-Wielockx, 2008, 167). It reflects his interests in the 1270s\nduring his time as a theology student at Paris and includes works by\nThomas Aquinas, Siger of Brabant, Boethius of Dacia, other anonymous\nQuestions on various works of Aristotle which are clearly by some\nMaster(s) of Arts of the time, still others by Giles of Rome, some\nextracts from Albert the Great and from Henry of Ghent, as well as\nother purely theological writings (Duin, 1959; Wippel, 2001, 360\u201367;\nand now an exhaustive study by Aiello-Wielockx, 2008). An anonymous\nset of Questions on Bks. I\u2013II of Aristotle\u2019s De anima\ncontained in this same Student Notebook has recently been assigned to\nBoethius of Dacia and edited (Wielockx, 2009). Godfrey\u2019s interest in\nthe writings of Radical Aristotelian Arts Masters at Paris in the\n1260s and 1270s is also indicated by other works of Arts Masters\nincluded in additional manuscripts in his library\n(Bibl. Nat. lat. 15.819, 16.096). Also noteworthy is the inclusion in\nhis Student Notebook of one of the oldest and most reliable copies of\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s controversial De aeternitate mundi, which\nitself dates probably from 1271. And Godfrey\u2019s interest in and reaction to the thought of important contemporary members of the Theology Faculty at Paris such as Henry of Ghent and Giles of Rome and others is evident from the contents of various manuscripts containing writings by them in his personal library (Wielockx, 2014). \n\n Godfrey continued to teach as a Master of Theology at the\nUniversity until ca. 1303/1304 when he conducted his fifteenth and\nlast Quodlibetal Disputation, and he was in Paris for a meeting at the\nSorbonne in February 1304. He may have been away from Paris for some\nmore extended periods after completing Quodlibet XIV\nca. 1298\u20131299. It is known that he maintained close connections\nwith Li\u00e8ge during his career at Paris and, indeed, that he\nserved as Canon of Li\u00e8ge.  He also served as Provost of San\nSeverin at Cologne, and as Canon of Tournai although some doubt has\nbeen raised about the last mentioned point (Field, 2009, 138,\nn. 11). It has also been reported that he was elected Bishop of\nTournai in 1300 but renounced his rights to the See when the election\nwas contested. While some question about the accuracy of this has also\nbeen raised (Field, ibid.), it is certain that he was involved in\nnegotiating a settlement for the disputed election and that this\nrequired him to travel to Rome to present the case to the Roman\nCuria. The year of his death is not known with certainty but has been\nproposed as probably 1306 (or 1309 which seems to be too late), even\nthough the day is known, i.e., October 29 according to the necrology\nof the Sorbonne.\n\n\nGodfrey selected the quodlibetal disputation as his major vehicle for\npublication. These solemn disputations were conducted twice during the\nacademic year, i.e., before Christmas and before Easter. They were\nopen to all members of the learned public and questions could be put\nto the presiding Master by anyone in attendance. During the first\nday\u2019s disputation, preliminary answers would be given to these many\nand disparate questions. On the following day or at least on some\nfollowing day, the Master, having in the meantime imposed some logical\norganizing plan upon the various questions, would return for another\nsession where he would present his definitive response or\n\u201cdetermination\u201d for each of them. Subsequently he would prepare this\nversion for publication and, when it was completed, would submit it to\nthe University Bookseller.  Masters were not required to conduct these\nopen disputations and since they were regarded as onerous, not all\ndid. Godfrey\u2019s 15 Quodlibets have all been edited, although only\nreportationes of the first four remain, i.e., copies taken\ndown by an auditor. Brief versions (abbreviationes) of\nQuodlibets III and IV have also been edited. Since medieval times\nthere has been some difficulty about the literary form of Quodlibet\nXIV concerning whether it really is a Quodlibet or some other kind of\ndisputed question. Wippel (2006) concludes it is more probable that it\nis indeed a Quodlibet, but one that is unique in terms of its\norganizing plan and structure. As a Master of theology Godfrey also\nconducted ordinary Disputed Questions, and some of these have been\npreserved.\n",
