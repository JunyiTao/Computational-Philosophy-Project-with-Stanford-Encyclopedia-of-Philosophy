    "main_text": "\n\nSince antiquity, natural philosophers have struggled to comprehend the\nnature of three tightly interconnected concepts: space, time, and\nmotion. A proper understanding of motion, in particular, has been seen\nto be crucial for deciding questions about the natures of space and\ntime, and their interconnections. Since the time of Newton and\nLeibniz, philosophers\u2019 struggles to comprehend these concepts\nhave often appeared to take the form of a dispute between\nabsolute conceptions of space, time and motion, and\nrelational conceptions. This article guides the reader\nthrough some of the history of these philosophical struggles. Rather\nthan taking sides in the (alleged) ongoing debates, or reproducing the\nstandard dialectic recounted in most introductory texts, we have\nchosen to scrutinize carefully the history of the thinking of the\ncanonical participants in these debates \u2013 principally Descartes,\nNewton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. Readers interested in following up\neither the historical questions or current debates about the natures\nof space, time and motion will find ample links and references\nscattered through the discussion and in the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below.\n",
