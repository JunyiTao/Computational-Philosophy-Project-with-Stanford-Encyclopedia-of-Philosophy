    "main_text": "Description and Characteristics || The Main Fields in which Sophismata are Discussed\n2.3 The Main Fields in which Sophismata are Discussed\n\nDiscussions of sophismata were used to disentangle problems\nof logic and grammar, but their subject matter included concepts\nfeatured in physics and theology as well. While the problems at issue\nin the sophismata are taken to be logico-grammatical, it is\npossible to distinguish between logical, grammatical and physical\nsophismata. Furthermore, many standard sophismata of\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries feature God or the Antichrist,\nentities that belong to the domain of theology. As Ebbesen points out\n(1997, p. 151), these entities could play an interesting role in\nsophismatic discussions because they were considered to have unusual\nqualities, which could make for intriguing logical puzzles. Yet\ntheological sophismata as such are extremely rare.\n2.3.1 Logical Sophismata\n\nAs seen above, logical sophismata are closely connected to\ndiscussions of syncategoremata. The aim of these discussions is to\ndetermine the truth-value of a particular sentence containing (a)\nsyncategorematic word(s), or the truth-value of some other problematic\nsentence (including, for example, sentences involving self-reference),\nbut also to delve into specific topics exemplified in a\nsophisma, such as:\n\nthe syntactic and semantic properties of terms (including the\ndifference between what a term signifies, and what it stands for) in\nsentences such as \u2018Every man sees every man\u2019, \u2018You\nare a donkey\u2019, and \u2018I promise you a horse\u2019; we could\ncompare these kinds of discussions to modern discussions of sentences\nsuch as \u2018The morning star is the evening star\u2019;\nquantification and existential import, as in the sentence\n\u2018Every phoenix is\u2019;\nthe logic of negation and \u201cinfinite\u201d words, as in the\nsentences, \u2018Nothing and a chimaera are brothers\u2019,\n\u2018Nothing is nothing\u2019, and \u2018If nothing is, something\nis\u2019;\nthe problem of universals, as in \u2018Man is a species\u2019\nand \u2018Man is of necessity an animal\u2019;\nthe composite and divided senses of a sentence and the scope of\nmodal operators, as in \u2018The white can be black\u2019 and\n\u2018Every man is of necessity an animal\u2019, etc.;\nthe truth conditions of a dictum, as in \u2018You know\nwhether of the one who is lying it is false that Socrates is\nhe\u2019;\nscope distinctions in negations, as in \u2018No one running you\nare a donkey\u2019;\nscope distinctions in a conditional containing a distributive sign\n(quantifier), as in \u2018Nothing true if Socrates is running is\nantecedent to Plato running\u2019;\nthe truth value of conditional sentences containing an impossible\nantecedent, such as \u2018If you know you are a stone, you do not\nknow you are a stone\u2019;\nthe nature of necessity and possibility, as in sentences such as\n\u2018The soul of the Antichrist of necessity will be\u2019,\n\u2018Every grammarian is of necessity a man\u2019, and \u2018It is\npossible that every man is an animal\u2019, etc.\n\n2.3.2 Physical Sophismata\n\nThe aim here is to discuss concepts featuring in physics, such as\nmotion, change, velocity, intension and remission of forms, maxima and\nminima, time, etc. Examples of sophismata in this domain are\nsentences containing the syncategoremata \u2018begins\u2019 and\n\u2018ceases\u2019, e.g., \u2018Socrates ceases to be not ceasing\nto be\u2019, \u2018Nothing is true except in this instant\u2019,\nand \u2018What begins to be ceases to be\u2019. But, as seen above\nwith the sophisma \u2018The infinite are finite\u2019,\nproblems like these are treated as logical and conceptual problems.\nThis logico-semantical approach to physical problems is characteristic\nof medieval natural philosophy and should be kept in mind when we\nwonder to what extent medieval physics can be considered a precursor\nto modern physics.\n\nWith respect to so-called \u2018physical sophismata,\u2019\nspecial attention should be paid to certain fourteenth-century English\nauthors known as the \u201cOxford Calculators\u201d, e.g., Richard\nKilvington, William Heytesbury, Thomas Bradwardine, Richard and Roger\nSwineshead. These philosophers developed a distinctively\n\u201cEnglish-style\u201d of sophismata. Based on the\ntheological doctrine of the absolute power of God, the distinction\nbetween what is physically possible and what is logically possible\n(where non-contradiction is the only limit) allowed these authors to\ndevise imaginary thought experiments. For example, suppose that\nA is a distance to be traversed which Socrates cannot traverse,\nand that his power is increased until Socrates can traverse distance\nA completely, and that Socrates\u2019 power is not increased\nfurther: is the sophisma \u2018Socrates will begin to be\nable to traverse distance A\u2019 true or false? (Richard\nKilvington, Sophismata, sophisma 27, in Kretzmann\n1990, p .60). Thought experiments such as these led these authors to\ndevelop, among other things, a theorem for uniformly accelerated\nmotion (e.g., Thomas Bradwardine\u2019s Mean Speed Theorem).\n2.3.3 Grammatical Sophismata\n\nIn the Middle Ages the label \u2018grammatical\nsophismata\u2019 was used for the sophismata that\ndealt with grammatical well-formedness (congruitas) and\ngrammatico-semantic completeness. Sophismata such as\n\u2018Love is a verb\u2019, \u2018O Master\u2019, \u2018It rueth\nme\u2019, and \u2018I run\u2019 gave rise to very pointed\ndiscussions concerning grammatical categories and theories. For\nexample, does a change in word order change the meaning of a\nproposition? Can a participle be a subject? How should we interpret\ninterjections? Can \u2018est\u2019 (\u2018is\u2019) be\nused impersonally?\n\nKneepkens (2015) has drawn our attention to a remarkable collection of\nsophismata, of French or English origin, presumably dating\nfrom early thirteenth century, which exclusively discusses problematic\nsentences taken from biblical, liturgical, and other religious\nsources. This collection has the characteristics of grammatical\nsophismata, but in addition focuses on metaphorical features\nof religious language, as well as making use of rhetoric as an\nanalytical tool (Kneepkens 2015, p. 320).\n2.3.4 Theological Sophismata\n\nEbbesen has identified one sophisma that deserves the label\n\u2018theological\u2019 (in the sense, that is, of an\n\u201cexception to the general rule that the sophism is not\na theological genre\u201d (Ebbesen 1997, pp. 151\u2013152). The\nsophisma in question runs \u2018Deus est eodem modo in\ndyabolo sicud fuit in beata virgine\u2019(\u2018God is in the\nsame way in the devil as he was in the Blessed Virgin\u2019). The\nreason why this could count as a theological sophisma is that\nthe question that is raised in it, about how God is present in\ncreatures, is theological in nature. Another theological\nsophisma investigated by Ebbesen is the sentence,\n\u2018Deus scit quicquid scivit\u2019 (\u2018God knows\nwhatever he has known\u2019), which was widely discussed in the\nstandard sophismata literature. The sentence elicits\nquestions pertaining not only to the logical behaviour of the verb\n\u2018scire\u2019 (\u2018to know\u2019), but also to the\nspecifically theological issue of the object of God\u2019s knowledge\n(Ebbesen 1997, p. 154ff.).\n",
