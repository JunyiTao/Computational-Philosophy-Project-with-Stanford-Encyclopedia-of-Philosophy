A First Look: Duhem, Quine, and the Problems of Underdetermination\n\nThe scope of the epistemic challenge arising from underdetermination\nis not limited only to scientific contexts, as is perhaps most readily\nseen in classical skeptical attacks on our knowledge more generally.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes ([1640] 1996) famously sought to doubt any and\nall of his beliefs which could possibly be doubted by supposing that\nthere might be an all-powerful Evil Demon who sought to deceive him.\nDescartes\u2019 challenge appeals to a form of underdetermination: he\nnotes that all our sensory experiences would be just the same if they\nwere caused by this Evil Demon rather than an external world of rocks\nand trees. Likewise, Nelson Goodman\u2019s (1955) \u201cNew Riddle\nof Induction\u201d turns on the idea that the evidence we now have\ncould equally well be taken to support inductive generalizations quite\ndifferent from those we usually take them to support, with radically\ndifferent consequences for the course of future\n events.[1]\n Nonetheless, underdetermination has been thought to arise in\nscientific contexts in a variety of distinctive and important ways\nthat do not simply recreate such radically skeptical\npossibilities.\n\nThe traditional locus classicus for underdetermination in science is\nthe work of Pierre Duhem, a French physicist as well as historian and\nphilosopher of science who lived at the turn of the 20th\nCentury. In The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory, Duhem\nformulated various problems of scientific underdetermination in an\nespecially perspicuous and compelling way, although he himself argued\nthat these problems posed serious challenges only to our efforts to\nconfirm theories in physics. In the middle of the 20th\nCentury, W. V. O. Quine suggested that such challenges applied not\nonly to the confirmation of all types of scientific theories, but to\nall knowledge claims whatsoever. His incorporation and further\ndevelopment of these problems as part of a general account of human\nknowledge was one of the most significant developments of\n20th Century epistemology. But neither Duhem nor Quine was\ncareful to systematically distinguish a number of fundamentally\ndistinct lines of thinking about underdetermination found in their\nwork. Perhaps the most important division is between what we might\ncall holist and contrastive forms of underdetermination. Holist\nunderdetermination (Section 2 below) arises whenever our inability to\ntest hypotheses in isolation leaves us underdetermined in our\nresponse to a failed prediction or some other piece of\ndisconfirming evidence. That is, because hypotheses have empirical\nimplications or consequences only when conjoined with other\nhypotheses and/or background beliefs about the world, a failed\nprediction or falsified empirical consequence typically leaves open to\nus the possibility of blaming and abandoning one of these background\nbeliefs and/or \u2018auxiliary\u2019 hypotheses rather than the\nhypothesis we set out to test in the first place. But contrastive\nunderdetermination (Section 3 below) involves the quite different\npossibility that for any body of evidence confirming a theory, there\nmight well be other theories that are also well confirmed by\nthat very same body of evidence. Moreover, claims of\nunderdetermination of either of these two fundamental varieties can\nvary in strength and character in any number of ways: one might, for\nexample, suggest that the choice between two theories or two ways of\nrevising our beliefs is transiently underdetermined simply by\nthe evidence we happen to have at present, or instead\npermanently underdetermined by all possible\nevidence. Indeed, the variety of forms of underdetermination that\nconfront scientific inquiry, and the causes and consequences claimed\nfor these different varieties, are sufficiently heterogeneous that\nattempts to address \u201cthe\u201d problem of underdetermination\nfor scientific theories have often engendered considerable confusion\nand argumentation at\n cross-purposes.[2]\n\nMoreover, such differences in the character and strength of various\nclaims of underdetermination turn out to be crucial for resolving the\nsignificance of the issue. For example, in some recently influential\ndiscussions of science it has become commonplace for scholars in a\nwide variety of academic disciplines to make casual appeal to claims\nof underdetermination (especially of the holist variety) to support\nthe idea that something besides evidence must step in to do\nthe further work of determining beliefs and/or changes of belief in\nscientific contexts. Perhaps most prominent among these are adherents\nof the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) movement and some\nfeminist science critics who have argued that it is typically the\nsociopolitical interests and/or pursuit of power and influence by\nscientists themselves which play a crucial and even decisive role in\ndetermining which beliefs are actually abandoned or retained in\nresponse to conflicting evidence. As we will see in Section 2.2,\nhowever, Larry Laudan has argued that such claims depend upon simple\nequivocation between comparatively weak or trivial forms of\nunderdetermination and the far stronger varieties from which they draw\nradical conclusions about the limited reach of evidence and\nrationality in science. In the sections that follow we will seek to\nclearly characterize and distinguish the various forms of both holist\nand contrastive underdetermination that have been suggested to arise\nin scientific contexts (noting some important connections between them\nalong the way), assess the strength and significance of the\nheterogeneous argumentative considerations offered in support of and\nagainst them, and consider just which forms of underdetermination pose\ngenuinely consequential challenges for scientific inquiry.\n",
