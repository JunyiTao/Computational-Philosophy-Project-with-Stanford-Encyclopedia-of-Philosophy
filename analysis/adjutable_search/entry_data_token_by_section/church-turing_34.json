    "main_text": "Some Key Remarks by Turing and Church || Turing machines\n7.1 Turing machines\n\nTuring prefaced his first description of a Turing machine with the\nwords:\n\n\nWe may compare a man in the process of computing a \u2026 number to\na machine. (Turing 1936 [2004: 59])\n\n\nThe Turing machine is a model, idealized in certain respects, of a\nhuman being calculating in accordance with an effective\nmethod.\n\nWittgenstein put this point in a striking way:\n\n\nTuring\u2019s \u201cMachines\u201d. These machines are\nhumans who calculate. (Wittgenstein 1947 [1980: 1096])\n\n\nIt is a point that Turing was to emphasize, in various forms, again\nand again. For example:\n\n\nA man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict\ndiscipline, is in effect a universal machine. (Turing 1948 [2004:\n416])\n\n\nIn order to understand Turing\u2019s \u201cOn Computable\nNumbers\u201d and later texts, it is essential to keep in mind that\nwhen he used the words \u201ccomputer\u201d,\n\u201ccomputable\u201d and \u201ccomputation\u201d, he employed\nthem not in their modern sense as pertaining to machines, but as\npertaining to human calculators. For example:\n\n\nComputers always spend just as long in writing numbers down and\ndeciding what to do next as they do in actual multiplications, and it\nis just the same with ACE [the Automatic Computing Engine] \u2026\n[T]he ACE will do the work of about 10,000 computers \u2026\nComputers will still be employed on small calculations \u2026\n(Turing 1947 [2004: 387, 391])\n\n\nTuring\u2019s ACE, an early electronic stored-program digital\ncomputer, was built at the National Physical Laboratory, London; a\npilot version\u2014at the time the fastest functioning computer in\nthe world\u2014first ran in 1950, and a commercial model, the DEUCE,\nwas marketed very successfully by English Electric.\n",
