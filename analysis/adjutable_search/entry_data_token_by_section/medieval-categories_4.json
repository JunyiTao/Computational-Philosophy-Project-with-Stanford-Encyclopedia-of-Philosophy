    "main_text": "Thirteenth Century || Robert Kilwardby (b. 1215, d. 1279)\n4.1 Robert Kilwardby (b. 1215, d. 1279)\n\n\nRobert is responsible for one of the first Latin commentaries on\nAristotle's Categories since Boethius' Commentary over six centuries\nearlier, even though his conception of logic is highly influenced by\nBoethius.  He developed a doctrine of a twofold consideration of\ncategories: categories are considered in one way in logic and they are\nconsidered in another way in metaphysics.  This twofold consideration\nbecomes important for subsequent philosophers, such as Aquinas and\nScotus, who maintain that in logic, categories have one set of\nproperties, whereas in metaphysics, they have another set of\nproperties.  \n\n\nKilwardby is also responsible for propagating, if not developing, the\ndistinction between material and formal logic, where the former treats\nof propositions and its parts (namely the categories), while the\nlatter treats the deductive structure of argumentation. (see Lewry,\n1978, and Pini, 2002).\n",
