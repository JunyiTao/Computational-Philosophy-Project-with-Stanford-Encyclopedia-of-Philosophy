    "main_text": "Ecosystem Ecology\n4. Ecosystem Ecology\n\n\nThe term \u201cecosystem\u201d was coined in 1935 by Tansley who\ndefined it as \u201cthe whole system (in the sense of\nphysics) including not only the organism-complex [that is, the\ncommunity], but also the whole complex of physical factors forming\nwhat we call the environment of the biome\u2014the habitat factors in\nthe widest\n sense.\u201d[75]\n Tansley went on to argue that ecosystems \u201care the basic units\nof nature on the face of the earth.\u201d For Tansley, using the term\n\u201cecosystem\u201d implied a physical description of a community\nin its habitat. Even though that perspective still illuminates\necosystem studies (see below), it is no longer a necessary or even\ncommon connotation of the term \u201cecosystem.\u201d However,\nindependent of the use of \u201cecosystem,\u201d ecosystem ecology,\nin contrast to other ecological sub-disciplines, and in continuity\nwith its history, does retain an emphasis on physical processes.\nShould ecosystem ecology, then, be regarded as an instance of the\nunification of the physical and biological sciences? There has been so\nlittle philosophical attention to ecology that this question does not\nappear ever to have been broached.\n\n\nThe introduction and rapidly growing popularity of the term\n\u201cecosystem,\u201d especially during the late 1950s and 1960s,\nwas marked by two major cognitive and one sociological shift in the\npractice of ecology: (a) coming at the end of the so-called golden age\nof theoretical population ecology of the late 1920s and 1930s (see\n Section 2),\n turning to ecosystems helped shift emphasis from\npopulations with interacting individuals to much larger and more\ninclusive systems. In this sense it was a deliberate\nanti-\u201creductionist\u201d\n move.[76]\n Ecosystem enthusiasts follow a long holistic tradition in natural\nhistory that tends to deify complexity and deny the possibility of\nexplaining wholes in terms of their\n parts.[77]\n \u201cSystems thinking\u201d was supposed to replace\nreductionism, the decomposition of wholes into parts for the sake of\nanalysis (see\n Section 5);\n (b) a second cognitive shift is that ecosystem studies\ninvolve models based at least partly on\nnon-biological\n variables.[78]\n For instance, instead of tracking individuals or even species in\ncommunities, models may track energy or matter flow in food webs as a\nwhole; and (c) at the sociological level, the expansion of ecosystem\nstudies led to what one historian has called the invention of\n\u201cbig biology\u201d in the 1960s, chiefly in the\n US.[79]\n These studies, for instance the massive Hubbard Brook\nEcosystem\n Study,[80]\n required more than just many biologists working together.  They also\ndemanded that other specialists, including geochemists and soil\nscientists, be brought in so that all the relevant physical parameters\nof ecosystems, besides the biological ones, could be tracked\nsimultaneously. This study constituted the biologists' attempt to\nengage in publicly-funded Big Science, initiated by the physicists\nduring the Manhattan Project, and subsequently profitably exploited by\nsocial scientists since the 1950s.\n\n\nUntil the last decade, some seventy years after the introduction of\nthe term \u201cecosystem\u201d and forty years after a veritable\nexplosion of ecosystem studies, it was less than clear what important\nnew insights this disciplinary move produced. The trouble was that, at\nthis level of analysis, very few general claims could be sustained.\nThose that could\u2014for instance, that Sun is ultimately the source\nof all energy in biological systems or that primary producers have to\ncontain chlorophyll or some other such molecule\u2014were usually\ntrivial and well-known long before the initiation of systematic\nlarge-scale ecosystem studies in the 1960s. Usually ecosystem studies\nproduced detailed analyses of nutritional or climatic requirements of\nparticular communities. But the details of nutritional requirements\nwere either so general as to be almost irrelevant, or so specific that\nthey were rarely transportable from one ecosystem to another. Almost\nall of what is known about climatic requirements of vegetation types\n(and other communities) was known to biogeographers long before the\ninvention of ecosystem studies. The carbon and nitrogen cycles had\nalso been worked out long before the advent of ecosystem studies as an\norganized discipline.\n\n\nHowever, the physical characteristics of habitats do matter to\norganisms living in them. Moreover, physical changes on a global\nscale, for instance, climate change through global warming, have\nserious long-term implications for\n biota.[81]\n The changes other than climate change include increasing\nconcentration of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere and changes in the\nbiogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle, besides changes in land\ncover and land\n use.[82]\n During the last decade, ecosystem studies and models have finally\nmatured to produce novel intellectual insights even about previously\nwell-characterized ecosystem processes such as the carbon and nitrogen\n cycles.[83]\n For instance, the effects of disturbance and fire on ecosystem\nprocesses are now being seriously\n assessed.[84]\n\n\nIn one interesting analysis\u2014one among many\u2014Ryan has used a\ncomplex model tying physiological processes to the physical\nenvironment to suggest that increased temperature will make\nmaintenance respiration (which represents the physiological costs of\nprotein synthesis and replacement, membrane repair, and the\nmaintenance of ion gradients in cells) for plants more\n difficult.[85]\n This is important because the total plant respiration, including\nmaintenance respiration, is an important component of the carbon\nbalance in any ecosystem. Ryan's model is based on observed\nstatistical associations of the different parameters; the underlying\nmechanisms resulting in the high sensitivity of maintenance\nrespiration to temperature change (as well as changes in many other\nphysical parameters such as carbon dioxide and protein concentrations)\nremain unknown. Ryan's result is important because of the ongoing\nclimate change through global warming.\n\n\nIn another example, Aerts and Chapin provide a systematic review of\nnutritional ecology of wild plants including nutrient-limited growth,\nnutrient acquisition, use efficiency, and recycling through\n decomposition.[86]\n This review underscores the conclusion that plant growth in\nterrestrial ecosystems is not only very often controlled by nitrogen\navailability in the nutrients but that it is also often similarly\ndependent on phosphorus availability.\n\n\nWhat has made much of the new work possible is not only increased\nexperience with ecosystems but also significant technical innovation,\nincluding the advent of high-speed microcomputers, satellite imagery,\nand Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which will be discussed next\n(in\n Section 5).\n The future of ecosystem ecology appears much more\nsecure today than it did a decade ago.\n",
