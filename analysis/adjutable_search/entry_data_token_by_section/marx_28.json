Marx\u2019s Legacy\n\nAt this point, we might be expected briefly to survey Marx\u2019s\nlegacy.\n\nThat legacy is often elaborated in terms of movements and thinkers.\nHowever, so understood, the controversy and scale of that legacy make\nbrevity impossible, and this entry is already long enough. All we can\ndo here is gesture at the history and mention some further\nreading.\n\nThe chronology here might provisionally be divided into three\nhistorical periods: from Marx\u2019s death until the Russia\nRevolution (1917); from the Russian Revolution to the fall of the\nBerlin Wall (1989); and since 1989. It seems hard to say much that is\ncertain about the last of these periods, but some generalisations\nabout the first two might be hazarded.\n\nThat first period of \u201cClassical Marxism\u201d can be thought of\nin two generational waves. The first smaller group of theorists was\nassociated with the Second International, and includes Karl Kautsky\n(1854\u20131938) and Plekhanov. The succeeding more activist\ngeneration includes Rosa Luxemburg (1871\u20131919), V.I. Lenin\n(1870\u20131924) and Leon Trotsky (1879\u20131940).\n\nThe second period is perhaps dominated by \u201cSoviet Marxism\u201d\nand the critical reaction from other Marxists that it provoked. The\nrepressive bureaucratic regimes which solidified in the Soviet Union\nand Eastern Europe repressed independent theoretical work, including\nscholarly editorial work on the writings of Marx and Engels. However,\nthey also provoked a critical reaction in the form of a body of\nthought often called \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d, usually said to\ninclude the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891\u20131937), Theodor Adorno\n(1903\u20131969), and Althusser. The later parts of this period saw\nthe continuing development of \u201cCritical Theory\u201d, as well\nas the birth of currents such as \u201cAnalytical Marxism\u201d\nwhose longer term impact is uncertain.\n\nThese first two periods are both partly covered by the Polish\nphilosopher and historian of ideas, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, in the\nfinal two volumes of his encyclopaedic three volume Main Currents\nof Marxism (1976 [1978]). A succinct critical account of the\nemergence and distinctive character of Western Marxism is provided by\nPerry Anderson in his Considerations on Western Marxism\n(1976). And some of the more philosophically interesting authors in\nthis latter tradition are also covered elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia\n(see the\n Related Entries\n section below). Finally, and edging a little into the third of these\nhistorical periods, Christoph Henning offers an account of the (mis)\nreadings of Marx\u2014especially those replacing social theory with\nmoral philosophy\u2014in German philosophy from Heidegger to Habermas\nand beyond, in his Philosophy After Marx (2014).\n\nHowever, we might also think of Marx\u2019s legacy, less in terms of\nthinkers and movements, and more in terms of reasons for wanting to\nstudy Marx\u2019s ideas. In that context, we would stress that this\nis not simply a question of the truth of his various substantive\nclaims. The work of philosophers is, of course, also valued for the\noriginality, insight, potential, and so on, that it may also contain.\nAnd, so judged, Marx\u2019s writings have much to offer.\n\nThe various strands of Marx\u2019s thought surveyed here include his\nphilosophical anthropology, his theory of history, his critical\nengagement with the economic and political dimensions of capitalism,\nand a frustratingly vague outline of what might replace it. Whatever\nthe connections between these threads, it seems implausible to suggest\nthat Marx\u2019s ideas form a system which has to be swallowed or\nrejected in its entirety. It might, for instance, be that Marx\u2019s\ndiagnosis looks more persuasive than his remedies. Readers may have\nlittle confidence in his solutions, but that does not mean that the\nproblems he identifies are not acute.\n",
