    "main_text": "Utilitarianism and Justice\n4. Utilitarianism and Justice\n\nCan justice be understood in utilitarian terms? This may in the first\nplace depend on how we interpret utilitarianism. We treat it here as a\nnormative theory whose aim is to supply a criterion \u2013 the\ngreatest happiness principle \u2013 that can be used, directly or\nindirectly, both by individuals and by institutions (such as states)\nin deciding what to do, rather than simply as a tool for evaluating\nstates of affairs. Utilitarianism cannot plausibly provide a theory of\njustice unless it is interpreted in this action-guiding way, in light\nof what was said above about justice and agency. We also assume that\nthe most likely candidate will be a rule-utilitarian view that treats\nprinciples of justice as belonging to the set of rules which when\nfollowed by the relevant agents will tend to produce the greatest\ntotal utility (for different ways of formulating this view, see the\nentry on\n rule consequentialism).\n",
