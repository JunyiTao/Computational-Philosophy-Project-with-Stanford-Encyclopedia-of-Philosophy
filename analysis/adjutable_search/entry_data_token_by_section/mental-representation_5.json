Internalism and Externalism\n\nGenerally, those who, like informational theorists, think relations to\none\u2019s (natural or social) environment are (at least partially)\ndeterminative of the content of mental representations are\nexternalists, or anti-individualists (e.g., Burge\n1979, 1986b, 2010, McGinn 1977), whereas those who, like some\nproponents of functional theories, think representational content is\ndetermined by an individual\u2019s intrinsic properties alone, are\ninternalists (or individualists; cf. Putnam 1975,\nFodor\n 1981c).[5]\n\nThis issue is widely taken to be of central importance, since\npsychological explanation, whether commonsense or scientific, is\nsupposed to be both causal and content-based. (Beliefs and desires\ncause the behaviors they do because they have the contents they do.\nFor example, the desire that one have a beer and the beliefs\nthat there is beer in the refrigerator and that the\nrefrigerator is in the kitchen may explain one\u2019s getting up\nand going to the kitchen.) If, however, a mental\nrepresentation\u2019s having a particular content is due to factors\nextrinsic to it, it is unclear how its having that content\ncould determine its causal powers, which, arguably, must be intrinsic\n(see Stich 1983, Fodor 1982, 1987, 1994). Some who accept the standard\narguments for externalism have argued that internal factors determine\na component of the content of a mental representation. They\nsay that mental representations have both \u201cnarrow\u201d content\n(determined by intrinsic factors) and \u201cwide\u201d or\n\u201cbroad\u201d content (determined by narrow content plus\nextrinsic factors). (This distinction may be applied to the\nsub-personal representations of cognitive science as well as to those\nof commonsense psychology. See von Eckardt 1993: 189.)\n\nNarrow content has been variously construed. Putnam (1975), Fodor\n(1982: 114; 1994: 39ff), and Block (1986: 627ff), for example, seem to\nunderstand it as something like de dicto content (i.e.,\nFregean sense, or perhaps character, \u00e0 la\nKaplan 1989). On this construal, narrow content is context-independent\nand directly expressible. Fodor (1987) and Block (1986), however, have\nalso characterized narrow content as radically inexpressible.\nOn this construal, narrow content is a kind of proto-content, or\ncontent-determinant, and can be specified only indirectly, via\nspecifications of context/wide-content pairings. On both construals,\nnarrow contents are characterized as functions from context to (wide)\ncontent. The narrow content of a representation is determined by\nproperties intrinsic to it or its possessor, such as its syntactic\nstructure or its intramental computational or inferential role.\n\nBurge (1986b) has argued that causation-based worries about\nexternalist individuation of psychological content, and the\nintroduction of the narrow notion, are misguided. Fodor (1994, 1998)\nhas more recently urged that a scientific psychology might not need\nnarrow content in order to supply naturalistic (causal) explanations\nof human cognition and action, since the sorts of cases they were\nintroduced to handle, viz., Twin-Earth cases and Frege cases, are\neither nomologically impossible or dismissible as exceptions to\nnon-strict psychological laws.\n\nOn the most common versions of externalism, though intentional\ncontents are externally determined, mental representations themselves,\nand the states they partly constitute, remain \u201cin the\nhead.\u201d More radical versions are possible. One might maintain\nthat since thoughts are individuated by their contents, and some\nthought contents are partially constituted by objects external to the\nmind, then some thoughts are partly constituted by objects external to\nthe mind. On such a view, a singular thought \u2013 i.e., a\nthought about a particular object \u2013 literally contains\nthe object it is about. It is \u201cobject-involving.\u201d Such a\nthought (and the mind that thinks it) thus extend beyond the\nboundaries of the skull. (This appears to be the view articulated in\nMcDowell 1986, on which there is \u201cinterpenetration\u201d\nbetween the mind and the world.)\n\nSee the entries on\n externalism about mental content\n and\n narrow mental content.\n\nClark and Chalmers (1998) and Clark (2001, 2005, 2008) have argued\nthat mental representations may exist entirely \u201coutside\nthe head.\u201d On their view, which they call \u201cactive\nexternalism,\u201d cognitive processes (e.g., calculation) may be\nrealized in external media (e.g., a calculator or pen and paper), and\nthe \u201ccoupled system\u201d of the individual mind and the\nexternal workspace ought to count as a cognitive system \u2013 a mind\n\u2013in its own right. Symbolic representations on external media\nwould thus count as mental representations.\n\nClark and Chalmers\u2019s paper has inspired a burgeoning literature\non extended, embodied and interactive cognition. (Menary 2010 is a\nrecent collection of essays. See also the entry on\n embodied cognition.)\n",
