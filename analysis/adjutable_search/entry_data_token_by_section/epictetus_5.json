    "main_text": "Educational method\n6. Influence\n\nThough much cultivated in person by the nobles of local Greek cities\n(as Brunt 1997 describes), Epictetus exerted far more influence\nthrough the written works produced by Arrian. The emperor Marcus\nAurelius was never in fact his pupil, but was so deeply impressed with\nwhat he had read as to consider himself a follower of the freedman\nphilosopher. In the early third century Origen remarks on the\npopularity of Epictetus with his own contemporaries, which he finds to\nrival that of Plato (Contra Celsum 6.2). Whether Origen was\nhimself much influenced by Epictetus\u2019s version of Stoicism is\nanother matter, for Origen had studied the writings of Chrysippus on\nhis own account and the strands cannot easily be separated. More\ndemonstrable is the homage paid to Epictetus by Simplicius, the\nsixth-century Aristotle commentator, who composed a long philosophical\ncommentary on the Encheiridion combining Stoic elements with\nhis own Neoplatonism.\n\nThe Encheiridion was translated into Latin by Poliziano in\n1497 and during the subsequent two centuries became exceptionally\npopular in Europe. Spanneut (1972) traces its use in monasteries in\nsuperficially Christianized form. Seventeenth-century intellectuals\nlike Guillaume du Vair, Justus Lipsius, and Thomas Gataker generally\nfound Epictetus\u2019s Stoicism to be fully compatible with\nChristianity; see the discussion in Brooke (2006). Pascal reacted\nagainst this perception; he admired Epictetus as a moralist but\nregarded it as sheer arrogance to believe that the human psyche is\npart of the divine and can be perfected by one\u2019s own efforts.\nDescartes adopted a recognizably Epictetan value system as part of his\npersonal ethics. An engagingly satirical portrayal of the potential\nimpact of Epictetus\u2019s philosophy in contemporary American life\nmay be found in Tom Wolfe\u2019s 1998 novel A Man in\nFull.\n",
