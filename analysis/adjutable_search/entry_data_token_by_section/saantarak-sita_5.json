    "main_text": "More Dynamic Aspects of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Philosophical Enterprise\n2. More Dynamic Aspects of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Philosophical Enterprise\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was a towering figure in eighth century\nIndian philosophy. It appears from the little evidence we have that he\nwas fully engaged in the philosophical arena of his day including the\ncomposition of polemical tracts against his rivals. We can assume that\nthese were taken seriously by his opponents because some of his extant\nwritings are only known today because they were preserved in Jain\nlibraries. But \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s philosophical\nstyle was richer than simple polemics. In texts like MA, he led his\nreaders through a dynamic engagement with competing views. Competing\nviews, particularly competing Buddhist philosophical views were\nutilized in his texts in ways that encouraged his readers to\ncontemplate the full impact and import of those views. In other words,\nhe seems to encourage a provisional acceptance of competing Buddhist\nviews as he presents a philosophical hierarchy of tenets. This method\nmakes for a quite dynamic engagement with those competing views where\nprovisionally taking on the competing views serves to have a\ntransformative affect on the mind of the student as they ascend the\nphilosophical hierarchy. They were not simply used as vehicles for\nilluminating his own view by contrasting it with those of his Buddhist\nrivals, though he was certainly doing that as well.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was doing more than that; he was\nencouraging his readers to take on those philosophical tenet systems\nhe considered to be hierarchically \u201clower\u201d in order to\nfacilitate what seems to be a dynamic philosophical enterprise of\nmulti-tiered engagement with a host of philosophical positions and\nviews. In a tradition where philosophical inquiry is a form of\nreligious praxis, it appears that provisional acceptance of the tenets\nof lower schools was used to ripen the mind for increasingly more\nsubtle and accurate philosophical descriptions of reality. In other\nwords, since the cultivation of experiential wisdom knowing reality is\nat the heart of what facilitates the larger tradition\u2019s\nsoteriological goals, this dynamic method can be said to serve\nsoteriological\n aims.[13]\n\nThis process can be witnessed to a degree in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s encyclopedic tenets text,\nTattvasa\u1e43graha, but is most clearly presented in MA. In\nhis application of the neither-one-nor-many argument in MA (described\nabove), the careful reader is drawn to notice that as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds through his examination of\ncompeting views, he does so through the shifting lens of three\nphilosophical\n perspectives.[14]\n In the first fifteen stanzas of the text, he seems to be analyzing\nnon-Buddhist and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika tenets as a holder of\nSautr\u0101ntika tenets would. His criticisms of those views are of a\ntype that a Sautr\u0101ntika would utilize and his forms of reasoning\nare as well. It is as if he is encouraging his readers to adopt a\nSautr\u0101ntika outlook and all that entails. Though there may be\npolemics involved (If x view can even be refuted by\nSautr\u0101ntikas, what need is there to discuss the superiority of\nthe Madhyamaka?), it appears that what is at work in an actual\nencouragement of his readers to seriously take on a Sautr\u0101ntika\nposition, at least provisionally.\n\nWhen he begins to examine the various positions of Sautr\u0101ntikas,\nhis perspective shifts and he starts to argue as a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra would. He criticizes the varying\nSautr\u0101ntika perspectives as a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra\nwould, by making criticisms about how knowledge of entities external\nto consciousness could be known. And he makes these arguments both in\nthe context of the neither-one-nor-many framework and with the types\nof reasoning Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra thinkers such as\nDharmak\u012brti, might utilize. One might think that the focus of his\ncriticisms would be solely on Madhyamaka issues about own-essences\n(svabh\u0101va), but a major focus at this point is on the\nseparation of objects from consciousness. It is as if\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is encouraging his readers to take on a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra perspective, for at this point\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita seems to feign acceptance of a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra perspective. He does not qualify\nhis acceptance as merely conventional. He argues against\nSautr\u0101ntika positions, as a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra.\nIt is only later in the text, when he begins to discuss the two truths\nthat we come to learn that his acceptance of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra tenets is qualified and\nprovisional. Finally, beginning in the forty-fifth stanza, when\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita begins to analyze various positions\nasserted by proponents of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittamatra tenet, he\ntakes on his final position as a M\u0101dhyamika. He then criticizes\nsuch positions from a M\u0101dhyamika perspective and utilizes the\nsorts of reasoning a M\u0101dhyamika would use to refute\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittamatra tenets, focusing on a rejection of\nessences. Thus, he has made his final shift in frames or scales of\nanalysis. As he concludes the neither-one-nor-many argument and\ndiscusses a host of issues of great import in the remainder of the\ntext, he maintains his final position as a M\u0101dhyamika.\n\nIn the process of these shifting provisionalities, or scales of\nanalysis, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita has led his readers through a\ndynamic engagement with a host of philosophical views. They are not\nmerely presented to be refuted (though that is certainly happening),\nbut through an apparent feigned acceptance of \u201clower\u201d\ntenets as he makes his way up a hierarchical ladder of philosophical\nviews, his readers are actively encouraged to engage fully by taking\non these other views that will ultimately be rejected. Rather than\nrefute and dismiss competing views, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita seems\nto recognize a utility in their engagement, one that serves the\nteleological function of leading the reader to (in his opinion) the\nhighest philosophical view, the Madhyamaka. For ultimately, the\npurpose of Buddhist philosophical inquiry has a soteriological\nfunction as well. Suffering, according to the Buddha, is caused by\nconfusion and ignorance, by a misunderstanding of the world and its\nfunctions. Thus, the duty of the Buddhist philosopher is to attempt to\nindicate for the suffering masses, as clearly as possible, the precise\nnature of their confusions and misunderstandings that lay at the heart\nof their suffering. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, it is attachment\nto a fixed nature or essence in things which is at the root of the\nproblem. So a dynamic philosophical process that can skillfully lead\nreaders to the Madhyamaka perspective, the one that both understands\nand undermines all clinging to fixed natures, is a critical and\ncreative part of ascending the spiritual path.\n",
