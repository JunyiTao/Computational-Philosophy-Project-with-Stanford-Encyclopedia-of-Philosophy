Colonial Background\n\nWhile one cannot speak properly of a \u201cChilean philosophy\u201d\nuntil the former colony declared its independence from Spain in\nFebruary 1818, it would not be appropriate to ignore the activities of\nseveral philosophers during the Spanish colonial period. Philosophical\nactivity made a first appearance with the teachings of\nCrist\u00f3bal de Valdespino in the Dominican convent in Santiago in\n1595, spread quickly to other secondary schools in the seventeenth\ncentury, and picked up momentum with the creation of the Royal\nUniversity of San Felipe in 1758. Prominent scholars during this time,\nand up to the early nineteenth century include clergymen Alonso\nBrise\u00f1o, Miguel de Vi\u00f1as, Manuel Ovalle, and Manuel\nAntonio Talavera, all of whom wrote significant philosophical\ntreatises mostly within the scholastic tradition. The expulsion of the\nJesuits in 1767 meant that several talented authors, including Miguel\nde Olivares, Felipe G\u00f3mez de Vidaurre, Juan Ignacio Molina and\nManuel Lacunza, published their works elsewhere. The main difference\nbetween the two traditions resides in that the former cultivated\nphilosophy as an instrument to address theological questions whereas\nthe latter were more oriented to practical concerns, such as\nunderstanding the conditions of the New World, and were therefore less\ninterested in theological questions. Lay authors who covered some\nphilosophical themes reflecting the concerns of the Enlightenment\nduring the late colonial period included Manuel de Salas and Juan\nEga\u00f1a, who served as bridges to the post-independence\nperiod.\n\nBut it is with the foundation of Chile as an independent republic that\nChilean philosophy began to be cultivated in a systematic manner\nwithin institutions of higher education entrusted with a deliberate\nnational purpose. Five major periods characterize the history of the\ndiscipline: the formative years from Independence through 1865; the\nascendancy and decline of Positivism from 1865 through 1920; the\nanti-positivist reaction from 1920 to 1950; the rise and critique of\nprofessionalization from 1950 to 1973, and the fate of philosophy\nunder military rule, from 1973 to 1990. These periods coincide roughly\nwith the major stages in the development of philosophy in other\ncountries in the region. The period since 1990, when Chile returned to\ndemocratic rule, is much more difficult to trace and define. And yet,\nthe main foundations of the discipline have not changed in any\nsubstantial way.\n",
