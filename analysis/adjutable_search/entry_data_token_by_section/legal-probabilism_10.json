    "main_text": "The Strength of Evidence || The two-stain problem\n2.4 The two-stain problem\n\nA case study that further illustrates the limitations of the\nlikelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary strength is the two-stain\nproblem, originally formulated by Evett (1987).\n\nIn Evett\u2019s original formulation, two stains from two different\nsources are left at the crime scene, and the suspect\u2019s blood\nmatches one of them. Let the first hypothesis be that the suspect was\none of the two men who committed the crime and the second hypothesis\nthe negation of the first. Evett (1987) shows (see his paper for\ndetails) that the likelihood ratio of the match relative to these two\nhypotheses is \\(\\slashfrac{1}{2q_1}\\) where \\(q_1\\) is the estimated\nfrequency of the characteristics of the first stain. Surprisingly, the\nlikelihood ratio does not depend on the frequency associated with the\nsecond stain.\n\nConsider now a more complex two-stain scenario. Suppose a crime was\ncommitted by two people, who left two stains at the crime scene: one\non a pillow and another on a sheet. John Smith, who was arrested for a\ndifferent reason, genetically matches the DNA on the pillow, but not\nthe one on the sheet. Meester and Sjerps (2004) argue that there are\nthree plausible pairs of hypotheses associated with numerically\ndifferent likelihood ratios (see their paper for details). The three\noptions are listed in\n table 2,\n where \\(R\\) is the random match probability of Smith\u2019s genetic\nprofile and \\(\\delta\\) the prior probability that Smith was one of the\ncrime scene donors.\n\nTable 2\n\n\n\\(H_p\\)\n\\(H_d\\)\nLR  \n\n\nSmith was one of the crime scene donors.\nSmith was not one of the crime scene donors.\n\\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) \n\nSmith was the pillow stain donor.\nSmith was not one of the crime scene donors.\n\\(R\\) \n\nSmith was the pillow stain donor.\nSmith was not the pillow stain donor.\n\\(\\frac{R(2-\\delta)}{2(1-\\delta)}\\)\n \n\n\nEven though the likelihood ratios are numerically different, their\nposterior probabilities given the evidence are the same. Note that the\nprior odds of the three \\(H_p\\)\u2019s in the table should be written\nin terms of \\(\\delta\\). Following (Meester and Sjerps 2004), the\nprior odds of the first hypothesis in the table are\n\\(\\slashfrac{\\delta}{(1-\\delta)}\\). The prior odds of the second\nhypothesis are \\(\\slashfrac{(\\delta/2)}{(1-\\delta)}\\). The prior odds\nof the third hypothesis are\n\\(\\slashfrac{(\\delta/2)}{(1-(\\delta/2))}\\). In each case, the\nposterior odds\u2014the result of multiplying the prior odds by the\nlikelihood ratio\u2014are the same: \\(R\\times\n\\slashfrac{\\delta}{(2(1-\\delta))}\\). So despite differences in the\nlikelihood ratio, the posterior odds of the different hypotheses are\nthe same so long as the priors are appropriately related.\n\nMeester and Sjerps (2004) recommend that each likelihood ratio should\nbe accompanied by a tabular account of how a choice of prior odds (or\nprior probabilities) will impact the posterior odds, for a sensible\nrange of priors (for a general discussion of this strategy, called\n\u201csensitivity analysis\u201d, see earlier discussion in\n \u00a71.4).\n In this way, the impact of the likelihood ratio is made clear, no\nmatter the hypotheses chosen. This strategy concedes that likelihood\nratios are insufficiently informative, and that they should be\ncombined with other information, such as a range of priors, to allow\nfor an adequate assessment of the evidence.\n",
