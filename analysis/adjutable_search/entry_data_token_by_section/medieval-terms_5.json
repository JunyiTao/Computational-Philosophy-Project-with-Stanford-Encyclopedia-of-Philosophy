    "main_text": "Relation\n6. Relation\n\nLambert of Auxerre (tr. Maloney, p. 290) speaks explicitly of relation\nas a property of terms, but most authors describe the phenomenon as\nthe supposition of relatives. The relation in question is that between\nanaphoric terms and their antecedents. Most treatises consist of a\nrepetition of a standard taxonomy: there are relatives of substance\nand relatives of accident, relatives of identity and relatives of\ndiversity. For example, relatives of substance and of identity are\n\u2018who\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, \u2018his\u2019, and among\nthese, reciprocal relatives such as \u2018himself\u2019; of\ndiversity are \u2018another\u2019 and \u2018someone else\u2019.\nThe latter are said to refer back (referre, past participle\nrelatum) to their antecedent but to supposit for something\ndifferent, as in, e.g., \u2018Socrates is running and someone else is\ndebating\u2019. Relatives of accident include, first, those of\nidentity, \u2018such as\u2019, \u2018like\u2019,\n\u2018when\u2019, and those of diversity, \u2018in another\nway\u2019, \u2018other\u2019; in, say, \u2018Socrates is running\nand Plato is other\u2019, \u2018other\u2019 refers back to\n\u2018running\u2019; in what way it differs will depend on the\nauthor\u2019s account of predicates.\n\nIn contrast to the extensive taxonomy, medieval discussions of\nrelatives before the mid-fourteenth century seem rather short on\ntheory, dealing with puzzles more by common sense and description than\nin any unified way. For example, the prevailing view is that relatives\nof identity preserve the supposition of their antecedent. Why, then,\ncan they usually not replace the antecedent? Consider, e.g.,\n\u2018Every man sees himself\u2019. Does \u2018himself\u2019 have\nthe same supposition as \u2018man\u2019 (or \u2018every man\u2019)\nand if so, why can the antecedent not replace it? \u2013 for\n\u2018Every man sees every man\u2019 has a very different\nsignification. Lambert (tr. Maloney, p. 299) claims that in the case\nof reciprocal relatives the reciprocal pronoun can replace the\nantecedent unless the antecedent is taken universally, as in\n\u2018Every man sees himself\u2019. In this case, it still supposits\nfor the same as its antecedent, but in a different way, namely,\ndiscretely. Ockham spells it out: \u201cin \u2018Every man sees\nhimself\u2019, \u2018himself\u2019 supposits for every man by means\nof confused and distributive mobile supposition: but it does this\nsingularly since it is not possible to descend without altering the\nother extreme \u2026 thus, \u2018Every man sees himself, therefore,\nSocrates sees Socrates\u2019\u201d (tr. Loux p.\n 218).[39]\n\nOckham claims that, although non-reciprocal relatives of identity\nalways supposit for that for which their antecedent supposits, those\nwhose antecedent is a general term occurring with personal supposition\ncan never be replaced by their antecedent and result in an equivalent\nproposition. For example, \u2018A man runs and he disputes\u2019 is\nnot convertible with \u2018A man runs and a man disputes\u2019.\nBuridan has two rules to explain what is happening (Summulae,\ntr. Klima pp. 283\u20134):\n\nA relative of identity \u201crefers back to its antecedent only\nwith respect to those of the antecedent\u2019s supposita for which\nthe categorical proposition in which its antecedent occurred was\nverified\u201d\nA relative of identity \u201csupposits or is taken in a\nproposition as is its antecedent, namely, materially if materially,\npersonally if personally, distributively if distributively,\ndeterminately if determinately, merely confusedly if merely\nconfusedly\u201d, except as in 1.\n\n\nHence, in e.g., \u2018Man is a species and it is predicable of\nmany\u2019, or \u2018Socrates runs and he disputes\u2019, the\nrelative can be replaced without loss of meaning by its antecedent.\nBut in \u2018A man runs and he disputes\u2019, it cannot, for the\nsupposition would change. \u2018He\u2019 supposits only for men who\nare running, whereas \u2018a man\u2019, if it replaced it, would\nsupposit for all men.\n\nAnother issue concerned identifying the contradictory of a proposition\ncontaining a relative. A categorical containing a relative of identity\nsuch as \u2018A, which is B, is C\u2019\nis equivalent to \u2018A is B and A is\nC\u2019. Hence its contradictory, \u2018A, which\nis B, is not C\u2019, says Albert of Saxony, is\nequivalent to \u2018A is not B or A is not\nC\u2019: \u201cThe second rule: a negative categorical\nproposition in which a relative term occurs is equivalent to a\ndisjunctive proposition: e.g., \u2018Socrates, who is running, is not\ndisputing\u2019 has the same truth-value as \u2018Socrates is not\nrunning or Socrates is not disputing\u2019. And therefore such a\nproposition has two causes of truth, each of which is sufficient on\nits own for its truth. Hence \u2018Socrates, who is running, is not\ndisputing\u2019 is true either because Socrates is not running or\nbecause Socrates is not disputing. Hence because by the first rule the\naffirmative is equivalent to a conjunction, it follows that the\nnegative contradictory to it is equivalent to a disjunction composed\nfrom the contradictories of the conjuncts, since conjunctions and\ndisjunctions with contradictory parts contradict one\n another\u201d.[40]\n",
