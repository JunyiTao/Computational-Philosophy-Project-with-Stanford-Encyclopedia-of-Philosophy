Alternative Deontic Principles\n\nInstead of changing the non-deontic propositional basis of Mally\u2019s\nsystem, one might also modify the specifically deontic axioms and\nrules. This might of course be done in various ways, but the following\napproach works well without departing too much from Mally\u2019s original\n assumptions.[26]\n\nFirst, regard f as primitive and replace Mally\u2019s definition of f in\nterms of \u2192 and ! (Def.\u00a0f, the very first specifically\ndeontic postulate in Mally\u2019s book) by the following definition of ! in\nterms of V and f :\n\n\nDef. !.\n!A = V f A \n\n\nSecond, replace Axiom\u00a0I, which may also be written as (B \u2192\nC) \u2192 ((A f B) \u2192 (A f C)), with the following rule of\ninference:\n\n\nRule f.\nB \u2192 C / (A f B) \u2192 (A f C) \n\n\nWe may then derive:\n\n\n1.\nB \u2192 C / !B \u2192 !C\n[ Def.\u00a0!, R f ] \n\n2.\n(!A & !B) \u2192 !(A & B)\n[ Def.\u00a0!, Ax.\u00a0II ] \n\n3.\n!V\n[ 1, Ax.\u00a0IV, PC ] \n\n4.\n\u00ac!\u039b\n[ 1, Ax.\u00a0III(\u2190), Ax.\u00a0V, PC (ex\nfalso) ] \n\n\nThe so-called standard system of deontic logic KD is\ndefined as PC supplemented with 1-4 (except that ! is\nusually written as O: see the entry on\n deontic logic),\n so the new system is at least as strong as KD. It is\nnot difficult to see that it is in fact identical with\nKD supplemented with OU (Mally\u2019s Axiom\u00a0IV) and\nthe following definition of f : A f B = O(A \u2192 B). In modern\ndeontic logic, the notion of commitment is sometimes defined\nin this way.\n\nIn the new system, Mally\u2019s theorems have the following status.\n\nII\u2032, IV\u2032, (1)\u2013(5), (7)\u2013(11), (13)\u2013(15), (17),\n(20)\u2013(24) and (27)\u2013(32) are derivable.\nI\u2032, III\u2032, V\u2032, (6), (12), (16), (18)\u2013(19),\n(25)\u2013(26), (33)\u2013(35), A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are not\nderivable.\nThere are 20 mismatches with Mally\u2019s deontic expectations: 10\n\u201cplausible\u201d formulas are no longer derivable, namely\nI\u2032, III\u2032, V\u2032, (6), (12), (16), (18)\u2013(19) and\n(25)\u2013(26), and 10 \u201csurprising\u201d theorems are still\nderivable, namely (1), (2), (7), (22) and (27)\u2013(32).\nAlthough (34) and (35) are not derivable, adding them would by no\nmeans lead to the theoremhood of A \u2194 !A.\n\n\nThere were only 12 mismatches in the case of RD, so\nthe new system does less justice to Mally\u2019s deontic expectations than\nRD did. But it agrees better with his general outlook\nbecause it is still based on classical propositional logic, a system\nto which Mally did not object (not that he had much choice in the\n1920s).\n\nMany of Mally\u2019s surprising theorems are derivable in\nKD, but they have, as it were, lost their sting:\nthose theorems lead to surprising consequences when combined with\nMally\u2019s Axiom\u00a0I and his definition of f , but they are completely\nharmless without these postulates.\n\nThe standard system of deontic logic has several problematical\nfeatures. The fact that each provable statement is obligatory is often\nregarded as counterintuitive, and there are many other well-known\n\u201cparadoxes.\u201d The revised version of Mally\u2019s system shares\nthese problematical features. But we will not discuss these issues\nhere. The standard system is at any rate better than Mally\u2019s original\nproposal.\n",
