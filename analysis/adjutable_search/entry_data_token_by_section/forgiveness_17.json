    "main_text": "The Ethics of Forgiveness || Forgiveness as a Virtue\n9.1 Forgiveness as a Virtue\n\nWithin Western traditions, forgiveness has often been regarded as a\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d virtue (Scarre 2004), and its\nopposite, unwillingness to forgive, as a vice. Yet this poses an\nimmediate problem of interpretation, namely, whether forgiveness is a\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d virtue in the sense\nthat while it is morally laudable it is beyond duty (i.e.,\nsupererogatory). Since supererogatory actions are permissible, not\nobligatory, it follows that a failure to forgive, at least in\ncircumstances where forgiving would be supererogatory, would not,\ncontrary to the aforementioned view, be a vice. However, widespread\nand persistent disagreement within moral philosophy both about\nsupererogation and the deontic nature of forgiveness have led to\nconflicting views on the relation between forgiveness and moral\nobligation (see, e.g., Gamlund 2010; Lauritzen 1987). Some thinkers\nhave argued that forgiveness is a duty (Rashdall 1907) while others\nhave maintained that, like a gift with no strings attached,\nforgiveness is utterly gratuitous (Heyd 1982). It might also be\nthought that, similar to the duty of charity in Kant\u2019s moral\nsystem, forgiveness is properly regarded as an imperfect duty. Unlike\nperfect duties such as the obligation to justice or honesty, imperfect\nduties allow for agential discretion over when and with respect to\nwhom to discharge the duty. In this way, forgiveness may be located in\na system of moral duties that allows for no supererogatory deeds at\nall.\n\nIn contrast to duty-based approaches to forgiveness, virtue-based\nperspectives suggest that the overcoming or forswearing of angry\nreactive attitudes characteristic of forgiveness must be grounded in\nor expressive of relatively stable and durable dispositions or\ncharacter traits (Roberts 1995; Sadler 2008; Radzik 2010). On such\nviews, forgiveness is a virtue, or is at least closely aligned with\none or more of the traditional virtues such as magnanimity or\nsympathy. Within ancient Greek thought the views of Plato and\nAristotle on the relationship between anger and living virtuously are\nnoteworthy, as is the Christian traditions\u2019 understanding of\nforgiveness as love or compassion.\n\nAlthough forgiveness is not identified as a distinct virtue in\nPlato\u2019s work, the Platonic perspective on anger illuminates the\ngeneral emotional landscape in which forgiveness has often been\nlocated and from which it derives much of its value. In his discussion\non the nature of community and individual morality in Book IV of the\nRepublic, Plato makes clear that demonstrations of anger are\ngenerally regarded as manifestations of intemperance, which is a vice,\nand since angry emotions are ever a threat to overwhelm reason and\nself-control they must be rationally controlled in the name of a\nharmonious ordering of the different parts of the soul, which is the\nessence of a morally good person (Republic, 439\u2013442).\nBy contrast, Aristotle, in his discussion of virtues and vices\nrelative to anger in Book IV of the Nicomachean Ethics,\nexplains that \u201cgood temper\u201d is the mean between the\nextremes of irascibility, an excess of anger, and inirascibility, or\nwhat he alternatively calls a \u201cnameless\u201d deficiency of\nanger, and that the good-tempered person \u201cis not revengeful, but\nrather tends to forgive\u201d (1126a1). Aristotle\u2019s general\nperspective on morally appropriate anger is that the person of virtue\nis \u201cangry at the right things and with the right people, and,\nfurther, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought\u201d\n(1125b32). In general, both Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s views\nsuggest that anger controlled by or expressive of reason may be seen\nas manifesting virtue, whereas anger ungoverned by rationality is a\nvice.\n\nA disposition to too readily forgive may be symptomatic of a lack of\nself-respect, or indicative of servility, ordinarily viewed as moral\ninfirmities or vices (Novitz 1998). This recalls Aristotle\u2019s\nidea that the person deficient in appropriate anger is \u201cunlikely\nto defend himself\u201d and \u201cendure being insulted\u201d and\nis for this reason a \u201cfool\u201d (Nicomachean Ethics,\n1126a5), Kant\u2019s notion that a person who fails to become angry\nat injustices done to him lacks dignity and self-respect (Kant [c.\n1770\u20131794] 1997, cf. Sussman 2005; Ware 2014), and Hume\u2019s\nassertion that since anger and hatred are \u201cinherent in our very\nframe and constitution\u201d the lack of such feelings is sometimes\nevidence of \u201cweakness and imbecility\u201d ([1740] 1958: 605).\nThat interpersonal forgiveness does not always serve morally laudable\naims suggests that a general account of the criteria for justified and\nmorally permissible or even obligatory forgiveness is needed to\ndistinguish appropriate from inappropriate forgiving.\n\nSeveral virtue-theoretic perspectives contrary both to early Greek\nnotions that anger appropriately mediated by reason is a virtue, and\nfrom the Christian view that forgiveness as transcending anger in an\nact of love is a virtue, should be mentioned. First, Nietzsche\u2019s\nconception of ressentiment as sublimated anger/envy directed\nat the noble man suggests that both dispositional and episodic anger\nmay be manifestations of weakness or vice, not strength, self-respect,\nor virtue (Nietzsche [1887] 1967; cf. Griswold 2007; Blustein 2014).\nThis is reminiscent of Plutarch\u2019s view that anger is like a\ndisease, and extreme or abiding anger such as rage or bitterness are\nunnatural dispositional states (Plutarch [c. 100 CE] 2000). We should\nadd to these views the observation that the negative effects of being\nangrily obsessed by someone\u2019s wrongdoing is not by itself a\njustification for blaming or forgiving him. Put differently, though it\nmight be a bad thing to be angrily obsessed with having been wronged,\nit does not follow from this that a victim of wrong must forgive the\nwrongdoer. There are, after all, other ways of transcending or purging\nrecalcitrant anger which might be more appropriate than would be\nforgiving. \n\nNietzsche\u2019s view suggests the further idea that even episodic\nangry emotions may be a sign of moral infirmity, insofar as such\nemotions concede power to others by revealing one\u2019s\nvulnerability to injury. But the truly noble or strong are thought to\nhave, in some sense, no such vulnerabilities. Second, some recent\npopular views suggest that the uninhibited expression of anger and\nrage is a good thing, insofar as such venting is cathartic. But on\nconsequentialist grounds alone it seems clear that controlling intense\nanger rather than its unfettered expression is closer to what a good\nlife requires, for though anger may sometimes be enabling in\nmotivating constructive solutions to personal or political problems,\nits indiscriminate expression is more likely to be disabling, both for\nthose expressing it and for those around them. This last remark\nrelates to a third disparaging view of angry reactive attitudes, that\nof the Stoic Seneca, who maintains that all forms of anger are\ninconsistent with the moral life because they dispose us to cruelty\nand vengeance, which passions encourage us to see other people as less\nthan fully human (De Ira, c. 50CE). On this view, the person\nof virtue is one who strives to extirpate anger in all its forms.\nThese three perspectives seem to imply that since anger is never an\nappropriate emotion, forgiveness cannot be a virtue, at least in the\nsense of overcoming justified anger.\n\nWhat is the connection between forgiveness and another virtue, that of\njustice? Forgiveness has long been regarded by some as in conflict\nwith justice, if not incompatible with it. Seneca (De\nClementia, c. 55CE) claimed that \n\n\nPardon is given to a man who ought to be punished; but a wise man does\nnothing that he ought not to do, omits to do nothing which he ought \nto do; therefore he does not remit a punishment which he ought to\nexact. \n\n\nMercy, by contrast, is aligned with justice in the sense that\n\u201cit declares that those who are let off did not deserve any\ndifferent treatment\u201d (De Clementia). Considering the\nspecific circumstances of individual cases is a matter of mercy,\n\u201cnot of forgiveness\u201d. Mercy, unlike pardon and\nforgiveness, is an exercise of equity, which is an application of\njustice in light of the unique circumstances of individual cases. By\ncontrast, the prerogative of pardon associated with such political\nexecutives as Presidents, Prime Ministers, and other authorities may\nbe viewed, according to Aristotle, as an exercise of equity in the\nsense that such duly established authorities are commonly thought to\nuse that power as a way of mitigating the rigors of universal\nstandards of justice in their application to particular cases the\nspecifics of which appear to fall beyond the scope of the universal\nrule (Wolsterstorff 2009; Bingham 2009).\n",
