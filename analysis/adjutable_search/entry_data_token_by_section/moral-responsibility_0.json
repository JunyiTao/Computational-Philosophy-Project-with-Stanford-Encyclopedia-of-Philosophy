    "main_text": "Freedom, Responsibility, and Determinism\n1. Freedom, Responsibility, and Determinism\n\nHow is the responsible agent related to her actions; what power does\nshe exercise over them? One (partial) answer is that the relevant\npower is a form of control, and, in particular, a form of control such\nthat the agent could have done otherwise than to perform the\naction in question. This captures one commonsense notion of free will,\nand one of the central issues in debates about free will has been\nabout whether possession of it (free will, in the\nability-to-do-otherwise sense) is compatible with causal determinism\n(or with, for example, divine foreknowledge\u2014see the\n entry on foreknowledge and free will).\n\nIf causal determinism is true, then the occurrence of any event\n(including events involving human deliberation, choice, and action)\nthat does in fact occur was made inevitable by\u2014because it was\ncausally necessitated by\u2014the facts about the past (and the laws\nof nature) prior to the occurrence of the event. Under these\nconditions, the facts about the present, and about the future, are\nuniquely fixed by the facts about the past (and about the laws of\nnature): given these earlier facts, the present and the future can\nunfold in only one way. For more, see the\n entry on causal determinism.\n\nIf possession of free will requires an ability to act otherwise than\none in fact does, then it is fairly easy to see why free will has\noften been regarded as incompatible with causal determinism. One way\nof getting at this incompatibilist worry is to focus on the\nway in which performance of a given action should be up to an\nagent if he has the sort of free will required for moral\nresponsibility. As the influential Consequence Argument has it (Ginet\n1966; van Inwagen 1983: 55\u2013105; Wiggins 1973), the truth of\ndeterminism seems to entail that an agent\u2019s actions are\nnot up to him since they are the unavoidable consequences of\nthings over which the agent lacks control. Here is an informal summary\nof this argument from Peter van Inwagen\u2019s important book, An\nEssay on Free Will (1983):\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (1983: 16)\n\n\nFor an important argument that suggests that the Consequence Argument\nconflates different senses in which the laws of nature are not up to\nus, see David Lewis (1981). For more on incompatibilism and\nincompatibilist arguments, see the entries on \n free will, \n arguments for incompatibilism, \nand \n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will, \nas well as Randolph Clarke (2003).\n\nCompatibilists maintain that free will (and/or moral\nresponsibility) is possible even in a deterministic universe. Versions\nof compatibilism have been defended since ancient times. For example,\nthe Stoics\u2014Chryssipus, in particular\u2014argued that the truth\nof determinism does not entail that human actions are entirely\nexplained by factors external to agents; thus, human actions are not\nnecessarily explained in a way that is incompatible with praise and\nblame (see Bobzien 1998 and Salles 2005 for Stoic views on freedom and\ndeterminism). Similarly, philosophers in the Modern period (such as\nHobbes and Hume) distinguished the general way in which our actions\nare necessitated if determinism is true from the specific instances of\nnecessity sometimes imposed on us by everyday constraints on our\nbehavior (e.g., physical impediments that make it impossible to act as\nwe choose). The difference is that the necessity involved in\ndeterminism is compatible with agents acting as they choose to act:\neven if S\u2019s behavior is causally determined, it may be\nbehavior that she chooses to perform. And perhaps the ability that\nmatters for free will (and responsibility) is just the ability to act\nas one chooses, which seems to require only the absence of external\nconstraints (and not the absence of determinism).\n\nThis compatibilist tradition was carried into the twentieth century by\nlogical positivists such A. J. Ayer (1954) and Moritz Schlick (1930\n[1966]). Here is how Schlick expressed the central compatibilist\ninsight in 1930 (drawing, in particular, on Hume): \n\n\nFreedom means the opposite of compulsion; a man is free if he\ndoes not act under compulsion, and he is compelled or unfree\nwhen he is hindered from without\u2026when he is locked up, or\nchained, or when someone forces him at the point of a gun to do what\notherwise he would not do. (1930 [1966: 59])\n\n\nSince deterministic causal pressures do not always force one to\n\u201cdo what otherwise he would not do\u201d, freedom\u2014at\nleast of the sort specified by Schlick\u2014is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nA closely related compatibilist strategy, influential in the early and\nmid-twentieth century, was to offer a conditional analysis of the\nability to do otherwise (Ayer 1954, Hobart 1934, Moore 1912; for\nearlier expressions, see Hobbes 1654 and Hume 1748). As just noted,\neven if determinism is true, agents may often act as they choose, and\nit is equally compatible with determinism that an agent who performed\nact A (on the basis of his choice to do so) might have\nperformed a different action on the condition that (contrary\nto what actually happened) she had chosen to perform the other action.\nEven if a person\u2019s actual behavior is causally determined by the\nactual past, it may be that if the past had been suitably different\n(e.g., if the person\u2019s desires, intentions, choices, etc. had\nbeen different), then she would have acted differently. And perhaps\nthis is all that the ability to do otherwise comes to: one can do\notherwise if it is true that if one had chosen to do otherwise, then\none would have done otherwise. \n\nHowever, this compatibilist picture is open to serious objections.\nFirst, it might be granted that an ability to act as one sees fit is\nvaluable, and perhaps related to the type of freedom at issue in the\nfree will debate, but it does not follow that this is all\nthat possession of free will comes to. A person who has certain\ndesires as a result of indoctrination, brainwashing, or\npsychopathology may act as he chooses, but his free will and moral\nresponsibility may still be called into question. (For more on the\nrelevance of such factors, see\n \u00a73.2\n and\n \u00a73.3.3.)\n More specifically, the conditional analysis is open to the following\nsort of counterexample. It might be true that an agent who performs\nact A would have omitted A if she had so chosen, but it\nmight also be true that the agent in question suffers from an\noverwhelming compulsion to perform act A. The conditional\nanalysis suggests that the agent in question retains the ability to do\notherwise than A, but, given her compulsion, it seems clear\nthat she lacks this ability (Broad 1934, Chisholm 1964, Lehrer 1968,\nvan Inwagen 1983). More generally, incompatibilists are likely to be\ndissatisfied with the conditional analysis since it fails to give an\naccount of an ability that agents can have, right here and right now,\nto either perform or omit an action while holding everything about the\nhere and now, and about the past, fixed.\n\nDespite the above objections, the compatibilist project described so\nfar has had significant lasting influence. As will be seen below, the\nfact that determined agents can act as they see fit is still an\nimportant inspiration for compatibilists, as is the fact that\ndetermined agents may have acted differently in counterfactual\ncircumstances. For more, see the\n entry on compatibilism.\n For recent accounts related to (and improving upon) early\ncompatibilist approaches, see Michael Fara (2008), Michael Smith\n(2003), and Kadri Vihvelin (2004), and for criticism of these\naccounts, see Randolph Clarke (2009).\n\nAnother influential trend in compatibilism has been to argue that\nmoral responsibility does not require an ability to do\notherwise. If this is right, then determinism would not threaten\nresponsibility by ruling out access to behavioral alternatives (though\ndeterminism might threaten responsibility in other ways: see van\nInwagen 1983: 182\u201388 and Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n151\u2013168). In a very influential 1969 paper, Harry Frankfurt\noffers examples meant to show that an agent can be morally responsible\nfor an action even if he could not have done otherwise. Versions of\nthese examples are often called Frankfurt cases or\nFrankfurt examples. In the basic form of the example, an\nagent, Jones, considers a certain action. Another agent, Black, would\nlike to see Jones perform this action and, if necessary, Black can\nmake Jones perform it through some type of intervention in\nJones\u2019s deliberative process. However, as things transpire,\nBlack does not intervene in Jones\u2019s decision making since he can\nsee that Jones will perform the action on his own and for his own\nreasons. Black does not intervene to ensure Jones\u2019s action, but\nhe could have, and he would have, had Jones showed some sign that he\nwould not perform the action on his own. Therefore, Jones could\nnot have done otherwise, yet he seems responsible for his\nbehavior. After all, given Black\u2019s non-intervention,\nJones\u2019s action is a perfectly ordinary bit of voluntary\nbehavior.\n\nThere are questions about whether Frankfurt\u2019s example really\nshows that Jones is morally responsible even though he couldn\u2019t\nhave done otherwise. For one thing, it may not be clear that Jones\nreally couldn\u2019t have done otherwise: while he performed the\naction on his own, there was the alternative that he perform the\naction due to some intervention on Black\u2019s part, and not on his\nown. Furthermore, though he did not do so, Jones might have\ngiven Black some indication that he would not perform the action in\nquestion. Alternatively, an objection might be framed by asking how\nBlack could be certain that Jones would or would not perform the\naction on his own. There seems to be a dilemma here. Perhaps\ndeterminism obtains in the universe of the example, and Black sees\nsome sign that indicates the presence of factors that causally\nensure that Jones will behave in a particular way. But in this\ncase, incompatibilists are unlikely to grant that Jones is morally\nresponsible if they think that moral responsibility is incompatible\nwith determinism. On the other hand, perhaps determinism is not true\nin the universe of the example, but then it is not clear that the\nexample excludes alternatives for Jones: if Jones\u2019s behavior\nisn\u2019t causally determined, then perhaps he can do\notherwise. For objections to Frankfurt\u2019s original example along\nthese lines, see Carl Ginet (1996) and David Widerker (1995); for\ndefenses of Frankfurt, see John M. Fischer (1994: 131\u2013159; 2002;\n2010); and for refined versions of Frankfurt\u2019s example, meant to\nclearly deny Jones access to alternatives, see Alfred Mele and David\nRobb (1998), David Hunt (2000), and Derk Pereboom (2000; 2001:\n18\u201328).\n\nIn response to criticisms such as the above, Frankfurt has said that\nhis example was intended mainly to draw attention to the fact\n\u201cthat making an action unavoidable is not the same\nthing as bringing it about that the action is performed\u201d\n(2006: 340; emphasis in original). In particular, while determinism\nmay make an agent\u2019s action unavoidable, it does not follow that\nthe agent acts as he does only because determinism is true:\nit may also be true that he acts as he does because he wants to and\nbecause he sees reasons in favor of so acting. The point of his\noriginal example, Frankfurt suggests, was to draw attention to the\nsignificance that the actual causes of an agent\u2019s\nbehavior (such as her reasons and desires) can have independently of\nwhether the agent might have done something else. Frankfurt concludes\nthat \u201c[w]hen a person acts for reasons of his own\u2026the\nquestion of whether he could have done something else instead is quite\nirrelevant\u201d for the purposes of assessing responsibility (2006:\n340). A focus on the actual causes that lead to behavior, as well as\ninvestigation into when an agent can be said to act on her\nown reasons, has characterized a great deal of work on\nresponsibility since Frankfurt\u2019s essay (see \n \u00a72.3\nand \n \u00a73.3.3).\n",
