    "main_text": "The Scope of Justice || Human vs non-human animals\n3.1 Human vs non-human animals\n\nWhat does a creature have to do, or be like, to be included within the\nscope of (at least some) principles of justice? Most past philosophers\nhave assumed that the line should be drawn so as to exclude all\nnon-human animals, but more recently some have been prepared to defend\n\u2018justice for animals\u2019 (Nussbaum 2006, ch. 6; Garner 2013).\nAgainst this, Rawls asserts that although we have \u2018duties of\ncompassion and humanity\u2019 towards animals and should refrain from\ntreating them cruelly, nonetheless they are \u2018outside the scope\nof the theory of justice\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p. 512; Rawls 1999, p.\n448). How could this claim be justified?\n\nWe can focus our attention either on individual features that humans\npossess and animals lack, and that might be thought relevant to their\ninclusion within the scope of justice, or on asymmetries in the\nrelationship between humans and other animals. To begin with the\nlatter, Hume claimed that the domination humans exercised over animals\n\u2013 such that an animal could only possess something by virtue of\nour permission \u2013 meant that we were \u2018bound by the laws of\nhumanity to give gentle usage to these creatures, but should not,\nproperly speaking, lie under any restraint of justice with regard to\nthem\u2019 (Hume, Enquiry, p. 190). For Rawls and those\ninfluenced by him, principles of distributive justice apply among\nagents who are related to one another as participants in a\n\u2018cooperative venture for mutual advantage\u2019, and this might\nseem to exclude animals from the scope of such principles. Critics of\nthis view have pointed to cases of human-animal co-operation\n(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011, Valentini 2014); however these arguments\nfocus mainly or entirely on the special case of dogs, and it\nseems implausible to generalise from them in an attempt to show that\nhuman-animal relationships generally have a co-operative\ncharacter.\n\nBut the claim that justice only applies to participants in\nco-operative practices is anyway vulnerable to the objection that it\nrisks excluding seriously disabled people, people living in isolated\ncommunities, and future generations from the scope of justice, so it\ndoes not seem compelling as a claim about justice in general (see\nfurther below). Might there be other reasons why animals cannot make\nclaims of justice on us? Another Rawls-inspired suggestion is that\nanimals lack the necessary moral powers, in particular the capacity to\nact on principles of justice themselves. They cannot distinguish what\nis justly owed to them from what is not; and they cannot determine\nwhat they owe to others \u2013 whether to humans or to other\nnon-human animals \u2013 as a matter of justice. This suggestion\ninterprets justice as involving a kind of reciprocity: an agent to\nwhom justice is due must also in principle be an agent who could\ndispense justice to others, by virtue of having the relevant capacity,\neven if for physical reasons \u2013 such as suffering from severe\ndisability \u2013 they cannot do so in practice.\n\nIf this suggestion is rejected, and we allow that some animals, at\nleast, should be included within the scope of justice, we can then ask\nabout the form that justice should take in their cases. Using the\ndistinction drawn in 2.4 above, it appears that justice for animals\nmust be non-comparative. For example, we might attribute rights to the\nanimals over whom we exercise power \u2013 rights against cruel\ntreatment, and rights to food and shelter, for instance. This would\ninvolve using a sufficiency principle to determine what animals are\nowed as a matter of justice. It is much less plausible to think that\ncomparative principles might apply, such that giving special treats to\none cat but not another could count as an injustice.\n",
