    "main_text": "Arguments in the Age of Materialism || Responses to Exclusion Arguments\n3.2 Responses to Exclusion Arguments\n\nMany writers have held that Kim-style exclusion arguments depend on an\nunderstanding of causation for which there are preferable\nalternatives. (See, e.g., Woodward 2008, 2017; Kroedel 2016; Beebee\n2017.) This kind of response is sometimes put forward as providing a\nmore correct account of causation. Other writers allow that exclusion\narguments can succeed if causation is understood as productive (or\n\u2018oomphy\u2019) causation, but hold that there are other\n\u201cconceptions of causation\u201d (Beebee, 2017) on which it\nremains acceptable to say that our mental states cause our behavior.\nEpiphenomenalists may concede that there is some such sense, but still\nthink their view is vindicated if all the productive causation is\nprovided by the physical activities of our brains.\n\nEpiphenomenalists may also emphasize that examples in exclusion\narguments are usually beliefs, desires or intentions. These mental\nproperties are closely associated with behavioral dispositions, and\ncan easily be understood in functional terms for which multiple\nrealizability is immediately plausible. As Kim (1993, 366) has\nexplicitly recognized, however, there are properties that have long\ncaused difficulties for functionalism, namely, the qualities of\nphenomenal experiences such as pains, itches, tastes, smells,\nafterimages, and so on. The \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d (Levine\n1983) or \u201cunintelligibility\u201d (Robinson 1982a) or the\n\u201chard problem\u201d (Chalmers 1996) concerning the connection\nbetween neural events and phenomenal qualities can be otherwise\nexpressed as our inability to see any necessity in that connection. We\nare unable to understand why it should be that a series of neural\nactivations occurring in various degrees of intensity and temporal\nrelations should always be accompanied by pain, or itch, or, indeed,\nby any phenomenal quality whatever. Inability to see any such\nnecessity is, of course, not a proof that such a necessity does not\nobtain. Nonetheless, absent insight into the necessity of the\nconnection between neural properties and qualitative properties, we\nare arguably in an explanatory position similar to\ntraditional epiphenomenalism. That is, we will have a sufficient\nexplanation of behavioral reactions to stimuli that invokes\nexclusively neural properties. In addition, we may hold the view that\nthese neural properties are necessarily connected to qualitative\nproperties; but, lacking explanation of this necessity, this\nconnection will contribute no understanding of how qualitative\nproperties could make a difference to behavior. Because this\ndifficulty has not been removed in the case of qualia, the success or\nfailure of the previously discussed Traditional Arguments remains\nrelevant to contemporary thinking about epiphenomenalism.\n",
