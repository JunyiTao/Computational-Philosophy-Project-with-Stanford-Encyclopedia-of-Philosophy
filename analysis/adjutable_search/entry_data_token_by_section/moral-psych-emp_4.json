    "main_text": "Egoism vs. Altruism\n5. Egoism vs. Altruism\n\nPeople often behave in ways that benefit others, and they sometimes do\nthis knowing that it will be costly, unpleasant or dangerous. But at\nleast since Plato\u2019s classic discussion in the second Book of the\nRepublic, debate has raged over why people behave in\nthis way. Are their motives altruistic, or is their behavior\nultimately motivated by self-interest? Famously, Hobbes gave this\nanswer:\n\nNo man giveth but with intention of good to himself, because gift is\nvoluntary; and of all voluntary acts, the object is to every man his\nown good; of which, if men see they shall be frustrated, there will be\nno beginning of benevolence or trust, nor consequently of mutual help.\n(1651 [1981: Ch. 15])\n\nViews like Hobbes\u2019 have come to be called\n egoism,[14]\n and this rather depressing conception of human motivation has any\nnumber of eminent philosophical advocates, including Bentham, J.S.\nMill and\n Nietzsche.[15]\n Dissenting voices, though perhaps fewer in number, have been no less\neminent. Butler, Hume, Rousseau and Adam Smith have all argued that,\nsometimes at least, human motivation is genuinely altruistic.\n\nThough the issue that divides egoistic and altruistic accounts of\nhuman motivation is largely empirical, it is easy to see why\nphilosophers have thought that the competing answers will have\nimportant consequences for moral theory. For example, Kant famously\nargued that a person should act \u201cnot from inclination but from\nduty, and by this would his conduct first acquire true moral\nworth\u201d (1785 [1949: Sec. 1, parag. 12]). But egoism maintains\nthat all human motivation is ultimately self-interested, and\nthus people can\u2019t act \u201cfrom duty\u201d in the\nway that Kant urged. Thus if egoism is true, Kant\u2019s account\nwould entail that no conduct has \u201ctrue moral worth\u201d.\nAdditionally, if egoism is true, it would appear to impose a strong\nconstraint on how a moral theory can answer the venerable question\n\u201cWhy should I be moral?\u201d since, as Hobbes clearly saw, the\nanswer will have to ground the motivation to be moral in the\nagent\u2019s\n self-interest.[16]\n\nWhile the egoism vs. altruism debate has historically been of great\nphilosophical interest, the issue centrally concerns psychological\nquestions about the nature of human motivation, so it\u2019s not\nsurprise that psychologists have done a great deal of empirical\nresearch aimed at determining which view is correct. Some of the most\ninfluential and philosophically sophisticated empirical work on this\nissue has been done by Daniel Batson and his associates. The\nconclusion Batson draws from this work is that people do\nsometimes behave altruistically, and that the emotion of empathy plays\nan important role in generating altruistic motivation.\n [17]\n Others are not convinced. For a discussion of Batson\u2019s\nexperiments, the conclusion he draws from them, and some reasons for\nskepticism about that conclusion, see sections 5 and 6 of the entry\n\u201cEmpirical Approaches to Altruism\u201d in this encyclopedia.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll focus on some of the philosophical\nspadework that is necessary before plunging into the empirical\nliterature.\n\nA crucial question that needs to be addressed is: What, exactly, is\nthe debate about; what is altruism? Unfortunately, there is\nno uncontroversial answer to this question, since researchers in many\ndisciplines, including philosophy, biology, psychology, sociology,\neconomics, anthropology and primatology, have written about altruism,\nand authors in different disciplines tend to use the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d in quite different ways. Even among\nphilosophers the term has been used with importantly different\nmeanings. There is, however, one account of altruism\u2014actually a\ncluster closely related accounts\u2014that plays a central role both\nin philosophy and in a great deal of psychology, including\nBatson\u2019s work. We\u2019ll call it \u201cthe standard\naccount\u201d. That will be our focus in the remainder of this\n section.[18]\n\nAccording to the standard account, an action is altruistic if it is\nmotivated by an ultimate desire for the well-being of another person.\nThis formulation invites questions about (1) what it is for a behavior\nto be motivated by an ultimate desire, and (2) the\ndistinction between desires that are self-interested and\ndesires that are for the well-being of others.\n\nAlthough the second question will need careful consideration in any\ncomprehensive treatment, a few rough and ready examples of the\ndistinction will suffice\n here.[19]\n Desires to save someone else\u2019s life, to alleviate someone\nelse\u2019s suffering, or to make someone else happy are paradigm\ncases of desires for the well-being of others, while desires to\nexperience pleasure, get rich, and become famous are typical examples\nof self-interested desires. The self-interested desires to experience\npleasure and to avoid pain have played an especially prominent role in\nthe debate, since one version of egoism, often called\nhedonism, maintains that these are our only ultimate\ndesires.\n\nThe first question, regarding ultimate desires, requires a fuller\nexposition; it can be usefully explicated with the help of a familiar\naccount of practical\n reasoning.[20]\n On this account, practical reasoning is a causal process via which a\ndesire and a belief give rise to or sustain another desire. For\nexample, a desire to drink an espresso and a belief that the best\nplace to get an espresso is at the espresso bar on Main Street may\ncause a desire to go to the espresso bar on Main Street. This desire\ncan then join forces with another belief to generate a third desire,\nand so on. Sometimes this process will lead to a desire to perform a\nrelatively simple or \u201cbasic\u201d action, and that desire, in\nturn, will cause the agent to perform the basic action without the\nintervention of any further desires. Desires produced or sustained by\nthis process of practical reasoning are instrumental\ndesires\u2014the agent has them because she thinks that satisfying\nthem will lead to something else that she desires. But not\nall desires can be instrumental desires. If we are to avoid\ncircularity or an infinite regress there must be some desires that are\nnot produced because the agent thinks that satisfying them\nwill facilitate satisfying some other desire. These desires that are\nnot produced or sustained by practical reasoning are the agent\u2019s\nultimate desires, and the objects of ultimate desires, the\nstates of affairs desired, are desired for their own sake. A behavior\nis motivated by a specific ultimate desire when that desire\nis part of the practical reasoning process that leads to the\nbehavior.\n\nIf people do sometimes have ultimate desires for the well-being of\nothers, and these desires motivate behavior, then altruism is the\ncorrect view, and egoism is false. However, if all ultimate\ndesires are self-interested, then egoism is the correct view, and\naltruism is false. The effort to establish one or the other of these\noptions has given rise to a vast and enormously sophisticated\nempirical literature. For an overview of that literature, see the\n empirical approaches to altruism entry.\n",
