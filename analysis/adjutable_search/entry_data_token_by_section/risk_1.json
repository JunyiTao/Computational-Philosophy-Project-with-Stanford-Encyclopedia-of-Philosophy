    "main_text": "Epistemology\n2. Epistemology\n\nWhen there is a risk, there must be something that is unknown or has\nan unknown outcome. Therefore, knowledge about risk is knowledge about\nlack of knowledge. This combination of knowledge and lack thereof\ncontributes to making issues of risk complicated from an\nepistemological point of view.\n\nIn non-regimented usage, \u201crisk\u201d and\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d differ along the subjective\u2014objective\ndimension. Whereas \u201cuncertainty\u201d seems to belong to the\nsubjective realm, \u201crisk\u201d has a strong objective component.\nIf a person does not know whether or not the grass snake is poisonous,\nthen she is in a state of uncertainty with respect to its ability to\npoison her. However, since this species has no poison there is no risk\nto be poisoned by it. The relationship between the two concepts\n\u201crisk\u201d and \u201cuncertainty\u201d seems to be in part\nanalogous to that between \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cbelief\u201d.\n\nRegimented decision-theoretical usage differs from this. In decision\ntheory, a decision is said to be made \u201cunder risk\u201d if the\nrelevant probabilities are available and \u201cunder\nuncertainty\u201d if they are unavailable or only partially\navailable. Partially determined probabilities are sometimes expressed\nwith probability intervals, e.g., \u201cthe probability of rain\ntomorrow is between 0.1 and 0.4\u201d. (The term \u201cdecision\nunder ignorance\u201d is sometimes used about the case when no\nprobabilistic information at all is available.) \n\nAlthough this distinction between risk and uncertainty is\ndecision-theoretically useful, from an epistemological point of view\nit is in need of clarification. Only very rarely are probabilities\nknown with certainty. Strictly speaking, the only clear-cut cases of\n\u201crisk\u201d (known probabilities) seem to be idealized textbook\ncases that refer to devices such as dice or coins that are supposed to\nbe known with certainty to be fair. In real-life situations, even if\nwe act upon a determinate probability estimate, we are not fully\ncertain that this estimate is exactly correct, hence there is\nuncertainty. It follows that almost all decisions are made\n\u201cunder uncertainty\u201d. If a decision problem is treated as a\ndecision \u201cunder risk\u201d, then this does not mean that the\ndecision in question is made under conditions of completely known\nprobabilities. Rather, it means that a choice has been made to\nsimplify the description of this decision problem by treating it as a\ncase of known probabilities. This is often a highly useful\nidealization in decision theory. However, in practical applications it\nis important to distinguish between those probabilities that can be\ntreated as known and those that are uncertain and therefore much more\nin need of continuous updating. Typical examples of the former are the\nfailure frequencies of a technical component that are inferred from\nextensive and well-documented experience of its use. The latter case\nis exemplified by experts\u2019 estimates of the expected failure\nfrequencies of a new type of component.\n\nA major problem in the epistemology of risk is how to deal with the\nlimitations that characterize our knowledge of the behaviour of unique\ncomplex systems that are essential for estimates of risk, such as the\nclimate system, ecosystems, the world economy, etc. Each of these\nsystems contains so many components and potential interactions that\nimportant aspects of it are unpredictable. However, in spite of this\nuncertainty, reasonably reliable statements about many aspects of\nthese systems can be made. Anthropogenic climate change is an example\nof this. Although many details are unknown, the general picture is\nclear, and there is no reasonable doubt about the existence of\nanthropogenic climate change, about its major causes and mechanisms,\nor the overall nature of the risks that it creates for our societies\n(Mayer et al. 2017; Lewandowsky et al. 2018). The epistemological\nstatus of such partial knowledge about complex systems, and the nature\nof the uncertainty involved, are still in need of further\nclarification (McKinney 1996, Shrader-Frechette 1997).\n\nIn the risk sciences, it is common to distinguish between\n\u201cobjective risk\u201d and \u201csubjective risk\u201d. The\nformer concept is in principle fairly unproblematic since it refers to\na frequentist interpretation of probability. The latter concept is\nmore ambiguous. In the psychometric literature on risk from the 1970s,\nsubjective risk was often conceived as a subjective estimate of\nobjective risk. In more recent literature, a more complex picture has\nemerged. Subjective appraisals of (the severity of) risk depend to a\nlarge extent on factors that are not covered in traditional measures\nof objective risk, such as control and tampering with nature. If the\nterms are taken in this sense, subjective risk is influenced by the\nsubjective estimate of objective risk, but cannot be identified with\nit. In the psychological literature, subjective risk is often\nconceived as the individual\u2019s overall assessment of the\nseriousness of a danger or alleged danger. Such individual assessments\nare commonly called \u201crisk perception\u201d, but strictly\nspeaking the term is misleading. This is not a matter of perception,\nbut rather a matter of attitudes and expectations. Subjective risk can\nbe studied with methods of attitude measurement and psychological\nscaling (Sj\u00f6berg 2004).\n\nThe probabilistic approach to risk dominates in philosophy as well as\nin other disciplines, but some philosophers have investigated an\nalternative, modal account of risk. According to this account,\n\u201c[t]o say that a target event is risky is to say that (keeping\nrelevant initial conditions for that event fixed) it obtains in close\npossible worlds\u201d (Pritchard 2016, 562). The risk is smaller, the\nmore distant the nearest possible world is in which the target event\ntakes place. This approach has interesting connections with\npsychological accounts of risk, but it is far from clear how distance\nbetween possible worlds should be defined and determined.\n",
