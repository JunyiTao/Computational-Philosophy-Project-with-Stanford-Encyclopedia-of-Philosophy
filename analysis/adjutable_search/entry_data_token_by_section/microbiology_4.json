Microbiological Science\n\n\nMicrobiology of the future will become the primary biological science,\nthe base upon which our future understanding of the living world\nrests, and the font from which new understanding of it flows. (from\njournal summary of Woese\n 1994[6])\n\n\nAlthough it can be argued that microbiology began with microscopy in\nthe early seventeenth century (e.g., Gest 2004; Lane 2015), the\ndisciplinary starting point for bacteriology and eventually\nmicrobiology is usually bestowed on its experimental turn a couple of\ncenturies later (Bulloch 1938). Early microscopy allowed observational\nmicrobiology for sure, but it gave rise to limited classification, and\neven more limited insights into what microbes could do consistently.\nThe second half of the nineteenth century is when experimentation on\nmicrobes was codified, with the aim of understanding the specific and\nstable effects of particular microorganisms on disease in animals and\nplants. A central part of this emerging tradition involved pure\nculture techniques, Koch\u2019s postulates, and germ theory. Each of\nthese has ongoing philosophical ramifications.\n\nMedicine changed fundamentally in the later part of the nineteenth\ncentury, and many historians of medicine locate the scrutiny of\nmicroorganisms via experimental laboratory methods at the heart of\nthis transformation (e.g., Worboys 2000; Kreuder-Sonnen 2016). Pure\nculture, in which isolated and putatively causal microorganisms are\ngrown in laboratories, was the first step. Normally, bacteria and\nother microbes live in complex multispecies communities. Such\ncommunities, however, are useless for identifying and intervening on\nthe causes of diseases. Various innovations of nineteenth-century\nlaboratory science (glassware, growth media, identification methods,\nmicrography) enabled verifiable pure cultures of single species to be\ngrown independently of their host organisms. Such cultures in turn\nallowed Koch\u2019s postulates for causality to be implemented.\n\nKoch\u2019s postulates are a general method to identify causal\noutcomes from specific bacteria. Microorganisms isolated and grown\nfrom diseased hosts are introduced to non-diseased hosts to see if the\nsame disease obtains. Cultures from that new disease site then confirm\nthe presence and activity of the suspect microbe (Ross & Woodward\n2016; Gillies 2016). Once it could be established that these causal\neffects are highly specific and stable, the germ theory of disease\ncould then draw all such findings into one common framework with\npredictive power (e.g., tuberculosis will always be caused by a\nparticular bacterium, then known as the tubercle bacillus). The\nsystematicity and experimentality underlying germ theory thus began\nthe transformation of medicine from a purely observational and often\nanecdotal activity to an increasingly experimental and scientifically\nrobust programme of research that had therapeutic and preventive\nsuccesses (Worboys 2000; Vernon 1990). As a consequence, the\ninvestigation of bacteria and other microbes was integrated into a\nrange of established disciplines in universities, hospitals and\nindependent institutions (including industry) from the late nineteenth\ncentury onwards (Vernon 1990).\n\nThis tendency of microbiology to pervade and transform other fields is\na hallmark of the science\u2019s development. Molecular microbiology,\na product of the mid-twentieth century, amply illustrates this trend.\nFollowing the successes of germ-theoretic accounts of microbes and\ndisease, microbial biochemistry flourished as microbiologists focused\non the precise causal pathways by which microbes achieved their\neffects (whether in hosts or other environments). The laboratory\ntractability of microbes and versatility of their metabolic\naccomplishments gave rise to a vast experimental literature on\nbacterial biochemistry (e.g., Kluyver 1936; Stephenson 1939). In the\n1940s, this background lent itself to the emerging field of what\nbecame molecular biology, in which all the initial major discoveries\nwere made in microbial systems. The bacterium Escherichia\ncoli (E. coli) in particular had epistemic\n\n\nprimacy in forging our picture of the fundamentals of life\u2014the\nphysical and chemical underpinnings of gene structure, replication,\nand expression \u2026 [these and other] prokaryotes gave us the\nlanguage and much of the knowledge of molecular biology relevant to\nall organisms to this day. (Davis 2003: 154; see also Brock 1990)\n\n\nThe very identification of DNA as the material of heredity was carried\nout in bacterial and viral experimental systems (Avery et al.\n1943; Hershey & Chase\n1952). Subsequently, the expansion of molecular biology into genome\nsequencing and metagenomics (the sequencing and analysis of whole\ncommunity genomes) began and flourished in microorganisms. This\nbroader molecular scope enabled not only methodological and\ntechnological advances (see\n SEP entry on genomics and postgenomics),\n but also major evolutionary and ecological insights into the\nevolutionary history and community dynamics of large swathes of the\nbiosphere (Davis 2003; Handelsman 2004). Most new empirical insights\ninto major evolutionary transitions (as discussed in\n Subsection 2.2.3)\n are based on these genomic and metagenomic microbial\ninvestigations.\n\nBoth in the early and later developments of molecular biology,\nmicrobes functioned in many respects as general molecular models for\nbiological insight and technological development. The very fact that\nmicrobes can play this stand-in role for life in general drove many\nsuccesses in the field. However, it might be a concern that microbes\nare useful only for what they tell researchers about microbial life,\nand that the knowledge generated by microbiological investigations\nwill always be restricted to aspects of microbial biology. For\ninstance, gene regulation in the form of operons (modules of genes\ntreated as genetic regulatory units) was discovered in the bacterium\nE. coli, as well as in one of their viruses, in the 1950s\n(Jacob & Monod 1961). But although there are now known to be many\nimportant differences between bacterial and eukaryotic gene\nregulation, and different modes of gene regulation within just\nbacteria (Beckwith 2011), the E. coli operon model launched a\nwhole field of investigation driven by general expectations about how\ngene expression could be effectively controlled (Brenner et al. 1990).\nUltimately, eukaryotic gene regulation had to be studied in tractable\nmulticellular organisms in order to ascertain the additional\ncomplexities and differences of eukaryote gene regulation from the\nbacterial model.\n",
