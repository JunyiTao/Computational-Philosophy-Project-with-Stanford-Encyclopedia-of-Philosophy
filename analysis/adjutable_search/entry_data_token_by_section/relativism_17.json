Epistemic relativism is the thesis that cognitive norms that determine what counts as knowledge, or whether a belief is rational, justifiable, etc. could vary with and are dependent on local conceptual or cultural frameworks and lack the universality they aspire or pretend to. The three key assumptions underlying epistemic relativism are:\n\n(a)\nEpistemic justification is framework relative. It makes no sense to ask whether a belief is justified simpliciter; we can only ask questions about justification relative to an epistemic system, which casts doubts on the very possibility of objectivity.\n(b)\nThere are many genuinely alternative, even incompatible, epistemic systems.\n(c)\nWe cannot demonstrate in a non-circular way that our epistemic system is superior to any other. (see Williams 2007: 94 for one version of this approach to epistemic relativism; cf. Carter 2015)\n\nThe epistemic relativist, as Paul Boghossian in developing his trenchant criticisms of relativism points out, is committed to a \u201cdoctrine of equal validity\u201d, the view that \u201cthere are many radically different, incompatible, yet, \u2018equally valid\u2019 ways of knowing the world, with science being just one of them\u201d (Boghossian 2006a: 2). The relativist\u2019s key claim is that either we can chauvinistically maintain that our epistemic system is superior to all or accept the equal legitimacy of varying epistemic systems.\nOne crucial question facing epistemic relativism is how to identify and individuate alternative epistemic systems. The intuitive idea is that varying and possibly incompatible cognitive principles, ground-level beliefs and presuppositions, or what Wittgenstein calls \u201chinge\u201d and \u201cbedrock\u201d propositions (Wittgenstein 1969: \u00a7\u00a7341\u2013343) separate non-convergent epistemic schemes. A simple and quite commonly used example is the contrast between scientific and religious belief systems. Boghossian, for instance, uses the debate between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine as a case study of an encounter between antagonists operating within putatively different epistemic frameworks, who use different frameworks, or as Rorty (1979) put it \u201cgrids\u201d, for determining what would count as appropriate evidence on planetary movements. The relativist claims that there is no fact of the matter about whether the Copernican theory or the geocentric view is justified by the evidence, \u201cfor there are no absolute facts about what justifies what\u201d (Boghossian 2006a: 62) while the anti-relativist attempts to show the unintelligibility or the implausibility of such a claim.\nBoghossian has been criticized however for his characterization of epistemic relativism. One notable such criticism has been advanced by Crispin Wright (2008), who takes issue with Boghossian\u2019s attributing to the epistemic relativist a version of (a) above, what Boghossian calls epistemic relationism, or the thesis that any claim of the form \u201cEvidence E justifies belief B\u201d, if it is to have any prospect of being true, must be construed as expressing the claim According to the epistemic system C, that I, S accept, information E justifies belief B (Boghossian 2006a:73). Having characterized the relativist\u2019s position in this fashion, Boghossian suggests\u2014after considering various ways of articulating what the relativist might say about the untruth of claims of the form \u201cEvidence E justifies belief B\u201d\u2014that the relativist is left, ultimately, with no coherent way to account for how she should count as accepting or adhering to a given epistemic system. And on this basis, Boghossian concludes that there is no coherent way to formulate the position because the relativist in formulating his position and setting up the opposition between two or more alternative non-convergent epistemic systems cannot but assume the universality of at least some epistemic principles, including deduction, induction, warrant through empirical evidence, etc. (see Boghossian 2006a).\nAs Wright sees it, however, Boghossian\u2019s attributing the relationist clause to the epistemic relativist is to simply\n\nfail to take seriously the thesis that claims such as [Evidence E justifies belief B] can indeed by true or false, albeit only relatively so. (Wright 2008: 383, our italics)\n\nMoreover, Wright argues, the epistemic relationist clause Boghossian includes in the kind of epistemic relativism he challenges betrays a failure to distinguish between (i) making a judgment in the light of certain standards and (ii) judging that those standards mandate that judgment. (See also MacFarlane (2008b and Carter & McKenna forthcoming for different critiques of Boghossian\u2019s argument against the epistemic relativist.)\nConceptions of rationality, and its key components of logic and justification, are some of the principles that are often used to differentiate between epistemic systems. Below we look at attempts at relativizing each.\n4.4.1 Relativism about Rationality\nEarlier defenses of epistemic relativism centered on the idea of alternative rationalities and were often developed as a reaction to the charge of irrationality leveled at non-Western tribal people. Rationality traditionally is seen as a cognitive virtue as well as a hallmark of the scientific method. The complex notion of rationality is intimately tied to requirements of consistency, justification, warrant and evidence for beliefs. Relativists about rationality cast doubt on the universal applicability of one or more of these features of rational thought, and deem them merely local epistemic values. Peter Winch\u2019s treatment of E.E. Evans-Pritchard\u2019s account of the Azande tribe\u2019s beliefs in witchcraft and magic is now a classic of the \u201crationality wars\u201d of the 1960s and 70s. Winch had argued that since standards of rationality in different societies do not always coincide, we should use only contextually and internally given criteria of rationality in our assessment of the systems of belief of other cultures and societies. Under the influence of the later Wittgenstein, he maintained that it does not make sense to speak of a universal standard of rationality because what is rational is decided by a backdrop of norms governing a given language and form of life. As outside observers, we are not in a position to impute irrationality or illogicality to the Azande or any other group whose practices and language-games may differ from ours. Critics of Winch, Steven Lukes, for instance, using considerations reminiscent of Davidson\u2019s principle of charity, have argued that we will not be in a position to understand a language or culture with standards of rationality radically different from ours, and that we must have at least some core principles, or what Martin Hollis had called a \u201cbridgehead\u201d with elements such as consistency and the goal of truth, in common with the Azande in order to understand them (Hollis 1968; Lukes 1970). They, thereby, conclude that an all-out or strong relativism about rationality is not tenable. The weaker claim is that some elements of rationality, for instance what counts as good evidence or a better style of reasoning, could vary with historic conditions and traditions of enquiry and therefore a degree of relativization of such norms, without succumbing to irrationalism, is acceptable (see Hacking 1982 and MacIntyre 1988).\nBeing rational also means having warrant, in the form of good reasons and justification for one\u2019s beliefs. Epistemic relativists maintain that the legitimacy of a justificatory system and the presumed strength of epistemic warrants are decided locally. Richard Rorty has made the influential claim that\n\nthere is nothing to be said about either truth or rationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of justification which a given society\u2014ours\u2014uses in one or another area of inquiry. (Rorty 1991: 23)\n\nFor Rorty, warrant is a \u201csociological matter, to be ascertained by observing the reception of [a speaker\u2019s] statement by her peers\u201d (1993: 449). Rorty also claims that knowledge and truth are compliments \u201cpaid to beliefs which we think so well justified that, for the moment, further justification is not needed\u201d (Rorty 1991: 24) where the \u201cwe\u201d is a historically conditioned community of enquirers. Rorty rejects the label \u201crelativist\u201d because he insists that, unlike the relativists, he does not subscribe to the view that all beliefs are equally true or good. He calls his position \u201cethnocentrism\u201d, because the only form of warrant available to any of us is the one provided through solidarity with our peers. His rejection of the label \u201crelativist\u201d has had little effect on critics such as Hilary Putnam (1999) or Paul Boghossian (2006a) who do not see the distinction Rorty wishes to draw between his brand of ethnocentrism and relativism\n4.4.2 Relativism about Logic\nDebates about the scope and authority of logic are also focal to discussions of rationality. The argument for relativism about logic is usually traced to the French anthropologist Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl (1857\u20131939) who claimed that tribal or \u201cprimitive\u201d cultures did not subscribe to universal laws of logic such as the principles of non-contradiction and identity and were in a pre-logical stage of thinking (L\u00e9vy-Bruhl 1922/1923). In a posthumous publication, L\u00e9vy-Bruhl renounced his earlier views, finding them \u201csimplistic and rather crude\u201d (L\u00e9vy-Bruhl 1949/1975: 48) but he remains the standard bearer for relativism about logic.\nPeter Winch\u2019s interpretation of the Azande material became the impetus for a new wave of arguments for relativism about logic. Barry Barnes and David Bloor, for instance, have argued that different societies may have incompatible but internally coherent systems of logic because validity and rules of inference are defined by, and hence are relative to, the practices of a given community, rather than a priori universal restrictions on all thought. According to Bloor,\n\nThe Azande have the same psychology as us but radically different institutions. If we relate logic to the psychology of reasoning we shall be inclined to say that they have the same logic; if we relate logic more closely to the institutional framework of thought then we shall incline to the view that the two cultures have different logics. (Bloor 1976: 129\u2013130)\n\nEven the status of \u201ccontradictions\u201d is at times seen as culturally relative and the Azande\u2019s application of witchcraft in determining guilt is cited as an example. The Azande, according to Evans-Prichard, believe that it is possible to identify a witch by examining the contents of his intestine (through the use of a poison oracle). They also believe that Witchhood is inherited patrilineally. Since the Azande clan members are related to each other through the male line, it follows that if one person is shown to be a witch, then all the members of his clan must also be witches. Evans-Pritchard tells us that although the Azande see the sense of this argument they do not accept the conclusion; they seem to side-step the contradiction in their belief-system. Relativistically inclined commentators have argued that the Azande both do and do not contradict themselves depending on, or relative to, the culture that is being taken as the vantage point (Bloor 1976: 124 and Jennings 1989: 281). See Seidel (2014) for a sustained critique.\nMore recently, Peng and Nisbett, using experimental data, have argued that Chinese and American students have different attitudes towards the Law of Non-Contradiction. The Chinese, they claim, are more willing to accept that conflicting views may be compatible and therefore are less disposed to recognize or condemn contradictions (Peng & Nisbett 1999). In his The Geography of Thought (2003), Nisbett has generalized his results to claim that Asian and European structures of thinking, including perception and conceptualization, differ significantly.\nNisbitt\u2019s data, as well as the claims by Barnes and Bloor, are contributions to a long-standing debate about the status of logic. Their approach attempts to naturalize logic by tying it to actual practices of the human subjects. The relativistically inclined, however, argue that to think of logic as singular, a priori, and universal speaks of a philosophical prejudice and does not sit well with a naturalistic and scientific attitude. As to the claim by Quine and Davidson, that an allegedly illogical culture is in fact a misinterpreted or badly interpreted culture\u2014that if the speakers of a language seem to accept sentence of the form \u201cP and not-P\u201d, this is conclusive evidence that \u201cand\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d in their language do not mean what these words mean in English (Quine 1960)\u2014the relativists and their sympathisers point out that reasoning in deviant ways is quite common and is not an impediment to understanding or translating others (e.g., Stich 2012). They further argue that such diversity is better explained by the relativist\u2019s claim that the correctness of the principles of reasoning is relative to their cultural background rather than by the absolutist approach that attributes wholesale error to alternative epistemic systems or to the members of other cultures.\nA different line of support for relativism about logic starts with pluralism about logic, the view that there can be a multitude of correct but not fully compatible conceptions of logic where differing accounts of logical consequence, logical connectives or even validity are on offer. Relativism ensues if we also assume that there is no neutral framework for adjudicating between the differing accounts. What counts as a correct account of logical consequence and validity or even the choice of logical vocabulary are relative to the system of logic that embed and justify these accounts and choices. (See Steinberger 2019 for a useful survey.)\nStewart Shapiro (2014) is probably the most vocal defender of this approach. His argument for relativism about logic is similar to defences of relativism in other areas where intractable differences in a particular domain and an inability to reconcile them are used as the motivators for relativism. Shapiro advocates what, following Crispin Wright, he calls \u201cfolk-relativism\u201d and its slogan that \u201cThere is no such thing as simply being \u03a6\u201d (Shapiro, 2014: 7; Wright 2008a: 158) and applies it to validity and logical consequence. The claim is that there are different conceptions of logical consequence. in classical and non-classical logic, which although not compatible can still capture correct accounts of the idea of logical consequence. Therefore, it does not make sense to think that there is a uniquely correct conception of validity and logical consequence. Different conceptions can be legitimate in so far as each is (internally) consistent and also non-trivial in the sense that it is the basis a workable mathematical systems, i.e., the means of making sense of \u201cthe practice of pursuing and applying mathematics\u201d (Shapiro 2014: 81). Intuitionism and fuzzy logic are notable examples. Choices between different logical vocabularies also can lead to a relativized conception of logic in so far a these vocabularies play a decisive role in generating different relations of logical consequence.\nFor further discussion, see the entry on logical pluralism.\n4.4.3 Relativism about Science\nDiscussions of relativism about science gained currency with the publication of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) and the emergence of a historicist approach to question of change and progress in science. Pronouncements such as\n\nIn so far as their only recourse to [the] world is through what they see and do, we may want to say that after a revolution scientists are responding to a different world (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 111)\n\nand\n\nThe very ease and rapidity with which astronomers saw new things when looking at old objects with old instruments may make us wish to say that, after Copernicus, astronomers lived in a different world (Kuhn 1970 [1962]: 117)\n\nwere taken to suggest that not only standards of epistemic appraisal but even the data gathered by scientists were, to a significant extent, determined by governing paradigms and hence relative to them. Although Kuhn stepped back from such radical relativism, his views gave currency to relativistic interpretations of science (though see Sankey 2018).\nRelativism about science is motivated by considerations arising from the methodology and history of science (Baghramian 2007). As we saw in \u00a74.2, Quine has argued that\n\nPhysical theories can be at odds with each other and yet compatible with all possible data even in the broadest possible sense. In a word, they can be logically incompatible and empirically equivalent. (1970: 179)\n\nRelativists about science have argued that only with the addition of auxiliary hypotheses could the scientist choose between various theories and that such auxiliary hypotheses are colored by socially and historically grounded norms as well as by personal and group interests. Paul Feyerabend\u2019s \u201cdemocratic relativism\u201d\u2014the view that different societies may look at the world in different ways and regard different things as acceptable (1987: 59) and that we need to give equal voice to these differing perspectives\u2014is one instance of the use of the underdetermination thesis in support of relativism. According to Feyerabend, underdetermination ultimately demonstrates that\n\nfor every statement, theory, point of view believed (to be true) with good reason there exist arguments showing a conflicting alternative to be at least as good, or even better. (1987: 76)\n\nLarry Laudan usefully lists the ways underdetermination is used to motivate relativism or its proximate doctrines. He says:\n\nLakatos and Feyerabend have taken the underdetermination of theories to justify the claim that the only difference between empirically successful and empirically unsuccessful theories lies in the talents and resources of their respective advocates (i.e., with sufficient ingenuity, more or less any theory can be made to look methodologically respectable). Hesse and Bloor have claimed that underdetermination shows the necessity for bringing noncognitive, social factors into play in explaining the theory choices of scientists (on the grounds that methodological and evidential considerations alone are demonstrably insufficient to account for such choices). H. M. Collins, and several of his fellow sociologists of knowledge, have asserted that underdetermination lends credence to the view that the world does little if anything to shape or constrain our beliefs about it. (Laudan 1990: 321)\n\nLaudan even connects Derrida\u2019s deconstructionism and the view that texts do not lend themselves to determinate readings with underdetermination (ibid.). He also believes that an appropriately modest understanding of what underdetermination entails will distance it from relativism, but most relativistically inclined advocates of underdetermination are not willing to follow Laudan\u2019s advice to circumscribe its scope. The key issue is that both the relativists and the anti-relativists could agree that the totality of evidence available does not prove the truth of any given theory. But the anti-relativists responds to this fact of underdetermination by pointing out that the we have good reasons for embracing the best theory available and moreover that there are indeed objective facts about the world, even if we are not in possession of them. The relativist, in contrast, argues that there are many, equally acceptable principles for accepting theories, all on the basis of evidence available, but such theories could result in very different verdicts. They also argue that in the absence of any strong epistemic grounds for accepting the existence of absolute facts in any given domain, we have no grounds, other than some kind of metaphysical faith, for thinking that there are such facts.\nRelativism about science is also influenced by the related doctrine that all observations are theory-laden. Even anti-relativists such as Karl Popper admit that the idea that observations are not in some way tinted by theoretical assumptions is na\u00efve. But some relativists about science offer a particularly extreme form of the doctrine of the widely accepted thesis of theory-ladenness. Feyerabend, for instance, goes so far as to argue that different systems of classification can result in perceptual objects that are not easily comparable.\nRelativists about science also point to the prevalence of both synchronic and diachronic disagreement among scientists as a justification of their view. Looking at the history of science, Kuhn and his followers argued that Aristotelian physics presupposes a totally different conception of the universe compared to Newtonian physics; the same is true of Einsteinian physics compared to its predecessors. Moreover, these differing conceptions may be incommensurable in the sense that they are not readily amenable to comparison or inter-theoretical translation. There are also strong and unresolved disagreements between scientists working contemporaneously. The many different interpretations of quantum mechanics are a case in point.\nAnti-relativist philosophers of science are often willing to concede all three points above, but insist that they do not, singly or jointly, justify the claim that scientific knowledge, in any philosophically interesting sense, is relative to its context of production. The success of science, both theoretical and applied, indicates that progress does take place. Fallibilism, the view that all scientific claims are provisional and liable to fail, they argue, is sufficient for dealing with difficulties arising from considerations of underdetermination and theory-ladenness of observations. Relativism, with its attendant denial that there could be objective and universal scientific truths or knowledge exacts too high a price for dealing with these allegedly troublesome features of the methodology and history of science.\n4.4.4 Social Constructionism\nSocial constructionism is a particularly radical form of conceptual relativism with implications for our understanding of the methodology and subject matter of the sciences. According to social constructionism, nature as studied by scientists does not come carved at its joints (to use Plato\u2019s metaphor from Phaedrus: 265d\u2013266a). Reality\u2014with its objects, entities, properties and categories\u2014is not simply \u201cout there\u201d to be discovered only by empirical investigation or observation; rather, it is constructed through a variety of norm-governed socially sanctioned cognitive activities such as interpretation, description, manipulation of data, etc. Social constructionism has relativistic consequences insofar as it claims that different social forces lead to the construction of different \u201cworlds\u201d and that there is no neutral ground for adjudicating between them. The \u201cScience Studies\u201d approach of Bruno Latour is a prime example of constructionism with relativistic consequences. Latour and Woolgar (1986) have argued that so-called \u201cscientific facts\u201d and the \u201ctruths\u201d of science emerge out of social and conceptual practices and inevitably bear their imprints. This is because the very idea of a mind-independent reality open to scientific study, or as they call it \u201cout-there-ness\u201d, itself is the consequence of scientific work rather than the cause. A crucial difference between scientific realists and constructionists is that whereas the realists see nature and society as the causes that explain the outcomes of scientific enquiry, for the constructionists the activity of\n\nscientists and engineers and of all their human and non-human allies is the cause, of which various states of nature and societies are the consequence. (Callon & Latour 1992: 350\u20131)\n\nScientific theories are also products of socially constituted practices. They are\n\ncontextually specific constructions which bear the mark of the situated contingency and interest structure of the process by which they are generated. (Knorr-Cetina 1981: 226)\n\nSo called \u201cscientific facts\u201d and \u201cnatural kinds\u201d, the primary subjects of scientific investigation are, at least in part, the products of the contingent social and epistemic norms that define the very subject matter of science. It may be argued that the view, if taken literally, entails a counter-intuitive form of backward causation to the effect that, for instance, the scientific facts about dinosaur anatomy 50 million years ago were caused in the 20th century when a scientific consensus about dinosaur anatomy was formed (see Boghossian 2006a). But constructionism, at least in its most extreme form, accepts this consequence, insisting that there are indeed no facts except for socially constructed ones, created and modified at particular times and places courtesy of prevailing theoretical and conceptual frameworks.\n4.5 Moral Relativism\nMoral or ethical relativism is simultaneously the most influential and the most reviled of all relativistic positions. Supporters see it as a harbinger of tolerance (see \u00a72.6), open-mindedness and anti-authoritarianism. Detractors think it undermines the very possibility of ethics and signals either confused thinking or moral turpitude.\nBriefly stated, moral relativism is the view that moral judgments, beliefs about right and wrong, good and bad, not only vary greatly across time and contexts, but that their correctness is dependent on or relative to individual or cultural perspectives and frameworks. Moral subjectivism is the view that moral judgments are judgments about contingent and variable features of our moral sensibilities. For the subjectivist, to say that abortion is wrong is to say something like, \u201cI disapprove of abortion\u201d, or \u201cAround here, we disapprove of abortion\u201d. Once the content of the subjectivist\u2019s claim is made explicit, the truth or acceptability of a subjectivist moral judgment is no longer a relative matter. Moral relativism proper, on the other hand, is the claim that facts about right and wrong vary with and are dependent on social and cultural background. Understood in this way, moral relativism could be seen as a sub-division of cultural relativism. Values may also be relativized to frameworks of assessment, independent of specific cultures or social settings.\nMoral relativism, like most relativistic positions, comes in various forms and strengths. It is customary to distinguish between descriptive or empirical, prescriptive or normative, and meta-ethical versions of moral relativism. These views in turn are motivated by a number of empirical and philosophical considerations similar to those introduced in defense of cultural relativism. The purported fact of ethical diversity, the claim that there are no universally agreed moral norms or values, conjoined with the intractability of the arguments about them, are the core components of descriptive moral relativism. The anti-relativists counter-argue that the observed diversity and lack of convergence in local norms can in fact be explained by some very general universal norms, which combine with the different circumstances (or false empirical beliefs) of the different groups to entail different particular norms. The objectivist thereby can accommodate diversity and lack of agreement at this higher level of generalization (see Philippa Foot (1982) for this type of argument).\nAs in the case of cultural relativism, the imperative of tolerance is often seen as a normative reason for adopting moral relativism. Moral relativism, it is argued, leads to tolerance by making us not only more open-minded but also alerting us to the limitations of our own views. Edward Westermarck, for instance, in his early classic defense of relativism writes:\n\nCould it be brought home to people that there is no absolute standard in morality, they would perhaps be on the one hand more tolerant and on the other more critical in their judgments. (Westermarck 1932: 59)\n\nCritics however point out that for the consistent relativist tolerance can be only a framework-dependent virtue, while Westermarck, and others, seem to recommend it as a universal desideratum. A second problem with arguing for normative moral relativism on the grounds of tolerance is known as the Argumentum ad Nazium. Relativists, as this argument goes, are not in a position to condemn even the most abhorrent of worldviews as they are forced to admit that every point of view is right (relative to the perspective of its beholder). W.T. Stace, arguing against Westermarck\u2019s relativism gives an early example of this type of criticism:\n\nCertainly, if we believe that any one moral standard is as good as any other, we are likely to be more tolerant. We shall tolerate widow-burning, human sacrifice, cannibalism, slavery, the infliction of physical torture, or any other of the thousand and one abominations which are, or have been, from time approved by moral code or another. But this is not the kind of toleration that we want, and I do not think its cultivation will prove \u201can advantage to morality\u201d. (Stace 1937: 58\u201359)\n\nMore moderate forms of normative moral relativism, positions that sometimes are characterized as moral pluralism, have been defended by David Wong (2006) and David Velleman (2013). Moderate moral relativists endorse the idea of diversity and plurality of ethical values and accept that such values are justified according to differing local normative frameworks, but they avoid a full blown \u201canything goes\u201d relativism by maintaining that all such frameworks are ultimately answerable to conditions for human flourishing and other overarching universal constraints such as the value of accommodation (Wong 2006). (It should however be noted that while theses under the description of pluralism needn\u2019t entail a commitment to relativism, some formulations of relativism (such as Boghossian\u2019s 2006b), include, as an essential ingredient, a \u201cpluralist\u201d clause. Whether particular instances of moral pluralism entail moral relativism depends entirely on the details of relevant claim to pluralism).\nMetaethical versions of moral relativism are often motivated by the thought that ethical positions, unlike scientific beliefs, are not apt for objective truth-evaluation. Strong realists about science such as Gilbert Harman have argued that the intractability of moral disagreements, the absence of convergence in ethics as opposed to the natural sciences and mathematics, point to fundamental differences between natural facts and ethical values (Harman & Thompson 1996). This is a metaethical, rather than a descriptive or normative position, because it is a theory about the nature of ethics or morality. The ethical domain, Harman argue, is such that all relevant evaluations could be undertaken only in the context of social norms or personal preferences and commitments. Values are not objective\u2014they are not part of the fabric of the universe. Rather they always arise from some form of convention and agreement among people. Therefore, there can be no objective or externally justified ethical knowledge or judgment (Harman 1975). In this sense, metaethical relativism shares common concerns with non-cognitivist approaches to ethics. What distinguishes it, however, is the insistence on the part of metaethical relativists that moral judgments contain an implicit relativization to the speaker\u2019s moral outlook (Dreier 2006: 261). It is possible to talk about the truth or falsity of a moral judgment but only in the context of pre-existing standards or value systems. For instance, we can ask questions about just actions or judgments in the context of standards of justice prevalent in a society at a given time; but questions about the objective standing of these standards do not make sense (cf., Boghossian 2017). (For further discussion of moral relativism see the separate entry on this topic. What has become known as New Moral Relativism will be discussed below).\n5. New Relativism\nThere is a recent version of relativism according to which some of the views considered so far\u2014for instance, Harman\u2019s (1975) variety of moral relativism\u2014will be regarded varieties of contextualism as opposed to bona fide relativism. This recent version\u2014sufficiently distinct from the relativisms so far considered that it is deserving of attention in its own right\u2014we are calling \u201cNew Relativism\u201d, a variety of relativism that has arisen out of work in the philosophy of language in the analytic tradition, and for which the leading proponents have included Max K\u00f6lbel (2003, 2004), Peter Lasersohn (2005), Crispin Wright (2006) and, in particular, John MacFarlane (2005b, 2007, 2014); cf., Marques (2019). In this section we aim to (i) outline several features that individuate New Relativism; (ii) consider in turn motivations for (and objections to) several prominent strands of it; and, finally, (iii) conclude with some philosophical problems that face New Relativism more generally.\n5.1 The individuating features of New Relativism\nIt is a commonplace that the truth-value of an utterance can depend on the context in which it is uttered. If you say \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d and I say the same sentence, your utterance may be true and mine false. In such cases, the context of utterance plays a role in determining which proposition the sentence expresses. This can happen even when the sentence does not contain an overtly indexical expression. Thus Harman and Dreier hold that a statement of the form \u201cA is wrong\u201d is roughly equivalent to \u201cA is wrong according to the moral system I accept\u201d. So two utterances of (say) \u201cTorture is wrong\u201d can differ in truth-value if they are uttered by speakers who accept very different moral systems. Contextualists about (for instance) moral, aesthetic and epistemic discourse will view moral, aesthetic and epistemic expressions likewise as indexical expressions but (as we\u2019ll see) with some difficulty explaining apparent genuine disagreement in these areas of discourse. On this point, New Relativists claim an important advantage over contextualists. New relativism, by contrast with contextualism, aims to achieve this advantage via a much less familiar form of context dependence.\nTruth-relativism with respect to utterances in area of discourse D is the claim that, following MacFarlane\u2019s notable version of the view: the truth of S\u2019s D-utterance u depends (in part) on a context of assessment; that is (and in short) what S asserts, u, gets a truth value\u2014according to the truth-relativist\u2019s D-semantics\u2014only once the D-standard of the assessor is specified. Independent of the specification of such a standard, S\u2019s u assertion lacks a truth-value much as, by comparison, indexical expressions such as \u201cThe barn is nearby\u201d do not get a truth-value independent of contextual facts about the context of use (i.e. the context in which the utterance is made). And, as a further point of clarification here: while the contextualist can, no less than the relativist, recognize a \u201cstandards\u201d or \u201cjudge\u201d parameter, for the contextualist, its value will be supplied by the context of use, whereas the relativist takes it to be supplied completely independently of the context of use, by the context of evaluation (or, as MacFarlane calls it, the context of assessment).\nTo see how this view is claimed to offer a satisfying take on disagreement in types of discourse (see Beddor 2019), consider a simple example, concerning predicates of personal taste. A utters, \u201cPretzels are tasty\u201d, and B utters, \u201cPretzels are not tasty\u201d. While the semantic invariantist (for whom the truth-value of taste predications is in no way context sensitive) will insist that the above exchange constitutes a genuine disagreement about whether pretzels are tasty and that at least one party is wrong, contextualists and truth-relativists have the prima facie advantageous resources to avoid the result that at least one party to the apparent disagreement has made a mistake.\nThe contextualist claims that the truth-evaluable content expressed by A\u2019s utterance encodes A\u2019s standards (cf. non-indexical contextualism). Thus, in this apparent disagreement, the proposition expressed by A is \u201cPretzels are tasty relative to my [A\u2019s] standards\u201d while B expresses the proposition \u201cPretzels are not tasty relative to my [B\u2019s] standards\u201d. This maneuver avoids the result that at least one of the two parties has uttered something false, but (as the new relativist points out) this result comes at the price of being unable to offer a clear explanation of our intuition that there is some uniform content about which A and B disagree.\nThe new relativist, on the other hand, claims to be able to preserve both the apparent subjectivity of taste discourse and (and, unlike the contextualist) our intuition that exchanges of the form mentioned constitute genuine disagreements. They do this by first insisting (unlike the contextualist\u2014though see Suikkanen 2019) that there is a single truth-evaluable proposition which A affirms and B denies. In the case where A says \u201cPretzels are tasty\u201d, and B denies this, there is a uniform content that is affirmed by A\u2019s utterance and denied by B\u2019s, namely the proposition that pretzels are tasty, period. So we have a genuine disagreement. Unlike the truth-absolutist, however, the new relativist will add that the disagreement is faultless because the proposition affirmed in A\u2019s utterance has a truth value only relative to a judge or standards parameter, and in this case: A\u2019s standards, when A is the assessor, B\u2019s standards, when B is the assessor. Hence, the truth-relativist about predicates of personal taste will, by insisting that the truth of Pretzels are tasty depends on the context of assessment, allow a single proposition to be (at the same time):\n\n(i)\ntrue relative to the context of assessment where A\u2019s standards of taste are operative and\n(ii)\nfalse relative to the context of assessment where  B\u2019s standards of taste are operative.\n\nNew Relativist views, which endorse truth-relativism locally for some domain of discourse, stand in opposition to the more traditional view of propositional content (what Cappelen & Hawthorne call \u201cThe Simple View\u201d) according to which propositions bear truth and falsity as monadic properties (cf. however, MacFarlane 2011a for some resistance to Cappelen & Hawthorne\u2019s claim that this simple characterization should be regarded as the \u201creceived\u201d view.)\nA key source of philosophical motivation for relativizing truth in the fashion of New Relativism traces to Lewis\u2019s (1980) and Kaplan\u2019s (1989) foundational work in semantics, according to which sentence truth is to be understood as relative to a circumstance of evaluation that includes world, time and location. New Relativists inherit the formal apparatus of Lewis and Kaplan and add another parameter, but their reasons for doing so are quite different from the reasons that motivated the framework in the first place. While Lewis\u2019s and Kaplan\u2019s reasons for \u201cproliferating\u201d parameters were primarily based on considerations to do with intensional operators (though see Yli-Vakkuri et al. 2019), the more contemporary reasons for adding a judge or standard parameter are often to do with respecting (for instance) disagreement data. (For further discussion here, see K\u00f6lbel (2015)). (Note that \u201cold-style contextualism\u201d can also be stated in Kaplan\u2019s framework; it involves variation in content with respect to the context of utterance rather than in truth value with respect to the circumstance of evaluation).\nKaplan\u2019s view specifically was that the need for particular parameters in the circumstance of evaluation was a function of the non-specificity of certain propositional contents with respect to world, time and location (see Kaplan\u2019s (1989) analysis of indexicals). On Kaplan\u2019s view:\n\nA circumstance will usually include a possible state or history of the world, a time, and perhaps other features as well. The amount of information we require from a circumstance is linked to the degree of specificity of contents and thus to the kinds of operators in the language\u2026. (1989: 502)\n\nJohn MacFarlane, a leading contemporary relativist, writes:\n\nTaking this line of thought a little farther, the relativist might envision contents that are \u201csense-of-humor neutral\u201d or \u201cstandard-of-taste neutral\u201d or \u201cepistemic-state neutral\u201d, and circumstances of evaluation that include parameters for a sense of humor, a standard of taste or an epistemic state. This move would open up room for the truth value of a proposition to vary with these \u201csubjective\u201d factors in much the same way that it varies with the world of evaluation. (MacFarlane 2007: 6\u20137)\n\nSimilarly, Cappelen and Hawthorne write:\n\nContemporary analytic relativists reason as follows: \u2018Lewis and Kaplan have shown that we need to relativize truth to triples of <world, time, location>[\u2019]. \u2026 But, having already started down this road, why not exploit these strategies further? In particular, by adding new and exotic parameters into the circumstances of evaluation, we can allow the contents of thought and talk to be non-specific (in Kaplan\u2019s sense) along dimensions other than world, time and location. (2009: 10; edited)\n\nA question on which New Relativists are divided, however, is: what contents are non-specific along dimensions other than world, time and location? It is with respect to this general question that different families of New Relativism are generated.\nThe taxonomy we offer is that a view falls within the category of New Relativism if, and only if, the view endorses a truth-relativist semantics (as previously outlined) for utterance tokens in some domain of discourse, such as: discourse about predicates of personal taste (Lasersohn 2005; K\u00f6lbel 2003), epistemic modals (Egan 2007; Egan, Hawthorne & Weatherson 2005; MacFarlane 2011b; Stephenson 2007), future contingents (MacFarlane 2003), indicative conditionals (Weatherson 2009; Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010) gradable adjectives (Richard 2004), deontic modals (Kolodny & MacFarlane 2010 and MacFarlane 2014: ch. 11) and knowledge attributions (Richard 2004); MacFarlane 2005b, 2011c, 2014). The motivations for truth-relativism in each of these domains include various considerations unique to those domains. We consider some of the arguments for New Relativism in four of these domains in the following sections.\n5.2 Truth Relativism and predicates of personal taste\nOne area of discourse that has been particularly fertile ground for New Relativism is discourse that concerns predicates of personal taste (e.g., \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d.)\n5.2.1 Lasersohn (2005) and the judge parameter\nTake a case where Mary says: \u201cThe chili is tasty\u201d and John says, \u201cThe chili is not tasty\u201d. Lasersohn argues (much as K\u00f6lbel does) that only the truth-relativist can make sense of the nature of John and Mary\u2019s disagreement: It is a genuine disagreement. One affirms what the other denies. And yet neither is wrong. Lasersohn argues that there is an elegant way to make sense of the idea that John and Mary are both (in some sense) right, even though John asserts the negation of what is expressed by Mary. What Lasersohn) suggests, more formally, is the introduction of a judge parameter.\n\nInstead of treating the content of a sentence as a set of time-world pairs, we should treat it as a set of time-world-individual triples. We assume that the content will provide an individual to be used in evaluating the sentences for truth and falsity, just as it provides a time and world. (Lasersohn: 2005: 17)\n\nLasersohn adds (2005: 23) that in order to maintain an authentically subjective assignment of truth-values to sentences containing predicates of personal taste, we must allow that the objective facts of the situation of utterance do not uniquely determine a judge. But who is the judge? Typically, it is us, and when it is, the evaluation is from what Lasersohn calls an autocentric perspective. Importantly, Lasersohn allows that in certain circumstances we take an exocentric perspective when assessing predicates of personal taste: assessing these sentences for truth relative to contexts in which someone other than ourselves is specified as the judge (cf. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d \u201cIs this fun?\u201d (2005: 26); cf. Stanley (2005: 10) for a response to Lasersohn\u2019s program).\n5.2.2 K\u00f6lbel and Faultless Disagreement\nK\u00f6lbel\u2019s (2003) faultless disagreement argument for relativism about predicates of personal taste features a \u201cproof\u201d that there is no faultless disagreement followed by a demonstration that the proof is indefensible. The proof proceeds from two premises: an equivalence schema\n\n(ES)\nIt is true that p iff p;\n\nand an apparent truism about mistakes:\n\n(T)\nIt is a mistake to believe a proposition that is not true.\n\n(ES) and (T) generate the conclusion that there is no faultless disagreement through the following proof (see also Wright 2001:52)\n\n(1)\nA believes that p. (Assumption)\n(2)\nB believes that not-p (Assumption)\n(3)\np (Assumption)\n(4)\nnot-true (not-p) 3, ES\n(5)\nB has made a mistake 2, 4, T\n(6)\nNot-p (Assumption)\n(7)\nNot-true (p) 6, ES\n(8)\nA has made a mistake (1, 6, T)\n(9)\nEither A or B has made a mistake (3\u20138)\n\nBut because K\u00f6lbel takes (9) to be implausible in what K\u00f6lbel takes to be \u201cdiscretionary\u201d (non-objective, as K\u00f6lbel sees it) areas of discourse he contends that we should introduce a relativized version of (T) to avoid the conclusion that at least one party has made a mistake.\n\n(T***)\nIt is a mistake to believe a discretionary proposition that is not true as evaluated from one\u2019s own perspective. (2003: 70)\n\nK\u00f6lbel claims further that, for reasons of uniformity, we should \u201crelativize truth of all propositions across the board\u2026\u201d and he accordingly endorses the following version of truth relativism:\n\n(TR)\nIt is a mistake to believe a proposition that is not true in one\u2019s own perspective. (2003: 70).\n\nK\u00f6lbel (2003: 71) thinks that this position allows the possibility of maintaining that faultless disagreement is impossible in some non-discretionary (objective) areas, and this will depend on the relation of perspective possession (but see also Boghossian 2011 for the contrary view). An implication of the position is that K\u00f6lbel\u2019s view will allow assertions of the form: \u201cPretzels are not tasty, though John believes they are. And yet John is not mistaken\u201d. For other discussions of faultless disagreement, see Richard (2008), MacFarlane (2012, 2014: ch. 6), and Zeman (2019). For an attempt to countenance faultless disagreement within an absolutist framework, see Baker & Robson (2017).\n5.2.3 Moral relativism\nThere is a version of moral relativism (e.g., K\u00f6lbel 2004) that falls squarely within the New Relativist tradition. We can think of this relativism simply as a generalization of the position just discussed that treats moral terms (e.g., \u201cright\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d) as assessment-sensitive along with predicates of personal taste.\nSuch an extension faces problems analogous to those faced by truth-relativists about predicates of personal taste (cf. Beebe (2010) for a helpful discussion of truth-relativist semantics versus varieties of contextualist competitors).\nA broader kind of problem for this semantic thesis (as well as to moral relativists more generally), raised by Coliva and Moruzzi (2012) is that it succumbs to the progress argument, an argument that famously challenges, in particular, cultural relativists (as well as indexical contextualists) about moral judgments by insisting that moral progress is both evident and not something the relativist can countenance (e.g., Rachels 2009). A third and particularly important kind of worry, addressed by Capps, Lynch and Massey (2009), involves explaining the source and nature of moral relativity, on a truth-relativist framework. Specifically, they claim that\n\nwe ought to have some account of why it is that truth in the moral domain is such that it varies with a parameter set by the context of assessment. (Capps, Lynch & Massey 2009: 416)\n\nAn additional problem concerns the plausibility of simply extending disagreement based arguments for relativism about predicates of personal taste over to moral predicates like \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019. As Wedgwood (2019) has suggested, moral disagreements, in a way that is disanalogous to disagreements about what\u2019s tasty, implicate a kind of \u2018inexcusable irrationality\u2019 (2019: 97)\u2014at least, if the moral truths that constitute moral principles are a priori knowable. To the extent that there is a difference in inexcusability across the two cases of disagreement, it would be contentious to think that an argument from \u2018faultless disagreement\u2019 to relativism in the arena of predicates of personal taste would extend, mutatis mutandis, to an analogous argument in the moral arena.\n5.3 Truth relativism and epistemic modals\nEpistemic modality (e.g., claims of the form \u201cS might be F\u201d) is another particularly fertile ground for New Relativists. A key reason for this is the dialectical force of Eavesdropper Arguments, which attempt to show the perils of contextualist treatments of utterances containing epistemic modals. Another prominent argument concerns metasemantic complexity. We will examine both of these argument strategies. But first, let\u2019s distinguish epistemic modality from metaphysical modality. To say that p is metaphysically possible is to say that p might have been the case in the sense that: in some possible world, p is true. To say that p is epistemically possible is by contrast to say that p might be the case, or that p is the case for all we know (see the entry on Varieties of Modality). A canonical example of a statement expressing an epistemic modal is the claim A might be F. The truth of claims of the form A might be F will depend on whether F is an epistemic possibility for some individual or group, which is to say, that F must not be ruled out by what some individual or group knows. But which individual or group? This is not always clear. As Egan and Weatherson (2011: 4) remark:\n\n\u2026statements of epistemic possibility in plain English do not make any explicit reference to such a person, group, evidence set, or information state. One of the key issues confronting a semanticist attempting to theorize about epistemic modals is what to do about this lack of reference.\n\nEavesdropper-style cases highlight the difficulty of determining exactly which individual\u2019s or group\u2019s body of information is relevant to the truth of claims of epistemic possibility and are taken by defenders of truth-relativism about epistemic modals to motivate their position. A variety of different eavesdropper cases have been given by different proponents (and attempted refuters) of truth-relativism about epistemic modals in the literature. For ease of exposition, we will use an especially simple version of the case, from Hawthorne\u2019s (2007), slightly amended:\n\nEAVESDROPPER: [Sandra] is on the way to the grocery store. I hear her say: \u201cSusan might be at the store. I could run into her\u201d. No party to the conversation that I am listening in on knows that Susan is on vacation. But I know that she is. Despite the fact that it is compatible with what the conversants know that Susan is in the store and that the speaker will run into her, I am inclined to judge the speaker\u2019s [Sandra\u2019s] modal judgments to be incorrect. (Hawthorne 2007: 92)\n\nEgan (2007), Egan, Hawthorne and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane (2011b) share a similar set of diagnoses here: (i) it seems that while Sandra and I disagree about the truth value of Sandra\u2019s statement, neither she nor I have made a mistake; (ii) the contextualist can\u2019t explain this; (iii) the truth-relativist can.\nWhy can\u2019t the contextualist explain this? As noted, the truth of claims expressing epistemic modals must depend on what some individual or group knows. But in these cases the context of use does not pick out a single such individual or group. After all, if it did, then either Sandra or I would be wrong, but it seems that neither of us is. That the context of use does not uniquely pick out one relevant body of knowledge for determining the truth of epistemic modal statements is not, as MacFarlane notes, something that can be accommodated by \u201cthe framework of contextualism, which requires that the relevant body of knowledge be determined by features of the context of use\u201d. (MacFarlane 2011c)\nAdditionally, as Egan and Weatherson (2011) suggest, any contextualist account of the semantics of epistemic modals that could handle eavesdropper-style cases in a principled way would be hideously complicated. This motivates a metasemantic argument against contextualism (and a corresponding argument for relativism): if contextualism about epistemic modals is correct, then the semantics for epistemic modals will be hideously complicated; the semantics is not hideously complicated on the truth-relativist\u2019s proposal, therefore, ceteris paribus, truth-relativism for epistemic modals is more plausible than contextualism. However, Glanzberg (2007) notably denies that metasemantic complexity in this case must be problematic.\nHow can the relativist accommodate eavesdropper cases? MacFarlane (2011b) articulates the relativist solution: Sandra and I disagree about the truth-value of a single proposition, the proposition that Susan might be at the store. This proposition, even when fully articulated, makes no reference to any particular body of knowledge. But such propositions cannot be true or false simpliciter. They are true only relative to a context of assessment that includes a body of knowledge. In this case, the proposition is true relative to a context of assessment where what Sandra knows is operative\u2014a context in which Sandra is the evaluator\u2014and false relative to a context of assessment where what I know is operative because I am the evaluator. Thus: both disagreement and faultlessness are preserved (cf. Ross & Schroeder 2013 for criticism and Kindermann & Egan (2019) for an alternative proposal).\nAlong with MacFarlane, Egan (2007) and Stephenson (2007) have also offered positive defenses of truth-relativism about epistemic modals; their defenses share MacFarlane\u2019s view that propositions expressing epistemic modals are non-specific along dimensions that include the body of information possessed by a judge or assessor.\nMore recently, experimental philosophy has contributed to this debate. Empirical studies reported by Knobe & Yalcin (2014) and Khoo (2015) indicate that folk judgments about the truth of claims featuring epistemic modals aligns more closely with what contextualism rather than relativism would predict. However, see Beddor and Egan (2019) for experimental results that are argued to better support (a version of) relativism than contextualism.\n5.4 Truth relativism and future contingents\nPropositions termed \u201cfuture contingents\u201d are about the future and their truth-values are not settled by the state of the world in the past or present (see entry on Future Contingents, and MacFarlane 2014: ch. 9). In a deterministic world there are no future contingent statements in this sense. But in an indeterministic world, statements partly about the future will often satisfy these conditions. Consider Aristotle\u2019s oft-cited example: the proposition There will be a sea battle tomorrow, uttered at t. Contrast now two intuitions: the determinacy intuition that utterances that \u201cturned out true\u201d were true at the time of utterance; and the indeterminacy intuition that, at the time of the utterance, multiple histories are possible, including one where there was a sea battle and the proposition is true, and one where there was not, and the proposition is false. The indeterminacy intuition leads us to think the truth-value of future contingents is indeterminate at the time of utterance, and either true or false at a later time (cf. MacFarlane 2003; Carter 2011).\nJohn MacFarlane (2003) thinks that both the indeterminacy intuition and the determinacy intuition should be taken at face value and that the only way to account for the semantics of future contingents is to allow the truth of future contingent statements to be, as he puts it, doubly relativized: to both the context of utterance and the context of assessment. When we evaluate a single token utterance of \u201cThere will be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d produced on (say) Monday, this counts as neither true nor false when the context of assessment is the context in which the utterance is being made (as multiple possible histories are open at this point). However the very same statement will have a determinate truth-value relative to the context of assessment of the following day. So we can have faultless transtemporal disagreement about the truth-value of a single utterance (MacFarlane 2003: 36; cf. Carter 2011).\n5.5 Truth relativism and knowledge ascriptions\nMacFarlane (2005b) argues that \u201cknow\u201d is sensitive to the epistemic standards at play in the context of assessment; that is, the extension of \u201cknow\u201d varies with the context of assessment. Much as the relativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the determinacy and indeterminacy intuitions, the relativist about knowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted synthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive varieties of invariantist (see entry on Epistemic Contextualism). As MacFarlane (2014: 190) puts it:\n\nInvariantism is right that there is a single knowledge relation, and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions does not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context of use. But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such ascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant standards. Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more satisfactory picture.\n\nTo apply this view, suppose George says, \u201cBill knows that his car is in the driveway\u201d, while Barry says, \u201cBill doesn\u2019t know that his car is in the driveway\u201d. According to the relativist, the assessment of the truth-values of Bill\u2019s and Barry\u2019s statements depends also on the specification of some epistemic standard. For the truth-relativist, the standard will be the operative standard in the context of assessment. George\u2019s utterance may be true (and Barry\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which ordinary \u201clow\u201d standards are in place, whereas Barry\u2019s may be true (and George\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which high \u201cCartesian\u201d standards are in place. See Stanley (2005: ch. 7) for a detailed criticism of this position, though see also MacFarlane (2014: \u00a78.5 for a reply). See also Richard (2004), for another version of truth-relativism for knowledge attributions. In MacFarlane\u2019s more recent (2014) defense of a truth-relativist semantics for \u201cknows\u201d, the context of assessment is taken to fix which alternatives count as relevant. See, however, Carter 2015 for an argument that MacFarlane\u2019s more recent view generates counterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck (e.g., barn fa\u00e7ade-style cases) and normative defeaters.\n5.6 General Objections to New Relativism\nWe turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all its forms. The first is an argument from assertion, the second an argument from simplicity.\n5.6.1 Relativism and assertion\nTwo assertion-related objections to New Relativism arise from work by Gareth Evans (1985) and Robert Stalnaker (1978), respectively. Greenough (2010: 2) concisely captures Evans\u2019s challenge to truth-relativism on assertoric grounds as follows:\n\n(1)\nThe question \u201cWhat should [an assertor] aim at?\u201d is a legitimate question.\n(2)\nAny legitimate answer to this question will generate a once-and-for-all answer.\n(3)\nAny once-and-for-all answer is incompatible with Truth-Relativism\n(4)\nTherefore, Truth Relativism is ruled out.\n\nThe relativist must plausibly take issue with (2) or (3), (or both). For an attempt to meet Evans\u2019 challenge, MacFarlane has defended a way to effectively reject (2) via what Marques has called a \u201cmeet-the-challenge\u201d norm of assertion (cf. MacFarlane 2003; though see also his 2014: ch. 5; cf., Stanley 2016: 181\u20132)\u2014according to which (\u00e0 la Brandom 1983), in asserting p one undertakes a commitment to either defending p or giving up p if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily (see K\u00f6lbel (2004: 308) for some other discussions of this objection).\nA related assertion-based challenge to truth-relativism emerges by appeal to Stalnaker\u2019s (1978) belief transfer model of assertion (cf. 2011). The idea here is to appeal to a plausible view of the purpose of assertion\u2014to \u201ctransfer beliefs from assertor to members of her audience\u201d (Egan 2007: 15) and then to object that what is asserted, according to the truth-relativist, cannot play this characteristic role; specifically, this will be because, for the truth-relativist, the asserted contents are liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to the audience. For instance, Sam hardly (on the truth-relativist\u2019s program) seems to \u201ctransfer\u201d to Dean his belief Apples are tasty (which is true) by asserting this to Dean, when what Dean comes to believe Apples are tasty is something (on the assumption that Dean doesn\u2019t like apples) that will be false. Thus, and more generally, it\u2019s not clear what, exactly, could be said to be transferred and a fortiori asserted. See Egan (2007) and Dinges (2017) for attempts to reconcile truth-relativism (about epistemic modals) with Stalnaker\u2019s belief-transfer model of assertion.\n5.6.2 Simplicity\nCappelen and Hawthorne (2009) assess the merits of New Relativism as it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of the objects of thought and talk, \u201cSimplicity\u201d, the core tenets of which are:\n\n(T1)\nThere are propositions and they instantiate the fundamental monadic properties of truth simpliciter and falsity simpliciter.\n(T2)\nThe semantic values of declarative sentences relative to contexts of utterance are propositions.\n(T3)\nPropositions are, unsurprisingly, the objects of propositional attitudes, such as belief, hope, wish, doubt.\n(T4)\nPropositions are the objects of illocutionary acts; they are, e.g., what we assert and deny.\n(T5)\nPropositions are the objects of agreement and disagreement. (Cappelen & Hawthorne 2009: 1)\n\nCappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism (what they call analytic relativism) as a direct challenge to (T1) and that, if this challenge were successful, it would consequently bring down the more general picture they call \u201csimplicity\u201d (cf., Ferrari & Wright 2017). Accordingly, Cappelen and Hawthorne\u2019s central objective is to show that truth-relativist\u2019s arguments aimed at undermining (T1) are ultimately unsuccessful; more specifically, their broad strategy is to insist that the arguments adduced in favor of truth-relativism\u2014when thoroughly understood\u2014constitute a presumptive case for contextualism (in the domains where relativism was defended, and in particular, in the domain of predicates of personal taste).\n6. Conclusion\nRelativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves grounded in disparate philosophical motivations. There is no such thing as Relativism simpliciter, and no single argument that would establish or refute every relativistic position that has been proposed. Despite this diversity, however, there are commonalities and family resemblances that justify the use of the label \u201crelativism\u201d for the various views we have discussed. Relativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various attempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse. What is most surprising, however, is the recent popularity of some versions of the doctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy.",
