    "main_text": "Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism || Value Pluralism before Berlin\n4.2 Value Pluralism before Berlin\n\nBerlin provided his own (inconsistent and somewhat peculiar)\ngenealogies of pluralism. He found the first rebellion against monism\neither in Machiavelli (1990, 7\u20139) or in Vico and Herder (2000a,\n8\u201311), who were also decisive figures in the first account. Yet\nhe acknowledged that Machiavelli wasn\u2019t really a pluralist, but\na dualist; and other scholars have questioned his identification of\nVico and Herder as pluralists, when both avowed belief in a higher,\ndivine or mystical, unity behind variety. Other scholars have credited\nother figures in the history of philosophy, such as Aristotle, with\npluralism (Nussbaum 1986, Evans 1996). James Fitzjames Stephen\nadvanced something that looks very much like Berlin\u2019s pluralism\n(Stephen 1873), though he allied it to a conservative critique of\nMill\u2019s liberalism.\n\nIn Germany, Dilthey came close to pluralism, and Max Weber presented a\ndramatic, forceful picture of the tragic conflict between\nincommensurable values, belief systems and ways of life (Weber 1918,\nesp. 117, 126, 147\u20138, 151\u20133; cf. Weber 1904, esp.\n17\u201318).\n\nEthical pluralism first emerged under that name, however, in America,\ninspired by William James\u2019s pluralistic view of the universe, as\nwell as his occasional gestures towards value pluralism (James 1891).\nJohn Dewey and the British theologian Hastings Rashdall both\napproximated pluralism in certain writings (Dewey 1908, Rashdall\n1907); but pluralism was apparently first proposed, under that name,\nand as a specifically ethical doctrine,\n in language strikingly similar to Berlin\u2019s,\n by Sterling Lamprecht, a naturalist philosopher and scholar of Hobbes\nand Locke, in two articles (1920, 1921), as well as, somewhat later,\nby A. P. Brogan (1931). The dramatic similarities between not only\nBerlin\u2019s and Lamprecht\u2019s ideas, but also their language,\nmake it difficult to believe that Lamprecht was not an influence on\nBerlin. However, there is no independent evidence that Berlin knew\nLamprecht\u2019s work; and Berlin\u2019s tendency was more often to\ncredit his own ideas to others than to claim the work of others as his\nown.\n\nVersions of pluralism were also advocated by Berlin\u2019s\ncontemporaries Raymond Aron, Stuart Hampshire, Reinhold Niebuhr and\nMichael Oakeshott (although Oakeshott seems to have attributed\nconflicts of values to a mistakenly reflective approach to ethical\nissues, and suggested that they could be overcome through relying on a\nmore habitual, less self-conscious, ethical approach: see Oakeshott\n1962, 1\u201336).\n",
