    "main_text": "The Ramsey Rule and Its Ramifications || Numerical Estimates of the Optimum Rate of Saving\n4.5 Commentary\n\n\nA national saving rate of 40% (eq. 21b) is no doubt high by the\nstandards of contemporary western economies, but there are countries\nthat in recent years have achieved 40\u201345% saving rates (China is\na prominent example). A figure of 67% for \\(s^*\\) (eq. 21a) is higher\nthan the saving rate in any country, but is not beyond belief. The\ntruly outlandish figures is 98% (eq. 21c). It is outlandish\nespecially because the figure is the optimum saving rate no matter how\nsmall \\(K(0)\\) happens to be.  Admittedly, the model here\n(eqs. 11a\u2013b) is phenomenally stylized, but it does bring out\nsharply the observation of Koopmans (1965), that it is foolish to\nassume \\(\\delta = 0\\) (or close to 0) without first checking its\npossible consequences for the distribution of well-being across the\ngenerations.\n\n\nEquation (19) has shown that the optimum growth rate of consumption\nis bounded above by \\(\\mu\\), which explains why \\(g^*\\) is less than\n5% a year for each of the three parametric specifications we have\nconsidered. The specifications come from three studies in the\nwelfare economics of global climate change, in which the authors worked\nwith models that are a lot more complex than Ramsey\u2019s. And yet\ntheir findings are exactly what his formulation would point to\n(Dasgupta 2008), namely, that other things equal, the lower is the\nchosen value of \\(\\delta\\) and/or the larger is the damage to future\nwell-being that is expected to be caused by global climate change, the\ngreater is the investment level DM should recommend to avert climate\nchange or soften the effects of that change on human well-being. The\noften shrill debate (e.g., Nordhaus 2007) on the extent to which\nglobal investment should be directed at reducing the deletarious\neffects of climate change was spurred by differences in model\nspecification among climate-change economists.\n\n\nThe linear technology (eq. 11a) and the iso-elastic\n\\(U\\)-function (eq. 11b), when taken together, have offered\ndeep insights even though we have restricted the discussion to\npen-and-paper calculations here. The functional forms are not\nbelievable; nevertheless, Ramsey made use of them. His paper showed\nthat unbelievably simplified models, provided their construction is\nbacked by strong intuition, can illuminate questions that are\nseemingly impossible to frame, let alone to answer\nquantitatively. That has been Ramsey\u2019s enduring gift to\ntheoretical economics.\n",
