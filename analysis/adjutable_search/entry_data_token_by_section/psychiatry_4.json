    "main_text": "The Medical Model and its Implications || The Strong Interpretation of the Medical Model\n2.3 The Strong Interpretation of the Medical Model\n\n\nProponents of the strong interpretation, then, can agree with Guze\nthat there are distinct mental illnesses with characteristic symptoms\nand natural histories. But they go further. If psychiatry is really a\nbranch of medicine, they suspect, we should see the specific causal\nhypotheses emerge about mechanisms that cause the symptoms of mental\nillness. Both Andreasen and Guze assume that to find the specific\ncauses of disease we need a background theory of normal function.\nPsychopathology is to be identified as the departure of a psychological\nsystem from its proper state. (We should note what counts as a\nmalfunction is often contested in psychology and neuroscience.\nFurthermore, the presence of a malfunction does not suffice for mental\nillness. Most scholars agree that our thoughts about the nature of\ndisease are sensitive to biological abnormalities but are also guided\nby judgments that such abnormalities impede human flourishing (See\nCooper 2007, Murphy 2006, Sadler 2004, Wakefield 1992). The medical\nmodel also sees abnormalities or dysfunctions as necessary but not\nsufficient for mental illness. The broader issues involved will be put\naside here. Our question is: how far can psychiatry adopt medical\nreasoning about pathogenic neurobiological processes? )\n\n\nThe strong interpretation seeks explanations that cite pathogenic\nprocesses in brain systems, just as bodily diseases are explained by\nprocesses in other organs. The process at issue need not be\ndestructive, in the sense that it makes the system collapse. Bolton and\nHill (2004, 252) note that many mental illnesses seem to be the\noutcome of systems in a poorly regulated state that is stable, albeit\nsuboptimal. But, as they say, the same is true of hypertension and\nCushing\u2019s disease; the idea of a specific pathogenic process in\nmedicine includes dysregulation.\n\n\nHeinrich and Andreasen assume that since the brain is an information\nprocessing organ the obvious background theory is cognitive\nneuroscience. Other thinkers have argued that the correct background\ntheory for psychiatry is molecular biology (Kandel 2005, ch.2).\n\n\nBolton and Hill worry that whatever background theory the medical\nmodel employs, it will require explanations in terms of biological\nrather than intentional phenomena. They conclude that biological\npsychiatry can only accommodate disorders in which\n\u201cintentionality has run out\u201d (2004, 256). If true, this\nrules out using the medical model to explain the many psychopathologies\nthat appear to involve irreducibly intentional or meaningful processes\n(cf. Thornton 2007, ch 4). The worry is founded on the assumption that\nthere is an unbridgeable distinction between understanding a phenomenon\nin intentional terms and providing a causal explanation of it.\nBut the brain is a cognitive organ\u2014and, indeed, a social one.\nMany disciplines study the effects of healthy cognition on behaviour,\nand there is no reason to expect that cognition will suddenly become\nirrelevant to the explanation of behaviour when we study mental\nillness. For instance, Kendler and Prescott (2006, 148ff) found that\n\u201cstressful life events\u201d are among the chief causes of\ndepression, that they are especially depressogenic if they involve\nexperiences of humiliation (160), and that humiliation cannot be\ngiven a molecular reduction (350). Kendler and Prescott call Major\nDepression one of the oldest diagnoses in medicine (52) and they are\ncommitted to finding specific etiologies. Yet they are happy to employ\n\u201cclassically mental constructs\u201d (350) as parts of their\ncausal models of mental illness.\n\n\nAs presented so far, the strong interpretation of the medical model\nincludes a demand for understanding biological systems in terms of\ntheir normal function if we are to understand why they become abnormal.\nKincaid (2008, 375) has argued that a demand like that is\nunreasonable, because we can conduct research on depression (his\nexample), as we do medical research more generally, based on\n\u201cpartial and unsystematic\u201d causal understanding. Kincaid\nidentifies the demand for a background theory with the search for a\n\u201ccomplete wiring diagram of the organism from fertilization to\nmaturity\u201d (377) and he identifies that search with a\nconception of science as a search for laws of nature and natural kinds.\nBut these seem to be separable: a background theory could comprise a\nnumber of partial wiring diagrams arrived at by piecemeal\ninvestigation, nor does it have to be driven by a desire for\nexplanation in terms of kinds participating in laws. The questions are,\nwhat sort of general orientation toward mental phenomena does the\nmedical model permit, and what sorts of explanations can it encompass?\nWe do not need a complete theory of how biological systems work in\norder to conduct fruitful research. The issue is whether, at a minimum,\nthere need to be some rough theoretical frameworks and shared empirical\nclaims within which otherwise abnormalities can be identified and\noutcomes assessed.\n\n\nFirst, nothing in the strong interpretation of the medical model\nrules out explanations that cite cognitive processes in brains:\nAndreasen (1997) argues that schizophrenia and depression are cognitive\npathologies and sees psychiatry as both a form of medicine and\n\u201cthe discipline within cognitive neuroscience that integrates\ninformation from all these related disciplines in order to develop\nmodels that explain the cognitive dysfunctions of psychiatric patients\nbased on knowledge of normal mind/brain function\u201d (1586).\nThis conception of psychiatry is fully biological but not committed to\na particular metaphysical interpretation of what biological explanation\nmust look like. It sees mental illness as the result of pathogenic\nprocesses taking place in brain systems but does not force us to choose\nreductive explanations as a matter of logic. So Bolton and Hill\u2019s\nworry about the compatibility of the medical with their \u201cneural\nencoding\u201d theory (2005, ch.2) seems overstated. They are right to\nstress that the brain can be seen as a socially situated, cognitive\norgan, but there are advocates of a strong medical model who are\nequally attuned to this conception of neuroscience. Existing medical\nand biological practice already cites processes that cross levels of\nexplanation (Schaffner 1993, 1994) and incorporate environmental\ninformation about stress or other risk factors. There is in principle\nno objection to adding an intentional level to the mix. Any conception\nof normal neurological functioning must take information-processing\ninto account, because processing information is what brains are for.\n\n\n\nMost mental illnesses are caused by diverse environmental and\ngenetic factors. We have little reason to think that all the relevant\ncauses can be given a reductive analysis, for as Schaffner dryly points\nout, to specify and measure environmental variables in purely molecular\nterms \u201cwould be a very long-term project\u201d (1994, 287).\nBut one might still think that molecular processes are the root\ncauses of mental illness even if many other contributory factors exist\nand define the context within which genes work. Kandel (2005) offers a\nvery stringent version of this view, which assigns all explanatory\nsignificance to proximal genetic causes on the grounds that \u201call\nof \u2018nurture\u2019 is ultimately expressed as\n\u2018nature\u2019 (39)\u201d He means that behavioral and\ncultural factors influence gene expression, but he also seems to think\nthat this implies that psychiatric explanations need only mention gene\nexpression, which will screen off everything else.\n\n\nKandel\u2019s genetic reductionism is a metaphysical position aimed\nat identifying a privileged level in nature and a general explanatory\nstrategy that unifies the phenomena and offers lawlike explanations.\nHowever, in medicine the goal of causal explanation is instrumental. We\nseek the factors that make a difference in a given case, not a\nmetaphysically privileged level or a general unifying account. There is\nlittle reason so far to believe that the reductionistic approach Kandel\nurges has been more fruitful.\n\n\nIn studying eating disorders, for example, we find that social\nfactors may explain particular epidemiological patterns, like different\nlevels of eating disorder across populations. But social factors\ndon\u2019t tell us why only one girl in a family gets bulimia. To\nexplain that we can look at a particular brain chemistry that puts her\nat risk (Steiger et al 2001). But that does not establish that\nneurobiology really is fundamental. Rather, nothing is fundamental.\nCulture or trauma may require biological mediation to have its\npathological effect, and vice-versa. Neither one should be considered\nfundamental, but seen rather as the best way to answer a specific\nquestion about what makes a difference in a context.\n\n\nThe identification of a cause of a disease often depends on what we\nwant to control. The reason for this, as Whitbeck (1977) and Kincaid\n(2008) have convincingly argued, is that physicians care about causes\nfor instrumental reasons. The goal is to understand why a biological\nsystem has departed from a functional state and identify components and\nprocesses within the system that can be manipulated so as to understand\nthe abnormal character of the system, and, ideally, mitigate it.\nIn looking for the relevant factors we do not seek a final\ndescription of the system or look for the ultimate sources of an\nabnormal or disvalued outcome. Rather, we hope to identify the\nvariables that made a difference to the outcome.\n\n\nThat is why alternative etiologies can complement, rather than\ncompete with, each other, as in Meehl\u2019s (1977) example of an\nelderly man, genetically somewhat at risk for depression, who develops\nit after his spouse dies. It seems wrong to call this a genetically\ncaused episode of depression: the genes needed an unusual environment,\nso that in most other circumstances the man would not be depressed. But\nhe would not have developed clinical depression had his genes been\ndifferent. Both factors are causally relevant.\n\n\nBecause of this stress on figuring out what makes a difference in a\ncontext, medicine is a natural home to manipulationist accounts of\ncausation, as Whitbeck also saw (1977, 627\u201328). The basic idea behind\nthe manipulationist approach is that it puts us in a position to begin\nexplaining a phenomenon \u201cwhen we have identified factors or\nconditions such that manipulations or changes in those factors or\nconditions will produce changes in the outcome being explained\u201d\n(Woodward 2003, 10). We may have a correlation\u2014say that\nbetween smoking and heart disease. We get from there to a causal\nexplanation if we can intervene so as to manipulate the value of the\ncausal variable by itself\u2014by stopping one group from smoking\nand letting an otherwise identical group smoke, for example. If smoking\ncauses heart disease, we will see an effect on the cancer variable that\nreflects our meddling with the smokers. If smoking doesn\u2019t cause\nheart disease then there will not be a correlation between the two\nvariables. (This view is compatible with many proposals about the\nunderlying metaphysics. There will be more on this account of causation\nin section 3.1. For the technical details see Spirtes et al 2000, Pearl\n2009).\n\n\nKandel\u2019s avowed molecular reductionism dissents from the\ngoal-driven, manipulationist view. Kandel bets that molecular\nexplanation picks out nature\u2019s own preferred level. He assumes\nthat as we learn more we will be able to supply fundamental\nexplanations at such a level. Kandel invites us to give up a fruitful\napproach in favor of a promissory note, on which we have scant reason\nto expect payment. Molecular explanations do not appear to be\nflourishing alone among all possible approaches to mental illness.\n(Schaffner (1998) points out how hard it is to supply reductive\nexplanations even for simple model organisms.)\n\n\nThings may turn out as Kandel expects, but it is not clear that they\nwill, based on the current fortunes of different kinds of psychiatric\nexplanation. In any event, it seems that the medical model does not\nrequire any particular level of explanation. Rather, it seems to be\nmarked, in its strong interpretation, by a search for explanations of a\nparticular form that can involve many different levels. These are\nexplanations that show how symptoms of mental illness systematically\ndepend on disruptions to the normal functioning of biological and\ncognitive processes. The strong interpretation of the medical model\nbets on such explanations being available and\u2014which is a\nfurther claim\u2014being clinically useful when they are finally\nuncovered. Whether the ensuing explanations privilege one form of\nexplanation over others is an empirical question to be answered case by\ncase. However, psychiatry currently recognizes many different causal\nfactors and we should expect that to continue. One way of cashing out\nthis idea is to say that psychiatry must pay attention to different\nlevels of explanation. The next section, on explanation, will begin\nwith a discussion of this point.\n",
