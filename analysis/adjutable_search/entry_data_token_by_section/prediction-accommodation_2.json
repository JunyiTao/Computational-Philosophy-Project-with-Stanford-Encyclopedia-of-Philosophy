    "main_text": "Early Characterizations of Novelty\n3. Early Characterizations of Novelty\n\nPopper wrote that \n\n\nConfirmations should count only if they are the result of risky\npredictions; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in\nquestion, we should have expected an event which was incompatible with\nthe theory in question, we should have expected an event which was\nincompatible with the theory\u2014an event which would have refuted\nthe theory. (1963: 36) \n\n\nPopper (and subsequently Lakatos) thereby endorsed a temporal\ncondition of novelty\u2014a prediction counts as novel is if it is\nnot known to be true (or is expected to prove false) at the time the\ntheory is constructed. But it was fairly obvious that this made\nimportant questions of confirmation turn implausibly on the time at\nwhich certain facts were known.\n\nThus Zahar proposed that a fact is novel \u201cif it did not belong\nto the problem-situation which governed the construction of the\nhypothesis\u201d (1973: 103). This form of novelty has been deemed\n\u2018problem-novelty\u2019 (Gardner 1982: 2). But in the same paper\nZahar purports to exemplify this concept of novelty by referring to\nthe case in which Einstein did not use the known behavior of\nMercury\u2019s perihelion in constructing his theory of\n relativity.[3]\n Gardner notes that this latter conception of novelty, which he deemed\n\u2018use-novelty\u2019, is distinct from problem-novelty (Gardner\n1982: 3). Evidence is use-novel for T if T was not built\nto fit that evidence (whether or not it was part of the relevant\n\u2018problem-situation\u2019 the theory was intended to address).\nIn subsequent literature, the so-called heuristic conception of\nnovelty has been identified with use-novelty\u2014it was further\narticulated in Worrall 1978 and\n 1985.[4]\n\n\nAnother approach argues that a novel consequence of a theory is one\nthat was not known to the theorist at the time she formulated the\ntheory\u2014this seems like a version of the temporal conception, but\nthis point appeals implicitly to the heuristic conception: if a\ntheorist knew of a result prior to constructing a theory which\nexplains it, it may be difficult to determine whether that theorist\nsomehow tailored the theory to fit the fact (e.g., she may have done\nso unconsciously). A knowledge-based conception is thus the best that\nwe can do to handle this difficulty (Gardner\n 1982).[5]\n\n\nThe heuristic conception is, however, deeply\ncontroversial\u2014because it makes the epistemic assessment of\ntheories curiously dependent on the mental life of their constructors,\nspecifically on the knowledge and intentions of the theorist to build\na theory that accommodated certain data rather than others.\nLeplin\u2019s comment is typical: \n\n\nThe theorist\u2019s hopes, expectations, knowledge, intentions, or\nwhatever, do not seem to relate to the epistemic standing of his\ntheory in a way that can sustain a pivotal role for them\u2026.\n(1997: 54) \n\n\n(For similar comments see Gardner 1982: 6; Thomason 1992: 195;\nSchlesinger 1987: 33; Achinstein 2001: 210\u2013230; and Collins\n1994.) \n\nAnother approach notes that scientists operate with competing theories\nand that the role of novel confirmations is to decide between them.\nThus, a consequence of a theory T is a \u2018novel\nprediction\u2019 if it is not a consequence of the best available\ntheory actually present in the field other than T (e.g., the\nprediction of the Mercury perihelion by Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheory constituted a novel prediction because it was not a\n(straightforward) consequence of Newtonian mechanics; Musgrave 1974:\n18). Operating in a Lakatosian framework, Frankel claims a consequence\nwas novel with respect to a theory and its research programme if it is\nnot similar to a fact which already has been used by members of the\nsame research program to support a theory designed to solve the same\nproblems as the theory in question (1979: 25). Also in a Lakatosian\nframework, Nunan claims that a consequence is novel if it has not\nalready been used to support, or cannot readily be explained in terms\nof, a theory entertained in some rival research program (1984:\n 279).[6]\n\nThere are clearly multiple forms of novelty and it is generally\nrecognized that a fact could be \u2018novel\u2019 in multiple\nsenses\u2014as we will see, some carry more epistemic weight than\nothers (Murphy 1989).\n",
