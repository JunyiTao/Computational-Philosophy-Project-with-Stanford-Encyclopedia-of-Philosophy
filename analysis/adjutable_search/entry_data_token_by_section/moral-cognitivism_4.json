    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Emotivism\n2.1 Emotivism\n\nEmotivists think moral terms in grammatically assertive utterances\nfunction primarily to express emotion and perhaps also to elicit\nsimilar emotions in others (Barnes 1933; Stevenson 1946; Ayer 1952,\nChapter 6). They can be read as suggesting that the right way to\nexplain the meanings of such terms is to point out that they are\nconventional devices for performing a certain sort of speech act, one\nwhich if sincere requires that the speaker have a certain attitude.\nSentences employing general predicates of positive moral evaluation\nsuch as \u2018right\u2019, \u2018good\u2019,\n\u2018virtuous\u2019, and so on signal a non-cognitive pro-attitude\nsuch as approval or preference. Sentences employing general predicates\nof negative evaluation such as \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019,\nand \u2018vicious\u2019 signal negative non-cognitive attitudes.\nThus to call a person virtuous is to express an attitude of approval\nand the speech act of doing so is analogous to the speech act\nperformed when we cheer for that person. The account can be extended\nbeyond general moral terms. Simple predicative utterances employing\nthe so-called thick moral terms such as \u2018brave\u2019 and\n\u2018honest\u2019 can then be thought of as performing this same\nspeech act while at the same time predicating the natural property\n(say fearlessness in the case of bravery) which common usage of the\nterm seems to track. Thus thick moral terms can be thought of as\nhaving both descriptive and emotive meaning.\n\nSome theorists who view themselves as emotivists suggest that even the\nmost general terms of moral evaluation have a descriptive meaning\nrather than just an emotive or non-cognitive meaning (Stevenson 1944,\n22; Hare 1952, suggests the same sort of idea within a prescriptivist\ntheory at 118). One such approach analyzes judgments applying a moral\npredicate to a particular object or action as expressing approval or\ndisapproval of some property while at the same time predicating that\nproperty of the object or item in question. This idea has been taken\nover by contemporary hybrid expressivists (Jackson 1999; Barker 2000;\nRidge 2006, Ridge 2014). According to these theorists, a sentence such\nas \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019 both predicates a property of the act\ntype lying and expresses the speaker\u2019s disapproval of that\nproperty. Theories of this sort will be discussed in more detail in\nthe section on hybrid theories below. They are mentioned here only to\nnote two points: (1) The hybrid idea was already present in the\nwritings of early noncognitivists. And (2) these more complicated\nviews are often adopted by theorists who begin from simpler theories\nwhich are paradigm cases of non-cognitivism.\n",
