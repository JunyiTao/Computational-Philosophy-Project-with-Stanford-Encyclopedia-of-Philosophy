Failed architecture is not\na straightforward subspecies of failed art or failed\nartifacts. Architectural objects may rate as aesthetic disasters yet\nin some overall sense as successes, unlike non-architecture art\nobjects. And architectural objects may cease to function\u2014or\nnever have functioned at all\u2014yet count as overall successes,\nunlike a range of (though not all) non-architecture artifacts. Another\nfeature of architectural failure\u2014in keeping with general design\nphenomena\u2014is that architectural objects may count as successes\nor failures depending on different states of affairs, context, or\nremarkably small differences.  Thus, a given architectural object may\nbe a failure as an active and integral built structure but not as a\nruin (or vice-versa). This suggests that background\nintentions may matter at one early stage, and less so at later stages\nin the life of a built structure\u2014and that failure may have one\ncriterion for architectural abstracta and other criteria for\ncounterpart concreta. Further, among architectural objects with\nstandard, closely related variants, some may fail while others\nsucceed\u2014perhaps because of a minor distinction such as a\ngarishly painted exterior. A viable account of architectural failure\naccommodates such features or else devolves failure to the level of\nsome single dimension of architectural objects, such as their putative\nnature as art objects (failed or otherwise).\nCorruption, Ruins, and Preservation. Architectural\nobjects as physically instantiated are corrupted or fall apart over\ntime, and may develop new forms in disrepair or as ruins. From an\ninclusivist, concretist standpoint, a ruin is not any lesser an\narchitectural object than its corresponding newly built structure. An\ninclusivism is available to the abstractist, too, though she will not\nsee them as the same object\u2014and will rate them both as somehow\nlesser than the originary object. If we take them as the same\narchitectural objects, we need an account as to how they relate to one\nanother\u2014apparently not by reference to intentions. Even if an\narchitect designed a path to a ruin state, the actual ruin-state would\nlikely take on a wholly different shape. Some may take this as an\nargument against inclusivism.\nArchitects typically embrace the Vitruvian premium on\nfirmitas and reasonably assume that built objects should\nendure\u2014and that they serve intended functions for as long as is\ndesirable. That pair of assumptions in design thinking is at odds with\nconcretism, given corruption and decay of physical constructions as\nwell as routine repurposing in the lives of built structures.  The\nfirst assumption is consistent with an abstractist vision of\neverlasting architectural objects. Endurance of serving intended\nfunctions is another story: for architectural abstracta, stipulation\nof repurposing may not change the nature of a given, selfsame\nobject. Depending on degrees of stringency in defining an\nobject\u2019s parameters, corresponding changes in design may bring\nabout an entirely new object or nearby counterpart.\nCorruption brings not only total destruction and absence of\npreviously intact built structures, but also enduring ruins or flawed,\ndamaged structures. There is a longstanding premium on ruins in\narchitectural culture as promoting historical perspective, nostalgia,\nand at least one style (Romanticism). Yet ruins fit awkwardly, if at\nall, into standard architectural ontologies. The cultural premium is\nhard to explain for the abstractist, for whom ruins represent\ndefective physical instantiations, which are already substandard in\nthe abstractist worldview. They are even harder to match up with a\nconcretist account as there aren\u2019t underlying creative\nintentions to build (except in ironic or kitsch building of \u201cnew\nruins\u201d). Corresponding intentions instead typically concern\npreservation, restoration, or elimination.  Alternatively, Bicknell\n(2014) suggests we think of ruins as part-objects that, along with\nfull-blown \u201carchitectural ghosts\u201d, represent past objects\nin their intact, built glory and as corresponded to creator\nintent. \nPreservation and conservation possibilities prompt additional\nconsiderations, such as whether restoration or maintenance of a built\nstructure sustains it as an authentic architectural whole\u2014and if\nthis is independent of functional integrity, or holds for wholesale\nreconstructions (Wicks 1994); what conditions warrant preserving or\nconserving a built structure; and what principles guide warranted\nalterations or completions of built structures\u2014and whether other\nconsiderations may include creativity, fancy, or sensitivity to\ncontemporary needs and context (Capdevila-Werning 2013). As concerns\ncompleting unfinished structures, one issue is whether it is possible\nto discern original design intent altogether. Taken together with\ncontemporary norms that shape our understanding of past architecture\n(Spector 2001), preservation and conservation are at least partly\nbound to present-day design conceptions.\nBuilt Versus Natural Environment. We typically\ntake built and natural environments to be clearly distinct. This\ndistinction does at least two kinds of work in philosophy of\narchitecture. For one, it helps establish what sorts of things we\nwould discount as architecture even on an inclusivist\nconception\u2014and even there, we might accept lived-in caves as\nfound architecture but reject most other elements of the\nnatural environment as non-architecture (because neither built nor\nfound). For another, we get a defined sense of natural contexts into\nwhich built environments fit (or not), without which any such notions\nof fit are incoherent. If this is a viable (and desirable)\ndistinction, it is perhaps less clear in what it consists. One\ncandidate view is that we may distinguish the kinds of environments by\ntheir different sorts of objects and properties: we find columns in\nbuilt environments and trees in natural environments and never the\nother way around. Alternatives highlight the ascribable functions and\nintent that mark built environments but not natural environments; or\ndifferent sorts of behavior and obligations attached to the two kinds\nof environments. While an artifact-centered view of architecture\nweighs in favor of functions and intent as the most relevant\ndistinction, decaying value of design intent over the life of a built\nstructure may give pause.\nHuman and Non-Human Architecture. What we\ntypically refer to as \u201carchitecture\u201d is human\narchitecture. This raises the question as to whether human\narchitecture is assimilable to a larger class of animal-built\nstructures.  That would suggest, in turn, that we could assess human\narchitecture\u2014including settlement patterns, individual\nstructures, and built community environments\u2014in ecological,\nanimal behavioral, and evolutionary terms (Hansell 2007). If these are\nfundamental vantage points for understanding human architecture, that\nwould suggest a need to translate all going accounts\u2014whether\nfocused on aesthetics, utility, or other concerns\u2014into\ncorresponding biological terms. One way to resist this move is to mark\nhuman architecture as a particularly human endeavor and\ncreation\u2014likely by reference to intentionality, as flows into\naesthetic focus. However, this may just forestall the question as to\nhow to account for that wrinkle\u2014a particularly talented\nanimal builder with notable design intent\u2014in the larger story of\nanimal builders most of whom have less or no such intent.\nEnvironmental Psychology as Magic Pill. Another\nscientific challenge to traditional philosophy of architecture emerges\nin environmental psychology, which identifies ways that environmental\nfactors such as color, shape, light, and circulatory pattern shape our\nvisual reactions and behavioral patterns within and around the built\nenvironment. From such empirical insights, we can fashion constraints\non architectural design principles that guide architectural creation,\nand devise corresponding solutions to particular design problems. As\narchitects learn to exploit this information to advance design, we may\nask whether an architectural object may be optimized by the lights of\nenvironmental psychology yet\u2014and even\nconsequently\u2014deficient in some other, architecturally\ncentral respect. Satisfying an architectural object\u2019s intended\nfunction or maximizing its utility may well include, or be advanced\nby, keen attention to environmental factors that influence attitudes\nto and use of that object. By contrast, moral or aesthetic\ndeficiencies where environmental conditions are optimal seem real\npossibilities. A resulting question is whether, and to what degree, we\ncould or should abandon moral or aesthetic drivers in architectural\ndesign if in the future we could design architectural objects to\noptimize environmental factors and so meet cognitive and emotional\nneeds, thereby enhancing an architectural object\u2019s reception but\nat moral or aesthetic expense.\n",
