    "main_text": "Contractarianism and Justice || Scanlon\n5.3 Scanlon\n\nScanlon (1998) does not attempt to deliver a theory of justice in the\nsame sense as Rawls, but his contractarian account of that part of\nmorality that specifies \u2018what we owe to each other\u2019 covers\nmuch of the same terrain (for an explicit attempt to analyse justice\nin Scanlonian terms, see Barry 1995). Like Rawls, Scanlon is concerned\nto develop an alternative to utilitarianism, and he does so by\ndeveloping a test that any candidate moral principle must pass: it\nmust be such that no-one could reasonably reject it as the basis for\ninformed, unforced general agreement (see the entry on\n contractualism).\n Scanlon\u2019s contractors are not positioned behind a veil of\nignorance. They are able to see what effect adopting any proposed\nprinciple would have on them personally. If that effect is\nunacceptable to them, they are permitted to reject it. Each person\nhas, so to speak, a veto on any general principle for regulating\nconduct. Those that survive this test are defensible as principles of\njustice \u2013 Scanlon concedes that there might be alternative sets\nof such principles appropriate to different social conditions.\n\nIt might seem, however, that giving each person a veto would lead\nstraightforwardly to deadlock, since anyone might reject a principle\nunder which he fared badly relative to some alternative. Here the idea\nof reasonable rejection becomes important. It would not,\nScanlon thinks, be reasonable to reject a principle under which one\ndoes badly if the alternatives all involve someone else faring worse\nstill. One needs to take account of other people\u2019s reasons for\nrejecting these alternatives. It might then appear that\nScanlon\u2019s contractualism yields the difference principle, which\nrequires the worst-off group in society to be as well of as they can\nbe. But this is not the conclusion that Scanlon draws (though he\nacknowledges that there might be special reasons to follow Rawls in\nrequiring basic social institutions to follow the difference\nprinciple). The claims of other groups must be considered too. If a\npolicy greatly benefits many others, while slightly worsening the\nposition of a few, though without leaving them very badly off, it may\nwell not be rejectable. Scanlon\u2019s position leaves some room for\naggregation \u2013 it makes a difference how many people will be\nbenefitted if a principle is followed \u2013 though not the simple\nform of aggregation that utilitarians defend.\n\nScanlon also says that a person can have a reason for rejecting a\nprinciple if it treats them unfairly, say by benefitting some but not\nothers for arbitrary reasons. This presupposes a norm of fairness that\nthe contractarian theory does not itself attempt to explain or\njustify. So it looks as though the purpose of the theory is to provide\na distinctive account of moral reasoning (and moral motivation) but\nnot to defend any substantive principles of distributive justice. In\nthis respect, Scanlon\u2019s contractualism is less ambitious than\neither Gauthier\u2019s or Rawls\u2019.\n",
