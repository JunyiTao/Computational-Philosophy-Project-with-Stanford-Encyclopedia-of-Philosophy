    "main_text": "Classification of Inheritance Systems || Niche Construction Theory and Ecological Inheritance\n3.4 Niche Construction Theory and Ecological Inheritance\n\nNiche construction theory (Odling-Smee, Laland, & Feldman 2003)\nespouses the notion of ecological inheritance through which\nprevious generations as well as current neighbors can affect organisms\nby altering the external environment or niche that they experience.\nThis purportedly creates an inheritance channel that operates in\nparallel with genetic inheritance. Ecological inheritance is defined\nas the inheritance of selection pressures that were modified by niche\nconstruction activities (Odling-Smee 2010: 176). Niche construction\nleads to ecological inheritance if changes to the ecological niche\npersist or accumulate and establish modified selection pressures. Note\nthat while the notion of ecological inheritance suggests viewing niche\nconstruction as a transmission process, the focus on the modifications\ndone to the niche highlights persistence. Extending the notion of\necological inheritance to the realm of development, Odling-Smee (2010:\n181) defines niche inheritance as the inheritance of an\ninitial organism-environment relationship, or \u201cniche,\u201d\nfrom ancestors. Niche inheritance can thus affect organisms\u2019\ndevelopment directly, rather than through selection. For a recent\ndiscussion of the differences between selective niche construction and\ndevelopmental niche construction see Stotz (2017).\n\nOdling-Smee et al. (2003) note that ecological inheritance \u201cmore\nclosely resembles the inheritance of territory or property than it\ndoes the inheritance of genes.\u201d In particular, it includes\ntransmission of material resources that are difficult to construe as\ninformational. Odling-Smee (2010: 181) enumerates fundamental\ndifferences between ecological inheritance and genetic inheritance:\n(1) Ecological inheritance is transmitted through an external\nenvironment. It is not transmitted by reproduction. (2) Ecological\ninheritance need not depend on the transmission of discrete\nreplicators (though this mechanism is not ruled out). (3) Ecological\ninheritance is continuously transmitted by multiple organisms, to\nmultiple other organisms, within and between generations, throughout\nthe lifetime of organisms. (4) Ecological inheritance is not always\ntransmitted by genetic relatives. It should be noted that some of\nthese properties of ecological inheritance are shared by extra-genetic\ninheritance more generally.\n\nOdling-Smee (2010) distinguishes two transmission channels:\ntransmission through direct connection during reproduction between the\ninternal environments of parent and offspring and transmission through\nan external environment. In channel 1, the internal environment,\nOdling-Smee includes Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s genetic and\nepigenetic inheritance systems, and some kinds of maternal effects. In\nchannel 2, transmission through an external environment, he includes\nthe inheritance of modified selection pressures in the external\nenvironments of organisms as a consequence of prior communicative\nniche construction, and includes Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s\nbehavioral and symbolic inheritance systems. All the inheritance\nsystems just mentioned transmit semantic information, according to\nOdling-Smee. In addition, both transmission channels are used to\ntransmit energy and matter. Cytoplasmic inheritance of various kinds,\nand some kinds of maternal effects, are considered by Odling-Smee to\nbe energy and material resources transmitted through the internal\nenvironment, and traditional ecological inheritance of selection\npressures is non-semantic inheritance that is passed through an\nexternal environment.\n",
