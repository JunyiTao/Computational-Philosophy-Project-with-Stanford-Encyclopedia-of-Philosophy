    "main_text": "Consciousness\n8. Later Objections to the Identity Theory\n\n\nMention should here be made of influential criticisms of the identity\ntheory by Saul Kripke and David Chalmers respectively. It will not be\npossible to discuss them in great detail, partly because of the fact\nthat Kripke's remarks rely on views about modality, possible worlds\nsemantics, and essentialism which some philosophers would want to\ncontest, and because Chalmers' long and rich book would deserve a\nlengthy answer. Kripke (1980) calls an expression a rigid designator if\nit refers to the same object in every possible world. Or in counterpart\ntheory it would have an exactly similar counterpart in every possible\nworld. It seems to me that what we count as counterparts is highly\ncontextual. Take the example \u2018water is H2O\u2019. In\nanother world, or in a twin earth in our world as Putnam imagines\n(1975), the stuff found in rivers, lakes, the sea would not be\nH2O but XYZ and so would not be water. This is certainly\ngiving preference to real chemistry over folk chemistry, and so far I\napplaud this. There are therefore contexts in which we say that on twin\nearth or the envisaged possible world the stuff found in rivers would\nnot be water. Nevertheless there are contexts in which we could\nenvisage a possible world (write a science fiction novel) in which\nbeing found in rivers and lakes and the sea, assuaging thirst and\nsustaining life was more important than the chemical composition and so\nXYZ would be the counterpart of H2O. \n\n\nKripke considers the identity \u2018heat = molecular motion\u2019,\nand holds that this is true in every possible world and so is a\nnecessary truth. Actually the proposition is not quite true, for what\nabout radiant heat? What about heat as defined in classical\nthermodynamics which is \u2018topic neutral\u2019 compared with\nstatistical thermodynamics? Still, suppose that heat has an essence and\nthat it is molecular motion, or at least is in the context envisaged.\nKripke says (1980, p. 151) that when we think that molecular motion\nmight exist in the absence of heat we are confusing this with thinking\nthat the molecular motion might have existed without being\nfelt as heat. He asks whether it is analogously possible that\nif pain is a certain sort of brain process that it has existed without\nbeing felt as pain. He suggests that the answer is\n\u2018No\u2019. An identity theorist who accepted the account of\nconsciousness as a higher order perception could answer\n\u2018Yes\u2019. We might be aware of a damaged tooth and also of\nbeing in an agitation condition (to use Ryle's term for emotional\nstates) without being aware of our awareness. An identity theorist such\nas Smart would prefer talk of \u2018having a pain\u2019 rather than\nof \u2018pain\u2019: pain is not part of the furniture of the world\nany more than a sense datum or the average plumber is. Kripke concludes\n(p. 152) that the\napparent contingency of the connection between the mental\nstate and the corresponding brain state thus cannot be explained by\nsome sort of qualitative analogue as in the case of heat.\n\n\nSmart would say that there is a sense in which the connection of\nsensations (sensings) and brain processes is only half contingent. A\ncomplete description of the brain state or process (including causes\nand effects of it) would imply the report of inner experience, but the\nlatter, being topic neutral and so very abstract would not imply the\nneurological description.\n\n\nChalmers (1996) in the course of his exhaustive study of\nconsciousness developed a theory of non-physical qualia which to some\nextent avoids the worry about nomological danglers. The worry expressed\nby Smart (1959) is that if there were non-physical qualia there would,\nmost implausibly, have to be laws relating neurophysiological processes\nto apparently simple properties, and the correlation laws would have to\nbe fundamental, mere danglers from the nomological net (as Feigl called\nit) of science. Chalmers counters this by supposing that the qualia are\nnot simple but unknown to us, are made up of simple proto-qualia, and\nthat the fundamental laws relating these to physical entities relate\nthem to fundamental physical entities. His view comes to a\nrather interesting panpsychism. On the other hand if the topic neutral\naccount is correct, then qualia are no more than points in a\nmultidimensional similarity space, and the overwhelming plausibility\nwill fall on the side of the identity theorist.\n\n\nOn Chalmers' view how are we aware of non-physical qualia? It has\nbeen suggested above that this inner awareness is proprioception of the\nbrain by the brain. But what sort of story is possible in the case of\nawareness of a quale? Chalmers could have some sort of answer to this\nby means of his principle of coherence according to which the causal\nneurological story parallels the story of succession of qualia. It is\nnot clear however that this would make us aware of the qualia. The\nqualia do not seem to be needed in the physiological story of how an\nantelope avoids a tiger.\n\n\nPeople often think that even if a robot could scan its own\nperceptual processes this would not mean that the robot was conscious.\nThis appeals to our intuitions, but perhaps we could reverse the\nargument and say that because the robot can be aware of its awareness\nthe robot is conscious. I have given reason above to distrust\nintuitions, but in any case Chalmers comes some of the way in that he\ntoys with the idea that a thermostat has a sort of proto-qualia. The\ndispute between identity theorists (and physicalists generally) and\nChalmers comes down to our attitude to phenomenology. Certainly walking\nin a forest, seeing the blue of the sky, the green of the trees, the\nred of the track, one may find it hard to believe that our qualia are\nmerely points in a multidimensional similarity space. But perhaps that\nis what it is like (to use a phrase that can be distrusted) to\nbe aware of a point in a multidimensional similarity space. One may\nalso, as Place would suggest, be subject to \u2018the phenomenological\nfallacy\u2019. At the end of his book Chalmers makes some speculations\nabout the interpretation of quantum mechanics. If they succeed then\nperhaps we could envisage Chalmers' theory as integrated into physics\nand him as a physicalist after all. However it could be doubted whether\nwe need to go down to the quantum level to understand consciousness or\nwhether consciousness is relevant to quantum mechanics.\n",
