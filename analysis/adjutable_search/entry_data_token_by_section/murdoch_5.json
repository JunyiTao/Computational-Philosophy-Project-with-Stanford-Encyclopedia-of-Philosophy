    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Moral reality as other persons\n5.1 Moral reality as other persons\n\nA central strand in Murdoch\u2019s view is that moral reality is\nother persons. Murdoch is not thinking of \u201cother persons\u201d\nas an aggregate, nor primarily as instances of a category. Rather a\ngiven moral agent\u2019s moral reality consists in the individual\nreality of each other person, one at a time.\n\nIn this strand, Murdoch emphasizes the complexity and difficulty of\napprehending the moral reality in question. She says that we are prone\nto fantasy and egoism (the \u201cfat, relentless ego\u201d [OGG:\n52/342]) that block us from being able to see other persons clearly;\nfrom appreciating that they are as real as oneself (SBL 1959/EM: 215);\nfrom a lived recognition of their separateness and differentness (OGG:\n66/353); and from grasping their true individual character (OGG:\n59/348). Our ego must in a way be silenced\u2014a process she refers\nto as \u201cunselfing\u201d (a concept she draws from Simone\nWeil\u2019s \u201cd\u00e9creation\u201d)\u2014in order for us to\nfully grasp reality in this\n sense.[3]\n (\u201cWe cease to be in order to attend to the existence of\nsomething else\u201d. OGG: 59/349) Murdoch\u2019s novels frequently\nportray characters lost in their own world who see others primarily\nthrough their own fantasies of them. But Murdoch also emphasizes a\nmore general contingency and idiosyncrasy of persons, resulting in a\ngeneral opaqueness of persons to each other, a point apparently\nindependent of the one about fantasy and egoism, though complementing\nit.\n\nMurdoch thinks grasping the reality of the other comes in degrees,\nthat extend to a \u201cperfect\u201d understanding of another, a\nstate that can be aimed at but not actually attained. She often speaks\nof levels of understanding\u2014of persons, concepts, ideas\u2014an\nidea she increasingly comes to associate with Plato, and that she\nconnects with a \u201cperfectionism\u201d that holds out the perfect\nunderstanding as a (moral) standard (IP: 29/322; OGG: 61/350). The\nmoral challenge of knowing the other differs for each individual agent\nbecause each agent encounters different people, but also because the\ntask and challenge of knowing differs for each agent in relation to\neach other person.\n\nSometimes Murdoch expresses the \u201cother persons\u201d strand in\nmore general terms\u2014not only individual persons but\n\u201cindividual realities\u201d outside the (agent\u2019s) self.\nThis can include natural objects such as a tree or an individual\nanimal, but also non-animate and conceptual objects such as a language\nor a subject matter, and also situations. She sometimes, and\nincreasingly so in Metaphysics, sees an appreciation of all\nof reality in its manifold detail as a crucial form of moral\naspiration, and there is evidence in her novels of a special\nappreciation of natural objects, not only living beings, and not only\nas beautiful (White 2020). But more frequently Murdoch regards other\npersons specifically as the content of moral reality.\n",
