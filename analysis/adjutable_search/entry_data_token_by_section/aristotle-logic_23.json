    "main_text": "Definitions || Species, Genus, and Differentia\n7.2 Species, Genus, and Differentia\n\nSince a definition defines an essence, only what has an essence can be\ndefined. What has an essence, then? That is one of the central\nquestions of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics; once again, we must leave\nthe details to another article. In general, however, it is not\nindividuals but rather species (eidos: the\nword is one of those Plato uses for \u201cForm\u201d) that have\nessences. A species is defined by giving its genus\n(genos) and its differentia\n(diaphora): the genus is the kind under which the species\nfalls, and the differentia tells what characterizes the species within\nthat genus. As an example, human might be defined as\nanimal (the genus) having the capacity to reason\n(the differentia).\nEssential Predication and the Predicables\n\nUnderlying Aristotle\u2019s concept of a definition is the concept of\nessential predication (kat\u00eagoreisthai en\nt\u00f4i ti esti, predication in the what it is). In any true\naffirmative predication, the predicate either does or does not\n\u201csay what the subject is\u201d, i.e., the predicate either is\nor is not an acceptable answer to the question \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d asked of the subject. Bucephalus is a horse, and a horse is\nan animal; so, \u201cBucephalus is a horse\u201d and\n\u201cBucephalus is an animal\u201d are essential predications.\nHowever, \u201cBucephalus is brown\u201d, though true, does not\nstate what Bucephalus is but only says something about him.\n\nSince a thing\u2019s definition says what it is, definitions are\nessentially predicated. However, not everything essentially predicated\nis a definition. Since Bucephalus is a horse, and horses are a kind of\nmammal, and mammals are a kind of animal, \u201chorse\u201d\n\u201cmammal\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d are all essential\npredicates of Bucephalus. Moreover, since what a horse is is a kind of\nmammal, \u201cmammal\u201d is an essential predicate of horse. When\npredicate \\(X\\) is an essential predicate of \\(Y\\) but also of other\nthings, then \\(X\\) is a genus (genos) of\n\\(Y\\).\n\nA definition of \\(X\\) must not only be essentially predicated of it\nbut must also be predicated only of it: to use a term from\nAristotle\u2019s Topics, a definition and what it defines\nmust \u201ccounterpredicate\u201d\n(antikat\u00eagoreisthai) with one another. \\(X\\)\ncounterpredicates with \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\) applies to what \\(Y\\) applies to\nand conversely. Though X\u2019s definition must counterpredicate with\n\\(X\\), not everything that counterpredicates with \\(X\\) is its\ndefinition. \u201cCapable of laughing\u201d, for example,\ncounterpredicates with \u201chuman\u201d but fails to be its\ndefinition. Such a predicate (non-essential but counterpredicating) is\na peculiar property or proprium\n(idion).\n\nFinally, if \\(X\\) is predicated of \\(Y\\) but is neither essential nor\ncounterpredicates, then \\(X\\) is an accident\n(sumbeb\u00eakos) of \\(Y\\).\n\nAristotle sometimes treats genus, peculiar property, definition, and\naccident as including all possible predications (e.g. Topics\nI). Later commentators listed these four and the differentia as the\nfive predicables, and as such they were of great\nimportance to late ancient and to medieval philosophy (e.g.,\nPorphyry).\n",
