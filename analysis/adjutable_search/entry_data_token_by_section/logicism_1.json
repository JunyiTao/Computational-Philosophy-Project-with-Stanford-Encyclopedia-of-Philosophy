    "main_text": "Historical background || Dedekind\n1.1 Dedekind\n\nIt is fair to say that Dedekind enabled the trend of arithmetization\nto culminate in the doctrine of logicism. The recommendation (or\nstatement of the methodological maxim) that one ought to\navoid all matters geometric when providing a foundation for real\nanalysis goes back at least to Dedekind, Stetigkeit und\nIrrationale Zahlen (1872). This work was published late. Its\nbreakthrough idea had come fourteen years earlier, in\n 1858.[6]\n At pages 3\u20134 Dedekind writes in an engaging and revelatory way\nof his earlier struggle in the autumn of 1858 to furnish\n\u201ceine wirklich wissenschaftliche Begr\u00fcndung der\nArithmetik\u201d (a really scientific foundation for Arithmetic\n[i.e., real\n analysis]).[7]\n\nIt is clear that Dedekind is writing on the\npresumption\u2014assumed to be so widespread as not to call\nfor any justificatory argument\u2014that one should have no\nrecourse at all to geometric intuitions or first principles when\nfounding the theory of the real numbers. This presumption, said\nDedekind, \u2018no one will deny\u2019. Dedekind wanted \u201ca\npurely arithmetical and perfectly rigorous foundation for the\nprinciples of infinitesimal analysis\u201d [Emphases\n added].[8]\n\nThe presumption receives further emphatic statement in\nDedekind\u2019s later work (1888) Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen?, which, like the earlier work, was published much later\nthan it could (or should) have been. In the preface to the first\nedition (Dedekind 1996b: 790\u20131) Dedekind writes\n\n\nIn speaking of arithmetic (algebra, analysis) as merely part of logic\nI mean to imply that I consider the number-concept entirely\nindependent of the notions or intuitions of space and\ntime\u2014that I rather consider it an immediate product of the\npure laws of thought.\u2026 It is only through the purely logical\nprocess of building up the science of numbers and by thus acquiring\nthe continuous number-domain that we are enabled accurately to\ninvestigate our notions of space and time by bringing them into\nrelation with this number-domain created in our mind.[fn] [Emphasis\nadded]\n\n\nOnce again we see the presumption at work: in laying a foundation for\nthe theory of real numbers, one must avoid any recourse to\ngeometrical intuition. To inquire how such a presumption become so\nwidespread, and in whose works it originated, is a topic outside the\nscope of the present study.\n",
