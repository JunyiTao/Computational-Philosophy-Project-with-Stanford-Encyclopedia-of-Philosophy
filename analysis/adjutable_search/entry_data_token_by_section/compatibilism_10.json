    "main_text": "Compatibilism in Transition || A Challenge to the Principle of Alternative Possibilities\n3.2 A Challenge to the Principle of Alternative Possibilities\n\nOne compatibilist strategy for responding to the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument is to concede that perhaps the Consequence\nArgument provides us with good reason for thinking that determinism\nrules out the ability to do otherwise while maintaining that such an\nability is not necessary for free will. In other words, the\ncompatibilist might sidestep the issues raised by the Consequence\nArgument by directly attacking the first premise of the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument, which states is if a person acts of her own\nfree will, then she could have done otherwise. This compatibilist\nresponse rejects a conception of human agency that locates control in\nthe ability to do otherwise. Alternatively, it seeks to ground an\nagent\u2019s control over his action in other features of his or her\nagency. In \u201cAlternate Possibilities and Moral\nResponsibility,\u201d (1969) Harry Frankfurt powerfully develops an\nargument that gives compatibilists the resources to argue in just this\nway.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument was directed against the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP):\n\nPAP: A person is morally responsible for what she does do\nonly if she can do otherwise.\n\nCentral to Frankfurt\u2019s attack on PAP are a class of examples in\nwhich an agent is morally responsible for her conduct, but could not,\nat the time of the pertinent action, do otherwise. Here is a close\napproximation to the example Frankfurt presented in his original\npaper:\n\nJones has resolved to shoot Smith. Black has learned of Jones\u2019s\nplan and wants Jones to shoot Smith. But Black would prefer that Jones\nshoot Smith on his own. However, concerned that Jones might waver in\nhis resolve to shoot Smith, Black secretly arranges things so that, if\nJones should show any sign at all that he will not shoot Smith\n(something Black has the resources to detect), Black will be able to\nmanipulate Jones in such a way that Jones will shoot Smith. As things\ntranspire, Jones follows through with his plans and shoots Smith for\nhis own reasons. No one else in any way threatened or coerced Jones,\noffered Jones a bribe, or even suggested that he shoot Smith. Jones\nshot Smith under his own steam. Black never intervened.\n\nIn this example, Jones shot Smith on his own, and did so unencumbered\n\u2014 did so freely. But, given Black\u2019s presence in the\nscenario, Jones could not have failed to shoot Smith (i.e., he could\nnot have done otherwise). Hence, we have a counterexample to PAP.\n\nIf Frankfurt\u2019s argument against PAP is sound, the free will\ndebate has been systematically miscast through much of the history of\nphilosophy. If determinism threatens free will and moral\nresponsibility, it is not because it is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise. Even if determinism is incompatible\nwith a sort of freedom involving the ability to do otherwise, it\nis not the kind of freedom required for moral responsibility.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, an enormous (and intricate) literature has\nemerged around the success of Frankfurt\u2019s argument and, in\nparticular, around the example Frankfurt offered as contrary to PAP.\nThe debate is very much alive, and no clear victor has emerged (in the\nway that the incompatibilists can rightly claim to have laid to rest\nthe compatibilists\u2019 conditional analysis strategy (see section\n3.3)). Regardless, what is most relevant to this essay is that\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument inspired many compatibilists to begin\nthinking about accounts of freedom or control that unabashedly turn\naway from alternative possibilities.\n",
