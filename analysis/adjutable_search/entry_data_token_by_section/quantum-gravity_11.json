    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Ontology\n5.2 Ontology\n\nThe problem of time is closely connected with a general puzzle about\nthe ontology associated with \u201cquantum spacetime\u201d. Quantum\ntheory in general resists any straightforward ontological reading, and\nthis goes double for quantum gravity. In quantum mechanics,\none has particles, albeit with indefinite properties. In quantum field\ntheory, one again has particles (at least in suitably symmetric\nspacetimes), but these are secondary to the fields, which again are\nthings, albeit with indefinite properties. On the face of it, the only\ndifference in quantum gravity is that spacetime itself becomes a kind\nof quantum field, and one would perhaps be inclined to say that the\nproperties of spacetime become indefinite. But space and time\ntraditionally play important roles in individuating objects and their\nproperties\u2014in fact a field is in some sense a set of properties\nof spacetime points \u2014 and so the quantization of such raises\nreal problems for ontology.\n\nOne area that philosophers might profit from is in the investigation\nof the relational observables that appear to be necessitated by\ndiffeomorphism invariance. For example, since symmetries (such as the\ngauge symmetries associated with the constraints) come with quite a\nlot of metaphysical baggage attached (as philosophers of physics know\nfrom the\n hole argument),\n such a move involves philosophically weighty assumptions. For\nexample, the presence of symmetries in a theory would appear to allow\nfor more possibilities than one without, so eradicating the symmetries\n(by solving the constraints and going to the reduced, physical phase\nspace) means eradicating a chunk of possibility space: in particular,\none is eradicating states that are deemed to be physically equivalent,\ndespite having some formal differences in terms of representaton.\nHence, imposing the constraints involves some serious modal\nassumptions. Belot and Earman (2001) have argued that since the\ntraditional positions on the ontology of spacetime (relationalism and\nsubstantivalism) involve a commitment to a certain way of counting\npossibilities, the decision to eliminate symmetries can have serious\nimplications for the ontology one can then adopt. Further, if some\nparticular method (out of retaining or eliminating symmetries) were\nshown to be successful in the quest for quantizing gravity, then, they\nargue, one could have good scientific reasons for favouring one of\nsubstantivalism or relationalism. (See Belot, 2011a, for more on this\nargument; Rickles, 2008c, explicitly argues against the idea that\npossibility spaces have any relevance for spacetime ontology.)\n\nIn the loop quantum gravity program, the area and volume operators\nhave discrete spectra. Thus, like electron spins, they can\nonly take certain values. This suggests (but does not imply) that\nspace itself has a discrete nature, and perhaps time as well\n(depending on how one resolves the problem of time). This in turn\nsuggests that space does not have the structure of a differential\nmanifold, but rather that it only approximates such a manifold on\nlarge scales, or at low energies. A similar idea, that classical\nspacetime is an emergent entity, can be found in several\napproaches to quantum gravity (see Butterfield and Isham, 1999 and\n2001, for a discussion of emergence in quantum gravity). The\npossibility that a continuous structure (with continuous symmetries)\ncould emerge from a fundamentally discrete structure is a problem with\na clear philosophical flavour \u2014Huggett and W\u00fcthrich, eds.\n(2013) contains a variety of papers investigating this issue, with\ntheir own contribution focusing on the notion of recovering\n\u2018local beables\u2019 from such emergent theories. \n",
