    "main_text": "The aftermath of the Principia II: debates with Leibniz\n6. The aftermath of the Principia II: debates with Leibniz\n\nIn many ways, Leibniz and Newton grew up in the same philosophical\nenvironment. Each came of age during the heyday of Cartesianism, and\neach argued in particular that Cartesian views in natural philosophy\nfailed to include a sufficiently robust conception of the forces of\nbodies in nature. Force would lie at the center of Newton\u2019s\nmature physics (Westfall 1971), and would become even more central to\nLeibniz\u2019s thinking, playing an essential role in his metaphysics\nas well (Garber 2012). Indeed, in Leibniz\u2019s criticisms of\nCartesian physics involving what was later called the vis viva\ncontroversy (Smith 2006) and in Newton\u2019s mature physics,\neach argued that Descartes and his followers had failed to understand\nthe importance of the notion of force. Leibniz and Newton knew one\nanother as mathematicians already in the 1670s, and as we have seen,\nLeibniz discussed Newton\u2019s first optical work with Huygens. But\nafter the publication of the Principia in 1687, their\nphilosophical relationship, which was marked originally by respectful\ndisagreement, began to develop in earnest. Just two years after the\nPrincipia appeared, Leibniz published his Essay on the\nCauses of Celestial Motions (or Tentamen), and then in\n1693, the two corresponded with one another on mathematical and\nphilosophical issues (Newton 2004: 106\u20139). Leibniz initiated\ntheir discussion in March of 1693: after highlighting Newton\u2019s\n\u201castonishing discovery\u201d that the elliptical planetary\norbits found by Kepler can be the result of gravitational attraction\nwithin the solar system, Leibniz contends that these motions must be\ncaused by \u201cthe motion of a fluid medium\u201d (Newton 2004:\n106). He had described such a fluid medium, or vortex, in detail in\nhis own Essay. The background to Leibniz\u2019s comment is\nhis unwavering commitment\u2014one shared by Huygens, whose theory of\ngravity\u2019s cause Leibniz mentions in the same letter\u2014to the\nmechanist requirement that all changes in motion must be the result of\nmaterial impact. Thus for Leibniz, one can (e.g.) speak of the sun as\nattracting the earth as a fa\u00e7on de parler, but in fact\nthe cause of the earth\u2019s acceleration, of its true motion around\nthe sun, is its interaction with a fluid medium. (Descartes was also a\nfamous proponent of a vortex theory of planetary motion\u2014Aiton\n1972: 30\u201364; Gaukroger 2002: 150\u20133.) When he replied in\nOctober of 1693, however, Newton did not accept Leibniz\u2019s\nphilosophical olive branch. Leibniz had insisted that the vortex\ntheory of planetary motion \u201cwould not at all detract from the\nvalue and truth of your discovery\u201d that Kepler\u2019s ellipses\nresult simply from the conception of attraction or gravitation (Newton\n2004: 107). This olive branch was important because earlier vortex\ntheorists, especially Descartes, had failed to account for\nKepler\u2019s laws, so Leibniz was crediting Newton with advancing\nastronomy in this respect (and indeed, he attempted to reflect\nKepler\u2019s results in his Tentamen). But Newton brushed\naside the olive branch, noting that vortices would disturb the motions\nof planets and comets through the solar system. He writes that some\n\u201cvery fine\u201d matter fills the heavens, adding:\n\n\nFor since celestial motions are more regular than if they arose from\nvortices and observe other laws, so much so that vortices contribute\nnot to the regulation but the disturbance of the motions of planets\nand comets; and since all phenomena of the heavens and of the sea\nfollow precisely, so far as I am aware, from nothing but gravity\nacting in accordance with the laws described by me; and since nature\nis very simple, I have myself concluded that all other causes are to\nbe rejected and that the heavens are to be stripped as far as may be\nof all matter, lest the motions of planets and comets be hindered or\nrendered irregular. But if, meanwhile, someone explains gravity along\nwith all its laws by the action of some subtle matter, and shows that\nthe motion of planets and comets will not be disturbed by this matter,\nI shall be far from objecting. (Newton 2004: 108\u20139)\n\n\nThis is a passage rich with meaning. Leibniz clearly insisted that\nvortices, or some physical object or fluid, must be in contact with\nthe planetary orbits if we are to explain why they deviate from the\ntangents along the orbital paths when circling the sun. Newton\u2019s\nreply is that giant swirling fluids in the heavens would actually\ndisturb the regular orbital paths and the paths of comets through the\nsolar system. That reply might be thought of as empirical in\ncharacter, for it depends on observational data regarding the actual\npaths of the heavenly bodies. But Leibinz\u2019s perspective is\nobviously not merely empirical in character: he does not postulate\nvortices (or anything akin to them) on observational grounds; he\ninfers their existence because he thinks we know (perhaps we can add,\nwe know a priori) that physical bodies such as comets or\nplanets can deviate from a rectilinear path\u2014they can\naccelerate\u2014only if some other physical item impacts upon them.\nNewton has a reply to that kind of view as well: he insists that the\nphenomena of the motion of the heavenly bodies \u201cfollows\u201d\nsolely from gravity itself\u2014an impressed force, as we have seen,\nand therefore an \u201caction\u201d\u2014in accordance with the\nlaws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Since gravity is\nan action\u2014clearly, a causal notion\u2014it seems clear that\nNewton\u2019s answer to Leibniz\u2019s idea that vortices cause the\nplanetary orbits is that gravity itself causes them. It is not much of\na leap to conclude, in turn, that this reply commits Newton to the\nidea that bodies involved in gravitational interactions, such as the\nsun and the earth, act at a distance on one another through the force\nof gravity. It is not hard to divine why Leibniz (and Huygens) would\nhave concluded that Newton had relinquished any commitment to the\nnorms of the mechanical philosophy.\n\nDespite Leibniz\u2019s (and Huygens\u2019s) criticisms of his theory\nof gravity in particular, and his methods in natural philosophy in\ngeneral, Newton stuck to his guns. Nearly twenty years after their\nilluminating exchange in 1693, Leibniz and Newton narrowly missed a\nsecond opportunity to discuss their philosophical differences\ndirectly. In May of 1712, Leibniz published a letter to Nicholas\nHartsoeker that was highly critical of the Newtonians; it was\npublished in English translation in the Memoirs of\nLiterature, a journal to which Roger Cotes, the editor of the\nPrincipia\u2019s second edition, held a subscription (Newton\n2004: 109). After Cotes brought Leibniz\u2019s criticisms to\nNewton\u2019s attention\u2014especially the claim that the\nPrincipia renders gravitation a \u201cperpetual\nmiracle\u201d because it does not specify the physical mechanism\nunderlying it\u2014Newton wrote an intriguing, but only posthumously\npublished, rebuttal. Here is part of Newton\u2019s paraphrase of\nLeibniz\u2019s original letter:\n\n\nBut he [i.e., Leibniz] goes on and tells us that God could not create\nplanets that should move round of themselves without any cause that\nshould prevent their removing through the tangent. For a miracle at\nleast must keep the planet in. (Newton 2004: 117)\n\n\nNewton\u2019s response to this Leibnizian charge is illuminating:\n\n\nBut certainly God could create planets that should move round of\nthemselves without any other cause than gravity that should prevent\ntheir removing through the tangent. For gravity without a miracle may\nkeep the planets in. (ibid.)\n\n\nThus Newton repeats the view he mentions to Leibniz in 1693, viz.,\nthat the force of gravity itself causes the planets to follow their\norbital paths rather than their inertial trajectories along the\ntangents to those orbits, independently of any fluid medium in the\nheavens. But in this posthumously published letter, Newton did not\nmerely repeat his basic understanding of gravity from his 1693\nexchange with Leibniz; he also included a wider discussion of\nmechanist norms within philosophy more generally. Again, Newton begins\nby quoting Leibniz:\n\n\nBut Mr. Leibniz goes on. \u201cThe ancients and the moderns, who own\nthat gravity is an occult quality, are in the right, if they mean by\nit that there is a certain mechanism unknown to them whereby all\nbodies tend towards the center of the earth. But if they mean that the\nthing is performed without any mechanism by a simple primitive quality\nor by a law of God who produces that effect without using any\nintelligible means, it is an unreasonable and occult quality, and so\nvery occult that it is impossible that it should ever be done though\nan angel or God himself should undertake to explain it\u201d. (Newton\n2004: 116)\n\n\nIn this passage, Leibniz returns to the kind of criticism that he\nwould present against the \u201csuperaddition\u201d view that Locke\npresented to Stillingfleet, arguing that philosophers must reject the\nidea that gravity could simply be a feature of bodies that God adds to\nthem, despite the fact that we cannot possibly understand\ngravitational interactions based on our idea of body (our idea of\nextended solid substances, or another similar idea). Indeed, Leibniz\nraises the stakes by contending that God himself could not explicate\nhow such interactions are possible based on the idea of matter.\nLeibniz would argue, perhaps on metaphysical grounds, that any laws\nsaid to govern the interaction of bodies, and any qualities attributed\nto bodies, must be intelligible in the terms available to philosophers\nthrough the mechanist orientation. In particular, laws and qualities\nmust be intelligible in terms of the shape, size, motion and\nimpenetrability (or solidity) of bodies. In this way, one might\nconclude that Locke and Leibniz actually do not necessarily disagree\non whether gravity can be made intelligible in mechanist terms; they\nsimply disagree on the propriety of the contention that God could\n\u201csuperadd\u201d a feature to bodies that cannot be made\nintelligible in that way.\n\nNewton\u2019s reply to Leibniz\u2019s argument is illuminating.\nInstead of presenting a narrow defense of his view, perhaps by denying\nthat he has postulated any non-mechanical causation with his theory of\ngravity, he challenges the mechanical philosophy itself by contending\nthat it should not be understood as holding for all natural\nphenomena:\n\n\nThe same ought to be said of hardness. So then gravity and hardness\nmust go for unreasonable occult qualities unless they can be explained\nmechanically. And why may not the same be said of the vis\ninertiae [force of inertia] and the extension, the duration and\nmobility of bodies, and yet no man ever attempted to explain these\nqualities mechanically, or took them for miracles or supernatural\nthings or fictions or occult qualities. They are the natural, real,\nreasonable, manifest qualities of all bodies seated in them by the\nwill of God from the beginning of the creation and perfectly incapable\nof being explained mechanically, and so may be the hardness of\nprimitive particles of bodies. And therefore if any man should say\nthat bodies attract one another by a power whose cause is unknown to\nus, or by a power seated in the frame of nature by the will of God, or\nby a power seated in a substance in which bodies move and float\nwithout resistance and which has therefore no vis inertiae\nbut acts by other laws than those that are mechanical: I know not why\nhe should be said to introduce miracles and occult qualities and\nfictions into the world. For Mr. Leibniz himself will scarce say that\nthinking is mechanical as it must be if to explain it otherwise be to\nmake a miracle, an occult quality, and a fiction. (Newton 2004:\n116)\n\n\nThe first aspect of Newton\u2019s argument is to indicate that\nmechanical explanations are predicated on referencing certain kinds of\nqualities when investigating natural phenomena, and that these\nqualities themselves are therefore not subject to mechanical\nexplanation. For instance, since mechanist explanations\u2014say, of\nthe way in which magnets attract iron filings across a\ntable\u2014must refer to qualities such as the extension of the\nbodies subject to the explanations, then we cannot give a mechanist\nexplanation of extension itself. Of course, Leibniz might reply that\nwe need not provide any explanation of the basic qualities of bodies\nthat figure in mechanical explanations, for those properties have been\nchosen by the \u201cmoderns\u201d precisely because they are\nperfectly intelligible on their own, perhaps unlike various qualities\nattributed to \u201cScholastic\u201d accounts of natural phenomena.\nThe second aspect of Newton\u2019s argument is more\nintriguing\u2014it also harkens back to Locke\u2019s discussion with\nStillingfleet, for Locke had contended that God may have superadded\nnot only gravity to material bodies, but also the power of thought,\nlinking them because he believed that neither could be rendered\nintelligible using any philosophical means at his disposal. That is,\nfrom Locke\u2019s point of view, we know that human\nbeings\u2014which are, or at least contain, material bodies with\nsize, shape, motion and solidity, along with parts characterized by\nthose qualities\u2014are capable of thought, but since we cannot\ndiscern how any material thing could possibly have that capacity, we\nconclude that God may have superadded that feature to us, or to our\nbodies. Thought and gravity are dis-analogous in the sense that we did\nnot require anything like Newton\u2019s theory to convince us that\nhuman beings can think, but they are otherwise analogous. Newton then\nattempts to make the following argument: since Leibniz would have to\nagree that thinking is not a mechanical process, and not mechanically\nexplicable, he must agree that there is at least one aspect of the\nworld that has the following two features, (1) it is not mechanical;\nand, (2) it is clearly not to be rejected on that ground alone. He\nattempts to liken gravity (as he understands it) to\nthinking (as he believes Leibniz is required to understand\nit), arguing that despite the fact that it is not mechanical\u2014it\ncannot be explained mechanically\u2014it should not be rejected on\nthat ground. This argument may be predicated on the view that human\nbeings, material things, or at least partially material things, do the\nthinking, rather than immaterial things, such as minds or souls, for\nif one attributes all thought to an immaterial mind or soul, then\nthere is no pressure to say that anything in nature, or perhaps even\nany aspect of anything in nature, has a feature that cannot be\nmechanically explicated. If one accepts Locke\u2019s view (apparently\nalso endorsed by Newton) that we should attribute thinking to material\nthings, or to aspects of material things, then perhaps Newton has\nsuccessfully followed Locke in likening gravity to thought, thereby\nmaking room for aspects of nature that are not mechanical after all.\nThis vexing issue would continue to generate debates amongst\nNewton\u2019s and Leibniz\u2019s various followers in England, and\non the Continent, respectively.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s most extensive debate with the Newtonians would not\noccur until the very end of his life. His celebrated correspondence\nwith Samuel Clarke, Newton\u2019s friend and supporter in London in\nthe early part of the eighteenth century, is his most famous\ninteraction with the Newtonians, occurring right before his death in\n1716 (Clarke and Leibniz 1717). Leibniz fomented the correspondence in\nNovember of 1715 by sending a brief, provocative letter to Princess\nCaroline of Wales, one designed to provoke a response from\nNewton\u2019s circle in London. Leibniz knew well that Princess\nCaroline was a leading intellectual and political figure in England at\nthe time, one who would surely be concerned by Leibniz\u2019s\nshocking claims about the religious consequences of Newtonian\nthinking. He opens his initial letter by mentioning both Locke and\nNewton, along with the issues about materiality and thinking that\narose in his near exchange with Newton in 1712:\n\n\nNatural religion itself seems to decay [in England] very much. Many\nwill have human souls to be material; others make God himself a\ncorporeal being. Mr. Locke and his followers are uncertain at least\nwhether the soul is not material and naturally perishable. Sir Isaac\nNewton says that space is an organ which God makes use of to perceive\nthings by. But if God stands in need of any organ to perceive things\nby, it will follow that they do not depend altogether on him, nor were\nproduced by him. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 1: 1\u20133)\n\n\nThus Leibniz charges both Lockeans and Newtonians with presenting\nphilosophical views of the human and of the divine that lead to\ntheologically unsavory consequences, such as the idea that the human\nsoul might be material and the view that God must employ something\nakin to an organ in order to perceive happenings in the world. These\nwere fighting words. Although Locke had died in 1704, he had various\nfollowers in England at the time (Gascoigne 1985: 172\u20133), and\nNewton himself was at the height of his influence: he had by then been\nknighted, as Leibniz acknowledges by calling him \u201cSir\u201d in\nhis letter, and was at that time President of the Royal Society.\nMoreover, Samuel Clarke had given the Boyle lectures in 1704 and again\nin 1705, so he was a public figure associated with the state of\nChristianity in England. Once Clarke took the bait, replying that same\nmonth to Leibniz\u2019s charges, Locke\u2019s views quickly dropped\nfrom view and the two focused specifically on Leibniz\u2019s numerous\nobjections to Newtonian ideas and methods. But why did Clarke respond\non Newton\u2019s behalf, and what was Newton\u2019s actual role in\nthe correspondence? These questions continue to puzzle scholars (see\nCohen and Koyr\u00e9 1962; Bertoloni Meli 1999 and 2002; Vailati\n1997). There is no documentary evidence, such as letters, between\nClarke and Newton indicating the contours of his role; then again, at\nthis time, both men lived in London and Clarke was Newton\u2019s\nparish priest, so the lack of letters or other papers is perhaps\nunsurprising. That fact alone is intriguing, for the theological\ndifferences between the two are salient: since Newton was a committed\nanti-Trinitarian\u2014a fact known to figures like Locke and to\nothers such as William Whiston\u2014he may have decided that\nLeibniz\u2019s contentions about \u201cnatural religion\u201d in\nEngland would best be answered by what we might now call a more\nmainstream theological figure like Clarke. In any event, there is no\ndoubt that Clarke was taken by Leibniz and his followers to be\nspeaking for Newton and his circle. Nonetheless, there are certainly\naspects of Clarke\u2019s views that may deviate from Newton\u2019s\nown opinions, so it would be unwise to (as it were) remove Clarke from\nour conception of the correspondence by regarding it effectively as\nNewton\u2019s work.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s side of the correspondence with Clarke is\nmethodologically characteristic: he leaves much of his own systematic\nand complex metaphysical theorizing\u2014including the\nmonadology\u2014in the background, bringing to the fore only those\nelements that are both necessary for his criticisms of the Newtonians\nand also likely to garner support from Clarke. Thus the key to many of\nLeibniz\u2019s criticisms is the principle of sufficient reason\n(PSR), which he knows Clarke will endorse (although with a distinct\nconception of its scope: Leibniz asserts, while Clarke denies, that\nthe principle demands that each act of divine willing requires a\nreason; for Clarke, divine willing itself is reason enough for some\nphysical state of affairs to obtain, or event to occur). Leibniz\nargues in particular that several key aspects of the Newtonian\nworldview are simply incompatible with the PSR, including the idea of\nabsolute space. If space were in fact completely independent of all\nphysical objects and all relations among them, as the Newtonians seem\nto assert, then a problem arises:\n\n\nI have many demonstrations to confute the fancy of those who take\nspace to be a substance or at least an absolute being. But I shall\nonly use, at present, one demonstration, which the author here gives\nme occasion to insist upon. I say, then, that if space were an\nabsolute being, something would happen for which it would be\nimpossible that there should be a sufficient reason\u2014which is\nagainst my axiom. And I prove it thus: space is something absolutely\nuniform, and without the things placed in it, one point of space\nabsolutely does not differ in any respect whatsoever from another\npoint of space. Now from this it follows (supposing space to be\nsomething in itself, besides the order of bodies among themselves)\nthat it is impossible there should be a reason why God, preserving the\nsame situations of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in\nspace after one certain particular manner and not otherwise\u2014why\neverything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by\nchanging east into west. But if space is nothing else but this order\nor relation, and is nothing at all without bodies but the possibility\nof placing them, then those two states, the one such as it is now, the\nother supposed to be the quite contrary way, would not at all differ\nfrom one another. Their difference therefore is only to be found in\nour chimerical supposition of the reality of space. (Clarke and\nLeibniz 1717: L 3: 5)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s argument is clever at the outset: he bypasses the\nthorny problem of determining whether Newton\u2019s idea of absolute\nspace commits him to thinking of space as a substance\u2014a view,\nincidentally, which Newton explicitly considers and rejects in De\nGravitatione (Newton 2004: 21\u20132)\u2014by presupposing only\nthat Newton thinks of space as existing independently of objects and\ntheir relations. If space is indeed independent in this way, then it\nwould seem that God faces a choice: when creating the world, or\nmatter, why place (e.g.) the earth in one particular part of space\nrather than any other? The parts of space, independently of all\nobjects and all relations, obviously do not differ from one another in\nany respect at all, so it would seem that one could not even\ntheoretically devise a reason for placing the earth anywhere in\nparticular, as opposed to anywhere else . (This argument,\nincidentally, does not depend on our having the capacity to refer to\nplaces within empty space.) But since space exists, with all its\nplaces, independently of the earth and everything else, then God must\nindeed have some reason to place the earth in one place rather than\nanother\u2014for Leibniz, even the divine will is inert independent\nof any reason for (as it were) moving in one direction rather than\nanother. Finally, Leibniz argues that he himself avoids this problem\nby asserting that space is nothing above and beyond the objects in the\nworld and all possible relations amongst them (hence he holds a kind\nof modal relationalist view, in more modern terminology). God faces no\nproblematic choice on this view, since space does not exist prior to\nthe creation of the world, or of material objects: to create objects\nwith spatial relations is ipso facto to create space itself,\nfor it is nothing over and above objects and their relations. If you\nlike, space for Leibniz just is a way of conceptually grasping all\nobjects and all possible relations amongst them, all at once. Time,\nsimilarly, is a way of grasping the whole series of events that have\ncharacterized history. Clarke\u2019s reply is somewhat disappointing:\nhe blocks Leibniz\u2019s inference by simply denying that the divine\nwill must have a reason to place (say) the earth in one place rather\nthan another (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 3: 5). The PSR is not\nviolated in this case, according to Clarke\u2019s interpretation of\nit, because it requires only this: if the earth appears in one place\nrather than another, there must be a reason that it appears there, and\nthe reason in this case is simply the divine will; there is no further\nquestion about why the divine being made a particular choice rather\nthan another. In the quotation above, Leibniz speaks of the Newtonians\nas endorsing \u201cthe reality of space\u201d, which Leibniz regards\nas \u201cchimerical\u201d. This remark highlights another important\naspect of Leibniz\u2019s conception of space and time, one that is\noften ignored in contemporary discussions, which tend to emphasize\nLeibnizian \u201crelationalism\u201d in opposition to Newtonian\n\u201cabsolutism\u201d. Leibniz\u2019s view of space and time\nconnects intimately with broader aspects of his metaphysical\npositions: unlike ordinary physical objects, which are constituted by\ntheir parts (they are discrete), and which exhibit features that\ninvolve internal distinctions amongst those parts, he thinks of space\nand time as continuous and homogeneous. Leaving aside the monadology,\nas he does in his correspondence with Clarke, this means that for\nLeibniz, it is physical objects that are real things; space and time\nare merely \u201cideal\u201d or abstract entities whose continuity\nand homogeneity signal this special status. It is not merely that\nspace and time are nothing over and above the events and relations of\nobjects that exist in our world; it is also the case that they are\nideal: they depend in some way on the human mind for their existence.\nOr so Leibniz seems to suggest. This aspect of his view would become\nof central importance to later (e.g. Kant\u2019s) conceptions of the\nLeibniz-Newton debate on the nature of space.\n\nObviously, Leibniz\u2019s arguments against the Newtonians\nhighlighted a fundamental difference between his interpretation of the\nPSR and Clarke\u2019s: where Leibniz held what we might call the\n\u201crationalist\u201d view that all willing, all choice, must\noccur for a reason\u2014a requirement from which even the divine\nbeing is not exempt\u2014Clarke held what we might call the\n\u201cvoluntarist\u201d view that willing, or choice, itself need\nnot occur for any reason, for it is itself a sufficient reason for\nsome states of affairs to obtain or event to occur. From\nLeibniz\u2019s point of view, this renders the will, including the\ndivine will, opaque or unintelligible: if an agent can act or make a\nchoice without having any reason for it, then surely the agent is not\nrational, and if the PSR demands anything of the world, it is that the\nworld be rationally intelligible to us. This requirement must hold of\nagents and their wills as well. But from Clarke\u2019s point of view,\nthis requirement is too stringent, especially in the divine case: if\nwe hold that even God must have a reason for choosing to create one\nstate of affairs rather than another\u2014for choosing, say, to part\nthe Red Sea rather than the Mississippi River\u2014then we are\nipso facto restricting God\u2019s freedom. Surely God has\nthe freedom to choose to do anything at all, or at least, anything\nthat does not contain or instantiate a contradiction, and for his\npart, Leibniz agrees that the principle of contradiction does not\nentail the PSR\u2014the latter is a separate and independent\nprinciple which is necessary for metaphysics and natural philosophy to\nextend beyond mathematics, which requires only the principle of\ncontradiction (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 2: 1). But he thinks that\nClarke\u2019s view leaves us with a God, and indeed with ordinary\nagents, who can act arbitrarily, with no reason at all. That is not\nthe kind of freedom that philosophy seeks; it wishes to see agents as\nengaged in rational action. In their differing interpretations of the\nPSR, and their correspondingly distinct conceptions of freedom and\nreason, the debate between Leibniz and Clarke hits rock bottom.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s criticisms of the Newtonians were not restricted to\nquestions about the nature of space and time; he also revived his old\ncomplaint\u2014one shared by Huygens, as we have seen\nabove\u2014that Newton\u2019s physical theory commits him to the\npossibility, if not to the reality, of action at a distance among the\nplanetary bodies. In one passage in his fourth letter, for instance,\nLeibniz writes (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 4: 45):\n\n\nIt is also a supernatural thing that bodies should attract one another\nat a distance without any intermediate means and that a body should\nmove around without receding in the tangent, though nothing hinders it\nfrom so receding. For these effects cannot be explained by the nature\nof things.\n\n\nAs a defender of the mechanical philosophy, Leibniz insists here, as\nhe had before, that a material body like the Earth would recede along\nthe tangent to its orbit if it were not impacted upon by some physical\nbody or bodies, such as a vortex or another kind of fluid filling the\nsolar system. Clarke\u2019s reply to this charge is especially\nilluminating (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 4: 45):\n\n\nThat one body should attract another without any intermediate means,\nis indeed not a miracle, but a contradiction: for \u2018tis supposing\nsomething to act where it is not. But the means by which two bodies\nattract each other may be invisible and intangible, and of a different\nnature from mechanism, and yet, acting regularly and constantly, may\nwell be called natural, being much less wonderful than animal motion,\nwhich yet is never called a miracle\u2019.\n\n\nThis passage is bound to confuse readers. On the one hand, Clarke is\nclearly arguing that the Newtonians refuse to restrict their\nunderstanding of causal interactions in nature to mechanical cases; on\nthe other, however, he does not accept what many at that time would\nhave regarded as the obvious implication of this denial of mechanism,\nnamely that action at a distance is perfectly possible (a move\nembraced by some later in the eighteenth century, such as Kant).\nInstead, Clarke not only rejects action at a distance, as Newton\npossibly had before him; he contends that it isn\u2019t even\nlogically possible! In his various pronouncements to Bentley and\nothers, Newton never contended that action at a distance was simply a\ncontradiction and therefore impossible, presumably even for the divine\nbeing, who is typically said to be capable of creating any situation\nthat does not instantiate a contradiction (although Descartes\u2019s\nviews on the eternal truths are obviously more complicated).\nClarke\u2019s view raises a serious problem for Newtonians: if action\nat a distance is simply a contradiction, and therefore not a possible\nphysical situation, even with divine intervention, then how should one\ninterpret the theory of universal gravity, which certainly\nappears to indicate that distant action is perfectly\npossible, and perhaps even actual? If we interpret the theory as\npostulating actual distant action, say between the moon and the earth,\nthen it clearly must be mistaken; but even if we interpret it less\nstrongly, as merely postulating that distant action between the moon\nand the earth is possible, that would presumably disqualify the theory\nas well. Perhaps one can save Clarke\u2019s view by contending that\nsince distant action is logically impossible, Newton\u2019s theory\nmust therefore be interpreted as neutral on that issue. This is one\nissue where Clarke\u2019s views may differ substantially from\nNewton\u2019s own. Regardless of whether Clarke represented\nNewton\u2019s own views faithfully, there is no doubt that his\ncorrespondence with Leibniz helped to shape the agenda of philosophy\nin the eighteenth century.\n",
