    "main_text": "Continental philosophy of history || Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history\n2.3 Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history\n\nHegel\u2019s philosophy of history is perhaps the most fully\ndeveloped philosophical theory of history that attempts to discover\nmeaning or direction in history (1824a, 1824b, 1857). Hegel regards\nhistory as an intelligible process moving towards a specific\ncondition\u2014the realization of human freedom. \u201cThe question\nat issue is therefore the ultimate end of mankind, the end which the\nspirit sets itself in the world\u201d (1857: 63). Hegel incorporates\na deeper historicism into his philosophical theories than his\npredecessors or successors. He regards the relationship between\n\u201cobjective\u201d history and the subjective development of the\nindividual consciousness (\u201cspirit\u201d) as an intimate one;\nthis is a central thesis in his Phenomenology of Spirit\n(1807). And he views it to be a central task for philosophy to\ncomprehend its place in the unfolding of history. \u201cHistory is\nthe process whereby the spirit discovers itself and its own\nconcept\u201d (1857: 62). Hegel constructs world history into a\nnarrative of stages of human freedom, from the public freedom of the\npolis and the citizenship of the Roman Republic, to the individual\nfreedom of the Protestant Reformation, to the civic freedom of the\nmodern state. He attempts to incorporate the civilizations of India\nand China into his understanding of world history, though he regards\nthose civilizations as static and therefore pre-historical\n(O\u2019Brien 1975). He constructs specific moments as\n\u201cworld-historical\u201d events that were in the process of\nbringing about the final, full stage of history and human freedom. For\nexample, Napoleon\u2019s conquest of much of Europe is portrayed as a\nworld-historical event doing history\u2019s work by establishing the\nterms of the rational bureaucratic state. Hegel finds reason in\nhistory; but it is a latent reason, and one that can only be\ncomprehended when the fullness of history\u2019s work is finished:\n\u201cWhen philosophy paints its grey on grey, then has a shape of\nlife grown old. \u2026 The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only\nwith the falling of the dusk\u201d ((Hegel 1821: 13). (See\nO\u2019Brien (1975), Taylor (1975), and Koj\u00e8ve (1969) for\ntreatments of Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history.)\n\nIt is worth observing that Hegel\u2019s philosophy of history is not\nthe indefensible exercise of speculative philosophical reasoning that\nanalytic philosophers sometimes paint it. His philosophical approach\nis not based solely on foundational apriori reasoning, and many of his\ninterpretations of concrete historical developments are quite\ninsightful. Instead he proposes an \u201cimmanent\u201d encounter\nbetween philosophical reason and the historical given. Here is how W.\nH. Walsh (1960) describes Hegel\u2019s intellectual project in his\nphilosophy of history:\n\n\nTo accomplish this task the philosopher must take the results of\nempirical history as data, but it will not suffice for him merely to\nreproduce them. He must try to illuminate history by bringing his\nknowledge of the Idea, the formal articulation of reason, to bear upon\nit, striving, in a phrase Hegel uses elsewhere, to elevate empirical\ncontents to the rank of necessary truth. (Walsh 1960: 143)\n\n\nHegel\u2019s prescription is that the philosopher should seek to\ndiscover the rational within the real\u2014not to impose the rational\nupon the real. \u201cTo comprehend what is, this is the task of\nphilosophy, because what is, is reason\u201d (1821: 11). His approach\nis neither purely philosophical nor purely empirical; instead, he\nundertakes to discover within the best historical knowledge of his\ntime, an underlying rational principle that can be philosophically\narticulated (Avineri 1972).\n",
