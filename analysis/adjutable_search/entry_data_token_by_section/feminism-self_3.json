    "main_text": "Reconceptualizations of the Self || The Intersectional and Multiplicitous Self\n3.2 The Intersectional and Multiplicitous Self\n\nOver the past several decades, biosocial, intersectional, and\nphenomenological layers of the relational self have increasingly\ngained prominence. Intersectional theories of selfhood brought forward\nby African American feminists note that stratifications of social\nidentities such as gender, race, and class do not operate in isolation\nfrom one another (Williams 1991; Crenshaw 1993). Rather, these\nidentity modalities interact to produce compound effects. As such, the\nindividual is an intersectional self, or even multiple selves, where\nstructures of subordination but also of agency converge (Moraga and\nAnzald\u00faa 1981; King 1988; Crenshaw 1993). Intersectional theory\naims to capture those aspects of selfhood that are conditioned by\nmembership in subordinated or privileged social groups. Accenting the\nliabilities of belonging to more than one subordinated group,\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw likens the position of such individuals to\nthat of a pedestrian hit by several speeding vehicles simultaneously,\nwhile Mar\u00eda Lugones likens their position to that of a\nborder-dweller who is not at home anywhere (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones\n1992). As a \u201cworld traveler\u201d, Lugones finds herself\nshifting between Latinx and Anglo-American worlds. She offers the\nimage of a \u201ccurdled self\u201d to indicate the heterogeneity of\nselfhood in such conditions (Lugones 1994). For Gloria\nAnzald\u00faa, the mestiza is a central figure for\nunderstanding a new kind of self with an ambiguous, fluid identity:\nthe mestiza experiences a sense of constant in-betweenness\nthat fosters unique modes of meaning-making. As such, intersectional\nborder-dwelling can be a model of positive identity that registers the\nmultiplicitous nature of the self (Anzald\u00faa 1987; Ru\u00edz\n2016; Alarc\u00f3n 1991 and 1996; Barvosa 2008; Ortega\n2016). Border-dwelling selves are frequently ill at ease in the world,\nbut this need not be a disadvantage; rather, it may offer a unique\nlens for interpreting the fractious nature of the self as well as the\npossibilities for resistance to oppressive social norms.\n\nSome feminists are comfortable rejecting the unity of the self\naltogether and suggesting that persons are comprised of what Edwina\nBarvosa calls a \u201cwealth of selves\u201d (Barvosa 2008).\nMar\u00eda Lugones influentially argues that\n\u201cworld-traveling\u201d is a modality of moving between mutually\nexclusive selves that appear within different contexts (Lugones\n2003). Barvosa advocates\nstriving to unify these mutually exclusive selves through a\nself-integrative life project (Barvosa 2008). Mariana Ortega takes\nissue with both of these positions because they advocate an\nontological pluralism: one individual is comprised of multiple selves\n(Ortega 2016). For Ortega, this position is untenable, because it\nfails to account for the fact that a self must have some unique\nidentity. In order to do justice both to the uniqueness of the self\nand to its multiplicity, Ortega argues that selves are ontologically\nsingular but existentially plural. Persons, for her, are characterized\nby a singular multiplicitous self with various facets that are always\nin the process of becoming. Ortega utilizes phenomenology in order to\nargue that the self experiences an existential continuity over time,\neven as its roles and identities may be incommensurate in various\ncontexts.\n\nTheories of the multiplicitous self resonate with Lorde\u2019s\n\u201csister outsider\u201d and Collins\u2019\n\u201coutsider-within\u201d, which, in contrast with W.E.B.\nDuBois\u2019s well-established account of \u201cdouble\nconsciousness\u201d, develop a multitudinous identity in connection\nwith others. This identity is not primarily oriented around the\nblack/white divide prominent in DuBois, nor in modern theories of\nautonomy, but instead around multiple roles and sources of energy,\nkinship, and and community. As we saw above, proponents of the\nintersectional self credit multiply oppressed people with a certain\nepistemic advantage in virtue of their suffering and alienation. Thus,\nblack women are acutely aware of racism within feminism and sexism\nwithin the struggle for racial justice. Their intersectional\npositioned selfhood makes such insight virtually unavoidable.\n\nWhile intersectional theorists bring forward race, class, ability, and\nother socioeconomic markers as central to psychical-historical\nlocations of agency, power, and connectivity, a number of feminists\nare increasingly paying attention to somatic and organic factors in\nselfhood. In addition to the revaluing of embodiment in affect theory\nand new materialisms mentioned above\n (section 2),\n Catherine Malabou points to mental ailments such as Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease to press upon poststructuralist and psychoanalytic theories of\nselfhood (Malabou 2012). Diseases with a physical basis challenge any\nconception of subjectivity located exclusively in the psychic\ncontinuities of conscious and/or unconscious life as posited by\npsychoanalytic theory. Malabou reinterprets Derrida\u2019s\ndeconstructive self as punctured by experiences of alterity through a\nnon-reductive neurobiology of trauma and brain injury. Injured selves\nmay experience radical discontinuities or lose entirely aspects of\ntheir former selves. The resulting picture of the self is a\nmultilayered nexus of relations with psychic-historical and\nsomatic-organic strata. Her work makes clear that feminist\nphilosophies of the self cannot ignore the biological sciences.\n\nWillett combines this turn to biological and psychological studies of\naffect and social emotions with Africana, Latina, and other feminist\ntraditions of the interconnected self. As a social species, the most\nbasic drives and affects of the human self are prosocial, not\nnarcissistic or hedonistic. Maturity does not require abjection,\nrepression, or traumatizing discipline for social cooperation. The\ncapacity for love, friendship, and cooperation with social groups\ncharacterizes humans as a biological species. One consequence of the\nbiosocial drives, as we have seen, is the rejection of the autonomy\nnarrative as the primary or exclusive goal of self-development\n(Willett 1995, 2001). The self matures through enhanced\ncapacities and desires to form social bonds, not severance from a\nsource of dependence (typically portrayed as the mother, the body,\nand/or the animal world).\n\nAnother consequence of this intermingling of the biological with the\nsocial is that intersectionality theory is now extended to include\nmixed-species communities (Haraway 2008; Midgley 1983). This\neco-feminist extension of eros ethics follows from the re-centering of\nethics on affects and eros rather than on the rational capacities that\nmark human superiority and separation from other animal species.\nWillett discerns four strata for envisioning connections across human\nand nonhuman selves, corresponding to modes of social bonds: 1)\nsubjectless sociality, 2) affect attunement, 3) biosocial network as\nlivable place or home, and 4) compassion and the visceral (gut)\nconscience (Willett 2014). These four layers reveal that social\naffects such as laughter or panic transfer from one creature to\nanother, whether from an adult to an infant or within a community of\nbirds, as well as emphasizing that visceral feelings shared among\ncreatures are a key source of moral response. The biosocial layering\nof selfhood reclaims maternal relationality as more than a mechanical\ninstinct for humans and any number of other animal species. The\naffect-laden, relational self cannot transcend through reason its\nsocial embeddedness in a complex politics of in-group/out-group\nmarkers. As we saw above\n (section 2),\n rules appealed to by autonomous selves do not guarantee unbiased\ndecisions. Thanks in large part to feminist critiques of traditional\nmodels of selfhood and ethics, views that emphasize the relational\nnature of the self and its heterogeneous features are moving to the\ncenter of ethics. At the same time, feminists offer a wide range of\nmethodologies and conclusions with respect to this relational self\nthat are sometimes in conflict, reminding us that the work of feminist\nphilosophy is far from finished.\n",
