    "main_text": "The Distinction\n1. The Distinction\n\nTo get clear on the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description, let us briefly examine how its originator,\nBertrand Russell, characterized it (see Russell 1910\u201311 and\n1912: Ch. 5). First, what is meant by \u201cacquaintance\u201d and\n\u201cdescription\u201d? \n\n\nWe shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which\nwe are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of\ninference or any knowledge of truths. (Russell 1912: 78)\n\nI say that I am acquainted with an object when I have a\ndirect cognitive relation to that object, i.e., when I am directly\naware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive relation here,\nI do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes judgment, but the\nsort which constitutes presentation. In fact, I think the relation of\nsubject and object which I call acquaintance is simply the converse of\nthe relation of object and subject which constitutes presentation.\nThat is, to say that S has acquaintance with O is\nessentially the same thing as to say that O is presented to\nS. (Russell 1910/11: 108)\n\n\nRussell thus characterizes acquaintance as a relation of direct\nawareness, a relation in which, as Russell and some others have\nput it, something is \u201cpresented\u201d or simply\n\u201cgiven\u201d to the subject (see e.g., Lewis 1929 and 1946;\nMoser 1989: 80ff.; Fales 1996.) Various positions can accept some sort\nof distinction between direct and indirect \u201cawareness\u201d:\nroughly, an awareness of X is indirect if it depends on\nawareness of something else, and direct otherwise. But this\ncharacterization of the distinction leaves open what counts as direct\nawareness. \n\nWhat distinguishes acquaintance is, minimally, the following two\nclosely related features. First, it is a nonjudgmental and\nnonconceptual form of awareness. Judgments, thoughts and concepts are\nessentially intentional or representational in nature, i.e.,\nthey are about or represent other things.\nAcquaintance with something does not consist in forming any judgment\nor thought about it, or in having any concept or representation of it.\n(In the second passage above Russell does characterize it as a special\n\u201ccognitive\u201d relation, but one must immediately wonder what\nthis means given that he explicitly denies that it is judgmental in\nnature.) Second, it is a form of awareness constituting a real,\ngenuine relation, a relation that cannot obtain without its\nrelata (the things or items related). One cannot be\nacquainted with something that does not exist. Acquaintance is thus\nlike the relation of kicking or throwing, for one cannot kick or throw\nwithout there being something that is kicked or thrown\u2014something\nthat is the object of the kicking or throwing. (Of course, these are\nnot forms of awareness!) In contrast, judgments and concepts\nmay represent or be about things that don\u2019t exist. Philosophers\nsometimes refer to this second feature by saying that acquaintance is\n\u201cinfallible\u201d. However, this term is most often used to\nrefer to a property of beliefs: roughly, a belief is\ninfallible if it is immune to error or is guaranteed to be true. Given\nthe first feature above, being acquainted with something is not to be\nunderstood in terms of having a belief or judgment about it, not even\nan infallible one.\n\nBy a \u201cdescription\u201d Russell means any phrase of the form\n\u201ca so-and-so\u201d (an \u201cambiguous\u201d or\n\u201cindefinite\u201d description) or \u201cthe so-and-so\u201d\n(a \u201cdefinite\u201d description), though he focuses on the\nlatter in his discussion of knowledge by description. Russell\u2019s\ndefinition of knowledge by description builds naturally on this: To\nknow some thing or object by a definite description is to know that it\nis the so-and-so or that the so-and-so exists, i.e., that there is\nexactly one object that is so-and-so (Russell 1912: 82\u20133). On\nRussell\u2019s view, proper nouns, and most common words, are really\ndisguised descriptions (1912: 84\u20135). We might claim to know who\nJack the Ripper was, that he was a vicious human being, and so on, but\nwe can only think of and know the individual about whom the claim is\nmade through a description of that individual\u2014Jack the Ripper is\nthat person (whoever he was) who committed certain atrocities in\nLondon in 1888. We have no \u201cfirst hand\u201d knowledge of the\nperson about whom our judgment is made\u2014we don\u2019t even have\n\u201cfirst hand\u201d knowledge that only one individual committed\nthe murders or, for that matter, that the murders took place. Put\nanother way, we are not directly acquainted with either the crimes or\nthe perpetrator of those crimes since he is long dead and we have\nsurely never met him.\n\nTalk of descriptions naturally suggests the use of language,\nand as we have just seen, Russell himself often characterizes\ndescriptions in linguistic terms, e.g., as phrases having\nsuch-and-such a form. However, for Russell, description does not\nessentially involve the use of words or phrases of a language; it\ninvolves the use or application of concepts. To know\nsomething \u201cby description\u201d does not require the use of\nlanguage or linguistic terms, but it does require the use or\napplication of concepts.\n\nThe example of Jack the Ripper just given, and many of Russell\u2019s\nexamples, are at best misleading. They trade on that commonplace\ndistinction between things we know \u201cfirst hand\u201d and things\nwe have only heard about or read about\u2014the things that have been\ndescribed to us.\n\nBut our commonsense way of making the distinction soon goes by the\nwayside. Most philosophers wedded to some notion of acquaintance end\nup rejecting the idea that we have acquaintance even with bread-box\nsized objects, immediately before us, under ideal conditions of\nperception. The test to determine with what we are acquainted is often\nreminiscent of the method Descartes recommended for finding secure\nfoundations of knowledge\u2014the method of doubt (see Russell 1912:\n74; Price 1932: 3). If you are considering whether you are acquainted\nwith something, ask yourself whether you can conceive of being in this\nvery state when the putative object does not exist. If you can, you\nshould reject the suggestion that you are directly acquainted with the\nitem in question. Based on possibilities of error about physical\nobjects from illusion, hallucination and dreams, it seemed to most\nthat we could rule out acquaintance with physical objects, future\nevents, other minds, and facts that involve any of these as\nconstituents. Consider, for example, physical objects. It seems that\nthe evidence that my experiences give me right now for supposing that\nthere is a computer before me is perfectly consistent with the\nhypothesis that I am now having a vivid dream or a vivid\nhallucination. If this is right, then the experiential evidence I\npossess cannot be the computer or any of its constituents. Neither the\ncomputer, nor any of its constituents, need be present in that vivid\ndream or hallucination. Even when our evidence for the presence of\nphysical objects seems as good as we can get, then, we are not\nacquainted with physical objects or their constituents. (However, some\nhave recently defended the view that we can be acquainted with\nphysical objects in perception. See, for example, Johnston 2004.)\nTraditionally, acquaintance theorists have taken the most promising\ncandidates for entities with which we can be acquainted to be\nconscious states of mind (e.g., an experience of pain, a sensation of\nred) and their properties (e.g., painfulness, redness). Russell and\nmany other acquaintance theorists also take themselves to be\nacquainted with facts, i.e., with something\u2019s having\nsome property\u2014at least mental facts (e.g., my being in pain, my\ndesiring food, my experiencing red). \n\nWhat about the possibility of acquaintance with ourselves? Can an\nindividual be directly acquainted with him or herself? Russell takes\nthe question of whether we are ever acquainted with the self to be a\ndifficult one. He says that acquaintance with the self is \u201chard\nto disentangle from other things,\u201d but tentatively concludes\nthat \u201cit is probable, though not certain, that we have\nacquaintance with Self\u201d (1912: 78\u201381.) However, he later\ndenies that we have acquaintance with the self (see Russell 1914: part\nIII). In a recent paper, Duncan (2015) uses the method of doubt, or\nsomething very much like it, to argue that we are acquainted with\nourselves.\n\nLet us now return to the primary question of this section: how should\nwe understand the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description? When philosophers speak of\nknowledge they typically mean to be discussing knowledge of\ntruths or propositional knowledge, knowledge that involves a belief or\njudgment in some true claim or proposition. As introduced by Russell,\nthe distinction sometimes seems to be that between noninferential or\nfoundational knowledge on the one hand, and inferential or\nnonfoundational knowledge on the other. Roughly, one has\nnonfoundational or inferential knowledge that p when\none\u2019s knowledge that p depends on one\u2019s knowledge\nof some other proposition(s) from which one can legitimately infer\np; and one has foundational or noninfrential knowledge that\np when one\u2019s knowledge that p does not depend\non any other knowledge one has. Knowledge by acquaintance is\nfoundational knowledge because it depends on one\u2019s acquaintance\nwith the object itself, or with properties of or facts about the\nobject, and not on any further knowledge of truths. Knowledge by\ndescription, in contrast, always depends on some further knowledge of\ntruths for support; as Russell puts it, knowledge by description\n\u201calways involves\u2026some knowledge of truths as its\nsource and ground\u201d (1912: 72\u20133, emphasis added).\n\nThis seems to be a natural and relatively straightforward way of\ndrawing the distinction. However, there may seem to be a problem with\nthis way of drawing the distinction, at least as an interpretation of\nRussell, for he denies that knowledge by acquaintance is knowledge of\ntruths:\n\n\nKnowledge of things, when it is of the kind we call knowledge by\nacquaintance, is essentially simpler than any knowledge of\ntruths, and logically independent of knowledge of truths, though it\nwould be rash to assume that human beings ever, in fact, have\nacquaintance with things without at the same time knowing some truth\nabout them. (Russell 1912: 72)\n\n\nWe have already seen that for Russell acquaintance is nonjudgmental or\nnonpropositional; to be acquainted with something is to be aware\nof it in a way that does not essentially involve being aware\nthat it is so-and-so. Russell seems to be extending this to\nknowledge by acquaintance: it is knowledge of something, and\nlogically independent of knowledge that something is\nso-and-so. Nor is this usage of the term \u2018knowledge\u2019 and\nits cognates strange: we do indeed talk about knowing people and\ncities. This might suggest that we should draw the distinction between\nknowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description not as one\nbetween foundational and nonfoundational knowledge of truths, but as\none between knowledge of truths and knowledge of something other than\ntruths. Indeed, as we have seen, Russell at one point defines\nknowledge of something by description simply as knowledge that it is\nso-and-so, not foundational knowledge that it is so-and-so\n(1912: 84\u20135). But then, what more than acquaintance is\ninvolved in knowledge by acquaintance? It is difficult to\nfind an answer from Russell.\n\nIt is tempting to suppose that Russell equivocates between the\nrelation of acquaintance and the special kind of knowledge of truth\n(foundational knowledge) whose sole source is acquaintance. That we\nordinarily talk about knowing things and people might encourage this\nequivocation. Moreover, perhaps the fact that acquaintance is a form\nof awareness of the most direct, most secure kind, and is fundamental\nto all knowledge of truths, led Russell to think it deserves to be\ncalled \u201cknowledge\u201d of the thing in question. The issue\nhere is largely terminological. In order to guard against confusing\nacquaintance on the one hand with foundational knowledge\nof truths acquired by acquaintance on the other, and facilitate\nan examination of the relation between them, we should be more careful\nthan Russell and restrict knowledge by acquaintance\nto foundational knowledge of truths. By contrast, one can\nhave acquaintance with items that are not truths, items that\ncannot be said to be true or false. Knowledge by description, on the\nother hand, is nonfoundational knowledge of truths; it \u201calways\ninvolves\u2026some knowledge of truths as its source and\nground\u201d (Russell 1912: 72\u20133). We adopt this usage in what\nfollows. \n\nFor classical foundationalists like Russell, all knowledge of truths\nultimately depends on foundational knowledge of truths acquired by\nacquaintance. But how exactly does acquaintance contribute to this\nknowledge of truths? If acquaintance is nothing like a judgment or\nbelief, and if the items with which we are acquainted are themselves\nneither true nor false, how do we get any knowledge of truths\nout of acquaintance? We turn to this question in\n section 3.\n\nFirst, however, let us briefly discuss contemporary views regarding\nthe nature and objects of acquaintance.\n",
