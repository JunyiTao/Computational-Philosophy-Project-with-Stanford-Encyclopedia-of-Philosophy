    "main_text": "Distillation\n10. Distillation\n\nDistillation was a key artisanal model for Porta, because he\nmaintained that by means of this technology, one could extract the\nessences, that is the \u2018spirits\u2019 or souls of all things. Porta was here\nfollowing a tradition in alchemy that in his day was associated with\nArnaldo da Villanova and Ramon Llull. In accordance with this\ntradition, Porta applied the conceptual model of distillation to many\ndifferent arts: to describe techonologies for the purification of\nmetals, to meteorological phenomena, such as rain or clouds and even\nas a design for processes of social reform (conceived of as a\npurification of society). In this last sense Porta\u2019s art of\ndistillation resonates with his claims about policing society made in\nhis physiognomics. This art spilled over into Porta\u2019s ideas\nabout the refinement of substances: for the De distillationibus also\ndescribes the use of different animal shapes of alembics for the\ndistillation of different substances. Thus for instance Porta\nmaintains that a bear-shaped alembic is ideal for the refinement of\ncoarse substances (Kahn & Perifano 2018, Perfetti 2001, Eamon\n2017, Borrelli 2019).\n",
