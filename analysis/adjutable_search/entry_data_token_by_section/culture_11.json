Of course, cultural\nchange\u00a0is inevitable in some form, as highlighted above,\nand especially if one\u00a0holds a culture-as-dialogue view, cultures\nare in fact never static.\u00a0Rather, practices,\u00a0norms, and\nvalues that are defining of a culture at one time may cease to be\ncentrally defining of that culture, for a whole range of reasons\nincluding economic, environmental, and political. So, in fact, some\namount of\u00a0cultural loss is inevitable, and moreover, it is not\nalways to be regretted. Sometimes, it is a normal response to external\nfactors that are beyond a culture\u2019s control, and sometimes it is\nwelcome because the changes result in the better protection of human\nrights or more inclusive cultural traditions and practices.\u00a0A\ncultural group may choose to shift their central modes of production\nin response to changing environmental factors, for example. So, as\nSamuel Scheffler has argued, the strong preservationist view of\nculture\u2014that cultures should be insulated from all forms of\nchange\u2014must be rejected (Scheffler 2007).\n\nYet, especially minority cultures may sometimes\u00a0have a reasonable\nclaim that they are not able to protect themselves against unwanted\ncultural change, or that they are not able to control the pace of\nchange. They may thereby be entitled to forms of state support, to\nhelp them create the conditions under which they can resist unwanted\ncultural change.\u00a0 When linguistic minorities request state\nsupport to persist in educating children in a minority language, for\nexample, sometimes the justification is in the name of protecting\nagainst the erosion of the language in the face of pressure to adopt\nor become fluent in the majority language.\n\nIn other cases, majorities are actively focused on undermining\nminority cultures, often over years and even decades. Colonial states\nhave pursued genocidal policies against Indigenous communities for\nexample, with the expressed purpose of undermining their capacity to\nsurvive as distinct peoples. In assessing cases of cultural loss,\nthen, a key factor\u00a0is whether the shift is forced upon\nminority groups, not necessarily by changing environmental or economic\nconditions, but by agents who intend to undermine the culture,\nby\u00a0actively disvaluing\u00a0it and thereby acting so as to\nundermine the conditions for its robust continuity. External,\nmalicious, factors that engender cultural change that would not\notherwise be expected,\u00a0make the change not only regrettable, but\ngenerate a case for reparations, for example with respect to\nIndigenous communities,\u00a0where there is \u201cevidence of a\nhistory of dispossession, discrimination, or subordination\u201d\n(Phillips 2018: 97).\n",
