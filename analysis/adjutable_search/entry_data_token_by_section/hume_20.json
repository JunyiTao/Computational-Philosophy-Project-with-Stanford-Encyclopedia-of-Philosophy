    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || The Characters\n8.1 The Characters\n\nThe Dialogues record a conversation between three characters.\nCleanthes, a self\u2013\u00adproclaimed \u201cexperimental\ntheist\u201d, offers the argument from design as an empirical proof\nof God\u2019s existence and nature (DCNR 5.2/41). Demea\nopposes him, maintaining that the argument\u2019s merely probable\nconclusion demeans God\u2019s mystery and majesty. He believes that\nGod\u2019s nature is completely inscrutable. Cleanthes dubs Demea a\nmystic, while Demea derides Cleanthes\u2019\nanthromorphism\u2014his human\u2013centered bias in\ncomparing the creator of the universe to a human mind.\n\nCleanthes and Demea represent the central positions in the\neighteenth\u2013century natural religion debate. Cleanthes embodies\nits dominant, progressive strain, consisting primarily of theologians\nin the British Royal Society, who were fascinated by probability and\nthe previous century\u2019s impressive successes in experimental\nnatural philosophy. Convinced that the new science gave witness to\nGod\u2019s providence, they rejected traditional a priori\nproofs, which purported to demonstrate God\u2019s existence with\nmathematical certainty and without appeal to experience. Instead, they\nused the order and regularity they found in the universe to construct\na probabilistic argument for a divine designer.\n\nHoldouts clung to demonstrative proof in science and theology against\nthe rising tide of probability. Demea is the champion of these\nconservative traditionalists. Since he trots out a lame version of\nSamuel Clarke\u2019s cosmological argument in Part 9, some have\nthought that Hume models Demea on him. But Demea lacks Clarke\u2019s\nrigid rationalism. It is more likely that he epitomizes a group of\nminor theologians such as William King, who stressed God\u2019s\nincomprehensibility and resorted to a priori arguments only\nwhen they absolutely needed them.\n\nThere was no genuinely sceptical presence in the\neighteenth\u2013century natural religion debate. This makes\nPhilo, who both Cleanthes and Demea characterize as a\nsceptic, the ringer in the conversation. Although all three\ncharacters say very Humean things at one time or another,\nPhilo\u2019s views are consistently the closest to Hume\u2019s.\nPhilo\u2019s form of scepticism is the mitigated scepticism\nof the first Enquiry, which makes him the most likely\ncandidate for Hume\u2019s spokesman.\n\nAs the Dialogues begin, all three characters agree that their\nsubject is God\u2019s nature, since everyone agrees that he\nexists. Parts 1\u20138 concern God\u2019s natural\nattributes, his omnipotence, omniscience, and providence, while\nParts 10 and 11 consider his moral attributes, his\nbenevolence and righteousness.\n",
