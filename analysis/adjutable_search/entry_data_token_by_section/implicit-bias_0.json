While\ncontrolled processing was thought to be voluntary, attention-demanding,\nand of limited capacity, automatic processing was thought to unfold\nwithout attention, to have nearly unlimited capacity, and to be hard to\nsuppress voluntarily (Payne & Gawronski 2010; see also Bargh 1994).\nIn important early work on implicit cognition, Fazio and colleagues\nshowed that attitudes can be understood as activated by either\ncontrolled or automatic processes. In Fazio\u2019s (1995)\n\u201csequential priming\u201d task, for example, following exposure\nto social group labels (e.g., \u201cblack\u201d, \u201cwomen\u201d,\netc.), subjects\u2019 reaction times (or \u201cresponse\nlatencies\u201d) to stereotypic words (e.g., \u201clazy\u201d or\n\u201cnurturing\u201d) are measured. People respond more quickly to\nconcepts closely linked together in memory, and most subjects in the\nsequential priming task are quicker to respond to words like\n\u201clazy\u201d following exposure to \u201cblack\u201d than\n\u201cwhite\u201d. Researchers standardly take this pattern to\nindicate a prejudiced automatic association between semantic concepts.\nThe broader notion embedded in this research was that subjects\u2019\nautomatic responses were thought to be \u201cuncontaminated\u201d by\ncontrolled or strategic responses (Amodio & Devine 2009).\n\n\nWhile this first stream of research focused on automaticity, a\nsecond stream focused on (un)consciousness. Many studies demonstrated\nthat awareness of stereotypes can affect social judgment and behavior\nin relative independence from subjects\u2019 reported attitudes\n(Devine 1989; Devine & Monteith 1999; Dovidio & Gaertner 2004;\nGreenwald & Banaji 1995; Banaji et al. 1993). These studies were\ninfluenced by theories of implicit memory (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas\n1981; Schacter 1987), leading to Greenwald & Banaji\u2019s\noriginal definition of \u201cimplicit attitudes\u201d as\n\n\n\nintrospectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of\npast experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought,\nor action toward social objects. (1995: 8)\n\n\n\nThe guiding idea here, as Dovidio and Gaertner (1986) put it, is\nthat in the modern world prejudice has been \u201cdriven\nunderground,\u201d that is, out of conscious awareness. This idea has\nled to the common view that what makes a bias implicit is that a person\nis unwilling or unable to report it. Recent findings have challenged\nthis view, however (\u00a73.1)\n",
