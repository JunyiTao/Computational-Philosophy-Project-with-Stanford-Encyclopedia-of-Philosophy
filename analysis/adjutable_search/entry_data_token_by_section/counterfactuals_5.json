    "main_text": "The Logic of Counterfactuals\n2. The Logic of Counterfactuals\n\nThis section will survey two semantic analyses of counterfactuals: the\nstrict conditional analysis and the\nsimilarity analysis. These conceptually related\nanalyses also have a shared explanatory goal: to capture logically\nvalid inferences involving counterfactuals, while treating them\nnon-truth-functionally, leaving room for their context dependence, and\naddressing the non-monotonic interpretation of counterfactual\nantecedents. Crucially, these analyses abstract away Goodman\u2019s\nProblem because they are not primarily concerned with the\ntruth-conditions of particular counterfactuals\u2014just as classical\nlogic does not take a stand on which atomic sentences are actually\ntrue. Instead, they say only enough about truth-conditions to settle\nmatters of logic, e.g., if \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\phi>\\psi\\) are true,\nthen \\(\\psi\\) is true. Sections\n 2.5\n and\n 2.6\n will revisit questions about the truth-conditions of particular\ncounterfactuals, Goodman\u2019s Problem and the philosophical\nprojects surveyed in\n \u00a71.\n\nThe following subsections will detail strict conditional and\nsimilarity analyses. But it is useful at the outset to consider\nsimplified versions of these two analyses alongside each other. This\nwill clarify their key differences and similarities. Both analyses are\nalso stated in the framework of possible world semantics developed in\nKripke (1963) for modal logics. The\nfollowing subsection provides this background and an overview of the\ntwo analyses.\n",
