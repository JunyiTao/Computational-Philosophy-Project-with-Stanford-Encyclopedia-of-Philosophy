The reference or extension of a term is\nthe set of objects to which it reference. Weber adopts a mixed theory\nof refence. According to mixed theories, the reference of a term is\ndetermined how the relevant linguistic community causally interacts\nwith potential referents as well as how they describe potential\nreferents. This theory leads Weber to pay close attention, not just to\nhow geneticists theorized about genes or used the concept to explain\nphenomena, but also how they conducted their laboratory\ninvestigations. Following Kitcher (1978, 1982), he examines ways in\nwhich modes of reference changed over time.\n\n\nWeber identifies six different gene concepts, beginning with Darwin's\npangene concept (1868) and ending with the contemporary concept of\nmolecular genetics. He distinguishes the contemporary molecular\nconcept from the classical (or \u2018neoclassical\u2019) one on the\nbasis of how geneticists described their functional role (RNA/protein\ncoding versus general function unit), their material basis (RNA/DNA\nversus chromosome), and their structure (discontinuous linear -- with\nintrons and exons versus continuous linear) as well as on the basis of\nthe criteria experimentalists used to identify genes (by gene product\nversus complementation test). \n\n\nWeber examines how the investigation of several particular\nDrosophila genes changed as the science of genetics\ndeveloped. His study shows that the methods of molecular genetics\nprovided new ways to identify genes that were first identified by\nclassical techniques. The reference of the term changed, not simply as\na result of theoretical developments, but also as a result of the\nimplementation of new methods to identify genes. He concludes that\nunlike concepts of physical science that have been analyzed by\nphilosophers, the gene concept has a \u201cnonessentialistic character that\nallows biologists to lay down different natural classifications,\ndepending on the investigative methods available as well as on\ntheoretical interests\u201d (Weber 2005, p. 228). Weber calls this feature\n\u201cfloating references\u201d.\n",
