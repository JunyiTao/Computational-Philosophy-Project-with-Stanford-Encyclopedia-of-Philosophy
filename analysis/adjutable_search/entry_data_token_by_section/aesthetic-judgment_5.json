    "main_text": "The Judgment of Taste || Judgments of Taste and the Big Question\n1.5 Judgments of Taste and the Big Question\n\nWe can sum things up like this: judgments of taste occupy a mid-point\nbetween judgments of niceness and nastiness, and empirical judgments\nabout the external world. Judgments of taste are like empirical\njudgments in that they have universal validity, but they are unlike\nempirical judgment in that they are made on the basis of an inner\nsubjective response. Conversely, judgments of taste are like judgments\nof niceness or nastiness in that they are made on the basis of an\ninner subjective response, but they are unlike judgments of niceness\nand nastiness, which make no claim to universal validity. To cut the\ndistinctions the other way: in respect of normativity, judgments of\ntaste are like empirical judgments and unlike judgments of niceness or\nnastiness, but in respect of subjectivity, judgments of taste are\nunlike empirical judgments and like judgments of niceness or\nnastiness. So, we have a three-fold division: empirical judgments,\njudgments of taste, and judgments of niceness or nastiness. And\njudgments of taste have the two points of similarity and dissimilarity\non each side just noted.\n\nAs Kant recognized (more or less following Hume), all this is a point\nfrom which to theorize. The hard question is\nwhether, and if so how, such a subjectively\nuniversal judgment is possible. On the face of it, the two\ncharacteristics are in tension with each other. Our puzzle is this:\nwhat must be the nature of pleasure in beauty if the judgments we base\non it can make claim to correctness? This is the Big Question in\naesthetics. Kant\u2019s problem was the right one, even if his\nsolution was not.\n\nHowever, our hope thus far has been to get clearer about what it is\nthat is under scrutiny in this debate. Once we are armed with a modest\naccount of what a judgment of taste is, we can then proceed to more\nambitious questions about whether or not judgments of taste represent\nreal properties of beauty and ugliness, and if not, how else the\nnormativity of aesthetic judgment is to be explained. We can even\nconsider whether or not our whole practice of making judgments of\ntaste is defective and should be jettisoned. But first things\nfirst.\n",
