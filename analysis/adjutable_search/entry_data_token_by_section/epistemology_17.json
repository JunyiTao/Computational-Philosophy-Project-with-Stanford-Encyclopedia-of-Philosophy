    "main_text": "The Structure of Knowledge and Justification || Why Foundationalism?\n4.3 Why Foundationalism?\n\nThe main argument for foundationalism is called the regress\nargument. It\u2019s an argument from elimination. With regard to\nevery justified belief, B1, the question arises of where\nB1\u2019s justification comes from. If B1 is\nnot basic, it would have to come from another belief, B2.\nBut B2 can justify B1 only if B2 is\njustified itself. If B2 is basic, the justificatory chain\nwould end with B2. But if B2 is not basic, we\nneed a further belief, B3. If B3 is not basic,\nwe need a fourth belief, and so forth. Unless the ensuing regress\nterminates in a basic belief, we get two possibilities: the regress\nwill either loop back to B1 or continue ad\ninfinitum. According to the regress argument, both of these\npossibilities are unacceptable. Therefore, if there are justified\nbeliefs, there must be basic\n beliefs.[49]\n\nThis argument suffers from various weaknesses. First, we may wonder\nwhether the alternatives to foundationalism are really unacceptable.\nIn the recent literature on this subject, we actually find an\nelaborate defense of the position that infinitism is the correct\nsolution to the regress\n problem.[50]\n Nor should circularity be dismissed too quickly. The issue is not\nwhether a simple argument of the form p therefore p can\njustify the belief that p. Of course it cannot. Rather, the\nissue is ultimately whether, in the attempt to show that trust in our\nfaculties is reasonable, we may make use of the input our faculties\ndeliver. Whether such circularity is as unacceptable as a\np-therefore-p inference is an open question. Moreover, the\navoidance of circularity does not come cheap. Experiential\nfoundationalists claim that perception is a source of justification.\nHence they need to answer the J-question: Why is perception a\nsource of justification? As we saw above, if we wish to answer this\nquestion without committing ourselves to the kind of circularity\ndependence coherentism involves, we must choose between externalism\nand an appeal to brute necessity.\n\nThe second weakness of the regress argument is that its conclusion\nmerely says this: If there are justified beliefs, there must be\njustified beliefs that do not receive their justification from other\nbeliefs. Its conclusion does not say that, if there are justified\nbeliefs, there must be beliefs whose justification is independent of\nany justification for further beliefs. So the regress argument, if it\nwere sound, would merely show that there must be doxastic\nbasicality. Dependence coherentism, however, allows for doxastic\nbasicality. So the regress argument merely defends experiential\nfoundationalism against doxastic coherentism. It does not tell us why\nwe should prefer experiential foundationalism to dependence\ncoherentism.\n\nExperiential foundationalism can be supported by citing cases like the\nblue hat example. Such examples make it plausible to assume that\nperceptual experiences are a source of justification. But they do not\narbitrate between dependence coherentism and experiential\nfoundationalism, since both of those views appeal to perceptual\nexperiences to explain why perceptual beliefs are justified.\n\nFinally, foundationalism can be supported by advancing objections to\ncoherentism. One prominent objection is that coherentism somehow fails\nto ensure that a justified belief system is in contact with reality.\nThis objection derives its force from the fact that fiction can be\nperfectly coherent. Why think, therefore, that a belief system\u2019s\ncoherence is a reason for thinking that the beliefs in that system\ntend to be true? Coherentists could respond to this objection by\nsaying that, if a belief system contains beliefs such as \u201cMany\nof my beliefs have their origin in perceptual experiences\u201d and\n\u201cMy perceptual experiences are reliable\u201d, it is reasonable\nfor the subject to think that her belief system brings her into\ncontact with external reality. This looks like an effective response\nto the no-contact-with-reality objection. Moreover, it is not easy to\nsee why foundationalism itself should be better positioned than\ncoherentism when contact with reality is the issue. What is meant by\n\u201censuring\u201d contact with reality? If foundationalists\nexpect a logical guarantee of such contact, basic beliefs\nmust be infallible. That would make contact with reality a rather\nexpensive commodity. Given its price, foundationalists might want to\nlower their expectations. According to an alternative construal, we\nexpect merely the likelihood of contact with reality. But if\ncoherentists account for the epistemic value of perception in any way,\nthen they can meet that expectation as well as foundationalists\ncan.\n\nSince coherentism can be construed in different ways, it is unlikely\nthat there is one single objection that succeeds in refuting all\npossible versions of coherentism. Doxastic coherentism, however, seems\nparticularly vulnerable to criticism coming from the foundationalist\ncamp. One of these we considered already: It would seem that doxastic\ncoherentism makes excessive intellectual demands on believers. When\ndealing with the mundane tasks of everyday life, we don\u2019t\nnormally bother to form beliefs about the explanatory coherence of our\nbeliefs or the reliability of our belief sources. According to a\nsecond objection, doxastic coherentism fails by being insensitive to\nthe epistemic relevance of perceptual experiences. Foundationalists\ncould argue as follows. Suppose Kim is observing a chameleon that\nrapidly changes its colors. A moment ago it was blue, now it\u2019s\npurple. Kim still believes it\u2019s blue. Her belief is now\nunjustified because she believes the chameleon is blue even though it\nlooks purple to her. Then the chameleon changes its color\nback to blue. Now Kim\u2019s belief that the chameleon is blue is\njustified again because the chameleon once again looks blue\nto her. The point would be that what\u2019s responsible for the\nchanging justificatory status of Kim\u2019s belief is solely the way\nthe chameleon looks to her. Since doxastic coherentism does not\nattribute epistemic relevance to perceptual experiences by themselves,\nit cannot explain why Kim\u2019s belief is first justified, then\nunjustified, and eventually justified\n again.[51]\n",
