    "main_text": "Logically and Philosophically Motivated Variations\n8. Logically and Philosophically Motivated Variations\n\nIn the preceding set theories, the properties of the usual objects of\nmathematics accord closely with their properties as\n\u201cintuitively\u201d understood by most mathematicians (or lay\npeople). (Strictly speaking, this is not quite true in NFU +\nInfinity without the additional assumption of Rosser\u2019s Axiom of\nCounting, but the latter axiom (\u201c\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is strongly\ncantorian\u201d) is almost always assumed in practice).\n\nIn the first two classes of system discussed in this section, logical\nconsiderations lead to the construction of theories in which\n\u201cfamiliar\u201d parts of the world look quite different.\nConstructive mathematicians do not see the same continuum that we do,\nand if they are willing to venture into the higher reaches of set\ntheory, they find a different world there, too. The proponents of\nnonstandard analysis also find it useful to look at a different\ncontinuum (and even different natural numbers) though they do see the\nusual continuum and natural numbers embedded therein.\n\nIt is not entirely clear that the final item discussed in this\nsection, the multiverse view of set theory proposed by Joel Hamkins,\nshould be described as a view of the world of set theory at all: it\nproposes that we should consider that there are multiple different\nconcepts of set each of which describes its own universe (and loosely\nwe might speak of the complex of universes as a\n\u201cmultiverse\u201d), but at bottom it is being questioned\nwhether there is properly a single world of set theory at all. But the\ntentative list of proposed axioms he gives for relationships between\nuniverses have some of the flavor of an alternative set theory.\n",
