    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || Reasons and Desires\n3.4 Reasons and Desires\n\n\nTurning to meta-ethics, a vibrant debate exists over the relation of\ndesires to reasons to act. According to one tradition, typically called\n\u2018Humean\u2019 or \u2018Neo-Humean\u2019, the existence of\nreasons to act depends on the existence of desires possessed by the\nagent who would act. Thus, my reason to drink hot chocolate depends on\nmy desires, and likewise my reason to help a stranger depends on my\ndesires, according to the Humean.\n\n\nSome have taken Humeanism to claim that reasons are identical to the\nhaving of desires (so that my reason to drink hot chocolate is the fact\nthat I desire to drink hot chocolate) while others have taken Humeanism\nto claim that reasons are (typically) non-desire states of affairs that\nare reasons in virtue of their relations to desires (so that my reason\nto drink hot chocolate is that it tastes a certain way, but that it\ntastes a certain way is only a reason to drink hot chocolate because I\ndesire to experience such tastes). Though related, these two positions\nhave substantially different implications, as Mark Schroeder has argued\n(Schroeder 2007).\n\n\nHumeans have defended their position in several ways, but\ncontemporary debate has focused in large part on an argument developed\nby Bernard Williams. Williams argues that only Humeanism can explain\nthe relation between reasons and motivation: if one has a reason to\nact, then one can act for that reason, Williams holds. But this is only\nguaranteed if having a reason to act involves having a desire. Hence\nreasons to act depend on the existence of desires (Williams 1981).\nTaking a somewhat different approach, Mark Schroeder argues that, when\nproperly formulated, Humeanism simply fits best with our range of\nintuitions about what reasons there are to act and the ways in which\nthese reasons are or are not contingent on facts about our psychologies\n(Schroeder 2007).\n\n\nAttacks on the Humean position have often been motivated by moral\nconsiderations: one does not need to have any desires whatsoever (not\ndesires properly so-called, at any rate) in order to have a reason to\ndo what is moral, according to some anti-Humeans, and so this\nparticular reason to act, at least, is not in any way dependent upon\ndesires (e.g., Schueler 1995). A more fundamental attack has been\nlaunched by Christine Korsgaard, who argues that, if it is true that\nthere is a reason to act on one's desires, then this is a\nfundamental evaluative fact\u2014and so there is no reason to be\nskeptical about parallel fundamental evaluative facts that entail there\nare reasons independent of one's desires (Korsgaard 1997).\n",
