    "main_text": "Problem II: Anomalous Monism || Lawful Sufficiency\n5.4 Lawful Sufficiency\n\nFodor (1989) apparently agrees that counterfactuals capture a kind of\ncausal relevance, but he argues that LePore and Loewer have settled\nfor too little. On Fodor\u2019s view, mental properties can be\nrelevant to behavior in a stronger sense in which they are\nsufficient for their effects and in this way \u201cmake a\ndifference\u201d. Fodor spells out sufficiency in terms of laws: a\nproperty makes a difference if \u201cit\u2019s a property in virtue\nof the instantiation of which the occurrence of one event is\nnomologically sufficient for the occurrence of another\u201d (Fodor\n1989, p. 65, note omitted).\n\nMight such an account save anomalous monism from the charge of\nepiphenomenalism? On the face of it, it cannot, for as we\u2019ve\nnoted, mental properties on Davidson\u2019s view appear only in\nhedged laws, laws that include an implicit ceteris paribus\nrider. Consider a candidate psychological law:\n\n(L)  If an agent,\na, wants x, believes x is obtainable by\ndoing y, and judges y best, all things considered,\nthen a forms the intention to y and subsequently\ny\u2019s on the basis of this intention, ceteris\nparibus. \n\n\nThe ceteris paribus clause here would seem to block the\nmental properties in question from being causally sufficient for the\nbehavioral effect. But perhaps not: according to (L), the mental\nproperties are sufficient for the behavioral effect when the\nceteris paribus conditions are satisfied. And this sort of\ncausal sufficiency, Fodor argues, is all anyone could reasonably want\nfor mental properties.\n\nBut can Davidson help himself to such an account? Davidson appears to\nthink so (1993, p. 10), as does McLaughlin (1989), who also appeals to\nhedged laws. Fodor, however, doubts his account is compatible with\nanomalous monism; such doubts are developed by Antony (1991) and Kim\n(1993b). The question turns largely on Davidson\u2019s reasons for\nthinking the mental is anomalous, and on whether these reasons permit\nhim to appeal to hedged laws in the way the laws account requires.\n\nSupposing anomalous monism is compatible with Fodor\u2019s account,\nyou might still wonder whether nomological sufficiency is enough for\ncausal relevance. An account of causal relevance in terms of laws is\nnatural given the tight connections between laws and properties (see\n laws of nature,\n \u00a73). But those sympathetic to Fodor\u2019s position might still\nask (as Fodor himself does) what the causal mechanism is in\nmental\u2013physical interactions. For example, it could turn out\nthat the reason psychophysical laws such as (L) hold is that mental\nproperties are themselves grounded in more basic, physical properties,\nand that only the latter do genuine causal work: mental properties\nagain look like freeloaders (\u00a75.3), merely piggybacking on the\nreal bearers of causal powers (LePore and Loewer 1989; Block 1990;\nLeiter and Miller 1994; Marras 2003).\n",
