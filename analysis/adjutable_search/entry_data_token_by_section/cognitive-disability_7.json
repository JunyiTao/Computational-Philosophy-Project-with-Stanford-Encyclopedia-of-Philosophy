Group-Based Accounts of Moral Status\n\nA number of philosophers have argued for the full moral status of all\nhuman beings, without seeking to identify any attribute possessed by\nall humans that would ground that status. These philosophers can be\nroughly divided into two groups. Those in the first group regard\nmembership in the species Homo sapiens as sufficient for full\nmoral status and ground that status in a species-based attribute (See\n Sec. 5.1).\n For some philosophers within this first group, all homo sapiens\nbelong to a kind whose nature or norm it is to possess rationality or\nsimilar attributes\n (Sec. 5.1.1).\n For others, all homo sapiens are connected through \u201cties of\nbirth\u201d to other human beings\n (Sec. 5.1.2).\n For the former, any being of a kind whose nature it is to be\nrational, etc. has full moral status; for the latter, any human\nrelated by birth to other human beings has full moral status. Although\nthe two approaches pick out the same individual human beings, the way\nin which they ground moral status gives them different implications\nfor the status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.\n\nThe former way of grounding moral status gives it a wider\n\u201cwrit,\u201d because the individual\u2019s moral status is not\nbased on his relationship to specific others. Rather, it is based on\nthe norm of a group to which she belongs. That norm demands\nrecognition by anyone, whether a member of the group or not, capable\nof recognizing it. If human beings with radical cognitive impairments\nhave full moral status by virtue of belonging to a group with the norm\nof rationality, a rational Martian, no less than a rational human,\nshould recognize the full moral status of humans with those\nimpairments. It might be possible to argue that the morally-relevant\nnorms of a group are not binding on those outside the group, but we\nhave not seen such an argument.\n\nIn contrast, ties of birth may not bind those lacking the same\nbiological connection; members of other species need not recognize the\nfull moral status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.\nIn that sense, the moral status of those human beings is not as\n\u201cfull\u201d as that of other human beings, since it must be\nrecognized only by other humans. If full moral status is based on\nduties of partiality toward members of the same group, it will be\ngroup-relative, not binding on members of other groups.\n\nThe second type of group-based account\n (Sec. 5.2)\n acknowledges the moral significance of the group-based attributes\nrelied on by the first type of group-based accounts. But it denies\nthat the full and equal moral status of human beings can be grounded\nin any specific attribute, even indirectly, that can be described in\nmorally neutral terms. These accounts regard \u201chuman being\u201d\nas a thick normative concept, grounded in language and social\npractice, that is not necessarily coextensive with the biological\ncategory of \u201cHomo sapiens,\u201d and that has moral content\nthat cannot be derived from any descriptive attribute associated with\nit. The judgment that a being is human and therefore must be treated\nrespectfully does not consist of a value-neutral biological\nclassification and an argument that establishes the moral status of\nbeings so classified. The requirement for certain kinds of treatment,\nand the prohibition of others, is part of the meaning of \u201chuman\nbeing\u201d and implicit in the recognition that a given individual\nis a human\n being.[9]\n Proponents of these accounts thus reject the very attempt to identify\na criterial attribute possessed by all beings with the moral status of\ncognitively normal human adults (Diamond 1978; Edwards 1997; Byrne\n2000). These philosophers reject the treatment of cognitively\nnondisabled adults as a paradigm for full moral status, and of\ninfants, young children, and radically cognitively disabled adults as\n\u201cmarginal cases\u201d whose moral status needs to be justified\nby\n extension.[10]\n\nFor both types of group-based accounts, the categorical nature of full\nmoral status is explained by the way in which that status is grounded.\nMembership in the human species, a sufficient condition of that status\nfor accounts of both types, is a categorical rather than a continuous\n\u201cvariable\u201d (although there may be some vagueness or\nambiguity due to imprecise or conflicting membership criteria). And\nfor both types of account, the grounding of full moral status is the\nsame for all human beings, regardless of their individual\nattributes.\n",
