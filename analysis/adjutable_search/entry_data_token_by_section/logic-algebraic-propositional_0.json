Abstract consequence relations\n\nTarski\u2019s work (1930a, 1930b, 1935, 1936) on the methodology of\nthe deductive sciences of the 1920s and 1930s studies the axiomatic\nmethod abstractly and introduces for the first time the abstract\nconcept of consequence operation. Tarski had mainly in mind the\ndifferent mathematical axiomatic theories. On these theories, the\nsentences that are proved from the axioms are consequences of them but\n(of course) almost all of them are not logical truths; under a\nsuitable formalization of these theories, a logical calculus like\nFrege\u2019s or Russell\u2019s can be used to derive the\nconsequences of the axioms. Tarski set the framework to study the most\ngeneral properties of the operation that assigns to a set of axioms\nits consequences.\n\nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\) and an arbitrary\nset of formulas \\(X\\), a formula \\(a\\)\nis deducible in \\(H\\) from \\(X\\)\nif there is a finite sequence of formulas any one of\nwhich belongs to \\(X\\) or is an axiom of \\(H\\)\nor is obtained from previous formulas in the sequence\nby one of the inference rules of \\(H\\). Such a sequence\nis a deduction (or proof) in \\(H\\) of \\(a\\)\nwith premises or hypotheses in \\(X\\).\nLet \\(Cn(X)\\) be the set of formulas deducible in \\(H\\)\nfrom the formulas in \\(X\\) taken as premises or\nhypothesis. This set is called the set of consequences of \\(X\\)\n(relative to the logical deduction system \\(H\\)).\n\\(Cn\\) is then an operation that is applied to sets\nof formulas to obtain new sets of formulas. It has the following\nproperties: For every set of formulas \\(X\\)\n\n\\(X \\subseteq Cn(X)\\)\n\\(Cn(Cn(X)) = Cn(X)\\)\n\\(Cn(X) = \\bigcup\\{Cn(Y): Y \\subseteq X, Y \\textrm{\nfinite}\\}\\)\n\n\nThe third condition  stipulates that \\(Cn(X)\\) is equal to the union of the set of\nformulas derivable from finite subsets of \\(X\\). Tarski\ntook these properties to define the notion of consequence operation\naxiomatically. In fact, he added that there is a formula \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(Cn(\\{x\\})\\) is the set \\(A\\)\nof all the formulas and that this set must be finite\nor of the cardinality of the set of the natural numbers. Condition (3)\nimplies the weaker, and important, condition of monotonicity\n\nif \\(X \\subseteq Y \\subseteq A\\), then \\(Cn(X)\n\\subseteq Cn(Y)\\).\n\n\nTo encompass the whole class of logic systems one finds in the\nliterature, a slightly more general definition than Tarski\u2019s is\nrequired. We will say that an abstract consequence operation\n\\(C\\) on an arbitrary set \\(A\\) is an\noperation that applied to subsets of \\(A\\) gives\nsubsets of \\(A\\) and for all \\(X, Y \\subseteq A\\)\nsatisfies the conditions (1), (2) and (4) above. If in addition \\(C\\)\nsatisfies (3) we say that it is a finitary\nconsequence operation.\n\nConsequence operations are present not only in logic but in many areas\nof mathematics. Abstract consequence operations are known as closure\noperators in universal algebra and lattice theory, for instance. In\ntopology the operation that sends a subset of a topological space to\nits topological closure is a closure operator. In fact, the topologies\non a set \\(A\\) can be identified with the closure\noperators on \\(A\\) that satisfy the additional\nconditions that \\(C(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing\\) and \\(C(X \\cup Y) =\nC(X) \\cup C(Y)\\) for all \\(X, Y \\subseteq A\\).\n\nGiven a consequence operation \\(C\\) on a set \\(A\\),\na subset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\)\nis said to be \\(C\\)-closed,\nor a closed set of \\(C\\), if \\(C(X) = X\\).\n\nA different, but mathematically equivalent, (formal) approach is to\nconsider consequence relations on a set of formulas instead of\nconsequence operations. A(n) (abstract) consequence relation\non the set of formulas of a formal language is a relation \\(\\vdash\\)\nbetween sets of formulas and formulas that satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\nif \\(a \\in X\\), then \\(X \\vdash a\\)\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\) and \\(X \\subseteq Y\\), then \\(Y \\vdash a\\)\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\) and for every \\(b \\in X, Y \\vdash b\\), then \\(Y\n\\vdash a\\).\n\n\nIt is finitary if in addition it satisfies\n\nif \\(X \\vdash a\\), then there is a finite set \\(Y \\subseteq X\\)\nsuch that \\(Y \\vdash a\\).\n\n\nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\), the relation\n\\(\\vdash\\) defined by \\(X \\vdash a\\) if \\(a\\) is\ndeducible from \\(X\\) in \\(H\\) is (according to all we have already seen) a\nfinitary consequence relation. Nonetheless, we are used not only to\nsyntactic definitions of consequence relations but also to semantic\ndefinitions. For example, we define classical propositional\nconsequence using truth valuations, first-order consequence relation\nusing structures, intuitionistic consequence relation using Kripke\nmodels, etc. Sometimes these model-theoretic definitions of\nconsequence relations define non-finitary consequence relations, for\nexample, the consequence relations for infinitary formal languages and\nthe consequence relation of second-order logic with the so-called\nstandard semantics.\n\nIn general, an abstract consequence relation on a set \\(A\\)\n(not necessarily the set of formulas of some formal\nlanguage) is a relation \\(\\vdash\\) between subsets of \\(A\\)\nand elements of \\(A\\) that satisfies\nconditions (1)\u2013(3) above. If it also satisfies (4) it is said to\nbe finitary. If \\(\\vdash\\) is an abstract consequence relation and \\(X\n\\vdash a\\), then we can say that \\(X\\) is a set of\npremises or hypothesis with conclusion \\(a\\) according\nto \\(\\vdash\\) and that \\(a\\) follows from \\(X\\),\nor is entailed by \\(X\\) (according to\n\\(\\vdash)\\). The abstract consequence relations correspond to\nKoslow\u2019s implication structures; see Koslow 1992 for the closely\nrelated but different approach to logics (in a broad sense) as\nconsequence relations introduced by that author.\n\nThe consequence operations on a set \\(A\\) are in\none-to-one correspondence with the abstract consequence relations on\n\\(A\\). The move from a consequence operation \\(C\\)\nto a consequence relation \\(\\vdash_C\\) and,\nconversely, from a consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) to a consequence\noperation \\(C_{\\vdash}\\) is easy and given by the definitions:\n\n\\[ X \\vdash_C a \\txtiff a \\in C(X) \\hspace{3mm} \\textrm{ and } \\hspace{3mm} a \\in C_{\\vdash}(X) \\txtiff X \\vdash a. \\]\n\n\nMoreover, if \\(C\\) is finitary, so is \\(\\vdash_C\\) and\nif \\(\\vdash\\) is finitary, so is \\(C_{\\vdash}\\).\n\nFor a general discussion on logical consequence see the entry\n Logical Consequence.\n",
