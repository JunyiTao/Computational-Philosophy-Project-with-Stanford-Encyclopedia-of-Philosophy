    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and the Multiverse || The Inverse Gambler\u2019s Fallacy Charge\n4.3 The Inverse Gambler\u2019s Fallacy Charge\n\nThe inverse gambler\u2019s fallacy, identified by Ian Hacking (1987),\nconsists in inferring from an event with a remarkable outcome that\nthere have likely been many more events of the same type in the past,\nmost with less remarkable outcomes. For example, the inverse\ngambler\u2019s fallacy is committed by someone who enters a casino\nand, upon witnessing a remarkable outcome at the nearest\ntable\u2014say, a five-fold six in a quintuple die\ntoss\u2014concludes that the toss is most likely part of a large\nsequence of tosses. Critics of the argument from fine-tuning for the\nmultiverse accuse it of committing the inverse gambler\u2019s\nfallacy. According to them, the argument commits this fallacy by, as\nWhite puts it, \n\n\nsupposing that the existence of many other universes makes it more\nlikely that this one\u2014the only one that we have\nobserved\u2014will be life-permitting. (White 2000: 263) \n\n\nVersions of this criticism are endorsed by Draper et al. (2007) and\nLandsman (2016). Hacking (1987) regards only those versions of the\nargument from fine-tuning for the multiverse as guilty of the inverse\ngambler\u2019s fallacy that infer the existence of multiple universes\nin a temporal sequence.\n\nAdherents of the inverse gambler\u2019s fallacy charge against the\nargument from fine-tuning for the multiverse object against focusing\non the impact of the proposition \\(R\\)\u2014that the conditions are\nright for life in some universe. According to them, we should\ninstead consider the impact of the more specific proposition \\(H\\):\nthat the conditions are right for life here, in this\nuniverse. If we replace \\(R\\) by \\(H\\), they argue, it becomes clear\nthat the argument breaks down because the existence of other universe\ndoes not raise the probability that this universe here is\nlife-friendly.\n\nMany philosophers defend the argument from fine-tuning for the\nmultiverse against this objection (McGrath 1988; Leslie 1988; Bostrom\n2002; Manson & Thrush 2003; Juhl 2005; Bradley 2009; Epstein\n2017). In an early response to Hacking, McGrath (1988) argues that the\nanalogy between the argument from fine-tuning for the multiverse and a\nperson who randomly enters a casino and witnesses a remarkable outcome\nis misleading: while the person entering a casino could have found any\narbitrary outcome, we could not have found ourselves in a universe\nwith conditions that are not right for life. The appropriate analogy\nto consider, according to McGrath, involves someone who is allowed to\nenter the casino only if and when some specific remarkable outcome\noccurs and who, upon being called in and finding that this outcome has\noccurred, infers the existence of other trials in the past. In\nthat scenario, the inference to multiple trials (in the past)\nis indeed rational, and so, according to McGrath, is the inference\nfrom fine-tuned conditions to multiple universes.\n\nThe adequacy of McGrath\u2019s casino analogy is contested as well.\nWhereas in McGrath\u2019s analogy the epistemic agent waits outside\nthe casino until the remarkable outcome occurs and she/he is called\nin, \u201cit is not as though we were disembodied spirits waiting for\na big bang to produce some universe which could accommodate us\u201d,\nas White puts it (2000: 268). Epstein (2017: 653) retorts that\n\u201cit is also not as though we were disembodied spirits keenly\nobserving [the universe] \u0251\u2014our designated potential\nhome\u2014and hoping that it, in particular, would be able to\naccommodate us.\u201d Epstein\u2019s diagnosis is that the inverse\ngambler\u2019s fallacy charge rests on the Requirement of Total\nEvidence in Bayesianism, which, according to him, is to be rejected in\ncases like these. Draper (2020) as well as Barrett and Sober (2020)\ndefend the Requirement of Total Evidence and, in doing so, attack\nEpstein\u2019s criticism of the inverse gambler\u2019s fallacy\ncharge. Bradley (2009) offers further casino analogies beyond those\nconsidered by Hacking, McGrath and White which, according to him,\nspeak in favour of rejecting the inverse gambler\u2019s fallacy\ncharge, but White\u2019s diagnosis continues to find support, e.g.,\nby Landsman (2016). Friederich (2019a; 2021: ch. 4) suggests that the\nquestion of whether we can rationally infer a multiverse from\nfine-tuning for life is so different from questions encountered in\nmore familiar contexts such as the casino scenarios that whether or\nnot the inference from fine-tuning to a multiverse commits the inverse\ngambler\u2019s fallacy may not have a determinate answer by the\nstandards of accepted rationality criteria.\n",
