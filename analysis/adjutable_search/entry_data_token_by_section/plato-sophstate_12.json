    "main_text": "Not-Being and Being || The Distinction between Difference and Being\n5.4 The Distinction between Difference and Being\n\n\nThe Stranger uses an important distinction to \nmark off difference from being:\n\n\nBut I suppose you agree that whereas some things are themselves by\nthemselves (auta kath\u2019 hauta), others are always said in\nrelation to other things (pros alla).\u2014Of\ncourse.\u2014But isn\u2019t difference always in relation to something\ndifferent (pros heteron)?\u2014Yes.\u2014And this would not\nbe the case, if being and difference were not distinct. For if\ndifference partook of both forms [i.e., auto kath\u2019 hauto and\npros alla], as being does, then something even among the\ndifferent things could be different without being different in\nrelation to something different. But in fact it has turned out for us\nthat necessarily whatever is different is the very thing that it is\n[i.e., different] from something different.  (Sophist\n255c\u2013d)\n\n\n\n\nSo the nature of difference is a fifth kind (Sophist 255d\u2013e).\n\n\nFurthermore, we shall say that it pervades all of them, since each\none is different from the others not because of its own nature, but\nbecause it partakes of the form of the different. (Sophist 255e)\n\n\n\n\nDifference is distinct from being, because difference is always \nrelative to other things (pros alla), whereas being is both \nitself by itself (auto kath\u2019 hauto) and relative to other \nthings (pros alla).\n\n\nWhat is it for something to be itself by itself and/or \nin relation to other things (for a detailed discussion of \nthis distinction, see Dancy 1999)? The traditional understanding of \nthe distinction relies on a passage from Diogenes Laertius (first \nhalf of the 3rd century CE). Diogenes uses the expression \n\u201cin relation to something\u201d (pros ti) in place of\n\u201cin relation to other things\u201d (pros alla):\n\n\nOf things that are, some are by themselves (kath\u2019 heauta),\nwhereas others are said in relation to something (pros ti).\nThings said by themselves are ones that need nothing further in their\ninterpretation. These would be, for instance, man, horse and other\nanimals, since none of these gains through interpretation. All the\nthings said in relation to something need in addition some\ninterpretation, for instance, that which is greater than something and\nthat which is quicker than something and the more beautiful and such\nthings. For the greater is greater than something less and the quicker\nis quicker than something. So of things-that-are some are said\nthemselves by themselves (auta kath\u2019 hauta), whereas others are\nsaid in relation to something (pros ti). In this way,\naccording to Aristotle, he [Plato] used to divide the primary things.\n(Diogenes Laertius 3.108\u2013109)\n\n\n\n\nMany scholars think that, in saying that being is said both itself by\nitself (auto kath\u2019 hauto) and in relation to other things\n(pros alla), Plato distinguishes different senses of the verb\n\u201cto be\u201d\u2014a complete or absolute sense\n(\u201cexists,\u201d as in \u201cThe sea is\u201d) and an\nincomplete sense (the \u201cis\u201d of predication, as in\n\u201cthe sea is blue\u201d and/or the \u201cis\u201d of identity,\nas in \u201cthe sea is the sea\u201d) (Cornford 1935; Ackrill\n1957). There is no separate verb \u201cto exist\u201d in classical\nGreek; existence was expressed by means of the verb \u201cto\nbe.\u201d\n\n\nIf the Stranger characterizes being as having two (or more) senses, we\nexpect Plato to mention two (or more) forms of being, one for each\nsense. Note that the Stranger introduces sameness as a distinct kind,\nwhich should take care of the \u201cis\u201d of identity, so the\nreal issue is whether Plato distinguishes two other senses of the verb\n\u201cto be,\u201d a complete existential sense and an incomplete\npredicative sense. Michael Frede (1967, 1992) and G. E. L. Owen (1971)\nargue that Plato does not mark off two senses of the verb \u201cto\nbe,\u201d but only different uses. There are significant differences\nbetween these scholars\u2019 views, but their common ground, that Plato\nuses \u201cbeing\u201d only as an incomplete predicate, has been\nqueried. Sentences in the Sophist, such as \u201cChange is,\nbecause it partakes of being\u201d (Sophist 256a), are most\nnaturally construed as using \u201cis\u201d as a complete predicate\n(existence).\n\n\nBut if Plato does use the verb \u201cto be\u201d as a complete\npredicate, why does he not mention two forms, existence and a form\ndesignated by the incomplete \u201cis\u201d of predication? Lesley\nBrown (1986) has argued that there is no sharp semantic distinction\nbetween the two syntactically distinct uses of the verb \u201cto\nbe\u201d in \u201cx is F\u201d and \u201cx\nis.\u201d The \u201cis\u201d in \u201cx is\u201d is\ncomplete but allows a further completion. If Brown is right, Plato\nneed not distinguish two senses of \u201cis,\u201d and claims in the\nSophist, such as \u201cChange is, because it partakes of\nbeing,\u201d can also be accommodated. Change is (exists), because it\nis something\u2014it has a property that makes it the very thing that\nit is: change.\n\n\nNotice that on this view the complete use of \u201cis\u201d in \nGreek does not correspond to existence in our modern sense: we say \nthat horses exist, whereas imaginary objects, such as Pegasus, do not. \nOn the proposed interpretation, anything describable is (exists). So \nPegasus is (exists), since we can describe him as a winged horse. On \nthe other hand, what-is-not is nothing at all\u2014indescribable. It\nwas this notion of not-being\u2014nothing\u2014that was responsible\nfor the earlier puzzles about not-being in the Sophist. (For\ncriticisms of Brown\u2019s view, see Malcolm 2006b, and for criticisms of \nMalcolm and Brown, see Leigh 2008.)\n\n\nSupposing that being is a structural kind that functions in two ways,\nlet us consider its operation with categorial and other structural\nkinds. Take some kind F-ness. F-ness is itself by itself\n(auto kath\u2019 hauto), if being links F-ness to its own nature,\nto what F-ness is by (or because of) itself. For instance, change is\nchanging by itself, largeness is large by itself, heat is hot by\nitself, the one is one by itself. The associated statements are\nself-predications of the sort Plato\u2019s characters mention in earlier\ndialogues (\u201clargeness is large,\u201d \u201cjustice is\njust;\u201d for self-predications in the Sophist, see\n258b\u2013c). Scholars disagree about how to understand\nself-predication in Plato. (For a view quite different from that\narticulated here, see the entry on\n Plato: middle period metaphysics and epistemology.)\n In self-predications the item specified by the\nsubject-expression and the item specified by the predicate are\nidentical, but the relation between them is participation\n(cf. Heinaman 1981). F-ness has its own nature by (or because of)\nitself. One might say that the property F-ness exhausts what\nF-ness is in its own right.\n\n\nF-ness is in relation to other things, if being links F-ness \nto something other than itself. For instance, change is \ndifferent from rest. Here being links change to difference, and \ndifference relates change to something other than change. Or change \nis the same as itself: \u201cWhen we say change is the same\nas itself, we speak in this way because of its participation in \nthe same in relation to itself [pros \nheaut\u00ean])\u201d (Sophist 256a\u2013b). Being links change to sameness,\nand sameness relates change to itself.\n\n\nNotice that Plato speaks often of participation and blending but \nmentions no distinct form of participation. He mentions no distinct \nform, because being simply is the form that links a subject to a \nproperty it has.\n\n\nDifference always operates in relation to something different (pros \nheteron) (Sophist 255d). Difference invariably relates the kind F-ness to \nsomething different from F-ness.\n\n\nAlthough difference as a structural kind always relates an entity\nF-ness to something other than F-ness, difference can itself be a\nsubject-kind and be related to itself (via being itself by\nitself). Difference is different by (or because of) itself\n(Sophist 259a\u2013b, with 255e and 258b\u2013c). Being and\ndifference admit of self-predication like any other kind.\n",
