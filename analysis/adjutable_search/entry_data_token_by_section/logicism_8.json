    "main_text": "Constructive Logicism || Execution\n4.3 Execution\n\nA theory of this kind, called constructive logicism, was\npresented in Tennant (1987). Its distinguishing features may be\nsummarized as follows.\n\nFinitude: It proves the existence of numbers of\nconcepts with at most finite extensions;\nLogical weakness: it uses only free\nintuitionistic relevant logic;\nConceptual Adequacy: It proves all instances of\nSchema N (for which, see below);\nRigor: It provides a \u2018fully rigorous\ndeduction of the Peano postulates\u2019 (Burgess 2005:\n 147).[45]\nSingle-barreled abstraction: Its basic principles\nare rules of inference effecting \u2018single-barreled\u2019\nabstraction.\n\n\nConstructive logicism departs altogether from both the formal method\nof the Grundgesetze, with its double-barreled abstraction\nprinciple Basic Law V, and from the use of use Hume\u2019s Principle,\nwhich is many neo-logicists\u2019 choice of starting point\u2014but\ndouble-barreled once again. It is essential (and prophylactically\nsufficient) to make this departure in a free logic, that is,\na logic free of the dogmatic (and straitjacketing) Fregean assumption\nthat every well-formed singular term of one\u2019s language must\ndenote some object. Single-barreled abstraction principles can be\nformulated in free logic as introduction and elimination rules for any\nvariable-binding abstraction operator \\(\\alpha\\), governing its\noccurrences in canonical identity statements of the form \\(t\n= @ xA(x)\\). The constructive logicist, of course, seeks to take\n\\(\\#\\) for \\(@\\).\n\nDetails of this alternative approach, in pursuit of neologicist\nderivation of the theories not only of natural numbers, but also of\nrational and real numbers, are to be found in Tennant 2022. The\napproach can also be applied to set theory itself; see Tennant\nforthcoming. There, the revealed \u2018logic of sets\u2019 is what\nQuine called virtual set theory: the body of doctrine that we\nwould call analytic, concerning the interconnections among\nset-abstraction, predication, and membership, without making any\nontological commitments. Zermelo\u2019s Axiom of Extensionality is\nderivable as a logical theorem on this approach.\n\nConstructive logicism is based on rules of natural deduction that are\narguably analytic of the central notions zero (0), successor \\((s)\\),\nand \u2018number of\u2019 (\\(\\#\\)). The rules pin down the meaning\nof the number-term-forming operator \\(\\# x\\Phi(x)\\) (the number of\n\\(\\Phi\\)s). In the terminology introduced above, the rules for \\(\\#\nx\\) amount to a single-barreled abstraction principle. The\nremaining rules are allowed to carry only very local and modest\nontological commitment, on the grounds that it is part of the very\nmeaning of a term such as \u20180\u2019 that its use in the language\ncommits one to the existence of the number 0. Here, for example, are\nthe natural-deduction rules governing zero. \u2018\\(\\bot\\)\u2019 is\nthe symbol for absurdity.\n\n\n \n\\[\\text{0-Introduction }\\frac{\n\\begin{array}{c} \n\\underbrace{{\\scriptsize (i)}\\dfrac{\\ }{F(a)}\\ \\ \\dfrac{\\ }{\\exists!a}{\\scriptsize (i)}}  \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\ \\bot \\end{array} }\n{ 0 = \\# xF(x) }{\\scriptsize{(i)}}\\]\n \n \n\\[\\text{0-Elimination }\\frac{0= \\# xF(x) \\quad \\exists !t F(t)}{\\bot }\n\\]\n  \n\n(where the parameter \\(a\\) may occur only in the\nassumptions)\n \n\n\nIn order to temper the modest commitment just mentioned, all\nderivations are constructed within a free logic, so that all\nexistential commitments other than those incurred by the rules\nthemselves would have to be made\n explicit.[46]\n All of the existential commitments that the constructive logicist\nincurs in this way will be incurred, anyway, by the HP-er who\nadvocates Hume\u2019s Principle in its unrestricted form. Recall that\nthe HP-er is committed, not only to the number of all natural numbers,\nbut also to the number of all self-identical things.\n\nThe ontological bill for the constructive logicist is much more\nmodest, compared to that of the HP-er. The constructive logicist is\nnot even committed (by the rules he lays down) to the existence of the\nnumber of all natural numbers. Commitment is incurred (by employing\nFrege\u2019s trick) to the natural numbers seriatim, as\nnecessary existents. No commitment is incurred, however, to any other\ncardinal numbers.\n\nChapter 25 of Tennant (1987), titled \u201cOn deriving the basic laws\nof arithmetic: Or, how to Frege\u2013Wright a Dedekind-Peano\u201d,\nprovides detailed formal derivations of the Dedekind-Peano axioms,\nwithin a free, intuitionistic relevant logic. All the derivations\ngiven are intuitionistic, in conformity with the anti-realist\naspirations explained above, and in order to warrant the adjective\n\u2018constructive\u2019 in the phrase \u2018constructive\nlogicism\u2019.\n\nHeck (1997b) dealt with so-called \u2018finite Frege\narithmetic\u2019. His treatment was classical. But Heck was\nconcerned, as constructive logicism had been, to derive the basic laws\nof arithmetic while incurring ontological commitment only to the\nnatural numbers. To this end Heck restricted Hume\u2019s Principle to\npredicates with finite extensions. It is therefore natural to\nconjecture that constructive logicism is the intuitionistic\n(relevant) fragment of Heck\u2019s finite Frege arithmetic.\n\nTennant (1987) argues that a condition of adequacy for any logicist\ntheory is to explain the applicability of the finite cardinals (see p.\n234). Let \\(\\exists_n xFx\\) be the formula of first-order logic with\nidentity, defined inductively in the usual way, that says that there\nare exactly \\(n F\\)s. Let \\(\\underline{n}\\) be the numeral denoting\nthe natural number \\(n\\), that is, \u201c\\(s\\ldots s0\\)\u201d, with\n\\(n\\) occurrences of the successor symbol \\(s\\). Schema N is the\nfollowing biconditional, an instance of which is obtained by fixing on\na particular natural number \\(n\\) and open formula \\(\\Phi\\).\n\n\\[\n\\tag{Schema N} \\# x\\Phi x = \\underline{n} \\leftrightarrow \\exists_n x\\Phi x.\n\\]\n\n\nAn adequate theory of number would allow one to derive every instance\nof Schema\n N;[47]\n and the theory of constructive logicism does that. Tennant suggests\nthat this constitutes a solution to the problem of the applicability\nof natural numbers in counting finite collections.\n\nAll the logicist accounts discussed so far dealt only with zero,\nsuccessor, and \u201c\u2026is a natural number\u201d. But there\nare important differences among them. It is not at all clear that\nconstructive logicism has the same high consistency-strength of Frege\nArithmetic. There appears to be no way to derive, within the\nconstructive logicist system, an existence claim of the form\n\n\\[\n\\exists y(y = \\# xF(x)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the extension of \\(F\\) is an infinite set (such as the set of\nall natural numbers). Contrast this with the fact that FA proves\n\n\\[\\exists y(y = \\# x(x \\text{ is a natural\nnumber})).\\]\n\n\nThe present author therefore conjectures that the consistency-strength\nof this system is lower than that of FA.\n\nIn Tennant (2009), the constructive logicist treatment is extended to\ndeal with both addition and multiplication. The key innovation is a\n\u2018logic of orderly pairing\u2019: a system of natural-deduction\nrules of inference governing the formation of the ordered pair\n\\(\\pi(t,u)\\) from existing objects \\(t\\) and \\(u\\), and the\nprojections \\(\\lambda(u)\\) of the left, and \\(\\varrho(u)\\) of the\nright, member of any ordered pair \\(u\\).\n",
