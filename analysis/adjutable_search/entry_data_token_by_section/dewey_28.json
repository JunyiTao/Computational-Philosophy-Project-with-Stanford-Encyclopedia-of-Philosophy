    "main_text": "Religion, Religious Experience and A Common Faith || Dewey\u2019s Religious Background\n9.1 Dewey\u2019s Religious Background\n\nDewey grew up in a religious family; his mother was especially devout\nand pressured her sons to live up to a similar devotion. His family\nchurch was Congregationalist; a bit later, including in college,\nLiberal Evangelicalism proved to be a more acceptable form of\nChristianity. At twenty-one, while living in Oil City, Pennsylvania,\nDewey had a \u201cmystic experience\u201d which he reported to\nfriend Max Eastman: \n\n\nThere was no vision, not even a definable emotion\u2014just a\nsupremely blissful feeling that his worries [about whether he prayed\nsufficiently in earnest] were over. (Dykhuizen 1973: 22) \n\n\nDewey belonged to congregations for about thirty-five years and turned\naway circa 1894, as he left for a post in Chicago. From then on,\nDewey\u2019s deepest loyalties lay outside religion; he was, as John\nJ. McDermott put it, \n\n\nan unregenerate philosophical naturalist, one for whom the human\njourney is constitutive of its own meaning and is not to be rescued by\nany transcendent explanations, principles of accountability, or\nposthumous salvation. (McDermott 2006, 50\u201351)\n\n\nDewey returned to philosophical issues of religion in the\n1930\u2019s. \u201cWhat I Believe\u201d (1930, LW5) argued for a\nnew kind of \u201cfaith\u201d, a \u201ctendency toward\naction\u201d. Such a faith would not be directed transcendentally,\nbut would signify that \u201cexperience itself is the sole ultimate\nauthority\u201d (\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 267). This is not\nself-enclosed experience, of course, but comes from \u201cthe full\nparticipation of all our powers in the endeavor to wrest from each\nchanging situation of experience its own full and unique\nmeaning\u201d (\u201cWhat I Believe\u201d, LW5: 272). In\n1933\u201334, Dewey gave the Terry Lectures at Yale, later published\nas A Common Faith (1934a, ACF, LW9), Dewey\u2019s\nmajor statement on religion and religious experience.\n",
