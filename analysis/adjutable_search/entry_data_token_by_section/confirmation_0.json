    "main_text": "Confirmation by instances\n1. Confirmation by instances\n\nIn a seminal essay on induction, Jean Nicod (1924) offered the\nfollowing important remark:\n\n\nConsider the formula or the law: \\(F\\) entails \\(G\\). How can a\nparticular proposition, or more briefly, a fact affect its\nprobability? If this fact consists of the presence of \\(G\\) in a case\nof \\(F\\), it is favourable to the law [\u2026]; on the contrary, if\nit consists of the absence of \\(G\\) in a case of \\(F\\), it is\nunfavourable to this law. (219, notation slightly adapted)\n\n\nNicod\u2019s work was an influential source for Carl Gustav\nHempel\u2019s (1943, 1945) early studies in the logic of\nconfirmation. In Hempel\u2019s view, the key valid message of\nNicod\u2019s statement is that the observation report that an object\n\\(a\\) displays properties \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) (e.g., that \\(a\\) is a swan\nand is white) confirms the universal hypothesis that all \\(F\\)-objects\nare \\(G\\)-objects (namely, that all swans are white). Apparently, it\nis by means of this kind of confirmation by instances that one can\nobtain supporting evidence for statements such as \u201csodium salts\nburn yellow\u201d, \u201cwolves live in a pack\u201d, or\n\u201cplanets move in elliptical orbits\u201d (also see Russell\n1912, Ch. 6). We will now see the essential features of Hempel\u2019s\nanalysis of confirmation.\n",
