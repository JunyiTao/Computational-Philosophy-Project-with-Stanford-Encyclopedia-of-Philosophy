    "main_text": "Knowledge and certification || Awareness as presumptively knowledge\n3.1 Awareness as presumptively knowledge\n\nThe processes of perception, inference, analogy, and testimony\ngenerate \u201cawareness,\u201d anubhava, a technical term,\nas mentioned, meaning \u201cpresentation of fresh news.\u201d No\nnon-veridical awarenesses are produced from the sources, but there are\nof course occasions when we are fooled. There are pseudo-sources,\nprocesses closely resembling the true ones, but flawed in some way and\ngenerating wrong results. Consonantly, there are awarenesses that at\nthe time we take to be telling us something true in the usual\nfashions\u2014by perception and the rest\u2014but are actually false\nor not produced correctly. These are instances of\n\u201cnon-knowledge,\u201d apram\u0101, contrasting with\npram\u0101, \u201cknowledge,\u201d entailing truth and\nright production.\n\nPragmatic considerations reinforce our natural tendency to take the\ndeliverances of the sources to be veridical. We couldn\u2019t get\nalong in the world without knowledge, as Naiy\u0101yikas as early as\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana stress (1996: 2). This is a recurrent theme.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba relies on \u201cpragmatic contradiction\u201d to\nrefute a skeptic about inference in the Jewel\u2019s\n\u201cHypothetical Reasoning\u201d section (2020: 647\u201351):\n\n\nWhen there is doubt, there is no regular pattern of behavior. When\nthere is a regular pattern, doubt does not occur. Thus it has been\nsaid (by Udayana): \u201cThat is doubted concerning which as doubted\nthere occurs no contradiction with the doubter\u2019s\naction.\u201d\n\nFor it is not possible at once to resort regularly to fire and the\nlike for smoke and the like and to doubt that fire causes it. This is\nhow we should understand the saying.\n\nThus we may reject the argument that contradiction\u2014understood as\nnatural opposition (virodha), governing precisely which F\ncannot occur along with precisely which G\u2014cannot block an\ninfinite regress. It is the doubter\u2019s own behavior that proves\nthe lie to the doubt, that blocks it (pratibandhaka).\n\n\nIt may be true that repeated observation (\u201ceven hundreds of\ntimes\u201d) is insufficient to guarantee knowledge of a pervasion\n(pervasions underpin the natural entailments on which inference\ndepends). Not all things made out of earth are scratchable by iron;\ndiamonds, recently discovered, are a counterexample. Defending\npervasion-knowledge nevertheless, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba cites this case\nin admitting that the possibility of a counterexample cannot be\neliminated, at least generally speaking. But we do grasp pervasions,\nand often meaningful doubt can be done away with. Absolute freedom\nfrom doubt is not required to have knowledge. And knowledge guides\naction. We may be wrong in any particular case, but we act on the\nbasis of the regularities in nature we take ourselves to be aware of,\nautomatically making inferences producing knowledge.\n\nThe same goes for perception, analogy, and testimony. With testimony,\nfor example, we may be aware of a defeater, a speaker\u2019s being a\nliar, for instance, but in such a case we do not take ourselves to be\npresented with news. Perceptual and other awarenesses do not occur\nwhen blocked, when defeated in this way. A good example is the fallacy\ncalled b\u0101dhita, \u201cdefeated in advance.\u201d No\ninference purporting to show that fire is cold can be successful\nbecause we already know it\u2019s hot. But of course some defeaters\noccur to us only later, and for a time we are fooled. In the market,\nwe learn that the piece of shell we thought was silver is really only\nmother-of-pearl. Awarenesses are presumptively knowledge, but are also\ndefeasible. The exception concerns certain matters known by\napperception (see below), which, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba argues, are known\nwithout the possibility of being wrong.\n\nIn sum, the defeasibility character of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\ntheory of knowledge centers on the fact that apparently trustworthy\nsources of information at times mislead. But in those cases it is not\nreally the knowledge sources, perception, and the rest, that are at\nwork but rather close imitators. Knowledge sources\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) themselves are inerrant. This makes the\nconcept of the apparent source central\n(pram\u0101\u1e47\u00e2bh\u0101sa): \u201cYou can't really\nsee John from this distance.\u201d Awareness naturally taken\nto be informative is presumptively true but the presumption can be\ndefeated. It can also be certified. Defeating and certifying belong to\na second-level of knowing where we are self-conscious about\njustification. But there, too, we give the benefit of the doubt,\nb\u0101dhakam vin\u0101, \u201cunless there is a\ndefeater.\u201d In this way there is no justification regress as\nfeared by Western foundationalists and alleged by the second-century\nBuddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (1978).\n",
