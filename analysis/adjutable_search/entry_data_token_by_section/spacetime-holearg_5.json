    "main_text": "The Price of Spacetime Substantivalism\n5. The Price of Spacetime Substantivalism\n\nSo far we have characterized the substantivalist doctrine as the view\nthat spacetime has an existence independent of its contents. This\nformulation conjures up powerful if vague intuitive pictures, but it\nis not clear enough to be deployed in the context of the\ninterpretation of physical theories. If we represent spacetime by a\nmanifold of events, how do we characterize the independence of its\nexistence? Is it the counterfactual claim that were there no metric or\nmatter fields, there would still be a manifold of events? That\ncounterfactual is automatically denied by the standard formulation\nwhich posits that all spacetimes have at least metrical structure.\nThat seems too cheap a refutation of manifold substantivalism. Surely,\nthere must be an improved formulation. Fortunately, we do not need to\nwrestle with finding it. For present purposes we need only consider a\nconsequence of the substantivalist view and can set aside the task of\ngiving a precise formulation of that view.\n\nIn their celebrated debate over space and time, Leibniz taunted the\nsubstantivalist Newton\u2019s representative, Clarke, by asking how\nthe world would change if East and West were switched. For Leibniz\nthere would be no change since all spatial relations between bodies\nwould be preserved by such a switch. But the Newtonian substantivalist\nhad to concede that the bodies of the world were now located in\ndifferent spatial positions, so the two systems were physically\ndistinct.\n\nCorrespondingly, when we spread the metric and matter fields\ndifferently over a manifold of events, we are now assigning metrical\nand material properties in different ways to the events of the\nmanifold. For example, imagine that a galaxy passes through some event\nE in the hole. After the hole transformation, this galaxy might not\npass through that event. For the manifold substantivalist, this must\nbe a matter of objective physical fact: either the galaxy passes\nthrough E or not. The two distributions represent two physically\ndistinct possibilities.\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Does the galaxy pass through\nevent \\(E\\)?\n\n\nThat is, manifold substantivalists must (it seems) deny an equivalence\ninspired by Leibniz\u2019 taunt which is thus named after\n him:[5]\n\nLeibniz Equivalence. If two distributions of fields\nare related by a smooth transformation, then they represent the same\nphysical systems.\n\n\nThe supplementary document\n Visualizing Leibniz Equivalence Through Map Projections\n illustrates the essential idea of Leibniz Equivalence through an\nanalogy with different map projections of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface.\n",
