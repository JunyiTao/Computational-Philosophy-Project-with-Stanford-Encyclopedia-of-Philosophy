    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk || Americanist Romantic Longing\n2.1 Americanist Romantic Longing\n\nIn his 1992 article \u201cW.E.B. Du Bois and the Idea of Double\nConsciousness\u201d, Dickson D. Bruce Jr. suggests a variety of\nsources of the complex of meanings marshaled at the time by Du\nBois\u2019s use of the term. The \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d\nfigure stems from the European romantic opposition between an innate\nhuman affinity for the transcendent and a pragmatic\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d grounded in a utilitarian attitude, oriented\nto mundane need and commercial enterprise. Tracing this understanding\nof double consciousness back to the American philosopher Ralph Waldo\nEmerson (and before him to Goethe), who used the term in his essay,\n\u201cThe Transcendentalist\u201d (1842), Bruce maintains that this\nanti-bourgeois romanticism is a \u201cfigurative background\u201d of\nDu Bois\u2019s use of the term, to which Du Bois brought the idea\nthat\n\nthe essence of a distinctive African consciousness was its\nspirituality\u2026 revealed among African Americans in their\nfolklore, their history of patient suffering, and their faith. (Bruce\n1999 [1992]: 238)\n\n\nBruce also briefly traces the trajectory of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in the medical and psychological\nliterature of the nineteenth century. An early appearance of the term\nin the Medical Repository in 1817 (Mitchill 1817: 185) used\nit to name the condition of one Mary Reynolds, who, for a period of\nabout fifteen years beginning in her nineteenth, alternately lived two\ndistinct lives, with wholly different personalities,\n\u2018uncognizant of\u2019 and inaccessible to each other. This use\nof the term had some currency throughout the nineteenth century;\nWilliam James, one of Du Bois\u2019s Harvard philosophy professors,\ndescribed such cases as alternating between \u201cprimary and\nsecondary consciousnesses\u201d in his considerable discussion of\nthem in the Principles of Psychology (1890: see esp. Vol. I,\n379\u2013393), published while Du Bois was at Harvard (although James\ndoes not seem to have used the term\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d) (Bruce 1999 [1992]: 240\u20131).\nBruce comments that\n\n\u2026based on Du Bois\u2019s use of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d in his Atlantic essay he\ncertainly seems to have known the term\u2019s psychological\nbackground, because he used it in ways quite consistent with that\nbackground. (1999: 242)\n\n\n[Bruce does not note the appearance of the term, in French \u2013\n\u201cdouble conscience\u201d \u2013 in Josef Breuer and\nSigmund Freud\u2019s \u201cOn the Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical\nPhenomena\u201d published in 1893 in Neurologisches\nCentralblatt, Nos. 1 and 2. This paper was later reprinted as the\nfirst chapter of Studies on Hysteria, published in 1895.\nBreuer and Freud appear to use the French term in responding to and\ndeveloping its earlier use by Pierre Janet, relating it to\n\u201csplitting of consciousness\u201d and psychic\n\u201cdissociation\u201d. (For a discussion of the\nBreuer-Freud-Janet connection, see James Strachey\u2019s introduction\nto Studies on Hysteria.)]\n\nThe diverse associations of these senses of the term were crucial,\nBruce argues, to the resonance and suggestiveness of Du Bois\u2019s\ndistinctive use of the term: connotations of spiritual longing and\nunbridgeable opposition between two viewpoints, of the real\ndistinctiveness and moral parity of the two personae and the\npossibility of their merging in a new synthetic unity signifying a\ncure, a fact reported in a number of cases of the psychological\nmalady.\n",
