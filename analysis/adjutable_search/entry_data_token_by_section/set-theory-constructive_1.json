    "main_text": "The Essence of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theory || Axiomatic freedom\n1.1 Axiomatic freedom\n\n\nClassical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is based on classical\nfirst-order predicate logic with equality. On top of the logical\nprinciples are axioms and schemata which describe the notion of set\nthe theory codifies. These principles can be classified into three\nkinds. First, there are principles that enable us to form new sets\nfrom given ones. For example, the axiom of pair allows us to form a\nset which is the pair of two given sets. Secondly, there are\nprinciples that establish properties of the set theoretic\nstructure. For example, the axiom of extensionality identifies all\nsets having the same elements. Third, and finally, there are axioms\nasserting the existence of specific sets. Thus the axiom of infinity\nstates that there is an infinite set. These principles all together\nare usually called the set-theoretic principles.\n\n\nWhen introducing versions of ZF based on intuitionistic logic, the\nfirst step is to eliminate from the logic the principle of the\nexcluded middle (EM). The next step is to choose a good stock of\nset-theoretic principles which faithfully represent the desired notion\nof constructive set. These tasks turn out to be more challenging than\none at first might have expected. In fact, as is well known, systems\nbased on a \u201cweaker\u201d logic have the ability to distinguish\nbetween statements which are equivalent from the point of view of a\n\u201cstronger\u201d logic. In the case of set theory, some of the\nZF axioms or schemata are often presented by one of many classically\nequivalent formulations. Classically it is only a matter of\nconvenience which one to use at a specific time. When working on the\nbasis of intuitionistic logic, however, various formulations of a\nclassical axiom may turn out to be distinct (non-equivalent). In fact,\none can envisage new statements which are classically equivalent to a\nZF axiom but intuitionistically separate from it (for example CZF\u2019s\nsubset collection axiom (Aczel 1978)).\n\n\nAs to the first step, consisting in eliminating the principle of\nexcluded middle from the logic, it turns out that simply evicting this\nprinciple from the underlying logic is insufficient; that is, it is\nnot enough to take the intuitionistic rather than the classical\npredicate calculus as our basis. We also need to ensure that the set\ntheoretic axioms do not bring undesirable forms of excluded middle\nback into our theory. For example, as noted by Myhill (1973), we need\nextra care in choosing an appropriate statement for the axiom of\nfoundation. Foundation is introduced in set theory to rule out sets\nwhich are members of themselves and thus \\(\\in\\)-chains of sets. The\nusual formulation of foundation asserts that each inhabited set (a set\nwith at least one element) has a least element with respect to the\nmembership relation. This statement, however, can be shown to yield\nconstructively unacceptable instances of excluded middle on the basis\nof modest set-theoretic assumptions. Therefore the usual formulation\nof foundation has to be omitted from a set theory based on\nintuitionistic logic. For a proof, see the supplementary document:\nSet-theoretic principles incompatible with intuitionistic logic.\nThe typical move in formulating set theories based on\nintuitionistic logic is then to replace foundation with the\nclassically equivalent schema of set induction, which does not have\nthe same \u201cside effects\u201d but has similar\n consequences.[1]\nAs to the second step, related to the selection of a good stock of \nset-theoretic principles, the schemata of replacement and\nseparation, and the axiom of power set have attracted most attention. For\nthe exact formulation of these principles see the supplementary\ndocument:\nAxioms of CZF and IZF.\n\n\nHere the following is a typical scenario. Given what are classically two variants\nof a single set-theoretic principle, their classical proof of equivalence requires \nat some point an instance of the excluded middle. However, in general this\nproof of equivalence will not carry through to an\nintuitionistic context, and thus what are classically two forms of one principle\nmay result into two distinct principles when working intuitionistically. \nChoosing one rather than\nthe other of them may therefore influence the notion of set we thus define. \nIn the context of constructive set theories like CZF, power set and \nseparation are \nreplaced by intuitionistically weaker principles. One reason for this is that \nthe full strenght of power set and full separation are seen as unnecessary, \nsince their weaker substitutes seem to \nsuffice for carrying out constructive mathematics. Another reason is that they \nare seen as philosophically problematic, since they may introduce forms of\nimpredicativity within the set theory (see the section on\n Predicativity in constructive set theory).\nThe case of replacement versus collection is somehow more complex (see,\nfor example, the articles (Friedman and Scedrov 1985), (Rathjen 2005)\nand (Rathjen 2012)). It is worth stressing that while adopting the\nusual formulation of foundation goes against the very assumption of\nintuitionistic logic as background logic, the principles of separation\nand power set have no incompatibility with intuitionistic logic at\nall, so much so that they are integral part of the intuitionistic\ntheory of sets IZF (Friedman 1973a).\n\n\n\nTo summarise, in formulating a set theory based on intuitionistic\nlogic, the first task is to expel the principle of excluded middle,\nincluding those instances of it which might be hidden in familiar\nformulations of set-theoretic axioms. The next task is to choose one\nversion of each classical principle which best characterises the\ndesired notion of set. This opens up a range of choices one can make,\nas a plurality of intuitionistic principles may correspond to one\nclassical principle. It should be stressed that from a constructive\npoint of view this plurality of options (and thus systems), rather\nthan causing uneasiness, is a highly desirable situation, as it\nconstitutes a form of \u201caxiomatic freedom\u201d. For example, it\nallows us to differentiate between a number of mathematical notions,\nthus better capturing our intuitions of them as distinct. It also\ngives us the freedom to choose the notions and theories which best\nsuit a given context. In addition, by adopting intuitionistic logic\nwe can include within our theories principles which are classically\nvery strong, without having to commit to their classical strength. For\nexample, one can add a notion of inaccessible set to a weak\nconstructive set theory and obtain a predicative theory,\nwhile the same notion embedded in a classical context becomes\nextremely strong (see the sections on\n Predicativity in constructive set theory and \nLarge sets in constructive and intuitionistic ZF).\nFinally, a rich area of (meta-theoretical) study of the relations\nbetween the resulting distinct set-theoretic systems naturally\narises. As one could expect, this freedom also has a price, as a\nhighly technical study of the axiomatic theories might be necessary to\ndistinguish their principles as well as to unveil some of their\nsubtleties. This again can be seen as an advantage, since it forces us\nto a deeper and clearer analysis of the mathematical notions involved\nand prompts us to develop new sophisticated tools.\n",
