Phenomenology and Ontology, Epistemology, Logic, Ethics\n\n\nThe discipline of phenomenology forms one basic field in philosophy\namong others. How is phenomenology distinguished from, and related to,\nother fields in philosophy?\n\n\nTraditionally, philosophy includes at least four core fields or\ndisciplines: ontology, epistemology, ethics, logic. Suppose\nphenomenology joins that list. Consider then these elementary\ndefinitions of field:\n\nOntology is the study of beings or their being\u2014what\nis.\nEpistemology is the study of knowledge\u2014how we know.\nLogic is the study of valid reasoning\u2014how to reason.\nEthics is the study of right and wrong\u2014how we should\nact.\nPhenomenology is the study of our experience\u2014how we\nexperience.\n\n\n\nThe domains of study in these five fields are clearly different, and\nthey seem to call for different methods of study.\n\n\nPhilosophers have sometimes argued that one of these fields is\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d, the most fundamental discipline, on which all\nphilosophy or all knowledge or wisdom rests. Historically (it may be\nargued), Socrates and Plato put ethics first, then Aristotle put\nmetaphysics or ontology first, then Descartes put epistemology first,\nthen Russell put logic first, and then Husserl (in his later\ntranscendental phase) put phenomenology first.\n\n\nConsider epistemology. As we saw, phenomenology helps to define the\nphenomena on which knowledge claims rest, according to modern\nepistemology. On the other hand, phenomenology itself claims to achieve\nknowledge about the nature of consciousness, a distinctive kind of\nfirst-person knowledge, through a form of intuition.\n\n\nConsider logic. As we saw, logical theory of meaning led Husserl\ninto the theory of intentionality, the heart of phenomenology. On one\naccount, phenomenology explicates the intentional or semantic force of\nideal meanings, and propositional meanings are central to logical\ntheory. But logical structure is expressed in language, either ordinary\nlanguage or symbolic languages like those of predicate logic or\nmathematics or computer systems. It remains an important issue of\ndebate where and whether language shapes specific forms of experience\n(thought, perception, emotion) and their content or meaning. So there\nis an important (if disputed) relation between phenomenology and\nlogico-linguistic theory, especially philosophical logic and philosophy\nof language (as opposed to mathematical logic per se).\n\n\nConsider ontology. Phenomenology studies (among other things) the\nnature of consciousness, which is a central issue in metaphysics or\nontology, and one that leads into the traditional mind-body problem.\nHusserlian methodology would bracket the question of the existence of\nthe surrounding world, thereby separating phenomenology from the\nontology of the world. Yet Husserl\u2019s phenomenology presupposes theory\nabout species and individuals (universals and particulars), relations\nof part and whole, and ideal meanings\u2014all parts of\nontology.\n\n\nNow consider ethics. Phenomenology might play a role in ethics by\noffering analyses of the structure of will, valuing, happiness, and\ncare for others (in empathy and sympathy). Historically, though,\nethics has been on the horizon of phenomenology. Husserl largely\navoided ethics in his major works, though he featured the role of\npractical concerns in the structure of the life-world or\nof Geist (spirit, or culture, as in Zeitgeist), and\nhe once delivered a course of lectures giving ethics (like logic) a\nbasic place in philosophy, indicating the importance of the\nphenomenology of sympathy in grounding ethics. In Being and\nTime Heidegger claimed not to pursue ethics while discussing\nphenomena ranging from care, conscience, and guilt to\n\u201cfallenness\u201d and \u201cauthenticity\u201d (all phenomena\nwith theological echoes). In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nanalyzed with subtlety the logical problem of \u201cbad faith\u201d,\nyet he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in good\nfaith (which sounds like a revised Kantian foundation for\nmorality). Beauvoir sketched an existentialist ethics, and Sartre left\nunpublished notebooks on ethics. However, an explicitly\nphenomenological approach to ethics emerged in the works of Emannuel\nLevinas, a Lithuanian phenomenologist who heard Husserl and Heidegger\nin Freiburg before moving to Paris. In Totality and Infinity\n(1961), modifying themes drawn from Husserl and Heidegger, Levinas\nfocused on the significance of the \u201cface\u201d of the other,\nexplicitly developing grounds for ethics in this range of\nphenomenology, writing an impressionistic style of prose with\nallusions to religious experience.\n\n\nAllied with ethics are political and social philosophy. Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty were politically engaged in 1940s Paris, and their\nexistential philosophies (phenomenologically based) suggest a\npolitical theory based in individual freedom. Sartre later sought an\nexplicit blend of existentialism with Marxism. Still, political theory\nhas remained on the borders of phenomenology. Social theory, however,\nhas been closer to phenomenology as such. Husserl analyzed the\nphenomenological structure of the life-world and Geist\ngenerally, including our role in social activity. Heidegger stressed\nsocial practice, which he found more primordial than individual\nconsciousness. Alfred Schutz developed a phenomenology of the social\nworld. Sartre continued the phenomenological appraisal of the meaning\nof the other, the fundamental social formation. Moving outward from\nphenomenological issues, Michel Foucault studied the genesis and\nmeaning of social institutions, from prisons to insane asylums. And\nJacques Derrida has long practiced a kind of phenomenology of\nlanguage, seeking social meaning in the \u201cdeconstruction\u201d\nof wide-ranging texts.  Aspects of French\n\u201cpoststructuralist\u201d theory are sometimes interpreted as\nbroadly phenomenological, but such issues are beyond the present\npurview.\n\n\nClassical phenomenology, then, ties into certain areas of\nepistemology, logic, and ontology, and leads into parts of ethical,\nsocial, and political theory.\n",
