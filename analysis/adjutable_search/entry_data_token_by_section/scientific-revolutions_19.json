    "main_text": "Other Revolution Claims and Examples || Nonlinear Dynamics\n6.4 The Essential Tension between Tradition and Innovation\n\nKuhn\u2019s work called attention to what he called \u201cthe\nessential tension\u201d between tradition and innovation (Kuhn 1959,\n1977a). While he initially claimed that his model applied only to\nmature natural sciences such as physics, chemistry, and parts of\nbiology, he believed that the essential tension point applies, in\nvarying degrees, to all enterprises that place a premium on creative\ninnovation. His work thereby raises interesting questions, such as\nwhich kinds of social structures make revolution necessary (by\ncontrast with more continuous varieties of transformative change) and\nwhether those that do experience revolutions tend to be more\nprogressive by some standard.\n\nSome analysts agree that casting the net more widely might shed\ncomparative light on scientific change, and that Kuhn\u2019s model is\ntoo restrictive even when applied only to the mature sciences. We have\nalready met several alternative conceptions of transformative change\nin the sciences. Kuhn believed that innovation in the arts was often\ntoo divergent fully to express the essential tension. By contrast, the\nsciences, he claimed, do not seek innovation for its own sake, at\nleast normal scientists do not.\n\nBut what about technological innovation (which is often closely\nrelated to mature science) and what about business enterprise more\ngenerally? There are, of course, important differences between the\nproducts of basic scientific research and commercial products and\nservices, but there are enough similarities to make comparison\nworthwhile\u2014the more so with today\u2019s emphasis on\ntranslational science. And in the sciences as well as economic life\nthere would seem to be other forms of displacement than the logical\nand epistemological forms commonly recognized by philosophers of\nscience. Consider the familiar economic phenomenon of obsolescence,\nincluding cases that lead to major social reorganization as\ntechnological systems are improved. Think of algorithmic data mining\nand statistical computation, robotics, and the automation to be found\nin any modern biological laboratory. In The Innovator\u2019s\nDilemma (1997), economist Clayton Christensen denies that major\ntechnological breakthroughs are either necessary or sufficient for\ndisruptive innovation. In that and later work he distinguishes\nsustaining technologies that make incremental improvements of a\ncompany\u2019s sales leaders from two kinds of disruptive\ntechnologies. \u201cNew-market disruptions\u201d appeal to a\npreviously non-existent market, whereas\n\u201clow-market\u201d or \u201clow-end disruptions\u201d provide\nsimpler and cheaper ways to do things than do the leading products and\nservices. Such companies can sometimes scale up their more efficient\nprocesses to displace the major players, as did Japanese steel makers\nto the big U.S. corporations. There would seem to be parallels in the\nhistory of science.\n\nSpeaking of technological developments, philosophers, including Kuhn,\nhave undervalued a major source of transformative developments,\nnamely, material culture, specifically the development of new\ninstruments. There is, however, a growing literature in history and\nsociology of science and technology. A good example is Andy\nPickering\u2019s discussion of the conception and construction of the\nlarge cloud chamber at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (Pickering 1995).\nPickering\u2019s Constructing Quarks (1984), Peter\nGalison\u2019s How Experiments End (1987) and Image and\nLogic (1997), and Sharon Traweek\u2019s Beamtimes and\nLifetimes (1988) describe the cultures that grew up around the\nbig machines and big theories of high-energy physics in the U.S.,\nEurope, and Japan. As he himself recognized, Kuhn\u2019s model of\nrapid change runs into increasing difficulty with the Big Science of\nthe World War II era and beyond. But a similar point extends to\nsmaller-scale material practices as documented by much recent\nresearch, as in Baird (2004), discussed above. One line of fruitful\ninvestigation has been that of the Social Construction of Technology\n(SCOT) program of Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker (see Bijker et al.\n1987 and a good deal of later work). Such work takes place on all\nscales.\n\nIn Structure and later writings, Kuhn locates revolutionary\nchange both at the logico-semantical and methodological level\n(incompatibility between successor and predecessor paradigm) and at\nthe level of form of community life and practice. But does the latter\nalways require the former? Perhaps expressions such as \u201cthe\nproblem of conceptual change\u201d and \u201cbreaking out\nof the old conceptual framework\u201d have led philosophers to\nover-intellectualize historical change. As we know from the history of\neconomics and business, one form of life can replace another in\nvarious ways without being based directly upon a logical or semantic\nincompatibility. The old ways may be not wrong but simply obsolete,\ninefficient, out of fashion\u2014destroyed by a process that requires\nmore resources than simple logical relations to understand it. There\ncan be massive displacement by non-logical means. Many have argued\nthat Kuhn\u2019s semantic holism, with its logical-relational\nunderpinnings, led him to underappreciate how flexible scientists and\ntechnologists can be at the frontiers of research (Galison 1997).\nHaving distinguished the working scientists\u2019 point of view from\nthose of the historian and the philosopher, looking down from above,\nhe proceeded to confuse them. Retrospectively, as many commentators\nhave noted, we can view Kuhn on scientific revolutions as a\ntransitional figure, more indebted to logical empiricist conceptions\nof logic, language, and meaning than he could have recognized at the\ntime, while departing sharply from the logical empiricists and Popper\nin other respects.\n",
