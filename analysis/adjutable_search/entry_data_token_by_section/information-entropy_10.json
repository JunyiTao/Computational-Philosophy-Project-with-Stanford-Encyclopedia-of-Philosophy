There are many reasons why one might feel that this raises\nproblems. For example, a Boltzmannian approach to statistical mechanics\ntakes the entropy of a system to depend only upon a confined region of\nthe microstate space, usually either that of microstates compatible\nwith a given macrostate, or accessible to the microstate over time.\nProbability distributions over inaccessible or macroscopically distinct\nregions should not, from this point of view, have thermodynamic\nsignificance. From an opposite point of view, a subjective Bayesian\nmight argue probability distributions are only expressions of an\nagent's uncertainty. If the intelligent demon is supposed to be the\nagent, it can hardly be uncertain of its own state once it has\nperformed the measurement.\n\n\nZurek (1989a; 1989b) proposed a development of the\nLandauer-Penrose-Bennett position, building on a suggestion of\nBennett's, that would attempt to address some of these concerns and\nalso whether a sufficiently cleverly programmed computer might be able\nto do better than Landauer's principle would suggest. If a demon\nperformed a large number of cycles without erasing its memory, as\nPenrose suggested, then its memory would contain a randomly generated\nbit string. Zurek's suggestion was that the Boltzmannian entropy of the\nphysical states representing the bit string needed to have added to it\nthe algorithmic complexity of the bit string itself and it is this\ntotal entropy that is the subject of a modified second law.\n\n\nThe algorithmic complexity of a bit string is a measure of how much\na given bit string can be compressed by a computer. A long, but\nalgorithmically simple, bit string can be compressed into a much\nshorter bit string. This shorter bit string could apparently be reset\nto zero, by resetting each individual bit, for a much lower cost than\nresetting each individual bit in the original longer bit string. A\nclever demon might, therefore, be able to compress its memory and so\navoid the full erasure cost that would be needed to ensure a modified\nsecond law holds.\n\n\nHowever, long randomly generated bit strings are, with high\nprobability, incompressible, so unless the demon was very lucky, this\ncould not work. Furthermore, the average algorithmic complexity of a\nstatistical mixture of bit strings is not less than the Shannon\ninformation of the statistical distribution. It can be shown,\ntherefore, that even if the best compression algorithms are available\nthe clever demon cannot do better, on average, than simply resetting\neach bit individually in its memory.\n\n\nZurek's proposed total entropy, given by the sum of the Boltzmannian\nentropy and the algorithmic complexity, is a property of the individual\nmicrostates, rather than of the probability distribution over the\noutcomes. It can decrease during macroscopically indeterministic\nprocesses, if a particularly algorithmically simple sequence of\noutcomes happens to occur. However, unlike the Boltzmann entropy, even\nduring macroscopically indeterministic processes it does not decrease\non average.\n",
