    "main_text": "\n\nFrom at least Aristotle onwards, ancient philosophers engaged in\nsystematic reflection on human agency. They asked questions about when\npeople are morally responsible for their actions and what must be the\ncase for people to deliberate and act effectively, and in doing so\nthey confronted arguments that tried to establish that humans are not\nresponsible and effective agents. But if we want to understand these\nphilosophers correctly, we should be careful not to assimilate ancient\ntheories of freedom and determinism too quickly to the problem of free\nwill and determinism in contemporary philosophy, which asks whether\ncausal determinism is compatible with the sort of freedom\u2014or\nalternatively, with the sort of control over our actions\u2014that is\nnecessary for moral responsibility. (See the entries on\n free will\n and\n causal determinism.)\n While ancient philosophers did argue about whether causal determinism\nis compatible with moral responsibility, their concerns ranged more\nwidely. We can divide their discussions into two broad areas.\n\nThe first is effective agency\u2014do humans have the\nability to act as they wish to, in order to get what they desire?\nAristotle thinks that effective deliberation and action presupposes\nthe openness or contingency of the future\u2014that what is going to\nhappen is not necessary. Aristotle confronts an argument that tries to\nestablish that the future is necessary, and hence that deliberation\nand action are futile. This argument, however, proceeds not from\ncausal determinism, but from what might be called \u201clogical\ndeterminism\u201d\u2014the thesis that, from eternity, statements\nabout the future have had fixed truth values. The Epicureans, Stoics,\nand academic skeptic Carneades confront the same argument, but they\nalso consider the relationship between \u201clogical\ndeterminism\u201d and causal determinism, and whether causal\ndeterminism is compatible with effective agency.\n\nThe second area is\nmoral responsibility, our ability to be justifiably subject\nto praise and reward, or blame and punishment for what we do.\nAristotle gives an extended analysis of voluntary actions, ones for\nwhich a person is responsible. He asserts that humans are the origin\nof their voluntary actions, and that we have the ability to do\notherwise than we do. But the problem of free will and determinism\ndoes not obviously arise in Aristotle\u2019s discussion, because he\ndoes not consider whether moral responsibility is compatible with\ncausal determinism, as a general thesis. Instead, he considers another\nthreat to our responsibility, which we may dub \u201cpsychological\ndeterminism\u201d: that our actions are automatically elicited by a\ncombination of our psychological states, such as our desires and\ncharacter traits, in conjunction with perceptual input, such that we are not\nreally in control of what we do. In response, Aristotle argues that we are in control of our character, because it is a result of\nour earlier voluntary actions. Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that we\nare in charge of our character, which results in our actions, and he\nalso contends that to argue that people are not responsible for their\nactions is self-refuting. Finally, Epicurus believes that causal\ndeterminism is incompatible with human freedom, and he introduces an\nindeterministic atomic motion, the \u201cswerve\u201d, to combat\nthis threat\u2014although how it is supposed to do so is unclear. The\nStoics, on the other hand, affirm that every single event is causally\ndetermined by God in accordance with his providential plan, and they\ntry to show how what we do is under our control in such a world. The\nlater Aristotelian Alexander of Aphrodisias reacts to the Stoics by\nbuilding an Aristotelian theory on which the ability to do otherwise\nis required for moral responsibility, and such an ability is\nincompatible with causal determinism. Plotinus, who takes himself to\nbe following Plato, incorporates Stoic elements into his own theory of\nfreedom, but his deep disagreements with Stoic metaphysics lead him to\nreject much of what they say about fate.\n",
