    "main_text": "Metaphysical and Nomic Modality\n3. The Structure of the Modal Realm\n\nThe concepts of metaphysical, epistemic, and nomic necessity are only\na few of the modal notions that figure in our thought and discourse\n(as should be clear from the long list of uses of modal terms given in\nthe introduction to this entry). We also speak of\n\n(6)\n Practical necessity\n\nLogical necessity\n\nBiological necessity\n\nMedical necessity\n\nMoral necessity\n\nLegal necessity \n\n\nand of a whole lot more. One would expect that some of these modal\nconcepts can be defined in terms of others. But how can that be done?\nAnd is it possible to single out a small number of fundamental notions\nof necessity in terms of which all the others can be defined?\n\nIt may be helpful in approaching these questions to distinguish\nbetween two salient ways in which one modal property can be defined in\nterms of another (Fine 2002, 254f.).\n\nRestriction. To say that property \\(N\\) can be defined\nfrom kind of necessity \\(N^*\\) by restriction is to say that\na proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can be defined as the combination\nof two things: (i) the proposition\u2019s having \\(N^*\\), and (ii)\nits meeting certain additional conditions.\nRelativization / quantifier restriction. To say that a\nproperty \\(N\\) can be defined from a kind of necessity \\(N^*\\) by\nrelativization to a class of propositions \\(S\\) is to say\nthat a proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can be defined as its being\n\\(N^*\\)-necessitated by \\(S\\). A closely related way in which a modal\nproperty can be defined in terms of another is by quantifier\nrestriction. Suppose that \\(P^*\\) is a kind of possibility that\nis the dual of \\(N^*\\) (in the sense that it is \\(P^*\\)-possible that\n\\(p\\) just in case it\u2019s not \\(N^*\\)-necessary that not-\\(p)\\),\nand that we have at our disposal the notion of a \\(P^*\\)-possible\nworld (a world that could \\(P^*\\)-possibly have been actualized). To\nsay that the property \\(N\\) can be defined from \\(N^*\\) by quantifier\nrestriction is to say that that a proposition\u2019s having \\(N\\) can\nbe defined as its being true in all \\(P^*\\)-possible worlds that meet\na certain condition \\(C\\). (This is only the simplest way of defining\na modal property from a kind of necessity by quantifier restriction.\nMuch more sophisticated methods have been proposed. See, e.g., Kratzer\n1977, 1991.) Given reasonable assumptions, every definition by\nrelativization corresponds to a definition by quantifier restriction,\nand vice\n versa.[9]\n\n\nRestriction allows us to define narrower modal properties from broader\nones. For example, it seems natural to define a proposition\u2019s\nbeing mathematically necessary as its being both metaphysically\nnecessary and a mathematical truth (Fine 2002, 255), or as its being\nmetaphysically necessary because it is a mathematical\ntruth. Maybe a proposition\u2019s being\nlogically necessary can similarly be defined as its being\nmetaphysically necessary because it is true in virtue of the natures\nof the logical constants (Fine 1994, 9\u201310; 2005, 237).\n(For a very different account that does not define logical necessity\nfrom metaphysical necessity by restriction, see Bacon 2018.)\n\nRelativization and quantifier restriction allow us to define broader\nmodal properties in terms of narrower ones. For example, it may be\nheld that biological necessity can be defined as the property of being\nmetaphysically (or perhaps nomically) necessitated by the basic\nprinciples of biology.\n\nA modal property \\(N\\) is called alethic just in case the\nclaim that a proposition has \\(N\\) entails that the proposition is\ntrue. Metaphysical, epistemic and nomic necessity are all alethic. By\ncontrast, moral and legal necessity are not. It is both morally and\nlegally necessary (i.e., it is required both by morality and by the\nlaw) that no murders are committed, even though murders are in fact\nbeing committed. A modal property defined by restriction from an\nalethic kind of necessity must itself be alethic. By contrast,\nrelativization allows us to define non-alethic modal properties from\nalethic ones, by relativizing to a class of propositions that contains\nsome falsehoods. Similarly, we can define a non-alethic modal property\nfrom an alethic one by restricting the quantifier over possible worlds\nto some class that does not include the actual world. For example,\nlegal necessity can perhaps be defined from metaphysical necessity by\nrestricting the quantifier to worlds where everybody conforms to the\nactual laws.\n\nThe properties listed in (6) can very naturally be called \u2018kinds\nof necessity,\u2019 and in some contexts they are the properties\nexpressed by necessity operators like \u2018must\u2019 and\n\u2018could not have been otherwise.\u2019 But that is not true of\nevery property that can be defined from some kind of necessity by\nrelativization or restriction. For example, we can define a property\nby relativizing metaphysical necessity to the class of truths stated\nin a certain book, but it would not be natural at all to call this\nproperty a kind of necessity. It is not plausible that there is a\nspecial form of necessity that attaches to all and only the\npropositions necessitated by the truths in the book. Similarly, the\nproperty defined by restricting metaphysical necessity to the truths\nabout cheddar cheese cannot naturally be called a kind of necessity.\nThere is no form of necessity that applies to just those necessary\npropositions that deal with cheddar and to none of the others. It is a\ngood question what distinguishes those properties defined by\nrelativization and restriction that we are willing to count as forms\nof necessity from the rest. Perhaps the most natural answer is that\nthe distinction is dictated by our interests and concerns, and does\nnot reflect a deep metaphysical difference.\n\nA more pressing question is whether some of the forms of necessity\ndiscussed in sections\n 1\n and\n 2\n can be defined in terms of the others by relativization or\nrestriction. Consider epistemic and metaphysical necessity first, and\nsuppose for the sake of the argument that dualism is true and the two\nproperties are indeed different forms of necessity. Can one of them be\ndefined in terms of the other by one of the aforementioned methods?\nNot if there are both necessary a posteriori and contingent\na priori propositions, since relativization and restriction\nonly allow us to define one property in terms of another if the\nextension of one is a subclass of that of the other. However, the\nexistence of contingent a priori truths is more controversial\nthan that of necessary a posteriori propositions, and someone\ntrying to define epistemic necessity in terms of metaphysical\nnecessity or vice versa may repudiate the contingent a priori\nand hold that the extension of epistemic necessity is included in that\nof metaphysical necessity. Then such a philosopher could try (a) to\ndefine metaphysical necessity from epistemic necessity by\nrelativization to some suitable class, or (b) to define epistemic\nnecessity from metaphysical necessity by restriction.\n\nSuch a definition may get the extension of the definiendum right. But\na definition may be intended to do much more than that: it may be\nmeant to tell us what it \\(is\\) for something to fall under the\nconcept to be defined. Suppose that someone tried to define the\nproperty of being an equiangular triangle as that of being a triangle\nwhose sides are of equal length. While this is extensionally correct,\nit does not give us the right account of what it is for something to\nbe an equiangular triangle (what it is for something to have that\nproperty has something to do with the sizes of its angles, not with\nthe lengths of its sides). It could be argued that definitions of type\n(a) and (b) face similar difficulties. For example, a definition of\nkind (a) entails that a proposition\u2019s being metaphysically\nnecessary consists in its being epistemically necessitated by a\ncertain class of propositions. But that would make metaphysical\nnecessity an epistemic property, and dualists typically want to resist\nthat idea. Similarly for definitions of type (b). Whether something is\nepistemically necessary (in the sense of being a priori)\nseems to be a purely epistemic matter. A priori propositions\nmay also be metaphysically necessary, but their metaphysical necessity\nisn\u2019t part of what makes them a priori, and\ntherefore shouldn\u2019t be mentioned in a definition of a\nprioricity.\n\nIf this argument is correct, then it is impossible to define epistemic\nmodal properties in terms of non-epistemic ones, or vice versa. But\nwhat about metaphysical and nomic necessity? Suppose for the sake of\nthe argument that there is such a thing as nomic necessity (a form of\nnecessity associated with the laws of nature) but that contingentism\nabout the natural laws is true, so that nomic necessity is indeed\ndistinct from metaphysical necessity. Can we define one of these\nproperties in terms of the other? The most natural way of doing this\nwould be to say that\n\n(7)\n Nomic necessity can be defined as the property of being\nmetaphysically necessitated by the laws of nature.\n\n\nSuch a definition may be extensionally accurate, and many philosophers\nwould not hesitate to endorse it. But others have doubted that it\ncaptures what it \\(is\\) for a proposition to be nomically necessary\n(Fine 2002). Nomic necessity is a special modal status enjoyed by all\nand only the propositions that are metaphysically necessitated by the\nnatural laws. Now, if \\(P\\) is metaphysically necessitated by the laws\nwithout itself being a law, then it may seem plausible to say, in some\nsense, that \\(P\\) has that special modal status because \\(P\\)\nis metaphysically necessitated by the laws. But the reason why being\nmetaphysically necessitated by the laws confers that special modal\nstatus on \\(P\\) is presumably that the laws themselves have that modal\nstatus and that this modal status gets transmitted across metaphysical\nnecessitation. But if we now ask what makes it so that the laws\nthemselves have that special modal status, (7) does not seem to give\nus the correct answer: the special necessity of the laws doesn\u2019t\nconsist in the fact that they are metaphysically necessitated by the\nlaws. Hence, (7) cannot be a correct general account of what\nconstitutes that special modal status.\n\nIt is open to debate which kinds of necessity are fundamental, in the\nsense that all others can be defined in terms of them, while they are\nnot themselves definable in terms of others. The monist view\nconsidered in\n section 1.3,\n when combined with (7), may inspire the hope that we can make do with\na single fundamental kind of necessity. Others have argued that there\nare several kinds of necessity that are not mutually reducible. For\nexample, Fine (2002) suggests (in a discussion that sets aside\nepistemic modality) that there are three fundamental kinds of\nnecessity, which he calls \u2018metaphysical,\u2019\n\u2018nomic\u2019 and \u2018normative\u2019 necessity. (For\nfurther discussion of normative necessity, see Rosen 2020.)\n\nThe reduction of the various kinds of necessity to a small number of\nfundamental ones would be an important step towards the goal of a\nunified account of\n modality.[10]\n But those who believe that there are several different fundamental\nkinds of necessity need to address another question: What is the\ncommon feature of these fundamental kinds of necessity that makes them\nall kinds of necessity? Why do they count as kinds of necessity, while\nother properties don\u2019t?\n\nOne strategy for answering this question, which centers on\nnon-epistemic forms of necessity, starts from a certain conception of\nwhat (non-epistemic) necessity consists in: for a proposition to be\nnecessary is for its truth to be, in a certain sense, particularly\nsecure, unshakable, and unconditional in a wholly objective way.\nA necessary truth could not easily have been false (it could less\neasily have been false than a contingent truth). We may call this\nfeature of a proposition \u2018modal force.\u2019 It is natural to\napply this conception to metaphysical and nomic necessity. Each of\nthese properties may be held to consist in having a certain grade of\nmodal force, though if contingentism is true, the degree of modal\nforce required for nomic necessity is lower than that required for\nmetaphysical necessity. We could then say that a property is one of\nthe fundamental forms of necessity just in case a proposition\n\\(P\\)\u2019s possessing that property consists entirely in\n\\(P\\)\u2019s having a specific grade of modal force. Other kinds of\nnecessity, like those listed in (6) can be defined from the\nfundamental ones by relativization or restriction. Having these\nproperties does not consist simply in having a specific grade\nof modal force (and these properties therefore aren\u2019t among the\nfundamental kinds of necessity). For example, if a property is defined\nby relativizing metaphysical necessity to a class of propositions\n\\(S\\), then the fact that a proposition \\(P\\) has that property\nconsists in the fact that the connection between \\(S\\) and\n\\(P\\) has a certain grade of modal force. But that is not the same\nthing as P itself having a certain grade of modal force.\nSimilarly, if a property is defined from, say, metaphysical necessity\nby restriction, then having that property does not consist\nmerely in possessing such-and-such a grade of modal force,\nbut in the conjunction of that feature with some other property.\n\nThis approach evidently leaves the question of how to understand the\nidea of modal force (of a proposition\u2019s truth being very\nunshakable). Some authors have attempted to explain this notion in\ncounterfactual terms (see Lewis 1973a, \u00a72.5; Lewis 1973b,\n\u00a72.1; McFetridge 1990, 150ff.; Lange 1999, 2004, 2005; Williamson\n2005, 2008; Hill 2006; Kment 2006a; cp. Jackson 1998, Chalmers 2002a):\nthe necessary truths are distinguished from the contingent ones by the\nfact that they are not only true as things actually are, but that they\nwould still have been true if things had been different in various\nways. To capture this idea more precisely, Lange (2005) introduces the\nconcept of \u2018stability\u2019: a deductively closed set \\(S\\) of\ntruths is stable just in case, for any claim \\(P\\) in \\(S\\) and any\nclaim \\(Q\\) consistent with \\(S\\), it is true in any context to say\nthat it would still have been the case that \\(P\\) if it had been the\ncase that \\(Q\\). The different forms of necessity have in common that\ntheir extensions are stable sets.\n\nKment (2006a, 2014, chs. 1\u20132) argues that modal force, and hence\nnecessity and possibility, come in many degrees (cp. Williamson 2016).\nWe often talk about such degrees of possibility when we say things\nlike \u2018Team \\(A\\) could more easily have won than Team\n\\(B\\),\u2019 \u2018Team \\(A\\) could easily have won\u2019 or\n\u2018Team \\(A\\) almost won.\u2019 The first utterance states that\n\\(A\\)\u2019s winning had a greater degree of possibility than\n\\(B\\)\u2019s winning, while the second and third simply ascribe a\nhigh degree of possibility to \\(A\\)\u2019s winning. A\nproposition\u2019s degree of possibility is the higher the less of a\ndeparture from actuality is required for it to be true. Suppose, e.g.,\nthat Team \\(A\\) would have won if one of their players had stood just\nan inch further to the left at a crucial moment during the game. Then\nwe can truly say that the team could easily have won. More formally,\n\\(P\\)\u2019s degree of possibility is the higher the closer the\nclosest \\(P\\)-worlds are to actuality (also see Lewis 1973a,\n\u00a72.5; Lewis 1973b, \u00a72.1; Kratzer 1991). Similarly, a\ntruth\u2019s degree of necessity is measured by the distance from\nactuality to the closest worlds where it is false. What metaphysical\nnecessity, nomic necessity and the other grades of necessity have in\ncommon is that each of them is the property of having a degree of\npossibility that is above a certain threshold. What distinguishes them\nis a difference in their associated thresholds.\n",
