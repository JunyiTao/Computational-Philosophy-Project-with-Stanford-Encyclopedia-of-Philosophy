    "main_text": "\n\n\nWe often find ourselves in disagreement with others. You may think\nnuclear energy is so volatile that no nuclear energy plants should be\nbuilt anytime soon. But you are aware that there are many people who\ndisagree with you on that very question. You disagree with your sister\nregarding the location of the piano in your childhood home, with you\nthinking it was in the primary living area and her thinking it was in\nthe small den. You and many others believe Jesus Christ rose from the\ndead; millions of others disagree.\n\n\nIt seems that awareness of disagreement can, at least in many cases,\nsupply one with a powerful reason to think that one\u2019s belief is\nfalse. When you learned that your sister thought the piano had been in\nthe den instead of the living room, you acquired a good reason to\nthink it really wasn\u2019t in the living room, as you know full well\nthat your sister is a generally intelligent individual, has the\nappropriate background experience (she lived in the house too), and is\nabout as honest, forthright, and good at remembering events from\nchildhood as you are. If, in the face of all this, you stick with your\nbelief that the piano was in the living room, will your retaining that\nbelief be reasonable?\n\n\nIn the piano case there is probably nothing important riding on the\nquestion of what to do in the face of disagreement. But in many cases\nour disagreements are of great weight, both in the public arena and in\nour personal lives. You may disagree with your spouse or partner about\nwhether to live together, whether to get married, where you should\nlive, or how to raise your children. People with political power\ndisagree about how to spend enormous amounts of money, or about what\nlaws to pass, or about wars to fight. If only we were better able to\nresolve our disagreements, we would probably save millions of lives\nand prevent millions of others from living in poverty.\n\n\nThis article examines the central epistemological issues tied to the\nrecognition of disagreement.\n\n\nCompared to many other topics treated in this encyclopedia, the\nepistemology of disagreement is a mere infant. While the discussion of\ndisagreement isn\u2019t altogether absent from the history of\nphilosophy, philosophers didn\u2019t start, as a group, thinking\nabout the topic in a rigorous and detailed way until the 21st\ncentury. For that reason, it is difficult to know what the primary\nissues and questions are concerning the general topic. At this early\nstage of investigation we are just getting our feet wet. In this\nessay, we begin by trying to motivate what we think should be the\nprimary issues and questions before we move on to look at some of the\nmain ideas in the literature. In so doing we also introduce some new\nterminology and make some novel distinctions that we think are helpful\nin navigating this relatively recent debate.\n",
