Of all the arts, this would have been the one\nthat would appear to have truly been able to present\n\u2018situations.\u2019\n\n\nIn the case of Sartre, this is all the more surprising given the\nintimate association of Sartre with cinema at many points in his life.\nSeveral passages in de Beauvoir\u2019s and Sartre\u2019s\nautobiographical writings attest to their shared enthusiasm for the new\nart (Sartre 1964). The profound influence of film on the young Sartre\nis well documented in his early writings, where he demonstrates great\nsensitivity towards the formal and political potentialities of the new\nmedium, in contrast to most of the French intelligentsia of the time\n(Sartre 1924, 1931). Indeed, these early texts credit cinema with\nprecisely the same capacities of expression that are later granted to\ntheatre, such as the capacity to present action, the necessary yet\nambiguous necessity of engagement and the capacity of artistic\nexpression to represent the masses to the masses. Literary criticism\nhas established to what extent Sartre attempted to reproduce in\nliterary form the techniques employed by cinema in the representation\nof time, space and internal states of consciousness, and specifically\nhow such an influence was crucial in his first major work,\nNausea (Johnson 1984).\n\n\nDuring the war, Sartre was employed as a script writer by a\nproduction company for whom he wrote eight scripts. Two of these were\npublished after the war (Sartre 1947c, 1948b), and two of them were\nfilmed. Most of these scripts provided the material for Sartre\u2019s\nplays and novels when their realisation failed. In 1958, he also wrote\ntwo scripts for films on Freud and Joseph Le Bon. Sartre also wrote\ntwelve articles on film in total, notably a critique of Citizen\nKane in 1945, which inspired a response by Andr\u00e9 Bazin that\nwas to become one of his most famous essays (Bazin 1947). De Beauvoir\nalso recounts the deep impact that the cinematic experience had on\nSartre\u2019s ontological views. According to her, the cinematic\nrepresentation of human actions hostage to the world\u2019s power of\nresistance was a crucial source of inspiration for his mature ontology,\nnotably for his vision of the absurdity inherent in the world\u2019s\ncontingency (de Beauvoir 1960).\n\n\nDespite this intimate connection with cinema, the enthusiasm that is\napparent in the early texts receded in the background after his\ndiscovery of phenomenology in 1933, following his study year in Germany\n(de Beauvoir 1962, 231). After that date, cinema no longer features as\nan important art form in his aesthetic writings. Indeed, in a 1958\nconference, Sartre explicitly ranks theatre above cinema because it\n\u201chas more freedom,\u201d as \u201ca film depicts men who are in\nthe world and are conditioned by it,\u201d whereas \u201ctheatre\npresents action by a man on the stage to men in the audience, and,\nthrough this action, both the world he lives in and the performer of\nthe action\u201d (Sartre 1976, 60\u201361). In other words, theatre is the\ntrue art of freedom in situations. Similarly, in later years, de\nBeauvoir explicitly ranked the novel over cinema for its capacity to\n\u201cmaterialise the presence of human beings to human beings\u201d\n(de Beauvoir quoted in Francis and Gontier 1979, 200). As with the\nNouveau Roman, Sartre and de Beauvoir were quite reserved\ntowards the Nouvelle Vague, the new French cinema of the 1960s\n(ibid.).\n\n\nRather than Sartre, it is Merleau-Ponty who gave the most lucid\nexposition of the evident link between cinema and existentialist\nphilosophy in a conference at the National School of Cinema in\nParis (1947b). Despite this insightful text, however, compared with the\neminent philosophical status that is bestowed upon theatre, the novel, and painting for the late Merleau-Ponty, as the truly\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d art forms, cinema is remarkably absent from\nthe most important existentialist writings in aesthetics.\n",
