    "main_text": "\n\nJohann Christoph Sturm (1635\u20131703) was an eclectic German\nphilosopher, professor at the University of Altdorf, one of the first\nexperimental physicists, a mathematician, astronomer,\ncalendariographer, and Lutheran priest. He was a correspondent of\nRobert Boyle (1627\u20131691) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716), among others. Sturm\u2019s thought mirrors the\ncomplex interplay between debates in metaphysics, natural philosophy,\nand theology that characterize the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\nIn his numerous academic works, Sturm forcefully defends the use of\nthe experimental method in natural philosophy. He advocates an\ninclusive and open-minded examination of old and new philosophical\ntheories in order to find the best explanations for observed\nphenomena. In metaphysics, Sturm is one of the most outspoken\nsupporters of occasionalism, the theory according to which finite\nbeings lack genuine causal powers and work only as occasions for\nGod\u2019s causal intervention in nature. While occasionalism was\ndeveloped before Sturm by a number of other authors, Sturm gives his\nown original twist to it by making it the foundation of his system of\nnatural philosophy.\n",
