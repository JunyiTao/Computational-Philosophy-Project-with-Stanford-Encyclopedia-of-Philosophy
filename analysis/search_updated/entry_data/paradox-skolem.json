    "main_text": "\n1. Background\n\n\nTo understand Skolem's Paradox, we need to start by recalling two\ntheorems from classical\n logic.[1]\n The first comes from the late 19th century. In\n1873, Georg Cantor formulated a new technique for measuring the\nsize\u2014or cardinality\u2014of a set of objects. Cantor's\nidea was that two sets should have the same cardinality just in case\ntheir members can be put into one-to-one correspondence with each\nother. So, for instance, the set {1, 2, \u2026 , 26} can be put into\none-to-one correspondence with the set {A, B,\n\u2026 , Z } via the natural map which relates 1 to\nA, 2 to B, 3 to C, etc., etc.; similarly,\nthe set of natural numbers can be put into one-to-one correspondence\nwith the set of even numbers via the map: x\n\n 2x.\n\n\nWhen Cantor applied this conception of cardinality to infinite sets,\nhe came to the initially surprising conclusion that there are different\nkinds of infinity. There are relatively small infinite sets like the\nset of even numbers, the set of integers, or the set of rational\nnumbers. These sets can all be put into one-to-one correspondence with\nthe natural numbers; they are called countably infinite. In\ncontrast, there are much \u201clarger\u201d infinite sets like the\nset of real numbers, the set of complex numbers, or the set of all\nsubsets of the natural numbers. These sets are too big to be put into\none-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers; they are called\nuncountably infinite. Cantor's Theorem, then, is just the\nclaim that there are uncountably infinite sets\u2014sets which are, as\nit were, too big to count as\n countable.[2]\n\n\nOur second theorem comes from the early 20th century. In 1915,\nLeopold L\u00f6wenheim proved that if a first-order sentence has a\nmodel, then it has a model whose domain is\n countable.[3]\n In 1922, Thoralf Skolem\ngeneralized this result to whole sets of sentences. He proved that if a\ncountable collection of first-order sentences has an infinite model,\nthen it has a model whose domain is only countable. This is the result\nwhich typically goes under the name the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem. Before moving on, it is useful to mention three, somewhat\nmore refined, versions of this\n theorem.[4]\n\n\nLet T be a countable collection of first-order sentences\nand let A be an infinite set. The Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem says that if T has\nany infinite model, then T has a model whose domain\nhas the same size as A (indeed, we can assume without loss of\ngenerality that the domain of this second model just is\nA).[5]\nThe Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem says that if\nN is a model of (infinite) cardinality \u03ba and if \u03bb is\nan infinite cardinal smaller than than \u03ba, then N has a\nsubmodel of cardinality \u03bb which satisfies exactly the same\nsentences as N itself\n does.[6]\n Finally, the Transitive\nSubmodel Theorem strengthens the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem by saying that if our initial N happens to be\na so-called transitive model for the language of set theory,\nthen the submodel generated by the downward theorem can also be chosen\nto be\n transitive.[7]\n\n\nReturn, now, to the original version of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem\u2014the one which simply claimed that any theory which has\nan infinite model also has a model which is countably\ninfinite. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the\nstandard axioms of set theory can themselves be formulated as\n(countable) collection of first-order sentences. If these axioms have a\nmodel at all, therefore, then the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem ensures\nthat they have a model with a countable\n domain.[8]\n But this seems quite\npuzzling. How can the very axioms which prove Cantor's theorem on the\nexistence of uncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself\nonly countable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order\nsentence which \u201csays that\u201d there are uncountably many\nthings?\n\n\nThese questions can be made somewhat more concrete by considering a\nspecific case. Let T be a standard, first-order axiomatization\nof set theory. (For convenience, this entry will focus on the case\nwhere T is ZFC, but any standard axiomatization of set theory\nwould do equally well.) On the assumption that T has a model,\nthe L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems ensure that it has a countable\nmodel. Call this model M. Now, as T\n \u22a2\u00a0\u2203x\u00a0\u201cx is\nuncountable,\u201d there must be some\n m\u02c6 \u2208\nM such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm\u02c6\nis\nuncountable.\u201d But, as M itself is only\ncountable, there are only countably many m \u2208\nM such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0m \u2208\n m\u02c6 On the surface,\nthen, we seem to have a straightforward contradiction: from one\nperspective,\n m\u02c6 looks uncountable, while from another\nperspective,\n m\u02c6 is clearly countable.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us a fairly simple formulation of Skolem's\nParadox. Before turning to look at this paradox's solution, a point\nabout motivation is probably in order. From one perspective, there's\nnothing especially surprising about the fact that a particular\nmodel fails to accurately capture every feature of the reality of which\nit is a model. A mathematical model of a physical theory, for instance,\nmay contain only real numbers and sets of real numbers, even though the\ntheory itself concerns, say, subatomic particles and regions of\nspace-time. Similarly, a tabletop model of the solar system will get\nsome things right about the solar system while getting other things\nquite wrong. So, for instance, it may get the relative sizes of the\nplanets right while getting their absolute sizes (or even their\nproportional sizes) wrong; or it may be right about the fact that the\nplanets move around the sun, while being wrong about the mechanism of\nthis motion (e.g., the planets don't really move around the sun because\nsome demonstrator turns a crank!). Given all this, it may be unclear\nwhy we should even expect first-order models of set theory to\naccurately capture the distinction between countable and uncountable\nsets. Hence, it may be unclear why we should even think that Skolem's\nParadox looks paradoxical in the first place.\n\n\nAlthough we'll say more about this kind of issue later (see\nespecially sections\n 2.1\n and\n 3.1),\na few preliminary remarks are appropriate here. First, it's important\nto note that there are some set-theoretic concepts which\nfirst-order models do capture quite precisely. As we'll see in\nsection 3.1, first-order models capture finite cardinality\nnotions\u2014e.g., \u201cx is empty,\u201d\n\u201cx has two members,\u201d \u201cx has\nseventeen members,\u201d etc.\u2014quite nicely.[9]\n If we\nallow ourselves to use infinitely many formulas, then we can also\ncapture the more-general notion \u201cx is\n infinite.\u201d[10]\n Finally, if we fix our understanding of\nmembership\u2014i.e., if we restrict our attention to models which use\nthe real membership relation to interpret the symbol\n\u201c\u2208\u201d\u2014then we can also capture the general notion\n\u201cx is\n finite.\u201d[11]\n\n\nGiven all this, Skolem's Paradox shows that the line between\ncountable and uncountable sets is, in a fairly deep sense, the\nfirst place where our model theory loses the ability to\ncapture cardinality notions. This fact helps to explain why Skolem's\nParadox may continue to look paradoxical even after we've absorbed the\ngeneral points about models and model theory which were presented in\nthe second-to-last paragraph. In short: it's the very fact that we\ncan capture so many of the cardinality notions which live, as\nit were, below the countable/uncountable distinction which\nmakes our sudden inability to capture the countable/uncountable\ndistinction itself so initially surprising.\n\n\nSecond, Skolem's Paradox does not depend on the specific\naxiomatization of set theory that we happen to be working with.\nAny first-order axiomatization of set theory can have the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems applied to it, so every such\naxiomatization is subject to Skolem's Paradox. This means, in\nparticular, that we can't resolve the paradox by simply choosing a new\naxiomatization of set theory (or adding some new axioms to the\naxiomatization that we're already using). The fact that Skolem's\nparadox is, in this way, intrinsic to the first-order\ncontext\u2014that it is an inescapable fact about first-order\naxiomatizations of set theory\u2014is another reason why Skolem's\nParadox may seem so initially puzzling.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us a first pass at formulating Skolem's Paradox.\nIn the next section, we explain why this simple version of the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a genuine contradiction, and we look at several\nmore-refined formulations of the paradox. In section\n 3,\n we turn to historical and philosophical issues. Section\n 3.1\n looks at Skolem's own understanding of his paradox.\nSections\n 3.2\u20133.4 look at\nsome more-recent attempts to argue that, even though the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a genuine mathematical contradiction, it still tells\nus something philosophically important about the nature of our\nunderstanding of set theory.\n2. Mathematical Issues\n\n\nIn an introduction to the 1922 paper where Thoralf Skolem first\npresented Skolem's Paradox, Jean van Heijenoort writes that the paradox\n\u201cis not a paradox in the sense of an antinomy \u2026 it is a\nnovel and unexpected feature of formal\n systems.\u201d[12]\n This comment reflects the\ngeneral consensus on Skolem's Paradox within the mathematical\ncommunity. Whatever philosophical problems the paradox is supposed to\nengender, it just doesn't constitute a problem for\nmathematics.\n\n\nTo understand why the paradox doesn't constitute a problem for\nmathematics we need to ask two questions. In the simple formulation of\nthe paradox given above, we noted that there's a specific\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm\u02c6\nis\nuncountable.\u201d Literally, of course, this isn't quite right.\nWhat we really mean here is that there's a rather complicated formula\nin the language of formal set theory\u2014a formula which\nmathematicians sometimes find it convenient to abbreviate with the\nEnglish expression \u201cx is uncountable\u201d\u2014and\nthat M satisfies this particular formula at\nm\u02c6.\n For convenience, let's denote the relevant formula by\n\u201c\u03a9(x).\u201d Then we can rephrase the\nfact mentioned above by saying that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6].[13]\n Our two questions, then, are these:\n\nWhy is it so natural to abbreviate \u03a9(x) by\n\u201cx is uncountable\u201d? Why, in particular, would\nanyone even think that the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\nentails that m\u02c6 is uncountable?\nWhy doesn't the fact M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6] really entail that\nm\u02c6 is uncountable?\n\nIn effect, the first of these questions asks whether Skolem's Paradox\nis simply an artifact of our abbreviations, an artifact which\nwould disappear if Skolem's Paradox were formulated more carefully and\nperspicuously. Assuming that it wouldn't so disappear, the second\nquestion asks for a more-detailed explanation of how the paradox can\nreally be dissolved. \n2.1 The Appearance of Paradox\n\n\nThere are two ways to approach the first question. On the one hand,\nwe could start with the formula \u03a9(x), and give\nthis formula what we might call its \u201cordinary English\u201d\ninterpretation. This is the interpretation which lets\n\u201c\u2208\u201d refer to the real set-theoretic membership\nrelation, which lets \u201c\u2200\u201d and \u201c\u2203\u201d\nrange over the whole (real) set-theoretic universe, and which\ninterprets \u201c=\u201d and the propositional connectives in the\nusual\n manner.[14]\nThen for any set m, \u03a9(m) will come out\ntrue if and only if m is\n uncountable.[15]\n This shows that there is\nat least one interpretation of \u03a9(x) under which\nthis formula really does capture\u2014at least from an extensional\nperspective\u2014the ordinary mathematical notion of uncountability.\nSo, there's at least one interpretation under which\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n really does say that m\u02c6\nis uncountable.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we could start, not with the formula\n\u03a9(x), but with the ordinary English sentence\n\u201cx is uncountable.\u201d If asked what this sentence\nmeans, a set theorist will say something about the lack of a bijection\nbetween x and the natural\n numbers.[16]\n If asked about the phrase \u201cis a\nbijection,\u201d she will go on to talk about collections of ordered\npairs satisfying certain nice properties, and if asked about the term\n\u201cordered pair,\u201d she will say something about the ways one\ncan identify ordered pairs with particular sets. If she takes this\nprocess far enough\u2014and if she saves herself some time by using\nsymbols like \u00ac and \u2203y as abbreviations for\n\u201cnot\u201d and \u201cthere exists a set y such\nthat\u201d\u2014then she will eventually obtain a detailed\nexplication of \u201cx is uncountable\u201d which looks just\nlike the formula \u03a9(x). That is, if we simply\ncompare the syntax of her explication of \u201cx is\nuncountable\u201d with the syntax of \u03a9(x), then\nwe will find that these two expressions contain exactly the same\nsymbols in exactly the same\n order.[17]\n Once again, therefore, we find that there's a\nreal, if a somewhat superficial, similarity between\n\u03a9(x) and \u201cx is\nuncountable\u201d\u2014a similarity which remains even after we stop\nusing \u201cx is uncountable\u201d as a straightforward\nabbreviation for \u03a9(x), and a similarity which\nexplains why even a perspicuously formulated version of Skolem's\nParadox may continue to look somewhat puzzling.\n\n\nThese, then, are two ways of thinking about the relationship between\n\u03a9(x) and \u201cx is\nuncountable.\u201d Together they explain why it's so natural for\nmathematicians to use \u201cx is uncountable\u201d as an\nabbreviation for \u03a9(x) and (so) why someone might\nbe inclined to think that the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n should\nentail that m\u02c6 is\n uncountable. They also bring us back to\nour second question: why doesn't the fact that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n really entail that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n2.2 A Generic Solution\n\n\nTo answer this second question, it's useful to begin by comparing\nthe ordinary English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x)\u2014the one introduced three paragraphs\nago and the one which really does entail that x is\nuncountable\u2014with the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) that's given by M and\n \u22a8.\n Clearly, it's this latter,\nmodel-theoretic interpretation which is most relevant to understanding\nthe fact that M\n \u22a8\n \u03a9[m\u02c6].\n Further, it's only if this\nmodel-theoretic interpretation is pretty closely tied to the ordinary\nEnglish interpretation\u2014and so, derivatively, to the ordinary\nEnglish expression \u201cx is uncountable\u201d\u2014that\nwe will have any real grounds for believing that the fact that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n should entail that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n\n\nFortunately, even a rough description of the model-theoretic\ninterpretation is enough to show that no such \u201cclose ties\u201d\nexist. The model-theoretic interpretation is obtained by letting the\nsignificance of \u201c\u2208\u201d be fixed by the interpretation\nfunction of M, letting the quantifiers in\n\u03a9(x) range over the domain of\nM, and letting the significance of \u201c=\u201d and\nthe propositional connectives be fixed by the recursion clauses in the\nthe definition of first-order satisfaction. This description highlights\ntwo immediate differences between the model-theoretic interpretation\nand the ordinary English interpretation.\n\n\nFirst, the model-theoretic interpretation understands\n\u201c\u2208\u201d to refer to whatever binary relation on\nM happens to fall under the interpretation function of\nM; in contrast, the ordinary-English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) understands \u201c\u2208\u201d to refer\nto the real set-theoretic membership relation. But there is no reason\nto think that these two understandings agree with each other. We can\nfind cases were M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2,\ndespite the fact that neither m1 nor\nm2 are even sets (indeed, as far as the model\ntheory is concerned, m1 and m2\ncould both be cats, or rabbits, or hedgehogs, or\n \u2026).[18]\n Further, even when\nall of the elements in M are sets, this\nprovides no guarantee that the model-theoretic understanding of\n\u201c\u2208\u201d will agree with the ordinary English\nunderstanding. We can find a case where m1 and\nm2 are genuine sets, but where M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1\n\u2208 m2, despite the fact that\nm1 is not really a member of\nm2; similarly, we can find a case where\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2209 m2,\ndespite the fact that m1 really is a\nmember of m2 (and where, once again,\nm1 and m2 are genuine\n sets).[19]\n\n\nSecond, the model-theoretic interpretation understands\n\u201c\u2203x\u201d and \u201c\u2200x\u201d to\nrange only over the domain of M, while the ordinary\nEnglish interpretation understands these quantifiers to range over the\nwhole set-theoretic universe. Clearly, these two understandings are\nquite different. Further, the differences in question are pretty\nclosely related to the sorts of sets that are involved in Skolem's\nParadox. Suppose, for instance, that M\n \u22a8\n \u201cm\u02c6\nis the set of\nreal numbers.\u201d Then a simple cardinality argument shows that\nthere are 2\u21350 real numbers which do not\nlive in the domain of M (and so, in particular, which\ndo not live in {m\u00a0 |\n\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}). \nHence, there's a real\ndifference between the genuinely uncountable set \u211c and\nthe merely countable set {m\u00a0 | \u00a0M\n\u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\u2014between,\n that is, the real set of real\nnumbers and the set of things which M merely thinks\nare real numbers. On the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x), the quantifiers only range over the\nlatter, smaller set, while on the ordinary English interpretation, they\nrange over the entire, larger set. Similarly, suppose that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm is infinite.\u201d Then we can show\nthat there are exactly 2\u21350 bijections\nf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192 {m\u2032 \u2208\nM \u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m\u2032 \u2208\n m\u2009}.[20]\n However, at most countably many of these\nbijections live in the domain of M. Hence, only\ncountably many of them are \u201cseen\u201d by \u2203x and\n\u2200x under the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x), although all\n2\u21350 of them are \u201cseen\u201d under\nthe ordinary English interpretation.\n\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that Skolem's Paradox may\nsimply turn on a surreptitious slide between two different\ninterpretations of \u03a9(x). Given a countable model\nfor ZFC, it's the model-theoretic interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) which allows us to find an element\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6].\nBut it's only the ordinary-English interpretation which provides us\nwith any real grounds for thinking that\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\nentails that\n m\u02c6 \nis uncountable. Further, and as we have\njust seen, there are enough differences between the model-theoretic\ninterpretation and the ordinary English interpretation to make us\nsuspicious of any facile slide between the two (even if we didn't know\nthat this slide would eventually lead us all the way to Skolem's\nParadox). In particular, then, we should resist any attempt to move\ndirectly from the fact that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\n to the claim that\n m\u02c6 is uncountable.\n\n\nIn effect, this analysis treats Skolem's paradox as a\nstraightforward case of equivocation. There's one interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n under which this formula really does entail that\n m\u02c6\n is an uncountable set; there's\nanother\u2014quite different\u2014interpretation which ensures that\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6];\n Skolem's Paradox depends on\nconfusing these two interpretations. In principle, we should be no more\nsurprised to find that this confusion leads us astray then we are to\nfind that our direct deposits aren't buried in the local riverbank.\nIndeed the model-theoretic case may be a bit worse than the banking\ncase: you could get lucky and find buried treasure while digging in the\nriverbank, but it's a straightforward theorem that if\nM is countable, then\n{m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n is also countable.\n\nThis, then, gives us a fairly simple solution to Skolem's Paradox. It's\na solution which explains why most mathematicians don't find the\nparadox very troubling, and it's also a fairly popular solution in the\nphilosophical literature. It is, for instance, essentially the solution\nthat Skolem himself gave back in 1922 (Skolem 1922), and variants of\nthis solution have appeared in more recent discussions of the paradox\n(Resnik 1966; Myhill 1967; Hart 1970; McIntosh 1979; Benacerraf 1985;\nShapiro 1991; Giaquinto 2002). It also appears in a number of recent\nintroductory textbooks (Shoenfield 1967; Kleene 1967; Fraenkel\net\u00a0al. 1984; Ebbinghaus et\u00a0al. 1994; van Dalen 1997). \n\n2.3 Transitive Submodels\n\n\nBefore turning to examine some of the more-purely philosophical\nissues concerning Skolem's Paradox, a few further points about the\nparadox's mathematics are in order. First, in order to get a better\nfeel for how the differences between the model-theoretic and\nthe ordinary English interpretations of \u03a9(x)\nactually give rise to Skolem's Paradox, it's worth tracking these\ndifferences through a slightly more refined version of the paradox. We\nsay that a set X is transitive if every\nmember of X is a set, and every member of a member of\nX is also a member of X (so,\ny \u2208 x \u2208 X\u00a0 \u21d2\ny \u2208 X). We say that a model for the\nlanguage of set theory is transitive if the model's domain is a\ntransitive set and the model's \u201cmembership\u201d relation is\njust the real membership relation restricted to the model's domain (so,\nfor any m1, m2 \u2208\nM, \u00a0 m1 \u2208 \nm2 \u21d4 M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2). Then, as\nnoted in section\n 1,\n the Transitive Submodel\nTheorem says that if we start with any transitive model\nof ZFC, then we can find a transitive model whose domain is countable\n(indeed, we may assume that this countable model is a submodel of the\nmodel with which we started).\n\n\nSuppose, then, that M is a countable transitive\nmodel of ZFC. This has two effects on the analysis of Skolem's Paradox\ngiven in the last section. First, it ensures that the model-theoretic\nand the ordinary English interpretations of \u03a9(x)\nagree on the interpretation of \u201c\u2208\u201d: for\nm1, m2 \u2208\nM, \u00a0 M\n \u22a8\u00a0m1 \u2208 m2\nif and only if m1 really is a member of\n m2.[21]\n In this case, therefore, the explanation of\nSkolem's Paradox has to involve the interpretation of the quantifiers.\nSecond, the fact that M is transitive ensures that\nM gets more than just membership right. In particular,\nif f and m live in the domain of M,\nthen M\n \u22a8\n\u201cf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192 m is a\nbijection\u201d if and only if f really is a bijection\nbetween the natural numbers and\n m.[22]\n\n\nTogether, these facts help us to isolate what's really going on in\nthe transitive submodel version of Skolem's Paradox. Consider again the\nformula we've been calling \u03a9(x). This formula\nhas the form:\n\u03a9(x) \u2261\n\u00ac\u2203f\u2002\u201cf\u2009:\u2009\u03c9\n\u2192 x is a bijection\u201d\n\nUnder its ordinary English interpretation, this formula says that the\nset-theoretic universe doesn't contain any bijections between the\nnatural numbers and x. In particular,\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n says that there is no bijection between the\nnatural numbers and\n m\u02c6.\n In contrast, the model theoretic interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\u2014the\n one which is relevant to the fact\nthat M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03a9[m\u02c6]\u2014says\n only that the\ndomain of M doesn't contain any bijections\nbetween the natural numbers and\n m\u02c6.[23]\n Clearly, these two interpretations have the potential to come apart. \n\n\nAnd in the case of Skolem's Paradox, they actually do come apart.\nSince M is countable, the set\n m\u02c6\u2009=\u2009{m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8 m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n must also be countable. So, there really does\nexist a bijection (indeed, 2\u21350\nbijections), f\u2009:\u2009\u03c9 \u2192\n m\u02c6.\nOn the ordinary English interpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6),\nthe quantifiers \u201csee\u201d these bijections, and so\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n comes out false. What Skolem's Paradox shows\nis that M itself does not contain any such\nbijections. Hence, the quantifiers in the model-theoretic\ninterpretation of\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\n don't see any bijections\nbetween \u03c9 and\n m\u02c6,\n and so\n \u03a9(m\u02c6)\ncomes out true. In this case, then, differences in the ways the\nmodel-theoretic and ordinary English interpretations of\n\u03a9(x) handle the quantifiers provide a perfectly\nnatural explanation of what's going on in Skolem's Paradox.\n\n\nThis transitive submodel version of the paradox has been widely\ndiscussed in the literature (McIntosh 1979; Benacerraf 1985; Wright\n1985; Tennant and McCarty 1987). Indeed, several authors have suggested\nthat transitivity may be necessary to formulate a philosophically\nsignificant version of the paradox (Benacerraf 1985; Wright 1985). See\nTennant and McCarty 1987 for some objections to the latter view.\n2.4 ZFC, Power Sets, and Real Numbers\n\n\nThe analysis of sections 2.2\u20132.3 explains in general terms how\na countable model can satisfy a formula like\n\u03a9(x) at a particular element. But it may still\nleave an obvious question unanswered: how can a countable model of\nZFC satisfy such a formula? Granted that an arbitrary\nmodel can interpret a formula like \u03a9(x) in a\npeculiar manner\u2014how can a model satisfy all of the axioms of\nset theory while still maintaining this peculiar interpretation?\nShouldn't the fact that M satisfies ZFC ensure that\nM also gets basic set-theoretic notions like countable\nand uncountable correct?\n\n\nThe short answer to these questions is this: countable models\n\u201cmisinterpret\u201d the axioms of set theory just as badly as\nthey misinterpret the formula \u03a9(x). For the\nmoment, let's stick with the assumption that M is\ntransitive and consider the power set\n axiom:[24]\n\u2200x \u2203y\n\u2200z [z \u2286 x \u2194 z\n\u2208 y ]\n\nOn its ordinary English interpretation, this axiom says that every set\nhas a power set\u2014a set which contains all and only the subsets of\nthe set with which we\n began.[25]\n On its model-theoretic interpretation, however,\nthe axiom says something much weaker. For any X \u2208\nM, the axiom ensures that we can find a Y\n\u2208 M which contains exactly those subsets of\nX which also live in M (so, Y = {\nZ\u00a0|\u00a0Z \u2286 X \u2227 Z\n\u2208 M }). But if X is infinite,\nthen most of the subsets of X won't live in the\ndomain of M (since, after all, there are\n2\u21350 subsets of X, while the\ndomain of M is only countable). So, the Y\ngenerated by the model-theoretic interpretation of the power set axiom\nwill be much smaller than the real power set of X (Fraenkel\net\u00a0al. 1984; Tennant and McCarty 1987; Shapiro 1991; Hallett 1994;\nGiaquinto 2002; Bays 2007a). \n\n\nIn this case, then, differences in the ways the model-theoretic and\nthe ordinary English interpretations of the power set axiom handle the\ninitial \u2200z-quantifier\u2014and, in particular,\ndifferences concerning which subsets of X get\n\u201cseen\u201d by this quantifier\u2014explain how a countable\nmodel can satisfy an axiom which is \u201csupposed to\u201d generate\nan uncountable set. And this kind of phenomena is fairly general. In\nResnik 1966, Michael Resnik tracks this phenomena through the case of\nthe real numbers. As before, assume that M is a\ncountable transitive model of\n ZFC.[26]\n Then there will be a particular R\n\u2208 M such that, modulo some abbreviations,\nM\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cR is the set of real\nnumbers.\u201d\n\nResnik notes that, even though M satisfies this\nformula, R doesn't really contain all the real\nnumbers\u2014it only contains those real numbers which happen to live\nin the domain of\n M.[27]\n So, the mere fact that R is countable\ndoesn't, in any interesting sense, generate a paradoxical situation in\nwhich the set of all real numbers is also countable. \n\n\nTaken together, these examples highlight a crucial fact: the\n\u201cmisinterpretations\u201d which explained how a countable model\ncan satisfy a sentence like\n \u03a9(m\u02c6 )\n are actually\nfairly systematic. They also explain how these models can\nsatisfy sentences like \u201cR is the set of real\nnumbers\u201d or \u201cY is the power set of \u03c9\u201d;\nand they even explain how these models can satisfy the axioms of set\ntheory (e.g., the power set axiom). When enough of these\nmisinterpretations get put together, they jointly explain how it's\npossible for a countable model to both satisfy the axioms of set theory\nand, at the same time, maintain the peculiar interpretation of\n\u03a9(x) that we discussed in sections\n2.2\u20132.3. In the end, then, while the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem may still be interesting technical fact\u2014\u201ca novel\nand unexpected feature of formal systems,\u201d in van Heijenoort's\nwords\u2014Skolem's Paradox itself should no longer appear very\nparadoxical.\n2.5 Four Final Points\n\n\nWe close this discussion of the mathematical side of Skolem's\nParadox with four final points. First, the discussion in 2.3\u20132.4\nfocused on the transitive submodel case of Skolem's Paradox. This case\nis relatively straightforward to analyze, and (so) it's the case that's\nbeen most widely discussed in the literature. But it can also be\nsomewhat misleading. Much of the analysis of 2.3\u20132.4 turned on\nthe fact that transitive models get a lot of things \u201cright\u201d\nabout the set-theoretic universe (membership, bijections, real numbers,\netc.). Most importantly, if M is transitive and\nm \u2208 M, then m =\n{m\u2032 \u2208 M\n\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\nm\u2032 \u2208 m\u2009}.\n\n\nIf M is not transitive, however, then nearly all of\nthis falls apart. Bays has argued that there are versions of Skolem's\nParadox which turn solely on the way certain non-transitive\nmodels interpret a few specific instances of the membership relation in\n\u03a9(x) (Bays 2007a, sections 4\u20135). Similar\npoints would carry over to our discussion of power sets and real\nnumbers in section 2.4. We can, for instance, find a countable model of\nZFC which contains the whole set of real numbers as a member\u2014the\nmodel remains countable only because\n \u211c \u2260\n {m\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n \u2009\u211c} (Benacerraf 1985; Bays 2007a, section 1). In short, although\nthe generic explanation of Skolem's Paradox that was given in section\n2.2\u2014the one which simply notices that there are some\ndifferences between the model-theoretic and the ordinary English\ninterpretations of \u03a9(x) and then chalks Skolem's\nParadox up to some kind of equivocation between these two\ninterpretations\u2014continues to hold up when we move to\nnon-transitive models, the more-detailed analyses of 2.3\u20132.4 all\nbreak down. In the general non-transitive case, therefore, the analysis\nof section 2.2 may be the best we can do in giving an explanation of\nSkolem's Paradox (which is not to say that we can't give more-detailed\nexplanations in the context of any particular non-transitive\nmodel).\n\n\nThis brings us to a second point. Skolem's Paradox depends crucially\nupon the fact that we're using a first-order axiomatization of\nset theory. More precisely, it depends upon the fact that we're using\nfirst-order model theory to interpret this axiomatization. In 1930,\nZermelo proved that (second-order) models of second-order ZFC compute\ncardinalities and power sets\n correctly.[28]\n In particular, then, if M\nis a model for second-order ZFC and if\n m\u02c6\n \u2208 M, then M\n \u22a8\n \u201cm\u02c6\n is uncountable\u201d if and only \nif {m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\n m\u02c6\u2009}\n really is uncountable. Hence, Skolem's Paradox doesn't arise in the second-order\ncontext (Zermelo 1930; Shapiro 1991).\n\n\nThis second point shows that Skolem's Paradox goes away if our logic\nis strong enough. The third point shows that weakening our\nlogic has a similar effect. In Tennant and McCarty 1987, Tennant and\nMcCarty show that standard proofs of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\nfail in constructivist set theory, and they argue that the theorem\nitself is probably constructively\n invalid.[29]\n This means that there's no way to generate\nSkolem's Paradox from within the framework of constructivist\nmathematics. For constructivists, therefore, as for those who are\nwilling to countenance second-order axiomatizations of set theory,\nSkolem's paradox simply doesn't arise.\n\n\nTogether, these last two points highlight just how central classical\nfirst-order logic is to Skolem's Paradox. From a mathematical\nstandpoint, this shouldn't be all that surprising. Lindstrom has shown\nthat the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems play a key role in\ncharacterizing first-order logic itself (Lindstr\u00f6m 1966;\nLindstr\u00f6m 1969; Ebbinghaus 2007). Given this, it should be\nunsurprising that the puzzle that's most closely associated with these\ntheorems also turns out to be tied pretty closely to the peculiarities\nof the first-order situation. Although, as we've seen, the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a straightforward mathematical contradiction, it\ndoes help us to understand the nature and limits of classical\nfirst-order logic.\n\n\nThis brings us to a final point. The above discussion explains why\nthose of us who are willing take a naively realistic attitude towards\nthe language of set theory\u2014e.g., those of us who have no qualms\nabout expressions like \u201cthe ordinary English interpretation of\n\u03a9(x)\u201d\u2014should remain untroubled by\nSkolem's Paradox. It's important to emphasize that this analysis\nalso explains why Skolem's Paradox doesn't introduce\ncontradictions into various forms of axiomatized set theory, even when\nthese axiomatizations are themselves understood formalistically or\nmodel-theoretically. From a proof-theoretic standpoint, for example,\nthere is a difference between unrelativized quantification and\nquantification which has been explicitly relativized to some formula in\nour language (where this formula is one that, from an intuitive\nperspective, serves to \u201cpick out\u201d the domain of countable\nmodel of ZFC). So, there's no a priori reason to think that a\nsentence with unrelativized quantifiers will conflict with that\nsentence's fully-relativised\n counterpart.[30]\n Similarly, from a model-theoretic\nperspective, there is a difference between quantifiers which range over\nthe whole domain of a model and quantifiers which only range over the\n\u201celements\u201d of some particular member of the model (where,\nonce again, this member is one which the larger model\n\u201cthinks\u201d is a model of ZFC). So, although the naive realism\nof sections 2.1\u20132.4 is useful for expository purposes, it's not\nessential to the underlying analysis of Skolem's Paradox.\n3. Philosophical Issues\n\n\nThe last section explained why Skolem's Paradox does not constitute\na problem for mathematics. This, of course, has not kept philosophers\nfrom arguing that the paradox does constitute a problem for\nphilosophy. In this section, we explore several attempts to derive\nphilosophical conclusions from the mathematics surrounding Skolem's\nParadox. Before doing so, however, two cautionary notes are in order.\nFirst, many of the more provocative discussions of Skolem's Paradox are\nquite brief\u2014amounting to little more than suggestive comments\nmade in passing. Hence, much of the discussion of these comments will\nhave to be somewhat conjectural. Second, many critical discussions of\nSkolem's Paradox have focused simply on working carefully through the\nparadox's mathematics and then explaining why the paradox doesn't\nconstitute a genuine mathematical contradiction. Since this material\nwas already covered in section 2, we won't say any more about these\nissues in this section.\n3.1 Skolem's Views\n\n\nIn the 1922 paper where he originally presented Skolem's Paradox,\nSkolem used the paradox to argue for two philosophical conclusions:\nthat set theory can't serve as a \u201cfoundation for\nmathematics\u201d and that axiomatizing set theory leads to a\n\u201crelativity of set theoretic notions\u201d (Skolem 1922). These\nclaims, and Skolem's arguments for them, have attracted considerable\nattention in the literature. Unfortunately, Skolem's paper is quite\ncompressed, and so it's difficult to determine exactly what these\nclaims were really supposed to amount to. At present, there are three\ninterpretations of Skolem's paper which have some currency in the\nphilosophical literature.\n\n\nLet's begin with Skolem's claim that axiomatizing set theory leads\nto a relativity of set-theoretic notions. One way to understand this\nclaim is to view it against the backdrop of what we might call an\nalgebraic or model-theoretic conception of\naxiomatization. On this conception, the axioms of set theory serve to\ncharacterize\u2014or perhaps even to implicitly define\u2014basic\nset-theoretic notions like set, membership and set-theoretic universe.\nSo, a set-theoretic universe is simply a model for the axioms\nof set theory, a set is simply an element in some\nset-theoretic universe, and membership just refers to whatever\nbinary relation a particular universe uses to interpret the symbol\n\u201c\u2208.\u201d On this conception of axiomatization, then, the\naxioms of set theory should not be seen as attempts at\ndescribing\u2014or even partially describing\u2014some antecedently\ngiven \u201cintended model\u201d of set theory; instead, the intended\nmodels of set theory are simply those models which happen to\nsatisfy our initial collection of set-theoretic\n axioms.[31]\n\n\nWe should emphasize, here, that this algebraic conception of\naxiomatization would have been quite familiar to mathematicians working\nat the time Skolem wrote his 1922 paper. Skolem himself was trained\nin Schr\u00f6der's algebraic school of logic, so this would have been\nthe natural way for him to think about axioms. But even people who\nweren't trained in Schr\u00f6der's school would have found the\nconception familiar. It's the conception which lay behind Hilbert's\nfamous axiomatization of geometry (about which Hilbert reputedly\nclaimed, somewhat notoriously, that we can replace points, lines, and\nplanes with tables, chairs, and beer mugs as long as the latter objects\nstand in the right kinds of relations). It's also the conception which\nlay behind the 19th-century results that arithmetic and analysis can be\ngiven categorical (second-order) axiomatizations. Finally, and most\nimportantly, it's the conception of axiomatization which Skolem\nattributes to Zermelo in the very paper that we're currently\ndiscussing, and so it's the conception of Zermelo's axioms that Skolem\nis primarily concerned with\n criticizing.[32]\n\n\nGiven this algebraic conception of axiomatization, then, Skolem\nappeals to the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems to argue that the axioms\nof set theory lack the resources to pin down the notion of\nuncountability. Given any first-order axiomatization of set theory and\nany formula \u03a9(x) which is supposed to capture\nthe notion of uncountability, the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems show\nthat we can find a countable model M which satisfies\nour axioms. As in section 1, therefore, we can find an element\nm\u02c6 \u2208\n M such that M\n \u22a8 \u03a9(m\u02c6) but\n{m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208 m\u02c6\u2009} is only\ncountable. Thus, as long the basic set theoretic notions are\ncharacterized simply by looking at the model theory of first-order\naxiomatizations of set theory, then many of these notions\u2014and, in\nparticular, the notions of countability and uncountability\u2014will\nturn out to be unavoidably\n relative.[33]\n\n\nThis, then, provides the content of Skolem's claim that axiomatizing\nset theory leads to a relativity of set-theoretic notions. It is\nimportant, here, to distinguish this claim from a more trivial claim\nwhich Skolem might be thought to be making. From one perspective, the\nalgebraic conception of axiomatization leads to an obvious\nform of relativity: the elements which count as sets in one model may\nnot count as sets in another model, the membership relation of one\nmodel may be different than the membership relation of another model,\nand this latter difference in membership relations may hold even if the\ntwo models happen to share the same domain. On this trivial notion of\nrelativity, therefore, almost everything turns out to be relative, even\nsimple notions like \u201cx is the empty set\u201d or\n\u201cx is a singleton.\u201d After all, an object could be\na \u201csingleton\u201d in one model while being a\n\u201cdoubleton\u201d in another model, or it could be \u201cthe\nempty set\u201d in one model while being omitted entirely from another\nmodel's domain.\n\n\nIt's important to emphasize that Skolem's own notion of relativity\nis more sophisticated than this. Let's grant that the specific element\nwhich serves as \u201cthe empty set\u201d will not remain constant as\nwe move from one model of set theory to another\u2014with the empty\nset in the first model becoming, perhaps, a singleton in the second.\nNonetheless, we can still use a formula in the language of set theory\nto capture the notion \u201cx is the empty set\u201d in an\nessentially absolute way. In any model of our axioms, an\nelement m\u02c6 \u2208\n M will satisfy the\nopen formula \u201c\u2200y\u2002y \u2209 x\u201d\nif and only if the set {m\u00a0|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\n m \u2208\nm\u02c6\u2009} \nis really empty. Hence, there's at least\na sense in which we can still capture the notion\n\u201cx is the empty set\u201d from within the algebraic\nframework. And this point extends more widely\u2014a similar argument\nwould apply to notions like \u201cx is a singleton\u201d or\n\u201cx has seventeen members.\u201d Even on the algebraic\nconception of axiomatization, therefore, there are some set-theoretic\nnotions which we can still pin down pretty precisely. What the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems show is that, no matter how rich our\n(first-order) set-theoretic axioms may be, we cannot use this kind of\ntechnique to pin down the notion \u201cx is\nuncountable.\u201d This is the result which lies behind all of\nSkolem's talk about \u201crelativity,\u201d and it's a result which\nhighlights a genuine weakness in the algebraic approach to\nset-theoretic\n axiomatization.[34]\n\n\nTo summarize, then, the upshot of this discussion is this:\nif we take a purely algebraic approach to the axioms of set\ntheory, then many basic set-theoretic notions\u2014including the\nnotions of countability and uncountability\u2014will turn out to be\nrelative. In Skolem's words: \u201caxiomatizing set theory leads to a\nrelativity of set-theoretic notions, and this relativity is inseparably\nbound up with every thoroughgoing axiomatization\u201d (Skolem 1922,\np. 296). Of course, this still leaves open the question of whether\nthese notions are, as it were, absolutely relative\u2014of\nwhether there is some other, non-algebraic and non-thoroughgoing, way\nof understanding our axioms which does not lead to the sort of\nrelativity we've just been discussing. It's when we turn to this latter\nquestion that the various interpretations of Skolem's paper begin to\ncome apart.\n\n\nThe most traditional interpretation of the paper sees Skolem as\nmounting a straightforward attack on set theory. Skolem starts his\npaper by noting that the classical set-theoretic paradoxes should lead\nus to be skeptical of informal understandings of set theory\u2014of\n\u201cnaive reasoning with sets,\u201d to use Skolem's own\nexpression. Given this, our only real option is to fall back on some\nform of axiomatized set theory, and the only respectable way to\nunderstand our axioms is algebraically (since understanding them\nintuitively would amount to falling back into our previously\ndiscredited naivet\u00e9). But Skolem's Paradox shows that\nset-theoretic notions are relative on the algebraic conception of\naxiomatization. So, these notions are really relative. In\nshort: the classical paradoxes show that the algebraic conception of\nset theory is the best conception we've got, and so Skolem's Paradox\nshows that set-theoretic notions are unavoidably relative. This\ntraditional reading of Skolem is quite prevalent in the folklore;\nvariants of it are discussed in Hart 1970, McIntosh 1979, Muller 2005,\nand Bellotti 2006.\n\n\nThe second interpretation focuses on Skolem's claim that set theory\ncannot provide an adequate foundation for mathematics. In particular,\nSkolem thinks that set theory lacks the resources to provide a\nfoundation for ordinary arithmetic\u2014on his view, arithmetic is\n\u201cclear, natural and not open to question,\u201d while set theory\nitself is far more problematic. To show that set theory is\nproblematic, Skolem runs through a number of different ways of\ninterpreting set theory\u2014naive set theory, axiomatized set theory\nconstrued proof-theoretically, axiomatized set theory construed\nalgebraically, etc.\u2014and he argues that each of these\nunderstandings of set theory is inadequate for foundational purposes.\nOn this reading, then, Skolem's Paradox plays only a modest role in\nSkolem's overall argument. It serves to highlight some problems with\none particular conception of set theory (the algebraic conception), but\nit plays no role in Skolem's arguments against other conceptions of set\ntheory. Further, these other arguments do not show\u2014or even\npurport to show\u2014that the various non-algebraic conceptions of set\ntheory lead to any kind of relativity (although they do, of course,\nhave other problems which render them unsuitable for foundationalist\n purposes).[35]\nVersions of this foundationalist reading of Skolem's paper can be found\nin George 1985 and Benacerraf 1985; see Jan\u00e9 2001 for some\ncriticisms of this line of interpretation.\n\n\nThe final interpretation of Skolem's argument comes in a\npaper by Ignacio Jan\u00e9 (Jan\u00e9 2001). Jan\u00e9's reading\nagrees with the traditional interpretation in taking Skolem to be\nmounting a fairly general attack on set theory\u2014and, in\nparticular, on the notion of an absolutely uncountable set. But it\nagrees with the foundationalist interpretation in that it takes this\nattack to be mounted piecemeal, with Skolem's Paradox itself playing\nonly a modest role in one prong of the attack. Very roughly,\nJan\u00e9 thinks that Skolem is trying to show that there is no\nrigorous way to initially introduce the notion of an uncountable set\ninto mathematics. The set-theoretic paradoxes show that we should not\nnaively take Cantor's Theorem at face value\u2014so, Cantor's proof\nitself doesn't force us to accept uncountable sets. Skolem's Paradox\nshows that adopting an algebraic understanding of the set-theoretic\naxioms also doesn't force us to accept uncountable sets, since we can\nalways interpret these axioms as applying to a model that's only\ncountable.\n\n\nOf course, as Jan\u00e9 notices, there are a number of strategies\nthat we could use to evade this application of Skolem's Paradox: we\ncould use uncountably many axioms to force our models to have\nuncountable domains, we could appeal to the Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem to show that Zermelo's axioms\nalso have uncountable models (see section\n 1),\nor we could move to a second-order version of Zermelo's axioms and then\nprove that these axioms can only be satisfied by models with\nuncountable domains (see section\n 2.5).\nUnfortunately, each of these strategies presupposes that we already\nhave a prior grip on the notion of an uncountable set\u2014e.g., to\ninitially characterize an uncountable set of axioms, to formulate the\nUpward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, or to prove that second-order ZFC\nhas only uncountable models. So, none of these strategies can be used\nto introduce uncountable sets into mathematics in the first\nplace. Or so, at any rate, Jan\u00e9 takes Skolem to be arguing.\n\n\nThese, then, are the three main interpretations of Skolem's paper in\nthe literature. Without taking a stand on which of these\ninterpretations best captures Skolem's own intentions, we note that\nmost of Skolem's contemporaries interpreted him as giving\nsomething like the \u201ctraditional\u201d argument described above\nand that their responses to Skolem's Paradox reflected this\ninterpretation. Zermelo himself came to accept the algebraic conception\nof his axioms, but he then insisted that these axioms should be\ninterpreted in second-order terms and that, so interpreted, they do not\nfall prey to Skolem's Paradox (Zermelo 1930; Taylor 1993; Ebbinghaus\n2003). Similarly, Tarski suggested that Skolem's Paradox could be\ndefused by treating \u201c\u2208\u201d as a logical constant in some\nversion of type theory (see the remarks published at the end of Skolem\n1958). But, while both of these suggestions would allow mathematicians\nto avoid Skolem's Paradox, they both depend on accepting pieces of\npowerful mathematical machinery which Skolem\u2014on any\nreading of his paper\u2014would almost certainly have wanted to\nreject. Given Skolem's philosophical purposes, therefore,\nthese contemporary responses to his paradox would not have seemed very\nthreatening (see Skolem 1955 and Skolem 1958 for some of Skolem's own\nreflections on these kinds of responses).\n3.2 Skolemite Skepticism\n\n\nOver the years, there has been a small but steady stream of\nphilosophers and logicians who have found what we've called the\ntraditional interpretation of Skolem's paper philosophically\ncompelling\u2014i.e., compelling as an independent philosophical\nargument and not just as an interpretation of Skolem's paper. Their\nview, which Michael Resnik has dubbed the \u201cSkolemite\u201d view,\nholds that the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems really do show that\nset-theoretic notions are relative. Indeed, Skolemites are often\nwilling to go a bit further than this and claim that, although a given\nset may be uncountable \u201crelative to the means of expression of an\naxiom system,\u201d every set is countable when considered\nfrom an \u201cabsolute\u201d perspective (Kneale and Kneale 1962;\nGoodstein 1963; Wang 1964; Fine 1968; Thomas 1968, 1971).\n\n\nIn this section, we isolate the key idea behind some classical developments of these\nSkolemite claims, and we then consider some of the responses to them which have\nappeared in the recent literature. (In section 3.3, \nwe consider an interesting new approach to the Skolemite position.) \nWe start with the Skolemite argument\nitself. Very roughly, this argument comes in three steps. First, it\nargues that the algebraic conception of set theory is the only\nrespectable conception for contemporary mathematicians and philosophers\nto adopt. Second, it follows Skolem in arguing that the algebraic\nconception of set theory leads to a relativity of set-theoretic\nnotions. Finally, it extends Skolem's argument to defend the strong\nform of relativity mentioned at the end of the last\nparagraph\u2014i.e., the one under which every set turns out to be\ncountable when it's considered from an \u201cabsolute\u201d\nperspective.\n\n\nFor our purposes, the second step in this argument has already been\nconsidered in enough detail in the context of our discussion of Skolem;\nso we'll simply recap the main points here. On the algebraic conception\nof set theory, basic set-theoretic notions are characterized by looking\nat the model theory of first-order axiomatizations of set theory.\nNotions which remain fixed as we move from model to model\u2014in the\nsense of \u201cfixed\u201d that we discussed in the last\nsection\u2014have an \u201cabsolute\u201d significance; notions\nwhich vary as we move from model to model have only a\n\u201crelative\u201d significance. Given this, the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems show that the notions of countability\nand uncountability will in fact vary as we move from model to model. On\nthe algebraic conception of set theory, therefore, these notions are\nonly\n \u201crelative.\u201d[36]\n\n\nThis brings us to steps 1 and 3 in the Skolemite argument. Step 1 is\nwhere different versions of this argument display the most variability.\nIn some cases, step 1 is simply presupposed, so it's hard to get a feel\nfor how the underlying argument is really supposed to go\n(Kneale and Kneale 1962; Goodstein 1963; Wang 1964). In other cases,\nit's suggested that any rejection of the algebraic\nconception\u2014and, in particular, any move to simply take\nexpressions like \u201call sets\u201d or \u201cis really\nuncountable\u201d at face value\u2014amounts to falling back on an\nunacceptably naive form of \u201cPlatonism\u201d (Fine 1968; Thomas\n1968, 1971; Klenk 1976). In still other cases, Skolemites follow\nSkolem's lead and appeal to the set-theoretic paradoxes to bolster\ntheir rejection of Platonism; they then suggest that the abandonment of\nPlatonism leaves the algebraic conception of axiomatization as the only\nviable alternative (Klenk 1976).\n\n\nThere's another strategy that's available here: some authors have\ndefended the Skolemite position by using other puzzles about\nthe interpretation of mathematical language\u2014i.e., puzzles other\nthan Skolem's Paradox\u2014to motivate the initial move from Platonism\nto the algebraic conception. So, for instance, Klenk has argued that we\ncan parley one of Benacerraf's classical puzzles\u2014that presented\nin Benacerraf 1965\u2014into this kind of an argument (Klenk\n 1976).[37]\nSimilarly, Wright has appealed to Wittgensteinian considerations\nconcerning the relationship between meaning and use to motivate a\nlimited Skolemite position (Wright 1985). Finally, several authors have\nsuggested that the whole development of twentieth-century set theory\ntells in favor of the algebraic approach\u2014after all, the entire\nhistory of the subject has been a move away from naive\napproaches to set theory and towards formal axiomatization\n(and especially first-order axiomatization). See, Klenk 1976 for this\nlast kind of analysis.\n\n\nTurn, now, to the third step in the Skolemite argument. The\nmathematical theorem which underlies this third step is clear. Let\n\u03c6(x) be a formula which is supposed to define a\nunique set\u2014e.g., \u201cx\u2009 is the power set of\n\u03c9\u201d or \u201cx\u2009 is the set of real\n numbers.\u201d[38]\n Then we can find a model M\n \u22a8\u00a0ZFC and an element m\n\u2208 M such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u03c6(m) and\n{m\u2032 \u2208 M\n\u2009|\u00a0M\n \u22a8\nm\u2032 \u2208 m\u2009} is only countable. So, if\nwe're willing to concede that all it takes to be, say, the\npower set of \u03c9 is to satisfy the relevant defining formula in\nsome model of set theory, then we can make sense of the claim that at\nleast one instance of the power set of \u03c9 is \u201creally\u201d\ncountable. If we are willing make the further assumption that it only\ntakes one bijection to one such instance of the power\nset of \u03c9 to render the power set itself \u201cabsolutely\u201d\ncountable, then we can understand the Skolemite's strong claim about\nabsolute countability. Of course, neither of these two final moves\nfollows in the strict sense from the algebraic conception of\naxiomatization; but they are both moves which a proponent of the\nalgebraic conception might well find congenial.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us the basic structure of the various Skolemite\narguments. Before turning to some responses to these arguments which\nhave appeared in the recent literature, it is important to be clear\nabout the role that Skolem's Paradox itself can and cannot play in\nthese arguments. At times, it appears as though some Skolemites think\nthat the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems by themselves show\nthat there's a problem with our ordinary conception of sets: so, the\ntheorems show that set-theoretic notions are relative, relativity is\nincompatible with our ordinary conception of sets, and so our ordinary\nconception of sets has to be abandoned (Kneale and Kneale 1962;\nGoodstein 1963). It should be clear from section 2, however, that this\nline of argument has no chance of succeeding. The analysis in section 2\nshows that those of us who are willing to take a naively realistic\nattitude towards set theory\u2014or, for that matter, those who take\nmore sophisticated stances which rest on the iterative conception of\nsets and/or some form of second-order structuralism\u2014will have no\nproblems with Skolem's Paradox. Hence, the paradox itself\ncannot force us to abandon our ordinary conception of sets.\n\n\nInstead, the successful Skolemite needs to follow the basic approach\nset out at the beginning of this section. He begins with an independent\nargument for the algebraic conception of set theory\u2014i.e., an\nargument which would lead us to abandon the ordinary conception of sets\nin favor of the algebraic conception, and (crucially) an argument which\ndoes not itself turn on issues relating to Skolem's Paradox. Once this\npreliminary argument is complete, the Skolemite can then proceed to\nuse the algebraic conception of sets (plus, of course, the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems) to defend the claims about\nset-theoretic relativity that are made in steps 2 and 3 of his\nargument.\n\n\nTwo further comments about this approach are in order. First, we\nshould note that this approach provides the Skolemite with a response\nto the kinds of arguments that we made in section 2. In particular, it\nallows him to challenge our all-too-naive use of expressions like\n\u201cthe ordinary English understanding of\n\u2018\u2208,\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201cthe real members of\n m\u02c6,\u201d\n \u201cquantifiers which range over the\nwhole set-theoretic universe,\u201d etc. Given an independent\nargument against the ordinary conception of sets, the Skolemite is not\ngoing to be too impressed with a \u201csolution\u201d to Skolem's\nParadox which turns on the naive employment of these kinds of\nexpressions. See Thomas 1968, 1971; Klenk 1976.\n\n\nSecond, we should note that, although this approach requires the\nSkolemite to start with an independent argument against our ordinary\nconception of sets, it need not render the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems themselves completely superfluous. After all, it's still a\ntheorem that set-theoretic notions like countability and\nuncountability come out relative on the algebraic conception. This\nisn't something which happens to all set-theoretic notions\u2014e.g.,\n\u201cx is the empty set\u201d or\n\u201cx has seventeen members\u201d\u2014and it's\nnot something which just drops out from the algebraic conception of\naxiomatization.\n\n\nThat being said, this is a place where the Skolemite has to be\nrather careful. Unless the considerations raised in step 1 of his\nargument are pretty closely tied to the details of the algebraic\nconception\u2014and tied in a way which makes that conception\ngenuinely attractive as a positive understanding of set\ntheory\u2014the Skolemite's larger argument is threatened with a\ncertain kind of rhetorical triviality. After all, once the Skolemite\nhas the resources to push us to the algebraic conception of set\ntheory\u2014as in step 1 of his argument\u2014then he also has the\nresources to directly undermine our ordinary conception of\nsets, and to do so without bringing Skolem's Paradox itself into the\ndiscussion. If this is right, then the Skolemite's larger argument\ncould well amount to criticizing ordinary set-theoretic notions for\nbeing \u201crelative\u201d in a rhetorical context in which the\nSkolemite has already presented far stronger criticisms of\nthese notions in the course of defending the initial step in his\nargument. That would be more than a little bit\n awkward.[39]\n\n\nTo avoid this kind of awkwardness, we think that the Skolemite\nshould frame his argument, less as a criticism of our ordinary\nset-theoretic notions, and more as a constructive analysis of the\nalgebraic conception of set theory. That is, he should focus primarily\non defending the algebraic conception of set theory as an\nindependently plausible conception of set theory (step 1), and\nhe should then present set-theoretic relativity as simply a new and\nsurprising consequence of this positive conception (steps 2\u20133).\nThis argumentative strategy leaves room for the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems to do some real philosophical work\u2014e.g., as described\ntwo paragraphs ago. It also gives step 1 a tighter\u2014and a more\nconstructive\u2014focus. On this reading, step 1 serves mainly to\nhighlight the positive virtues of the algebraic conception; criticizing\nordinary set-theoretic notions is (at best) a secondary\n concern.[40]\n(See section 3.3 for more on this kind of point.)\n\n\nThis brings us to the criticisms of the Skolemite argument which\nhave appeared in the recent literature. Three general forms of\ncriticism are worth mentioning. First, a number of authors have\nresponded to the Skolemite argument by simply slowly and carefully\nunpacking the mathematics surrounding the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems so as to show that these theorems themselves cause no problems\nfor even quite naive understandings of set theory (Resnik 1966;\nBenacerraf 1985; Bays 2007a). While this kind of response is effective\nagainst the simplistic version of the Skolemite argument that we\ndiscussed six paragraphs ago, it does very little against the more\nsophisticated arguments that we're currently considering\u2014i.e.,\narguments which start with an independent criticism of such\nnaive\n understandings.[41]\n Given this, and given that we've already\ndiscussed this kind of response in some detail in section 2, we'll say\nno more about it here.\n\n\nSecond, several authors have responded to the Skolemite argument by\ndirectly criticizing the algebraic conception of set theory and\ndefending more ordinary and intuitive understandings of set-theoretic\nlanguage (Myhill 1967; Resnik 1969; Hart 1970; Benacerraf 1985). There\nare three issues which we should highlight here. First, it's hard to\nsee how the algebraic conception could provide a general\naccount of mathematical language, given that the conception itself\nseems to presuppose an intuitive background theory in which to\nformulate and prove our model-theoretic results (e.g., the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems). This issue is exacerbated when we\nfocus on the third step in the Skolemite argument, since that step\nseems to require both an absolute account of the natural numbers and an\nabsolute account of enumeration in order to formulate its conception of\n\u201cabsolute countability\u201d (see Resnik 1969; Benacerraf 1985;\nand Shapiro 1991; see Thomas 1971; Klenk 1976; and Bellotti 2006 for\nsome concerns about this line of argument).\n\n\nNote, here, that these initial points seem to tell against using any\ncompletely general criticism of mathematical realism to push\npeople towards the algebraic conception of axioms. On the surface,\nafter all, any sufficiently general criticism of realism would apply to\nthe Skolemite's own model theory as much as it does to classical set\ntheory. It's doubtful, therefore, whether the Skolemite can really\nappeal to, say, simple worries about \u201cplatonism\u201d or about\nour epistemic access to mathematical objects to motivate a full-blown\nSkolemite position. In short: the very fact that Skolemite arguments\nturn on substantial mathematical theorems seems to force the\nSkolemite into accepting that some parts of mathematics are not subject\nto Skolemite relativity. (In addition to the references in the last\nparagraph, see Bays 2001; Bellotti 2005; and Bays 2007b for discussion\nof this kind of point in the context of Putnam's model-theoretic\nargument.)\n\n\nOf course, this first argument leaves open the possibility that set\ntheory is a special case\u2014that, even though some branches of\nmathematics, like number theory and analysis, should be understood\nabsolutely, set theory, like group theory and topology, should still be\nunderstood algebraically. Unfortunately, there are a number of obvious\ndifferences between the practice of set theory and that of more-clearly\nalgebraic subjects like group theory. So, for instance, mathematicians\ntend to treat the axioms of set theory as being less fixed\nthan those of group theory or topology. In set theory, mathematicians\nsometimes raise the question as to whether the ZFC axioms are\ncorrect\u2014i.e., they talk as though there is an intuitive notion of\nset against which the ZFC axioms might be checked and found wanting. In\ngroup theory and topology, by contrast, it simply makes no sense to\ntalk about \u201cintuitive notions\u201d which could diverge from the\nnotion specified by the relevant\n axioms.[42]\n In a similar vein, set theorists sometimes\ndebate whether we should add new axioms to the standard axioms of set\ntheory\u2014e.g., large cardinal axioms, or axioms like V=L, or even\njust axioms like Con(ZFC). In contrast, no one would dream of making\nadditions to the axioms of group theory or topology. In this sense,\nthen, an algebraic approach to set theory is revisionary of\nset-theoretic practice in a way that an algebraic approach to group\ntheory is not.\n\n\nFinally, even if we do accept an algebraic conception of set\ntheory\u2014perhaps because we have a larger commitment to some kind\nof structuralist philosophy of mathematics\u2014it's unclear why this\ncommitment requires us to limit ourselves to first-order\naxiomatizations of set theory. After all, many of the most successful\ninstances of the algebraic approach to axiomatization\u2014e.g., the\n19th-century results that arithmetic and analysis can be given\ncategorical axiomatizations\u2014turn on using a second-order\nbackground logic. And, as we noted in section 2, second-order versions\nof ZFC do not give rise to Skolem's Paradox. Hence, it's not enough for\nSkolemites to defend an algebraic approach to the\naxiomatization of set theory, they need to show that a\nfirst-order algebraic approach is the right way to go. See\nHart 1970 and Shapiro 1991 for developments of this line of\nargument.\n\n\nSo much, then, for general criticisms of the algebraic\nconception of axiomatization and its role in the Skolemite argument. We\nturn now to a more-focused objection to the third step in that\nargument. For the sake of argument, let's grant that the Skolemite has\nshown that our set-theoretic notions are relative and that, for every\nkind of set that we can define with a formula, there is an\ninstance of this kind of set which is only countable. So, there is\na countable instance of the power set of \u03c9, a\ncountable instance of the real numbers,\n etc.[43]\n Still, it's unclear why\nthis shows that every set is \u201cabsolutely\u201d\ncountable. After all, just as the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem shows\nthat we can find countable instances of all these sets, the\nUpward-L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem shows that we can also find\nuncountable instances.\n\n\nGiven this, a number of critics have suggested that Skolemites face\ntwo explanatory burdens and that, so far, no Skolemite has managed to\nmeet these burdens. First, the Skolemite needs to explain how we can\nidentify sets across different models\u2014i.e., why we should\nconsider the various different objects which satisfy\n\u201cx is the power set of \u03c9\u201d in\ndifferent models of set theory to be \u201cthe same set.\u201d Note\nthat some such identification is essential if the Skolemite is going to\nstart with a proof of the countability of one of these objects and then\nuse this proof to argue for the absolute countability of all the others\n(Resnik 1966). Second, the Skolemite needs to explain his preference\nfor countable sets. Even if the Skolemite can identify countable and\nuncountable \u201cinstances\u201d of a given set, he needs to explain\nwhy this identification leads to the conclusion that all sets are\n\u201cabsolutely countable\u201d rather than to the conclusion that\nall sets are \u201cabsolutely uncountable\u201d (Resnik 1966;\nBenacerraf 1985).\n\n\nThese, then, are the main criticisms of the Skolemite position which\nhave appeared in the literature. To treat them more thoroughly would,\nunfortunately, require us to dive pretty deeply into questions\nconcerning, e.g., the status of our informal understanding of\nset-theoretic language, the legitimacy of second-order quantification,\nand the identity conditions associated with mathematical objects in\nstructuralist philosophies of mathematics. Exploring these\nissues would take us pretty far away from Skolem's Paradox itself. For\na recent survey of some of the relevant literature here, see Bellotti\n2006.\n3.3 The Multiverse\n\n\nOver the last decade, the set theorist Joel Hamkins has been arguing\nfor a conception of set theory which bears a surprising resemblance to\nthe traditional Skolemite position (though Hamkins' own motivations\nseem to come more from set theory itself than from the traditional\nphilosophical literature).  Hamkins notes that, as set theorists have\ndeveloped more and more powerful tools for constructing and comparing\ndifferent models of set theory\u2014forcing, inner model theory,\nlarge cardinal embeddings, etc.\u2014they have become less and less\nlikely to treat any particular model as cannonical.  Instead, set\ntheory has increasing come to focus on comparing different\nmodels of set theory, rather than singling out one model as\npriviledged.  Hamkins argues, therefore, that set theorists should\naccept what he calls a \u201cmultiverse\u201d conception of set\ntheory\u2014a conception in which no model of set theory is\nprivileged, and the purpose of set theory is simply to explore the\nrelations between the various models.\n\nThis multiverse conception is clearly related to the algebraic\nconception discussed in\nsections 3.1\u20133.2.\nFurther, it satisfies one of the key desiderata that we isolated in\nsection 3.2.  Hamkins defends the multiverse as an\nindependently plausible conception of set theory, and he argues that\nthe motivation for accepting it comes from within mathematical\npractice.  (I.e., Hamkins does not argue that, because forcing\nextensions are possible, we are stuck with\nset-theoretic relativity; rather, he argues that, because forcing\nextensions are natural, we should embrace\nset-theoretic relativity.)  In this sense, something like the\nmultiverse could well constitute the \u201cright\u201d way of\ndeveloping the algebraic conception.\n\nFurther, the multiverse conception leads naturally to the kinds of\nconclusions traditional Skolemites tended to favor.  Let a be\na set in some model M (where M lives\nsomewhere in the multiverse).  Then M has a forcing\nextension, M[G], in which a is only\ncountable.  This provides a natural gloss on the Skolemite claim that\n\u201cevery set is countable from some perspective.\u201d Similarly,\nthe Skolemite's bias in favor of countability (see\nsection 3.2) can be explained by the fact that,\nif a is countable in one model M, then it\nstays countable in all extensions of that model.  In contrast,\nuncountable sets can always be made countable by passing to an\nappropriate forcing extension.  For more on the multiverse, see\nHamkins 2011 and Hamkins 2012.  For some criticisms, see Koellner 2013 \n(under Other Internet Resources).\n3.4 Putnam's Model-Theoretic Argument\n\n\nIn recent years, the most widely discussed version of Skolem's\nParadox has come come in (one version of) Hilary Putnam's so-called\n\u201cmodel-theoretic argument against realism.\u201d Putnam's\ngeneral goal in the model-theoretic argument is to show that\nour language is semantically indeterminate\u2014that there's no fact\nof the matter as to what the terms and predicates of our language refer\nto. In the case of set theory, therefore, he wants to show that there's\nno single set-theoretic universe over which our quantifiers range and\nno single relation to which the word \u201cmembership\u201d refers.\nIn Putnam's own terms, there is no single \u201cintended model\u201d\nfor the language of set theory.\n\n\nIn the first few pages of his 1980 paper, \u201cModels and\nReality,\u201d Putnam argues that there is at least one intended model\nfor the language of set theory which satisfies the set-theoretic axiom\n V=L.[44]\n To show\nthis, Putnam begins by assuming that there are only two things which\ncould play a role in fixing the intended model for set-theoretic\nlanguage. First, there are what Putnam calls \u201ctheoretical\nconstraints.\u201d These include the standard axioms of set theory, as\nwell as principles and theories from other branches of science. Second,\nthere are \u201coperational constraints.\u201d These are just the\nvarious empirical observations and measurements that we make in the\ncourse of scientific investigation.\n\n\nGiven these assumptions, Putnam argues that finding an intended\nmodel which satisfies V=L simply requires finding a model of ZF+V=L\nwhich satisfies the relevant theoretical and operational constraints.\nHis strategy for finding this model rests on the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: ZF plus V=L has an\n\u03c9-model which contains any given countable set of real\nnumbers.\n\n\n\n\nHere, the fact that this model satisfies ZFC is supposed to ensure\nthat it satisfies all of the theoretical constraints which come from\nset theory itself, while the richness of ZFC ensures that the model\nalso has the resources to code up our best scientific theories (and\nthereby to satisfy all of the theoretical constraints which come from\nnatural science). Finally, the fact that this model contains an\narbitrary set of real numbers ensures that it can code up all of the\nvarious observations and measurements which constitute our\n\u201cobservational\n constraints.\u201d[45]\n So, as long as Putnam is right in thinking\nthat the intended models of set theory are fixed solely by the formal\nstructure of our scientific theories\u2014including our explicit\nset-theoretic axioms\u2014and by the physical measurements that we\nhappen to make, then this theorem will generate an intended model in\nwhich V=L comes out true.\n\n\nThis version of the model-theoretic argument has three connections\nto Skolem's Paradox. First, Putnam himself presents the argument as a\nnatural development of the paradox. At the beginning of his paper,\nPutnam provides a quick sketch of Skolem's Paradox, and he then\nsuggests that his analysis of V=L comes from taking Skolem's arguments\nand \u201cextending them in somewhat the direction he [Skolem] seemed\nto be indicating\u201d (p 1). Second, and as evidenced by the passages\nquoted in footnote\n 44,\n Putnam's overall\nconclusions fit well with more-recent Skolemite understandings of\nSkolem's Paradox\u2014see, e.g., his conclusion that V=L has no\n\u201cdeterminate truth value\u201d (p 5) or that Skolem's\n\u201c\u2009\u2018relativity of set-theoretic notions\u2019\nextends to a relativity of the truth value of\n\u2018V=L\u2019\u2009\u201d (p 8). Finally, and most importantly,\nthe proof of Putnam's theorem turns crucially on the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems. (Very roughly, Putnam starts by\napplying the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem to L, so\nas to prove that his theorem holds in L; he then employs\nShoenfield absoluteness to reflect the theorem back up to\n V.)[46]\n\n\nPutnam's argument has received a number of kinds of criticism in\nthe literature. On the technical front, Bays has argued that Putnam's\nuse of the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem is illegitimate,\nsince standard systems of set theory do not allow us to apply this\ntheorem to a proper class like L. Indeed, even if we leave the details\nof Putnam's proofs aside, G\u00f6delean considerations show\nthat Putnam's theorem cannot be proved in ZFC at all (since\nthe theorem entails ZFC's consistency). Of course, if Putnam is willing\nto use a stronger background theory to prove his theorem\u2014e.g.,\nZFC + \u201cthere exists an inaccessible cardinal\u201d\u2014then he\ncan evade these kinds of criticisms. But in this case, it's unclear why\nthe model which results from Putnam's theorem should still be thought\nto satisfy our theoretical constraints. After all, anyone who accepts\nthe new axioms used in Putnam's revised proof will have theoretical\nconstraints which go somewhat beyond ZFC + V=L\u2014e.g., their\ntheoretical constraints might well include the axiom \u201cthere\nexists an inaccessible cardinal.\u201d See Bays 2001 for Bays'\noriginal formulation of this objection; see Velleman 1998 and Gaifman\n2004 for some alternate formulations; see Bellotti 2005 and Bays 2007b\nfor critical discussion; and see chapter 3 (esp. \u00a7 3.3.3) of\nHafner 2005 for discussion of a similar point concerning Putnam's use\nof transitivity.\n\nButton (2011) has argued that, although this kind of technical\ncriticism has teeth against the version of Putnam's argument which\nexplicitly invokes the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem, there\nare alternate formulations of Putnam's argument which can evade the\ncriticism. In particular, Button notes that even very weak theories\ncan prove theorems like: \u201cif ZFC is consistent, then ZFC has a\ncountable model.\u201d Since any proponent of ZFC must accept that\nZFC is consistent, these weak theories are enough to get several\nvariants of Putnam's argument off the ground.  See Button 2011 for\ndevelopment of this point.  See Bellotti 2005 and Bays 2007a for\ndiscussion of a somewhat similar point.\n\n\n\nStaying in the technical vein, several authors have noted a tension\nin the way Putnam's argument deals with the notion of finitude. On the\none hand, Putnam needs to use this notion in order to characterize his\nmodel as an \u03c9-model and (even) to make sense of the formal\ndefinitions of a first-order language and of the first-order\nsatisfaction\n relation.[47]\n On the other hand, Putnam can't allow opponents\nof his argument to use this notion to specify what they think\nmakes a model intended. If his opponents could use this notion, then\nthey could define the notion of a model's being\n\u201cwell-founded,\u201d and that would be enough to rule out the\nmodels generated by Putnam's theorem. In this sense, then, Putnam's\nargument seems to turn on an unmotivated asymmetry between the kinds of\ntechnical machinery that he himself uses and the kinds of machinery\nthat he makes available to his critics. See Bays 2001 and Bellotti 2005\nfor developments of this point; see \u00a7 3.4 of Hafner 2005 for some\ncritical reflections.\n\n\nOn the more-purely philosophical side, many authors have criticized\nPutnam's assumption that simply satisfying a first-order formalization\nof our theoretical constraints is enough to make a model\n\u201cintended.\u201d So, for instance, Hacking has argued that we\nshould really be committed to a second-order formulation of set theory\nand that Putnam's key theorem doesn't apply to such formulations\n(Hacking 1983). Others have argued that the intended model for set\ntheory needs to be transitive and that, once again, there's no reason\nto believe that the model produced by Putnam's theorem is\ntransitive (Bays 2001). Finally, and as mentioned in the last\nparagraph, several authors have suggested that an intended model for\nset theory should at least be well-founded, but there's no reason to\nthink that Putnam's own model is well-founded (Bellotti\n2005).\n\n\nPutnam's response to this kind of objection is interesting. Very\nroughly, Putnam suggests that any conditions on intended models which\nother philosophers might propose\u2014e.g., those mentioned in the\nlast paragraph\u2014should themselves be formalized in first-order\nterms and treated as new theoretical constraints. When these new\nconstraints are fed back through Putnam's argument, he will once again\nbe able to generate a model which \u201csatisfies\u201d these\nconstraints. So, by simply adopting a particularly flexible reading of\nthe phrase \u201ctheoretical constraints,\u201d Putnam ensures that\nalmost any conditions on intended models can simply be folded\nback into his original argument (Putnam 1980; Putnam 1983,\n vii\u2013xii).[48]\n\n\nThis argument\u2014which is usually called the \u201cjust more\ntheory\u201d argument\u2014has received a huge amount of attention in\nthe literature. The most common response to the argument involves\ndrawing a distinction between describing the features of a\nmodel which make that model intended and simply adding new\nsentences for that model to satisfy. Put otherwise, it involves\ndistinguishing between changing the semantics under which our\naxioms get interpreted\u2014e.g., by restricting the class of\nstructures which count as models for our language and/or strengthening\nthe notion of satisfaction which ties sentences to models\u2014and\nsimply adding new axioms to be interpreted using the same old\nsemantics. The response then goes on to argue that proposals like those\ndiscussed two paragraphs ago\u2014e.g., that intended models should be\ntransitive or well-founded or satisfy second-order ZFC\u2014should be\nunderstood as falling on the description side of this distinction\nrather than on the \u201cadding sentences\u201d side (although the\nlatter is where Putnam's just more theory argument resolutely insists\non putting them).\n\n\nIn turn, Putnam has argued that this kind of response begs the\nquestion against his overall argument. Putnam's argument, after all,\nconcerns the question of whether our mathematical language has any\ndeterminate significance, and the response we're considering seems to\nsimply assume that it has such significance when the response\nuses phrases like \u201ctransitive,\u201d \u201cwell-founded,\u201d\nor \u201ccomplete power set of M\u201d to describe\nits notion of \u201cintended model.\u201d In short: as long as the\ndeterminacy of mathematical language is still at issue, it would beg\nthe question to make free use of this language in describing the\nintended model of set theory. Or so, at any rate, Putnam tries to\nargue.\n\n\nAs indicated above, this aspect of Putnam's argument has generated a\nhuge literature. See Devitt 1984, chapter 11; Lewis 1984; Taylor 1991;\nVan Cleve 1992; Hale and Wright 1997; Chambers 2000; Bays 2001; and\nBays 2008 for some representative criticisms of Putnam's argument. See\nPutnam 1983, vii\u2013xii and Putnam 1989 for Putnam's response. See\nAnderson 1993; Douven 1999; Haukioja 2001; and Kroon 2001 for some\nrecent defenses of this aspect of Putnam's argument.\n4. Conclusion\n\n\nWe close this entry with a brief recap of two of the main points\nthat we've tried to emphasize. First, from a purely mathematical\nstandpoint, there's no conflict between Cantor's Theorem and the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems. There's a technical solution to\nSkolem's Paradox which explains why the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems\npose no problems for either naive forms of set-theoretic realism or\nvarious forms of axiomatized set theory. Hence, there's no chance of\nusing the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems by themselves to\ngenerate substantial Skolemite conclusions. Of course, there are still\nsome interesting technical issues which live in the neighborhood of\nSkolem's Paradox. For example, we can look at how the paradox plays out\nin the context of particular first-order models; we can examine the\ndegree to which various kinds of non-first-order logic are susceptible\nto the paradox; and we can try to isolate the precise features of\nfirst-order logic which allow the paradox to apply to it. Each of these\ntopics is clearly related to Skolem's Paradox, and each raises\nquestions about the relationship between model theory and set theory\nwhich are well worth exploring. But, considered simply in and of\nitself, Skolem's Paradox poses no threats to classical set theory.\n\n\nSecond, if we come to Skolem's Paradox with antecedent doubts about\nclassical set theory\u2014e.g., the kinds of doubts which lie behind\nsome of the more sophisticated reconstructions of Skolem's original\nargument, the kinds of doubts which lie behind the more plausible\nversions of step 1 in the Skolemite argument, or the kinds of doubts\nabout semantic determinacy which lie behind Putnam's model-theoretic\nargument\u2014then we may well be able to parley Skolem's Paradox into\nsome kind of interesting philosophical conclusion. Of course there will\nstill be challenges here: we need to account for the status of the\nbackground theories in which we prove the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorems, we need to explain the special significance of\nfirst-order axiomatizations of set theory, and we may need to\nexplain how we can identify elements across various models of set\ntheory. In principle, however, these kinds of sophisticated uses of\nSkolem's Paradox are not precluded by the technical solution to the\nparadox that was mentioned in the last paragraph. Nor should this fact\nbe all that surprising: if we put enough philosophy into our analysis\nof Skolem's Paradox, then we should expect to get at least a little\nphilosophy out.\n",
