    "main_text": "How to Specify the Threshold || Specifying the Threshold by Prioritarian Reasoning\n4.2 Specifying the Threshold by Prioritarian Reasoning\n\nAccording to the priority view (Parfit 1997: 213; Holtug\n2007; Attas 2009:\n207\u2013211), equality as such does not matter. It is therefore not\nopen to objections against holding equality to be of intrinsic value.\nA plausible version of the priority view reads as follows:\n\n\nPriority view: Benefiting persons matters more the worse off\nthe person is to whom the benefits accrue, the more people are being\nbenefited and the greater the benefits in question.\n\n\nThe priority view has a built-in tendency towards equality, for the\nview accepts the following egalitarian condition: If X is worse\noff than Y, we have at least a prima facie reason for\npromoting the well-being of X rather than Y (unless\nconditions obtain under which the only or best way of raising the\nwell-being of X is by raising the well-being of Y or\nconditions under which promoting the well-being of X brings\nabout raising the well-being of Y as a side-effect). Even if\nprioritarians do not see anything intrinsically bad in social,\neconomic or other differences, their priority view is a derivatively\negalitarian view. To this extent it is correctly described as\nnon-relational egalitarianism.\n\nWe might want to rely on the priority view for specifying the\nthreshold of harm. On this interpretation, future people are in a\nharmed state unless they are as well off as such a prioritarian view\nrequires. There are at least two problems in understanding the\nthreshold as an element of a prioritarian understanding of\nintergenerational justice: First, the priority view is likely to\nentail excessive intergenerational requirements. Present actions or\ninactions can improve the well-being of many future generations to at\nleast some extent. Moreover, the number of future people will likely\nbe very large and depends in part upon currently living people\u2019s\ndecisions and actions. Hence, according to prioritarianism, we ought\nto sacrifice more of our present well-being for the sake of future\ngenerations than seems plausible. It might even be the case that we\nare required to incur significant costs for the sake of only minuscule\nfuture benefits (as in this way we might maximize the weighted sum of\nbenefits for future persons (see Rawls 1999: 287; Wolf 2009: 373; Meyer & Roser 2009:\n233\u2013235). How likely it is that the priority view has this\nimplication will also depend upon the strength the view gives to the\npriority of the worse off who are (very) badly off. Of course, the\npriority view will not have this implication if (whatever currently\nliving people do) all future people were to enjoy levels of well-being\nthat are higher than those of all or most currently living people.\n\nSecond, the priority view does not entail a plausible population cap.\nUnder some circumstances having large but badly off future generations\nmight be consistent with prioritizing the number of beneficiaries, the\nsize of benefits and those who are worse off (see entry on\n repugnant conclusion;\n Meyer 1997: 139\u2013140).\n",
