Key Features of Transcendental Arguments\n\nFrom something like the canon of transcendental arguments outlined\nabove, the characteristic marks and the significance of such\narguments might be listed as follows:\n\n1. Transcendental arguments are typically anti-sceptical, so that (as\nStrawson puts it) it is widely assumed that \u2018the point of\ntranscendental arguments in general is an anti-sceptical point\u2019\n(Strawson 1985: 10). Moreover, in the ambitious form in which we have\nconsidered them so far, they refute the sceptic in a direct manner, by\npurporting to prove what she doubts or questions, and they do so on\ntheir own, without bringing in any wider epistemological theories or\nconsiderations. And these arguments are what is sometimes called\nworld-directed or \u00adtruth-directed, as opposed to\nself-directed (cf. Peacocke 1989: 4; Cassam 1997: 33; Cassam\n1999: 83): that is, they set out to establish the truth of some claim\nabout how reality is and what it contains (such as subject-independent\nobjects in space and time, or other minds, or causal laws).\n\n2. Because of their anti-sceptical ambitions, transcendental arguments\nmust begin from a starting point that the sceptic can be expected to\naccept, the necessary condition of which is then said to be something\nthat the sceptic doubts or denies. This will then mean that such\narguments are ineffective against very radical forms of scepticism,\nwhich doubt the laws of logic, and/or which refuse to accept\nany starting point as uncontentious; and it will also mean\nthat they may be effective against a sceptic who is prepared to accept\nsome starting point, but then ineffective against another sceptic who\nis not. But neither of these features of transcendental arguments need\nbe felt to be disabling: for the scepticism of the radical sceptics is\nperhaps of dubious coherence, or at least of little interest because\nthey seem so unwilling to engage with us, while the second limitation\nmay mean merely that different transcendental arguments are required\nfor different sceptical audiences.\n\n3. Because of the need to find an uncontentious starting point,\ntranscendental arguments will also then characteristically be first\npersonal, by beginning from how I or we experience,\nthink, judge, and so on. Thus, while it is perhaps reasonable to hold\nthat there are necessary conditions for the possibility of\n\u2018extra-personal\u2019 entities such as material objects,\nsubstances, the universe, time and so on, a transcendental argument\nwhich is directed against scepticism is unlikely to be concerned with\nexploring such conditions, as the sceptic is unlikely to admit the\nexistence of the things to which the conditions belong.\n\n4. Transcendental arguments involve transcendental claims, to\nthe effect that X is a necessary condition for the\npossibility of Y, where in saying this, the arguments do not\nassume this to be a matter of merely causal, natural, or nomological\nnecessity. Given that their target is the sceptic who challenges our\nclaims about the world, there are clearly two good reasons for this.\nFirst, although our observation of the world might suggest that\nexperience has certain necessary causal conditions (e.g., light and\nsound must be transmitted between particular wavelengths), we can\nhardly use such considerations against a sceptic of this sort, for\nwhom all such empirical knowledge is in question, and against whom we\nare therefore required to adopt a position that is less open to doubt\nin this way. Second, if the transcendental argument\u2019s claim is\none of only natural necessity, then this allows that there are\nmetaphysically possible worlds (for example, where the laws of physics\ndo not hold) in which this claim is false, again opening us up to the\nsceptical challenge of showing we are not in such a world.\n\n5. However, if the transcendental claims involved are not a matter of\nmerely causal or natural necessity, this then raises the question of\nwhat form of necessity they do in fact involve. If they were\ntrue in virtue of their meaning alone (even if unobviously so), and\nthus analytic, then the necessity might be said to be purely logical,\nwhere to deny the claim is then to assert some form of logical\ncontradiction (cf. Bennett 1979, Walker 1978: 18\u201323, Walker\n1989: 63\u20134, Bell 1999). Assuming that the problematic\nanalytic/synthetic distinction is viable, this may still not seem\nto be the case in many instances of such transcendental claims, where\nin fact they may be said to be synthetic a priori (cf.\nWilkerson 1976: 199\u2013213). To many, nonetheless, it has appeared\nthat the transcendental claim is not a logical necessity, but stands\nsomewhere between that and natural necessity, perhaps putting it into\nthe camp of metaphysical necessity, as this is sometimes\nunderstood: that is, a necessary relation which holds not by virtue of\nlogical or causal constraints on the nature of logical or physical\npossibilities, but by virtue of metaphysical constraints on how things\ncan be\u2014much as the fact that nothing can be red and green all\nover is arguably not determined by any law of logic or causal law, but\nthe nature of colour, and how it can be exemplified in things. There\nwill be more on this in section 5 below.\n\n6. It is then partly because of the apparently rather special nature\nof these transcendental claims, that the suspicion arises that there\nwill then turn out to be something distinctively Kantian about such\narguments; for Kant made it the focus of his critical project to\naccount for metaphysical knowledge of this sort, where transcendental\nidealism is then supposed to provide the answer to how such knowledge\nis possible. The idea, roughly speaking, is that it is too much for us\nto be able to know how things must be beyond the limits of our\nexperience, and so claim metaphysical knowledge of\nthings-in-themselves. By contrast, once we confine ourselves to how\nthings appear to us given our ways of seeing and thinking about the\nworld, then we can understand how we could at least acquire knowledge\nof how things must behave as phenomena, by knowing about the forms of\nintuitions and concepts through which such phenomena must appear to us\nif we are to experience them at all (cf. Williams 1974, Pippin 1988,\nStroud 1999, Stroud 2000a). However, as we saw in the case of\nStrawson, whether or not such full-blooded Kantian commitments are\nnecessary to the transcendental argument strategy is a matter of\ndispute. Indeed, some have argued that there is a \u2018neglected\nalternative\u2019 here: namely, while Kant might be right to hold\nthat we cannot plausibly claim insight into the constraints on the\nworld itself but only on the nature of our sensibility and\nunderstanding, nonetheless we can argue from this that the world must\nitself be a certain way to fit these conditions, without thereby\nthinking that it is mind-dependent or that all we thereby know is how\nthings appear to us. The analogy is thus drawn to a case such as the\nfollowing: once we know how our lungs work, we can know what the air\nmust be like in order to allow us to breath, without the nature\nof air being determined by how our lungs work (cf. Harrison 1989,\nWestphal 2004: 68\u2013126).\n\nThe features discussed above therefore have a reasonable claim to be\nwhat make transcendental arguments distinctive, at least of the sort\nwe have considered so far. However, as we shall now go on to see,\ntranscendental arguments of this type have turned out to be open to\nserious objections, so that alternative models have been proposed\nwhich do not incorporate all these features in quite the same way.\n",
