    "main_text": "Self-Cultivation || Knowledge\n4.1 Knowledge\n\nMost Confucians took the Confucian canon to be authoritative and true.\nTexts like the Analects, the Mencius, and the\nRites were required reading for any aspiring scholar and\nConfucians often appealed to these texts to substantiate their claims.\nBut modern readers are sometimes surprised to learn that there was\nsome debate about whether and to what extent reading the Confucian\nclassics was required for proper self-development (Ivanhoe 2000). On\nthe one hand, it seemed obvious to many Confucians that many people\nhad the wrong views and the authoritative Confucian texts seemed the\nmost obvious way to correct those views. On the other hand, some\nConfucians of this era worried that knowledge acquired from books\ncouldn\u2019t be obtained and internalized in ways required for\nwholehearted virtue (see\n section 3.3).\n Moreover, most agreed that we have well-formed ethical capacities by\nnature\n (section 3.2).\n Accordingly, philosophers like Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming thought\nwe could rely more on our own intuitions or deeply-felt moral insights\nthat come from daily life, and that these were often preferable to the\nmore fragmentary and abstract types of study connected to book\nlearning (CXL 49; Ivanhoe 2002: 77\u201380; Ivanhoe 2009:\n34\u201339; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 243\u2013245). In\ncontrast, Zhu Xi worried that intuitions were too unreliable, that we\nare too predisposed to rationalize or find clever ways of\ncountenancing self-serving inclinations and judgments, and thought\nreading authoritative Confucian texts with an open mind and\nreverential attention a good way to check our self-serving biases\n(Angle & Tiwald 2017: 151\u2013155; Chu 1990: 128\u2013162;\nZZYL 10\u201311).\n\nConfucians in the Song-Ming period adopted from the Mencius a\ngeneral framework for the acquisition of ethical knowledge, according\nto which there are certain paradigm scenarios or cases (e.g., when\nseeing a child about to fall into a well or when food is given with\ncontempt) that elicit reliably good or virtuous responses, but many\nother cases which do not. As Mencius describes his goal there, the\ngoal is to \u201cextend\u201d (tui \u63a8) or expand the\nreliable ethical judgments and emotional responses from those paradigm\nscenarios to the new ones (Mencius 2A6, 6A10). In the\nMencius that is done in part by noticing relevant\nsimilarities between cases, as when one sees that accepting a bribe\nfor a special favor is self-debasing and shameful in ways similar to\naccepting food given with contempt, or the treatment due to seniors in\ngeneral is similar to the respect we already give to our own elders\n(Mencius 1A7, 6A10; Van Norden 2007: 234\u2013246).\nConfucians in the Song through Ming tend to characterize the\nacquisition of new moral knowledge similarly, often invoking the\nMencian notion of \u201cextension\u201d. Zhu Xi adds that we acquire\nnew moral knowledge in part by seeing how a rule or norm to which we\nshould conform fits into a larger system of norms that sustain a\nsystem of mutual life-generativity (a system in which life, growth,\nand reproduction are ongoing and reciprocal). This is part of what he\ndescribes as discerning the \u201creasons why it is so\u201d\n(suoyi ran zhi gu \u6240\u4ee5\u7136\u4e4b\u6545),\nand is necessary for a deeper understanding of rules or norms that we\notherwise take on faith or confidence in the tradition (ZZYL\n18:625; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 122\u2013129).\n\nSong-Ming Confucians were also interested in different kinds or types\nof knowledge. One oft-discussed distinction was between mere\n\u201cordinary knowledge\u201d (changzhi \u5e38\u77e5)\nand \u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201ctrue knowledge\u201d\n(zhenzhi \u771f\u77e5). Ordinary knowledge is often\nportrayed as merely a correct and reliably informed affirmation that\nsomething is true or right, while genuine knowledge often requires\nsome personal acquaintance with the matter, and necessarily issues in\n(or is constituted by) some appropriate feeling and motivation. In one\ninfluential discussion, Cheng Yi illustrates the distinction by\ndescribing two different sorts of reactions to news that a tiger was\nattacking people in the vicinity. Some villagers were startled but did\nnot have the powerful, almost involuntary fear of the one farmer who\nhad been wounded by a tiger in the past. Cheng suggests that ethical\nknowledge should have the same character as the survivor\u2019s fear\n(HNCSYS 2a:16, 15:147; Graham 1992: 80). Wang Yangming later\nused this rough framework to argue for his famous thesis that\nknowledge and action are united (Chen 1991: 93\u201398; Ivanhoe 2000:\n62\u201366; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 266\u2013268).\n\nMany Confucians in the Daoxue (\u201cLearning of the\nWay\u201d) tradition also distinguished between \u201csensory\nknowledge\u201d (wenjian zhi zhi\n\u805e\u898b\u4e4b\u77e5) and the sort of knowledge that\nconcerns or can be attributed to our virtuous nature (dexing zhi\nzhi \u5fb7\u6027\u4e4b\u77e5). These were distinguished\nin various ways by influential Daoxue Confucians. Zhang Zai\nthought that in the case of sensory knowledge, knowers always conceive\nthe object of knowledge as external and separate from themselves,\nwhereas in the latter sort of knowledge the knower and known are\nunited. Zhang believed that sensory knowledge was both fallible and\ninsufficient for many purposes (especially ethical purposes) but\nallowed that sensory knowledge is necessary as a means of acquiring\nknowledge of the virtuous nature, and perhaps also as providing\nwarrants or justifications for the latter sort of knowledge\n(ZM 7:24\u201325; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 112\u2013114;\nZuo 2019). The Cheng brothers adamantly opposed the view that\nknowledge of the virtuous nature \u201cdepends on\u201d sensory\nknowledge (HNCSYS 25:317). But they seemed to think that this\npertained to certain kinds of dependence and not others, because they\ncontinued to recommend that people read texts and undertake\ninvestigations of external things and affairs (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 115\u2013116). Some of the Cheng brothers\u2019 immediate\ndisciples entertained more explicitly innatist views of proper\nknowledge of the virtuous nature, suggesting that we find it solely\nthrough inward reflection and meditation (Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n216\u2013217). But Zhu Xi thought innate intuitions were unreliable\nand thus politely declined to make any hard-and-fast distinctions\nbetween the two kinds of knowledge (Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n117\u2013119). Zhu did, however, continue to think that the most\ntransformative and motivational knowledge is in some sense knowledge\nof our own (virtuous) nature, whatever external means we may use to\nacquire it (ZZYL 10:161; Zhu 2019: 29).\n",
