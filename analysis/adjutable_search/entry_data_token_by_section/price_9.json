    "main_text": "Perception || Criticisms of the Causal Theory\n3.3 Criticisms of the Causal Theory\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 4) scrutinises the so-called Causal theory which he\nthinks of as more or less equivalent to traditional\nrepresentationalism. Price\u2019s initial statement of the theory is:\n\n\n(1)\na sense-datum belongs to an object O if O\ncauses that sense-datum, and \n(2)\nperceptual consciousness is, fundamentally, an inference\nfrom effect to cause. \n\n\nTo make\n (2)\n consistent with our sense that in ordinary circumstances we do not\narrive at our convictions about the environment by inference, Price\nreads it as claiming that originally we form our convictions by such\ncausal inferences, but after that, dispositions are generated which\nmake the process automatic (1932: 68f). Price (1932: 70f) also\nproposes that\n (1)\n be replaced by the more complex analysis of \u201cbelonging\u201d\nby being a \u201cvarying or differential\u201d causal condition,\nmeaning that a perceiver\u2019s visual sense-data would be different\nif these causal conditions were different, in contrast to their\nstanding causal conditions (e.g., there being a source of light and an\neye in a certain state) which are perhaps \u201cnecessary to all the\nvisual sense-data alike, [but] do not wholly determine any of\nthem\u201d (1932: 70f; for discussion: Jackson 1977: 168). Famously,\nGrice (1961: 142ff) criticises the more complex analysis, requiring\ninstead that the perceived object contributes to the occurrence of the\nsense-datum (1961: 143; see also Kim 1977: 612; Sosa 2015:\n11\u201313).\n\nPrice himself moves quickly from\n (1)\n and concentrates on the revised version of\n (2).\n He allows that it is reasonable to infer that there are unsensed\ncauses of our sense-data (1932: 70\u201374), but what is the\ncharacter of those causes? Can a backward causal argument reveal that?\nIn answer, Price formulates five methods of argument that can be\ndeveloped. In outline, the methods isolate types of independence in\nfeatures of the given to ground inferences about the degrees of\nindependence in their postulated causes. Price\u2019s critical\nresponse is to suggest that the most such backward arguments can\nestablish is the existence of \u201cNon-sensible\u201d (1932: 74)\nsomethings-or-other with a plurality of aspects.\n",
