    "main_text": "Probability and Induction || Probability and Frequency\n2.1 Probability and Frequency\n\nReichenbach was one of the first to criticize the verifiability theory\nof meaning embraced by the Viennese school on account that\n\n\nit would be illusory to imagine that the terms \u2018true\u2019 or\n\u2018false\u2019 ever express anything else than high or low\nprobability values. (Reichenbach 1936: 156)\n\n\nThis brought probability to the foreground. Reichenbach embraced an\nempirical approach to probability and maintained that probability\nvalues must be determined on the basis of experience alone. What can\nbe extracted from experience are frequencies, and it is on their basis\nthat probability must be fixed. Reichenbach called the method for\nobtaining probability values induction by enumeration. This\nconsists in counting the relative frequency of a given attribute in\nthe initial section of a sequence of observations and inferring that\nsuch frequency will persist approximately for the rest of the sequence\nwhen this is indefinitely prolonged. This procedure forms the content\nof the canon according to which the frequency interpretation\nprescribes fixing prior probabilities, a tenet Reichenbach called\nRule of induction:\n\n\nif the sequence has a limit of the frequency, there must exist an\nn such that from there on the frequency \\(f^{i} (i \\gt n)\\)\nwill remain within the interval \\(f^{n} \\pm \\delta\\), where \\(\\delta\\)\nis a quantity that we can choose as small as we like, but that, once\nchosen, is kept constant. Now if we posit that the frequency \\(f^{i}\\)\nwill remain within the interval \\(f^{n} \\pm \\delta\\), and we correct\nthis posit for greater n by the same rule, we must finally\ncome to the correct result. (Reichenbach 1935 [1949: 445])\n\n\nEvery probability statement obtained by means of this method is a\nwager, or a posit, namely a statement allowing us to infer\nunknown from known frequencies in such a way that, if the sequence of\nobservations has a limit, the method will assure convergence to a\nunique result.\n\nSalmon wholeheartedly embraced the frequency interpretation, and in\nparticular Reichenbach\u2019s version of it, which embodies a way of\nmaking single case probability assignments. The key notion in this\nregard is that of weight, taken to represent the predictive\nvalue of sentences referring to single events. The idea is that the\nweight assigned to such sentences derives from the probabilities\nattached to the reference class to which the event in\nquestion belongs. The reference class should obey a criterion of\nhomogeneity, namely it should be chosen so as to include as\nmany cases as possible similar to the one under consideration,\nexcluding dissimilar ones. While Reichenbach recommended choosing\n\u201cthe narrowest class for which we have reliable\nstatistics\u201d (Reichenbach 1938: 316) Salmon opted for \u201cthe\nbroadest homogeneous reference class\u201d, because\n\n\nwe do not want to try to refer single cases to classes that are too\nnarrow, for if we do we will not have enough evidence upon which to\nbase our inference [\u2026] at the same time, we want our reference\nclass to contain other relevant cases, not irrelevant ones.\nStatistical relevance is the key concept here. (Salmon 1967a:\n91)\n\n\nThe reference class containing all and only the relevant properties is\nobjectively homogeneous. Salmon is well aware that\n\n\nit would be most unrealistic to suppose that we can fulfill the\nrequirement of selecting the broadest homogeneous reference class in\nall cases in which we have to make practical decisions about single\nevents. We may suspect that a given reference class is inhomogeneous,\nbut not know of any way to make a relevant partition of it. Under\nthese circumstances let us say that the class is epistemically\nhomogeneous. [\u2026] Sometimes we know that a reference class\nis inhomogeneous, but it would simply be impractical to carry out a\nrelevant subdivision. [\u2026] Under these circumstances, let us say\nthe reference class is practically homogeneous. (Salmon\n1967a: 92)\n\n\nAs we shall see\n (\u00a7 5.2),\n in addition to playing a crucial role in scientific inference by\nproviding the key to singular prediction, statistical relevance is no\nless essential for Salmon\u2019s conception of explanation, and the\nsame holds for reference class homogeneity.\n",
