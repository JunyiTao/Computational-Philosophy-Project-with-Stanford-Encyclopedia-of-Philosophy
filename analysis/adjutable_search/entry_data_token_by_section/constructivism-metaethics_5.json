    "main_text": "Humean Constructivism\n3. Humean Constructivism\n\nThe case for Humean constructivism rests on the alleged inadequacy of\ncompeting views: \u201cit is what we are forced to by the\nuntenability of realism plus the failure of Kantian versions of\nmetaethical constructivism\u201d (Street 2010: 371). Humean\nconstructivism denies that normative truths are independent of the\ndeliverances of practical reasoning (Bagnoli 2002: 131; Street 2008a,\n2010, 2012; Velleman 2009; Lenman 2010, 2012). To this extent, Humean\nconstructivism builds on the Kantian insight that normative truths are\nnot simply \u201cout there\u201d, as realists suppose. In contrast\nto Kantian constructivism, however, Humean constructivists abandon the\nclaim that moral obligations are requirements of practical reason. The\nconstitutive norms of practical reason may favor morality, but do not\nrequire it (Street 2012; Velleman 2009: 150\u2013154; Lenman 2010:\n192). Thus, Humeans maintain that an ideally coherent Caligula who\nvalues torturing people for fun is conceivable. Such a person would\nhave reasons for torturing people, which is just to say that the value\nof humanity is not a constitutive norm of reasoning (Street 2010: 371;\nStreet 2009, 2012). Humean constructivism also rejects the Kantian\nclaim that there are universal rational norms that bind all rational\nagents. For instance, Street argues that \u201cthe substantive\ncontent of a given agent\u2019s reasons is a function of his or her\nparticular, contingently given, evaluative starting points\u201d\n(Street 2010, see also Lenman 2010: 180\u2013181). Consequently,\n\u201ctruth and falsity in the normative domain must always be\nrelativized to a particular practical point of view\u201d (Street\n2008a: 224). Agreement among various practical standpoints is possible\nbut it is not guaranteed by facts about the nature of reason or the\nprinciples of reason that are authoritative for all rational agents.\nHumeans hold that there is nothing alarming about the sort of\nrelativism that their position implies (Street 2008a: 245). Even\nthough moral norms are not necessary requirements of reason, there is\na sense in which they are not contingent because they play a large\nrole in our lives. Furthermore, by analogy with attitudes such as\nlove, which is both contingent and compelling, Street argues that the\nfact that moral commitments are contingent does not weaken their\nnormative force. The latter claim has been disputed on the ground that\nthe driving force of love should be distinguished from its normative\nauthority (Bratman 2012).\n\nHumean constructivism has established itself as a prominent variety of\nmetaethics, which avoids any commitment to moral realism. In\n section 6\n we will consider how this form of constructivism relates to\nanti-realism and expressivism.\n",
