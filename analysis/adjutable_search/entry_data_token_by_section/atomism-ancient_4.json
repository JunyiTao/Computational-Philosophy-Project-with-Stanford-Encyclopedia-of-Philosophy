    "main_text": "Ancient Greek Atomism\n2. Ancient Greek Atomism\n\nAncient Greek atomists developed a systematic and comprehensive\nnatural philosophy accounting for the origins of everything from the\ninteraction of indivisible bodies, as these atoms\u2014which have\nonly a few intrinsic properties like size and shape\u2014strike\nagainst one another, rebound and interlock in an infinite void. In\nboth its Democritean and its Epicurean versions, Greek atomism\neschewed teleological explanation and denied divine intervention or\ndesign, regarding every composite of atoms as produced purely by\nmaterial interactions of bodies, and accounting for the perceived\nproperties of macroscopic bodies as produced by these same atomic\ninteractions. Ancient Greek atomists formulated views on ethics,\ntheology, political philosophy and epistemology consistent with this\nphysical system. This powerful and consistent materialism was regarded\nby Aristotle as a chief competitor to teleological natural philosophy;\nfollowing his criticisms, the theory was reformulated by Epicurus and\nhad a second life as the philosophy of a school devoted to the pursuit\nof tranquillity and a communal life of simple pleasures.\n",
