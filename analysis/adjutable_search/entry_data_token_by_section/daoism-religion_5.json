    "main_text": "Origins of Daoist Religion || \u201cFar Roaming\u201d\n2.2 \u201cFar Roaming\u201d\n\nSome scholars have suggested that \u201cshamanism\u201d is related\nto another theme developed by later Daoist traditions: the \u201cfar\nroaming\u201d (yuanyou), or imaginary journeys to the\nextremities of the world or to the farthest regions of the cosmos\n(Kohn 1992: 96\u2013104). Best known among these accounts is the\n\u201cYuanyou\u201d (Far Roaming) poem, dating from the\n2nd century BCE (Kroll 1996). Here the author describes an\n\u201cecstatic journey\u201d during which he visits the remotest\nregions of the earth, encounters realized beings, ascends to celestial\npalaces, and finally enters the realm of the Great Beginning\n(taichu). Later Daoist traditions have used the \u201cfar\nroaming\u201d imagery in different contexts: breathing techniques for\nthe absorption of the pure energies (qi) found at the\nboundaries of the cosmos, meditation practices that involve walking on\nconstellations in the heavens, and accounts of initiatory journeys to\nthe four directions of the world made by saints and immortals, who\nfind texts and receive teachings from divine beings (see\n \u00a79.3).\n",
