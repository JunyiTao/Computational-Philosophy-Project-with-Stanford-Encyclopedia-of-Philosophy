    "main_text": "The Official Doctrine and its contemporary offshoots || The epistemological and semantic commitments\n6.2 The epistemological and semantic commitments\n\nThe ontological commitments of the Official Doctrine lead to the\nmind-body problem; the epistemological commitments of the Official\nDoctrine lead to the problem of other minds. According to the\ntraditional view, bodily processes are external and can be witnessed\nby observers, but mental processes are private, \u201cinternal\u201d\nas it is metaphorically described (since mental processes are not\nsupposed to be locatable anywhere). Mental processes or events are\nsupposed, on the official view, to be played out in a private theatre;\nsuch events are known directly by the person who has them either\nthrough the faculty of introspection or the\n\u201cphosphorescence\u201d of consciousness. The subject of the\nmental states is, on this view, incorrigible\u2014her avowals of her\nown mental states cannot be corrected by others\u2014and she is\ninfallible\u2014she cannot be wrong about which states she is\n in.[6]\n Others can know them only indirectly through \u201ccomplex and frail\ninferences\u201d from what the body does.\n\nBut if all that is mental is to be understood in this way, it is\nunclear how we are justified in believing that others have the\nrequisite episodes or mental accompaniments. It would be possible, on\nthis view, for others to act as if they are minded, but for them to\nhave none of the right \u201cconscious experiences\u201d\naccompanying their actions for them to qualify as such. Perhaps we are\nin much the same position as Descartes who thought it made sense to\nwonder whether such creatures are automata instead.\n\nThe problem of other minds is compounded by even more serious\ndifficulties given certain assumptions about the way language works.\nProponents of the Official Doctrine are committed to the view that\nmental discourse serves to designate items that carry the metaphysical\nand epistemological load of that doctrine.\n\nThe verbs, nouns and adjectives, with which in ordinary life we\ndescribe the wits, characters and higher-grade performances of the\npeople with whom we have do, are required to be construed as\nsignifying special episodes in their secret histories, or else as\nsignifying tendencies for such episodes to occur. (1949a, 16\u201317)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s criticism of the Official Doctrine begins by pointing out\nan absurdity in its semantic consequences. If mental conduct verbs\npick out \u201coccult\u201d causes then we would not be able to\napply those verbs as we do; so something must be wrong with a theory\nof mental phenomena that renders so inadequate our everyday use of\nthese verbs. For, according to the Official Doctrine\n\nwhen someone is described as knowing, believing or guessing something,\nas hoping, dreading, intending or shirking something, as designing\nthis or being amused at that, these verbs are supposed to denote the\noccurrence of specific modifications in his (to us) occult stream of\nconsciousness. (1945, 17)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s criticism of the view is that if it were correct, only\nprivileged access to this stream of consciousness could provide\nauthentic testimony that these mental-conduct verbs were correctly or\nincorrectly applied. \u201cThe onlooker, be he teacher, critic,\nbiographer or friend, can never assure himself that his comments have\nany vestige of truth.\u201d And yet,\n\nit was just because we do in fact all know how to make such comments,\nmake them with general correctness and correct them when they turn out\nto be confused or mistaken, that philosophers found it necessary to\nconstruct their theories of the nature and place of minds. Finding\nmental-conduct concepts being regularly and effectively used, they\nproperly sought to fix their logical geography. But the account\nofficially recommended would entail that there could be no regular or\neffective use of these mental-conduct concepts in our descriptions of,\nand prescriptions for, other people\u2019s minds. (1949a, 17)\n\n\nRyle is often given credit for having shown some of the many\ndifficulties in substance or Cartesian dualism. But the arguments in\nThe Concept of Mind warn of difficulties for any account that\ntakes mental conduct terms to discharge their explanatory role by\nsignifying inner processes: whether irreducibly mental or at bottom\nphysical. Ryle\u2019s target was not merely the ghostliness of the\nmental processes hypothesized by the Cartesian; it was their essential\nhidden-ness. The thrust of Ryle\u2019s polemic is that theories about\nthe nature of the alleged referents of the mental concepts we employ\nin our ordinary everyday commonsense practices cannot make a mystery\nof this employment without threatening to rob the theories of their\nsubject matter. Our practice of employing such mental concepts would\nbe a complete mystery on a view that takes the\n\u201ctruth-makers\u201d of our mental statements to be not only\nitems within an occult (to others) stream of consciousness, but also\non a view that takes them to be items within an occult (to most of us)\nseries of computations or neurological events. Both picture the\ntruth-makers of our claims about other minds or our ascriptions of\nmental predicates as hidden and thus in practice (if not in principle)\nas inaccessible.\n",
