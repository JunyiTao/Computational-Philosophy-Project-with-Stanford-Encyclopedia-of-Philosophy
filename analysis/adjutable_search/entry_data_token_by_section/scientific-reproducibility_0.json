    "main_text": "Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results\n1. Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results\n\nA starting point in any philosophical exploration of reproducibility\nand related notions is to consider the conceptual question of what\nsuch notions mean. According to some (e.g., Cartwright 1991), the\nterms \u201creplication\u201d, \u201creproduction\u201d and\n\u201crepetition\u201d denote distinct concepts, while others use\nthese terms interchangeably (e.g., Atmanspacher & Maasen 2016a).\nDifferent disciplines can have different understandings of these terms\ntoo. In computational disciplines, for example,\nreproducibility often refers to the ability to reproduce\ncomputations alone, that is, it relates exclusively to sharing and\nsufficiently annotating data and code (e.g., Peng 2011, 2015). In\nthose disciplines, replication describes the redoing of whole\nexperiments (Barba 2017, Other Internet Resources). In psychology and\nother social and life\nsciences, however, reproducibility may refer to either the\nredoing of computations, or the redoing of experiments. The\nReproducibility Projects, coordinated by the Center for Open Science,\nredo entire studies, data collection and analysis. A recent funding\nprogram announcement by DARPA (US Defense Advanced Research Programs\nAgency) distinguished between reproducibility and replicability, where\nthe former refers to computational reproducibility and the latter to\nthe redoing of experiments. Here we use all three\nterms\u2014\u201creplication\u201d, \u201creproduction\u201d and\n\u201crepetition\u201d\u2014interchangeably, unless explicitly\ndescribing the distinctions of other authors.\n\nWhen describing a study as \u201creplicable\u201d, people could have\nin mind either of at least two different things. The first is that the\nstudy is replicable in principle the sense that it can be\ncarried out again, particularly when its methods, procedures and\nanalysis are described in a sufficiently detailed and transparent way.\nThe second is that the study is replicable in that sense that it can\nbe carried out again and, when this happens, the replication study\nwill successfully produce the same or sufficiently\nsimilar results as the original. A study may be replicable in the\nformer sense but not in the second sense: one might be able to\nreplicate the methods, procedures and analysis of a study, but fail to\nsuccessfully replicate the results of the original study. Similarly,\nwhen people talk of a \u201creplication\u201d, they could also have\nin mind two different things: the replication of the methods,\nprocedures and analysis of a study (irrespective of the results) or,\nalternatively, the replication of such methods, procedures and\nanalysis as well as the results.\n\nArguably, most typologies of replication make more or less\nfine-grained distinctions between direct replication (which\nclosely follow the original study to verify results) and\nconceptual replications (which deliberately alter important\nfeatures of the study to generalize findings or to test the underlying\nhypothesis in a new way). As suggested, this distinction may not\nalways be known by these terms. For example, roughly the same\ndistinction is referred to as exact and inexact\nreplication by Keppel (1982); concrete and\nconceptual replication by Sargent (1981), and literal,\noperational and constructive replication by Lykken (1968).\nComputational reproducibility is most often direct (reproducing\nparticular analysis outcomes from the same data set using the same\ncode and software), but it can also be conceptual (analysing the same\nraw data set with alternative approaches, different models or\nstatistical frameworks). For an example of a conceptual computational\nreproducibility study, see Silberzahn and Uhlmann 2015.\n\nWe do not attempt to resolve these disciplinary differences or to\ncreate a new typology of replication, and instead we will provide a\nlimited snapshot of the conceptual terrain by surveying three existing\ntypologies\u2014from Stefan Schmidt (2009), from Omar G\u00f3mez,\nNatalia Juristo, and Sira Vegas (2010) and from Hans Radder.\nSchmidt\u2019s account has been influential and widely-cited in\npsychology and social sciences, where the replication crisis\nliterature is heavily concentrated. G\u00f3mez, Juristo, and\nVegas\u2019s (2010) typology of replication is based on a\nmultidisciplinary survey of over 18 scholarly classifications of\nreplication studies which collectively contain more than 79 types of\nreplication. Finally, Radder\u2019s (1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012)\ntypology is perhaps best known within philosophy of science\nitself.\n",
