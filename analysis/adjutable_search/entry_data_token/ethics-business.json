One entity (e.g., a person, a firm)\n\u201cdoes business\u201d with another when it exchanges a good or\nservice for valuable consideration, i.e., a benefit such as money.\n\u2018Business\u2019 can also mean an entity that offers goods and\nservices for exchange, i.e., that sells things. Target is a business.\nBusiness ethics can thus be understood as the study of the ethical\ndimensions of the exchange of goods and services, and of the entities\nthat offer goods and services for exchange. This includes related\nactivities such as the production, distribution, marketing, sale, and\nconsumption of goods and services (cf. Donaldson & Walsh 2015;\nMarcoux 2006b).\n\nQuestions in business ethics are important and relevant to everyone.\nAlmost all of us \u201cdo business\u201d, or engage in a commercial\ntransaction, almost every day. Many of us spend a major portion of our\nlives engaged in, or preparing to engage in, exchange activities, on\nour own or as part of organizations. Business activity shapes the\nworld we live in, sometimes for good and sometimes for ill.\n\nBusiness ethics in its current incarnation is a relatively new field,\ngrowing out of research by moral philosophers in the 1970\u2019s and\n1980\u2019s. But scholars have been thinking about the ethical\ndimensions of commerce at least since the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1750\nBC).\n\nThis entry summarizes research on central questions in business\nethics, including: What sorts of things can be sold? How can they be\nsold? In whose interests should firms be managed? Who should manage\nthem? What do firms owe their workers, and what do workers owe their\nfirms? Should firms try to solve social problems? Is it permissible\nfor them to try to influence political outcomes? Given the vastness of\nthe field, of necessity certain questions are not addressed.\n", "toc": [{"#VariBusiEthi": "1. Varieties of business ethics"}, {"#CorpMoraAgen": "2.

Varieties of business ethics\n\nMany people engaged in business activity, including accountants and\nlawyers, are professionals. As such, they are bound by codes of\nconduct promulgated by professional societies. Many firms also have\ndetailed codes of conduct, developed and enforced by teams of ethics\nand compliance personnel. Business ethics can thus be understood as\nthe study of professional practices, i.e., as the study of the\ncontent, development, enforcement, and effectiveness of the codes of\nconduct designed to guide the actions of people engaged in business\nactivity. This entry will not consider this form of business ethics.\nInstead, it considers business ethics as an academic discipline.\n\nThe academic field of business ethics is shared by social scientists\nand normative theorists. But they address different questions. Social\nscientists try to answer descriptive questions like: Does corporate\nsocial performance improve corporate financial performance, i.e., does\nethics pay (Vogel 2005; Zhao & Murrell 2021)? Why do people engage\nin unethical behavior (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel 2011; Werhane et al.\n2013). How can we make them stop (Warren, Gaspar, & Laufer 2014)?\nI will not consider such questions here. This entry focuses on\nquestions in normative business ethics, most of which are variants on\nthe question: What is ethical and unethical in business?\n\nNormative business ethicists (hereafter the qualifier\n\u2018normative\u2019 will be assumed) tend to accept the basic\nelements of capitalism. That is, they assume that the means of\nproduction can be privately owned and that markets\u2014featuring\nvoluntary exchanges between buyers and sellers at mutually agreeable\nprices\u2014should play an important role in the allocation of\nresources. Those who reject capitalism will see some debates in\nbusiness ethics (e.g., about firm ownership and control) as\nmisguided.\n\nSome entities \u201cdo business\u201d with the goal of making a\nprofit, and some do not. Pfizer and Target are examples of the former;\nRutgers University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are examples of\nthe latter. An organization identified as a \u2018business\u2019 is\ntypically understood to be one that seeks profit, and for-profit\norganizations are the ones that business ethicists focus on. But many\nof the ethical issues described below arise also for non-profit\norganizations and individual economic agents.\n2. Corporate moral agency\n\nOne way to think about business ethics is in terms of the moral\nobligations of agents engaged in business activity. Who can be a moral\nagent? Individual persons, obviously. What about firms? This is\ntreated as the issue of \u201ccorporate moral agency\u201d or\n\u201ccorporate moral responsibility\u201d. Here\n\u2018corporate\u2019 does not refer to the corporation as a legal\nentity, but to a collective or group of individuals. To be precise,\nthe question is whether firms are moral agents and morally responsible\nconsidered as (qua) firms, not considered as aggregates of\nindividual members of firms.\n\nWe often think and speak as if corporations are morally responsible.\nWe say things like \u201cCostco treats its employees well\u201d or\n\u201cBP harmed the environment in the Gulf of Mexico\u201d, and in\ndoing so we appear to assign agency and responsibility to firms\nthemselves (Dempsey 2003). We may wish to praise Costco and blame BP\nfor their behavior. But this may be just a metaphorical way of\nspeaking, or a shorthand way of referring to certain individuals who\nwork in these firms (Velasquez 1983, 2003). Corporations are different\nin many ways from paradigm moral agents, viz., people. They\ndon\u2019t have minds, for one thing, or bodies, for another. The\nquestion is whether corporations are similar enough to people to\nwarrant ascriptions of moral agency and responsibility.\n\nIn the business ethics literature, French is a seminal thinker on this\ntopic. In early work (1979, 1984), he argued that firms are morally\nresponsible for what they do, and indeed should be seen as\n\u201cfull-fledged\u201d moral persons. He bases this conclusion on\nhis claim that firms have internal decision-making structures, through\nwhich they cause events to happen, and act intentionally. Some early\nresponses to French\u2019s work accepted the claim that firms are\nmoral agents, but denied that they are moral persons. Donaldson (1982)\nclaims that firms cannot be persons because they lack important human\ncapacities, such as the ability to pursue their own happiness (see\nalso Werhane 1985). Other responses went further and denied that firms\nare moral agents. Velasquez (1983, 2003) argues that, while\ncorporations can act, they cannot be held responsible for their\nactions, because those actions are brought about by the actions of\ntheir members. In later work, French (1995) recanted his claim that\nfirms are moral persons, though not his claim that they are moral\nagents.\n\nDebate about corporate moral agency and moral responsibility rages on\nin important new work (Orts & Smith 2017; Sepinwall 2016). One\nissue that has received sustained attention is choice. Appealing to\ndiscursive dilemmas, List & Pettit (2011) argue that the decisions\nof corporations can be independent of the decisions of their members\n(see also Copp 2006). This makes the corporation an autonomous agent,\nand since it can choose in the light of values, a morally responsible\none. Another issue is intention. A minimal condition of moral agency\nis the ability to form intentions. Some deny that corporations can\nform them (S. Miller 2006; R\u00f6nnegard 2015). If we regard an\nintention as a mental state, akin to a belief or desire, or a\nbelief/desire complex, they may be right. But not if we regard an\nintention in functionalist terms (Copp 2006; Hess 2014), as a plan\n(Bratman 1993), or in terms of reasons-responsiveness (Silver\nforthcoming). A third issue is emotion. Sepinwall (2017) argues that\nbeing capable of emotion is a necessary condition of moral\nresponsibility, and since corporations aren\u2019t capable of\nemotion, they aren\u2019t morally responsible. Again, much depends on\nwhat it means to be capable of emotion. If this capability can be\ngiven a functionalist reading, as Bj\u00f6rnsson & Hess (2017)\nclaim, perhaps corporations are capable of emotion (see also Gilbert\n2000). Pursuit of these issues lands one in the robust and\nsophisticated literature on collective responsibility and\nintentionality, where firms feature as a type of collective. (See the\nentries on\n collective responsibility,\n collective intentionality, and\n shared agency.)\n\nAnother question asked about corporate moral agency is: Does it\nmatter? Perhaps BP itself was morally responsible for polluting the\nGulf of Mexico. Perhaps certain individuals at BP were. What hangs on\nthis? Some say: a lot. In some cases there may be no individual who is\nmorally responsible for the firm\u2019s behavior (List & Pettit\n2011; Phillips 1995), and we need someone to blame, and perhaps\npunish. Blame may be the fitting response, and blame (and punishment)\nincentivizes the firm to change its behavior. Hasnas (2012) says very\nlittle hangs on this question. Even if firms are not morally\nresponsible for the harms they cause, we can still require them to pay\nrestitution, condemn their culture, and subject them to regulation.\nMoreover, Hasnas says, we should not blame and punish firms, for our\nblame and punishment inevitably lands on the innocent.\n3. The ends and means of corporate governance\n\nThere is significant debate about the ends and means of corporate\ngovernance, i.e., about who firms should be managed for, and who\nshould (ultimately) manage them. Much of this debate is carried on\nwith the large publicly-traded corporation in view.\n3.1 Ends: shareholder primacy or stakeholder balance?\n\nThere are two main views about the proper ends of corporate\ngovernance. According to one view, firms should be managed in the best\ninterests of shareholders. It is typically assumed that managing firms\nin shareholders\u2019 best interests requires maximizing their wealth\n(cf. Hart & Zingales 2017; Robson 2019). This view is called\n\u201cshareholder primacy\u201d (Stout 2012) or\u2014in order to\ncontrast it more directly with its main rival (to be discussed below)\n\u201cshareholder theory\u201d. Shareholder primacy is the dominant\nview about the ends of corporate governance in business schools and in\nthe business world.\n\nA few writers argue for shareholder primacy on deontological grounds,\ni.e., by appealing to rights and duties. On this argument,\nshareholders own the firm, and hire managers to run it for them on the\ncondition that the firm is managed in their interests. Shareholder\nprimacy is thus based on a promise that managers make to shareholders\n(Friedman 1970; Hasnas 1998). In response, some argue that\nshareholders do not own the firm. They own stock, a type of corporate\nsecurity (Bainbridge 2008; Stout 2012); the firm itself may be unowned\n(Strudler 2017). Others argue that managers do not make, explicitly or\nimplicitly, any promises to shareholders to manage the firm in a\ncertain way (Boatright 1994). More writers argue for shareholder\nprimacy on consequentialist grounds. On this argument, managing firms\nin the interests of shareholders is more efficient than managing them\nin any other way (Hansmann & Kraakman 2001; Jensen 2002). In\nsupport of this, some argue that, if managers are not given a single\nobjective that is clear and measurable\u2014viz., maximizing\nshareholder value\u2014then they will have greater opportunity for\nself-dealing (Stout 2012). The consequentialist argument for\nshareholder primacy run into problems that afflict many versions of\nconsequentialism: in requiring all firms to aim at a certain\nobjective, it does not allow sufficient scope for personal choice\n(Hussain 2012). Most think that people should be able to pursue\nprojects, including economic projects, that matter to them, even if\nthose projects do not maximize shareholder value.\n\nThe second main view about the proper ends of corporate governance is\ngiven by stakeholder theory. This theory was first put forward by\nFreeman in the 1980s (Freeman 1984; Freeman & Reed 1983), and has\nbeen refined by Freeman and collaborators over the years (see, e.g.,\nFreeman 1994; Freeman et al. 2010; Freeman, Harrison, &\nZyglidopoulos 2018; Jones, Wicks, & Freeman 2002; Phillips,\nFreeman, & Wicks 2003). According to stakeholder theory\u2014or\nat least, early formulations of it\u2014instead of managing the firm\nin the best interests of shareholders only, managers should seek to\n\u201cbalance\u201d the interests of all stakeholders, where a\nstakeholder is anyone who has a \u201cstake\u201d, or interest\n(including a financial interest), in the firm. Blair and Stout\u2019s\n(1999) \u201cteam production\u201d theory of corporate governance\noffers similar guidance.\n\nTo be clear, in a firm in which shareholders\u2019 interests are\nprioritized, other stakeholders will benefit too. Employees will\nreceive wages, customers will receive goods and services, and so on.\nThe debate between shareholder and stakeholder theorists is about what\nto do with the residual revenues, i.e., what\u2019s left over after\nfirms meet their contractual obligations to employees, customers, and\nothers. Shareholder theorists think they should be used to maximize\nshareholder wealth. Stakeholder theorists think they should be used to\nbenefit all stakeholders.\n\nTo its critics, stakeholder theory has seemed both incompletely\narticulated and weakly defended. With respect to articulation, one\nquestion that has been pressed is: Who are the stakeholders (Orts\n& Strudler 2002, 2009)? The groups most commonly identified are\nshareholders, employees, the community, suppliers, and customers. But\nother groups have stakes in the firm, including creditors, the\ngovernment, and competitors. It makes a great deal of difference where\nthe line is drawn, but stakeholder theorists have not provided a clear\nrationale for drawing it in one place rather than another. Another\nquestion is: What does it mean to \u201cbalance\u201d the interests\nof all stakeholders, other than not always giving precedence to\nshareholders\u2019 interests (Orts & Strudler 2009)? With respect\nto defense, critics have wondered what the rationale is for managing\nfirms in the interests of all stakeholders. In one place, Freeman\n(1984) offers an instrumental argument, claiming that balancing\nstakeholders\u2019 interests is better for the firm strategically\nthan maximizing shareholder wealth (see also Blair & Stout 1999;\nFreeman, Harrison, & Zyglidopoulos 2018). (Defenders of\nshareholder primacy say the same thing about their view.) In another,\nhe gives an argument that appeals to Rawls\u2019s justice as fairness\n(Evan & Freeman 1988; cf. Child & Marcoux 1999).\n\nIn recent years, questions have been raised about whether stakeholder\ntheory is appropriately seen as a genuine competitor to shareholder\nprimacy, or is even appropriately called a \u201ctheory\u201d. In\none article, Freeman and collaborators say that stakeholder theory is\nsimply \u201cthe body of research \u2026 in which the idea of\n\u2018stakeholders\u2019 plays a crucial role\u201d (Jones et al.\n2002). In another, Freeman describes stakeholder theory as \u201ca\ngenre of stories about how we could live\u201d (1994: 413). It may\nbe, as Norman (2013) says, that stakeholder is now best regarded as\n\u201cmindset\u201d, i.e., a way of looking at the firm that\nemphasizes its embeddedness in a network of relationships. In this\ncase, there may be no dispute between shareholder and stakeholder\ntheorists.\n\nResolving the debate between shareholder and stakeholder theorists\n(assuming they are competitors) will not resolve all or even most of\nthe ethical questions in business. This is because it is a debate\nabout the ends of corporate governance. It cannot answer\nquestions about the moral constraints that must be observed\nin pursuit of those ends (Goodpaster 1991; Norman 2013), including\nduties of beneficence (Mejia 2020). Neither shareholder theory nor\nstakeholder theory is plausibly interpreted as the view that corporate\nmanagers should do whatever is possible to maximize\nshareholder wealth and balance all stakeholders\u2019 interests,\nrespectively. Rather, these views should be interpreted as views that\nmanagers should do whatever is consistent with the requirements of\nmorality to achieve these ends. A large part of business ethics\nis trying to determine what these requirements are.\n3.2 Means: control by shareholders or others too?\n\nAnswers to questions about the means of corporate governance often\nmirror answers to question about the ends of corporate governance.\nOften the best way to ensure that a firm is managed in the interests\nof a certain party P is to give P control. Conversely, justifications\nfor why the firm should be managed in the interests of P sometimes\nappeal P\u2019s rights to control it.\n\nFriedman (1970), for example, thinks that shareholders\u2019\nownership of the firm gives them a right to control the firm (which\nthey can use to ensure that the firm is run in their interests). We\nmight see control rights for shareholders as following analytically\nfrom the concept of ownership. To own a thing is to have a bundle of\nrights with respect to that thing. One of the standard\n\u201cincidents\u201d of ownership is control. (See the entry on\n property and ownership.)\n\nAs noted, in recent years the idea that the firm is something that can\nbe owned has been challenged (Bainbridge 2008; Stout 2012; Strudler\n2017). If this is right, then the ownership argument collapses. But\nsimilar contractarian arguments for shareholder control of firms have\nbeen constructed which do not rely on the assumption of firm\nownership. All that is assumed in these arguments is that some people\nown capital, and others own labor. Capital can \u201chire\u201d\nlabor (and other inputs of production) or labor can \u201chire\u201d\ncapital. It just so happens that, in most cases, capital hires labor.\nWe know this because in most cases capital-providers are the ultimate\ndecision-makers in the firm. In a publicly-traded corporation, they\nelect the board. These points are emphasized especially by those who\nregard the firm as a \u201cnexus of contracts\u201d among various\nparties (Easterbrook & Fischel 1996; Jensen & Meckling\n1976).\n\nMany writers find this result troubling. Even if the governance\nstructure in most firms is in some sense agreed to, they say that it\nis unjust in other ways. Anderson (2017) characterizes standard\ncorporate governance regimes as oppressive and unaccountable private\ndictatorships. To address this injustice, these writers call for\nvarious forms of worker participation in managerial decision-making,\nincluding the ability by workers to reject arbitrary directives by\nmanagers (Hsieh 2005), worker co-determination of firms\u2019\npolicies and practices (Ferreras 2017; McMahon 1994), and exclusive\ncontrol of productive enterprises by workers (Dahl 1985).\n\nArguments for these governance structures take various forms. One\nappeals to the value of protecting workers\u2019 interests\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Ricoy 2014; Hsieh 2005). Another appeals to the value\nof autonomy, or a right to freely determine one\u2019s actions,\nincluding one\u2019s actions at work (Malleson 2014; McCall 2001). A\nthird argument for worker control is the \u201cparallel case\u201d\nargument. According to it, if states should be governed\ndemocratically, then so should firms, because firms are like states in\nthe relevant respects (Dahl 1985; Landemore & Ferreras 2016; cf.\nMayer 2000). A fourth argument sees worker participation in firm\ndecision-making as valuable training for citizens in a democratic\nsociety (Pateman 1970).\n\nSpace considerations prevent detailed examinations of these arguments\n(for critical reviews see Frega, Herzog, & Neuh\u00e4user 2019;\nHsieh 2008). But criticisms generally fall into two categories. The\nfirst insists on the normative priority of agreements, of the sort\ndescribed above. There are few legal restrictions on the types of\ngovernance structures that firms can have. And some firms are in fact\ncontrolled by workers (Dow 2003; Hansmann 1996). To insist that other\nfirms should be governed this way is to say, according to this\nargument, that people should not be allowed to arrange their economic\nlives as they see fit. Another criticism of worker participation\nappeals to efficiency. Allowing workers to participate in managerial\ndecision-making may decrease the pace of decision-making, since it\nrequires giving many workers a chance to make their voices heard\n(Hansmann 1996). It may also raise the cost of capital for firms, as\ninvestors may demand more favorable terms if they are not given\ncontrol of the enterprise in return (McMahon 1994). Both sources of\ninefficiency may put the firm at a significant disadvantage in a\ncompetitive market. It may not just be a matter of competitive\ndisadvantage. If it were, the problem could be solved by making all\nfirms worker-controlled. The problem may be one of diminished\nproductivity more generally.\n4. Important frameworks for business ethics\n\nBusiness\n ethicists seek to understand the ethical contours of business\nactivity. One way of advancing this project is by choosing a normative\nframework and teasing out its implications for business issues. In\nprinciple, it is possible to do this for any normative framework.\nBelow are four that have received significant attention.\n\nOne influential approach to business ethics draws on virtue ethics.\nMoore (2017) develops and applies MacIntyre\u2019s (1984) virtue\nethics to business. For MacIntyre, there are goods internal to\npractices, and certain virtues are necessary to achieve those goods.\nBuilding on MacIntyre, Moore develops the idea that business is a\npractice (or contains practices), and thus has certain goods internal\nto it (or them), the attainment of which requires the cultivation of\nbusiness virtues. Aristotelian approaches to virtue in business are\nfound in Alzola (2012) and de Bruin (2015). Scholars have also been\ninspired by the Aristotelian idea that the good life is achieved in a\ncommunity (Sison & Fontrodona 2012), and have considered how\nbusiness communities must be structured to help their members flourish\n(Hartman 2015; Solomon 1993).\n\nAnother important approach to the study of business ethics comes from\ndeontology, especially Kant\u2019s version (Arnold & Bowie 2003;\nBowie 2017; Scharding 2015; Hughes 2020). Kant\u2019s claim that\nhumanity should be treated always as an end, and never as a means\nonly, has proved especially fruitful for analyzing the human\ninteractions at the core of commercial transactions. In competitive\nmarkets, people may be tempted to deceive, cheat, use, exploit, or\nmanipulate others to gain an edge. Kantian moral theory singles out\nthese actions out as violations of human dignity (Hughes 2019; Smith\n& Dubbink 2011).\n\nEthical theory, including virtue theory and deontology, is useful for\nthinking about how individuals should relate to each other. But\nbusiness ethics also comprehends the laws and regulations that\nstructure markets and firms. Here political theory seems more\nrelevant. A number of business ethicists have sought to identify the\nimplications of Rawls\u2019s (1971) justice as fairness for business.\nThis is not an easy task, since while Rawls makes some suggestive\nremarks about markets and firms, he does not articulate specific\nconclusions or develop detailed arguments for them. But scholars have\nargued that justice as fairness: (1) is incompatible with significant\ninequalities of power and authority within firms (S. Arnold 2012); (2)\nrequires people to have an opportunity to perform meaningful work\n(Moriarty 2009; cf. Hasan 2015); and requires alternative forms of (3)\ncorporate governance (Berkey 2021; Blanc & Al-Amoudi 2013; Norman\n2015; cf. Singer 2015) and (4) corporate ownership (M. O\u2019Neill\n& Williamson 2012).\n\nA fourth approach to business ethics is called the \u201cmarket\nfailures approach\u201d (MFA). It originates with McMahon (1981), but\nit has been developed in most detail by Heath (2014) (for discussion\nsee Moriarty 2020 and Singer 2018). According to Heath, the\njustification of the market is that it produces efficient\u2014in the\nsense of Pareto-optimal\u2014 outcomes. But this only happens when\nthe conditions of perfect competition obtain, such as perfect\ninformation, no market power, and no barriers to entry or exit. (When\nthey don\u2019t, markets fail\u2014hence the market failures\napproach.) On the MFA, these conditions are the source of ethical\nrules for market actors. The MFA says that market actors, including\nsellers and buyers, should not create or take advantage of market\nimperfections. So, for example, firms should not deceive consumers\n(creating information asymmetries) or lobby governments to levy\ntariffs on foreign competitors (erecting barriers to entry).\n\nSelecting a normative framework and applying it to a range of issues\nis an important way of doing business ethics. But it is not the only\nway. Indeed, the more common approach is to identify a business\nactivity and then analyze it using \u201cmid-level\u201d principles\nor ideals common to many moral and political theories. Below I\nconsider ethical issues that arise at the nexus of firms\u2019\nengagement with three important groups: consumers, employees, and\nsociety.\n5. Firms and consumers\n\nThe main way that firms interact with consumers is by selling, or\nattempting to sell, products and services to them. Many ethical issues\nattend this interaction.\n5.1 The limits of markets\n\nMany have argued that some things should not be for sale (Anderson\n1993; MacDonald & Gavura 2016; Sandel 2012; Satz 2010). Among the\nthings commonly said to be inappropriate for sale are sexual services,\nsurrogacy services, and human organs. Some writers object to markets\nin these items for consequentialist reasons. They argue that markets\nin commodities like sex and kidneys will lead to the exploitation of\nvulnerable people (Satz 2010). Others object to the attitudes or\nvalues expressed in such markets. They claim that markets in surrogacy\nservices express the attitude that women are mere vessels for the\nincubation of children (Anderson 1993); markets in kidneys suggest\nthat human life can be bought and sold (Sandel 2012); and so on. (For\na discussion of what it might mean for a market to\n\u201cexpress\u201d a value, see Jonker [2019].)\n\nOther writers criticize these arguments, and in general, the attempt\nto \u201cwall-off\u201d certain goods and services from markets.\nBrennan and Jaworksi (2016) object to expressive or\n\u201csemiotic\u201d arguments against markets in contested\ncommodities (cf. Brown & Maguire 2019). Whether selling a\nparticular thing for money expresses disrespect, they note, is\nculturally contingent. They and others (e.g., Taylor 2005) also argue\nthat the bad effects of markets in contested commodities can be\neliminated or at least ameliorated through appropriate regulation, and\nthat anyway, the good effects of such markets (e.g., a decrease in the\nnumber of people who die because they are waiting for a kidney)\noutweigh the bad.\n5.2 Product safety and liability\n\nSome things that firms may wish to sell, and that people may wish to\nbuy, pose a significant risk of harm, to the user and others. When is\na product too unsafe to be sold? This question is often answered by\ngovernment agencies. In the U.S., a number of government agencies,\nincluding the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), are responsible for assessing the safety of\nproducts for the consumer market. In some cases these standards are\nmandatory (e.g., medicines and medical devices); in other cases they\nare voluntary (e.g., trampolines and tents). The state identifies\nminimum standards and individual businesses can choose to adopt more\nstringent ones.\n\nQuestions about product safety are a matter of significant debate\namong economists, legal scholars, and public policy experts. Business\nethicists have paid scant attention to these questions (but see\nBrenkert 1981). Existing treatments often combine discussions of\nsafety with discussions of liability\u2014the question of who should\npay for harms that products cause\u2014and tend to be found in\nbusiness ethics textbooks. One of the most careful treatments is\nVelasquez\u2019s (2012). He distinguishes three (compatible) views:\n(1) the \u201ccontract view\u201d, according to which the\nmanufacturer\u2019s duty is only to accurately disclose all risks\nassociated with the product; (2) the \u201cdue care view\u201d,\naccording to which the manufacturer should exercise due care to\nprevent buyers from being injured by the product; and (3) the\n\u201csocial costs view\u201d, according to which the manufacturer\nshould pay for any injuries the product causes, even if the\nmanufacturer has accurately disclosed all risks associated with the\nproduct and has exercised due care to prevent injury (see also\nBoatright & Smith 2017). In the U.S. and elsewhere, the law has\nmoved in the direction of the social costs view, where it is known as\n\u201cstrict liability\u201d.\n\nThere is much room for philosophical exploration of these issues. One\narea that merits attention is the definitions of key terms, such as\n\u201csafety\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d. Drop side cribs pose\nrisks to consumers; so do trampolines. On what basis should the former\nbe prohibited but the latter not be (Hasnas 2010)? The answer must\ntake into account the value of these products, how obvious the risks\nthey pose are, and the availability of substitutes. With respect to\nliability, we may wonder whether it is fair to hold manufacturers\nresponsible for harms their products cause, when the manufacturers are\nnot morally at fault for those harms. On the other hand, it may be\nunfair to force consumers to bear the full costs of their injuries,\nwhen they too are not morally at fault. The question may be one for\nsociety as a whole: what is the most efficient or just way to\ndistribute these costs?\n5.3 Advertising\n\nMost advertising contains both an informational component and a\npersuasive component. Advertisements tell us something about a\nproduct, and try to persuade us to buy it. Both of these components\ncan be subject to ethical evaluation.\n\nEmphasizing its informational component, some writers stress the\npositive value of advertising. Markets function efficiently only when\ncertain conditions are met. One of these conditions is perfect\ninformation. Minimally, consumers have to understand the features of\nthe products for sale. While this condition will never be fully met,\nadvertising can help to ensure that it is met to a greater degree\n(Heath 2014). Another value that can be promoted through advertising\nis autonomy. People have certain needs and desires\u2014e.g., to eat\nhealthy food, to drive a safe car\u2014which their choices as\nconsumers help them to satisfy. Their choices are more likely to\nsatisfy their needs and desires if they have information about what is\nfor sale, which advertising can provide (Goldman 1984).\n\nThese good effects depend, of course, on advertisements producing true\nbeliefs, or at least not producing false beliefs, in consumers.\nWriters treat this as the issue of deception in advertising. The issue\nis not whether deceptive advertising is wrong (most would agree it\nis), but what counts as deceptive advertising, and what makes it\nwrong.\n\nIn the 1980s, Beech-Nut advertised as \u201c100% apple juice\u201d a\ndrink that contained no juice of any kind. Beech-Nut was fined $2\nmillion and two of its executives went to prison. As of this writing\n(in 2021), Red Bull is marketing its energy drinks with the slogan\n\u201cRed Bull Gives You Wings,\u201d but in fact Red Bull\ndoesn\u2019t give you wings. There is no problem with Red\nBull\u2019s marketing. What\u2019s the difference? We might say that\nRed Bull\u2019s slogan is not warranted as true (Carson 2010). It is\nan example of \u201cpuffery,\u201d or over-the-top, exaggerated\npraise which no reasonable person takes seriously (Attas 1999). By\ncontrast, Beech-Nut\u2019s statement appeared to be a claim meant to\nbe taken at face value, but in fact is false. As these examples\nillustrate, advertisements are deceptive not because of the\ntruth-value of their claims, but what these claims cause reasonable\nconsumers to believe. Questions can be raised, of course, about what\nit means to be reasonable (Scalet 2003); the answer may depend on who\nthe consumers are.\n\nIntention is usually taken to be irrelevant to deception in\nadvertising. That is, an advertisement may be deemed deceptive even if\nthe advertiser doesn\u2019t intend to deceive anyone. Some\nphilosophers would say that these advertisements are better described\nas misleading. (For discussion, see the entry on\n the definition of lying and deception.)\n Regulators of advertising blur this distinction, or perhaps they\ndon\u2019t care about it. Their goal is to protect consumers from\nacting on materially false beliefs, which may be caused either by\ndeception or by blamelessly being misled.\n\nMany reasons have been offered for why deceptive advertising is wrong.\nOne is the Kantian claim that deceiving others is disrespectful to\nthem, a use of them as a mere means. Deceptive advertising may also\nlead to harm, to consumers (who purchase suboptimal products, given\ntheir desires) and competitors (who lose out on sales). A final\ncriticism of deceptive advertising is that it erodes trust in society\n(Attas 1999). When people do not trust each other, they will either\nnot engage in economic transactions, or engage in them only with\ncostly legal protections.\n\nThe persuasive component of advertising is also a fruitful subject of\nethical inquiry. Galbraith (1958), an early critic, thinks that\nadvertising, in general, does not inform people how to acquire what\nthey want, but instead gives them new wants. He calls this the\n\u201cdependence effect\u201d: our desires depend on what is\nproduced, not vice versa. Moreover, since we are inundated\nwith advertising for consumer goods, we want too many of those goods\nand not enough public goods. Hayek (1961) rejects this claim, arguing\nthat few if any of our desires are independent of our environment, and\nthat anyway, desires produced in us through advertising are no less\nsignificant than desires produced in us in other ways.\n\nGalbraith is concerned about the persuasive effects of\nadvertisements. In contrast, recent writers focus on the\ntechniques that advertisers use to persuade. Some of these\nare alleged to cross the line into manipulation (Aylsworth, 2020;\nBrenkert 2008; Sher 2011). It is difficult to define manipulation\nprecisely, though attempts have been made (for extensive discussion,\nsee the entry on\n the ethics of manipulation).\n For our purposes, manipulative advertising can be understood as\nadvertising that attempts to persuade consumers, often (but not\nnecessarily) using non-rational means, to make irrational or\nsuboptimal choices, given their own needs and desires.\n\nAssociative advertising is often identified as a type of manipulative\nadvertising. In associative advertising, the advertiser tries to\nassociate a product with a positive belief, feeling, attitude, ideal,\nor activity which usually has little to do with the product itself.\nThus many television commercials for trucks in the U.S. associate\ntrucks with manliness. Commercials for body fragrances associate those\nproducts with sex between beautiful people. The suggestion is that if\nyou are a certain sort of person (e.g., a manly one), then you will\nhave a certain sort of product (e.g., a truck). In an important\narticle, Crisp (1987) argues that this sort of advertising attempts to\ncreate desires in people by circumventing their faculties of conscious\nchoice, and in so doing subverts their autonomy (cf. Arrington 1982;\nPhillips 1994). Lippke (1989) argues that it makes people desire the\nwrong things, encouraging us to try to satisfy our non-market desires\n(e.g., to be more manly) through market means (e.g., buying a truck)\n(cf. Aylsworth 2020). How seriously we should take these criticisms\nmay depend on how effective associative and other forms of persuasive\nadvertising are. To the extent that advertisers are unsuccessful at\n\u201cgoing around\u201d our faculty of conscious choice, we may be\nless worried and more amused by their attempts to do so (Bishop 2000;\nGoldman 1984).\n\nOur judgments on this issue should be context-sensitive. While most\npeople may be able to see through advertisers\u2019 attempts to\npersuade them, some may not be (at least some of the time). Paine\n(Paine et al. 1984) argues that advertising is justified because it\nhelps consumers make wise decisions in the marketplace. But children,\nshe argues, lack the capacity for making wise consumer choices (see\nalso E.S. Moore 2004). Thus advertising directed at children\nconstitutes a form of objectionable exploitation. Other populations\nwho may be similarly vulnerable are the senile, the ignorant, and the\nbereaved. Ethics may require not a total ban on marketing to them but\nspecial care in how they are marketed to (Brenkert 2008; cf. Palmer\n& Hedberg 2013).\n5.4 Sales\n\nSales are central to business. Perhaps surprisingly, business\nethicists have said relatively little about sales.\n\nAn emerging set of issues concerns refusals to sell. Normally\nbusinesses want to sell their goods and services to everyone. But not\nalways. In 2012, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop declined to\nsell a wedding cake to a same-sex couple because he opposed same-sex\nmarriage on religious grounds. In response, the couple filed a\ncomplaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Should Phillips\nhave sold the wedding cake to the couple? We might say that a\ncommercial transaction is a kind of association, and\npeople\u2014including business owners like Phillips\u2014should be\nfree to associate, or not, with whomever they choose. Or we might say,\nas Phillips did, that his actions were protected by freedom of\nreligion, since they were an expression of his identity, which\nincludes his religious commitments. Alternatively, we might claim that\nPhillips was discriminating against the couple, and his actions were\nwrong for the same reasons discrimination typically is, viz., it\ndenies people opportunities and undermines their dignity (Corvino,\nAnderson, & Girgis 2017).\n\nQuestions can also be raised about the techniques advertisers use to\nsell. These questions are similar to the ones asked about advertising.\nSalespeople are, in a sense, the final advertisers of products to\nconsumers. An early contribution to the ethics of sales is found in\nHolley (1986), who develops a set of obligations for salespeople\nderived from the point of market activity, which he says is to\nefficiently meet people\u2019s needs and wants (cf. Heath 2014). In\nwhat is probably the most sophisticated treatment of the subject,\nCarson (2010) says salespeople have at least the following four\npro tanto duties: (1) provide customers with safety warnings\nand precautions; (2) refrain from lying and deception; (3) fully\nanswer customers\u2019 questions about items; and (4) refrain from\nsteering customers toward purchases that are unsuitable for them,\ngiven their stated needs and desires. Carson justifies (1)\u2014(4)\nby appealing to the golden rule: treat others as you want to be\ntreated. He identifies two other duties that salespeople\nmight have (he is agnostic): (5) do not sell customers\nproducts that you (the salesperson) think are unsuitable for them,\ngiven their needs and desires, without telling customers why you think\nthis; and (6) do not sell customers poor quality or defective\nproducts, without telling them why you think this. For the most part,\n(1)\u2014(4) ask the salesperson not to harm the customer; (5) and\n(6) ask the salesperson to help the customer, in particular, help her\nnot to make foolish mistakes. The broader issue is one of disclosure\n(Holley 1998). How much information we think salespeople are required\nto share with customers may depend on what kind of relationship we\nthink they should have, e.g., to what extent it is adversarial.\n\nFor many products bought and sold in markets, sellers offer an item at\na certain price, and buyers take or leave that price. But in some\ncases there is negotiation over price (and other aspects of the\ntransaction). We see this in the sale of \u201cbig ticket\u201d\nitems such as cars and houses, and in salaries for jobs. While there\nare many ethical issues that arise in negotiation, one issue that has\nreceived special attention is \u201cbluffing\u201d, or deliberately\nmisstating one\u2019s bargaining position. The locus classicus\nfor this discussion is Carr (1968). According to him, bluffing in\nnegotiations is permissible because business has its own distinctive\nset of moral rules and bluffing is permissible according to those\nrules. Carson (2010) agrees that bluffing is permissible in business,\nthough in a more limited range of cases. Carson\u2019s argument\nappeals to self-defense. If you have good reason to believe that your\nadversary in a negotiation is misstating her bargaining position, then\nyou are permitted to misstate yours. A requirement to tell the truth\nin these circumstances would put you at a significant disadvantage\nrelative to your adversary, which you are not required to suffer. An\nimplication of Carson\u2019s view is that you are not permitted to\nmisstate your bargaining position if you do not have good reason to\nbelieve that your adversary is misstating hers.\n5.5 Pricing\n\nIn simplified models of the market, individual buyers and sellers are\n\u201cprice-takers\u201d, not \u201cprice-makers\u201d. That is,\nthe prices of goods and services are set by the aggregate forces of\nsupply and demand; no individual buys or sells a good for anything\nother than the market price. In reality, things are different. Sellers\nof goods have some flexibility about how to price goods.\n\nMost business ethicists would accept that, in most cases, the prices\nat which products should be sold is a matter for private individuals\nto decide. This view has been defended on grounds of property rights.\nSome claim that if I have a right to a thing, then I am free to\ntransfer that thing to you on whatever terms that I propose and you\naccept (Boatright 2010). It has also been defended on grounds of\nwelfare. Prices set by voluntary exchanges reveal valuable information\nabout the relative demand for and supply of goods, allowing resources\nto flow to their most productive uses (Hayek 1945). Despite this, most\nbusiness ethicists also recognize some limits on prices.\n\nOne issue that has received increasing attention is price\ndiscrimination. This is discrimination based on willingness to pay, or\nthe practice of charging more to people who are willing to pay more.\nThis might at first seem unfair or even exploitative, but in fact it\nis commonplace and usually unremarkable (Elegido 2011; Marcoux 2006a).\nExamples of price discrimination include senior and student discounts,\nbulk discounts, versioning, and the sort of bargaining one finds in\ncar dealerships and flea markets. We might see price discrimination as\nan implication of freedom in pricing, and according to a familiar\nresult in economics, price discrimination increases social welfare,\nprovided that it enables producers to increase output (Varian 1985).\nBut some instances of price discrimination have come in for criticism.\nOnline retailers collect and purchase enormous amounts of information\nabout consumers, and there is evidence that they are using this to\npersonalize prices, or tailor prices to what they think are\nconsumers\u2019 reservation prices, i.e., the highest amounts they\nare willing to pay. Some believe that this practice is unfair\n(Steinberg 2020), though they problem may simply be that consumers\ndon\u2019t know what retailers are up to.\n\nAnother issue of pricing ethics is price gouging. Price gouging can be\nunderstood as a sharp increase in the price of a necessary good in the\nwake of an emergency which renders that good scarce (Hughes 2020;\nZwolinski 2008). As the novel coronavirus spread around the world in\nearly 2020, retailers began to charge extremely high prices for\ncleaning products and medical supplies. Many jurisdictions have laws\nagainst price gouging, and it is widely regarded as unethical (Snyder\n2009). The reason is that it is a paradigm case of exploitation:\nA extracts an excessive benefit out of B in\ncircumstances in which B cannot reasonably refuse\nA\u2019s offer (Valdman 2009). But some theorists defend\nprice gouging. While granting that sales of items in circumstances\nlike these are exploitative, they note that they are mutually\nbeneficial. Both the seller and buyer prefer to engage in the\ntransaction rather than not engage in it. Moreover, when items are\nsold at inflated prices, this both limits hoarding and attracts more\nsellers into the market. Permitting price gouging may thus be the\nfastest way of eliminating it (Zwolinski 2008). (For further\ndiscussion, see the entry on\n exploitation.)\n\nMost contemporary scholars believe that sellers have wide, though not\nunlimited, discretion in how much they charge for goods and services.\nBut there is an older tradition in business ethics, found in Aquinas\nand other medieval scholars, according to which there is one price\nthat sellers should charge: the \u201cjust price\u201d. There is\ndebate about what exactly medieval scholars meant by \u201cjust\nprice\u201d. According to a historically common interpretation, the\njust price is determined by the seller\u2019s cost of production,\ni.e., the price that compensates the seller for the value of her labor\nand expenses. More recent interpretations understand the medieval just\nprice at something closer to the market price, which may be more or\nless than the cost of production (Koehn & Wilbratte 2012).\n6. Firms and workers\n\nBusiness ethicists have written much about the relationship between\nemployers and employees. Below we consider four issues at the\nemployer/employee interface: (1) hiring and firing, (2) pay, (3)\nmeaningful work, and (4) whistleblowing. Another important topic at\nthis interface is privacy. For space reasons it will not be discussed,\nbut see the entries on\n privacy\n and\n privacy and information technology.\n6.1 Hiring and firing\n\nEthical issues in hiring and firing tend to focus on the question:\nWhat criteria should employers use, or not use, in employment\ndecisions? The question of what criteria employers should not use is\naddressed in discussions of discrimination.\n\nWhile there is some debate about whether discrimination in employment\nshould be legally prohibited (see Epstein 1992), almost everyone\nagrees that it is morally wrong (Hellman 2008; Lippert-Rasmussen\n2014). Discussion has focused on two questions. First, when does the\nuse of a certain criterion in an employment decision count as\ndiscriminatory? It would seem wrong if Walmart were to exclude white\napplicants for a job in their marketing department, but not wrong if\nthe Hovey Players (a theater troupe) were to exclude white applicants\nfor the role of Walter Younger in A Raisin in the Sun. We\nmight say that whether a hiring practice is discriminatory depends on\nwhether the criterion used is job-relevant. But the concept of\njob-relevance is contested, as the case of \u201creaction\nqualifications\u201d reveals. Suppose that white diners prefer to be\nserved by white waiters rather than black waiters. In this case race\nseems job-relevant, but it seems wrong for employers to take race into\naccount (Mason 2017). Another question that has received considerable\nattention is: What makes discrimination wrong? Some argue that\ndiscrimination is wrong because of its effects on those who are\ndiscriminated against (Lippert-Rasmussen 2014); others think that it\nis wrong because of what it expresses to them (Hellman 2008). (For\nextensive discussion, see the entry on\n discrimination.)\n\nSome writers believe that employers\u2019 obligations are not\nsatisfied simply by avoiding using certain criteria in hiring\ndecisions. According to them, employers have a duty to hire the most\nqualified applicant. Some justify this duty by appealing to\nconsiderations of desert (D. Miller 1999; Mulligan 2018); others\njustify it by appealing to equal opportunity (Mason 2006). We might\nobject to this view by appealing to property rights. A job offer\ntypically implies a promise to pay the job-taker a sum of your money\nfor performing certain tasks. While we might think that excluding some\nways you can dispose of your property (e.g., rules against\ndiscrimination in hiring) can be justified, we might think that\nexcluding all ways but one (viz., a requirement to hire the most\nqualified applicant) is unjustified. In support of this, we might\nthink that a small business owner does nothing wrong when she hires\nher daughter for a part-time job as opposed to a more qualified\nstranger.\n\nThe question of when employees may be fired is a staple of business\nethics texts and was the subject of considerable debate in the\nbusiness ethics literature in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. There\nare two main views: those who think that employment should be\n\u201cat will\u201d, so that an employer can terminate an employee\nfor any reason (Epstein 1984; Maitland 1989), and those who think that\nemployers should be able to terminate employees only for \u201cjust\ncause\u201d (e.g., poor performance or excessive absenteeism) (McCall\n& Werhane 2010). In fact, few writers hold the \u201cpure\u201d\nversion of the \u201cat will\u201d view. Most would say, and the law\nagrees, that it is wrong for an employer to terminate an employee for\ncertain reasons, e.g., a discovery that he is Muslim or his refusal to\ncommit a crime for the employer. Thus the debate is between those who\nthink that employers should be able to terminate employees for any\nreason with some exceptions, and those who think that\nemployers should be able to terminate employees only for certain\nreasons. In the U.S., most employees are at will, while in Europe,\nmost employees are covered, after a probationary period, by something\nanalogous to just cause. Arguments for just cause appeal to the\neffects that termination has on individual employees, especially those\nwho have worked for an employer for many years (McCall & Werhane\n2010). Arguments for at will employment appeal to freedom or\nmacroeconomic effects. It is claimed, in the former case, that just\ncause is an unwarranted restriction on employers\u2019 and\nemployees\u2019 freedom of contract (Epstein 1984), and in the latter\ncase, that it raises the unemployment rate (Maitland 1989). The more\ndifficult it is for an employer to fire an employee, the more\nreluctant she will be to hire one in the first place.\n6.2 Compensation\n\nBusinesses generate revenue, and some of this revenue is distributed\nto employees in the form of compensation, or pay. Since the demand for\npay typically exceeds the supply, the question of how pay should be\ndistributed is naturally analyzed as a problem of justice.\n\nTwo theories of justice in pay have attracted attention. One may be\ncalled the \u201cagreement view\u201d. According to it, a just wage\nis whatever wage the employer and the employee agree to without force\nor fraud (Boatright 2010). This view is sometimes justified in terms\nof property rights. Employees own their labor, and employers own their\ncapital, and they are free, within broad limits, to dispose of it as\nthey please. In addition, we might think that wages should be should\ndetermined by voluntary agreement for the same reason prices generally\nshould be, viz., it allocates resources to their most productive uses,\nas determined by people\u2019s wants (Heath 2018; Hayek 1945). A\n\u201cwage\u201d, after all, is just a special name for the price of\nlabor.\n\nA second view of wages may be called the \u201ccontribution\nview\u201d. According to it, the just wage for a worker is the wage\nthat reflects her contribution to the firm. This view comes in two\nversions. On the absolute version, workers should receive an amount of\npay that equals the value of their contributions to the firm (D.\nMiller 1999). On the comparative version, workers should receive an\namount of pay that reflects the relative value of their contributions\nto the firm, given what others in the firm contribute and are paid\n(Sternberg 2000). The contribution view strikes some as normatively\nbasic, a view for which no further argument can be given (D. Miller\n1999). An analogy may be drawn with punishment. Just as it seems\nintuitively right for the severity of a criminal\u2019s punishment to\nreflect the seriousness of her crime, so it may seem intuitively right\nfor the value of a persons\u2019s pay to reflect the value of her\nwork (Moriarty 2016). In this way, pay might be understood as a reward\nfor work.\n\nSome argue that compensation should be evaluated not only as a problem\nof justice but as an incentive. The question here is what pay\nencourages employees to do, and how it encourages them to do it.\nPoorly structured compensation packages for traders in the financial\nservices industry are thought to have contributed to the financial\ncrisis of 2007-2009 (Kolb 2012). Traders were incentivized to take\nexcessively risky bets, and when those bets went bad, their firms\ncould not cover the losses, putting the firms and ultimately the whole\nfinancial system in peril. Bad incentives may also help to explain the\nrecent account fraud scandal at Wells Fargo.\n\nThe pay of any employee can be evaluated from a moral point of view.\nBut business ethicists have paid particular attention to the pay of\ncertain employees, viz., CEOs and workers in factories in developing\ncountries, often called \u201csweatshops.\u201d\n\nThere has been significant debate about whether CEOs are paid too much\n(Boatright, 2010; Moriarty 2005), with scholars falling into two\ncamps. Those in the \u201cmanagerial power\u201d camp believe that\nCEOs wield power over boards of directors, and use this power to\nextract above-market rents from their firms (Bebchuk & Fried\n2004). Those in the \u201cefficient contracting\u201d camp believe\nthat pay negotiations between CEOs and boards are usually carried out\nat arm\u2019s-length, and that CEOs\u2019 large compensation\npackages reflect their rare and valuable skills. (For a recent survey\nof relevant empirical issues, see Edmans, Gabaix, & Jenter\n2017).\n\nThere has also been a robust debate about whether workers in\nsweatshops are paid too little. Some say \u2018no\u2019 (Powell\n& Zwolinski 2012; Zwolinski 2007). They say that sweatshops wages,\nwhile low by standards in developed countries, are not low by the\nstandards of the countries in which the sweatshops are located. This\nexplains why people choose to work in a sweatshop; it is the best\noffer they have. Efforts to increase artificially the wages of\nsweatshop workers, according to these writers, is misguided on two\ncounts. First, it is an interference with the autonomous choices of\nemployers and workers. Second, it is likely to make workers worse off,\nsince employers will respond by either moving operations to a new\nlocation or employing fewer workers in that location (cf. Kates 2015).\nThese writers sometimes appeal to a principle of\n\u201cnonworseness,\u201d according to which a consensual, mutually\nbeneficial interaction (of the sort sweatshop owners and workers\nengage in) cannot be worse than its absence. Other writers challenge\nthese claims. While granting that workers choose to work in\nsweatshops, they deny that their choices are truly voluntary (Arnold\n& Bowie 2003; Kates 2015). Given their low wages, this suggests\nthat sweatshop workers are wrongfully exploited (Faraci 2019).\nMoreover, some argue, firms can and should do more for sweatshop\nworkers, on grounds on fairness or beneficence (Snyder 2010). These\nwriters invoke a principle of \u201cinteraction,\u201d according to\nwhich people involved in a certain relationship (of the sort sweatshop\nowners and workers are engaged in) must live up to certain standards\nof conduct (which exploitation is alleged to fall below). In response\nto the claim that firms put themselves at a competitive disadvantage\nif they do, writers have pointed to actual cases where firms have been\nable to secure better treatment for sweatshop workers without\nsuffering serious financial penalties (Hartman, Arnold, & Wokutch\n2003). (For further discussion, see the entry on\n exploitation.)\n6.3 Meaningful work\n\nSmith (1776 [1976]) famously observed that a detailed division of\nlabor greatly increases the productivity of manufacturing processes.\nTo use his example: if one worker performs all of the tasks required\nto make a pin himself\u201418, we are told\u2014he can make just a\nfew pins per day. However, if the worker specializes in one or two of\nthese tasks, and combines his efforts with other workers who\nspecialize in one or two of the other tasks, then together they can\nmake thousands of pins per day. But according to Smith, there is human\ncost to the detailed division of labor. Performing one or two simple\ntasks all day makes a worker \u201cas stupid and ignorant as it is\npossible for a human creature to become\u201d (Smith 1776 [1976]:\nV.1.178).\n\nTo avoid this result, some call for work to be made more\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d. In this sense, a call for meaningful work is\nnot a call for work to be more \u201cimportant\u201d, i.e., to\ncontribute to the production of a good or service that is objectively\nvaluable, or that workers believe is valuable (cf. Michaelson 2021;\nVeltman 2016). Instead, it is a call for labor processes to be\narranged so that work is interesting, requires skill, and gives\nworkers substantial decision-making power (Arneson 1987; Roessler\n2012; Schwartz 1982).\n\nSmith\u2019s insight that labor processes are more efficient when\nthey are divided into meaningless segments leads some writers to\nbelieve that, in a competitive economy, firms will not provide as much\nmeaningful work as workers want (Werhane 1985). In response, it has\nbeen argued that there is a market for labor, and if workers want\nmeaningful work, then employers have an incentive to provide it\n(Maitland 1989; Nozick 1974). According to this argument, insofar as\nwe see \u201ctoo little\u201d meaningful work on offer, this is\nbecause workers prefer not to have it\u2014or more precisely, because\nworkers are willing to trade meaningfulness for other benefits, such\nas higher wages.\n\nThe above argument treats meaningful work as a matter of preference,\nas a job amenity that employers can decline to offer or that workers\ncan trade away (cf. Yeoman 2014). Others resist this understanding.\nAccording to Schwartz (1982), employers are required to offer\nemployees meaningful work, and employees are required to perform it,\nout of respect for autonomy (see also Bowie 2017). The idea is that\nthe autonomous person makes choices for herself; she does not\nmindlessly follow others\u2019 directions. A difficulty for this\nargument is that respect for autonomy does not seem to require that we\nmake all choices for ourselves. A person might, it seems,\nautonomously choose to allow important decisions to be made for her in\ncertain spheres of her life, e.g., by a coach, a family member, a\nmedical professional, or a military commander.\n\nA potential problem for this response brings us back to Smith, and to\n\u201cformative\u201d arguments for meaningful work. The problem,\naccording to some writers, is that if most of a person\u2019s day is\ngiven over to meaningless tasks, then her capacity for autonomous\nchoice, and perhaps her other intellectual faculties, may deteriorate.\nA call for meaningful work may be understood as a call for workplaces\nto be arranged so that this deterioration does not occur (Arneson\n2009; Arnold 2012; Yeoman 2014). In addition to Smith, Marx (1844\n[2000]) was concerned about the effects of work on human\nflourishing.\n\nFormative arguments face at least two difficulties, one empirical and\none normative. The empirical difficulty is establishing the connection\nbetween meaningless work and autonomous choice (or another\nintellectual faculty). More evidence is needed. The normative\ndifficulty is that formative arguments make certain assumptions about\nthe nature of the good and the state\u2019s role in promoting it.\nThey assume that it is better for people to have fully developed\nfaculties of autonomous choice (etc.) and that the state should help\nto develop them. These assumptions might be challenged, e.g., by\nliberal neutralists (Roessler 2012; Veltman 2016). Yeoman (2014) seeks\nto surmount this challenge\u2014and make meaningful work safe for\nliberal political theory\u2014by conceptualizing meaningful work as a\nfundamental human need, not a mere preference.\n6.4 Whistleblowing\n\nSuppose you discover, as Tyler Shultz did at Theranos in 2015, that\nyour firm is deceiving regulators and investors about the efficacy of\nits products. To stop this, one thing you might do is \u201cblow the\nwhistle\u201d by disclosing this information to a third party. While\nscholars give different definitions of whistleblowing (see, e.g.,\nBrenkert 2010; Davis 2003; DeGeorge 2009; Delmas 2015), the following\nelements are usually present: (1) insider status, (2) non-public\ninformation, (3) illegal or immoral activity, (4) avoidance of the\nusual chain of command in the firm, (5) intention to solve the\nproblem. In the above example, Shultz was a whistleblower because he\nwas (1) a Theranos employee (2) who disclosed non-public information\n(3) about illegal activity in the firm (4) to a state regulator (5) in\nan effort to stop that activity.\n\nDebate about whistleblowing tends to focus on the question of when\nwhistleblowing is justified\u2014in the sense of when it is\npermissible, or when it is required. This debate assumes that\nwhistleblowing requires justification, or is wrong, other things\nequal. Many business ethicists make this assumption on the grounds\nthat employees have a pro tanto duty of loyalty to their\nfirms (Elegido 2013). Against this, some argue that the relationship\nbetween the firm and the employee is purely transactional\u2014an\nexchange of money for labor (Duska 2000)\u2014and so is not\nnormatively robust enough to ground a duty of loyalty. (For a\ndiscussion of this issue, see the entry on\n loyalty.)\n\nOne prominent justification of whistleblowing is due to DeGeorge\n(2009). According to him, it is permissible for an employee to blow\nthe whistle when his doing so will prevent harm to society. (In a\nsimilar account, Brenkert [2010] says that the duty to blow the\nwhistle derives from a duty to prevent wrongdoing.) The duty to\nprevent harm can have more weight, if the harm is great enough, than\nthe duty of loyalty. To determine whether whistleblowing is not simply\npermissible but required, DeGeorge says, we must take into account the\nlikely success of the whistleblowing and its effects on the\nwhistleblower himself. Humans are tribal creatures, and whistleblowers\nare often treated badly by their colleagues. (Shultz and his family\nwere hounded by Theranos\u2019s powerful and well-connected lawyers,\nat a cost to them of hundreds of thousands of dollars.) So if\nwhistleblowing is unlikely to succeed, then it need not be attempted.\nThe lack of a moral requirement to blow the whistle in these cases can\nbe seen as a specific instance of the rule that individuals need not\nmake huge personal sacrifices to promote others\u2019 interests, even\nwhen those interests are important.\n\nAnother account of whistleblowing is given by Davis (2003). Like\nBrenkert (and unlike DeGeorge), Davis focuses on the wrongdoing that\nthe firm engages in (not the harm it causes). According to Davis,\nhowever, the point of whistleblowing is not so much to prevent the\nwrongdoing but to avoid one\u2019s own complicity in it. He says that\nan employee is required to blow the whistle on her firm when she\nbelieves that it is engaged in seriously wrongful behavior, and her\nwork for the firm \u201cwill contribute \u2026 to the wrong if\n\u2026 [she] [does] not publicly reveal what [she knows]\u201d\n(2003: 550). Davis\u2019s account limits whistleblowers to people who\nare currently firm insiders. Many find this counterintuitive, since it\nimplies that people often described as whistleblowers, like Jeffrey\nWigand (Brown & Williamson) and Edward Snowden (NSA), are not\nactually whistleblowers.\n7. The firm in society\n\nBusiness activity and business entities have an enormous impact on\nsociety. One way that businesses impact society, of course, is by\nproducing goods and services and by providing jobs. But businesses can\nalso impact society by trying to solve social problems and by using\ntheir resources to influence governments\u2019 laws and\nregulations.\n7.1 Corporate social responsibility\n\n\u201cCorporate social responsibility\u201d, or CSR, is typically\nunderstood as actions by businesses that are (i) not legally required,\nand (ii) intended to benefit parties other than the corporation (where\nbenefits to the corporation are understood in terms of return on\nequity, return on assets, or some other measure of financial\nperformance). The parties who benefit may be more or less closely\nassociated with the firm itself; they may be the firm\u2019s own\nemployees or people in distant lands.\n\nA famous example of CSR involves the pharmaceutical company Merck. In\nthe late 1970s, Merck was developing a drug to treat parasites in\nlivestock, and it was discovered that a version of the drug might be\nused treat Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, a disease that causes\ndebilitating itching, pain, and eventually blindness in people. The\nproblem was that the drug would cost hundreds of millions of dollars\nto develop, and would generate little or no revenue for Merck, since\nthe people usually afflicted with river blindness were too poor to\nafford it. Ultimately Merck decided to develop the drug. As expected,\nit was effective in treating river blindness, but Merck made no money\nfrom it. As of this writing in 2021, Merck, now in concert with\nseveral nongovernmental organizations, continues to manufacture and\ndistribute the drug throughout the developing world for free.\n\nThe scholarly literature on CSR is dominated by social scientists.\nTheir question is typically whether, when, and how socially\nresponsible actions benefit firms financially. The conventional wisdom\nis that there is a slight positive correlation between corporate\nsocial performance and corporate financial performance, but it is\nunclear which way the causality goes (Vogel 2005; Zhao & Murrell\n2021). That is, it is not clear whether prosocial behavior by firms\ncauses them to be rewarded financially (e.g., by consumers who value\ntheir behavior), or whether financial success allows firms to engage\nin more prosocial behaviors (e.g., by freeing up resources that would\notherwise be spent on core business functions).\n\nMany writers connect the debate about CSR with the debate about the\nends of corporate governance. Thus Friedman (1970) objects to CSR,\nsaying that managers should be maximizing shareholder wealth instead.\n(Friedman also thinks that CSR is a usurpation of the democratic\nprocess and often wasteful, since managers aren\u2019t experts in\nsolving social problems.) Stakeholder theory (Freeman et al. 2010) is\nthought to be more accommodating of prosocial activity by firms, since\nit permits firms to do things other than increase shareholder\nwealth.\n\nWe do not need, however, to see the debate about CSR a debate about\nthe proper ends of corporate governance. We can see it as a debate\nabout the nature and scope of firms\u2019 moral duties, i.e., what\nobligations (e.g., of rescue or beneficence) they must discharge,\nwhatever their goals are (Hsieh 2004; Mejia 2020).\n\nMany writers give broadly consequentialist reasons for CSR. The\narguments tend to go as follows: (1) there are serious problems in the\nworld, such as poverty, conflict, environmental degradation, and so\non; (2) any agent with the resources and knowledge necessary to\nameliorate these problems has a moral responsibility to do so,\nassuming the costs they incur on themselves are not excessively high;\n(3) firms have the resources and knowledge necessary to ameliorate\nthese problems without incurring excessively high costs; therefore,\n(4) firms should ameliorate these problems (Dunfee 2006a).\n\nThe view that someone should do something about the\nworld\u2019s problems seems true to many people. Not only is there an\nopportunity to increase social welfare by alleviating suffering,\nsuffering people may also have a right to assistance. The\ncontroversial issue is who should do something to help, and how much\nthey should do. Thus defenders of the above argument focus most of\ntheir attention on establishing that firms have these duties,\nagainst those who say that these duties are properly assigned to\nstates or individuals. O. O\u2019Neill (2001) and Wettstein (2009)\nargue that firms are \u201cagents of justice\u201d, much like states\nand individuals, and have duties to aid the needy (see also Young\n2011). Strudler (2017) legitimates altruistic behavior by firms by\nundermining the claim that shareholders own them, and so are owed\ntheir surplus wealth. Hsieh (2004) says that, even if we concede that\nfirms do not have social obligations, individuals have them, and the\nbest way for many individuals to discharge them is through the\nactivities of firms (see also McMahon 2013; Mejia 2020).\n\nDebates about CSR are not just debates about whether specific social\nills should be addressed by specific corporations. They are also\ndebates about what sort of society we want to live in. While\nacknowledging that firms benefit society through CSR, Brenkert (1992)\nthinks it is a mistake for people to encourage firms to engage in CSR\nas a practice. When we do so, he says, we cede a portion of the public\nsphere to private actors. Instead of deciding together how we want to\nameliorate social ills affecting our fellow community members, we\nleave it up to private organizations to decide what to do. Instead of\nsharpening our skills of democracy through deliberation and collective\ndecision-making, and reaffirming social bonds through mutual aid, we\nallow our skills and bonds to atrophy through disuse.\n7.2 Corporate political activity\n\nMany businesses are active participants in the political arena. They\nsupport candidates for election, defend positions in public debate,\nlobby government officials, and more. What should be said about these\nactivities?\n\nSocial scientists have produced a substantial literature on corporate\npolitical activity (CPA) (for a review, see Lawton, McGuire, &\nRajwani 2013). This research focuses on such questions as: What forms\ndoes CPA take? What are the antecedents of CPA? What are its\nconsequences? CPA raises many normative questions as well.\n\nWe might begin by asking why corporations should be allowed to engage\nin political activity at all. In a democratic society, freedom of\nexpression is both a right and a value (Stark 2010). People have a\nright to participate in the political process by supporting candidates\nfor public office, defending positions in public debate, and so on. It\nis generally a good thing when they exercise this right, since they\ncan introduce new facts and arguments into public discourse. People\ncan engage in political activity individually, but in a large society,\nthey may find it useful to do so in groups. The firm might be seen as\none of these groups. Indeed, we might think it is especially important\nthat firms engage in (at least some forms of) political activity.\nSociety has an interest in knowing how proposed economic policies will\naffect firms; firms themselves are a good source of information.\n\nBut political activity by corporations has come in for criticism. One\nconcern focuses on what corporations\u2019 goals are. Some worry that\nfirms engage in CPA in order to advance their own interests at the\nexpense of their competitors\u2019 or the public\u2019s. This\nactivity is sometimes described, and condemned, as\n\u201crent-seeking\u201d (Jaworski 2014; Tullock 1989). Questions\nhave been raised about the nature and value of rent-seeking. According\nto a common definition, rent-seeking is socially wasteful economic\nactivity intended to secure benefits from the state rather than the\nmarket. But there is disagreement about what counts as waste. Lobbying\nfor subsidies, or tariffs on foreign competitors, are classic cases of\nrent-seeking. But subsidies for (e.g.) corn might help to secure a\nnation\u2019s food supply, and tariffs on (e.g.) foreign steel\nmanufacturers might help a nation to protect itself in a time of war\n(Boatright 2009; Hindmoor 1999). One person\u2019s private\nrent-seeking is another\u2019s public benefit.\n\nA second concern about CPA is that it can undermine the ideal of\nequality at the heart of democracy (Christiano 2010). Some\ncorporations have a lot of money, and this can be translated into a\nlot of power. In 2010, the state of Indiana passed a law\u2014the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)\u2014that appeared to give\nemployers the freedom to discriminate against LGBTQ people on\nreligious grounds. In response, Salesforce and Angie\u2019s List\ncancelled plans to expand in the state, and threatened to leave it\naltogether. Indiana quickly convened a special session of its\nlegislature and announced that the new law did not in fact give\nemployers this freedom. By contrast, if the average Indianan told the\nlegislature that they might leave the state because of the RFRA, the\nlegislature would not have cared. This objection to CPA is also an\nobjection to political activity by powerful groups like the National\nRifle Association (NRA) or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\nand individuals like Charles Koch or Tom Steyer.\n\nA third objection to CPA is more narrowly targeted. According to it,\ncorporations are not the right type of entities to engage in political\nactivity (Hussain & Moriarty 2018). The key issue is\nrepresentation. Organizations like the NRA and ACLU are legitimate\nparticipants in the political arena because they represent their\nmembers in political debate, and people join or leave them based on\npolitical considerations. By contrast, business organizations have no\nrecognized role to play in the political system, and people join or\nleave them for economic reasons, not political ones. On this\ncriticism, corporate political activity should be conceptualized not\nas a collective effort by all of the corporation\u2019s members to\nspeak their minds about a shared concern, but as an effort by a small\ngroup of powerful owners or executives to use the corporation\u2019s\nresources to advance their own personal ends.\n\nTraditionally CPA goes \u201cthrough\u201d the formal political\nprocess, e.g., contributing to political campaigns or lobbying\ngovernment officials. But increasingly firms are engaging in what\nappears to be political activity that goes \u201caround\u201d or\n\u201coutside\u201d of this process, especially in circumstances in\nwhich the state is weak, corrupt, or incompetent. They do this through\nthe provision of public goods and infrastructure (Ruggie 2004) and the\ncreation of systems of private regulation or \u201csoft law\u201d\n(Vogel 2010). For example, when the Rana Plaza collapsed in Bangladesh\nin 2013, killing more than 1100 garment industry workers, new building\ncodes and systems of enforcement were put into place. But they were\nput into place by the multinational corporations that are supplied by\nfactories in Bangladesh, not by the government of Bangladesh. This\nkind of activity is sometimes called \u201cpolitical CSR,\u201d\nsince it is a kind of CSR that produces a political outcome (Scherer\n& Palazzo 2011). We might call it CPA \u201con steroids\u201d.\nInstead of influencing political outcomes, corporations bring them\nabout almost single-handedly. This is a threat to democratic\nself-rule. Some writers have explored whether it can be ameliorated\nthrough multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), or governance systems\nthat bring together firms, non-governmental organizations, and members\nof local communities to deliberate and decide on policy matters.\nProminent examples include the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the\nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and the Extractive\nIndustries Transparency Initiative (EITI) (Scherer & Palazzo\n2011). Critics have charged that MSIs, while effective in producing\ndialog among stakeholders, are ineffective at holding firms to account\n(Hussain & Moriarty 2018; Moog, Spicer, & B\u00f6hm 2015).\n\nThere is another kind of corporate political activity. This is\npolitical activity whose target is corporations, known as\n\u201cethical consumerism\u201d (for a review see Schwartz 2017).\nConsumers typically make choices based on quality and price. Ethical\nconsumers (also) appeal to moral considerations. They may purchase, or\nchoose not to purchase, goods from retailers who make their products\nin certain countries or who support certain political causes. These\ncan be described as political activities because consumers are using\ntheir economic power to achieve political ends. It is difficult for\nconsumer actions against, or in support of, firms to succeed, since\nthey require coordinating the actions of many individuals. But\nconsuming ethically may be important for personal integrity. You might\nsay that you cannot in good conscience shop at a retailer who is\nworking, in another arena, against your deeply-held values. One\nconcern about ethical consumerism is that it may be a form of\nvigilantism (Hussain 2012; cf. Barry & MacDonald 2018), or mob\njustice. Another is that it is yet another way that people can\nself-segregate by moral and political orientation as opposed to\nfinding common ground.\n7.3 International business\n\nMany businesses operate across national boundaries. These are\ntypically called \u201cmultinational\u201d or\n\u201ctransnational\u201d firms (MNCs or TNCs). Operating\ninternationally heightens the salience of a number of the ethical\nissues discussed above, such as CSR, but it also raises new issues,\nsuch as relativism and divestment. Two issues often discussed in\nconnection with international business are not treated in this\nsection. One is wages and working conditions in sweatshops. This\nliterature is briefly discussed in\n section 6.2.\n The second issue is corruption, which is not discussed in this entry,\nfor space reasons. But see the entry on\n corruption.\n\nA number of business ethicists have developed ethical codes for MNCs,\nincluding DeGeorge (1993) and Donaldson (1989). International agencies\nhave also created codes of ethics for business. Perhaps the most\nfamous of these is the United Nations Global Compact, membership in\nwhich requires organizations to adhere to a variety of rules in the\nareas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In his\nimportant work for that body, Ruggie (2004, 2013) developed a\n\u201cprotect, respect, and remedy\u201d framework for MNCs and\nhuman rights, which assigns the state the primary duty to protect\nhuman rights and remedy abuses of them, and firms the duty to respect\nhuman rights (cf. Wettstein 2009). A striking fact about much of this\nresearch is that, while it is focused on international business, and\nsometimes promulgated by international agencies, the conclusions\nreached do not apply specifically to firms doing business across\nnational boundaries. The duty to, e.g., respect human rights applies\nto firms doing business within national boundaries too. It is\nsimply that the international context is the one in which this duty\nseems most important to discharge, and in which firms are some of the\nfew agents who can do so.\n\nThere are issues, however, that arise specifically for firms doing\nbusiness internationally. Every introductory ethics student learns\nthat different cultures have different moral codes. This is typically\nan invitation to think about whether or not morality is relative to\nculture. For the businessperson, it presents a more immediate\nchallenge: How should cultural differences in moral codes be managed?\nIn particular, when operating in a \u201chost\u201d country, should\nthe businessperson adopt host country standards, or should she apply\nher \u201chome\u201d country standards?\n\nDonaldson is a leading voice on this question, in work done\nindependently (1989, 1996) and with Dunfee (1999). Donaldson and\nDunfee argue that there are certain \u201cmoral minima\u201d that\nmust be met in all contexts. These are given to us by\n\u201chypernorms\u201d, or universal moral values and rules, which\nare themselves justified by a \u201cconvergence of religious,\nphilosophical, and cultural\u201d belief systems (1999: 57). Within\nthe boundaries set by hypernorms, Donaldson and Dunfee say, firms have\n\u201cfree space\u201d to select moral standards. They do not have\nthe liberty to select any standards they want; rather, their choices\nmust be guided by the host country\u2019s traditions and its current\nlevel of economic development. Donaldson and Dunfee call their\napproach \u201cintegrative social contracts theory\u201d (ISCT),\nsince they seek to merge norms derived from hypothetical contracts\nwith norms that people have actually agreed to in particular\nsocieties.\n\nISCT has attracted a great deal of attention and many critics. Much of\nthis criticism has focused on hypernorms, the criteria for which are\nalleged to be ad hoc (Scherer 2015), ambiguous (Brenkert\n2009), and incomplete (Mayer & Cava 1995). Dunfee (2006b) collects\nand analyzes a decade worth of critical commentary on ISCT. For a more\nrecent elaboration and defense of the approach, see Scholz, de los\nReyes, and Smith (2019).\n\nA complication for the debate about whether to apply home country\nstandards in host countries is that multinational corporations engage\nin business across national boundaries in different ways. Some MNCs\ndirectly employ workers in multiple countries, while others contract\nwith suppliers. Nike, for example, does not directly employ workers to\nmake shoes. Rather, Nike designs shoes, and hires firms in other\ncountries to make them. Our views about whether an MNC should apply\nhome country standards in a host country may depend on whether the MNC\nis applying them to its own workers or to those of other firms.\n\nThe same goes for responsibility. MNCs, especially in consumer-facing\nindustries, are often held responsible for poor working conditions in\ntheir suppliers\u2019 factories. Nike was subject to sharp criticism\nfor the labor practices of its suppliers in the 1990s (Hartman et al.\n2003). Initially Nike pushed back, saying that those weren\u2019t\ntheir factories, and so wasn\u2019t their problem. Under mounting\npressure, it changed course and promulgated a set of labor standards\nthat it required all of its suppliers to meet, and now spends\nsignificant resources ensuring that they meet them (Hsieh, Toffel,\n& Hull 2019; Wokutch 2001). This is increasingly the approach\nWestern multinationals take. Here again the response to the Rana Plaza\ntragedy is illustrative. What lengths companies should go to ensure\nthe safety of workers in their supply chains is a question meriting\nfurther study (see Young 2011).\n\nA businessperson may find that a host country\u2019s standards are\nnot just different than her home country\u2019s standards, but\nmorally intolerable. She may decide that the right course of action is\nnot to do business in the country at all, and if she is invested in\nthe country, to divest from it. The issue of divestment received\nsubstantial attention in the 1980s as MNCs were deciding whether or\nnot to divest from South Africa under its Apartheid regime. It may\nattract renewed attention in the coming years as firms and other\norganizations contemplate divesting from the fossil fuel industry.\nCommon reasons to divest from a morally problematic society or\nindustry are to avoid complicity in immoral practices, and to put\npressure on the society or industry to change its practices. Critics\nof divestment worry about the effects of divestment on innocent third\nparties (Donaldson 1989) and about the efficacy of divestment in\nforcing social change (Hudson 2005). Some believe that it is better\nfor firms to stay engaged with the society or industry and try to\nbring about change from within\u2014a policy of \u201cconstructive\nengagement\u201d.\n8. The status of business ethics\n\nIt is not hard to see why philosophers might be interested in\nbusiness. Business activity raises a host of interesting philosophical\nissues: of agency, responsibility, truth, manipulation, exploitation,\njustice, beneficence, and more. After a surge of activity 40 years\nago, however, philosophers seem to be gradually retreating from the\nfield.\n\nOne explanation appeals to demand. Many of the philosophers who\ndeveloped the field were hired into business schools, but after they\nretired, they were not replaced with other philosophers. Business\nschools have hired psychologists to understand why people engage in\nunethical behavior and strategists to explore whether ethics pays.\nThese scholars fit better into the business school environment, which\nis dominated by social scientists. What social scientists do to\nadvance our understanding of descriptive ethics is important, to be\nsure, but it is no substitute for normative reflection on what\nis ethical or unethical in business.\n\nAnother explanation for the retreat of philosophers from business\nethics appeals to supply. There are hardly any philosophy Ph.D.\nprograms that have faculty specializing in business ethics and, as a\nresult, few new Ph.D.\u2019s are produced in this area. Those who\nwork in the area are typically \u201cconverts\u201d from mainstream\nethical theory and political philosophy. Some good news on this front\nis the recent increase in the number of normative theorists working on\nissues at the intersection of philosophy, politics, and economics\n(PPE). Many of the topics these scholars address\u2014the value and\nlimits of markets, the nature of the employment relationship, and the\nrole of government in regulating commerce\u2014are issues business\nethicists care about. But PPE-style philosophers hardly cover the\nwhole field of business ethics.
