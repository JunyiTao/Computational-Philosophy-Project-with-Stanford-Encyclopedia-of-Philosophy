    "main_text": "The argument from nonresistant nonbelief\n2. The argument from nonresistant nonbelief\n\nMore than anyone else, Schellenberg has shaped the contemporary debate over arguments from nonbelief. The main argument from his 1993 book can be stated as follows:\n\n(1) There are\npeople who are capable of relating personally to God but who, through\nno fault of their own, fail to believe. \n(2) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then there are no such\npeople. \n(3) So, there\nis no such God (from 1 and 2). \n\n\nFor the defense of premise (2), Schellenberg\u2019s reasoning\nprovides the following subargument:\n\n(2a) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then there is a personal\nGod who is unsurpassably loving. \n(2b) If there\nis a personal God who is unsurpassably loving, then for any human\nperson H and any time t, if H is at\nt capable of relating personally to God, H has it\nwithin H\u2019s power at t to do so (i.e., will do\nso, just by choosing), unless H is culpably in a contrary\nposition at t. \n(2c) For any\nhuman person H and any time t, H has it\nwithin H\u2019s power at t to relate personally to\nGod only if H at t believes that God exists.\n\n(2d) So, if\nthere is a personal God who is unsurpassably great, then for any human\nperson H and any time t, if H is at\nt capable of relating personally to God, H at\nt believes that God exists, unless H is culpably in\na contrary position at t (from 2a through 2c). \n\n\n(2d) is tantamount to premise\n (2)\n of the main argument.\n\nIn his post-1993 writings, Schellenberg clarifies that he means his\nclaims about God, love, and relationship to be necessary truths.\nMoreover, the main argument of his 2007a replaces talk of\n\u201cculpability\u201d with talk of \u201cresistance\u201d.\n(\u201cI now see this focus on culpability and inculpability as a\nmistake\u201d; 2015a: 54.) And he emphasizes \u201cmeaningful\nconscious relationship\u201d. Finally, his 2015a and 2015b focus on\nthe \u201copenness\u201d of \u201ca perfectly loving God\u201d to\n\u201cpositively meaningful\u201d and \u201creciprocal conscious\nrelationship\u201d. Thus, the latest version of the argument\n(slightly condensed):\n\n(4)\nNecessarily, if God exists, then God perfectly loves such finite\npersons as there may be.\n(5)\nNecessarily, if God perfectly loves such finite persons as there may\nbe, then, for any capable finite person S and time\nt, God is at t open to being in a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with S at\nt.\n(6)\nNecessarily, if for any capable finite person S and time t,\nGod is at t open to being in a positively meaningful and\nreciprocal conscious relationship with S at t, then,\nfor any capable finite person S and time t, it is\nnot the case that S is at t nonresistantly in a\nstate of nonbelief in relation to the proposition that God\nexists.\n(7) There is\nat least one capable finite person S and time t such\nthat S is or was at t nonresistantly in a state of\nnonbelief in relation to the proposition that God exists.\n(8) So, it is\nnot the case that God exists. (from 4 through 7)\n\n\nWe turn now to Schellenberg\u2019s defense of his premises.\n\nSchellenberg argues for premise\n (4)\n on the basis of what he calls ultimism, the proposition that\nthere is a reality that is ultimate in three ways. A\nmetaphysically ultimate reality, he says, \n\nis something whose existence is the ultimate or most fundamental fact\nabout the nature of things, in terms of which any other fact about\nwhat things exist and how they exist would have to be explained in a\ncomprehensive and correct account. \n\nAn axiologically ultimate reality \u201cembod[ies] the\ndeepest possible value\u201d, and \u201cwould have to be the\ngreatest possible reality\u201d. A soteriologically ultimate\nreality is a reality in relation to which \u201cthe deepest or\nultimate human good can be attained\u201d (2015a: 19\u201321). The\nidea of a personal reality that is triply ultimate\u2014that\nis, the idea of God in western philosophy, says Schellenberg\u2014is\nthe idea of the greatest possible person; and, all else being\nequal, a person perfect in love would be an \u201cimprovement\u201d\nover a person that was not perfect in love (2015a: 89\u2013103;\nSchellenberg 2005d).\n\nAs for premise\n (5),\n suppose God perfectly loves Anna. That love would minimally involve\nbenevolence, caring for Anna\u2019s well-being. But it would also\ninvolve aiming \u201cat relationship\u2014a conscious and reciprocal\nrelationship that is positively meaningful, allowing for a deep\nsharing\u201d between them. Moreover, it would involve valuing that\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else. Furthermore, it would never cease, and so God would\nalways value, seek, desire, promote, or preserve personal relationship\nwith Anna, although God would not force himself on her. At the very\nleast, says Schellenberg, all this requires that God will always be\nopen to personal relationship with her (2015b:\n17\u201322).\n\nThis notion of openness with those who are capable of\nit\u2014that is, with those who possess the cognitive and affective\nproperties required to participate in a personal relationship, which,\nin the case of God, would involve such things as a capacity to feel\nthe presence of God, recognizing it as such; a capacity to exhibit\nattitudes of trust, gratitude, and obedience to God, and so on (2015b:\n21n15)\u2014is crucial. Schellenberg writes:\n\nIf one is always open in the sense I intend then, even if one does not\nactively seek or promote personal relationship with another person\ncapable of participating in such relationship\u2026, one makes sure\nthat there is nothing one ever does (in a broad sense including\nomissions) that would have the result of making such relationship\nunavailable to the other, preventing her from being able to\nrelate personally to one, even should she then try. So for God to\nalways be open to personal relationship with a relevantly capable\ncreated person such as Anna in a manner expressing unsurpassable love\nis for God to ensure that there is never something God does\nthat prevents her from being able, just by trying, to participate in\npersonal relationship with God\u2026. Anna may not want relationship\nor even to be reminded of her religious options, and so may through\nresistance of God, which would have to involve self-deception, herself\nproduce a situation in which she is unable to relate personally to\nGod, just like that, without first undoing the behaviour that led to\nit. But unless Anna is resistant in this way at a time, she will find\nit possible to participate in personal relationship with God, and to\ndo so then. Never will she find the door to such relationship closed.\nThis, at the very minimum, is required if God unsurpassably loves Anna\nin a manner aimed at personal relationship with her. (2015b: 21,\nsubstituting \u201cAnna\u201d for \u201cP\u201d)\n\n\nExpanding on what he means by \u201cresistance of God\u201d,\nSchellenberg tells us that if we think\n\nfirst about love and then about openness and then about what it would\ntake for God to allow someone not to be in a position to participate\nin a personal relationship with the divine, we will see that a sort of\nfree resistance sufficient to make it the case that we ourselves have\nshut the door to any relationship with God that might be on offer\nwould be required. To trade in one metaphor for another, if God is\nopen to personal relationship then the divine light will remain on\nunless we close our eyes\u2026. We might imagine a resister wanting\nto do her own thing without considering God\u2019s view of the\nmatter, or wanting to do something she regards as in fact contrary to\nthe values cultivated in a relationship with God. But it would also\ninvolve actions or omissions (at least mental ones) in\nsupport of such desire\u2026. Here we might imagine careless\ninvestigation of one sort or another in relation to the existence of\nGod, or someone deliberately consorting with people who carelessly\nfail to believe in God and avoiding those who believe, or just over\ntime mentally drifting, with her own acquiescence, away from any place\nwhere she could convincingly be met by evidence of God. (2015:\n55\u201356)\n\n\nOf course, there are many other ways in which one might \u201cshut\nthe door\u201d or \u201cclose one\u2019s eyes\u201d and, as a\nresult, lack belief in God\u2019s existence.\n\nAs for\n (6),\n by Schellenberg\u2019s lights, Anna could not even begin to be in a\npositively meaningful, personal relationship with God unless she\nbelieved that God exists. Why? Because\n\na personal relationship is a conscious, reciprocal relationship, and a\nconscious relationship is a relationship one recognizes oneself to be\nin. Given these facts, one clearly cannot even get started in a\npersonal relationship without believing that the other party\nexists. Now belief, as most contemporary philosophers would\nagree, is involuntary in the sense that one cannot choose to believe\nsomething at a time just by trying to. So by God\u2019s not revealing\nGod\u2019s existence, God is doing something that makes it impossible\nfor Anna to participate in personal relationship with God at the\nrelevant time just by trying, and this, according to our definition of\nopenness, is precisely what is involved in God\u2019s not being open\nto having such a relationship with Anna then. (2015b: 23, substituting\n\u201cGod\u201d and \u201cAnna\u201d for \u201cB\u201d\nand \u201cA\u201d)\n\n\nThe upshot is that, if God is open to being in a positively\nmeaningful, reciprocal, and conscious relationship with Anna, then, at\nany time that she is capable of such a relationship, Anna will believe\nthat God exists\u2014unless she has done something that results in\nher being resistant to such a relationship at that time.\n\nAlthough Schellenberg emphasizes the point that perfect love seeks\nrelationships for their own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else, there are additional benefits one should bear in mind\nthat may be jeopardized by divine hiddenness. For consider the\nbenefits to Anna if she were in a positively meaningful, explicit,\nreciprocal conscious relationship with God, even if just one that was\ndevelopmentally in its infancy. First, there would be moral benefits,\ne.g., she would be able to draw on the resources of that relationship\nto overcome flaws in her character, and so she would be more likely to\nemulate the self-giving love with which she was loved, and thus more\nlikely to flourish as a finite person. Second, there would be\nexperiential benefits. She would be, e.g., more likely to experience\npeace and joy stemming from her belief that she is properly related to\nher Maker, and security in believing that, ultimately, all shall be\nwell even if she suffers in the meantime; and she would have the\nprofound pleasure of God\u2019s loving presence. As a consequence of\nthese moral and experiential benefits, Anna\u2019s relationships with\nothers would likely improve (Schellenberg 1993: 19ff).\n\nAs for the empirical\n premise\u2014(7),\n and the earlier\n (1)\u2014Schellenberg\n generalizes from (a) honest seekers of the truth who remain agnostics\nand atheists, including those whose search leads them to convert to\nnontheistic religions, (b) members of cultures that lack the idea of a\npersonal God altogether, e.g., the Chinese in the period from the\nbeginning of their history until the Christian Middle Ages, (c)\nhunter-gatherers prior to recorded history, and (d) those who have\nlost their theistic faith, and who would like nothing more than to\nregain it. Furthermore, Schellenberg appeals to increased secularity,\nespecially in Western cultures: what is the probability that\nall of the hundreds of millions of nonbelievers in the\nsecular West are, at the dawn of their capacity to relate personally\nwith God, resistant? Vanishingly small (2015: 76ff; 2007a: 205,\n228ff).\n",
