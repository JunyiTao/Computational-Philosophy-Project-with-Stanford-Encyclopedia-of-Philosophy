    "main_text": "The Lockean Legacy\n2. The Lockean Legacy\n\nToward the end of his magisterial two-volume commentary on John Locke,\nAyers writes that \n\n\nfor all the transformation of our motives, indeed, of our general\nphilosophical theory \u2026 the debate on personal identity has\nhardly moved on since the innovations of the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. (1991: vol. 2: 281)\n\n\nIn a similar spirit, S. Shoemaker recently adapted Whitehead\u2019s\nfamous remark, observing that \u201cthe history of the topic of\npersonal identity has been a series of footnotes to Locke\u201d\n(2008: 313). It is certainly undeniable that no single discussion of\npersonal identity has done more to shape the current debate than the\nchapter titled \u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d that Locke\nadded to the second edition of his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (II.xxvii). (Hereafter, all textual references to \nLocke are to this work, Locke 1689 [1975].) Also undeniable is the \neffect these\npages have had on the emergence of the animalist alternative to the\nLockean approach to personal identity. For whatever intuitive appeal\nanimalism may seem to have in our secular, post-Darwinian climate, in\nthe wake of Locke\u2019s work, the falsity of animalism was long\ntaken for granted.\n",
