    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nFrancis Bacon was born January, 22, 1561, the second child of Sir\nNicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper of the Seal) and his second wife Lady Anne\nCooke Bacon, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, tutor to Edward VI and one\nof the leading humanists of the age. Lady Anne was highly erudite: she\nnot only had a perfect command of Greek and Latin, but was also\ncompetent in Italian and French. Together with his older brother\nAnthony, Francis grew up in a context determined by political power,\nhumanist learning, and Calvinist zeal. His father had built a new house\nin Gorhambury in the 1560s, and Bacon was educated there for some seven\nyears; later, along with Anthony, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge\n(1573\u20135), where he sharply criticized the scholastic methods of\nacademic training. Their tutor was John Whitgift, in later life\nArchbishop of Canterbury. Whitgift provided the brothers with classical\ntexts for their studies: Cicero, Demosthenes, Hermogenes, Livy,\nSallust, and Xenophon (Peltonen 2007).  Bacon began his studies\nat Gray's Inn in London in 1576; but from 1577 to 1578 he\naccompanied Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador, on his mission in\nParis. According to Peltonen (2007): \n During his stay in France, perhaps in autumn 1577,\nBacon once visited England as the bearer of diplomatic post,\ndelivering letters to Walsingham, Burghley, Leicester, and to the\nQueen herself.\n\nWhen his father died in 1579, he returned to England. Bacon's small\ninheritance brought him into financial difficulties and since his\nmaternal uncle, Lord Burghley, did not help him to get a lucrative\npost as a government official, he embarked on a political career in\nthe House of Commons, after resuming his studies in Gray's Inn. In\n1581 he entered the Commons as a member for Cornwall, and he remained\na Member of Parliament for thirty-seven years. He was admitted to the\nbar in 1582 and in 1587 was elected as a reader at Gray's Inn. His\ninvolvement in high politics started in 1584, when he wrote his first\npolitical memorandum,\nA Letter of Advice to Queen Elizabeth. Right from the\nbeginning of his adult life, Bacon aimed at a revision of natural\nphilosophy and\u2014following his father's example\u2014also tried\nto secure high political office. Very early on he tried to formulate\noutlines for a new system of the sciences, emphasizing empirical\nmethods and laying the foundation for an applied science (scientia\noperativa). This twofold task, however, proved to be too\nambitious to be realized in practice. Bacon's ideas concerning a\nreform of the sciences did not meet with much sympathy from Queen\nElizabeth or from Lord Burghley. Small expectations on this front led\nhim to become a successful lawyer and Parliamentarian. From 1584 to\n1617 (the year he entered the House of Lords) he was an active member\nin the Commons. Supported by Walsingham's patronage, Bacon played a\nrole in the investigation of English Catholics and argued for stern\naction against Mary Queen of Scots. He served on many committees,\nincluding one in 1588 which examined recusants; later he was a member\nof a committee to revise the laws of England. He was involved in the\npolitical aspects of religious questions, especially concerning the\nconflict between the Church of England and nonconformists. In a tract\nof 1591, he tried to steer a middle course in religious politics; but\none year later he was commissioned to write against the Jesuit Robert\nParson (Jardine and Stewart 1999, p. 125), who had attacked English\nsovereignty.\n\n\nFrom the late 1580s onwards, Bacon turned to the Earl of Essex as\nhis patron. During this phase of his life, he particularly devoted\nhimself to natural philosophy. He clearly expressed his position in a\nfamous letter of 1592 to his uncle, Lord Burghley:\n I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends, as I\nhave moderate civil ends: for I have taken all knowledge to be my\nprovince; and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof the\none with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities, the\nother with blind experiments and auricular traditions and impostures,\nhath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in industrious\nobservations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and\ndiscoveries; the best state of that province. This, whether it be\ncuriosity, or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably)\nphilanthropia, is so fixed in my mind as it cannot be removed. And I\ndo easily see, that place of any reasonable countenance doth bring\ncommandment of more wits than of a man's own; which is the thing I\ngreatly affect. (Bacon 1857\u201374, VIII, 109)\n\n\nIn 1593 Bacon fell out favor with the queen on account of his\nrefusal to comply with her request for funds from Parliament. Although\nhe did not vote against granting three subsidies to the government, he\ndemanded that these should be paid over a period six, rather than\nthree, years. This led Sir Robert Cecil and Sir Walter Raleigh to argue\nagainst him in Parliament. Bacon's patron, the Earl of Essex, for\nwhom he had already served as a close political advisor and informer,\nwas not able to mollify the queen's anger over the subsidies; and\nall Essex's attempts to secure a high post for Bacon\n(attorney-general or solicitor-general) came to nothing. Nevertheless,\nthe queen valued Bacon's competence as a man of law. He was\ninvolved in the treason trial of Roderigo Lopez and later on in the\nproceedings against the Earl of Essex. In his contribution to the\nGesta Grayorum (the traditional Christmas revels held in\nGray's Inn) of 1594\u20135, Bacon had emphasized the necessity of\nscientific improvement and progress. Since he failed to secure for\nhimself a position in the government, he  considered the\npossibility of giving up politics and concentrating on natural\nphilosophy. It is no wonder, then, that Bacon engaged in many scholarly\nand literary pursuits in the 1590s. His letters of advice to the Earl\nof Rutland and to the Earl of Essex should be mentioned in this\ncontext. The advice given to Essex is of particular importance because\nBacon recommended that he should behave in a careful and intelligent\nmanner in public, above all abstaining from aspiring to military\ncommands. Bacon also worked in this phase of his career for the\nreform of English law. In 1597 his first book was published, the\nseminal version of his Essays, which contained only ten pieces\n(Klein 2004b). His financial situation was still insecure; but his\nplan to marry the rich widow Lady Hatton failed because she was\nsuccessfully courted by Sir Edward Coke. In 1598 Bacon was unable to\nsell his reversion of the Star Chamber clerkship, so that he was\nimprisoned for a short time on account of his debts. His parliamentary\nactivities in 1597\u201398, mainly involving committee work, were\nimpressive; but when the Earl of Essex in 1599 took command of the\nattempt to pacify the Irish rebels, Bacon's hopes sank. Essex did\nnot solve the Irish question, returned to court and fell from grace, as\nBacon had anticipated he would. He therefore lost a valuable patron and\nspokesman for his projects. Bacon tried to reconcile the queen and\nEssex; but when the earl rebelled against the crown in 1601, he could\ndo nothing to help him. The queen ordered Bacon to participate in the\ntreason trial against Essex. In 1601 Bacon sat in Elizabeth's\nlast parliament, playing an extremely active role.\n\n\n           \nBacon looked forward to the next reign and tried to get in contact with\nJames VI of Scotland, Elizabeth's successor. During James'\nreign Bacon rose to power. He was knighted in 1603 and was created a\nlearned counsel a year later. He took up the political issues of the\nunion of England and Scotland, and he worked on a conception of\nreligious toleration, endorsing a middle course in dealing with\nCatholics and nonconformists. Bacon  married Alice Barnhem, the\nyoung daughter of a rich London alderman in 1606. One year later he was\nappointed Solicitor General. He was also dealing with theories of the\nstate and developed the idea, in accordance with Machiavelli, of a\npolitically active and armed citizenry. In 1608 Bacon became clerk of\nthe Star Chamber; and at this time, he made a review of his life,\njotting down his achievements and failures. Though he still was not\nfree from money problems, his career progressed step by step. In the\nperiod from 1603 to 1613 Bacon was not only busy within English\npolitics. He also created the foundations of his philosophical work by\nwriting seminal treatises which prepared the path for the\nNovum Organum and for the Instauratio Magna.\nIn 1613 he became Attorney General and began the rise to the peak of\nhis political career: he became a member of the Privy Council in 1616,\nwas appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal the following year\u2014thus achieving the same position as his father\u2014and was granted\nthe title of Lord Chancellor and created Baron of Verulam in 1618. In\n1621, however, Bacon, after being created Viscount of St Alban, was\nimpeached by Parliament for corruption. He fell victim to an intrigue\nin Parliament because he had argued against the abuse of monopolies,\nindirectly attacking his friend, the Duke of Buckingham, who was the\nking's favorite. In order to protect Buckingham, the king\nsacrificed Bacon, whose enemies had accused him of taking bribes in\nconnection with his position as a judge. Bacon saw no way out for\nhimself and declared himself guilty.  His fall was contrived by\nhis adversaries in Parliament and by the court faction, for which he\nwas a scapegoat to save the Duke of Buckingham not only from public\nanger but also from open aggression (Mathews 1996). He lost all his\noffices and his seat in Parliament, but retained his titles and his\npersonal property. Bacon devoted the last five years of his life\u2014the famous quinquennium\u2014entirely to his philosophical\nwork. He tried to go ahead with his huge project, the Instauratio\nMagna Scientiarum; but the task was too big for him to accomplish\nin only a few years. Though he was able to finish important parts of\nthe Instauratio, the proverb, often quoted in his works,\nproved true for himself: Vita brevis, ars longa. He died in\nApril 1626 of pneumonia after experiments with ice.\n",
