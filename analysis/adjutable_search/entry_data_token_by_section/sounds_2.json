    "main_text": "Proximal Theories of Sounds || Sounds as Proximal Stimuli\n1.2 Sounds as Proximal Stimuli\n\nA bit more peripheral, albeit still proximal, is a position, defended\nby (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000) claiming that the sound heard is where\nthe hearer is:\n\n\n\u2026while the sound originates at a distance and we can hear that\nit is coming from a direction and even place, and while there is no\nauditory experience of hearing that the sound is where we are, the\nsound that we hear is nonetheless where we are (2000: 447).\n\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that an unheard sound be located away\nfrom the hearer.\n\nSupport for this position comes from the following example. If I hear\nthe noise of a motorcycle far away, the physical event at my ear is\nqualitatively different from the physical event that is produced at\nthe motorcycle\u2019s place. If I was close to the motorcycle, the\nphysical event at my ear would be completely different from, and would\nnot correspond to that of a motorcycle driving far away. A party\nupstairs does not sound the way it sounds to participants to the\nparty. However, these arguments can be resisted on two counts. First,\none should distinguish between source and informational channel.\nConsider a visual analogue. From the fact that reflected light is the\nonly light that hits the eye, it does not follow that one does not see\nreflecting surfaces or is not aware of incident light. Reflected light\ncontains information about the reflecting object and the illumination,\nwhich is unpacked by the brain. In the case of sound, distance,\nechoes, reverberations, and filtering affect the informational channel\nin a way that informs about the position of the source. Second, the\nexamples used to support the proximal theory are unable to account for\nthe perceived constancy of auditory features of distant objects. The\nmotorcycle and the party can be judged to be very noisy, even if the\nphysical events at the hearer are faint because of the distance from\nthe respective sources. We do possess a notion of distal volume of a\nsound.\n\nThe locatedness of the sound at the hearer\u2019s position entails\nthat there are as many sounds as there are actual (or potential)\nhearers around. An alternate account would consider that one and the\nsame sound is present which is, however, multiply located.\n\nThese examples, and the related difficulties, thus suggest that a\nmajor shortcoming of proximal theories is that they do not locate\nsounds where an untutored description of what is perceived suggests\nthey are. This means that if sounds were inner sensations, or\nmechanical events at the ear, we would be almost always mistaken in\nour aural perceptions, at least on important aspects of the sound. In\nturn, this amounts to accounting for auditory perception in terms of a\nmassive error theory. We shall see that proximal theories are not\nalone in endorsing it.\n",
