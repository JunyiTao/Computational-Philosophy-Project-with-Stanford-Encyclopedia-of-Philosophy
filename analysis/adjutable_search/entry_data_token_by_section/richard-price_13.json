    "main_text": "Liberty || .2 Civil Liberty\n5. Influence\n\nAlthough Price was influential in his lifetime in many areas, that\ninfluence soon waned, and few of his works were reprinted after his\ndeath. His immediate impact on discussion of the events surrounding\nthe American and French revolutions was large, but naturally faded as\nthose upheavals slipped into history. He died before the excesses of\nthe French revolution, which had been predicted by Burke. As a result\nof the success of his predictions, Burke acquired an immense\nreputation, while Price\u2019s was eclipsed. There is no doubt that\nPrice, along with others in the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d,\nexaggerated the degree to which people would pay attention to rational\nprinciples and reasonable solutions. There seems little to suggest\nthat his writings had a long-term impact on political philosophy.\nNevertheless, liberal-democratic societies have embraced many of\nPrice\u2019s causes; in that sense, in the longer term, Price could\nbe seen as being on the side of history after all.\n\nHis influence on the Unitarian movement also faded. His version of\nArianism, in which Christ was seen as having most of the supernatural\nattributes of the second person of the Trinity without actually being\nGod, gave way to the Socinian view, championed by Priestley, which\nstressed the straightforward humanity of Jesus. His reputation in\nactuarial work and demography suffered from his mistaken claim that\nthe British population was in decline. Even his beloved project of\nreducing or eliminating the national debt by means of a sinking fund\nfell out of favor.\n\nHis main legacy is, of course, in moral philosophy, but even here it\nis unclear how much direct influence he had. Some of the themes in\nA Review, especially issues to do with moral motivation and\nresponsibility, find distinct echoes in Kant, but that comes from\nsympathy of outlook, rather than influence. And Price\u2019s\nepistemology and metaphysics are wholly different from Kant\u2019s,\ndespite Hastings Rashdall\u2019s exaggerated claim that the\nReview \u201ccontains the gist of the Kantian doctrine\nwithout Kant\u2019s confusion\u201d (1907: 81 fn 1). The main\nfeatures of Price\u2019s epistemology, and his pluralism about moral\nprinciples, emerge again with the British Intuitionists who flourished\nin the first half of the twentieth century. While we know that C. D.\nBroad and Hastings Rashdall both rated Price very highly, \nthere is\nno direct evidence that Prichard, or even Ross (whose views most closely\nresemble Price\u2019s) had read him, though it seems likely they\ndid.\n\nInterest in Price was to some degree revived by books by Roland Thomas\n(1924), Carl Cone (1952), Lennart \u00c5qvist (1960), D. O. Thomas\n(1977), and W. D. Hudson (1970). Since then there has been a steady\ntrickle of articles on aspects of Price\u2019s work, but no real\ngroundswell of interest, despite another revival in the fortunes of\nIntuitionism towards the end of the twentieth century. In 1977 the\nPrice-Priestley Newsletter was founded; it morphed later into\nEnlightenment and Dissent, which ceased publication in 2016.\nHowever, resources for the study of Price have been greatly enhanced\nby the untiring work of D. O. Thomas who not only edited Price\u2019s\npolitical writings but, together with Bernard Peach, produced a\ncomplete edition of Price\u2019s correspondence.\n",
