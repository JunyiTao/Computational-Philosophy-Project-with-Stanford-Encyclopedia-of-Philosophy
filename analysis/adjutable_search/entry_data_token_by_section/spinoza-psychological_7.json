The Psychological Basis for a Theory of Value\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s insistence that human beings not be treated as a dominion\nwithin a dominion includes a commitment to ethical naturalism also.\nJust as he insists that the human mind must be explicable in terms of\nthe laws which govern nature, so he insists that ethical properties,\nwhich he sometimes characterizes as human \u201cmodes of thinking,\u201d be\nexplicable in terms of natural ones. The theory of the affects serves\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical naturalism by introducing explanations of ethical\nconcepts, most importantly the concepts of good, evil, and perfection,\nin psychological terms. In his ethics, Spinoza in some way \u201cretains\nthese words,\u201d although he may be understood to do so under some formal\nrefinement or revision of them (See IV Preface). So his discussions of\ngood and evil and of human perfection in Part III provide the basis for\nthe formal ethical argument which follows in Parts IV and V. \n",
