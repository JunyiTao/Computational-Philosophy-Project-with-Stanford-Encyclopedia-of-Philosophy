    "main_text": "Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s Theory of Semantic Information || Problems for the theory of semantic information\n1.1 Problems for the theory of semantic information\n\nTechnical matters aside, some philosophical issues are immediate.\nFirstly, how do we know in practice how many possible words there are?\nIf we are talking about the number of possible worlds with respect to\nall possible sentences in English, then there will be infinitely many\nof them. Bar-Hillel and Carnap avoided this issue by talking\nexclusively about the semantic information encoded by sentences\nformulated in monadic predicate logic with a finite number of\npredicate letters. Where there are \\(n\\) predicate\nletters, there will be \\(2^n\\) possible objects, exhausting all\npossible predicate combinations. There will then be \\(2^{2^n}\\)\npossible worlds (\u201cstate descriptions\u201d in Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s parlance), corresponding to all possible combinations\nof possible objects. Hintikka (1970, 1973), extended Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s theory of semantic information from monadic predicate\nlogic to fully general predicate logic.\n\nThirdly and more generally, Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information has give rise to two problems of strong\nsignificance philosophically.\n\nThe Bar-Hillel and Carnap Semantic Paradox (BCP)\nThe Scandal of Deduction (SOD)\n\n\nBCP refers to the fact that Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information assigns maximal information to contradictory\nsentences. Where \\(\\perp\\) is an arbitrary contradiction, given that\n\\(\\perp\\) will be false in all possible worlds, we have the following\nvia\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3)\n respectively: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tCont(\\perp) &= W\\; (\\text{i.e., maximal content})\\\\ \\tcont(\\perp) &= 1\\\\ \\inf(\\perp) &= \\infty\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBar-Hillel and Carnap (1952: 229) responded to this situation as\nfollows:\n\n\nIt might perhaps, at first, seem strange that a self-contradictory\nsentence, hence one which no ideal receiver would accept, is regarded\nas carrying with it the most inclusive information. It should,\nhowever, be emphasised that semantic information is here not meant as\nimplying truth. A false sentence which happens to say much is thereby\nhighly informative in our sense. Whether the information it carries is\ntrue or false, scientifically valuable or not, and so forth, does not\nconcern us. A self-contradictory sentence asserts too much; it is too\ninformative to be true.\n\n\nThere are two dimensions to this response that have caused concern in\nphilosophical circles. The first is that their notion of semantic\ninformation is non-factive\u2014semantic information does\nnot need to be true. The second is that they are taking their notion\nof semantic information to underpin informativeness in some\nnon-trivial sense.\n\nSOD refers to the fact philosophical accounts of information are yet\nto give an account of the informativeness of logical truths and\ndeductive inferences. Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic\ninformation assigns minimal information to logical truths (and valid\ndeductive inferences can be transformed into logical truths by\nconjoining the premises into an antecedent of a conditional that takes\nthe conclusion as its consequent). Where \\(\\top\\) is an arbitrary\ntautology, given that \\(\\top\\) will be false in all possible worlds,\nwe have the following via\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3)\n respectively: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tCont(\\top) &= \\varnothing\\\\ \\tcont(\\top) &= 0\\\\ \\inf(\\top) &= 0\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWith respect to logically true sentences returning a minimal\ninformation value, Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1952: 223) respond as\nfollows:\n\n\nThis, however, is by no means to be understood as implying that there\nis no good sense of \u2018amount of information\u2019 in which the\namount of information of these sentences will not be zero at all, and\nfor some people, might even be rather high. To avoid ambiguities, we\nshall use the adjective \u2018semantic\u2019 to differentiate both\nthe presystematic sense of \u2018information\u2019 in which we are\ninterested at the moment and their systematic explicata from other\nsenses (such as \u201camount of psychological information for the\nperson P\u201d) and their explicata.\n\n\nWe will return to SOD briefly in\n section 3.2\n below. Note here however that Hintikka (1970, 1973) mounted a\ntechnically heroic if ultimately unsuccessful attempt to solve it (see\nSequoiah-Grayson (2008)), and for a properly detailed investigation,\nsee the entry on\n logic and information.\n For now we must recognise that the response of Bar-Hillel and Carnap\nabove brings with it some noteworthy philosophical claims of its own.\nFirstly, Bar-Hillel and Carnap are suggesting that the type of\ninformation which is encoded by logical truths and for which the\namount encoded is non-zero, is psychological in some sense or other.\nFurthermore, it may vary for one person from the other even with\nrespect to the same logical truth. Secondly, they are heeding the\nfollowing advice of Claude Shannon, the originator of the mathematical\ntheory of communication, given just two years earlier.\n\n\nThe word \u2018information\u2019 has been given different meanings\nby various writers in the general field of information theory. It is\nlikely that at least a number of these will prove to be useful in\ncertain applications to deserve further study and permanent\nrecognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of\ninformation would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible\napplications of the general field. (1950 [1993: 180]).\n\n\nShannon is advocating a rich informational pluralism, for a\ndetailed development of which see Allo (2007). Shannon\u2019s advice\non this point was, as we are about to see, nothing if not\nprescient.\n",
