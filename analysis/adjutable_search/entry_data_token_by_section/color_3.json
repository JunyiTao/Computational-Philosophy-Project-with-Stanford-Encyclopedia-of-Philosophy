    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Color || The Problem of Color Realism\n1.3 The Problem of Color Realism\n\nFrom our discussion of the scientific tradition on colors, it is clear\n(enough) that two questions face us:\n\nWhat is the right account of colors-as-we-experience-them? of\ncolors-as-we-see-them? colors-as-we-ordinarily-talk-and-think of\nthem?\nAre there such colors?\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, these questions present us with what we might\ncall \u201cthe Problem of Color Realism\u201d. The discussion also\nindicates that finding answers may be a little tricky. (We should also\nnote that there are complexities associated with our understanding of\nRealism, that we will need to slide over\u2014see the entry\non\n realism.)\n\nLet us turn to a more recent description of the problem. Byrne and\nHilbert (2003) say, of the problem of color realism, that it\n\u201cconcerns various especially salient properties that objects\nvisually appear to have\u201d. By way of clarification, they say:\n\n\nIf someone with normal color vision looks at a tomato in good light,\nthe tomato will appear to have a distinctive property\u2014a property\nthat strawberries and cherries also appear to have, and which we call\n\u201cred\u201d in English. The problem of color realism is posed by\nthe following two questions. First, do objects like tomatoes,\nstrawberries and radishes really have the distinctive property that\nthey do appear to have? Second, what is this property? (Byrne &\nHilbert 2003: 3\u20134) \n\n\nIt would seem that Byrne and Hilbert give us another\nexpression\u2014\u201cthe color things appear to be\u201d or\n\u201cthe color things look to have\u201d\u2014to go with our\nearlier expressions, \u201ccolors-as-we-experience-them\u201d,\n\u201ccolors as-we-see-them\u201d. (As we shall see, with each\nexpression, there is an ambiguity which will need to be taken care\nwith, but, it would seem, the same ambiguity applies to each\nexpression.)\n\nThe use of the expression\u201ccolors-as-we-see-them\u201d has\ncertain advantages, in that it brings out certain important features\nof colors. The first is that it implies that a comprehensive account\nof color is going to depend on an account of perceptual experience.\nGiven the controversies on that topic, it is likely to mean that\nsimilar disputes will spill over to the subject of color. For example,\non some views, colors-as-we-see-them will be certain properties\npresented in experience. According to other views, they will be\ncertain properties that material things are represented as having. On\na third view, Color Projectivism, the qualities presented in visual\nexperiences are subjective qualities, which are\n\u2018projected\u2019 on to material objects: the experiences\nrepresent material objects as having the subjective qualities. Those\nqualities are taken by the perceiver to be qualities instantiated on\nthe surfaces of material objects (the perceiver does not ordinarily\nthink of them as subjective qualities).\n\nDeciding the question will depend on theories of representational\ncontent (intentional content) perceptual experiences carry; see the\nentry\n the problem of perception.\n Some important readings that delve, extensively, into these areas are\nByrne & Hilbert 1997 Introduction, Shoemaker 1994 [1997], Chalmers\n2006.\n",
