    "main_text": "Paradox || The Derivation and Dissolution of GP\n4.4 The Derivation and Dissolution of GP\n\nIn the following, we focus on Church\u2019s Russellian resolution of\nGP and leave aside most of the remaining issues. In this we are aided\nby a simplified account of the matter prepared by Church (1995a). The\nsimplification does not omit anything essential to the argument of\nChurch (1976) regarding GP specifically. It is clear that a main\nconcern of Church was to communicate once and for all Russell\u2019s\nresolution of the semantic paradoxes to a wider audience.\n\nChurch\u2019s r-typed Val predicate is rather clumsy, but it\nis required for the generalizations in (1976) to accomplish all the\ngoals listed above. In the simplified account, however, Val is\nreplaced by a denotation predicate \\(D(v, F)\\), where \\(v\\) is a word,\nunderstood to be an individual, and \\(F\\) is a propositional function\nof any r-type. \\(D(v, F)\\) is read \u201c\\(v\\) denotes\n\\(F\\)\u201d. Church remarks that\n\n\nWe shall make use only of the case that the second argument of \\(D\\)\nis a singulary functional variable or singulary functional constant of\nlowest type, so fixing the type of \\(D\\). (1995a [BE: 929])\n\n\nThe r-type of \\(D\\) is then \\((i (i))/1\\), for the purposes\nof the following.\n\nChurch first shows how GP may be derived within STT using certain\nprinciples concerning \\(D\\), the first of which is a principle of\n\u201cunivocacy\u201d:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{*} D(v,F) \\supset_{v F} \\hdot D(v,G) \\supset_{G} \\hdot F(x) \\equiv_{x} G(x).\\]\n\n\n\n(Note the following notational conventions. Firstly, a connective can\ntake a variable as subscript: that variable becomes a universal\nquantifier whose scope is precisely that of the connective. Secondly,\na dot placed before a connective brackets a proposition. The stars are\nalso Church\u2019s notation.) Church decides to avoid the stronger\naxiom asserting that \\(D\\) is functional due to complications\nconcerning identity in the ramified theory, but the effect is the\nsame. The\n axiom *\n guarantees a weaker form of functionality: It is a function from\nwords as individuals to extensions of propositional functions,\nassuming the axiom of extensionality for such extensions. Next Church\ninvokes an informally stated principle that he describes as\n\u201creasonable\u201d:\n\n**\nWhenever an individual or a propositional function has been\ndetermined in some unique way, it is permissible to extend the\nlanguage by introducing a constant (a word) which denotes it.\n\n\nOn this basis, he says, the constant \u201chet\u201d may be\nintroduced together with an axiom defining it implicitly:\n\n\n\\[\\tag*{***} \\het(w) \\equiv_{w} (\\exists F) \\hdot D(w, F) \\cdot \\nsim F(w).\\]\n\n\n\n(Note the difference between the dot placed before the connective and\nthe conjunction sign itself.) By a simple deduction from the three\nstarred principles and basic logic, Church derives both \\(\\het(v)\\)\nand \\(\\nsim \\het(v)\\). Church\u2019s deduction closely resembles one\ngiven by Copi (1971), who attributes it to Ramsey. (See\n supplement F.)\n\nChurch clearly thinks that the starred principles are\n\u201creasonable\u201d and that the only problem is that they make\nuse of an impredicative definition, namely,\n ***,\n and that when the starred principles are suitably ramified, the\nproblem can be solved in the manner Russell (1908) foresaw and\nimplemented, if imperfectly (PM). He remarks that\n\n\n\\[\\tag*{****} \\het^{m+1} (w) \\equiv_{w} (\\exists F^{1/m}) \\hdot D(w,F) \\cdot \\nsim F(w)\\]\n\n\n\nwhich replaces\n ***,\n when level indicators are supplied, defines an infinite list of het\npredicates, \u201chet2\u201d,\n\u201chet3\u201d, \u2026, and the two other starred\nprinciples are also to be supplied with level indicators. Church now\ngives what appears to be a hastily composed list of inferences with\nannotations but no comment. However, Church in effect here proves the\nanalogues of theorems (6) and (7) of (1976), with \\(D\\) in place of\nVal. These are: \n\\[\\tag{\\(6'\\)} \\left[D^{m +1} (v, G^{1/m+1}) \\hdot G(x) \\equiv_{x} \\het^{m+1} (x)\\right] \\supset \\nsim \\het^{n+1} (v), \\textrm{ if } m \\ge n \\]\n \n\\[ \\tag{\\(7'\\)} \\left[D^{m +1} (v, G^{1/m+1}) \\hdot G(x) \\equiv_{x} \\het^{m+1} (x)\\right] \\supset \\het^{n+1} (v), \\textrm{ if } m \\lt n. \\]\n\n\nTo derive these, Church assumes that:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{5} \\het^{n+1} (v) \\supset \\het^{m+1} (v), \\text{ if } m \\ge n.\\]\n\n\n(5) is a theorem of (1976).\n\nNote that, as in the case of Val, the level \\(m+1\\) of \\(D^{m+1}\\) is\ndetermined entirely by the level of its second argument place. (5) is\nneeded as a lemma in the proofs of (\\(6'\\)) and (\\(7'\\)). In (1995a)\nChurch appeals to (5) without comment, perhaps assuming implicitly the\n\\(D\\)-analogue of axiom (4) of (1976) reflecting that the types of the\nsemantical predicates are cumulative\u2014as are the types of (1976)\nin general. It is also worth noting that in the background is an\nr-typed version of the\n principle **\n asserting that at any level \\(m\\) there is a word \\(v\\) denoting a\nproperty having the same extension as \\(\\het^m\\). (Compare theorem (8)\nof (1976).)\n\nIn this scheme, the question whether the word\n\u201cheterological\u201d is heterological becomes the question\nwhether a word \\(v\\) denoting that property, or rather a word with\nsame extension, is heterological; and the answer is that it depends on\nthe level of the property \\(\\het^{m+1}\\).\n\nAt levels equal to or less than \\(m+1\\), \\(\\het(v)\\) is false; that\nis, \\(v\\) is autological. At levels greater than \\(m+1\\), v is\nheterological; this, according to (\\(6'\\)) and (\\(7'\\)). There is,\ntherefore, no one property of heterologicality such that it\nis possible to ask whether a word for it is heterological or not; and\nthis blocks GP.\n\nChurch\u2019s point of view is that the semantical primitives and\nprinciples, including\n **,\n that were added to STT to obtain GP are all \u201creasonable\u201d.\nThe only thing missing is ramification. This is in essence why Church\nthought that RTT provides the framework for the solution to the\nsemantical paradoxes. (For more details see\n supplement F.)\n\nIn an undated typescript newly published in The Collected\nWorks (n.d., [BE: 928]), Church formulates conditions required\nfor the derivation of the Berry paradox within STT and indicates how\nit is resolved in RTT. He uses Val to formulate a condition giving the\n\u201cBerry number\u201d of a formula. His formulation is quite\nsimilar to that found in Boolos et al. [2007: 228). But in this short\nnote he does not give a derivation of the paradox within STT.\n",
