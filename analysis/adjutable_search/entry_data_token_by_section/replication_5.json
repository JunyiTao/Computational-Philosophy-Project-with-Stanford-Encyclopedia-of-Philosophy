Other Examples of Replicators\n\nAlthough Dawkins finds it desirable to replace genes with replicators\nin his general characterization of the evolutionary process, he says\nvery little about this more general notion in The Selfish\nGene. Only one chapter (11) is dedicated to \u201cmemetic\u201d\nevolution. Instead, as we saw, he discusses the special case of genes\nas replicators. The primacy of the genetic perspective in the\ncharacterization of replicators is claimed by some (Griesemer 2000b)\nto be one of the chief weaknesses not only in Dawkins\u2019\ndiscussions but also in the work of his successors [see the section\nbelow on\n Reproducers].\n Hull and his colleagues (Hull, Langman, & Glenn 2001) claim to be\nproviding a general notion of replication, adequate to handle all\ndifferent sorts of replication, when too often we are simply reading\npeculiarities of genetic replication into our general analysis of\nreplication.\n",
