    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as direct analogs || A standard axiomatisation for Euclidean plane geometry\n2.1 A standard axiomatisation for Euclidean plane geometry\n\nWhat does a Hilbert-type axiomatisation look like? The first thing one\nhas to do is to fix a (formal) language. Usually one chooses\nfirst-order predicate logic with identity, i.e., a language containing\nnames for variables (and, possibly, for constants), names for\nfunctions (if necessary), names for predicates including the identity\npredicate, logical connectives and quantifiers, and a set of\ngrammatical rules to form sentences. The restriction to first-order\nlogic means that only variables can be quantified over. Without going\ninto details, it should be remarked that a more expressive language\ncan be chosen, e.g., whereby quantification over predicates is allowed\nas well.\n\nOnce a language has been chosen, the next problem is to determine the\nprimitive terms of the language. For plane Euclidean geometry, these\nare points and lines, although sometimes lines are defined as\nparticular sets of points. Next the basic predicates have to be\nselected. There exist a number of different axiomatisations at the\npresent moment. The most frequently used predicates are: the incidence\nrelation (\u201ca point \\(a\\) lies on a line \\(A\\)\u201d), the\nbetweenness relation (\u201cpoint \\(a\\) lies between points \\(b\\) and\n\\(c\\)\u201d), the equidistance relation (\u201cthe distance from\npoint \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is the same as the distance from point \\(c\\) to\n\\(d\\)\u201d), the congruence relation (\u201ca part of a line,\ndetermined by two point \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is congruent to a part of a\nline, determined by two points \\(c\\) and \\(d\\)\u201d). Note that it\nis not necessary that all of them occur in an axiomatisation. As an\nexample, if lines are not introduced as primitive terms, then usually\nthere is no incidence relation.\n\nThe next step is the introduction of a set of axioms to determine\ncertain properties of the above mentioned relations. As an example, if\nthe axiomatisation uses the incidence relation, then the typical\naxioms for that relation are:\n\nThrough two points exactly one straight line can be drawn.\nThere are at least two points on every straight line.\nThere are at least three points that are not on the same straight\nline.\n\n\nFinally, one looks for an interpretation or a model of the\naxiomatisation. This means that we search for a meaning of the\nprimitive terms, such as points and lines, of the functions (if any)\nand of the predicates in such a way that the axioms become true\nstatements relative to the interpretation. Although we often have a\nparticular interpretation in mind when we develop an axiomatisation,\nit does not exclude the possibility of the existence of rather\nunexpected models. In a sense finitist models rely on this very\npossibility as the next paragraph shows.\n",
