Located in\nItaly\u2019s southern Mezzogiorno, the island of Sardinia\nshared the region\u2019s arid landscape, widespread poverty, and\nfragile social hierarchies. Gramsci was the fifth of seven children\nborn to Giuseppina (n\u00e9e Marcia) and Francesco Gramsci and spent\nhis early childhood near Cagliari, where his family had moved in 1897.\nIn infancy he developed Pott\u2019s Disease, a spinal form of\ntuberculosis that was not properly treated and, as a result, he grew\nup with a \u201chunched\u201d back. He suffered frequent health\nproblems throughout the rest of his life (Davidson 1977:\n22\u201323).\n\nHis father, a local civil servant, was suspended from his job in 1898\non politically motivated charges of corruption (he had supported an\nopposition candidate in local elections) and subsequently sentenced to\nfive years in prison (Davidson 1977: 23\u201325). This brought years\nof terrible hardship for the family, who relocated to the town of\nGhilarza. In 1903 the young Antonio\u2014known as\n\u201cNino\u201d\u2014even suspended his schooling to support his\nfamily by working in a Land Registry office. On his return to\neducation two years later, following his father\u2019s release, he\nprogressed well. A reserved character but an avid reader with a strong\nwill, he entered high school in Cagliari, where he lived with his\nelder brother, Gennaro. Gennaro introduced him to socialist\nliterature, and he began to read Italian critics such as Gaetano\nSalvemini, Giuseppe Prezzolini, and Benedetto Croce, as well as Karl\nMarx. Gramsci shared many Sardinians\u2019 deep resentment at the\nshortcomings of the \u201cliberal\u201d state since its unification\nin the nineteenth century, especially its protectionist policies,\nwhich contributed to the South\u2019s cultural and economic\nunderdevelopment.\n\nIn 1911 Gramsci won a monthly stipend to support his studies at the\nCarlo Alberto College at the University of Turin in the northern\nregion of Piedmont.\n",
