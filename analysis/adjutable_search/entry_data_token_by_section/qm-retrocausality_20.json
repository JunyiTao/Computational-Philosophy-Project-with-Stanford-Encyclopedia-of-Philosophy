    "main_text": "Objections Against Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics || General Arguments Against Retrocausality\n7.1 General Arguments Against Retrocausality\n\nThere is a tradition in philosophy for regarding the very idea of\nretrocausality as incoherent. The most prominent worry (Flew 1954,\nBlack 1956), is the so-called \u201cbilking argument\u201d (see the\nentry on\n time travel).\n Imagine a pair of events, a cause, C, and an effect, E,\nwhich we believe to be retrocausally connected (E occurs\nearlier in time than C). It seems possible to devise an\nexperiment which could confirm whether our belief in the retrocausal\nconnection is correct or not. Namely, once we had observed that\nE had occurred, we could then set about ensuring that C\ndoes not occur, thereby breaking any retrocausal connection that could\nhave existed between them. If we were successful in doing this, then\nthe effect would have been \u201cbilked\u201d of its cause.\n\nThe bilking argument drives one towards the claim that any belief an\nagent might hold in the positive retrocausal correlation between event\nC and event E is simply false. However, Dummett (1964)\ndisputes that giving up this belief is the only solution to the\nbilking argument. Rather, according to Dummett, what the bilking\nargument actually shows is that a set of three conditions concerning\nthe two events, and the agent\u2019s relationship to them, is\nincoherent:\n\nThere exists a positive correlation between an event C and\nan event E.\nEvent C is within the power of an agent to perform.\nThe agent has epistemic access to the occurrence of event E\nindependently of any intention to bring it about.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that these conditions do not specify in\nwhich order events C and E occur. On simple reflection,\nthere is a perfectly natural reason why it is not possible to bilk\nfuture effects of their causes, since condition (iii) fails\nto hold for future events: we simply have no access to which future\nevents occur independently of the role we play as causal agents to\nbring the events about. When we lack that epistemic access to past\nevents, the same route out of the bilking argument becomes\navailable.\n\nDummett\u2019s defense against the bilking argument is especially\nrelevant to quantum mechanics. In fact, once a suitable specification\nis made of how condition (iii) can be violated, we find that there\nexists a strong parallel between the conditions which need to hold to\njustify a belief in bringing about the past and the structure of\nquantum mechanics. Price (1996: 174) points out that bilking is\nimpossible in the following circumstances: rather than suppose that a\nviolation of condition (iii) entails that the relevant agent has\nno epistemic access to the relevant past events independently\nof any intention to bring them about, suppose that the means by which\nknowledge of these past events is gathered breaks the claimed\ncorrelation between the agent\u2019s action and those past events.\nSuch a condition can be stated as follows:\n\nThe agent can gain epistemic access to the occurrence of event\nE independently of any intention to bring it about and without\naltering event E from what it would have been had no epistemic\naccess been gained.\n\n\nThe significance of this weakened violation of condition (iii) is that\nit is just the sort of condition one would expect to hold if the\nsystem in question were a quantum system. The very nature of quantum\nmechanics ensures that any claimed positive correlation between the\nfuture measurement settings and the hidden variables characterizing a\nquantum system cannot possibly be bilked of their causes because\ncondition (iv) is perennially violated. Moreover, so long as we\nsubscribe to the epistemic interpretation of the wavefunction, we lack\nepistemic access to the \u201chidden\u201d variables of the system\nand we lack this access in principle as a result of the\nstructure of quantum theory.\n\nAnother prominent challenge against the very idea of retrocausality is\nthat it inevitably would give rise to vicious causal loops (Mellor\n1998). (See Faye 1994 for a response and the entry on\n backward causation\n for a more detailed review of the objections raised against the idea\nof retrocausality.)\n",
