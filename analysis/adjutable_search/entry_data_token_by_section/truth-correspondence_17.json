    "main_text": "The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors || Truthmaker Theory\n8.5 Truthmaker Theory\n\n\nThis approach centers on the truthmaker\nor truthmaking principle: Every truth has a\ntruthmaker; or alternatively: For every truth there is something that\nmakes it true. The principle is usually understood as an expression of\na realist attitude, emphasizing the crucial contribution the world\nmakes to the truth of a proposition. Advocates tend to treat\ntruthmaker theory primarily as a guide to ontology, asking: To\nentities of what ontological categories are we committed as\ntruthmakers of the propositions we accept as true? Most advocates\nmaintain that propositions of different logical types can be made true\nby items from different ontological categories: e.g., propositions of\nsome types are made true by facts, others just by individual things,\nothers by events, others by tropes (cf., e.g. Armstrong 1997). This is\nclaimed as a significant improvement over traditional correspondence\ntheories which are understood\u2014correctly in most but by no means\nall cases\u2014to be committed to all truthmakers belonging to a\nsingle ontological category (albeit disagreeing about which category\nthat is). All advocates of truthmaker theory maintain that the\ntruthmaking relation is not one-one but many-many: some truths are\nmade true by more than one truthmaker; some truthmakers make true more\nthan one truth. This is also claimed as a significant improvement over\ntraditional correspondence theories which are often portrayed as\ncommitted to correspondence being a one-one relation. This portrayal\nis only partly justified. While it is fairly easy to find real-life\ncorrespondence theorists committing themselves to the view that each\ntruth corresponds to exactly one fact (at least by implication,\ntalking about the corresponding fact), it is difficult to\nfind real-life correspondence theorists committing themselves to the\nview that only one truth can correspond to a given fact (but see Moore\n1910-11, p. 256).\n\n\nA truthmaker theory may be presented as a competitor to the\ncorrespondence theory or as a version of the correspondence\ntheory. This depends considerably on how narrowly or broadly one\nconstrues \u201ccorrespondence theory\u201d, i.e. on terminological\nissues. Some advocates would agree with Dummett (1959, p. 14) who said\nthat, although \u201cwe have nowadays abandoned the correspondence\ntheory of truth\u201d, it nevertheless \u201cexpresses one important\nfeature of the concept of truth\u2026: that a statement is true only\nif there is something in the world in virtue of which it is\ntrue\u201d. Other advocates would follow Armstrong who tends to\npresent his truthmaker theory as a liberal form of correspondence\ntheory; indeed, he seems committed to the view that the truth of a\n(contingent) elementary proposition consists in its\ncorrespondence with some (atomic) fact (cf. Armstrong 1997; 2004,\npp. 22-3, 48-50).\n\n\nIt is not easy to find a substantive difference between truthmaker\ntheory and various brands of the sort of modified correspondence\ntheory treated above under the heading \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d\n(see Section 7.1). Logical atomists, such as Russell (1918) and\nWittgenstein (1921), will hold that the truth or falsehood of every\ntruth-value bearer can be explained in terms of (can be derived from)\nlogical relations between truth-value bearers, by way of the recursive\nclauses, together with the base clauses, i.e., the correspondence and\nnon-correspondence of elementary truth-value bearers with facts. This\nrecursive strategy could be pursued with the aim to reject the\ntruthmaker principle: not all truths have truthmakers, only\nelementary truths have truthmakers (here understood as corresponding\natomic facts). But it could also be pursued\u2014and this seems to\nhave been Russell\u2019s intention at the time\u2014with the aim\nto secure the truthmaker principle, even though the simple\ncorrespondence definition has been abandoned: not every truth\ncorresponds to a fact, only elementary truths do, but every\ntruth has a truthmaker; where the recursive clauses are\nsupposed to show how truthmaking without correspondence, but grounded\nin correspondence, comes about.\n\n\nThere is one straightforward difference between truthmaker theory and\nmost correspondence theories. The latter are designed to answer the\nquestion \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d. Simple (unmodified)\ncorrespondence theories center on a biconditional, such as\n\u201cx is true iff x corresponds to a fact\u201d,\nintended to convey a definition of truth (at least a\n\u201creal definition\u201d which does not commit them to the claim\nthat the term \u201ctrue\u201d is synonymous with \u201ccorresponds\nto a fact\u201d\u2014especially nowadays most correspondence\ntheorists would consider such a claim to be implausibly and\nunnecessarily bold). Modified correspondence theories also aim at\nproviding a definition of truth, though in their case the definition\nwill be considerably more complex, owing to the recursive character of\nthe account. Truthmaker theory, on the other hand, centers on\nthe truthmaker principle: For every truth there is something\nthat makes it true. Though this principle will deliver the\nbiconditional \u201cx is true iff something makes x\ntrue\u201d (since \u201csomething makes x true\u201d\ntrivially implies \u201cx is true\u201d), this does not\nyield a promising candidate for a definition of truth: defining truth\nin terms of truthmaking would appear to be circular. Unlike most\ncorrespondence theories, truthmaker theory is not equipped, and\nusually not designed, to answer the question \u201cWhat is\ntruth?\u201d\u2014at least not if one expects the answer to take the\nform of a feasible candidate for a definition of truth.\n\n\nThere is a growing body of literature on truthmaker theory; see for\nexample: Russell 1918; Mullligan, Simons, and Smith 1984; Fox 1987;\nArmstrong 1997, 2004; Merricks 2007; and the essays in Beebe and Dodd\n2005; Monnoyer 2007; and in Lowe and Rami 2009.
