    "main_text": "Quantum Chaos || The Validity of the Correspondence\n6.3 The Validity of the Correspondence Principle\n\nThe kind of behavior observed in quantum chaology involves the\nstatistics of energy states in quantum systems that have some kind of\nrelationship to classical chaotic systems (e.g., by quantizing the\nlatter systems). Important features of classical chaos, such as SDIC\nand the period doubling route to chaos, appear to be absent from\nquantum systems. This situation has led to arguments that the\ncorrespondence principle between quantum and classical mechanics fails\nand that the former may be incomplete (Ford 1992).\n\n\nThe correspondence principle can be understood broadly to mean that as\na quantum system system is scaled up to macroscopic size, its behavior should become more like a classical system. Alternatively, the behavior of a quantum model should reproduce the behavior of macroscopic classical models in the limit of large quantum numbers. The correspondence principle is sometimes conceived as letting Planck\u2019s constant\ngo to zero. Nevertheless,\nall these conceptions are terribly inadequate. Since \\(h\\) is a\nconstant of nature, it can never change value, much less go to\nzero. One always has to speak of relevant limits of ratios of the classical to\nquantum actions, for example, which always involve Planck\u2019s\nconstant. Moreover, these limits are singular, meaning\nthat the smooth behavior of a quantity or pattern is disrupted, often\nby becoming infinite (Friedrichs 1955; Dingle 1973; Primas 1998). So\nthere is no straightforward sense in which quantum models become\nincreasingly similar to macroscopic systems as quantum numbers get\nlarge.\n\n\nJoseph Ford offers a different construal of the correspondence\nprinciple: \u201cany two valid physical theories which have an\noverlap in their domains of validity must, to relevant accuracy, yield\nthe same predictions for physical observations.\u201d In the case of\nquantum and Newtonian mechanics, this means that \u201cquantum\nmechanics must, in general agree with the predictions of Newtonian\nmechanics when the systems under study are macroscopic\u201d (1992,\np. 1087). Unfortunately, he gives no discussion of what \u201cdomains\nof validity\u201d mean or in what sense quantum and Newtonian\nmechanics have some overlap in their domains of validity. What he\nclaims in his American Journal of Physics article is that\n\u201cThe very essence of correspondence lies in the notion that\nquantum mechanics can describe events in the macroscopic world without\nany limit taking. Were this not the case, then there would be no\noverlap in the quantal and classical regions of validity\u201d (1992,\np. 1088). Sir Michael Berry is even more direct: \u201call\nsystems,\u201d even our orbiting moon, \u201cobey the laws of\nquantum mechanics\u201d (Berry 2001, p. 42). The upshot for chaos is\nthat \u201cif there is chaos (however defined) in the macroscopic\nworld, quantum mechanics must also exhibit precisely the same chaos,\nelse quantum mechanics is not as general a theory as popularly\nsupposed\u201d (Ford 1992, p. 1088).\n\n\nAs seen above, classical chaotic behavior is not recovered in quantum\nchaology, and this leads to a dilemma: Either the correspondence\nprinciple is false or quantum mechanics is incomplete. Ford, as would\nmost physicists, rejects the first horn of the dilemma. Therefore, the\nproblem must lie with quantum mechanics: Its lack of chaos reveals\nsome incompleteness in the theory. Something is missing.\n\n\nThis dilemma is false, however. The way Ford (and to some degree Berry\namong others) describes things bespeaks a common misconception of the\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. Much as he\nmakes of the subtlety of limiting relations\u2014and they are much\nmore subtle than he realizes\u2014his discussion of the\ncorrespondence principle actually turns on an overly simple\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. That overly\nsimple relationship presupposes that quantum mechanics fully explains\nclassical phenomena, or, alternatively, that quantum mechanics reduces\nthe classical domain in an appropriate limit. Under such a\npresupposition, if classical chaos either does not exist in quantum\nmechanics or if the latter cannot explain or reproduce classical\nchaos, then it appears that there is some inadequacy with quantum\nmechanics.\n\n\nThe relationship between the quantum and classical domains is\nnontrivial. First, it does not involve a \u201cclassical\nlimit,\u201d but a series of limits of the ratio of quantum\nobservables involving Planck\u2019s constant and other physical\nobservables going to zero (e.g., relevant classical and quantum actions),\nor limits involving the separation of nuclear and electronic frames of\nmotion (in the case of chemistry) among others. All of these limits\ninvolve singular asymptotic series; hence, the relationship between\nquantum phenomena and classical phenomena is not one involving\nanything like bridge laws relating the two domains as Nagelian and\nother forms of reduction would require. There is a change in the\ncharacter of the states and observables going from the quantum to the\nclassical domains (Bishop, 2010b). The classical states and\nobservables are neither a function of nor straightforwardly\nrelated to intrinsic states and observables in quantum mechanics.\n\n\nSecond, even starting with the quantum domain, there are different\nclassical worlds that result from taking these various limits in\ndifferent orders. Since these limits correspond to different physical\ntransitions, changing the order of the limits changes the order of\nphysical transitions yielding physically inequivalent macroscopic\ndomains. Given the physical incompatibility among these different\nmacroscopic worlds, the actual physical transitions between the quantum\nand classical must occur in a particular order to recover the\nclassical domain of our experience.\n\n\nOf course, there is much discussion of the \u201capproximately\nclassical\u201d or \u201cquasi-classical\u201d trajectories for\nquantum systems that can be derived from semi-classical considerations\n(Berry 1987 and 2001). But such quasi-classical behavior is exhibited\nonly for limited times (except for overly idealized models) and under\nvery special initial conditions (Pauli 1933, p. 166) for ground\nstates only (excited energy eigenstates never show classical\nbehavior). Appeal to Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem is of no help, here,\nbecause all this theorem guarantees for such very special, short-lived\ndynamics is that the usual physics practice of averaging the values of\nthe quantum-mechanical observables tends to wash out the errors or\ndifferences between the classical and quantum calculations for\ncontextually relevant situations and times. Moreover, the theorem is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for classical behavior. For instance,\napplying Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem to a quantum harmonic oscillator\nyields average quantities for the position and momentum that track\nwith the classical quantities for some brief time. Yet, the quantum\noscillator\u2019s discrete states yield thermodynamic properties very\ndifferent from a classical oscillator. So satisfying the theorem is\ninsufficient to guarantee classical behavior.\n\n\nThird, the emergence of our classical world is not merely a matter of\nenvironmental decoherence (e.g., Omn\u00e9s 1994; Berry 2001;\nWallace 2012). For one thing, there is no context-free limit of\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom because this limit always has\nuncountably infinitely many physically inequivalent\nrepresentations. Moreover, it is simply false that an improper mixture\nof quantum states \u201callows one to interpret the state of the\n[quantum] system in terms of a classical probability\ndistribution,\u201d such that \u201cit is useful to regard\n\u2018mixed states\u2019 as effectively classical,\u201d so that\n\u201cone can interpret the system described by [a nonpure density\noperator] in terms of a classical \u2018mixture\u2019 with the exact\nstate of the system unknown to the observer\u201d (Zurek 1991,\n46\u201347). Impure quantum states can be interpreted as classical\nmixtures if and only if their components are described by\ndisjoint states. For a classical mixture of two pure states (e.g.,\nwater and oil), the pure states are disjoint if and only if there\nexists a classical observable such that the expectation values with\nrespect to these states are different. It is this disjointness that\nmakes it possible to distinguish states in a classical manner.\n\n\nIn summary, there is nothing in the quantum domain by itself that\ndetermines the character of the classical domain (though the former\nprovides some necessary conditions for the latter). Hence, classical\nchaos, along with many other classical features, is emergent in a more\ncomplex, subtle sense than Ford and others allow. The correspondence\nprinciple must reflect emergent classicality if it is to be a viable\nprinciple, which means that the implicit assumption of reductionism in\nFord\u2019s discussions of quantum chaology should be abandoned. Once the\nreductionist assumption is removed, the disparity between quantum\nchaology and classical chaos no longer calls an appropriately\nformulated correspondence principle into question. This resolves the\nfirst horn of the dilemma.\n\n\nThe second horn of the dilemma likewise is resolved. There is no\nreason to suspect that there is some kind of inadequacy in quantum\nmechanics if features such as chaos are emergent in the classical\ndomain. Neither the generality nor the validity of quantum mechanics\nis in question. Nor does the complex, subtle emergent relationship\nbetween the quantum and classical domains imply that the two domains\nare nonoverlapping or disjoint. Rather, the overlap between the\nquantum and classical is partial and nontrivial. Quantum mechanics is\nuniversally applicable, but this in no way implies that it alone\nuniversally governs classical behavior. It contributes some of the\nnecessary conditions for classical properties and behaviors, but no\nsufficient conditions. One indicator of this is that\nclassical mechanics is formulated in terms of continuous trajectories\nof individual particles through spacetime, while quantum mechanics is\nformulated in terms of probabilities and wave functions. There are\ndeep conceptual differences between the classical and the\nquantum.[13]\nThis suggests that we should not expect individual continuous\ntrajectories to result from quantum mechanics in contextually\ninappropriate limits nor that quantum mechanics should exhibit the full\nrange of classical behaviors, contrary to Ford and others. Instead, we\nshould expect that quantum probabilities recover the classical\nprobabilities in the contextually appropriate situations and that\nthere should be some interesting relationships between quantum and\nclassical properties and behaviors. The interesting statistical\nregularities discovered in quantum chaology fit with this emergent,\nnontrival overlapping relationship nicely.\n\n",
