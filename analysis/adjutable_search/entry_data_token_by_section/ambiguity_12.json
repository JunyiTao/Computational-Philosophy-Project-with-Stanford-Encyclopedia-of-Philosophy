    "main_text": "Detecting Ambiguity || Conjunction Reduction\n4.1 Conjunction Reduction\n\nA standard test for ambiguity is to take two sentences that contain\nthe purportedly ambiguous term and conjoin them by using the term only\nonce in contexts where both meanings are encouraged. For example,\n\u2018light\u2019 is a predicate that can enjoy the same meaning as\neither \u2018not dark\u2019 or \u2018not heavy\u2019.\n\nThe colours are light.\nThe feathers are light.\n\n\nThe following, however, seems to be zeugmatic:\n\n?The colours and the feathers are light.\n\n\nThe reduced sentence is zeugmatic for obvious reasons. This is\nevidence for ambiguity (or polysemy) in \u2018light\u2019. On the\nother hand, \u2018exist\u2019, which has been claimed to be\nambiguous, seems not to display such zeugmatic effects:\n\nToronto exists.\nNumbers exist.\nTriadic relations exist.\nToronto and numbers and triadic relations exist.\n\n\nThe test is limited in one way. If a term can be ambiguous but in a\nway so subtle that competent speakers may miss it, then the zeugma might not be\nnoticeable. Given that these tests try to draw on linguistic judgments\nto detect ambiguity, it\u2019s not clear how to proceed when there is\na case of disagreement over the presence of zeugma.\n\nWe can use the test in cases in which one wouldn\u2019t necessarily\nexpect zeugma, but merely lack of multiple interpretations. For\nexample:\n\nHan and Chewbacca used superfluous hair removers.\n\n\n(51) doesn\u2019t allow a reading on which Han used a hair remover\nthat was superfluous and Chewbacca used a remover of superfluous hair.\nIf multiple interpretations are impossible, there is evidence of\nambiguity. This is to be expected since the point of conjunction\nreduction is to \u2018freeze\u2019 the syntactic structure and in\nambiguous cases, the effect is achieved.\n\nAs mentioned above, conjunction reduction has been used to argue that\ncollective-distributive ambiguities are due to an ambiguity in the\nsubject phrase. Consider:\n\nJohn and Jane moved a piano.\n\n\nOne might think that the readings are generated by an ambiguity in\n\u2018and\u2019: sometimes it acts as a sentential operator and\nsometimes as a term-forming operator that makes two names into a\nsingle term for predication. However, notice that there are some\npredicates that can only be (sensibly) interpreted collectively, such\nas \u2018met\u2019:\n\nJohn and Jane met for lunch.\n\n\nIn this case, there is no sense to be made of \u2018John met for\nlunch and Jane met for lunch\u2019 and so the sentential conjunction\nreading is not available. Using conjunction reduction on (52) and (53)\nwe get:\n\nJohn and Jane moved a piano and met for lunch.\n\n\n(54) has a reading on which \u2018moved the piano\u2019 is\ninterpreted distributively (two liftings) and \u2018met\u2019 is\nread collectively. The felicity of the conjunction reduced (54)\nsuggests that the ambiguity isn\u2019t the result of an ambiguity in\nconjunction. (see Schein (2006), McKay (2006)). We can try to use\nthe test in an extended manner on full sentences if we embed them\nunder \u2018says that\u2019 or perhaps \u2018believes that\u2019:\n\u2018John and Adam believe that Sarah bought a superfluous hair\nremover\u2019 is infelicitous if the unconjoined sentences involve\ndifferent interpretations of \u2018superfluous hair\nremover\u2019.\n\nThe test has certain weaknesses. In actual utterances, intonation can\nbe used to indicate an assertion or an each question (\u2018Ben\nwanted to eat that?) conjoined with \u2018Ben wanted to eat\nthat\u2019 yields an infelicity even if the demonstrative has the\nsame value on both occasions \u2013 though we may try to fix things up\nby demanding that the test be run using common intonation (at least in\nspoken uses of the test!). On that note, the test will judge\ndemonstrative and indexicals to be ambiguous since they are famously\nnot generally conjunction reducible. Similar worries concern polysemy and ambiguity, which conjunction reduction may be overly sensitive to (See Viebahn (2016) for relevant considerations).\n",
