    "main_text": "Individuation\n4. Individuation\n\nAmong the issues Kilwardby has changed his mind about during his\ncareer is the principle of individuation: whearas in his Parisian\nperiod he assigns to matter the role of the cause of individuation\n(NSLP 7, 39), in the mature works of his Oxford and Canterbury stay,\nhe claims that the principle of individuation is matter and\nform.\n\nA main tenet in Kilwardby\u2019s ontology is that every thing that exists\noutside the soul either exists in an individual or is itself an\nindividual (QLIIS 17, 64). As all substances are composites of matter\nand form, matter and form are the two possible causes of\nindividuation. It cannot be matter on its own because matter receives\nits determinations from form. It could be form, but in this case it\nwould be either accidental or substantial form. He promptly dismisses\nthe first possibility, since accidents can only inhere in an already\nconstituted primary substance, that is, they follow the constitution\nof an individual substance rather than explain the constitution of\nthat substance as an individual. This is not to say, he points out,\nthat there are individuals without accidents: a sublunary,\ncorporeal individual is always temporally and spatially located,\neven though one can think of an individual without reference to this\nparticular place and time (QLIIS 17, 68).\n\nHis final answer is that both matter and form are principles of\nindividuation: matter as the passive cause (causa receptiva;\nhe also calls it the causa sine qua non), form as the active\ncause (QLIIS 17, 64). Individuation is achieved when the last species\n(the species specialissima) completes the individual (QLIIS\n17, 67). Form, arriving at matter, designates matter and designating\nmatter, designates itself. The designative action (signatio)\nof form on matter is the cause of an actual existing being (QLIS\n71).\n\nThe distinctive property of the individual as such is precisely this\nactual existence (actualis exsistentia: QLIIS 17, 65; QLIII1S\n9, 39). Kilwardby rejects the view that individuals have an essence in\naddition to the form of the species: there are no individual forms,\nonly individuated forms. Otherwise, he argues, the essence of the\nindividual would be distinct from the essence of the universal, and\neach individual would be made of two essences (Lewry 1978, 246). The\nindividual has only matter in addition to the\n species.[10]\n What Kilwardby means is that the individuated form of the species is\naccidental to the species because a particular instantiation is\nirrelevant to the species\u2014even if it is essential to the\nindividual as such\u2014as there would be no individual without a\nform of the species (QLIIS 17, 65). This idea is the basis of\nKilwardby\u2019s moderate realism of universals and his doctrine of the\nplurality of substantial forms: universal forms\u2014genera and\nspecies\u2014exist in individual things as their constituents, but as\nsuch (that is, as forms existing in individual things) they are not\nuniversal forms but individuated and individuating forms. As universal\nforms, they exist in the intellect only, by abstraction from the\nindividuals that instantiate them. There is in the world outside the\nmind no universal human being aside from individual human beings.\n",
