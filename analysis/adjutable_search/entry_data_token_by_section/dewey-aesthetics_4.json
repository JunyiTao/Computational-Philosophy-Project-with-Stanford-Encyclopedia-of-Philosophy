    "main_text": "Art as Experience || Aesthetic Experience\n2.3 Aesthetic Experience\n\nWhat, then, is an aesthetic experience for Dewey? His account can be\nregarded as a form of \u201cinternalism\u201d, in that it seeks to\nseparate aesthetic experience from other types of experience by\nlooking at its internal qualities, that is, at what aesthetic\nexperience feels like from the inside (Shelley 2009 [2017]).\n\nAesthetic experience marks for Dewey a unique experience, which shows\nwhat experience at its best can be in all quarters of life, not just\nin art; \u201cesthetic experience is experience in its\nintegrity\u201d (AE: 278). It is a distinctive kind of\nexperiential condensation within the general stream of experience. It\nis the most important specimen of a form of experience that Dewey\nterms \u201can experience\u201d, often italicizing the\nindefinite article of this concept to emphasize the standout character\nof the referred experience. In \u201can experience\u201d\nthe material of experience is fulfilled, consummated, and forms an\nintegral whole, as for example, when a game is played through, a\nconversation is rounded out or when we finish \u201cthat meal in a\nParis restaurant\u201d (AE: 43).\n\nDewey never puts forth an explicit definition of aesthetic experience\nin terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. However, certain\nfeatures recur in his numerous discussions. Most importantly,\naesthetic experience has a temporal structure. Aesthetic experience is\nsomething that develops and attains specific qualities as the\nexperience proceeds. It is in this sense \u201cdynamic because it\ntakes time to complete\u201d (AE: 62). To qualify as an\naesthetic experience, there must, moreover, be accumulation\nbetween the different phases of the experience: aesthetic experience\nincludes a sense that the later phases build on earlier ones and carry\nthem further rather than just mechanically following them. Aesthetic\nexperiences are also intensive; they condense, for example,\nemotional and formal features to a single experience. Another key\nquality of aesthetic experience is a feeling of resistance.\nThese resistances are not obstacles: they feed the experience\u2019s\ndevelopment and accumulation and are converted into movement toward a\nclose. In aesthetic experience, the experiencer is also overcome by a\nsense of rhythm. Aesthetic experience has an internal\nmomentum and, already from the initial phases, the\nexperiencer can feel a sense of direction in it. In other\nwords, in an aesthetic experience \u201cevery successive part flows\nfreely, without seam and without unfilled blanks, into what\nensues\u201d. Moreover, \u201cas one part leads to another and as\none part carries on what went before, each gains distinctness in\nitself\u201d (AE: 43). Aesthetic experience also does not\nterminate at some random point. Rather, its close is a summation of\nits earlier phases, either in the sense that the energy that has\ngathered up during the experience is released or the experience\nreaches a fulfillment in some other sense. In short,\naesthetic experience involves \u201cinception, development, and\nfulfillment\u201d (AE: 62).\n\nFrom a Deweyan viewpoint, aesthetic experience, then, has roughly the\nfollowing structure. The experience is set off by some factors, such\nas opening a book, directing a first glance at a painting, beginning\nto listen to a piece of music, entering a natural environment or a\nbuilding, or beginning a meal or a conversation. As aesthetic\nexperience is temporal, the material of the experience does not remain\nunchanged, but the elements initiating the experience, like reading\nthe first lines of a book or hearing the first chord of a symphony,\nmerge into new ones as the experience proceeds and complex\nrelationships are formed between its past and newer phases. When these\ndifferent parts form a distinctive kind of orderly developing unity\nthat stands out from the general experiential stream of our lives, the\nexperience in question is aesthetic.\n\nDewey contrasts aesthetic to \u201cinchoate\u201d and\n\u201canesthetic\u201d experiences. These experiences, too, have a\ntemporal dimension, but instead of exhibiting the unified development\nas an aesthetic experience, they include \u201choles\u201d,\n\u201cmechanical junctions\u201d, and \u201cdead centres\u201d\n(AE: 43). The different phases of the experience merely\nfollow each other, but in no way develop or build on the earlier\nphases. There is no sense of the kind of \u201ccontinuous\nmerging\u201d that characterizes aesthetic experience. Due to their\npunctured and mechanical quality, inchoate and anesthetic experiences\nalso lack the ordered development that is a condition of an\nexperience\u2019s aesthetic fulfillment. The anesthetic experience is\na function either of loose succession or mechanical connection of\nparts. As Dewey explains,\n\n\nThings happen, but they are neither definitely included nor decisively\nexcluded; we drift\u2026 There are beginnings and cessations, but no\ngenuine initiations and concludings. One thing replaces another, but\ndoes not absorb it, carry it on. There is experience, but so slack and\ndiscursive that it is not an experience. (AE:\n46\u201347)\n\n\nGiven the general character of aesthetic experience, it is no surprise\nthat Dewey attributes such high significance to it in his late\nnaturalist philosophy. Aesthetic experience shows how complex and\nmeaningful the experiences which emerge from the basic factors of all\ninteraction\u2014sense of direction, resistance, rhythm,\naccumulation\u2014can be. Dewey\u2019s aesthetic theory is\nnaturalist precisely in the sense that even an experience as complex\nas aesthetic experience is seen as continuous with the interaction\nthat he believes characterizes the relationship of even the simplest\nbiological organisms to their environments. Similarly, art is only one\nof the many practices and areas of life which can be sources of\naesthetic experience. Conversation, for example, is one such everyday\nactivity, for it can exhibit the kind of \u201ccontinuous interchange\nand blending\u201d which Dewey thinks is essential to aesthetic\nexperience (AE: 43).\n\nDewey also argues that there is no reason to think of such conceptual\ncategories as \u201cthe practical\u201d or \u201cthe\nintellectual\u201d as some way contradictory to the supposedly pure\nand non-utilitarian category of \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d. It is\npossible to have aesthetic experiences while engaging with practical\nand intellectual activities. The aesthetic status of the experiences\nhad in these connections, again, depends solely on the\nexperiences\u2019 internal qualities; even \u201ca mechanic\u201d\nand \u201ca surgeon\u201d can be \u201cartistically engaged\u201d\nin Dewey\u2019s sense (AE: 11, 103). The practical and the\nintellectual should not, thereby, be considered \u201cthe enemies of\nthe esthetic\u201d: the real enemies are \n\n\nthe humdrum; slackness of loose ends; submission to convention in\npractice and intellectual procedure. (AE: 47) \n\n\nAesthetic experience, in fact, is something that precisely ties the\npractical, the emotional, and the intellectual into \u201ca single\nwhole\u201d (AE: 61). Upon reflection it is in many cases\npossible to disentangle these different strands, but in the moment of\nexperience they are all active in constituting aesthetic experience\nfor the whole that it is.\n\nDewey\u2019s description of aesthetic experience as a process of both\ndoing and undergoing is still worth noting, as it appears widely in\nthe commentary literature. With this conceptual pair, Dewey draws\nattention to the kind of interplay between activity and passivity that\nhe thinks aesthetic experience involves. The development of an\naesthetic experience often requires effort and imaginative activity\nfrom the experiencer, but these moments of doing are also joined with\nphases when the object or the environment is felt to take the lead in\nthe experience without any real sense of doing from the experiencer.\nUndergoing is the receptive phase of the experience, the taking in of\nenergy, which the experiencer can, then, more consciously work on. A\nbalance between these experiential phases represents for Dewey an\nideal of all experience and, again, aesthetic experience becomes an\nacute expression of the potentialities that Dewey believes are\ninherent in the basic interaction between the live creature and its\nenvironment; \n\n\nart, in its form, unites the very same relation of doing and\nundergoing, outgoing and incoming energy, that makes an experience to\nbe an experience. (AE: 54)\n\n\nThe concepts of doing and undergoing also lead Dewey to emphasize the\nsimilarities between the work of an artist and the undertakings\nrequired from the audience of art. The final artwork is, among other\nthings, the result of planning, choosing, highlighting, clarifying,\nsimplifying, and other ways of organizing and reorganizing material.\nIn Dewey\u2019s view, the experiencer does not just take in\n\u201cwhat is there in finished form\u201d: he or she should achieve\na sense of the possibilities and challenges that the artist faced in\nher work, as well as the decisions she took out of which the work grew\nto its finished form. Both the making of art and experiencing of art\nare, thereby, \n\n\nprocess[es] consisting of a series of responsive acts that accumulate\ntoward objective fulfillment. (AE: 58) \n\n\nIn this sense, aesthetic experience is for Dewey a kind of mirror\nimage of the artist\u2019s activities. It means \u201c[the]\nrecreation of the object\u201d (AE: 60). \n",
