    "main_text": "Rules, Meaning, and Content\n1. Rules, Meaning, and Content\n\nWhat does the notion of rule-following have to do with the notions of\nlinguistic meaning and mental content? For our purposes, the important\npoint is that meaning something by a linguistic expression is\nanalogous to following a rule. Suppose I write out the beginning of an\narithmetical series \n\n\\[\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nIf the rule I\u2019m following is add 2, the\ncontinuation \n\n\\[\n12, 14, 16, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nis correct, in that it accords with the rule I\u2019m\nfollowing, while the continuation \n\n\\[\n13, 19, 20, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nis incorrect, in that it fails to accord with the rule\nI\u2019m following.\n\nWe have here an analogy with my meaning something by a linguistic\nexpression. Say that I mean blue by \u2018blue\u2019. Then,\n\u2018blue\u2019 is correctly applicable to, for example, a US\npostbox but not to a ripe (Roma) tomato. We can express this point by saying\nthat the former application accords with the predicate\u2019s meaning\nwhile the latter application fails to do so. Given this analogy,\narguments about rule-following have consequences for our conception of\nlinguistic meaning: if an argument shows that there are no facts about\nwhich rule an agent is following, it may also show that there are no\nfacts about what a speaker means by a linguistic expression.\n\nNote that the notion of accord in play in the case of following a rule\nis also in play in our conception of mental states with intentional\ncontent generally. Say that one intends to attend the performance of\nSartre\u2019s play No Exit at the Hopewell Theatre on\nWednesday. Then, one\u2019s attending the performance at the Hopewell\non Wednesday accords with one\u2019s intention (in the sense that it\nfulfils it), while one\u2019s staying at home to grade logic exams\nfails to accord with it. Say that one believes that the cat is on the\nmat. Then, the state of affairs in which the cat is on the mat accords\nwith one\u2019s belief (in the sense that it renders it true), while\nthe state of affairs in which the cat is on the roof does not. Say\nthat one desires to smoke a Bolivar Number 3. Then,\none\u2019s smoking a Bolivar Number 3 accords with\none\u2019s desire (in the sense that it satisfies it), while\none\u2019s smoking a Caf\u00e9 Cr\u00e8me does not\naccord with it. Given this, arguments about rule-following have\nconsequences for our conception of mental content: if an argument\nshows that there are no facts about what rule an agent is following,\nit may also show that there are no facts about the contents of a\nthinker\u2019s mental states.\n\nBefore considering the arguments themselves, we\u2019ll pause to\nreflect on views about the relative priority of linguistic meaning and\nmental content, and on what presuppositions are required in order for\nthe arguments to be run.\n\nIn his influential 1989 survey, Paul Boghossian distinguishes between\ntwo broad types of view:\n\nThe Sellarsian View: the notion of linguistic meaning is\nexplanatorily prior to the notion of mental content (Sellars\n1956).\nThe Gricean View: the notion of mental content is\nexplanatorily prior to the notion of linguistic meaning (Grice\n1989).\n\n\nBoghossian suggests that, irrespective of which of these views is\nadopted, it will not be possible to develop a sceptical argument that\nexclusively targets linguistic meaning. On the Sellarsian View, the\nconclusion that there are no facts about linguistic meaning will\nensure that there are no facts about mental content, since on that\nview it is from the former sort of fact that the latter sort of fact\nwould have to be derived. On the Gricean view, raising a sceptical\ndoubt about linguistic meaning cannot be done without raising a\nsceptical doubt about mental content.\n\nWe would add a third possible view:\n\nThe Davidsonian View: the notions of mental content and\nlinguistic meaning are explanatorily interdependent; neither takes\nexplanatory priority over the other (Davidson 1984, 2001).\n\n\nClearly, on the Davidsonian view, one cannot pose a sceptical threat\nto the existence of facts about the meanings of linguistic expressions\nwithout also threatening the existence of facts about mental content,\nand vice versa. And we can add Boghossian\u2019s further\nobservation:\n\n\nIf [the sceptical arguments are] effective at all, they should be as\neffective against linguistic content as they are against mental\ncontent. This is evident from the fact that the arguments construct\ntheir skeptical case by exploiting features of content properties, but\nwithout exploiting any facts about the putative bearers of\nthose properties. Thus, they would apply to anything said to possess\ncontent, whether it was mental or not. (1990 [2008: 62])\n\n\nIn what follows, then, we\u2019ll move freely between considering\narguments about rule-following, linguistic meaning, and mental\n content.[2]\n",
