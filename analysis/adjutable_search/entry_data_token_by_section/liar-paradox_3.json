    "main_text": "The Paradox and the Broader Phenomenon || Boolean compounds\n1.4 Boolean compounds\n\nBoolean compounds can enter into Liar sentences in many ways. One\nrelatively simple one is as follows. Consider the following sentence\nnamed \u2018DLiar\u2019 (for \u2018Disjunctive\u2019).\n\nDLiar: Either\nDLiar is not true or \\(1 = 0\\).\n\n\nFirst, observe that if DLiar is not true, then it must be true. If\nDLiar is not true, then by similar reasoning to what we saw above, we\nhave that the left disjunct of DLiar is true. But a disjunction is\ntrue if one of its disjuncts is, so DLiar is true. Thus, if DLiar is\nnot true, it is true and not true, and we have a contradiction. By\nreductio, then, it must be true; so one of its disjuncts must be true.\nIf it\u2019s the first one, we have a contradiction, so it must be\nthe second one; we can conclude that \\(1 = 0\\). We have thus proved\nthat \\(1 = 0\\). Moreover, the sentence \u2018\\(1 = 0\\)\u2019 played\nno real role in the above reasoning. We could replace it with any\nother sentence to get a proof of that sentence. \n\nWe pause to mention DLiar as it is connected with another important\nparadox: Curry\u2019s paradox, which involves conditionals that say\nof themselves only that if they (the conditional itself) are true, so\ntoo is some absurdity (e.g., \u2018if this sentence is true, then \\(1\n= 0\\)\u2019 or \u2018if this sentence is true, everything is\ntrue\u2019 or so on). At least in languages where the conditional is\nthe material conditional, and so \\(A \\supset B\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\neg A \\vee B\\), DLiar is equivalent to the Curry sentence\n\u2018DLiar is true \\(\\supset 1 = 0\\)\u2019. Though this may set up\nsome relations between the Liar and Curry\u2019s paradox, we pause to\nnote an important difference. For the Curry paradox is most important\nwhere the conditional is more than the material conditional (or some\nmodalized variant of it). In such settings, the Curry paradox does not\nwear negation on its sleeve, as DLiar does. For more information,\nconsult the entry on\n Curry\u2019s paradox.\n",
