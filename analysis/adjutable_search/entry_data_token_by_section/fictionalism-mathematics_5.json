Objections to Fictionalism and Responses\n\nGiven that there are no compelling arguments against platonism, the\nnext question one might naturally ask is whether there are any good\narguments against fictionalism (and hence, if platonism is really the\nonly plausible alternative to fictionalism, in favor of platonism).\nThe present section considers several such arguments. In going through\nthe fictionalist responses to these arguments, we will also see how\ndifferent philosophers have developed different versions of\nfictionalism.\n",
