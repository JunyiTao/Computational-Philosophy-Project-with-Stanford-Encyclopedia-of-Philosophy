    "main_text": "International Rule of Law || The Rule of Law\u2014Thick and Thin\n5.1 The Rule of Law\u2014Thick and Thin\n\nOne of the key determinants of the legitimacy of a legal order is the\nextent of its compliance with the widely acclaimed, but deeply\ncontested, value commonly designated as \u201cthe rule of law\u201d.\nAn initial problem is that the phrase \u201cthe rule of law\u201d is\nused to mean many different things. It is important to avoid confusing\nthe rule of law with the idea of rule by law. The\nlatter refers to the idea of governance through the means, and under\nthe constraint of, positive law. But the fact that a mode of\ngovernance assumes a recognizably legal form does not necessarily\nreveal anything about its value. When the expression \u201crule of\nlaw\u201d is used to mean rule by law, there is no meaningful\ndifference between, for example, a call to respect the rule of law in\ninternational relations and a simple call to respect international\nlaw.\n\nIf, however, we think of the rule of law as an evaluative\nnotion, different and important issues arise. One of them is whether\nthe rule of law properly extends to the evaluation of international\nlaw and, if so, under which interpretation and with what concrete\nimplications. This debate partly reflects background disagreements\nabout the rule of law more generally. Another downstream question is\nto what extent, and in what form, the ethical-political ideal of the\nrule of law, has been, or should be, specified as a set of legal\nrequirements within international law itself, analogously to the\nmanner in which international human rights law crystallizes a\nbackground morality of human rights (Arajavi 2021). In this section,\nthe focus will be on the prior, more foundational issue.\n\nLegal philosophers disagree about the proper characterization of the\nrule of law, their differing views occupying varying points along a\nspectrum from \u201cthin\u201d, or formal-procedural, to\nincreasingly \u201cthick\u201d, or substantive, accounts (Waldron\n2016; Tasioulas 2020a). \u201cThick\u201d accounts of the rule of\nlaw identify it with something approaching all the requirements,\nformal-procedural and substantive, good law should satisfy; or all the\nrequirements that make for legitimate law (Beyleveld & Brownsword\n2007); or all the demands of political justice (rights) that bear on\nlaw (Dworkin 2011); or else some favoured comprehensive catalogue of\nlegally-relevant desiderata, such as compliance with democracy and\nhuman rights (Bingham 2010; Annan 2004). The thicker one\u2019s\nfavoured account of the rule of law, the more demanding a standard it\nsets for the international legal order. This has led some advocates of\nthick accounts to conclude that the rule of law does not apply to\ninternational law, since it imposes demands that cannot feasibly be\nmade of international, rather than domestic, law.\n\nOne such advocate of a thick account is James Crawford, a former Judge\non the International Court of Justice. Crawford identifies five\nrequirements imposed by the rule of law:\n\n\nfirst, that no one is outside the law, still less above it; second,\nthat it is by some means or in some sense democratic, at least in the\nsense of being accountable to others; third, that its instituted\nauthorities\u2014notably the Security Council\u2014are in principle\nsubject to legal constraint; fourth, that there is something like a\nconstitution of international society; and fifth, that society is not\nirremediably unjust. (Crawford 2014: 343)\n\n\nAs Crawford shows, existing international law in general struggles to\nmeet each of these desiderata; at best, perhaps only certain\n\u201cenclaves\u201d of international law do so (Crawford 2014:\n367).\n\nOne might conclude from his analysis that full compliance with the\nrule of law is an unrealistic demand to place on the international\nlegal order, ignoring, as it does, salient disanalogies between the\ndomestic and international spheres, such as the absence of a\ncentralized legislative authority, courts with compulsory\njurisdiction, and effective enforcement mechanisms, as well as forms\nof international solidarity needed to make democratic governance\nfeasible. Crawford himself draws the conclusion that there can only be\na rule of law in international law in the thin, formal, sense\n(Crawford 2014: 375), not the full, substantive, sense incorporating\nall five of his requirements. (For more optimistic proponents of\n\u201cthick\u201d conceptions of the international rule of law, one\nthat incorporates respect for human rights, see McCorquodale 2016 and\nPavel 2021).\n\nOthers, who are proponents of the thin view of the rule of law, will\nrespond to Crawford\u2019s conclusion by saying that the\n\u201cthin\u201d view of the rule of law is the correct one in\ngeneral. For these philosophers, \u201cthick\u201d accounts of the\nrule of law err in lumping together a series of requirements on law\nthat either have no underlying coherence or which simply replicate\nother standards for its evaluation, thereby obscuring the distinctive\nform of assessment imported by a thinner account of the rule of law as\none moral-political demand upon law among others (Tasioulas\n2020a).\n",
