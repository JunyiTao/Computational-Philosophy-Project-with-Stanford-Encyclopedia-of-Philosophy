    "main_text": "Realism vs antirealism about metaphysical explanation\n5. Realism vs antirealism about metaphysical explanation\n\nIn\n \u00a73,\n we raised a surprising tension in theorizing about metaphysical\nexplanation: at least initially, it appears at once to be about\nthe world (qua metaphysical) and about how we think and\ncommunicate about the world (qua explanation). Realists\nand antirealists about metaphysical explanation disagree\nabout how to resolve this tension. For realists, metaphysical\nexplanation is primarily (or even entirely) objective and\nmind-independent. That is, there is some mind-independent fact of the\nmatter about what metaphysically explains what; what metaphysically\nexplains what depends on what the world is like, and not (or at least\nnot primarily) on how we think or talk about it. Those who deny this,\nand think of metaphysical explanation as inescapably linked to how we\nthink and communicate, are antirealists.\n\nOne can be realists about metaphysical explanation to varying degrees.\nAn extreme realist view conjoins a realism about metaphysical\ndependence relations (they are themselves completely objective and\nmind-independent) with the view that metaphysical explanations\njust are the relevant kinds of dependence relations. Most\nphilosophers do not think metaphysical explanation is quite like this.\nAn attractive, widely held view is that metaphysical explanations have\nboth a representational component and a worldly component, as is\ncommonly the case when people adopt a version of the separatist view\ndiscussed above\n (\u00a73).\n So long as the worldly component of metaphysical explanation\n(generally taken to be a non-causal dependence relation of some sort)\nis itself objective and mind-independent, the relevant account of\nmetaphysical explanation is generally considered realist.\n\nHowever, there is room to adopt a view of metaphysical explanation\naccording to which constraints on how this worldly dependence relation\nand the relata it holds between are represented factor into whether or\nnot something counts as an explanation. For example, one might think\nthat an extremely complicated description of the relation between\nparticles could fail as a metaphysical explanation of the existence of\na table, because when related to subjects with our level of cognitive\nsophistication, it is impossible for us to understand or to expect the\nexistence of the table on the basis of the relevant description. This\nwould seem a less than fully realist account of metaphysical\nexplanation, because whilst the explanation includes a worldly\ncomponent, its counting as a metaphysical explanation or otherwise\ndepends on psychological factors such as the cognitive sophistication\nof its likely recipients.\n\nThere are various ways to resist the above account without giving up\non the idea that acts of metaphysical explanation might sometimes fail\non the basis of psychological factors. One might insist that a\nmetaphysical explanation is to be distinguished from an act\nof metaphysical explanation, and that all that is required for the\nlatter is a true representation of worldly non-causal dependence.\nMetaphysical explanations abound to various degrees of complexity\n(etc.) and their existing and counting as metaphysical explanations is\nnot something constrained by pragmatic, epistemic, or psychological\nfactors. How well they fare in acts of explaining is another matter,\none that falls under the question of whether or not they are\nsuccessful explanations. A different way to resist is to\ninsist that all that is required for realism is that one component of\nthe explanation be objective and mind-independent, because whilst the\nterm \u201cmetaphysical explanation\u201d refers to a representation\nof a worldly relation, whether something counts as a metaphysical\nexplanation or not fully depends on the worldly component. (One might\nmotivate this sort of view by claiming that, e.g., grounding is the\nessential component of any metaphysical explanation, but explanations\nare representational entities and so strictly speaking it is a mistake\nto describe the relation as an explanation, even though it alone does\nall the explanatory work, so to speak.)\n\nIn contrast, antirealists about metaphysical explanation at the most\nextreme end of the spectrum do not see any role for worldly dependence\nrelations (see, e.g., Dasgupta 2017 and Taylor forthcoming for\ndiscussion). They might adopt the two-component view discussed above\nand maintain that both the relation involved in metaphysical\nexplanation and how it is represented are conceptual matters (e.g.,\nbecause they are antirealists about the relevant non-casual dependence\nrelations), or they might think that metaphysical explanation has only\none component. That component might be a conceptual relation or a\nnon-causal dependence relation understood in an antirealist way, or it\nmight be something more representational. For example, one might\nfollow Shaheen (2017) in taking the use of causal metaphors to be a\ncomponent of our talk about metaphysical explanation, while going\nfurther than he does by denying that the metaphorical cause-like sense\nof \u201cbecause\u201d used in metaphysics has objective,\nmind-independent truth conditions. Or one might follow Thompson\n(2019), who thinks of metaphysical explanations as answers to certain\nkinds of questions. Both views are consistent with thinking that\nnon-causal dependence relations play a role in metaphysical\nexplanation (by being what certain kinds of because-claims are about,\nor helping to make it the case that a particular answer to a question\nis correct) but the relations are not themselves a component of the\nexplanation.\n\nNorton and Miller (2019) present what they describe as a\npsychologistic theory of metaphysical explanation; metaphysical\nexplanations have truth conditions that appeal to the dispositions of\nagents evaluating the explanation, as well as necessitation relations\nbetween the explanans and explanandum. Since these necessitation\nrelations are objective this is not an entirely antirealist account of\nmetaphysical explanation, but from the way in which mental states vary\nbetween individuals it follows that metaphysical explanations are only\ntrue or false relative to a particular context of assessment. It is\nthus to be considered a broadly antirealist account.\n",
