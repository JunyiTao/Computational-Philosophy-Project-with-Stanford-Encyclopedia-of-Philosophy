    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories do not Work for Certain Reflexive Thoughts\n4.4 Causal Theories do not Work for Certain Reflexive Thoughts\n\nBuras (2009) presents another argument that is perhaps best thought of\nas providing a novel reason to think that causal theories of mental\nrepresentation only offer sufficiency conditions on meaning. This\nargument begins with the premise that some mental states are about\nthemselves. To motivate this claim, Buras notes that some sentences\nare about themselves. So, by analogy with, \u201cThis sentence is\nfalse,\u201d which is about itself, one might think that there is a\nthought, \u201cThis thought is false,\u201d that is also about\nitself. Or, how about \u201cThis thought is realized in brain\ntissue\u201d or \u201cThis thought was caused by LSD\u201d? These\nappear to be about themselves. Buras\u2019 second premise is that\nnothing is a cause of itself. So, \u201cThis thought is false\u201d\nis about itself, but could not be caused by itself. So, the sentence\n\u201cThis thought is false\u201d could not mean that it itself is\nfalse in virtue of the fact that \u201cThis thought is false\u201d\nwas caused by its being false. So, \u201cThis thought is false\u201d\nmust get its meaning in some other way. It must get its meaning in\nvirtue of some other conditions of meaning acquisition.\n\nThis is not, however, exactly the way Buras develops his argument. In\nthe first place, he treats causal theories of mental content as\nmaintaining that, if \u201cX\u201d means X, then X causes\n\u201cX\u201d. (Cf. Buras, 2009, p. 118). He cites Stampe (1977),\nDretske (1988), and Fodor (1987) as maintaining this. Yet, Stampe,\nDretske, and Fodor explicitly formulate their theories in terms of\nsufficiency conditions, so that (roughly) \u201cX\u201d means X, if\nXs causes \u201cX\u201ds, etc. (See, for example, Stampe (1977), pp.\n82\u20133, Dretske (1988), p. 52, and Fodor (187), p. 100). In the\nsecond place, Buras seems to draw a conclusion that is orthogonal to\nthe truth or falsity of causal theories of mental content. He begins\nhis paper with an impressively succinct statement of his argument.\n\nSome mental states are about themselves. Nothing is a cause of itself.\nSo some mental states are not about their causes; they are about\nthings distinct from their causes (Buras, 2009, p. 117).\n\nThe causal theorist can admit that some mental states are not about\ntheir causes, since some states are thoughts and thoughts mean what\nthey do in virtue of, say, the meanings of mental sentences. These\nmental sentences might mean what they do in virtue of the meanings of\nprimitive mental representations (which may or may not mean what they\ndo in virtue of a causal theory of meaning) and the way in which those\nprimitive mental representations are put together. As was mentioned in\nsection 2, such a syntactically and semantically combinatorial\nlanguage of thought is a familiar background assumption for causal\ntheories. The conclusion that Buras may want, instead, is that there\nare some thoughts that do not mean what they do in virtue of what\ncauses them. So, through some slight amendments, one can understand\nBuras to be presenting a clarification of the scope of causal theories\nof mental content or as a challenge to a particularly strong version\nof causal theories, a version that takes them as offering a necessary\ncondition on meaning.\n4.5 Causal Theories do Not Work for Reliable Misrepresentations\n\nAs noted above, one of the central challenges for causal theories of\nmental content has been to discriminate between a \u201ccore\u201d\ncontent-determining causal connection, as between cows and\n\u201ccow\u201ds, and \u201cperipheral\u201d\nnon-content-determining causal connections, as between horses and\n\u201ccow\u201ds. Cases of reliable misrepresentations are\nrepresentations which always misrepresent in the same way. In such\ncases, there is supposed to be no \u201ccore\u201d\ncontent-determining causal connection; there are no X\u2019s to which\n\u201cX\u201ds are causally connected. Instead, there are only\n\u201cperipheral\u201d causal connections. Mendelovici, (2013),\nfollowing a discussion by Hohman, (2002), suggests that color\nrepresentations may be like\n this.[11]\n Color anti-realism, according to which there are no colors in the\nworld, seems to be committed to the view that color representations\nare not caused by colors in the world. Color representations may be\nreliably tokened by something in the world, but not by colors that are\nin the world.\n\nIn some instances, reliable misrepresentations provide another take on\nsome of the familiar content-determination problems. So, take attempts\nto use normal conditions to distinguish between content-determining\ncauses and non-content-determining causes. Even in normal conditions,\ncolor representations are not caused by colors, but by, say, surface\nreflectances under certain conditions of illumination, just in the way\nthat, even in normal conditions cow representations are sometimes not\ncaused by cows, but by, say, a question such as, \u201cWhat kind of\nanimal is sometimes named \u2018Bessie\u2019?\u201d Take a version\nof the asymmetric dependency theory. On this theory applied to color\nterms, it might seem that there is no red-to-\u201cred\u201d law on\nwhich all the other laws depends in much the same way that it might\nseem there is no unicorn-to-\u201cunicorn\u201d law on which all\nother laws depends. (Cf. Fodor (1987, pp. 163\u20134) and (1990, pp.\n100\u20131)).\n\nUnlike the more familiar cases, Mendelovici, (2013), does not argue\nthat there actually are such problematic cases. The argument is not\nthat there are actual cases of reliable misrepresentations, but merely\nthat reliable misrepresentations are possible and that this is enough\nto create trouble for causal theories of mental representation. One\nsort of trouble stems from the need for a pattern of psychological\nexplanation. Let a mental representation \u201cX\u201d mean\nintrinsically-heavy. Such a representation is a misrepresentation,\nsince there is no such property of being intrinsically heavy. Such a\nmisrepresentation is, nonetheless, reliable (i.e. consistent), since\nit is consistently tokened by all the same sort of things on earth.\nBut, one can see how an agent using \u201cX\u201d could make a\nreasonable, yet mistaken, inference to the conclusion that an object\nthat causes a tokening of \u201cX\u201d on earth would be hard to\nlift on the moon. To allow such a pattern of explanation, Mendelovici\nargues, a causal theorist must allow for reliable misrepresentation. A\ntheory of what mental representations are should not preclude such\npatterns of explanation. Another sort of trouble stems from the idea\nthat if a theory of meaning does not allow for reliable\nmisrepresentation, but requires that there be a connection between\n\u201cX\u201ds and Xs, then this would be constitute a commitment to\na realist metaphysics for Xs. While there can be good reasons for\nrealism, the needs of a theory of content would not seem to be a\nproper source for them.\n\nArtiga, 2013, provides a defense of teleosemantic theories in the face\nof Mendelovici\u2019s examples of reliable misrepresentation. Some of\nArtiga\u2019s arguments might also be used by advocates of causal\ntheories of mental content. Mendelovici, (2016), replies to Artiga,\n2013, by providing refinements and a further defense of the view that\nreliable misrepresentations are a problem for causal theories of\nmental content.\n4.6 Causal Theories Conflict with the Theory Mediation of Perception\n\nCummins (1997) argues that causal theories of mental content are\nincompatible with the fact that one\u2019s perception of objects in\nthe physical environment is typically mediated by a theory. His\nargument proceeds in two stages. In one stage, he argues that, on a\ncausal theory, for each primitive \u201cX\u201d there must be some\nbit of machinery or mechanism that is responsible for detecting Xs.\nBut, since a finite device, such as the human brain, contains only a\nfinite amount of material, it can only generate a finite number of\nprimitive representations. Next, he observes that thought is\nproductive\u2014that it can, in principle, generate an unbounded\nnumber of semantically distinct representations. This means that to\ngenerate the stock of mental representations corresponding to each of\nthese distinct thoughts, one must have a syntactically and\nsemantically combinatorial system of mental representation of the sort\nfound in a language of thought (LOT). More explicitly, this scheme of\nmental representation must have the following properties:\n\nIt has a finite number of semantically primitive expressions.\nEvery expression is a concatenation of one or more primitive\nexpressions.\nThe content of any complex expression is a function of the\ncontents of the primitives and the way those primitives are\nconcatenated into the whole expression.\n\n\nThe conclusion of this first stage is, therefore, that a causal theory\nof mental representation requires a LOT. In the other stage of his\nargument, Cummins observes that, for a wide range of objects, their\nperception is mediated by a body of theory. Thus, to perceive\ndogs\u2014for dogs to cause \u201cdogs\u201d\u2014one has to know\nthings such as that dogs have tails, dogs have fur, and dogs four\nlegs. But, to know that dogs have tails, fur, and four legs, one needs\na set of mental representations, such as \u201ctail\u201d,\n\u201cfur\u201d, \u201cfour\u201d, and \u201clegs\u201d. Now the\nproblem fully emerges. According to causal theories, having an\n\u201cX\u201d representation requires the ability to detect dogs.\nBut, the ability to detect dogs requires a theory of dogs. But, having\na theory of dogs requires already having a LOT\u2014a system of\nmental representation. One cannot generate mental representations\nwithout already having\n them.[12]\n4.7 Causal Theories Conflict with the Implementation of Psychological Laws\n\nJason Bridges (2006) argues that the core hypothesis of informational\nsemantics conflicts with the idea that psychological laws are\nnon-basic. As we have just observed, causal theories are often taken\nto offer mere sufficiency conditions for meaning. Suppose, therefore,\nthat we suitably restrict the scope of a causal theory and understand\nits core hypothesis as asserting that all \u201cX\u201ds with the\ncontent X are reliably caused by X. (Nothing in the logic of\nBridges\u2019 argument depends on any additional conditions on a\nputative causal theory of mental content, so for simplicity we can\nfollow Bridges in restricting attention to this simple version.)\nBridges proposes that this core claim of a causal theory of mental\ncontent is a constitution thesis. It specifies what constitutes the\nmeaning relation (at least in some restricted domain). Thus, if one\nwere to ask, \u201cWhy is it that all \u2018X\u2019s with content X\nare reliably caused by Xs?,\u201d the answer is roughly,\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what it is for \u2018X\u2019 to have the\ncontent X\u201d. Being caused in that way is what constitutes having\nthat meaning. So, when a theory invokes this kind of constitutive\nrelation, there is this kind of constitutive explanation. So, the\nfirst premise of Bridges\u2019 argument is that causal theories\nspecify a constitutive relation between meaning and reliable causal\nconnection.\n\nBridges next observes that causal theorists typically maintain that\nthe putative fact that all \u201cX\u201ds are reliably caused by Xs\nis mediated by underlying mechanisms of one sort or another. So,\n\u201cX\u201ds might be reliably caused by dogs in part through the\nmediation of a person\u2019s visual system or auditory system.\nOne\u2019s visual apparatus might causally connect particular\npatterns of color and luminance produced by dogs to \u201cX\u201ds.\nOne might put the point somewhat differently by saying that a causal\ntheorist\u2019s hypothetical \u201cXs causes \u2018X\u2019s\u201d\nlaw is not a basic or fundamental law of nature, but an implemented\nlaw.\n\nBridges\u2019 third premise is a principle that he takes to be nearly\nself-evident, once understood. We can develop a better first-pass\nunderstanding of Bridges\u2019 argument if, at the risk of distorting\nthe argument, we consider a slightly simplified version of this\nprinciple:\n\n(S) If it is a true constitutive claim that all fs are\ngs, then it\u2019s not an implemented law that all\nfs are gs.\n\n\nTo illustrate the principle, suppose we say that gold is identical to\nthe element with atomic number 79, that all gold has atomic number 79.\nThen suppose one were to ask, \u201cWhy is it that all gold has the\natomic number 79?\u201d The answer would be, \u201cGold just\nis the element with atomic number 79.\u201d This would be a\nconstitutive explanation. According to (S), however, this constitutive\nexplanation precludes giving a further mechanistic explanation of why\ngold has atomic number 79. There is no mechanism by which gold gets\natomic number 79. Having atomic number 79 just is what makes gold\ngold.\n\nSo, here is the argument\n\nP1. It is a true constitutive claim that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\nP2. If it is a true constitutive claim that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs, then it is not an implemented law\nthat all \u201cX\u201ds with content X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens on P1 and P2,\n\nC1. It is not an implemented law that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\n\nBut, C1 contradicts the common assumption\n\nP3. It is an implemented law that all \u201cX\u201ds with content X\nare reliably caused by\n Xs.[13]\n\n\nRupert (2008) challenges the first premise of Bridges\u2019 argument\non two scores. First, he notes that claims about constitutive natures\nhave modal implications which at least some naturalistic philosophers\nhave found objectionable. Second, he claims that natural scientists do\nnot appeal to constitutive natures, so that one need not develop a\ntheory of mental content that invokes them.\n4.8 Causal Theories do not Provide a Metasemantic Theory\n\nIn discussing informational variants of causal theories, Artiga &\nSebasti\u00e1n, 2020, have proposed a new \u201cmetasemantic\u201d\nproblem. They correctly note that there is a difference between\nexplaining why \u201cX\u201d means X, rather than Y, and explaining\nwhy \u201cX\u201d has a meaning at all. Moreover, they correctly\nnote that having an answer to this first question does not necessarily\nanswer the second question. But, it is unclear that the metasemantic\nproblem is serious. If one\u2019s theory is that \u201cX\u201d\nmeans X if A, B, and C, then that would seem to provide an answer to\nthe metasemantic question. Why does \u201cX\u201d mean anything at\nall? Because \u201cX\u201d meets sufficiency conditions A, B, and C.\nIn other words, insofar as there is a question to be answered, it\nappears that all theories provide one.\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nAlthough philosophers and cognitive scientists frequently propose to\ndispense with (one or another sort of) mental representation (cf.,\ne.g., Stich, 1983, Brooks, 1991, van Gelder, 1995, Haugeland, 1999,\nJohnson, 2007, Chemero, 2009), this is universally accepted to be a\nrevolutionary shift in thinking about minds. Short of taking on board\nsuch radical views, one will naturally want some explanation of how\nmental representations arise. In attempting such explanations, causal\ntheories have been widely perceived to have numerous attractive\nfeatures. If, for example, one use for mental representations is to\nhelp one keep track of events in the world, then some causal\nconnection between mind and world makes sense. This attractiveness has\nbeen enough to motivate new causal theories (e.g. Rupert, 1999, Usher,\n2001, and Ryder, 2004), despite the widespread recognition of serious\nchallenges to an earlier generation of theories developed by Stampe,\nDretske, Fodor, and others.",
