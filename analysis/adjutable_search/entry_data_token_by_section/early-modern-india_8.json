The Manual\u2019s\naccount substantially agrees with that already found in\nPra\u015bastap\u0101da, which is partially traceable to the\nVaise\u1e63ika-s\u016btra itself. The content of the\nrelevant stanzas can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nMotion is the non-inherent cause of conjunction and disjunction. It is\nof five types, four volitional (throwing upwards, throwing downwards,\ncontraction, expansion) and the fifth comprising all non-volitional\nmotion (including falling, rotating, flowing, etc.) (TS 5, 81).\n\nWeight (gurutva) is the non-inherent cause of the initial\nfalling motion of a body (TS 30).\n\nFluidity (dravatya) is the non-inherent cause of (initial?)\nflowing (TS 31).\n\n\n\u2018Impetus\u2019 (vega) is a dispositional property\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), as is \u2018elasticity\u2019\n(sthitisth\u0101paka) (TS 80). \u2018Impetus\u2019 is the\nnon-inherent cause of the second and subsequent falling motions of a\nbody (TS 30). Elasticity is that which restores something to its\noriginal state after it has been distorted.\n\nHere is a brief summary of the theory. A moving body possesses, at\neach moment in time, a particular \u2018motion\u2019, which is to be\nthought of as a momentary, quality-like property of the body. Motions\nare defined to be the cause of conjunctions or disjunctions. A\nconjunction with a (stationary) body is brought about by displacement\nin space. We are thus to think of the motion of a body as being either\nidentical with, or else the cause of, its displacement in space\nbetween two moments in time. A motion cannot be caused by another\nmotion (as that would lead to perpetual motion). A body is set in\nmotion by its possession of a quality like \u2018weight\u2019 or\n\u2018fluidity\u2019. It persists in motion by having a\ndispositional property, \u2018impetus\u2019 or\n\u2018elasticity\u2019, which is the continuous cause of subsequent\nmotions. It is brought to rest by coming into contact with other\nobjects.\n\nThe role of \u2018impetus\u2019 in this account is particularly\ninteresting. It is illustrated with reference to two examples: (i) a\nfruit falling from a tree; (ii) a javelin thrown obliquely\nupwards.\n\nAt time t0 the fruit is stationary at place\ns0. Its weight is counterbalanced by its contact\nwith its stalk. At t1, its stalk breaks and its\nweight causes it to move to point s1. At this time\ntoo there is produced in the fruit a dispositional\n\u2018impetus\u2019. At t2, the impetus in the\nfruit causes a second motion, from s1 to\ns2, and so on for all subsequent times. Note that\nthe \u2018weight\u2019 of the fruit is the cause of its initial\nmotion, but then ceases to be operative. The cause of all subsequent\nmotion is the \u2018impetus\u2019 impressed into the fruit by the\ninitial motion. It is this idea, that the subsequent motion of the\nfruit is the result, not of an external force, but of the internally\nimpressed vega, which licenses us to describe the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika account as an impetus theory.\nWhen the javelin is thrown, the initial volitional push imparts\ninto the javelin an initial motion and an impetus. The upwards impetus\ncounteracts the javelin\u2019s weight and causes its upwards motion.\nWhen this impetus is exhausted by contact with the air, the\njavelin\u2019s weight imparts a downwards impetus and the javelin\nfalls. The horizontal motion of the javelin is caused by its having a\nhorizontal impetus which again decreases as a result of contact with\nthe air. The amount of impetus initially acquired by the javelin is\nproportional to the applied volitional push. Once again, its is the\njavelin\u2019s having impetus, rather than the action of some\nexternal force, which accounts for its continued motion through the\nair.\n\n\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas extend this model to explain certain other\nkinds of motion. (1) The initial cause of the flowing of water is\nalleged to result from a force called \u2018fluidity\u2019 (rather\nthan the weight of the water). The subsequent flowing is the result of\nthe water\u2019s acquired impetus. (2) Interestingly, the impetus of\na body moving in a straight line was thought to be ontologically of\nthe same type as the elasticity of a bent stick\u2014a fact which\nreveals that impetus was thought of as a kind of internal force, not\nas inertia. (3) The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas mention various other kinds\nof motion: the movement of an iron needle towards a magnet, the upward\nmotion of flames, the movement of air, and the initial motion of the\natoms at the beginning of creation. Given the above model, there must\nbe some \u2018force\u2019 which initially gives rise to each of\nthese motions, yet none of the \u2018forces\u2019 so far isolated\n(weight/gravity, fluidity, elasticity) will do. The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas therefore speak of a new force,\n\u2018ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u2019 (the\n\u2018unseen\u2019 force), alleged to account for such motions.\n",
