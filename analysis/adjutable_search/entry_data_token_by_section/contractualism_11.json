The contractualist account of substantive responsibility\n\nQuestions of substantive responsibility arise when we must decide who\nwill bear what burdens. \u201cTo hold a person who has ended up\nburdened to be substantively responsible for that burden is to hold it\nto be hers to bear, ceteris paribus. No one owes it to her to share or\nalleviate it.\u201d (Kumar 2015, p. 252) Kumar explains the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility as follows.\n\u201cA person who ends up burdened is substantively responsible for\nit if no one owed it to her to do more to enable her to avert it. To\nhold her not to be wronged in ending up burdened just is to hold her\nto be substantively responsible for it. The reasons that are relevant\nto the justification of why she is not wronged are those that\nestablish that she has good reason to want what happens to her in that\ntype of situation to depend on how she responds to alternatives, and\nthat enough was done to secure that dependence.\u201d (Kumar 2015, p.\n253)\n\nContractualism claims to offer an intuitive account of when agents can\nreasonably be expected to bear burdens. Critics argue that this\npromise is illusory and that contractualism fails to respect our\nintuitive judgements of substantive responsibility. (Williams 2006,\nVoorhoeve 2008.)\n\nDiscussion often focuses on the following example:\n\nHazardous Waste: A city\u2019s officials need to remove and\ndispose of hazardous waste found near a residential area. This removal\nwill release some hazardous chemicals, but it is much less dangerous\nthan leaving the waste where it is. Even if the officials take all\nreasonable precautions, some hazardous material will be released\n\u2013 enough to cause lung damage to anyone directly exposed but not\nenough to pose a serious threat to anyone who stays indoors and away\nfrom the excavation site. (Scanlon 1998, p. 257; Kumar 2015, p.\n264)\n\nIntuitively, so long as they warn people to stay indoors while the\nwaste is being removed, the city officials can legitimately remove the\nhazardous waste. This does expose some people to a risk of serious\nharm. But all available alternatives are worse: the waste cannot be\nleft where it is, and evacuating the city is not feasible. A principle\npermitting officials to expose some people to a risk of harm in order\nto protect public health is one that no one can reasonably reject.\n\nSuppose the officials have done enough to reduce the risk. Leaflets\nhave been delivered to all households, announcements made on radio,\ntelevision, and social media, advertisements placed in newspapers,\nbarriers erected around the excavation site, warnings posted at all\nentrances, and so on. But now consider one citizen of the city (call\nher Curious), who is counter-suggestible. Warnings and barriers merely\nserve to pique her curiosity. Curious had no prior interest in\nhazardous waste. But she now develops a desire to see what all the\nfuss is about. Ignoring the warnings, Curious climbs over the barriers\nand exposes herself to a dangerous dose of hazardous chemicals.\n\nCurious\u2019s burden results, in a fairly predictable way, from her\nown reckless choice. Intuitively, this renders her substantively\nresponsible for that burden. Curious cannot hold others responsible\nfor her burden. For instance, she cannot sue the city (or its\nofficials) to cover her medical costs. One natural explanation for\nthis intuition is the Forfeiture View: by disregarding\nwarnings, Curious has forfeited her right to expect others either to\navoid exposing her to harm or to alleviate her burden if she is\nharmed.\n\nScanlon rejects the Forfeiture View in favour of a Value of\nChoice account, which emphasises: \u201cthe reasons that\nindividuals have to want what happens to them, and their obligations\nto others and others\u2019 obligations to them, to depend on how they\nrespond.\u201d (Scanlon 2015, p. 106) On this view, it is the\navailability of choice that matters, not whether the agent\nhas made any actual choice. If I am told that I must collect\nmy theatre tickets by a certain time and I then absentmindedly fail to\ncollect them in time, then I am responsible for the fact that I miss\nthe performance. What matters is that I had the opportunity to avoid\nthis situation, even though I made no conscious decision. (Scanlon\n2015, p. 108)\n\nContractualist principles must be justified to each person. This\njustification must cite some reason why a given principle makes sense\nto that person. In the Hazardous Waste case, contractualists argue\nthat each person has reason to value living in a society where her\nfate depends (in part) on her own choices, even if the result is that\nshe sometimes finds herself responsible for burdens that she could\nhave avoided and has not conscious chosen.\n\nCritics argue that contractualists who cite the Value of Choice cannot\njustify intuitive principles in the Hazardous Waste case. The\nopportunity to choose is not valuable for Curious. On the\ncontrary, that opportunity clearly makes her worse-off! Consider the\nfollowing variant of the original case.\n\nCautionary vs Covert: Officials have two options for dealing\nwith hazardous waste. Under a Cautionary Policy, officials\nissue public warnings, erect barriers, and so on. Under a Covert\nPolicy, officials remove the waste in secret, depriving the\npublic of any knowledge of the risk. Suppose officials know that,\nwhile the Cautionary Policy will result in a larger number of lung\ndamage cases, every afflicted person will be someone who heard the\nwarnings and failed to heed them. By contrast, while the Covert Policy\nwill result in a smaller number of lung damage cases, none of\nthose people will have had any opportunity to avoid harm.\nWhich policy should the officials choose? (Williams 2006, p. 253;\nKumar 2015, p. 269)\n\nIntuitively, the officials should choose the Cautionary Policy instead\nof the Covert one, even though more people will suffer harm. Critics\nobject that contractualists using the Value of Choice cannot capture\nthis result. (Williams 2006). Consider Curious. The Covert Policy\noffers her greater protection from harm than the Cautionary Policy,\nbecause her chance of suffering harm is higher under the latter than\nunder the former. And because she is impetuously curious, warnings and\nother information have negative value for Curious. The opportunity to\nchoose only makes her worse-off. Therefore, Curious can reasonably\nreject the Cautionary Policy.\n\nContractualists agree that the Cautionary Policy is \u201cthe only\nmorally defensible choice\u201d (Kumar 2015, p. 269). However, they\nargue that contractualism can deliver this result, for two reasons.\nFirst, even if the covert policy is instrumentally superior,\nall moral agents have strong symbolic reasons for \u201cnot\nwanting it to be permissible for public officials to hide important\ninformation because they decide that members of the public are not\ncompetent to assess it and respond appropriately\u201d (Kumar 2015,\np. 270). Covert paternalism clearly fails to treat people as\nresponsible adults, and therefore everyone has reason to reject it.\nSecond, Contractualists will appeal to the need to evaluate principles\nagainst generic standpoints, rather than against the eccentric\npreferences of particular individuals.\u201cOur assessment cannot be\nbased on the particular aims, preferences, and other characteristics\nof specific individuals. We must rely instead on commonly available\ninformation about what people have reason to want \u2026 about\ngeneric reasons.\u201d (Scanlon 1998, p. 203) What matters is not\nwhat Curious wants, but what a representative person\nin her situation would have reason to want. And people in general have\nreason to want control over their exposure to risk. Generic reasons\nalso play a key role in contractualist accounts of risk (section 11)\nand our obligations to future people (section 13).\n",
