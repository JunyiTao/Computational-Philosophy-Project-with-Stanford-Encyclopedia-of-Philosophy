(In fact we use the word \u201cconnective\u201d more\ngenerously, so that there don\u2019t have to be two or more sentences\nlinked, allowing us to consider the analogues of words like\n\u201cnot\u201d and \u201cnecessarily\u201d as connectives too.)\nAmong the questions this enterprise has raised are the following.\n(1) Which such naturally occurring sentence connectives call for a\ntreatment of this kind? (Which of them should be counted as\n\u2018logical constants\u2019?) (2) Do the aspects of their use\nwhich are simulated in that process exhaust what we might think of as\ntheir meanings, or is there typically some mismatch here? Of\ncourse this second question depends on the particular formal treatment\ngiven, since different logics may disagree on the formal principles\naccorded to their representatives\u2014for example in the case of\n\u201cif\u201d, but according to one famous line of thought\n(developed by H. P. Grice) when we focus specifically on their\ntreatment in classical propositional logic, any such apparent\ndiscrepancies can be explained away by appeal to pragmatic principles\nregulating ordinary cooperative conversation, and do not reflect\ndifferences of meaning (semantic differences).\n\nNeither question (1) nor question (2) will be addressed here. Instead,\nthis entry focusses on the properties of\u2014and relations\nbetween\u2014the formal representatives of these connectives.\nExamples of such properties include truth-functionality and a\nreplacement property called congruentiality, and of such relations\nwhat we call the subconnective relation\u2014relating one\nconnective to another when (roughly speaking) every logical principle\nholding for the first of a pair of connectives also holds for the\nsecond. In fact, all of these concepts are subject to a further\nrelativity. For instance a connective is or is not congruential\naccording to a given logic, with a similar relativity in the\ncase of whether one connective is a subconnective of another. On the\nother hand, as truth-functionality is defined below, a connective is\nor is not truth-functional with respect to a class of\ntruth-value assignments\u2014and various interesting further\nrelations give rise to a corresponding logic-relative version of this\nconcept depending on the different ways a class of truth-value\nassignments is linked to a logic (which in turn depends on how we\nthink of a logic\u2014as an ordinary consequence relation, for\nexample, or as a \u2018multiple conclusion\u2019 consequence\nrelation: see further note 1 below). For some other properties, the\nfurther relativity is a bit different. For example, whether a given\nconnective is uniquely characterized\u2014in the sense of\nbeing governed by rules which when reduplicated to govern a new\nconnective render compounds formed from the same component sentences\nusing the original and the new connective completely\ninterchangeable\u2014is relative not just to a logic but to a\nparticular proof system (set of rules systematizing the logic).\n\nSection 1 introduces the idea of formal sentential languages as\n(absolutely free) algebras, their primitive connectives having the\nstatus of the fundamental operations of these algebras, and explains\nthe notion of a consequence relation on such a language. At a more\ngeneral level, Galois connections are also introduced, and a simple\nobservation made concerning what we call binary relational\nconnections, to be applied in later sections. Section 2 introduces the\nfundamental idea of a valuation for a language (a bivalent truth-value\nassignment to its formulas). Truth-functionality and a generalization\nthereof called pseudo-truth-functionality (of a connective with\nrespect to a class of valuations) are explained, as well as the idea\nof sequents and sequent-to-sequent rules. We then move to a more\ngeneral conception of sequents as originally conceived, allowing a set\nof formulas to play the conclusion role rather than just a single\nformula, as well as to the associated idea of generalized consequence\nrelations, emphasizing Carnap\u2019s motivation for making this\ngeneralization. That motivation can be summarised with reference to\none connective. We take negation as our example. Consider the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of all valuations on\nwhich the usual negation truth-function connective is associated with\nthe negation connective. This can be regarded as the classical logic\nof negation, at least if logics are identified with consequence\nrelations. Now, there are additional valuations consistent with this\nconsequence relation on which the negation truth-function is\nnot associated with the negation connective. (The terminology\nof a valuation\u2019s being consistent with a consequence relation is\nadapted from Dana Scott. A precise definition appears in Section 2.)\nBut when we consider instead generalized consequence relations, the\nanalogous discrepancy does not arise. Section 2 includes a statement\nof a result of D. Gabbay which isolates precisely the truth-functions\nfor which such discrepancies do not arise (roughly: generalizations of\nthe conjunction truth-function and various projection functions), as\nwell as of a result of W. Rautenberg showing that despite this\nexpressive weakness in the apparatus of consequence relations, they\nare sufficiently discriminating\u2014without the need to pass to\ngeneralized consequence relations\u2014to distinguish the logical\nproperties of any two truth-functions (of the same arity).\n\nSection 3 picks up the theme of sequent-to-sequent rules,\nconcentrating on semantic analysis in the style of J. W. Garson of\nsuch rules, and also on the existence and uniqueness of connectives\nsatisfying given rules (a topic introduced by H. Hi\u017c). These last\ntwo are seen to be connected with what we call cut-inductivity and\nid-inductivity of specifically sequent-calculus rules, via, in the\nformer case, a proposal identifying the existence of a connective\n(with prescribed logical behaviour, given the perspective provided by\na logic not explicitly providing such a connective) with conservative\nextension (of the given logic by rules for the new connective\ndetailing that behaviour). This proposal was made by N. D. Belnap;\nsome problems for conservative extension as a sufficient condition for\ngranting the existence or intelligibility of a new connective with\nsuch-and-such logical properties are noted. Section 4 collects several\ncases of interest in which one might wonder about the existence of\nconnectives with various such properties. For instance (this being\nExample 3 out of a total of seven) one might ask if it makes sense to\nhave a 1-ary connective with the property that two applications of\nthis connective are equivalent to a single application of (classical)\nnegation.

Preliminaries\n\nThe connectives of the formal languages of propositional logic are\ntypically expected to exhibit salient features of the\nsentence-connecting devices of natural languages, and especially such\ndevices as are regarded as items of logical vocabulary (and,\nor, not, if\u2013then,\u2026), though it\nwill be no part of our concern to inquire as to what their\n\u2018logicality\u2019 consists in. This is an issue which arises\nfor expressions and constructions such as quantifiers, the identity\npredicate, and so on, and not just for sentence connectives; for this\nissue the entry \u201cLogical Constants\u201d by John MacFarlane\n(2015) should be consulted. The formal languages concerned may be\ntaken to agree in constructing their formulas ultimately on the basis\nof the same countably infinite supply of propositional\nvariables\u2014or \u2018sentence\nletters\u2019\u2014p1,\np2,\u2026, the first three of which we write for\nconvenience as p, q, r. Where they differ\nis in respect of their stock of primitive connectives. So for example,\nwe have the language L = (L, \u2227,\n\u2192, \u00ac, \u22a5) with (set of) formulas L and\nconnectives as indicated, of arities 2, 2, 1 and 0. (We have no qualms\nin the last two cases in speaking of connectives, even when there are\nnot two or more formulas to \u2018connect\u2019. Note that 0-ary or\nnullary connectives are already formulas\u2014sometimes called\nsentential constants\u2014in their own right.) As the notation\nsuggests (with boldface capitals for algebras and the corresponding\nitalic capitals for their universes), we are thinking\u2014in the\nPolish tradition\u2014of languages as algebras, identifying the\nprimitive connectives with the fundamental operations of such\nalgebras, and in particular, as absolutely free algebras of their\nsimilarity types (in the present instance, \u27e82,2,1,0\u27e9) with\nthe pi as free generators. This allows us\nto speak in the usual fashion of the main connective of a\ngiven formula, the variables occurring in and more generally\nthe subformulas of such and such a formula, and so on,\nwithout restricting ourselves to construing the formulas as obtained\nspecifically by concatenating various symbols.\n\nAlongside this \u2018syntactic operation\u2019 sense of\nconnective\u2014explained above for the primitive\nconnectives and extended to derived connectives\npresently\u2014another use of the term is indispensable: to refer to\na connective with particular logical behaviour, as when people want to\ncompare the behaviour of intuitionistic and classical implication. In\ndue course we will see the notion of a consequence relation as one way\nof specifying such behaviour. If \u22a2 is such a relation there is a\nunique language in the above sense which is the language of \u22a2\nand we can think of this \u2018logically loaded\u2019 sense of\nconnective as applying to the ordered pair \u27e8#,\n\u22a2\u27e9; thus in the case of intuitionistic implication this\nwould be \u27e8\u2192,\n\u22a2I\u2009L\u27e9, where\n\u22a2I\u2009L is the consequence relation of\nintuitionistic logic. (In fact it would be preferable to take\nequivalence classes of such pairs under a relation of translational\nequivalence but we will make no further explicit use of these ordered\npairs or any such equivalence classes, and keep this aspect of the\ndiscussion relatively informal. Instead of saying \u201c\u27e8#,\n\u22a2\u27e9\u201d, we will say things like \u201c# as it behaves\naccording to \u22a2\u201d. It would be better still to use not\nconsequence relations\u2014or the later introduced generalized\nconsequence relations\u2014as the second coordinate of the\nrepresentatives \u27e8#, \u22a2\u27e9 but instead to insert here a\nreference to a proof system\u2014a set of sequent-to-sequent rules of\nthe kind introduced below, that is\u2014since important differences\nbetween logics fail to show up at the level which would individuate\nthem merely as consequence\n relations.[1])\n\nThe \u2018languages as algebras\u2019 perspective also allows us the\nconvenience of defining matrix evaluations (see Section\n 5)\n as just homomorphisms from the algebra of formulas to the algebra of\nthe matrix in question, of defining derived connectives and\n(sentential) contexts as term functions (formerly known as polynomial\nfunctions) and algebraic functions (now commonly called polynomial\nfunctions) respectively, and so on. This treatment would need some\nemendation were the discussion to embrace infinitary connectives,\nbranching connectives, and various other exotic devices, but there\nwill be enough to consider without touching on these.\n\nFor example, there is the issue raised by the use of the notation\nabove for the operations of L. Such a choice suggests that\n\u2227, \u2192, \u00ac will represent conjunction, implication (or the\nconditional) and negation\u2014that is, be intended to capture some\naspect of the behaviour of and, if\u2013then, and\nnot, respectively\u2014and that \u22a5 will be some kind of\nfalsity constant. (Similarly, while we are fixing notation, if we had\nwritten \u201c\u2228\u201d, \u201c\u2194\u201d, or\n\u201c\u22a4\u201d, we would be arousing expectations of\ndisjunction, equivalence\u2014or biconditionality\u2014and a truth\nconstant, respectively.) We can think of this as a matter of the\ninference patterns to be sanctioned by some proof system offered for\nL, or as a matter of how the formulas of this language are to\nbe interpreted by assigning suitable semantic values to them\n(truth-values being the simplest candidates here). We refer to the\nformer as a proof-theoretic or syntactical characterization of the\nlogic and the latter as a semantical characterization. The terminology\nis somewhat unfortunate in that a perfectly respectable view in the\nphilosophy of logic (going back at least to Gentzen) has it that the\nmeanings of items of logical vocabulary, such as the\nconnectives of current concern, for a particular reasoner, are given\nby a specification of the set of primitive rules, or a\nfavoured subset thereof, governing those items in a proof system\nrepresenting that reasoner\u2019s (perhaps idealized) inferential\n practices.[2]\n We take up some of those issues later, beginning with a reprise of\nthe semantical side of the story at the start of the following\nsection.\n\nWe need first some general preliminaries, and forgetting the intended\napplication(s) for a moment, let us define, given sets S and\nT, a pair of functions (f, g) to be a\nGalois connection between S and T when\n\u2009f: \u2118(S) \u2192\n\u2118(T) and g:\n\u2118(T)\u2192 \u2118(S), and for all\nS0, S1 \u2286 S,\nT0, T1 \u2286 T, we\nhave S0 \u2286\ng(f(S0)), T0\n\u2286 f(g(T0)),\nS0 \u2286 S1 \u21d2\nf(S1) \u2286\nf(S0), and T0\n\u2286 T1 \u21d2\ng(T1) \u2286\ng(T0). It is well known that the\ncomposition of g with f (respectively, f\nwith g) in such a case is a closure operation on\nS (respectively, on T) in the sense of being a\nfunction (we do the S case) C:\n\u2118(S) \u2192 \u2118(S) satisfying,\nfor all subsets S0, S1, of\nS:\n\nS0 \u2286 C(S0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C(S0) \u2286\nC(S0 \u222a S1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C(C(S0))\n\u2286 C(S0).\n\n\nFurther, where R \u2286 S \u00d7 T, the\ntriple \u27e8R, S, T\u27e9, which we may\ncall a binary relational connection (between S and\nT), induces a Galois connection (fR,gR)\nbetween S and T when we put, for all\nS0 \u2286 S, T0\u2286\nT:\n\n\u2009fR(S0) =\n{t \u2208 T : for all s \u2208\nS0 R(s, t)}\n\ngR(T0) = {s\n\u2208 S : for all t \u2208 T0\nR(s, t)}.\n\n\n(\u201cS\u201d and \u201cT\u201d here are\nmnemonic for \u201cSource\u201d and \u201cTarget\u201d\nrespectively; note that we do not require S \u2229 T\n= \u2205, or even that S \u2260 T.) Suppose we\nconsider, not the sentential languages of our opening paragraph but\nrather first-order languages, and take S as the set of closed\nformulas of such a language and T as the set of models\n(interpretations, structures,\u2026) for that language, then with\nR as the relation holding between a closed formula \u03c6 and\na structure M when M\n\u22a8 \u03c6,\nfR(S0) and\ngR(T0) are usually\ndenoted by Mod(S0) and\nTh(T0). (The labels are intended to\nsuggest \u201cclass of all models of\u201d and \u201ctheory\nof\u201d, respectively.) In this case the derived closure operations\nTh\u2009\u25cb\u2009Mod (mapping\nS0 to\nTh(Mod(S0))) and\nMod\u2009\u25cb\u2009Th (understood\nanalogously) on S and T respectively deliver the set\nof first-order consequences of S0 and the set of\nall models verifying all the sentences verified by every M\n\u2208 T0. When there is\nonly one such M in the latter case, what\nis delivered is the class of structures elementarily equivalent to\nM. (Here we are thinking of classical\nfirst-order model theory.)\n\nReturning to the former case: as this use of the term\n\u2018consequences\u2019 reminds us, a closure operation on the set\nof formulas of some language is conventionally called a\nconsequence operation, and perhaps to use the notation\nCn(\u22c5) rather than simply C(\u22c5), though it\nis often more convenient to talk in terms of the corresponding\nconsequence relation, holding between a set of formulas\n\u0393 and an individual formula \u03c6\u2014notated in some such way\nas \u201c\u0393 \u22a9 \u03c6\u201d, \u201c\u0393 \u22a2\n\u03c6\u201d, etc.\u2014when \u03c6 \u2208 Cn(\u0393); when\nthe relation has been defined semantically it is not uncommon to press\n\u201c\u22a8\u201d into service in this role. (This will occur once\nor twice below.) Certain shortcuts are usually taken with this\nnotation, so that one writes, for example \u201c\u0393, \u0394,\n\u03c6, \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7\u201d and \u201c\u22a2 \u03c6\u201d to\nmean \u201c\u0393 \u222a \u0394 \u222a {\u03c6,\u03c8} \u22a2\n\u03c7\u201d and \u201c\u2205 \u22a2 \u03c6\u201d, respectively.\n(For the moment, capital Greek letters range over sets of formulas.)\nThe conditions given earlier for C\u2019s being a closure\noperation can be recast as conditions definitive of a consequence\nrelation, conditions we do not give explicitly here. A consequence\nrelation \u22a2 on some language is finitary if whenever\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 then we have \u03930 \u22a2 \u03c6\nfor some finite \u03930 \u2286 \u0393; to be\nsubstitution-invariant whenever \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 then\ns(\u0393) \u22a2 s(\u03c6) where s is any\nsubstitution, i.e., any endomorphism of the algebra of formulas (and\ns(\u0393) is {s(\u03c8) | \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393});\nand, finally, to be congruential when \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8 implies \u03c7(\u03c6) \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c7(\u03c8), in which the\nnotation is to be understood as follows. \u201c\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8\u201d abbreviates \u201c\u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c8 and \u03c8\u22a2 \u03c6\u201d\n(and if we are decorating the turnstile \u201c\u22a2\u201d with\nsuperscripts or subscripts, these are written only on the \u22a2 and\nnot also on the \u22a3 part of the composite notation); \u03c7 is some\nformula constructed from propositional variables including at least\none, pk, say\u2014to indicate which we\nmay sometimes write \u03c7 =\n\u03c7(pk)\u2014and \u03c7(\u03c6), for a\nformula \u03c6, is the result of substituting \u03c6 for all occurrences\nof pk in \u03c7. (So \u03c7(\u03c6) is\ns(\u03c7) for the unique substitution s for which\ns(pi) =\npi for i \u2260 k and\ns(pk) = \u03c6.) The\n\u03c7(\u22c5) notation amounts to thinking of \u03c7 as a (sentential)\ncontext, and putting \u03c6 into this context amounts to\nproducing the formula \u03c7(\u03c6); more generally, we can think of an\nn-ary context as a formula containing n\ndistinguished propositional variables\npk1,\u2026,\npkn, say\u2014and\nperhaps additional variables\n too.[3]\n If there are no additional variables, then the formula\n\u03c7(pk1,\u2026,\npkn) can be thought\nof as a derived or composite connective of the language under\nconsideration. Returning to the 1-ary case, when \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c8 we describe \u03c6 and \u03c8 as equivalent according to\n\u22a2, and, following Smiley (1962), when for all \u03c7(\u22c5), the\nformulas \u03c7(\u03c6) and \u03c7(\u03c8) are equivalent according to\n\u22a2, we describe \u03c6 and \u03c8 as synonymous (according\nto \u22a2). Thus a congruential consequence relation is one for which\nany equivalent formulas are synonymous.\n\nThe characterization of the (classical first-order) consequence\nrelation given above was semantic, in that we described it in terms of\nthe consequence operation\nTh\u2009\u25cb\u2009Mod which invokes the\nstructures for the language and what is true in them. A proof system\nfor first-order logic provides a direct syntactic account of when\n\u03c6 is a consequence of \u0393, in terms of derivability using\nrules (and perhaps axioms) sensitive only to the form of the formulas\ninvolved. We could discuss the properties of sentence connectives in\nterms of such quantified languages (in which open as well as closed\nsentences can be their arguments) but to avoid extraneous\ncomplications prefer the setting of the propositional languages with\nwhich we began. And, as in the discussion to this point, we will\ngenerally just say \u201cconnective\u201d, rather than\n\u201csentence connective\u201d.\n\nAny binary relational connection \u27e8R, S,\nT\u27e9, as above, will be said to have conjunctive\ncombinations on the left (right) if for any\ns0, s1 \u2208 S there\nexists s2 \u2208 S such that for all\nt \u2208 T, R(s2,\nt) just in case R(s0,\nt) and R(s1,\nt) (respectively, for any t0,\nt1 \u2208 T there exists\nt2 \u2208 T such that for all s\n\u2208 S, R(s, t2) just\nin case R(s, t0) and\nR(s, t1)); we call\ns2 (respectively, t2) a\nconjunctive combination of s0 and\ns1 (t0 and\nt1) in this case. Replacing the two\n\u201cand\u201ds after the words \u201cjust in case\u201d by\n\u201cor\u201d gives the notion of disjunctive combinations\non the left and right of \u27e8R,\nS, T\u27e9. Both notions admit of an obvious\ngeneralization to the case in which {s0,\ns1} is replaced by an arbitrary subset\nS0 of S, and similarly on the T\nside. We write \u220fL S0 and\n\u2211L S0 for conjunctive and\ndisjunctive combinations, respectively, in this case, and similarly on\nthe right (with an \u201cR\u201d subscript), when we know\neither that such a combination is unique or that, while not unique,\nwhat is being said would be correct however a representative\ncombination were chosen. The subscript is omitted when no confusion is\nlikely. If, as above S0 = {s0,\ns1}, instead of writing\n\u220fS0 (respectively,\n\u2211S0), we write s0 \u22c5\ns1 (respectively, s0 +\ns1), and similarly on the right. To illustrate\nthese concepts, consider the connection \u27e8R, S,\nT\u27e9 with S some non-empty set, T its\npower set, and R the relation of membership (\u2208). There\nare conjunctive combinations and disjunctive combinations on the\nright, being intersections and unions respectively, but there are in\ngeneral neither conjunctive nor disjunctive combinations on the left.\nTaking the former case, a conjunctive combination of\ns0 and s1, where these are\ndistinct elements of S, would be an element of S\nbelonging to precisely those subsets of S to which each of\ns0, s1, belongs\u2014which is\nimpossible since the unit set of this element\u2014as with any unit\nset\u2014contains only one element, and so not both of\ns0, s1. By analogy with the\nabove definitions of conjunctive and disjunctive combinations we can\nalso consider the existence of negative objects on the left and right\nof a relational connection, and note that again the set-theoretic\nexample just given presents is with negative objects on the right (for\nS0 \u2286 S, the corresponding negative\nobject is S \u2216 S0), but not on the\nleft (\u201cno negative individuals\u201d, as philosophers might put\nit, and the point would stand if we switched to the case in which\nT comprised properties\u2014rather than sets\u2014of\nindividuals, reconstruing R accordingly). This absence of\ncombinations simultaneously on the left and right of a relational\nconnection is typical of non-degenerate cases, in that one can easily\nverify that if a relational connection has conjunctive combinations on\nthe left and disjunctive combinations on the right, or vice versa,\nthen it satisfies the following (rather strong) crossover\ncondition:\n\nfor all s0, s1 \u2208\nS, all t0, t1 \u2208\nT, if R(s0,\nt0) and R(s1,\nt1), then either\nR(s0, t1) or\nR(s1, t0).\n\n\n(To see this, assume the antecedent and consider the relation\nR as it relates s0 +\ns1 and t0 \u22c5\nt1\u2014or, for the \u201cvice versa\u201d,\ns0 \u22c5 s1 and\nt0 + t1.)\n2. Sequents and Valuations\n\nLet us return to the propositional languages with which we began. A\nvaluation for such an L is a function from L\nto the two-element set {T, F} (of truth-values). As in the case of\nfirst-order languages touched on above, we put the set of formulas\nL in the source position (i.e. on the left) of our relational\nconnections \u27e8L, V, R\u27e9, with the\nset V of all valuations for L as the target (on the\nright), and R (the \u201cis true on\u201d relation) relates\n\u03c6 \u2208 L to v\n\u2208 V just in case\nv(\u03c6) = T. In view of the one-to-correspondence between\nsets and characteristic functions, this relational connection is just\na mild variant of the \u2208-based relational connection considered\nabove, in particular sharing with it the feature that it has\nconjunctive and disjunctive combinations on the right but not the\nleft, and the feature that no two elements from the left bear the\nrelation R to exactly the same elements on the right, and no\ntwo elements on the right have have exactly the same elements from the\nleft bearing the relation R to them. To get some interesting\nlogic under way, some of these features needed to be disturbed, though\nas we shall see, one of them\u2014the existence of conjunctive\ncombinations on the right\u2014will prove surprisingly tenacious. If\nour interest lies in classical logic, we will be especially keen to\ndiscard most of (the above) V and concentrate only on Boolean\nvaluations, in the sense to be explained now. A function from {T,\nF}n to {T, F} is called an\nn-ary truth-function, and we say that an\nn-ary truth-function f is associated with\nthe n-ary connective # of L on the valuation\nv (for L)\u2014or alternatively, under these same\nconditions, that # is associated with f on\nv\u2014just in case for all\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n \u2208\nL:\n\nv(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)) =\nf(v(\u03c61),\u2026,v(\u03c6n)).\n\n\nWe describe the connective # as truth-functional with respect\nto a class U of valuations when there is some f such\nthat for each v \u2208 U, f is associated\nwith # on v, and as pseudo-truth-functional with\nrespect to U when U is a union of classes of\nvaluations with respect to each of which classes # is\n truth-functional.[4]\n A valuation v is #-Boolean, speaking informally, when the\nexpected truth-function is associated with # on v. More\nspecifically, v, assumed to be a valuation for a language\nsupporting the connectives to be mentioned here, is \u2227-Boolean when\nthe binary truth-function f\u2227 with\nf\u2227(x, y) = T iff x\n= y = T is associated with \u2227 on v, \u2228-Boolean\nwhen a similar association holds for \u2228 and\nf\u2228 defined by f\u2228(x,\ny) =\nF iff x = y = F. We\nassume that the idea is now clear without providing separate\ndefinitions of \u201c\u2192-Boolean\u201d,\n\u201c\u2194-Boolean\u201d, \u201c\u00ac-Boolean\u201d,\n\u201c\u22a5-Boolean\u201d, etc. A Boolean valuation for L is\njust a valuation for L which is #-Boolean for each primitive\nconnective # of L for which a notion of #-Boolean valuation has\nbeen defined. (This is just a way of registering an intended\ntruth-functional interpretation for the connectives # in question.)\nSimilarly we call any connective # for which a notion of #-Boolean\nvaluation has been defined, a Boolean connective, even when discussing\nits behaviour according to a logic not determined by a class of\nBoolean valuations. (This terminology will be explained in due\ncourse.)\n\nA set of truth-functions is strongly functionally complete if\nevery truth-function can be obtained by composition from functions in\nthe set, together with the projection functions, and weakly\nfunctionally complete if every truth-function can be obtained\nfrom functions in the set, together with the projection functions and\nthe operation of passing from an (n+1)-ary function to an\nn-ary function by dropping an inessential argument (an\nargument on which the function does not depend, that is). This\nterminology is transferred from truth-functions to Boolean connectives\nvia the conventional association of such connectives with\ntruth-functions described in the previous paragraph. Thus for example\neach of the sets {\u2227,\u00ac}, {\u2192,\u00ac} is weakly functionally\ncomplete, while {\u2192,\u22a5} is strongly functionally complete.\nThis weak/strong distinction is not usually registered in the literature, and functional\ncompleteness simpliciter is understood as weak functional\ncompleteness. These notions also apply in matrix semantics generally\n(see Section\n 5),\n and there are analogous notions of expressive completeness tailored\nto other areas; two distinct versions of expressive completeness in\nthe area of intuitionistic logic (the distinction being orthogonal to\nthe weak/strong distinction just drawn) are contrasted in Rousseau\n(1968), for example. None of these matters will occupy us further\nhere.\n\nIt is often useful to take a more fine-grained look at the\ntruth-functions in play in the above discussion. Assuming the\nidentification of n-ary functions with certain\n(n+1)-ary relations and the latter with sets of ordered\n(n+1)-tuples, we use the term determinant for the\nelements of a truth-function. Thus the four determinants of the\ntruth-function f\u2192 associated with \u2192 on\n\u2192-Boolean valuations are \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9, \u27e8T, F,\nF\u27e9, \u27e8F, T, T\u27e9, and \u27e8F, F, T\u27e9. Note that the\nfinal entry is the \u2018output\u2019 value for the function\nconcerned. Such determinants will occupy us extensively below.\n\nIn saying that a consequence relation \u22a2 is determined\nby a class V of valuations what is meant that \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c8 if and only if for all v \u2208 V,\nwhenever v(\u03c6) = T for each \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393, then\nv(\u03c8)= T. When \u22a2 has been described by means of some\nproof system (some collection of rules), then the \u201conly\nif\u201d (\u201cif\u201d) direction of this claim amounts to the\nclaim that \u22a2 is sound (respectively, complete)\nwith respect to V. Take the language whose sole primitive\nconnective is \u2227 and the class of \u2227-Boolean valuations. A\nsimple proof system is provided by the rules indicated in the obvious\nway by the following figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u2227I)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03c8  \n\n \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 \n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(\u2227E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c6  \n \n\u00a0,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c8  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nThe rule on the left is usually called \u2227-Introduction while the\ntwo on the right are collectively known as\n\u2227-Elimination\u2014thus \u201c(\u2227I)\u201d and\n\u201c(\u2227E)\u201d\u2014because they take us, respectively, to\nand from a formula with \u2227 as main connective, and they enable us\nto define a consequence relation, \u22a2\u2227 in purely\nsyntactic terms thus: \u0393 \u22a2\u2227 \u03c6 just in\ncase starting with formulas all of which lie in \u0393, successive\napplication of the above rules allows us to pass eventually to the\nformula \u03c6. And then one can show, not only that this is the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of \u2227-Boolean\nvaluations\u2014so that if one began with that class and sought a\nsyntactic codification of the logic it gave rise to, one\u2019s\nsearch would be at an end\u2014but further that the valuations\nconsistent with \u22a2\u2227 are precisely the\n\u2227-Boolean valuations. Here we calling v consistent\nwith \u22a2 when for no \u0393, \u03c8, for which \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c8, do we have v(\u03c6) = T for all \u03c6 \u2208\n\u0393 while v(\u03c8) = F; the \u201cbut further\u201d in\nthe preceding sentence is explained by the fact that every consequence\nrelation \u22a2 is determined by the class Val(\u22a2) of all\nvaluations consistent with \u22a2, which in the case of\n\u22a2\u2227 are precisely the \u2227-Boolean valuations.\n(See the discussion of Gabbay\u2019s result on the\nprojection-conjunction truth-functions below for the extent of this\nphenomenon, which, for example, none of \u2228, \u2192, \u00ac exhibits.)\nThe significance of this is that if one started not with the class of\n\u2227-Boolean valuations (or any other kind of valuational semantics),\nbut with the rules (\u2227I) and (\u2227E) themselves, then that class\nof valuations would force itself on one\u2019s attention anyway as\nthe only class of valuations, preservation of truth on each of which\ncoincided with derivability using those rules. (We return to this\ntheme below, in connection with Carnap, by which time we will have\ntraded in formula-to-formula rules for sequent-to-sequent rules,\nallowing for the convenient representation of inferences in which\nassumptions are discharged.) Moreover, the rules have a considerable\nclaim to the status of rules in accordance with which one must reason\nif one is understanding \u2227 as \u201cand\u201d, as providing a\ncodification of the way in which conjunctive premisses and conclusions\nare reasoned from and to in natural day-to-day reasoning.\n\nNow, as Gerhard Gentzen observed, when we come to formulate similarly\ncompelling principles for introducing and eliminating the other\nconnectives, we find ourselves having to make reference to the\ndischarging of assumptions temporarily made for the sake of\nargument. Such is the case for instance with formulating an\nintroduction rule for \u2192 and with formulating an elimination rule\nfor \u2228. In the case of the former rule, for example, Gentzen took it\nthat the way to derive \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 is to assume \u03c6 and use\nthe various rules and other assumptions to derive \u03c8, at which\npoint the rule (also called Conditional Proof) allows us to claim that\nwe have derived \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 from the remaining assumptions,\nwithout having to record this conclusion as depending on \u03c6 (as\n\u03c8 itself did before the rule was applied). Thus to extend the\npresent approach, known as natural deduction, from \u2227 to\nthese and other connectives, it is necessary to keep track not only of\nwhat formulas we are dealing with at a given stage but also of the set\nof initial formulas, or assumptions, on which that formula depends. We\nwant to say, in the case of the rule just described, that it entitles\nus to pass from \u03c8, as depending on \u0393 \u222a {\u03c6}, to \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8, as depending on \u0393. The ordered pair of a finite\nset of formulas and an individual formula, \u27e8\u0393, \u03c6\u27e9\nwhose first entry records the set of formulas on which its second\nentry depends, we write in the more suggestive notation \u0393\n\u227b \u03c6, and call a sequent, or more explicitly, a\nsequent of the logical framework Set-Fmla.\nFor the variant framework Set-Fmla0,\nwe\nallow also the case in which there is no formula to the right of the\n\u201c\u227b\u201d. Some principles for reasoning about sequents\nwhich do not involve any specific connectives and were called by\nGentzen, structural rules (as opposed to operational\nrules) are the following, which are respectively a zero-premiss, a\none-premiss and a two-premiss sequent-to-sequent rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Id)\n \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6  \n \n\n\n\n(Weakening)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8\n \n  \n \n\n\n\n(Cut)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394 \u227b\n\u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nAs the notation makes clear, we use the same shortcuts in formulations\ninvolving the regular turnstile (\u22a2) as for the current variant\n(\u227b), despite the difference in role played by these two symbols:\nthe former is a metalinguistic predicate and the latter a device for\nseparating the two sides of a sequent. (\u201c\u227b\u201d,\narranging formulas into sequents, is, as Lemmon (1965) says of his\ncorresponding notation, the formal analogue of the word\n\u201ctherefore\u201d, which arranges sentences into arguments. The\nformer is, by contrast, for making comments about such\narguments\u2014for example to the effect that they are valid. Of\ncourse there is a little slack in the analogy for Set-Fmla,\nsince we allow the\ncase where there are no premisses.) Any collection \u03a3 of sequents\nwhich is closed under the structural rules above gives rise to a\ncorresponding (finitary) consequence relation: \u0393\n\u22a2\u03a3 \u03c6 iff for some finite\n\u03930 \u2286 \u0393, we have \u03930\u227b\n\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3. We should also have a sequent-based analogue of\nthe notion of a valuation\u2019s being consistent with a consequence\nrelation; accordingly we say that a sequent \u0393 \u227b \u03c6\nholds on the valuation v just in case we do not have\nv(\u03c8) = T for each \u03c8 \u2208\n\u0393 while also v(\u03c6) = F. (When \u0393 is empty, the\nsequent holds on v just in case v(\u03c6) = T. It\nwould be uncouth to speak of a sequent as being true on a valuation,\nhowever, just as one would not speak of the truth of an argument. Such\nusages are on a par with, and closely allied to, the mistaken\nconception of \u227b as a kind of connective.)\n\nWe can now formulate the desired \u2192-introduction rule so that the\nassumption discharge feature is visible in what happens on the left of\nthe sequent-separator as we move from premiss-sequent to\nconclusion-sequent. We write the elimination rule alongside in a\nsimilar notation; included also are the natural deduction rules for\n\u2228; the earlier rules for \u2227 should be imagined as re-written\nalong similar lines, with assumption-dependencies made explicit:\n\n\n\n (\u2192I) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2192E) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394\n\u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2228I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8  \n \n \u00a0,\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2228E) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394,\u03c6 \u227b\n\u03c7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0398,\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n\n \u0393, \u0394, \u0398\n\u227b \u03c7  \n  \n\n\n\nAlong with the \u2227 rules reformulated in the above\nsequent-to-sequent style, and the structural rule\n(Id)\u2014(Weakening) and (Cut) being derivable\u2014these rules\nrender provable exactly those sequents in {\u2227,\u2228,\u2192}-fragment\nof intuitionistic logic, while for the corresponding fragment of\nclassical logic, one would need to add a further principle governing\nimplication, such as the following subcontrariety rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Subc\u2192)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c8\u00a0\u227b\u00a0\u03c7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393,\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u227b\u00a0\u03c7\n \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c7 \n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n(Equivalently, in view of Weakening, one could give a formulation with\n\u201c\u0394\u201d as a set-variable for the right sequent premiss,\nand carry both \u201c\u0393\u201d and \u201c\u0394\u201d down to\nthe conclusion-sequent, as in the formulation of (\u2192E) above.) In\nthe terminology of Dummett (1991) all of the rules we have seen are\npure (their schematic formulation involves mention only of a\nsingle connective) and simple (each formulation mentions it\nonly once), this last rule is also oblique: a discharged\nassumption has the connective in question as its main connective. One\ncan trade in this obliqueness for a loss of simplicity, changing the\n\u2192-elimination rule from the familiar Modus Ponens principle above\nto a version incorporating Peirce\u2019s Law (\u201c(p\n\u2192 q) \u2192 p \u227b p\u201d), due\nto\n Kanger:[5]\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394\n\u227b (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c7) \u2192 \u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n\n\n\nor sacrifice purity and have a zero-premiss rule \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8), or again just leave the implicational rules as\nthey are and rely on further rules (not given here) governing negation\nto make up the shortfall and render such classically but not\nintuitionistically acceptable \u2192-sequents\u2014such as\nPeirce\u2019s Law above\u2014provable with their aid. (The same\ntensions would then arise for the \u00ac rules, if one regards\nobliqueness as undesirable, with \u201cdouble negation\nelimination\u201d principles abandoning simplicity, or\n\u201cexcluded middle\u201d principles, abandoning purity. Note that\nby a \u2018classically acceptable sequent\u2019 here is meant a\nsequent holding on all Boolean valuations.) An alternative for\ncapturing the classical logic of \u2192 is to change from the logical\nframework Set-Fmla to\nSet-Set, in which\nfinite (possibly empty) sets of formulas appear on the right of the\n\u227b, just as on the left. Then the above \u2192-Introduction rule\ncan be remain intact, but with a set variable to collect side-formulas\non the right: from \u0393, \u03c6\u227b\u03c8, \u0394 to\n\u0393\u227b\u03c6\u2192\u03c8, \u0394. (Suitable modifications\nshould also be made to the remaining rules in this case.) These\n\u2018multiple-succedent\u2019 sequents are more popularly\nassociated with a different approach to logic from the natural\ndeduction approach (though they have often appeared in this setting),\nnamely the sequent calculus approach, in which instead of being\ninserted or removed from the right of the \u227b, by suitable\nintroduction or elimination rules, together with the possible\ndischarge of assumptions, the rules\u2014again, ideally, pure and\nsimple\u2014always insert a connective, either to the left or the\nright, of the \u201c\u227b\u201d.

This changes if we add the rules for negation,\nhere giving both the left and the right insertion rules, initially for\nthe Set-Set case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u00ac Left)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u0394  \n\n \u0393,\u00ac\u03c6 \u227b\n\u0394  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(\u00ac\nRight)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u00ac\u03c6,\n\u0394  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nA Set-Set sequent\n\u0393\u227b \u0394 holds on a valuation v if and only if\nit is not the case that v verifies every formula in \u0393\nwhile falsifying every formula in \u0394; note that this coincides\nwith the definition of \u201cholding on v\u201d given for\nSet-Fmla in the case\nin which \u0394 = {\u03c8} for some \u03c8. Similarly, we have the\nnotion of a generalized consequence relation in which\nsuitably two-sided versions of the conditions definitive of\nconsequence relations are given, which can be found in Shoesmith and\nSmiley (1978), Chapter 2, for example (under the name\n\u2018multiple-conclusion consequence relation\u2019). If \u22a9 is\nsuch a relation on a language L then an L-valuation\nv is said to be consistent with \u22a9 when there\ndo not exist \u0393, \u0394, with v(\u03c6)\n= T for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 and\nv(\u03c8) = F for all \u03c8\n\u2208 \u0394. The class of all such\nvaluations is denoted, much as in the consequence relation case, by\nVal(\u22a9). Sometimes formulations appear below with the phrase\n\u201c(generalized) consequence relation\u201d, meaning that the\nclaim being made or considered applies both in the case of consequence\nrelations and in the case of generalized consequence relations.\n\nOne should distinguish sharply between logical frameworks,\nthat is, choices as to what kind of thing a sequent is (e.g., Set-Fmla\nvs. Set-Set),\non the one hand,\nand approaches to logic, that is, choices as to what kind of\nsequent-to-sequent rules are to be used (e.g., natural deduction\nvs. sequent calculus), on the other. Gentzen (1934) used\nSet-Set for a\nclassical sequent calculus and Set-Fmla\nfor the intuitionistic case. (More accurately,\nsince he had finite sequences of formulas in mind rather than sets,\nand in the latter case allowed empty but not multiple succedents, we\nshould really say something long the lines of Seq-Seq\nand Seq-Fmla0,\nrespectively. Additional structural rules are then needed to allow\npermutation of formulas in a sequence.) Rudolf Carnap (1943) had a\nrather different reason for passing from Set-Fmla\nto Set-Set,\none which is\nsemantically based rather than grounded in considerations of\nproof-theoretic elegance.\n\nLet us forget about \u2192 and \u00ac and the rules governing them, and\nconsider the formulas constructed with the aid only of \u2227 and \u2228.\nOn sequents of Set-Fmla\nin this fragment, classical and intuitionistic\nlogic agree, and the consequence relation\nconcerned\u2014\u22a2\u2227,\u2228, we may call it\u2014is\nthe consequence relation determined by the class of all \u2227- and\n\u2228-Boolean valuations. Carnap\u2019s point is one anticipated\nearlier with the remark that every v \u2208\nVal(\u22a2\u2227) is \u2227-Boolean, which extends to the\ncase of \u22a2\u2227,\u2228: all valuations in\nVal(\u22a2\u2227,\u2228) are \u2227-Boolean, but they are not\nall \u2228-Boolean, for the simple reason that for any consequence\nrelation \u22a2, Val(\u22a2) is always closed under conjunctive\ncombinations, and it is easy to find \u2228-Boolean u,\nv, with u \u22c5 v not\n \u2228-Boolean.[6]\n It is interesting to see this as an appeal to the considerations of\nSection\n 1\n as follows. Consider the binary relational connection between the set\nof formulas in a language one of whose connectives is \u2228 and the\nclass of Boolean valuations, with the relation is true on. We\nhave disjunctive combinations on the left, with \u03c6\n+ \u03c8 as \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, since the\nvaluations on the right are all \u2228-Boolean; therefore we cannot in\ngeneral have conjunctive combinations on the left, since the crossover\ncondition is not satisfied for this connection. The closure claim\napplies quite generally, with \u220f\u2009V \u2208\nVal(\u22a2) whenever V \u2286 Val(\u22a2). This fact\nappears in the philosophical literature in the fact that\nsupervaluations over classes of bivalent valuations deliver the same\nconsequence relation as the original valuations, which is accordingly\nclassical when the valuations are Boolean. (Supervaluations are\nsupposed to be non-bivalent, in verifying those formulas verified by\nall the underlying valuations and falsifying those formulas false on\nall the underlying valuations, with those in neither category being\nneither true nor false on the supervaluation. But everything in this\ndefinition after the words \u201cverified by all the underlying\nvaluations\u201d is mere rhetoric, since all that matters\u2014for a\nsequent\u2019s holding on a valuation or a valuation\u2019s being\nconsistent with a consequence relation\u2014is truth-preservation;\nsetting it to one side, we can identify the supervaluation over\nV with \u220f\u2009V. Likewise in the case of\n\u2018subvaluations\u2019\u2014as in Hyde (2005)\u2014where it is\n\u2211\u2009V that would be relevant.) A special case arises\nwith V = \u2205, for which \u220f\u2009V is the\nunique valuation vT assigning T to every formula\n(of the language in question, to which the claim of uniqueness is\nunderstood as relativized).\n\nOne may wonder which truth-functions are like that associated (on\n\u2227-Boolean valuations) with \u2227 in this respect. More precisely,\nlet \u22a2 be the consequence relation determined by the class of\nvaluations on each of which an n-ary connective\n#f is associated with the n-ary\ntruth-function f. Our question is: for which choices of\nf does \u22a2 enforce the interpretation of\n#f as f in the sense that on every\nv \u2208 Val(\u22a2), #f is associated\nwith f. This question was answered in Dov Gabbay (1978) and\n(1981) (Chapter 1, Section 3) as follows. Say that f (as\nabove) is a projection-conjunction truth-function just in\ncase for some J \u2286 {1,\u2026,n} we have, for\nall x1,\u2026,xn\n(xi \u2208 {T, F}):\n\nf(x1,\u2026,xn)\n= T if and only if for all j \u2208 J,\nxj = T.\n\n\nThen the truth-functions f for which every valuation\nconsistent with \u22a2 (as above) associates #f\nwith f are precisely the projection-conjunction\ntruth-functions. (Gabbay calls #f, as it behaves\naccording to \u22a2, strongly classical in these cases,\nthough his own definition is not formulated in these terms.) By way of\nexample: when n = 1, these are the identity and the\nconstant-true functions, while for n = 2, they are the first\nprojection, second projection, constant true and (Boolean) conjunction\ntruth-functions. (The constant true cases arise by taking J\nas \u2205.) The remaining 12 binary truth-functions thus exhibit the\nbehaviour we saw with the disjunction truth-function; the\ncorresponding connectives are what Gabbay calls weakly\nclassical: determined by a class of valuations over which the\nconnective is associated with a certain truth-function despite the\nexistence of further consistent valuation on which it is not so\nassociated. It is easy to see that the latter phenomenon does not\narise in the case of generalized consequence relations \u22a9, since\nwe can easily write down unconditional conditions on such relations\nwhich enforce the association with a particular truth-function on\nvaluations in Val(\u22a9). This is best seen as proceeding\ndeterminant by determinant. The unenforceable determinant in the case\nof disjunction is \u27e8F, F, F\u27e9, dictating that when the\ndisjuncts have the values listed in the first two positions, the\ndisjunction has the value listed in the final position. This\ndeterminant induces in a familiar way (e.g., Segerberg 1982,\n\u00a73.3) the following condition on \u22a9: that for all \u03c6,\n\u03c8, we have \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u22a9 \u03c6, \u03c8. Alternatively\nput, in Set-Set, as\nopposed to Set-Fmla,\nthere is a set of formulas holding on precisely the \u2228-Boolean\nvaluations, namely that containing, for all formulas \u03c6, \u03c8, the\nsequents \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, and \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8, and\u2014the new case not already available in Set-Fmla\u2014\u03c6\n\u2228\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6, \u03c8. In view of this, we can say that in Set-Set\nthough not in Set-Fmla,\nthe class of\n\u2228-Boolean valuations is sequent-definable, and the same\ngoes for connectives associated with all the other truth-functions not\nmeeting the projection-conjunction test (such as negation and material\nimplication). As the \u2228 example makes clear, by contrast with the\ncase of consequence relations, Val(\u22a9), for a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9, need not be closed under conjunctive\n combinations.[7]\n Again, one can see this in the light of the considerations of Section\n 1,\n thinking of the relational connection between Set-Set\nsequents and\narbitrary valuations, with the relation being \u2018holds on\u2019.\nThis connection supplies disjunctive combinations on the left, with\n\u03c3 + \u03c3\u2032 being the least common weakening of \u03c3\nand\n \u03c3\u2032.[8]\n Thus it cannot also supply conjunctive combinations on the right,\nsince it does not satisfy the crossover condition.\n\nThis approximately Carnapian concern with\nsequent-definability\u2014in particular the exclusion of unwanted\nnon-Boolean valuations\u2014can be taken to a higher level by moving\nfrom questions about sequents and the valuations they hold, to\nquestions about rules and the valuations they preserve the property of\nholding on, as we shall see in Section\n 3,\n after making some further points about the apparatus of consequence\nrelations, or logics in the framework Set-Fmla.\nThe\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations\nalluded to above can be converted into conditions on consequence\nrelations in a straightforward way, illustrated here in the case of\nnegation, with the condition\n\nfor all \u03c6: \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a9 \u2205\n\n\n(induced by \u27e8T, F\u27e9) becoming\n\nfor all \u03c6, \u03c8,: \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8\n\n\nand the condition\n\nfor all \u03c6: \u22a9 \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6\n\n\n(induced by \u27e8F, T\u27e9) turning into the conditional\ncondition on consequence relations \u22a9:\n\nfor all \u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8, if \u0393, \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 and\n\u0393, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 then \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c8.\n\n\nIn a proof system in Set-Fmla\nsuch conditional requirements emerge as\nsequent-to-sequent rules, closure under which (along with containing\nall the sequents corresponding to the unconditional requirements) will\nsuffice to secure completeness\u2014in this case that any unprovable\nsequent fails to hold on some \u00ac-Boolean valuation\u2014without\nthe strong classicality property of having the provable sequents hold\nonly on such valuations. (The process just described\ntransforms the Set-Set\ncondition, \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6,\n\u03c8 (all \u03c6, \u03c8), induced by the Set-Fmla\nunenforceable \u2228\ndeterminant \u27e8F, F, F\u27e9, into the\nconditional condition of closure under the rule (\u2228E).) If\na generalized consequence relation \u22a9 with a Boolean connective #\nin its language satisfies all the conditions induced by the\ndeterminants of the associated truth-function we call \u22a9\n#-classical. Similarly for a consequence relation which\nsatisfies the conditions on consequence\nrelations\u2014conditional conditions\nincluded\u2014derived, as just described, from these\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations.\n(These versions of #-classicality can often be simplified on a\ncase-by-case basis. For example, the \u2227-classicality of a\nconsequence relation or generalized consequence relation\u2014we use\nthe former notation here\u2014is equivalent to its being the case\nthat for all \u03c6, \u03c8, we have (1) \u03c6, \u03c8\n\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, (2) \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6, and (3) \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u22a2 \u03c8. Here we see a three-part condition, instead of\nthe four-part condition comprising the conditions induced by each of\nthe four determinants.)\n\nConsideration of the determinant-induced conditions on generalized\nconsequence relations allows us incidentally to observe, somewhat\nsurprisingly, that consequence relations (and the Set-Fmla\nframework) manage\nto distinguish the logics of any two truth-functions of the same\narity. More precisely, suppose that f and g are\ndistinct n-ary truth-functions, # is an n-ary\nconnective, and Vf and\nVg are the classes of valuations on\nwhich, respectively, f and g are associated with #;\nthen the consequence relations determined by\nVf and Vg\nare distinct. By way of illustration, suppose that n = 3 and\nf and g differ on some determinant beginning with T,\nF, F. (Thus we are considering the case in which the first component\nof a #-compound is true on a given valuation and the second and third\nare false.) Without loss of generality, we can assume that \u27e8T, F,\nF, T\u27e9 \u2208 f while \u27e8T, F, F, F\u27e9 \u2208\ng. The conditions on a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 induced by these determinants are respectively \u03c6\n\u22a9 \u03c8, \u03c7, #(\u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7)\nand \u03c6, #(\u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7) \u22a9 \u03c8,\n\u03c7. Thus in particular, taking \u03c6 as p and each\nof \u03c8, \u03c7, as q, for the generalized consequence\nrelation \u22a9f, say, determined by\nVf and that,\n\u22a9g, determined by\nVg, we have:\n\n\n\n p \u22a9f q,\n#(p, q, q) \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n p, #(p, q, q)\n\u22a9g q.  \n\n\n\nNote that p, #(p, q, q)\n\u22aef q, since otherwise it would\nfollow (by the \u2018cut\u2019 condition on generalized consequence\nrelations) from the first inset \u22a9-statement here that p\n\u22a9f q, which is not the case. Thus\nin view of the second \u22a9-statement, \u22a9f\nand \u22a9g differ on the sequent \u03c3 =\np, #(p, q, q)\u227b q,\nsince \u03c3 \u2208 \u22a9g while \u03c3\n\u2209 \u22a9f. But \u03c3 is a sequent of\nSet-Fmla, so the\nconsequence relations, \u22a2f and\n\u22a2g, say, determined respectively by\nVf and Vg\nalso differ (namely, on \u03c3). We have worked through a simple\nillustration of the general result claimed above, but this case is\nsufficiently representative for the general proof to be\nreconstructed.\n\nIndeed the real moral is more general still. We did not need to use,\nin our worked example, more than the fact that there was some\ndeterminant respected by every valuation in\nVf with the opposite determinant\nrespected by every valuation in Vg, where\nV respects a determinant \u27e8x1,\u2026,xn,xn+1\u27e9\nfor # (with each xi\n\u2208 {T, F}) just in case for all formulas \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\nv(\u03c6i) =\nxi for i\n= 1,\u2026, n implies v(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n= xn+1, and determinants are\nopposite if they differ in precisely their final positions.\n(Actually, inspection of the worked example shows that we also need\nthe classes playing the role of Vf and\nVg also to contain enough valuations to\nassign different truth-values to any pair of distinct propositional\nvariables.) Take the 1-ary connective \u2610 of any familiar modal\nlogic (e.g., S5), for example. We expect it to satisfy the\ndeterminant \u27e8F, F\u27e9, in the sense that the appropriate\nconsequence relation should satisfy the condition induced by this\ndeterminant, since what is necessarily true is true\u2014and thus if\n\u03c6 is false, \u2610\u03c6 should be false\u2014while we do not\nwant any determinant of the form \u27e8T, x\u27e9 to be\nsatisfied. In this case we can describe \u2610 as partially\ndetermined according to the consequence relation in question. On\nthe other hand, if a consequence relation \u22a2 (or a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9) satisfies, for each n-tuple of\ntruth-values, the condition induced by exactly one determinant for the\nn-ary connective #, whose first n entries are as\ngiven by that n-tuple (the final, n+1st,\nentry being either a T or an F), then we say # is fully\ndetermined according to \u22a2 (or \u22a9). By the\ndeterminant-induced conditions on a consequence relation here is meant\nthe conditions on a consequence relation derived as explained (or at\nleast illustrated) above from the directly determinant-induced\nconditions on a generalized consequence relation. As one might expect,\nthis property of connectives relative to consequence relations has an\nintimate relation with the similar property introduced at the start of\nthis section:\n\nA connective # in the language of a consequence relation \u22a2 is\nfully determined according to \u22a2 if and only if there is some\nclass of valuations V such that \u22a2 is determined by\nV and # is truth-functional with respect to V.\n\n\nNote that the two occurrences of the word \u2018determined\u2019\nhere mean quite different things. \u201cFully determined\u201d, as\ndefined above, is a variation on Segerberg\u2019s terminology in his\n(1982) of \u2018type-determined\u2019, varied so as to lend itself\nto other modifications\u2014partially determined,\ncompletely undetermined, overdetermined,\u2026\n(though this last will not be getting attention here)\u2014while the\nsecond occurrence of the word is the usual sound and complete\nsense of \u201cdetermined\u201d. Turning to generalized consequence\nrelations, we find the connection to be more intimate still:\n\nA connective # in the language of a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 is fully determined according to \u22a9 if and only if # is\ntruth-functional with respect to Val(\u22a9).\n\n\nThis implies the statement given for consequence relations (putting\n\u201c\u22a9\u201d in place of \u201c\u22a2\u201d) since a\ngeneralized consequence relation, like a consequence relation, is\nalways determined by the class of all valuations consistent with it.\n(But only the weaker statement above is available for consequence\nrelations, as such cases as that of \u2228 illustrates, since the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of \u2228-Boolean\nvaluations\u2014with respect to to which \u2228 is by definition\ntruth-functional\u2014is also determined by other classes of\nvaluations, with respect to it is not.) Indeed another way of putting\nthe contrast between the consequence relations claim above and the\ngeneralized consequence relations claim is that while for consequence\nrelations #\u2018s being fully determined according to \u22a2 is\nequivalent to some class of valuations which determines\n\u22a2 having # truth-functional with respect to it, for generalized\nconsequence relations we can say that #\u2018s being fully determined\naccording to \u22a9 is equivalent to every class of\nvaluations which determines \u22a9 having # truth-functional with\nrespect to it.\n\nAlong with truth-functionality, we also included a definition of\npseudo-truth-functionality with respect to V. A simple way of\nseeing the relation between these two concepts is in an\n\u2200/\u2203 scope contrast (in which \u201cf\u201d\nranges over truth-functions of the same arity as #): # is\ntruth-functional with respect to V when\n\n\u2203f\u2200v \u2208 V[f is\nassociated with # on v],\n\n\nwhereas # is pseudo-truth-functional with respect to V\nwhen\n\n\u2200v \u2208 V\u2203f[f is\nassociated with # on v].\n\n\nIt is natural to ask after a syntactical condition related to\npseudo-truth-functionality in the same way(s) as full determination is\nrelated to truth-functionality. Say that an n-ary connective\n# is left-extensional in its ith position\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) or right-extensional in\nits ith position, according to a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9, when the condition\n(LEi) or (REi) is satisfied,\nrespectively, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\u03c8 in the\nlanguage of \u22a9 we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEi\n:\n \u03c6i, \u03c8,\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) \u22a9\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n \n  \n\n\n\n\nREi\n:\n #(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u22a9\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n\u03c6i, \u03c8.  \n  \n\n\n\n# is left-extensional (right-extensional) according to \u22a9 if it\nis left-extensional (respectively, right-extensional) in its\nith position for each i (1\n\u2264 i \u2264 n), and finally #\nis extensional according to \u22a9 when # is both left- and\nright-extensional according to \u22a9. For n = 1 we drop the\nsubscript, the above conditions reducing to (LE) and (RE):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n:\n \u03c6, \u03c8, #\u03c6 \u22a9 #\u03c8,  \n  \n\n\n\n\nRE\n:\n #\u03c6\u22a9 #\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03c8.  \n  \n\n\n\nThus (LE) requires that each v \u2208 Val(\u22a9)\n\u201ctreats truths alike\u201d when they are embedded under #, in\nthe sense that when v(\u03c6) =\nv(\u03c8) = T, then v(#\u03c6)\n= v(#\u03c8), while (RE) requires that falsehoods be\ntreated alike in that v(\u03c6) =\nv(\u03c8) = F likewise implies that v(#\u03c6)\n= v(#\u03c8). (It may\nhelp to remark that for \u2194-classical \u22a2 together these amount\nto requiring that \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 \u22a2 #\u03c6\n\u2194 #\u03c8. But we are trying to keep the discussion\n\u2018pure\u2019 so that definitions make sense even when the\nconnective\u2014here #\u2014with the property being defined is the\nsole connective in the language.) The conditions\n(LEi) already make sense as conditions on\nconsequence relations (writing \u22a2 for \u22a9) since there is a\nsingle formula on the right, and we will speak of # as\nleft-extensional according to \u22a2 when they are all satisfied,\nwhile the conditions (REi) need to be converted\ninto conditional conditions as above in the discussion of\ndeterminant-induced conditions. We will illustrate this only for the\nn = 1 case, with (RE) becoming (RE\u2032), understood as\ndemanding for all \u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7:\n\n\n\nRE\u2032\n:\n If \u0393, #\u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7 and \u0393 , \u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c7 and \u0393 , \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7, then \u0393, #\u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c7.  \n\n\n\nTaking it that the intention is clear for the general case what\n(RE\u2032i) should be as a condition on\nconsequence relations, we say that # is right-extensional according to\n\u22a2 when (RE\u2032i) is satisfied for each\ni up to the arity of #, and that # is extensional according\nto \u22a2 just in case # is both left- and right-extensional\naccording to \u22a2. Then paralleling the above results for\ntruth-functionality are the following for\npseudo-truth-functionality:\n\nA connective # in the language of a consequence relation \u22a2 is\nextensional according to \u22a2 if and only if there is some class of\nvaluations V such that \u22a2 is determined by V\nand # is pseudo-truth-functional with respect to V.\n\n\nA connective # in the language of a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 is extensional according to \u22a9 if and only if # is\npseudo-truth-functional with respect to Val(\u22a9).\n\n\nWhether for consequence relations or for generalized consequence\nrelations, we have the following\u2014in general,\nirreversible\u2014implications for the three properties of being\nfully determined, being extensional, and being congruential (as\nexplained below) according to any given (generalized) consequence\n relation:[9]\n\nfully determined \u21d2 extensional \u21d2\ncongruential.\n\n\nwhere this last concept is defined by saying that # is\ncongruential in the ith position\naccording to a consequence relation or generalized consequence\nrelation \u22a2 or \u22a9 (we state the condition only using the\n\u201c\u22a2\u201d notation) just in case for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\u03c8:\n\n\u03c6i \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c8 implies\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u22a3\u22a2\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n\n\nand calling # congruential according to \u22a2 when # is congruential\nin each of its positions according to \u22a2. Clearly a consequence\nrelation is congruential in the sense of Section\n 1\u2014which\n of course also makes sense for generalized consequence\nrelations\u2014precisely when each primitive connective in its\nlanguage is congruential in every position according to it. A similar\nlifting of properties of connectives\u2014\u2018according to\u2019\n(generalized) consequence relations\u2014can be made in the other\ncases too, for example calling a consequence relation fully determined\nwhen each of the primitive connectives of its language is fully\ndetermined according to it. Thus we may say that the consequence\nrelation \u22a2CL of classical logic (with any\ngiven stock of primitive connectives\u2014though we will not further\ndecorate the notation to indicate a particular fragment) is fully\ndetermined and thus also extensional (and congruential), while the\nconsequence relation \u22a2I\u2009L of\nintuitionistic logic is congruential but not extensional, since for\nexample, \u00ac, is not right-extensional according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L. The consequence relation\ndetermined by the well-known three-element matrix of \u0141ukasiewicz\nis not even congruential, since (again) \u00ac is not congruential\naccording to this relation. There is a weaker property than\nextensionality as here defined (for the sake of the above connection\nwith pseudo-truth-functionality) which properly implies left\nextensionality but not right extensionality and which, unlike left\nextensionality itself, implies congruentiality. We could define #,\nhere taken for illustrative purposes again as 1-ary, to be weakly\nextensional according to a consequence relation \u22a2 when for all\n\u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8:\n\n\u0393, \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 and \u0393, \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 imply\n\u0393, #\u03c6 \u22a2 # \u03c8.\n\n\nThus weak extensionality is congruentiality \u2018with side\nformulas\u2019 (collected into \u0393). The obvious adaptation of\nthis notion to generalized consequence relations would be to allow\nside-formulas on the right too (replacing the\nabove\u201c\u22a2\u201d by \u201c\u22a9\u201d and adding a set\nvariable \u201c\u0394\u201d to the right-hand sides, that is): this\nturns out to be equivalent to extensionality for generalized\nconsequence relations as defined above in terms of\n(LEi) and (REi).\n\u22a2I\u2009L is weakly extensional in this\nsense, and weak extensionality according to \u22a2 \u2287\n\u22a2I\u2009L is a property of some theoretical\nsignificance for the case in which the language of \u22a2 adds new\nconnectives in the spirit of the original intuitionistic \nprimitives.[10]\n\n\nReturning to the subject of extensionality, one area in which\nextensional but not fully determined connectives arises is when one\ntakes hybrids of the latter. By the hybrid of disjunction and\nconjunction, for example, understanding \u2228 and \u2227 to have the\ninferential powers conferred on them by a particular logic, is meant a\nbinary connective whose inferential powers are those shared \u2227 and\n\u2228. (See Rautenberg 1989 for this example, and Rautenberg 1991\nand references therein for more in this vein.) Note that the\nconnectives hybridized and the resulting hybrid are connectives in the\n\u2018logically loaded\u2019 sense of Section\n 1\n above.\n\nThere are various ways of defining the hybridization process depend on\nhow much generality one wants, but the following minimally general\ndefinition is the easiest to work with. Start with two (generalized)\nconsequence relations each on the same language, that language having\na single primitive connective, #, say. The hybrid connective is then #\nas it behaves according to the intersection of the (generalized)\nconsequence relations. This way of defining things requires us to\nre-notate the connectives to be hybridized. Thus sticking with the\nexample just mentioned, we consider a copy of the pure \u2227 fragment\nof \u22a2CL, called \u22a2\u2227 earlier\nin this section, but writing # for \u2227\u2014but let us still call\nthis consequence relation \u22a2\u2227\u2014and similarly\nwith the \u2228 fragment. We are then interested in the behaviour of #\naccording to \u22a2\u2227 \u2229 \u22a2\u2228.\n(Where V\u2227 and V\u2228 are\nthe classes of valuations on which # is associated respectively with\nthe Boolean \u2227 truth-function and with the Boolean \u2228\ntruth-function, our intersective consequence relation is that\ndetermined by V\u2227 \u222a\nV\u2228.) This behaviour includes the semilattice\nproperties of idempotence, commutativity and associativity, for\nexample, since these are common to Boolean disjunction and\nconjunction. This particular hybrid connective is partially\ndetermined, since for example \u03c6, \u03c8 \u227b\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 (a sequent formulation of the condition induced\non consequence relations by \u27e8T, T,\nT\u27e9) belongs to \u22a2\u2227\n\u2229 \u22a2\u2228. This by itself does not show that\nthe hybrid is not fully determined, however, and to avoid\nentanglement with some issues about rules, this point is best\nillustrated in terms of the corresponding generalized consequence\nrelations and their intersection, the latter satisfying neither of the\nconditions induced by the determinants beginning T, F: for \u27e8T, F,\nT\u27e9, the condition that \u03c6, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a9 \u03c8\n(failing for # as \u2228) or the determinant \u27e8T, F, F\u27e9, for\nwhich the induced condition is \u03c6 \u22a9 \u03c6 #\n\u03c8, \u03c8 (failing for # as \u2227). (Among issues about\nnon-zero-premiss sequent-to-sequent rules that call for care is the\nfact that while for any such rule under which each of the intersected\nconsequence relations is closed, their intersection is likewise\nclosed, the converse is false: the hybrid consequence relation may be\nclosed under rules under which the originals are not. In the present\ninstance the rule: from \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 to \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 is an example. Similarly for generalized consequence\nrelations the rule: from \u0393 \u227b \u0394 to\n\u0394 \u227b \u0393 makes the same point. This second version\nshows that the current example of hybridization, as conducted in Set-Set,\nyields a symmetric\ngeneralized consequence\n relation.[11])\n\nLet us note in view of the recent reference to \u22a2\u2227\n\u2229\n\u22a2\u2228, there has been an interest in how one\nmight form something like the union rather than the intersection of\nthe two consequence relations involved here. Not quite the union,\nsince that would not be a consequence relation, but something\nanswering to the intuitive idea of a consequence relation embodying\nthe combined logic of conjunction and disjunction. (This is the theme\nof B\u00e9ziau and Coniglio (2010), further taken up in Humberstone\n(2015).) The situation is not exactly dual to that of hybrids, to\nwhich topic we return in the folowing paragraph, because the envisaged\nhybrid logic contains one connective with the common logical\nproperties of (in the present instance) conjunction and disjunction,\nwhereas the combined logic is based on the language with the two\nconnectives. (The precise dual would be a consequence relation on a\nlanguage with a single connective, roughly speaking giving that\nconnective all the logical powers possessed by either disjunction or\nconjunction, and by a result of Wolfgang Rautenberg cited below,\naccording to this consequence relation any formula follows from any\nother. Indeed, this particular instance of Rautenberg\u2019s\nobservation is already well known in the literature on Tonk,\nrecalled in \u00a73 below: any consequence\nrelation in a language including a binary connective which satisfies,\nrelative to that consequence relation, both an \u2228-Introduction\ncondition and also an \u2227-Elimination condition will be one of these\ntrivial consequence relations.\n\nThe hybrid of two fully determined connectives may even be completely\nundetermined (satisfy no determinant-induced conditions at all, that\nis). This will be the case, for example, if we hybridize not\nconjunction and disjunction, but conjunction and negated conjunction\n(sometimes called nand). By using negation in this way, we\nprevent any overlap in the determinant-induced conditions which are\nsatisfied by the hybrid, though there still remain some non-trivial\nproperties (commutativity, for example) as well as\nextensionality\u2014the point of this mention of hybrids\u2014since\nany hybrid of fully determined connectives will still be extensional\n(according to the intersection, that is). Of course, one can also\nhybridize connectives which are not themselves fully, or even\npartially determined\u2014for example, one could investigate the\ncommon properties of \u2610 and \u2662 according to the smallest\nnormal modal logic (commonly called K), though this example\nwould for its most natural development require us to go beyond the\nsimple account of hybrids given here, since it would have to attend to\nthe simultaneous presence of the Boolean connectives alongside these\nmodal operators. A better known modal example of hybrids is that of\nthe \u2610 operator in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s \u0141-modal logic\n(not that \u0141ukasiewicz used this notation for his necessity\noperator), which is a hybrid of 1-ary connectives for the 1-place\nidentity and constant-false truth-functions. (See Chapter 1 of Prior\n(1957) on this point; further references may be found in Section\n 5.)\n\nThe hybrid of two connectives is a subconnective of each of\nthem in the sense that whatever sequents (of the logical framework in\nplay) are provable for it are provable for them. And\nconversely\u2014but for the moment the subconnective relation itself\nwill be the focus of attention. Intuitionistic negation is in this\nsense a subconnective, indeed a proper subconnective (in the\nsense that we do not have the converse) of classical negation. As with\nhybrids, there are various options, of differing degrees of generality\nin their application, for defining this relation. In the case of a\nlanguage with only a single primitive connective, #, we can say that #\nas it behaves according to (e.g.) the consequence relation \u22a2 is\na subconnective of # as it behaves according to \u22a2\u2032 just in\ncase \u22a2 \u2286 \u22a2\u2032. If we want to allow different\nconnectives of the same arity, say # and #\u2032, then we can put\nthis instead by saying that \u03c3(#) \u2208 \u22a2 only if\n\u03c3(#\u2032) \u2208 \u22a2\u2032, for all \u03c3(#),\nunderstanding the latter to denote a sequent with various occurrences\nof # in its constituent formulas, with \u03c3(#\u2032) the result of\nreplacing all such occurrences by #\u2032. This kind of formulation\nlends itself to wider applicability since we can allow other\nconnectives in the formulas of \u03c3(#), provided these are in the\nlanguage of \u22a2\u2032. There is no reason to restrict attention\nto primitive connectives in making such comparisons. For example, each\nof \u2610 and \u2610\u2610 is a subconnective of the other in\nseveral well-known modal logics, as is shown in Zolin (2000), where\nlogics are developed axiomatically as sets of formulas (sequents of\nthe logical framework Fmla, as we would\n say[12])\n so the \u201c\u03c3(#)\u201d would become \u201c\u03c6(#)\u201d\nand the point is that in the logics concerned \u03c6(\u2610) and\n\u03c6(\u2610\u2610) are always equi-provable\u2014though in the\ninteresting cases (e.g., those of K, KT, KTB),\nnot provably equivalent. Note that this is an intra-logical\napplication of the subconnective idea (corresponding to the case of\n\u22a2 = \u22a2\u2032 above, for which we definitely need\nto work with notationally distinguished # and #\u2032). Zolin calls\nsuch mutual subconnectives analogous (\u2018analogous\nmodalities\u2019). A philosophically famous example of this\nphenomenon from bimodal (or more specifically, doxastic-epistemic)\nlogic was reported in Byrd (1973).\n\nEarlier in this section we saw that, where\nVf and Vg\nare the classes of valuations for a language with n-ary\nconnective # on which distinct truth-functions f and\ng are associated with # respectively, the consequence\nrelations determined by Vf and\nVg were always distinct. In the present\nterminology, this means that either # as it behaves according to the\nfirst of these consequence relations is not a subconnective of # as it\nbehaves according to the second, or vice versa. This is obvious for\ngeneralized consequence relations as one can read off the difference\nfrom the unconditional conditions induced by the determinants of\nf and g, but we saw (in a worked example) that such\ndifferences are also guaranteed to emerge at the relatively cruder\nlevel of consequence relations. A stronger conclusion can be drawn\nfrom Theorem 4 of Rautenberg (1981) (see also Rautenberg 1985, p.\u00a04), which will not be proved here, and for the statement of which we\nneed to explain that a non-trivial consequence relation\n\u22a2 is one for which there exist formulas \u03c6, \u03c8 in the\nlanguage of \u22a2 such that \u03c6 \u22ac \u03c8; for some of the\nmatrix terminology here, see Section\n 5:\n\nLet M be any two-element matrix with one designated value. Then\nthe consequence relation \u22a8M determined by\nM is not properly included in any non-trivial\nsubstitution-invariant consequence relation on the same language.\n\n\nAs one very special case of this maximality result, in which the\nalgebra reduct of M has only a single fundamental operation\n(f, as above, say), we get a stronger conclusion about the\nconsequence relations \u22a2f and\n\u22a2g determined by\nVf and Vg\nthan our earlier conclusion that these consequence relations are\ndistinct: we get the conclusion that neither is included in the other.\nTaking the A and D of M = (A,\nD) as ({T, F}, f) and {T}, the consequence relation\n\u22a2f is what Rautenberg is calling\n\u22a8M, and if this were properly included in\n\u22a2g we should have a contradiction with the\nabove result, since the latter consequence relation is certainly\nnon-trivial and substitution-invariant. Thus informally speaking, even\nin the relatively undiscriminating framework Set-Fmla,\nthe logic of one\ntruth-function never subsumes that of another. Less informally: even\nin Set-Fmla, a fully\ndetermined connective is never a proper subconnective of another fully\ndetermined connective.\n\nWe conclude this section with two observations prompted by this\nresult. The first concerns whether anything was gained by our earlier\nlooking at the argument for the weaker result (understood in the light\nof the above conventions) to the effect that, f \u2260\ng implies \u22a2f \u2260\n\u22a2g. The answer to this question is that\nalthough the result is weaker, the proof yields something stronger:\nany difference in determinants yields a difference in unconditional\ndeterminant-induced conditions. Considered as sequents (with\npropositional variables replacing the schematic letters in the induced\nconditions) these have a very special form, and, transferring\nDummett\u2019s terminology (seen earlier in this section) for rules,\nacross to sequents, we note that they are all included in the class of\npure and simple sequents: sequents in which there is only one\nconnective to occur and it occurs only once in the sequent. Suitably\nabstracting from our earlier worked example, we can see that any\nconnectives satisfying the conditions induced by even one pair of\nopposite determinants (whether or not any remaining\ndeterminant-induced conditions are satisfied) are bound to differ on a\npair of pure and simple sequents. But the analogue of\nRautenberg\u2019s result does not hold in this form: that the set of\npure and simple sequents satisfied by the one and the set satisfied by\nthe other are incomparable with respect to inclusion. For example,\nconsider the case of the 1-ary truth-functions Boolean negation and\nthe constant-false function. We can cite #p \u22a2\nq as an example of a pure and simple sequent which holds on\nevery valuation on which 1-ary # is associated with the constant-false\nfunction but not on every valuation on which it is associated with the\nnegation function. But an inspection of possible cases reveals that\nthere is no pure and simple sequent valid for the negation\ninterpretation of # which is not also valid for the constant-false\ninterpretation. (Of course there are sequents doing this\u2014e.g.,\np \u227b ## p but, though pure, they are not\nsimple. And, yes, in Set-Set,\nwe can always find pure and simple witnesses to\nthe non-inclusion of the one logic in the other: the\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations\nwill serve in this capacity.)\n\nFor the second observation, we note a more linguistic reformulation of\nRautenberg\u2019s result, for which we first need a brief digression\non defined connectives. A connective derived by composition from a set\nof primitive connectives yields a defined connective in one of two\nways, depending on one\u2019s views of definition. On one view,\nisolating the derived connective is already giving a definition: one\nhas a formula \u03c6(p1,\u2026,\npn) in which exactly the exhibited\nvariables occur, which since it is constructed from these variables\nvia the primitive connectives constitutes a derived connective,\napplying to formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u2009\u03c8n to yield\nthe formula \u03c6(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\nwhich results from substituting \u03c8i\nuniformly for\npi in \u03c6(p1,\u2026,\npn). We can introduce a shorthand\nto such substitution-instances, denoting \u03c6(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\nby \u201c#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\u201d,\nfor instance\u2014as in calling the formula \u00ac(\u03c81\n\u2227 \u00ac\n\u03c82) by the name \u201c\u03c81 \u2192\n\u03c82\u201d. (Of course this would only be a good idea if\nthere is nothing better to mean, or which is already meant, by\n\u2192\u2014as there would be in intuitionistic logic, for instance.)\nThat is the first view of\n definition.[13]\n On the second view, rather than just being a metalinguistic\nabbreviation, the defined connective is an addition to the object\nlanguage: we add (to continue with the example just given) a new\nprimitive connective \u2192, along with a stipulation that compounds\nof the form \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 are to be\nsynonymous with those of the corresponding form\n\u00ac(\u03c81 \u2227 \u00ac \u03c82). We need not\nchoose between these views here, but some formulations are sensitive\nto which view is taken. In particular, if we have classical logic with\nprimitives \u00ac and \u2227, we may still wish to consider its\nimplicational fragment\u2014in Set-Fmla,\nsay, where this would be the restriction of\n\u22a2CL to formulas constructed using only the\nconnective \u2192. On the first view of definition, we cannot\nliterally do that, since to use \u2192 is ipso facto to use\n\u00ac and \u2227, so what is meant is rather than the only occurrences\nof \u00ac and \u2227 are such as occur in subformulas of the form\n\u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 in virtue of these being\nthe formulas \u00ac(\u03c81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c82). On\nthe second view of definition, we have expanded the\nlanguage-as-algebra by adding a new fundamental operation \u2192 and\ncan now consider the subalgebra generated by the propositional\nvariables of the reduct of this algebra obtained by discarding the\nother fundamental operations.\n\nNow let \u03c61 and \u03c62 any two classically\nnon-equivalent formulas in the same variables,\np1,\u2026, pn for\ndefiniteness, and consider the consequence relations\n\u22a21 and \u22a22, where \u22a21\nis the restriction of \u22a2CL to formulas\nconstructed using the n-ary connective # defined thus:\n\n#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n) =\n\u03c61(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n),\n\n\nand \u22a22 is the analogous restriction of\n\u22a2CL this time to the #-fragment with # defined\nby:\n\n#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n) =\n\u03c62(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n).\n\n\nSince each of \u03c61 and \u03c62 fixes an\nn-ary truth-function of the variables involved, and these\ntruth-functions are distinct (since \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 were to be non-equivalent) the above\nVf\u2009/\u2009Vg\napplication of Rautenberg\u2019s result tells us that neither of\n\u22a21, \u22a22, is included in the other.\nConcentrating on the connectives involved, we can put this by saying\nthat in classical logic any two non-equivalent connectives are\nincomparable with respect to the subconnective relation (understood as\nrelating the consequence relations on languages in which no further\nconnectives appear). We close by observing that the analogous claim\nwould be false for intuitionistic logic. A counterexample is provided\nby the connectives defined by \u03c6 #1\n\u03c8 = \u00ac\u03c6\u2228 \u00ac\u03c8 and \u03c6\n#2 \u03c8 = \u00ac(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8). These are\nintuitionistically non-equivalent, in the sense of not always yielding\n\u22a2I\u2009L-equivalent compounds from the same\ncomponents, while\u2014by an argument not given here\u2014for any\nintuitionistically provable sequent \u03c3(#1) involving\nformulas constructed from the variables by means of #1, the\ncorresponding sequent \u03c3(#2) is also\nintuitionistically provable (though not conversely). So, by contrast\nwith what can happen in the classical setting, we have non-equivalent\nconnectives one of which is a proper subconnective of the\nother\u2014understanding this last phrase subject to the same\nparenthetical qualification as above.\n3. Rules and Connectives\n\nFor this section the focus will be on rules governing the various\nconnectives, beginning with a deferred topic from Section\n 2:\n the transfer of Carnap-inspired questions of the range of valuations\non which the sequents provable in this or that logic hold to question\nabout the range of valuations on which the sequent-to-sequent rules\npreserve the property of holding. We will also revisit the\nsequent-calculus operational rules from early in Section\n 2\n and look at some of their properties, as well as at some interesting\nvariations on the structural rules which work alongside them. One\ntopic\u2014or pair of topics\u2014raised by such investigations is\nthe issue of the existence and uniqueness of connectives exhibiting\nprescribed logical behaviour (such as might be enshrined in various\nrules), an issue bearing on all approaches to logic and not just the\nsequent calculus approach. Finally we look at a pair of concepts\napplying to connectives as they behave in particular logics: the\nconcept of a universally representative connective and the concept of\na \u2018special\u2019 connective.\n\nBeginning, then, with the preservation behaviour of rules (as in\nGarson 1990 and 2001) it is necessary first to distinguish a\n(sequent-to-sequent) rule\u2019s having a local preservation\ncharacteristic with respect to a class V of\nvaluations\u2014that for each v \u2208 V, the rule\npreserves the property of holding on v\u2014from its having\na global preservation characteristic with respect to V: if\nthe premiss-sequents hold on every v \u2208 V, then\nthe conclusion-sequent holds on every v \u2208 V.\nFor brevity, a sequent will be called V-valid when\nit holds on each v \u2208 V. Then we distinguish the\nlocal range of a rule \u03c1, denoted Loc(\u03c1) from its\nglobal range, Glo(\u03c1), taking the definitions as relative\nto a background language the class of all valuations for which we\ndenote by U:\n\nLoc(\u03c1) = {v \u2208 U : \u03c1 preserves\nthe property of holding on v}\n\nGlo(\u03c1) = {V \u2286 U : \u03c1 preserves\nV-validity}.\n\n\nIt is also natural to define the local and global range of a\ncollection R of rules, by setting Loc(R) =\n\u2229\u03c1 \u2208\nRLoc(\u03c1) and\n\nGlo(R) = {V \u2286 U : each \u03c1\n\u2208 R preserves V-validity}.\n\n\nNote that while the local range of a rule or set of rules is a set of\nvaluations, the global range is a set of sets of valuations. But in\nsome cases there is an especially simple relationship between the two,\nnamely that Glo(R) =\n\u2118(Loc(R)). This happens whenever R\ncomprises only zero-premiss rules, and, more interestingly, when the\nrules in R are interderivable with a set of such rules, given\nthe structural rules (Id), (Weakening), and\n (Cut),[14]\n as in the case of the natural deduction rules for conjunction\nR = {(\u2227I), (\u2227E)} or the corresponding sequent\ncalculus rules {\u2227\u2009Right, \u2227\u2009Left} where\nLoc(R) comprises precisely the \u2227-Boolean\nvaluations. Evidently, the strong classicality phenomenon of Section\n 2\n is making its presence felt here, and we should contrast the\nsituation with disjunction (in Set-Fmla).\nFor R = {(\u2228I), (\u2228E)},\nLoc(R) is the class of \u2228-Boolean valuations, but\nthe same is the case if (\u2228E)\u2014the rule of current interest\nsince it has no zero-premiss equivalent\u2014is replaced by another\nwhich is far from interderivable with it (even given the structural\nrules and (\u2228I)):\n\n\n\n\nA \u227b B  \n\n A \u2228 B\n\u227b B  \n\n\n\nThus the local range is not very informative as to the precise\nsignificance of such a rule as (\u2228E) and it is natural if one thinks\nof the rules as giving the meanings of the connectives they govern (a\nperspective mentioned in Section\n 1)\n and wants to distill this information into a semantics in terms of\nvaluations, to consider the global range. To do so we make use of the\npartial order \u2264 on the underlying set U of valuations (for\nthe language under consideration) defined by: u \u2264\nv if and only for all formulas \u03c6, if u(\u03c6) =\nT then v(\u03c6) =\n T.[15]\n As Garson (2001) observes, the global range of the introduction and\nelimination rules for \u2228 (and again we could equally well cite the\nsequent calculus rules in this connection) is the set of all\nV \u2286 U such that for all u \u2208\nV and all formulas \u03c6 and \u03c8, the following condition\nis\n satisfied:[16]\n\n\n\n\n[\u2228]Garson\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n u(\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) = T iff for all formulas \u03c7\nsuch that u(\u03c7) = F, there exists\nv \u2208 V with u\n\u2264 v, v(\u03c7)\n= F and either v(\u03c6)\n= T or v(\u03c8)\n= T.  \n\n\n\nWhile we cannot go into the details of Garson\u2019s program here,\nits aim should be noted: to arrive at the \u2018natural\nsemantics\u2019 implicit in the rules governing a connective # (here\nassumed n-ary) in the sense of a characterization of their\nglobal range as comprising those V of valuations satisfying a\ncondition of the form: \u2200u \u2208 V,\nu(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)) =\nT if and only if \u2026, where the dots are replaced by something\nwhich would render this biconditional suitable as a clause in the\ninductive definition of truth on a valuation u \u2208\nV. Garson worries about the use of \u2264 on this score in what\nwe are calling [\u2228]Garson (and has various suggestions to\noffer), as well as about the explicit quantification over \u03c7 which\nintroduces an potential element of circularity or impredicativity (in\nparticular because \u03c7 need not have a lower complexity\u2014be\nconstructed with the aid of fewer primitive connectives, that\nis\u2014than \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 itself); related concerns are aired in\nWoods (2013). One way of getting rid of the latter feature is to\nmassage [\u2228]Garson into the following equivalent form,\nwhich makes extensive use of conjunctive combinations of valuations,\nand uses the notation |\u03c7| which, for a formula \u03c7, denotes the\nset of v\u2208 V such that v(\u03c7) =\nT:\n\nu(\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) = T iff \u2203 U0,\nU1 \u2286 V: U0\n\u2286 |\u03c6|, U1 \u2286 |\u03c8|,\n \nand u = \u220f U0 \u22c5\n\u220f U1.\n\n\nIn place of this last \u201c\u220f U0 \u22c5\n\u220f U1\u201d, we could equally well have\nwritten \u201c\u220f (U0 \u222a\nU1)\u201d, of course. The form as written is more\nsuggestive of the many variations on the semantic treatment of\ndisjunction in the literature\u2014the Beth semantics for\nintuitionistic logic, for instance, and the treatment of disjunction\nfor relevant (or \u2018relevance\u2019) and other substructural\nlogics to be found in Ono and Komori (1985), Or\u0142owska (1985,\n455), and Bell (1986), to cite only some papers\nfrom the 1980s.[17]\nWe will not discuss other\nconnectives from this perspective here, or comment further on\nGarson\u2019s program. See Garson (2001) for a discussion of the\nglobal ranges of the usual sets of introduction and elimination rules\nfor \u2192, \u00ac and\n \u2194.[18]\n Garson\u2019s approach to these matters has, it should be noted,\nundergone further evolution since the publications cited in this\ndiscussion: see Garson (2013).\n\nThe idea which, has just re-surfaced in our discussion, apropos of\nGarson, that the natural deduction introduction and elimination rules\ntogether, or perhaps just the introduction rules alone\n(Gentzen\u2019s preferred\n position),[19]\n somehow fix the meanings of the connectives they govern, often goes\nhand in hand with considerations of the existence and the uniqueness\nof a connective answering to the said rules, considerations first\nraised by H. Hi\u017c, according to Belnap (1962). Belnap was replying\nto Prior (1960) in which the idea that any old set of rules could be\nstipulated to fix the meaning of a proposed connective, was contested\nwith the aid of the subsequently much-discussed example Tonk,\na supposed binary connective for which an\nintroduction rule allowed the passage from (arbitrary) \u03c6 to \u03c6\nTonk \u03c8, as with \u2228-introduction from the\nfirst disjunct, and an elimination rule allowed the passage from \u03c6\nTonk \u03c8 to \u03c8, as with \u2227-elimination\nto the second conjunct. (This was the point anticipated in \u00a72\nwhen the Tonk problem was mentioned apropos of\nthe dual to hybridizing conjunction and disjunction.) Since this\nallowed, by successively applying (Tonk-I) and\nthen (Tonk-E), any \u03c8 to be derived from\nany \u03c6, Prior took this to show that no coherent meaning had been\nconferred on Tonk by the proposed rules, and\nto refute the general thesis that the meaning of a connective can be\nfixed by means of rules governing it. (Prior saw Popper and Kneale as\nthe targets of his argument, which does not touch Gentzen\u2019s view\nthat the meaning is fixed by the totality of introduction rules for a\nconnective, coupled with the fact that these are the totality of such\nrules. Since there is only the one way of introducing Tonk,\nnamely that provided by (Tonk-I),\nwhere the premiss is \u03c6 the meaning of\n\u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 is simply that of \u03c6 and\nthe appropriate elimination rule is not that given by Prior\nbut rather one licensing an elimination to the first\n\u201ctonkjunct\u201d.) Belnap responded that what was wrong with\nPrior\u2019s Tonk rules was that a proof\nsystem antecedently endorsed for the connectives in use would be\nnon-conservatively extended by the enrichment of the language with\nTonk in tandem with supplementing the proof\nsystem with the (Tonk-I) and then (Tonk-E),\nsince they allow the derivation of the\nsequent \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 even for Tonk-free\n\u03c6,\n \u03c8.[20]\n Later in this section, we return to Tonk and\nexamine its behaviour in a sequent calculus setting.\n\nOf course, one expects the addition of new rules to make for the\nprovability of new sequents, but the extension should be\nconservative in the sense that no new sequents exclusively\ninvolving the old vocabulary become provable. Belnap\u2019s\ndiscussion suggests that the existence of a connective obeying certain\nrules should be conceded by someone endorsing a particular proof\nsystem if and only if the addition of that connective to the language\nand those rules to the proof system yields a conservative extension.\n(There are other things one might mean by the question of whether from\nthe perspective of a given logic, a connective with such-and-such\nlogical powers exists\u2014most evidently, whether or not such a\nconnective is already definable in the logic. Showing that rules\nascribing the powers in question would extend the logic\nnon-conservatively would be one dramatic way of showing no such\nconnective to be definable, but since it could fail to be definable\nwhile still being conservatively addable, the questions need to be\nkept distinct.)\n\nOne snag for such a suggestion is that examples can be found involving two connectives with associated sets of rules\neach of which sets of rules yields a conservative extension of an initial proof system,\napparently requiring the answer \u201cyes, there does exist such a\nconnective\u201d in each case from the perspective of that original system, while extending the initial proof system with\nboth sets of rules at once is non-conservative\u2014undermining this double\nendorsement.[21] We may conclude that while yielding a non-conservative\nextension of a favoured proof system is sufficient to denying the\nexistence or intelligibility of a connective with such-and-such\nlogical properties, there may be other grounds for returning such a\nverdict. Boolean negation comes under just such a critique in Chapter\n5 of Priest (2006), where such problems for Belnap\u2019s account are\nraised and references to the technical literature establishing the\nconservativity of extending certain logics in the relevance tradition\nwith suitable principles governing this connection can also be found.\n(For an earlier presentation of this point, see also Belnap and Dunn\n1981, p. 344, and for a related discussion, Restall 1993, esp.\n\u00a75.) It should be noted also that the conservativity test raises\nissues of its own, independently of the question of whether passing it\nis necessary and sufficient (and what we have been querying is the\nsufficiency half of this package) for acknowledging the existence of a\nconnective. For example, there are sentential connectives which\nconservatively extend intuitionistic propositional logic in\nany of its conventional presentations as a proof system, but\nnon-conservatively extend intuitionistic predicate logic. The\nbest known is dual intuitionistic implication (see\nL\u00f3pez-Escobar\n 1985).[22]\n Returning to the conservative extension criterion of existence, let\nus note that a related connective, dual intuitionistic negation, can\nbe added conservatively to intuitionistic predicate (and a\nfortiori propositional logic) but already at the propositional\nlevel produces violations of the disjunction\nproperty\u2014that \u227b\u00a0\u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8 should only be provable if at least one of\n\u227b\u00a0\u03c6, \u227b\u00a0\u03c8, is provable\u2014which on\nsome accounts (e.g., Gabbay 1977 and 1981) renders it illegitimate\nfrom an intuitionistic perspective. Finally, it should be observed\nthat an adherent of intuitionistic logic might be expected to take a\ndim view of a proposed new connective with rules conservatively\nextending that logic but not conserving synonymies, in the sense that\nformulas in the original language which are synonymous according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L are no\nlonger so according to the consequence relation associated with the\nextended proof system. This happens in at least the most\nstraightforward extension of intuitionistic logic by what is called\nstrong\n negation.[23]\n\nThe issue of uniqueness, as opposed to existence, of connectives (in\nthe logically loaded sense of the term, naturally) is best approached\nby considering when a collection of rules governing a connective\nuniquely characterize that connective in the sense that if\naccompanied by corresponding rules governing a \u2018duplicate\u2019\nversion of that connective (of the same arity) result in the synonymy\nof compounds formed from the appropriately many components and the\noriginal connective with compounds formed from the duplicate\nconnective from the same components. In a congruential setting the\nreference to synonymy can be replaced by one of equivalence, in the\nsense of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence in the consequence relation or\nSet-Fmla framework,\nwith suitable variations for other frameworks. Without the assumption\nof congruentiality one should perhaps distinguish unique\ncharacterization to within synonymy from unique characterization to\nwithin equivalence. And because the rules in question may not be pure,\nbut involve other connectives, it may be necessary to speak of # being\nuniquely characterized (by the given rules) in terms of the\nother connectives involved, so that when the reduplicated system is\nconsidered, # is replaced by its duplicate, #\u2032, say, while the\nother connectives remain as they are. We will not be considering these\ncomplications here. It is easy to see that the natural deduction rules\nfor the various connectives given in Section\n 2\n as well as the sequent calculus rules all uniquely characterize the\nconnectives they govern. (Note that, since this includes the\nintroduction and elimination rules for \u2192, which are shared by any\nnatural deduction system for intuitionistic logic, the rules may\nuniquely characterize a connective which is not fully\ndetermined\u2014not amenable to a truth-functional interpretation.\nThe same applies in respect of negation, though we did not cover this\nin our discussion of natural deduction.) This feature is sometimes\nregarded as necessary for the connectives concerned to be regarded as\nlogical constants, although, as explained in Section\n 1,\n we are not pursuing that issue here.\n\nA related issue involving both uniqueness and existence does deserve\nattention, however, arising over competition between logics, differing\non the rules governing a connective where the first logic has rules\nwhich suffice to characterize uniquely a connective and the second has\nall these and more governing that connective. The standard example of\nthis is provided by intuitionistic logic and classical logic in\nrespect of negation. The fact that the classical rules go beyond the\nintuitionistic rules and yet the latter already suffice for unique\ncharacterization means that there is no \u2018live and let\nlive\u2019 option available for the intuitionist, of recognising that\nthe intelligibility of two distinct negation connectives, classical\nand intuitionistic, which can cohabit in the same proof system each\nwith their respect rules. This should be possible according to those\nwho think that any difference in the logical principles governing a\nconnective reflect a difference as to what is meant by the connective\n(W. V. Quine\u2019s view\u2014see Section\n 5\n below), since once a difference in meaning is acknowledged, the\npreviously ambiguous connective, \u201c\u00ac\u201d, in the present\ninstance, should be replaceable by connectives registering the\ndisambiguation\u2014\u00aci and \u00acc,\nsay\u2014and the intuitionistic and classical logician should be able\nto use whichever they take a special interest in, with no further fear\nof talking at cross-purposes in each other\u2019s company. But of\ncourse this is not a possibility, since the rules governing\n\u00aci characterize it uniquely and those governing\n\u00acc duplicate them\u2014think of \u00acc as\n\u00aci\u2032, in terms of the above\ndiscussion\u2014and do more (securing the provability of\n\u00acc\u00accp \u227b p, for\nexample). The result is that the two connectives form equivalent\ncompounds in the reduplicated system and all of the intuitionistically\nunwanted properties of \u00acc spill over to infect\n\u00aci: we can now prove \u00aci\n\u00acip \u227b p, and so on. The\nconciliatory offer of a purportedly disambiguating notation along\nthese lines is one no advocate of intuitionistic logic can afford to\naccept. (By imposing restrictions on some of the intuitionistic rules,\none can produce candidates for the title of \u2018combined\nclassical-and-intuitionistic proof system\u2019\u2014as, for\nexample, in Fari\u00f1as del Cerro and Herzig (2001)\u2014but,\nespecially on views according to which the rules of one\u2019s logic\narticulate the meanings of the connectives they govern, resistance to\nany such restrictions is entirely understandable. Imagine an encounter\nwith aliens in which they told us that to explain what they meant by\nsome items of their vocabulary we had to be prepared to restrict the\nprinciple that \u03c8 followed from \u03c6 and \u03c8 for\ncertain choices of \u03c8 involving translations of that vocabulary\ninto English.)\n\nThe above line of thought points in some interesting further\ndirections. For example, the intuitionistic natural deduction rules\ngoverning \u2227 (in Set-Fmla),\nwhich are the same as the classical ones, are\nthemselves stronger than the following\n rules:[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03c7 \u227b \u03c8\n \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u03c7 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c7 \u227b \u03c8 \n\n  \n\n\n\nWe can take the intuitionistic (and classical) rules to differ from\nthese in replacing the formula variable \u03c7 with a set-of-formulas\nvariable \u0393. The latter set is stronger in the sense that there\nare sequents provable with its rules (e.g., p, q\n\u227b p \u2227 q) which are not provable on the\nbasis of the displayed rules (together with the standard structural\nrules, if desired). But clearly the displayed rules uniquely\ncharacterize \u2227, since, once we reduplicate them for \u2227\u2032,\nwe can take \u03c7 in the second and third (collectively,\n(\u2227E)-style) rules to be \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, to derive both \u03c6\n\u2227 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c8, from\nwhich by the reduplicated version of the first\n(\u201c(\u2227\u2032I)\u201d) rule we derive \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 \u2227\u2032 \u03c8\u2014with a similar derivation for\nthe converse sequent.\n\nThis example may seem far-fetched from the point of view of\nmotivation, but the dialectical upshot is clear\u2014if the \u00ac\nrules are objectionable in being stronger than needed for unique\ncharacterization, the same holds for the intuitionistic \u2227 rules;\nin any case there are in fact variations on this theme is that have\nbeen seriously proposed as weakenings of classical (or intuitionistic)\nlogic in the construction of quantum (or ortho-) logic, in which the\nrule (\u2228E) is subjected to restrictions blocking arbitrary sets of\nside-formulas\u2014the \u0394 and \u03b8 of our formulation of this\nrule in Section\n 2\u2014exactly\n as with the \u2227 rules inset above (which would be fully general in\nthe respect at issue if our chosen framework were what would naturally\nbe called Fmla-Fmla, a\nframework occasionally used for logical\n investigations).[25]\n One could explore the idea of a requirement that all rules should be\nmaximally general in respect of side formulas, to resist such\npressures to weaken the intuitionistic rules, though what this amounts\nto depends on the logical framework, and it may be hard to hold the\nline without succumbing to a similar pull in the direction of\ngenerality which would take us over from Set-Fmla\nto Set-Set.\n\nThe sensitivity to logical framework of issues of unique\ncharacterization is well illustrated with the case of modal logic. It\nis possible to fabricate special purpose logical frameworks which\nallow for the formulation of rules uniquely characterizing \u2610 in\nall normal modal logics (Blamey and Humberstone 1991), but without\nsuch exotic devices, unique characterization is limited to the case in\nwhich \u2610 is fully determined\u2014among the normal modal\nlogics, then, just to that for which \u22a2 \u2610\u03c6 for all\n\u03c6, and that in which \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2 \u2610\u03c6 for all\n\u03c6.\n (Note  34 is relevant here. The \u201c\u22a2\u201d just used stands for the\nlocal consequence relation concerned so we could equally well have\nwritten, \u201c\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2194 \u2610 \u03c6\u201d. Even more\nexotic logical frameworks for modal logic \u2013 taking us further still from the idea of an argument with premisses and\nconclusion(s), that is \u2013 have been proposed than that just alluded to, several of which are described in Poggiolesi and Restall 2012\nand in the literature cited in their bibliography.)\n\nThis same framework-sensitivity issue can be illustrated by\nconsidering substructural logics in multiset-based frameworks.\nClassical Linear Logic has two versions of the propositional constants\n(or 0-ary connectives) \u22a5 and \u22a4, called (in the relevance\ntradition\u2014see Avron 1988\u2014rather than in the notation of\nthe seminal paper Girard 1987) F and f in the\nformer case and T and t in the latter, with the\nfollowing Mset-Mset\nrules, the Greek letters now standing for finite multisets of formulas\n(and commas for multiset union):\n\n\n\n (F Left)\n\n \u0393, F\n\u227b \u0394\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(T\nRight) \n \u0393 \u227b\nT, \u0394  \n\n (t Left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, t \u227b\n\u0394  \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(t\nRight) \n \u227b t\n \n\n (f Left)\n\n f \u227b\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f\nRight) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b f,\n\u0394  \n  \n\n\n\nIf we were doing classical logic with multisets, we would need the\nstructural rules (Id), (Weakening) and (Cut) from Section\n 2,\n set-variables now reinterpreted as multiset variables, and the\nfurther rule of Contraction to allow double occurrences of formulas on\nthe left or right of the \u227b to be replaced by single occurrences.\nFor linear logic we retain only (Id) and (Cut), disallowing weakenings\nand contractions, which has the effect that there are now also two\nversions of conjunction and of disjunction, multiplicative and\nadditive\u2014into which distinction we cannot go further here,\nexcept to say that for binary connectives it lines up with the\nintensional/extensional distinction in the relevance\n tradition.[26]\n A sequent calculus presentation of the favoured logic from this\ntradition, R, can be obtained from that for Classical Linear\nLogic (without two of its characteristic 1-ary connectives, called\nexponentials, which are there to mark formulas for which weakening and\ncontraction are permitted) by allowing contraction (while still\nbanning\n weakening).[27]\n We return to R in Example 6 of Section\n 4;\n it is for the sake of that return that the rules governing t\nand T have been given here alongside those for f and\nF, the latter pair being of current interest. Notice that\neven though there is only one rule for F, namely a left\ninsertion rule (with no premiss sequents), this rule suffices to\ncharacterize F uniquely, since in the combined language with\nF\u2032 governed by a like rule we can prove\u2014just by\nappealing to the appropriate instance of the rule F \u227b\nF\u2032 and F\u2032 \u227b F. The weaker\nsystem of Intuitionistic Linear Logic is cast in the framework Mset-Fmla0\ndisallowing the appearance of more than one formula on the right, and\nthis application of the left rule for F is available there,\nas also in Mset-Fmla,\nrequiring exactly one formula on the right (since we have exactly one\nformula\u2014F or F\u2032\u2014there in the\npresent case). When we turn to f, again we find that the\nrules uniquely characterize this connective, since (f Left)\nprovides the premiss for an application of (f\u2032 Right)\nwith \u0393 consisting of (one occurrence of) f and \u0394\nempty, yielding f \u227b f\u2032, with the\nconverse proved similarly. (Note that while F \u227b\nf is a special case of the (left) rule for F, there\nis no proof of the converse sequent. One cannot begin with f\n\u227b and then weaken in an F on the right, since we do not\nhave\n Weakening.[28])\n Again, these derivations go through in Mset-Fmla0,\nbut\nthis time we note that they do not go through in Mset-Fmla,\nsince the left\ninsertion rule has no applications in that framework. When attention\nis restricted to Mset-Fmla,\nthere is no set of pure rules available which\nuniquely characterize f. The Mset-Mset\n(or Mset-Fmla0)\nsequent calculus rules for \u00ac, which can be taken to be those given\nin Section\n 2\n with the set-variables taken as multiset-variables (suitably\nrestricted for Mset-Fmla0),\nuniquely characterize \u00ac, but\nhave no direct application in Mset-Fmla\nor any other framework with a fixed multiset\ncardinality on the right (or the left, for that matter). We can say in\nthis framework that the rules governing \u00ac uniquely characterize\nthis connective in terms of \u2192 and f\u2014on\nthe basis of which it would indeed be explicitly definable (\u00ac\n\u03c6 as \u03c6 \u2192 f), but since here f is not\nuniquely characterized (even though \u2192 is), this still leaves\n\u00ac without its (perhaps) expected uniqueness, as is even more\nevident in Fmla. These considerations continue\nto apply in the presence of contraction (and \u2227/\u2228) distribution,\naccounting for the complaint sometimes made that relevant logic does\nnot operate with a uniquely characterized negation. The point here has\nnot been either to press or to reply to such complaints, but to note\ntheir framework sensitivity: they do not arise for Mset-Mset\nor Mset-Fmla0.\n\nThe existence and uniqueness questions for connectives turn out in the\ncase of sequent calculus rules to be intimately connected with the\nstructural rules (Id) and (Cut). Let us call the left and right\ninsertion rules governing an n-ary connective #\u2014or\nderivatively, the connective thereby\ngoverned\u2014Id-inductive if the provability of\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) \u227b\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) follows from\nthe provability of each \u03c6i \u227b\n\u03c6i (i = 1,\u2026,n) by\nmeans of those rules (without assistance from other structural rules).\nThus means that no provable sequents are lost if the rule (Id) itself\nis restricted to having applications \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 for \u03c6 a\npropositional variable. And let us say that the rules in question are\nCut-inductive if an application of the rule (Cut) with the\nformula #(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) as\ncut-formula (i.e., as the \u03c6 of our representation of the rule\n(Cut) in Section\n 2\n or the analogous rule in Set-Set\nor the multiset based frameworks) can be\ndispensed with if the premiss sequents for the application of the rule\nhave been derived by (# Left) and (# Right) and (Cut) is allowed with\nthe components \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\nas cut-formulas (but again, not allowing the use of other structural\nrules).\n\nAll the connectives of the standard sequent calculi, including the\ncases of classical and intuitionistic linear logic, are inserted by\nrules which are both Id-inductive and Cut-inductive, as we illustrate\nhere with the rules for \u2192. For definiteness, think of these as\nthe Left and Right rules of classical linear logic. To show\nId-inductivity, we must show that \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 is provable using the \u2192 rules,\ngiven (\u2018the inductive hypothesis\u2019) that \u03c6\n\u227b \u03c6 and \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c8 are. (We write \u03c6 and \u03c8 rather than\n\u03c61 and \u03c62.) From the last two sequents,\n(\u2192 Left) delivers: \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8. From\nthis an application of (\u2192 Right) gives the desired conclusion:\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8.\n\nFor Cut-inductivity suppose (1) \u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394, \u0394\u2032 has arisen by (\u2192 Left) from\n(1a) \u0393 \u227b \u03c6, \u0394 and (2a) \u0393\u2032, \u03c8\n\u227b \u0394\u2032, while (2) \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8, \u0394\u2032\u2032 has arisen by (\u2192 Right) from\n(2a) \u0393\u2032\u2032, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8,\n\u0394\u2032\u2032. We need to show that a cut on (1) and (2) with\ncut-formula \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 can be avoided on the hypothesis that\nwe can help ourselves to cuts with cut-formulas \u03c6, \u03c8. From\n(1a) and (2a), cutting on \u03c6, we get (3) \u0393,\n\u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u03c8, \u0394\u2032\u2032. Then\ncutting on \u03c8, (2b) and (3) deliver the desired conclusion:\n\u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u227b \u0394,\n\u0394\u2032, \u0394\u2032\u2032, without the need to use \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8 as a cut-formula with (1) and (2) as premisses.\n\nCut-inductivity is one aspect of a procedure which has traditionally\nbeen a professional obsession of proof-theorists: the provision of\n\u2018Cut Elimination\u2019 theorems to the effect that this or that\nsequent calculus with the rule (Cut) can have this rule removed\nwithout the loss of any provable sequents. Obviously more is needed to\nshow this than the Cut-inductivity of the (pairs of) rules, since\nthere are also, inter alia, potential interactions with the\nother structural (and operational) rules to be taken care of. Such\nresults are of interest because much follows from the subformula\nproperty\u2014any sequent provable has a proof in which the only\nformulas to appear are subformulas of those in the sequent\nconcerned\u2014which itself follows from the result since all the\nremaining rules insert material rather than remove it in the course of\nthe\n proof.[29]\n But from the perspective of the philosophy of logic, Cut-inductivity\nand its somewhat less well-publicized companion, Id-inductivity,\nshould be considered on a par, as the following somewhat\nimpressionistic semantical remark (Girard, Taylor and Lafont 1989,\np. 31) of Girard suggests, apropos of (Cut), in which C\nrepresents the cut formula (and (Id) with C on the left and\nright of the \u201c\u227b\u201d):\n\nThe identity axiom says that C (on the left) is stronger than\nC (on the right); this rule [ = (Cut)] states the converse\ntruth, i.e. C (on the right) is stronger than C (on\nthe left).\n\n\nThe point of isolating Id- and Cut-inductivity here, however, has less\nto do with matters of truth (on which, and for further references to\nGirard on which, see further H\u00f6sli and J\u00e4ger 1994) than\nwith uniqueness and existence\u2014not that the semantical issues are\nunconnected with this, of course. The former link is perhaps already\nclear. At the last step of establishing Id-inductivity for \u2192,\nabove, we passed from \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8, \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8,\nobtained by (\u2192 Left), to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c8, by (\u2192 Left): but this is just what the uniqueness proof in\nthe reduplicated sequent calculus would do, except that the final step\nwould be an application of (\u2192\u2032 Right) and would establish\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192\u2032 \u03c8, with the\nconverse proved by interchanging the rules used for \u2192 and\n\u2192\u2032.\n\nTo see the connection between existence\u2014or more specifically,\nthe conservative extension side of the existence\nquestion\u2014convert the natural deduction rules for Tonk\ngiven earlier into sequent calculus rules (here\nfor Set-Fmla):\n\n\n\n (Tonk Left) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n  \n\n\n\n (Tonk Right) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\nBy applying the right insertion rule with premiss sequent (courtesy of\n(Id)) \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 and the left rule with premiss \u03c8 \u227b\n\u03c8 we arrive at the point at which our natural deduction derivation\nstarted to go bad: we have:\n\n\n\n \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \n and \n \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \u227b \u03c8 \n\n\n\n\nand an appeal to (Cut) here, with \u03c6 Tonk\n\u03c8 as cut-formula, amounts to bringing home the bad\n news.[30]\n But of course this example simply makes vivid the fact that the Tonk\nrules in play are not Cut-inductive and there\nis no Cut-free proof of the desired sequent (at least in general: take\n\u03c6 = p, \u03c8 = q). This is hardly surprising\nsince the subformula property which Cut Elimination secures itself\nguarantees that the rules for one connective conservatively extend the\nsubsystem comprising the rules for the remaining connectives. In the\npresent case, the point of the example was that there was no proof of,\nfor example, p \u227b q which did not\ndetour\u2014in violation of the subformula property\u2014via\nformulas involving Tonk.\n\nWe can look at what is roughly speaking a mirror-image of the Tonk\nexample to reinforce the contrast between\nCut-inductivity and Id-inductivity and their respective links with\nexistence and uniqueness, and then sort out the \u201croughly\nspeaking\u201d part of this description, which will show them as\nproviding, rather, special\u2014one might say canonical\u2014cases\nof the satisfaction of the existence ( = conservative extension) and\nuniqueness conditions. We conduct the discussion in Set-Set\nrather than Set-Fmla\nto avoid a mass of\ncomplications. The above Tonk rules combine a\nleft insertion rule familiar from the sequent calculus treatment of\n\u2227 and a right insertion rule familiar from that of \u2228; their\nreformulation for the change of framework just announced requires an\nidle \u0394 parameter on the right of the sequents in the premisses\nand conclusions of the rules as schematically presented above\n(replacing the \u03c7 in the one case, accompanying the displayed\nsuccedent formulas in the other). For our mirror image\n example,[31]\n consider a binary connective Knot with rules\ncombining instead the left insertion rule for \u2228 with the right\ninsertion rule for \u2227:\n\n\n\n (Knot Left) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393,\u03c8\n\u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n  \n\n\n\n (Knot Right) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6, \u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393\n\u227b \u03c8, \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8, \u0394  \n  \n\n\n\nThese rules are Cut-inductive, as the interested reader may confirm,\nbut not Id-inductive, since they do not uniquely characterize Knot.\nTo see this, note that both are derivable\nrules for \u2227 and also for \u2228, and of course we cannot prove \u03c6\n\u2228 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 in general. By contrast, neither\n\u2227 nor \u2228 satisfies both of the left and right rules for\nTonk. The upshot of the Knot\nrules is best visualised in terms of the\nzero-premiss rules (sequent-schemata) with which they are\ninterderivable given the structural rules: \u03c6,\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 Knot \u03c8 (the\nright rule) and \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6, \u03c8 (the left rule). An incidental\npoint: since these are the sequent formulations of conditions induced\nby the determinants \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9 and\n\u27e8F, F, F\u27e9 one might think of them\ntogether as expressing idempotence and therefore as being\ninterchangeable with the simpler pair \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c6 and \u03c6 Knot\n\u03c6 \u227b \u03c6. But while the latter two can be derived from the\nearlier pair (just take \u03c8 as \u03c6), the converse derivation is\nnot possible without further principles\u2014conspicuously, a sequent\nversion of the extensionality conditions on generalized consequence\nrelations mentioned in Section\n 2.\n We could call binary # for which \u03c6, \u03c8 \u22a9\u03c6 # \u03c8\nand conversely, strongly idempotent according to the\ngeneralized consequence relation \u22a9. Then \u2227 and \u2228 are not\nthe only Boolean candidates for a connective behaving as the Knot\nrules dictate\u2014strongly idempotent\naccording to the generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9CL determined by the class of Boolean\nvaluations: we also have the binary projection to the first coordinate\n(\u03c6 # \u03c8 equivalent to \u03c6), to the second coordinate (\u03c6 #\n\u03c8 equivalent to \u03c8), and venturing further afield, the Set-Fmla\nhybrids of any two\nof these connectives. Of these perhaps the most interesting is the\nhybrid of the two projection connectives, since this\u2014let us\nwrite is as \u201c\u2022\u201d\u2014can be used to define all other\nhybrids explicitly from the connectives to be hybridized; for example\nif we want the common properties (as explained in Section\n 2)\n of \u2192 and \u2228, we have them in the following compound of \u03c6\nand \u03c8: (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2022 (\u03c6 \u2228\n \u03c8).[32]\n\nIf the treatment of Knot were genuinely the\nmirror image of that of Tonk, we would be able\nto say that just as the Knot rules are\nCut-inductive but not Id-inductive, so the Tonk\nrules are Id-inductive but not Cut-inductive.\n(The twofold demand of Cut- and Id-inductivity is a promising\ncandidate for the notion of harmony as it applies to the\nrelation between right and left insertion rules in a sequent\n calculus.[33])\n And while the failure of Cut-inductivity was indeed noted, nothing\nwas said on the subject of Id-inductivity for these rules. Spoiling\nthe intended duality, the situation is that the Tonk\nrules fail on this score too\u2014though this\ncan be remedied by a simple variation. First, we should note that\nPrior\u2019s point could equally well have been made by combining the\n\u2228 introduction rule from the second (rather than the to\nfirst) disjunct with the \u2227 elimination rule to the first\n(rather than to the second) conjunct. Call the connective with these\nrules Tonk*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tonk* Left \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393, \u03c6 Tonk*\n\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n  \n \n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tonk*\nRight \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8, \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk*\n\u03c8, \u0394  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis suffers from the same defects in respect of the analogy with\nKnot, so, finally, let Tonk+\nbe governed by the rules for Tonk\nand also the rules for Tonk*.\nIt is Tonk+\nthat has Knot\nas its mirror image, since just as we Knot\nhas the full force of the (\u2227 Right) and\n(\u2228 Left) rules, Tonk+ enjoys the\nfull force of the (\u2227 Left) and (\u2228 Right) rules. (So here we\narrive at the reason that Knot was originally\ndescribed as only roughly speaking a mirror image of Tonk.)\nAnd this time the rules are indeed\nId-inductive without being Cut-inductive. Indeed, Id-inductivity is\nsecured by two independent routes: by the interaction of the Tonk\nLeft rule for Tonk+\nwith the Tonk*\nRight rule to Tonk+,\nand then again by the interaction\nof Tonk+\u2018s Tonk*\nLeft rule with its Tonk\nRight rule. (To give the former in more detail,\nby way of example, the Tonk Left rule for\nTonk+ gives \u03c6 Tonk+\n\u03c8 \u227b\u03c8 from\n(Id)-for-\u03c8, from which applying the Tonk*\nRight rule for Tonk+ we obtain\n\u03c6 Tonk+ \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6\nTonk+ \u03c8.)\n\nLet us sum up the lessons for the relations between existence and\nCut-inductivity and between uniqueness and Id-inductivity that can be\nextracted from the foregoing discussion. Sequent calculus rules which\nare Id-inductive uniquely characterize the connective they govern, but\nnot necessarily conversely: the Tonk rules are\nnot Id-inductive, but they do uniquely characterize Tonk,\nsince they are already so strong that any\nsequent with at least one formula on the left and at least one on the\nright can be proved with their aid, and hence, in the reduplicated\nsystem with Tonk\u2032, we can certainly\nprove \u03c6 Tonk \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 Tonk\u2032\n\u03c8 and the converse\nsequent\u2014without even using the Tonk\u2032\nrules! (This is the kind of thing we\nhave in mind in calling this a non-canonical form of uniqueness.) On\nthe \u2018existence\u2019 side: it is not clear to the author\nwhether any Cut-inductive rules governing a connective guarantee that\nthey are conservative over the (system consisting of the) rules\ngoverning other connective\u2014since Cut Elimination may fail for\nother reasons; nor do the examples just considered settle the\nconverse, as we see from the following tabular summary of our\nfindings, in which (a \u201cYes\u201d by) \u201cunique\u201d means\nthe rules uniquely characterize the connective, and\n\u201cconservative\u201d means that we have a conservative extension\nof any system of sequent-calculus rules not involving the given\nconnective; Tonk* is not listed separately\nsince it patterns the same way as Tonk:\n\n\n\nId-inductive\nUnique\nCut-inductive\nConservative \n\nTonk\nNo\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nTonk+\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nKnot\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes \n\n\nThat is enough on the subject of Tonk and\nvariations. We will make one point about unique characterization and\nthen give some examples of non-conservative extension which will\ninvolve introducing the important concepts of special and\nuniversally representative connectives. Some further\n\u2018existence\u2019 examples are deferred to the following\nsection.\n\nThe above discussion has included such phrases as \u201cthe hybrid of\n\u2227 and \u2228\u201d; the totality of principles governing such a\nconnective being those common to \u2227 and \u2228, we obviously do not\nhave a connective uniquely characterized by those principles\u2014in\nwhich case is it legitimate to speak of the hybrid\u2026? I\ntake this way of speaking to be as harmless as speaking of \u201cthe\n\u2610 operator of S5\u201d, where again the logical\nprinciples involved are insufficient to characterize the connective\nuniquely\u2014in terms of the Boolean connectives or\notherwise\u2014at least if we are Fmla, Set-Fmla\nor Set-Set,\nand in the latter\ncases, working with the so-called local (generalized)\nconsequence\n relation.[34]\n (See Section\n 5\n for the distinction between the local and the global consequence\nrelations determined by a class of models.) One could say that in the\nmonomodal, unreduplicated case, we have a single connective playing a\ncertain role and we can refer to it in that context as the\nconnective playing the role in question, while conceding, as we learn\nfrom the reduplicated case, that this is a role that can be played\nsimultaneously (i.e. in a single logic) by several non-equivalent\nconnectives. This is the kind of situation \u0141ukasiewicz had in\nmind when, in his (1953), he likened certain pairs of connectives to\n\u201ctwins who cannot be distinguished when met separately, but are\ninstantly recognised as two when seen together\u201d.\n\nWe saw earlier that combining the intuitionistic and classical rules\nin a single proof system did not work well, and another suggestion\nthat comes to mind is that we could perhaps extend intuitionistic\nlogic with a new connective, 1-ary #, say, which does what according\nto the intuitionist, negation (\u00ac) itself cannot do: serve as a\nleft inverse for \u00ac in the sense of rendering equivalent\n#\u00ac\u03c6 and \u03c6 for all\n \u03c6.[35]\n This again represents an offer the intuitionist cannot afford to\naccept, assuming that any (the rules for any) proposed new connectives\nshould conserve synonymy, as suggested above. (The even stronger\ndemand that the consequence relation associated with the extended\nproof systems should be congruential does not seem unreasonable.) The\nreason is that \u00acp and \u00ac\u00ac\u00acp are\nintuitionistically equivalent (and thus synonymous according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L) so the conservation of synonymy\nrequires that #\u00acp and #\u00ac\u00ac\u00acp should\nbe equivalent\u2014since we have this \u2018Law of Triple\nNegation\u2019 equivalence in intuitionistic logic\u2014from which\nthe left inverse condition above delivers, taking \u03c6 as\n\u00acp in the former case and as \u00ac\u00ac\u00acp in\nthe latter, the equivalence of p with\n\u00ac\u00acp\u2014a straightforwardly non-conservative\nextension, then. (A similar argument shows that adding binary # with\n\u03c6 # (\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) equivalent to \u03c8\u2014a possibility\nsuggesting itself since, by contrast with the classical case, \u2194\nitself cannot serve as # here\u2014is also non-conservative.) Nor,\nincidentally, could the intuitionist acknowledge the existence of a\nright inverse for negation, a # with arbitrary \u03c6\nequivalent to \u00ac # \u03c6, as this makes every formula equivalent to\na negated formula and hence to its own double negation. This argument,\nwhich is well known (see, e.g., Koslow (1992), p. 97), does not even\nrequire the \u2018conservation of synonymies\u2019 constraint.\n\nThese last non-existence proofs force our attention on the fact that\nnegated formulas are \u2018special\u2019 in intuitionistic logic in\nthat each such formula is equivalent to its own double negation while\nthis is not so for arbitrary formulas. Let us back up and give a clear\nexplanation of the notion of specialness as well as a contrasting\nnotion, in slightly more general terms; for definiteness only, we\ntailor the account to Set-Fmla.\nWe also begin with the contrasting notion. Say\nthat an n-ary relation R among the formulas of a\nlanguage is universally representative according to a\nconsequence relation on that language if for any formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n of the language,\nthere are formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n, respectively\nsynonymous with \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\naccording to \u22a2, with\nR(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n). (If\nn = 1, we speak instead of a universally representative\nclass of formulas\u2014a class of formulas such that every\nformula is synonymous with some formula in the class; likewise in the\ncase of the notion special, defined below.) If \u22a2 is\ncongruential then we can replace \u201csynonymous\u201d in this\ndefinition with \u201cequivalent\u201d (i.e. such that\n\u03c6i \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c8i,\nfor i = 1,\u2026,n). Say that R is\nspecial according to \u22a2 if there is some Set-Fmla\nsequent \u03c3(p1,\u2026,\npn) constructed using not\nnecessarily just the variables exhibited, for which for any formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n with\nR(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n), we\nhave \u03c3(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\n\u2208 \u22a2, while we do not have, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n, \u03c3(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u2208 \u22a2. For substitution-invariant \u22a2, this last\ncondition can be simplified to:\n\u03c3(p1,\u2026,\npn) \u2209\n \u22a2.[36]\n A consequence of these definitions is that no relation is both\nuniversally representative and special according to any given \u22a2.\nA simple example of a special relation\u2014according to more or less\nany \u2018naturally occurring\u2019 consequence relation with \u2228\nin its language is relation R obtaining between \u03c6 and\n\u03c8 just in case \u03c8 is a disjunction of which \u03c6 is a\ndisjunct. Here take \u03c3(p, q) as p\n\u227b q which is (e.g., in intuitionistic logic, though\nclassical logic or any of many others would do as well)\nunprovable\u2014i.e., not p\n\u22a2I\u2009L q\u2014while \u03c6\n\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c8 for all \u03c6, \u03c8 for\nwhich R(\u03c6, \u03c8). A more interesting example is the\nrelation of being (intuitionistically) head-linked, i.e.,\nthat relation R such that for all \u03c6, \u03c8,\nR(\u03c6, \u03c8) if and only if:\n\nfor some formulas \u03c7, \u03c60, \u03c80, we have\n\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c60\n\u2192 \u03c7 and \u03c8\n\u22a3\u22a2I\u2009L \u03c80 \u2192\n\u03c7.\n\n\nThe analogous relation for classical logic would be universally\nrepresentative (and thus not special), at least in any fragment which,\nas well as having \u2192, has either \u22a5 or \u2227, since any \u03c6\nand \u03c8 are here respectively equivalent to (\u03c6 \u2192 \u22a5)\n\u2192 \u22a5 and (\u03c8 \u2192 \u22a5) \u2192 \u22a5, where they are\nlinked explicitly by having a common \u03c7 at the head of the main\nimplication. (Alternatively with \u2227, replace \u22a5 here by \u03c6\n\u2227 \u03c8.) But in the intuitionistic case the relation of being\nhead-linked is special since, for example, with Peirce\u2019s law\n\u03c3(p,q) = (p \u2192 q) \u2192\np \u227b p, we have \u03c3(p, q)\nintuitionistically unprovable but we have \u03c3(\u03c6,\u03c8) \u2208\n\u22a2I\u2009L for any head-linked \n\u03c6, \u03c8.\n\nConcentrating now on 1-ary relations between\u2014i.e., classes\nof\u2014formulas, we transfer the above terminology to connectives by\nsaying that a connective is universally representative or\nspecial according to a consequence relation if the class of\nformulas with the given connective as main connective is itself a\nuniversally representative class or a special class of formulas,\nrespectively, according to the consequence relation in question. While\nevery non-constant\n connective[37]\n is universally representative according to\n\u22a2CL our discussion of inverses for\nintuitionistic \u00ac shows that \u00ac is special according to \u22a2,\nsince we can take \u03c3(p) as \u00ac\u00acp \u227b\np and every substitution instance of this IL-unprovable\nsequent in which p is replaced by a negated formula is\nIL-provable. Negation is therefore not universally representative in\nintuitionistic logic. (This means that we could usefully speak, from\nthe perspective of \u22a2I\u2009L, of negative\npropositions, thinking of the equivalence class, with respect\nto the relation of synonymy, of a formula as the proposition thereby\nexpressed, and meaning by this the equivalence classes of negated\nformulas. Classically, the corresponding notion is not useful since\nall propositions would count as negative, just as for both\n\u22a2CL and \u22a2I\u2009L,\nthere are no specifically conjunctive or disjunctive\npropositions.)\n\nAlthough the properties of being special and being universally\nrepresentative according to a given logic are mutually exclusive, they\nare not jointly exhaustive. For example, \u22a5 is neither universally\nrepresentative nor special in minimal logic (according to the\nconsequence relation associated with the Johansson\u2019s\nMinimalkalk\u00fcl, that is). Nor does the connective \u2610\nhave either of these properties in the modal logic KD\n(sometimes just called D), though this example is far from\nselected at random: in the sublogic K, \u2610 is special (since\n\u2610\u22a5 \u2192 \u03c6 is provable for all \u2610-formulas \u03c6,\nthough not for arbitrary \u03c6), and in the extension KD4 it is\nspecial again (since \u03c6 \u2192 \u2610\u03c6 is provable for all\n\u2610-formulas \u03c6, though not for all formulas).\n4. Selected Existence Questions\n4.1 Conditions not Corresponding to Rules (Example 1)\n\nFor conditions other than those corresponding to (closure under\ncertain) rules we can also ask whether a connective satisfying the\ncondition in question can safely\u2014i.e. conservatively\u2014be\npostulated to exist. One such condition is the following, here\nexpressed as a condition on a consequence relation \u22a2 with a\nbinary connective # in its language, all variables understood as\nuniversally quantified:\n\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 # \u03c8 if and only if \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 or\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c8.\n\n\nIt is because of the \u201cor\u201d on the right that this\ncondition\u2014more precisely, its \u2018only if\u2019\nhalf\u2014does not correspond to a sequent-to-sequent rule. Still we\ncan ask whether some Set-Fmla\nproof system including the rule (\u2228E) (or the\nsequent calculus rule (\u2228 Left)), e.g. for classical logic, has a\nconservative extension to a proof system for a language with the\nadditional connective #, whose associated consequence relation\nsatisfies the above condition for this\n #.[38]\n To see that the answer to this question is negative, note that the\nbinary relation R\u22a2 defined in terms of the\n#-supporting extension \u22a2:\nR\u22a2(\u03c6,\u03c8) iff \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8,\ngives rise to a binary relational connection (L, L,\nR\u22a2) which provides conjunctive\n(yes\u2014conjunctive) combinations on the left, since\n\u22a2 is \u2228-classical, \u03c6 \u22c5L \u03c8\nhere being \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, while the inset condition above (take\n\u0393 = {\u03c7}) secures disjunctive objects on the right, with\n\u03c6 +R \u03c8 being \u03c6 # \u03c8.\n(\u201cL\u201d and \u201cR\u201d subscripts from\nSection\n 1\n restored here to prevent confusion, since the source and target\ncoincide.) Thus the crossover condition from Section\n 1\n is satisfied, which says that if \u03c61 \u22a2\n\u03c81 and \u03c62 \u22a2 \u03c82 then\neither \u03c61 \u22a2 \u03c82 or\n\u03c62 \u22a2 \u03c81. Taking \u03c61\n= \u03c81 = \u03c7 and \u03c62 = \u03c82\n= \u03c7\u2032, we have the antecedent of this conditional (by (Id)),\nso we conclude that for all formulas \u03c7, \u03c7\u2032, either \u03c7\n\u22a2 \u03c7\u2032 or \u03c7\u2032 \u22a2 \u03c7, which includes\n#-free formulas of the original language (e.g., \u03c7 = p,\n\u03c7\u2032 = q) for which neither is a consequence of the\nother by the original consequence relation, showing any proposed\nextension along the above lines to be non-conservative.\n4.2 Pollard-Style Nonconservativity (Example 2)\n\nThis is really a whole range of examples. As we required (\u2228E) for\nExample 1, here we require (\u2192I). Let us call a consequence\nrelation \u22a2 \u2192-introductive if \u0393, \u03c6\n\u22a2 \u03c8 always implies \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192\n \u03c8.[39]\n Now suppose \u22a2 \u2287 \u22a2I\u2009L and\n\u22a2 is \u2192-introductive, and either (i) for some n-ary\nconnective #, \u22a2 satisfies the conditions induced (on consequence\nrelations) by the determinant \u27e8F,\u2026, F,T\u27e9 (n\noccurrences of \u201cF\u201d) for #, as well as some determinant\nwith F as its final entry, or (ii) \u22a2 satisfies the conditions\ninduced by the determinant \u27e8T,\u2026,T, F\u27e9 (n\noccurrences of \u201cT\u201d) as well as some determinant with T as\nfinal entry (for n-ary #). Then it follows that \u22a2\n\u2287 \u22a2CL.\n\nThe implication from (i) to the conclusion that \u22a2 \u2287\n\u22a2CL has been stressed in several publications\nby S. Pollard (Pollard 2002, Pollard and Martin 1996); there is a\nsimilar proof for the implication from (ii). Neither proof is given\nhere\u2014only an illustration (of case (ii)). The truth-function\nknown as exclusive disjunction (or xor), which differs from\nthat associated on Boolean valuations with \u2228 (\u201cinclusive\ndisjunction\u201d) by having \u27e8T, T, F\u27e9 instead of the\ndeterminant \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9, will serve as an example, since as\nwell as the determinant just mentioned, which has T\u2019s except for\nthe final F, we have a T-final determinant (e.g.) \u27e8T, F, T\u27e9.\nThe induced conditions on generalized consequence relations for these\ntwo determinants are respectively:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a9 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u03c6 \u22a9 \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8.  \n\n\n\nFor the following, we will take it that, as well as \u2192, the\nconnectives \u2228, \u00ac, \u22a4 and \u22a5 are available, though in\nfact the result just given requires is correct for any fragment with\n\u2192 (with \u22a2CL understood as the restriction\nof the classical consequence relation to the fragment in question).\nThen we can write the induced conditions on our consequence relation\n\u22a2 as, respectively, rather than using a new schematic letter on\nthe right for the first, and converting the second into conditional\nform:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u22a5 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2228 (\u03c6 # \u03c8).  \n\n\n\nNow making use of the hypothesis that \u22a2 is\n\u2192-introductive\u2014which does not follow from the fact\nthat \u22a2I\u2009L is \u2192-introductive and\n\u22a2 \u2287 \u22a2I\u2009L\u2014the first\ncondition now allows for successive rewriting, first as\n\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u22a5),\n\n\nand then as\n\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8.\n\n\nThe fact that \u22a2 is an \u2192-introductive extension of\n\u22a2I\u2009L suffices for \u22a2 to be\n\u2228-classical, and in particular for it to be\n\u2018\u2228-eliminative\u2019 in the sense that whenever \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c71 \u2228 \u03c72 and also\n\u0393\u2032, \u03c71 \u22a2 \u03b8 and\n\u0393\u2032\u2032, \u03c72 \u22a2 \u03b8, we have\n\u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u22a2 \u03b8. Thus\nfrom the fact that \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2228 (\u03c6 # \u03c8), inset on\nthe right above, and that \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192\n\u00ac\u03c8, we may conclude that \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8\n\u2228 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8). Not only does this\nfail\u2014e.g., with the schematic letters replaced by distinct\npropositional variables\u2014for \u22a2I\u2009L,\nmaking the extension non-conservative, it takes us all the way to\n\u22a2CL, as claimed in the general formulation\n((i) and (ii)) of the result. To see this most easily in the present\ncase, take \u03c6 as \u22a4.\n\nDoes any of this mean that there is a problem in finding an\nintuitionistic analogue of exclusive disjunction? Not at all. There\nare many derived binary connectives all of which form compounds\nequivalent in classical logic to the exclusive disjunction of \u03c6\nwith \u03c8 and which are in the interesting cases not equivalent to\neach other intuitionistically\u2014for example, \u03c6 \u2194\n\u00ac\u03c8 and \u00ac(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) and (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2227\n\u00ac(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8). As it happens, the third of these (which is\nIL-equivalent to (\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2228 (\u00ac\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8)) has an especially close relationship with\nthe truth-function of exclusive disjunction, like that between\nintuitionistic \u00ac and the negation truth-function, which can be\nexplained in terms of the Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic\n(not explained in this entry) by saying that the compound in question\nis true at a point just in case at every accessible point it is true\nwhen evaluated by using the corresponding boolean function and the\ntruth-values of the components at that\n point.[40]\n Note that the negation truth-function itself has its\ndeterminant-induced conditions rules dangerous to the health of\nintuitionistic logic under both (i) and (ii) of the result at the\nstart of this example: no single connective can conservatively form\nfrom a formula a contrary of that formula (as \u27e8T,\nF\u27e9 demands) and also a subcontrary of\nthat formula (as \u27e8F, T\u27e9 demands). As it is often put,\nstandard intuitionistic negation (\u00ac) forms the deductively weakest\ncontrary of a formula, while dual intuitionistic negation (mentioned\nonly in passing in this entry) forms its deductively strongest\n subcontrary.[41]\n4.3 Negation by Iteration (Example 3)\n\nCould there be a 1-ary connective # two successive applications of\nwhich amounted to a single application of (say) classical\n negation?[42]\n If we work in Set-Set\nan austere version of this question amounts to asking about the fate\nof # subjected, alongside the standard structural rules, to the\ncondition that for all \u03c6:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, ##\u03c6 \u227b \n \u00a0and\u00a0 \n \u227b \u03c6, ##\u03c6  \n\n\n\nshould both be provable, to which it is natural to add immediately\nthat # should be congruential according to the generalized consequence\nrelation associated with this proof system. Without the latter\naddition, we could just think of \u201c##\u201d as an\nidiosyncratically long-winded way of writing \u201c\u00ac\u201d. With\nit, we are insisting that a single occurrence of \u201c#\u201d is\ngenuinely responsive to the content of what it applies to. It is not\nhard to see that there is no (two-valued) truth-functional\ninterpretation available for #, not just in the weak sense that it\nmight be said that (for example) \u2610 in S4 does not admit\nof such an interpretation\u2014that this logic is determined by (\n= both sound and complete with respect to) no\nclass of valuations over which \u2610 is truth-functional\u2014but\nin the stronger sense that the envisaged logic of # is not even\nsound with respect to such a class of valuations, at least if\nthat class is non-constant in the sense defined at the end of\nnote 20.[43]\n In the paper cited, this congruential logic of what is there and in\nan earlier paper there referred to as demi-negation is discussed and\nequipped with a Kripke-style semantics (essentially re-working an\nearlier 4-valued matrix semantics) the upshot of which is that\nclassical propositional logic or any fragment thereof is\nconservatively extended by the two zero-premiss rules inset\nabove\u2014or alternatively, assuming \u00ac is in the fragment, by\nthe equivalence of \u00ac\u03c6 and ##\u03c6\u2014and a congruentiality\nrule for #. Nevertheless it is hard to imagine, \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d, speaking a language with a connective for which this\nprovided a suitable formal treatment. The description suggested at p.\n257 of Dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Greechie (2004), a study in quantum\nlogic, of such a connective as expressing a kind of tentative\nnegation, seems wrong, since iterating tentative negation would not\nproduce (untentative) negation: If you tentatively negate the\ntentative negation of \u03c6 you would appear to be headed (however\ntentatively) back in the direction of \u03c6 rather than towards \u00ac\n\u03c6. On the same page of Dalla Chiara et al. (2004),\nDeutsch et al. (2000) are approvingly quoted as saying the\nfollowing\u2014in which, since composition is more like\nmultiplication than addition, demi-negation is referred to as the\n\u2018square root\u2019 of negation:\n\nLogicians are now entitled to propose a new logical operation\n\u221anot. Why? Because a faithful physical model for it\nexists in nature.\n\n\nI do not recall logicians having to seek the blessing of physicists\nbefore pursuing this or that line of inquiry, or of the interest,\nsignificance or legitimacy (\u201cnow entitled to propose...\u201d,\nno less) of such inquiries being dependent on empirical and\ntheoretical findings in physics, when what is under investigation is\nmost naturally taken to be an a priori matter: the coherence\nof a connective with given inferential properties. This is not at all\nto deny that the \u2018quantum machines\u2019 described in Deutsch\net al. (2000) (or Chiara, Giuntini, and Greechie 2004,\n257\u2013259) may help us get a feel for the connective in\n question.[44]\n4.4 Logical Subtraction (Example 4)\n\nSuppose one wants to say more about the weather than that it rained on\na particular Saturday. One wants to strengthen one\u2019s commitments\nso that they include not only rain on Saturday but also rain on the\nfollowing Sunday. With \u2227 (assuming some background \u2227-classical\nconsequence relation) there is nothing easier. Abbreviating \u201cIt\nrained on the Saturday in question\u201d to Sat and\n\u201cIt rained on Sunday\u201d to Sun, one can convert\none\u2019s original statement into one making the stronger claim by\npassing from Sat to Sat \u2227 Sun. Now\nsuppose one wanted a similar device but working in the reverse\ndirection. One starts with a claim whose content is given by Sat\n\u2227 Sun and wants to modify this using a connective\nwhich removes commitments in much the way that \u2227 adds them, and\nusing this connective, often called logical subtraction\n(though a case could be made for \u2018logical division\u2019 in\nview of the usual association of conjunction with multiplication), one\nwants to take away the commitment to rain on Sunday, leaving only the\noriginal claim. That is, one would like a connective added to the\nlanguage of one\u2019s favoured consequence relation, in such a way\nthat the added connective was governed by rules making the extension\nconservative, but for which one had the equivalence (writing \u22a2)\nfor the extended consequence relation:\n\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212  Sun\n\u22a3\u22a2 Sat.\n\n\nAn early and plausible suggestion for the treatment of logical\nsubtraction was made in Hudson (1975). According to this suggestion,\nno new connective is required, at least if we already have a\nreasonable implication connective at our disposal, because if we are\nto think of \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8 as giving us\nthe result of taking away the content of \u03c8 from that of \u03c6,\nthen this should be the weakest statement which, together with \u03c8,\nhas \u03c6 as a consequence. But this is just \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6, if\nthe standard natural deduction rules for \u2192 from Section\n 2\n are accepted (as in intuitionistic and classical logic). Yet this\ndoes not give us the inset equivalence above. If we treat\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212 Sun as Sun\n\u2192 (Sat \u2227 Sun), then this is equivalent (in\nthe logics just mentioned and many others) to Sun \u2192 \nSat, whereas we wanted the stronger Sat itself (stronger\naccording to those logics, again).\n\nThe example above used an interpreted language with atomic sentences\nSat and Sun. The inset equivalence presented\ninvolving them would not be reasonable for all sentences. Modulating\nback to the issue of a formal propositional logic involving the\nenvisaged new connective, such an equivalence would not be reasonable\nfor arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 in place of them, since we would expect\nthe new connective to be congruential according to the desired\nconsequence relation, and any unrestricted such equivalence would then\ndeliver from \u03c61 \u2227 \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c62 \u2227 \u03c8\u2014by \u201csubtracting \u03c8 from\nboth sides\u201d (in view of congruentiality)\u2014the conclusion\nthat \u03c61 \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c62, and it easy\nto find counterexamples to such cancellation inferences for even quite\nweak initial logics. Since the counterexamples arise for\n\u03c61, \u03c62, in the language unexpanded by\n\u201c\u2212\u201d, the sense in which a generalized version of the\nearlier equivalence would not be reasonable is that it would not be\nconservative over the initial logic. Here we say no more about how to\nconstrain the equivalence in question, or, more generally, about\nwhether there really is any such logical subtraction connective as\nwe have been\n envisaging.[45]\n4.5 A Multiple Existence Question (Example 5)\n\nA much more straightforward example, this time considering several\nconnectives at once. Suppose we ask whether one can conservatively add\nto intuitionistic logic three binary connectives #1,\n#2, #3, satisfying for all \u03c6, \u03c8:\n\n\n\n \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #1 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8) \n \u00a0and\u00a0 \n \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #2 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8).  \n\n\n\nIn classical logic we can take \u03c6 #1 \u03c8 and \u03c6\n#2 \u03c8 as (equivalent to) \u00ac\u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c8\nrespectively, and \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as \u22a5. There are no\nthree candidates playing the desired role in any conservative\nextension of intuitionistic logic, however, because the inset\nequivalences render arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 head-linked in the sense\nof Section\n 3,\n with \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as the head formula.\n4.6 An Example Related to Algebraizability (Example 6)\n\nThe present example comes from the relevant logic R. The\nsentential constants T and t whose sequent calculus\ntreatment we saw in Section\n 3\n are treated in axiomatic developments of R by means of the\naxiom schemas \u03c6 \u2192 T for the former cases and both\nt and t \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6), though these\nlast two can be replaced by \u03c6 \u2194 (t \u2192 \u03c6).\nHere \u2194 itself can be regarded as an abbreviation either of (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6), or as (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u25cb (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6),\nwhere \u2227 and \u25cb are the additive or \u2018extensional\u2019\n(as the relevance tradition would have it) conjunction and the\nmultiplicative or \u2018intensional\u2019 conjunction (also called\nfusion) respectively. While in linear logic neither\np \u25cb q nor p \u2227 q provably\nimplies the other, in R, thanks to the presence of contraction,\nthe latter implies the\n former.[46]\n A well-known further side effect of contraction is that \u03c6 \u25cb\n\u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 are also equivalent whenever \u03c6 is an\nimplicational formula and \u03c8 is its converse, so the two\nalternative readings of \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 above are equivalent in\nR. Now consider the possible existence of a new nullary\nconnective for R in the \u2018truth constants\u2019 family,\nT, subject to the axiom schema:\n\n\u03c6 \u2194 (T \u2194 \u03c6).\n\n\nThis looks harmless enough, the principles governing t,\nT and T all holding for the\nundifferentiated \u22a4 constant of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic, but here notationally distinguished so as not to prejudice\nquestions of the logical relations between\n them.[47]\n\nBut in R, this harmless appearance is deceptive. For in this\nlogic the connective \u2194 is what we have called special.\nAfter the well-known extension, R-Mingle or RM, of\nR by the Mingle schema \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6\n\u2192\n \u03c6),[48]\n let us call a formula \u03c6 for which this is already provable in\nR a Mingler. Since RM is a proper extension of\nR, not all formulas are Minglers in R. But again thanks\nto contraction, all \u2194-formulas are Minglers, rendering \u2194\nspecial in R. Now we can see that the addition of T,\nsubject to the schema inset above, would\nextend R non-conservatively because now every formula \u03c6\nwould be equivalent to the corresponding \u2194-formula T\n\u2194 \u03c6, so even for T-free\n\u03c6 we should have the Mingle theorem\n\u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6). Thus no devotee of R should\nbe prepared to countenance the existence of T\nbehaving as envisaged (or indeed any pair\n#1, #2 of 1-ary connectives with \u03c6 provably\nequivalent to #1\u03c6 \u2194 #2\u03c6).\n\nThe fact that the biconditional connective is special in R may\nappear to conflict with the fact, established in Blok and Pigozzi\n(1989) that this logic is what the authors call\nalgebraizable. This term is applied to consequence relations\n\u22a2 which are translationally equivalent to the quasi-equational\nconsequence relation \u22a8K of a class of algebras\nof the same similarity type as the language of \u22a2. That is, for\nequations\ne1,\u2026,en, we\nhave\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\u22a8K\nen just in case for any algebra A\n\u2208 K and any assignment of elements of A to the\nvariables in the ei, if all of\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\ncome out true in A on that assignment, so does\nen. The translational equivalence idea\nmeans that there is a translation \u03c4 from formulas of the\n(sentential) language of \u22a2 to equations of the language of\nK, and a translation \u03c4\u2032 back in the other direction,\nwhich are mutually inverse in the sense that \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6)) and e\n\u2ae4\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c4\u2032(e)) for\nall formulas \u03c6 and equations e, and, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n and equations\ne1,\u2026,en,\neither of the following conditions is satisfied (from which it follows\nthat both are):\n\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\u22121 \u22a2\n\u03c6n if and only if\n\u03c4(\u03c61),\u2026,\u03c4(\u03c6n\u22121)\n\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c6n)\n\n\nand\n\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\n\u22a8K en if and only\nif\n\u03c4\u2032(e1),\u2026,\u03c4\u2032(en\u22121)\n\u22a2 \u03c4\u2032(en).\n\n\nThis account of algebraizability has been oversimplified for\nexpository purposes in one respect: Blok and Pigozzi (1989) do not\nrequire the translation of a formula (what we are calling \u03c4)\nshould yield a single equation, but allow a set of equations,\nand similarly in the converse direction, \u03c4\u2032(e) is\nallowed to be a set of formulas. It follows from the present\ndefinition, with the single equation/single formula restriction\nremoved, that the formulas in the latter set function collectively as\nan equivalence-like compound satisfying some further congruence\nconditions, which in the case of \u22a2R can be\ntaken to be \u2194. Accordingly, the fact that\n\u22a2R\u2014explained presently\u2014is\nalgebraizable, entails, in view of the \u201c\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6))\u201d condition, that, loosely speaking,\nevery formula is equivalent to an equivalence. But does this not clash\nwith our finding that \u2194 is special in R?\n\nWell, first, the consequence relation \u22a2R needs\nto be explained. Blok and Pigozzi have in mind the least consequence\nrelation for which \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u22a2\n\u03c8 and \u03c6, \u03c8\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8 and \u22a2\u00a0\u03c6 for all \u03c6 provable in the\nFmla logic R. (This third condition can\nbe restricted to all axioms of any axiomatization of R with\nformula-to-formula rules corresponding to the first and second\nconditions.) Now the loose summary just given to the effect that every\nformula is equivalent to an equivalence makes a misleading double use\nof the equivalence vocabulary for two different things: equivalence as\nmutual consequence (\u201c\u22a3\u22a2\u201d) and equivalence as\nthe biconditional connective. Removing the conflation, it means that\nfor every \u03c6 there exist \u03c8, \u03c7, with \u03c6\n\u22a3\u22a2R\u03c8 \u2194\n \u03c7.[49]\n This is a very different matter from having\n\u22a2R\u03c6 \u2194(\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7). The latter\nwould indeed be equivalent to the provability in the sequent calculus\ndescribed for R in Section\n 3\n of \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7 and the converse sequent. But the\napparently matching \u22a2R-statements mean\nsomething very different, building in the structural features (such as\nweakening) that the substructural sequent calculus was designed to\navoid. Note in particular that \u22a2R is not\n\u2192-introductive, in the sense of Example 2 above.\n4.7 Two-Dimensional Isotopes of Boolean Connectives (Longer Example 7) \n\nCould there exist a connective #\u2032 which, when appearing outside\nof the scope of some specified range of operators \u2013 typically,\nnon-Boolean connectives \u2013 behaves just like a given Boolean\nconnective #, while behaving differently from # when occurring within\nthe scope of one of the operators in the range in question?\nUnderstanding all of this as happening under the aegis of some\nparticular consequence relation, on which more will be said in the\nfollowing paragraph, the situation envisaged would be like this. A\n#\u2032-compound would be equivalent to a #-compound of the same\ncomponents, each compound having the other as a consequence by the\nrelevant consequence relation, without being synonymous with that\ncompound (synonymy as explained in Section\n 1).\n The remainder of this example assumes some familiarity with the basic\nmodal logic of \u201cactually\u201d. The semantics of this logic can\nbe presented, as in the first two pages of Davies and Humberstone\n(1980), using models with a distinguished point (or world), with a\nformula A\u03c6 evaluated as true at any point in the model\njust in case \u03c6 is true at the distinguished point. The\ngenerally valid formulas are then those true every point in\nall such models, and the generally valid sequents are those for which\ntruth is preserved from left to right at each point in all such\nmodels. The real-world valid formulas (sequents) are those\nwhich are true (resp. truth-preserving) at the distinguished point in\nall models.\n\nAlternatively, the semantics can be reformulated so that the models\nfeature no such privileged point and truth (in a model) is relativized\nto a pair of points, one of which plays the \u2018real world\u2019\nrole formerly played by the distinguished element, the other playing\nthe role of the world of at which the formula is being locally\nevaluated, as in notes 4 and 16 of Davies and Humberstone (1980).\nGeneral validity is a matter of truth or its preservation relative to\narbitrary such pairs in all models, and diagonal validity (as\nreal-world validity is often suggestively called in this setting)\nattends instead only to pairs whose first and second coordinates\ncoincide. On either style of presentation, the formulation in terms of\nsequents gives a consequence relation in the obvious way, and for\npresent purposes the following terminology will be convenient.\nFormulas will be said to be diagonally equivalent when each\nis a consequence of the other by the consequence relation capturing\ndiagonal (or \u2018real-world\u2019) validity and to be\nunrestrictedly equivalent when this holds instead for the\ngeneral consequence relation. (We avoid the phrase \u201cgenerally\nequivalent\u201d, since it is hard not to hear this as meaning\n\u201cequivalent, for the most part\u201d; this terminology is\nadapted from the reference to general consequence on p.\u00a015 of\nFusco 2015 as unrestricted consequence.) The current distinction\nbetween diagonal and unrestricted equivalence provides a useful formal\nmodeling of Dummett\u2019s well-known distinction between sameness of\nassertive (or assertoric) content, on the one hand, and sameness of\ningredient sense on the\n other.[50]\n The idea of applying such a contrast to the case of specific pairs of\nconnectives \u2013 as with the #, #\u2032 pairs from the start of\nthe preceding paragraph \u2013 appears, however, to be new with Fusco\n(2015), to which we turn presently. The consequence relation in play\nin the #, #\u2032 discussion above is taken as the diagonal\nconsequence relation (with the associated relation of weak\nequivalence), according to which these connectives are\nnon-congruential, providing for mutual consequence without synonymy,\nrather than the finer-grained general consequence relation (associated\nwith unrestricted equivalence). The latter consequence relation is\ncongruential, but at the cost of not directly reflecting the felt\na priori equivalence of A\u03c6 with \u03c6.\n\nThe aspect of Fusco (2015) of present concern is the treatment of\ndisjunction, with special reference to the problems with which it is\nassociated in deontic logic \u2013 such as Ross\u2019s Paradox, and\nthe representation of Free Choice permission. The issue is discussed\nfurther in Section 3 of Fusco (2019). (For general background,\nincluding these problems, see McNamara 2019; more detail on the\nspecifically disjunction-related issues arising is provided in Aloni\n2016.) Fusco (2015) argues, on grounds we do not go into here (since\nthey involve several parts of an elaborate theory of deontic notions),\nthat these problems of deontically embedded \u201cor\u201d in\nEnglish (and corresponding vocabulary in other natural languages) are\nbest treated rendering it formally by means of \u201c or\n\u201d, with \u03c6 or\n\u03c8 defined as:\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2192 \u03c6) \u2227\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 \u03c8) \u2227\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nThis is a suggested definition, at least for \u03c6, \u03c8, constructed\nusing just Boolean connectives, from a planned sequel to Fusco (2015)\nand (2019), spelling out in the object language a semantic\ncharacterization supplied in the first of those papers. An\nunrestrictedly equivalent definition (or more accurately, definiens)\nwhich some readers may prefer is the following:\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2227 \u03c8) \u2228\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nBy contrast, instances of the following schema, giving the treatment\nof \u201cwhether \u03c6 or \u03c8 \u201d in Lewis (1982) for Boolean\n\u03c6, \u03c8 (though not in general, as explained in the last\nparagraph of note 51 below), would only be diagonally equivalent to the\ncorresponding instances of the above pair:\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228 (A\u03c8 \u2227\n\u03c8).\n\n\nSo as to have concrete formulas to discuss, consider the instances of\nthese three schemata with distinct sentence letters p and\nq taken as \u03c6 and \u03c8, respectively, and we will now use\n(1)\u2013(3) to refer to these concrete instances. The first pair are\nunrestrictedly equivalent and all three are diagonally equivalent,\nwith (3) having (1) and (2) as general consequences though not\n conversely.[51]\n All are diagonally equivalent to the Boolean disjunction p\n\u2228 q, which we may put by saying that all are\ntwo-dimensional isotopes of the one-dimensional, i.e.\nA-free, formula p \u2228 q, or, more\nusefully, that their respective equivalence classes w.r.t. the\nrelation of unrestricted equivalence, stand in this\n\u2018isotope\u2019 relation. Similarly, we can speak of the (in the\nabove presentation, derived) connective or\nas a two-dimensional isotope of the Boolean \u2228,\nthinking of the formula (2) as a context of the variables p,\nq. (On the other hand, what is referred to in note 51  as Groenendijk\u2013Stokhof\u2019s \u201cor\u201d\nis not a two-dimensional isotope of\nBoolean disjunction, p\u00a0or\u00a0q,\nso understood, being diagonally\nequivalent to a Boolean tautology, rather than to\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q.)\n\nWhat is the point of considering such two-dimensional isotopes of\nBoolean disjunction? Fusco\u2019s idea is the following. Arguably,\npeople have thought that the correct treatment of inclusive\n\u201cor\u201d in English is given by (Boolean) \u201c\u2228\u201d,\nonce they have learned to diagnose as pragmatic distraction any\napparent anomalies, because this simple connective with its\ntruth-functional semantics captures the way \u201cor\u201d behaves\nwhen it appears unembedded (or only \u2018Booleanly\u2019 embedded).\nThe presumption has then been that any residual anomalies arising from\nproblematic embeddings will be eventually also then be explained away\npragmatically. But what if we had on our hands a two-dimensional\nisotope of \u2228 that was specially hand-crafted to deal with these\nanomalies, such as Fusco\u2019s or? The\nunembedded behaviour of \u2228 and or, in view\nof the diagonal equivalence of compounds formed using the two\ndisjunctions, would be the same, so or-disjunction\nwould have all the benefits of\nBoolean disjunction without the drawback of not faring very\nsatisfactorily when appearing in the scope of certain intensional\noperators. On this matter of agreement in logical behaviour when\nunembedded, consider, for example, the introduction and elimination\nrules in a natural deduction system. What they introduce or eliminate\nis the main connective of a formula, so they would not differ in their\nintuitive acceptability in the case of \u201cor\u201d whether this\nwas rendered as Boolean disjunction \u2228 or as Fusco\u2019s\ntwo-dimensional or\n connective.[52]\n More generally, the conditions defining \u2228-classicality (indeed\n#-classicality for any #) of consequence relations or generalized\nconsequence relations pertain only to unembedded occurrences of \u2228\n(or more generally of #). In the case of Fusco (2015), the obligation\noperator O is interpreted by universal quantification over\nsuitably accessible points with the relata of this relation being the\nworlds of local evaluation rather than the world taken as the actual\nworld, which remains the same, so while p\u00a0or\u00a0q\nis a diagonal (though not a\ngeneral) consequence of p, O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis not a diagonal consequence of\n Op.[53]\n Putting it very informally, this is because from the perspective of\nsome world of evaluation, w, with w itself\nconsidered as actual (since we are working the diagonal case), every\nworld deontically accessible to w, qua world of evaluation,\nmay be a p-world, whereas at w if what is true is\nq but not p, then what is required for the truth at\nw of O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis that all the accessible\nworlds be q-worlds, since in moving out to the\nw-accessible worlds we are not changing the status of\nw as the world playing the actual world role. (We are in the\n\u2018middle disjunct\u2019 case of (2) with this example.) This\nillustrates how Fusco has arranged matters so that\np\u00a0or\u00a0q and\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q end up exhibiting the same\nbehaviour when unembedded but differing behaviour when embedded\n\u2013 in the present instance, in the scope of the obligation\noperator. The story with the permissibility operator, written as may\nor M in Fusco (2015), and not there\ntreated as dual to O, is more complicated, so the interested\nreader is referred to that discussion for the details as well as the\nmotivation behind the choice of or in this\nsetting. For present purposes, the main point to stress is the general\nstrategy of using the two-dimensional semantics to model differences\nin ingredient sense compatible with a given assertoric content.\n\nOne may wonder how much room for manoeuvre is made available by this\ngeneral strategy, which, since are concentrating on connectives here,\namounts to asking how many two-dimensional isotopes a given Boolean\nconnective has. A simpler case than that of the binary connectives\nwith which we have been preoccupied is that of the one-place\nconnectives. A \u2018unarized\u2019 version of the whether\nfeaturing in (3) above arises by choosing the case in which \u03c8 is\n\u00ac\u03c6. This can be written more simply as\nA\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6, used (in effect) as the\ndefinition of what was written as O\u03c6 on p. 119 of\nHumberstone (2002). (There is no intention, in using\n\u201cO\u201d here, to evoke any deontic associations.) If\nwe took O as primitive, we could instead define A by\ntaking A\u03c6 to abbreviate\nO\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6 if we wanted. Either way, if an\nepistemic operator K is treated in the same way semantically\nas the deontic obligation operator above (though with its own\naccessibility relation, of course, or even just using neighbourhood\nsemantics here, as in Lewis 1982, p.\u00a0202), then for purely\nBoolean \u03c6, KO\u03c6, alias\nK(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6) ends up\nunrestrictedly equivalent to\n(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u03c6)\u00a0\u2228\u00a0(A\u00ac\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u00ac\u03c6)\nand thus not a bad approximation to something saying that our\ncognitive subject knows whether (or not)\n \u03c6.[54]\n\nOur main concern here, though, is with formulas constructed just using\nA and the Boolean connectives, and in particular, since we\nare considering the 1-place case, with such formulas as can be\nconstructed with the aid of these devices and a single sentence\nletter, p, say. To see how many two-dimensional isotopes a\ngiven 1-ary Boolean connective (equivalently, Boolean formula in just\none variable) might have, since there are only four such connectives\n(or formulas), to within equivalence \u2013 and for these formulas\nthere is of course no contrast between diagonal and unrestricted\nequivalence \u2013 we should ask how many equivalence classes w.r.t.\nthe relation of unrestricted equivalence there are of the one-variable\n\u2018two-dimensional formulas\u2019 (i.e., here, just\nBoolean-with-A formulas). This question is easy to answer if\nwe bear the following things in mind: first, that every formula is\nunrestrictedly equivalent to one in which A occurs, if at\nall, then just immediately before a sentence letter, and secondly,\nthat w.r.t. the general consequence relation, the formulas p\nand Ap are completely independent (by contrast with the\ndiagonal consequence relation, w.r.t. which they are equivalent). Thus\nthe (unrestricted) equivalence-classes of one-variable formulas\ncollectively manifest the same Boolean algebraic structure as do the\nequivalence classes of purely Boolean two-variable formulas. So you\ncan take your favourite Hasse diagram of this 16-element Boolean\nalgebra[55]\n and, leaving all occurrences\nof p intact, replace every occurrence of q with\nAp, and you now have a picture of all the two-dimensional\none-variable formulas (to within unrestricted equivalence) and the\nlogical relations among them. Each of these 16 equivalence classes (or\nany of the formulas in such a class) is a two-dimensional isotope of\nthe Boolean equivalence class (or any of its elements) we get by\nerasing all occurrences of A in the formulas it contains.\nThus the two-dimensional formulas p, Ap, and\nOp most recently encountered, including the first as a\ndegenerate case of a two-dimensional formula for a streamlined\naccount, are two-dimensional isotopes of p, p, and\np\u00a0\u2194\u00a0p (or \u22a4), respectively. You\nwill find that each element of the 4-element Boolean algebra has four\ndistinct elements of the 16-element algebra mapped to it by this\nerasure-of-A mapping. (This would usually be put by speaking\nof the principal congruence generated by identifying\np\u2019s equivalence class with Ap\u2019s \u2013\nalias q\u2019s \u2013 equivalence class: the smallest\ncongruence relation w.r.t. which these two elements of the algebra are\ncongruent.) For example, p (or its equivalence class) has, to\nwithin unrestricted equivalence, the four two-dimensional isotopes\np\u00a0\u2227\u00a0Ap, the logically strongest\nisotope w.r.t. general consequence (lowest in the 16-element algebra)\nand p\u00a0\u2228\u00a0Ap, the weakest isotope\n(highest in the 16-element algebra), and between these two (and\nmutually incomparable), p and Ap. \n\nReturning to the case of binary connectives or two-variable\ntwo-dimensional formulas, we could reason similarly. (The interested\nreader is left to work the general n-variable case.)\n216 = 65,536 is the number of equivalence classes of\n4-variable formulas, the exponent 16 here being chosen as\n24, the number of equivalence classes of 2-variable\nformulas. So if the variables are p, q, r,\ns, when we collapse the former Boolean algebra into the\nlatter by identifying r with p (thinking of\nr as Ap) and s with q (thinking of\ns as Aq) we are moving from 65,536 elements to 16,\nand a similarly equitable distribution renders each element of the\n16-element algebra as the image of 65,536/16 elements of the larger\nalgebra, which equals 4096 (= 212 = 216/\n24). There is a simpler route to this conclusion, and that\nis by consideration of such Stalnaker-inspired matrices as feature in\nFusco\u2019s discussion (see note 51). This is a 4-by-4 matrix since\nwe have to take into account the local (\u2018world of\nevaluation\u2019) truth-value and the actual truth-value of the first\ncomponent (four possible combinations) of a binary compound and\nsimilarly for the second component, and reading down the diagonal\ngives the truth-table for the Boolean connective of which the original\nis a two-dimensional isotope. Thus in Fusco\u2019s case, this\ndescending diagonal reads \u201cT, T, T, F\u201d, just like the\ndescending vertical column of a familiar truth-table as conventionally\ndisplayed. The latter feature is retained however we label with Ts and\nFs (or 1s and 0s if preferred) the non-diagonal cells, of which there\nare 12 (16 minus the four on the diagonal). Since each of these cells\ncan be filled with either a T or an F, so we are back calculating\n212 and getting the answer 4096, whichever binary\ntruth-function our original diagonal had displayed, including of\ncourse that associated with \u2228. Thus, if you like Fusco\u2019s\ngeneral strategy for responding to difficulties like those faced by\nwhat seemed to be Boolean disjunction behaving badly when deontically\nembedded, there is plenty of room to tweak the details of her proposed\nsolution. \n5. Notes and Sources\n \nUnless otherwise stated, page and (sub)section references in this\ninitial paragraph all pertain to Humberstone (2011), where several of\nthe topics touched on this entry are treated at greater length. For\nexample, the treatment of unique characterization in Section\n 3 of the present entry is largely based on\n\u00a74.3 there. (Some issues touched on here are, however, not\ntreated there at all or are addressed in greater detail here.) In\nconnection with note 6 in the present entry,\nconcerning Carnap's observation that the most familiar logical\nframeworks do not force a Boolean interpretation on the connectives\ntreated by the rules they make available, references to some of the\nmany discussions of this theme can be found under \u2018Strong\nvs. Weak Claim\u2019 on p.\u00a0101. Apropos of\nnote 10 (on sentence-position extensionality) in\nthe present entry, referring the reader to this opening paragraph, see\n\u00a73.2 and subsections 4.37\u20138. For the end of\nnote 11 (the commutativity/symmetry distinction\netc.), what is relevant is subsection 3.34, \u201cOperations\nvs. Relations\u201d (though for more on specifically the relational\nside of that contrast, see Humberstone 2013, especially \u00a74). In\nconnection with note 17 (on\n\u2018non-homophonic\u2019 semantic treatments of disjunction), see\nsubsections 6.43\u20136.46 for a survey of some of these treatments,\nand for note 21 (on separately conservative but\njointly non-conservative extension by new connectives with\nprescribed inferential properties), see p.\u00a0568f. \nFor note 32 (on\nsome of Rautenberg's work on what we are calling hybrids of connectives), see alternatively subsection 3.24. For\nnote 41 (appended to a discussion of contrariety\nand subcontrariety), a more detailed discussion can be found in\nsubsection 8.11 and references given there (especially in Remark\n8.11.1). Expanding on note 45: \u00a75.2 goes\ninto more detail on logical subtraction\n(Example 4.4 above); interesting work by\nStephen Yablo on this topic, mentioned there as then unpublished,\nsubsequently appeared in Yablo (2014), Chapters 8 and 9 being of\nparticular relevance. Apropos of note 55: for an example of a Hasse diagram of the 16-element Boolean algebra, nodes labelled with representatives of the classical equivalence classes of two-variable formulas, see Figure\n2.13a on p.\u00a0225. The bearing on logical theory of the topic of the following paragraph of the present section, Galois connections, is stressed in material on pp.\u00a058f., 75 and 80 in \u00a71.1; the list of\n\u2018Galois connection\u2019 oriented discussions of logical\nmatters given in the bottom paragraph of p.\u00a0101 should be\nsupplemented by a reference to Bimb\u00f3 and Dunn (2008). Finally,\nto supplement the Urquhart reference given at the end of the present section\non head linkage as a special relation in intuitionistic logic, see\nsubsection 9.25. The remainder of the present section gives further\nadditional notes and sources on the present entry working through in\norder.\n\nThe Galois connections described in the opening section are what are\nsometimes called contravariant (as opposed to covariant) Galois\nconnections; they were introduced in somewhat different terminology by\nGarrett Birkhoff (1967). Closure operations as defined in the opening\nsection are sometimes called closure operators. Note that the\ndefinition given, although standard, is much less restrictive than the\nnotion of a specifically topological closure operation (in\nparticular, not requiring C(X\n\u222a Y) = C(X)\n\u222a C(Y)\nor C(\u2205) = \u2205,). Some\nauthors discuss matters of logical theory placing a particular\nemphasis on closure operations and their systems of closed sets (sets\nX with C(X) =\nX); see Pollard and Martin (1996) and references there\ncited.\n\nThe phrase \u201clogical frameworks\u201d has been used in ways\nother than that introduced in Section\n 2,\n e.g., in Huet and Plotkin (1991). The use of \u201c\u227b\u201d\nhere as a sequent separator is occasioned by current HTML font\nlimitations; its general use for that purpose is not recommended.\nCarnap\u2019s observation about logic pursued in \nSet-Fmla\nnot being capable\nof enforcing the intended truth-functional interpretation of various\nconnectives (such as \u2228, \u00ac, and \u2192) has received extensive\nattention in the literature, as was mentioned in the first paragraph of this section. The term \u201ccongruential\u201d\nused here is taken from Segerberg (1982); it is based on a related use\nof the term by D. Makinson (for modal logics in Fmla\ncontaining \u2610 \u03c6 \u2194 \u2610 \u03c8\nwhenever they contain \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8). In some quarters the term\n\u201cself-extensional\u201d is used for congruentiality, while in\nothers the term \u201cextensional\u201d\u2014used quite differently\nhere\u2014is used for this property.\n\nThe emphasis on (bivalent) valuations throughout our discussion may\nsuggest some limitation of scope: are we not excluding\n\u2018many-valued logic\u2019 (or better: matrix semantics)? And\nwhat about Kripke style semantics in which truth is doubly relativized\nnot only to a model but to a point therein? No, there is no\nlimitation. Every (generalized) consequence relation is determined by\na class of valuations. The matrix assignments of values to formulas\nare homomorphisms from the algebra L of formulas to the algebra\nA\u2014presumed to be of the same similarity type of\nL\u2014of a matrix (A, D), where D\n\u2286 A; D is called the set of designated elements\nof the matrix. Thus the compositional semantics is done in terms of\nsuch homomorphisms, any one of which, h, say, gives rise to a\nbivalent valuation vh defined by setting\nvh(\u03c6) = T iff h(\u03c6)\n\u2208 D, and a Set-Fmla\nor Set-Set\nsequent is valid in the matrix just in case it\nholds\u2014in the usual bivalent sense\u2014on the valuation\nvh for every such homomorphism\nh, the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nmatrix is the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nclass of all such vh,\n etc.[56]\n Similarly for classes of matrices, with the quantification now over\nall vh where h is a homomorphism\nfrom the language to any matrix in the class. Likewise, in the\nKripke-semantical case, any model M and\npoint x therein gives rise to the valuation\nvMx\ndefined by\nvMx(\u03c6)\n= T iff\nM\u22a8x\n\u03c6,\nand the (generalized) consequence relation determined by a class of\nmodels is that determined by all such vMx\nwith M\nin the class. (This is the so-called\nlocal (generalized) consequence relation; for the global\nvariant, use valuations vM\nwith vM(\u03c6)\n= T iff for all points\nx in the model, M\u22a8x\n\u03c6.) There is\nan obvious further adaptation of these definitions if one wants a\nformulation in terms of determination by (\u201csoundness and\ncompleteness with respect to\u201d) a class of frames rather than\nmodels.\n\nAs well as Prior (1957) cited in Section\n 2\n on the \u0141-modal system, the following references are useful:\nSmiley (1961), Smiley (1962), Porte (1979), Font and H\u00e1jek\n(2002). The original paper is \u0141ukasiewicz (1953).\n\nThe problem with a live-and-let-live attitude toward differences\nbetween logics differing over the logical powers of a connective when\nthe weaker set of powers already suffice for unique characterization\n(\u00aci vs. \u00acc in Section\n 3)\n was already pointed out in Popper (1948), and often re-surfaces in\nsubsequent literature e.g., Harris (1982), Hand (1993), Fari\u00f1as del Cerro and Herzig (1996); see also the opening paragraph of the present section. Uniquely\ncharacterized connectives are sometimes spoken of as implicitly\ndefined, but there are definite risks involved in the latter\nusage\u2014see Do\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1985). The\n\u201cimplicit\u201d in the title of Caicedo (2004) does not carry\nquite the same risks, and refers to a special case of unique\ncharacterization, essentially amounting to unique characterization by\nzero-premiss rules in Fmla\u2014i.e., by\naxioms. Similarly, the \u201cfunctionally dependent\u201d\nconnectives of Smiley (1962) are those uniquely characterized by\nzero-premiss rules, taken in concert with the standard structural\nrules, in Set-Fmla\u2014though\nSmiley\u2019s definition is put\nin terms of consequence relations. This class of connectives may well\ncoincide with the class of projection-conjunction connectives. It does\nnot include disjunction or implication, as treated in intuitionistic\nor classical logic, which are uniquely characterized by rules\nessentially containing a non-zero-premiss rule\u2014though these\nwould be uniquely characterized by zero-premiss rules (together with\nthe structural rules) in Set-Set.\nMakinson (2014) also addresses questions of\nexistence and uniqueness in connection with connectives, but his\nexistence questions concern, not the existence of a connective\nsatisfying certain rules (or more generally, certain conditions), but\nthe existence of rules (or this or that kind) satisfied by a given\nconnective, where connectives are individuated semantically (more\nspecifically, by association with bivalent truth-functions). The\nvarious notions of uniqueness considered by Makinson do apply to\nconnectives rather than rules, and are defined in terms of the rules\nsatisfied but the connectives themselves are again individuated\ntruth-functionally and so none ends up amouting to unique\ncharacterization as understood here. See note 1, p.\u00a0365, in\nMakinson (2014) for a discussion contrasting his concerns with those\nfound \u201cin some proof-theoretic studies\u201d, and citing\nDo\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1988). (In fact in the footnote,\nthough not in the bibliography, the date is given as 1998.) \n\nId-inductivity is called \u2018regularity\u2019 in Kaminski (1988);\nfor Id-inductivity and Cut-inductivity and related concepts (under\ndifferent names), see also Ciabattoni (2004) and Ciabattoni and Terui\n(2006).\n\nA study of Popper\u2019s generally under-appreciated work in logic is\nprovided in Schroeder-Heister (1984). The faulty view that differences\nover logic amount to talking at cross purposes was defended in\nwritings by W. V. Quine to which references may be found in Morton\n(1973), where this view is subjected to a somewhat milder version of\nthe criticism in Section\n 3.\n A full discussion of substructural logics, also mentioned in Section\n 3,\n and related topics is provided in Restall (2000).\n\nAside from the papers by Prior, Belnap, Stevenson and Peacocke (and\nRead 1988) mentioned in Section\n 3,\n the Tonk example is discussed in (at least)\nthe following places: Wagner (1981), Hart (1982), \u00a74.12 in\nTennant (1978). Interest continues unabated, as witnessed by the\nfollowing publications from the period 2004\u20132006 alone: Hodes\n(2004), Cook (2005), Tennant (2005), Bonnay and Simmenauer (2005),\nChapter 5 of Priest (2006) and Wansing (2006). Subsequent treatments\nof interest include Avron (2010) and Rahmann (2012). Although Tonk\nis Prior\u2019s best known example of\nnon-conservative extension, he also noted the non-conservative effect\nof familiar logical principles concerning conjunction when added to a\npurely implicational intermediate logic; references, details, and\nfurther discussion can be found in Humberstone (2014). For the notion\n\u2013 or perhaps better, notions \u2013 of harmony between\nrules (especially in natural deduction), see the Tonk\nreferences just given, and also Chapter 23 of\nTennant (1987), Weir (1986), Dummett (1991) (passim), Milne\n(1994) and (2002), and Read (2000), as well as the following more\nrecent investigations: Read (2010), Steinberger (2011), Francez and\nDyckhoff (2012), Hjortland (2012), Francez (2014), Milne (2015), Read\n(2015), Schroeder-Heister (2015) and Dicher (2016). For general background in\nproof-theoretic semantics informing these discussions, two useful\nreferences are Schroeder-Heister (2014) and the editor\u2019s\ncontribution (Chapter 1) to Wansing (2015). The subject of harmony is\nalso briefly touched on in Makinson (2014), esp. p.\u00a0369.\n\nMaterial of interest on the subjects of special and universally\nrepresentative connectives can be found in Jankov (1969), Pahi (1971),\nde Jongh and Chagrova (1995), in addition to the references cited in\nSection\n 3.\n For the fact that the relation of head linkage is special in\nintuitionistic logic, see Urquhart (1974) \u2014 not that this terminology appears there.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aloni, Maria, 2016, \u201cDisjunction\u201d, <em>The Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.
