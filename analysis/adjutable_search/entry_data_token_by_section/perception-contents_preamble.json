    "main_text": "\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, the phrase \u2018the contents of\nperception\u2019 means, roughly, what is conveyed to the subject by\nher perceptual experience. For example, suppose you are looking into a\npiano at the array of hammers and strings. There will be a way these\nthings look to you when you see them: they will look to have a certain\nshape, color, texture, and arrangement relative to one another, among\nother things. Your visual experience conveys to you that the piano has\nthese features. If your experience is illusory in some respect then\nthe piano won\u2019t really have all those features. But even then,\nthere will still be something conveyed to you by your experience.\nThree main questions will be addressed in this entry. First (Sections\n1\u20132), what are contents and what is their relation to\nexperiences? Second (Sections 3\u20137), which contents are contents\nof experience? Finally (Section 8), in virtue of what do experiences\nhave contents, when they do?\n",
