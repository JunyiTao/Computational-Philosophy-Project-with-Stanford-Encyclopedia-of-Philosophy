Cosmology and the Arrow of Time\n\nThe Second Law of thermodynamics has long been connected to the\nseeming asymmetry of the arrow of time, that time seems to flow, so to\nspeak, in only one direction for all systems no matter how different\nin kind they are and no matter how spatiotemporally separated. Indeed,\none of the fundamental problems is that different types of system seem\nprima facie to give rise to independent arrows of time,\ne.g., thermodynamical, electromagnetic, cosmological, and so\non, with no a priori reason why they should all point in the\nsame direction. (See Zeh 2014 for a thorough recent review; see also\nthe Encyclopaedia entry\n Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time.)\n The Generalized Second Law and the corresponding idea of general\ngravitational entropy\n (section 5.5)\n introduces a new possible arrow of time, the gravitational. \n\nThere is a peculiar and intimate relation between the Second Law of\nordinary thermodynamics and time. That physical systems always seem to\nchange in such a way that entropy never decreases picks out a\nprivileged direction in time, as it were. At the present moment, there\nare two \u201cdirections\u201d in time one may consider: that\npointing to the future, and that to the past. The Second Law says,\nroughly speaking, that order never spontaneously increases toward the\nfuture. Looking back towards the past, however, that is exactly how it\nmay appear to us: if one thinks of the ordinary change of physical\nsystems as running backwards in time, then it will exactly appear as\nthough order is spontaneously increasing. \n\nThat fact is already on its own remarkable: all other known\nfundamental principles and laws of physics are time-symmetric (putting\naside the minuscule violations of time-reversal symmetry manifested by\nthe weak nuclear force). That means that if a given sequence of\nchanges of a physical system governed by those principles and laws is\nallowed, then the same sequence in reversed order is also allowed as a\nphysical possibility. If a tea cup drops to the floor and smashes into\nlittle bits, then the reverse process is also possible: the smashed\nbits can spontaneously leap up into the air towards each other and\nre-assemble into an undamaged tea cup. If an antenna can absorb a\ngiven type of radio wave, it can also emit that same wave. And so on.\nThat is not what we see in physical systems governed by thermodynamics\nand the Second Law. An ice cube in a glass of warm water spontaneously\nmelts, and the water cools a bit. We never see a cool glass of water\nspontaneously warm while an ice cube forms in the middle of it. This\nis even more mysterious when one considers the fact that we know that\nthe water and ice are, at a deeper level of description, really just a\ncollection of an enormous number of molecules and atoms themselves\nmoving around, bouncing off each other, and connected\ntogether\u2014and, to the best of our knowledge, the principles and\nlaws governing the changes in that collection of molecules\nare time symmetric. Why is it that the laws governing the\nmicro-structure of water and ice are time symmetric, but, when one\nlooks at the water and ice in the aggregate, ignoring the fine details\nof the micro-structure, the governing principle becomes time\nasymmetric? That is one of the deepest and most hotly debated\nquestions in the foundations of physics. \n\nThis all raises a second question: if entropy tends only to increase,\nand so order in the universe continually degrades, where did all the\norder around us come from in the first place? Life, for instance,\nseems like an extraordinarily highly structured phenomenon. Living\norganisms are much more highly structured than the air and earth and\nwater surrounding us, and certainly more so than the food we consume\nto build and replenish our highly structured bodies. The same holds\ntrue of planets themselves, stars, galaxies, and clusters and\nsuperclusters of galaxies\u2014they all are prima facie much\nmore highly ordered and structured than the homogeneous and highly\nrarefied plenum of interstellar dust surrounding them, and the vast\nreaches of empty space itself. How did such highly structured physical\nsystems evolve in the first place? Are they all not manifestly a\nviolation of the Second Law? (See Schr\u00f6dinger 1944 for the\nlocus classicus of discussion of these issues.) \n\nIndeed, the problem for physical systems on the cosmological scale\n(planetary systems and larger) is made even more urgent by what we\nknow about conditions in the very early universe, very soon after the\nBig Bang, that we think obtained at the start of the cosmos. We have\nstrong evidence that the very early universe consisted of a highly\nhomogeneous, extremely hot and condensed gaseous soup of fundamental\nparticles. According to ordinary thermodynamics, however, that is a\nstate of extremely high entropy. That such a physical system evolved\ninto ordered structures such as stars and galaxies\u2014prima\nfacie a state of much lower entropy for the same matter and\nenergy now redistributed\u2014seems on the face of it to be a massive\nviolation of the Second Law. \n\nOne might with some justice ask: well, so what? Entrenched scientific\ntheories and principles get overthrown all the time. The caloric\ntheory of heat got overthrown by thermodynamics and the theory of\nmolecular kinetics. Classical Newtonian mechanics got overthrown by\nquantum mechanics. Newtonian gravitational theory got overthrown by\ngeneral relativity. Now the evidence from cosmology tells us that the\nSecond Law is just one more in a long line of principles that have not\npassed the test of confrontation with empirical data. That response,\nhowever, does not do justice to the profound faith that physicists\nhave in the Second Law. When Einstein was once asked what he thought\nphysics would look like a century from then, he famously said he\nthought nothing currently believed would still be held as fundamental,\nexcept only the Second Law. Everything else\u2014quantum theory,\ngeneral relativity\u2014could go, but he could not imagine the Second\nLaw being overthrown. Contemporary physicists feel the same\n way.[19]\n They love the Second Law. There must be, they demand, a way to\nreconcile the universality of the Second Law with its seeming\nviolation in the way the universe has evolved on cosmological scales.\n\n\nWhat does all this have to do with black holes? At first glance,\nnothing. On deeper reflection, however, quite a lot. Hawking's Area\nTheorem, that black holes never decrease in size and can only\nincrease, is time asymmetric in the same way as the behavior of\nordinary physical systems governed by the Second Law. This, recall,\nwas the basis for the postulation of the Generalized Second Law, based\non the idea that black holes themselves possess entropy, itself one of\nthe motivating reasons that have led physicists to hypothesize that\nthe gravitational field in general, not just black holes, possess an\nintrinsic entropy\n (section 5.5),\n as Penrose (1979) hypothesized. Indeed Penrose did far more than just\nargue that the gravitational field itself possesses a generalized\nentropy. He also proposed what has come to be known as the Conformal\nCurvature Hypothesis, which states that the gravitational and\ncosmological arrows of time are driven, if not determined, by this\ngeneralized gravitational entropy. \n\nThe existence of such a general gravitational entropy may provide a\nkey to answering the question about the development of stars,\ngalaxies, and other large-scale structure in the universe, as well as\nthe puzzle about the fact that the very early universe seems prima\nfacie to have been already a state of very high\n entropy.[20]\n Just as the thermodynamical behavior of ordinary matter picks out a\npreferred direction in time, the idea goes, so does the way gravity\ntends to shape the evolution of matter on cosmological scales, and,\nmoreover, it picks out the very same direction in time. If\none could show that the extremely homogeneous conditions of the very\nearly universe was a state of low gravitational entropy, and\nthat the current inhomogeneous clumping of matter into stars,\ngalaxies, etc., is a state of high gravitational entropy, and\nthat the difference in gravitational entropy is enough to\ncounterbalance the decrease in the entropy of ordinary matter as the\nuniverse evolved from homogeneity to clumpiness, then one would have\nsaved the Second Law by replacing it with the Generalized Second Law.\nAnd that is exactly what many physicists today think is the solution\nto our problem: how to reconcile the appearance of an early state of\nthe universe of high entropy with the demanded universal validity of\nthe Second Law. \n\nAs remarked above, Penrose (1979) started this suite of ideas when he\nproposed the Conformal Curvature Hypothesis: that an entropy should be\nattributed to the gravitational field proportional to some measure of\n\u201cpurely gravitational\u201d degrees of freedom, with a low\nentropy attibuted to homogeneous and isotropic gravitational fields.\nSome work in subsequent decades has been done, primarily based on\nGoode and Wainwright (1985) and Newman (1993a, 1993b), to try to\ngeneralize Penrose's proposal and make it rigorous. Almost all this\nwork has focused on the behavior of conformal singularities\n(characterized at the end of\n section 1.3)\n which are, in a natural sense, \u201cearly\u201d cosmological\nsingularities, such as the Big Bang, and on the behavior of various\nmeasures of gravitational degrees of freedom moving to the future away\nfrom such singularities. (There has been some work, such as Rudjord\net al. 2008, attempting to link the Conformal Curvature\nHypothesis directly to black-hole entropy.) The idea is that the\ninitial cosmological singularity, in accord with Penrose's Conformal\nCurvature Hypothesis, had extraordinarily low entropy, thus\ncompensating the high entropy of the homogeneous ordinary matter\npresent then, making the early universe a state of low total entropy.\nAs the universe develops over time, and matter clumps into individual\nsystem (stars, galaxies, clusters and super clusters of galaxies,\netc.), the entropy of ordinary matter seems to drop, but,\nagain, that is more than compensated for by the enormous increase in\ngravitational entropy, thus saving the Generalized Second Law. \n\nThis is all in accord with the so-called Past Hypothesis\u2014the\nneed to postulate that the universe must have started in an extremely\nspecial, low-entropy state\u2014if one admits the existence of\ngeneralized gravitational entropy. It has long been held by many\nphysicists and philosophers that the Past Hypothesis is the only way\nto preserve the validity of the Second Law of thermodynamics over\ncosmological scales (Albert 2000). Many philosophers and physicists\nhave balked at the Past Hypothesis, however, claiming it is\nexplanatorily vacuous or that it itself raises further difficult\nquestions, such as why the universe should have started in such a\n\u201cspecial and unlikely\u201d state at all. (See Albert 2000,\nEarman 2006, Callender 2010, and Wallace 2010 for discussion of many\nof these issues, from competing perspectives.) Penrose (1979) put\nforward the intriguing possibility that his Conformal Curvature\nHypothesis itself could point to an answer to all these questions: the\nseemingly required \u201cspecialness\u201d of the state of the early\nuniverse may have a dynamical explanation in a more fundamental theory\nof quantum gravity. As intriguing as that possibility may be, it by no\nmeans has universal support. Wald (2006a), for example, gives\ncompelling arguments against the possibility that the low entropy of\nthe early state of the universe could have a dynamical origin. \n",
