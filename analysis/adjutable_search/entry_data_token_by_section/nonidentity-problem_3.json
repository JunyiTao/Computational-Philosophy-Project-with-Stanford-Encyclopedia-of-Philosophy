    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases || The slave child\n2.2 The slave child\n\nWe see the same kind of argument but at a less global and more local\nlevel in Kavka\u2019s slave child case. In exchange for $50,000, a\ncouple enters into a binding, enforceable contract with a wealthy man\naccording to which the couple will conceive and bear a child who will\nbe transferred at birth to the wealthy man as a slave (Kavka 1982,\n100). The child is conceived and born pursuant to the contract \u2013\nand, as a slave, suffers in various ways. We think what the couple has\ndone is \u201coutrageous\u201d (Kavka 1982, 101). And we think that\nis so because of what the couple\u2019s choice does to the slave\nchild. But can the latter view be correct? Does the couple\u2019s\nchoice truly make things worse for, or harm, the\nslave child? Is there anything else the couple could have done instead\nthat would have made things better for that particular child? The\ncouple certainly had alternatives. They could have not entered into\nthe contract and not taken steps to produce a child, and they\ncould have not entered into the contract and still taken steps to\nproduce a child. The former alternative, of course, would not have\nbeen better for the slave child. (We are still assuming that the\nexistence is itself worth having.) But nor is the latter. For, had the\ncouple produced a child but not under contract, the timing and\nconditions of conception would then (very probably) have changed and\nany better off child the couple might then have produced would (very\nprobably) have been a distinct child, nonidentical to the slave child\n(Kavka 1982, 100 n. 15). The slave child, in other words, has no\nbetter alternative than what he or she has in fact been given as a\nslave. Once we appreciate that fact, it becomes hard to see how what\nthe couple has done harms, or makes things worse for, or is otherwise\n\u201cbad for,\u201d the child. Kavka\u2019s \u201cpleasure\npill\u201d case parallels the slave child case (Kavka 1982, 98).\n",
