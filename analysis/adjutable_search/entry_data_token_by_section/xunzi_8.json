    "main_text": "The Heart-Mind (xin)\n9. Xunzi\u2019s Reception after His Death\n\n At[12]\n the end of his life, Xunzi was the leading teacher and philosopher in\nthe Chinese world. Among his former students were some of the most\ninfluential men in politics, including Han Fei \u97d3\u975e (d.\n233 BCE), Li Si \u674e\u65af (d. 208 BCE), and Zhang Cang\n\u5f35\u84bc (ca. 250\u2013151 BCE), as well as transmitters of\nseveral leading redactions of canonical texts, including Fuqiu Bo\n\u6d6e\u4e18\u4f2f and perhaps Mao Heng \u6bdb\u4ea8 (Goldin\n1999: xii).\n\nThe early Han \u6f22 dynasty statesman Lu Jia \u9678\u8cc8 (ca.\n228\u2013ca. 140 BCE) is sometimes said to have been Xunzi\u2019s\nstudent as well (e.g., by Tang Yan \u5510\u664f [1857\u20131920]\nin Wang Liqi 1986: 222\u201323), but the two men\u2019s dates make\nthis relationship unlikely. Perhaps Lu Jia was a disciple of Fuqiu Bo,\nand thus an intellectual grandson of Xunzi. Regardless, the strongest\nevidence of Lu Jia\u2019s indebtedness to Xunzi lies on the level of\nideas (Li Dingfang 1980). Like Xunzi, Lu Jia appealed to the classics,\nthe sages\u2019 textual legacy, as the best practical guide to\ngovernment and moral self-cultivation (Puett 2002: 253\u201354; Jin\nChunfeng 2006: 73\u201374). But Lu\u2019s most important\nphilosophical thesis is that human beings bring about auspicious and\ninauspicious omens through their own actions.\n\nXunzi, we recall, argued strongly against the belief in Heavenly\nportents. Lu Jia accepted Xunzi\u2019s framework, but with a single,\nconsequential innovation: people bring about their own fortune or\nmisfortune by emitting qi \u6c23: \n\n\nThus when societies fail and the Way is lost, it is not the work of\nHeaven. The lord of the state has done something to cause it. Bad\ngovernment breeds bad qi; bad qi breeds disasters\nand abnormalities. (Wang Liqi 1986: 155) \n\n\nBy adding the element of qi\u2014a term that Xunzi rarely\nused, and certainly did not build into his metaphysics\u2014Lu Jia\nretains Xunzi\u2019s volitionless and mechanistic Heaven but forges a\nnovel philosophical justification for the arcane science of omenology,\nwhich Xunzi mercilessly deprecated. Where Xunzi counseled us to ignore\nabnormalities, Lu Jia accepts their validity as\n\u201cadmonitions\u201d (jie \u8aa1). But, once again,\nHeaven itself has no effect on our success or failure. If we are faced\nwith a host of wood-boring caterpillars, to use Lu\u2019s vivid\nexample, the only way to account for them is to acknowledge that our\ngovernment is responsible for their generation through its maleficent\nconduct (Zhou Guidian 1999: 51\u201353; Puett 2002: 249\u201352).\nTwo coeval philosophers, Jia Yi \u8cc8\u8abc (201\u2013169 BCE)\nand Dong Zhongshu \u8463\u4ef2\u8212 (ca. 198\u2013ca. 107\nBCE), agreed that human beings are responsible for their own fortune\nor misfortune, and thus have no cause to blame Heaven, although Jia Yi\ndid not refer to qi in prosecuting his theory, whereas Dong\nZhongshu did (Goldin 2007).\n\nDong Zhongshu is reported to have written a paean to Xunzi (now lost),\nand writers of late antiquity, such as Wang Chong \u738b\u5145\n(27\u2013ca. 100 CE) and Ban Gu \u73ed\u56fa (32\u201392 CE),\nstill took him seriously as a philosopher. But thereafter,\nXunzi\u2019s star began to set. In later centuries, the two\ntirelessly repeated clich\u00e9s about Xunzi were that he propagated\nthe anti-Mencian doctrine that human nature is evil, and that, by\nserving as Li Si\u2019s and Han Fei\u2019s teacher, he furthered the\ncause of Legalism (fajia \u6cd5\u5bb6) and thus subverted\nhigh-minded principles. Ji Kang \u5d47\u5eb7 (223\u2013262), for\nexample, obliquely identified Xunzi as the chief architect of\neverything that Ji and his group disdained: artificial ritualism,\ncounterfeit erudition, and an oppressive network of laws that serve\nonly to interfere with the innocuous enjoyment of life (Goldin 2007:\n140\u201342).\n\nBy the Tang \u5510 dynasty, even literati who admired\nXunzi\u2014such as Han Yu \u97d3\u6108 (768\u2013824)\u2014were\ncareful to add that his works contain grave mistakes (Kong Fan 1997:\n281; Liu Youming 2006: 48\u201350). In the Song \u5b8b, there were\nstill some voices that praised him, but the opinion with the greatest\nlong-term consequences was that of Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9\n(1130\u20131200), who declared that Xunzi\u2019s philosophy\nresembled those of non-Confucians such as Shen Buhai\n\u7533\u4e0d\u5bb3 (fl. 354\u2013340 BCE) and Shang Yang\n\u5546\u9785 (d. 338 BCE), and that he was indirectly responsible\nfor the notorious disasters of the Qin dynasty (Kong Fan 1997:\n291\u201395). For the rest of imperial history, Xunzi was rejected by\nthe cultural\n mainstream;[13]\n into the twentieth century, he was criticized by intellectuals such\nas Kang Youwei \u5eb7\u6709\u7232 (1858\u20131927), Tan Sitong\n\u8b5a\u55e3\u540c (1865\u20131898), and Liang Qichao\n\u6881\u555f\u8d85 (1873\u20131929) as the progenitor of the\nConfucian scriptural legacy, which, in their view, had derailed the\noriginal Confucian mission and plunged China into a cycle of\nauthoritarianism and corruption that lasted more than two thousand\nyears.\n\nToday the tide has reversed almost completely. Xunzi is one of the\nmost popular philosophers throughout East Asia, and has been the\nsubject of a large number of books published over the past two\ndecades. From a twenty-first-century perspective, this revival of\ninterest in Xunzi is not hard to explain: his body of work has always\nbeen one of the best preserved, and with the commonplace scholastic\nobjections to his philosophy having lost most of their cogency, it is\nonly to be expected that philosophical readers should be attracted to\nhis creative but rigorous arguments. In this sense one could say that\nXunzi has finally been restored, more than two millennia after his\ndeath, to his erstwhile position as zui wei lao shi.\n",
