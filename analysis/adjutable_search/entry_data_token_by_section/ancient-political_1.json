    "main_text": "Politics and Philosophy in Ancient Greece || Politics and Justice\n2.1 Politics and Justice\n\nThe distinctive understanding of \u201cpolitics\u201d forged in\nGreece was marked by the historical emergence of the independent\n city-state[1]\n and the variety of regimes which it could harbor. Notwithstanding\nfantasies of a pre-political \u201cAge of Kronos\u201d, the\npolis was widely understood as the acme of human civilization\nand the principal domain in which human fulfillment could be sought.\nThe city was the domain of potential collaboration in leading the good\nlife, though it was by the same token the domain of potential\ncontestation should that pursuit come to be understood as pitting some\nagainst others. Political theorizing began in arguments about what\npolitics was good for, who could participate in politics, and why,\narguments which were tools in civic battles for ideological and\nmaterial control as well as attempts to provide logical or\narchitectonic frameworks for those battles.\n\nSuch conflicts were addressed by the idea of justice, which was\nfundamental to the city as it emerged from the archaic age into the\nclassical period. Justice was conceived by poets, lawgivers, and\nphilosophers alike as the structure of civic bonds which were\nbeneficial to all (rich and poor, powerful and weak alike) rather than\nan exploitation of some by others. Hesiod\u2019s late eighth-century\nepic poem Works and Days, for example, contrasts the brute\nstrength with which a hawk can dominate a nightingale (\u201cYou are\nbeing held by one who is much stronger\u2026 I will make a meal of\nyou, if I want, or let you go,\u201d lines 206\u2013208), with the\npeace and plenty which flourishes wherever justice, such as rendering\nfair verdicts to foreigners, is preserved (lines 225\u2013230).\n\nSo understood, justice defined the basis of equal citizenship and was\nsaid to be the requirement for human regimes to be acceptable to the\ngods. The ideal was that, with justice as a foundation, political life\nwould enable its participants to flourish and to achieve the\noverarching human end of happiness (eudaimonia), expressing a\ncivic form of virtue and pursuing happiness and success through the\ncompetitive forums of the city. Whether justice applied to the\ncity\u2019s relation with other cities was a further and highly\ncontested point, memorably explored in Thucydides\u2019 recounting of\nthe \u201cMelian Dialogue\u201d in 416 BCE, in which emissaries of\nthe Athenians debated the meaning of justice with the leaders of the\nisland-city of Melos, a city they were threatening with death and\ndisaster should they fail to submit to Athenian imperial demands\n(Thuc. V. 84\u2013114).\n",
