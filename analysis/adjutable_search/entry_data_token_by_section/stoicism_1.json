    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Systematicity\n1.2 Systematicity\n\nStoic philosophy was, from Zeno onwards, conceived of as comprising\nthree parts: physics (phusik\u00ea), logic\n(logik\u00ea), and ethics (\u00eathik\u00ea).\nEach of these parts includes a wide array of further topics nowadays\ndealt with separately. Logic, for example, includes not only formal\nlogic, but also questions now typically falling under the remit of\nphilosophy of language, epistemology, and philosophy of mind. In\naddition, all three parts of philosophy were thought by the Stoics to\nwork together to form an interconnected and coherent system (exactly\nhow strongly the claim of systematization is to be taken is disputed;\nsee below). The Stoics emphasized this point with a number of\nanalogies intended to illustrate how the three parts of philosophy fit\ntogether and form a whole:\n\n\nThey compare philosophy to a living being, likening logic to bones and\nsinews, ethics to the fleshier parts, and physics to the soul. They\nmake a further comparison to an egg: logic is the outside, ethics what\ncomes next, and physics the innermost parts; or to a fertile field:\nthe surrounding wall corresponds to logic, its fruit to ethics, and\nits land or trees to physics. (Diogenes Laertius, 26B; see our\n bibliography\n for a guide to citations in this entry)\n\n\nThe latter two analogies seem to point to the idea that the purpose of\nphilosophy, according to the Stoics, is to become virtuous, that is,\nto attain wisdom and thereby lead the good life, so that the\noverarching goal (the crop or the egg white, which the ancients\nassumed was nourished by the yolk) is ethical. Nonetheless, the other\nparts of philosophy play an essential and necessary part in achieving\nthis goal, and the orthodox Stoic position is that mastery of all\nthree parts of philosophy is required for human flourishing. This is\napparent in the way the Stoics treat a number of philosophical\nquestions and in the many connections visible between the different\nparts of their theory: conclusions in one part of Stoic philosophy\ntend to reinforce and ratify those in another. For recent discussion\nof the unity of the Stoic system, see Bronowski 2019, ch. 1; cf.\nChristensen 1962, Ierodiakonou 1993, and Inwood 2012. For debates on\nthe connection of Stoic ethics to other parts of the system,\nespecially physics, see Annas 1993, who takes the ethical part to be\nlargely independent of physical theory, and Cooper 1999a and 2012, who\nsees them as thoroughly intertwined (see also Betegh 2003).\n",
