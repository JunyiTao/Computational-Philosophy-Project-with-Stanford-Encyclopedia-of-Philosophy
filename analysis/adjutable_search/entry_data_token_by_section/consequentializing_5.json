    "main_text": "Three Motives for, and Types of, Consequentializing || Pragmatic Consequentializing\n3.3 Pragmatic Consequentializing\n\nMost recently, some have consequentialized for purely pragmatic\nreasons (see Colyvan, Cox, & Steele 2010 and Lazar 2017). For\ninstance, Seth Lazar tells us:\n\n\nMy interest in consequentializing is purely instrumental. It allows me\nto represent my moral theory in a way that makes it amenable to\ndecision theory. \u2026Consequentializing [my] deontological moral\ntheory allows [me] to apply it to situations with imperfect\ninformation. It makes deontological decision theory possible. (2017:\n586\u201387)\n\n\nI\u2019ll call those with this or some other pragmatic motive for\nconsequentializing pragmatic consequentializers. They give\nwhat\u2019s known as the pragmatic argument for\nconsequentializing (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1488). And if we take\nthe relevant pragmatic motive to be the one that Lazar cites, the\ncorresponding version of this argument would be as follows:\n\nWhereas consequentialist theories are amenable to decision theory,\nnon-consequentialist theories are not, which gives consequentialist\ntheories a distinct advantage over non-consequentialist theories when\ndealing with imperfect information.\nBut, by consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nfaithfully represent its extension even if we do thereby misrepresent\n(or, at least, make opaque) its explanation for that extension\n(Colyvan et al. 2010: 523).\nThus, if we consequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nthen apply decision theory to the resultant act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory and thereby determine the target\nnon-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic verdicts in situations\ninvolving imperfect information.\n\n\nThus, pragmatic consequentializing aims to consequentialize some\nplausible non-consequentialist theory using the Footian Procedure to\ncome up with an act-consequentialist counterpart that can then be\nemployed for some practical purpose. For instance, Lazar (2017)\nconsequentializes the deontic verdicts that his non-consequentialist\ntheory yields in situations involving perfect information so that he\ncan then use the tools of decision theory on the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart to determine what deontic verdicts\nhis non-consequentialist theory yields in situations involving\nimperfect information.\n\nSo, for the pragmatic consequentializer, the reason for\nconsequentializing rather than, say, Kantianizing is that\nthere\u2019s supposedly something unique about act-consequentialism\nthat makes it amenable to decision theory, which is pragmatically\nuseful.\n",
