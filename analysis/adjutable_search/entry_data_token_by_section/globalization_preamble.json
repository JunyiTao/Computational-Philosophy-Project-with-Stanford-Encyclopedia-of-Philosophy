    "main_text": "\n\nCovering a wide range of distinct political, economic, and cultural\ntrends, the term \u201cglobalization\u201d remains crucial to\ncontemporary political and academic debate. In contemporary popular\ndiscourse, globalization often functions as little more than a synonym\nfor one or more of the following phenomena: the pursuit of classical\nliberal (or \u201cfree market\u201d) policies in the world economy\n(\u201ceconomic liberalization\u201d), the growing dominance of\nwestern (or even American) forms of political, economic, and cultural\nlife (\u201cwesternization\u201d or \u201cAmericanization\u201d),\na global political order built on liberal notions of international law\n(the \u201cglobal liberal order\u201d), an ominous network of\ntop-down rule by global elites (\u201cglobalism\u201d or \u201cglobal technocracy\u201d),\nthe proliferation of new information technologies (the \u201cInternet\nRevolution\u201d), as well as the notion that humanity stands at the\nthreshold of realizing one single unified community in which major\nsources of social conflict have vanished (\u201cglobal\nintegration\u201d). Globalization is a politically-contested\nphenomenon about which there are significant disagreements and\nstruggles, with many nationalist and populist movements and leaders\nworldwide (including Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan,\nHungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and former US President Donald\nTrump) pushing back against what they view as its unappealing\nfeatures.\n\nFortunately, recent social theory has formulated a more precise\nconcept of globalization than those typically offered by politicians\nand pundits. Although sharp differences continue to separate\nparticipants in the ongoing debate about the term, most contemporary\nsocial theorists endorse the view that globalization refers to\nfundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social\nexistence, according to which the significance of space or territory\nundergoes shifts in the face of a no less dramatic acceleration in the\ntemporal structure of crucial forms of human activity. Geographical\ndistance is typically measured in time. As the time necessary to\nconnect distinct geographical locations is reduced, distance or space\nundergoes compression or \u201cannihilation.\u201d The human\nexperience of space is intimately connected to the temporal structure\nof those activities by means of which we experience space. Changes in\nthe temporality of human activity inevitably generate altered\nexperiences of space or territory. Theorists of globalization disagree\nabout the precise sources of recent shifts in the spatial and temporal\ncontours of human life. Nonetheless, they generally agree that\nalterations in humanity\u2019s experiences of space and time are\nworking to undermine the importance of local and even national\nboundaries in many arenas of human endeavor. Since globalization\ncontains far-reaching implications for virtually every facet of human\nlife, it necessarily suggests the need to rethink key questions of\nnormative political theory.\n",
