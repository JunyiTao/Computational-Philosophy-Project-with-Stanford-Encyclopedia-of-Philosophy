Political Philosophy in the Roman Empire\n\nAlthough Rome ruled over an empire long before Cicero died, and the\nrepublican constitution that he had served would remain formally\nintact in many respects long after that date as well, the imperial era\nof Roman government is standardly associated with the elevation of\nOctavian by the Senate in 27 BCE by according him the title of\n\u201cAugustus\u201d (among other novel titles and combinations of\noffices that he was then and later accorded). Octavian and a number of\nhis successors were also referred to as the princeps,\nliterally the first man, implicitly the first among nominal equals,\nsometimes translated by the English derivation \u2018prince\u2019,\nand so giving rise to the description of the period from 27\nBCE\u2013284 CE as the Principate (to be followed in turn by the\nDominate). In this period, Stoicism continued to exercise an important\nhold, drawing in part on the Hellenistic genre of advice to kings;\nPlatonism too, and forms of Pythagoreanism, regained much sway.\nMoreover, a number of Stoic-minded writers and orators played their\nparts in Roman political life, some fashioning the life of a\nphilosopher itself into a distinctive form of what might be called\nnon-political politics (Trapp 2007). In this article, I cannot explore\nthe full ramifications of these philosophical developments under the\nEmpire, in writers in Greek as well as in Latin, and influencing not\nonly pagan but also Jewish and Christian thinkers. The article also\nleaves aside the many and varied important contributions to political\nthought in Rome and its possessions made not by philosophers but by\nhistorians, including Livy, Sallust, Diodorus Siculus, Tacitus, and\nSuetonius. (Again, for an overview that seeks to integrate political\nand historical developments with political theorizing, see J.W. Atkins\n2018.)\n",
