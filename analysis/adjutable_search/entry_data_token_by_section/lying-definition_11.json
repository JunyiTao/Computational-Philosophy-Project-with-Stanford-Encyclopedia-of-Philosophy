    "main_text": "Traditional Definition of Deception\n3. Traditional Definition of Deception\n\n\nThe dictionary definition of deception is as follows: \u201cTo cause\nto believe what is false\u201d (OED 1989). There are several\nproblems with this definition, however (Barnes 1997; Mahon 2007;\nCarson 2010). The principal problem is that it is too broad in\nscope. On this definition, mere appearances can deceive, such as when\na white object looks red in a certain light (Faulkner,\n2013). Furthermore, it is possible for people\nto inadvertently deceive others. If Steffi believes that\nthere is a talk on David Lewis and the Christians on Friday, and she\ntells Paul that \u201cThere is a talk on Lewis and the Christians on\nFriday,\u201d and as a result Paul believes that there is a talk on\nC. S. Lewis and the Christians on Friday, then Steffi has deceived\nPaul. Also, it is possible for people to mistakenly deceive\nother people. If Steffi mistakenly believes that there is not a\nphilosophy talk on Friday, and she tells Paul that there is not a\nphilosophy talk on Friday, and he believes her, then then Steffi has\ndeceived Paul.\n\n\nAlthough some philosophers hold that deceiving may be inadvertent or\nmistaken (Demos 1960; Fuller 1976; Chisholm and Feehan 1977; Adler\n1997; Gert 2005), many philosophers have argued that it is not possible\nto deceive inadvertently or mistakenly (Linsky 1970; van Horne\n1981; Barnes 1997; Carson 2010; Saul 2012; Faulkner 2013). They\nhold that deception, like lying, is intentional. They reserve\nterm \u201cmislead\u201d to cover cases of causing false beliefs\neither intentionally or unintentionally (Carson 2010, 47).\n\n\nA modified version of the dictionary definition that does not allow\nfor either inadvertent or mistaken deceiving is as follows:\n\n(D1)\nTo deceive =df to intentionally cause to have a false\nbelief that is known or believed to be false.\n\n\nD1 may be taken as the traditional definition of deception, at least\nin the case of other-deception (Baron 1988, 444 n. 2). As contrasted\nwith \u2018lying,\u2019 \u2018deceive\u2019 is an achievement or\nsuccess verb (Ryle 1949, 130). An act of deceiving is not an act of\ndeceiving unless a particular result is achieved. According to D1,\nthat result is a false belief. Note that D1 is not restricted\nto the deception of other persons by other persons; it applies to\nanything that is capable of having beliefs, such as (possibly)\nchimpanzees, dogs, and infants.\n\n\nThere is no statement condition for deception. In addition to\ndeceiving by means of lying, it is possible to deceive using natural\nor causal signs (indices), such as packing a bag as though one were\ngoing on a holiday, in order to catch a thief (Kant 1997, 202). It is\npossible to deceive by using signs that work by resemblance (icons),\nfor example by posting a smiley face emoticon about a news item that\none is actually unhappy about. Finally, it is possible to deceive by\nnon-linguistic conventional signs (symbols), such as wearing a wedding\nring when one is not married, or wearing a police uniform when one is\nnot a police officer. It is also possible for a person to deceive by\ncursing, making an interjection or an exclamation, issuing a command\nor an exhortation, asking a question, saying \u201cHello,\u201d and\nso forth. It is also possible to deceive by omitting to make certain\nstatements, or by remaining silent.\n\n\nThere is also no untruthfulness condition for deception. It is\npossible to deceive by making a truthful and true statement that\nintentionally implies a falsehood. This is a palter. Palters include\nBill Clinton stating \u201cThere is no improper relationship,\u201d\nwith the intention that it be believed that there was never an\nimproper relationship (Saul 2012, 30), greeting a famous person by his\nor her first name with the intention that other people believe that you\nare a close friend of his, or making a reservation for a restaurant or a hotel\nas \u201cDr.,\u201d intending to be believed to be a (typically\nwealthier) physician rather than a (typically less wealthy) academic\n(Schauer and Zeckhauser 2009, 44). If Pavel truthfully and truly tells\nTrofim that he is going to Pinsk, with the intention that the\ndistrustful Trofim believe falsely that Pavel is going to Minsk, and as\na result Trofim believes falsely that Pavel is going to Minsk, then\nPavel deceives Trofim (a double bluff). It is also possible to\ndeceive using truthful statements that are not assertions, such as\njokes, ironic statements, and even the lines of a play delivered on\nstage, so long as the intention to deceive can be formed. If, for\nexample, I am asked if I stole the money, and I reply in an ironic\ntone, \u201cYeah, right, of course I did,\u201d when I did steal the\nmoney, intending that I be believed to have not stolen the money, and\nif I am believed, then I have deceived using a truthful statement (it\nis unclear if such cases of \u201ctelling the truth falsely\u201d\n(Frank 2009, 57) are to be considered as cases of paltering).\n\n\nThere is also no addressee condition for deception. In addition to\ndeceiving addressees, it is possible to deceive those listening in, as\nin a bogus disclosure (e.g., deceiving F.B.I. agents secretly known to\nbe listening in on a telephone conversation) or a disclosure (e.g.,\ndeceiving NASA handlers openly listening to exchanges between\nastronauts and their wives in Capricorn One). It is also\npossible to deceive an addressee about some matter other than the\ncontent of the statement made (e.g., making a truthful statement, but\nfaking an accent).\n",
