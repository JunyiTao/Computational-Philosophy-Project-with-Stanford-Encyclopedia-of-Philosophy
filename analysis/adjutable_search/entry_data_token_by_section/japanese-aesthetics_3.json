    "main_text": "Wabi: Simple, Austere Beauty\n4. Riky\u016b\u2019s Tea and the Equalizing Aesthetic of Wabi\n\nFew figures in Japanese history emerge as more formidable artists than\nSen no Riky\u016b (\u5343\u5229\u4f11, 1522\u20131591), and few\naesthetic movements are more transformative than his rendition of the\ntea ceremony, Wabicha (\u4f98\u8336). While Riky\u016b is\nrecognized as the preeminent Japanese tea master, his role as an\naesthete extends much farther. A consummate painter and poet, a\npractitioner of ikebana, an accomplished calligrapher and\nlandscape artist, Riky\u016b in time became an influential government\ndignitary advising the Shogunate on cultural and artistic matters.\nThrough countless inventions and innovations, the impact of the\naesthetic world he created, and some say perfected, stretches far\nbeyond the boundaries of the tea ceremony itself, unearthing novel\nprospects for Japanese identity and citizenship, pioneering new social\nvirtues, original visions of human existence and religious salvation,\nand ultimately, opening new possibilities for equality (Suzuki\n278\u20139), all rooted in the wabi aesthetic.\n\nWhile Riky\u016b\u2019s reputation has come to eclipse that of his\npredecessors, his aesthetic innovations were part of a lineage born in\nthe port city of Sakai, comprising the tea master Murata Shuk\u014d\n(\u6751\u7530\u73e0\u5149, 1423\u20131502) and his student\nTakeno J\u014d\u014d (\u6b66\u91ce \u7d39\u9d0e,\n1502\u20131555), both Zen adherents, the latter of whom would later\nmentor Riky\u016b. Both of his forerunners began pioneering tea\naesthetics, which laid the groundwork for Riky\u016b\u2019s eventual\nrefinement, and both harnessed fresh aesthetic stratagems aimed at\nincorporating the wabi aesthetic into the tea ceremony\n(Ludwig, 387\u2013390. Sen S\u014dshitsu, 123\u2013157).\n\nWhat distinguished Riky\u016b\u2019s Wabicha from his\nmentors\u2019 ceremonies was its resolution of the tensions between\ncompeting aesthetic undercurrents coursing through the 16th-century\npractice of tea and broader Japanese cultural worlds (Slusser\n55\u201357). Before the advent of Wabicha, medieval tea was\nbecoming increasingly polarized in two directions. The Shoin\n(\u66f8\u9662) style orchestrated ostentatious displays of wealth\ncarried out in opulent domiciles of the powerful aristocracy. Within\nthis milieu, the most cherished tea utensils (meibutsu\n\u540d\u7269) were rare and precious wares imported from China,\ntheir aesthetic value predominantly gauged by how well they displayed\nthe host\u2019s affluence and power, rendering Shoin tea an\nintentionally non-egalitarian ceremony.\n\nThe ostentation of the Shoin style found further\nreinforcement in what was called the \u201cbasara\u201d\nattitude (\u5a46\u5a11\u7f85), characterized by tasting contests\n(t\u014dcha \u95d8\u8336) and lavish\ntea parties (chayoriai \u8336\u5bc4\u5408) orchestrated\nfor grandiose demonstrations of wealth. As the Shoin style\nwas in ascendency, the tea world was simultaneously evolving in the\nopposite direction, in a version of the ceremony known as the\nS\u014dan (\u8349\u5eb5) style, an\naesthetic that extolled austerity and poverty rather than opulence and\naffluence. In place of grand halls of the aristocracy and gatherings\nwith dozens or even hundreds of guests, the so called\n\u201cgrass-hut\u201d S\u014dan style\naestheticized the world of the farmer and hermit, and sought the\nintimacy of a gathering in a tiny unadorned hut, typically attended by\na mere handful of guests. Shuk\u014d and J\u014d\u014d were some of\nthe progenitors of this style and it was tea as the \u201cgrass\nhut\u201d ideal that Riky\u016b inherited and eventually honed to\nperfection.\n\nA second polarizing cultural tendency in 16th century\nJapan, which cut across the Shoin and\nS\u014dan divide, was a tension between\nwarrior and religious aesthetic sensitivities. Riky\u016b\u2019s\nWabicha dissolved this tension by melding elements of Samurai\ngatherings with those cultivated in Zen monasteries. His ceremony\navoided exclusive alignment with religiosity or militarism, and\nemployed the wabi aesthetic to infuse an egalitarianism\ncounterbalancing hierarchical divisions entrenched within both\nspheres, re-casting wabi as a \u201cnon-hierarchical\nawareness of the real\u201d (Hirota 95).\n\nBeyond the realm of the martial and the monastic, the populace of\n16th-century Japan was deeply stratified, from Samurai at the top all\nthe way down to farmers, peasants, and merchants at the bottommost\nsocial rung. These divisions were absolute, and upward mobility to\nhigher social strata was virtually inconceivable. Nevertheless,\nRiky\u016b deployed the wabi aesthetic to challenge social\nstratification ( Sen S\u014dshitsu 182\u2013183). In his\nWabicha, all patrons of tea were considered equal, and his\naesthetic innovations concretized this principle, ensuring this was\nnot simply a lofty ideal. In the text attributed to him, the\nNamp\u014droku (1690), he claims that \u201cworldly rank is\nignored\u201d in the tea room.\n\nRiky\u016b\u2019s aesthetic decisions were guided by a veneration of\nthe meagre existence of the agrarian lifestyle, the strict economy of\nthe mountain hermit, and the austere lack of adornment of the poor\nfarmer. He thus had a predilection for rough un-hewn materials, which\nmeant walls and timber within the tea hut were left raw and\nunfinished, with straw and cob visibly protruding. Costly Chinese\nporcelain, ivory flower vases and tea scoops were replaced by locally\nproduced bamboo versions. Colorful flowers were almost entirely\nexcluded, while an \u201caniconic\u201d ceremony emerged,\ncharacterized by the absence of imagery within the hut and surrounding\ngarden.\n\nAmong the numerous architectural innovations Riky\u016b deployed, the\nmost egalitarian were several features of the tearoom, which rendered\nit physically impossible for tea guests to express their social\nposition or power. The nijiriguchi (\u8e99\u53e3),\nroughly translated as \u201ccrawl in space\u201d was the only entry\nway for guests (previous instances of the sukiya had another\nlarger entryway for nobility and aristocracy). The tiny aperture\nmeasuring only around 60cm x 60cm (2ft x 2ft) achieved two equalizing\naims of Wabicha (So\u0304shitsu Sen 182\u2013183). Firstly,\nsamurai were prevented from entering with their two Katana\nswords, which normally were the most visible signs of their position\natop the social hierarchy. (Riky\u016b introduced a sword rack\n(katanakake \u5200\u639b\u3051) next to the\nnijiriguchi under the tea hut\u2019s eaves.) Further, the\nsize of the opening meant that wealthy aristocrats and courtiers could\nnot make it through the small opening with their oversized top hats.\nThus, once inside Riky\u016b\u2019s tiny sukiya, no\nappearance endured of the markings normally employed to exhibit and\nmaintain the rigid social hierarchy. Even conversation or figures of\nspeech invoking social status, references to employment, objects\nexhibiting one\u2019s wealth, or associations legitimating\none\u2019s power were all strictly prohibited.\n\nAn additional dimension of the Wabicha aesthetic, which\nreinforces egalitarian ideals is Riky\u016b\u2019s embrace of the\nlocal. He opposed the trend of importing expensive Chinese tea ware\nand instead championed locally crafted articles reflecting the\nagrarian lifestyle outside the bustling urban city centre. Amidst\nRiky\u016b\u2019s manifold innovations, the most\nfamous\u2014renowned for epitomizing the very quintessence of\nwabi\u2014was the inception of an entirely novel pottery\nstyle known as Raku (\u697d\u713c, raku-yaki).\nRiky\u016b enlisted a local potter Sasaki \u201cRaku\u201d\nCh\u014djir\u014d (\u9577\u6b21\u90ce) to give form to tea ware\nembodying the wabi aesthetic. As opposed to highly\nsophisticated Chinese porcelain, Raku was rustic earthenware,\nutilitarian, un-adorned, often asymmetrical and imperfect in form and\nfinish; celebrating the grace of a humble existence, an ode to local\nhermit and farmer. Firing and drying techniques were developed to\ngrant leeway to the atmosphere, nature, and gravity to express\nthemselves in the clay body as it heated then cooled. The aesthetic\nevoked the monk or farmer in the vicinity working with what was at\nhand rather than the worldly aristocrat importing treasures from\nforeign shores. Aligned with the ethos of wabi, Raku\nware was valued for its exposition of the simple beauty of meagre\nexistence, accentuating the aesthetics of paucity over opulence. Thus,\nRaku played a levelling role that made a previously exclusive\nmaterial culture surrounding the tea ceremony more egalitarian.\n\nAnother important innovation that curtailed signs of wealth involved\ntransformations in design and emphasis of the hanging scroll\n(Kakemono \u639b\u7269). Once a peripheral piece,\nRiky\u016b elevates the scroll, recalibrates its aesthetics toward\negalitarian ideals, and installs it as the centrepiece of the tea hut\nand the ceremony as a whole (Hirota, 217\u2013218). Riky\u016b not\nonly elevated the scroll to the aesthetic forefront of the ceremony,\n(a role previously occupied by the tea caddy in the Shoin\nstyle) but also shifted scroll aesthetics away from costly and\nexclusive Chinese versions. Under Riky\u016b\u2019s patronage,\nscrolls were for the first time commissioned from local Zen Buddhist\ncalligraphers and painters.\n\nWhile his interventions may have succeeded in challenging the rigid\nsocietal stratification beyond the confines of the tea world, they\nmight have also set the stage for his own tragic downfall. The markers\nof social hierarchy he sought to dismantle were crucial for justifying\nand maintaining the Shogunate\u2019s power. As a governmental\nofficial, Riky\u016b had little latitude to deny Hideyoshi\u2019s\nwishes, which often diverged drastically from the austerities of\nWabicha (for instance, building the golden Tai-an\n(\u5f85\u5eb5) tearoom). His egalitarianism was undermining a\nvital symbol the Shogun relied on to showcase his supremacy, and\nthreatened to subvert power structures that maintained his position\natop the social-political hierarchy (Slusser, 56-57).\nRiky\u016b\u2019s Wabicha and the hierarchy-nullifying\nsymbols and structures he shaped countered the power politics embraced\nby the Shogunate and challenged the militaristic interests of the\nelite he served. Riky\u016b would be ordered to commit ritual suicide\n(seppuku \u5207\u8179), and following his last tea\nceremony in 1591, he wrote his death poem before taking his own\nlife.\n\nWhile Riky\u016b\u2019s impact on the subsequent history of Japanese\ntea and culture at large is irrefutable, his legacy is complicated.\nHis ritual suicide was appropriated for a subsequent aestheticization\nof hyper-nationalistic tendencies, thereby setting an early standard\nfor an \u201caesthetic\u201d death as sacrifice to one\u2019s\nnation at time of war (Cross, 163\u2013166). Thus, his tragic moment\nwas promoted as a means to rationalize some of the empire\u2019s most\negregious brutalities. A memory that should have remained untarnished\nbecame attached to Japan\u2019s calamitous aestheticization of\nimperialism, warfare, and self-sacrifice\u2014values fundamentally at\nodds to those that Riky\u016b introduced to Japanese culture through\nthe wabi aesthetic in the tea ceremony.\n5. Sabi: Rustic Patina\n\nThe term sabi occurs often in the\nMany\u014dsh\u016b, where it has a connotation of\ndesolateness (sabireru means \u201cto become\ndesolate\u201d), and later on it seems to acquire the meaning of\nsomething that has aged well, grown rusty (another word pronounced\nsabi means \u201crust\u201d), or has acquired a patina that\nmakes it beautiful.\n\nThe importance of sabi for the way of tea was affirmed by the\ngreat fifteenth-century tea master Shuk\u014d, founder of one of the\nfirst schools of tea ceremony. As a distinguished commentator puts it:\n\u201cThe concept sabi carries not only the meaning\n\u2018aged\u2019\u2014in the sense of \u2018ripe with experience\nand insight\u2019 as well as \u2018infused with the patina that\nlends old things their beauty\u2019\u2014but also that of\ntranquility, aloneness, deep solitude\u201d (Hammitzsch, 46).\n\nThe feeling of sabi is also evoked in the haiku of the famous\nseventeenth-century poet Matsuo Bash\u014d, where its connection with\nthe word sabishii (solitary, lonely) is emphasized. The\nfollowing haiku typifies sabi(shii) in conveying an\natmosphere of solitude or loneliness that undercuts, as Japanese\npoetry usually does, the distinction between subjective and\nobjective:\n\nSolitary now \u2014\n\nStanding amidst the blossoms\n\nIs a cypress tree.\n\n\nContrasting with the colorful beauty of the blossoms, the more subdued\ngracefulness of the cypress\u2014no doubt older than the person\nseeing it but no less solitary\u2014typifies the poetic mood of\nsabi.\n\nTanizaki\u2019s \u201cIn Praise of Shadows\u201d frequently\ncelebrates sabi. By contrast with Western taste, he writes of\nthe Japanese sensibility:\n\nWe do not dislike everything that shines, but we do prefer a pensive\nlustre to a shallow brilliance, a murky light that, whether in a stone\nor an artifact, bespeaks a sheen of antiquity. . . . We love things\nthat bear the marks of grime, soot, and weather, and we love the\ncolors and the sheen that call to mind the past that made them.\n(Tanizaki, 11\u201312)\n\n\nThis is a significant existential consideration: the sheen of older\nthings connects us with the past in ways that shiny products of modern\ntechnology simply cannot. And since older things tend to be made from\nnatural materials, to deal with them helps us to realize our closest\nconnections with the natural environment.\n\nSabi figures prominently, for Tanizaki, in the aesthetics of\nthe traditional Japanese toilet, which \u201cstands apart from the\nmain building at the end of a corridor, in a grove fragrant with\nleaves and moss.\u201d He wrestles with the vexations that modern\ntechnology imposes on the question of fixtures, as the traditional\nones are superseded by \u201cwhite porcelain and handles of sparkling\nmetal\u201d (Tanizaki, 3, 6).\n\nWood finished in glistening black lacquer is the very best, but even\nunfinished wood, as it darkens and the grain grows more subtle with\nthe years, acquires an inexplicable power to calm and soothe. The\nultimate, of course, is a wooden \u201cmorning glory\u201d urinal\nfilled with boughs of cedar: this is a delight to look at and allows\nnot the slightest sound. (Tanizaki, 6)\n But the primary delights of the traditional Japanese\ntoilet are its closeness to nature: in that special place,\n\u201csurrounded by tranquil walls and finely grained wood, one looks\nout upon blue skies and green leaves\u201d (Tanizaki, 4). Among the\nachievements of traditional Japanese architecture Tanizaki praises the\ntoilet as \u201cthe most aesthetic.\u201d\n\n\nOur forbears, making poetry of everything in their lives, transformed\nwhat by rights should be the most unsanitary room in the house into a\nplace of unsurpassed elegance, replete with fond association with the\nbeauties of nature.\n\n\nIt is surely fitting that one should perform those most natural\nfunctions of urinating and defecating, returning to the earth the\nremains of its bounties, in natural rather than high-tech\nsurroundings.\n\nA more exalted exemplification of sabi is the exquisite\nSilver Pavilion at Ginkakuji in Kyoto. Even though the tea ceremony is\nsaid to have originated here, in a small sabi-saturated\nteahouse, the exterior of the pavilion was originally going to be\ncovered in silver foil, in emulation of the Golden Pavilion (14th\ncentury) at Kinkakuji. Without ever having enjoyed a coating of\nsilver, the Silver Pavilion is the epitome of sabi and one of\nthe most graceful structures ever built. The contrast with the larger,\nand flashier Golden Pavilion, whose coating of gold leaf lends it a\nquite different (and distinctly un-sabi) kind of beauty, is\ninstructive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger Photographs of the Silver Pavilion at Ginkakuji and the Golden Pavilion at Kinkakuji\n\n\n\nIn 1950 a deranged Buddhist acolyte, deeply disturbed by the beauty of\nthe Golden Pavilion, set fire to it and burned it to the ground. An\nexact replica was built on the original site in 1955. The aesthetic\nqualities of the original structure are celebrated in Mishima\nYukio\u2019s fine novel The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\n(1956), as well as in Ichikawa Kon\u2019s classic film Enjo\n(Conflagration, 1958). In 1987, the burgeoning Japanese economy made\nit possible for the first time in the building\u2019s history to\ncover the structure with gold leaf, according to the creator\u2019s\noriginal intention. The result is breathtakingly spectacular\u2014but\ntotally un-Japanese. Old-time residents of Kyoto famously complained\nthat it would take a long time for the building to acquire sufficient\nsabi to be worth looking at again. At the rate the patina\nseems to be progressing, probably several centuries.\n\nIn 2011, after the tsunami in T\u014dhoku and the explosions and\nnuclear meltdown in Fukushima caused an acute energy shortage in\nJapan, one of many responses was a dramatic reduction of lighting in\npublic places, and especially in subway stations with extensive\nunderground restaurant and shopping precincts. Tanizaki cites a\nprescient remark from the late 1920s to the effect that \u201cperhaps\nno two countries waste more electricity than America and Japan\u201d\n(Tanizaki, 35). He would be delighted now to see Japanese cities\nreducing the ubiquitous glare of neon lighting and all-night electric\nillumination, in a dimming of unnecessary lights which thereby\nreintroduces some of the shadows he so eloquently praises.\n6. Y\u016bgen: Mysterious Grace\n\nY\u016bgen may be, among generally recondite Japanese\naesthetic ideas, the most ineffable. The term is first found in\nChinese philosophical texts, where it has the meaning of\n\u201cdark,\u201d or \u201cmysterious.\u201d\n\nKamo no Ch\u014dmei, the author of the well-known\nH\u014dj\u014dki (An Account of my Hut, 1212), also wrote\nabout poetry and considered y\u016bgen to be a primary\nconcern of the poetry of his time. He offers the following as a\ncharacerization of y\u016bgen: \u201cIt is like an autumn\nevening under a colorless expanse of silent sky. Somehow, as if for\nsome reason that we should be able to recall, tears well\nuncontrollably.\u201d Another characterization helpfully mentions the\nimportance of the imagination: \u201cWhen looking at autumn mountains\nthrough mist, the view may be indistinct yet have great depth.\nAlthough few autumn leaves may be visible through the mist, the view\nis alluring. The limitless vista created in imagination far surpasses\nanything one can see more clearly\u201d (Hume, 253\u201354).\n\nThis passage instantiates a general feature of East-Asian culture,\nwhich favors allusiveness over explicitness and completeness.\nY\u016bgen does not, as has sometimes been supposed, have to\ndo with some other world beyond this one, but rather with the depth of\nthe world we live in, as experienced with the aid of a cultivated\nimagination.\n\nThe art in which the notion of y\u016bgen has played the most\nimportant role is the N\u014d drama, one of the world\u2019s great\ntheater traditions, which attained its highest flourishing through the\nartistry of Zeami Motokiyo (1363\u20131443). Zeami wrote a number of\ntreatises on N\u014d drama, in which y\u016bgen\n(\u201cGrace\u201d) figures as \u201cthe highest principle\u201d\n(Rimer, 92). He associates it with the highly refined culture of the\nJapanese nobility, and with their speech in particular, though there\nis also in N\u014d a \u201cGrace of music,\u201d a \u201cGrace of\nperformance [of different roles],\u201d and a \u201cGrace of the\ndance\u201d (Rimer, 93). It is something rare, that is attained only\nby the greatest actors in the tradition, and only after decades of\ndedicated practice of the art. It is impossible to conceptualize, so\nthat Zeami often resorts to imagery in trying to explain it:\n\u201cCannot the beauty of Grace be compared to the image of a swan\nholding a flower in its bill, I wonder?\u201d (Rimer, 73).\n\nThe most famous formulation comes at the beginning of Zeami\u2019s\n\u201cNotes on the Nine Levels [of artistic attainment in\nN\u014d],\u201d where the highest level is referred to as \u201cthe\nart of the flower[ing] of peerless charm\u201d:\n\nThe meaning of the phrase Peerless Charm surpasses any explanation in\nwords and lies beyond the workings of consciousness. It can surely be\nsaid that the phrase \u201cin the dead of night, the sun shines\nbrightly\u201d exists in a realm beyond logical explanation. Indeed,\nconcerning the Grace of the greatest performers in our art [it gives\nrise to] the moment of Feeling that Transcends Cognition, and to an\nart that lies beyond any level that the artist may consciously have\nattained. (Rimer, 120)\n\n\nThis passage alludes to the results of a pattern of rigorous\ndiscipline that informs many \u201cperforming arts\u201d (which\nwould include the tea ceremony and calligraphy as well as theater) in\nJapan, as well as East-Asian martial arts. N\u014d is exemplary in\nthis respect, since its forms of diction, gestures, gaits, and dance\nmovements are all highly stylized and extremely unnatural. The idea is\nthat one practices for years a \u201cform\u201d (kata) that\ngoes counter to the movements of the body and thus requires tremendous\ndiscipline\u2014to the point of a breakthrough to a \u201chigher\nnaturalness\u201d that is exhibited when the form has been\nconsummately incorporated. This kind of spontaneity gives the\nimpression, as in the case of Grace, of something\n\u201csupernatural.\u201d\n7. Y\u016bgen and Landscape Painting\n\nIntriguing features of Japanese aesthetics are revealed through the\nartistic practices of Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d and his most\ncelebrated work, the so-called \u201cSplashed ink landscape\u201d of\n1495 (Haboku Sansui, literally, \u201cBroken Ink\nLandscape\u201d). Taking the first steps towards reading his art\ncalls on us to recognize a distinctive feature of Japanese landscape\npaintings, that is, as art objects they have a considerably expanded\naesthetic status relative to similar works as interpreted within\nWestern philosophical and art historical traditions. Of course, the\npainting object itself is important, but key aesthetic value also lies\nin the bodily performance the work attests to. Properly estimating the\nbeauty of Sessh\u016b\u2019s \u201cSplashed ink\nlandscape\u201d\u2014similar to how one should appreciate Japanese\ncalligraphy\u2014involves more than simply making judgments regarding\nthe marks on paper, but also calls for an appreciation of the bodily\nmovements that created the work. Because Sessh\u016b\u2019s\nspontaneous movements were cultivated according to highly disciplined\nZen Buddhist practices, interpreting his landscape art demands an\naesthetics expanded to embrace the philosophic and religious.\n\nSessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d (\u96ea\u821f\u7b49\u694a,\n1420\u20131506) was a towering figure of the Japanese art world who\nhelped initiate an indigenous artistic tradition at a time when\nphilosophic-religious practices were going beyond their Chinese\ninfluence, as Chan Buddhism gave rise to Zen Buddhism in Japan.\nSessh\u016b was part of a trajectory of many centuries to establish\nJapanese forms of Buddhism as an enduring feature of the\ncountry\u2019s religious, philosophic, and aesthetic identity. During\nhis life, Zen was reaching prominence as a religious discipline, as\nwere the related arts under Ashikaga patronage. The Muromachi Period\nwas the time of Zen aesthetics: not only monochrome ink painting, but\nall Japanese aesthetic practices (geid\u014d) including\ncalligraphy, tea ceremony, N\u014d drama, and dry landscape gardening\nflourished as expressions of the Zen, especially Rinzai Zen, spirit of\nthe time. During this period, a shift was underway in the painting\nworld from kara-e (\u5510\u7d75 \u201cChinese\npainting\u201d) to yamato-e\n(\u5927\u548c\u7d75 \u201cJapanese painting\u201d).\nRepresentations of deities for devotional purposes, and paintings of\nDaoist and Buddhist themes (d\u014dshakuga) were being\nsupplanted as the heart of art practice as Japan saw its first\nmovements towards initiating an art tradition seeking purely aesthetic\nideals. Landscape painting was central to that movement.\n\nSessh\u016b was a celebrated painter, poet, calligrapher, and\ngardener, who mastered all of the major Chinese styles and genres,\nfrom bird and flower paintings, to portraiture, hanging scrolls,\nscreens, and fans. It was his landscapes, however, particularly his\nfamed \u201cSplashed Ink Landscape\u201d for which he has been\nimmortalized. This painting offers insight into a central concept of\nJapanese aesthetics discussed above, that is, y\u016bgen.\n\n\n\nSplashed Ink Landscape by Sessh\u016b\n\n\n\nThe mysterious grace of his most celebrated landscape painting derives\nas much from the space that is left un-touched, the invisible and\nabsent (often referred to as the \u201cdragon\u2019s veins\u201d of\na painting) as from what is painted and visible. The work appears\nincomplete, still in the act of formation, and the dramatic negative\nspaces created by the mists allow the various forms to dissolve and\nblend into one another, but more decisively, according to the\ny\u016bgen dynamic, this negativity invites the viewer into the\npainting to actively complete it. As artists employing y\u016bgen\nprinciples in other genres have shown, the incompleteness and\nallusiveness of the artwork summons the viewer into the scene. In\nGhilardi\u2019s words, \u201cthe onlooker must merge in the image,\ncompleting the empty spaces, making it a lively element of nature\nitself, \u2018between\u2019 visible and invisible\u201d (Ghilardi,\n2015, 99).\n\nSessh\u016b does not seek to render every detail of the landscape to\nachieve representational verisimilitude, to depict an object that\nwould be discernible for a subject. The aim is to give only a\nsuggestion or a trace of trees, mountains, or waters, which appear to\nnegate themselves as objects. Accordingly, Sessh\u016b does not\ncircumscribe forms but offers the impression of poetic immediacy by\nbreaking them down. Extreme abbreviation and abstraction are employed\nsuch that any form, if even discernible, is pushed as far as possible\nfrom objectivity without disappearing completely into formlessness. As\nJullien writes regarding Chinese painters who influenced Sessh\u016b,\nthey paint the \u201clandscape in the tonality of as if, in\nthe mode of appearing-disappearing, at once \u2018as if there\nwere\u2019 and \u2018as if there were not.\u2019\u201d(Jullien,\n2009. 8) The central grouping of trees, the inn blending into their\ntrunks, and the tiny oarsman all appear but feel as though they are\nabout to be lost, maybe already transitioning into a vague memory,\nonly a brushstroke away from dissolving completely. A sensitive viewer\ndoes not simply perceive a representation of this event, but can sense\nthe sweeping and spontaneous gestures that gave rise to the\nephemerality of the scene. To appreciate this aesthetic feature of the\npainting invokes Buddhist principles Sessh\u016b would have cultivated\nas a Zen monk.\n\nSessh\u016b\u2019s life and work are exemplary for Japanese\naesthetics given that his practice was not aesthetic in a restricted\nsense, but also encompassed the religious and philosophical principles\nof Daoist-inspired Zen Buddhism. \u201cSplashed ink landscape\u201d\nwas composed in Sessh\u016b\u2019s 76th year, a time when\nhe claimed that his eyes \u201cwere growing misty\u201d and Daoism\nwas increasingly influential for his painting. As a painter-priest,\nboth his meditative as well as his artistic practice would have aimed\nat self-negation, at achieving \u201cnon-self\u201d as per the goal\nof Zen training. As Yukio Lippit writes, \u201cSplashed Ink Landscape\nthus showcases a mode of ink painting that projects both cultivated\nartistic agency and a state of subjectlessness. This condition of the\npermeable subject would prove pitch-perfect for the Japanese monk\npainter of the late medieval period\u201d (Lippit 2012, 71). To\ndisclose how this aesthetic-religious goal was approached in painting\npractice reveals the Daoist roots of Zen Buddhism.\n\nPainting was among the Japanese aesthetic practices referred to as\ngeid\u014d \u82b8\u9053. One of the sinographs shared\namong the compounds for archery (kyud\u014d\n\u5f13\u9053), martial arts (j\u016bd\u014d\n\u67d4\u9053), calligraphy (shod\u014d \u66f8\u9053),\nflower arranging (kad\u014d \u83ef\u9053), tea ceremony\n(sad\u014d \u8336\u9053) is the sinograph dao\n(\u9053), (d\u014d or michi in Japanese)\nindicating the philosophic-religious orientation of the practices. To\nmove according to the dao is to move with a natural\nspontaneity as an embodiment of the well-known concept\n\u201cnon-action\u201d (wuwei \u7121\u7232). Acting\nspontaneously involves moving beyond the binary of activity or\npassivity; that is, the world moves the body as much as the body moves\nin the world. Accordingly, as Nishida comments, we can say that\n\u201cSessh\u016b painted nature or that nature painted itself\nthrough Sessh\u016b\u201d (Nishida 1990, 135). The graceful\nnaturalness of the swordsman, the calligrapher, or the N\u014d actor\nis also characteristic of the painter\u2019s gestures. All are bodily\npractices that seek to harmonize with the spontaneous motions of the\ndao through non-action. Thus, to estimate the aesthetic value\nof Sessh\u016b\u2019s brushwork is to appreciate its religious source\nin Daoist-informed Buddhist practice. Because observers can harmonize\ntheir own bodies with the movements animating the painting, the work\nelicits more than aesthetic judgments, it is itself a site for\ncultivating religious-philosophic discipline.\n\nThe \u201csplashed ink\u201d technique Sessh\u016b employed is\nparticularly exemplary of the expanded frame of Japanese aesthetics.\n\u201cSplashed Ink\u201d (hatsuboku) was one of several\n\u201cbroken ink\u201d (haboku) spontaneous techniques\noriginating in China, which Sessh\u016b learned while travelling to\nstudy with painters and conduct religious practice at its monasteries.\nThe techniques ranged from spontaneous washes and splashes to actual\nink-flinging and dripping. While these methods sound reckless and were\nassociated with an \u201caesthetics of inebriation\u201d and\n\u201caesthetics of accident,\u201d the splashed ink idiom is in\nfact the most demanding style, regarded as the highest form of\nexpression and the supreme test of the artist\u2019s skill. Likewise,\nit was thought to test the observer\u2019s sensitivity like no other\ngenre. The style originated with the \u201cliterati\u201d artists of\nthe Southern Song School of Chinese landscape painting who favored\ny\u016bgen-style abbreviated poetic suggestion, rather than\nthe detailed and descriptive \u201cacademic\u201d approach of the\nNorthern School. Thus, following this tradition, painters such as\nSessh\u016b did not aim to develop virtuoso skill to create a fully\nformed art image, but in negating the self and becoming continuous\nwith the motions of nature, they follow the Daoist precept that\n\u201cthe great image has no form.\u201d\n8. Iki: Refined Style\n\nThe Structure of \u201cIki\u201d (\u201cIki\u201d no\nk\u014dz\u014d) by Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d (1888\u20131941) is arguably\nthe most significant work in Japanese aesthetics from the twentieth\ncentury\u2014and certainly one of the shortest. Kuki wrote the first\ndraft in 1926 while living in Paris, toward the end of a seven-year\nstay in Europe, and published the book shortly after returning to\nJapan in 1929. It\u2019s a phenomenological and hermeneutic study of\na phenomenon, iki, that was central to Japanese aesthetic\nlife during the previous two or three hundred years and derived from\nforms of erotic relations between men and geisha in the pleasure\nquarters of the big cities. Kuki remarks that although the French\nterms chic, coquet, and raffin\u00e9\nshare connotations with the term iki, no European word is\ncapable of translating the richness of its\nmeanings\u2014unsurprisingly, since it emerged from a particular\ncultural context and Kuki is concerned to grasp the \u201cliving\nform\u201d of the phenomenon as experienced. Kuki mentions the French\nesprit and the German Sehnsucht as terms that are\nsimilarly untranslatable, for similar reasons of cultural embeddedness\n(Nara, 15\u201316).\n\nKuki distinguishes two further \u201cmoments\u201d of iki\nin addition to its basis in seductiveness or coquetry\n(bitai): \u201cbrave composure\u201d (ikiji) and\n\u201cresignation\u201d (akirame). Insofar as iki\nas seductiveness is concerned \u201cto maintain a dualistic\nrelationship, protecting the possibility as\npossibility\u201d\u2014an allusion to Heidegger\u2019s existential\nconception of death as ultimate possibility\u2014it already embraces\nimpermanence and mortality. The first sense in which iki preserves the\npossibility as possibility, and thus maintains a dualistic\nrelationship, is that the act of sexual union is not consummated (or\nat least postponed). This preservation of possibility is further\nenhanced by brave composure, which for Kuki is exemplified in the\nattitude toward death (his own and others\u2019) on the part of the\nsamurai warrior and his way of living (bushid\u014d). It is\nenhanced too by the moment of resignation, which Kuki understands as\nthe Buddhist attitude of non-attachment to a world of impermanence.\nAll together they enable a kind of aesthetic \u201cplay\u201d,\nthanks to a (phenomenological) \u201cbracketing\u201d of the\nconcerns of everyday life (Nara, 18\u201323).\n\nAfter positioning the phenomenon of iki among a variety of\nother aesthetic feelings such as sweet (amami) versus\nastringent (shibumi), flashy (hade) versus quiet\n(jimi), and crude (gehin) versus refined\n(j\u014dhin), Kuki goes on to examine the objective\nexpressions of the phenomenon, which are either \u201cnatural\u201d\nor \u201cartistic\u201d (Nara, 24\u201334). In nature, willow trees\nand slow, steady rain exemplify iki; in the human body a\nslight relaxation, a voice of medium rather than high pitch, a face\nthat is long rather than round, a certain tension and relaxation\ntogether of the eyes, mouth, and cheeks, the hand curved or slightly\nbent back. Also iki is the wearing of thin fabric, makeup\nthinly applied, hair styled not too formally, with the aid of water\nrather than oil, and a d\u00e9colletage designed to call\nattention to the nape of the neck laid bare (Nara, 35\u201339).\n\nIn the \u201cfree art\u201d of design, parallel lines, and\nespecially vertical stripes, are expressive of iki: almost\nall the other beautiful patterns developed by Japanese fabric arts,\nsince they often involve curved lines, are un-iki. The only\ncolors that embody iki are certain grays, browns, and blues.\nIn architecture the small (four-and-a-half mat) Zen teahouse is a\nparadigm of iki, especially insofar as it initiates an\ninterplay between wood and bamboo. Lighting must be subdued: indirect\ndaylight or else the kind of illumination provided by a paper lantern.\nThe scales, melodies, and rhythms of various kinds of music are\ncorrespondingly iki, insofar as (alluding to Goethe,\nSchelling, and Schopenhauer)\u201cArchitecture is frozen music, and\nmusic is flowing architecture\u201d (Nara, 41\u201351).\n\nIn his conclusion, Kuki asks whether various nineteenth-century and\ncontemporary European arts might exemplify iki and decides\nprobably not exactly, though he allows that various aspects of\nBaudelaire\u2019s poetry and aesthetics come very close (with the\ndifference that dandyism is a male prerogative whereas iki is\nassociated with both sexes). During his seven years in Germany and\nFrance he listened to lectures and seminars by, and conversed with,\nsuch figures as Heinrich Rickert, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger,\nHenri Bergson, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Kuki thereby developed a\nsophisticated understanding of European philosophy and aesthetics, and\nwas concerned after his return to Japan to apply methods he had\nlearned to a Japanese aesthetic phenomenon. He didn\u2019t therefore\naspire to any kind of universal aesthetics\u2014since iki is\nrooted in the culture of a particular ethnic group. Yet because the\nJapanese at that time, under geopolitical pressure to modernise more\nefficiently, were losing touch with their own traditions, Kuki took it\nas one of his tasks to celebrate the aesthetic values of the past\n(Nara, 58\u201360).\n\nHe has unfortunately been excoriated on these grounds as an\nultranationalist and even a fascist, notably by Leslie Pincus in her\nbook Authenticating Culture in Imperial Japan: Kuki\nSh\u016bz\u014d and the Rise of National Aesthetics, and this\ndeters some people from reading him. But while Pincus\u2019s book\nprovides a good deal of helpful historical background of the milieu in\nwhich Kuki was working in Japan, her claims that he was a fascist are\ngroundless (see Parkes 1997, 2007). An unprejudiced reading of The\nStructure of Iki reveals no fascist tendencies whatsoever, and\nthe nationalist themes are innocuous, simply calling for a remembering\nof what is valuable in the Japanese tradition and likely to be lost\nbeneath the waves of modernization\u2014in a world where connections\nwith the past were withering and Japan was warding off the\ncolonization of East and South Asia by the Western powers.\n\nKuki is a fascinating thinker, and The Structure of Iki,\nwhile occasionally tortuous because of its commitment to a strictly\nEuropean methodology, illuminates some fascinating aspects of the\nJapanese aesthetic tradition while at the same time engaging the\ndeepest levels of experience anywhere.\n9. Kire: Cutting\n\nA distinctive notion in Japanese aesthetic discourse is that of the\n\u201ccut\u201d (kire) or, \u201ccut-continuity\u201d\n(kire-tsuzuki). The \u201ccut\u201d is a basic trope in the\nRinzai School of Zen Buddhism, especially as exemplified in the\nteachings of the Zen master Hakuin (1686\u20131769). For Hakuin the\naim of \u201cseeing into one\u2019s own nature\u201d can only be\nrealized if one has \u201ccut off the root of life\u201d: \u201cYou\nmust be prepared to let go your hold when hanging from a sheer\nprecipice, to die and return again to life\u201d (Hakuin,\n133\u201335). The cut appears as a fundamental feature in the\ndistinctively Japanese art of flower arrangement called\nikebana. The term means literally \u201cmaking flowers\nlive\u201d\u2014a strange name, on first impression at least, for an\nart that begins by initiating their death. There is an exquisite essay\nby Nishitani Keiji on this marvelous art, in which organic life is cut\noff precisely in order to let the true nature of the flower to come to\nthe fore (Nishitani, 23\u20137). There is something curiously\ndeceptive, from the Buddhist viewpoint of the impermanence of all\nthings, about plants, which, lacking locomotion and by sinking roots\ninto the earth, assume an appearance of being especially \u201cat\nhome\u201d wherever they are. In severing the flowers from their\nroots, Nishitani suggests, and placing them in an alcove (itself cut\noff from direct light, as Tanizaki remarks), one is letting them show\nthemselves as they truly are: as absolutely rootless as every other\nbeing in this world of radical impermanence.\n\nThe notion of cut-continuation is exemplified in the highly stylized\ngait of the actors in the N\u014d drama. The actor slides the foot\nalong the floor with the toes raised, and then \u201ccuts\u201d off\nthe movement by quickly lowering the toes to the floor\u2014and\nbeginning at that precise moment the sliding movement along the floor\nwith the other foot. This stylization of the natural human walk draws\nattention to the episodic nature of life, which is also reflected in\nthe pause between every exhalation of air from the lungs and the next\ninhalation. Through attending to the breath in zen meditation one\nbecomes aware that the pause between exhalation and inhalation is\ndifferent\u2014more of a cut\u2014from that between inhalation and\nexhalation. This reflects the possibility of life\u2019s being cut\noff at any moment: the one exhalation that isn\u2019t followed by an\ninhalation, known as \u201cbreathing one\u2019s last.\u201d\n\nCutting also appears in the \u201ccut-syllable\u201d\n(kireji) in the art of haiku poetry, which cuts off\none image from\u2014at the same time as it links it to\u2014the\nnext. There is a famous cut-syllable, ya, at the end of the\nfirst line of the best known haiku by Bash\u014d, the most famous\nhaiku poet:\n\n\n\n\nFuruike ya\n\nKawazu tobikomu\n\nMizu no oto.\nAh, an ancient pond\u2014\n  \n  Suddenly a frog jumps in!\n  \n  The sound of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most distinctively Japanese style of garden, the \u201cdry\nlandscape\u201d (karesansui) garden, owes its existence to\nthe landscape\u2019s being \u201ccut off\u201d from the natural\nworld beyond its borders. The epitome of this style is the rock garden\nat Ry\u014danji in Kyoto, where fifteen \u201cmountain\u201d-shaped\nrocks are set in beds of moss in a rectangular \u201csea\u201d of\nwhite gravel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarger Photographs of the Dry Landscape Garden at Ry\u014danji\n\n\n\n(The Japanese word for landscape, sansui, means literally\n\u201cmountains waters\u201d: see Berthier 2000.) At Ry\u014danji\nthe rock garden is cut off from the outside by a splendid wall that is\nnevertheless low enough to permit a view of the natural surroundings.\nThis cut, which is in a way doubled by the angled roof that runs along\nthe top of the wall and seems to cut it off, is most evident in the\ncontrast between movement and stillness. Above and beyond the wall\nthere is nature in movement: branches wave and sway, clouds float by,\nand the occasional bird flies past. But unless rain or snow is\nfalling, or a stray leaf is blown across, the only movement visible\nwithin the garden is shadowed or illusory, as the sun or moon casts\nslow-moving shadows of tree branches on the motionless gravel.\n\nThe garden is cut off on the near side too, by a border of pebbles\n(larger, darker, and more rounded than the pieces of gravel) that runs\nalong the east and north edges. There is a striking contrast between\nthe severe rectangularity of the garden\u2019s borders and the\nirregular natural forms of the rocks within them. The expanse of\ngravel is also cut through by the upthrust of the rocks from below:\nearth energies mounting and peaking in irruptions of stone. Each group\nof rocks is cut off from the others by the expanse of gravel, and the\nseparation is enhanced by the \u201cripple\u201d patterns in the\nraking that surrounds each group (and some individual rocks). And yet\nthe overall effect of these cuttings is actually to intensify the\ninvisible lines of connection among the rocks, whose interrelations\nexemplify the fundamental Buddhist insight of \u201cdependent\nco-arising\u201d (engi).\n\nThe rock garden also embodies the central Buddhist insight of\nimpermanence. Insofar as its being cut off from the surrounding nature\nhas the effect of drying up its organic life, which then no longer\ndecays in the usual manner. Being dried up (the kare of\nkaresansui means \u201cwithered\u201d), the mountains and\nwaters of the garden at Ry\u014danji at first appear less temporary\nthan their counterparts outside, which manifest the cyclical changes\nthat organic life is heir to. But just as plants look deceptively\npermanent thanks to their being rooted in the earth, so the rocks of\nthe dry landscape garden give a misleading impression of permanence,\nespecially when one revisits them over a period of years. As\nparticipants in (what Thoreau called) \u201cthe great central\nlife\u201d of the earth, rocks have a life that unfolds in time\nsequences that are quite different from ours\u2014and yet also\nsubject to the impermanence that conditions all things.\n10. Ozu Yasujir\u014d: Cinematic Cuts\n\nThe garden at Ry\u014danji makes a brief but significant appearance in\none of the classics of Japanese cinema, Ozu Yasujir\u014d\u2019s\nLate Spring (1949). It comes right after one of the\nfilm\u2019s most famous images: a vase standing on a tatami mat in\nfront of a window on which silhouettes of bamboo are projected. The\nscene in question consists of eight shots, seven of which show the\nRy\u014danji rocks (of which there are fifteen in total), and which\nare separated and joined by seven cuts. (Ozu hardly ever uses any\nother transition than the cut, such as the wipe.) After two shots of\nrocks in the garden, the camera angle reverses and we see the main\nprotagonist with his friend\u2014they are both fathers of\ndaughters\u2014sitting on the wooden platform with the tops of two\nrocks occupying the lower part of the frame. Two rocks and two\nfathers. Cut to a close-up of the fathers from their left side, with\nno rocks in view. In their dark suits, and seated in the classic Ozu\n\u201coverlapping triangles\u201d configuration, leaning forward\ntoward the garden with their arms around knees drawn up toward their\nchins, they resemble two rocks. They talk about how they raise\nchildren who then go off to live their own lives. As they invoke such\nmanifestations of impermanence, they remain motionless except for the\noccasional nod or turn of the head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarged Sequence of Stills from Late Spring\n\n\n\nIn their brief conversation by the edge of the garden, the two fathers\ndo little more than exchange platitudes about family life\u2014and\nyet the scene is a profoundly moving expression of the human\ncondition. It gains this effect from the assimilation of the figures\nof the two men to rocks, which seems to affirm the persistence of\ncycles of impermanence. These images of assimilation capture one of\nthe central ideas behind the dry landscape garden: that of the\ncontinuum between human consciousness and stone, which is also\nunderstandable as the kinship of awareness with its original\nbasis.\n\nThe opening shots of Tokyo Story (1953), which some consider\nOzu\u2019s greatest film, are also exemplary with respect to the\ncutting. The first shot shows a shrine sculpture to the left of center\nand behind it an estuary with a boat chugging along to the right, in\nthe direction of a gradual rise of hills on the horizon. After ten\nseconds, just as the boat is about to disappear beyond the\nframe\u2014there is a cut to the pavement on the side of a street. A\ncart now occupies the left foreground of the frame, and beside it\nstand two large bottles (Ozu\u2019s signature shapes). Eight small\nchildren in school uniform walk away from the camera to the right.\nContinuity is provided by a parallel between the river and horizon of\nthe first scene and the horizontal lines of the pavement and houses in\nthe second, as well as by the movement toward the right. Also aurally\nby the continuing sound of the boat\u2019s putt-putting. A ninth\nchild appears and as he passes the bottles and reaches the center of\nthe frame\u2014there is a cut to a shot over the roofs of houses of a\ntrain traveling to the right, with behind it the buildings of a shrine\nor temple, and then hills behind those. The putting sound of the boat\ncontinues before being drowned out by the sound of the train, and the\nalmost horizontal line of the train\u2019s passage continue to be\ncongruent with those of the street, descending gradually to the right.\nSmoke issues from two chimneys at left and center, the scene lasting\nfifteen seconds.\n\nAs the end of the train reaches the center of the frame\u2014the\nsound continues but there is a cut to a closer shot of the train from\nthe hill side, so that it is now moving up along a diagonal to the\nleft. Behind the houses on the other side of the train is the estuary\nagain. As the train\u2019s whistle blows\u2014there is a cut to a\nshrine surrounded by pine trees and statuary standing on an embankment\nwith the estuary in the background on the far left. Continuity is\nprovided by a chimney in the foreground that spouts smoke as the\ntrain\u2019s steam whistle continues. The main line has reverted to a\nhorizontal line rising toward the right. After six seconds, the\nshortest scene so far\u2014there is a cut to a grandfather and\ngrandmother sitting on the tatami matting of their home in the\nvillage, facing toward the right. The grandfather, consulting a\ntimetable, says, \u201cWe\u2019ll pass Osaka at around 6:00 this\nevening,\u201d referring to a train trip they are just about to take\nto Tokyo, which will initiate the film\u2019s main action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarged Sequence of Stills from Tokyo Story\n\n\n\nFor each cut Ozu has arranged for at least one formal element to\nprovide continuity (kire-tsuzuki) between the adjacent\nscenes. There are of course other directors capable of consummate\ncuts, but a study of Ozu\u2019s show them to constitute what may be\n\u201cthe kindest cut of all\u201d in world cinema.\n",
