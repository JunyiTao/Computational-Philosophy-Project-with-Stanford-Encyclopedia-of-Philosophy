Representation-As\n\nIn Goodman\u2019s (1976) account of aesthetic representation the idea\nis that a work of art does not just denote its subject, but moreover\nit represents it as being thus or so (see the SEP entry on\n Goodman\u2019s aesthetics\n for further discussion). Elgin (2010) further developed this account\nand, crucially, suggested that it also applies to scientific\nrepresentations. We first discuss Goodman and Elgin\u2019s notion of\nrepresentation-as and then consider a recent extension of their\nframework.\n",
