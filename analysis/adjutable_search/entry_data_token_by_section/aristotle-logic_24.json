    "main_text": "Definitions || The Categories\n7.3 The Categories\n\nThe notion of essential predication is connected to what are\ntraditionally called the categories\n(kat\u00eagoriai). In a word, Aristotle is famous for having\nheld a \u201cdoctrine of categories\u201d. Just what that doctrine\nwas, and indeed just what a category is, are considerably more vexing\nquestions. They also quickly take us outside his logic and into his\nmetaphysics. Here, I will try to give a very general overview,\nbeginning with the somewhat simpler question \u201cWhat categories\nare there?\u201d\n\nWe can answer this question by listing the categories. Here are two\npassages containing such lists:\n\nWe should distinguish the kinds of predication (ta gen\u00ea\nt\u00f4n kat\u00eagori\u00f4n) in which the four predications\nmentioned are found. These are ten in number: what-it-is, quantity,\nquality, relative, where, when, being-in-a-position, having, doing,\nundergoing. An accident, a genus, a peculiar property and a definition\nwill always be in one of these categories. (Topics I.9,\n103b20\u201325)\n\n\nOf things said without any combination, each signifies either\nsubstance or quantity or quality or a relative or where or when or\nbeing-in-a-position or having or doing or undergoing. To give a rough\nidea, examples of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four-foot,\nfive-foot; of quality: white, literate; of a relative: double, half,\nlarger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when:\nyesterday, last year; of being-in-a-position: is-lying, is-sitting; of\nhaving: has-shoes-on, has-armor-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of\nundergoing: being-cut, being-burned. (Categories 4,\n1b25\u20132a4, tr. Ackrill, slightly modified)\n\n\nThese two passages give ten-item lists, identical except for their\nfirst members. What are they lists \\(of\\)? Here are three ways they\nmight be interpreted:\n\nThe word \u201ccategory\u201d (kat\u00eagoria) means\n\u201cpredication\u201d. Aristotle holds that predications and\npredicates can be grouped into several largest \u201ckinds of\npredication\u201d (gen\u00ea t\u00f4n\nkat\u00eagori\u00f4n). He refers to this classification\nfrequently, often calling the \u201ckinds of predication\u201d\nsimply \u201cthe predications\u201d, and this (by way of Latin)\nleads to our word \u201ccategory\u201d.\n\nFirst, the categories may be kinds of predicate:\npredicates (or, more precisely, predicate expressions) can be divided\ninto ten separate classes, with each expression belonging to just one\nclass. This comports well with the root meaning of the word\nkat\u00eagoria (\u201cpredication\u201d). On this\ninterpretation, the categories arise out of considering the most\ngeneral types of question that can be asked about something:\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d; \u201cHow much is\nit?\u201d; \u201cWhat sort is it?\u201d;\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d; \u201cWhat is it\ndoing?\u201d Answers appropriate to one of these questions\nare nonsensical in response to another (\u201cWhen is it?\u201d\n\u201cA horse\u201d). Thus, the categories may rule out certain\nkinds of question as ill-formed or confused. This plays an important\nrole in Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\nSecond, the categories may be seen as classifications of\npredications, that is, kinds of relation that may hold\nbetween the predicate and the subject of a predication. To say of\nSocrates that he is human is to say what he \\(is\\), whereas to say\nthat he is literate is not to say what he is but rather to give a\nquality that he has. For Aristotle, the relation of predicate\nto subject in these two sentences is quite different (in this respect\nhe differs both from Plato and from modern logicians). The categories\nmay be interpreted as ten different ways in which a predicate may be\nrelated to its subject. This last division has importance for\nAristotle\u2019s logic as well as his metaphysics.\nThird, the categories may be seen as kinds of entity, as\nhighest genera or kinds of thing that are. A given thing can be\nclassified under a series of progressively wider genera: Socrates is a\nhuman, a mammal, an animal, a living being. The categories are the\nhighest such genera. Each falls under no other genus, and each is\ncompletely separate from the others. This distinction is of critical\nimportance to Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\n\n\nWhich of these interpretations fits best with the two passages above?\nThe answer appears to be different in the two cases. This is most\nevident if we take note of point in which they differ: the\nCategories lists substance (ousia)\nin first place, while the Topics list\nwhat-it-is (ti esti). A substance, for\nAristotle, is a type of entity, suggesting that the\nCategories list is a list of types of entity.\n\nOn the other hand, the expression \u201cwhat-it-is\u201d suggests\nmost strongly a type of predication. Indeed, the Topics\nconfirms this by telling us that we can \u201csay what it is\u201d\nof an entity falling under any of the categories:\n\nan expression signifying what-it-is will sometimes signify a\nsubstance, sometimes a quantity, sometimes a quality, and sometimes\none of the other categories.\n\n\nAs Aristotle explains, if I say that Socrates is a man, then I have\nsaid what Socrates is and signified a substance; if I say that white\nis a color, then I have said what white is and signified a quality; if\nI say that some length is a foot long, then I have said what it is and\nsignified a quantity; and so on for the other categories. What-it-is,\nthen, here designates a kind of predication, not a kind of entity.\n\nThis might lead us to conclude that the categories in the\nTopics are only to be interpreted as kinds of predicate or\npredication, those in the Categories as kinds of being. Even\nso, we would still want to ask what the relationship is between these\ntwo nearly-identical lists of terms, given these distinct\ninterpretations. However, the situation is much more complicated.\nFirst, there are dozens of other passages in which the categories\nappear. Nowhere else do we find a list of ten, but we do find shorter\nlists containing eight, or six, or five, or four of them (with\nsubstance/what-it-is, quality, quantity, and relative the most\ncommon). Aristotle describes what these lists are lists of in\ndifferent ways: they tell us \u201chow being is divided\u201d, or\n\u201chow many ways being is said\u201d, or \u201cthe figures of\npredication\u201d (ta sch\u00eamata t\u00eas kat\u00eagorias). The\ndesignation of the first category also varies: we find not only\n\u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cwhat it is\u201d but also the\nexpressions \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthe this\u201d (tode\nti, to tode, to ti). These latter expressions\nare closely associated with, but not synonymous with, substance. He\neven combines the latter with \u201cwhat-it-is\u201d\n(Metaphysics Z 1, 1028a10: \u201c\u2026 one sense\nsignifies what it is and the this, one signifies quality\n\u2026\u201d).\n\nMoreover, substances are for Aristotle fundamental for predication as\nwell as metaphysically fundamental. He tells us that everything that\nexists exists because substances exist: if there were no substances,\nthere would not be anything else. He also conceives of predication as\nreflecting a metaphysical relationship (or perhaps more than one,\ndepending on the type of predication). The sentence \u201cSocrates is\npale\u201d gets its truth from a state of affairs consisting of a\nsubstance (Socrates) and a quality (whiteness) which is in that\nsubstance. At this point we have gone far outside the realm of\nAristotle\u2019s logic into his metaphysics, the fundamental question\nof which, according to Aristotle, is \u201cWhat is a\nsubstance?\u201d. (For further discussion of this topic, see the\nentry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n and the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics,\n (Section 2).\n\nSee Frede 1981, Ebert 1985 for additional discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s lists of categories.\n\nFor convenience of reference, I include a table of the categories,\nalong with Aristotle\u2019s examples and the traditional names often\nused for them. For reasons explained above, I have treated the first\nitem in the list quite differently, since an example of a substance\nand an example of a what-it-is are necessarily (as one might put it)\nin different categories.\n\n\n\nTraditional\u00a0name\nLiterally\nGreek\nExamples \n\nSubstance\nsubstance\n\n\u201cthis\u201d\n\nwhat-it-is\nousia\n\ntode ti\n\nti esti\nman, horse\n\nSocrates\n\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d \n\nQuantity\nHow much\nposon\nfour-foot, five-foot \n\nQuality\nWhat sort\npoion\nwhite, literate \n\nRelation\nrelated to what\npros ti\ndouble, half, greater \n\nLocation\nWhere\npou\nin the Lyceum, in the marketplace \n\nTime\nwhen\npote\nyesterday, last year \n\nPosition\nbeing situated\nkeisthai\nlies, sits \n\nHabit\nhaving, possession\nechein\nis shod, is armed \n\nAction\ndoing\npoiein\ncuts, burns \n\nPassion\nundergoing\npaschein\nis cut, is burned  \n\n",
