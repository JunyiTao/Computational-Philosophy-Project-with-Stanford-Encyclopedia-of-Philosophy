    "main_text": "Ontological Status of Schemas\n4. Schemas in the History of Logic\n\nThe Greek word \u2018schema\u2019; was used in Plato\u2019s Academy\nfor \u201c[geometric] figure\u201d and in Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum\nfor \u201c[syllogistic] figure\u201d. Although Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic figures or \u201cschemata\u201d were not schemas in the\nmodern sense, Aristotle\u2019s moods were. For example, the\ntemplate-text of the mood BARBARA is \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& P \\textrm{ belongs-to-every }M.\\\\\n& M \\textrm{ belongs-to-every }S.\\\\\\hline\n& P \\textrm{ belongs-to-every }S.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe associated side condition is that (1) both occurrences of\n\u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 are to be filled with occurrences of one and the\nsame common noun, (2) both occurrences of \u2018\\(M\\)\u2019 are to\nbe filled with occurrences of one and the same common noun other than\nthe one used for \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019, (3) both occurrences of\n\u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 are to be filled with occurrences of one and the\nsame common noun other than the ones used for \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(M\\)\u2019, and that (4) the expression\n\u2018belongs-to-every\u2019 is taken to express universal\naffirmative predication as in the Prior analytics.  The rules\nof the Stoic propositional logic have been taken to be schemas.\n\nIt is hard to date self-conscious use of the word\n\u2018schema\u2019; in the modern sense. Russell\u2019s\nIntroduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919) uses it\ncasually to describe propositional functions: \n\n\nA propositional function \u2026 may be taken to be a mere schema, a\nmere shell, an empty receptacle for meaning, not something already\nsignificant. (1919: 157) \n\n\nBut propositional functions are not syntactic schemas in the modern\nsense. Tarski\u2019s 1933 truth-definition paper (Tarski 1933/1983:\n157, 160, 172) was one of the first prominent publications to use the\nword \u2018scheme\u2019 in a sense close to that of this article\n(Tarski 1933/1983: 155, 156). Tarski also uses the word\n\u2018schema\u2019, and its plural \u2018schemata\u2019, in the\npre-World-War II period (1983: 63\u201364, 114, 310, 386, 423).\n\nEarly twentieth-century formalizations of logic used what were called\n\u201csubstitution rules\u201d with finite set of axioms instead of\nschemata that specified infinitely many axioms. These\n\u201csubstitution rules\u201d were not the familiar rules for\n\u201csubstituting equals for equals\u201d; rather they were closer\nto what are called instantiation rules today. The intuitive motivation\nfor \u201csubstitution rules\u201d was very simple but the syntactic\ndetails for implementing them were \u201cintolerably\ncomplex\u201d\u2014to use the words of Paul Rosenbloom (1950: 109).\nIn fact several first-rate logicians were led to make embarrassing\nerrors, as Rosenbloom documents in the place just cited. Church (1956:\n158) credits von Neumann with \u201cthe device of using axiom\nschemata\u201d, which rendered the (notoriously difficult to state)\nsubstitution rule unnecessary.\n\nAs Church has emphasized (e.g., 1956: 59), metamathematical treatment\nof schemas requires use of formalized or logically perfect languages\nand an axiomatized theory of strings as found for the first time in\nTarski\u2019s 1933 truth-definition paper (1933/1983: 152\u2013256).\nFor more on the history, philosophy, and mathematics of this important\nbut somewhat neglected field, see Corcoran et al. 1974;\nCorcoran 2006).\n",
