    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Skepticism || Relations Among the Arguments\n4. Pyrrhonian Moral Skepticism\n\n\nAlthough the arguments for moral skepticism are hard to refute, most\npeople reject their conclusion. This makes it natural to seek some\ncompromise. Various compromises have been proposed, but here I will\nfocus on one that extends the Pyrrhonian tradition (cf. DePaul 2009).\n\n\nThis neo-Pyrrhonian position can be explained in terms of contrast\nclasses, which should be familiar from shopping: Are jumbo shrimp\nlarge? An answer of \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d would be too\nsimple. Jumbo shrimp are large for shrimp, but they are not large for\nedible crustaceans. Analogously, someone can be justified in believing\na claim out of one contrast class, even if the same person is not\njustified in believing the same claim out of a different contrast\nclass. For example, suppose a father sees an animal in a zoo and\nbelieves it to be a zebra. If the father has adequate evidence that\nthe animal is not a lion or a horse, then the father can be justified\nin believing that it is a zebra out of the contrast class {lion,\nhorse, zebra}. Nonetheless, the father still might not have any\nevidence that the animal is not a mule painted to look just like a\nzebra. Then the father is not justified in believing that the animal\nis a zebra out of the contrast class {lion, horse, zebra, painted\nmule}.\n\n\nThe same situation arises with moral beliefs. A father might be\njustified in believing that he should tell his children the truth\nrather than lying to them, even if the father is not justified in\nbelieving that he should tell his children the truth as opposed to\nkeeping quiet. Or someone might be justified in favoring Kantian moral\ntheory over act-utilitarianism, because of counterexamples to\nact-utilitarianism, without being justified on that basis in favoring\nKantian moral theory over rule-utilitarianism, if that alternative is\nnot subject to the same counterexamples.\n\n\nMore generally, we can distinguish two contrast classes:\n\n\nThe extreme contrast class for a moral belief that\np includes every moral claim that is contrary to p,\nincluding moral nihilism.\n\n\nThe modest contrast class for a moral belief includes all and only those\ncontrary moral beliefs that most people would take seriously in an\nordinary discussion.\n\n\n\nSince moral nihilism conflicts with many commonsense moral beliefs, most people do not take moral nihilism seriously in ordinary discussions, so the modest contrast class does not include moral\nnihilism.  Thus, anyone who can rule out all other members of the\nmodest contrast class but cannot rule out moral nihilism is justified\nin believing the moral claim out of the modest contrast class but not\nout of the extreme contrast class.\n\n\nThese classes enable us to distinguish two versions of moral\nskepticism:\n\n\nSkepticism about modestly justified moral belief is the claim\nthat nobody is ever justified out of the modest contrast\nclass in holding any substantive moral belief.\n\nSkepticism about extremely justified moral belief is the\nclaim that nobody is ever justified out of the extreme contrast class\nin holding any substantive moral belief.\n\n\n\nThe latter but not the former follows if nobody can ever rule out\nmoral nihilism, but some believers sometimes can rule out all other\nmembers of the modest contrast class.\n\n\nCritics will ask, \u201cIf someone is justified out of the modest contrast\nclass but not out of the extreme contrast class, is this believer just\nplain justified (period or without qualification)?\u201d That, of course,\ndepends on what it means to say that a believer is justified (without\nqualification). On one plausible account, to say that a believer is\njustified (without qualification) is to say that the believer is\njustified out of the relevant contrast class. But which\ncontrast class is relevant when?\n\n\nContextualists say that the modest contrast class is relevant in\neveryday contexts, such as hospital ethics committees, where it would\nbe seen as a distraction to discuss moral nihilism. Nonetheless, the\nextreme contrast class is said to be relevant in philosophical\ncontexts, such as philosophy classes where moral nihilism is taken\nseriously. This allows contextualists to hold that a doctor in a\nhospital ethics committee is justified in believing a moral claim that\na philosophy student with the same evidence would not be justified in\nbelieving.\n\n\nProblems arise when contexts cross. Consider a philosophy student who\nsays that the doctor on the ethics committee is not justified in\nbelieving the moral claim. Is the student\u2019s contrast class (with moral\nnihilism) or the doctor\u2019s contrast class (without moral nihilism)\nreally relevant to the student\u2019s judgment about the doctor\u2019s belief?\nAnd what if the doctor says that the student really is justified while\nin the philosophy class? When epistemic assessments cross contexts in\nsuch ways, sometimes the believer\u2019s context seems relevant, but\nsometimes the assessor\u2019s context seems relevant, so it is hard to see\nany basis for claiming that either context or either contrast class\nreally is the relevant one for assessing whether the believer really\nis justified (without qualification).\n\n\nSuch paradoxes lead some \u2018classy\u2019 Pyrrhonian moral\nskeptics to deny that any contrast class is ever really relevant. This\ndenial implies that it is never either true or false that a believer\nis justified (without qualification), if such claims presuppose that\nsome contrast class is really relevant. Alternatively, classy\nPyrrhonian moral skeptics might suspend belief about whether any\ncontrast class is ever really relevant or not. Such Pyrrhonian moral\nskeptics refuse to take any position either way on whether any\nbeliever is justified (without qualification), although they can still\ntalk about whether someone is justified in believing a moral claim out\nof a specified contrast class. Pyrrhonian moral skeptics can then (i)\naccept skepticism about extremely justified moral belief but (ii) deny\nskepticism about modestly justified moral belief and (iii) refuse to\neither assert or deny (dogmatic) skepticism about any moral belief\nbeing justified (without qualification). (See Sinnott-Armstrong 2006,\nchap. 6.)\n\n\nWhether or not this view is finally defensible, the point here is just\nthat such a Pyrrhonian compromise is available and attractive to those\nwho want to avoid dogmatic moral skepticism but see no way to\nrefute it. There are also other possible compromises that combine\ndifferent strands in moral skepticism. That is what makes it so\nfascinating to study this important group of views.\n",
