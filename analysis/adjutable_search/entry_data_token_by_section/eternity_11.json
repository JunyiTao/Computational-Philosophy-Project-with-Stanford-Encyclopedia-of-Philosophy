    "main_text": "Arguments against Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Divine Personhood\n5.3 Arguments from Divine Personhood\n\nSuppose that whatever is a person does at least some of the following:\nremembering, anticipating, reflecting, deliberating, deciding,\nintending, and acting intentionally. If timelessness precludes one\nfrom doing any of these, then being timeless is incompatible with\nbeing a person. Since God is a person, God is not timeless.\n\nBut is it the case that being a person requires one to do at least\nsome of the above? Instead one might hold that at most, it requires\none to be capable of doing at least some of the above. And\nperhaps a timeless God is capable of doing some of the above, even if\nGod does not do them.\n\nAlternatively, one might question the grounds for thinking that these\nactivities tend to be precluded by timelessness. It is true that they\nall seem to involve change, namely a change in one\u2019s mental\nstates. But defenders of timelessness may think we should leave room\nin our conceptual scheme for a timeless, changeless version of each of\nthese activities (Craig 2009; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch. 2).\n",
