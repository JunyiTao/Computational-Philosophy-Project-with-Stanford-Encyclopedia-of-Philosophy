    "main_text": "The Logic(s) of Impossible Worlds || Nonadjunctive and Nonprime Impossible Worlds\n5.2 Nonadjunctive and Nonprime Impossible Worlds\n\nIn 1980, Nicholas Rescher and Robert Brandom published The Logic\nof Inconsistency. A Study in Non-Standard Possible-Worlds Semantics\nand Ontology. They introduced a modal semantics including,\nbesides ordinary possible worlds (taken as maximally consistent\ncollections of states of affairs), also non-standard worlds that are\nlocally inconsistent (such that, for some \\(A\\), both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\nA\\) hold at them), and incomplete (such that for some \\(A\\), neither\n\\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold at them). These are obtained\ncombinatorially, via two recursive operations having standard worlds\nas their base, and called schematization \\((\\cap)\\) and\nsuperposition \\((\\cup)\\). Given two worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), a schematic world \\(w_1 \\cap w_2\\) is one at which all and\nonly the states of affairs obtain, which obtain both at \\(w_1\\) and at\n\\(w_2\\). Dually, a \u201csuperposed\u201d or inconsistent world\n\\(w_1 \\cup w_2\\) is one at which all and only the states of affairs\nobtain, which obtain at \\(w_1\\) or at \\(w_2\\). Rescher and\nBrandom\u2019s inconsistent-superposed worlds are, therefore,\nimpossible worlds of the fourth kind: Contradiction Realizers making\nboth \\(A\\) and its negation true, for some \\(A\\) (just superpose, for\ninstance, a possible world, \\(w_1\\), at which I am 1.70m tall, and\nanother possible world, \\(w_2\\), at which I am 1.90m tall).\n\nThe assignment of truth values at such worlds is not (obviously)\ncompositional with respect to conjunction. The standard semantic\nclause interprets the \u2018\\(\\wedge\\)\u2019 symbol using our world\n\u2018and\u2019:\n\n(S\\(\\wedge\\))  \\(v_w (A\n\\wedge B) = 1\\) if and only if \\(v_w (A) = 1\\) and \\(v_w (B) = 1\\)\n\n\n\nBut the right-to-left direction will have to go, if \\(w\\) is one of\nRescher and Brandom\u2019s impossible worlds. These worlds are\nnonadjunctive: they allow two sentences to be true even\nthough their conjunction is not true. (Adjunction is the\nprinciple that the truth of a conjunction follows from the truth of\nits conjuncts.) Rescher and Brandom\u2019s worlds can also be\nnonprime: a disjunction may hold at them even though neither\ndisjunct does. They may also make some \\(A\\) and its negation \\(\\neg\nA\\) both true. But the corresponding conjunction, \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\),\ndoesn\u2019t follow. These impossible worlds retain a certain amount\nof logical structure. They are closed under any classically valid,\nessentially single-premised inference (such as Disjunction\nIntroduction); but they are not closed under essentially\nmultiple-premised inferences (such as Adjunction).\n\nRescher and Brandom\u2019s approach falls in the nonadjunctive\ntradition (see Berto 2007, Chapter 6) of\n paraconsistent logics:\n a tradition started by Jaskowksi\u2019s discussive logic\n\\(\\mathbf{D}_2\\) (also labeled as \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) in the literature,\nJa\u015bkowski 1948), and based on the idea of rejecting or limiting\nthe Adjunction principle. Such an approach has been revived in works\nby Hyde (1997), and Varzi (1997 and 2004).\n",
