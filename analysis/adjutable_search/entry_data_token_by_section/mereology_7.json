    "main_text": "Decomposition Principles || Complementation\n3.3 Complementation\n\nThere is a way of expressing the supplementation intuition that is\neven stronger than (P.5). It corresponds to the following thesis,\nwhich differs from (P.5) in the consequent:\n\n\n(P.6)\nComplementation[15]\n\n\u00acPyx \u2192\n\u2203z\u2200w(Pwz \u2194 (Pwy\n\u2227\u00a0\u00ac Owx)).  \n\n\nThis says that if y is not part of x, there exists\nsomething that comprises exactly those parts of y that are\ndisjoint from x\u2014something we may call the\ndifference or relative complement between y\nand x. It is easily checked that this principle implies\n(P.5). On the other hand, the diagram in Figure 5 shows that the\nconverse does not hold: there are two parts of y in this\ndiagram that do not overlap x, namely z and\nw, but there is nothing that consists exactly of such parts,\nso we have a model of (P.5) in which (P.6) fails.\n\n\nFigure 5. A strongly supplemented model violating\nComplementation.\n\n\nAny misgivings about (P.5) may of course be raised against (P.6). But\nwhat if we agree with the above arguments in support of (P.5)? Do they\nalso give us reasons to accept the stronger principle (P.6)? The\nanswer is in the negative. Plausible as it may initially sound, (P.6)\nhas consequences that even an extensionalist may not be willing to\naccept. For example, it may be argued that although the base and the\nstem of this wine glass jointly compose a larger part of the glass\nitself, and similarly for the stem and the bowl, there is nothing\ncomposed just of the base and the bowl (= the difference between the\nglass and the stem), since these two pieces are standing apart. More\ngenerally, it appears that (P.6) would force one to accept the\nexistence of a wealth of \u201cscattered\u201d entities, such as the\naggregate consisting of your nose and your thumbs, or the aggregate of\nall mountains higher than Mont Blanc. And since V. Lowe (1953), many\nauthors have expressed discomfort with such entities\nregardless of extensionality. (One philosopher who explicitly\naccepts extensionality but feels uneasy about scattered entities is\nChisholm 1987.) As it turns out, the extra strength of (P.6) is\ntherefore best appreciated in terms of the sort of mereological\naggregates that this principle would force us to accept, aggregates\nthat are composed of two or more parts of a given whole. This suggests\nthat any additional misgivings about (P.6), besides its extensional\nimplications, are truly misgivings about matters of composition. We\nshall accordingly postpone their discussion to Section 4, where we\nshall attend to these matters more fully. For the moment, let us\nsimply say that (P.6) is, on the face of it, not a principle that can\nbe added to M without further argument.\n",
