    "main_text": "\n1. The events leading up to March 7, 1277\n\nThe traditional picture of the events leading to Bishop\nTempier\u2019s condemnation looks something like this. On January 18,\n1277 Pope John XXI informed Stephen Tempier, Bishop of Paris, in a\nletter that he had heard rumors of heresy and charged him with the\ntask of examining (facias inspici vel inquiri) where and by\nwhom these errors had been disseminated (CUP 1: 541). On March 7,\n1277, Bishop Tempier published his list of 219 theological and\nphilosophical theses (articuli) and of some books that were\ncondemned. Anyone teaching or listening to the listed errors would be\nexcommunicated, unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the\nchancellor within seven days, in which case the bishop would inflict\nproportionate penalties (CUP 1: 543).\n\nSince this papal letter precedes Tempier\u2019s condemnation, it has\nbeen generally assumed that Tempier acted on papal initiative, and\nmoreover, acted in an overzealous and hasty way. In his letter, the\npope merely requested Tempier to investigate rumors of false teaching,\nwhereas the latter responded by drawing up a list of 219 false\npropositions. Furthermore, only about six weeks elapsed between the\npapal instructions and Tempier\u2019s publication of this list, a\nlist which has been characterized by historians as repetitious and\ndisorderly.\n\nUnfortunately, the chain of events leading up to Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation still is not totally clear. If Tempier, indeed, acted on\na papal mandate, it is surprising that he does not mention it in the\nintroduction to his syllabus of errors, but merely indicates that he\nhad received information from important people (Who these\n\u201cimportant people\u201d may have been is a question that will\nbe addressed below).\n\nAnother puzzling aspect concerning the course of events sketched above\nis the papal letter \u201cFlumen aquae vivae\u201d of April\n28, 1277, that is, more than forty days after Tempier had promulgated\nhis list of condemned articles. Curiously enough, this letter gives no\nindication whatsoever that the pope knew about Tempier\u2019s action.\nOn the contrary, the pope grants a mandate to Tempier to notify him,\nthe pope, about new errors, and to inform him about the names of the\npropagators of these errors, about their followers, and about their\nwritings. Pope John\u2019s second letter is a further specification\nof his first: he now indicates the culprits, namely \u201csome\nscholars of arts and in the faculty of theology at Paris\u201d\n(nonnulli tam in artibus quam in theologica facultate studentes\nParisius). In addition, its purpose is more focused. The pope\nwill use the dossier that he has requested from the bishop to\nestablish \u2013 with the help of an advisory committee \u2013 the\nnature of the errors and to decide whether they will have to be\nrecanted, or condemned and whether the University of Paris will need\nto be reformed.\n\nIn short, the evidence also allows another scenario, namely that\nTempier did not act on the pope\u2019s instigation, but was already\nin the process of preparing his condemnation when he received the\npapal letter of January 18, 1277. In this scenario of events, the\npapal letter Flumen aquae vivae crossed the letter in which\nTempier announced the condemnation.\n2. The juridical context of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n\nTempier\u2019s condemnation is only one of the approximately sixteen\nlists of censured theses that were issued at the University of Paris\nduring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Most of these lists of\npropositions were put together into systematic collections of\nprohibited articles. One of the earliest of these collections of\nmedieval condemned articles originated towards the end of the\nthirteenth century under the name of Parisian Articles or also\nCollectio errorum in anglia et parisius condempnatorum.\nInitially this collection consisted of twenty-two chapters presenting\nthe errors condemned in 1277 by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby at Oxford,\nin 1241 by Bishop William of Alvernia in Paris, and in 1270 and 1277\nby Bishop Stephen Tempier in Paris (in this order).\n\nDuring the fourteenth century, this Collection grew significantly, so\nthat, in fact, a second, augmented Collection came into existence. All\nthe propositions that were added to the first compilation had been\ncondemned in the fourteenth century at the University of Paris. It can\nbe seen as a collection of verdicts, which at the opening of each new\nset of verdicts provides information about the parties involved and\nthe date. The verdicts are not motivated, nor does the collection\nprovide an account of the events (narratio).\n\nThe collection of Parisian Articles must have had some kind of\nofficial status, and must have circulated among medieval scholars.\nBachelors in theology were required by oath not to maintain anything\n\u201cin favor of articles that have been condemned at the Roman\ncuria or in Paris.\u201d Moreover, many medieval philosophical and\ntheological texts contain references to and quotations from the\n\u201cParisian articles,\u201d which by no means should always be\nidentified with Tempier\u2019s list of condemned articles.\n\nIf one compares Tempier\u2019s 1277 syllabus to the other lists of\nerrors assembled in the compilation of Parisian Articles two features\nstand out, namely the anonymity of its targets and its promulgation by\na bishop. Tempier does not specify the persons behind the false views,\nbut merely states that the errors were disseminated by \u201ccertain\nscholars at the faculty of arts.\u201d The other condemnations,\nhowever, all concern specific scholars whose names are explicitly\nmentioned in the Collectio errorum. In addition, it is one of\nthe few censures in which a bishop was involved right from the start,\nand not, for instance, at a later stage of the proceedings as judge of\nan appeal.\n\nIn his introductory letter to the syllabus of errors, Tempier\nindicates that he responded to information received from important\npeople (magnarum et gravium personarum crebra zeloque fidei\naccensa insinuavit relatio). The allegations were that\n\u201csome scholars of arts at Paris\u201d (nonnulli Parisius\nstudentes in artibus) had been transgressing the limits of their\nown faculty (proprie facultatis limites excedentes). In all\nlikelihood, this complaint stemmed from theological circles.\n\nIn his introductory letter, Tempier also reports that he sought the\nadvice \u201cnot only of the doctors of Sacred Scripture, but also of\nother wise men\u201d (tam doctorum sacrae Scripturae, quam\naliorum prudentium virorum communicato consilio). From other\ncases of suspect teaching we know that the task of the theologians was\nto examine certain works and draw up a list of errors. In cases where\na list of alleged errors already existed, the theologians were charged\nwith assessing the degree of error of the listed propositions. The\ntheologian John of Pouilly reports that sixteen masters of theology\nwere Tempier\u2019s assessors for the condemnation. One of the\nmembers of the commission was Henry of Ghent, as he himself testifies\nin his Quodlibet II. It is unknown when these masters met,\nbut it must have been after Henry of Ghent had become a regent master\nin theology, a position that he obtained in 1276. That there were some\ntensions between Tempier and the theologians is attested by Giles of\nRome, a contemporary witness of the events of 1277: he claimed that\nsome articles were condemned not on the basis of the advice of the\nmasters, but rather due to the \u201cobstinacy of a few.\u201d This\nobservation has been taken to concern Tempier, but it might also have\nincluded some of the \u201cwise men\u201d who had assisted him.\n\nThe identity of these other wise men is unknown. Since, however, they\nare so clearly distinguished from the theologians, they have to be\nsought among the prelates. Of these, only the involvement of the\nchancellor, John of Alleux, is directly substantiated by the textual\nevidence: the introductory letter to Tempier\u2019s condemnation\nstipulated that offenders had to report either to the bishop himself\nor to the chancellor. Other likely candidates are Simon of Brion, the\npapal legate, and Ranulph of Houblonnire, Tempier\u2019s future\nsuccessor as bishop of Paris.\n\nIn addition, mention should be made of the possible role of the\ninquisitor of France, Simon du Val. On November 23, 1276 he had\nsummoned three ex-scholars from Paris, now residing in Li\u00e8ge,\nto appear before his court \u201cprobably and gravely suspect of the\ncrime of heresy\u201d (de crimine heresis probabiliter et\nvehementer suspectos). They were Siger of Brabant, canon at Saint\nPaul\u2019s, and Goswin of Chapelle and Bernier of Nivelles, canons\nat Saint Martin\u2019s, all in Li\u00e8ge. At least one of them,\nSiger of Brabant, was also implicated in Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n(see below). Although there is no firm textual evidence, it is\ntempting to speculate that the inquisitor\u2019s dossier concerning\nthese three arts masters was known to Bishop Tempier.\n3. What was condemned?\n\nThe condemnation of 1277 not only covered the already mentioned\nsyllabus of 219 errors, but also the work \u201cDe\namore\u201d by Andreas Capellanus, a treatise on geomancy with\nthe incipit \u201cEstimaverunt Indi\u201d and the explicit\n\u201cRacionare ergo super eum, et invenies, etc.\u201d\n\u2013 which has not yet been identified \u2013 and unnamed\ntreatises on necromancy, witchcraft, or fortune-telling.\n\nOf interest to historians of philosophy is the list of censured\npropositions. It is unknown what method Tempier and his advisers used\nto draw up their syllabus of 219 errors. Usually, it is claimed that\nTempier\u2019s list not very well organised and \u201cbroad in scope\nto the point of confusion.\u201d However, the lack of doctrinal\ncohesion is also present in other lists of the Collectio\nerrorum, simply because the order in which the charged errors\nappeared on the roll was determined by other factors such as, for\ninstance, the order in which they appeared in the examined work.\nShortly after 1277 the extremely long list of 219 prohibited views was\nreorganized, possibly to facilitate its use in the academic community.\nAt the beginning of this century, Pierre Mandonnet once again put\nTempier\u2019s articles into a new order, numbering and\ndistinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from the 40 theological\nones.\n\nA very helpful summary of the condemned propositions has been provided\nby John F. Wippel. The first seven of the philosophical propositions\nbear on the nature and excellence of philosophy. Propositions 8\nthrough 12 (in the numbering of Mandonnet) have a bearing on the\nknowability and nature of God. Propositions 13\u201315 concern divine\nknowledge, and 16 through 26 divine omnipotence. Many of the articles,\nnotably 34\u201361 regard the separate intelligences (angels).\nAnother interesting group of articles is 67\u201369. By condemning\nthese articles, Tempier endorsed God\u2019s absolute power to do\nwhatever he wills. Other interesting themes that are touched in the\nphilosophical articles are the world\u2019s eternity (80 through 89),\nthe unicity of the human intellect and its implications (117 through\n133), and human freedom and free will (151 through 166). Among the\ntheological articles, themes that appear are theology as a science\n(180\u2013186), the doctrine of the Eucharist (196\u2013199),\nChristian morality (202\u2013205), and human immortality and reward\nand punishment in the life to come (213\u2013219). It should be\nemphasized that Tempier\u2019s theses express positions that cannot\nbe maintained in light of revealed truth; for this reason, each is\nfollowed by the qualification, \u201cerror\u201d.\n\nRecently, Sylvain Piron has argued that Tempier\u2019s list of\ncondemned articles does exhibit an encyclopedic organization, which\nsuggests that Tempier had a deliberate plan. Articles 25\u2013183 can\nbe divided into sub-sections which respectively touch upon the topics\nof God, angels, the world, the soul, the intellect, the will,\nphilosophy, the will again (due to the misplacement of a rubric), and\nethics. The same global order is also present in articles 1\u201324.\nThe final articles, 184\u2013219, seem to be a miscellaneous\ncollection. Possibly, Tempier\u2019s list actually consists of three\nseparate lists.\n4. Who was condemned on March 7, 1277?\n\nThe question of who the targets were of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\ncannot be entirely separated from the question of what views were\ncensured. As was mentioned above, Tempier did not identify the targets\nof his condemnation, but merely indicated that it was directed against\nunspecified members of the arts faculty in Paris. Even though their\nnames appear nowhere in the document itself (and in the rubrics of\nonly two of the many medieval manuscripts which have preserved\nTempier\u2019s condemnation), Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia\nhave been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277\ncensure.\n\nYet, their identification should be qualified, as becomes clear from\nthe results, or should one say lack of results, of the ground-breaking\nstudy by Roland Hissette. He tried to identify the proximate\nbackground of the 219 condemned theses. As his point of departure,\nHissette took known works by Siger and Boethius and three anonymous\nwritings from the arts faculty that were available in a modern edition\nat the time that he wrote his study. From Hissette\u2019s own summary\nof the results of his careful examination it appears that surprisingly\nfew of the censured propositions could be identified with any degree\nof certainty in the known works of thirteenth-century\nartistae. Of the 219 propositions, only 79 can be identified,\nwith various degrees of probability, in the works of Siger of Brabant,\nBoethius of Dacia, or the three anonymous writings. Of 72 propositions\nthe attribution is uncertain, whereas 68 propositions could not be\nidentified at all. Moreover, many censured propositions that seem to\nhave been derived from the examined works that originated at the arts\nfaculty in the thirteenth century do not really represent the\nauthor\u2019s own view, but rather appear to be quotations or\nparaphrases from Aristotle, from Arabic philosophers, or from\n\u201cthe philosophers\u201d as Hissette himself indicates.\n\nHissette\u2019s examination was based on the assumption that\nTempier\u2019s censure envisioned only teachings from the faculty of\narts. The introductory letter, however, seems to contradict this\nassumption. There, Tempier draws an important distinction, which has\nnot been duly recognized in the scholarly literature, between\npropagators and views. He accuses the members of the arts faculty of\ndisseminating (tractare et disputare) manifest and damned\nerrors (manifesti et exsecrabiles errores). The errors are\nspecified in the roll or leaves connected to the introductory letter\n(in rotulo seu cedulis, praesentibus hiis annexo seu\nannexis). They are the 219 censured propositions. Tempier does\nnot state, however, that the members of the arts faculty are the\nauthors of these errors. In his introductory letter Tempier\nseparates the 219 censured errors from their propagators. Only the\npropagators have to be sought in the arts faculty in Paris: on pain of\nexcommunication, they are prohibited to dogmatize, disseminate, or\nsustain in any way (dogmatizare, aut defendere seu sustinere\nquoquo modo) the propositions collected by Tempier. The origin of\nthese propositions, however, is not stated in the introductory letter.\nIn other words, Tempier indicates that those artistae who\nwere castigated for disseminating false teachings were not necessarily\ndisseminating their own views. When drawing up the syllabus,\nTempier and his advisers relied on more sources, written or oral, than\nthose that were used by Hissette. Possibly, Tempier\u2019s list even\nincluded earlier lists of suspect views.\n\nThe inconclusiveness of Hissette\u2019s study strongly suggests that\nresearch into the proximate background of the censured propositions\nhas to be broadened. The directions that such research should take are\nindicated, either implicitly or explicitly, by Roland Hissette, and by\nother scholars such as John Wippel and Calvin Normore. Today it is\ngenerally agreed that a considerable number of the 219 censured\npropositions have a bearing on the reintroduction of pagan philosophy\ninto the arts faculty, and on the ensuing crisis over the relation of\nfaith and reason. Consequently, Greek or Arabic sources may prove to\nbe at the origin of a number of censured propositions, as is also\nsuggested in Tempier\u2019s preface, in which he indicated that the\nscholars whose errors he condemned took their inspiration from pagan\nwritings (cum errores praedictos gentilium scripturis\nmuniant), Other propositions may well have been derived from the\nteaching of theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas. In particular, John\nWippel has argued (against Roland Hissette) that Aquinas\u2019\nteaching was also implied in Tempier\u2019s condemnation and that\nsome of the positions were taken from his writings. In this respect,\nthe oft-quoted statement from Tempier\u2019s introductory letter that\nmembers of the arts faculty were transgressing the limits of their own\nfaculty (propriae facultatis limites excedentes) could\nacquire new meaning. Some members of the arts faculty were rebuked not\nonly for teaching suspect philosophical views but also for teaching\nsuspect theological views.\n\nAnother, complementary, line of inquiry has been suggested by Malcolm\nDe Mowbray. According to him, many of the theses may have originated\nfrom students during disputations in the schools. Given the oral\ncharacter of these exercises, it is only natural that they are\ndifficult to trace in extant works from masters of arts. Evidence for\nhis interpretation has De Mowbray found in Boethius of Dacia\u2019s\nDe aeternitate mundi, which, according to him, was meant to\nhelp students to hold a disputation. Much of De Mowbray\u2019s\ninterpretation hinges on our understanding of the Preface of\nTempier\u2019s condemnation, which mentions some people at the\narts-faculty (nonnulli Parisius studentes in artibus) who had\ndiscussed and disputed the condemned articles in the schools (in\nscolis tractare et disputare presumunt, ut eis nescient\nrespondere). His interpretation has been contested by Luca\nBianchi.\n\nRecently, Anthony Minnema has pointed out that article 112 (Mandonnet\n63), which mentions a camel, refers to a discussion of the\nsoul\u2019s power of impression in the Latin translation of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63idal-fal\u0101sifa.\n\nOn the basis of textual evidence provided by John of Naples, Maria\nEvelina Malgieri has suggested an improved text of article 156\n(Mandonnet 79): \u201cQuod si caelum staret ignis non ageret in\nstupam, quia nec Deus esset,\u201d rather than \u201cquia natura\ndeest,\u201d which was the traditional reading. This amendation is\nalso supported by some manuscripts of Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation.\n5. The doctrinal significance of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n\nTempier\u2019s condemnation has often been depicted as the most\ndramatic and significant doctrinal censure in the history of the\nUniversity of Paris, and a landmark in the history of medieval\nphilosophy and theology. Yet, the doctrinal significance of the\ncondemnation has received very diverse assessments. Since the\nappearance of the studies by Pierre Mandonnet and Fernand van\nSteenberghen, Tempier\u2019s condemnation has come to be associated\nwith the opposition between faith and reason, caused by the\nintroduction of newly translated philosophical sources in the Latin\nWest, in particular Aristotle and his commentator Averroes. Studies\nwhich present Tempier\u2019s condemnation as a response to\n\u201cAverroism\u201d or to \u201cradical Aristotelianism,\u201d\nfollow this line of interpretation.\n\nThis interpretation is often associated with the view that\nTempier\u2019s action was a symptom of an already existing opposition\nto rationalism, that is, against philosophical research pursued\nwithout concern for Christian orthodoxy. Evidence of the presence of\nrationalist tendencies at the University of Paris was found in certain\narticles of Tempier\u2019s syllabus, or in the prefatory letter in\nwhich Tempier expounded his notion of double truth. According to\nTempier, some scholars maintained that certain views were true\naccording to philosophy, but not according to Catholic faith,\n\u201cas if there were two contrary truths, and as if against the\ntruth of Sacred Scripture, there is truth in the sayings of the\ncondemned pagans.\u201d\n\nThe so-called theory of double truth has been the source of much\nconfusion. Nowadays, scholars agree that there were no medieval\nauthors who entertained the philosophically absurd theory that two\ncontradictory propositions \u2013 one derived from philosophical\ninvestigation, the other from Christian revelation--can both be true\nat the same time. Rather, Tempier\u2019s reproach should be taken as\nan attempt to ridicule the hermeneutical practice of commentators to\nevaluate a doctrine (for instance Aristotle\u2019s) from a\nphilosophical point of view (\u201cphilosophically speaking\u201d)\nand from faith. In reality, however, medieval scholars generally\nsupposed that in cases of conflict between reason and faith, the truth\nwas always on the side of the faith.\n\nIn more recent times, the idea that Tempier\u2019s condemnation was a\nsymptom of the existence of rationalist currents at the University of\nParis, in the sense of the emergence of philosophy as an autonomous\ndiscipline vis-\u00e0-vis divine revelation, has been further\ndeveloped by scholars such as Alain de Libera, Kurt Flasch, and Luca\nBianchi. Although there are differences in detail and in emphasis,\nthey view Tempier\u2019s action as an attempt to curb the concept of\nphilosophy as a comprehensive doctrine of natural knowledge aimed at\nthe attainment of happiness here in this life, rather than after\ndeath. Their studies about the significance of Tempier\u2019s\ncondemnation also address fundamental questions about the nature of\nphilosophy in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the historiography of medieval science, the views of Pierre Duhem,\nhave proven to be extremely influential. Duhem believed that Tempier,\nwith his insistence of God\u2019s absolute power, had liberated\nChristian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, and\nin this way marked the birth of modern science. Especially articles 39\nand 49 played a pivotal role in his eyes. Duhem\u2019s thesis has\nopened up the historiography of medieval science as a serious academic\ndiscipline. Yet, at the same time, no one in the field any longer\nendorses his view that modern science started in 1277. Of contemporary\nhistorians of science, Edward Grant probably comes closest to\nDuhem\u2019s vision, though his view includes many refinements and\nhistorical materials that were unknown to Duhem.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that the condemnation did have an impact on\nscholars at the university. Peter of Auvergne, for instance, wrote two\nsets of questions on Aristotle\u2019s De caelo, one of which was\nposterior to Tempier\u2019s condemnation. There, Peter of Auvergne\nchanged his views on such crucial issues as the world\u2019s\neternity, the animation of the heavens and the existence of an\ninfinite multitude.\n6. Tempier\u2019s other 1277 condemnations\n\nAlthough Tempier\u2019s action of March 7, 1277 is best known in the\nhistoriography of philosophy, mention should also be made of two\nadditional doctrinal investigations of 1277 that are attributed to\nBishop Tempier. The first one concerned the theologian Giles of Rome,\nand was concluded before March 28, 1277 with the censure of fifty-one\npropositions taken from Giles\u2019s commentary on the\nSentences. The second doctrinal inquiry was aimed against\nThomas Aquinas. It was begun after Giles\u2019s censure, but still\nbefore March 28, 1277. According to Robert Wielockx, the inquiry\nagainst Thomas Aquinas was never completed. Basing his conclusions on\nevidence provided in a letter by John Pecham, Wielockx claimed that\nduring the vacancy of the Apostolic See, sometime between May 20 and\nNovember 25, 1277, Tempier received orders from the curia to stop his\ninvestigation.\n\nWielockx\u2019s thesis of a separate process against Thomas Aquinas\nhas been generally accepted in the scholarly literature. However,\nrecently the historical evidence has been reexamined and his\ninterpretation been questioned by John Wippel and Hans Thijssen, the\nlatter in the context of a substantially revised account of the\njuridical procedures against Giles of Rome.\n",
