Feminine appearance and objectification\n\nIt has been pointed out by some feminist thinkers that women in our\nsociety are more identified and associated with their bodies than are\nmen, and, to a greater extent than men, they are valued for how they\nlook (Bartky 1990; Bordo 1993, 143). In order to gain social\nacceptability, women are under constant pressure to correct their\nbodies and appearance more generally, and to make them conform to the\nideals of feminine appearance of their time, the so-called\n\u2018norms of feminine appearance\u2019 (the standards of\nappearance women feel they should be living up to) (Saul 2003, 144).\nSome feminists have argued that, in being preoccupied with their\nlooks, women treat themselves as things to be decorated and gazed\nupon.\n\nIn her book Femininity and Domination, Sandra Bartky uses\nMarx\u2019s theory of alienation to explain the objectification that\nresults from women\u2019s preoccupation with their appearance. A\nfeature of Marx\u2019s theory of alienation is the\nfragmentation of the human person, this \u201csplintering of\nhuman nature into a number of misbegotten parts\u201d. For Marx,\nlabour is the most distinctively human activity, and the product of\nlabour is the exteriorisation of the worker\u2019s being. Under\ncapitalism, however, workers are alienated from the products of their\nlabour, and consequently their person is fragmented (Bartky 1990,\n128\u20139).\n\nBartky believes that women in patriarchal societies also undergo a\nkind of fragmentation \u201cby being too closely identified with\n[their body]\u2026 [their] entire being is identified with the body,\na thing which\u2026 has been regarded as less inherently human than\nthe mind or personality\u201d (Bartky 1990, 130). All the focus is\nplaced on a woman\u2019s body, in a way that her mind or personality\nare not adequately acknowledged. A woman\u2019s person, then, is\nfragmented. Bartky believes that through this fragmentation a woman is\nobjectified, since her body is separated from her person and is\nthought as representing the woman (Bartky 1990, 130).\n\nBartky explains that, typically, objectification involves two persons,\none who objectifies and one who is objectified. (This is also the idea\nof objectification put forward by Kant as well as by MacKinnon and\nDworkin.) However, as Bartky points out, objectifier and objectified\ncan be one and the same person. Women in patriarchal societies feel\nconstantly watched by men, much like the prisoners of the Panopticon\n(model prison proposed by Bentham), and they feel the need to look\nsensually pleasing to men (Bartky 1990, 65). According to Bartky:\n\u201cIn the regime of institutionalised heterosexuality woman must\nmake herself \u2018object and prey\u2019 for the man. \u2026 Woman\nlives her body as seen by another, by an anonymous patriarchal\nOther\u201d (Bartky 1990, 73). This leads women to objectify their\nown persons. Bartky argues that the woman \u201c[takes] toward her\nown person the attitude of the man. She will then take erotic\nsatisfaction in her physical self, revelling in her body as a\nbeautiful object to be gazed at and decorated\u201d. Such an attitude\nis called \u2018narcissism\u2019, which is defined by Bartky as the\ninfatuation with one\u2019s bodily being (Bartky 1990,\n131\u20132).\n\nIn being infatuated with their bodily beings, Bartky argues that women\nlearn to see and treat themselves as objects to be gazed at and\ndecorated, they learn to see themselves as though from the outside.\nNarcissism, as Simone de Beauvoir also points out, \u201cconsists in\nthe setting up of the ego as a double \u2018stranger\u2019\u201d\n(Beauvoir 1961, 375). The adolescent girl \u201cbecomes an object and\nshe sees herself as an object; she discovers this new aspect of her\nbeing with surprise: it seems to her that she has been doubled;\ninstead of coinciding exactly with herself, she now begins to exist\noutside\u201d (Beauvoir 1961, 316) (See the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir.)\n However, this \u2018stranger\u2019 who inhabits women\u2019s\nconsciousness, Bartky writes, is hardly a stranger; it is, rather, the\nwoman\u2019s own self (Bartky 1993, 134).\n\nAs Nancy Bauer holds, drawing on Beauvoir, women will always have\nreasons to succumb to the temptation of objectifying themselves. Bauer\nmentions the widespread recent phenomenon of female college students\nwho claim that they gain pleasure in performing unilateral oral sex on\nmale students. A woman who turns herself into an \u201cobject of the\nhelpless desire of a boy\u201din this way, Bauer explains,\nexperiences a sense of power and pleasure, which, however, are not\nunadulterated (Bauer 2011, 124). A great theme of The Second\nSex, Bauer concludes, is that, in order to achieve full\npersonhood, it is necessary not only that men stop objectifying women,\nbut also that \u201cwomen care about abjuring the temptation to\nobjectify themselves\u201d (Bauer 2011, 128).\n\nBartky talks about the disciplinary practices that produce a feminine\nbody and are the practices through which women learn to see themselves\nas objects. First of all, according to her, there are those practices\nthat aim to produce a body of a certain size and shape: women must\nconform to the body ideal of their time (i.e. a slim body with large\nbreasts), which, Bartky holds, requires women to subject their bodies\nto the \u2018tyranny of slenderness\u2019 (put themselves through\nconstant dieting and exercise) (Bartky 1990, 65\u20137). Susan Bordo\nalso emphasises the fact that women are more obsessed with dieting\nthan are men. This is linked to serious diseases such as anorexia and\nbulimia. Ninety percent of all anorexics, Bordo points out, are women\n(Bordo 1993, 143, 154). Furthermore, a large number of women have\nplastic surgery, most commonly liposuction and breast enlargement, in\norder to make their bodies conform to what is considered to be the\nideal body.\n\nAccording to Bartky, the second category of these disciplinary\npractices that produce a feminine body are those that aim to control\nthe body\u2019s gestures, postures, and movements. Women, she holds,\nare more restricted than men in the way they move, and they try to\ntake up very little space as opposed to men, who tend to expand to the\nspace available. Women\u2019s movements are also restrained by their\nuncomfortable clothes and shoes (Bartky 1990, 68\u20139). The final\ncategory of the disciplinary practices, Bartky holds, are those that\nare directed towards the display of a woman\u2019s body as an\n\u2018ornamented surface\u2019: women must take care of their skin\nand make it soft, smooth, hairless and wrinkle-free, they must apply\nmake-up to disguise their skin\u2019s imperfections. Our culture\ndemands the \u2018infantilisation\u2019 of women\u2019s bodies and\nfaces (Bartky 1990, 71\u20132).\n\nAccording to Bartky: \u201c\u2026 whatever else she [a woman] may\nbecome, she is importantly a body designed to please or to\nexcite\u201d (Bartky 1990, 80). Iris Marion Young adds that\nwomen\u2019s preoccupation with their appearance suppresses the body\npotential of women: \u201cDeveloping a sense of our bodies as\nbeautiful objects to be gazed at and decorated requires suppressing a\nsense of our bodies as strong, active subjects\u2026\u201d (Young,\n1979).\n\nWho is responsible for women\u2019s situation? According to Bartky:\n\u201cThe disciplinary power that inscribes femininity in the female\nbody is everywhere and it is nowhere; the disciplinarian is everyone\nand yet no one in particular\u201d (Bartky 1990, 74). The message\nthat women should look more feminine is everywhere: it is reinforced\nby parents, teachers, male partners, and it is expressed in various\nways throughout the media. Men, then, are not the only ones to blame\nfor women\u2019s situation. Because of the pervasiveness of this\ndisciplinary power that inscribes femininity, women\u2019s constant\npreoccupation with appearance has come to be regarded as something\nnatural and voluntary; it is something that women have internalised.\nTherefore, it is far from easy for women, in Bartky\u2019s view, to\nfree themselves from their objectification.\n\nNot all feminists, however, share the concern about the inevitability\nof objectification involved in women\u2019s appearance-related\npursuits. Janet Richards takes women\u2019s preoccupation with their\nlooks to be a matter of personal preference, and not a feminist\nmatter. She claims that there is nothing inherently degrading or\nobjectifying about women trying to be sensually pleasing (Richards\n1980, 184\u2013204). Natasha Walter too takes it that women\u2019s\npreoccupation with their appearance is not necessarily objectifying.\nShe also points to the fact that men in our society engage in\nself-decoration and seek to be admired by women (Walter 1998,\n86\u2013102).\n\nBordo herself acknowledges the fact that men have increasingly started\nto spend more time, money and effort on their appearance (Bordo 1999).\nShe emphasises the fact that men\u2019s magazines today, like\nwomen\u2019s, are full of articles and advice on how men should look:\nhow to be more muscular, what clothes to wear, what creams and other\ncosmetics to use, etc. Men feel the need to make their looks conform\nto the prevailing ideals of masculinity. Bordo believes that it is\nconsumer capitalism that drives men to be increasingly concerned with\ntheir appearance: \u201cWhy should [the cosmetics, diet, exercise,\nand surgery industries] restrict themselves to female markets, if they\ncan convince men that their looks need constant improvement\ntoo?,\u201d she asks (Bordo 1999, 220).\n\nThe fact that men too face pressure to look a certain way, and engage\nin constant efforts to improve their appearance, however, is not on\nits own sufficient to show that women\u2019s (and men\u2019s)\npreoccupation with appearance is not objectifying. According to Saul,\n\u201cThe increasing pressure on men to conform to unattainable\nstandards of beauty is far from a sign of progress: it is, instead, a\nsign that the problem has grown\u201d (Saul 2003, 168).\n",
