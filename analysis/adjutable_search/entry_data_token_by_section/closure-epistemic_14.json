    "main_text": "The Argument From Skepticism || Contextualism and Skepticism\n5.4 Contextualism and Skepticism\n\nTheorists writing under the label \u201ccontextualism,\u201d such as\nDavid Lewis (1979, 1996), Stewart Cohen (1988, 1999), and Keith DeRose\n(1995), offer a related way of explaining skepticism without denying\nclosure. For clarity, we might call them speaker-centered (or\nattributor) contextualists since they contrast their view\nwith agent-centered contextualism. According to (speaker-centered)\ncontextualists, whether it is correct for a judge to\nattribute knowledge to someone depends on that judge\u2019s\ncontext, and the standards for knowledge differ from context to\ncontext. When the man on the street judges knowledge, the applicable\nstandards are relatively modest. But an epistemologist takes all sorts\nof possibilities seriously that are ignored by ordinary folk, and so\nmust apply quite stringent standards in order to reach correct\nassessments. What passes for knowledge in ordinary contexts does not\nqualify for knowledge in contexts where heightened criteria apply.\nSkepticism is explained by the fact that the contextual variation of\nepistemic standards is easily overlooked. Skeptics note that in the\nepistemic context it is inappropriate to grant anyone knowledge.\nHowever, skeptics assume\u2014falsely\u2014that what goes in the\nepistemic context goes in all contexts. They assume that since those\nwho take skepticism seriously must deny anyone knowledge, then\neveryone, regardless of context, should deny anyone knowledge. Yet\npeople in ordinary contexts are perfectly correct in claiming that\nthey know all sorts of things.\n\nFurthermore, the closure principle is correct, contextualists say, so\nlong as it is understood to operate within given contexts, not across\ncontexts. That is, so long as we stay within a given context, we know\nthe things we deduce from other things we know. But if I am in an\nordinary context, knowing I am in San Antonio, I cannot come to know,\nvia deduction, that I am not a brain in a vat on a distant planet,\nsince the moment I take that skeptical possibility seriously, I\ntransform my context into one in which heightened epistemic standards\napply. When I take the vat possibility seriously, I must wield\ndemanding standards that rule out my knowing I am not a brain in a\nvat. By the same token, these standards preclude my knowing I am in\nSan Antonio. Thinking seriously about knowledge undermines our\nknowledge.\n",
