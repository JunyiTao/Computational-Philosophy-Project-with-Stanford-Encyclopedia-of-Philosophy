    "main_text": "Confucian Reactions to Early Catholicism || Confucian-Catholics, Tasan and Moral Priorities\n7. Emergence of Modernisation and Confucian Challenges\n\nThe nineteenth century was a time of transformation in East Asia,\nparticularly in Korea, and Confucian scholars were still eager to\nvalidate their discourse, even if it meant persecuting rivals: between\n1866 and 1871, between 8,000 and 10,000 Catholics, men, women and\nchildren were tortured and executed by Confucian authorities. Choi\nMin-Hong (1980:191\u2013217) notes the re-emergence of philosophers\ninterested in Principle in the nineteenth century, many who\nhad been linked with the Namin faction, hence, proponents of\nthe T\u2019oegye\u2019s metaphysical ideas. This included Ki\nCh\u014fngjin (1798\u20131876) and Yi Hangno (1792\u20131868), the\nlatter who considered Principle to be the basic substance of\nthe universe, and \u201csomething spiritual\u201d (1980: 194). Ki\nCh\u014fngjin, who again returned to study the writings of Zhu Xi,\nalso re-engaged with studying sage learning and \u201cresearching the\nClassics\u201d. He regarded Principle as a sort of spiritual\nSupreme Ultimate, which then produced yin and yang (and the material\nforce)\u2014in other words, Principle preceded ki,\nand this Principle was reflected differently in men and\nanimals (Choi M.-H. 1980: 196\u2013198). Yi Chin-sang\n(1818\u20131885) also considered Principle as preceding\nki, but also as that which generated it, therefore,\nself-cultivation lay in the study of the mind and not in knowing\nexternal things due to man\u2019s \u201cHeaven-bestowed cognitive\npowers\u201d which depended on \u201ctranscendental Li\n[Principle]\u201d. Such idealistic ideas were hardly needed\nat a time when society was in such a state of disarray, already\nforeboded in the writings of Tasan.\n\nAt the same time, another branch emerged championing ki, such\nas Ch\u2019oe Han-ki (1803\u20131879), who was weary of being\ngoverned by prejudices. Ch\u2019oe\u2019s work has been re-evaluated\nin more recent times. Scholars underscore his empiricist philosophy\nthat investigated the role of experience in a methodologically\nsophisticated manner, reminiscent of John Locke (1632\u20131704), but\nused in Ch\u2019oe\u2019s work to undermine the idea of a naturally\ngood mind before learning from accumulated experiences (Park 2004). He\nwas very well acquainted with European science and observes a more\npractical interest in the material force. One can notice his ontology\nbased on a \u201cOne-Dimensional ki theory\u201d, which, in\nhis opinion, was what shaped all things, even preceding all forms,\nwhile at the same time \u201cdenying the [Zhu Xi\u2019s\nschool\u2019s] world of innate reasoning power\u201d (Choi M.-H.\n1980: 205). He was also influenced by the changing times, critical of\nthe class system and the inhumane treatment of the population, issues\nraised by Tasan earlier in the century.\n\nPark Chong-hong (2004: 396) critiques the trend of the (later-called)\nSirhak [Practical] scholars, who \u201cmade the mistake of\narranging encyclopedic knowledge\u201d and other \u201ctrivial\nmatters\u201d, clearly unable to fathom what was coming, and unable\nto provide Chos\u014fn with the tools it needed to survive the\n\u201cmodernisation\u201d that would soon be thrust upon the\npeninsula, leading to Japan\u2019s eventual colonial rule over the\npeninsula (1910\u20131945). As the situation on the peninsula\ndisintegrated, Koreans sought alternatives to Confucianism to deal\nwith social issues and inequality. The first of these New Religious\nMovements (NRMs) was known as Tonghak (\u6771\u5b78), or\nEastern Learning, to contrast directly with the foreign \u201cWestern\nLearning\u201d, and it attempted to help hopeless poor peasants whose\nlives were getting progressively worse, especially in the southern\nregions far from the capital. Tonghak was founded by Ch\u2019oe Che-u\n(1824\u20131864), known by his followers as Su-un, and while\nproviding an alternative to Confucianism, it used the name of the\n\u201cSovereign on High\u201d (Sangje) from the Confucian\nClassics to refer to its deity, while also using the Catholic term\n\u201cLord of Heaven\u201d (Ch\u2019\u014fnju) as well.\nThere were splinter groups formed out of this NRM such as\nCh\u016dngsando (more commonly written Jeungsando), and Daesoon\nJinrihoe, both worshipping different iterations of\nSangje\u2014a monotheistic Korean deity with Confucian\norigins (see Cawley 2019: ch. 5).\n\nAs the end of the Chos\u014fn dynasty drew nearer, and Korea opened up\nto Western countries, many Protestant missionaries would enter Korea\nby the late 1880s to make their mark on its religious culture. This\nmotivated some Confucian scholars to attempt to revitalise\nConfucianism, emphasising its religious aspects, while others sought\nto reform Confucianism to counter the attempts by the Japanese\ngovernment to \u201cJapanize\u201d the peninsula. Interestingly,\nKeum (1980 [2000: 219]) comments that \u201cIt goes without saying\nthat the idea of Confucian Religion was prompted by the Christian\nconcept of a transcendent God\u201d, as well as the idea of\n\u201cthe organisation of a religious community [and] their own\nreligious institutions\u201d. However, this did not really take off,\nlikely due to the elitism associated with Confucianism, and the way it\nhad been responsible for the unfair treatment of people from different\nclasses, and in particular, women, who were increasingly embracing\nProtestantism, which had facilitated their education in\n\u201cmodern\u201d schools.\n\nHan Hyong-jo (2016) articulates that more recent understandings of\nKorean Confucianism \u201chas mirrored its chief nemesis,\nmodernity\u201d and outlines three stages:\n\nDenial (1890s\u20131930s), where Confucianism was blamed for the\nloss of Korea\u2019s sovereignty;\nExcuse (1930s\u20131980s): Sirhak, whereby\n\u201cpractical\u201d ideas were \u201cfished\u201d out of the\ntradition as a sort of retrospective consolation had things gone\ndifferently;\nRehabilitation (1980s\u20131997): suggesting that Confucianism is\nbehind of the economic rise of Korea and linked to the emergence of\nits democracy, despite the fact that Confucians were against industry\nand labour, and they supported unelected rulers from a royal\nclan.\n\n\nIndeed, rulers\u2019 challengers were easily disposed of\u2014even\nif they should be senior members of their own\nfamily\u2014contravening teachings on filial piety. Confucianism has\nalso been linked with a resurgence of \u201cAsian\u201d values, or\nrecalibrated (yet again) to permit a feminist turn, and possibly even\nfound in some of the Juche ideas of North Korea\u2019s state\nideology, which commands undisputed loyalty (chung) to its\nDear Leader.\n\nConfucianism is currently at a crossroads as it interacts with other\ntraditions in the twenty-first century, nestling between them and\ninsinuating itself throughout them (Min 2016). In a sense, one might\nlook to recovering what Han Hyoung-jo (2016) describes as a lost art\nof Confucian ihak, a form of cultivation of the mind, whereby\nreengaging with it might just draw us closer to how it was understood\nfor centuries, and bring us closer to its goal, which is not\ndemocracy, but something more noble, sagehood. Han (2016) suggests\nthat this has the potential to cure us from \u201cself-oblivion and\nself-centredness\u201d, the deficiencies and flaws of our culture\ntoday, by helping us to rediscover our innate potential for humane\nco-existence, irrespective of our political or religious views. Korean\nConfucianism and its emphasis on sage learning, rather than being\noutmoded, may be the agnostic moral approach that has the potential to\nreconnect us to ourselves and each other, at a time when psychological\ndistress is on the rise in all modern \u201cdeveloped\u201d\ndemocracies.\n",
