    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nWriters on aesthetics in the empiricist tradition such as Shaftsbury,\nHume, and Reid thought of their contributions as broadly empirical\n(see Shelley 2006 [2020]), and among the very first experimental\ninvestigations in psychology were studies of aesthetic preferences and\nresponses, for example Fechner\u2019s attempt to discover whether the\n\u201cgolden section\u201d is especially preferred to other ratios\n(1871). The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were rich in\nwork of this kind, and there were more speculative studies of\n\u201cembodied\u201d responses to architectural structures, a debate\nthat brought the term \u201cempathy\u201d to the English language\n(Vischer 1873; Lipps 1903). But for most of the twentieth century\naesthetics was seen, by its proponents and its detractors, as an\n\u201carmchair\u201d project. Wittgenstein, whose conception of\nphilosophy strongly influenced the field\u2019s direction in the\ncentury\u2019s latter half, said\n\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any connection between what\npsychologists do and any judgement about a work of art. (1967, 19; on\nWittgenstein\u2019s own experimental work on the perception of rhythm\nsee Guter 2020)\n\n\nTo the extent that aesthetics in this period was influenced by\nthinking about the mind it was more often prompted by ideas from\npsychoanalysis (Wollheim 1993). The last thirty years have seen a\nshift back towards empirical inquiry, assisted by a resurgence of\ninterest in the imagination, now often treated as a capacity with an\nevolutionary and developmental history (Fuentes 2020; Harris 2000) and\nas subject to selective damage (Currie 1996).\n\nIt has never been plausible to think of aesthetics as wholly a\npriori. Even those who think its main business is the analysis of\nwidely shared folk concepts (Dickie 1962) will agree that a\nphilosopher of music should have a good deal of knowledge of the\nhistory, art making practices and traditions of criticism of some\nmusical tradition. In this respect aesthetics is closer to the\nphilosophy of physics or economics than it is to metaphysics. There is\nalso a frequently acknowledged connection between aesthetics and the\nstudy of perception. When Baumgarten (1750\u201358) first introduced\nthe term \u201caesthetics\u201d he called it a \u201cscience of\nperception\u201d and according to Nanay (2014: 101)\n\n\nmany, maybe even most traditional problems in aesthetics are in fact\nabout philosophy of perception and can, as a result, be fruitfully\naddressed with the help of the conceptual apparatus of the philosophy\nof perception.\n\n\nThis is a stronger claim than many would make (see Margolis 1960;\nSibley 1965; Schellekens 2006; and Robson 2018) but theses in\naesthetics do sometimes depend on claims, including scientifically\ntractable claims, about the nature of perception. A notable example is\nthe debate about whether perception is cognitively penetrable; if it\nis, the way a picture looks or a piece of music sounds may depend on\nwhat the observer knows about contextual factors (for the rejection of\ncognitive penetrability see Danto 2001; for criticism see Rose &\nNanay 2022).\n\nPhilosophical doubts about the relevance of empirical work to\naesthetics are of various kinds. Some authors merely suggest that\nphilosophers are apt to make hasty generalisations from slender\nexperimental evidence, give insufficient attention to their details\nand limitations, and fail to acknowledge the existence of conflicting\nexpert opinion (Kone\u010dni 2013; Stock 2014). Philosophers,\naestheticians among them, can certainly overestimate their expertise\non occasion and it may well be that they are even more prone to do so\nwhen it comes to empirical matters. None of this points to anything in\nprinciple problematic about their enthusiasm for the empirical. Other\ndoubters emphasise what they see as more systemic dangers. Roger\nScruton (2014) suggests a tendency to try to assimilate aesthetic\nphenomena to available scientific frameworks that turn out to be ill\nfitting; he cites the attempt to use Chomskian linguistics to found a\ngenerative theory of music which, he claims, fails to accommodate\neither music\u2019s structure or purpose. Gordon Graham (2014),\ncontrasting Hume\u2019s aesthetic theory unfavourably with that of\nReid, says that the project of an \u201caesthetic science\u201d must\nignore or deny the role of reason and judgement. Again, one may be\nalive to both kinds of dangers while retaining an openness to\nempirical work. In particular, Graham\u2019s challenge might be\nresponded to by noting that studies of the role actually played by\nreasons in aesthetic judgement point to a sometimes striking\ndisconnect between what people think of as their reasons and the\nfactors that determine their preferences (Lopes 2014 and Irvin 2014;\nsee also below,\n Section 3);\n this can hardly be irrelevant to someone investigating the\nrationality of aesthetic judgement. Further, work which aestheticians\nhave thought of as conceptual analysis in a broad sense has often\npresumed answers to what are in fact empirical questions. Noel Carroll\nsays that\n\n\nThe supposition that aesthetic properties are objective also explains\nbetter how we talk about them than does the projection theory.\n\u2026people involved in disputes about aesthetic properties\n\u2026 speak as if one side of the disagreement is right and the\nother wrong. (Carroll 1999: 117)\n\n\nStudies in the new field of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d (for\nsome overviews of this field, as applied to aesthetics, see Cova &\nR\u00e9hault 2018 and Torregrossa 2020) challenge this view. One\nstudy (Cova, Olivola, et al. 2019) gathered more than two thousand\nresponses across 19 countries to an imagined disagreement about\nwhether an object of aesthetic interest is beautiful. It found that in\nall populations the least popular view was that\n\u201csomeone is right and someone is wrong\u201d. The study itself\nhas come in for criticism (Zangwill 2018) but, regardless of its\nsuccess, it highlights the general point that we should not assume\nwithout evidence that the philosopher\u2019s understanding of folk\nconcepts (or folk practice) matches that of the folk themselves:\nsomething that should be of concern to those, such as Dickie, who\nconceive of the work of aestheticians as largely involving the\nelucidation of folk concepts.\n\nThe question discussed above and to which Carroll and the members of\nthe Cova team give such different answers is a higher order question,\nconcerning whether people think of aesthetic judgements as having\nnormative force. We can ask similar questions about lower level\njudgements. Consider the claim that we shouldn\u2019t form aesthetic\njudgements on the basis of testimony, a claim said to be supported by\nour supposed practice of refraining from forming such judgements (Kant\n1790 [2000: 9]; Nguyen 2020: 1127). Contrary to this, Robson (2014)\nargues that this descriptive claim about our judgement forming\npractice is mistaken\u2014something which would, if true, undermine\none significant motivation for the normative claim.\n\nFrom an entirely different perspective, there are those who think that\nphilosophers have very little role to play in answering key aesthetic\nquestions and that we should seek to replace, rather than merely\nsupplement, traditional philosophical methods with more scientific\napproaches. Exemplifying this tendency, Semir Zeki says\n\n\nno theory of aesthetics that is not substantially based on the\nactivity of the brain is ever likely to be complete, let alone\nprofound,\n\n\ngoing on to say that painting is an inquiry into the laws of the brain\nand that what pleases us is what pleases our brains (1999: 1\u20132).\nWhile attitudes such as this may not constitute a complete dismissal\nof philosophical aesthetics they show little awareness of its results,\nor understanding of the limitations of neurological studies. Facts\nabout brain processes do not tell us\u2014at least without some\nsubstantive and controversial bridging premises\u2014what objects are\nart works, or what works have value (see Hyman 2010 for wide ranging\ncriticism of this approach). The relations between empirical work and\nnormative aesthetics will recur throughout this entry.\n",
