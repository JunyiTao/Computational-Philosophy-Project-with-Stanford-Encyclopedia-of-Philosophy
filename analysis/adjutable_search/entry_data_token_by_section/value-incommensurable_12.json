    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Optimization and Maximization\n4.1 Optimization and Maximization\n\nAt a minimum, for the choice of an alternative to qualify as\njustified, there must not be an overriding reason against choosing it.\nBeyond that, conceptions of justified choice differ in what is\nrequired for the choice of an alternative to qualify as justified.\n\nRuth Chang defines \u201ccomparativism\u201d as the view that\n\u201ccomparative facts are what make a choice objectively correct;\nthey are that in virtue of which a choice is objectively rational or\nwhat one has most or sufficient normative reason to do. So, whether you\nare a consequentialist, deontologist, virtue theorist, perfectionist,\ncontractualist, etc., about the grounds of rational choice, you should\nbe, first and foremost, I suggest, a comparativist\u201d (2016, 213).\nIf alternatives are incomparable, then the lack of a comparative fact\nprecludes the possibility of justified choice.\n\nOne response has been to argue that apparently incomparable\nalternatives are, in fact, comparable. As discussed in subsection 2.2,\njudgments of incomparability frequently involve comparisons that are\ndifficult and it may be that judgments of incomparability are mistaken\n(Regan 1997) or that, due to vagueness, it is indeterminate which\nvalue relation holds. In addition, as discussed, alternatives that\nappear incomparable by way of \u201cbetter than,\u201d \u201cworse\nthan,\u201d or \u201cequally good\u201d may be comparable by way of\nsome fourth comparative relation, such as \u201croughly equal\u201d\nor \u201con a par.\u201d This means that there is a comparative fact\nthat makes a choice objectively correct in cases of apparent\nincomparability. It does not, however, help us identify the\nobjectively correct alternative.\n\nA common form of comparativism is optimization.\nAccording to optimization, the fact that an alternative is at least as\ngood as the other alternatives is what justifies its choice.\nConsequently, if two alternatives are incomparable no justified choice\ncan be made between them. Another line of response, one from within\nthe economics literature, has been to distinguish between\n\u201coptimization\u201d and \u201cmaximization\u201d as theories\nof justified choice (Sen 1997, 746; Sen 2000, 486). The theory of\nmaximization as justified choice only requires the choice of an\nalternative that is not worse than other alternatives. Because\nincomparable alternatives are not worse than one another, the choice\nof either is justified according to the theory of maximization as\njustified choice. Maximization is thus a rejection of comparativism.\nHowever, Hsieh (2007) argues that proponents of comparativism have no\nreason to reject maximization as an account of justified choice and\nconsequently incomparability need not pose a problem for the\npossibility of justified choice.\n",
