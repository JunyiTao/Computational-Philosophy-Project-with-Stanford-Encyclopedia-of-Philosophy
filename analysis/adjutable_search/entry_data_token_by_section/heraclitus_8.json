Value\n\nThe aim of Heraclitus\u2019 unusual approach is to produce readers\nwho have a proper grasp of the world and their place in it.\n\u201cSound thinking is the greatest virtue and wisdom: to speak the\ntruth and to act on the basis of an understanding of the nature of\nthings\u201d (B112). Such an understanding can result only from an\nability to interpret the language of nature. The proper understanding\nallows one to act in a harmonious way.\n\nHeraclitus urges moderation and self-control in a somewhat\nconventional way (B85, B43). He also recommends the conventional Greek\ngoal of seeking fame: \u201cThe best choose one thing above all, the\neverlasting fame of mortals; the many gorge themselves like\ncattle\u201d (B29). To die in battle is a superior kind of death\n(B24). Those who drink to excess make their souls wet, and accordingly\nharm them (B117), for a healthy soul is dry (B118). Those who\nexperience better deaths attain better rewards (B25). Those who lie\nwill be punished (B28[b]). \u201cFor men who die there await things\nthey do not expect or anticipate\u201d (B27). Some of these remarks\ntend to suggest an afterlife with rewards and punishment, although his\nbelief in a continued existence is controversial (see Nussbaum 1972).\nIn any case, Heraclitus views the soul as the moral and cognitive\ncenter of human experience.\n\nIn political theory he maintains that one good man is worth ten\nthousand ordinary people (B49). He criticizes his fellow citizens for\nbanishing a distinguished leader:\n\nThe adult citizens of Ephesus should hang themselves, every one, and\nleave the city to children, since they have banished Hermodorus, a man\npre-eminent among them, saying, Let no one stand out among us; or let\nhim stand out elsewhere among others. (B121)\n\n\nEvidently he trusts the few and distrusts the many. He sees good laws\nas being reflections of universal principles:\n\nSpeaking with sense we must fortify ourselves in the common sense of\nall, as a city is fortified by its law, and even more forcefully. For\nall human laws are nourished by the one divine law. For it prevails as\nfar as it will and suffices for all and is superabundant. (B114)\n\n\nThe divine law, on Heraclitus\u2019 view, is probably continuous with\nthe laws governing the cosmos, which maintain justice through\nopposition (B80).\n",
