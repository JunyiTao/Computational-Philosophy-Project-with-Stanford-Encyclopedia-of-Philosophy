The Epistemology of Logical Atomism\n\nHow could we possibly know that something is a Tractarian object?\nWittgenstein has little or nothing to say on this topic in the\nTractatus, and yet it is clear from his retrospective remarks\nthat during the composition of the Tractatus he did think it\npossible in principle to discover the Tractarian objects (See\nAM, 11 and EPB, 121). So it seems worth asking by\nwhat means he thought such a discovery might be made. \n\nSometimes, it can seem as though Wittgenstein just expected to hit\nupon the simples by reflecting from the armchair on those items that\nstruck him as most plausibly lacking in proper parts. This impression\nis most strongly suggested in the Notebooks, and in\nparticular in a passage from June 1915 in which Wittgenstein seems to\nexpress confidence that certain objects already within his ken either\ncount as Tractarian objects or will turn out to do so. He says:\n\u201cIt seems to me perfectly possible that patches in our visual\nfield are simple objects, in that we do not perceive any single point\nof a patch separately; the visual appearances of stars even seem\ncertainly to be so\u201d (NB, 64). By \u201cpatches in our\nvisual field\u201d in this context Wittgenstein means parts of the\nvisual field with no noticeable parts. In other words, points\nin visual space (cf. KL, 120). Clearly, then, Wittgenstein at\none stage believed he was in a position to specify some Tractarian\nobjects. However, the balance of the evidence suggests that this idea\nwas short-lived. For he was later to say that he and Russell had\npushed the question of examples of simples to one side as a matter to\nbe settled on a future occasion (AM, 11). And when Norman\nMalcolm pressed Wittgenstein to say whether when he wrote the\nTractatus he had decided on anything as an example of a\n\u201csimple object,\u201d he had replied \u2014 according to\nMalcolm\u2019s report \u2014 that \u201cat the time his thought had\nbeen that he was a logician; and that it was not his business as a\nlogician, to try to decide whether this thing or that was a simple\nthing or a complex thing, that being a purely empirical matter\u201d\n(Malcolm 1989, 70).\n\nWittgenstein was not suggesting that the correct way to establish that\nsomething is a Tractarian object is to gather evidence that its\ndecomposition is physically impossible. That reading would\nonly have a chance of being correct if Wittgenstein had taken\nmetaphysical possibility to coincide with physical possibility, and\nthat is evidently not\n so.[8]\n His meaning seems rather to be just that the objects must be\ndiscovered rather than postulated or otherwise specified in advance of\ninvestigation (cf. AM, 11). But since Wittgenstein was later\nto accuse his Tractarian self of having entertained the concept of a\ndistinctive kind of philosophical discovery (see WVC\n182, quoted below), we must not jump \u2014 as Malcolm appears to\nhave done, to the conclusion that he conceived of the discovery in\nquestion as \u201cempirical\u201d in anything like the contemporary\nsense of the word. \n\nWe know that Wittgenstein denied categorically that we could\nspecify the possible forms of elementary propositions and the\nsimples a priori (4.221, 5.553\u20135.5541, 5.5571). But he\ndid not deny that these forms would be revealed as the result of\nlogical analysis. In fact, he maintained precisely this view. This\nidea is not explicit in the Tractatus, but it is spelled out\nin a later self-critical remark from G. E. Moore\u2019s notes of\nWittgenstein\u2019s 1933 lectures at Cambridge: \n\nI say in [the] Tractatus that you can\u2019t say anything\nabout [the] structure of atomic prop[osition]s: my idea being the\nwrong one, that logical analysis would reveal what it would reveal\n(entry for 6 February, 1933, Stern et. al., 2016, 252)\n\n\nSpeaking of Tractarian objects in another retrospective remark, this\ntime from a German version of the Brown Book, Wittgenstein\nsays: \u201cWhat these [fundamental constituents] of reality are it\nseemed difficult to say. I thought it was the job of further logical\nanalysis to discover them\u201d (EPB 121). These remarks\nshould be taken at face value: it is logical analysis \u2014 the\nanalysis of propositions \u2014 that is supposed to enable us to\ndiscover the forms of elementary propositions and the objects. The\nhope is that when propositions have been put into their final, fully\nanalysed forms by applying the \u201ccalculus\u201d spoken of in the\nPhilosophical Grammar we will finally come to know the names\nand thereby the objects. Presumably, we will know the latter by\nacquaintance in the act of grasping propositions in their final\nanalysed forms.\n\nAdmittedly, Wittgenstein\u2019s denial that we can know the objects\na priori looks strange given the fact that the analytical\nprocedure described in Section 2 above seems to presuppose that we\nhave a priori knowledge both of the correct analyses of ordinary names\nand of the contextual definitions by means of which terms for\ncomplexes are to beeliminated. But some tension in\nWittgenstein\u2019s position on this point is just what we should\nexpect in view of his later rather jaundiced assessment of his earlier\nreliance on the idea of philosophical discovery:\n\nI [used to believe that] the elementary propositions could be\nspecified at a later date. Only in recent years have I broken away\nfrom that mistake. At the time I wrote in a manuscript of my book,\n\u201cThe answers to philosophical questions must never be\nsurprising. In philosophy you cannot discover anything.\u201d I\nmyself, however, had not clearly enough understood this and offended\nagainst it. (WVC, 182, emphasis added)\n\n\nThe remark that Wittgenstein quotes here from \u201ca manuscript of\nthe Tractatus\u201d did not survive into the final version,\nbut its sentiment is clearly echoed in the related remark that there\ncan: \u201cnever be surprises in logic\u201d (6.1251). Wittgenstein\nis clear that in the Tractatus he had unwittingly proceeded\nas though there could be such a thing as a philosophical\nsurprise or discovery. His idea that the true objects would be\ndiscovered through analysis, but are nonetheless not known a\npriori, is plausibly one instance of this mistake.\n\nOn the conception of the Tractatus, objects are to be\ndiscovered by grasping fully analysed propositions, presumably\nwith the awareness that they are fully analysed. But\nsince that is so, we shall not have fully explained how we are\nsupposed to be able to discover the simples unless we explain how, in\npractice, we can know we have arrived at the final analysis of a\nproposition. But on this point, unfortunately, Wittgenstein has little\nto say. In fact, the only hint he offers is the rather dark one\ncontained in Tractatus 3.24: \n\nThat a propositional element signifies [bezeichnet] a complex\ncan be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it\noccurs. We know that everything is not yet determined by this\nproposition. (The notation for generality contains a prototype).\n(3.24)\n\n\nIt is an indeterminateness in propositions \u2014 whatever this might\namount to \u2014 that is supposed to alert us to the need for further\nanalysis. In Wittgenstein\u2019s view, then, we possess a positive\ntest for analyzability. However, since the notion of\n\u201cindeterminateness\u201d in question is unclear, the test is of\nlittle practical value. The indeterminateness in question is plainly\nnot the one we considered in section 3: what is in question at the\npresent juncture is the indeterminateness of propositions, not of\nsenses. But what does that amount to?\n\nAccording to one line of interpretation, due originally to W. D. Hart\n(Hart 1971), a proposition is indeterminate when there is more than\none way it can be true. Thus if I say \u201cBarack Obama is in the\nUnited States,\u201d I leave open where in particular he might be.\nThe source of the indeterminacy is the implied generality of this\nstatement, which is tantamount to: \u201cObama is somewhere\nin the United States.\u201d This line of interpretation has the merit\nof promising to make sense of the closing parenthetical remark of\n3.24. But it cannot be correct. The kind of indeterminacy that\nWittgenstein has in mind at 3.24 is supposed to serve as a sign of\nfurther analysability. But Hart\u2019s notion cannot play this role,\nsince any disjunctive proposition would be indeterminate in his sense,\neven a fully analysed proposition consisting of a disjunction of\nelementary propositions.\n\nAccording to a second line of interpretation, a proposition is\nindeterminate in the relevant sense if the result of embedding it in\nsome context is structurally ambiguous. Consider, for example, the\nresult of embedding \u201cF [A]\u201d in the\ncontext \u201cit is not true that,\u201d where\n\u2018A\u2019 is temporarily treated as a semantically\nsimple term designating a complex (Keep in place the assumption that a\nsentence containing a non-referring semantically simple term is\nneither true nor false). In this case the question would arise whether\nthe result of this embedding is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which A does not exist, or simply true.\nThe first option corresponds to giving the apparent name wide scope\nwith respect to the logical operator, the second to giving it narrow\nscope. Such a scope ambiguity could not exist if\n\u2018A\u2019 were a genuine Tractarian name, so its\npresence could reasonably be taken to signal the need for further\nanalysis.\n\nSo far, so good, but where does the business about the generality\nnotation \u201ccontaining a prototype\u201d come in? Nothing in the\npresent explanation has yet done justice to this remark. Nor does the\npresent explanation really pinpoint what it is that signals the need\nfor further analysis. That, at bottom, is the fact that we can imagine\ncircumstances in which the supposed referent of\n\u2018A\u2019 fails to exist. So, again, there is reason to\nbe dissatisfied with this gloss on indeterminacy. \n\nIt is hard to resist the conclusion that Wittgenstein never supplied\nan adequate way of recognizing when a proposition is fully analysed,\nand consequently that he failed to specify a means for recognizing\nsomething as a Tractarian object.\n",
