    "main_text": "Compassion, Resentment, and Forgiveness\n6. Compassion, Resentment, and Forgiveness\n\nCompassion was besides the love of God the most important of the\nparticular passions involving benevolence for Butler. He defined\ncompassion as \u201creal sorrow and concern for the misery of our\nfellow creatures\u201d giving rise to the desire to relieve their\ndistress (Sermon V Note 1). The passion of compassion arose from the\nimaginative ability to substitute another for oneself and thereby to\nbe affected by the distresses of that other with whom one\ncompassionates as towards oneself (Sermon V Note 1). Butler readily\nadmitted that the psychological process that gives rise to compassion\nincluded both pleasure in the fact that we were not suffering the\ndistress as well and awareness of our own susceptibility to the ills\nprompting distress in the object of our compassion. But although the\nprocess of giving rise to compassion also gives rise to and even\nincludes self-partial thoughts, \u201ccompassion\u201d refers\nstrictly to a \u201creal sorrow and concern for the misery of our\nfellow creatures\u201d (Sermon V Note 1). To identify it with a\nself-partial pleasure in the fact that we were not in distress or with\nthe desire to alleviate distress in order to no longer be annoyed by\nit was to be confused about the meaning of word. Although according to\nButler compassion, like any affection, must be governed by reason, the\nmotivation to virtuous actions that compassion gives rise to would not\nbe given rise to by reason alone. Consequently the passion of\ncompassion has a central role in our moral actions. Moreover, the\nprinciple of private self-love is not sufficient to serve our welfare\nwithout compassion, i.e., compassion is an important ingredient in our\nwell being in addition to being an important moral passion. Its\nimportance for our well being can be seen, according to Butler, in the\nfact that those who lack compassion, who have \u201chardness of\nheart,\u201d tend to have diminished happiness due to \u201chardness\nof heart\u201d (Sermon X, \u00a77) blocking the scope and degree of\ntheir happiness.\n\nResentment or anger was somewhat more difficult for Butler to deal\nwith insofar as it was ubiquitous to human beings but conflicted with\nthe Christian command to love our enemies. Butler made two\ndistinctions, between settled (or deliberate) and hasty (or sudden)\nresentment and between resentment raised by non-moral harm or\nresentment raised by moral injury. He further distinguished between\nresentment and the negative passion of malice (although he denies the\nexistence of disinterested, cool, direct ill-will or malice). Hasty\nresentment is an immediate response to \u201cmere harm without\nappearance of wrong or injustice\u201d (Sermon VIII, \u00a76). It can\nbe excessive and misguided, and one can be morally culpable for\nexcessive and misguided expressions of it, but hasty resentment serves\nan important end of self-preservation and care of one\u2019s near and\ndear. Settled resentment is an affection that has moral evil or\ninjustice as its object. Although moral evil gives rise to pain which\ncan strengthen this settled resentment, the object of the resentment\nis not the pain or harm done but instead the design or intention to\nmorally injure, harm, do wrong and injustice. And the goal of\nresentment is to cause appropriate injury in a wrongdoer, not malign\ninjury or revenge that are distinguished from resentment. For Butler,\nsettled resentment has an important moral end in drawing men together\nto pursue justice, in making them fear engendering resentment in\nmankind due to their actions, and to extirpate moral wickedness: it is\n\u201cone of the common bonds by which society is held together; a\nfellow-feeling, which each Individual has in behalf of the whole\nspecies, as well as of himself\u201d (Sermon VIII, \u00a78). Indeed\nButler goes so far as to suggest that communal moral resentment and\nthe justice it gives rise to is what separates us from the state of\nnature where each man is arbiter of his own punishment which quickly\ndevolves into revenge (a point developed further in Six Sermons).\n\nThis raises a central problem for resentment as a moral sentiment or\npassion: unless kept strictly within bounds it devolves into revenge\nand conflicts with benevolence and virtue. Part of the answer is that\nhowever extreme an injury done, and however settled the resentment\nrising in response, the execution of justice does not supersede the\nprior obligation of good will we have to all humans insofar as they\nare capable of happiness and misery. Rather we harm wrong doers to\npreserve \u201cthe quiet and happiness of the world\u201d and this\n\u201cgeneral and more enlarged obligation destroys a more particular\nand confined one of the same kind, inconsistent with it. Guilt and\ninjury then does not dispense with or supersede the duty of\ngoodwill,\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a715). Another part of the answer is\nthat since the proper object is the injustice, to resent\nsomeone\u2019s whole character as opposed to the particular aspect of\ncharacter that gave rise to the harm, i.e. to portray them as wholly\nmonstrous, is to move beyond the appropriate bounds. This pitfall is\neasier to avoid when we recognize our own mixed characters and flaws.\nRelatedly, and perhaps most importantly one must recognize that\nself-partiality is often fueling a desire for revenge against those we\nresent insofar as they have injured us. We ought to attempt to view\ninjuries to us from as distant and unprejudiced a human viewpoint as\npossible \u2014 with full awareness of our own future non-existence\nand final judgment \u2013 and when we do we will be able to recognize\nthat our enemies are as often as not mistaken or acting\ninadvertently.\n\nThe awareness of our own flaws, and our acceptance of the\nnon-existence of cool, disinterested and malign wills as well as our\nrecognition of the ubiquity of mixed characters also gives rise to\ncompassion and the desire to forgive. But notably for Butler\nforgiveness does not entail giving up resentment for moral wrongs\n(Griswold 2008; Garcia 2011). Rather it entails checking inappropriate\nresentment, anger, and revenge, being aware when what appears to be a\nmoral harm is in fact an inadvertent injury whose putative moral\ninjustice is inflated by our own partiality, and treating others who\nharm us with the same compassion that we hold all humans due good-will\nshould be treated (Radzik 2014).\n",
