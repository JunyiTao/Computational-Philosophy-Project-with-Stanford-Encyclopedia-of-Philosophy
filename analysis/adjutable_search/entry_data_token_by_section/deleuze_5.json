    "main_text": "Collaboration with Guattari || Anti-Oedipus\n4.1 Anti-Oedipus\n\nIn considering Anti-Oedipus we should first discuss its\nperformative effect, which attempts to \u201cforce us to\nthink,\u201d that is, to fight against a tendency to clich\u00e9.\nReading Anti-Oedipus can indeed be a shocking experience.\nFirst, we find a bizarre collection of sources; for example, the\nschizophrenic ranting of Antonin Artaud provides one of the basic\nconcepts of the work, the \u201cbody without organs.\u201d Second is\nthe book\u2019s vulgarity, as in the infamous opening lines about the\nunconscious (the Id): \u201cIt is at work everywhere, functioning\nsmoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it\nheats, it eats. It shits and fucks [\u00c7a chie, \u00e7a\nbaise]. What a mistake to have ever said the id\u201d\n(7 / 1). A third performative effect is humor, as in the mocking of\nMelanie Klein\u2019s analysis of children: \u201cSay it\u2019s\nOedipus, or I\u2019ll slap you upside the head [sinon\nt\u2019auras un gifle]\u201d (54 / 45; trans. modified). There\nare many more passages like this; it\u2019s safe to say very few\nphilosophy books contain as many jokes, puns, and double\nentendres as Anti-Oedipus. A fourth element is the\ngleeful coarseness of the polemics. Among many other examples,\nthinkers of the signifier are associated with the lap dogs of tyrants,\nmembers of the French Communist Party are said to have fascist\nlibidinal investments, and Freud is described as a \u201cmasked Al\nCapone.\u201d All in all, the performative effect of reading\nAnti-Oedipus is unforgettable.\n\nPassing to the conceptual structure of the book, the key term of\nAnti-Oedipus is \u201cdesiring-production,\u201d which\ncrisscrosses Marx and Freud, putting desire in the eco-social realm of\nproduction and production in the unconscious realm of desire. Rather\nthan attempting to synthesize Marx and Freud in the usual way, that\nis, by a reductionist strategy that either (1) operates in favor of\nFreud, by positing that the libidinal investment of social figures and\npatterns requires sublimating an original investment in family figures\nand patterns, or (2) operates in favor of Marx by positing neuroses\nand psychoses as mere super-structural by-products of unjust social\nstructures, Deleuze and Guattari will call desiring-production a\n\u201cuniversal primary process\u201d underlying the seemingly\nseparate natural, social and psychological realms. Desiring-production\nis thus not anthropocentric; it is the very heart of the world.\nBesides its universal scope, we need to realize two things about\ndesiring-production right away: (1) there is no subject that lies\nbehind the production, that performs the production; and (2) the\n\u201cdesire\u201d in desiring-production is not oriented to making\nup a lack, but is purely positive. Desiring-production is autonomous,\nself-constituting, and creative: it is the natura naturans of\nSpinoza or the will-to-power of Nietzsche.\n\nAnti-Oedipus is, along with its conceptual and terminological\ninnovation, a work of grand ambitions: among them, (1) an eco-social\ntheory of production, encompassing both sides of the nature/culture\nsplit, which functions as an ontology of change, transformation, or\n\u201cbecoming\u201d; (2) a \u201cuniversal history\u201d of\nsocial formations\u2014the \u201csavage\u201d or tribal, the\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d or imperial, and the capitalist\u2014which\nfunctions as a synthetic social science; (3) and to clear the ground\nfor these functions, a critique of the received versions of Marx and\nFreud\u2014and the attempts to synthesize them by analogizing their\nrealms of application. In pursuing its ambitions,\nAnti-Oedipus has the virtues and the faults of the tour\nde force: unimagined connections between disparate elements are\nmade possible, but at the cost of a somewhat strained conceptual\nscheme.\n\nAnti-Oedipus identifies two primary registers of\ndesiring-production, the natural or \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and the\nsocial or \u201chistorical.\u201d They are related in the following\nway: natural desiring-production is that which social machines\nrepress, but also that which is revealed in capitalism, at the end of\nhistory (a contingent history, that is, one that avoids dialectical\nlaws of history). Capitalism sets free desiring-production even as it\nattempts to rein it in with the institution of private property and\nthe familial or \u201cOedipal\u201d patterning of desire;\nschizophrenics are propelled by the charge of desiring-production thus\nset free but fail at the limits capitalist society proposes, thus\nproviding a clue to the workings of desiring-production.\n\nIt\u2019s important at the start to realize that Deleuze and Guattari\ndo not advocate schizophrenia as a \u201clifestyle\u201d or as the\nmodel for a political program. The schizophrenic, as a clinical\nentity, is the result of the interruption or the blocking of the\nprocess of desiring-production, its having been taken out of nature\nand society and restricted to the body of an individual where it spins\nin the void rather than make the connections that constitute reality.\nDesiring-production does not connect \u201cwith\u201d reality, as in\nescaping a subjective prison to touch the objective, but it makes\nreality, it is the Real, in a twisting of the Lacanian sense of the\nterm. In Lacan, the real is produced as an illusory and retrojected\nremainder to a signifying system; for Deleuze and Guattari, the Real\nis reality itself in its process of self-making. The schizophrenic is\na sick person in need of help, but schizophrenia is an avenue into the\nunconscious, the unconscious not of an individual, but the\n\u201ctranscendental unconscious,\u201d an unconscious that is\nsocial, historical, and natural all at once.\n\nIn studying the schizophrenic process, Deleuze and Guattari posit that\nin both the natural and social registers desiring-production is\ncomposed of three syntheses, the connective, disjunctive, and\nconjunctive; the syntheses perform three functions: production,\nrecording, and enjoyment. We can associate production with the\nphysiological, recording with the semiotic, and enjoyment with the\npsychological registers. While it is important to catch the Kantian\nresonance of \u201csynthesis,\u201d it is equally important to note,\nin keeping with the post-structuralist angle we discussed above, that\nthere is no subject performing the syntheses; instead, subjects are\nthemselves one of the products of the syntheses. The syntheses have no\nunderlying subject; they just are the immanent process of\ndesiring-production. Positing a subject behind the syntheses would be\na transcendent use of the syntheses. Here we see another reference to\nthe Kantian principle of immanence. Deleuze and Guattari propose to\nstudy the immanent use of the syntheses in a \u201cmaterialist\npsychoanalysis,\u201d or \u201cschizoanalysis\u201d; by contrast,\npsychoanalysis is transcendent use of the syntheses, producing five\n\u201cparalogisms\u201d or \u201ctranscendental illusions,\u201d\nall of which involve assigning the characteristics of the extensive\nproperties of actual products to the intensive production process, or,\nto put it in the terms of the philosophy of difference, all the\nparalogisms subordinate differential processes to identities derived\nfrom products.\n\nAccording to the \u201cuniversal history\u201d undertaken in\nAnti-Oedipus, social life has three forms of\n\u201csocius,\u201d the social body that takes credit for\nproduction: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the\nempire, and capital for capitalism. According to Deleuze and\nGuattari\u2019s reading of the anthropological literature, tribal\nsocieties mark bodies in initiation ceremonies, so that the products\nof an organ are traced to a clan, which is mythically traced to the\nearth or, more precisely, one of its enchanted regions, which function\nas the organs on the full body of the earth. Material flows are thus\n\u201cterritorialized,\u201d that is, traced onto the earth, which\nis credited as the source of all production. The signs in tribal\ninscription are not signifiers: they do not map onto a voice, but\nenact a \u201csavage triangle forming \u2026 a theater of cruelty\nthat implies the triple independence of the articulated voice, the\ngraphic hand and the appreciative eye\u201d (189). Empires overcode\nthese tribal meaning codes, tracing production back to the despot, the\ndivine father of his people. Material flows in despotic empires are\nthus \u201cdeterritorialized\u201d (they are no longer credited to\nthe earth), and then immediately \u201creterritorialized\u201d on\nthe body of the despot, who assumes credit for all production. When\ntribal signs are overcoded, the signifier is formed as a\n\u201cdeterritorialized sign\u201d allowing for communication\nbetween the conquered and the conquerors. Signifiers are a\n\u201cflattening\u201d or \u201cbi-univocalization\u201d: two\nchains are lined up, one to one, the written and the spoken\n(205\u20136; cf. Derrida\u2019s notion of\n\u201cphonocentrism\u201d). The body of the despot as imperial\nsocius means that workers are the \u201chands\u201d of the emperor,\nspies are his \u201ceyes,\u201d and so on.\n\nCapitalism is the radical decoding and deterritorialization of the\nmaterial flows that previous social machines had zealously coded on\nthe earth or the body of the despot. Production is credited to the\n\u201cbody\u201d of capital, but this form of recording works by the\nsubstitution of an \u201caxiomatic\u201d for a code: in this context\nan \u201caxiomatic\u201d means a set of simple principles for the\nquantitative calculation of the difference between flows (of\ndeterritorialized labor and capital) rather than elaborate rules for\nthe qualitative judgments that map flows onto the socius.\nCapitalism\u2019s command is utterly simple: connect\ndeterritorialized flows of labor and capital and extract a surplus\nfrom that connection. Thus capitalism sets loose an enormous\nproductive charge\u2014connect those flows! Faster, faster!\u2014the\nsurpluses of which the institutions of private property try to\nregister as belonging to individuals. Now those individuals are\nprimarily social (as figures of capitalist or laborer) and only\nsecondarily private (family members). Whereas organs of bodies were\nsocially marked in previous regimes (as belonging to the clan and\nearth, or as belonging to the emperor, as in the jus primae\nnoctis), body organs are privatized under capitalism and attached\nto persons as members of the family. In Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s\nterms, capitalism\u2019s decoded flows are reterritorialized on\n\u201cpersons,\u201d that is, on family members as figures in the\nOedipal triangle.\n",
