    "main_text": "Murdoch\u2019s Focus on the Active Dimension of Moral Formation\n11. Murdoch\u2019s Focus on the Active Dimension of Moral Formation\n\nWe must therefore look more closely into how Murdoch understands moral\nformation, the creation of agents\u2019 fabric of ethical being. She\nsays that over time our attendings (another term for attempt\nattention) build up the (subjective) structures of value that largely\nconstitute our fabric of being. \n\n\n[I]f we consider what the work of attention is like, how continuously\nit goes on, and how imperceptibly it builds up the structures of value\nround about us\u2026; (IP: 37/329) \n\n[O]ur ability to act well \u201cwhen the time comes\u201d depends\npartly, perhaps largely, upon the quality of our habitual objects of\nattention. (OGG: 56/345; see also 67/354, 69/356,\n 91f/375)[7]\n\n\nMurdoch is implying that by our efforts of attending to various\nobjects (attempt attention), especially other persons, bringing them\ninto our active mental universe, we build up the evaluative structures\nof our subjectively experienced or perceived world, and create our\nfabric of ethical being. This sets the stage for attempts at loving\nattention and (less frequent) successes in proffering such loving\nattention.\n\nBut the idea that our fabric of being and subjective structures of\nvalue are built up almost solely or even primarily through acts of\nattempt attention seems at odds with Murdoch\u2019s\nFreudian/Kantian/Schopenhauerian moral psychology, which implies that\nthe main forces creating our fabric of being are fantasies, other\ndistortions, and egoistic desires infrequently aligned with moral ways\nof being. These do indeed build up structures of value and ways of\nperceiving reality. They are not merely forces operating in a\nmechanical way on the agent\u2019s will, pulling her away from moral\naction and perception, although this dualistic image is one Murdoch\noften employs for the human psyche. But the values and ways of\nperceiving built up by these forces are usually morally bad or at\nleast unworthy. An example from Murdoch\u2019s novels is Julius King,\nthe character referred to earlier, who sees many other persons in a\nparticular way, contemptuously\u2014Murdoch somewhat implies that he\nis morally damaged from being a concentration camp survivor\u2014and\noften treats his acquaintances and even friends in a malicious and\ncontemptuous way, arising from the valuational framework (part of his\nfabric of ethical being) within which he views them (FHD 1970).\nAlthough Murdoch\u2019s predominant view of the psyche implies that\negoistic forces do much to create our fabric of being, within which\nour capability for success attention comprises but a weak reed, she\ndoes not actually adopt this view. Rather she takes the view that our\nactive, deliberate attendings (attempt attention) are the prime source\nof our subjective structures of value and fabric of moral being.\n\nThus Murdoch\u2019s stated view privileges what can be seen as the\nactive dimension of value or moral formation, while her theory of the\npsyche should have pointed her (also) toward the passive aspects\nthereof. Cora Diamond suggests that the \u201cfabric of being\u201d\nmetaphor mixes active and passive (Diamond 2010: 72). And in a 1966\nessay, \u201cThe Darkness of Practical Reason\u201d, Murdoch\ncriticizes Hampshire for an overly sharp distinction between passive\naspects of mental life (represented by desires and fears that are not\nthought-dependent) and the active choosing will, aided by\nreason\u2019s surveying the facts of the agent\u2019s situation\nenabled by an active stepping back from that situation, that decides\nand takes action (DPR 1966/EM: 201). She sees (attempt)\nattention, and also imagination, as falling into neither of these\ncategories. So in this particular \u201cactive/passive\u201d\nframework attempt attention does not fall in the \u201cactive\u201d\ncategory.\n\nNevertheless, Murdoch still sees moral agents as in genuine if limited\ncontrol of their attendings. In this sense, attempt attention does\nfall into the \u201cactive\u201d category, thus contrasting with the\naction-centric view of agency and freedom she criticizes in existentialist and analytic moral philosophies and\npsychologies. This attempt attention contrasts with the Freudian\nintrapsychic forces that contribute to our moral formation without\nengaging our agency in that way. And at least in one place she\nrecognizes a form of passivity that is connected with a person\u2019s\nfabric of being, in contrast with aspects of our mental or psychic\nuniverse that are not. In discussing Hampshire, she attributes to him\nrecognition that a Freudian explanation or understanding of, say, a\nfear \n\n\nenables us to attach the fear intelligibly to a more clearly seen\nstructure of motivation which we may endorse or at any rate accept as\nours. (DPR 1966/EM: 196) \n\n\nThis contrasts with a fear that besieges us but whose character we\nrepudiate, or at least do not accept. Thus Murdoch\u2019s view that\nour attendings shape our moral formation and world of perceived values\ndraws on a view of activity reduced in scope from the Hampshirean\nconcept, yet still distinguishable from a form of passivity that she\nrecognizes (at least here) as part of our moral being. It is in this\nsense of \u201cactive\u201d that she privileges the active (attempt\nattendings) over the passive in her explicit account of the formation\nof our fabric of moral being, resulting in the passive dimension not\nreceiving adequate attention (Blum 2012).\n",
