    "main_text": "Computability and Church\u2019s Thesis || The External Evidence\n1.4 The External Evidence\n\nThe classic account of the external evidence for\n CT1\n is by Kleene (1952: 318\u2013323). Kleene organizes the evidence\nunder four headings:\n\n(A)\nHeuristic evidence,\n(B)\nEquivalence of diverse formulations,\n(C)\nTuring\u2019s concept of a Turing machine, and\n(D)\nSymbolic logics and symbolic algorithms.\n\n\n(A) is the fact that large families of functions had been shown to be\n\u03bb-definable and hence recursive. (B) is the striking fact that\nthe various mathematically precise counterparts of\ncomputability\u2014\u03bb-definability, recursiveness, Turing\ncomputability and others of the period due to G\u00f6del and\nPost\u2014despite being technically quite different from one\nanother\u2014turn out to lead to the same class of functions. (Not\neveryone is impressed by this \u201cconfluence\u201d of definitions;\ncf. Kreisel 1987.) As for (C), Kleene observes that Turing\u2019s\nanalysis constitutes a direct attempt to give a mathematical account\nof the actions of a human computor and thus differs from the other\nanalyses (in terms of recursiveness and \u03bb-definability), which\n\u201carose differently\u201d. He remarks that Turing\u2019s\nidentification of intuitive computability with computability by a\n(Turing) machine constitutes an \u201cindependent statement of\nChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d. For this reason\n CT1\n has come to be known as the Church-Turing Thesis. Both Church (1937b)\nand Kleene (1952) also note that Post (1936) independently gives an\nanalysis very similar to Turing\u2019s. Perhaps, then, CT1 should\nproperly be known as the Church-Turing-Post-Thesis.\n\nKleene\u2019s (D) consists of the two arguments mentioned earlier by\nChurch (1936a: section 7). The first argument is that the notion of\ncomputation by means of an algorithm does not lead outside the class\nof recursive functions (cf. Shoenfield [1967: 120] for an argument of\nthe same sort). The second of these concerns the relation between\nrecursive functions and formal systems of \u201csymbolic\nlogic\u201d. Church argues that in any such system whose set of\ntheorems is recursively enumerable, if \\(f\\) is a unary\n(\u201csingulary\u201d is Church\u2019s term) function of positive\nintegers and if it is true that \n\\[\\tag{*} f(m) = n,\\]\n\n\nfor integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), then (in essence) \\((*)\\) is provable in\nthe system; and if \\((*)\\) is false, then it is not provable in the\nsystem, then \\(f\\) is recursive. See\n supplement A.2\n for a more detailed discussion of this controversial\nargument\u2014controversial because Church simply assumes\nthat the set of axioms and rules of a symbolic logic must be\nrecursive, and this has seemed to some to beg the question of the\ntruth of\n CT1\n and thus to constitute a \u201cstumbling block\u201d to the\nacceptance of Church\u2019s argument (Sieg 1997).\n",
