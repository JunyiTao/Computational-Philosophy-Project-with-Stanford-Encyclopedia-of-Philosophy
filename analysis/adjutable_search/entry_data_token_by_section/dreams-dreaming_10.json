This\ncan mean dream imagery involves imaginings rather than percepts\n(including hallucinations or illusions; McGinn 2004), that dream\nbeliefs are imaginative and not real beliefs (Sosa 2007), or both\n(Ichikawa 2008, 2009). An important advantage is that by assimilating\ndreams to commonplace mental states such as waking fantasy and\ndaydreaming, rather than a rare and often pathological occurrence such\nas hallucinations, it provides a more unified account of mental life\n(Stone 1984). However, the reasons for adopting the imagination view\nare diverse, and dreams have been proposed to resemble imaginings and\ndiffer from perception along a number of dimensions (e.g. McGinn 2004,\n2005a,b; Thomas 2014). This issue is complicated by the fact that\nthere is little agreement on the definition of imagination and its\nrelation to perception (Kind 2013).\n\nOne way is to deny dreams involve presence or the feeling of being in\na world, which many believe is central to waking perception.\nImagination theorists compare the sense in which we feel present in\nour dreams to cognitive absorption, as when we are lost in a novel,\nfilm, or vivid daydream (Sartre 1940; McGinn 2004; but see Hering\n1947; Globus 1987). Some argue that reflexive consciousness or\nmeta-awareness (as in lucid dreams) interrupts cognitive absorption\nand terminates the ongoing dream (Sartre 1940), essentially denying\nlucid dreams are possible.\n\nAnother issue is whether dreams are subject to the will\n(Ichikawa 2009). Imagination is often characterized as active and\nunder our control (Wittgenstein 1967: 621, 633), involving \u201ca\nspecial effort of the mind\u201d (Descartes 1641: VI, 2), whereas\nperception is passive. Because dreams just seem to happen to us\nwithout being under voluntary control, they present an important\nchallenge for the imagination view. Ichikawa (2009) argues lucid\ncontrol dreams show dreams are generally subject to the will even\nwhere they are not under deliberate control.\n\nDreams are widely described as more indeterminate than waking\nperception (James 1890: 47; Stone 1984). In scientific dream research,\nvagueness is regarded as one of three main subtypes of bizarreness\n(Hobson 1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). An example are dream\ncharacters who are identified not by their behavior or looks, but by\njust knowing (Kahn et al. 2000, 2002; Revonsuo & Tarkko\n2002). Dreams are also attention-dependent and lack\nforeground-background structure (Thompson 2014); while it is tempting\nto construe the dream world as rich in detail, there is no more to\ndreams than meets the eye, and many think dream experience is\nexhausted by what is the focus of selective attention (Hunter 1983;\nThompson 2014).\n\nIndeterminacy is also related to the question of whether we dream in\ncolor or in black and white. Based on a review of historical and\nrecent studies, Schwitzgebel (2002, 2011) argues there has been a\nshift in theories on dream color that coincides with the rise first of\nblack-and-white and then color television. He argues it is unlikely\nthat dreams themselves changed from colored to black and white and\nback to colored, proposing that a change in opinion is a more\nplausible explanation. Maybe dreams were either black and white or\ncolored all along; or maybe they are indeterminate with respect to\ncolor, as may be the case for imagined or fictional objects; were this\nthe case, it would strengthen the imagination view (Ichikawa 2009).\nSchwitzgebel\u2019s main point is that reports of colored dreaming are\nunreliable and our opinions about dreams can be mistaken (but see\nWindt 2013, 2015a). This relates to Schwitzgebel\u2019s (2011; Hurlburt\n& Schwitzgebel 2007) general skepticism about the reliability of\nintrospection.\n\nThe issue of dream color has led to a number of follow-up studies\n(Schwitzgebel 2003; Schwitzgebel et al. 2006; Murzyn 2008; Schredl et\nal. 2008; Hoss 2010). They suggest most people dream in color and a\nsmall percentage describe grayscale or even mixed dreams (Murzyn 2008)\nor dreams involving moderate color saturation (Rechtschaffen and\nBuchignani 1992). Indeterminacy is rarely reported.\n\nThe imagination view has consequences for Cartesian dream skepticism.\nIf dream pain does not feel like real pain, there is a fail-safe way\nto determine whether one is now dreaming: one need only pinch oneself\n(Nelson 1966; Stone 1984; but see Hodges & Carter 1969; Kantor\n1970). As Locke put it,\n\n\nif our dreamer pleases to try, whether the glowing heat of a glass\nfurnace, be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man\u2019s\nfancy, by putting his hand into it, he may perhaps be wakened into a\ncertainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than\nbare imagination. (Locke 1689: IV.XI.8) \n\n\nIf dreaming feels different from waking, this raises the question why\nwe tend to describe dreams in the same terms as waking perception.\nMaybe this is because most people haven\u2019t thought about these matters\nand they would find the imagination view plausible if they considered\nit (Ichikawa 2009). Or maybe\n\n\nit is just because we all know that dreams are throughout\nunlike waking experiences that we can safely use ordinary\nexpressions in the narration of them. (Austin 1962: 42) \n\n\nSome authors classify dreams as imaginings while acknowledging they\nfeel like perceiving. For example, Hobbes describes dreams as\n\u201cthe imaginations of them that sleep\u201d (Hobbes 1651: 90),\nand imagination as a \u201cdecaying sense\u201d (Hobbes\n1651: 88). Yet he also uses the concepts of imagination and fancy to\ndescribe perception and argues \u201ctheir appearance to us is Fancy,\nthe same waking, that dreaming\u201d (Hobbes 1651: 86).\n\nIn the scientific literature, the imagination view is complemented by\ncognitive theories. Foulkes (1978: 5) describes dreaming as a form of\nthinking with its own grammar and syntax, but allows that dream\nimagery is sufficently perception-like to deceive us. Domhoff\u2019s\nneurocognitive model of dreaming (2001, 2003) emphasizes the\ndependence of dreaming on visuospatial skills and on a network\nincluding the association areas of the forebrain. The theory draws\nfrom findings on the partial or global cessation of dreaming following\nbrain lesions (cf. Solms 1997, 2000), evidence that dreaming develops\ngradually and in tandem with visuospatial skills in children (Foulkes\n1993a, 1999; but see Resnick et al. 1994), and results from dream\ncontent analysis supporting the continuity of dreaming with waking\nconcerns and memories (the so-called continuity hypothesis;\nsee Domhoff 2001, 2003; Schredl & Hofmann 2003; Schredl 2006; see\nalso Nir & Tononi 2010).\n",
