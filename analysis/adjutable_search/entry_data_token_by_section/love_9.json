    "main_text": "Emotion Views || Love as Emotion Complex\n5.2 Love as Emotion Complex\n\nThe emotion complex view, which understands love to be a complex\nemotional attitude towards another person, may initially seem to hold\nout great promise to overcome the problems of alternative types of\nviews. By articulating the emotional interconnections between persons,\nit could offer a satisfying account of the \u201cdepth\u201d of love\nwithout the excesses of the union view and without the overly narrow\nteleological focus of the robust concern view; and because these\nemotional interconnections are themselves evaluations, it could offer\nan understanding of love as simultaneously evaluative, without needing\nto specify a single formal object of love. However, the devil is in\nthe details.\n\nRorty\n (1986/1993) does not try to present a complete account of love;\nrather, she focuses on the idea that \u201crelational psychological\nattitudes\u201d which, like love, essentially involve emotional and\ndesiderative responses, exhibit historicity: \u201cthey\narise from, and are shaped by, dynamic interactions between a subject\nand an object\u201d (p. 73). In part this means that what makes an\nattitude be one of love is not the presence of a state that we can\npoint to at a particular time within the lover; rather, love is to be\n\u201cidentified by a characteristic narrative history\u201d (p.\n75). Moreover, Rorty argues, the historicity of love involves the\nlover\u2019s being permanently transformed by loving who he does.\n\nBaier (1991), seeming to pick up on this understanding of love as\nexhibiting historicity, says (p. 444):\n\nLove is not just an emotion people feel toward other people, but also\na complex tying together of the emotions that two or a few more people\nhave; it is a special form of emotional interdependence.\n\n\nTo a certain extent, such emotional interdependence involves feeling\nsympathetic emotions, so that, for example, I feel disappointed and\nfrustrated on behalf of my beloved when she fails, and joyful when she\nsucceeds. However, Baier insists, love is \u201cmore than just the\nduplication of the emotion of each in a sympathetic echo in the\nother\u201d (p. 442); the emotional interdependence of the lovers\ninvolves also appropriate follow-up responses to the emotional\npredicaments of your beloved. Two examples Baier gives (pp.\n443\u201344) are a feeling of \u201cmischievous delight\u201d at\nyour beloved\u2019s temporary bafflement, and amusement at her\nembarrassment. The idea is that in a loving relationship your beloved\ngives you permission to feel such emotions when no one else is\npermitted to do so, and a condition of her granting you that\npermission is that you feel these emotions \u201ctenderly.\u201d\nMoreover, you ought to respond emotionally to your beloved\u2019s\nemotional responses to you: by feeling hurt when she is indifferent to\nyou, for example. All of these foster the sort of emotional\ninterdependence Baier is after\u2014a kind of intimacy you have with\nyour beloved.\n\nBadhwar (2003, p. 46) similarly understands love to be a matter of\n\u201cone\u2019s overall emotional orientation towards a\nperson\u2014the complex of perceptions, thoughts, and\nfeelings\u201d; as such, love is a matter of having a certain\n\u201ccharacter structure.\u201d Central to this complex emotional\norientation, Badhwar thinks, is what she calls the \u201clook of\nlove\u201d: \u201can ongoing [emotional] affirmation of the loved\nobject as worthy of existence\u2026for her own sake\u201d (p. 44),\nan affirmation that involves taking pleasure in your beloved\u2019s\nwell-being. Moreover, Badhwar claims, the look of love also provides\nto the beloved reliable testimony concerning the quality of the\nbeloved\u2019s character and actions (p. 57).\n\nThere is surely something very right about the idea that love, as an\nattitude central to deeply personal relationships, should not be\nunderstood as a state that can simply come and go. Rather, as the\nemotion complex view insists, the complexity of love is to be found in\nthe historical patterns of one\u2019s emotional responsiveness to\none\u2019s beloved\u2014a pattern that also projects into the\nfuture. Indeed, as suggested above, the kind of emotional\ninterdependence that results from this complex pattern can seem to\naccount for the intuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love as fully\ninterwoven into one\u2019s emotional sense of oneself. And it seems\nto make some headway in understanding the complex phenomenology of\nlove: love can at times be a matter of intense pleasure in the\npresence of one\u2019s beloved, yet it can at other times involve\nfrustration, exasperation, anger, and hurt as a manifestation of the\ncomplexities and depth of the relationships it fosters.\n\nThis understanding of love as constituted by a history of emotional\ninterdependence enables emotion complex views to say something\ninteresting about the impact love has on the lover\u2019s identity.\nThis is partly Rorty\u2019s point (1986/1993) in her discussion of\nthe historicity of love\n (above).\n Thus, she argues, one important feature of such historicity is that\nlove is \u201cdynamically permeable\u201d in that the lover\nis continually \u201cchanged by loving\u201d such that these changes\n\u201ctend to ramify through a person\u2019s character\u201d (p.\n77). Through such dynamic permeability, love transforms the identity\nof the lover in a way that can sometimes foster the continuity of the\nlove, as each lover continually changes in response to the changes in\nthe\n other.[14]\n Indeed, Rorty concludes, love should be understood in terms of\n\u201ca characteristic narrative history\u201d (p. 75) that results\nfrom such dynamic permeability. It should be clear, however, that the\nmere fact of dynamic permeability need not result in the love\u2019s\ncontinuing: nothing about the dynamics of a relationship requires that\nthe characteristic narrative history project into the future, and such\npermeability can therefore lead to the dissolution of the love. Love\nis therefore risky\u2014indeed, all the more risky because of the way\nthe identity of the lover is defined in part through the love. The\nloss of a love can therefore make one feel no longer oneself in ways\npoignantly described by Nussbaum (1990).\n\nBy focusing on such emotionally complex histories, emotion complex\nviews differ from most alternative accounts of love. For alternative\naccounts tend to view love as a kind of attitude we take toward our\nbeloveds, something we can analyze simply in terms of our mental state\nat the\n moment.[15]\n By ignoring this historical dimension of love in providing an account\nof what love is, alternative accounts have a hard time providing\neither satisfying accounts of the sense in which our identities as\nperson are at stake in loving another or satisfactory solutions to\nproblems concerning how love is to be justified (cf.\n Section 6,\n especially the discussion of\n fungibility).\n\nNonetheless, some questions remain. If love is to be understood as an\nemotion complex, we need a much more explicit account of the pattern\nat issue here: what ties all of these emotional responses together\ninto a single thing, namely love? Baier and Badhwar seem content to\nprovide interesting and insightful examples of this pattern, but that\ndoes not seem to be enough. For example, what connects my amusement at\nmy beloved\u2019s embarrassment to other emotions like my joy on his\nbehalf when he succeeds? Why shouldn\u2019t my amusement at his\nembarrassment be understood instead as a somewhat cruel case of\nschadenfreude and so as antithetical to, and disconnected\nfrom, love? Moreover, as Naar (2013) notes, we need a principled\naccount of when such historical patterns are disrupted in such a way\nas to end the love and when they are not. Do I stop loving when, in\nthe midst of clinical depression, I lose my normal pattern of\nemotional concern?\n\nPresumably the answer requires returning to the historicity of love:\nit all depends on the historical details of the relationship my\nbeloved and I have forged. Some loves develop so that the intimacy\nwithin the relationship is such as to allow for tender, teasing\nresponses to each other, whereas other loves may not. The historical\ndetails, together with the lovers\u2019 understanding of their\nrelationship, presumably determine which emotional responses belong to\nthe pattern constitutive of love and which do not. However, this\nanswer so far is inadequate: not just any historical relationship\ninvolving emotional interdependence is a loving relationship, and we\nneed a principled way of distinguishing loving relationships from\nother relational evaluative attitudes: precisely what is the\ncharacteristic narrative history that is characteristic of love?\n\nHelm (2009, 2010) tries to answer some of these questions in\npresenting an account of love as intimate identification. To love\nanother, Helm claims, is to care about him as the particular person he\nis and so, other things being equal, to value the things he values.\nInsofar as a person\u2019s (structured) set of values\u2014his sense\nof the kind of life worth his living\u2014constitutes his\nidentity as a person, such sharing of values amounts to\nsharing his identity, which sounds very much like union accounts of\nlove. However, Helm is careful to understand such sharing of values as\nfor the sake of the beloved (as robust concern accounts insist), and\nhe spells this all out in terms of patterns of emotions. Thus, Helm\nclaims, all emotions have not only a target and a formal object (as\nindicated above), but also a focus: a background object the\nsubject cares about in terms of which the implicit evaluation of the\ntarget is made intelligible. (For example, if I am afraid of the\napproaching hailstorm, I thereby evaluate it as dangerous, and what\nexplains this evaluation is the way that hailstorm bears on my\nvegetable garden, which I care about; my garden, therefore, is the\nfocus of my fear.) Moreover, emotions normally come in patterns with a\ncommon focus: fearing the hailstorm is normally connected to other\nemotions as being relieved when it passes by harmlessly (or\ndisappointed or sad when it does not), being angry at the rabbits for\nkilling the spinach, delighted at the productivity of the tomato\nplants, etc. Helm argues that a projectible pattern of such emotions\nwith a common focus constitute caring about that focus. Consequently,\nwe might say along the lines of\n Section 4.3,\n while particular emotions appraise events in the world as having\ncertain evaluative properties, their having these properties is partly\nbestowed on them by the overall patterns of emotions.\n\nHelm identifies some emotions as person-focused emotions:\nemotions like pride and shame that essentially take persons as their\nfocuses, for these emotions implicitly evaluate in terms of the\ntarget\u2019s bearing on the quality of life of the person that is\ntheir focus. To exhibit a pattern of such emotions focused on oneself\nand subfocused on being a mother, for example, is to care about the\nplace being a mother has in the kind of life you find worth\nliving\u2014in your identity as a person; to care in this way is to\nvalue being a mother as a part of your concern for your own\nidentity. Likewise, to exhibit a projectible pattern of such emotions\nfocused on someone else and subfocused on his being a father is to\nvalue this as a part of your concern for his\nidentity\u2014to value it for his sake. Such sharing of\nanother\u2019s values for his sake, which, Helm argues, essentially\ninvolves trust, respect, and affection, amounts to intimate\nidentification with him, and such intimate identification just is\nlove. Thus, Helm tries to provide an account of love that is grounded\nin an explicit account of caring (and caring about something for the\nsake of someone else) that makes room for the intuitive\n\u201cdepth\u201d of love through intimate identification.\n\nJaworska & Wonderly (2017) argue that Helm\u2019s construal of\nintimacy as intimate identification is too demanding. Rather, they\nargue, the sort of intimacy that distinguishes love from mere caring\nis one that involves a kind of emotional vulnerability in which things\ngoing well or poorly for one\u2019s beloved are directly connected\nnot merely to one\u2019s well-being, but to one\u2019s ability to\nflourish. This connection, they argue, runs through the lover\u2019s\nself-understanding and the place the beloved has in the lover\u2019s\nsense of a meaningful life.\n",
