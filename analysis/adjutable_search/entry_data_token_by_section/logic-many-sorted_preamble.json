    "main_text": "\n\nClassical logic is the appropriate formal language for describing\nmathematical structures containing a single universe or domain of\ndiscourse. By contrast, many-sorted logic (MSL) allows quantification\nover a variety of domains (called sorts). For this reason, it is a\nsuitable vehicle for dealing with statements concerning different\ntypes of objects, which are ubiquitous in mathematics, philosophy,\ncomputer science, and formal semantics. Each sort groups a unique\ncategory of objects (for example, points and straight lines are\ndifferent types of objects in a 2-sorted structure).\n\nDespite the addition of this expressive resource, many-sorted logic\n\u201cstays inside\u201d first-order logic, so the main metatheorems\n(completeness, interpolation, and so on) can be proved. Many-sorted\nlogic also serves as a unifying framework for translating various\nlogical systems; for instance, some intensional and higher-order\nlogics have natural translations into many-sorted logic. Many-sorted\nfirst-order logic can be reduced to one-sorted first-order logic, both\nsyntactically and semantically. Many-sorted first-order logic can also\nbe extended to a many-sorted second-order logic called \u201csort\nlogic\u201d.\n\nAn axiomatic calculus for many-sorted logic was introduced by Hao Wang\nin Wang (1952), where he made a comparison between one-sorted and\nmany-sorted theories. In 1967, Solomon Feferman gave a sequent\ncalculus for many-sorted logic, proving not only its completeness but\nalso the cut elimination and interpolation theorems (Feferman\n1968). Feferman (2008) summarizes some applications of the many-sorted\ninterpolation theorems to model theory. (See the\n supplement on early history\n for more information.)\n\nSection 1 lays out the basics of many-sorted logic, presenting some\nexamples and explaining how the formal language, structures, and\nsemantics differ or not from classical logic. Section 2 explains how\nto modify a one-sorted first-order calculus to obtain a many-sorted\nversion; also, completeness is treated and some automated theorem\nprovers are mentioned. Section 3 describes a plan on which many-sorted\nlogic serves as a common framework for translating a variety of\nlogical systems. Sections 4 and 5 apply this plan to second-order\nlogic and non-classical logics (modal and dynamic logic),\nrespectively. Finally, section 6 comments on further results in\nmany-sorted logic.\n",
