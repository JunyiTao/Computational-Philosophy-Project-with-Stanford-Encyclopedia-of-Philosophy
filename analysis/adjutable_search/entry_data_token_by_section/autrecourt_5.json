    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n6. Natural Philosophy\n\n\nThe point of departure for Autrecourt\u2019s physics is a thesis which\nstrikes him as more probable than its opposite, namely that all things\nare eternal. Autrecourt assures the reader that he is speaking as a\nnatural philosopher, and that he is not contradicting Catholic\nfaith. One of the implications of his thesis is that there is no\ngeneration or corruption in the universe. Autrecourt refutes\nAverroes\u2019s (and Aristotle\u2019s) doctrine of prime matter in which\nsubstantial forms are generated and corrupted. He replaces the theory\nof hylemorphism, which attributes the coming-to-be and passing-away of\nproperties and of objects to forms that begin and cease to exist in\nmatter, by atomism. Change in the natural world is caused by the\nmovement of atoms. These atoms are to be understood as infinitely\nsmall parcels of matter which have properties.\n\n\nAs Autrecourt explicitly indicates, his discussion of the eternity of\nthings is linked to his views on motion and on atomism. For this\nreason, he places the section on the divisibility of matter in between\nhis treatment of eternity and of motion, \u201cbecause some of the points\nto be raised about indivisibles will prepare us for the question of\nmovement\u201d. What Autrecourt means is that a number of arguments about\nthe divisibility of space and time involve moving objects.\n\n\nAutrecourt opens his discussion of atoms or indivisibles by restating\nAristotle\u2019s position that no continuum is composed of indivisibles. He\npresents five arguments in support of this thesis, and places beside\nthem his own counterarguments, which are meant to prove \u201cwith\nsufficient probability\u201d the opposite conclusion. The section makes\nclear that Autrecourt is familiar with the contemporary debates at\nParis about the divisibility of the continuum. It is not possible,\nhowever, to identify his opponents, and at times his discussion lacks\ncoherence. In keeping with this atomistic view, he also holds that\nspace and time consist of indivisible units, viz., points and\ninstants, respectively.\n\n\nThe discussion of motion, which focuses on its ontological status, is\nplaced in the larger context of a discussion of quantity. The reason\nis, that motion is one particular type of quantity, namely successive\nquantity (as distinct from permanent quantity). Autrecourt argues that\nmaterial substance and its quantity are not distinct. The same holds\ntrue for other characteristic properties of a substance, the sensible\nqualities: they are not distinct from their substance. Autrecourt\nclaims, for instance, that fire and its heat and water and its\ncoldness are not distinct. At the background of this section is the\nlate-medieval debate about the basic ontological categories, induced\nby Aristotle\u2019s Categories and Metaphysics. Given\nthese preliminaries, it comes as no surprise that Autrecourt also\ndefends the thesis that motion is not distinct from the mobile\nobject.\n\n\nAutrecourt argues that motion is not a thing distinct from the\nmoving object. Following Ockham, he rejects the idea that motion is a\npositive thing inhering in the mobile object. Thus, the loss of motion\nshould not be described as the destruction or corruption of an entity,\nand the eternity doctrine is saved.\n",
