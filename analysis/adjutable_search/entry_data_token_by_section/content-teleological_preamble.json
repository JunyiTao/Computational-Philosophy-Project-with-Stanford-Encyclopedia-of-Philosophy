    "main_text": "\n\nConsider, for example, the thought that blossoms are forming. On a\nrepresentational theory of thought, this involves a representation of\nblossoms forming. A theory of mental content aims to tell us, among\nother things, why this representation has this content, and so why it\nis a thought about blossoms forming, rather than about the sun\nshining, pigs flying, or nothing at all. In general, a theory of\nmental content tries to explain why mental states, events or processes\n(or, assuming a representational theory of them, the mental\nrepresentations involved) count as having the contents they have.\n\nAccording to teleological theories, the contents of mental\nrepresentations depend, at least in part, on functions, such as the\nfunctions of the systems that use or produce them. The relevant notion\nof function is held to be one used in biology and neurobiology in\nattributing functions to items, as in \u201ca function of the pineal\ngland is secreting melatonin\u201d and \u201ca function of brain\narea MT is processing information about motion\u201d. Proponents of\nteleological theories of mental content usually understand these\nfunctions to be what the items with the functions were selected for,\neither by phylogenetic natural selection or by some other similar\nprocess.\n",
