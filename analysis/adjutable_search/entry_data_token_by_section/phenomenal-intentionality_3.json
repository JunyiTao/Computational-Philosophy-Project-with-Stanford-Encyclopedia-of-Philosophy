    "main_text": "The phenomenal intentionality theory || Grounding, Identity, and Reductive PIT\n2.3 Grounding, Identity, and Reductive PIT\n\nOur definition of phenomenal intentional states is neutral between two\ntypes of views regarding how phenomenal states constitute intentional\nstates. On grounding views, phenomenal intentional states are\ngrounded in phenomenal states (either in individual states or in sets\nof such states). Since grounding is asymmetric, this view implies that\nphenomenal intentional states are distinct from the phenomenal states\nthat ground them. In contrast, identity views take the\nrelation that obtains between phenomenal intentional states and\nphenomenal states (in virtue of which the former are constituted by\nthe latter) to be that of identity: certain instantiations of\nintentional properties are identical to instantiations of phenomenal\nproperties. On this view, phenomenal intentional states are identical\nto individual phenomenal states or sets of phenomenal states. \n\nFarkas (2008a,b), Pitt (2004) (though not in Pitt 2009), and Woodward (2016, forthcoming-a) defend a\ngrounding version of PIT. It is also possible to read Horgan and\nTienson (2002) as holding a grounding version of PIT, since they take\nthe relevant relation between phenomenal intentionality and phenomenal\nconsciousness to be that of \u201cconstitutive determination\u201d,\nwhich might be understood as a kind of grounding relation. Other\nproponents of PIT, such as Mendelovici (2018), favor an identity view. \n\nWe can also distinguish between versions of PIT that are reductive and\nversions that are not. To a first approximation, a theory of\nintentionality is reductive if it specifies the nature of\nintentionality in terms that are supposed to be more basic or\nfundamental. A theory that is not reductive\nmight either be neutral on the question of reduction or incompatible with\nreduction. \n\nAll grounding versions of (Moderate or Strong) PIT are reductive. Such\nviews entail that all intentionality is ultimately grounded in\nphenomenal states. Since grounding is asymmetric, the grounding\nphenomenal states cannot themselves be intentional and are more\nfundamental than intentional states. \nAn identity version of (Moderate\nor Strong) PIT will be reductive if it holds or entails that\nphenomenal intentional states are identical to phenomenal states and\nthat phenomenal descriptions are more fundamental than intentional\ndescriptions (just as \u201cH2O\u201d descriptions are\nmore fundamental than \u201cwater\u201d descriptions). If such views\nare correct, it should be possible to understand phenomenal states\nindependently of intentionality.\n\nVersions of (Moderate or Strong) PIT that identify phenomenal intentional\nstates with phenomenal states can also be nonreductive. On such\nnonreductive views, phenomenal descriptions of intentional states are\nnot more fundamental then intentional descriptions. Exactly which\nversions of PIT that identify phenomenal intentional states with\nphenomenal states are reductive or nonreductive is an open\nquestion.\n\nRegardless of whether PIT provides a reductive account of\nintentionality in general, versions of Moderate PIT that allow for\nnon-phenomenal intentional states aim to reduce such states to\nphenomenal intentionality and other ingredients, so they provide a\nreductive account of at least some intentional states. We will discuss\nsome of these views below.\n",
