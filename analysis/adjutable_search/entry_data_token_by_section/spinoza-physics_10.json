    "main_text": "Individuation of bodies and the variety in matter || Individuation by essence\n5.3 Individuation by essence\n\nIn the previous sub-section, we saw reasons for doubting the adequacy\nof readings that treat the PI's talk of motion and rest as\nconstituting his entire account of \n  individuation.[11]\nThis section considers an\nalternative interpretation of Spinoza's approach to individuation.\nThis account appeals to the notion of individuating essences.\n\nIn IId2 Spinoza says:\n\nto the essence of a thing belongs that which, being given, the thing\nis necessarily posited and which, being taken away, the thing is\nnecessarily taken away; or that without which the thing can neither be\nnor be conceived, and which can neither be nor be conceived without\nthe thing.\n\n\nThis does not quite offer a definition of \u201cessence\u201d, but\nrather defines what belongs to it. IId2 speaks of the essences of\n\u201cthings.\u201d Individuals, or singular things, are surely\nthings. If what belongs to the essence of an individual is given (by\n\u201cgiven\u201d Spinoza means \u201cposited as existing\u201d),\nthen so too is the individual. This suggests that the essence of an\nindividual is particular to that individual, since otherwise, what\nbelongs to it could be given without that individual being posited, so\nlong as some other individual with that essence were\n posited.[12]\n\nBut how are we to conceive essences, and how can they help solve the\nproblems we have encountered with claiming the PI, with its talk of\nmotion and rest, provides Spinoza's full account of individuation? In\nthe Preface to Ethics Part IV, Spinoza writes:\n\nWhen I say that someone passes from a lesser to a greater perfection,\nand the opposite, I do not understand that he is changed from one\nessence, or form, to another\u2026 . Rather, we conceive that his\npower of acting, insofar as it is understood through his nature, is\nincreased or diminished.\n\n\nHere Spinoza writes as if a body's essence and its form are one and\nthe same. In each of PIl4, 5 and 6, Spinoza speaks of bodily\npersistence in terms of its parts keeping the same ratio of motion and\nrest. If the parts do so, the body, says Spinoza \u201cwill retain\nits nature, as before, with no change of form\u201d\n(emphasis added). PIl7 also speaks of a body's retaining its\n\u201cnature\u201d, despite change. These are plainly meant to state\nconditions on individual persistence. These lemmas seem to equate\nnature and form. So by transitivity of identity, form=nature=essence.\nMoreover, Spinoza implies that so long as this form or essence is\nretained, a thing is not destroyed. \u201cForm\u201d,\n\u201cnature\u201d and \u201cessence\u201d than, refer to\nsomething in virtue of the persistence of which an individual retains\nits identity.\n\nIn a series of propositions leading up to and supporting IIIp6's\narticulation of the conatus doctrine, Spinoza also treats\n\u201cessence\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d as synonyms, and\nassigns them to things independently of the attribute under which they\nare considered. IIIp4 is worthy of particular attention here. It\nstates: \u201cNo thing can be destroyed except through an external\ncause\u201d. Garrett (2002) persuasively argues that\n\u201cexternal\u201d here contrasts, not with \u201con the\ninside\u201d, but with \u201cinherent\u201d, where inherence is a\ntechnical notion referring to what belongs to a thing in virtue of its\nessence. This includes both the thing's essence and those properties\nfollowing from it. These are all \u201cin\u201d the thing. However,\na thing may also have accidental properties, which are\n\u201cin\u201d it in the general sense in which that which is\npredicated of a thing is in it, and may also be \u201cin\u201d it in\nthe sense in which one region surrounded by another is in it, but\nwhich do not inhere in it. Such properties, in the thing in one sense\nbut external to it in another, may be destructive of the thing. In\nIIIp4d, Spinoza writes \u201cwhile we attend only to a thing\nitself, and not to the external causes, we shall not be able to\nfind anything in it which can destroy it\u201d (emphasis\nadded). Reading \u201cin\u201d here in the sense of\n\u201cinherent\u201d, and \u201cexternal\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cnot inherent\u201d, this passage suggests that to attend to a\nthing itself is just to attend to its essence\u2014what is affirmed\nin its definition\u2014and what follows from it. To attend to what is\nnot inherent in it is to attend to what is external to it, to\nsomething else. An actually existing thing, then, such as an existing\nbody, is its essence brought to existence. So long as a thing retains\nits essence=nature=form, it retains whatever inheres in it, and\nendures as the same individual.\n\nThe appeal to individuating essences accounts for the robust\npersistence of bodies. In IIIp6 Spinoza says that \u201cEach thing,\nas far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in is own\nbeing\u201d. In arguing for this conatus doctrine, Spinoza states\nthat \u201csingular things\u201d are that \u201cby which God's\nattributes are expressed in a certain and determinate way, i.e.,\nthings that express, in a certain and determinate way, God's power, by\nwhich God is and acts\u201d. \u201cThings\u201d here takes the\nactive position. Things express power; they do the\nexpressing. They are not mere expressions of it. Power is\nexpressed by things, rather than merely through them. Because\nthis is an active expression of power, the thing not only persists\nthrough externally caused changes, but opposes those changes which\nwould tend to destroy it, i.e., to keep it from expressing God's power\nin the way which constitutes its essence. Finally, in IIIp7, Spinoza\nexpressly identifies this striving with the thing's essence;\n\u201cthe striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its\nbeing is nothing but the actual essence of the thing.\u201d\n\nThus the form or essence of a thing, which individuates it, and whose\nretention through change constitutes the persistence of an individual,\njust is its inherent and individual power of striving to retain just\nform, hence to resist those extrinsic determinants that would diminish\nits power and destroy it. In the case of body, striving is expressed\nby the active tendency of a pattern of relative motion and rest, in\ntheir ordinary sense, of its parts to persist. The active tendency of\nthat pattern to persist is the essence of the individual body. That\npattern is determined in its existence transiently and externally; now\nthis way, and now that, now larger, now smaller, now swifter, now\nslower, now with these parts, now those. Such transient, external\ndetermination may give it accidental properties that oppose and hinder\nthe power of action it has in virtue of what inheres in it, and hence\nlimit its power of action. Another virtue of the idea that essence as\nactive striving is what individuates bodies is that it would provide a\nbasis in the nature of body for the principle of inertia, in such a\nway that inertia could be taken as a ground for the PLMM we earlier\nsaw was needed to underwrite the collision laws.\n\nHowever, this view is certainly not without its \nproblems.[13]\nIndeed, one of its strengths\u2014helping to ground inertia in the\npersistent activity of bodies \u2014 is a weakness. We saw earlier\nthat it is not easy to square this active reading of inertia, grounded\nas it is in the idea of motion pertaining to the action proper to a\nbody, with a good deal of what Spinoza says in the first and second\nparts of the\nEthics about how no body can be determined to produce an\neffect unless is it so determined externally. Another, related problem\nfor this interpretation is that it represents Spinoza as, not an\navant-garde thinker anticipating modern physics, but as a rear guard\ndefender, despite his official anti-scholastic stance, of the\ntraditional neo-Aristotelian doctrines of essence and substantial\nform, open to the same charges of ad hoc theorizing and of\nappeal to occult powers that Modernity and the Scientific Revolution\nlevelled against that tradition in their rise to intellectual\ndominance. Indeed, the notion of the individual essence of a body\nconceived as a power to maintain itself is of dubious intelligibility.\nSpinoza clearly believes that an individual's power to persevere can\nincrease or diminish. But if this power is to constitute the thing's\nessence and identity, such changes in degree cannot alter the identity\nof the power. But what then constitutes the individuality and identity\nof a power? In this light, the account of individuation by essence\nseems unexplanatory: either it amounts to an elaborate name for the\nproblem of the individuation of bodies it is supposed to solve, or it\nsimply displaces the same sort of problem from bodies to powers.\n\nThe problem we have been addressing is to find in Spinoza a\nsatisfactory ground for the idea that modes of extension consititute\nbodies to which dynamical laws like the laws of collision should\napply.  We have characterized that problem in terms of the\n\u201crobust persistence\u201d of bodies \u2013 their resistance to\nchange.  Barry (2021) presents a detailed and complex treatment of\npossible ways Spinoza might be thought to account for the resistence\nto change bodies manifest in the dynamics of collision.  He argues\nthat neither Spinoza's account of inertia nor the conatus doctrine can\nsupport resistance, and that a more direct appeal to modes as\nexpressions of God's power or activity cannot do so either.  He\nsuggests tentatively that, via Spinoza's parallelism (EP27), the\nresistance characteristic of bodies might instead be read off of the\nresistance relatively adequate ideas have to alteration in the face of\nrelatively less adequate ideas.  This reverses the more usual\ndirection of reading off features of ideas from those of their modal\ncounterparts in extension; but, despite Spinoza's remark in letter 27\n(to de Vries) that ethics is to be founded on metaphysics and physics,\nturnabout here should be fair play.  As Barry recognizes, however,\nsince not all features of modes of one attribute can be applied to the\ncounterparts under the other attributes, there must be something\nidentifiable in bodies that corresponds to the adequacy of ideas in\nvirtue of which they resist other ideas if the strategy is to work.\nThe extended counterpart of adequacy Barry fixes on is the degree to\nwhich the collection of component bodies whose relation consitutues a\ncomposite individual body communicate their rest and motion to one\nanother in a fixed manner, as discussed in the PI.  One might argue\nthat, had Barry taked that idea seriously enough in his discussion of\ninertia and the PI, the detour through Thought via the parallelism\nwould have been unnecessary.  In any event, Barry worries here that\nappreal to adequacy explains at best resistance to change i.e., the\nability of a body to retain the same ratio of motion and rest in a\ncollision, but not the ability to produce a change; i.e., the power of\na body to move or alter another, both of which powers Spinoza clearly\nattributes to bodies.\n\nWhether there is a sufficient Spinozistic ground for for a unified\nconception of the power of modes both to resist and to bring about\nchanges in other modes of the the attribute under which they are\nconsidered remains an open question.  It seems likely, however,\nthat reading the PI, the conatus doctrine, and Spinoza's accounts and\njustifications of inertia and the dynamical laws in the light of\nthe fact that modes each express in their own way the\ninfinite actvity and power of the one substance provides the\nbest hope for illuminating such ground.  \n",
