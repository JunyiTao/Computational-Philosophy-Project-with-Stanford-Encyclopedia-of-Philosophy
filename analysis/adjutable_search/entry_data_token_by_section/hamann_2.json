    "main_text": "Metacritique\n3. Metacritique\n\nAt the end of his life, Hamann chose to designate his authorship as\n\u201cMetacritique\u201d, a word he coined for his engagement with\nKant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Instead of creating a\nsystematic theology, or an epistemology, he seems to have seen his\nwork as one that examines the foundations and nature of philosophical\nand theological critique itself. Rather like the late Wittgenstein,\nhis work was deconstructive; he belongs in the camp of philosophers\nwhom Richard Rorty has described as \u201cedifying and\ntherapeutic\u201d rather than \u201cconstructive and\nsystematic\u201d (Rorty, 5\u20136). He brings to any issue in\nphilosophy not a constructive account, but an approach, a set of\nconvictions, something akin to ethical principles. He anticipated\nRorty\u2019s emphasis on the curative aspects of this task; at the\nend of his life, he wanted his collected works to be published under\nthe title \u201cCurative Baths\u201d\n(\u201cSaalbadereyen\u201d \u2014 a reference to healing\npractices of the time and an allusion to his father\u2019s\nprofession.) Each volume was to be called a \u2018Tub\u2019. This\nproject was sadly never realized, not even under a more conventional\ntitle.\n\nOne abiding characteristic of Hamann\u2019s many responses to the\nphilosophy of his time, therefore, is this \u2018metacritical\u2019\ninstinct: not to construct a rival account, but to go for the jugular;\nnot to set up a rival critique, but to insist that critique itself\nmust be subject to meta-critique, which concerns itself with the\nissues that must be attended to in relation to the act of\nphilosophical reflection itself. It consists of attention to the\nfundamental stance or position on issues or insights that must\nunderlie any work on philosophy or theology. According to Hamann,\noften \u201cthe difficulties lie in womb of the concepts\u201d (N\nIII, 31, 21). Hamann\u2019s writing therefore is not so much\n\u2018unsystematic\u2019 as is sometimes said, but\n\u2018presystematic\u2019. He addresses issues that must be\nrecognized in any self-critical reflection, matters that must be\npresuppositions for any system. Thus one of the most salient features\nof his \u201cMetacritique of the Purism of Reason\u201d, his\nunpublished response to Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason,\nwas to focus on the question of language. Through a tissue of imagery,\nhe suggests that a proper view of language implies that the alleged\n\u2018purity\u2019 of a priori reason is untenable.\n\nThese metacritical issues, for Hamann, principally include language,\nknowledge, and the nature of the human person. Hamann also, most\nurgently and most controversially (then as now), did not believe that\nany of these issues can be answered outside a theological perspective;\nthat is, without reference to God as humanity\u2019s creator and\ndialogue partner.\n",
