Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics\n\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Leibniz\u2019s mature physics is to be found in\nhis thesis that the bodies studied by physicists must be viewed not \nonly in terms of passive powers and motion, but also active forces. \nThis section sketches Leibniz\u2019s chief physical argument for the \npostulation of active forces and then looks respectively at the roles\nthat active forces play in his mature physics and how they are \nrelated to his deeper metaphysics. \n",
