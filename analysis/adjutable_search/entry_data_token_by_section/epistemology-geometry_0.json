Epistemological issues in Euclid\u2019s geometry\n\nA detailed examination of geometry as Euclid presented it reveals a\nnumber of problems. It is worth considering these in some detail\nbecause the epistemologically convincing status of Euclid\u2019s\nElements was uncontested by almost everyone until the later\ndecades of the 19th century. Chief among these problems are\na lack of clarity in the definitions of straight line and plane, and a\nconfusion between shortest and straightest as a, or the, fundamental\ngeometrical property. (See the many comments collected in\nHeath\u2019s edition of Euclid\u2019s Elements.) The\nimplications for the parallel postulate will be treated separately,\nsee the section on \n Non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe first four Books of Euclid\u2019s Elements are about\nstraight lines and circles, but it is well known that the concept of a\nstraight line receives only a most unsatisfactory definition. A line\nis said to be \u201ca breadthless length\u201d, and a straight line\nto be a line \u201cwhich lies evenly with the points on\nitself\u201d. This may help convince readers that they share a common\nconception of the straight line, but it is no use if unexpected\ndifficulties arise in the creation of a theory\u2014as we shall\nsee.\n\nTo those who decided to read the Elements carefully and see\nhow the crucial terms are used, it became apparent that the account is\nboth remarkably scrupulous in some ways and flawed in others. Straight\nlines arise almost always as finite segments that can be indefinitely\nextended, but, as many commentators noted, although Euclid stated that\nthere is a segment joining any two points he did not explicitly say\nthat this segment is unique. This is a flaw in the proof of the first\ncongruence theorem (I.4) which says that if two triangles have two\npairs of sides equal and the included angle is equal then the\nremaining sides of the triangles are equal.\n\nTheorem I.4 is interesting in another way. Theorem I.2 carries a\nscrupulous, and by no means obvious, proof that a given line segment\nin a plane may be copied exactly with one of its end points at any\nprescribed point in the plane. Theorem I.4 properly requires a proof\nthat an angle may likewise be copied exactly at an arbitrary point,\nbut this Euclid cannot provide at this stage (one is given in I.23,\nwhich, however, builds on these earlier results). He therefore gave a\nbald claim that one triangle may be copied exactly in an arbitrary\nposition, which makes one wonder why such care was expended on I.2. In\nfact, the whole concept of motion of figures was to become a prolonged\ntopic of discussion in Arabic/Islamic times. (On deduction in Euclid,\nsee Mueller 1981.)\n\nA plausible reading of Elements Book I is that a straight\nline can be understood as having a direction, so that there is a\nstraight line in every direction at every point and only one straight\nline at a given point in a given direction. The parallel postulate\nthen says that lines which cross a given line in equal angles point in\nthe same direction and do not meet. But this must be regarded as an\ninterpretation, and one that requires quite some work to make\nprecise.\n\nDirection is, nonetheless, a more plausible candidate than distance;\nEuclid did not start with the idea that the straight line joining two\ndistinct points is the shortest curve joining them. The relevant\nprimitive concept in the Elements is that of equality of\nsegments, such as all the radii of a given circle. Euclid stated as\nCommon Notion 4 that if two segments can be made to coincide then they\nare equal, and (in the troublesome I.4) he used the converse, that if\ntwo segments are equal then they can be made to coincide. Segments are\nsuch that either one is smaller than the other or they are equal, and\nin I.20 Euclid showed that \u201cin any triangle two sides taken\ntogether in any manner are greater than the remaining one.\u201d This\nresult has become known as the triangle inequality, and it goes a long\nway to proving that the line segment joining any two distinct points\nis the shortest curve through those points. Once the parallel\npostulate is introduced Euclid showed that opposite sides of a\nparallelogram are equal, and so the distance between a pair of\nparallel lines is a constant.\n\nBut there is another weakness in the Elements that is also\nworth noting, although it drew less attention, and this is the nature\nof the plane. The plane has another sub-standard definition, evidently\nmodelled on that of the line: \u201ca plane surface is a surface\nwhich lies evenly with the straight lines on itself\u201d (and,\nunsurprisingly, \u201ca surface is that which has length and breadth\nonly\u201d). After that, the word \u2018plane\u2019 is not\nmentioned in the first four Books, although they are solely concerned\nwith plane geometry. When Euclid turned to solid geometry in Book IX,\nhe began with three theorems to show successively that a straight line\ncannot lie partly in a plane and partly not, that if two straight\nlines cut one another they lie in a plane and every triangle lies in a\nplane, and that if two planes meet then they do so in a line. However,\nhe can only be said to claim these results and make them plausible,\nbecause he cannot use his definition of a plane to prove any of them.\nThey do, however, form the basis for the next theorems: there is a\nperpendicular to a plane at any point of the plane, and all the lines\nperpendicular to a given line at a given point are on a plane.\n\nOnce again, I.4 is problematic. Consider, for the purpose of a\nreduction ad absurdum, that one has two triangles, \\(ABC\\)\nand \\(A'BC\\) on the same side of their common base \\(BC\\), and such\nthat \\(BA = BA'\\) and \\(CA = CA'\\). It is intended to show that\ntherefore the vertices \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) coincide, and for this one\nmust, as Gauss observed (in unpublished remarks, see Gauss\nWerke 8, 193), use the fact that the triangles lie in the\nsame plane. A good definition of a plane is required, one that allows\nthis result to be proved.\n",
