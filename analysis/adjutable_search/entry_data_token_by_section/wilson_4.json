Knowing & Believing\n\nGiven that \u201cour experience of knowing [is] the presupposition of\nany inquiry we can undertake\u201d, Cook Wilson reasoned that\n\u201cwe cannot make knowing itself a subject of inquiry in the sense\nof asking what knowing is\u201d (SI, 39). It follows immediately from\nthis impossibility of inquiring about the nature of knowledge that a\n\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019 is itself impossible, a consequence\nhe first expressed in a letter to Prichard in 1904:\n\nWe cannot construct knowing\u2014the act of\napprehending\u2014out of any elements. I remember quite early in my\nphilosophic reflection having an instinctive aversion to the very\nexpression \u2018theory of knowledge\u2019. I felt the\nwords themselves suggested a fallacy. (SL, 803)\n\n\nKnowledge is sui generis and therefore a \u2018theory\u2019\nof it is impossible. Knowledge is simply knowledge, and an attempt to\nstate it in terms of something else must end in describing something\nwhich is not knowledge. (Prichard 1909, 245)\n\n\nThus, knowledge, as obtained in \u2018apprehension\u2019, could not\nbe defined in terms of belief augmented by some other property or\nproperties, as in the definition of knowledge as \u2018justified true\nbelief\u2019. Cook Wilson is thus to be counted among early\n20th-century opponents of this view (Dutant (2015), Le\nMorvan (2017) & Antognazza (2020)). This view is known since\nTimothy Williamson\u2019s Knowledge and its Limits as\n\u2018knowledge first\u2019 (see Williamson (2000, v) and Adam\nCarter, Gordon & Jarvis (2017) for recent developments of this\nview).\n\nAt the turn of the last century, it was also held by the neo-Kantian\nphilosopher Leonard Nelson (Nelson 1908 & 1949), to whom Cook\nWilson alludes in SI (872), but it was also held unbeknownst to him by\nmembers of the Brentano school, such as Adolf Reinach, Max Scheler,\nand Edmund Husserl. (See Mulligan (2014) for a survey.) It was to\nbecome the central plank of \u2018Oxford Realism\u2019. For the\nOxonians and the Brentanians one knows that p only if one\n\u2018apprehends\u2019 that p. As Kevin Mulligan put it:\n\u201cone knows that p in the strict sense only if one has\nperceived that p and such perceiving is not itself any sort\nof belief or judging\u201d (Mulligan 2014, 382). A version of this\nview is defended today by Timothy Williamson, according to whom\nknowledge is a mental state \u201cbeing in which is necessary and\nsufficient for knowing p\u201d (Williamson 2000, 21),\nand which \u201ccannot be analysed into more basic concepts\u201d\n(Williamson 2000, 33). The claim is, however, about \u2018knowledge\nthat p\u2019 and not anymore about \u2018apprehending that\np\u2019.\n\nIf knowledge is indeed distinct from belief, then the difference\ncannot be one of degree in the feeling of confidence or in the amount\nof evidential support:\n\nIn knowing, we can have nothing to do with the so-called\n\u2018greater strength\u2019 of the evidence on which the opinion is\ngrounded; simply because we know that this \u2018greater\nstrength\u2019 of evidence of A\u2019s being B is compatible with\nA\u2019s not being B after all. (SI, 100)\n\n\nTo know is not to have a belief of a special kind, differing from\nbeliefs of other kinds; and no improvement in a belief and no increase\nin the feeling of conviction which it implies will convert it into\nknowledge. (Prichard 1950, 87)\n\n\nAustin has a nice supporting example in Sense and Sensibilia,\nusing the fact that \u2018seeing that\u2019 is factive: if no pig is\nin sight, I might accumulate evidence that one lives here: buckets of\npig food, pig-like marks on the ground, the smell, etc. But if the pig\nsuddenly appears:\n\n\n\u2026 there is no longer any question of collecting evidence; its\ncoming into view doesn\u2019t provide me with more evidence\nthat it\u2019s a pig, I can now just see that it is, the\nquestion is settled. (Austin 1962, 115)\n\n\nThere is a parallel move by John McDowell in \u2018Criteria,\nDefeasibility and Knowledge\u2019 against the notion of\n\u2018criteria\u2019, deployed by some commentators of Wittgenstein\nas a sort of \u2018highest common factor\u2019 between evidence and\nproof (McDowell 1998, 369\u2013394). Here, a \u2018highest common\nfactor\u2019 would be a state of mind that would count as knowing,\ndepending on one or more added factors, but would count in their\nabsence as something else such as believing (McDowell 1998, 386).\nMcDowell is now seen as having thus put forward a form of\n\u2018disjunctivism\u2019 about knowledge and belief (more on\ndisjunctivism in section 6). Although McDowell does not mention these\nauthors, Travis (2005) has shown that this move has roots in both Cook\nWilson and Austin. The fact that there is no highest common factor to\nknowledge and belief entails for Cook Wilson a rejection of\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 and \u2018externalist\u2019 accounts of\nknowledge. Any \u2018hybrid\u2019 account would factor knowledge\ninto an internal part, possibly a copy of the object known, and a\nrelation of that copy to the object itself (see immediately below and\nsection 6). Since there is no such highest common factor, this view,\nintegral to \u2018externalist\u2019 accounts of knowledge, had to be\nrejected (Travis 2005, 287).\n\nBut Cook Wilson was led here to a further thesis. If one is prepared\nto say \u2018I believe p\u2019, when one is not sure that\nevidence already known is sufficient to claim that \u2018I know that\np\u2019, then it looks as if one should always be in a\nposition to know if one knows or if one merely believes. He argued,\nhowever, that \u2018knowing that one knows\u2019 should not mean\nthat, once a particular piece of knowledge has been obtained, one\nshould then decide if it counts as knowledge or not, because this\ndecision would count again as a piece knowledge and \u201cwe should\nget into an unending series of knowings\u201d (SI, 107). This is why\nhe insisted that knowing that one knows \u201cmust be contained\nwithin the knowing process itself\u201d:\n\n\nBelief is not knowledge and the man who knows does not believe at all\nwhen he knows: he knows it. (SI, 101)\n\nThe consciousness that the knowing process is a knowing process must\nbe contained within the knowing process itself. (SI, 107)\n\n\nThis claim was given further emphasis by Prichard, but his own\nformulation differ in an important respect, since he introduces the\nidea of a \u201creflection\u201d in virtue of which when one knows\nthat p, one is able to know that one knows that p\nand, when one believes that p, one is also able to know that\none believes that p, so that it would be impossible to\nmistake knowledge for belief and vice-versa:\n\n\nWe must recognize that whenever we know something we either do, or at\nleast can, by reflecting, directly know that we are knowing it, and\nthat whenever we believe something, we similarly either do or can\ndirectly know that we are believing it and not knowing it. (Prichard\n1950, 86 & 88)\n\n\nOne can see that this is not quite Cook Wilson\u2019s position, given\nhis regress argument. Prichard assumes that, whenever one does not\nknow, one knows that one does not know:\n\n\nWhen knowing, for example, that the noise we are hearing is loud, we\ndo or can know that we are knowing this and so cannot be mistaken, and\nwhen believing that the noise is due to a car we know or can know that\nwe are believing and not knowing this. (Prichard 1950, 89)\n\n\nCharles Travis called the claim that in knowing that p one\ncan always distinguish one\u2019s condition from all states in which\nnot-p the \u2018accretion\u2019 (Travis (2005, 290) &\nKalderon & Travis (2013, 501)) and he argued that it damages the\ncore of Cook Wilson\u2019s and Prichard\u2019s positions (Travis\n2005, 289\u2013294). To use the above example of the pig suddenly\ncoming into view, the claim is that, although one can know by\nreflection that one knows that one is seeing a pig, one cannot by mere\nreflection exclude the possibility that one is in fact seeing some\ncleverly engineered \u2018ringer\u2019. The upshot of this argument\nis not immediately clear: if it is the case that one knows p\nonly if p and one knows that one knows that p, how\ncould one be unable to exclude the case that not-p, hence\nthat one does not know p? At all events, Travis sees this as\nreinstalling the argument from illusion (Travis 2005, 291), that had\nalready been subjected to numerous critiques from an early paper by\nPrichard to Austin\u2019s Sense and Sensibilia:\n\n\nThat statements about appearances imply that we at least know enough\nof reality to say that real things have certain possible\npredicates, e.g., bent or convergent. To deny this is to be wholly\nunable to state how things look. [\u2026] It is only because we know\nthat our distance from an object affects its apparent size that we can\ndraw a distinction between the size it looks and the size it is. If we\nforget this we can draw no distinction at all. (Prichard 1906,\n225\u2013226)\n\n\u2026 it is important to remember that all talk of deception only\nmakes sense against a background of general non-deception.\n(You can\u2019t fool all the people all of the time.) It must be\npossible to recognize a case of deception by checking the odd\ncase against more normal ones. (Austin 1962, 11)\n\n\nGuy Longworth (2019) has detailed how much Austin owed to Cook Wilson\non knowledge (see Urmson (1988) for a discussion in relation to\nPrichard): Austin held the \u2018knowledge first\u2019 view and,\nconcomitantly, rejected the possibility of a theory of knowledge\n(Austin 1962, 124), he viewed knowledge as akin to proof, thus as\nbeing different in kind from belief on accumulation of evidence (see\nAustin (1962, 115) & (1979, 99)). But Austin dropped the\n\u2018accretion\u2019 in \u2018Other Minds\u2019 as he shifted the\nanalysis of the claim that \u2018If I know, I can\u2019t be\nwrong\u2019 (SI (69) & Prichard (1950, 88)) to that of \u2018I\nknow that p\u2019 as providing a form of warrant,\none\u2019s authority for saying that p (Austin 1979,\n99\u2013100). Krista Lawlor (2013) recently suggested that Austin\nintroduced here the speech act of \u2018assurance\u2019. (Although\nit has been claimed that the idea of \u2018performatives\u2019\noriginates in an exchange of letters on promises with Prichard\n(Warnock 1963, 347), that dimension remained unexplored in Oxford\nRealism before Austin, who was consciously moving away here from\nstrict focus on \u2018statements\u2019.) \n\nThe \u2018accretion\u2019 raises indeed an issue concerning\n\u2018other minds\u2019, given that it is one\u2019s reflective\nview that, supposedly, authoritatively determines that one knows:\ncould there be other ways to determine whether someone else knows?\n(See Longworth (2019).) This is how Austin, who also viewed knowledge\nas a state of mind, was arguably led to explore the ramifications the\nchallenge \u2018How do you know?\u2019 to the person claiming\n\u2018I know\u2019. Although he warned against the\n\u2018descriptive fallacy\u2019 (Austin 1979, 103), Austin\u2019s\nclaim appears to be, rather, that \u2018I know\u2019 has functions\n\u201cover and above describing the subjective mental state of\nknowing\u201d (Longworth (2019, 195), see Austin (1979,\n78\u201379)).\n\nTo come back to Cook Wilson, he grappled here with related problems.\nIt is implied by the above that knowledge requires a sort of warrant\nvery much akin to a proof and, consequently, \u201cwe are forced to\nallow that we are certain of very much less than we should have said\notherwise\u201d (Prichard 1950, 97). Mathematical knowledge appears\nparadigmatic. As Prichard put it: \u201cIn mathematics we have,\nwithout real possibility of question, an instance of knowledge; we are\ncertain, we know\u201d (Prichard 1919, 302). (Joseph used\nthis view to argue against Mill\u2019s empiricist account of\nmathematics, using \u2018intuition\u2019 where Cook Wilson would use\n\u2018apprehension\u2019 (Joseph 1916a, 543\u2013553).) Alas, Cook\nWilson put forth the axiom of parallels in Euclidean geometry as an\nexample of knowledge, and dismissed non-Euclidean geometries as\ninconsistent (see section 1). If for any p such as the axiom\nof parallels, someone fails to \u2018apprehend\u2019 it, then all he\ncould do is, somehow lamely, ask them to try and \u201cremove\n[\u2026] whatever confusions or prejudices [\u2026] prevent them\nfrom apprehending the truth of the disputed proposition\u201d\n(Furlong 1941, 128).\n\nThis reply raises a prima facie problem for Cook Wilson,\nbecause he could not have known, in the sense of \u2018knowing\np only if p\u2019, that \u2018non-Euclidean\ngeometries are inconsistent\u2019, since it has been proved that they\nare not. He thus unwittingly provided an illustration of the need to\naccount, from his own internalist standpoint, for the sort of error\n(or \u2018false judgement\u2019) committed when one claims to know\nthat p, while it is the case that not-p. For someone\nto know or to be in error while thinking that one knows would just be\ntwo undistinguishable states, since which of the two happens to be the\ncase would depend on some external factors:\n\n\u2026 the two states of mind in which the man conducts his\narguments, the correct and the erroneous one, are quite\nundistinguishable to the man himself. But if this is so, as the man\ndoes not know in the erroneous state of mind, neither can he know in\nthe other state. (SI, 107)\n\n\nCook Wilson saw this a threat to the very possibility of demonstrative\nknowledge, since one would never be sure that any demonstration is\ntrue (SI, 107\u2013108). Answering the threat, he would need here is\nthus to make room for errors\u2014when one thinks that one knows but\none does not\u2014but without excluding by the same token the\npossibility that knowing entails being in a position that one knows\nthat one knows.\n\nCook Wilson was thus led to distinguish, in some of his most\nintriguing descriptive analyses, a further \u2018form of\nconsciousness\u2019, different from both knowledge and belief (or\nopinion), which he called \u2018being under the impression\nthat\u2019 (SI, 109\u2013113). A typical example being when one sees\nthe back of Smith on the street and, \u2018being under the impression\nthat\u2019 it is a friend, say Jones, one slaps him on the back, only\nto realize one\u2019s mistake when he turns his head. The\n\u201cessential feature\u201d of this state of mind is, according to\nCook Wilson, \u201cthe absence of any sense of uncertainty or doubt,\nthe action being one which would not be done if we felt the slightest\nuncertainty\u201d (SI, 110). Thus, one did not falsely judge that the\nman on the street was Jones, because there was no judgement at all:\none was merely \u2018under the impression that\u2019 it was him.\nMaybe one had some evidence that it was Jones, but the point is that\none acted on it without questioning the evidence: it was not used as\nevidence, there was no assessment out of which one may be said to\nprefer this possibility that other possibility, because no other\npossibility was entertained. In this state of mind, the possibility of\nerror is somehow excluded, given that it does not occur to one that\n\u2018This man is Jones\u2019 might be false. It is thus not the\ncase that one thought that one knew but really did not, because it is\nnot true that to begin with one thought one knew, since one had not\nreflected on one\u2019s evidence. The absence of doubt or uncertainty\nopens the door to the possibility of being mistaken while taking\noneself as being certain.\n\nThe notion of \u2018being under the impression that\u2019 played a\nsignificant role in the writings of the Oxford Realists, not just\nthose of Prichard, who also spoke of the \u2018an unquestioning frame\nof mind\u2019, \u2018thinking without question\u2019 or\n\u2018taking for granted\u2019 (Prichard 1950, 79 &\n96\u201398), but also those of William Kneale, H. H. Price and J. L.\nAustin\u2014see, e.g., Kneale (1949, 5 & 18), Price (1935), and\nAustin (1962, 122). Perhaps most strikingly, Prichard was to drop the\n\u2018accretion\u2019 and argue in a late essay,\n\u2018Perception\u2019, that perception is not a kind of knowing: we\nmerely see colour extensions, which we systematically mistake for\nobjects or \u2018take for granted\u2019 to be objects (Prichard\n1950, 52\u201368). Still, the notion of \u2018being under the\nimpression that\u2019 had its critics at Oxford, such as H. P. Grice,\nwho was aware of the difficulties raised by the\n\u2018accretion\u2019:\n\n\nThis difficulty led Cook Wilson and his followers to the admission of\na state of \u201ctaking for granted\u201d, which supposedly is\nsubjectively indistinguishable from knowledge but unlike knowledge\ncarried no guarantee of truth. But the modification amounts to\nsurrender; for what enables us to deny that all of our so-called\nknowledge is really only \u201ctaking for granted\u201d? (Grice\n1989, 383\u2013384)\n\n\nOne may also justifiably feel that Cook Wilson has not fully explained\naway cases of error such as his own in being certain that\n\u2018non-Euclidean geometries are inconsistent\u2019, because his\nconviction was not the result of merely \u2018being under the\nimpression that\u2019.\n\nNevertheless, the influence of Cook Wilson\u2019s conceptions was\nfelt in a variety of ways in the second half of the last century. H.\nH. Price offered in Belief an important commentary on Cook\nWilson\u2019s notion of \u2018being under the impression that\u2019\n(Price (1969, 204\u2013220), reprising some of the content of Price\n(1935)). He deemed it an important addition to the traditional\n\u2018occurrence\u2019 analysis of belief, as opposed to the\n\u2018dispositional\u2019 analysis. Price usefully contrasted\n\u2018being under the impression that\u2019 with\n\u2018assent\u2019 (Price 1969, 211\u2013212), which is usually\nsaid to involve preference and confidence: in prefering p one\nwould decide in favour of p having alternatives q\nand r in mind, but this is precisely not the case when\n\u2018being under the impression that\u2019, since in this state one\ndoes not entertain alternatives. As Cook Wilson points out,\n\u201cthere is a certain passivity and helplessness\u201d involved\n(SI, 113). There is no confidence either, since in this state of mind\ndoubt is not an option, hence no degree of certainty is involved.\nPrice also explored (1969, 212\u2013216) connections between this\nunquestioning state of mind and the notion of \u2018primitive\ncredulity\u2019 (Bain 1888, 511), i.e., the idea harking back to\nSpinoza (Ethics IIp49s) that one naturally believes in the\nreality of anything that is presented to one\u2019s mind, unless some\ncontradicting evidence is also occurring.\n\nIn contrast to Price, Jonathan Cohen argued that beliefs are\ndispositions (Cohen (1989, 368) & (1992, 5)). He also rejected the\nCook Wilson\u2019s claim that belief involves confidence (see section\n4), but, without crediting him (except privately), Cohen made use of\n\u2018being under the impression that\u2019 to define belief as a\ndisposition to \u2018normally to feel that p\u2019 or\n\u2018to feel it true that p\u2019 (Cohen (1989, 368) &\n(1992, 7)). So defined, belief would thus differ from\n\u2018acceptance\u2019, which results from a conscious and voluntary\nchoice and involves, like Price\u2019s \u2018assent\u2019,\npreference and confidence. Cohen further added to these differences\nthat acceptance is also subjectively closed under deductibility, while\nthis is not the case with belief:\n\n\n\u2026 you may well feel it true that p and that\nif p then q, without feeling it true\nthat q. You will just be failing to put two and two together,\nas it were. And detective-story writers, for example, show us how\noften and easily we can fail to do this with our beliefs. (Cohen 1992,\n31\u201332)\n\n\nSo acceptance of p involves \u2018premissing\u2019, i.e.,\nthe decision to use p as a premise or rule of inference in\nfurther reasonings, and Cohen thought that he was carving nature at\nits joint here: \u201cBelief is a disposition to feel, acceptance a\npolicy for reasoning\u201d (Cohen 1992, 5). This is in many ways not\nfaithful to Cook Wilson\u2019s original ideas, but one can sense\ntheir presence within the idea of being unreflectively disposed to\nfeel that p being conceptually distinct from accepting\np.\n\nOn another note, John McDowell described knowledge in \u2018Knowledge\nand the Internal\u2019 as a \u201cstanding in the space of\nreasons\u201d and argued against an \u201cinteriorization of the\nspace of reasons\u201d that would occur if one were to think of\nknowledge as achieving flawless standings in the space of reason,\n\u201cwithout needing the world to do us any favours\u201d (McDowell\n1998 395\u2013396). If appearances were to be misleading, it would be\nargued that this not be the result of faulty moves within the space of\nreason but simply an \u201cunkindness of the world\u201d. This\nconception, McDowell sees as opening the door to an\n\u2018hybrid\u2019 account of knowledge, with flawless standings in\nthe space of reasons as an internal part, which would provide\nnecessary conditions for knowledge, and favours from the\nworld\u2014when thing are as they appear to be\u2014as an extra\ncondition (McDowell 1998, 400). But, McDowell concludes, \u201cthe\nvery idea of reason as having a sphere of operation within which it is\ncapable of ensuring, without being beholden to the world that\none\u2019s postures are all right [\u2026] has the look of a\nfantasy\u201d (McDowell 1998, 405). This is so precisely because the\nresources from the space of reasons could not provide factiveness on\ntheir own, so knowledge could not be completely constituted\nby standings within it. To rid oneself of the fantasy, one needs\nsimply to recognize that on occasions when the world is what it\nappears to be, this favour is \u201cnot extra to the person\u2019s\nstanding in the space of reasons\u201d (McDowell 1998, 405) and that\n\u201cwe are vulnerable to the world\u2019s playing us false; and\nwhen the world does not play us false we are indebted to it\u201d\n(McDowell 1998, 407). Here too, although the terminology is taken from\nWilfrid Sellars, there is a recognizable source in Cook Wilson.\n\nFinally, another significant development related to the\n\u2018accretion\u2019 is its connection with the \u2018knowing that\none knows\u2019 principle in epistemic logic, first introduced in\nJaakko Hintikka\u2019s ground-breaking Knowledge and Belief\n(Hintikka 1962). Hintikka argued for the equivalence between \u2018I\nknow that p\u2019 and \u2018I know that I know that\np\u2019 or, more generally, that \u2018i knows\nthat p\u2019 (Kip) implies\n\u2018i knows that i knows that p\u2019\n(KiKip) (Hintikka 1962, chap. 5). In\nconnection with this, he noticed that Prichard\u2019s introduction\nthe idea of \u201creflection\u201d (see Prichard (1950, 88) quoted\nabove) turns the argument into an argument from introspection that\ndoes not sustain the more general claim that \u2018i\nbelieves that p\u2019 (Bip) implies\n\u2018i knows that i believes that\np\u2019 (KiBip) (Hintikka\n1962, 109\u2013110). Still, Hintikka thought that Cook Wilson and\nPrichard would be right, if their remarks were to be understood as\nrestricted to the case where i is the first-person pronoun\n\u2018I\u2019 (Hintikka 1962, 110). \n\nAlthough Williamson has picked up the Oxonian banner of\n\u2018knowledge first\u2019, this is one point where he did not\nfollow Cook Wilson and Prichard, since he argued against the\n\u2018knowing that one knows\u2019 principle with help of the notion\nof \u2018luminosity\u2019. A condition C is said to be\n\u2018luminous\u2019 if and only if for every case a, if C\nobtains in a then in a one is in a position to know\nthat C obtains (Williamson 2000, 95). Williamson (2000, chap. 4)\nprovided arguments against \u2018luminosity\u2019, thus that one can\nknow without being able to know that one knows. \n",
