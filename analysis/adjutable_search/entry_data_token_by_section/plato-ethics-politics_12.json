    "main_text": "Politics, Part One: The Ideal Constitution || Totalitarianism\n4.4 Totalitarianism\n\n\nSome of the most heated discussions of the politics of Plato\u2019s \nRepublic have surrounded the charge of totalitarianism \nfamously advanced by Karl Popper ([1945] 1971). Like the other \u201cisms\u201d we have been considering, \ntotalitarianism applies to the Republic only conditionally, \ndepending on the definition of \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 offered.\nBut it is worth thinking through the various ways in which this \ncharge might be made, to clarify the way the philosopher-rulers wield\npolitical authority over the rest of the city (see Bambrough 1967, Taylor 1986, L. Brown 1998, and Ackrill 1997).\n\n\nCritics of Plato\u2019s Republic have characterized the aims of\nKallipolis\u2019 rulers as totalitarian. Socrates is quite explicit that\nthe good at which the rulers aim is the unity of the city (462a\u2013b). Is\nthis an inherently totalitarian and objectionable aim?\n\n\nThe problem, Popper and others have charged, is that the rulers aim \nat the organic unity of the city as a whole, regardless of the \nindividual interests of the citizens. But this would \nbe surprising, if true. After all, the Republic provides a \npicture not just of a happy city but also of a happy individual \nperson, and in Book One, Socrates argues that the ruler\u2019s task is to \nbenefit the ruled. So how could the rulers of Kallipolis utterly \ndisregard the good of the citizens?\n\n\nSome readers answer Popper by staking out a diametrically opposed\nposition (Vlastos 1977). They maintain that Plato conceives of the city\u2019s good as\nnothing more than the aggregate good of all the citizens. On this\nview, citizens need to contribute to the city\u2019s happiness only because\nthey need to contribute to the happiness of other citizens if they are\nto achieve their own maximal happiness. Any totalitarian control of\nthe citizens is paternalistic.  Yet this view, too, seems at odds with\nmuch of the Republic.  When Socrates says that the happiest\ncity is a maximally unified city (462a\u2013b), or when he insists that all\nthe citizens need to be bound together (519e\u2013520a), he seems to be\ninvoking a conception of the city\u2019s good that is not reducible to the\naggregate good of the citizens.\n\n\nSo a mixed interpretation seems to be called for (Morrison 2001; cf. Kamtekar 2001, Meyer 2004, and Brennan 2004). In the \nRepublic, the good of the city and the good of the \nindividual are independently specifiable, and the citizens\u2019 own \nmaximal good coincides with the maximal good of the city. Since Plato\nbelieves that this coincidence is realized only through \npropagandistic means in the ideal city, the propaganda is \npaternalistically targeted at the citizens\u2019 own good but not \nexclusively at the citizens\u2019 own good. On this view, if the citizens \ndo not see themselves as parts of the city serving the city, neither \nthe city nor they will be maximally happy.\n\n\nThis does not leave Kallipolis\u2019 aims beyond reproach, for one might\nwell be skeptical of the good of unity, of Plato\u2019s assumption that\nindividuals reap their own maximal good when the city is most unified,\nor of the Republic\u2019s claims about how this unity (and these\nindividual goods) might be achieved. But it is not obvious that the\nrulers of Kallipolis have inherently totalitarian and objectionable\naims (cf. Kamtekar 2004).\n\n\nKallipolis has more clearly totalitarian features. First, totalitarian regimes concentrate \npolitical power in one bloc and offer the ruled no \nalternative. The ideal city of Plato\u2019s \nRepublic is plainly totalitarian in this respect. \n\n\nBut the concentration of political power in Kallipolis differs in at \nleast two ways from the concentration in actual totalitarian states. \nFirst, Socrates insists that in the ideal city, all the citizens will\nagree about who should rule. This agreement is the city\u2019s moderation \n(430d\u2013432a), caused by the city\u2019s justice (433b, cf. 351d). Socrates \nalso suggests some ways of explaining how the non-philosophers will \nagree that the philosophers should rule. First, he offers a way of \npersuading those who lack knowledge that only the philosophers have \nknowledge (476d\u2013480a), which in effect offers a way of explaining to \nthe non-philosophers that only the philosophers have the knowledge \nrequired to rule. Second, he suggests that the non-philosophers will \nbe struck by the philosophers\u2019 obvious virtue (500d\u2013502a). (Their \nvirtue would be especially striking to the producers, since the \nphilosophers do without private property, which the producers love so\nmuch.) Finally, he suggests that in Kallipolis, the producers will be\ngrateful to the guardian classes for keeping the city safe and \norderly, wherein they can achieve their good, as they see it, by \noptimally satisfying their necessary appetitive attitudes (463a\u2013b).\n\n\nThe second way in which Kallipolis\u2019 concentration of political power\nis special that it does not concentrate anything good for the\nrulers. Socrates is clear that the philosophers despise political\npower (519c, 540a), and they rule not to reap rewards but for the sake\nof the ruled (cf. 341c\u2013343a), because their justice obligates them to\nobey the law that commands them to rule (see\n section 2.3\n above). In fact, the rulers of Kallipolis benefit the ruled as best \nthey can, helping them realize the best life they are capable of. \nThese benefits must include some primary education for the producer \nclass (see 414d), to make good on the commitment to promote \nespecially talented children born among the producers (415c, 423d) \nand to enable the producers to recognize the virtue in the \nphilosophers. But the benefits extend to peace and order: the \nproducers do not have to face warfare.\n\n\nA second totalitarian feature of Kallipolis is the control that the\nrulers exert over daily life. There is nothing especially totalitarian\nabout the rule of law pervasive in Kallipolis (see esp. 415d\u2013e, and\ncf. the laws that apply to the rulers, such as the marriage law and\nthe law commanding philosophers to rule) (Meyer 2006 and Hitz 2009). But the rulers control mass\nculture in the ideal city, and they advance a \u201cnoble lie\u201d\nto convince citizens of their unequal standing and deep tie to the\ncity (414b\u2013415d). This propagandistic control plainly represents a\ntotalitarian concern, and it should make us skeptical about the value\nof the consent given to the rulers of Kallipolis.\n\n\nIt is one thing to identify totalitarian features of Kallipolis and\nanother thing to say why they are wrong. Three very different\nobjections suggest themselves. First, we might reject the idea of an\nobjectively knowable human good, and thus reject the idea that\npolitical power should be in the hands of those who know the human\ngood. Here we should distinguish between Plato\u2019s picture of the human\ngood and the very idea of an objective human good, for even if we want\nto dissent from Plato\u2019s view, we might still accept the very idea. At\nleast, it does not seem implausible to suppose that some general\npsychological capacities are objectively good for their possessors\n(while others are objectively bad), and at that point, we can ask\nwhether political power should be used to foster the good capacities\nand to restrain or prevent the bad ones. Given that state-sponsored\neducation cannot but address the psychological capacities of the\npupils, only very austere political systems could be supported by a\nthorough-going skepticism about the human good.\n\n\nSecond, we might accept the idea of an objectively knowable human \ngood, but be wary of concentrating extensive political power in the \nhands of a few knowers. We might reject Plato\u2019s apparent optimism \nabout the trustworthiness of philosopher-rulers and insist on greater\nchecks upon political power, to minimize the risks of abuse. If this \nis our objection, then we might wonder what checks are optimal.\n\n\nFinally, we might reject Plato\u2019s scheme on the grounds that political\nself-determination and free expression are themselves more valuable \nthan Plato recognizes. This sort of response is perhaps the most \ninteresting, but it is by no means easy. For it is difficult to \nassess the intrinsic value of self-determination and free expression,\napart from skepticism about the knowledge or power of those who would limit \nself-determination or free expression. Moreover, it is difficult to \nbalance these values against the concerns that motivate Plato. Where \ndoes the power over massive cultural forces lie when it is not under \npolitical control? And to what extent can we live well when our \nculture is not shaped by people thoughtfully dedicated to living a \ngood human life? These are not questions that can be easily shrugged \noff, even if we cannot embrace Kallipolis as their answer.\n",
