    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nKarl Raimund Popper was born on 28 July 1902 in Vienna. His parents,\nwho were of Jewish origin, brought him up in an atmosphere which he\nwas later to describe as \u201cdecidedly bookish\u201d. His father\nwas a lawyer by profession, but he also took a keen interest in the\nclassics and in philosophy, and communicated to his son an interest in\nsocial and political issues. His mother inculcated in him such a\npassion for music that for a time he contemplated taking it up as a\ncareer; he initially chose the history of music as a second subject\nfor his Ph.D. examination. Subsequently, his love for music became one\nof the inspirational forces in the development of his thought, and\nmanifested itself in his highly original interpretation of the\nrelationship between dogmatic and critical thinking, in his account of\nthe distinction between objectivity and subjectivity, and, most\nimportantly, in the growth of his hostility towards all forms of\nhistoricism, including historicist ideas about the nature of the\n\u201cprogressive\u201d in music. The young Karl attended the local\nRealgymnasium, where he was unhappy with the standards of the\nteaching, and, after an illness he left to attend the University of\nVienna in 1918, matriculating four years later. In 1919 he became\nheavily involved in left-wing politics and became for a time a\nMarxist. However, he was quickly disillusioned with the doctrinaire\ncharacter of the latter, and soon abandoned it entirely. He also\ndiscovered the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Adler (he served\nbriefly as a voluntary social worker with deprived children in one of\nthe latter\u2019s clinics in the 1920s), and heard Einstein lecture\non relativity theory. The dominance of the critical spirit in\nEinstein, and its total absence in Marx, Freud and Adler, struck\nPopper as being of fundamental importance: the pioneers of\npsychoanalysis, he came to think, couched their theories in terms\nwhich made them amenable only to confirmation, while Einstein\u2019s\ntheory, crucially, had testable implications which, if false, would\nhave falsified the theory itself.\n\nPopper took some time to settle on a career; he trained as a\ncabinetmaker, obtained a primary school teaching diploma in 1925 and\nqualified to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school in\n1929. He undertook a doctoral programme with the department of\npsychology at the University of Vienna, then under the supervision of\nKarl B\u00fchler, one of the founder members of the W\u00fcrzburg\nschool of experimental psychology. Popper\u2019s project was\ninitially designed as a psychological investigation of human memory,\non which he conducted initial research. However, the subject matter of\na planned introductory chapter on methodology assumed a position of\nincreasing pre-eminence and this resonated with B\u00fchler, who, as a\nKant scholar (a professor of philosophy and psychology), had famously\naddressed the issue of the contemporary \u201ccrisis in\npsychology\u201d. This \u201ccrisis\u201d, for B\u00fchler, related\nto the question of the unity of psychology and had been generated by\nthe proliferation of then competing paradigms within the discipline\nwhich had undermined the hitherto dominant associationist one and\nproblematized the question of method. Accordingly, under\nB\u00fchler\u2019s direction, Popper switched his topic to the\nmethodological problem of cognitive psychology and received his\ndoctorate in 1928 for his dissertation \u201cZur Methodenfrage der\nDenkpsychologie\u201d. In extending B\u00fchler\u2019s Kantian\napproach to the crisis in the dissertation, Popper critiqued Moritz\nSchlick\u2019s neutral monist programme to make psychology scientific\nby transforming it into a science of brain processes. This latter\nideal, Popper argued, was misconceived, but the issues raised by it\nultimately had the effect of refocusing Popper\u2019s attention away\nfrom B\u00fchler\u2019s question of the unity of psychology to that\nof its scientificity. This philosophical focus on questions of method,\nobjectivity and claims to scientific status was to become a principal\nlife-long concern, bringing the orientation of Popper\u2019s thought\ninto line with that of such contemporary \u201canalytic\u201d\nphilosophers as Frege and Russell as well as that of many members of\nthe Vienna Circle.\n\nPopper married Josephine Anna Henninger (\u201cHennie\u201d) in\n1930, and she also served as his amanuensis until her death in 1985.\nAt an early stage of their marriage they decided that they would never\nhave children. In 1937 he took up a position teaching philosophy at\nthe University of Canterbury in New Zealand, where he was to remain\nfor the duration of the Second World War.\n\nThe annexation of Austria in 1938 became the catalyst which prompted\nPopper to refocus his writings on social and political philosophy. He\npublished The Open Society and Its Enemies, his critique of\ntotalitarianism, in 1945. In 1946 he moved to England to teach at the\nLondon School of Economics, and became professor of logic and\nscientific method at the University of London in 1949. From this point\non his reputation and stature as a philosopher of science and social\nthinker grew, and he continued to write prolifically\u2014a number of\nhis works, particularly The Logic of Scientific Discovery\n(1959), are now widely seen as pioneering classics in the field.\nHowever, he combined a combative personality with a zeal for\nself-aggrandisement that did little to endear him to professional\ncolleagues. He was ill-at-ease in the philosophical milieu of post-war\nBritain which was, as he saw it, fixated with trivial linguistic\nconcerns dictated by Wittgenstein, whom he considered his nemesis.\nPopper\u2019s commitment to the primacy of rational criticism was\ncounterpointed by hostility towards anything that amounted to less\nthan total acceptance of his own thought, and in Britain\u2014as had\nbeen the case in Vienna\u2014he increasingly became an isolated\nfigure, though his ideas continued to inspire admiration.\n\nIn later years Popper came under philosophical criticism for his\nprescriptive approach to science and his emphasis on the logic of\nfalsification. This was superseded in the eyes of many by the\nsocio-historical approach taken by Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions (1962). In that work, Kuhn, who argued for\nthe incommensurability of rival scientific paradigms, denied that\nscience grows linearly through the accumulation of truths.\n\nPopper was knighted in 1965, and retired from the University of London\nin 1969, remaining active as a writer, broadcaster and lecturer until\nhis death in 1994.
