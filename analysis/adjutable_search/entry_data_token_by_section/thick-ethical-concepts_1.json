    "main_text": "Do Thick Concepts Have Distinctive Significance?\n2. Do Thick Concepts Have Distinctive Significance?\n\nIt is one thing to say that thick concepts are a distinctive kind of\nevaluative concepts, another to say that this gives them distinctive\nphilosophical significance not carried by thin concepts. Among various\narguments which attribute distinctive significance to thick terms and\nconcepts, two have been particularly influential: arguments concerning\nthe \u201cis-ought gap\u201d and the distinction between\nfacts and values, and the \u201canti-disentangling\u201d argument.\nWe\u2019ll also briefly address questions bearing on the relative\npriority of thick and thin concepts in evaluative thought.\n",
