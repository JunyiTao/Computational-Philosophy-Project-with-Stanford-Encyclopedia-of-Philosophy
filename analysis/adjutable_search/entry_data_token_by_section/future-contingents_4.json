    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on Rejection of the Principle of Future Excluded Middle || Jan \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Three-valued Semantics\n4.1 Jan \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Three-valued Semantics\n\nIn a series of articles during the 1920s and 30s the Polish logician\nJan \u0141ukasiewicz (1878\u20131956) advocated a particular\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the status of\nsentences about the contingent future, as developed in his sea-battle\nexample. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s interpretation crucially rests on a\nrejection of the principle of bivalence. In fact, this kind of\ninterpretation was not new, but had been formulated already by the\nEpicureans. However, \u0141ukasiewicz presented this position more\nclearly than had ever been done before, and developed it with the aid\nof modern symbolic logic. He used his interpretation of Aristotle and\nthe status of sentences about the contingent future as an argument\nagainst logical determinism and in favor of logical indeterminism, for\nwhich he declared his wholehearted support. In order to avoid\ndeterminism, he found it necessary to restrict the validity of\nbivalence by introducing a third truth-value. This truth-value,\n\u201cundetermined\u201d, is applied to contingent propositions\nregarding the future (McCall 1967, p. 64). For instance, a proposition\nstating that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow can be assigned the\ntruth-value undetermined today. This is because today it is not given\nor definitely determined whether the sea-battle is actually going to\ntake place tomorrow or not.\n\nIt is an important property of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s three-valued\nlogic that the truth-value of the disjunction of two undetermined\npropositions is undetermined, i.e., \\((p \\vee q)\\) is undetermined for\n\\(p\\) undetermined and \\(q\\) undetermined. This may be based on the\nobservation that since \\(p \\equiv(p \\vee p)\\), a disjunction of two\nundetermined propositions has to be undetermined. If \\(p\\) is\nundetermined, \\({\\sim}p\\) is also undetermined. It follows that \\((p\n\\vee{\\sim}p)\\) is undetermined for \\(p\\) undetermined. This problem\nalso occurs for future contingents such as \\(F(x)q\\) and\n\\(F(x){\\sim}q\\). According to \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic:\nif \\(F(x)q\\) and \\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) are two future contingents, i.e., if\nthey are both undetermined, then the same will be the case for the\ndisjunction of the two statements, \\(F(x)q \\vee F(x){\\sim}q\\). This\nmeans that the theory leads to the rejection of the principle of\n(P5).\n\nIn general, it does not seem possible to solve the problem of future\ncontingents in terms of three-valued semantics in a satisfactory\nmanner if the logic is truth-functional, i.e., if the truth-value of\nany proposition used in the logic is determined by the truth-values of\nits parts. As argued by Prior (1953, p. 326) it will not help to\nchange the truth-tables to something different from\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s model. As long as the model or theory is\ntruth-functional, it is obvious that the two disjunctions \\((F(x)q\n\\vee{\\sim}F(x)q)\\) and \\((F(x)q \\vee F(x)q)\\) will have the same\ntruth-value. From an intuitive and common sense point of view, this is\nnot satisfactory, since \\((F(x)q \\vee{\\sim}F(x)q)\\) is clearly true,\nwhereas \\((F(x)q \\vee F(x)q)\\) is undetermined, given that \\(F(x)q\\)\nis undetermined.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s interpretation of the Aristotelian text was\ndisputed by Prior (1962, p.240 ff.), who pointed out that there is a\nsignificant difference between \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic\nand Aristotle\u2019s text. Prior pointed out that according to\nAristotle it is true already today, that either there will\n\\(or\\) there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow, whereas this\ndisjunction, as just mentioned, is undetermined according to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic.\n",
