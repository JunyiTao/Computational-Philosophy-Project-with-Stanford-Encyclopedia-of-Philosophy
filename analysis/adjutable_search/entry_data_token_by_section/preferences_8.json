However, there is\nrelevant information about preferences that is not represented by the\nrelation \\(\\succ\\) itself. For example, when an agent expresses two\npreferences, say \\(A\\succ B\\) and \\(C\\succ B\\), one might ask how\nmuch the agent prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), in particular in\ncomparison to how much she prefers \\(C\\) to \\(B\\). To answer this\nquestion, one needs to determine both a measurement procedure for\nmeasuring preference intensities and a measurement scale for\nrepresenting these measurements. \n\nMeasurement scales that represent magnitudes of intervals between\nproperties, or even magnitudes of ratios between properties, are\ncalled cardinal scales. Although the discussion in the social\nsciences often merely distinguishes between ordinal and cardinal\npreference measures, it is important to further distinguish between\ninterval and ratio scales among the latter, as these require different\nassumptions to hold. An interval scale allows for meaningful\ncomparisons of differences (e.g. \u201c43\u00b0C is as much hotter than 41\n\u00b0C as 29\u00b0C is hotter than 27\u00b0C\u201d). In addition, a ratio\nscale also allows for meaningful comparisons of ratios (e.g. \u201c12m is twice\nas long as 6m\u201d). Although there have been some attempts to measure\npreferences on a ratio scale (in particular, see Kahneman and\nTversky\u2019s (1979) Prospect Theory, which requires a\nnatural zero point and thus a ratio scale), most efforts have focussed\non measuring preferences on an interval scale. \n\nThe basic idea of interval preference measurement is to assume that\nacts have uncertain consequences, and that each act is equivalent to a\nlottery between these outcomes. An agent who expresses a preference\nfor an act over others by choosing it thus expresses a preference for\nthe equivalent lottery over the lotteries equivalent to other acts.\nThe utilities of these acts are then determined as the expected\nutilities of the equivalent lotteries, calculated as the\nprobability-weighted average of the lottery\u2019s consequences. This\napproach was pioneered by Ramsey (1928) and refined by von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (1944); other approaches have been presented by Savage\n(1954/72) and Jeffrey (1965/90). There are substantial differences\nbetween these approaches and their respective assumptions. For more\ndetail, see\n decision theory.\n",
