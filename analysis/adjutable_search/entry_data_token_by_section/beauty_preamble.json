    "main_text": "\n\nThe nature of beauty is one of the most enduring and controversial\nthemes in Western philosophy, and is\u2014with the nature of\nart\u2014one of the two fundamental issues in the history of\nphilosophical aesthetics. Beauty has traditionally been counted among\nthe ultimate values, with goodness, truth, and justice. It is a\nprimary theme among ancient Greek, Hellenistic, and medieval\nphilosophers, and was central to eighteenth and nineteenth-century\nthought, as represented in treatments by such thinkers as Shaftesbury,\nHutcheson, Hume, Burke, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Hanslick,\nand Santayana. By the beginning of the twentieth century, beauty was\nin decline as a subject of philosophical inquiry, and also as a\nprimary goal of the arts. However, there was revived interest in\nbeauty and critique of the concept by the 1980s, particularly within\nfeminist philosophy.\n\nThis article will begin with a sketch of the debate over whether\nbeauty is objective or subjective, which is perhaps the single\nmost-prosecuted disagreement in the literature. It will proceed to set\nout some of the major approaches to or theories of beauty developed\nwithin Western philosophical and artistic traditions.\n",
