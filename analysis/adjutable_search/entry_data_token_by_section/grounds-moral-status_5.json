    "main_text": "What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)? || Distinguishing Reasons Constitutive of Moral Status from Other Reasons\n2.4 Distinguishing Reasons Constitutive of Moral Status from Other Reasons\n\nIt is helpful to bring out two points about FMS, the second of which\nis not discussed in the literature, but both of which, once made\nexplicit, would likely be accepted by those who work on FMS.\n\nFirst, the reasons mentioned in sections 2.1\u20132.3 ought to be\nunderstood as independent of special relationships, contracts, and\njoint commitments. They are impartial reasons, that is, every moral\nagent (human, intelligent Martian, etc.) has reason to act or forbear\nacting in the ways thus far discussed (McMahan 2005). So, for\ninstance, a parent has at least two reasons not to kill his own child:\na reason in virtue of the child\u2019s FMS, and a reason in virtue of\nthe parental relationship, which generates a special obligation for\nthis particular agent not to kill this particular child. In addition,\nthese reasons are independent of other facts about the action, for\nexample, the action\u2019s possible bad long-term effects. Instead,\nthey are reasons to treat the being this way for the being\u2019s own\nsake.\n\nSecond, it is important, methodologically speaking, not to infer moral\nstatus (full or otherwise) simply from the degree of wrongness or\nbadness of an act, from the existence of rights, or from the strength\nof reasons in favor of the act (including omissions). For example, it\nmight be worse for a parent to kill his own child than a\nstranger\u2019s child, but that does not mean that the children have\ndifferent moral status. The child has a right that her parent not kill\nher, in virtue of the special relationships between parents and their\nchildren, but this is in addition to, and separate from, the right not\nto be killed that the child has in virtue of her moral status. Or, to\ntake another example, there may be a large difference in the strength\nof reasons to save each of two beings from death, but this difference\nmay have little to do with the moral status of the beings. Both\nMcMahan (2002) and Singer (1993) hold, on quite different grounds,\nthat death is not very bad for most animals, while it is very bad for\nordinary adult human beings. Accordingly, on their views, the reason\nto save an ordinary adult human being from death is much stronger than\nthe reason to save, say, a rabbit from death. But this is not itself\nevidence of a higher moral status of the human being. The vast\ndifference in the benefits of aid in the two cases could, on its\nown, lead to a difference in the strength of reasons, which would\nbe fully compatible with the claim that the human and the rabbit have\nthe same moral status. (Of course, one can hold, on other grounds,\nthat they in fact have different status, as McMahan himself does.)\n\nCertain views might acknowledge that some humans lack FMS and yet\nemphasize that we ought, nevertheless, to treat them as though they\nhave FMS due to the bad effects that would otherwise follow. One bad\neffect would be the mistreatment of those who really do have FMS. For\nexample, someone might think that, for practical purposes, we need a\nvery straightforward, stable, and difficult to misinterpret criterion\nof moral status (such as treating being human as a sufficient\ncondition for FMS). If we don\u2019t treat all human beings as if\nthey have FMS, unclarity and moral confusion would ensue. It would\nopen the floodgates for different people to set the threshold capacity\nrequired for FMS differently, and thereby lead to mistaken\nunderinclusion and consequent mistreatment of vulnerable humans (such\nas drug convicts) who do in fact have FMS. Kant\u2019s remarks about\nthe treatment of animals can be interpreted along these lines. He\nargued that we have reasons to avoid cruelty to animals, and thus to\ntreat animals better than their (lack of) moral status implies, since\notherwise we might develop psychological propensities that could lead\nus analogously to mistreat humans who have FMS (Kant [LE], pp.\n212\u201313). Similarly, one might think that if we do not treat\nthose humans without FMS as having FMS, we might develop psychological\npropensities that could lead us to mistreat humans who have FMS.\nAnother bad consequence that can arise, at least were we to fail to\ntreat neonates as having FMS by permitting infanticide, is depriving\nwould-be adoptive parents of the opportunity to adopt (Warren 1996,\nPostscript).\n\nThere are also more self-interested possible bad consequences to\nconsider. Failure to treat infants as having FMS might lead to a lack\nof tenderness toward them, and thereby contribute to their turning\ninto people who will mistreat us when they are older (Feinberg 1980,\np. 198). Moreover, a rule of treating cognitively impaired human\nbeings as having FMS would ensure that we will be treated well should\nwe ever suffer from cognitive impairment (considered without\nendorsement by McMahan 2002, pp. 227\u20138).\n\nRegardless of the details, on all such proposals, the requirement of\ntreating a being as if it had FMS, or some other degree of moral\nstatus, to avoid bad consequences is not equivalent to that\nbeing\u2019s having this moral status: while the reasons adduced\nmight indeed be good reasons to treat the being as if it had the\nrequisite moral status, these reasons are not for the sake of that\nbeing, but rather for the sake of other beings.\n\nOther types of reasons for treating beings as if they had a certain\ndegree of moral status have also been offered. Some virtue ethicists\nclaim that we ought to avoid harming animals because harming them is\nincompatible with displaying the virtuous character traits we ought to\ndisplay (see the entry on the\n moral status of animals\n for details). Several contractualists (see section 6 below and the\nentry on\n contractualism)\n have argued that one may reasonably opt out of any agreement that\ndoes not afford sufficient moral status to one\u2019s children and\nothers one cares about, including those who are severely cognitively\nimpaired (Morris 2011, pp. 265\u2013267 and Carruthers 2011, pp.\n387\u2013394). Critics and proponents disagree whether these\nconsiderations can establish reasons (e.g., reasons not to interfere)\nthat are for these beings\u2019 sake; hence, it is unclear whether\nthey can establish the moral status of the beings in question.\n",
