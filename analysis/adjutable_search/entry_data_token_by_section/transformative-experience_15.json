    "main_text": "Existentialism: Choosing Authentically\n5. Existentialism: Choosing Authentically\n\nInvestigating decisions involving transformative experiences magnifies\nan existential problem as well. Recall from\n \u00a74\n that many of the strategies for making rational transformative\ndecisions fail to also preserve authenticity. When transformation is\non the table, who we are is at stake. And the choice of who we are is\nmore fundamental than the other types of decisions we make. Who we are\nprovides the framework from which we make other choices, so a choice\nthat could change who we are is a choice between frameworks that\nitself lacks a framework from which to deliberate. As Ullmann-Margalit\nputs it:\n\n\nAt bottom, we make our most fundamental choices of the canons of\nmorality, logic and rationality in total freedom and without appeal to\nreasons. They embody acts that this literature variously describes as\nnihilist, absurd, or leaps (of faith). (2006: 172)\n\n\nOn the flip side, what \u201cthis literature\u201d does permit is\nauthentic choice. For instance, deciding to transform without\nappealing to reason (perhaps because one cannot appeal to reason)\ncoheres well to the Sartrean idea that persons do not antecedently\nhave a particular telos. Rather, we are free to be our\nauthentic selves precisely because are unconstrained and can choose\nwho we want to be.\n\nOn this existentialist gloss, authenticity stands in tension with\nrationality when it comes to transformative experiences. On the one\nhand, we want to be able to rationally defend our big decisions to\nhave a child, marry a particular person, or commit to a vocation. But\non the other, these are the types of decisions that we also want to\nmake authentically, and that doesn\u2019t seem possible if\nwe\u2019re merely following what a decision procedure recommends. In\nfact, empirical research suggests that people do care deeply about\nauthenticity. Furthermore, people approach decisions perceived to\ninvolve authenticity differently from more ordinary ones. Oktar and\nLombrozo (2022) gave subjects vignettes in which deciding based on\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d (which was akin to standard decision\nmaking) conflicted with deciding based on intuition. For instance, one\nscenario involved picking between two people with whom to pursue a\nromantic relationship. One person is a better \u201con paper\u201d\nmatch, and it\u2019s stipulated that you believe the method that\ndetermines them as such is accurate. The other person is one with whom\nyou vibe with better in that sort of intangible, gut-feeling sort of\nway. Subjects leaned strongly toward pursuing a relationship with the\nlatter person (the \u201cintuition\u201d choice) instead of the\nformer (the \u201cdeliberation\u201d choice). They also perceived\nthis case as one that involves authenticity. In fact, when a choice\nwas perceived to involve authenticity, subjects favored\nintuition-based decisions over deliberation-based ones. The preference\nof for intuition over deliberation raises the question of whether\nthere are non-deliberative (in the sense of standard decision-making)\nprocedures that can help us choose in transformative decisions in a\nway that preserves authenticity.\n\nIn fact, there are accounts that purport to preserve authenticity\nwhile also preserving rationality. Paul (2014) favors\nchoosing on the basis of revelation. According to Paul, the decision\nshould be reframed as one that asks whether the agent wants to\ndiscover what life will be like and who the agent will become,\npost-transformation. Essentially, the agent chooses transformation for\nits own sake. In doing so, the agent chooses rationally by choosing in\naccordance with the preference for discovery. The agent also chooses\nauthentically by choosing based on the desire to know what the\nexperience will be like for them and who they will\nbecome once transformed. The problem is that choosing based on\nrevelation does not always seem appropriate given the import of many\ntransformative experience. For instance, many transformative\nexperiences involve other people, such as becoming a parent or\nmarrying someone. Choosing these experiences on the basis of\nrevelation fails to capture concern for the resulting child or the\nfuture spouse. Paul might respond that this objection to revelation is\na moral one, and that a similar objection could be levied if the\nchoice were made on the basis of self-interest. Thus, the objection\nmight not count specifically against revelation. However,\nthere\u2019s a second worry, which is that revelation doesn\u2019t\nhelp in cases where the decision lies between two transformative\noutcomes as opposed to a decision between the status quo and one\ntransformative outcome.\n\nCallard (2018) picks up on this last worry and points out that\nrevelation for its own sake lacks a mechanism for valuing different\nrevelations differently. Instead, Callard favors an account based on\naspiration and proleptic reasons. For Callard,\nproleptic reasons are provisional ones aimed at a good to which one\naspires but may only have an \u201cinchoate, anticipatory, and\nindirect grasp\u201d. For instance, someone who aspires to be a wine\nconnoisseur initially lacks any conception of what they are trying to\nappreciate or experience when they take a sip of wine. Importantly,\nproleptic reasons allow the aspirant to act rationally when they start\nthe process even though they lack knowledge of what the end goal is\nlike. Interestingly, these types of cases typically lack the sharp\ndiscontinuity that are associated with paradigm transformative\nexperiences like parenthood. In fact, Callard suggests that parenthood\nis not as discontinuous as assumed because potential parents often\ndedicate a lot of mental energy to the decision and learning all they\ncan about parenthood. What appears to be a climactic\n\u201clet\u2019s go for it\u201d is \u201cembedded in a longer\ntransformative journey\u201d (Callard 2018, 63). Putting all of this together,\ntransformative decisions can be made rationally via proleptic reasons\nand are authentic since they result from intentional deliberation\nabout who the agent hopes to become.\n\nChang (2015) offers an interestingly different way of approaching\ntransformative decision making. Chang starts by distinguishing between\nevent-based and choice-based transformations. The\nformer are the type that fit how transformative experiences are\ntypically described. They involve experiences that are downstream from\nthe choice\u2014like becoming a parent\u2014that transform the\nagent. The latter is where Chang\u2019s interest lies. Choice-based\ntransformation is one in which \u201cthe making of the choice itself\ntransforms you\u201d (Chang 2015, 240). Here, Chang has in mind cases in which one\ninvokes voluntarist reasons when making a decision. Voluntarist\nreasons are reasons generated by the will that\u2014on Chang\u2019s\naccount\u2014are appropriate when all other existing reasons\nunderdetermine what an agent ought to do. (Chang favors an account in\nwhich the will strengthens an existing reasons, but there are other\nvoluntarists like Korsgaard (1996) who hold that the will can create\nreasons ex nihilo.) Crucially, in willing a voluntarist\nreason, one simultaneously reveals themself to be the type of person\nfor whom that choice is rational. This type of account also appears to\npreserve authenticity (since what could be more authentic than\none\u2019s own will) and rationality (since adding the voluntarist\nreason to the mix tips the scales in favor of the choice that\u2019s\nbeen made). Of course, voluntarist accounts are somewhat\ncontroversial, so Chang\u2019s account of how to make transformative\nchoices would inherit all the worries that voluntarism does.\n\nAlhough these accounts\u2014Paul\u2019s, Callard\u2019s, or\nChang\u2019s\u2014all face worries, it is worth noting that\nif any of them work, then there is a way to preserve both authenticity\nand rationality even while respecting the original challenge of\ntransformative experience to standard decision making procedures.\nNone require knowing what the experience will be like or who will come\nout the other end. Nevertheless, one can still rationally and\nauthentically plunge into the unknown.\n",
