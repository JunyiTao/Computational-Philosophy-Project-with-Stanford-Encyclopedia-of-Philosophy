    "main_text": "The Intentionalist Strikes Back\n10. The Intentionalist Strikes Back\n\nOne line of argument to show that\n\n(1)\nThe artist intended x to mean p in work w\n\n\nis logically or epistemically related to\n\n(2)\nx means p in work w\n\n\nbegins by noting that the facts expressed by\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n may not be \u201cconstantly conjoined\u201d, but there\u2019s at\nleast a very strong correlation between the two: the great majority of\ncases of (1) are cases of (2), and the great majority of cases of (2)\nare cases of (1). More than that, given our knowledge of the world,\nit\u2019s plausible to assume that there\u2019s a causal relation\nbetween type-(1) facts and type-(2) facts: in general, type-(1) facts\nbring about or cause type-(2) facts. A universal causal law of the\nform, All M-type facts bring about or cause N-type facts,\nwouldn\u2019t be quite correct in this case, but neither would it be\nin the case of throwing rocks and breaking windows. The causal\ngeneralization is sound enough in both, however. \n\nThat much is common sense and is readily admitted by Beardsley. The\nintention of the artist and the aesthetic object \u201care causally\nconnected\u201d, Beardsley says in Aesthetics\n(Aesth: 19), and if two things, for example, Jones, Sr. and\nJones, Jr., are causally connected, then\n\n\nany evidence about the height of either of them will be\nindirect evidence about the height of the other, in virtue of\ncertain laws of genetics, according to which the tallness of the\nfather affects the probability that the son will be tall, though it\ndoes not, of course, render it certain\u00a0(Aesth:\n19\u201320).\n\n\nThus, Beardsley adds,\n\n\nIn the case of aesthetic object and intention we have direct evidence\nof each: we discover the nature of the object by looking, listening,\nreading, etc., and we discover the intention by biographical inquiry,\nthrough letters, diaries, workbooks\u2014or, if the artist is alive,\nby asking him. But also what we learn about the nature of the object\nitself is indirect evidence of what the artist intended it to be, and\nwhat we learn about the artist\u2019s intention is indirect evidence\nof what the object became. (Aesth: 20)\n\n\nThere are two important points to note about this passage. First,\nalthough Beardsley wrote that in his early work he was concerned\n\n\nwith the logical relevance of information about the intentions of an\nauthor to the interpretation\u2026 of his work,\n\n\nand he \u201ctook the position that there is no such relevance\u201d\n(II: 188), in the last sentence he admits that there is a\n\u201clogical relation\u201d between\n (1)\n and\n (2):\n (1) is indirect, inductive evidence of a causal sort for (2).\nReasoning from type-(1) facts to type-(2) facts is simply reasoning\nfrom causes to effects. Such reasoning doesn\u2019t yield certainty,\nbut it\u2019s generally dependable nonetheless. Thus, in at least\nmany cases, if we knew that the artist intended his work to mean\np, we would have good, though not definitive, reason for\nbelieving that his work means p.\n\nThe second point concerns the distinction between direct and indirect\nevidence drawn by Beardsley. A diary entry is direct evidence of what\nthe artist intended his work to mean; the artist\u2019s intention is\nindirect evidence of what his work means. But why the difference? In\nboth cases, the relation between the items is causal, yet in one the\nevidence is direct, and in the other indirect. If a diary entry is\ndirect evidence of an artist\u2019s intention (reasoning from an\neffect to a cause), then the artist\u2019s intention ought to be\ndirect evidence of what his work means (reasoning from a cause to an\neffect). That\u2019s a conclusion Beardsley certainly wants to avoid.\nIf, on the other hand, the artist\u2019s intention is indirect\nevidence of what his work means (reasoning, as just noted, from a\ncause to an effect), then a diary entry ought to be indirect evidence\nof what he intended (reasoning, again as just noted, from an effect to\na cause).\n\nThis second way of resolving the tension in Beardsley\u2019s remarks\nwould probably be more acceptable to him, but it still carries\nproblems in its train. What does the distinction between direct and\nindirect evidence amount to on it? Something like this: direct\nevidence that S is P is evidence gleaned from an\ninspection of S itself, no other objects being taken into\nconsideration or made epistemic use of. Indirect evidence that\nS is P is evidence that takes objects other than\nS into consideration, or that makes epistemic use of such\nobjects. Thus evidence respecting the height of Jones, Sr. is indirect\nevidence of the height of Jones, Jr., and conversely; diary entries\nare indirect evidence of an artist\u2019s intentions, and conversely;\nand an artist\u2019s intentions are indirect evidence of the meaning\nof his text, and conversely. Direct evidence of Jones, Jr.\u2019s\nheight requires scrutinizing him and not looking elsewhere, however,\nand by the same token direct evidence of the meaning of a work of art\nrequires scrutinizing it and not looking elsewhere.\n\nBut the problem with drawing the distinction this way is that objects\nother than the work of art itself often have to be consulted in order\nto know what the work means, and many of these objects have to be\nregarded as legitimate sources of information, lest interpretation\nbecome impossible. The OED is consulted by even the best of critics,\nand social histories are many times needed to understand cultural and\nhistorical references. Beardsley knows as much and, from \u201cThe\nIntentional Fallacy\u201d onward, insisted on the legitimacy of such\nsources. But as drawn, the distinction between direct and indirect\nevidence doesn\u2019t distinguish between dictionaries and diaries,\nand Beardsley never did define the direct evidence/indirect evidence\ndistinction with sufficient precision to put one on one side of the\ncritical fence, and the other on the other, and have them stay put.\nPerhaps the distinction can be drawn in some way along the lines\nindicated above (which are suggested by Beardsley\u2019s own\nremarks), but more rigor and a principled argument would be\nneeded.\n",
