    "main_text": "Types of Ambiguity || Pragmatic Ambiguity\n3.3 Pragmatic Ambiguity\n\nPragmatics has been claimed to be the study of many different things;\nbut for our purposes we can focus on two: speech acts and truth conditional pragmatics. \n3.3.1 Speech Acts\n\nSpeech act theory is complicated and it is not easy to offer a neutral\naccount of the typology or interpretation of speech acts. But,\nintuitively, an utterance (locutionary act) of the sentence \u2018The\ncops are coming\u2019 can be an assertion, a warning, or an\nexpression of relief. \u2018I\u2019m sorry you were raised so\nbadly\u2019 can be an assertion or an apology. \u2018You want to\ncook dinner\u2019 can function as a request or as an\nassertion. \u2018Can you pick me up later?\u2019 can function as a\nrequest or a question or both. And these are just examples of speech\nacts that are conventionally tied to these sentence forms. Many, if\nnot all, sentences can be used in multiple ways.\n\nInterestingly, these ambiguities are not always signaled by the\ncontent of the sentence. For example the following differ in their\npotential for use in speech acts though they seem to express similar\ncontent:\n\nCan you pass the salt?\nAre you able to pass the salt?\n\n\nSome creativity may allow (19) to function as a request but it is very\ndifficult compared to (18). As such, some theorists have been\ninterested in trying to determine whether sentence types constrain the\nspeech act potential of utterances of them (see Murray and Starr\n(2018) for an overview). \n3.3.2 Pragmatic Ambiguity\n\nAn interesting case of ubiquitous potential ambiguity is the notion, suggested by Donnellan (1966), that\nthe apparent referential use of some sentences with definite\ndescriptions. Donnellan writes:\n\nIt does not seem possible to say categorically of a definite\ndescription in a particular sentence that it is a referring expression\n(of course, one could say this if he meant that it might be used to\nrefer). In general, whether or not a definite description is used\nreferentially or attributively is a function of the speaker\u2019s\nintentions in a particular case. \u2026 Nor does it seem at all\nattractive to suppose an ambiguity in the meaning of the words; it\ndoes not appear to be semantically ambiguous. (Perhaps we could say\nthat the sentence is pragmatically ambiguous \u2026.) (Donnellan, p.\n297)\n\n\nPhilosophers puzzled a great deal over the import of a\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 ambiguity that wasn\u2019t a speech act\nambiguity or perhaps an ambiguity in what a speaker implies by\nuttering a sentence. Kripke (1977) and Searle (1979: p. 150 fn. 3)\nclaim that pragmatic ambiguity is conceptually confused \u2013 either\nthe sentence bears two interpretations and there is a vanilla\nambiguity or the sentence used in univocal but the speaker is using it\nto get across a different or additional piece of information. But the\nintuition that perhaps pragmatics has a great role to play in\ninterpretation than merely an account of inferences licensed by the\nneeds of conversational coherence has led philosophers to consider\nwhat ambiguity that resides in the interface of semantics and\npragmatics might look like (see Recanati (2010).\n3.3.3 Presuppositional Ambiguity\n\nAmbiguity can be found at the level of presupposition, terms of\nidentifying the presupposition triggered by a sentence/utterance, as\nwell. The case of \u2018too\u2019 is instructive. It has long been\nobserved that the word \u2018too\u2019 triggers presuppositions, as\nin:\n\nMaria solved the problem too.\n\n\nIt\u2019s natural on first read to think that (20) carries the\npresupposition that someone else solved the problem. But that need not\nbe the case: it may presuppose that Maria solved the problem as well\nas having done something else, as in:\n\nMaria came up with the problem. Maria solved the problem too.\n\n\nKent Bach (1982) explores the intriguing case of:\n\nI love you too.\n\n\nThis can mean (at least) one of four distinct things:\n\nI love you (just like you love me)\nI love you (just like someone else does)\nI love you (and I love someone else)\nI love you (as well as bearing some other relationship (i.e.\nadmiring) to you)\n\n\nIf none of these are true, \u2018I love you too\u2019 is clearly\ninfelicitous.\n",
