    "main_text": "Strength of Evidence || .2 Objections to Using Mathematical Probability to Interpret Standards of Proof\n3.3 The Weight of Evidence as the Degree of Evidential Completeness\n\nA third idea of evidential weight is prompted by this insight from\nKeynes (1921: 71):\n\n\nAs the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude of\nthe probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,\naccording as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the\nfavourable evidence; but something seems to have increased in\neither case,\u2014we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest\nour conclusion. I express this by saying that an accession of new\nevidence increases the weight of an argument. New evidence\nwill sometimes decrease the probability of an argument, but it will\nalways increase its \u201cweight\u201d.\n\n\nThis idea of evidential weight has been applied by some legal scholars\nin assessing the sufficiency of evidence in satisfying legal standards\nof\n proof.[25]\n At its simplest, we may think of weight in the context of legal\nfact-finding as the amount of evidence before the court. Weight is\ndistinguishable from probability. The weight of evidence may be high\nand the mathematical probability low, as in the situation where the\nprosecution adduces a great deal of evidence tending to incriminate\nthe accused but the defence has an unshakeable alibi (Cohen 1986:\n641). Conversely, the state of evidence adduced in a case might\nestablish a sufficient degree of probability\u2014high enough to\ncross the supposed threshold of proof on the mathematical conception\nof the standard of proof\u2014and yet lack adequate weight. In the\nmuch-discussed gate-crasher\u2019s paradox, the only available\nevidence shows that the defendant was one of a thousand spectators at\na rodeo show and that only four hundred and ninety nine tickets were\nissued. The defendant is sued by the show organiser for gate-crashing.\nThe mathematical probability that the defendant was a gate-crasher is\n0.501 and this meets the probabilistic threshold for civil liability.\nBut, according to the negation principle of mathematical probability,\nthere is probability of 0.499 that the defendant did pay for his\nentrance. In these circumstances, it is intuitively unjust to find him\nliable (Cohen 1977: 75). A possible explanation for not finding him\nliable is that the evidence is too flimsy or of insufficient\nweight.\n\nProponents of the mathematical conception of the standard of proof\nhave stood their ground even while acknowledging that weight has a\nrole to play in the Bayesian analysis of probative value and the\nsufficiency of evidence. If a party does not produce relevant evidence\nthat is in his possession, resulting in the court facing an evidential\ndeficiency, it may draw an adverse inference against him when\ncomputing the posterior probability (Kaye 1986b: 667; Friedman 1997).\nOne criticism of this approach is that, in the absence of information\nabout the missing evidence, the drawing of the adverse inference is\nopen to the objection of arbitrariness (Nance 2008: 274). A further\nobjection is that the management of parties\u2019 conduct relating to\nevidence preservation and presentation should be left to judges and\nnot to the jury. What a judge may do to optimize evidential weight is\nto impose a burden of producing evidence on a party and to make the\nparty suffer an adverse finding of fact if he fails to produce the\nevidence. This will serve as an incentive for the party to act in a\nmanner that promotes the interest in evidential completeness (Nance\n2008, 2010, 2016).\n\nCohen suggests that the standard of proof should be conceived entirely\nas a matter of evidential weight which, on his theory, is a matter of\nthe number of tests or challenges to which a factual hypothesis is\nsubjected to in court. He offers an account of legal fact-finding in\nterms of an account of inductive probability that was inspired by the\nwork of writers such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill. Inductive\nprobability operates differently from the classical calculus of\nprobability. It is based on inductive support for the common-sense\ngeneralisation that licences the drawing of the relevant inference.\nInductive support for a generalisation is graded according to the\nnumber of tests that it has passed, or, putting this in another way,\nby the degree of its resistance to falsification by relevant\nvariables. The inductive probability of an argument is equal to the\nreliability grade of the inductive support for the generalisation\nwhich covers the argument.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt represents the maximum level of\ninductive probability. The prosecution may try to persuade the court\nto infer that the accused was guilty of burglary by producing evidence\nto establish that he was found in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s\nhouse late at night with the stolen object on him. This inference is\nlicensed by the generalisation that normally if a stranger is found\nimmediately after a burglary in possession of the stolen object, he\nintentionally removed it himself. The defence may try to defeat the\ninference by showing that the generalization does not apply in the\nparticular case, for example, by presenting evidence to show that the\naccused had found the object on the street. The prosecution\u2019s\nhypothesis is now challenged or put to the test. As a counter-move, it\nmay produce evidence to establish that the object could not have been\nlying in the street as alleged. If the generalisations on which the\nprosecution\u2019s case rest survive challenges by the defence at\nevery possible point, then guilt is proved beyond reasonable\n doubt.[26]\n The same reasoning structure applies in the civil context except that\nin a civil case, the plaintiff succeeds in proof on the preponderance\nof evidence so long as the conclusion to be proved by him is more\ninductively probable than its negation. (Cohen 1977, 1986; cf. Schum\n 1979.)[27]\n\nCohen\u2019s theory seems to require that each test to which a\nhypothesis is put can be unequivocally and objectively resolved. But\nusually this is not the case. In our example, we may not be entirely\nconvinced that the accused found or did not find the object on the\nstreet, and our evaluation would involve the exercise of judgment that\nis no less subjective as the sort of judgments required when applying\nthe standard probabilistic conception of proof (Nance 2008:\n275\u20136; Schum 1994: 261).\n",
