In the later\nphilosophy, the ontological focus ultimately shifts to the claim that\nhuman Being consists most fundamentally in dwelling. This shift of\nattention emerges out of a subtle reformulation of the question of\nBeing itself, a reformulation performed in the Contributions.\nThe question now becomes not \u2018What is the meaning of\nBeing?\u2019 but rather \u2018How does Being essentially\nunfold?\u2019. This reformulation means (in a way that should become\nclearer in a moment) that we are now asking the question of Being not\nfrom the perspective of Dasein, but from the perspective of Being (see\nabove on abandoning subjectivity). But it also suggests that Being\nneeds to be understood as fundamentally a timebound, historical\nprocess. As Heidegger puts it: \u201cA being is: Be-ing holds\nsway [unfolds]\u201d. (Contributions 10: 22. Quotations from\nthe Contributions will be given in the form \u2018section: page\nnumber\u2019 where \u2018page number\u2019 refers to the Emad and\nMaly English translation. The hyphenated term \u2018be-ing\u2019 is\nadopted by Emad and Maly, in order to respect the fact that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger substitutes the archaic spelling\n\u2018Seyn\u2019 for the contemporary \u2018Sein\u2019 as a way of\ndistancing himself further from the traditional language of\nmetaphysics. This translational convention, which has not become\nstandard practice in the secondary literature, will not be adopted\nhere, except in quotations from the Emad and Maly\ntranslation.)\n\n\nFurther aspects of the essential unfolding of Being are revealed by\nwhat is perhaps the key move in the Contributions\u2014a\nrethinking of Being in terms of the notion of Ereignis, a term\ntranslated variously as \u2018event\u2019 (most closely reflecting\nits ordinary German usage), \u2018appropriation\u2019,\n\u2018appropriating event\u2019, \u2018event of appropriation\u2019\nor \u2018enowning\u2019. (For an analysis which tracks\nHeidegger's use of the term Ereignis at various stages\nof his thought, see Vallega-Neu 2010). The history of Being is now\nconceived as a series of appropriating events in which the different\ndimensions of human sense-making\u2014the religious, political,\nphilosophical (and so on) dimensions that define the culturally\nconditioned epochs of human history\u2014are transformed. Each such\ntransformation is a revolution in human patterns of intelligibility, so\nwhat is appropriated in the event is Dasein and thus the human capacity\nfor taking-as (see e.g., Contributions 271: 343). Once\nappropriated in this way, Dasein operates according to a specific set\nof established sense-making practices and structures. In a Kuhnian\nregister, one might think of this as the normal sense-making that\nfollows a paradigm-shift. But now what is it that does the\nappropriating? Heidegger's answer to this question is Being. Thus\nHeidegger writes of the \u201cEn-ownment [appropriation] of Da-sein by\nbe-ing\u201d (Contributions 141: 184) and of \u201cman as\nowned by be-ing\u201d (Contributions 141: 185). Indeed,\nthis appropriation of Dasein by Being is what enables Being to unfold:\n\u201cBe-ing needs man in order to hold sway [unfold]\u201d\n(Contributions 133: 177). The claim that Being appropriates\nDasein might seem to invite the adoption of an ethereal voice and a\nfar-off look in the eye, but any such temptation towards mysticism of\nthis kind really ought to be resisted. The mystical reading seems to\ndepend on a view according to which \u201cbe-ing holds sway \u2018for\nitself\u2019\u2009\u201d and Dasein \u201ctakes up the relating to\nbe-ing\u201d, such that Being is \u201csomething over-against\u201d\nDasein (Contributions 135: 179). But Heidegger argues that\nthis relational view would be \u2018misleading\u2019. That said, to\nmake proper inroads into the mystical reading, we need to reacquaint\nourselves with the notion of dwelling.\n\n\nAs we have seen, the term \u2018dwelling\u2019 appears in\nBeing and Time, where it is used to capture the distinctive\nmanner in which Dasein is in the world. The term continues to\nplay this role in the later philosophy, but, in texts such as\nBuilding Dwelling, Thinking (1954), it is reinterpreted and\nmade philosophically central to our understanding of Being. This\nreinterpretation of, and the new emphasis on, dwelling is bound up with\nthe idea from the Contributions of Being as appropriation. To\nexplain: Where one dwells is where one is at home, where one\nhas a place. This sense of place is what grounds\nHeidegger's existential notion of spatiality, as developed in the\nlater philosophy (see Malpas 2006). In dwelling, then, Dasein is\nlocated within a set of sense-making practices and structures with\nwhich it is familiar. This way of unravelling the phenomenon of\ndwelling enables us to see more clearly\u2014and more concretely\u2014what is meant by the idea of Being as event/appropriation.\nBeing is an event in that it takes (appropriates)\nplace (where one is at home, one's sense-making\npractices and structures) (cf. Polt 1999 148). In other words, Being\nappropriates Dasein in that, in its unfolding, it essentially\nhappens in and to Dasein's patterns of sense-making.\nThis way of thinking about the process of appropriation does rather\nless to invite obscurantist mysticism.\n\n\n\nThe reinterpretation of dwelling in terms of Being as appropriation\nis ultimately intertwined with a closely related reinterpretation of\nwhat is meant by a world. One can see the latter development in a\npregnant passage from Heidegger's 1954 piece, Building\nDwelling Thinking.\n\n\n[H]uman being consists in dwelling and, indeed, dwelling in the\nsense of the stay of mortals on the earth.\n\n But \u2018on the earth\u2019 already means \u2018under the\nsky.\u2019 Both of these also mean \u2018remaining before the\ndivinities\u2019 and include a \u2018belonging to men's being with\none another.\u2019 By a primal oneness the four\u2014earth and sky,\ndivinities and mortals\u2014belong together in one. (351)\n\n\n\nSo, human beings dwell in that they stay (are at home) on the earth,\nunder the sky, before the divinities, and among the mortals (that is,\nwith one another as mortals). It is important for Heidegger that these\ndimensions of dwelling are conceived not as independent structures but\nas (to use a piece of terminology from Being and Time)\necstases\u2014phenomena that stand out from an underlying\nunity. That underlying unity of earth, sky, divinities and mortals\u2014the \u2018simple oneness of the four\u2019 as Heidegger puts\nit in Building Dwelling Thinking (351)\u2014is what he\ncalls the fourfold. The fourfold is the transformed\nnotion of world that applies within the later work (see e.g., The\nThing; for an analysis of the fourfold that concentrates on its\nrole as a thinking of things, see Mitchell 2010). It is possible to\nglimpse the character of the world-as-fourfold by noting that whereas\nthe world as understood through Being and Time is a culturally\nconditioned structure distinct from nature, the world-as-fourfold\nappears to be an integrated combination of nature (earth and sky) and\nculture (divinities and mortals). (Two remarks: First, it may not be\nobvious why the divinities count as part of culture. This will be\nexplained in a moment. Secondly, the later Heidegger sometimes\ncontinues to employ the sense of world that he established in Being\nand Time, which is why it is useful to signal the new usage as the\ntransformed notion of world, or as the world-as-fourfold.)\n\n\nThere is something useful, as a preliminary move, about interpreting\nthe fourfold as a combination of nature and culture, but it is an idea\nthat must be handled with care. For one thing, if what is meant by\nnature is the material world and its phenomena as understood by natural\nscience, then Heidegger's account of the fourfold tells against\nany straightforward identification of earth and sky with nature. Why\nthis is becomes clear once one sees how Heidegger describes the earth\nand the sky in Building Dwelling Thinking. \u201cEarth is the\nserving bearer, blossoming and fruiting, spreading out in rock and\nwater, rising up into plant and animal\u2026 The sky is the vaulting\npath of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter\nof the stars, the year's seasons and their changes, the light and\ndusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency\nof the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether\u201d\n(351). What Heidegger's language here indicates is that the\nearth-as-dwelt-on and the sky-as-dwelt-under are spaces for a mode of\nhabitation by human beings that one might call poetic rather\nthan scientific. So, the nature of dwelling is the nature of the poet.\nIn dwelling we inhabit the poetic (for discussion, see e.g., Young 2002,\n99\u2013100).\n\n\nHow does this idea of dwelling as poetic habitation work for the\ncultural aspects of the fourfold\u2014dwelling among the mortals and\nbefore the divinities? To dwell among the mortals is to be\n\u201ccapable of death as death\u201d (Building Dwelling\nThinking 352). In the language of Being and Time, this\nwould be to enter into an authentic and thus non-evasive relationship\nwith death (see above). However, as we shall see in a moment, the later\nHeidegger has a different account of the nothing and thus of the\ninternal relation with the nothing that death involves. It is this\nreworking of the idea of the nothing that ultimately marks out a newly\nconceived non-evasive relationship with death as an aspect of dwelling,\nunderstood in terms of poetic habitation. The notion of dwelling before\nthe divinities also turns on the development of a theme established in\nBeing and Time, namely that intelligibility is itself cultural\nand historical in character. More specifically, according to Being\nand Time, the a priori transcendental conditions for\nintelligibility are to be interpreted in terms of the phenomenon of\nheritage, that is as culturally determined structures that form\npre-existing fields of intelligibility into which individual human\nbeings are thrown and onto which they project themselves. A key aspect\nof this idea is that there exist historically important individuals who\nconstitute heroic cultural templates onto which I may now creatively\nproject myself. In the later philosophy these heroic figures are reborn\npoetically as the divinities of the fourfold, as \u201cthe ones to\ncome\u201d (Contributions 248\u201352: 277\u201381), and as the\n\u201cbeckoning messengers of the godhead\u201d (Building\nDwelling Thinking 351). When Heidegger famously announces that\nonly a god can save us (Only a God can Save Us),\nor that \u201cthe last god is not the end but the other beginning of\nimmeasurable possibilities for our history\u201d\n(Contributions 256: 289), he has in mind not a religious\nintervention in an \u2018ordinary\u2019 sense of the divine, but\nrather a transformational event in which a secularized sense of the\nsacred\u2014a sensitivity to the fact that beings are\ngranted to us in the essential unfolding of Being\u2014is\nrestored (more on this below).\n\n\nThe notion of dwelling as poetic habitation opens up a path to what\nHeidegger calls \u2018the mystery\u2019 (not to be confused with the\nkind of obscurantist mysticism discussed above). Even though the world\nalways opens up as meaningful in a particular way to any individual\nhuman being as a result of the specific heritage into which he or she\nhas been enculturated, there are of course a vast number of alternative\nfields of intelligibility \u2018out there\u2019 that would be\navailable to each of us, if only we could gain access to them\nby becoming simultaneously embedded in different heritages. But\nHeidegger's account of human existence means that any such\nparallel embedding is ruled out, so the plenitude of alternative fields\nof intelligibility must remain a mystery to us. In\nHeidegger's later philosophy this mysterious region of Being\nemerges as a structure that, although not illuminated poetically in\ndwelling as a particular world-as-fourfold, nevertheless constitutes an\nessential aspect of dwelling in that it is ontologically co-present\nwith any such world. Appropriation is necessarily a twofold event: as\nDasein is thrown into an intelligible world, vast regions of Being are\nplunged into darkness. But that darkness is a necessary condition for\nthere to be any intelligibility at all. As Heidegger puts it in The\nQuestion Concerning Technology (330), \u201c[a]ll revealing\nbelongs within a harboring and a concealing. But that which frees\n[entities for intelligibility]\u2014the mystery\u2014is concealed\nand always concealing itself\u2026. Freedom [sense-making, the\nrevealing of beings] is that which conceals in a way that opens to\nlight, in whose clearing shimmers the veil that hides the essential\noccurrence of all truth and lets the veil appear as what\nveils\u201d.\n\n\nIt is worth pausing here to comment on the fact that, in his 1935\nessay The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger writes of a\nconflict between earth and world. This idea may seem to sit\nunhappily alongside the simple oneness of the four. The essay in\nquestion is notoriously difficult, but the notion of the mystery may\nhelp. Perhaps the pivotal thought is as follows: Natural materials (the\nearth), as used in artworks, enter into intelligibility by establishing\ncertain culturally codified meanings\u2014a world in the sense of\nBeing and Time. Simultaneously, however, those natural\nmaterials suggest the existence of a vast range of other possible, but\nto us unintelligible, meanings, by virtue of the fact that they\ncould have been used to realize those alternative meanings.\nThe conflict, then, turns on the way in which, in the midst of a world,\nthe earth suggests the presence of the mystery. This is one way to hear\npassages such as the following: \u201cThe world, in resting upon the\nearth, strives to surmount it. As self-opening it cannot endure\nanything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing,\ntends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there\u201d\n(Origin of the Work of Art 174).\n\n\nBecause the mystery is unintelligible, it is the nothing\n(no-thing). It is nonetheless a positive ontological\nphenomenon\u2014a necessary feature of the essential unfolding of\nBeing. This vision of the nothing, as developed in Heidegger's\nWhat is Metaphysics?, his 1929 inaugural lecture as Professor\nof Philosophy at Freiburg, famously attracts the philosophical disdain\nof the logical positivist Carnap. Carnap judged Heidegger's\nlecture to turn on a series of unverifiable statements, and thus to be\na paradigm case of metaphysical nonsense (Carnap 1932/1959; for a nice\naccount and analysis of the disagreement between Heidegger and Carnap,\nsee Critchley 2001). But placing Carnap's positivist critique to\none side, the idea of the nothing allows Heidegger to rethink our\nrelationship with death in relation to poetic habitation. In Being\nand Time, Being-towards-death is conceived as a relation to the\npossibility of one's own non-existence. This gives us a sense in\nwhich Dasein has an internal structural relation to the nothing. That\ninternal structural relation remains crucial to the later philosophy,\nbut now \u2018the nothing\u2019 is to be heard explicitly as\n\u2018the mystery\u2019, a kind of \u2018dark matter\u2019 of\nintelligibility that must remain concealed in the unfolding of Being\nthrough which beings are unconcealed. This necessary concealment is\n\u201cthe essential belongingness of the not to being as such\u201d\n(Contributions 160: 199). In Being-towards-death, this\n\u201cessential belongingness\u201d is \u201csheltered\u201d and\n\u201ccomes to light with a singular keenness\u201d\n(Contributions 160: 199). This is because (echoing a point\nmade earlier) the concealing-unconcealing structure of Being is\nultimately to be traced to Dasein's essential finitude. Sheehan\n(2001) puts it like this: \u201c[o]ur finitude makes all\n\u2018as\u2019-taking\u2026 possible by requiring us to understand\nthings not immediately and ontically\u2026 but indirectly and\nontologically (= imperfectly), through their being\u201d. In\nBeing-towards-death, the human finitude that grounds the mystery, the\nplenitude of possible worlds in which I am not, is highlighted. As\nmortals, then, our internal relation to death links us to the mystery\n(see The Thing). So dwelling (as poetic habitation) involves\nnot only embeddedness in the fourfold, but also, as part of a unitary\nontological structure, a necessary relationship with the mystery. (As\nmentioned earlier (2.2.7), it is arguable that the sense of the nothing\nas unactualized possibilities of Being is already at work in Being\nand Time (see Vallega-Neu 2003, 21). Indeed, Heidegger's\nexplicit remarks on Being-towards-death in the Contributions\n(sections 160\u20132) suggest that it is. But even if that is so, the idea\nundoubtedly finds its fullest expression in the later\nwork.)\n\n\nIf the essence of human Being is to dwell in the fourfold, then\nhuman beings are to the extent that they so dwell. And this\nwill be achieved to the extent that human beings realize the\n\u201cbasic character of dwelling\u201d, which Heidegger now argues\nis a matter of safeguarding \u201cthe fourfold in its\nessential unfolding\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking, 352).\nSuch safeguarding is unpacked as a way of Being in which human beings\nsave the earth, receive the sky as sky, await the divinities as\ndivinities, and initiate their own essential being as mortals. Perhaps\nthe best way to understand this four-way demand is to explore\nHeidegger's claim that modern humans, especially modern Western\nhumans, systematically fail to meet it. That is, we are marked out by\nour loss of dwelling\u2014our failure to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. This existential malaise is what Heidegger\nrefers to in the Letter on Humanism as the oblivion of Being.\nAs we are about to see, the fact that this is the basic character of\nour modern human society is, according to Heidegger, explained by the\npredominance of a mode of sense-making that, in the\nContributions, he calls machination, but which he\nlater (and more famously) calls technology. \n",
