    "preamble": "\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in Germany from\nroughly 1870 until the First World War. This movement drew inspiration\nfrom a diverse cast of philosophers\u2014principally, Kuno Fischer\n(Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878),\nFriedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and\nEduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))\u2014who in the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury were calling for a return to Kant\u2019s philosophy as an\nalternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser\n2014b). During the 1870s, the movement formed into two schools, one\nbased around Hermann Cohen at Marburg University and another based in\nsouthwest Germany (in the province of Baden) around Wilhelm\nWindelband. Later members of the Marburg School include Paul Natorp\nand Ernst Cassirer; later members of the Southwest School include\nHeinrich Rickert and Emil\n Lask.[1]\n\n Neo-Kantians[2]\n were not only intellectually influential, they were also great\nsuccesses academically in Germany. They held prominent academic\nchairs, and were successful in placing their students, shaping\ncurricula, and editing important journals and books. Most of the\nGerman philosophers who came to prominence in Germany after the First\nWorld War were educated by Neo-Kantians\u2014an impressive and\ncomprehensive list of students that includes Rudolf Carnap, Hans-Georg\nGadamer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans\n Reichenbach.[3]\n But the reputation of Neo-Kantianism shifted dramatically in the\ndecades after 1918. Neo-Kantians were associated with the old\norder, and so became the primary targets of the many philosophers\n(including their own students) wanting to make a completely fresh\nstart. The subsequent geopolitical upheavals, not the least of which\nwas Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, nearly erased the\ninstitutional memory of Neo-Kantianism within the emerging analytic\nand continental traditions. However, in the last few decades,\nhistorians of philosophy of all stripes have begun to re-discover both\nthe historical and philosophical significance of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nThis article has three parts. After giving an overview of the common\nfeatures of Neo-Kantians, section 2 is devoted to the Marburg School,\nand section 3 to the Southwest (SW) School. The Neo-Kantians were\nsystematic and comprehensive philosophers, writing on nearly every\narea of philosophy. Instead of attempting to cover all areas of their\nthought, this article will focus on the areas of their philosophies\nthat were most central to their thought, and that were most\ninfluential on their contemporaries and successors. Accordingly, each\nsection begins with each school\u2019s conception of philosophy\n(sections 2.1 and 3.1), moves on to their theory of knowledge (2.2 and\n3.2), and ends with the philosophy of the special sciences most\ncharacteristic of each school (2.3 on Marburg philosophy of physics,\nand 3.3 on SW philosophy of history). (Three supplementary documents\ncover philosophies of logic, psychology, and mathematics in the\nMarburg School.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Common Features of Neo-Kantians\n\nThe Neo-Kantians did not always think of themselves as members of a\ncommon movement. Though the members of the Marburg school very clearly\nidentified with one another, and the members of the Southwest school\nidentified themselves with one another, the two schools\n initially[4]\n made little effort to present themselves as part of a common\nmovement. Their doctrines were different in some fundamental ways, and\nthey often criticized one another\u2019s positions. Nevertheless,\nthere were some common features of Neo-Kantians of both\nschools\u2014common features that made it natural for their\ncontemporaries and for historians today to talk about them together.\nThis section presents seven common features of the Neo-Kantians.\nThese seven common features make it possible to distinguish, in a\nprincipled philosophical way, between the (\u201cclassical\u201d) Neo-Kantians\nof the Marburg and Southwest schools and the various \u201cback to\nKant\u201d philosophers of the mid nineteenth century and the\nassorted philosophers contemporary with the Neo-Kantians who were\n\u201cneo-Kantian\u201d in some broader sense. For example,\nHelmholtz and Lange did not share the Neo-Kantians\u2019\nanti-psychologism or commitment to the transcendental method (features\n2 and 3 below), while Alois Riehl did not share their idealistic\ntheory of objective validity (feature 6).\n\n1. Most obviously, the Neo-Kantians thought of\nthemselves as reviving, defending, and extending Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy. They self-consciously adopted Kant\u2019s vocabulary, and\nsome of his key ideas and arguments. They wrote commentaries on\nKant\u2019s major writings, and would often present their own\npositive views in the form of commentaries or interpretations of Kant.\nNevertheless, they never considered themselves to be orthodox\nKantians, nor did they see the value in defending Kant\u2019s views\non all topics. As Windelband famously said in the preface to the 1883\nfirst edition of Windelband\n 1915,[5]\n \u201cto understand Kant means to go beyond him\u201d. And, as\nNatorp explained, \n\n\nit was never anyone\u2019s wish nor intent to cling to Kant\u2019s\ndoctrines in an absolute way. Talk of an orthodox Kantianism within\nthe Marburg School was never justified. (Natorp 1912a: 180) \n\n\nIn fact, there were some core Kantian ideas that the Neo-Kantians\nself-consciously rejected. They rejected the doctrine of the\nthing-in-itself as incoherent and unnecessary (Windelband 1910: 323),\nor radically reinterpreted talk of things-in-themselves as talk of a\npostulated final and complete theory of the world (Cohen 1885:\n503ff.). Their rejection of Kant\u2019s dualism of appearances and\nthings-in-themselves was closely related to their rethinking of\nKant\u2019s distinction between two \u201cstems\u201d of cognition:\nsensibility and understanding. The Marburg philosophers came to\nfundamentally reject this distinction, while the Southwest\nNeo-Kantians (while maintaining the irreducibility of intuitions to\nconcepts) still rejected the idea that intuitions are the result of a\nmind-independent thing-in-itself affecting sensibility. Though the\nNeo-Kantians took as fundamental to their philosophies the existence\nof substantive a priori concepts and principles that make knowledge\npossible, they did not accept that the categories and principles\nidentified in the Critique of Pure Reason were complete or\nfixed for all time. In particular, Marburg Neo-Kantians believed that\nsome of the categories and principles that Kant identified were\nrelative to the scientific theories of Kant\u2019s day, and that the\ncategories and principles could change as scientists develop new\nempirical theories. Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand, were\nkeen to argue that history is just as much a science as mathematical\nphysics, and they thought that Kant\u2019s critical project had to be\nextended in order to identify the a priori elements in history. Last,\nthe classical Neo-Kantians held that transcendental philosophy is\ndistinct and independent of empirical psychology, even though (they\nargued) Kant himself was not always innocent of psychologism, despite\nthe fact that Kant\u2019s philosophy when rightly interpreted is the\nbasis for a sound anti-psychologism (Cohen 1883: \u00a78).\n\n2. The Neo-Kantians put forward a suite of arguments\nto show that philosophy is independent of psychology. Logic, or the\ntheory of knowledge, concerns what is objective, not what is\nsubjective, as psychology does (Cohen 1883: \u00a76). It does not\nconcern itself with the mental processes of subjects, with their\ncognitive apparatus, or with empirical results about human sense\norgans or nervous system. As Windelband 1883 put it, psychologistic\nphilosophers employ the \u201cgenetic method\u201d trying to find\nthe justification of some part of our knowledge by tracing empirically\nits causal antecedents. The correct method, however, is the\n\u201ccritical method\u201d, which distinguishes what he calls\n\u201cfactual\u201d from \u201cteleological\u201d or normative\nvalidity. The critical method is the only correct method, because the\nfact that we do believe something, or even that all humans by some\nbiological necessity have to believe it, does not yet solve the\ncritical question: what we ought to\n believe.[6]\n For these reasons, the Neo-Kantians sharply distinguished a priority\nfrom innateness\u2014a distinction they claimed was obscured by\nphilosophers such as Helmholtz and Lange.\n\nA return to an anti-psychologistic Kant was the Neo-Kantians\u2019\nsolution to what the historian Herbert Schn\u00e4delbach (1984: 5)\ncalled the \u201cidentity crisis\u201d that faced philosophy in the\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. Given the collapse of the conception\nof philosophy shared by post-Kantian speculative idealists, and the\nconcurrent spectacular advances made in the sciences, philosophers\nwere left questioning what (if anything) was left as the distinctive\nsubject matter and method of philosophy (Beiser 2014a: Ch.1). In\nparticular, in opposing psychologism, the Neo-Kantians were staking\nout a conception of philosophy that avoids the naturalism defended by\nmany German philosophers in the decades after Hegel\u2019s death\n(Cassirer 1912). According to naturalistic conceptions of philosophy,\nthe method of philosophy is in fact not distinguishable from that of\nnatural science, and the theory of knowledge just becomes applied\nempirical psychology. Nevertheless, the Neo-Kantians shared with these\nnaturalistic philosophers a deep distrust of speculative metaphysics:\nthey denied that philosophy could deliver knowledge of the\nsupersensible, could deduce facts of the special sciences from a\npriori principles knowable in some special philosophical way, or that\nphilosophy could even be done in ignorance of the results of the\nsciences.\n\n3. This via media, this third way of doing\nphilosophy, they found in the transcendental method. The two\nschools conceived of the transcendental method differently. For Cohen\nand his school, philosophy begins with a fact\u2014paradigmatically,\nthe fact of science\u2014and investigates the conditions that make\nthat fact possible. For Windelband and his school, the transcendental\nquestion is understood teleologically: given certain fundamental\ngoals, such as knowing the truth, or doing good, or experiencing what\nis beautiful, what is necessary for achieving these values? Still,\nthough, there was a common core to both schools\u2019 conceptions of\nthe transcendental method: they wanted to identify those objective\nelements within some part of human culture (say, physics, history, or\nethics) that made possible objective validity (say, the objective\nvalidity of physical theories, historical narratives, or ethical\nclaims). Adherence to the transcendental method led the Neo-Kantians\nto reject skepticism. Philosophical reflection begins with the fact\nthat scientists have developed successful theories of the physical\nworld; or with the universal validity of the value of truth. So no\nroom is left for the skeptical worry that scientific theories do not\nin fact deliver empirical knowledge, or that truth is in fact\nunattainable (Windelband 1883: 280).\n\n4. The object of the transcendental method, for the\nNeo-Kantians, is culture. Often, they approached human\nculture using Kant\u2019s three-fold distinction between knowledge,\nethics, aesthetics. Because they saw the achievements of science as\none of the most significant aspects of modern culture, a good portion\nof their writings concern the philosophy of science. As Kant\napplied the transcendental method to Newtonian science, they sought to\napply the method to the best science of their day. Typically (not\nexclusively), the Marburg philosophers were concerned with the physics\nand mathematics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,\nwhich (they emphasized) differed fundamentally from that of\nKant\u2019s own day. The Southwest Neo-Kantians, on the other hand,\nwere more concerned with the so-called\n\u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (the \u201chuman\nsciences\u201d), which had come into their own in the nineteenth\ncentury and now deserved (they argued) to be recognized as autonomous\nand fully scientific (despite the fact that Kant himself had sharply\ndistinguished history from science (Kant 1786: Ak 4:468)).\n\n5. Neo-Kantian philosophy of science is distinctive\nin its focus on the methodology of science. Thus, Neo-Kantian\nphilosophy of physics is not so much concerned directly with what\nmatter is, but with how mathematical physics comes to know about\nmatter. Neo-Kantian philosophy of history is not concerned with grand\ntheories concerning what drives history, but with what makes the\nmethodology of a historian different from that of a physicist or\nempirical psychologist. Philosophy of science, for them, is the\nlogic of the sciences\u2014in the extended sense of\n\u201clogic\u201d that includes theory of knowledge and scientific\nmethodology. And, true to their anti-psychologistic conception of\nlogic, Neo-Kantian accounts of scientific methodology are not intended\nto be empirical descriptions of what scientists do, but accounts that\nidentify objective norms, or the fundamental principles and concepts\nof a particular\n science.[7]\n Philosophy of science thus becomes a second order discipline,\ndifferent in kind from the natural sciences (thus avoiding\nnaturalism). But because Neo-Kantian philosophy of science adheres to\nthe transcendental method, it avoids the errors of speculative\nmetaphysics. It does not, for instance, try to derive the concept of\nmatter or life a priori, but is content to demonstrate that these\nconcepts are necessary conditions for physics and biology. Since\nphilosophy of science for the Neo-Kantians is a second order\ndiscipline, they were in general committed to a non-revisionist\nattitude. According to Rickert, philosophy \n\n\ndoes not claim to direct science onto the paths it should take. On the\ncontrary, it proposes only to follow science with a view to\nunderstanding it. (1902: 340) \n\n\nFor Cassirer, \u201ccritical philosophy \u2026 does not seek to\ndirect the sciences but to understand them\u201d (1907b: 31).\n\n6. Since the goal of transcendental philosophy, for\nthe Neo-Kantians, is to identify those elements within some part of\nhuman culture that are necessary for its objective validity,\nthey were also led to investigate the nature of objective validity\nitself (Natorp 1887, Rickert\n 1915).[8]\n The two schools construed the question of objective validity\ndifferently. The Marburg philosophers emphasized objectivity, and gave\nan account of objectivity in terms of constant laws (see\n section 2.2).\n The Southwest Neo-Kantians emphasized the question of\nvalidity\u2014specifically the validity of values\n (section 3.2).\n For both schools, a central issue in the investigation of objective\nvalidity is the question of transcendence: what does it mean\nthat the object is independent of our knowledge and provides the\nstandard for its truth?\n\nThere are four key ideas that are common to the Southwest and Marburg\ntheories of objective validity. First, both schools emphasized the\ncentrality of judgments (as opposed to concepts or intuitions), as the\nkind of representation that first makes objective validity possible\n(Rickert 1915: Ch.3; Cohen 1902: \u00a710\u201311). Second, the\nNeo-Kantians were emphatic that the objective validity of knowledge\ndoes not consist in its being a copy (Abbild) or mirror of\nthe object (Windelband 1910; Rickert 1934; Cassirer 1910: Ch.1;\nRickert 1915: Ch.2). This \u201ccopy theory\u201d of knowledge is\ninconsistent with a third key idea, that the objective validity of\nevery area of culture is made possible by substantive a priori\nprinciples. The a priori principles that make possible some part of\nhuman culture are again not interpreted psychologistically: they are\nnot features of the minds of individual subjects, they are not\ndiscovered empirically, and their necessity is not grounded in the\nempirical fact that they are universally accepted. These a priori\nprinciples are parts of culture\u2014they are its fundamental norms\nor laws. Fourth, the Neo-Kantians described themselves as\n\u201cidealists\u201d. Idealism meant different things to different\nNeo-Kantians (see\n section 2.2\n and\n 3.2).\n But all Neo-Kantians shared the view that knowledge requires a priori\nelements that are not present in what is given in immediate intuition.\nKnowledge, then, requires a \u201creshaping\u201d or\n\u201ctransformation\u201d of what is given. The copy theory that\nthey reject would in this sense be a kind of \u201crealism\u201d. Of\ncourse, Neo-Kantian idealism must be rigorously distinguished from\nother kinds of idealisms. As noted earlier, they reject Kant\u2019s\ndoctrine of the thing-in-itself, and they emphatically do not believe\nthat objects are in any way subjective or dependent on the\nrepresentations of individual psychological subjects.\n\n7. There is one final common feature of Neo-Kantian\nphilosophers that should not be overlooked: the Neo-Kantians were\ngreat historians of philosophy. It\u2019s not surprising that the\nNeo-Kantians wrote extensively on Kant, producing commentaries (e.g.,\nCohen 1885; Cassirer 1918) and critical editions of his writing. But\nthe Neo-Kantians also wrote extensively on other philosophers, ancient\nand modern, and on the history of science and mathematics (e.g.,\nWindelband 1891; Cassirer 1906, 1907a). These historical works were\nnot thought of as side projects, but as essential aspects of their\nphilosophy. Neo-Kantians did not sharply distinguish history of\nphilosophy from philosophy (see Introduction to Windelband 1891;\n\u00a7I of the 1902 version of Cohen 1898).\n2. The Marburg School\n\nThe intellectual beginnings of the Marburg School can be traced to\n1871, when Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) published the first edition\nof his Kants Theorie der Erfahrung (Kant\u2019s Theory\nof Experience), which interpreted Kant in an anti-psychologistic\nway and found in Kant\u2019s first Critique the expression\nof a novel way of doing philosophy: the transcendental method. In 1873\nCohen did his Habilitation in Marburg under Friedrich Lange, who had\nmoved there in 1872. He was promoted as Professor Extraordinarius in\n1875, and then took over Lange\u2019s chair in 1876 after his death.\nWhen Paul Natorp (1854\u20131924) moved to Marburg in 1880 (writing\nhis Habilitation\u2014Natorp 1881\u2014under Cohen and being\npromoted to Professor in 1893), the \u201cMarburg\u201d school as an\ninstitutional force was born.\n\nCohen\u2019s work culminated in a three part system of philosophy,\nmodeled after Kant\u2019s own tripartite division of critical\nphilosophy: The Logic of Pure Knowledge (Cohen 1902), The\nEthics of Pure Will (Cohen 1904), and the Aesthetics of Pure\nFeeling (Cohen 1912). His most influential works, though, were\nhis interpretation of Kant, principally in Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience, which was significantly revised and expanded in a\nsecond edition (Cohen 1885), and his works in the philosophy of\nscience and mathematics: The Principle of the Infinitesimal\nMethod (Cohen 1883), and his introduction to the sixth edition of\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism (Cohen\n 1898).[9]\n\nNatorp\u2019s most influential writings are in the interpretation of\nPlato, the philosophy of science, and in the philosophy of psychology.\nStarting with his habilitation (\u201cDescartes\u2019s Theory of\nKnowledge: A Study in the Pre-history of Criticism\u201d) in 1881,\nNatorp extended the reach of the Marburg school as historians of\nphilosophy beyond Kant to other philosophers who in various ways\nanticipated the Kantian themes important to the Marburgers.\nNatorp\u2019s most significant work in this vein was his book\nPlato\u2019s Theory of Ideas (1903), which gave a serious\nscholarly argument for the dating of Plato\u2019s dialogues, in\naddition to a novel \u201ccritical\u201d reading of Platonic ideas.\nIn the philosophy of science, his systematic work The Logical\nFoundations of the Exact Sciences (1910) gives a systematic\nphilosophy of logic, arithmetic, geometry, and physics that engages\nwith contemporary science and mathematics in a more comprehensive and\ndetailed way than any of Cohen\u2019s works. Last, in a series of\nworks in the philosophy of psychology (culminating in General\nPsychology According to the Critical Method (1912b)), Natorp\ndefended a novel conception of psychology as the science of the\nsubjective.\n\nAmong the many students of Cohen and Natorp\u2019s who identified\nthemselves with the Marburg school, the most accomplished and\ninfluential was undoubtedly Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945). After\nwriting his dissertation under Cohen in 1899 on Descartes\u2019s\nphilosophy of mathematics and science, Cassirer moved to Berlin, where\nhe worked as a Privatdozent (though not a Professor, which was ruled\nout by institutional\n anti-Semitism[10]).\n His most important works before 1914 are in the history of philosophy\n(especially the massive, two volume Problem of Knowledge\n(Cassirer 1906, 1907a), which follows the development of the\nphilosophy of science from the late Renaissance to Kant), and the\nphilosophy of the exact sciences (Substance and Function,\n1910; Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, 1921). Starting\nin 1921, Cassirer\u2019s philosophy broadened into a\n\u201cphilosophy of symbolic forms\u201d, which differs in some\nfundamental ways from the classic works of his teachers.\n2.1 Conception of Philosophy: The Transcendental Method \n\nThe core commitment of the Marburg school was to a philosophical\nmethod: \u201cthe transcendental method\u201d (Natorp 1912a; Cohen\n1883: \u00a77\u20139; Cohen 1885: \u00a712; Richardson 2006). The\nmethod, as Natorp describes it, comes in two steps. In the first step,\nthe philosopher identifies some \u201cfact\u201d of culture.\nTheoretical philosophy begins with the \u201cfact of science\u201d;\npractical philosophy with the fact of \u201csocial order\u201d;\naesthetics with the fact of \u201cartistic creation\u201d. These\nfacts are concrete, detailed, and \u201chistorically\nverifiable\u201d. For instance, a theoretical philosopher begins by\ninvestigating the best scientific theories of her contemporaries. In\nthis first step, the philosopher is like a fact collector,\ninvestigating the methods, important concepts and laws of that aspect\nof culture, including the historical development of that area of\nculture up to the present day. In the second step, however, the\nphilosopher goes beyond fact-collecting to identifying those aspects\nof that area of culture that make its objective validity possible. As\nthey put it, this involves identifying the \u201claws\u201d or\n\u201cform\u201d of that area of culture. Their model here is Kant\nin the Prolegomena. As they read Kant, he began by\nidentifying within the best scientific theory of his\ntime\u2014Newton\u2019s\u2014the fundamental laws, concepts, and\nmethods (which are contained in Kant\u2019s Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science). The second step is showing how\nthese laws, concepts, and methods are made possible by even more\nfundamental concepts and laws, which are contained in the\nCritique itself\u2014laws which make objective validity\npossible.\n\nThere are a few aspects of this method that need to be emphasized.\nFirst, the second step in the method involves much more than just\nidentifying a class of basic laws and concepts. If a philosopher were\nto axiomatize a physical theory, even a fundamental one, for the\nMarburgers that would be only the first step. A philosopher also needs\na story of how just these laws and just these concepts make it\npossible for the theory to make true claims about objects\u2014a\nstory that will require a very general account of objective validity\nitself. Second, the transcendental method requires demonstrating the\nunity of culture. A philosophy of arithmetic should show how the laws\nof arithmetic fit in with the laws of geometry and analysis to form\nthe unity of mathematics; how the laws of mathematics are\npreconditions of all natural science to form the unity of science; and\nall the way up to the unity of culture. Third, these two steps are\ninterrelated. The notion of objective validity itself is analyzed in\nstep two on the basis of reflection on the details of concrete culture\nfrom step one; the philosopher in step one collects the relevant facts\nabout an area of culture because she has in mind the step two goal of\nexplaining its objective validity, in a unified account of the\nvalidity of all culture. Fourth, the method is non-skeptical,\nnon-revisionary, and unconcerned with certainty. Since it takes an\narea of culture as a fact, it rules out radical skepticism about the\nvalidity of an area of culture, and it has no room to advocate a\nradical revision in that area of culture. Though the goal of the\ntranscendental method is to provide foundations for culture, these\nfoundations are not meant to be certain. Transcendental logic, one\nmight say, is a semantic, not a Cartesian project. Fifth, though the\ntranscendental method is rooted in the concrete facts of contemporary\nculture, it is nevertheless possible and even necessary for a\nphilosopher to take sides on contested questions within culture. A\nphilosopher is not a bystander in culture. So, for instance, Cohen\nargues for infinitesimal over limit methods in the calculus, for\nHerz\u2019s mechanics over its rivals, for liberal democracy over\nmonarchy. After all, the transcendental philosopher, having studied\nthe method of an area of culture and its long historical development,\ncan show that one party in a dispute has departed in some fundamental\nway from that method. And the philosopher also has her eye on the\nquestion of the foundations of the objective validity of an area of\nculture (and its integration into a synthetic account of the objective\nvalidity of all culture), and so can intervene to show that one\napproach in a controversy is better suited to make objective validity\npossible.\n\nSince the transcendental method begins with the fact of culture,\nMarburg Neo-Kantians reject the possibility of speculative\nmetaphysics. Transcendental philosophy as they understand it is also\ndistinct from and independent of psychology. Though the goal of the\ntheory of knowledge is to understand what makes\n\u201cexperience\u201d possible, they understand experience in a\nradically non-psychological way. As Cohen puts in (1898: x, my\ntranslation):\n\n\nThe transcendental method does not research the principles of human\nreason but rather the foundation of science that conditions scientific\nvalidity. Our organization is, insofar as it comes into question in\ngeneral, a question of psychology; and there is at least no\nmethodological means for procuring secure, scientific, and exact\ninformation from the ultimate and simplest parts of our mental\nessence. But the sciences lie before us in books. What makes them into\nsciences, wherein their character of generality and necessity rests,\nfrom which concepts their epistemological validity within their region\ncan be derived, what tools and ways of knowing explain in its validity\nthose historical facts of knowledge\u2014the sciences\u2014this is a\nmethodological question, this is the question, which the sciences\nthemselves pose, whenever they feel the impulse to think about their\nown principles\u2014this and nothing else is the transcendental\nquestion.\n\n\nThe fact of science does not occur in the minds of individual\nscientists; it lies before us in books. \u201cExperience\u201d is\nnot a representation in the mind of a knower; it is the objective\ncontent. \u201cExperience\u201d is virtually equated with\nmathematical natural science, and a paradigm \u201cexperience\u201d\nis Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. What makes experience\n(in this non-psychological sense) possible is \u201ca priori\u201d,\nnow interpreted in a radically non-psychological sense as elements of\nthe content of some aspect of culture that makes the objective\nvalidity of that culture possible. This new conception of the a\npriori, radically distinct from innateness and independent of any\nfacts about human minds discoverable by empirical psychology, is\narticulated in Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience. It is here that Cohen\u2019s Neo-Kantianism breaks\ndecisively with the Kantianism of Lange and Helmholtz. In his book,\nCohen distinguishes between the \u201cmetaphysical a priori\u201d\nand the \u201ctranscendental a priori\u201d (1885: 109; cf. 1902:\n44). The metaphysical a priori are the basic structures of our\nthinking that we can discover by introspection or empirical study;\nthese are irrelevant to the transcendental philosopher (unless she is\ndoing philosophy of psychology). The transcendental a priori, on the\nother hand, are those aspects of the content of science that make\nobjective validity possible. Thus, the relationship between the a\npriori and experience is not like the relationship between a mental\napparatus and its acts. It is a logical relationship, more like the\nrelation between an axiom and a theorem (Cassirer 1918: 151,\n153)\u2014though with the important qualification that the a priori\nlaws are not just axioms, but axioms that have the special semantic\nfunction of making objective validity possible.\n\nThe fact of culture is not static, but dynamic. As Natorp memorably\nput it (1912a: 184; 1910: Ch.1, \u00a74; 1903: 366ff), the fact is not\na \u201cfactum\u201d (a thing done) but\n\u201cfieri\u201d (becoming). Culture changes; one\nscientific theory replaces another. In keeping with the transcendental\nmethod, only a Newtonian could have written what Kant wrote; but the\ntranscendental method just as emphatically requires that later\ntranscendental philosophers rethink the doctrines of the first\nCritique in light of the advances in mathematics and natural\nscience since Newton. This appreciation for the historically evolving\ncharacter of culture has two consequences. First, the transcendental a\npriori is not absolute, but relative to the current best physical\ntheories. Second, Marburg Neo-Kantians have an additional\ntranscendental task that Kant himself did not fully recognize: to\nunderstand how it is possible that the changes in an area of\nculture can themselves be objectively valid. They want to understand\nthe objective law or method that determines how an area of culture\n changes.[11]\n This emphasis on the objectivity and lawlikeness of cultural change thus\nintroduces a check on the potential relativistic or historicist\nconsequences of their relativizing the a priori. (Cassirer in\nparticular develops a sophisticated theory of the a priori with both\nrelative and absolute elements; see\n section 2.3.)\n This emphasis on the progressive character of culture leads the\nMarburg Neo-Kantians to adopt a distinctive, historical method of\nwriting and arguing, in which systematic philosophy is not separated\nfrom the history of philosophy and the history of\n culture.[12]\n2.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe core of the Marburg Neo-Kantian theory of knowledge is a\nconception of \u201cobjective validity\u201d (Natorp 1887; Cohen\n1902: \u00a711). By the \u201cobjective validity\u201d of knowledge,\nthey mean its objectivity (that is, its independence from\nindividual subjects), its truth, and its relation to\nobjects. A theory of objective validity is then also a theory\nof the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object\u2014in what sense\nthe object is an independent standard of correctness for knowledge. A\ngood way to approach the Marburg theory is by considering an\nalternative they reject. Consider the view that \u201cobjects in\nthemselves are there, outside and independent of all subjectivity,\nwithout any original relation to it\u201d. That is, begin your theory\nof objective validity with the notion of an independent object, taken\nas a theoretical given. This notion of an object is then used to\nexplain aboutness, truth, and objectivity. A representation is about\nan object, say, if it is caused by an object or, perhaps, it resembles\nit. A representation is true if it then mirrors or copies the object\nas it is independently of us. And then knowledge is objective if it is\nabout an independent object, not about the subject and its states. For\nMarburg Neo-Kantians, this theory of objective validity (which they\ncall \u201cnaive realism\u201d) simply presupposes the very thing it\nis supposed to explain:\n\n\nPerhaps this actually means something correct, but at least as it is\npresented, it is not really an answer to the question [What is\nobjective validity?]. The being-in-itself of the object is itself an\nenigma and thus cannot serve as a solution to our present enigma. If\nwe understood what it meant to say the object in itself is there\nindependent of all subjectivity and then is appropriated in our\nsubjectivity by knowledge there would be no problem in the knowing of\nobjects or in the objectivity of knowledge. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\n\nThe Marburg theory of objective validity, on the other hand, turns\nthis order of explanation on its head: instead of beginning with the\nnotion of an object as its explanatory primitive, it sees the notion\nof an object as dependent on many other prior notions. In particular,\nit begins its account of objective validity with a distinctive\naccount of objectivity.\n\nObjectivity, according to the Marburg view, depends on laws. For\nexample, a particular physical thing (say a table in a room) appears\nin a certain way from my own subjective point of view in the room. To\nachieve an objective representation of the table, I would need to\nunderstand how all of the various appearances at various points of\nview in the room are related to one another in a law-like way. When I\nknow the law, I\u2019ve moved from appearance to reality, from\nsubjectivity to objectivity. If there is no such law, then there is\nonly appearance, and I cannot speak about an independent object and\nits properties. This simple point generalizes at higher levels. It\nmerely appears from our subjective point of view that the earth is\nstationary and the sun moves. But it is objectively the case that the\nearth moves around the sun because the heliocentric model follows from\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion. Even more fundamentally,\nscientific theories (such as Newton\u2019s) are developed, adopted,\nand abandoned as science progresses; this whole progression is itself\nobjective because there are \u201claws\u201d (that is, a common\nscientific method) that prescribe these changes. These laws secure the\n\u201cunity\u201d of knowledge: the various appearances of the same\nparticular are united as of the same particular object by a law; a law\nof nature unites various observed phenomena under it; the scientific\nmethod unites science in its development, prescribing a uniquely\ncorrect path to follow. This unity can also be described as\n\u201cpermanence\u201d: the appearances change, even as the object\nstays the same; the planets move, but the law remains; theories come\nand go, but the method stays constant. This notion of objectivity as\nlawfulness is then used to give an account of truth and objecthood.\nKnowledge is true if it can be unified with other knowledge within an\nobjective system of knowledge. Last, an object is then what is known\nby fully objective knowledge: \n\n\nthe object signifies the law; it signifies the lasting unity in which\nthe changing manifold of appearance is unified and determined in\nthought. (Natorp 1887: \u00a74)\n\n\nThis theory of objective validity has some notable consequences.\nFirst, the possibility of objective validity requires that we\npostulate, as a regulative ideal, a final science. The unity of\nknowledge through laws that the Marburgers point to as the foundation\nof objective validity has clearly not yet been achieved: there are\nstill phenomena that have not yet been explained, and our current\ntheories are certainly not going to be the final word. But it is\nclearly the case that even now we can know objects, even if our\nknowledge is partial. If unity through laws makes objectivity validity\npossible and that unity has not yet been achieved, how then can we\nknow any objects at all? We have to postulate that our current, only\npartially unified knowledge can progress in a law-like way into a\nunique, final theory. Such a final theory can never actually be\nachieved, because the task of knowledge is infinite\u2014there is\nalways more to understand, deeper explanations to give. The postulated\nfinal theory is like the asymptote that a curve never quite reaches.\nThis viewpoint\u2014that speaking of an object contains the demand\nfor unity of knowledge, that this task is infinite, that we must\ntherefore postulate the possibility of its completion\u2014Natorp\ncalls the \u201cgenetic view of knowledge\u201d (1910: Ch.1,\n\u00a74\u20135). The genetic view delivers a unique way of cashing\nout the \u201ctranscendence\u201d of the object. The fact that the\nobject is independent of knowledge, in the sense that it always\ntranscends our knowledge of it, is expressed by the infinity of the\ntask of knowledge. And the fact that the object is the standard for\nknowledge is expressed by the postulate that the course of knowledge\nis moving asymptotically towards a unique (though infinite) endpoint\nas its goal. Second, the emphasis on lawfulness gives the Marburgers a\nsatisfying explanation of the application of mathematics to the\nobjects of natural science: the laws of natural science are\nmathematical, and there would be no objects if there were no laws of\nnatural science. Third, since objectivity is explained in terms of\nlaws, and laws are a special kind of universal judgment, the Marburg\ntheory of objective validity emphasizes the priority of judgments over\nconcepts (Cohen 1902: \u00a710). As Cohen memorably put it, modifying\nGalileo\u2019s phrase: the book of nature is written in\nsentences (with mathematics as its letters, and the a priori\nprinciples of pure knowledge as its syntax) (1902: 204, 484).\n\nIn addition to their theory of objective validity, another core\ncommitment in the mature writings of the Marburg school is a rejection\nof the \u201cgiven\u201d. In this, they are explicitly departing\nfrom Kant. Kant had argued that our cognitive faculty has two stems: a\nreceptive faculty (sensibility), and a spontaneous faculty\n(understanding). Through sensibility, objects are given to us, and\nthrough the understanding, objects are thought. The representations of\nsensibility are intuitions, which relate to objects immediately; the\nrepresentations of the understanding are concepts, which relate to\nobjects mediately. The Marburgers\u2019 skepticism of these\ndistinctions culminated in Cohen\u2019s Logic of Pure\nKnowledge (1902: \u00a77), where these dualisms are definitively\nrejected. As Natorp put the point: \n\n\nIn the end, \u201cintuition\u201d no longer remains a cognitive\nfactor which stands across from or is opposed to thinking. It is\nthinking, just not thinking in terms of laws, but thinking in terms of\nfull objects. In its implementation, in its exercise, intuition is to\nconceptual thought as function is to the law of function. (1912a: 186)\n\n\n\nIntuition is itself a \u201cfunction\u201d, because even intuitions\nare active or spontaneous, and not merely given. Similarly, they were\noften uncomfortable with Kant\u2019s word \u201csynthesis\u201d\nbecause it suggests that the function of thinking is only to combine a\ncontent that is already given. Instead, Cohen prefers the term\n\u201cgenerate\u201d in order to indicate the \u201ccreative\nsovereignty of thinking\u201d (1902: 25). In another favorite slogan,\nan object is not given [geben] to knowledge, but given as a\ntask [aufgegeben], echoing the genetic view of knowledge\ndescribed in the previous paragraph (Natorp 1912a: 183\u20134; Natorp\n1910: Ch.1, \u00a75). In Substance and Function (1910: Ch.1),\nCassirer attacks the given by attacking a related doctrine: the\ntraditional view that all concepts are formed by abstraction. On this\nview of concept formation, concepts would have to be abstracted from\ngiven material that is completely independent of thought and its\nconcepts\u2014thus presupposing the doctrine of the given.\n\nIt is hard to interpret the Marburg rejection of the given. It seems\nto deny the obvious fact that there is some passive element in\nperception, and to leave no room for experiment within natural science\n(as Natorp recognized: 1912a: 186). In interpreting the doctrine, it\nis helpful to remember that the Marburg theory of knowledge concerns\nrelations among the content of knowledge\u2014how one part of the\ncontent of knowledge justifies another. It is not concerned with\ncausal relations between acts of the mind in perception. Plausibly,\nthe only content that could justify a thought must itself be something\nthinkable, since \u201cknowledge is only grounded through other\nknowledge\u201d (Natorp 1887: 168). (In this sense, the denial of the\ngiven is a denial of content that is not conceptual or dependent on\nwhat is conceptual.) In Cassirer\u2019s polemic against the given, he\nattacks the \u201cepistemological atomism\u201d implicit in it: the\nview that there are some contents that can be efficacious for\nknowledge without requiring that a knower possess any concepts or know\nany facts. (In this sense, the denial of the given is a defense of\nsemantic holism.) For this reason, he argues against the given by\narguing that even the most basic\nexperiments\u2014measurements\u2014depend on the experimenter\npossessing concepts and knowing certain theoretical facts (see\n section 2.3\n below).\n\nThe Marburg philosophers characterize their philosophy as a kind of\n\u201cidealism\u201d. This idealism should be sharply distinguished\nfrom \u201csubjectivism\u201d, since they do not believe that\nobjects of knowledge are representations\u2014they do not believe\nthat the objects of knowledge depend for their existence on the\nexistence of minds to think them (Cassirer 1910: 298). This idealism\nis also opposed to the view that our knowledge is really illusory;\nthey do not hold that there are unknowable objects, or that the real\nnature of objects of knowledge is in principle unknowable (Cohen 1902:\n507ff). Rather, their position is idealist in four senses. First, they\ndefend an \u201cidealist\u201d conception of philosophy, as\nfollowing the transcendental method. In this sense, idealism is\nopposed to \u201cnaturalism\u201d, the view that the method of\nphilosophy does not differ in kind from that of the natural sciences.\nSecond, they hold that there are substantive a priori principles that\nmake experience possible. In this sense, their idealism is opposed to\nempiricism. Third, according to their theory of objective validity,\nour conception of an object depends on our conception of objectivity,\nwhich is grounded in the idea of the unity of knowledge according to\nlaws. In this sense of idealism, idealism is opposed to\n\u201crealism\u201d, which takes the concept of an object as a\nphilosophical primitive. Fourth, according to their philosophy of\nscience (see below\n section 2.3),\n our empirical theories make essential use of fundamental concepts\n(such as mathematical concepts, or \u201ctheoretical concepts\u201d,\nsuch as the concept <force> or <energy>) that are\nradically unlike the features that the world appears to have to\nuntutored, everyday experience. These \u201cideal\u201d concepts are\nnot reducible to \u201csensible\u201d concepts such as color,\ntexture, or shape. In this sense, idealism is opposed to\n\u201csensualism\u201d.\n\nThe Marburg conception of philosophy, as guided by the transcendental\nmethod, along with their rejection of the given, leads them to a\nunique conception of logic. For further discussion, see the\nSupplement,\n Philosophy of Logic in the Marburg School.\n\nThe Marburg rejection of the given, along with their view that\nobjectivity is conferred by laws, has significant consequences for\ntheir philosophy of psychology. For further information, see the\nSupplement,\n Philosophy of Psychology in the Marburg School.\n2.3 Philosophy of Natural Science\n\nThe Marburg philosophers wrote several works that engaged in a\ndetailed way with the natural science, especially physics, of their\nday. In his Forward and Introduction to the sixth edition of\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism, first published in\n1898, Cohen gives a philosophical interpretation of work on\nelectromagnetism since Faraday, and defends Hertz\u2019s\nPrinciples of Mechanics (Hertz 1894). In two works both\npublished in 1910 (Natorp 1910: Ch.7; Cassirer 1910: Ch.4) Natorp and\nCassirer discuss foundational issues in physics: the principles of\nmechanics and thermodynamics; the nature of mass, energy, space, and\ntime; atomism and its critics. (Cassirer also addresses foundational\nissues in chemistry: 1910: Ch.4, section 8). The culmination of this\nwork is Cassirer\u2019s Einstein\u2019s Theory of\nRelativity, published in 1921.\n\nThere are three themes that run through Marburg work in the philosophy\nof natural science: they argue that contemporary natural science\nsupports philosophical idealism; they highlight radical conceptual\nchanges in physics; and they philosophically interpret physics in the\nlight of their conception of objective validity. Each of\nthese themes is discussed in the rest of the section.\nIdealism in Natural Science\n\nOne of Cohen\u2019s chief goals in Cohen 1898 is to show that recent\nwork in electromagnetism undermines \u201csensualism\u201d or\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d, and supports \u201cidealism\u201d, by\ntransforming our conception of physical reality away from the\n\u201csensible\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d to the\n\u201cideal\u201d. The physical world, according to the\n\u201csensible\u201d conception of reality\u2014the way the world\nappears to us to be through our senses\u2014is composed of matter,\nconceived on the model of the roughly medium sized dry goods that our\nsenses reveal to us. Physicists working in\nelectromagnetism\u2014Cohen points to Faraday\nespecially\u2014demonstrated the physical reality of electromagnetic\nfields. Following Faraday, Cohen applauds efforts to treat\nelectromagnetic fields and forces as independent entities in their own\nright, not dependent on a \u201cmaterial\u201d ether. Pure field\ntheories thus vindicate idealism, by showing that our conception of\nthe objects of physics should not be constrained by the picture of the\nworld supplied by our senses; our conception of the world can only be\nsupplied by thought, and not by the senses.\n\nGiven Cohen\u2019s opposition to ether theories, it is not surprising\nthat he feels vindicated by Einstein\u2019s special theory of\nrelativity (Cohen 1898: 134; the passage appears in 1914\u20135\nedition). In fact, Cassirer claims (1921: Ch.4) that Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral theory, which departs further from the \u201csensible\u201d\nconception of matter by not separating matter from space and time, is\na natural continuation of the idealism Cohen first articulated. \nRadical Conceptual Change in Natural Science\n\nAccording to the Marburg transcendental method\n (section 2.1),\n the \u201cfact\u201d of science is not static, but dynamic. In\nadvocating this method, the Marburg Neo-Kantians are thus claiming\nthat the principles that are a priori for science will evolve as\ntheories change, and the concepts that function as categories will be\nradically reconceived as science progresses. There is then a new task,\nto identify the principles that are a priori in a given physical\ntheory, and to investigate how the categories\u2014space, time,\nsubstance, magnitude\u2014are being reconceived in our current best\nphysical theories. The Marburgers are thus committed to a view of\nscientific progress that emphasizes conceptual shifts in science.\nScientists don\u2019t just discover new facts: they also develop new\nconcepts, and radically revise their fundamental concepts.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Marburg conception of objectivity and\nobjecthood, objecthood\u2014what it is to be an object\u2014is\nconceptually dependent on objectivity, which is explained in terms of\nlaws. The upshot of this is that our notion of a physical object is\ndetermined by the most fundamental laws of our science. Marburg\nNeo-Kantianism therefore highlights the fact that scientific progress\nrequires fundamental shifts in science\u2019s ontology\u2014its\nconception of what there is.\n\nThese themes are apparent already in Cohen\u2019s introduction to\nLange (Cohen 1898). Following Hertz, Cohen surveys three different\nproposals for the principles of mechanics: Newton\u2019s view (which\ntakes as fundamental space, time, mass, and force); an alternative\nthat replaces the notion of force with energy; and Hertz\u2019s own\nradical view, which uses only the notions of space, time, and mass.\nCohen argues for Hertz\u2019s view, emphasizing how it fundamentally\nreconceptualizes the traditional notion of \u201cmass\u201d (Cohen\n1898: 128ff.). This same tendency is even more apparent in\nCassirer\u2019s writings on Einstein. He argues that Einstein\nintroduces new a priori principles: the constancy of the speed of\nlight (in the special theory), and the principles of general\ncovariance and the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass (in\nthe general theory) (1921: 415, 428). And he emphasizes the\ntransformations in the notions of substance, space, and time that the\ngeneral theory requires (1921: Chs.\n 3\u20135).[13]\nObjective Validity of Natural Science\n\nFor Marburg Neo-Kantianism, objectivity and objecthood are explained\nin terms of the unity of knowledge. Explaining the unity of scientific\nknowledge over time becomes especially pressing for them given their\nemphasis on radical conceptual change in natural science. If even the\ncategories are shifting over time, in what sense is there unity to our\nknowledge?\n\nThis problem is made more pressing in conjunction with the Marburg\nattack on the given. (After all, if there were something given in\nexperience, then the given in experience would determine which\nconceptual changes are necessary in science, and the objectivity of\nour scientific knowledge could be explained.) In the philosophy of\nscience, the attack on the given amounts to an attack on the\npossibility of crucial experiments\u2014experiments that would, in a\ntheory neutral way, establish the truth of a scientific theory.\nMarburg philosophers emphasized that even the most primitive\nexperimental results\u2014measurements\u2014presuppose a good amount\nof \u201ctheoretical\u201d machinery: not only mathematics, but even\nphysical laws. Cassirer cited Duhem in support (1910: Ch.4). Duhemian\nunderdetermination of scientific theory by experience showed, Cassirer\nbelieved, that there is no given: no autonomous layer of\nself-authenticating experiences.\n\nMarburg philosophy of science thus includes the claim that there could\nbe rival scientific theories, each of which is empirically\n adequate.[14]\n Given this, in what sense is science objective? How is there unity in\nscience, when there are no theory-neutral experiments that would\nprevent different scientists from adopting different theories?\nCassirer (1910) in particular proposed an intricate answer to this\nquestion (Heis 2014). He argued that there is a common set of demands\non theories that will constrain the choice of theory. These demands\nare a priori, in a regulative sense, and partially constitute what he\ncalls the \u201cform\u201d of a scientific theory. These demands\ninclude that a theory be simple and of wide\n scope.[15]\n He also argues that even in the face of radical conceptual changes\nand shifts in ontology, some features of scientific theories are\nmaintained\u2014for instance the approximate mathematical structure\nof the theory.\n\nFor further discussion of the philosophy of mathematics, see the\nSupplement,\n Philosophy of Mathematics in the Marburg School.\n3. The Southwest School\n\nThe beginning of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism can arguably\nbe located in Wilhelm Windelband\u2019s 1883 essay, \u201cCritical\nor Genetic Method?\u201d, which for the first time both gives a clear\nexposition of the philosophical point of view that would characterize\nthe Southwest school and argues explicitly for a return to Kant.\nHowever, many of the core ideas in that essay were already articulated\nby Windelband\u2019s teacher, Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881),\nprincipally in his Logic (1874). Lotze argued for a clean\ndistinction between philosophy and psychology. Logic depends on the\ndistinction between \u201ctruth and untruth\u201d, and gives the\nlaws that thought ought to obey, while psychology identifies\nthe laws that mental processes do obey. Logic gives laws\ngoverning the content of thoughts, while psychology concerns\nacts of thinking (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x; \u00a7332; on the\nact/content distinction see also Lotze 1856\u201364: vol.2, 630;\nLotze 1874: \u00a7337). The contents of thoughts are objective,\ninasmuch as they are not only shareable but have a reality independent\nof being thought. Though these contents are real, they do not occur\n(as events do), do not exist or have being (as things do), but are\nvalid (1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318). Though Lotze did not\nexplicitly call for a return to Kant, he did articulate many of the\nthemes that the SW Neo-Kantians located in Kant. Lotze argued that\nknowing cannot be considered a copying [Abbilden] of\nits object (\u00a7327); he held that knowledge requires a priori\nelements, and that apriority is not the same as innateness\n(\u00a7324); and more generally he positioned his philosophy as a\nmiddle ground between speculative idealism and materialism.\n\nAfter completing his dissertation, on the doctrine of chance, under\nLotze in 1870, Windelband (1848\u20131915), moved to Strassburg in\n1882, and then to Heidelberg in 1902. A master essayist, he is best\nknown for the essays and addresses collected in his\nPr\u00e4ludien (1915), which was first published in 1883. In\n\u201cCritical or Genetic Method?\u201d\u2014the important essay\njust mentioned\u2014Windelband self-consciously looks to Kant and the\ncritical philosophy as the key to clearly distinguishing philosophy\nfrom psychology. Picking up Lotze\u2019s key notion of validity, he\nargues that Kant\u2019s project is best understood as a study of\nvalidity: the topic of philosophy is value, or the \u201cvalidity of\naxioms\u201d or norms. This study of validity should be broadened to\nall areas of culture. This broadening of the critical project was\ncarried further in his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural\nScience\u201d (1894), which argued (against the positivist theory of\nhistory), that history provides a distinct way of knowing (which he\ncalls, \u201cidiographic\u201d), distinct from the natural\nscientific (\u201cnomothetic\u201d) way of knowing. Windelband was\nalso a prolific and original historian of philosophy, culminating in\n1891 with his history of philosophy from ancient to modern times\n(Windelband 1891). He articulated and defended a conception of doing\nhistory of philosophy (Problemgeschichte, history of\nphilosophical problems) that became standard for the Neo-Kantians of\nboth schools.\n\nThese programmatic ideas in the theory of knowledge and the philosophy\nof history were expanded systematically by Windelband\u2019s student\nHeinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936). After writing his dissertation\n(\u201cThe Theory of Definition\u201d) under Windelband in\nStrassburg in 1888, Rickert moved to Freiburg in 1889. The\nphilosophical school became known as the Southwest or Baden school,\nbecause Freiburg and Heidelberg are both in Baden in southwest\nGermany. In 1892, he published The Object of Knowledge\n(Rickert 1915), which he expanded and modified in subsequent editions\nover the next thirty years. His most influential book, The Limits\nof Concept Formation in Natural Science (1st ed: 1902) greatly\nexpands and systematically develops the core idea in\nWindelband\u2019s essay \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d.\nHis book Das Eine, die Einheit und die Eins (Oneness,\nUnity, and the Number One, 1911), was one of the few SW works in\nthe philosophy of mathematics.\n\nAmong the students of Rickert and Windelband who aligned themselves\nwith their philosophical point of view, the most influential and\nphilosophically sophisticated was Emil Lask\n (1875\u20131915).[16]\n After studying under Windelband in Heidelberg and Rickert in\nFrieburg, Lask wrote his dissertation under Rickert in 1902\n(\u201cFichte\u2019s Idealism and History\u201d). He later habilitated at\nHeidelberg, where Windelband was located, and eventually became a\nprofessor there. While there, he wrote two dense works, The Logic\nof Philosophy and the Doctrine of the Categories (1911), and\nThe Doctrine of Judgment (1912). Tragically, he died in 1915\nin the Great War.\n3.1 Conception of Philosophy: Philosophy as Theory of Value\n\n\u201cKant posed a new conception of philosophy\u2019s task and mode\nof knowledge against the psychologism of his contemporaries\u201d,\nWindelband writes in his programmatic essay, \u201cCritical or\nGenetic Method?\u201d (Windelband 1883: 271). On this Kantian view,\nWindelband asserts, philosophy\u2019s subject matter is the\n\u201cvalidity\u201d [Geltung] of \u201caxioms\u201d.\nPhilosophy must identify these axioms, put them into a system, and\nexplain how these axioms govern the activities of knowing, acting, and\njudging. This latter task requires giving a general account of\nvalidity, in addition to identifying how the various sciences and\nareas of culture are governed by specific axioms. Logic (or\ntheoretical philosophy, or \u201ctheory of knowledge\u201d) is the\nscience of the axioms for knowing; ethics is the science of the norms\nfor acting; aesthetics is\nthe science of the rules of the \u201ceffects of the emotions\u201d\n(1883: 274\u20135). \n\nThis conception of philosophy furnishes the SW School with an antidote\nto psychologism, which differs fundamentally from the kind of\nanti-psychologism proferred by the Marburg school (see\n section 2.1).\n For Windelband, axioms are understood \u201cteleologically\u201d:\nthey are the rules that must be followed if certain ends are to be\nrealized. For instance, logic gives those norms that must be followed\nif one wants to believe what is true. Axioms are norms, and\ntheir necessity is normative necessity. Essentially,\nphilosophy is distinct from psychology because norms are distinct from\nfacts. The norms that, as a matter of fact, people do recognize have\nonly \u201cfactual validity\u201d, and not \u201cteleological\n validity\u201d.[17]\n What Windelband calls the \u201cgenetic method\u201d recognizes\nonly factual validity or generality. It seeks to demonstrate the\nvalidity of axioms by showing that these axioms are built into our\npsychology, or are universal to all cultures. The genetic method\ntherefore makes philosophy dependent on psychology and cultural\nhistory. But the genetic method is hopeless: one cannot prove the\naxioms that govern all sciences by using psychology or anthropology,\nsince these sciences themselves presuppose these axioms. Indeed, the\ngenetic method threatens relativism, since we cannot say what humans\nwill believe at all times and places, but only what they believe now,\nor what is believed in this or that culture. Indeed, on the genetic\nmethod, truth and goodness are reduced to social power or majority\nopinion.\n\nThe critical method, on the other hand, begins with the assumption\nthat there are universal, absolute values which all subjects ought to\nrecognize and conform to. It postulates a \u201cnormal consciousness\nwhose principles must be recognized, insofar as anything at all is to\nhave universal validity\u201d (Windelband 1883: 280). This normal\n consciousness,[18]\n inasmuch as it embodies a norm, is not an empirically real subject\nand cannot be investigated using the genetic method. The\n\u201caxioms\u201d, which form the subject matter of philosophy, are\nthe principles that must have normative force if there is to be a\nnormal consciousness at all. These axioms are \u201cmeans to the end\nof universal validity\u201d (1883: 281)\u2014they are the norms that\nmust be recognized if there are to be any universally valid norms at\nall. For example, there could be a normal consciousness in a world\nwhere ripe tomatoes are blue and not red. Thus the norm \u201cBelieve\nthat ripe tomatoes are red\u201d, though it is true and thus\nuniversally valid in our world, is not an axiom\u2014not a norm whose\nrecognition is a precondition of universal validity. The law of\ncontradiction, on the other hand, is a precondition of universal\nvalidity. No matter what color ripe tomatoes are in our world, there\nwould be no point in adopting the norm \u201cBelieve that ripe\ntomatoes are red\u201d as a norm of truth, unless we also\nrecognize the demand to avoid contradictions. The proof that these\naxioms are the indispensable preconditions of universal validity\ncannot be empirical, as the genetic method would require.\n\nThe defining claim of SW Neo-Kantianism is that there are universally\nvalid norms, and every universally valid norm has an a priori\n ground.[19]\n The concept of the a priori is therefore not a psychological or\nbiological notion (the a priori is not the innate), nor is it an\nanthropological notion (the a priori is not what is universally\nassented to). The a priori are norms, the recognition of which is\nindispensable for normative activities. In theoretical philosophy, the\na priori are norms the recognition of which are necessary for making\nuniversally valid judgments\u2014judgments that make a claim to\ntruth, truth for every other cognizer. These a priori theoretical\nnorms include the laws of logic. For natural science, the law of\ncausality is an a priori norm; for history (see\n section 3.3),\n it is a priori that there are universal values that make certain\nindividuals historically significant (Rickert 1902: 334). Similarly,\nthere are universally binding norms in ethics and aesthetics, which\nmake it possible that certain actions and emotions are universally\nvalid.\n\nLask agrees with his teachers in characterizing philosophy as the\nscience of validity (Lask 1911: 401). He recognizes, however, that the\nSW Neo-Kantian insistence on the objectivity of what is valid, along\nwith their distinction between the factual and the normative,\nthreatens to devolve into a \u201ctwo world\u201d metaphysics that\nis potentially incompatible with Kantianism. In fact, Lotze (Lask\nargues) opted precisely for such a two world theory, where what is\nvalid is set over against what is, or has\nbeing. This dualism is unpalatable, since it would leave it\nunexplained how senses (i.e., the contents of our sentences) come to\nbe true of what is, thus reigniting the question (famously posed by\nKant in his 1772 letter to Herz) about how representations can relate\nto objects at all. Lask thus argued that Neo-Kantianism had to be\ncompleted by taking a Kantian \u201cCopernican\n Turn\u201d[20]\n (Lask 1911: First Part, \u00a71). Just as Kant argued that the object\nmust conform to our cognition of it, Lask holds that both the senses\nof our sentences and the objects that have being share a form\n(\u00a72). The form of a sense is theoretical validity\n[G\u00fcltigkeit], and the form of an object is objectivity\n[Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit]. The Copernican view, then, is that\ntheoretical validity just is objectivity. The two world theory thus\nbecomes a two element theory (\u00a73). There is one realm (the realm\nof theoretical sense or being), within which we can distinguish a\nformal element and a material element. The formal element is validity,\nwhich is the subject matter of philosophy, while the material element\nis sensible. Validity, however, is not supersensible (such as the\nobjects of dogmatic theology or cosmology would be), but rather\n\u201cnon-sensible\u201d, since it is an element in the sensible\nobjects of our experience.\n\nLast, it should be emphasized that for Windelband and the rest of the\nSW Neo-Kantians, the goal of the critical philosophy is to be an\n\u201call-encompassing philosophy of culture\u201d (Windelband\n1910). In particular, they wanted to expand Kant\u2019s critical\nproject to those areas of culture that Kant\u2019s original draft of\ncritical philosophy had neglected: the so-called\n\u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d, principally history.\n3.2 Theory of Knowledge\n\nThere are four fundamental features of the SW Neo-Kantians\u2019\ntheory of knowledge: a normative theory of objectivity and objecthood;\nthe act/content/object distinction; the rejection of the copy theory\nof knowledge; and a theory of what is given in perceptual experience.\nThis section addresses each of these features in turn.\nObjectivity and Objecthood\n\nThe central question that Rickert poses in his The Object of\nKnowledge, which is the most developed and thorough SW work in\nthe theory of knowledge, is \u201cWhat is the object of knowledge,\nwhich is independent of the subject, or in virtue of what does\ncognizing achieve objectivity?\u201d (Rickert 1915: 1). In\nparticular, Rickert is concerned with the \u201ctranscendence\u201d\nof the object: that the object is an independent standard for\nknowledge, that it determines whether knowledge is true or objective.\nRickert\u2019s answer to these questions is that the object is a\n\u201ctranscendent ought\u201d [Sollen], and not\nfundamentally a \u201ctranscendent being\u201d [Sein] or\n\u201creality\u201d [Wirklichkeit]. This is a distinctive\nview. It is, of course, a platitude that objects are normative in the\nsense that our beliefs about an object ought to be true of it. But a\ncommon view is that this normativity is derivative: our beliefs about\nan object ought to be a certain way, because the object\nitself is a certain way. On this common view, the\nobject\u2019s standing as a \u201ctranscendent ought\u201d is\ngrounded in its \u201ctranscendent being\u201d. Rickert rejects this\nview. He argues that the only norms that can be derived from what is\n[sein], are conditional norms, to the effect that one ought\nto do such and such if one happens to will a certain thing\u2014norms\nthat are neither objective, nor independent of the subject. Such a\nview either undermines the theory of knowledge as a normative\ndiscipline (and truth as a value), or undermines objectivity (Rickert\n1915: 281). Rickert therefore advocates upending the common view. He\ntakes norms of cognition as basic and irreducible, and argues that the\ntranscendent reality of objects is grounded in these irreducible\ncognitive norms.\n\nIn Lask 1911 and Lask 1912, Lask follows his teacher in talking of the\nobject as \u201ccontaining a value\u201d or being the standard for\nknowledge. Drawing on Rickert\u2019s ideas, he argues that the\nobjectivity (of an object) is just the same thing as validity (of\nvalues), and that both objects and senses share this form.\nNevertheless, Lask departs from Rickert\u2019s view in two ways.\nFirst, he argues that \n\n\nas we must fight every version of truth that is characterized by\nmirroring and shadowing, so also conversely, we must fight any\nassertion of a dependence in the opposite direction, a priority of\ntheoretical validity, of the \u201cdemand\u201d, of the\n\u201cought\u201d before being. (Lask 1911: 410) \n\n\nThe transcendent being of an object is no more derivative from the\nnormativity of our claims about that object than the latter is on the\nformer (Lask 1908). Second, Lask argues that the object has a form and\na matter, and that the form alone is what is valid. Thus the object is\nnot itself a transcendent ought, but only its form\n is.[21]\nAct, Content, and Object of Thinking\n\nLotze had distinguished psychology from the theory of knowledge (what\nLotze calls \u201clogic\u201d) by distinguishing the acts of\nthinking, which are events and constitute the subject matter of\npsychology, from the contents of thinking, which are valid and\nconstitute the subject matter of logic (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x;\n\u00a7332). This distinction was taken up and ramified by Rickert and\nLask. Starting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of\nKnowledge, Rickert argued that the content [Gehalt] of a\njudgment had to be split up into two parts: the unreal\n[unwirklich], objective content [Gehalt], and the\nsubjective, \u201cimmanent sense\u201d [Urteilssinn] of the\njudgment. This immanent sense is distinct from the act of judging,\nwhich is \u201creal\u201d and the subject matter of psychology.\nRickert calls the immanent sense \u201cirreal\u201d\n[irreal]. The immanent sense is the orienting of the subject\ntoward the objective content (Rickert 1915: 164\u2013167; Ch.3,\n\u00a74). What Rickert means by this can be brought out by contrasting\nit with the objective content, which Rickert takes to be a whole\ncomposed of connected representations. For example, the three\nsentences \u201cIs snow white?\u201d, \u201cSnow is white\u201d,\nand \u201cSnow is not white\u201d, for Rickert all have the same\nobjective content, since in all three the same representation\n(\u201cwhite\u201d) is predicated categorically of the same\nrepresentation (\u201csnow\u201d). The difference is in the\n\u201cimmanent sense\u201d of the sentences: the first sentence\nquestions whether the content is true, the second\naffirms that the content is true, and the third\ndenies that the content is true (Rickert 1915: 175; Ch.3,\n\u00a76). Rickert\u2019s distinction between immanent sense and\nobjective content fits more naturally than does the simple act/content\ndistinction with the SW conception of philosophy as the theory of\nvalues, and thus with their conception of the theory of knowledge as\nconcerned with the norm of truth. After all, if theory of\nknowledge is concerned only with abstract, objective contents, then it\nis not clear why it would be any more normative than natural science.\nA science that isolates the laws of abstract things would seem just as\ndescriptive as a science that isolates the laws of concrete\nthings\u2014as Husserl argued forcefully in Logical\nInvestigations (Husserl 1900). Norms seem more suited for acts,\nnot objective contents. But to swing in the opposite direction, and\ntake theory of knowledge to concern acts of cognition wouldn\u2019t\nhelp either, since the laws that govern the acts are just descriptive\nlaws that predict what a psychophysical subject will think under\ncertain circumstances. The theory of knowledge, however, can be\nnormative if it concerns the element intermediate between acts and\nobjective contents: it gives the norms for immanent senses, stances\ntaken toward objective contents.\n\nA different kind of refinement of the act/content/object distinction\nappears in Lask\u2019s 1912 Die Lehre vom Urteil (The\nDoctrine of\n Judgment).[22]\n Lask wants a theory of judgment that recognizes that the object is\nthe standard of truth; and that truth does not depend on the act of\njudging\u2014just as anti-psychologism demands. Lask believes that\nthe standard distinctions between act, content, and object do not\nfully recognize this. In particular, he rejects Rickert\u2019s view\nthat, in judging, a subject takes a stance with respect to the\nobjective content. This is because Lask believes that the objective\ncontent is created by the act of judging, and so Rickert\u2019s view\nhas the unpalatable consequence that our acts of judging are about\nsomething that is created by our acts of judgment, thus violating the\nidea that our judgments answer to something prior to the act of\njudging. On the other hand, he cannot say that in judging, we judge\nthe object itself, since all judgments have a structure (one thing is\npredicated of another), and the object, he argues, is an unstructured\nwhole whose articulation into parts is a work of the mind. Lask\ntherefore posits, in addition to the content of the judgment and the\nobject itself, a third thing, which he calls the \u201cprimary\nobject\u201d (Lask 1912: Ch.1). The primary object is a structured\nwhole, which (as structured) is distinct from the object itself, but\n(as structured in a way that differs from the logical structures\npossessed by judgments) is distinct from the content of the judgment,\nas well. Judging is then a decision about whether the predication in\nthe primary object is valid, and the content is the thought that the\nprimary object is valid. The judgment thus aims to successfully\n\u201creproduce\u201d or \u201crebuild\u201d [nachbilden]\nin a structured form the originally unstructured object (Lask 1912:\nCh.2, \u00a71), and truth, as the adequate rebuilding of the object,\nbecomes a kind of correspondence (Ch.2,\n \u00a72).[23]\nRejection of the Copy Theory of Knowledge\n\nAnother idea, present in Lotze, though ultimately derived from Kant,\nis the rejection of the copy theory [Abbildtheorie] of\nknowledge. \u201cSince the Critique of Pure Reason\u201d, Windelband\nwrites, \n\n\nthe days are over once and for all when a mature philosophical\nconsciousness might think of the world as \u201cgiven\u201d and\nmirrored in it, as it would seem to the naive consciousness. In\neverything we regard as given our reason is already at work: and the\njustification of our knowledge of things rests only on our first\ncreating them for ourselves. (1910 [NKR: 318]) \n\n\nNo knowledge, not even perceptual knowledge, is merely receptive, or a\nmirror, but is a product that results from the application of a priori\nforms to what is given. The explicit attack on the copy theory becomes\nmore explicit in Windelband and Rickert\u2019s writings over time:\nstarting in the 1915 third edition of The Object of\nKnowledge, Rickert devotes a section (Chapter 2, section VI)\nexplicitly to attacking the copy theory, and he devotes a late essay\n(Rickert 1934) to what he sees as a revival of the errors of the copy\ntheory in Heidegger. In the latter essay, Rickert attacks\n\u201ctheoretical intuitionism\u201d, the idea that cognition\n[Erkenntnis] is no more than intuition [Anschauung],\na passive reception of the object that is given to us. Such a view\nimplies that cognition is simply a copy of the object, which resembles\nit. However, he argues that intuition, the passive reception of what\nis given, merely gives \u201ckennen\u201d (acquaintance\nwith), and not true \u201cerkennen\u201d (cognizing).\nCognition requires a \u201ccomplete transformation of the given\nintuition through non-intuitive factors\u201d (1934 [NKR: 391]).\nThe Given\n\nThough the SW and Marburg school agree in their rejection of the copy\ntheory, they take very different attitudes toward the distinction\nbetween intuitions and concepts, and toward the \u201cgiven\u201d.\nFor the Marburg school, there is nothing given; the SW School argues\nonly that knowledge is not a copy of the given, but requires a\ntransformation of it. For the Marburg school, there is no distinction\nbetween intuitions and concepts; for the SW School, intuitions are\nirreducible to concepts. These two points are developed by Rickert. He\nholds that the content of a sensory consciousness, what is given in\nperception, is a \u201cheterogeneous continuum\u201d and an\n\u201cunsurveyable manifold\u201d (1915: 406\u20137; Ch.5, \u00a75,\n\u201cKonstitutive Wirklichkeitsformen und Methodologische\nErkenntnisformen\u201d). This multiplicity of content in\nperception can only be felt [Erlebnis, Gef\u00fchl], since it\nwould be an infinite (and so impossible) task to express this content\nin conceptual form (1915: 139; Ch.3, section 1, \u201cDas\nErkennen als Vorstellen\u201d). So cognition cannot be a\nreproduction, or mirror, of what is given; the concept cannot be a\nreproduction of the intuition. Rather, concepts are always general,\nand overcome the multiplicity of the content of sensory consciousness\nby leaving out content that is present in intuition (Rickert 1902:\nCh.1, \u00a71). This idea is further developed by Lask (1911). He\nargues that a theoretical sense (e.g., the sense of this or that\nsentence) is composed of matter and form, that the form of the sense\nis validity, while the matter is the \u201cnon-valid sensible\u201d,\nor \u201calogical content\u201d. This material matter, though it can\nbe taken up into a concept as its matter, is not itself conceptual, or\nreducible or transformable into what is conceptual. The sensible\ncontent (i.e., the content of a sensory consciousness) is\n\u201csomething irrational\u201d or \u201cforeign to\nmeaning\u201d, and can only be passively taken in, felt, and intuited\n(Lask 1911: 415\u2013417; First Part, \u00a73). The sense of a\nsentence does not mirror or copy the sensory given: the sensory given\nis its matter. Lask summarizes the difference between the Marburg view\nand this conception as a distinction between \u201cpanlogicism\u201d\n(the view that all content is conceptual content\u2014the kind of\ncontent that is the subject matter of logic) and \u201cpanarchy of\nlogos\u201d (his view that all content, even sensory content, can be\nthe matter for conceptual form, without being reduced to it) (Lask\n1911: 426; Second Part, Ch.1, \u00a73). \n3.3 Philosophy of Historical Sciences\n\nWindelband\u2019s most influential and widely-read work, and indeed,\nthe most influential and widely-read of all of the SW Neo-Kantian\nwritings, is his essay, \u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d.\nThis essay is a contribution to the philosophical debate sparked by\nthe 19th century explosion in what we might call the human\nsciences\u2014principally history, but also comparative linguistics,\nanthropology, and comparative religion\u2014that seemed rigorous and\nso \u201cscientific\u201d, but that seemed to differ fundamentally\nfrom paradigm mathematical natural sciences such as\n physics.[24]\n Windelband\u2019s chief claim is that there is an irreducible\nmethodological difference (or, as he puts it, a \u201clogical\u201d\ndifference) between history and the natural sciences.\n\n\n[W]e have before us a purely methodological classification of the\nempirical sciences that is grounded upon sound logical concepts. The\nprinciple of classification is the formal property of the theoretical\nor cognitive objectives of the science in question. One kind of\nscience is an inquiry into general laws. The other kind of science is\nan inquiry into specific historical facts. In the language of formal\nlogic, the objective of the first kind of science is the general,\napodictic judgment; the objective of the other kind of science is the\nsingular, assertoric proposition. (Windelband 1894: 291)\n\n\nThose sciences, such as mathematical physics, whose goal is to produce\ngeneral laws are called \u201cnomothetic\u201d; those sciences, such\nas history, whose goal is to know a unique, singular individual, are\ncalled \u201cidiographic\u201d. The individual that is the subject\nof idiographic sciences need not be an individual human being, such as\nCaesar. It could be a unique event or sequence of events (the fall of\nthe Roman empire); an individual nation, language, religion, or\nculture (Florence during the Renaissance); or a unique artifact of\nliterature, art, or science (Homer\u2019s Iliad). The\nimportant point is that an idiographic science has as its goal to\nunderstand an individual in all its\n uniqueness.[25]\n Nomothetic sciences want to know laws; idiographic sciences want to\nknow unique processes. The nomothetic seeks the general, and what\nhappens invariably; the idiographic seeks the particular, and what\nonly happens once. Nomothetic sciences begin with what is given to\nintuition [Anschauung], but ascend to what is abstract and no\nlonger intuitive; idiographic sciences proceed in the opposite\ndirection, attempting to resurrect and reproduce a unique individual\nin all its vitality, detail, and intuitiveness\n[Anschaulichkeit].\n\nWindelband\u2019s chief target is the positivist philosophy of\nhistory, defended by Comte, Mill, and others. On this view, the method\nof history ought to be fundamentally the same as that of the natural\nsciences, and its goal ought to be the discovery of general laws that\nexplain and predict historical\n events.[26]\n A secondary target of this essay is the view that history and the\nnatural sciences can be distinguished principally in terms of their\nsubject matter. This view is expressed by the terms\n\u201cNaturwissenschaften\u201d (sciences of nature) and\n\u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d (sciences of\n\u201cmind\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), which Dilthey introduced\nin his 1883 book Introduction to the Geisteswissenschaften.\nWindelband objects that when the distinction among the sciences is\ndrawn in this way, psychology ends up as a\nGeisteswissenschaft like history; indeed psychology, as the\nempirical science of the mind, ought to be the fundamental\nGeisteswissenschaft on which all other\nGeisteswissenschaften depend. But, Windelband argues,\npsychology is methodologically just as much a \u201cnomothetic\u201d\nscience as physics is: both try to discover mathematical laws of their\nphenomena through controlled\n experimentation.[27]\n And the amount of psychology that a historian needs does not go\nbeyond what is supplied by reflective common sense; the new\ndiscoveries of empirical psychologists have been, and are likely to\nbe, of no special significance for\n historians.[28]\n\nThe conception of history first sketched in Windelband\u2019s\n\u201cHistory and Natural Science\u201d was thoroughly elaborated\nand expanded in Rickert\u2019s The Limits of Concept Formation in\nNatural Science. Rickert improves on Windelband\u2019s view in\ntwo principal ways: he systematically develops Windelband\u2019s idea\nthat the distinction between history and natural science must be\ngrounded in logic, and he connects the distinction in kinds\nof sciences to the characteristic SW distinction between fact and\nvalue.\n\nAs Rickert\u2019s title emphasizes, he conceived of history as a\nlogical notion, as a certain way of forming concepts. The traditional\nlogic, he claims, considers only concepts formed by abstracting away\nfrom individual particularities to form general representations. But\nthis method has its limit: it cannot explain how we form concepts of\nindividuals. History is a logical procedure for forming\nconcepts of individuals, as, for instance, a historical work on Caesar\nwould produce a concept of Caesar. In calling the products of\nhistorical research \u201cconcepts\u201d, Rickert is combating the\nview that a historian merely collects facts and reports them. Rather,\nthe historian sifts through the potentially infinite number of facts\nabout her subject and isolates, using some principle of selection, the\nfacts about her subject that are essential for\n history.[29]\n Though Rickert employs the traditional logical notion of an\nindividual to characterize the subject of historical concepts, he uses\nthe term in a distinctive way. Individuals are unique and\nthey are indivisible or irreplaceable. An adequate\nhistorical concept of Julius Caesar needs to include those features\nthat make him unique, and unlike any other individual. Rickert uses\nthe example of the Koh-i-noor diamond to illustrate the indivisibility\nor irreplaceability of an historical individual. Of course there are\ndistinctive facts about this diamond that distinguish it from all\nother hunks of carbon; but the same could be said of any lump of coal.\nHowever, from the point of view of history, it is indifferent whether\none lump of coal that was used to power a locomotive carrying Queen\nVictoria would have been destroyed and replaced by some other lump of\ncoal. But, from the point of view of history, the massive diamond that\nthe Queen herself was wearing is hardly replaceable. Furthermore,\nRickert insisted that historical concepts, although they are of an\nindividual, are nonetheless general in the sense that the\nprinciples of selection employed in forming these concepts are\nuniversally valid for all\n historians.[30]\n\nWhen Rickert insists that concepts of historical individuals are\nformed through employing principles of selection that are universally\nvalid, he is bringing into the philosophy of history the\ncharacteristic SW distinction between fact and value. The principles\nof selection are given by values. The Koh-i-noor diamond is a\nhistorical individual because it is widely held to be uniquely\nbeautiful, and it forms a central part of the crown jewels of the\nBritish monarch; it is thus related, say, to the values of beauty,\nsocial order, and national\n identity.[31]\n Rickert therefore concludes that \u201cthe claim that historical\nconcepts have an unconditionally general validity presupposes the\nacknowledgment of unconditionally general values\u201d (Rickert 1902:\n360). The SW view of history thus attempts to thread the needle\nbetween positivism and more radical forms of historicism: it makes\nhistory an autonomous science, without falling into relativism.\n(Clearly, in arguing that the concepts of history are objectively\nvalid, despite the fact that history does not include universal laws,\nthe SW Neo-Kantians are rejecting the Marburg view that objective\nvalidity depends on laws. This is a paradigm case where their\ndiffering conceptions of objective validity, as normative or\nnomological, are brought to bear.) Indeed, Rickert claims that there\nare certain a priori conditions of history, just as Kant had claimed\nin the first Critique that there are certain a priori\nconditions for natural science. It is a priori that every historical\nindividual is value-relevant. It is also a priori that there are\ncertain values, such as beauty or social order, that are universally\nvalid. Inasmuch as a culture is a collection of values, or\nvalue-relevant individuals, the most apt way of characterizing the\nsubject matter of a science like history is as a science of\nculture, as opposed to a science of mind\n (Geisteswissenschaft).[32]\n",
