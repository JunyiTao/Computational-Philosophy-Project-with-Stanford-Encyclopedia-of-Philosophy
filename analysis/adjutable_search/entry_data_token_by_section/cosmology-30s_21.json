On this\nparticular Saturday in June, Nature published a fifteen-page\nspecial supplement as No. 3528. Contained within were contributions\nfrom sixteen \u201crepresentative investigators\u201d, as the editor\nreferred to them, each responding to \u201cModern\nAristotelianism\u201d Nature\u2019s Editor, R.A. Gregory,\nintroduces the occasion by noting that \u201cin Nature of\nMay 8, we published an article by Dr. Herbert Dingle entitled\n\u2018Modern Aristotelianism\u2019\u201d. Because the article, as\nGregory goes on to say, \u201ccreated considerable interest\u201d,\nNature \u201cdecided to invite further contributions on the\nsubject from a number of representative investigators.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreated considerable interest\u201d is, to understate the\nissue, an understatement. Some of the contributors were quite\nobviously livid with rage and other volatile emotions. Others, such as\nMilne himself, who had come in for particularly scathing criticism in\nDingle\u2019s article, were patient and careful in rebuttal. Each of\nthe sixteen contributors to the special article chose a side in the\ncontroversy, either pro Dingle\u2019s inductive empiricism, and con\nMilne et al.\u2019s rationalist hypothetico-deductivism, or vice\nversa. Remarks made by the participants exhibit the full diversity of\nphilosophy of science in their contemporary community. Dingle\u2019s\nviews, in particular, were not without favor.\n\nHarold Jeffreys, F.R.S., noted geologist and astronomer, and author of\na well-regarded philosophy of science book Scientific\nInference (1957), led off with a nice ad hominem:\n\u201cWithout using induction, Milne and Eddington could not order\ntheir lives for a day, and what they are really asserting is that they\nare entitled to use special axioms in physics, for which no need has\nbeen shown.\u201d Jeffreys\u2019 criticism here of course ignores\nthe role of deductive observations in justifying the\n\u201cspecial\u201d axioms. The problem, as Jeffreys sees it,\noriginates in the perpetrators\u2019 \u201cbelief that there is some\nspecial virtue in mathematics.\u201d L.N.G. Filon, F.R.S.,\nvice-chancellor of the University of London agrees on this point,\nnoting that \u201csome men of science appear to think that they can\nsolve the whole problem of Nature by some all-inclusive mathematical\nintuition.\u201d R.A. Sampson, the Astronomer Royal, focusses upon\nthe rationalistic aspects of the \u2018modern Aristotelians\u2019,\nto wit, for their \u201cframing a theory independent of experience,\nsuch as is denounced in Dr. Dingle\u2019s article\u201d, which\nproduces work not unlike that \u201cof a poet or other humanist, who\ngives us at most a number of illustrative cases.\u201d\n",
