    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n4. Natural Philosophy\n\nNatural philosophy is the field with the greatest number of\nArabic-Latin translations. In this discipline, Arabic philosophers had\nbeen particularly active, and Latin philosophers were particularly\ninterested. Arabic natural philosophy reached the Latin West earlier\nthan the other philosophical disciplines. The medical and astrological\ntranslations of the late eleventh and early twelfth century\ntransported much philosophical material of the Graeco-Arabic tradition\nto the Latin world. Under the influence of these Arabic sources, Latin\nauthors of the twelfth century explained natural phenomena by recourse\nto the four elements, the four qualities, the four humours, the three\nspiritus (natural, spiritual, animal) and their organs, the\nlocalization of the soul\u2019s faculties in different cavities of\nthe brain, the distinction between the sublunar and the heavenly\nuniverse, the circular movement of the heavenly spheres, and by using\nAristotelian concepts such as matter and form, action and passion,\ncause and effect. While many Latin writers of the twelfth century\ncontinued to understand nature in terms of the Latin Christian\ntradition, others, in the context of the so-called \u201cschool of\nChartres\u201d, such as William of Conches, Adelard of Bath, Hermann\nof Carinthia and Bernardus Silvestris, drew amply on the new medical\nand astrological sources, often combining them with the doctrines of\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus (Burnett 1982, introduction; cf. also\nLemay 1962). Sometimes they did this by openly dividing their\npresentation into a section according to the church fathers and a\nsection according to the philosophers and natural scientists\n(physici), which integrated material from the Latin and\nArabic philosophical traditions (e.g. the treatises\nPhilosophia by William of Conches and De natura corporis\net animae by William of St.-Thierry).\n\nThe influence of Arabic in natural philosophy in the later Middle\nAges, that is, after the translations of Avicenna and Averroes, is\nparticularly strong in psychology (section 5 below). But other\ndisciplines, such as physics, cosmology, meteorology, or zoology, are\nalso influenced by Arabic sources (see Mandosio 2018 on meteorology),\nin particular by Averroes\u2019 commentaries and by his criticisms of\nAvicenna (listed in Cerami 2018). Several theses from Averroes\u2019\nlong commentaries on Physics and De caelo influenced\nthe history of medieval Latin physics and cosmology: the explanation\nof projectile motion (e.g. of a thrown stone) as the successive motion\nof the medium; the thesis that motion and time differ in reality, but\nonly with respect to the numbering soul; and the theory that the\nheavenly sphere is in a place only accidentally, insofar as it moves\naround the earth at its center (Maier 1951; Wood 2010; Trifogli 2000;\nTrifogli 2010).\n\nOne issue on which Avicenna and Averroes disagreed was the \u201cform\nof bodiliness\u201d (\u1e63\u016bra jismiyya, forma\ncorporeitatis), which, Avicenna argued, is the common form of\nprime matter that underlies all individual bodily forms, whereas\nAverroes denied that the \u201cform of corporeality\u201d is a form\nin the category of substance; it is only an accident, to be identified\nwith indeterminate three-dimensionality (Hyman 1965). Thomas Aquinas\nrejected the idea that prior to the intellective soul there exists a\nsubstantial form in matter (Summa theol. Ia q. 76 a. 4, a.\n6). The Avicennian concept was adopted by others, such as Henry of\nGhent and Duns Scotus, and thus served the theory of the plurality of\nsubstantial forms. That prime matter has its own actuality became a\nprinciple identifying the Franciscan party in the doctrinal struggles\nwith the Dominicans. The discussion of the concept of forma\ncorporeitatis continued well into the sixteenth century (Des\nChene 2000, 81\u201393).\n\nThree prominent topics of natural philosophy are here singled out for\ncloser treatment: the eternity of the world, the persistence of\nelements in a compound and spontaneous generation.\n",
