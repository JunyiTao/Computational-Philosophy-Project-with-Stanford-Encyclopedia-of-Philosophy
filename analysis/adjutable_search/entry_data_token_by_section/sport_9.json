    "main_text": "Topics in the Philosophy of Sport || Performance Enhancement\n3.3 Performance Enhancement\n\n\nAthletes have attempted to improve their performances by deploying a\nvariety of different performance enhancers, ranging from pharmaceutical\nsubstances (e.g. anabolic steroids) to equipment (e.g. full-body 100%\npolyurethane swimsuits), with genetic manipulation seemingly just\naround the corner. Which, if any, performance-enhancing methods should\nbe allowed in sport? Is there any good reason to restrict their use, or\nshould athletes be free to use whatever methods they choose? This\ndebate cuts to the very heart of questions regarding the purpose of\nsporting competition and what counts as excellent athletic performance\n(M\u00f8ller, Hoberman, and Waddington, 2015).\n\n\nThe most widely discussed form of enhancement is the use of performance-enhancing drugs (i.e. \u2018doping\u2019). There are three sides in the doping debate: \u2018pro-doping\u2019, \u2018anti-doping\u2019, and \u2018anti-anti-doping\u2019 (McNamee\n2008; Murray 2016: 128\u2013133). Those who regard doping as a morally\nacceptable practice that should not be banned from sport are\npro-doping. For them, the use of performance-enhancing methods or\nsubstances is justified because it aligns with the idea that a central purpose of sport is to\nstrive to be better or, more broadly, it aligns with a natural human impulse to\ncreate tools to achieve our goals (Brown, 1980, 1984; M\u00f8ller,\n2009; Savulescu, Foddy, and Clayton, 2004). For instance, Savulescu et\nal. argue: \u2018Far from being against the spirit of sport,\nbiological manipulation embodies the human spirit \u2013 the capacity to\nimprove ourselves on the basis of reason and judgment\u2019 (Savulescu\net al., 2004, 667). Pro-doping arguments typically rely on the claim\nthat doping is morally equivalent to the use of other sports technology\nor medical interventions that are widely accepted in sport (e.g.\ncushioned running shoes, graphite tennis rackets, or Lasik eye\nsurgery). If we are willing to allow their use, so the argument goes,\nthen it would be irrational to preclude the use of\nperformance-enhancing substances (Murray, 2018).\n\n\nThe anti-doping side argue that restriction on the use of\nperformance-enhancing methods is justifiable. They typically appeal to\nany of the following arguments: (a) performance enhancement runs\ncounter to the intrinsic nature of sport by undermining its central\npurpose \u2013 the cultivation and display of sporting excellence\n(Devine, 2011; Sandel, 2007); (b) performance enhancement compromises\nthe fairness of competition by providing its users with an unfair\nadvantage (Douglas, 2007; Loland, 2002); (c) performance enhancement\nexerts a negative and dangerous influence on society, especially young people, by spreading acceptance of drug use (Pound, 2006); (d)\nperformance enhancement is intrinsically immoral as it is the\nexpression of a morally corrupt character or violates a moral value\n(e.g. authenticity or naturalness) (Bonte and Tolleneer, 2013;\nHabermas, 2003; Sandel, 2009); and (e) performance enhancement is\nharmful to participants (H\u00f8lm, 2007; Kayser and Broers,\n2015; Savulescu, 2015).\n\nFinally, proponents of the anti-anti-doping view object morally to the\npractical implications of anti-doping regulations (especially with\nregard to policing the use of performance enhancing drugs). On this\nview, a ban on performance-enhancing drugs should not be imposed, even\nif justifiable in principle, because the implementation of such a ban\nwould necessarily involve morally objectionable practices.\nAnti-anti-doping arguments criticise the fight against doping on the\ngrounds that it costs too much (in both economic and moral terms) and\nsecures insufficient benefit in terms of the promotion of compliance\nand the identification of non-compliance with anti-doping rules (Kayser\net al., 2005, 2007). Advocates of this view may endorse principled\nobjections to doping but believe that the institutional requirements\nfor policing such a ban are not morally justifiable. Such an objection\nincludes concerns that the institutional framework associated with\nanti-doping involves the violation of athletes\u2019 rights (Tamburrini,\n2013), that anti-doping policy too closely resembles a criminal justice\nsystem (Kornbeck, 2013), and that the normative assumptions that\nunderpin anti-doping campaigns are morally problematic.\nAnti-anti-doping advocates propose alternative regulations that often\ninvolve the legalization of currently banned substances and methods\n(P\u00e9rez Trivi\u00f1o, 2013; Tamburrini, 2000b; Tamburrini and\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2005; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6, 2009) or the adoption of a\nharm-reduction approach (Kayser et al., 2005, 2007). \n",
