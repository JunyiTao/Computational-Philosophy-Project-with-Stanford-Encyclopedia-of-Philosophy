    "main_text": "Problems for Teleosemantics || Liberalism\n4.4 Sophisticated Concepts and Capacities\n\nThe weightiest objection to teleological theories of content and the\nhardest to assess is that it is unclear how such theories could\nexplain our most sophisticated concepts and cognitive \n capacities.[26]\n\n\nNo naturalistic theory of content at this time yet makes perfectly\nclear how we think about democracy, virtue, quarks or even\ncarburetors, and so this is not a problem that is peculiar to\nteleofunctional theories. However, it is sometimes argued that\nteleological theories of content have a special problem in this\nrespect (e.g., by Peacocke 1992). The thought is that they may have\nsome hope of working for contents that concern things that impact on\nfitness \u2013 food, shelter, mates, etc.\n\u2013 but that they are, in principle, unable to deal with contents\nthat cannot have impacted on fitness, or not in any suitably selective\nway. Some contents cannot have impacted on fitness because they belong\nto the future or are non-existent. Others cannot affect fitness in any\nsuitably selective way because, although they have an impact, their\nimpact is too non-specific: for example, quarks have an impact but\nbecause they are omnipresent in our environment they cannot qualify as\nthe content of a representation by virtue of some simple selectional\nstory.\n\nThis objection is hard to assess for a number of reasons. One is that\nthere are many different kinds of sophisticated concepts and\ncapacities and accounting for them all is a large task. Another is\nthat, while the objection is posed as an objection to all\nteleosemantic theories, different versions will address it in\ndifferent ways. Yet another is that we might allow that it is still\nearly days with respect to the development of teleological (and other)\nnaturalistic theories of mental content. It has really only been since\nthe advent of cognitive science in the middle of the last century and\nthe general acceptance of a broadly physicalist perspective on the\nmind in the decades that followed that philosophers of mind have\ndevoted much effort to trying to give a naturalistic theory of mental\ncontent.\n\nIn view of all of this, the present section can do little more than\noffer a few remarks about how some versions of teleosemantics make\nsome inroads on the issue. Most of the points that follow have been\ntouched on in earlier sections.\n\nIt should be emphasized that those who favor teleosemantic theories\nrarely restrict the relevant functions to those that derive from\nnatural selection operating over an evolutionary span of time. As\nremarked earlier, there might be non-intentional selection processes\nthat operate over the span of a culture or over the span of an\nindividual\u2019s own development or life. Meme selection,\nconditioning or some other forms of learning and neural selection are\nconsidered to be relevant kinds of selection by some proponents of\nteleosemantics.\n\nMillikan would in this context ask us to take note of her notions of\nderived and adapted proper functions (Millikan 1984, ch. 2). What\nMillikan refers to as a \u201cdirect proper function\u201d belongs\nto a mechanism for which there has been selection. The mechanisms that\nproduce camouflage patterns on the surface of the octopus have the\ndirect proper function to do so. The patterns that these mechanisms\nproduce by means of which they perform this function possess what\nMillikan calls a \u201cderived proper function,\u201d derived from\nthe function of the mechanism to provide camouflage. Further, a\npattern produced on a particular occasion has an \u201cadapted\nderived proper function,\u201d which is a relational function, in\nthis case to provide camouflage in that particular setting in which\nthe octopus is situated. Millikan makes use of these extended senses\nin which items may have functions to try to explain the contents of\nnovel representations and representations that are produced as a\nresult of learning. Learning mechanisms have certain functions and\nwhen they perform their functions in particular circumstances their\nproducts can have adapted derived proper functions in relation to\nthose circumstances, whether or not the circumstances obtained during\nthe history of our species.\n\nMillikan (2000) gives an extensive treatment of \n concepts.[27]\n In brief, her view is that conceptions play no role in\ndetermining the extensions of the concepts with which they are\nassociated. Millikan\u2019s theory presupposes innate learning\nmechanisms that are tuned to identify substances of different sorts in\naccord with certain principles. The relevant sort of substance is that\nwhich accounts for the past selective success of the learning\nmechanisms. For instance, some mental mechanisms might have been\nselected for recognizing faces of individuals in accord with certain\nprinciples of operation, and others might have been selected for\nrecognizing animals of different species in accord with other\nprinciples of operation. These mechanisms can acquire the\n\u201cpurpose\u201d to recognize something more specific, such as a\nparticular individual\u2019s face or animals of a particular species:\nthis is because the mechanisms were selected for recognizing things in\nthat domain (faces or animals) in accord with certain principles of\noperation and, in accord with those principles, they now have the have\nthe \u201cpurpose\u201d to recognize a particular individual\u2019s\nface or animals of a particular species. The extension of a substance\nconcept, Millikan tells us, is what substance it was selected to\nrecognize.\n\nLarge issues relevant to assessing the different teleological theories\nof content remain to be settled. On a hopeful note, much good work has\nbeen done in exploring the possible range of such theories, in\nproducing interesting in-principle objections and in responding to\nsuch objections in ways that have resulted in better developed or\nbetter defended versions. We should also keep in mind that serious\nwork on naturalistic theories of content has only been going on for\ndecades rather than centuries and that, on a philosophical timescale,\nthat is quite a short time.\n",
