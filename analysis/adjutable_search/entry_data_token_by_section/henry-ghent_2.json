    "main_text": "Being and Thing\n3. Being and Thing\n\n\nFor Henry (as for Avicenna) every res possesses its own\n\u201ccertitude\u201d (certitudo) that makes it what it is.\nCertitudo here means stability, consistency, and ontological\nself-identity: a triangle is a triangle and nothing else, white is\nwhite and nothing else. Certitudo thus expresses the objective\ncontent by which every thing is identical to itself and is\ndistinguished from other things; in other words, certitudo\nexpresses the essence or quidditas of a thing\n(\u201cunaquaeque res habet certitudinem propriam quae est eius\nquidditas\u201d \u2014 \u201cevery thing possesses its own\ncertitude, which is its essence\u201d). This content can be considered\nin itself, as independent from its physical or mental existence. In an\nabsolute sense, every essence possesses a double indifference: with\nregard to actual existence or non-existence (essence in itself is\nsimply possible), and with regard to universality and particularity.\nThese last two aspects are really conjoined. Essence is particular in\nthat it receives its subsistence in a given suppositum\n(concrete individual entity) from something-other-than-itself, while it\nis universal in that it is abstracted by the intellect from these\nsingular supposita, in which it exists as one in many, in\norder to become predicable by many.\n\n\nYet in itself essence is just essence: \u201cessentia est essentia\ntantum\u201d. Even though for both Avicenna and Henry thing\n(res) and being (ens) are primary notions (or rather\nintentions \u2014 intentiones \u2014 the sense of which we\nshall soon clarify), intentio de re seems to have a certain\nprecedence over intentio de esse, at least logically, in\nvirtue of its double indifference. Nevertheless, the latter is\nconcomitant with the former, since every res only exists in\nphysical reality or in the mind. Possessing an absolute concept\ndoesn\u2019t mean possessing an absolute, separate existence. More\nsimply, through such a concept, a thing can be considered, leaving\naside all that does not form part of its essential content and that\ntherefore constitutes an additional determination. For instance,\nphysical or mental existence, particularity or universality, do not\nform part of \u201chorseness\u201d as such. Yet for this very reason\n\u201chorseness\u201d as such does not exist; instead what exists are\nhorses as individual supposita and the universal concept of\n\u201chorse\u201d, which the mind obtains by abstraction from them.\nThat which possesses an absolute concept can exist in act only through\none of its additional dispositions, with respect to which it is\nnevertheless indifferent (Porro 1996, 2002b).\n\n\nIndifference only concerns the way in which a thing can be\nconsidered. In reality, no essence is indifferent to the point of being\nequally disposed toward being and non-being. The effective indifference\nof essences must therefore be taken in a narrower sense (than in\nAvicenna too): every creatural essence tends naturally toward non-being\n(in Avicennian terms, no possible essence, in the absence of a cause\nfor its existence, could exist), though this inclination can be\nreversed by an external cause. No essence of a thing is so rigidly\noriented toward nothing that it cannot receive being-in-act through a\ndivine action. Similarly, even when placed, in act no thing ever\npossesses its being in an ultimate way: if God were to withdraw His\nsupport, it would fall into non-being. Indifference as absolute\nneutrality is therefore only the result of an intentional analysis. In\nreality, every thing is always either in non-being or in being, and not\nin the same way, since the first of these conditions is co-extensive\nwith the thing itself, the second depends on God.\n\n\nWe still need to clarify in what sense existence can be said to be\nconcomitant with essence. Being has access to essence from the outside,\nin the sense that it does not strictly belong to the essential nature\nof a res, except in the case of God. If this were not the\ncase, a thing (every thing) would not simply be possible in\nitself, but necesse esse (necessary being) on a par with God.\nInstead, being seems to be an accident, or rather it has almost the\nmode of an accident (Quodl. I, q. 9). Nevertheless, it is not\nan accident in the real sense, since it is not added to something\npre-existing, but is rather that by virtue of which a thing\nexists. In other words, we cannot refer here to the Aristotelian\ndefinition of accident (that which has its being in another thing or\ninheres in a subject), but once again to the broader definition given\nby Avicenna, according to which anything that belongs to a thing, being\nexternal to the intention of its essence, can be called an accident\n(\u201cSed intelligendum quod \u2018accidens\u2019 accipitur hic\nlargissime, secundum quod iuxta modum loquendi Avicennae\n\u2018accidens\u2019 rei appellatur omne quod convenit ei et est\nextra intentionem suae essentiae\u201d; Quodl. II, q. 8, ed.\nWielockx, p. 48, ll. 21-23). In this sense an accident is anything that\nis external to the intentio of a res as absolute\nessence, without ever being really distinct from it. With regard to\nessence, actual being (that is, ratio suppositi) represents an\naccident of this type. Being is therefore an intentio that\noccurs to essence without adding anything real, and so it differs from\nessence only intentionally.\n",
