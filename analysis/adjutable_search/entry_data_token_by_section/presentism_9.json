    "main_text": "Reference and Propositions || Singular Propositions\n5.1 Singular Propositions\n\nLet\u2019s move away from the issue of reference and turn to the\nmetaphysics of propositions. First, note that <Socrates was\nwise> is a \u201csingular\u201d proposition: a proposition\nthat\u2019s directly about some individual, Socrates, whereas\n<Plato\u2019s finest teacher was wise> is a\n\u201cparticularised\u201d proposition: a proposition that\u2019s\nabout Socrates, but not directly about them. [See the entry on\n singular propositions.]\n Frequently, propositions are taken to be complex metaphysical\nentities, entities with constituents and structure. [See the entry on\n structured propositions.]\n On this way of thinking, singular propositions are understood\ntypically as constituted by individuals, specifically the individuals\nthat they are (directly) about. Hence, a singular proposition about\nsome, x, is constituted by x itself. By contrast,\nparticularised propositions aren\u2019t constituted by individuals,\nalthough they are structured entities with constituents. A\nparticularised proposition about x isn\u2019t constituted by\nx, but may be constituted by a property of x. On\nthis view, <Socrates was wise>, for example, is constituted by\nSocrates himself, whereas <Plato\u2019s finest teacher was\nwise> isn\u2019t constituted by Socrates\u2014but, perhaps, the\nproposition is constituted by some actual accidental property of\nSocrates, being the finest teacher of Plato or, indeed,\nhaving been the finest teacher of Plato. This way of thinking\nabout (singular) propositions isn\u2019t universal, but it\u2019s\npart of a standard theory with many adherents (see Adams 1986;\nWilliamson 2002; King 2007). In what follows, we refer to this view as\nthe \u2018neo-Russellian\u2019 view of propositions.\n\nIf propositions are complex (structured) entities with constituents,\nthen they depend for their existence upon the existence of their\npropositional constituents. The way that such entities ontologically\ndepend upon constituents is analogous to the way that sets depend upon\ntheir members. Consider, for example, {x}, x\u2019s\nsingleton set. {x} depends upon x for its existence.\nTypically, this is cashed out as follows: necessarily, {x}\nexists only if x exists; and, it\u2019s not the case that\nx exists only if {x} exists. Similarly, we say:\nnecessarily, some proposition P exists only if its\n(propositional) constituent c exist; and, it\u2019s not the\ncase that c exists only if P exists. [See the entry\non\n ontological dependence.]\n\nPresentism faces a problem about how to account for the existence of\nsingular propositions about past entities. It seems that there are\nsuch propositions; recall that \u201cSocrates was wise\u201d\nexpresses a true singular proposition, <Socrates was wise>,\nwhich must exist in order to be true. The problem arises given the\nfollowing treatment of singular propositions: a proposition\nthat\u2019s directly about an individual x is constituted by\nx itself, and propositions depend for their existence upon\nthe existence of their constituents. So, for example, <Socrates was\nwise> is constituted by Socrates himself and this proposition\nontologically depends upon Socrates.\n\nHere\u2019s a deductively valid argument against presentism, based on\nthe above considerations:\n\n(1) If a proposition is\ntrue, then it exists.\n(2) <Socrates was\nwise> is true.\n(3) <Socrates was\nwise> exists. (1, 2)\n(4) If a proposition\nexists and has constituents, then its constituents exist.\n(5) Socrates is a\nconstituent of <Socrates was wise>.\n(6) Socrates exists.\n(3, 4, 5)\n(7) If Socrates exists,\nthen presentism is false.\n(8) Presentism is\nfalse. (6, 7)\n\n\nThe argument is clearly valid. To defend presentism, we must deny one\nof the premises. But each premise appears independently plausible. (1)\ntakes truth to be a monadic property, e.g., being true, and\nreflects a commitment to serious actualism: if P instantiates\nbeing true, then P exists. (2) takes propositions as\ntruth-bearers (or \u201ctruth-value bearers\u201d) and follows from\nthe simple claim that there are truths about the past (more on this in\n \u00a76).\n (4) takes propositions as complex entities and reflects a commitment\nto the principle that a complex depends for its existence upon things\nthat constitute it. The remaining premises, (5) and (7), follow\nstraightforwardly from the two metaphysical theses at issue, the\nneo-Russellian view of propositions and presentism, respectively.\n\nThe most obvious line of response (if we wish to avoid rejecting too\nmany plausible premises) is to deny some aspect of the\nneo-Russellian\u00a0view of propositions. Here we see at least two\nsorts of reply: some suggest\u00a0a modification of the view (e.g.,\nIngram 2019: 85\u2013104), others suggest\u00a0a total rejection of\nit (e.g., Merricks 2012, 2015: 157\u201390). If we take\u00a0the way\nof modification,\u00a0we can accept that propositions are structured\nentities with constituents, but urge that the propositional\nconstituents are presently existing entities, and not any non-existent\npast entities. If we take the way of rejection, we can deny that\npropositions are structured entities and, instead, suggest a distinct\ntreatment of propositions.\n\nFor another line of response, presentism might be modified\n\u00e0 la Williamson (1998, 2002), who defends a view\naccording to which past objects still exist, but are no longer\nconcrete. We don\u2019t take a stand on whether such a position\ndeserves the epithet \u201cpresentism\u201d and, further, we note\nthat Williamson (2013: 20) explicitly states that he would prefer to\nsee the presentism-eternalist debate recast in other terms, using a\ndifferent methodology (see \u00a73.4). Nonetheless, it is clear enough\nthat if the existence of abstract-Socrates (who once was concrete but\nnow is abstract) is compatible with presentism, then this would give\nthe presentist a means to deny (7) and reject the argument given\nabove.\n\nFor discussion of the above problem, in a variety of forms (i.e.,\nconcerning direct reference or singular propositions), see Adams\n(1986: 315\u201322), Fitch (1994), Markosian (2004), Merricks (2012:\n64\u201367, 2015: 170\u20133), and Ingram (2016). There\u2019s a\nmodal analogue of this problem, facing actualism (roughly, the view\nthat \u201conly actual things exist\u201d), and a rich literature\naccompanying it. For discussion of this problem, see Adams (1981),\nPlantinga (1983), Barcan Marcus (1985), Fine (1985), Davidson (2000),\nMerricks (2012: 64\u201371, 2015: 173\u201380), and Speaks\n(2012).\n",
