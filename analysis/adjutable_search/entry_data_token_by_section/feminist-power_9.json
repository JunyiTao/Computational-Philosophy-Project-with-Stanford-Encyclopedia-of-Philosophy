For example, Ann Cudd (2006) draws on the\nframework of rational choice theory to analyze oppression (for related\nwork on rational choice theory and power, see Dowding 2001 and 2009;\nfor critical discussion, see Allen 2008c).\n\nCudd defines oppression in terms of four conditions: 1) the group\ncondition, which states that individuals are subjected to unjust\ntreatment because of their membership (or ascribed membership) in\ncertain social groups (Cudd 2006, 21); 2) the harm condition, which\nstipulates that individuals are systematically and unfairly harmed as\na result of such membership (Cudd 2006, 21); 3) the coercion\ncondition, which specifies that the harms that those individuals\nsuffer are brought about through unjustified coercion (Cudd 2006, 22);\nand 4) the privilege condition, which states that such coercive,\ngroup-based harms count as oppression only when there exist other\nsocial groups who derive a reciprocal privilege or benefit from that\nunjust harm (Cudd 2006, 22\u201323). Cudd then defines oppression as\n\u201can objective social phenomenon\u201d characterized by these\nfour conditions (Cudd 2006, 23).\n\nAs Cudd sees it, the most difficult and interesting question that an\nanalysis of oppression must confront is the \u201cendurance question:\nhow does oppression endure over time in spite of humans\u2019 rough\nnatural equality?\u201d (Cudd 2006, 25). Any satisfactory answer to\nthis question must draw on a combination of empirical,\nsocial-scientific research and normative philosophical theorizing,\ninasmuch as a theory of oppression is an explanatory theory of a\nnormative concept (Cudd 2006, 26). (That oppression is a normative\n\u2013 rather than a purely descriptive \u2013 concept is evident\nfrom the fact that it is defined as an unjust or unfair set of power\nrelations). Cudd argues that social-theoretical frameworks such as\nfunctionalism, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology are\ninadequate for theorizing oppression (Cudd 2006, 39\u201345).\nStructural rational choice theory, in her view, best meets reasonable\ncriteria of explanatory adequacy and therefore provides the best\nsocial-theoretical framework for analyzing oppression. By appealing to\na  structural  theory of rational choice, Cudd\u2019s\nanalysis of oppression avoids relying on assumptions about the\npsychology of individual agents. Rather, as Cudd puts it, \u201cthe\nstructural theory of rational choice assesses the objective social\nrewards and penalties that are consequent on\u201d the interactions\nand social status of specific group members and \u201cuses these\nassessments to impute preferences and beliefs to individuals based\npurely on their social group memberships\u201d (Cudd 2006, 45). But,\nas a structural theory of rational choice, the framework\nassumes \u201cthat agents behave rationally in the sense that they\nchoose actions that maximize their (induced) expected utilities\u201d\n(Cudd 2006, 46). In other words, structural rational choice theory\nmodels human actions as \u201c(basically instrumentally rational)\nindividual choice constrained within socially structured\npayoffs\u201d (Cudd 2006, 37). When utilized to analyze oppression,\nstructural rational choice theory suggests that the key to answering\nthe endurance question lies in the fact that \u201cthe oppressed are\nco-opted through their own short-run rational choices to reinforce the\nlong-run oppression of their social group\u201d (Cudd 2006,\n21\u201322).\n\nSally Haslanger\u2019s work on gender and racial oppression, like\nCudd\u2019s, is heavily informed by the tools of analytic philosophy,\nthough Haslanger also situates her work within the tradition of\nCritical Theory (see Haslanger 2012, 22\u201330). Haslanger distinguishes\nbetween two kinds of cases of oppression: agent oppression, in which\n\u201ca person or persons (the oppressor(s)) inflicts harm upon\nanother (the oppressed) wrongfully or unjustly\u201d (314) and\nstructural oppression, in which \u201cthe oppression is not an\nindividual wrong but a social/political wrong; that is, it is a\nproblem lying in our collective arrangements, an injustice in our\npractices or institutions\u201d (314). Having made this distinction,\nHaslanger then argues for a mixed analysis of oppression that does not\nattempt to reduce agent oppression to structural oppression or vice\nversa. The danger of reducing structural oppression to agent\noppression \u2013 what Haslanger calls the individualistic approach to\noppression \u2013 is that doing so fails to acknowledge that\n\u201csometimes structures themselves, not individuals are the\nproblem\u201d (320). The danger of reducing agent oppression to\nstructural oppression \u2013 what Haslanger calls the institutionalist\napproach \u2013 is that such an approach \u201cfails to distinguish those\nwho abuse their power to do wrong and those who are privileged but do\nnot exploit their power\u201d (320). Haslanger\u2019s mixed\napproach, by contrast, is \u201cattentive simultaneously [and, we\nmight add, non-reductively] to both agents and structures\u201d\n(11).\n\nHaslanger also connects her account of structural domination and\noppression to her analysis of gender. Haslanger offers what she calls\na \u201cfocal analysis\u201d of gender, according to which the core\nof gender is \u201cthe pattern of social relations that constitute\nthe social classes of men as dominant and women as subordinate\u201d\n(228). Other things \u2013 such as norms, identities, symbols, etc \u2013 are\nthen gendered in relation to those social relations. On her analysis,\ngender categories are defined in terms of how one is socially\npositioned with respect to a broad complex of oppressive relations\nbetween groups that are distinguished from one another by means of\nsexual difference (see 229\u2013230). As Haslanger explains, the\n\u201cbackground idea\u201d informing this account of gender is\n\u201cthat women are oppressed, and that they are oppressed\nas women\u201d (231).\n\nBy claiming that women are oppressed as women, Haslanger reiterates an\nearlier claim made by radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon\n(see, for example, MacKinnon 1987, 56\u201357). Indeed, Haslanger\u2019s\nanalysis is heavily indebted to MacKinnon\u2019s work (see Haslanger\n2012, 35\u201382), though she does not endorse MacKinnon\u2019s strong\nclaims about the link between objectivity and masculinity, nor does\nshe adopt a dyadic (or, to use Haslanger\u2019s terminology,\nreductively agent focused) understanding of oppression. But, like\nMacKinnon, Haslanger believes that \u201cgender categories are\ndefined relationally \u2013 one is a woman (or a man) by virtue of\none\u2019s position in a system of social relations\u201d (58). This\nmeans that \u201cone\u2019s gender is an extrinsic property,\nand\u2026it is not necessary that we each have the gender we now have, or\nthat we have any gender at all\u201d (58). Since the social relations\nin terms of which gender categories are defined are relations of\nhierarchical domination and structural oppression, \u201cgender is,\nby definition, hierarchical: Those who function socially as men have\npower over those who function socially as women\u201d (61). As\nHaslanger admits, referencing the sex/gender distinction, this does\nnot mean that all males have power over all females \u2013 but it does\nmean that females who are not subordinated by males are not, strictly\nspeaking, women, and vice versa. Moreover, as Haslanger notes,\n\u201cMacKinnon\u2019s account of gender, like others that define\ngender hierarchically, has the consequence that feminism aims to\nundermine the very distinction it depends upon. If feminism is\nsuccessful, there will no longer be a gender distinction as\nsuch\u201d because the complex of social relations of domination and\nstructural oppression that give gender its meaning will no longer\nexist (62). While endorsing MacKinnon\u2019s radical conclusion with\nrespect to the currently existing gender categories of\n\u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019, Haslanger\u2019s own\naccount offers a somewhat more nuanced view that allows for the future\npossibility of a kind of gender difference that would not be predicted\non gender dominance: \u201cgender can be fruitfully understood as a\nhigher order genus that includes not only the hierarchical social\npositions of man and woman, but potentially other non-hierarchical\nsocial positions defined in part by reference to reproductive\nfunction. I believe gender as we know it takes hierarchical\nforms as men and women; but the theoretical move of treating men and\nwomen as only two kinds of gender provides resources for thinking\nabout other (actual) genders, and the political possibility of\nconstructing non-hierarchical genders\u201d (235)\n",
