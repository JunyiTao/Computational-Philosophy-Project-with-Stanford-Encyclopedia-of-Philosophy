In his Principles of\nPolitics Applicable to All Governments (1810), Benjamin Constant,\nwho admired Bentham\u2019s originality and praised his contributions\nto political economy and penal law, questioned the vagueness of the\nconcept of utility, which he thought susceptible to many different\ndefinitions and pregnant with danger as a principle of policy.\nConstant preferred the prescriptions of natural law as the\nphilosophical basis for government. William Hazlitt, who was for a\ntime Bentham\u2019s tenant, satirised him as a venerable anchorite in\nthe quiet of his cell reducing law to a system and the mind of man to\na machine, divorced from the life of spirit, imagination, passion and\nsentiments of love, a philosophy \u201cfit neither for man nor\nbeast\u201d (1826, 184). Thomas Carlyle summed up the general\nperception of the crassness of \u201cBenthamee utility\u201d as the\n\u201cpig-philosophy\u201d, nothing more than \u201cvirtue by\nProfit and Loss\u201d (1840, 65). Other critics, like the Whig\nreformers James Mackintosh and T.B. Macaulay, ready to follow\nBentham\u2019s lead in law reform, were also dismayed by the\ndiminished view of human nature that underpinned his philosophy and\nattacked the radical proposals for political reform that emanated from\nthe utilitarian camp (Lively and Rees 1978). The Anglican divine John\nColls, for a time Bentham\u2019s secretary before he took holy\norders, published an intemperate expos\u00e9 of his former employer\nas a selfish and bigoted subversive in Utilitarianism\nUnmasked (1844), a work which proved popular among his fellow\nclergymen.\n\nAs the nineteenth century wore on assailants came forth from all\npoints across the philosophical spectrum. Marx considered Bentham an\n\u201carch-philistine\u201d and utilitarianism a superficial and\nephemeral bourgeois ideology (Capital I, Ch. XXIV, sect. 5).\nSundry religionists, including those of a philosophical bent like the\nclassicist J.B. Mayor, intuitionists like William Whewell, and\nidealists like Green, F.H. Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet and D.G. Ritchie\ncombined to attack its atomism, crude materialism, narrowly construed\ntheory of motivation, and lack of appreciation of the spiritual\ndimension of the human condition. The legal scholar Henry Maine could\nadmire the bravado and ambition of Bentham\u2019s science of\njurisprudence, but also deplored his failure to appreciate the\nhistorical and evolutionary nature of law; he further objected to\nBentham\u2019s faith that the ignorant masses could truly know what\nis in their best interest. As we have seen, on the other side of the\nAtlantic, Bentham\u2019s legal philosophy made some headway but the\nunderlying moral ideas met stiff resistance, and his supposed atheism\nadded fuel to the fire of outrage bellowing from evangelical critics.\nIn a different vein, the Pragmatists, notably William James and John\nDewey, may have shared Bentham\u2019s ontological misgivings about\nthe meaning and misrepresentation of fictions and fictitious entities\n(Quinn 2012) and recognised the critical value of the utility\nprinciple to the development of Liberalism as a philosophy of action\n(Dewey 1935, 13\u201317), but they rejected the claim that all\nmotivation may be reduced to a drive to seek pleasure and avoid pain,\nwhich they viewed as a self-defeating commitment to materialist\nindividualism (Dewey and Tufts 1908, 271\u201374; see also Crimmins\n2022, Epilogue). Like J. S. Mill, the Pragmatists also dismissed the\nidea that any single form of the summum bonum could account\nfor the many goods that people seek (James 1891, 186\u2013200). There\nhave been many critics of Bentham since.\n\nNumerous commentaries on Bentham\u2019s philosophy have also\nappeared, from the early general accounts of Leslie Stephen (1900) and\nElie Hal\u00e9vy (1901\u20134), to more recent introductions to his\nideas (Harrison 1983; Dinwiddy 1989b; Crimmins 2004, 2013; Schofield\n2009; Quinn 2022) and a wide range of revisionist disquisitions on\ndiscrete aspects of his thought. In addition to the themes and issues\nalready addressed in this article, Hart (1982) and Postema (1989) have\npenned important studies of Bentham\u2019s jurisprudence, while\ntopics that have engaged contemporary commentators include his\ncritical views on race and slavery (Jones 2005; Rosen 2005),\ncolonialism and empire (Pitts 2005; Cain 2011; Causer, Finn and\nSchofield 2022), marriage, divorce, adultery, desertion and\nwife-beating (Sokol 2011), and sexual liberty (Dabhoiwala 2010,\n168\u201374; Schofield 2014). Schofield (2013) provides an overview\nof some new directions in Bentham studies, to which may be added\nessays on the global Bentham (Armitage 2011; Zhai and Palmer 2021),\nBentham and the arts (Julius, Quinn and Schofield 2020), and policing\n(Jacques and Schofield 2021). Many of these commentaries have been\ninspired by the publication of the authoritative volumes in The\nCollected Works of Jeremy Bentham that began appearing in 1968 to\nreplace the poorly edited and incomplete Bowring edition\n(1838\u201343). The Collected Works continues to bring to\nlight new and more complete versions of Bentham\u2019s writings and\npreviously unpublished material. At the time of writing, 35 of the\nprojected 80 volumes have been published. As new volumes appear the\ntopics of discussion and debate will continue to increase, burnishing\nthe reputation of a philosopher whose ideas remain relevant in a great\nnumber of areas of interest to moralists, psychologists, economists,\nhistorians, legal and political philosophers.\n",
