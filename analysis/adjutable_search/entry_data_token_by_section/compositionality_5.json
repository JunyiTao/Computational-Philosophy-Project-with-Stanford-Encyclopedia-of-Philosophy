    "main_text": "Clarifications || Context\n1.5 Context\n\nThe fact that natural languages contain indexicals forces us to\ndistinguish between two notions of meaning. On the one hand,\nexpressions have a standing meaning fixed by convention and\nknown to those who are linguistically competent. On the other hand,\nexpressions in use are associated with occasion meanings\nwhich is discerned by interpreters in part on the basis of contextual\ninformation. The terminology is from Quine (1960). Kaplan (1977) uses\nthe terms character and content but he makes a\nnumber of substantive assumptions about what these are which I intend\nto abstract from. Thus, we should not assume that occasion meanings\nare structured entities built from objects, properties, and relations,\nor even that the occasion meanings of declarative sentences are always\npropositions. Also, we need not assume that standing meanings are\nfunctions from contexts to occasion meanings, or even that they\ndetermine in context what occasion meanings are.\n\nWhen we speak of meaning, usually we have standing meaning in mind.\nBut not always\u2014when a contract specifies that within its main\ntext \u2018current edition of building code\u2019 means the 2012\nedition of the Florida Building Code, it obviously fixes occasion\nmeaning. Corresponding to these two notions of meaning, there are two\nversions of the principle of compositionality. Since occasion-meaning\nis determined, in part, by context (C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\)) must be\nrelativized to\n context:[10]\n\n(C\\(_{\\textit{stand}}\\))For\nevery complex expression e in L, the\nstanding meaning of e in L is determined by the\nstructure of e in L and the standing meanings of the\nconstituents of e in L.\n(C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\))\nFor every complex expression e in L and every\ncontext c, the occasion meaning of e in L\nat c is determined by the structure of e in L and\nthe occasion meanings of the constituents of e in L\nat c.\n\n\nLet\u2019s call expressions whose occasion meaning sometimes deviates\nfrom their standing meaning context-dependent. The scope of\ncontext-dependent lexical items is a matter of controversy. On the one\nextreme, there are semantic minimalists who think these\ninclude only a handful expressions: the personal and demonstrative\npronouns, a few adverbs (e.g., \u2018here\u2019, \u2018now\u2019,\n\u2018next\u2019), and a few adjectives (e.g.\u2018actual\u2019,\n\u2018present\u2018, \u2018local\u2019); cf. Cappelen and Lepore\n(2005). On the other\nextreme are radical contextualists who think essentially all\nlexical items are context-dependent; e.g., Searle (1980). As usual,\nmost theorists are somewhere in the middle\u2014taking heat from both\nsides that their view is untenable.\n\nRadical contextualism is sometimes seen as a challenge to\ncompositionality, more precisely, to\n (C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\));\n cf. Cohen (1986), Lahav (1989), Fodor (2001). It shouldn\u2019t be.\nAn effective argument from context-dependence against\n (C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\))\n would need to show that there is at least one complex expression in\nL whose occasion meaning varies with context, while the\noccasion meanings of its constituents all remain the same. The usual\nconsiderations against compositionality typically omit the second\npart. Take for example Searle\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he\nsort of thing that constitutes cutting the grass is quite different\nfrom e.g., the sort of thing that constitutes cutting a cake\u201d\n(Searle 1980: 222). What follows from this? Nothing more than the fact\nthat the occasion meaning of \u2018cut\u2019 is sensitive to a\nfeature of the context in which it is used, in particular, to its\nlinguistic environment. This is fully compatible with\n (C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\)).\n \n\nOf course, we should not insist that the occasion meaning of\n\u2018cut\u2019 depends on nothing but its standing meaning and the\nlinguistic environment in which it occurs. As Searle himself\nemphasized, \u2018cut the grass\u2019 can pick out one sort of thing\nif we are using it in a context of selling strips of grass turf and\nanother it we are using in a context of selling lawn mowers. Arguably,\nthis shows that the occasion meaning of \u2018cut\u2019 depends on\nextra-linguistic factors as well. No matter: this too is fully\ncompatible with\n (C\\(_{\\textit{occ}}\\)).\n Compositionality demands nothing more than that all\ncontext-dependence be accounted for via context-dependence in the\nlexicon and it takes no stance of how much and what kind of lexical\ncontext-dependence there might be; cf. Szab\u00f3 (2010), Lasersohn\n(2012), and Recanati\n (2012).[11]\n\n",
