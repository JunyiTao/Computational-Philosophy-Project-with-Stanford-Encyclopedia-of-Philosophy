    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nSartre\u2019s life has been examined by many biographies, starting\nwith Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s Adieux (and, subsequently,\nCohen-Solal 1985; Levy 2003; Flynn 2014; Cox 2019). Sartre\u2019s\nown literary \u201clife\u201d exemplifies trends he thematized in\nboth Words and Being and Nothingness, summed up by\nhis claim that \u201cto be dead is to be prey for the living\u201d\n(Sartre 1943 [1956: 543]). Sartre himself was one of the first to\nundertake such an autobiographical effort, via his evocation of his\nown childhood in Words (1964a)\u2014in which Sartre applies\nto himself his method of existential psychoanalysis, thereby\ncomplicating this life/death binary.\n\nLike many of his generation, Sartre lived through a series of major\ncultural and historical events that his existential philosophy\nresponded to and attempted to shape. He was born in 1905 and died in\n1980, spanning most of the twentieth century and the trajectory that\nthe Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm refers to as the \u201cage of\nextremes\u201d, a period that was also well-described in the middle\nof that century in Albert Camus\u2019 The Rebel,\nnotwithstanding that the reception of Camus\u2019 book in Les\nTemps Modernes in 1951\u20132 caused Sartre and Camus to very\npublicly fall out.\n\nThe major events of Sartre\u2019s life seem relatively clear, at\nleast viewed from an external perspective. A child throughout World\nWar 1, he was a young man during the Great Depression but born into\nrelative affluence, brought up by his grandmother. At least as\npresented in Words, Sartre\u2019s childhood was filled with\nbooks, the dream of posterity and immortality in those books, and in\nwhich he grappled with his loss of the use of one eye and encountered\nthe realities of his own appearance revealed through his\nmother\u2019s look after a haircut\u2014suffice to say, he was not\nclassically beautiful.\n\nSartre\u2019s education, by contrast, was classical\u2014the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. His education at the ENS was\noriented around the history of philosophy, and the influential\nbifurcation of that time between the neo-Kantianism of Brunschvicg and\nthe vitalism of Bergson. While Sartre failed his first attempt at the\naggregation, apparently by virtue of being overly ambitious, on\nrepeating the year he topped the class (de Beauvoir was second, at her\nfirst attempt and at the age of 21, then the youngest to complete).\nSartre then taught philosophy at various schools, notably at Le Havre\nfrom 1931\u201336 and while he was composing his early philosophy and\nhis great philosophical novel, Nausea. He never entered a\nclassical university position.\n\nAlthough Sartre\u2019s philosophical encounter with phenomenology had\nalready occurred (around 1933), which de Beauvoir described as causing\nhim to turn pale with emotion (de Beauvoir 1960 [1962: 112]), with the\nonset of World War 2 Sartre merged those philosophical concerns with\nmore obviously existential themes like freedom, authenticity,\nresponsibility, and anguish, as translated into English from the\nFrench angoisse by both Hazel Barnes and Sarah Richmond. He\nwas a Meteorologist in Alsace in the war and was captured by the\nGerman Army in 1940 and imprisoned for just under a year (see War\nDiaries). During this socio-political turmoil, Sartre remained\nremarkably prolific.  Notable publications include his play, No\nExit (1947), Being and Nothingness (1943), and then\ncompleting Existentialism is a Humanism\n(1946), Anti-semite and Jew (1946), and founding and\ncoediting Les Temps Modernes, commencing from 1943\n(Sartre\u2019s major contributions are collected in his\nseries Situations, especially volume V).\n\nSartre continued to lead various social and political protests after\nthat period, especially concerning French colonialism (see\n section 7\n below). By the time of the student revolutions in May 1968 he was no\nlonger quite the dominant cultural and intellectual force he had been,\nbut he did not retreat from public life and engagement and died in\n1980. Estimates of the numbers of those attending his funeral\nprocession in Paris range from 50\u2013100,000 people. Sartre had\nbeen in the midst of a collaboration with Benny Levy regarding ethics,\nthe so-called \u201cHope Now\u201d interviews, whose status remain\nsomewhat controversial in Sartrean scholarship, given the interviews\nwere produced in the midst of Sartre\u2019s illness and shortly\nbefore he died, and the fact that the relevant audio-recordings are\nnot publicly available.\n",
