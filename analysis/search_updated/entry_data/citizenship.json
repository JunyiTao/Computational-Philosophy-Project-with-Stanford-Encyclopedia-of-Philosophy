    "preamble": "\n\nA citizen is a member of a political community who enjoys the rights\nand assumes the duties of membership. This broad definition is\ndiscernible, with minor variations, in the works of contemporary\nauthors as well as in the entry \u201ccitoyen\u201d in\nDiderot\u2019s and d\u2019Alembert\u2019s\nEncyclop\u00e9die\n [1753].[1]\n Notwithstanding this common starting-point and certain shared\nreferences, the differences between 18th century\ndiscussions and contemporary debates are significant. The\nencyclop\u00e9diste\u2019s main preoccupation,\nunderstandable for one living in a monarchy, was the relationship\nbetween the concepts \u2018citizen\u2019 and \u2018subject\u2019.\nWere they the same (as Hobbes asserted) or contradictory (as a reading\nof Aristotle\n suggested)?[2]\n This issue is less central today as it is often assumed that a\nliberal democratic regime is an appropriate starting-point for\nthinking about citizenship. This does not mean, however, that the\nconcept has become uncontroversial. After a long period of relative\ncalm, there has been a dramatic upsurge in philosophical interest in\ncitizenship since the early 1990s (Kymlicka and Norman 1994).\n\nTwo broad challenges have led theorists to re-examine the concept:\nfirst, the need to acknowledge the internal diversity of contemporary\nliberal democracies; second, the pressures wrought by globalisation on\nthe territorial, sovereign state. We will focus on each of these two\nchallenges, examining how they prompted new discussions and\ndisagreements.\n\nThe entry has four sections. The first examines the main dimensions of\ncitizenship (legal, political, identity) and sees how they are\ninstantiated in very different ways within the two dominant models:\nthe republican and the liberal. The feminist critique of the\nprivate/public distinction, central to both models, serves as a bridge\nto the entry\u2019s second section. It focuses upon two important\ndebates about the implications of social and cultural pluralism to\nconceptions of citizenship: first, should they recognize, rather than\ntranscend, difference and, if so, does this recognition affect\ncitizenship\u2019s purported role in strengthening social cohesion?\nSecond, how is one to understand the relation between citizenship and\nnationality under conditions of pluralism? The third section discusses\nthe challenges which globalisation poses to theories of citizenship.\nThese theories have long taken for granted the idea that\ncitizenship\u2019s necessary context is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. This premise is being contested by those who question the\nstate\u2019s right to determine who is accepted as a member and/or\nclaim that citizenship can be meaningful beyond the boundaries of the\nnation-state. The entry\u2019s fourth and final section looks at how\nrecent discussions in the fields of disability rights and animal\nrights challenge a basic premise of the literature on citizenship\nsince Aristotle: the idea that discursive rationality constitutes a\nthreshold condition to citizenship.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Dimensions of citizenship\n1.1 Definitions\n\nThe concept of citizenship is composed of three main elements or\ndimensions (Kymlicka and Norman 2000; Carens 2000). The first is\ncitizenship as legal status, defined by civil, political and social\nrights. Here, the citizen is the legal person free to act according to\nthe law and having the right to claim the law\u2019s protection. It\nneed not mean that the citizen takes part in the law\u2019s\nformulation, nor does it require that rights be uniform between\ncitizens. The second considers citizens specifically as political\nagents, actively participating in a society\u2019s political\ninstitutions. The third refers to citizenship as membership in a\npolitical community that provides a distinct source of identity.\n\nIn many ways, the identity dimension is the least straightforward of\nthe three. Authors tend to include under this heading many different\nthings related to identity, both individual and collective, and social\nintegration. Arguably, this is inescapable since citizens\u2019\nsubjective sense of belonging, sometimes called the\n\u201cpsychological\u201d dimension of citizenship (Carens 2000,\n166), necessarily affects the strength of the political\ncommunity\u2019s collective identity. If enough citizens display a\nrobust sense of belonging to the same political community, social\ncohesion is obviously strengthened. However, since many other factors\ncan impede or encourage it, social integration should be seen as an\nimportant goal (or problem) that citizenship aims to achieve (or\nresolve), rather than as one of its elements. As we will see, one\ncrucial test for any conception of citizenship is whether it can be\nsaid to contribute to social integration.\n\nRelations between the three dimensions are complex: the rights a\ncitizen enjoys will partly define the range of available political\nactivities while explaining how citizenship can be a source of\nidentity by strengthening her sense of self-respect (Rawls 1972, 544).\nA strong civic identity can itself motivate citizens to participate\nactively in their society\u2019s political life. That distinct groups\nwithin a state do not share the same sense of identity towards\n\u2018their\u2019 political community (or communities) can be a\nreason to argue in favour of a differentiated allocation of rights\n(Carens 2000, 168\u2013173).\n\nDifferences between conceptions of citizenship centre around four\ndisagreements: over the precise definition of each element (legal,\npolitical and identity); over their relative importance; over the\ncausal and/or conceptual relations between them; over appropriate\nnormative standards.\n1.2 Two models of citizenship: republican and liberal\n\nDiscussions about citizenship usually have, as their point of\nreference, one of two models: the republican or the liberal. The\nrepublican model\u2019s sources can be found in the writings of\nauthors like Aristotle, Tacitus, Cicero, Machiavelli, Harrington and\nRousseau, and in distinct historical experiences: from Athenian\ndemocracy and Republican Rome to the Italian city-states and\nworkers\u2019 councils.\n\nThe key principle of the republican model is civic self-rule, embodied\nin classical institutions and practices like the rotation of offices,\nunderpinning Aristotle\u2019s characterization of the citizen as one\ncapable of ruling and being ruled in turn. Citizens are, first and\nforemost, \u201cthose who share in the holding of office\u201d\n(Aristotle Politics, 1275a8). Civic self-rule is also at the\nheart of Rousseau\u2019s project in the Contrat Social: it\nis their co-authoring of the laws via the general will that makes\ncitizens free and laws\n legitimate.[3]\n Active participation in processes of deliberation and decision-making\nensures that individuals are citizens, not\n subjects.[4]\n In essence, the republican model emphasizes the second dimension of\ncitizenship, that of political agency.\n\nThe liberal model\u2019s origins are traceable to the Roman Empire\nand early-modern reflections on Roman law (Walzer 1989, 211). The\nEmpire\u2019s expansion resulted in citizenship rights being extended\nto conquered peoples, profoundly transforming the concept\u2019s\nmeaning. Citizenship meant being protected by the law rather than\nparticipating in its formulation or execution. It became an\n\u201cimportant but occasional identity, a legal status rather than a\nfact of everyday life\u201d (Walzer 1989, 215). The focus here is on\nthe first dimension: citizenship is primarily understood as a legal\nstatus rather than as a political office. It now \u201cdenotes\nmembership in a community of shared or common law, which may or may\nnot be identical with a territorial community\u201d (Pocock 1995,\n37). The Roman experience shows that the legal dimension of\ncitizenship is potentially inclusive and indefinitely extensible.\n\nThe liberal tradition, which developed from the 17th\ncentury onwards, understands citizenship primarily as a legal status:\npolitical liberty is important to protect individual freedoms from\ninterference by other individuals or the authorities themselves.\nCitizens exercise these freedoms primarily in the world of private\nassociations and attachments, rather than in the political domain.\n\nAt first glance, the two models offer a clear set of alternatives:\ncitizenship as a political office or a legal status; central to an\nindividual\u2019s sense of self or as an \u201coccasional\nidentity\u201d. The citizen appears either as the primary political\nagent or as an individual whose private activities leave little time\nor inclination to engage actively in politics, entrusting the business\nof law-making to representatives. If the liberal model of citizenship\ndominates contemporary constitutional democracies, the republican\ncritique of the private citizen\u2019s passivity and\ninsignificance is still alive and well.\n\nRepublicans have problems of their own. First and foremost is a\nconcern, often repeated since Benjamin Constant, that their ideal has\nbecome largely obsolete in the changed circumstances of the\n\u201cgrands \u00c9tats modernes\u201d (Constant 1819).\nAiming to realize the original republican ideal in the present context\nwould be a disaster, as was the Jacobins\u2019 attempt during the\nFrench revolution (Walzer 1989, 211). Today\u2019s citizens will not\nbe Romans: first, the scale and complexity of modern states seem to\npreclude the kind of civic engagement required by the republican\nmodel. If an individual\u2019s chances of having an impact as an\nactive citizen are close to nil, then it makes more sense for him to\ncommit himself to non-political activities, be they economic, social\nor familial. His identity as citizen is not central to his sense of\nself and politics is only one of his many interests (Constant 1819,\n316). Second, the heterogeneity of modern states does not allow the\nkind of \u201cmoral unity\u201d and mutual trust that has been\nprojected onto the ancient polis, qualities deemed necessary\nto the functioning of republican institutions (Walzer 1989, 214).\nHowever, if ancient virtue is irrecoverable, the republican model may\nstill act today as \u201ca benchmark that we appeal to when assessing\nhow well our institutions and practices are functioning\u201d (Miller\n2000, 84). In essence, this involves a reformulation of the model,\nquestioning some of its original premises while holding onto the ideal\nof the citizen as an active political agent.\n\nInstead of opposing the two models, we could reasonably see them as\ncomplementary. Political liberty, as Constant pointed out, is the\nnecessary guarantee of individual liberty. Echoing Constant, Michael\nWalzer considers that the two conceptions \u201cgo hand in\nhand\u201d since \u201cthe security provided by the authorities\ncannot just be enjoyed; it must itself be secured, and sometimes\nagainst the authorities themselves. The passive enjoyment of\ncitizenship requires, at least intermittently, the activist politics\nof citizens\u201d (Walzer 1989, 217). There are times when\nindividuals need only be \u201cprivate citizens\u201d and\nothers when they must become \u201cprivate citizens\u201d\n(Ackermann 1988). Can we expect passive spectators of political life\nto become active citizens should the need arise? This is no easy\nquestion and may explain why Constant ended his famous essay by\ninsisting that the regular exercise of political liberty is the surest\nmeans of moral improvement, opening citizens\u2019 minds and spirits\nto the public interest, and to the importance of defending their\nfreedoms. Such habituation underpins their capacity and willingness to\nprotect their liberties and the institutions that support them\n(Constant 1819,\n 327\u2013328).[5]\n1.3 The feminist critique\n\nSince the 1970s, feminist theorists have sharply criticized the\nrepublican and liberal models\u2019 shared assumption of a rigid\nseparation between the private and the public spheres. Their critique\nhas provided the impetus to the development of alternative conceptions\nof politics and citizenship.\n\nIn its classical formulation, the republican conception sees the\npublic/political sphere as the realm of liberty and equality: it is\nthere that free, male citizens engage with their peers and deliberate\nover the common good, deciding what is just or unjust, advantageous or\nharmful (Aristotle Politics, 1253a11). The political space\nmust be protected from the private sphere, defined as the domain of\nnecessity and inequality, where the material reproduction of the\npolis is secured. Women, associated with the \u2018natural\nworld\u2019 of reproduction, are denied citizenship and relegated to\nthe household.\n\nFeminists have criticized this rigid division as mythical since both\nthe separation itself and the radically unequal conception of the\nhousehold that it presupposed \u201cwere clearly the outcome of\npolitical decisions made in the public sphere\u201d (Okin 1992, 60).\nIf the division ostensibly made it possible for citizens to engage\nwith each other as equals, feminists doubt whether it ever was the\nideal way of achieving this goal. Hence Susan Okin\u2019s question to\nrepublicans: \u201cWhich is likely to produce better citizens,\ncapable of acting as each other\u2019s equals? Having to deal with\nthings part of the time \u2014 even the \u2018mundane\u2019 things\nof daily life? Or treating most people as things?\u201d\n(Okin 1992, 64\u201365). An egalitarian family is a much more fertile\nground for equal citizens than one organized like a school for\ndespotism (J.S. Mill); if this means that the political space cannot\nremain insulated from the world of things, there\u2019s no great\nloss.\n\nThe liberal model, for its part, gives primacy to the private sphere.\nPolitical liberty is seen in instrumental terms: the formal rights of\nindividuals secure the private sphere from outside interference,\nallowing the free pursuit of their particular interests (Dietz 1998,\n380\u201381). However, the neutral language of Lockean egalitarian\nindividualism hides the reality of women\u2019s subjection:\n\u201cwoman\u2019s sphere\u201d can be read as \u201cmale\nproperty\u201d since wives are described as naturally subordinated to\ntheir husbands. Here as well, the division between private and public\nhas prevented women from gaining access to the public (Pateman 1989,\n120; Dietz 1998, 380\u201381; Okin 1991, 118).\n\nSince the public and private \u201care, and always have been,\ninextricably connected\u201d (Okin 1992, 69), the upshot of the\nfeminist critique is not simply to make models of citizenship\ninclusive by recognizing that women are individuals or to acknowledge\nthat they too can be citizens. Rather, we must see how laws and\npolicies structure personal circumstances (e.g. laws about rape and\nabortion, child-care policies, allocation of welfare benefits, etc.)\nand how some \u2018personal problems\u2019 have wider significance\nand can only be solved collectively through political action (Pateman\n1989, 131). This does not make the distinction irrelevant and the\ncategories collapsible. However, it does mean that the boundaries\nbetween public and private should be seen as a social construction\nsubject to change and contestation and that their hierarchical\ncharacterization should be resisted.\n\nOnce the abstractions that characterize both the classical and the\nliberal conceptions are discarded, the citizen sheds his\n\u201cpolitical lion skin\u201d (Pateman 1989, 92 quoting Marx 1843)\nand appears as \u201csituated\u201d in a social world characterized\nby differences of gender, class, language, race, ethnicity, culture,\netc. To accept that politics cannot and should not be insulated from\nprivate/social/economic life is not to dissolve the political, but,\nrather, to revive it since anything is as political as citizens choose\nto make it. This contextualized conception of the political has\ninformed much of the criticism aimed at the universalist model of\ncitizenship and has inspired the formulation of a differentialist\nalternative.\n2. The challenge of internal diversity\n2.1 Universalist vs differentialist conceptions of citizenship\n\nThe universalist or unitary model defines citizenship primarily as a\nlegal status through which an identical set of civil, political and\nsocial rights are accorded to all members of the polity. T.H.\nMarshall\u2019s seminal essay \u201cCitizenship and Social\nClass\u201d is the main reference for this model, which became\nprogressively dominant in post-World War II liberal democracies.\nMarshall\u2019s central thesis was that the 20th\ncentury\u2019s expansion of social rights was crucial to the working\nclass\u2019s progressive integration in British society (Marshall\n 1950).[6]\n Similar stories were told in other Western democracies: the\ndevelopment of welfare policies aimed at softening the impact of\nunemployment, sickness and distress was fundamental to political and\nsocial stability. The apparent success of the post-war welfare state\nin securing social cohesion was a strong argument in favour of a\nconception of citizenship focused on the securing of equal civil,\npolitical and social rights.\n\nThe universalist model was aggressively targeted at the end of the\n1980s as the moral and cultural pluralism of contemporary liberal\nsocieties elicited increasing theoretical attention. Scepticism\ntowards the universalist model was spurred by concerns that the\nextension of citizenship rights to groups previously excluded had not\ntranslated into equality and full integration, notably in the case of\nAfro-Americans and women (Young 1989; Williams 1998). A questioning of\nthe causal relation assumed between citizenship as a uniform legal\nstatus and civic integration followed.\n\nCritics argued that the model proves exclusionary if one interprets\nuniversal citizenship as requiring (a) the transcendence of\nparticular, situated perspectives to achieve a common, general point\nof view and (b) the formulation of laws and policies that are\ndifference-blind (Young 1989). The first requirement seems\nparticularly odious once generality is exposed as a myth covering the\nmajority\u2019s culture and conventions. The call to transcend\nparticularity too often translates into the imposition of the majority\nperspective on minorities. The second requirement may produce more\ninequality rather than less since the purported neutrality of\ndifference-blind institutions often belies an implicit bias towards\nthe needs, interests and identities of the majority group. This bias\noften creates specific burdens for members of minorities, i.e. more\ninequality.\n\nCritics of this (failed) universalism have proposed an alternative\nconception of citizenship based on the acknowledgment of the political\nrelevance of difference (cultural, gender, class, race, etc.). This\nmeans, first, the recognition of the pluralist character of the\ndemocratic public, composed of many perspectives, none of which should\nbe considered a priori more legitimate. Second, it entails\nthat, in certain cases at least, equal respect may justify\ndifferential treatment and the recognition of special minority\nrights.\n\nOnce these two points are conceded, the question becomes when, and for\nwhat reason, the recognition of particular rights is either justified\nor illegitimate. This discussion is necessarily context specific,\nfocusing on concrete demands made by groups in particular\ncircumstances, and shies away from easy generalizations. It has led to\nan array of publications covering issues ranging from the fate of\n\u2018minorities within minorities\u2019 to how tolerant liberal\nsocieties should be of illiberal groups,\n etc.[7]\n\nThe model of differentiated citizenship has generated its own share of\ncriticisms and queries, particularly with regards to the overall\neffects of its implementation. Critics focus on its impact on the\npossibility of a common political practice. Consider Iris\nYoung\u2019s vision of a heterogeneous public where participants\nstart from their \u201csituated positions\u201d and attempt to\nconstruct a dialogue across differences. This dialogue requires\nparticipants to be \u2018public-spirited\u2019 \u2014 open to the\nclaims of others and not single-mindedly self-interested. Unlike\ninterest group pluralism, which does not require justifying\none\u2019s interest as right or as compatible with social justice,\nparticipants are supposed to use deliberation to come to a decision\nthat they determine to be best or more just (Young 1989, 267). While\nwelcoming Young\u2019s conception of the democratic public, one may\ndoubt that the policies and institutions associated with a\ndifferentiated model of citizenship would either motivate or enable\ncitizens to engage in such dialogue.\n\nThis analysis is tied to a wider literature on the virtues required of\ncitizens in pluralist liberal democracies and on ways to favour their\ndevelopment. Stephen Macedo (1990), William Galston (1991), and Eamonn\nCallan (1997), among others, have all emphasized the importance of\npublic reasonableness. This virtue is defined as the ability to listen\nto others and formulate one\u2019s own position in a way that is\nsensitive to, and respectful of, the different experiences and\nidentities of fellow citizens, acknowledging that these differences\nmay affect political views. This raises many questions: how and where\ndoes one develop this and related virtue(s)? If a differentiated model\nof citizenship simply allows individuals and groups to retreat into\ntheir particular enclaves, how are they to develop either the\nmotivation or the capacity to participate in a common forum?\n\nThis explains the abiding interest of political philosophers in\neducation. If citizens of diverse societies are to develop the\n\u2018right\u2019 attitudes and dispositions, does this mean\nencouraging a common education, the development of a school curriculum\nthat teaches respect for difference, while providing the necessary\nskills for democratic discussion across these differences? In this\ncase, should demands for separate schools or dispensations for\nminorities be resisted? How flexible should public schools be towards\nminorities if the goal is to make them feel welcome and ensure that\nthey do not retreat into parochial institutions (Callan 1997; Gutmann\n1999; Brighouse 2000,\n 2006)?[8]\n\nCritics of differentiated citizenship have also argued that policies\nthat break with difference-blind universalism weaken the integrative\nfunction of citizenship. If embracing multicultural and minority\nrights means that citizens lose their sense of collective belonging,\nit may also affect their willingness to compromise and make sacrifices\nfor each other. Citizens may then develop a purely strategic attitude\ntowards those of different backgrounds. As Joseph Carens puts it:\n\u201cFrom this perspective, the danger of [\u2026] differentiated\ncitizenship is that the emphasis [it] place[s] on the recognition and\ninstitutionalization of difference could undermine the conditions that\nmake a sense of common identification and thus mutuality\npossible\u201d (Carens 2000, 193).\n\nIn addressing these and similar queries, Will Kymlicka and Wayne\nNorman have broadly distinguished between three types of demands:\nspecial representation rights (for disadvantaged groups),\nmulticultural rights (for immigrant and religious groups) and\nself-government rights (for national minorities) (Kymlicka and Norman\n1994; Kymlicka, 1995, 176\u2013187). The first two are really demands\nfor inclusion into mainstream society: special representation rights\nare best understood as (temporary) measures to alleviate the obstacles\nthat minorities and/or historically disadvantaged groups face in\nhaving their voices heard in majoritarian democratic institutions.\nReforming the electoral system to ensure the better representation of\nminorities may raise all sorts of difficult issues, but the aim is\nclearly integration into the larger political society, not\nisolation.\n\nSimilarly, the demands for multicultural rights made by immigrant\ngroups are usually aimed either at exemption from laws and policies\nthat disadvantage them because of their religious practices or at\nensuring public support for particular education and/or cultural\ninitiatives to maintain and transmit elements of their cultural and\nreligious heritage. These should be seen as measures designed to\nfacilitate their inclusion in the larger society rather than as a way\nto avoid integration. It is only claims to self-government rights,\ngrounded in a principle of self-determination, that potentially\nendanger civic integration since their aim is not to achieve a greater\npresence in the institutions of the central government, but to gain a\ngreater share of power and legislative jurisdiction for institutions\ncontrolled by national minorities.\n\nAddressing this kind of demand through a simple reaffirmation of the\nideal of common citizenship is not a serious option. It may only\naggravate the alienation felt by members of these groups and feed into\nmore radical political projects, including secession. Further, to say\nthat recognition of self-government rights may weaken the bonds of the\nlarger community is to suppose that these bonds exist in the first\nplace and that a significant proportion of national minorities\nidentify with the larger society. This may be overly optimistic. If\nthese bonds do not exist, or remain quite weak, what is needed is the\nconstruction of a genuine dialogue between the majority society and\nminorities over what constitutes just relations, through which\ndifference can be recognized. The hope is that dialogue would\nstrengthen, rather than weaken, their relationship by putting it on\nfirmer moral and political grounds (Carens 2000, 197).\n\nThis broadly positive assessment of the effects of differentiated\ncitizenship on civic integration is contested. On the one hand,\nleft-leaning authors have complained that multicultural politics make\negalitarian policies more difficult to achieve by diverting\n\u201cpolitical effort away from universalistic goals\u201d and by\nundermining efforts to build a broadly based coalition supporting\nambitious policies of redistribution (Barry 2001, 325). On the other\nhand, events like September 11, the Mohammed cartoons affair (2005,\nsee Klausen 2009), riots in the banlieux of Paris (2005),\nLondon (2011) and Stockholm (2017), as well as a series of terrorist\nattacks in Europe have led to a backlash against multicultural\npolicies. The belief that demands for multicultural rights are really\ndemands for inclusion in the larger society has been thrown into\ndoubt, notably in the case of Muslim immigrants.\n\nTo allay fears about the supposed trade-off between cultural\nrecognition and redistribution, supporters of multiculturalism cite\nthe lack of empirical studies establishing a negative correlation\nbetween the adoption of multicultural policies and a robust welfare\nstate (Banting and Kymlicka 2006, Banting 2005). Further, claims that\nthe push for multicultural policies diverts energies, time and\nresources from the struggle for redistributive policies assume that\nthe pursuit of justice is zero-sum, seemingly a false generalization.\nOn the contrary, it can be argued that: \u201cthe pursuit of justice\nin one dimension helps build a broader political culture that supports\nstruggles for justice in other dimensions\u201d (Kymlicka 2009). In\nthe same vein, to claim that paying attention to issues of cultural\nrecognition tends to warp our sensitivity to economic injustice is to\nassume that we can only be sensitive to one dimension of injustice at\na time. However, it is equally plausible that sensitivity to a\nparticular type of injustice may favour, rather than hinder,\nsensitivity to other injustices.\n\nIn response to concerns about social and civic unity, liberal\ndemocracies have introduced a series of policies aimed at better\nsecuring the integration of immigrants: requiring minimal linguistic\nproficiency in the majority language as a condition of citizenship or\nbanning religious symbols from public schools. These policies have\nsometimes been heralded as signaling the development of a\n\u2018muscular liberalism\u2019 (Former British PM David Cameron,\nquoted by Joppke 2014) as an alternative to multiculturalism. They\nhave been hotly debated from the perspective of factual efficacy as\nwell as from a normative perspective. The introduction of\n\u2018citizenship tests\u2019 for resident immigrants has led to a\nvigorous debate among normative theorists: under what conditions and\nin what form can they be justified? Some, like Carens (2010a), have\nargued that they are basically unjust, no matter what form they take.\nIf one understands membership in a society to flow from long-term\nresidence, as Carens does, then any test that \u201cprevents a full\nmember of a society from becoming a citizen unjustly deprives her of\nan entitlement to citizenship\u201d (Mason 2014, 143). Other\ntheorists have taken a more positive view of the tests: seeing them as\nan incentive for immigrants to acquire basic knowledge of\nliberal-democratic principles, as well as the political institutions\nand history of the host country. As such, they also serve as an\n\u201cimplicit statement of the nation\u2019s political\nvalues\u201d (Miller 2016, 138). On this view, as long as certain\nconditions are met, so that the tests are neither too difficult nor\ntoo expensive and give applicants the possibility to take them again\nif they fail, etc., then there is nothing deeply objectionable to them\n(though the empirical question of their efficacy remains open). In\ncontrast, tests that purport to \u2018weed out\u2019 immigrants who\ndo not share \u2018our\u2019 liberal values are generally held to be\nincompatible with liberal principles. This has led some theorists to\nquestion how \u2018muscular\u2019 can liberalism really be (Joppke\n2014).\n\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, some liberal\ndemocracies have introduced legislation giving the state the power to\nrevoke the citizenship of those convicted or suspected of terrorist\n activities.[9]\n Given the principle recognized in international law that no one\nshould be left stateless, these legislations usually apply only to\ncitizens holding dual or multiple citizenships.\n\u2018Denationalisation\u2019 is sometimes described in this context\nas \u201ca technique for extending the functionality of immigration\nlaw in counter-terrorism\u201d (Macklin 2015, see also Barry and\nFerracioli 2016). Though states cannot deport their own citizens,\ndenationalisation allows them to first withdraw citizenship and then\ndeport. These legislations raise several normative issues. Firstly,\nthey seem to contradict the basic idea that citizenship is a\nfundamental right, not a privilege (Lenard 2018; Gibney 2013; Macklin\n2015). Secondly, since they weaken the security normally attached to\nthe status of citizen, they can be described as demoting citizenship\n\u201cto another category of permanent residence\u201d (Macklin\n2015). Thirdly, it is argued that by targeting only dual (or multiple)\ncitizens, the new legislations treat them as second-class citizens\n(Gibney 2013, 653). In contrast, other theorists insist that that the\nnature of terrorist crimes (akin to acts of war against the state)\nwarrants this kind of response (Schuck 2015; Joppke 2015). Concerning\nthe worry that the legislations discriminate against dual citizens,\nthe response is that the difference in treatment between mono-citizens\nand dual citizens is justified since the consequences of\ndenationalisation are also very different in each case. Individuals\nholding a single citizenship are the only ones facing statelessness as\na consequence of denationalisation (Barry and Ferracioli 2016). Where\nparticipants in the debate find some common ground is in their shared\ncriticism of the specific form that some legislations have taken, most\nnotably the 2006 British Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act. In\nthe wake of the 7 July 2005 Tube bombing in London, the Act replaced\nthe standard for deprivation present in the 2002 legislation (the\n\u201cvital interests of the state\u201d test) with a much weaker\nand vague standard providing for revocation in cases where an\nindividual\u2019s holding citizenship is \u201cnot conducive to the\npublic good\u201d (quoted by Gibney 2013, 650). Also deeply\nconcerning is the progressive expansion of legislative measures to\nallow for \u201cproactive and administrative\ndenationalisation\u201d (Brown Prener 2023, 3\u20134). While the\nefficiency of denationalisation as a measure aimed at reducing the\nincidence of terrorist activity remains doubtful, its value appears to\nbe primarily symbolic, expressing what some authors see as a\n\u2018fitting\u2019 response of liberal democracies to those intent\non attacking their very foundations (Barry and Ferracioli 2016; see\nLenard 2018 for a counterargument). This symbolic understanding of\ndenationalisation highlights the persistent significance of the\nlanguage of allegiance in contemporary liberal democratic thought,\nthough some argue that this very language is incompatible with liberal\ndemocratic principles (Irving 2022).\n\nWorries about the integration of Muslim immigrants in Western liberal\ndemocracies have fostered a persisting interest in the complex\nrelations between the liberal political cultures dominant in the West,\nthe different versions of secularism that they affirm, religion, and\ncitizens of faith. Research has focused on religion\u2019s place in\nthe public sphere (Parekh 2006, Laborde 2008, Brahm Levey and Modood\n2009, Modood 2019) as well as on the relation between religion,\ngender, and\n citizenship.[10]\n2.2 Liberal nationalists vs postnationalists\n\nThe debate between supporters and critics of differentiated\ncitizenship centres on the model\u2019s supposed effect on civic\nintegration. It is assumed that democratic citizenship, properly\nconstrued, can indeed function as a significant lever for integration.\nThe idea is that citizenship as a set of civil, political and social\nrights and as a political practice can help generate desirable\nfeelings of identity and belonging. This statement hides significant\ndisagreement over how to characterize the relation between citizenship\nand nationality. Some consider that citizenship\u2019s capacity to\nfulfil its integrative function depends on, and feeds upon, the prior\nexistence of a common nationality while others counter that, under\nconditions of pluralism, nationality cannot function as a suitable\nfocus of allegiance and identity. The collective identity of modern\ndemocratic states should rather be based upon more abstract and\nuniversalistic political and legal principles that transcend cultural\ndifference. This debate brings to the fore differing assessments of\nthe role that citizenship can play in contemporary societies\ncharacterized by a high degree of complexity and internal\ndiversity.\n\nLiberal nationalists like David Miller have argued that only specific\nforms of political practice can produce high levels of trust and\nloyalty between citizens (Miller 2000, 87). The political activities\nof the citizens of Athens or of Rousseau\u2019s ideal Republic\npresumed face-to-face relations of cooperation that favour the growth\nof such sentiments. The scale and complexity of modern states have\nmade the kind of political practice envisaged by Rousseau and\ndescribed by Aristotle at best marginal. Citizens do not meet under an\noak tree to formulate the laws; they are basically strangers and\ncitizens\u2019 involvement in the politics of representative\ndemocracies is episodic and diluted. Politics in this context cannot\nbe expected to play a central role in most individuals\u2019 lives;\nsomething else must generate the trust and loyalty necessary to the\nfunctioning of a political community. Historically, it is the nation\nthat has allowed large numbers of individuals to feel a sense of\ncommonality, setting them apart from others and making solidarity\namong strangers possible.\n\nPostnationalists do not dispute the key role played by the nation in\nmaking republican politics possible in large modern states. They agree\nthat reference to a common nationality allowed the political\nmobilization of their inhabitants, calling on their shared descent,\nhistory, or language. However, democracy\u2019s association with the\nnation-state is contingent rather than necessary. Democratic politics\ncan, in principle, free itself from its historical moorings.\nPostnationalists claim that this dissociation is not only possible,\nbut necessary for moral and pragmatic reasons (Habermas 1998,\n132).\n\nOn the one hand, the historical balance sheet of the nation-state\nreveals a legacy of oppression of minority cultures within and\ncultural, political, and economic imperialism outside its borders. On\nthe other hand, the acknowledgment of the nation-state\u2019s\n(growing) internal diversity and sensitivity to the injustice of\nforced assimilation undermine its ability to continue playing the role\nit fulfilled in the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies. Imposing the majority culture upon minorities may simply\nmake it more difficult for them to identify with the nation-state and\nweaken its legitimacy.\n\nIn conditions of pluralism, therefore, the majority culture cannot\nserve as the grounding of a shared identity. It must be replaced by\nuniversalistic principles of human rights and the rule of law, which\ndo not, it is argued, imply the imposition of a particular majority\nculture on minorities. Each political community develops distinctive\ninterpretations of the meaning of these principles over time, which\nbecome embodied in its political and legal institutions and practices.\nThese in turn form a political culture that crystallizes around the\ncountry\u2019s constitution and makes those principles into a\n\u2018concrete universal\u2019. This embedding of democratic and\nliberal principles in a distinctive political culture can, in turn,\ngive rise to what J\u00fcrgen Habermas has called a\n\u201cconstitutional patriotism\u201d, which should replace\nnationalism as the focus of a common identity. In countries that have\nachieved a strong national consciousness, the political culture has\nlong been entangled with the majority culture. This\n\u201cfusion\u201d, argues Habermas, \u201cmust be dissolved if it\nis to be possible for different cultural, ethnic, and religious forms\nof life to coexist and interact on equal terms within the\nsame political community\u201d (Habermas 1998, 118).\n\nThe thrust of the argument is that democratic political practice can\nprovide a sufficient stimulus to integration in complex democratic\nsocieties and is indeed the only one properly available to them. There\nis no need for a background consensus based on cultural homogeneity to\nact as a \u2018catalyzing condition\u2019 for democracy to the\nextent that the democratic political process, involving public\ndeliberation and decision-making, makes \u201ca reasonable political\nunderstanding possible, even among strangers.\u201d Democracy, as a\nset of procedures, can secure legitimacy in the absence of more\nsubstantive commonalities between citizens and achieve social\nintegration. Since it is not wedded to particular cultural premises,\nit can be responsive to changes in the cultural composition of the\ncitizenry and generate a common political culture (Habermas 2001a,\n73\u201374). Habermas\u2019s position, then, gives pride of place to\nthe democratic process and to the political participation of citizens,\nwhich play a key role in securing social integration: \u201cIn\ncomplex societies, it is the deliberative opinion- and will-formation\nof citizens, grounded in the principles of popular sovereignty, that\nforms the ultimate medium for a form of abstract, legally constructed\nsolidarity that reproduces itself through political\nparticipation\u201d (Habermas 2001a, 76).\n\nHowever, the democratic process can fulfil its role only if it\nachieves a certain level of output legitimacy: appropriate levels of\nsolidarity are sustainable only if basic standards of social justice\nare satisfied (Habermas 2001a, 76). If it is to remain a source of\nsolidarity, citizenship must be seen as a valuable status, associated\nnot only with civil and political rights, but also with the fulfilment\nof fundamental social and cultural rights (Habermas 1998,\n118\u2013119).\n\nFor most liberal nationalists, this seems like putting the cart before\nthe horse since a successful welfare state, they argue, is possible\nonly if citizens already enjoy high levels of mutual trust and\nloyalty. Welfare policies suppose that we make sacrifices for\nanonymous others who differ from us in terms of their ethnic origin,\nreligion, and way of life. But in democracies, redistributive policies\ncan be sustained only if they enjoy strong levels of public support.\nThis support is dependent on a sense of common identity that\ntranscends difference and motivates citizens to share their revenues\nwith people whom they do not know, but to whom they feel related by\ncommon bonds. This sentiment implies reciprocity: the expectation\nthat, in times of need, one could also benefit from the solidarity of\nfellow citizens (Miller, 1995; Canovan, 1996).\n\nLiberal nationalists and other critics of the postnationalist position\ngo on to argue that freeing the liberal democratic state from its\nhistorical moorings is neither possible, nor necessary. They recognize\nthat the link between liberal democracy and the nation is historically\ncontingent rather than necessary or conceptual while adding that this\ndoes not mean that they can or should be dissociated (Miller 1995,\n29\u201330; Kymlicka 2003). Calling for the separation of a\ncountry\u2019s political culture from the majority group\u2019s\nculture is easier said than done. While it may be comparably easy to\ndiscard the most egregious forms of fusion, if there is the political\nwill to do so (for instance, by de-establishing the Anglican church in\nthe case of England), any political culture will be ethically\npatterned in ways that are difficult for members of the majority to\nappreciate. Expressions such as \u201ccutting the umbilical\ncord\u201d or \u201cdissolving\u201d the fusion overstate the\nextent to which a political culture may be disengaged from the\nbackground culture. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, it is\nargued, since the nation need not be construed in ways that exclude\nminorities. Nationhood can be understood in sufficiently\n\u2018thin\u2019 terms to accommodate minorities while being\n\u2018thick\u2019 enough to generate appropriate sentiments of\nsolidarity, loyalty, and trust.\n\nThere are different versions of this thin understanding of nationhood.\nWhat they share is the downplaying of substantive commonalities of\ndescent, culture and religion in favour of political and legal\nprinciples and institutions as well as a description of national\nidentity as flexible and open to change\n .[11]\n Once immigrants are citizens, they can participate in the collective\nconversation in which citizens debate and constantly reinterpret the\nnation\u2019s identity. What immigrants are required to display is a\n\u201cwillingness to accept current political structures and to\nengage with the host community so that a new common identity can be\nforged\u201d (Miller 1995, 129). They are expected \u201cto speak a\ncommon national language\u201d, \u201cfeel loyalty to national\ninstitutions\u201d and \u201cshare a commitment to maintaining the\nnation as a single, self-governing community into the indefinite\nfuture\u201d (Kymlicka 2003, 273).\n\nGiven the thin version of national identity they propose, one might\nconclude that liberal nationalists are not that far from the\nconstitutional patriotism of Habermas. After all, both positions seem\nto give the central role to a common political culture. The distance\nseparating them becomes clear when we look at the political\nimplications of their respective views, like when evaluating the\nprospects of the European Union. Liberal nationalists are often\nsceptical towards the European experiment while postnationalists are\nfirm\n supporters.[12]\n This difference flows from their respective conceptions of what makes\nand sustains a political culture as a source of integration. For\nliberal nationalists, continuity is essential: a political culture\nderives much of its strength from an anchoring in the history and\nnarrative of a distinct political community extending backwards and\nforwards in time. They are sceptical of political voluntarism and of\nwhat can be achieved through formal political institutions. Democratic\nprocedures alone, divorced from a richer background, can neither\ngenerate nor sustain a robust political culture or a sense of common\nidentity.\n\nIn contrast, postnationalists like Habermas consider that the\ndemocratic process is crucial. The postnationalist conception gives\ngreater weight to political practice and to the legal and political\ninstitutions that sustain it rather than to their cultural and\nhistorical moorings. This explains Habermas\u2019s militant support\nof the European project and his belief that adopting a constitution\ncould have a \u201ccatalytic effect\u201d on the process of\nconstructing a \u2018more perfect Union\u2019 (Habermas 2001b,\n16).\n3. The challenge of globalisation\n\nFor the better part of the last century, conceptions of citizenship,\ndespite many differences, have had one thing in common: the idea that\nthe necessary framework for citizenship is the sovereign, territorial\nstate. The legal status of citizen is essentially the formal\nexpression of membership in a polity that has definite territorial\nboundaries within which citizens enjoy equal rights and exercise their\npolitical agency. In other words, citizenship, both as a legal status\nand as an activity, is thought to presuppose the existence of a\nterritorially bounded political community, which extends over time and\nis the focus of a common identity. In the last thirty years, this\npremise has come under scrutiny. A host of phenomena, loosely\nassociated under the heading \u2018globalisation\u2019, have\nencouraged this critical awakening: exploding transnational economic\nexchange, competition and communication as well as high levels of\nmigration, of cultural and social interactions have shown how porous\nthose borders have become and led people to contest the relevance and\nlegitimacy of state sovereignty.\n\nThree questions are particularly salient. First, the intensification\nof migratory movements from poorer to richer countries in the context\nof growing inequalities between North and South has led some authors\nto contest the state\u2019s moral right to choose its members by\nselectively closing its borders. Second, what R. Baub\u00f6ck calls\nthe \u201cmismatch between citizenship and the territorial scope of\nlegitimate authority\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 31) has prompted a\ngrowing questioning of the acceptability of the different rights\naccorded to citizens and non-citizens living within the same state.\nDoes contesting the tight association between the territorial state,\ncitizenship, and rights risks weakening the very institutional\nframework that makes citizenship a meaningful practice? This question\nraises a third set of issues as it assumes that the democratic\nnation-state is the only institutional context in which citizenship\ncan thrive. This is contested by those who claim that citizenship can\nbe exercised in a multiplicity of \u2018sites\u2019 both below and\nabove the nation-state.\n3.1 Citizenship and borders\n\nDoes the state have the moral right to decide who can become a citizen\nor is there a fundamental right to free movement? The philosophical\ndebate has largely focused on two issues: first, on the nature of\nobligations that wealthy states have towards people from impoverished\ncountries who seek better lives for themselves and their families;\nsecondly, on the moral status of political communities and their\nsupposed right to protect their integrity by excluding\nnon-members.\n\nOne way of characterizing one\u2019s obligations towards strangers is\nto insist that, absent any relations of cooperation, common humanity\nis our only bond. Only a weak, imperfect or conditional duty of\nassistance, it is argued, can be inferred from this premise. This duty\nlimits the basic right of a political community to distribute\nmembership as it wishes without, in any way, displacing it.\nIndividuals have a duty to assist strangers in urgent need if they can\nhelp without exposing themselves to significant risk or cost. At a\ncollective level, the implications are more considerable as political\ncommunities have greater resources and can consider a broader range of\nbenevolent actions at comparably negligible cost. The principle of\nmutual aid may justify redistribution of membership, territory, wealth\nand resources to the extent that certain states have more than they\ncan reasonably be said to need (Walzer 1983, 47). However, in this\nframework redistributive policies remain entirely dependent on\nwealthier countries\u2019 understanding of their needs and of the\nurgency of a stranger\u2019s situation. There is no obligation to\ngive equal weight to the interests of non-members.\n\nInstitutionally, this position supports what the Geneva Convention on\nthe Status of Refugees (United Nations 1951) calls the principle of\n\u201cnon refoulement\u201d: signatory states are not to\ndeport refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin if\nthis threatens their lives and freedom. It can also support claims in\nfavour of increasing the number of immigrants admitted into richer\ncountries, depending on how the latter evaluate the potential effects\non their own interests.\n\nCritics contend that obligations towards migrants and asylum-seekers\ngo well beyond this and call for a policy of open borders and/or deny\nthe state\u2019s right to decide alone who exactly, and how many\npeople, may enter its territory. Three basic strategies are employed:\nthe first consists of arguing that freedom of movement is a\nfundamental human right. For example, some have argued that any theory\nrecognizing the equal moral value of individuals and giving them moral\nprimacy over communities cannot justify rejecting aliens\u2019 claims\nto admission and citizenship. As Carens demonstrated in an early\narticle, this argument applies to the three main strands of\ncontemporary liberal theory: libertarianism (\u00e0 la\nNozick), Rawlsianism and utilitarianism (Carens 1987). If the\nprinciple of moral equality is given its full extension, the\ndistinction between citizen and alien appears as morally arbitrary,\njustified neither by nature nor achievement. When evaluating border\nand immigration policies, the equal consideration of the interests of\nall affected (be they aliens or citizens) is required. Political\ncommunities cannot decide whether they can afford to accept refugee\nclaimants or prospective immigrants simply according to their\nunderstanding of their own situation, needs and interests.\nConsideration of consequences (e.g. in terms of public order, the\nsustainability of welfare policies, the potential effects of a brain\ndrain in developing countries, etc.) is not prohibited; what changes\nradically is how we are to evaluate them. Institutionally, this would\ndoubtless lead to substantial changes in the immigration and refugee\npolicies of most Western democracies.\n\nA second strategy advocated by Arash Abizadeh (2008) relies on the\nprinciple of democratic legitimacy, holding that the exercise of\ncoercive power is legitimate \u201conly insofar as it is actually\njustified by and to the very people over whom it is\nexercised\u201d (41). Since a regime of border control subjects both\ncitizens and non-citizens to the state\u2019s coercive use of power,\n\u201cthe justification for a particular regime of border control is\nowed not just to those whom the boundary marks as members, but to\nnonmembers as well\u201d\n (45)[13].\n The argument\u2019s upshot is that no democratic state has the right\nto unilaterally control its own borders, but must either allow freedom\nof movement or, at the very least, give voice to prospective\nimmigrants when formulating border policy. The latter condition would\nitself lead to significant changes in immigration policies in the\nWestern world, since jointly controlled borders would presumably be\nmore porous as well.\n\nThe third strategy is less direct. To the extent that states do not\nsatisfy their moral obligations to guarantee the universal human right\nto security and subsistence through international redistributive\npolicies, they have a moral obligation to admit those wishing to\nenter. Here the idea of open borders is an instrumental, rather than\nintrinsic, moral principle: it is a means towards achieving global\ndistributive justice (Bader 1997). The advantage of this line of\nargument is that it closely reflects a central motivation for open\nborders: the outrage provoked by the huge inequalities between North\nand South and rich countries\u2019 role in perpetuating this\nsituation. This strategy, if successful, would establish specific\nrights for people from poorer countries towards the North, rather than\na broadly framed right to free movement, to be \u2018equally\u2019\nenjoyed by individuals of rich and poor countries alike.\n\nTo be convincing the argument must show: first, that severe global\npoverty requires immediate action; second, that it is a matter of\njustice, not charity. To that effect, it is crucial to show that the\nextreme poverty of some countries is not simply the result of\nendogenous factors (e.g. bad governance; corrupt political culture,\netc.), but is linked to a global political and economic order that\nsystematically produces an unjust distribution of resources and\npolitical power, which rich northern countries, as its main\nbeneficiaries, are in no hurry to\n reform.[14]\n The third step in this argument purportedly shows that justifications\nof restrictive immigration policies premised on ethico-political\nclaims lose much of their force in the context of profound\ninternational inequalities and injustice. Proponents claim that\nregulating immigration to preserve the integrity of the political\ncommunity is a legitimate goal only if duties of international\ndistributive justice are satisfied (Tan 2004, 126, referring to Tamir\n1992, 161). The argument\u2019s upshot is that \u201c[r]ich Northern\nstates have a double moral obligation to seriously fight global\npoverty and to let more people in\u201d (Bader 1997, 31).\n\nMost supporters and critics of (more) open borders agree that liberal\ndemocratic states have a moral status and are worth\n preserving.[15]\n They disagree over what exactly is worthy of protection and how much\nweight should be given to securing their integrity (however it is\ndefined) relative to duties of international justice.\n\nThe division of the world into states is arguably justifiable on\nfunctional grounds, to the extent that states appear as \u201cfirst\napproximations of optimal units for allocating and producing the\nworld\u2019s resources\u201d (Coleman and Harding 1995, 38). If we\nthink that states matter simply as local units of efficient production\nand distribution, then this would be the main consideration when\nevaluating immigration policies. Public order arguments would still\nmatter, likewise claims pertaining to a society\u2019s basic capacity\nto secure its material reproduction, but not arguments relating to its\ncultural integrity or way of life. Unless, of course, the capacity of\nstates to act as efficient units of production and distribution is\nlinked to their being distinctive political communities with a\nparticular culture of shared meanings worth preserving.\n\nSome forty years ago, Michael Walzer defended this view, based on the\nidea that \u201cdistributive justice presupposes a bounded world\nwithin which distribution takes place\u201d (Walzer 1983, 31). Since\nthe goods to be divided, exchanged and shared among individuals have\nsocial meanings that are specific to particular communities, it is\nonly within their boundaries that conflict can be resolved and\ndistributive schemes judged either just or unjust. The crucial\nassumption here is that the \u201cpolitical community is probably the\nclosest we can come to a world of common meanings. Language, history,\nand culture come together [\u2026] to produce a collective\nconsciousness\u201d (Walzer 1983, 28). Politics itself, moreover, as\na set of practices and institutions that shape the form and outcome\nthat distributive conflicts take, \u201cestablishes its own bonds of\ncommonality\u201d (Walzer 1983, 29). To reject political\ncommunities\u2019 right to distribute the good of membership is to\nundermine their capacity to preserve their integrity as\n\u201ccommunities of character\u201d. It is to condemn them to\nbecome nothing more than neighbourhoods, random associations lacking\nany legally enforceable admissions policies. The probable result of\nthe free movement of individuals would be \u201ccasual\naggregates\u201d devoid of any internal cohesion and incapable of\nbeing a source of patriotic sentiments and solidarity. In a world of\nneighbourhoods, membership would become meaningless. The upshot is\nthat the political community\u2019s right to regulate admission\nshould be recognized to secure its cultural, economic and political\nintegrity.\n\nWalzer\u2019s position, notably his choice of analogies, has been\nextensively\n discussed.[16]\n His assumption that sovereign states constitute communities of shared\nmeanings appears particularly shaky. Most often, existing states\nincorporate various political communities that are themselves\ninternally pluralistic: linguistically, culturally and ideologically.\nOne would be hard pressed to identify the community whose integrity is\nat stake. Indeed, few states correspond to the picture Walzer\nenvisages as the appropriate context for distributive justice.\n\nBecause it is premised on a thinner conception of the political\ncommunity, liberal nationalists may be able to offer a similar account\nof the state\u2019s right to control its borders that may be less\nvulnerable to this kind of criticism. David Miller, for instance,\nargues that liberal democratic states \u201crequire a common public\nculture that in part constitutes the political identity of their\nmembers, and that serves valuable functions in supporting democracy\nand other social goals\u201d (Miller 2014, 369). A society\u2019s\npublic culture provides its citizens, their diverse identities and\nways of life notwithstanding (i.e. what Miller calls their private\nculture), with shared reference points (e.g. an overlapping set of\nbeliefs about the kind of political system they want to live in,\nsocial norms about how to behave in the public space, etc.) that\nenable them to confront their society\u2019s challenges. The public\nculture also acts as a bridge between the society\u2019s past, its\npresent, and its future. It plays a key role in securing the kind of\ntrust between citizens and towards political institutions that is\nessential for the provision of public goods and for supporting\npolicies involving economic redistribution. \u201cWhere trust is\nlacking\u201d, writes Miller, \u201cdeliberation is likely to be\nreplaced by self-interested bargaining on the part of each group,\nwhere the outcome reflects the balance of power between them\u201d\n(Miller 2016, 64). Citizens of liberal democratic states have a\nlegitimate interest in preserving their public culture. This includes\nthe capacity to decide the scale and type of immigration allowed in\nthe country in order to regulate the changes that the common public\nculture may experience because of new arrivals. According to Miller,\nthe concern here is not about diversity, but \u201cabout areas in\nwhich private culture and public culture intersect \u2013 in which it\nbecomes harder to reach agreement on public matters because people\napproach them on the basis of conflicting and privately held beliefs\nand values\u201d (Miller 2016, 68).\n\nMiller\u2019s argument has been widely discussed over the years\n(Carens 2013; Stilz 2022; Wellman 2008, 2022). His account of the\ncommon public culture has been described as unstable and unrealistic.\nAnna Stilz claims, for instance, that the internal diversity of\nliberal states is such \u201cthat it may be impossible to pick out\nany single \u2018common public culture\u2019, a[ny] set of\nunderstandings about how their collective life should be led\u201d\n(Stilz 2022, 13).\n\nSome theorists try to defend the state\u2019s right to\nself-determination \u2013 including the right to restrict immigration\n\u2013 without making any reference to the (common public) culture of\nthe political community. Chritopher Heath Wellman has argued that this\ncan be done by focusing on freedom of association as an integral part\nof self-determination (Wellman 2008, 2012; see also Ferracioli 2022).\nSince \u201cfreedom of association includes a right to reject a\npotential association and (often) a right to dissociate\u201d\n(Wellman 2008, 110), liberal democratic states \u2013 or legitimate\nstates \u2013 have a presumptive right to exclude immigrants:\n\u201cit does not matter how culturally diverse or homogeneous a\ncountry\u2019s citizens are; if they are collectively able and\nwilling to perform the requisite political function of adequately\nprotecting and preserving human rights, then they are entitled to\npolitical self-determination\u201d (Wellman 2012, 52). The\npresumptive right to exclude does not cancel duties of international\ndistributive justice. It means that \u201cwhatever duties of\ndistributive justice wealthy states have to those abroad, they need\nnot be paid in the currency of open borders\u201d (Wellman 2012,\n 66).[17]\n\nNone of the authors involved in this debate consider that the current\nlevels of global inequality are morally acceptable or that prosperous\nliberal democratic states are doing enough to discharge their duties\nof international justice. Those who defend the state\u2019s right to\nexclude, like Wellman, recognize that \u201caffluent societies must\ndramatically relax their severe limits on immigration if they are\nunwilling to provide sufficient assistance in other ways\u201d\n(Wellman 2012, 77; see also Miller 2014, 368). As Kok-Chor Tan has\nremarked, \u201cthe national projects of well-off nations lose their\nlegitimacy if these nations are not also doing their fair share as\ndetermined by their duties of justice\u201d (Tan 2004, 129; see also\nBrock\n 2020).[18]\n Whether liberals should concentrate on reforming the international\nsystem or fight for both greater international distributive justice\nand more open borders remains open for debate. The two prescriptions\nare by no means incompatible: insisting on the illegitimacy of\nrestrictive immigration policies under current conditions is also a\nway of putting rich countries on the spot and of prodding them to\naccept their moral responsibilities towards the world\u2019s poor\n(Goodin 1992, 8).\n3.2 Citizens, non-citizens, and rights\n\nShould one infer from the preceding discussion that citizenship is\n\u201chard on the outside and soft on the inside\u201d (Bosniak\n2006, 4) with the border representing a firm line between those who\nare part of the community of equal citizens and those who remain\noutside? The short answer is no. International migration produces what\nBaub\u00f6ck calls a \u201cmismatch between citizenship and the\nterritorial scope of legitimate authority\u201d with \u201ccitizens\nliving outside the country whose government is supposed to be\naccountable to them and inside a country whose government is not\naccountable to them\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 31). To resident aliens\nwho live within a specific community of citizens, the border is not\nsomething they have left behind, it effectively follows them inside\nthe state, denying them many of the rights enjoyed by full citizens or\nmaking their enjoyment less secure (Bosniak 2006).\n\nOne way to address this mismatch is to reconsider how entitlement to\ncitizenship is determined. In a world characterized by significant\nlevels of migration across states, birthright citizenship \u2014\nacquired either through descent (jus sanguinis) or birth in\nthe territory (jus soli) \u2014 may lead to counterintuitive\nresults: while a regime of pure jus sanguinis systematically\nexcludes immigrants and their children, though the latter may be born\nand bred in their parents\u2019 new home, it includes descendants of\nexpatriates who may never have set foot in their forebears\u2019\nhomeland. On the other hand, a regime of jus soli may\nattribute citizenship to children whose birth in the territory is\naccidental while denying it to those children who have arrived in the\ncountry at a very young age.\n\nThe stakeholder principle (or jus nexi) is proposed as an\nalternative (or a supplement) to birthright citizenship: individuals\nwho have a \u201creal and effective link\u201d (Shachar 2009, 165)\nto the political community, or a \u201cpermanent interest in\nmembership\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 35) should be entitled to claim\ncitizenship. This new criterion aims at securing citizenship for those\nwho are truly members of the political community, in the sense that\ntheir life prospects depend on the country\u2019s laws and policy\nchoices.\n\nIf the stakeholder principle alleviates the mismatch, it does not\nquestion the tight association between rights, citizenship, territory,\nand authority. For some, it is precisely this association that should\nbe questioned since it contradicts the increasing fluidity of the\nrelations between individuals and polities in a globalized world. This\ncontext is thought to necessitate more than a friendly amendment to\ncurrent principles of citizenship allocation: it requires the\ndisaggregation of rights, commonly associated with citizenship, from\nthe legal status of\n citizen.[19]\n This process is thought to have already begun in contemporary\ndemocracies since, as noted above, many of the civil and social rights\nassociated with citizenship are now extended to all individuals\nresiding in the state, notwithstanding their legal status. Political\nrights to participation should likewise be extended to resident\nnoncitizens, and perhaps even to those \u201cnoncitizen\nnonresidents\u201d who have fundamental interests that are affected\nby a particular state (Song 2009).\n\nThe emergence of human rights instruments at the international level\nhas lent some credibility to the perspective of a deterritorialization\nof rights regimes and the possibility of securing a person\u2019s\nbasic rights irrespective of her formal membership status in a given\npolity. In this context, it is not in virtue of our (particular)\ncitizenship that we are recognized rights, but in virtue of our\n(universal) personhood.\n\nOver and above diverging assessments of the empirical plausibility of\nunbundling, some authors highlight the risks involved and contest its\ndesirability. Stable citizenship regimes \u201cpromote internal\nredistribution and support co-governance\u201d. \u201c[B]y\nencouraging the dissolution of the bundle of benefits and protections\nthat currently attach to citizenship, proponents of the unbundling\nvision will also begin to fuel an alternative discourse as well\n\u2013 one that urges the privatization and fragmentation of\ncitizenship, and that implies less collective responsibility for the\nwell being of members\u201d (Shachar 2009, 67).\n\nThe debate over voting rights, in particular, is complex and covers\nboth external (extending voting rights to nonresident citizens) and\ninternal voting (expanding the franchise to resident non-citizens).\nTheorists with sympathies to the social membership thesis (arguing\nthat residence over time in a specific territory is the key to\nmembership in a society) or to the stakeholder conception of\ncitizenship usually consider that long-term residence in a country\nshould be the basis for the allocation of democratic rights. The\nargument may cover not only migrants who qualify for permanent\nresident status, but also those who have entered illegally in the\ncountry (Carens 2010b, 2013) as well as temporary migrants, in\nparticular \u2018guest workers\u2019 who are often denied any access\nto citizenship (Lenard 2015). On this view, safety from deportation\nand the entitlement to the state\u2019s protection when abroad is\nwhat distinguishes citizens from resident noncitizens. Citizenship\nrights are understood as extra-territorial (\u201cthey follow the\ncitizen rather than the territory\u201d) while voting rights are best\nunderstood as territorial (Lenard 2015,\n 131).[20]\n\nThough some states do extend voting rights to resident noncitizens at\nthe local level, it is the growing extension of voting rights to\nnonresident citizens over the last decades that is particularly\nstriking (Pogonyi 2014). It shows the persistence of a conception of\nmembership premised on understanding the nation-state as a historical\ncommunity of citizens with common values and shared ethno-cultural\ntraits. On this view, voting rights are not understood territorially,\nbut follow the citizen when she settles outside of her home country.\nThough one can understand some of the pragmatic reasons that often\nmotivate states to recognize voting rights to expatriates (e.g.\nacknowledging and encouraging their continued contribution to the home\ncountry through payment of remittances), normative theorists have been\nmostly critical of this phenomenon (see especially Lopez-Guerra 2005).\nThe policy followed by certain states of the former socialist\nfederations (USSR and Yugoslavia) of recognizing voting rights to\nco-ethnics residing in territories integrated in neighbouring\nindependent states, as well as the more recent decisions by states\nlike Hungary and Romania to extend voting rights to trans-border\nethnic kin populations, should alert us to the dangers to regional\nstability that the \u201cre-ethnicization of citizenship\u201d\ninvolve (Joppke 2005, cited by Pogonyi 2014; see also Pogonyi 2023).\nMoreover, where the electoral system is not designed to limit the\npotential political impact of the nonresident electoral body, external\nvoting may effect the \u201cresident constituency\u2019s right to\ndemocratic self-determination\u201d (Pogonyi 2014, 135-136).\n\nThe rise of \u201ccash-for-passports\u201d programs over the last\nten years in many liberal states is yet another sign of an increasing\n\u201cprivatization and fragmentation of citizenship\u201d. These\nprograms \u2013 like the one introduced by the government of Malta in\nOctober 2013 \u2013 have provoked a heated debate over normative\nissues (Shachar and Hirschl 2014; Shachar 2017; Hidalgo 2016; Joppke\n2019; Erez 2021; Irving\n 2022).[21]\n There are two main objections. First, these programs raise issues of\nfairness towards other potential immigrants lacking the resources to\nqualify as well as towards those who remain in the country of origin.\nSecond, they represent a government-induced commodification of\ncitizenship that may distort the citizens\u2019 understanding of the\nkind of commitment to the political community and to co-citizens that\ncitizenship entails. In contrast, those who refuse to condemn investor\ncitizenship programs point to the normative inconsistencies that often\npermeate their critics\u2019 accounts. Is it consistent to defend a\nstate\u2019s right to restrict immigration while claiming that it is\nnot permissible for states to sell foreigners access to the country\n(Hidalgo 2016)? Can one reject as unethical investment-based criteria\nfor immigration while condoning skilled-based criteria (Erez 2022)?\nCan one criticize citizen-investors for not residing in their new\ncountry while not condemning those who acquire dual citizenship (based\non ancestry or descent) without having any serious intention of\nresiding in the state (Irving\n 2022)?[22]\n Other theorists emphasize that worries over the corrupting effect of\ncash-for-passports schemes are premised on a conception of citizenship\nthat gives an overblown importance to its political dimension in an\nage of decreasing participation in democratic institutions (e.g.\nvoting, membership in political parties, etc.). One should face\nsquarely the fact that citizenship is essentially about the\nopportunities and protection that passports issued by certain states\nprovide to individuals (Kochenov 2018). For those who share\nShachar\u2019s robust view of citizenship, the depressing reality may\nwell be that investor citizenship programs are more a symptom than a\ncause of the larger malaise provoked by the \u201cmaterial forces of\nglobalization\u201d (Spiro 2018, 19; see also Joppke 2019,\n866\u2013867).\n3.3 Debating transnational citizenship: statists vs. globalists\n\nAs we have seen in the preceding sections, the nation-state\u2019s\nsovereignty is often described as an impediment to global justice. Its\ncapacity to deal with economic, social and environmental problems that\nincreasingly cut across borders is also questioned. Under these\ncircumstances, should the sovereign, territorial state still be seen\nas the necessary institutional context for justice and democracy? What\nare the alternatives?\n\nThis kind of question has sparked at least two responses from\ntheorists of citizenship. \u2018Globalists\u2019 insist on the need\nto rethink democracy and citizenship beyond the nation-state,\nproposing schemes to extend democratic politics to regional and global\n levels.[23]\n \u2018Statists\u2019, in contrast, argue that democratic\ncitizenship requires a bounded territorial space, the state, within\nwhich citizens can see themselves as part of a common demos.\nCentral to this debate is a disagreement over the meaning of\ndemocratic political agency and its basic conditions.\n\nThe disagreement over conditions is crucial since conditions can be\ndefined in ways that limit the potential extension of the political\ncommunity. Democratic agency\u2019s meaning can also be contested. To\nwhat extent should it be understood as a collective agency? Should\npolitical action be characterized as a common practice, in which\ncitizens are in relations of interaction and mutual awareness, or can\nit be defined as primarily individual? \n\nSupporters of global democracy reject the conventional identification\nbetween demos, territory, and citizenship. In their view,\ncitizenship is not a set of practices and of rights that need to be\nanchored in a particular demos defined by specific\nterritorial boundaries. On the contrary, citizenship is ideally\nexercised in a multiplicity of \u2018sites\u2019, situated at\ndifferent levels of governance: local, national, regional, and global\n(Maas 2017). Global democrats sketch a multilayered, global democratic\norder in which no single layer or site is dominant (Pogge 1992, 58,\nYoung 2000, 266). This scheme implies a \u2018vertical\u2019\ndispersal of power above and below existing sovereign states, which\nlose their centrality. This would lower incentives for conflicts over\npower and wealth within and between states, \u201c\u2018thereby\nreducing the incidence of war, poverty, and oppression\u2019 and\nenvironmental degradation\u201d (Kuper 2004, 30, quoting Pogge 1992,\n102\u2013105).\n\nGlobalists would balance this dilution of state power by strengthening\ncertain global regulatory regimes in areas like peace and security,\nhuman rights, the environment, trade and finances, etc. These regimes\nwould set down general rules \u201cregarding that small but vital set\nof issues around which peace and justice call for global\nco-operation\u201d (Young 2000, 267; see also Held 2005). A set of\nglobal institutions would be needed to ensure the application of these\nrules; though globalists are quick to point out the importance of\ndemocratic principles \u2014 consent, self-determination and autonomy\n\u2014 and their institutional implications (Pogge 1992, 64).\n\nThe formal political institutions and procedures envisaged are often\nfamiliar: representative assemblies based on elections and referenda.\nThese institutions would exist at each level of the multilayered\nscheme: local, national, regional, and global. Following the European\nUnion model, continent-wide parliaments are envisaged, as well as a\nreformed general assembly of the United Nations. At the informal\nlevel, globalists insist on the need for globally active organizations\nof civil society, welcome the emergence of a transnational public\nopinion and call on global agencies such as the World Trade\nOrganization and the International Monetary Fund to commit themselves\nto basic principles of publicity.\n\nGlobal democrats assume that the extension of democracy beyond the\nlimits of the nation-state is neither conceptually nor practically\nimpossible. Their response to claims that scale constitutes a major\nobstacle is twofold: first, they put the principle of subsidiarity at\nthe centre of their institutional scheme (Held 2005, 14; Pogge 1992,\n65\u201366); second, they insist that robust democratic politics is\ntruly possible only at the local level. In existing nation-states,\nrepresentative institutions are already far removed from ordinary\ncitizens, who feel largely disempowered and disaffected (Young 2000,\n270\u2013271). Since the proposed multilayered scheme involves\nsignificant decentralization from the national to the sub-national\nlevel, the argument runs that global democracy would, in fact,\ntranslate into more, rather than less, \u2018real\u2019 democracy.\nIt would serve to increase the ability of citizens to participate\neffectively in shaping the policies that concern them directly (Pogge\n1992, 64; Young 2000, 269). However, no matter how forcefully the\nprinciple of subsidiarity is applied, the global democratic project\nwould still entail the implementation of global principles and\nstandards (e.g. (re)distributive principles, human rights standards)\nthat would rely on coercive enforcement agencies (Benhabib 2004, 113).\nThis means that the democratic legitimacy of political institutions\nabove the level of the state is an issue that cannot be avoided.\n\nStatists have tried to identify some basic background conditions to\ndemocratic institutions and procedures that cannot be satisfied beyond\na certain threshold. Their argument is empirical, rather than\nconceptual. A common language is one plausible candidate put forward\nby Kymlicka. He insists that linguistic/territorial political\nassociations are the primary forum for democratic participation,\nrather than higher-level political associations that cut across\nlinguistic lines, because democratic politics is essentially\n\u201cpolitics in the vernacular\u201d (Kymlicka 1999, 121). Even in\ncases where average citizens are conversant in one or more foreign\nlanguage, they rarely have the level of fluency necessary to\nparticipate in political debate in a language other than their own:\nonly a select few have the ability and opportunity to acquire and\nsustain the necessary language skills. Political debate in\nmultilingual settings is essentially an elitist pursuit.\n\nIn fact, political discussions require a higher degree of fluency than\nwhat is needed for business transactions or tourism: \u201cpolitical\ncommunication has a large ritualistic component, and these ritualized\nforms of communication are typically language-specific. Even if one\nunderstands a foreign language in the technical sense, without\nknowledge of these ritualistic elements one may be unable to\nunderstand political debates\u201d (Kymlicka 1999, 121). In that\ncase, the hope that English\u2019s emergence as a new global\nlingua franca could overcome the linguistic obstacles that\nimpede the development of transnational democratic politics appear\noverstated. English\u2019s growing use may be enough to increase\nmutual understanding between individuals, but it is unlikely to become\na transnational vernacular allowing democratic politics to transcend\nnational\n boundaries.[24]\nHowever, that argument may not prove to be the insuperable obstacle\nthat statists suppose. If the development of a global public sphere,\nextending across state boundaries, is indeed necessary for democratic\npolitics at the global level, this can be interpreted in terms of\nmaking national public spheres responsive to each other. This does not\nrequire that citizens themselves become multilingual, but that the\nmedia inform citizens about how issues of common interest are debated\nin other (national) public spheres (see Habermas 2009, 87).\n\nThe development of transnational advocacy networks may also indicate\nthat the statists\u2019 worries are overstated. Their existence shows\nthat it is possible for individuals to exercise political agency in\nforums other than those provided by democratic states and that the\nabsence of a common vernacular does not impede participation. Global\ndemocracy becomes thinkable once we focus on the development of\ntransnational civil society rather than on the transposing of\nrepresentative institutions at the global level. In response, it\nshould be noted that such networks usually coalesce around a common\nideology or a conception of the good (e.g. the environment; rights of\nindigenous peoples, critique of neo-liberal forms of globalisation,\netc.), serving as a functional equivalent to a common vernacular. More\nimportantly, these networks are composed of voluntary associations\norganized around shared interests and cannot stand as a surrogate for\nthe political community per se, which acts as the addressee\nof claims made by the organisations and groups of civil society.\n\nWhich political community or communities can act as the addressee of\nclaims made by organisations of transnational civil society? Though\nsomething like a global political society can be seen as emerging in\nglobal events like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences\n(COP), national political communities and their formal institutions\nstill appear as the main adressees of claims. In that case, Kymlicka\nis right to claim that: \u201cthe weak transnationalism of advocacy\nnetworks is predicated on, even parasitic on, the ongoing existence of\nbounded political communities\u201d (Kymlicka 2003, 291). In this\nrespect, though the organisations and associations of an emerging\ntransnational civil society can offer possibilities of political\nagency for certain committed individuals and groups, they do not offer\na solution to the problem posed by the extension of democratic\ncitizenship to the global\n level.[25]\n\nHowever, this conclusion may be faulted for putting too much weight on\nthe formal institutional context within which democratic citizenship\nis set. Important strands in the citizenship literature display\nattempts to break free from this way of conceptualizing citizenship,\nfocusing instead on practices of citizenship defined independently of\nits formal legal status. These strands point to perhaps more fruitful\navenues to conceptualize transnational democratic citizenship. James\nTully\u2019s contribution is particularly important here because of\nthe broader, practice-based definition of citizenship he offers. Tully\nuses \u201cthe term \u2018citizen\u2019 to refer to a person who is\nsubject to a relationship of governance (that is to say, governed)\nand, simultaneously and primarily, is an active agent in the\nfield of a governance relationship\u201d (Tully 2008a, 3). Governance\nrelationships take place at all levels of political and social life:\nbelow, beyond and across the boundaries of the state. Citizenship,\nconsidered primarily as an activity, cannot be reduced to \u201ca\nstatus given by institutions of the modern constitutional state and\ninternational law\u201d. It refers instead to the \u201cnegotiated\npractices in which one becomes citizen through participation\u201d\n(Tully 2008b,\n 248).[26]\n\nThe \u201cacts of citizenship\u201d literature, formed around the\nwritings of Engen Isin, is also relevant here (Isin 2008; 2009; 2017).\nIsin developed his theory to make sense of what he calls an\n\u201cunnamed figure\u201d, \u201cwhich belies the modern figure of\nthe citizen with singular loyalty, identity and belongings\u201d. He\nrelated its appearance to the emergence of new \u2018sites\u2019 and\n\u2018scales\u2019 while insisting that it could not be adequaltely\ngrasped by conventional categories like \u2018foreigner\u2019,\n\u2018migrant\u2019, \u2018refugee\u2019, \u2018nomad\u2019,\netc. He suggested escaping from conventional accounts by focusing on\nthe \u201c\u2019acts\u2019 through which \u2018actors\u2019 claim\nto transform themselves (and others) from subjects into citizens as\nclaimants of rights\u201d (Isin 2009, 368). This suggestion has led\nto a fluid and dynamic conception of citizenship that attempts to make\nsense of phenomena that extend below, beyond and across state\nboundaries without denying the stubborn reality of states (see e.g.\nTonkiss 2022; M\u00fcller 2022; Roy and Neveu 2023).\n\nThere is still another version of the global democratic project that\ninvolves an individualist conception of democratic political agency.\nHere citizens can engage in significant political activities that do\nnot require high levels of interaction and cooperation between them\n(Kuper 2004). This position requires, first, that one abandon the\nconception of democratic legitimacy implicit in deliberative,\nparticipatory and republican conceptions of democracy, which all\nattempt to maintain a broadly Rousseauian understanding of legitimacy:\nlaws are legitimate only if citizens can see themselves, somehow, as\ntheir coauthors. Kuper suggests that this vision of democratic\nlegitimacy be discarded in favour of one focusing on the\nresponsiveness of the political system as a whole. The central issue\nbecomes whether this system is made to act \u201cin the best\ninterests of the public, in a manner responsive to them\u201d (Kuper\n2004, 75 quoting Pitkin 1967). On this view, the vertical, rather than\nhorizontal, dimension of communication is of overarching importance:\nindividual citizens must have access to relevant information about\nwhat various authorities are doing, there must exist institutional\nchannels through which they can pressure authorities and let them know\ntheir views on proposed policies. Doing so does not require that they\n\u201cact together with high levels of mutual awareness\u201d (Kuper\n2004, 127); they can exercise these capacities individually, via\nspecific agencies. Responsiveness is also a dimension of democratic\nlegitimacy favoured by some empirical political scientists, referring\nto the responsiveness of representatives to the opinions, preferences\nand concerns of citizens communicated via various agencies. It is\nmeasured through statistical correlation in which public opinion is\nthe dependent variable and policy output is the independent variable\n(for an overview see Page (1994)).\n\nIn contrast to the vertical and sometimes causal picture of\ncitizenship depicted in responsiveness, one may insist, as does\nBernard Manin, that meaningful political agency requires that citizens\nbe capable of learning what their co-citizens think about important\npolicy issues or events independently of the authorities. Horizontal\ncommunication between citizens appears as a necessary condition to\ntheir being capable of political action (Manin 1997,\n 170\u2013171).[27]\n The thing that makes citizens political agents is their capacity to\nact independently of authorities and this ability, in turn, depends on\nwhether they regularly act and communicate together, even if this\ninteraction is often mediated through institutions like the electronic\nmedia.\n4. Citizenship\u2019s new frontier?\n\nDespite their many differences, the conceptions of citizenship\ndiscussed in the preceding sections share the idea that citizenship\nsupposes a certain kind of agency, one that involves the\nindividual\u2019s capacity to reflect on his/her subjective good as\nwell as on the good of the whole. And this has long been associated,\nin the Western tradition, to a complex discursive capacity that only\nhuman beings are thought to possess. Following Aristotle:\n\n[W]hereas mere voice is but an indicator of pleasure or pain and is\ntherefore found in other animals (\u2026), the power of speech is\nintended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and therefore\nlikewise the just and the unjust. And it is characteristic of man that\nhe alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the\nlike, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a\nfamily and a state (Aristotle, 1996, 1253a10\u20131253a18).\n\n\nThe capacity for rational agency has long functioned as a threshold\ncondition for citizenship. In Aristotle\u2019s Politics, for\nexample, the exclusion of women and slaves from citizenship is based\non an account of their souls as lacking the appropriate kind of\nrationality. The long history of the extension of citizenship to\ngroups previously excluded did not change this basic understanding. It\ninvolved the recognition that the newly included (e.g. women, workers,\ndescendants of former slaves) did, in fact, satisfy the threshold\ncondition.\n\nContemporary democratic and republican theories often rely on an ideal\npicture of the citizen as actively involved in the political life of\nthe community. This encompasses a vast array of activities and\npractices, including voting in elections, canvassing, participating in\npublic deliberation, demonstrating against government decisions or\npolicies, etc. These activities all presuppose the capacity for a\ncertain kind of agency, one that relies heavily on rational,\ndiscursive abilities. This common view sits uncomfortably with the\nfact that many individuals \u2014 in some cases because of deep\ncognitive disability \u2014 do not have these capacities. Though they\nmay be members of the society, can they \u2014 truly \u2014 be\ncitizens? From Locke to Rawls, the answer has been overwhelmingly\nnegative, confining these individuals to the category of wards (Arneil\n2009 and 2016, Pinheiro 2016, Clifford Simplican 2016). Though society\nmay have the responsibility to ensure their welfare, they can have no\nsay in its definition, and are fated to remain society\u2019s passive\nbeneficiaries.\n\nOver the last forty years, disability advocates and scholars have\ncontested this view of the disabled, insisting that they should be\nseen and treated as citizens, not as wards. Some philosophers and\npolitical theorists have rallied to this view and questioned the\nconception of agency presupposed in the conventional view of\ndemocratic citizenship as unduly exclusionary (Nussbaum 2006, Arneil\n2009, Arneil and Hirschmann 2016). Building on the work of disability\ntheorists, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka (2011, 2016) have argued\nfurther that if one accepts \u2014 as one should \u2014 that a\ncapacity for complex discursive agency is not necessary for\ncitizenship, then one should also recognize domestic animals as\nco-citizens since they qualify as members of\n society.[28]\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka define agency as \u201cself-willed or\ninitiated action that carries an expectation of efficacy\u201d\n(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 180, fn 16). On this view, agency does\nnot require discursive rationality and individuals with deep cognitive\ndisability as well as domestic animals can be described as agents. The\nscope of agency is conceptualized into two parts: micro (the capacity\nto have a say over everyday choices) and macro (the capacity of\nindividuals to shape the \u201cfundamental dimensions of their\nlives\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 180)). In Zoopolis\n(2011), this macro dimension of agency is described more explicitly in\npolitical terms, referring to a capacity for political participation.\nTo the extent that individuals act in ways that can be construed as\nexpressing approval, acquiescence or dissent with the laws and\nregulations that affect them, they can be described as acting\npolitically and as displaying a form of democratic agency.\n\nThe absence of linguistic agency creates specific challenges since\nboth individuals with deep cognitive disability and domestic animals\nare \u201cdependent on others to support and interpret their\nparticipation\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 176). They can be\nagents only with the help of others, who have discursive rationality,\nand with whom they share relations of trust. The latter can help\nstructure or \u201cscaffold\u201d meaningful choices for the former\nand interpret their expressions.\n\nAccepting that instances of \u201cdependent agency\u201d can count\nas political participation supposes that we abandon the binary between\nindependent and dependent forms of agency as well as the belief that\nonly the former counts as the right kind of agency when it comes to\ncitizenship. This should not be too difficult to do if we are willing\nto recognize that \u201c[w]e are all interdependent, relying on\nothers to enable and sustain our (variable and contextual) capacities\nfor agency\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011, 107). This is not to\nclaim that we are all the same, but to argue in favour of replacing\nthe binary between \u201can autonomous, rational agent\u201d and\n\u201chis or her opposite, the \u2018disabled\u2019\u201d\n\u201cwith a gradient scale in which we are all in various ways and\nin different degrees both dependent on others and independent\u201d\n(Arneil 2009, 234).\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka\u2019s argument becomes less convincing when\nthey attempt to illustrate with concrete examples what they mean by\nthe political participation of domestic animals. In some of the\nexamples they use, the humans involved appear as the real agents of\nthe actions described while animals come across as the objects of\ntheir masters\u2019 agency (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011,\n112\u2013116; Hinchcliffe 2015). In response to this criticism,\nDonaldson and Kymlicka have conceded the weakness of some of their\nexamples while maintaining the possibility of finding better ones.\nMore interestingly for our purposes, they insist that:\n\u201ccapacities for agency are embedded in ongoing social relations\namongst responsive, reflexive, and interdependent selves, not located\nin a threshold individual capacity for rational reflection and public\ndeliberation\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2015, 331). If we accept\nthat people with deep cognitive disability and domestic animals are\nmembers of society, then the right question to ask is not whether they\nmeet the threshold condition of discursive rationality and can be\nrecognized as citizens. We should rather enquire about the kind of\nspaces in which their political agency could be expressed as well as\nlook for the mechanisms through which their citizenship could be\nenacted. In short, instead of defining who can be a citizen according\nto whether or not an individual or group can function in the existing\nspaces of citizenship (i.e. whether they can participate in elections\nor militate for political parties), we should create distinct spaces\nthat are commensurate to the capacities of all those who possess\nrights of\n citizenship.[29]\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka\u2019s main objective is to secure the rights\nof animals against the terrible and unjust consequences of human\nbeings\u2019 lordship over them. From the perspective of democratic\ntheory, the upshot of their argument is mixed. On the one hand, it may\noffer a promising response to the persisting complaints about the\nalleged incompetence of \u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens in\ncontemporary mass democracies (Brennan 2016) by stimulating our\ninstitutional imagination to create better spaces of citizenship for\neveryone. On the other hand, extending the definitions of political\nparticipation and democratic agency to cover the actions of domestic\nanimals may also weaken the very significance of democratic\ncitizenship. Perhaps more importantly, they highlight an abiding\ntension in democratic theory between two models of citizenship: the\nmembership model, where citizenship is defined in terms of social\nmembership, and what they call the \u201ccapacity contract\u201d, in\nwhich citizenship is defined in terms of \u201ccapacities for\nparticular kinds of agency\u201d (Kymlicka and Donaldson 2018,\n161).\n5. Conclusion\n\nOur survey of contemporary discussions has highlighted important\ndifferences over each of the three dimensions of citizenship. As a\nlegal status, citizenship remains the keystone of contemporary\nconceptions: its normative core is the principle that citizens shall\nenjoy equal rights, although most would now agree that, in certain\ncircumstances, equal consideration of individuals\u2019 interests may\njustifiably result in differential treatment by the state. This broad\nagreement on principle leaves ample room for disagreement over the\nparticulars, as witnessed by the recurring debates over affirmative\naction and minority rights. These discussions have become a hallmark\nof contemporary liberal societies, and our legal and political\ndiscourses are well equipped to handle them. The deeper worry, which\nnew forms of political violence have made more acute, centres upon\nachieving a proper balance between the recognition of difference and\nthe affirmation of common principles to which all citizens adhere.\n\nHow robust an identity can citizenship provide in complex and\ninternally diverse societies? There is a tension here that is\ndifficult to resolve: our awareness of the pluralist nature of\ncontemporary societies leads us to underscore the importance of\ngeneral legal and political principles (democracy, human rights, rule\nof law) rather than the traditional emblems of nationality: common\nhistory and culture. Postnationalists, in particular, emphasize the\nrole of democratic political practice in securing social integration.\nYet, the complexity and scale of contemporary liberal societies tend\nto make this practice less significant in the lives of most citizens,\na fact reflected in declining levels of participation in formal\npolitical institutions. Are we not expecting too much from democratic\npolitical practice under current circumstances?\n\nThis question brings us face to face with the difficult issue of\ncitizens\u2019 political agency, which has long been central to\ndebates between liberals and republicans. Whether we understand\ndemocracy in terms of civic self-government (republican version) or as\nthe ability to exercise control over government (liberal version), it\nis not easy to determine how, and through what institutional\nmechanisms, citizens can exercise meaningful political agency in\ncomplex societies. This difficulty is epitomized in the debate over\ntransnational citizenship. Although global citizenship is conceivable\nfirst and foremost as a legal status securing a number of fundamental\nhuman rights, most authors agree that it should not be strictly legal\nin nature and must have a significant political dimension. One senses,\nhowever, a distinct malaise when it comes to identifying appropriate\nnormative standards and to locating the institutions through which\nthese could be approximated.\n\nIn the end, our dismissal of the\nencyclop\u00e9diste\u2019s interest in distinguishing\nsubject and citizen may have been too hasty. If being a citizen in a\nliberal-democratic political community is to mean something more than\nthe status of legal subject, we must be ready to state what\nthis \u201cmore\u201d entails. This stubborn blind-spot of theories\nof citizenship leads us to some of the most difficult issues\npertaining to the very possibility of democracy in the contemporary\nworld.\n",
