    "main_text": "The Basic Idea || Introduced\n1.1 Introduced\n\nThe term \u2018alienation\u2019 is usually thought to have comparatively modern\nEuropean origins. In English, the term had emerged by the early\nfifteenth century, already possessing an interesting cluster of\nassociations. \u2018Alienation\u2019, and its cognates, could\nvariously refer: to an individual\u2019s estrangement from God (it\nappears thus in the Wycliffe Bible); to legal transfers of ownership\nrights (initially, especially in land); and to mental derangement (a\nhistorical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage\nof the term \u2018alienist\u2019 for a psychiatric doctor). It is\nsometimes said that \u2018alienation\u2019 entered the German\nlanguage via English legal usage, although G.W.F. Hegel\n(1770\u20131831), for one, typically uses\n\u2018Ent\u00e4usserung\u2019, and not\n\u2018Entfremdung\u2019 to refer to property transfer\n(Hegel 1991a: \u00a765). (It is only the latter term which has an\netymological link to \u2018fremd\u2019 or\n\u2018alien\u2019.) Moreover, perhaps the first philosophical\ndiscussion of alienation, at least of any sophistication, was in\nFrench. In the Second Discourse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712\u20131778) diagnoses \u2018inflamed\u2019 forms of amour\npropre\u2014a love of self (which is sometimes rendered as\n\u2018pride\u2019 or \u2018vanity\u2019 in older English\ntranslations)\u2014whose toxicity is amplified by certain social and\nhistorical developments, as manifesting themselves in alienated forms\nof self; that is, in the actions and lives of individuals who have\nsomehow become divided from their own nature (see Rousseau 1997, and\nForst 2017, 526\u201330).\n\nThere are limits to what can usefully be said about the concept of\nalienation in general; that is, what can usefully be said without\ngetting involved in the complexities of particular accounts, advanced\nby particular authors, or associated with particular intellectual\ntraditions. However, there is a basic idea here which seems to capture\nmany of those authors and traditions, and which is not unduly\nelusive or difficult to understand.\n\nThis basic idea of alienation picks out a range of social and\npsychological ills involving a self and other. More precisely, it\nunderstands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of\na subject and object that belong together.\n",
