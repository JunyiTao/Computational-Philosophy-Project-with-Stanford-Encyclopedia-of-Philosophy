Daoist Replies and Critique of Logic\n\nWhile the kinds of semantic rules underlying the interpretation of our\nexpressions in language might be heterogeneous, with no guarantee that\nassumptions about compositionality will hold, the Mohists nevertheless\ndid not waver in their belief that the objects of experience exhibit\nreal similarities and differences, and that the identification of\nthese similarities and differences is what allows us to\n\u201cdistinguish the noble and the base\u201d (ming gui\njian, to use Xunzi\u2019s phrase). Indeed, the central purpose\nof language is to guide behavior by clarifying how one should act, and\nthis is done by distinguishing the noble and the base through the\nsubtle analysis of similarities and differences. We take the actions\nof exemplary individuals as models, identify the criteria that\ndistinguish them or their actions, and act accordingly in an analogous\nway. Sometimes these semantic analyses would reveal odd consequences;\nas noted above, \u201crobbers are people, but killing robbers is not\nkilling people\u201d. But the Mohists were not in general averse to\nembracing such oddities, given their general conviction that the\nphilosophical explication of meaning should follow normal conventions\nof use. In any case, they never abandoned the belief that an\nexhaustive analysis of semantic possibilities should render\ntransparent real similarities and differences in the world in a way\nthat provides a consistent, invariable guide for action. If the\nanalysis of language can provide this, then confusion about how to act\nshould be dispelled from society and people should be able to live\ntogether in harmony.\n\nThis claim that the analysis of language can provide a consistent\nguide for action is precisely what the Daoists targeted in their\nobjections and the main focus of their philosophical skepticism. What\nis surprising is that Daoist skeptics like Zhuangzi do not reject the\nMohists\u2019 basic view that the world is populated by various kinds\nof objects with real similarities and differences. They agree,\nmoreover, in their basic understanding of how objects undergo\ndifferent forms of transformation in time; the Mohists even give us\ndistinct terms to convey these differences. The difference is that, in\nZhuangzi\u2019s view, no matter how much analysis we undertake, or\nhow finely we discriminate, our language will never secure enough\ntraction in reality to provide us with a constant guide for action.\nZhuangzi was so unsatisfied with the ongoing debates of his times that\nhe was compelled to develop what he took to be a transcendent\nphilosophical worldview not limited by the hope of resolving these\ndebates through simple explications of semantic distinctions. Life is\nlarger than what can be grasped by the human capacity for reason, and\nthere are forms of intuitive knowledge or experience that cannot be\nexplained by the crude implements of language.\n\nThere are stories in the Zhuangzi that attest to the\nperfected skills of wheelwrights, carpenters, and other artisans who\nlament the fact that they cannot express how they manage to perform\ntheir tasks so well. The self-description of wheelwright Pian is a\ngood example:\n\n\nI look at it from the point of view of my own work. When I chisel a\nwheel, if the blows of the mallet are too gentle, the chisel slides\nand won\u2019t take hold. But if they\u2019re too hard, it bites in\nand won\u2019t budge. Not too gentle, not too hard\u2014you can get\nit in your hand and feel it in your mind. You can\u2019t put it into\nwords, and yet there is a knack to it somehow. I can\u2019t teach it\nto my son and he can\u2019t learn it from me. So I\u2019ve gone\nalong for seventy years and at my age I am still chiseling wheels.\nWhen the men of old died they took with them the things that\ncouldn\u2019t be handed down. So what you are reading there must be\nnothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old. (tr. Watson 1968:\n152\u20133)\n\n\nThe reference to books at the end of this passage is striking.\nZhuangzi claims to have an insight about the subtlety and facility of\nunderstanding that cannot be captured in written form, or even through\noral discourse with appropriate demonstratives. The names of language\ndiscriminate meanings, but inevitably there is slippage in their\ncoordination with objects.\n\nThis is most obviously apparent in Zhuangzi\u2019s appeal to the\nindexical phenomena of language, which Zhuangzi used as a foil against\nthe Mohists\u2019 claim that the meanings of terms can reliably fix\ntheir designations. He seems to have in mind what we would understand\nby the term \u201cindexical\u201d today: a term whose designation is\nfixed not only by its meaning but also by facts about the conditions\nsurrounding its utterance. Such facts are relevant to the\ndetermination of the shifting referents of pronouns (\u201cI\u201d,\n\u201cyou\u201d), demonstratives (\u201cthis\u201d,\n\u201cthat\u201d), and spatial and temporal adverbs\n(\u201chere\u201d, \u201cthere\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d,\n\u201cnow\u201d, \u201cbefore\u201d), and Zhuangzi appeals to all\nof these in a variety of elliptical and argumentative contexts. His\ngeneral view seems to be that different perspectives or standpoints\ninvolved in the utterances of terms have important bearings on how\nthese terms are used and what they refer to. The so-called impure\nindexicals \u201cthis\u201d (bi) and \u201cthat\u201d\n(shi) (see the entry on\n indexicals),\n commonly used in Classical Chinese for naming objects (\u201cThis is\na horse\u201d, \u201cThat is an ox\u201d), make the perspectivalism\nof Zhuangzi\u2019s approach clear:\n\n\nNo thing is not that; no thing is not this. From that, it is not seen;\nfrom this it is known. Therefore it is said: That comes out of this;\nthis goes along with that; which is to say, that and this are born\nsimultaneously. (Zhuangzi 2/27\u201329; tr. Graham 1989)\n\n\nArguably, Zhuangzi is suggesting that reference is always keyed to a\nperspective that somehow rules out others. This would explain the\nconclusion that \u201cthat and this are born simultaneously\u201d:\nthe perspective one takes in calling an object \u201cthis\u201d\nimplies an alternative perspective in which another calls it\n\u201cthat\u201d. \u201cThat\u201d and \u201cthis\u201d is a\npair whose terms function in coordination. Zhuangzi is seeking a\nphilosophical perspective that transcends all arbitrary\ndichotomies:\n\n\nThis too is that, that too is this. There they say \u201cIt\u2019s\nthis, it\u2019s not\u201d from one point of view, here we say\n\u201cIt\u2019s this, it\u2019s not\u201d from another point of\nview. Are there really this and that? Or really no this and that?\nWhere neither this nor that finds its opposite is called the axis of\nthe Way. When once the axis is found at the center of the circle there\nis no limit to responding with either, on the one hand no limit to\nwhat is this, on the other no limit to what is not. Therefore I say,\n\u201cThe best means is illumination\u201d. (Zhuangzi\n2/29\u201331; tr. Graham 1989)\n\n\nThis point is made with demonstratives, which are among the most\nfickle of the indexicals of language, seemingly capable of referring\nto anything regardless of context. But we can appreciate the\ngeneralization Zhuangzi is hinting at when we consider again how the\nMohists explained acts of reference. Recall that when the Mohists say\n\u201cThere is a horse\u201d (you ma), they appear to be\nmaking a claim to the effect that a certain object x\nresembles the model m for horses. If they state this with the\ndemonstrative bi (\u201cthis\u201d), then they are making\nthe further claim that some object x to which they stand in a\ncertain relation (likely of perceptual acquaintance) resembles the\nmodel m for horses. Note also that the Mohists recognize that\nobjects do not always resemble their standards exactly; sometimes it\nis only partial, in which case the object of reference must resemble\nit \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d, according to a criterion\n(yi). Presumably, this criterion identifies something salient\nin the comparison that remains consistent across linguistic contexts.\nZhuangzi\u2019s point would then amount to the claim that no salience\nconditions are ever invariable across linguistic contexts. The\nuniqueness of each act of reference undermines the possibility of\nidentifying any contextually invariant rule, since the conditions of\nsuccessful reference involve facts not only about the relations of\nnames and objects but also about the relations of acquaintance one has\nwith those objects. Indeed, given the great emphasis on indexicality\nin the Zhuangzi, some scholars have claimed that Zhuangzi\nholds the thesis that all language is indexical. This is a view that\ncannot be defended here; readers may consult Hansen 1992 for a lengthy\ntreatment.\n",
