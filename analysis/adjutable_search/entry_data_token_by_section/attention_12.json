    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention and Consciousness\n3.1 Attention and Consciousness\n3.1.1 Is Attention Necessary for Consciousness?\n\nThe question of whether attention is necessary for consciousness has\nbeen answered in various ways. One answer is given by those who think\nthat lots of unattended items appear in consciousness. A different\nanswer is given by those who think that only some unattended items\nfigure in consciousness. A third answer is given if we think that\nunattended items figure in consciousness only in special\ncircumstances. There is some evidence that, independently of any\nphilosophical commitments, people differ as to which of these views\nthey find plausible (Schwitzgebel, 2007). There are also some theories\n(e.g., Watzl, 2017) in which attention is necessary for\n\u2018creature consciousness\u2019 in the sense that every conscious\ncreature must be an attentive one. Such views need not entail that\nattention to an object is necessary for the conscious perception of\nthat object.\n\nAt one extreme end of this spectrum is the view according to which\nattention to a thing is strictly necessary for consciousness of it, so\nthat the things to which we are not paying attention do not figure in\nour consciousness at all. A number of psychologists endorse this view\n(e.g., Cohen et al. 2012), as do some philosophers (e.g.,\nPrinz, 2012, Carruthers, 2015, Montemayor & Haladjian, 2015). It\nhas historical precedent in James\u2019s remark, at the beginning of\nhis chapter on attention, that \u201cmy experience is what I agree to\nattend to\u201d(James, 1890, ch. 11), and in Kames\u2019 remark that\n\u201cAttention is requisite even to the simple act of seeing\u201d\n(Kames, 1769, see Sect\n 1.4,\n above).\n\nThe evidence that is proffered in support of the view that attention\nis strictly necessary for consciousness comes from a range of\nexperiments showing the surprising extent to which experimental\nparticipants are ignorant of the items to which they have paid no\nattention. In Arien Mack and Irvin Rock\u2019s \u2018inattentional\nblindness\u2019 paradigm, for example, participants who are given an\nattention-demanding task pertaining to a stimulus in one part of their\nvisual field frequently fail to notice shapes or words that are\nflashed up elsewhere (Mack & Rock, 1998). In Rensink et\nal.\u2019s \u2018change blindness\u2019 paradigm the\nparticipants need to see an alternating pair of pictures between ten\nand twenty times before they can identify a large but narratively\ninconsequential difference between them (Rensink et al.,\n1997, Rensink, 2002). In the most memorable of these experiments a\nlarge number of participants fail to notice the central appearance of\na man in a gorilla suit when their attention is taken up with the\nbusiness of counting the number of passes made by one of two teams in\na concurrent basketball-type game (Simons & Chabdris, 1999).\n\nNo single one of these experiments can establish the claim that\nattention is always necessary for consciousness. That claim is a\nuniversally quantified one, and is not entailed by any one of its\ninstances. Nor is it clear that what we see in these experiments\nreally are instances in which unattended objects drop out of\nconsciousness altogether. The participants\u2019 ignorance of the\ngorilla\u2019s appearance, for example, is compatible with it being\nthe case that the presence of the gorilla does make a\nphenomenal difference to their inattentive experience. To explain\nthose participants\u2019 ignorance we need only say that any\nphenomenal difference that the unattended gorilla makes is a\ndifference that the participants are unable to use in answering the\nexperimenter\u2019s question about whether anything strange happened\nin the scene. It may be a phenomenal difference that is epistemically\nunusable because it is immediately forgotten (see Wolfe, 1998) or it\nmay, alternatively, be a difference that is unusable because it is too\nunstructured and inchoate to be epistemically mobilizable. In that\ncase the effect of inattention would be inattentional\nagnosia, rather than inattentional blindness (see\nSimons, 2000).\n\nAbsolute amnesia for unattended items, or thoroughgoing agnosia for\nthem, may be indistinguishable from inattentional blindness, both\nbehaviourally and from the point of view of retrospective\nintrospection. For that reason it is not a straightforward matter for\nthe advocates of any of these interpretations of the inattentional\nblindness and change blindness effects to rule out the alternative\ninterpretations. Subpersonal sources of data (such as experiments\nusing neuroimaging) may be the only sources of data that we have to go\non. (See Rees, et al. 1999, for an example in which fMRI data\nis used to argue against the amnesia interpretation of inattentional\nblindness effects involving written words).\n\nIt is only narratively insignificant differences that go unnoticed in\nthe change-blindness paradigm. Change blindness effects might\ntherefore be taken as showing, not that there is no consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, but that there is consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, the contents of which are restricted to the\nscene\u2019s overall gist. There are difficulties in adjudicating\nbetween these two interpretations experimentally. When features of\ngist do seem to be perceived, in the apparent absence of attention,\nthe defender of the claim that attention is necessary for\nconsciousness may reply by claiming that attention has been paid to\nthese items, either in a dispersed, non-focal way (Prettyman, 2013),\nor because these features are briefly and involuntarily\nattention-catching (Prinz, 2012, p. 119). Without an experimental\noperationalization of complete inattention, these rival\ninterpretations cannot be ruled out, with the result that empirical\ndebates about the extent of consciousness beyond attention are\ncurrently in something of deadlock, with experimenters being able to\nclaim only to have demonstrated perception in the \u2018near\nabsence\u2019 of attention (Li et al., 2002, Reddy et\nal., 2004, Reddy et al., 2006), and so providing only\ninconclusive support to the hypothesis that attention and\nconsciousness are dissociable (Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007).\n\nThe methodological puzzle that we face when trying to settle the\ndispute between different interpretations of the inattentional and\nchange blindness effects raises the question of whether our\ncommonsense beliefs about the conscious status of unattended items are\nwell founded. Such beliefs seem to vary from person to person\n(Schwitzgebel, 2007), and to vary with certain features of the context\nin which they are probed (De Brigard, 2010). To the extent that we\nfind it natural to suppose that unattended items do figure in\nconsciousness, this may simply be owing to a version of the\n\u2018refrigerator-light illusion\u2019: If our reason for believing\nthat we are conscious of the things to which we pay no attention is a\nreason that depends on our finding that we are conscious of those\nthings whenever we check on them then that belief is on shaky ground.\nA checking procedure cannot provide us with good evidence about the\nstatus of unattended items since the act of checking is itself an act\nthat involves a shift in attention to the things checked\n(O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb, 2001).\n\nSince a direct checking procedure is ruled out we need a more\ntheory-driven way of assessing the dispute between those who claim\nthat the consequence of not attending to an item is that the item\ndrops out of conscious experience and those who claim that inattention\nsimply puts the subject in a poor epistemic position vis-\u00e0-vis\nthese unattended items. The current state of our theories is such that\nit would be premature to try to settle this dispute by an inference to\nthe best explanation, since neither side of the dispute has a theory\nof the attention/consciousness relation that has been worked out to a\ndegree that would allow the different explanations to be compared. We\ncan, however, see some of the considerations that the two sides in\nthis debate might invoke. Those who endorse the idea that attention is\nnecessary for consciousness can point to the fact that this view\naccords well with theories in which attention features prominently in\nthe explanation of consciousness (e.g., Prinz, 2005, 2012). They may\nalso be able to develop arguments based on theories of the way in\nwhich consciousness and attention evolved (Montemayor & Haladjian,\n2015). Those who prefer the epistemic-deficit interpretation of the\ninattentional blindness effects (Mole, 2011, \u00a77.3.7) can point to\nthe fact that that interpretation flows naturally from the view\naccording to which attention to an item provides the sort of\nacquaintance that is needed for the use of a demonstrative concept\nthat refers to that item (a view advocated by Campbell, 2002, and\ndiscussed in section\n 3.2\n below): If attention to the gorilla is necessary for the forming of a\ndemonstrative-involving thought (such as \u2018That\u2019s a\ngorilla\u2019) then there is an immediate explanation, consistent\nwith the idea that unattended items nonetheless feature in\nconsciousness, for the fact that inattentive people are unable to\nanswer questions such as \u2018Was there a gorilla?\u2019.\n\nThe difficulty in the case of the unnoticed gorilla is to discern\nwhether unattended items are present to consciousness but present only\nas unindividuated items to which no demonstrative reference has yet\nbeen directed, or whether those unattended items are instead absent\nfrom consciousness altogether. Part of this difficulty originates in\nthe fact that, although most people give no attention to the gorilla,\nthey could attend to him, and would have done so if anything\nhad prompted them to do so. More data may be available, both to\nintrospection and to laboratory measurement, in cases where our\nfailure to attend has some more systemic explanation. Ned Block has\nsuggested that one such case is found in our perception of peripheral\nstimuli, when these are subject to the phenomenon of \u2018identity\ncrowding\u2019 (Block, 2013a). An individual \u2018T\u2019 or\n\u2018F\u2019 can be seen reasonably clearly, even when presented in\na peripheral part of the visual field. But if additional characters\nare presented alongside this individual character, then the properties\nof those characters become prone to perceptual confusion. Attention\nseems to bind together properties from all of the characters in the\nvicinity of the one individual that we are trying to pick out. It\ntherefore seems that, in the perceptual periphery, attention cannot be\ndirected onto a region that fits an individual character tightly. Due\nto this \u2018crowding\u2019 effect, individual letters or shapes\nbecome impossible to individuate from the others with which they are\nclustered, when they fall into parts of the visual field that are\noutside of the high-definition centre. The properties of objects that\nare crowded in this way can nonetheless be seen, and the fact that\nseveral items are present can be reliably reported. On the basis of\nempirical and introspective considerations, Block claims that, even in\ncases where the crowded characters share all of their features with\nthe others by which they are crowded, these crowded characters are\nconsciously discriminated from their surroundings. He claims that\nthese characters figure as objects in consciousness. Since attention\ncannot be allocated to anything more fine-grained than the crowd of\nwhich these characters are a part, the characters are not themselves\nobjects to which attention is paid. Block therefore takes\n\u2018identity crowding\u2019 to give counterexamples to the claim\nthat we are conscious of objects only when paying attention to\nthem.\n\nBlock\u2019s claim that the crowded characters figure in\nconsciousness as individuated objects, rather than as parts of some\nfeature-rich texture, has been contested (Taylor, 2013, Richards,\n2013). In response, Block has suggested that an inference the best\nexplanation of several related phenomena favours his interpretation of\nthe effect (Block, 2013b).\n\nInference to the best explanation is always a hazardous business,\nespecially in the vicinity of an explanatory gap. In the\ninterpretation of identity crowding, as in the interpretation of\ninattentional blindness, the inescapability of abductive\nconsiderations suggests that our answer to the question of whether\nattention is necessary for consciousness may have to wait until we\nhave a better understanding of the relation of attention to\ndemonstrative reference (of the sort that is involved in thinking\n\u2018That\u2019s a gorilla\u2019), and perhaps until we have a\nbetter understanding of attention\u2019s role in epistemology more\ngenerally. (See\n sections 3.3 & 3.4 ,\n below.)\n3.1.2 Is Attention Sufficient for Consciousness?\n\nIn addition to disputes about whether we are conscious of\nonly those things to which we attend, there are also disputes\nabout whether we are conscious of everything to which we\nattend. If we were then a complete theory of attention might be given\nby giving an account of the way in which attention modulates\nconsciousness.\n\nDeclan Smithies has argued in favour of a position according to which\neverything that is attended to is consciously attended to. He claims\nthat all instances of attention must be consciousness-involving, on\nthe grounds that (1) all such instances must have a connection with\ntheir subject\u2019s \u2018rational-access\u2019 to the contents of\nher experience, and (2) there is no connection to rationality in the\ncase of processing that is wholly unconscious. Smithies\u2019 view\nis, therefore, that attention is essentially involved in the\n\u2018rational-access\u2019 of consciously experienced contents\n(Smithies, 2011). The nature of any such connection between attention\nto an experience and the justificatory force of that experience is\nitself a source of ongoing controversy: Johannes Roesller has argued\nthat John McDowell\u2019s theory of perceptual experience\u2019s\nreason-giving force cannot account for the role played by attention in\nexperience (Roessler, 2011); Susanna Siegel and Nicholas Silins have\nclaimed that the doxastic influence of an experience can be an\ninstance of rational access even when that experience receives no\nattention (Siegel & Silins, 2014); Terry Horgan and Matja\u017e\nPotr\u010d have argued that the justification of beliefs by experience\nmust outrun both the contents of attention and the contents of\nconsciousness (Horgan and Potr\u010d 2011). Here, as above,\none\u2019s understanding of attention and one\u2019s understanding\nof epistemology constrain one another, and may provide a theory-driven\nroute by which to settle questions about the possibility of\nunconscious attentiveness.\n\nThe claim that all attention is conscious attention sits uneasily with\ncertain empirical results indicating that consciousness is not\nrequired for the operation of those psychological processes that are\nresponsible for certain effects that are usually taken to be\nsignatures of attention. In an experiment by Yi Jiang et al.,\n(2006), for example, participants are presented with\nattention-attracting stimuli in such a way that, thanks to an\narrangement of mirrors, these stimuli are given to just one eye.\nBecause a more vivid stimulus is presented to the other eye, and\nbecause this more vivid stimulus wins the competition for\nconsciousness that occurs in such cases of binocular rivalry, these\nexperimental participants do not consciously experience the less vivid\nstimulus. Those unconsciously processed stimuli include erotic\nphotographs. And those photographs do seem to elicit shifts of\nattention, despite being unseen, as is evidenced by the fact that\nconsciously experienced stimuli that are presented in the same\nlocation as these unseen attention-grabbers are more accurately\nresponded to in an attention demanding task (involving detecting the\norientation of gabor-patches). One striking finding from Jiang et\nal.\u2019s experiments is that the way in which these unseen\nphotographs attract and repel attention depends on the sexual\norientation of the experimental participants.\n\nA natural interpretation of these experiments is as showing that the\nerotic pictures capture the participants\u2019 attention, despite the\nfact that those participants have no conscious experience of them.\nThis suggests\u2014although it does not conclusively\ndemonstrate\u2014that one may be attending to a thing without being\nconscious of it. The same conclusion is suggested by a quite different\nset of experiments involving a patient with blindsight.\u00a0 These\nexperiments show that, even though the blindsighted patient has no\nexperience of cues presented in his scotoma, those cues can elicit the\nfacilitation of processing and reduction of reaction times that are\nusually taken to be the signatures of attention (Kentridge &\nHeywood, 2001, Kentridge et al., 2004).\n\nOne complaint against both these lines of evidence is that they do not\nenable us to distinguish between attention to a thing and attention\nthat is directed to a part of space (in which that thing happens to\nbe), with the result that they cannot demonstrate attention to a\nthing in the absence of consciousness of that same thing (Mole,\n2008a). Research by Liam Norman, Charles Heywood and Robert Kentridge\ngoes some way towards addressing this complaint. Norman, Heywood and\nKentridge present normal participants with a screen showing an array\nof small, rapidly flickering Gabor patches. Objects the boundaries of\nwhich are defined by changes in the orientations of these patches are\nnot consciously experienced: Participants merely see the whole screen\nas a flickering array of patches. Cues that direct the attention of\nthose participants do nonetheless seem to draw attention to these\nunseen objects, as indicated by differences in the response times to\nitems that are subsequently presented in and outside of their\nboundaries (Norman, Heywood & Kentridge, 2013).\n\nSuch experiments show that there is an influence operating between\nunconscious processing and the direction of attention, and perhaps\nindicate that attention can be paid to objects that make no showing in\nconscious experience (Mole, 2014a). They therefore place a limit on\nthe closeness of the relationship that can be claimed to exist between\nattention and consciousness.\n\nThe disputes about whether attention is sufficient for consciousness,\nnecessary for consciousness, or both, are related to questions about\nattention\u2019s metaphysics. The claim that attention is not\nsufficient for consciousness is typically made as part of a defence of\nthe idea that attention and consciousness are underpinned by two\ndistinct brain processes, which can occur independently (see, e.g.,\nKoch and Tsuchiya, 2007). The claim that the things to which we attend\nare a proper subset of the things that appear in our consciousness is\nrequired by those who, like Locke (see Section\n 1.3),\n think that there is a process of conscious thinking, and that this\nconstitutes attention when it happens in a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd the claim that attention is both necessary and sufficient for\nconsciousness is required by those who think that the process by which\nthings come to consciousness is identical to the process by which\nattention is allocated (Prinz, 2005, 2011). Some scientific theories\nof consciousness also carry strong commitments concerning its\nrelationship to attention: Taylor Webb and Michael Graziano emphasize\nthese commitments in making the empirical case for their\n\u2018Attention-Schema\u2019 theory, according to which\nconsciousness emerges from processes in which the control of attention\nrequires a schematic representation of the way in which attention is\nbeing allocated (Graziano and Webb, 2014; Webb and Graziano,\n2015).\n3.1.3 How Does Attention Modulate Phenomenology?\n\nWhether or not one thinks that attention is always responsible for\nbringing things into our consciousness, there are good reasons to\nthink that changes in the direction of our attention can make some\ndifference to the character of conscious experience. Phenomenologists\nand Gestalt psychologists have characterized this difference in\nvarious ways, with Maurice Merleau-Ponty emphasizing the way in which\nattention can configure the figure/ground structure of perceived space\n(Merleau-Ponty, 1962, Chp.3\u20134), and Aron Gurwitsch (Gurwitsch,\n1964) elaborating a theory in which the configuration given by\nattention has a more complex, three-part structure (explained in\nArvidson, 2006). In the second half of his 2017 book, Sebastian Watzl\ndevelops a similar suggestion, on the basis of his claim that the role\nof attention is to impose a priority structure on our mental lives\n(see above\n \u00a72.4),\n (Watzl, 2011, 2017).\n\nThere is currently some dispute about whether the differences made by\nshifts of attention can be adequately characterized as differences in\nthe content of the attended experience. If, as Watzl\ncontends, they cannot, then phenomena of attention create a serious\ndifficulty for any fully general attempts to explain the character of\nconscious experience by reference to the contents represented in it\n(Chalmers, 2004).\u00a0 Such explanations might still be viable in\ncircumscribed domains (Speaks, 2010).\n\nA series of studies by Marisa Carrasco and her collaborators have\nexamined the influence of attention on the character of conscious\nexperience. These have revealed that the phenomenal differences\nproduced by shifts of attention include differences of perceived\nbrightness, contrast, and saturation of colours, but do not include\ndifferences of hue (Carrasco, Ling & Read, 2004, Fuller &\nCarrasco, 2006). Ned Block has suggested that these perceived\ndifferences should not be thought of as differences in the\ncontent of experience, since to characterize them in that way\nwould be to take it that attending to an item creates an illusion as\nto its brightness, contrast, etc.; a result which he takes to be\nimplausible. Block therefore interprets Carrasco\u2019s findings as\nindicating an aspect of experience that cannot be accounted for with a\ntheory in which the phenomenal character of an experience is a\nfunction of that experience\u2019s content (Block 2010).\n\nThere have been similar disputes, transacted on the basis of more\nintrospective considerations, concerning the effects of attention on\nthe perception of ambiguous figures (such as the Necker Cube). In\nresponse to some considerations that were first raised by Fiona\nMacpherson (Macpherson, 2006), Bence Nanay has suggested that the\neffects of attention on the perception of such figures can be\nexplained by those who maintain that every difference in consciousness\nis a difference of content (Nanay, 2010, 2011). His contention is that\nthe effects of attention on the character of conscious experience\nshould be understood as including a modulation of the specificity of\nan experience\u2019s content, in which the representations of\ndeterminable properties are made more or less determinate. The issues\nhere are similar to those concerning the way in which blurriness\nshould be thought to enter into visual experience (see Section 4.4 of\nthe entry on\n representational theories of consciousness).\n\nMattia Riccardi casts attention in a rather different phenomenological\nrole, suggesting (in opposition to the proposal of Matthen, 2010) that\nattention explains the presentness that differentiates\none\u2019s perceptual experiences of real objects in one\u2019s\nimmediate environment from one\u2019s experiences of objects that are seen\nin photographs, or that are pictured by the mind\u2019s eye during\nepisodes of vivid imagination (Riccardi, 2019).\n",
