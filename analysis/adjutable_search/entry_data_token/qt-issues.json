Introduction\n\nDespite its status as a core part of contemporary physics, there is no\nconsensus among physicists or philosophers of physics on the question\nof what, if anything, the empirical success of quantum theory is\ntelling us about the physical world. This gives rise to the collection\nof philosophical issues known as \u201cthe interpretation of quantum\nmechanics\u201d. One should not be misled by this terminology into\nthinking that what we have is an uninterpreted mathematical formalism\nwith no connection to the physical world. Rather, there is a common\noperational core that consists of recipes for calculating\nprobabilities of outcomes of experiments performed on systems\nsubjected to certain state preparation procedures. What are often\nreferred to as different \u201cinterpretations\u201d of quantum\nmechanics differ on what, if anything, is added to the common core.\nTwo of the major approaches, hidden-variables theories and collapse\ntheories, involve formulation of physical theories distinct from\nstandard quantum mechanics; this renders the terminology of\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d even more inappropriate.\n\nMuch of the philosophical literature connected with quantum theory\ncenters on the problem of whether we should construe the theory, or a\nsuitable extension or revision of it, in realist terms, and, if so,\nhow this should be done. Various approaches to what is called the\n\u201cMeasurement Problem\u201d propose differing answers to these\nquestions. There are, however, other questions of philosophical\ninterest. These include the bearing of quantum nonlocality on our\nunderstanding of spacetime structure and causality, the question of\nthe ontological character of quantum states, the implications of\nquantum mechanics for information theory, and the task of situating\nquantum theory with respect to other theories, both actual and\nhypothetical. In what follows, we will touch on each of these topics,\nwith the main goal being to provide an entry into the relevant\nliterature, including the Stanford Encyclopedia entries on these\ntopics. Contemporary perspectives on many of the issues touched on in\nthis entry can be found in The Routledge Companion to Philosophy\nof Physics (Knox and Wilson, eds., 2021); The Oxford Handbook\nof the History of Quantum Interpretations (Freire, et al. eds.,\n2022) contains essays on the history of discussions of these\nissues.\n2. Quantum Theory\n\nIn this section we present a brief introduction to quantum theory; see\nthe entry on\n quantum mechanics\n for a more detailed introduction.\n2.1 Quantum states and classical states\n\nIn classical physics, with any physical system is associated a state\nspace, which represents the totality of possible ways of assigning\nvalues to the dynamical variables that characterize the state of the\nsystem. For systems of a great many degrees of freedom, a complete\nspecification of the state of the system may be unavailable or\nunwieldy; classical statistical mechanics deals with such a situation\nby invoking a probability distribution over the state space of the\nsystem. A probability distribution that assigns any probability other\nthan one or zero to some physical quantities is regarded as an\nincomplete specification of the state of the system. In quantum\nmechanics, things are different. There are no quantum states that\nassign definite values to all physical quantities, and probabilities\nare built into the standard formulation of the theory.\n\nIn formulating a quantum theory of some system, one usually begins\nwith the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulation of the classical\nmechanical theory of that system. In the Hamiltonian formulation of\nclassical mechanics, the configuration of a system is represented by a\nset of coordinates. These could be, for example, the positions of each\nof a set of point particles, but one can also consider more general\ncases, such as angular coordinates that specify the orientation of a\nrigid body. For every coordinate there is an associated conjugate\nmomentum. If the coordinate indicates the position of some\nobject, the momentum conjugate to that coordinate may be what we\nusually call \u201cmomentum,\u201d that is, the velocity of the body\nmultiplied by its mass. If the coordinate is an angle, the momentum\nconjugate to it is an angular momentum.\n\nConstruction of a quantum theory of a physical system proceeds by\nfirst associating the dynamical degrees of freedom with\noperators. These are mathematical objects on which operations\nof multiplication and addition are defined, as well as multiplication\nby real and complex numbers. Another way of saying this is that the\nset of operators forms an algebra. Typically, it is said that\nan operator represents an observable, and the result of an\nexperiment on a system is said to yield a value for some observable.\nTwo or more observables are said to be compatible if there is\nsome possible experiment that simultaneously yields values for all of\nthem. Others require mutually exclusive experiments; these are said to\nbe incompatible.\n\nOf course, in a classical theory, the dynamical quantities that define\na state also form an algebra also, as they can be multiplied and\nadded, and multiplied by real or complex numbers. Quantum mechanics\ndiffers from classical mechanics in that the order of multiplication\nof operators can make a difference.  That is, for some operators\n\\(A\\),\\(B\\), the product \\(AB\\) is not equal to the product \\(BA.\\) If\n\\(AB = BA,\\) the operators are said to commute.\n\nThe recipe for constructing a quantum theory of a given physical\nsystems prescribes algebraic relations between the operators\nrepresenting the dynamical variables of the system. Compatible\nobservables are associated with operators that commute with each\nother. Operators representing conjugate variables are required to\nsatisfy what are called the canonical commutation relations.\nIf \\(q\\) is some coordinate, and \\(p\\) its conjugate\nmomentum, the operators \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) representing them\nare required to not commute. Instead, the difference between\n\\(PQ\\) and \\(QP\\) is required to be a multiple of the\nidentity operator (that is, the operator \\(I\\) that satisfies,\nfor all operators \\(A\\), \\(IA = AI).\\)\n\nA quantum state is a specification, for every experiment that\ncan be performed on the system,  of probabilities for the\npossible outcomes of that experiment. These can be summed up as an\nassignment of an expectation value to each observable. These states\nare required to be linear. This means that, if an operator\n\\(C\\), corresponding to some observable, is the sum of operators\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), corresponding to other observables, then\nthe expectation value that a quantum state assigns to \\(C\\) must\nbe the sum of the expectation values assigned to \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\). This is a nontrivial constraint, as it is required to hold\nwhether or not the observables represented are compatible. A quantum\nstate, therefore, relates expectation values for quantities yielded by\nincompatible experiments.\n\nIncompatible observables, represented by noncommuting operators, give\nrise to uncertainty relations; see the entry on\n the uncertainty principle.\n These relations entail that there are no quantum states that assign\ndefinite values to the observables that satisfy them, and place bounds\non how close they can come to be simultaneously well-defined in any\nquantum state.\n\nFor any two distinct quantum states, \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\omega\\), and any\nreal number between 0 and 1, there is a corresponding mixed\nstate. The probability assigned to any experimental outcome by\nthis mixed state is \\(p\\) times the probability it is assigned by\n\\(\\rho\\) plus \\(1-p\\) times the probability assigned to it by\n\\(\\omega\\). One way to physically realize the preparation of a mixed\nstate is to employ a randomizing device, for example, a coin with\nprobability \\(p\\) of landing heads and probability \\(1-p\\) of\nlanding tails, and to use it to choose between preparing state\n\\(\\rho\\) and preparing state \\(\\omega\\). We will see another way to\nprepare a mixed state after we have discussed entanglement, in section\n3. A state that is not a mixture of any two distinct states is called\na pure state.\n\nIt is both useful and customary, though not strictly necessary, to\nemploy a Hilbert space representation of a quantum theory. In\nsuch a representation, the operators corresponding to observables are\nrepresented as acting on elements of an appropriately constructed\nHilbert space (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n for details). Usually, the Hilbert space representation is\nconstructed in such a way that vectors in the space represent pure\nstates; such a representation is called an irreducible\nrepresentation. Irreducible representations, in which mixed\nstates are also represented by vectors, are also possible.\n\nA Hilbert space is a vector space. This means that, for any two\nvectors \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) , in the space,\nrepresenting pure states, and any complex numbers \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\), there is another vector,  \\(a |\\psi\\rangle + b\n|\\phi\\rangle\\), that also represents a pure state. This is called a\nsuperposition of the states represented by \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\)\nand \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) . Any vector in a Hilbert space can be written as\na superposition of other vectors in infinitely many ways. Sometimes,\nin discussing the foundations of quantum mechanics, authors fall into\ntalking as if some state are superpositions and others are not. This\nis simply an error. Usually what is meant is that some states yield\ndefinite values for macroscopic observables, and others cannot be\nwritten in any way that is not a superposition of macroscopically\ndistinct states.\n\nThe noncontroversial operational core of quantum theory consists of\nrules for identifying, for any given system, appropriate operators\nrepresenting its dynamical quantities. In addition, there are\nprescriptions for evolving the state of system when it is acted upon\nby specified external fields or subjected to various manipulations\n(see\n section 1.3).\n Application of quantum theory typically involves a distinction\nbetween the system under study, which is treated quantum mechanically,\nand experimental apparatus, which is not. This division is sometimes\nknown as the Heisenberg cut.\n\nWhether or not we can expect to be able to go beyond the\nnoncontroversial operational core of quantum theory, and take it to be\nmore than a means for calculating probabilities of outcomes of\nexperiments, remains a topic of contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion.\n2.2 Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory\n\nQuantum mechanics is usually taken to refer to the quantized\nversion of a theory of classical mechanics, involving systems with a\nfixed, finite number of degrees of freedom. Classically, a field, such\nas, for example, an electromagnetic field, is a system endowed with\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom. Quantization of a field theory\ngives rise to a quantum field theory. The chief philosophical\nissues raised by quantum mechanics remain when the transition is made\nto a quantum field theory; in addition, new interpretational issues\narise. There are interesting differences, both technical and\ninterpretational, between quantum mechanical theories and quantum\nfield theories; for an overview, see the entries on\n quantum field theory\n and\n quantum theory: von Neumann vs. Dirac.\n\nThe standard model of quantum field theory, successful as it is, does\nnot yet incorporate gravitation. The attempt to develop a theory that\ndoes justice both the quantum phenomena and to gravitational phenomena\ngives rise to serious conceptual issues (see the entry on\n quantum gravity).\n2.3 Quantum state evolution\n2.3.1 Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg pictures\n\nWhen constructing a Hilbert space representation of a quantum theory\nof a system that evolves over time, there are some choices to be made.\nOne needs to have, for each time t, a Hilbert space\nrepresentation of the system, which involves assigning operators to\nobservables pertaining to time t. An element of convention\ncomes in when deciding how the operators representing observables at\ndifferent times are to be related.\n\nFor concreteness, suppose that have a system whose observables include\na position, \\(x\\), and momentum, \\(p\\), with respect to some\nframe of reference. There is a sense in which, for two distinct times,\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\), position at time \\(t\\) and\nposition at time \\(t'\\) are distinct observables, and also\na sense in which they are values, at different times, of the same\nobservable. Once we have settled on operators \\(\\hat{X}\\) and\n\\(\\hat{P}\\) to represent position and momentum at time \\(t\\), we\nstill have a choice of which operators represent the corresponding\nquantities at time \\(t.\\)  On the Schr\u00f6dinger\npicture, the same operators \\(\\hat{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\) are used\nto represent position and momentum, whatever time is considered.  As\nthe probabilities for results of experiments involving these\nquantities may be changing with time, different vectors must be used\nto represent the state at different times.\n\nThe equation of motion obeyed by a quantum state vector is the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. It is constructed by first forming\nthe operator \\(\\hat{H}\\)corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem, which represents the total energy of the system. The rate of\nchange of a state vector is proportional to the result of operating on\nthe vector with the Hamiltonian operator \\(\\hat{H}\\).\n\n\\[ i \\hbar {\\,\\D}/{\\D t}\\, \\ket{\\psi (t)} = \\hat{H} \\ket{\\psi (t)}. \\]\n\n\nThere is an operator that takes a state at time 0 into a state at time\n\\(t\\); it is given by \n\n\\[ U(t) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{{-}i H t}{\\hbar}\\right). \\]\n\n\nThis operator is a linear operator that implements a one-one mapping\nof the Hilbert space to itself that preserves the inner product of any\ntwo vectors; operators with these properties are called unitary\noperators, and, for this reason, evolution according to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is called unitary evolution.\n\nFor our purposes, the most important features of this equation is that\nit is deterministic and linear. The state vector at\nany time, together with the equation, uniquely determines the state\nvector at any other time. Linearity means that, if two vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(0)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(0)}\\) evolve into vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t) }\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\), respectively, then, if\nthe state at time 0 is a linear combination of these two, the state at\nany time \\(t\\) will be the corresponding linear\ncombination of \\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\).\n\\[ a\\ket{\\psi_{1}(0)} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}(0)} \\rightarrow a\\ket{\\psi_{1}(t)} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}(t)} . \\]\n\nThe Heisenberg picture, on the other hand, employs different operators\n\\(\\hat{X}(t)\\), \\(\\hat{X}(t')\\) for position, depending on the time\nconsidered (and similarly for momentum and other observables). If\n\\(\\hat{A}(t)\\)is a family of Heisenberg picture operators representing\nsome observable at different times, the members of the family \nsatisfy the Heisenberg equation of motion,\n\n\\[\ni \\hbar d/dt \\; \\hat{A}(t) = \\hat{A}(t) \\hat{H} - \\hat{H} \\hat{A}(t).\n\\]\n\n\nOne sometimes hears it said that, on the Heisenberg picture, the state\nof the system is unchanging. This is incorrect. It is true that there\nare not different state vectors corresponding to different times, but\nthat is because a single state vector serves for computing\nprobabilities for all observables pertaining to all times. These\nprobabilities do change with time.\n2.3.2. The collapse postulate\n\nAs mentioned, standard applications of quantum theory involve a\ndivision of the world into a system that is treated within quantum\ntheory, and the remainder, typically including the experimental\napparatus, that is not treated within the theory. Associated with this\ndivision is a postulate about how to assign a state vector after an\nexperiment that yields a value for an observable, according to which,\nafter an experiment, one replaces the quantum state with an eigenstate\ncorresponding to the value obtained.  Unlike the unitary\nevolution applied otherwise, this is a discontinuous change of the\nquantum state, sometimes referred to as collapse of the state\nvector, or state vector reduction. There are two\ninterpretations of the postulate about collapse, corresponding to two\ndifferent conceptions of quantum states. If a quantum state represents\nnothing more than knowledge about the system, then the collapse of the\nstate to one corresponding to an observed result can be thought of as\nmere updating of knowledge. If, however, quantum states represent\nphysical reality, in such a way that distinct pure states always\nrepresent distinct physical states of affairs, then the collapse\npostulate entails an abrupt, perhaps discontinuous, change of the\nphysical state of the system. Considerable confusion can arise if the\ntwo interpretations are conflated.\n\nThe collapse postulate occurs already in the general discussion at the\nfifth Solvay Conference in 1927 (see Bacciagaluppi and Valentini, 2009,\n437\u2013450). It is also found in Heisenberg\u2019s The\nPhysical Principles of the Quantum Theory, based on lectures\npresented in 1929 (Heisenberg, 1930a, 27; 1930b, 36). Von Neumann, in\nhis reformulation of quantum theory a few years later, distinguished\nbetween two types of processes: Process 1:, which occurs upon\nperformance of an experiment, and Process 2:, the unitary evolution\nthat takes place as long as no measurement is made (von Neumann, 1932;\n1955, \u00a7V.I). He does not take this distinction to be a difference\nbetween two physically distinct processes. Rather, the invocation of\none process or the other depends on a somewhat arbitrary division of\nthe world into an observing part and an observed part (see von\nNeumann,1932, 224; 1955, 420).\n\nThe collapse postulate does not appear in the first edition (1930) of\nDirac\u2019s Principles of Quantum Mechanics; it is\nintroduced in the second edition (1935). Dirac formulates it as\nfollows.\n\n\nWhen we measure a real dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the disturbance\ninvolved in the act of measurement causes a jump in the state of the\ndynamical system. From physical continuity, if we make a second\nmeasurement of the same dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\) immediately after\nthe first, the result of the second measurement must be the same as\nthat of the first. Thus after the first measurement has been made,\nthere is no indeterminacy in the result of the second. Hence, after\nthe first measurement has been made, the system is in an eigenstate of\nthe dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the eigenvalue it belongs to being\nequal to the result of the first measurement. This conclusion must\nstill hold if the second measurement is not actually made. In this way\nwe see that a measurement always causes the system to jump into an\neigenstate of the dynamical variable that is being measured, the\neigenvalue this eigenstate belongs to being equal to the result of the\nmeasurement (Dirac 1935: 36).\n\n\nUnlike von Neumann and Heisenberg, Dirac is treating the\n\u201cjump\u201d as a physical process.\n\nNeither von Neumann nor Dirac take awareness of the result by a\nconscious observer to be a necessary condition for collapse. For von\nNeumann, the location of the cut between the \u201cobserved\u201d\nsystem and the \u201cobserver\u201dis somewhat arbitrary. It may be\nplaced between the system under study and the experimental apparatus.\nOn the other hand, we could include the experimental apparatus in the\nquantum description, and place the cut at the moment when light\nindicating the result hits the observer\u2019s retina. We could also\ngo even further, and include the retina and relevant parts of the\nobserver\u2019s nervous system in the quantum system. That the cut\nmay be pushed arbitrarily far into the perceptual apparatus of the\nobserver is required, according to von Neumann, by the principle\nof psycho-physical parallelism.\n\nA formulation of a version of the collapse postulate according to\nwhich a measurement is not completed until the result is observed is\nfound in London and Bauer (1939). For them, as for Heisenberg, this is\na matter of an increase of knowledge on the part of the observer.\n\nWigner (1961) combined elements of the two interpretations. Like those\nwho take the collapse to be a matter of updating of belief in light of\ninformation newly acquired by an observer, he takes collapse to take\nplace when a conscious observer becomes aware of an experimental\nresult. However, like Dirac, he takes it to be a real physical\nprocess. His conclusion is that consciousness has an influence on the\nphysical world not captured by the laws of quantum mechanics. This\ninvolves a rejection of von Neumann\u2019s principle of\npsycho-physical parallelism, according to which it must be possible to\ntreat the process of subjective perception as if it were a physical\nprocess like any other.\n\nThere is a persistent misconception that, for von Neumann, collapse is\nto be invoked only when a conscious observer becomes aware of the\nresult. As noted, this is the opposite of his view, as the cut may be\nplaced between the observed system and the experimental apparatus, and\nit is for him an important point that the location of the cut be\nsomewhat arbitrary. In spite of this, von Neumann\u2019s position is\nsometimes conflated with Wigner\u2019s speculative proposal, and\nWigner\u2019s proposal is sometimes erroneously referred to as the\nvon Neumann-Wigner interpretation.\n\nNone of the standard formulations are precise about when the collapse\npostulate is to be applied; there is some lee-way as to what is to\ncount as an experiment, or (for versions that require reference to an\nobserver) what is to count as an observer. Some, including von Neumann\nand Heisenberg, have taken it to be a matter of principle that there\nbe some arbitrariness in where to apply the postulate. It is common\nwisdom that, in practice, this arbitrariness is innocuous. The rule of\nthumb that seems to be applied, in practice, in setting the split\nbetween the parts of the world treated quantum-mechanically and things\ntreated as classical objects has been formulated by J. S. Bell as,\n\u201c[w]hen in doubt enlarge the quantum system,\u201d to the point\nat which including more in the quantum system makes negligible\ndifference to practical predictions (Bell 1986, 362; Bell 2004, 189).\nIf anything is to be counted as \u201cstandard\u201d quantum\nmechanics, it is the operational core we have discussed, supplemented\nby a heuristic rule of application of this sort. Standard quantum\nmechanics works very well.  If, however, one seeks a theory that is\ncapable of describing all systems, including macroscopic ones, and can\nyield an account of the process by which macroscopic events, including\nexperimental outcomes, come about, this gives rise to the so-called\n\u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, which we will discuss after we have\nintroduced the notion of entanglement (see \n section 3).\n2.3.3. Wave functions\n\nAmong the Hilbert-space representations of a quantum theory are\nwave-function representations.\n\nAssociated with any observable is its spectrum, the range of\npossible values that the observable can take on.  Given any\nphysical system and any observable for that system, one can always\nform a Hilbert-space representation for the quantum theory of that\nsystem by considering complex-valued functions on the spectrum of that\nobservable.  The set of such functions form a vector space. Given\na measure on the spectrum of the observable, we can form a Hilbert space\nout of the set of complex-valued square-integrable functions on the\nspectrum by treating functions that differ only on a set of zero\nmeasure as equivalent (that is, the elements of our Hilbert space are\nreally equivalence classes of functions), and by using the measure to\ndefine an inner product (see\n entry on Quantum Mechanics\n if this terminology is unfamiliar).\n\nIf the spectrum of the chosen observable is a continuum (as it is, for\nexample, for position or momentum), a Hilbert-space representation of\nthis sort is called a wave function representation, and the\nfunctions that represent quantum states, wave functions (also\n\u201cwave-functions,\u201d or \u201cwavefunctions\u201d). The\nmost familiar representations of this form are position-space wave\nfunctions, which are functions on the set of possible configurations\nof the system, and momentum-space wave functions, which are functions\nof the momenta of the systems involved.\n3. Entanglement, nonlocality, and nonseparability\n\nGiven two disjoint physical systems, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nwith which we associate Hilbert spaces \\(H_{A}\\) and\n\\(H_{B}\\), the Hilbert space associated with the composite system is\nthe tensor product space, denoted \\(H_{A} \\otimes H_{B}\\).\n\nWhen the two systems are independently prepared in pure states\n\\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\), the state of the composite system\nis the product state \\(\\ket{\\psi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi}\\)\n(sometimes written with the cross, \\(\\otimes\\), omitted).\n\nIn addition to the product states, the tensor product space contains\nlinear combinations of product states, that is, state vectors of the\nform \n\n\\[ a\\ket{\\psi_{1}} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_{1}} + b\\ket{\\psi_{2}} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi_{2}} \\]\n\n\nThe tensor product space can be defined as the smallest Hilbert space\ncontaining all of the product states. Any pure state represented by a\nstate vector that is not a product vector is an entangled\nstate.\n\nThe state of the composite system assigns probabilities to outcomes of\nall experiments that can be performed on the composite system. We can\nalso consider a restriction to experiments performed on system \\(A\\),\nor a restriction to experiments performed to \\(B\\).  Such restrictions\nyields states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively, called the reduced\nstates of the systems. When the state of the composite system\n\\(AB\\) is an entangled state, then the reduced states of \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are mixed states. To see this, suppose that in the above state\nthe vectors \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\) represent\ndistinguishable states. If one confines one\u2019s attention to\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\), it makes no difference whether an\nexperiment is also performed on \\(B\\). An experiment performed on\n\\(B\\) that distinguishes \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\)\nprojects the state of \\(A\\) into either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities \\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and\n\\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively, and probabilities for outcomes of\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\) are the corresponding averages of\nprobabilities for states \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\). These probabilities, as mentioned, are the same as\nthose for the situation in which no experiment is performed on\n\\(B\\). Thus, even if no experiment is performed on \\(B\\), the\nprobabilities of outcomes of experiments on \\(A\\) are exactly as if\nsystem \\(A\\) is either in the state represented by \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\)\nor the state represented by \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities\n\\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and \\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively.\n\nIn general, any state, pure or mixed, that is neither a product state\nnor a mixture of product states, is called an entangled\nstate.\n\nThe existence of pure entangled states means that, if we consider a\ncomposite system consisting of spatially separated parts, then, even\nwhen the state of the system is a pure state, the state is not\ndetermined by the reduced states of its component parts. Thus, quantum\nstates exhibit a form of nonseparability. See the entry on\n holism and nonseparability in physics\n for more information.\n\nQuantum entanglement results in a form of nonlocality that is alien to\nclassical physics. Even if we assume that the reduced states of \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) do not completely\ncharacterize their physical states, but must be supplemented by some\nfurther variables, there are quantum correlations that cannot be\nreduced to correlations between states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\);\nsee the entries on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem\n and\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics.\n4. The measurement problem\n4.1 The measurement problem formulated\n\nIf quantum theory is meant to be (in principle) a universal theory, it\nshould be applicable, in principle, to all physical systems, including\nsystems as large and complicated as our experimental apparatus. It is\neasy to show that linear evolution of quantum states, when applied to\nmacroscopic objects, will routinely lead to superpositions of\nmacroscopically distinct states. Among the circumstances in which this\nwill happen are experimental set-ups, and much of the early\ndiscussions focussed on how to construe the process of measurement in\nquantum-mechanical terms. For this reason, the interpretational issues\nhave come to be referred to as the measurement problem. In\nthe first decades of discussion of the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, it was commonly referred to as the problem of\nobservation.\n\nConsider a schematized experiment. Suppose we have a quantum system\nthat can be prepared in at least two distinguishable states, \\(\\ket{0}\n_{S}\\) and \\(\\ket{1} _{S}\\). Let \\(\\ket{R} _{A}\\) be a ready state of\nthe apparatus, that is, a state in which the apparatus is ready to\nmake a measurement.\n\nIf the apparatus is working properly, and if the measurement is a\nminimally disturbing one, the coupling of the system \\(S\\)\nwith the apparatus \\(A\\) should result\nin an evolution that predictably yields results of the form\n\n\\[ \\ket{0} _{S} \\ket{R} _{A} \\Rightarrow \\ket{0}\n_{S}\\ket{\u201c0\u201d } _{A} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ket{1} _{S} \\ket{R} _{A} \\Rightarrow \\ket{1}\n_{S}\\ket{\u201c1\u201d} _{A} \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ket{\u201c0\u201d } _{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{\u201c1\u201d}\n_{A}\\) are apparatus states indicating results 0 and 1,\nrespectively.\n\nNow suppose that the system \\(S\\) is prepared in a\nsuperposition of the states \\(\\ket{0} _{S}\\) and \\(\\ket{1}_{S}\\).\n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi(0)} _{S} = a\\ket{0} _{S} + b\\ket{1} _{S}, \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both nonzero.\nIf the evolution that leads from the pre-experimental state to the\npost-experimental state is linear Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, then we\nwill have \n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi(0)} _{S} \\ket{R} _{A} \\rightarrow a\\ket{0} _{S}\n\\ket{\u201c0\u201d } _{A} + b\\ket{1} _{S}\\ket{\u201c1\u201d }\n_{A}. \\]\n\n\nThis is not an eigenstate of the instrument reading variable, but is,\nrather, a state in which the reading variable and the system variable\nare entangled with each other. The eigenstate-eigenvalue link, applied\nto a state like this, does not yield a definite result for the\ninstrument reading. The problem of what to make of this is called the\n\u201cmeasurement problem\u201d which is discussed in more detail\nbelow.\n4.2 Approaches to the measurement problem\n\nIf quantum state evolution proceeds via the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nor some other linear equation, then, as we have seen in the previous\nsection, typical experiments will lead to quantum states that are\nsuperpositions of terms corresponding to distinct experimental\noutcomes. It is sometimes said that this conflicts with our\nexperience, according to which experimental outcome variables, such as\npointer readings, always have definite values. This is a misleading\nway of putting the issue, as it is not immediately clear how to\ninterpret states of this sort as physical states of a system that\nincludes experimental apparatus, and, if we can\u2019t say what it\nwould be like to observe the apparatus to be in such a state, it makes\nno sense to say that we never observe it to be in a state like\nthat.\n\nNonetheless, we are faced with an interpretational problem. If we take\nthe quantum state to be a complete description of the system, then the\nstate is, contrary to what would antecedently expect, not a state\ncorresponding to a unique, definite outcome. This is what led J.S.\nBell to remark, \u201cEither the wavefunction, as given by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, is not everything, or it is not\nright\u201d (Bell 1987: 41, 2004: 201). This gives us a (prima\nfacie) tidy way of classifying approaches to the measurement\nproblem:\n\nThere are approaches that involve a denial that a quantum wave\nfunction (or any other way of representing a quantum state) yields a\ncomplete description of a physical system.\nThere are approaches that involve modification of the dynamics to\nproduce a collapse of the quantum state in appropriate\ncircumstances.\nThere are approaches that reject both horns of Bell\u2019s\ndilemma, and hold that quantum states undergo unitary evolution at all\ntimes and that a quantum state-description is, in principle,\ncomplete.\n\n\nWe include in the first category approaches that deny that a quantum\nstate should be thought of as representing anything in reality at all.\nThese include variants of the Copenhagen interpretation, as well as\npragmatic and other anti-realist approaches. Also in the first\ncategory are approaches that seek a completion of the quantum state\ndescription. These include hidden-variables approaches and modal\ninterpretations. The second category of interpretation motivates a\nresearch programme of finding suitable indeterministic modifications\nof the quantum dynamics. Approaches that reject both horns of\nBell\u2019s dilemma are typified by Everettian, or\n\u201cmany-worlds\u201d interpretations.\n4.2.1 The \u201cCopenhagen interpretation\u201d\n\nSince the mid-1950\u2019s, the term \u201cCopenhagen\ninterpretation\u201d has been commonly used for whatever it is that\nthe person employing the term takes to be the \u2018orthodox\u2019\nviewpoint regarding the philosophical issues raised by quantum\nmechanics. According to Howard (2004), the phrase was first used by\nHeisenberg (1955, 1958), and is intended to suggest a commonality of\nviews among Bohr and his associates, included Born and Heisenberg\nhimself. Recent historiography has emphasized diversity of viewpoints\namong the figures associated with the Copenhagen interpretation; see\nthe entry on\n Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n and references therein. Readers should be aware that the term is not\nunivocal, and that different authors might mean different things when\nspeaking of the\u201cCopenhagen interpretation.\u201d\n4.2.2 Non-realist and pragmatist approaches to quantum mechanics\n\nFrom the early days of quantum mechanics, there has been a strain of\nthought that holds that the proper attitude to take towards quantum\nmechanics is an instrumentalist or pragmatic one. On such a view,\nquantum mechanics is a tool for coordinating our experience and for\nforming expectations about the outcomes of experiments. Variants of\nthis view include some versions of the Copenhagen interpretation. More\nrecently, views of this sort have been advocated by physicists,\nincluding QBists, who hold that quantum states represent subjective or\nepistemic probabilities (see Fuchs et al., 2014). The\nphilosopher Richard Healey defends a related view on which quantum\nstates, though objective, are not to be taken as\nrepresentational  (see Healey 2012, 2017a, 2020). For more on\nthese approaches, see entry on\n Quantum-Bayesian and pragmatist views of quantum theory.\n4.2.2 Hidden-variables and modal interpretations\n\nTheories whose structure include the quantum state but include\nadditional structure, with an aim of circumventing the measurement\nproblem, have traditionally been called \u201chidden-variables\ntheories\u201d. That a quantum state description cannot be regarded\nas a complete description of physical reality was argued for in a\nfamous paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) and by Einstein in\nsubsequent publications (Einstein 1936, 1948, 1949). See the entry on\nthe\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory.\n\nThere are a number of theorems that circumscribe the scope of possible\nhidden-variables theories. The most natural thought would be to seek a\ntheory that assigns to all quantum observables definite values that\nare merely revealed upon measurement, in such a way that any\nexperimental procedure that, in conventional quantum mechanics, would\ncount as a \u201cmeasurement\u201d of an observable yields the\ndefinite value assigned to the observable. Theories of this sort are\ncalled noncontextual hidden-variables theory. It was shown by\nBell (1966) and Kochen and Specker (1967) that there are no such\ntheories for any system whose Hilbert space dimension is greater than\nthree (see the entry on\n the Kochen-Specker theorem).\n\nThe Bell-Kochen-Specker Theorem does not rule out hidden-variables\ntheories tout court. The simplest way to circumvent it is to\npick as always-definite some observable or compatible set of\nobservables that suffices to guarantee determinate outcomes of\nexperiments; other observables are not assigned definite values and\nexperiments thought of as \u201cmeasurements\u201d of these\nobservables do not reveal pre-existing values.\n\nThe most thoroughly worked-out theory of this type is the pilot wave\ntheory developed by de Broglie and presented by him at the Fifth\nSolvay Conference held in Brussels in 1927, revived by David Bohm in\n1952, and currently an active area of research by a small group of\nphysicists and philosophers. According to this theory, there are\nparticles with definite trajectories, that are guided by the quantum\nwave function. For the history of the de Broglie theory, see the\nintroductory chapters of Bacciagaluppi and Valentini (2009). For an\noverview of the de Broglie-Bohm theory and philosophical issues\nassociated with it see the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics.\n\nThere have been other proposals for supplementing the quantum state\nwith additional structure; these have come to be called modal\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n4.2.3 Dynamical Collapse Theories\n\nAs already mentioned,  Dirac wrote as if the collapse of the\nquantum state vector precipitated by an experimental intervention on\nthe system is a genuine physical change, distinct from the usual\nunitary evolution. If collapse is to be taken as a genuine physical\nprocess, then something more needs to be said about the circumstances\nunder which it occurs than merely that it happens when an experiment\nis performed. This gives rise to a research programme of formulating a\nprecisely defined dynamics for the quantum state that approximates the\nlinear, unitary Schr\u00f6dinger evolution in situations for which\nthis is well-confirmed, and produces collapse to an eigenstate of the\noutcome variable in typical experimental set-ups, or, failing that, a\nclose approximation to an eigenstate. The only promising collapse\ntheories are stochastic in nature; indeed, it can be shown that a\ndeterministic collapse theory would permit superluminal signalling.\nSee the entry on\n collapse theories\n for an overview, and Gao, ed. (2018) for a snapshot of contemporary\ndiscussions.\n\nPrima facie, a dynamical collapse theory of this type can be\na quantum state monist theory, one on which, in Bell\u2019s words,\n\u201cthe wave function is everything\u201d. In recent years, this\nhas been disputed; it has been argued that collapse theories require\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d in addition to the quantum state. See\nAllori et al. (2008), Allori (2013), and also the entry on\n collapse theories,\n and references therein. Reservations about this approach have been\nexpressed by Egg (2017, 2021), Myrvold (2018), and Wallace \n(2020).\n4.2.4 Everettian, or \u201cmany worlds\u201d theories\n\nIn his doctoral dissertation of 1957 (reprinted in Everett 2012), Hugh\nEverett III proposed that quantum mechanics be taken as it is, without\na collapse postulate and without any \u201chidden variables\u201d.\nThe resulting interpretation he called the relative state\ninterpretation.\n\nThe basic idea is this. After an experiment, the quantum state of the\nsystem plus apparatus is typically a superposition of terms\ncorresponding to distinct outcomes. As the apparatus interacts with\nits environment, which may include observers, these systems become\nentangled with the apparatus and quantum system, the net result of\nwhich is a quantum state involving, for each of the possible\nexperimental outcomes, a term in which the apparatus reading\ncorresponds to that outcome, there are records of that outcome in the\nenvironment, observers observe that outcome, etc.. Everett\nproposed that each of these terms be taken to be equally real. From a\nGod\u2019s-eye-view, there is no unique experimental outcome, but one\ncan also focus on a particular determinate state of one subsystem,\nsay, the experimental apparatus, and attribute to the other systems\nparticipating in the entangled state a relative state,\nrelative to that state of the apparatus. That is, relative to the\napparatus reading \u2018+\u2019 is a state of the environment\nrecording that result and states of observers observing that result\n(see the entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics,\n for more detail on Everett\u2019s views).\n\nEverett\u2019s work has inspired a family of views that go by the\nname of \u201cMany Worlds\u201d interpretations; the idea is that\neach of the terms of the superposition corresponds to a coherent\nworld, and all of these worlds are equally real. As time goes on,\nthere is a proliferation of these worlds, as situations arise that\ngive rise to a further multiplicity of outcomes (see the entry\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n and Saunders 2007, for overviews of recent discussions; Wallace 2012\nis an extended defense of an Everettian interpretation of quantum\nmechanics).\n\nThere is a family of distinct, but related views, that go by the name\nof \u201cRelational Quantum Mechanics\u201d. These views agree with\nEverett in attributing to a system definite values of dynamical\nvariables only relative to the states of other systems; they differ in\nthat, unlike Everett, they do not take the quantum state as their\nbasic ontology (see the entry on\n relational quantum mechanics\n for more detail).\n4.3 Extended Wigner\u2019s friend scenarios as a source of no-go theorems\n\nAs mentioned, quantum theory, as standardly formulated, employs a\ndivision of the world into a part that is treated with the theory, and\na part that is not. Both von Neumann and Heisenberg emphasized an\nelement of arbitrariness in the location of the division. In some\nformulations, the division was thought of as a distinction between\nobserver and observed, and it became common to say that quantum\nmechanics requires reference to an observer for its formulation.\n\nThe founders of quantum mechanics tended to assume implicitly that,\nthough the \u201ccut\u201d is somewhat moveable, in any given\nanalysis a division would be settled on, and one would not attempt to\ncombine distinct choices of the cut in one analysis of an experiment.\nIf, however, one thinks of the cut as marking the distinction between\nobserver and observed, one is led to ask about situations involving\nmultiple observers. Is each observer permitted to treat the other as a\nquantum system?\n \nThe consideration of such scenarios was initiated by Wigner\n(1961).  Wigner considered a hypothetical scenario in which a friend\nconducts an observation, and he himself treats the joint system,\nconsisting of the friend and the system experimented upon, as a\nquantum system. For this reason, scenarios of this sort have come to\nbe known as \u201cWigner\u2019s friend\u201d scenarios.  Wigner was\nled by consideration of such scenarious to hypothesize that conscious\nobservers cannot be in a superposition of states corresponding to\ndistinct perceptions; the introduction of conscious observers\ninitiates a physical collapse of the quantum state; this involves,\naccording to Wigner, \u201ca violation of physical laws where\nconsciousness plays a role\u201d (Wigner 1961, 294 ;167, 181).  \n \nFrauchiger and Renner (2018) initiated the discussion of scenarios\nof this sort involving more than two observers, which have come to be\ncalled \u201cextended Wigner\u2019s friend\u201d scenarios. Further\nresults along these lines include Brukner (2018), Bong et al. (2020),\nand Gu\u00e9rin et al. (2021). The strategy of these investigations\nis to present some set of plausible-seeming assumptions (a different\nset, for each of the works cited), and to show, via consideration of a\nhypothetical situation involving multiple observers, the inconsistency\nof that set of assumptions. The theorems are, therefore, no-go\ntheorems for approaches to the measurement problem that would seek to\nsatisfy all of the members of the set of assumptions that has been\nshown to be inconsistent.\n\nAn assumption common to all of these investigations is that it is\nalways permissible for one observer to treat systems containing other\nobservers within quantum mechanics and to employ unitary evolution for\nthose systems. This means that collapse is not regarded as a physical\nprocess. It is also assumed that each observer always perceives a\nunique outcome for any experiment performed by that observer; this\nexcludes Everettian interpretations. Where the works cited vary is in\nthe other assumptions made.\n\n\nIt should be noted that each of the major avenues of approach to the\nmeasurement problem is capable of giving an account of goings-on in\nany physical scenario, including the ones considered in these works.\nEach of them, therefore, must violate some member of the set of\nassumptions shown to be inconsistent. These results do not pose\nproblems for existing approaches to the measurement problem; rather,\nthey are no-go theorems for approaches that might seek to satisfy all\nof the set of assumptions shown to be inconsistent. As the assumptions\nconsidered include both unitary evolution and unique outcomes of\nexperiments, and the scenarios considered involved situations\ninvolving superpositions of distinct experimental outcomes, these\nresults concern theories on which the quantum state, as given by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, is not a complete description of reality,\nas it fails to determine the unique outcomes perceived by the\nobservers. These preceptions could be thought of as supervening on\nbrain states, in which case there is physical structure not included\nin the quantum state, or as attributes of immaterial minds. On either\ninterpretation, the sorts of theories ruled out fall under the first\nhorn of Bell\u2019s dilemma, mentioned in section 4.2, and these\nno-go results in part reproduce, and in part extend, no-go results for\ncertain sorts of modal interpretations (see entry on\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics).\n\nThese results involving extended Wigner\u2019s friend scenarios have engendered\nconsiderable philosophical discussion; see Sudbery (2017, 2019),\nHealey (2018, 2020), Dieks (2019), Losada et al. (2019), Dascal\n(2020), Evans (2020), Fortin and Lombardi (2020), Kastner (2020),\nMuci\u00f1o & Okon (2020), Bub (2020, 2021), Cavalcanti (2021),\nCavalcanti and Wiseman (2021), and \u017bukowski and Markiewicz\n(2021).\n4.4 The role of decoherence\n\nA quantum state that is a superposition of two distinct terms, such\nas \n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi} = a \\ket{\\psi_{1}} + b \\ket{\\psi_{2}} , \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\) are distinguishable\nstates, is not the same state as a mixture of \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), which would be appropriate for a situation in\nwhich the state prepared was either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), but we don\u2019t know which. The difference\nbetween a coherent superposition of two terms and a mixture has\nempirical consequences. To see this, consider the double-slit\nexperiment, in which a beam of particles (such as electrons, neutrons,\nor photons) passes through two narrow slits and then impinges on a\nscreen, where the particles are detected. Take \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) to\nbe a state in which a particle passes through the top slit, and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), a state in which it passes through the bottom\nslit. The fact that the state is a superposition of these two\nalternatives is exhibited in interference fringes at the screen,\nalternating bands of high and low rates of absorption.\n\nThis is often expressed in terms of a difference between classical and\nquantum probabilities. If the particles were classical particles, the\nprobability of detection at some point \\(p\\) of the\nscreen would simply be a weighted average of two conditional\nprobabilities: the probability of detection at \\(p\\),\ngiven that the particle passed through the top slit, and the\nprobability of detection at \\(p\\), given that the\nparticle passed through the bottom slit. The appearance of\ninterference is an index of nonclassicality.\n\nSuppose, now, that the electrons interact with something else (call it\nthe environment) on the way to the screen, that could serve\nas a \u201cwhich-way\u201d detector; that is, the state of this\nauxiliary system becomes entangled with the state of the electron in\nsuch a way that its state is correlated with \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\). Then the state of the quantum system, \\(s\\),\nand its environment, \\(e\\), is\n\n\\[ \\ket{\\psi} _{se} = a \\ket{ \\psi_{1}} _{s} \\ket{ \\phi_{1}} _{e} + b \\ket{ \\psi_{2}}_{s} \\ket{ \\phi_{2}} _{e} \\]\n\n\nIf the environment states \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}} _{e}\\) are\n\\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}_{e}\\) are distinguishable states, then this\ncompletely destroys the interference fringes: the particles interact\nwith the screen as if they determinately went through one slit or the\nother, and the pattern that emerges is the result of overlaying the\ntwo single-slit patterns. That is, we can treat the particles as if\nthey followed (approximately) definite trajectories, and apply\nprobabilities in a classical manner.\n\nNow, macroscopic objects are typically in interaction with a large and\ncomplex environment\u2014they are constantly being bombarded with air\nmolecules, photons, and the like. As a result, the reduced state of\nsuch a system quickly becomes a mixture of quasi-classical states, a\nphenomenon known as decoherence.\n\nA generalization of decoherence lies at the heart of an approach to\nthe interpretation of quantum mechanics that goes by the name of\ndecoherent histories approach (see the entry on\n the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics\n for an overview).\n\nDecoherence plays important roles in the other approaches to quantum\nmechanics, though the role it plays varies with approach; see the\nentry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics\n for information on this.\n4.5 Comparison of approaches to the measurement problem\n\nMost of the above approaches take it that the goal is to provide an\naccount of events in the world that recovers, at least in some\napproximation, something like our familiar world of ordinary objects\nbehaving classically. None of the mainstream approaches accord any\nspecial physical role to conscious observers. There have,\nhowever, been proposals in that direction (see the entry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness\n for discussion).\n\nAll of the above-mentioned approaches are consistent with observation.\nMere consistency, however, is not enough; the rules for connecting\nquantum theory with experimental results typically involve nontrivial\n(that is, not equal to zero or one) probabilities assigned to\nexperimental outcomes. These calculated probabilities are confronted\nwith empirical evidence in the form of statistical data from repeated\nexperiments. Extant hidden-variables theories reproduce the quantum\nprobabilities, and collapse theories have the intriguing feature of\nreproducing very close approximations to quantum probabilities for all\nexperiments that have been performed so far but departing from the\nquantum probabilities for other conceivable experiments. This permits,\nin principle, an empirical discrimination between such theories and\nno-collapse theories.\n\nA criticism that has been raised against Everettian theories is that\nit is not clear whether they can even make sense of statistical\ntesting of this kind, as it does not, in any straightforward way, make\nsense to talk of the probability of obtaining, say, a \u2018+\u201d\noutcome of a given experiment when it is certain that all possible\noutcomes will occur on some branch of the wavefunction. This has been\ncalled the \u201cEverettian evidential problem\u201d. It has been\nthe subject of much recent work on Everettian theories; see Saunders\n(2007) for an introduction and overview.\n\nIf one accepts that Everettians have a solution to the evidential\nproblem, then, among the major lines of approach, none is favored in a\nstraightforward way by the empirical evidence. There will not be space\nhere to give an in-depth overview of these ongoing discussions, but a\nfew considerations can be mentioned, to give the reader a flavor of\nthe discussions; see entries on particular approaches for more\ndetail.\n\nEverettians take, as a virtue of the approach, the fact that it does\nnot involve an extension or modification of the quantum formalism.\nBohmians claim, in favor of the Bohmian approach, that a theory on\nthese lines provides the most straightforward picture of events;\nontological issues are less clear-cut when it comes to Everettian\ntheories or collapse theories.\n\nAnother consideration is compatibility with relativistic causal\nstructure. See Myrvold (2021) for an overview of relavistic\nconstraints on approaches to the measurement problem.The de\nBroglie-Bohm theory requires a distinguished relation of distant\nsimultaneity for its formulation, and, it can be argued, this is an\nineliminable feature of any hidden-variables theory of this sort, that\nselects some observable to always have definite values (see Berndl\net al. 1996; Myrvold 2002, 2021). On the other hand, there\nare collapse models that are fully relativistic. On such models,\ncollapses are localized events. Though probabilities of collapses at\nspacelike separation from each other are not independent, this\nprobabilistic dependence does not require us to single one out as\nearlier and the other later. Thus, such theories do not require a\ndistinguished relation of distant simultaneity. There remains,\nhowever, some discussion of how to equip such theories with beables\n(or \u201celements of reality\u201d). See the entry on\n collapse theories\n and references therein; see also, for some recent contributions to\nthe discussion, Fleming (2016), Maudlin (2016), and Myrvold\n(2016).  In the case of Everettian theories, one must first think\nabout how to formulate the question of relativistic locality. Several\nauthors have approached this issue in somewhat different ways, with a\ncommon conclusion that Everettian quantum mechanics is, indeed, local.\n(See Vaidman 1994; Bacciagaluppi 2002; Chapter 8 of Wallace 2012; Tipler\n2014; Vaidman 2016; and Brown and Timpson 2016.)\n5. Ontological Issues\n\nAs mentioned, a central question of interpretation of quantum\nmechanics concerns whether quantum states should be regarded as\nrepresenting anything in physical reality. If this is answered in the\naffirmative, this gives rise to new questions, namely, what sort of\nphysical reality is represented by the quantum state, and whether a\nquantum state could in principle give an exhaustive account of\nphysical reality.\n5.1 The question of quantum state realism.\n\nHarrigan and Spekkens (2010) have introduced a framework for\ndiscussing these issues. In their terminology, a complete\nspecification of the physical properties is given by the ontic\nstate of a system. An ontological model posits a space of ontic\nstates and associates, with any preparation procedure, a probability\ndistribution over ontic states. A model is said to be\n\\(\\psi\\)-ontic if the ontic state uniquely determines the\nquantum state; that is, if there is a function from ontic states to\nquantum states (this includes both cases in which the quantum state\nalso completely determines the physical state, and cases, such as\nhidden-variables theories, in which the quantum state does not\ncompletely determine the physical state). In their terminology, models\nthat are not \\(\\psi\\)-ontic are called \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic. If\na model is not \\(\\psi\\)-ontic, this means that it is possible for some\nontic states to be the result of two or more preparations that lead to\ndifferent assignments of pure quantum states; that is, the same ontic\nstate may be compatible with distinct quantum states.\n\nThis gives a nice way of posing the question of quantum state realism:\nare there preparations corresponding to distinct pure quantum states\nthat can give rise to the same ontic state, or, conversely, are there\nontic states compatible with distinct quantum states? Pusey, Barrett,\nand Rudolph (2012) showed that, if one adopts a seemingly natural\nindependence assumption about state preparations\u2014namely, the\nassumption that it is possible to prepare a pair of systems in such a\nway that the probabilities for ontic states of the two systems are\neffectively independent\u2014then the answer is negative; any\nontological model that reproduces quantum predictions and satisfies\nthis Preparation Independence assumption must be a \\(\\psi\\)-ontic\nmodel.\n\nThe Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) theorem does not close off all\noptions for anti-realism about quantum states; an anti-realist about\nquantum states could reject the Preparation Independence assumption,\nor reject the framework within which the theorem is set; see\ndiscussion in Spekkens (2015): 92\u201393. See Leifer (2014) for a\ncareful and thorough overview of theorems relevant to quantum state\nrealism, and Myrvold (2020) for a presentation of a case for quantum\nstate realism based on theorems of this sort.\n5.2 Ontological category of quantum states\n\nThe major realist approaches to the measurement problem are all, in\nsome sense, realist about quantum states. Merely saying this is\ninsufficient to give an account of the ontology of a given\ninterpretation. Among the questions to be addressed are: if quantum\nstates represent something physically real, what sort of thing is it?\nThis is the question of the ontological construal of quantum states.\nAnother question is the EPR question, whether a description in terms\nof quantum states can be taken as, in principle, complete, or whether\nit must be supplemented by different ontology.\n\nDe Broglie\u2019s original conception of the \u201cpilot wave\u201d\nwas that it would be a field, analogous to an electromagnetic field.\nThe original conception was that each particle would have its own\nguiding wave. However, in quantum mechanics as it was developed at the\nhands of Schr\u00f6dinger, for a system of two or more particles there\nare not individual wave functions for each particle, but, rather, a\nsingle wave function that is defined on \\(n\\)-tuples of\npoints in space, where \\(n\\) is the number of\nparticles. This was taken, by de Broglie, Schr\u00f6dinger and others,\nto militate against the conception of quantum wave functions as\nfields. If quantum states represent something in physical reality,\nthey are unlike anything familiar in classical physics.\n\nOne response that has been taken is to insist that quantum wave\nfunctions are fields nonetheless, albeit fields on a space of\nenormously high dimension, namely, \\(3n\\), where \\(n\\)\nis the number of elementary particles in the universe. On this view,\nthis high-dimensional space is thought of as more fundamental than the\nfamiliar three-dimensional space (or four-dimensional spacetime) that\nis usually taken to be the arena of physical events. See Albert (1996,\n2013), for the classic statement of the view; other proponents include\nLoewer (1996), Lewis (2004), Ney (2012, 2013a,b, 2021), and North\n(2013). Most of the discussion of this proposal has taken place within\nthe context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is not a\nfundamental theory. It has been argued that considerations of how the\nwave functions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics arise from a\nquantum field theory undermines the idea that wave functions are\nrelevantly like fields on configuration space, and also the idea that\nconfiguration spaces can be thought of as more fundamental than\nordinary spacetime (Myrvold 2015).\n\nA view that takes a wave function as a field on a high-dimensional\nspace must be distinguished from a view that takes it to be what Belot\n(2012) has called a multi-field, which assigns properties to\n\\(n\\)-tuples of points of ordinary three-dimensional\nspace. These are distinct views; proponents of the \\(3n\\)-dimensional\nconception make much of the fact that it restores Separability: on\nthis view, a complete specification of the way the world is, at some\ntime, is given by specification of local states of affairs at each\naddress in the fundamental (\\(3n\\)-dimensional) space. Taking a wave\nfunction to be a multi-field, on the other hand, involves accepting\nnonseparability. Another difference between taking wave-functions as\nmulti-fields on ordinary space and taking them to be fields on a\nhigh-dimensional space is that, on the multi-field view, there is no\nquestion about the relation of ordinary three-dimensional space to\nsome more fundamental space.\u00ad Hubert and Romano (2018) argue that\nwave-functions are naturally and straightforwardly construed as\nmulti-fields.\n\nIt has been argued that, on the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory and\nrelated pilot wave theories, the quantum state plays a role more\nsimilar to that of a law in classical mechanics; its role is to\nprovide dynamics for the Bohmian corpuscles, which, according to the\ntheory, compose ordinary objects. See D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and\nZangh\u00ec (1997),  Allori et al. (2008), Allori\n(2021).\n\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and Zangh\u00ec (1992) introduced the term\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d for what, according to a physical\ntheory, makes up ordinary physical objects; on the de Broglie-Bohm\ntheory, this is the Bohmian corpuscles. The conception is extended to\ninterpretations of collapse theories by Allori et al. (2008).\nPrimitive ontology is to be distinguished from other ontology, such as\nthe quantum state, that is introduced into the theory to account for\nthe behavior of the primitive ontology. The distinction is meant to be\na guide as to how to conceive of the nonprimitive ontology of the\ntheory.\n6. Quantum computing and quantum information theory\n\nQuantum mechanics has not only given rise to interpretational\nconundrums; it has given rise to new concepts in computing and in\ninformation theory. Quantum information theory is the study\nof the possibilities for information processing and transmission\nopened up by quantum theory. This has given rise to a different\nperspective on quantum theory, one on which, as Bub (2000, 597) put\nit, \u201cthe puzzling features of quantum mechanics are seen as a\nresource to be developed rather than a problem to be solved\u201d\n(see the entries on\n quantum computing\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n7. Reconstructions of quantum mechanics and beyond\n\nAnother area of active research in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics is the attempt to gain deeper insight into the structure of\nthe theory, and the ways in which it differs from both classical\nphysics and other theories that one might construct, by characterizing\nthe structure of the theory in terms of very general principles, often\nwith an information-theoretic flavour.\n\nThis project has its roots in early work of Mackey (1957, 1963),\nLudwig (1964), and Piron (1964) aiming to characterize quantum\nmechanics in operational terms. This has led to the development of a\nframework of generalized probabilistic model. It also has connections\nwith the investigations into quantum logic initiated by Birkhoff and\nvon Neumann (1936) (see the entry\n quantum logic and probability theory\n for an overview).\n\nInterest in the project of deriving quantum theory from axioms with\nclear operational content was revived by the work of Hardy (2001\n[2008], Other Internet Resources). Significant results along these\nlines include the axiomatizations of Masanes and M\u00fcller (2011)\nand Chiribella, D\u2019Ariano, and Perinotti (2011). See Chiribella\nand Spekkens (2015) for an overview of this burgeoning research\narea.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albert, David Z., 1996, \u201cElementary quantum\nmetaphysics\u201d, in J.T.
