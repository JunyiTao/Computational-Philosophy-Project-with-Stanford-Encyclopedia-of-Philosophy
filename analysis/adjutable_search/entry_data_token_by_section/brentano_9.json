    "main_text": "The Impact of Brentano\u2019s Philosophy || Early Reception: The Brentano School\n7.2 Recent Reception: Rediscovering Brentano\n\nBrentano\u2019s impact in a larger philosophical audience was soon\neclipsed by that of his students who founded philosophical traditions\non their own: Husserl started the\n phenomenological movement,\n Meinong the Graz school, Twardowski the\n Lvov-Warsaw School.\n As a result, in the second half of the twentieth century Brentano was\noften mentioned as the philosopher who had (re-)introduced\nthe notion of intentionality, as \u201cgrandfather\u201d of the\nphenomenological movement, or for his influence on early analytic\nphilosophy, but his own philosophical views and arguments were hardly\ndiscussed. \n\nThere are notable exceptions to this tendency, though. Roderick\nChisholm, for example, made a continuous effort to show\nBrentano\u2019s significance to contemporary philosophy by adopting\nhis results in his own contributions to the philosophy of mind, but\nalso in presentations of various aspects of Brentano\u2019s thought\n(cf. Chisholm 1966, 1982, and 1986). Moreover, in recent decades the\ntradition that is often referred to as \u201cAustrian\nphilosophy\u201d has gained increasing interest in a broader\nphilosophical audience, which is due mainly to the work of Rudolf\nHaller, Barry Smith, Peter Simons, and Kevin Mulligan, among others.\nBy showing the systematic relevance of Brentano\u2019s (and other\nAustrian philosophers\u2019) contributions to problems discussed in\nontology, logic, the theory of emotions, or consciousness, they could\ncounteract the tendency to reduce Brentano\u2019s contributions to\nthe introduction of the notion of intentionality. \n\nIt is quite interesting to note, however, that in the last two decades\nthe philosophical contributions of Brentano have gained a new life as\nan increasing number of philosophers from different fields are\nrediscovering and elaborating on different themes from\nBrentano\u2019s work. His contributions to the philosophy of mind\nhave been taken up and play a central role in the debate concerning\nthe nature of consciousness and the relation between\n consciousness and intentionality,\n the\n unity of consciousness\n and\n time-consciousness;\n his views on ethics have been inspired\n fitting attitude theories of value,\n which analyze ethical value in terms of correct or incorrect forms of\napproval or disapproval. Moreover, the recent centenary of\nBrentano\u2019s death (2017) has given occasion to a number of\nconferences and publications that put Brentano\u2019s contribution at\nthe center of attention (cf., for example, Kriegel 2017). This shows\nthat the interest in Brentano\u2019s systematic contribution to\nphilosophy is still strong and vivid. \n",
