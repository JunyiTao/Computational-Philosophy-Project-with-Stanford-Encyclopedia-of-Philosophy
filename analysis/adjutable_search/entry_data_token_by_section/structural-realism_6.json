A group of symmetry\ntransformations is a mathematical entity comprising the set of\ntransformations, including the identity transformation and an inverse\nof each transformation, and the operation of composing them, where the\nresult of two composed transformations is also itself in the original\nset. Mathematical objects can be characterised in terms of which\nsymmetry transformations leave them unchanged or invariant, and\nsymmetries of various kinds are associated with physical laws (see the\nentry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking).\n Poincar\u00e9 first understood the Galilean and Lorentz\ntransformations as groups. These groups express fundamental features\nof reality, namely the dynamical symmetries of Newtonian and\nEinsteinian physics respectively. Poincar\u00e9 understands group\nstructure in Kantian terms as a pure form of the understanding in\naccordance with his epistemic form of structuralism.\n\nOther pioneers of structuralism shared his appreciation of the\nimportance of group theory in the metaphysics of physics. Cassirer\nheld that the possibility of talking of \u201cobjects\u201d in a\ncontext is the possibility of individuating invariants (1938 [1944]).\nSimilarly, Max Born says:\n\n\nInvariants are the concepts of which science speaks in the same way as\nordinary language speaks of \u2018things\u2019, and which it\nprovides with names as if they were ordinary things, (1953: 149)\n\n\nand:\n\n\nThe feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance\nof a structure independent of the aspect, the projection. (1953:\n149)\n\n\nHe goes so far as to say:\n\n\nI think the idea of invariant is the clue to a relational concept of\nreality, not only in physics but in every aspect of the world. (1953:\n144)\n\n\nEddington says:\n\n\nWhat sort of thing is it that I know? The answer is\nstructure. To be quite precise it is structure of the kind\ndefined and investigated in the mathematical theory of groups. (1939:\n147)\n\n\nThe idea then is that we have various representations of some physical\nstructure which may be transformed or translated into one another, and\nthen we have an invariant state under such transformations which\nrepresents the objective state of affairs. The group structure is\nprimary and the group representations constructed from this structure\nhave a derivative status. Representations are extraneous to physical\nstates but they allow our empirical knowledge of them. Objects are\npicked out by the identification of invariants with respect to the\ntransformations relevant to the context. Thus, on this view,\nelementary particles are hypostatisations of sets of quantities that\nare invariant under the symmetry groups of particle physics.\n\nFor example, one of the most fundamental distinctions between kinds of\nparticles is that between fermions and bosons. This was described\ngroup theoretically by Weyl and Wigner in terms of the group of\npermutations, and the former\u2019s approach to relativity theory was\nsimilarly group-theoretic. In the case of quantum mechanics Weyl\nasserts that:\n\n\nAll quantum numbers, with the exception of the so-called principal\nquantum number, are indices characterising representations of groups.\n(1928/1931 [1931: xxi])\n\n\nThe central point of philosophical relevance here is that the\nmathematical idea of invariance is taken by Weyl to characterise the\nnotion of objectivity. It is this that liberates physics from the\nparochial confines of a particular coordinate system. For Weyl\nappearances are open only to intuition (in the Kantian sense of\nsubjective perception) and therefore agreement is obtained by giving\nobjective status only to those relations that are invariant under\nparticular transformations.\n\nWeyl\u2019s views were revived by Sunny Auyang (1995) in an\nexplicitly neo-Kantian project which attempts to solve the problem of\nobjectivity in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QFT).\nAuyang seeks to extract the \u201cprimitive conceptual\nstructure\u201d in physical theories and she too finds it in what she\ncalls the \u201crepresentation-transformation-invariant\nstructure\u201d. This is essentially group-theoretic structure.\nAuyang, like Born and Weyl, thinks that such invariant structure under\ntransformations is what separates an objective state of affairs from\nits various representations, or manifestations to observers under\ndifferent perceptual conditions. According to her events are\nindividuated structurally.\n\nRyckman (2005) describes the history of relativity theory and\nWeyl\u2019s role in it. Ryckman argues that the work of Eddington and\nWeyl was profoundly influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl. The\nlatter also seems to have understood objectivity in terms of\ninvariance. (Ryckman calls Kantian structural realism\n\u201ctranscendental structuralism\u201d. OSR is what he calls\n\u201ctranscendent structuralism\u201d.) Group theory in the\ndevelopment of structuralism deserves further historical analysis. It\nplayed a crucial role in epistemological reflections on geometry in\nrelation to Klein\u2019s Erlanger programme (Birkhoff & Bennett\n1988). French (1998, 1999, 2000) and Castellani (1998a) have explored\nthe ontological representation of the fundamental objects of physics\nin terms of sets of group-theoretic invariants by Cassirer, Eddington,\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Weyl, Wigner, Piron, Jauch and others. See Bueno\n(2019), and Marquis (2020) for a recent discussion of structuralism in\nthe history of mathematics in which group theory played a prominent\nrole as it does in quantum field theory. On the other hand, Roberts\n(2011) criticizes the idea that structure can be understood as group\nstructure in the context of quantum physics. Others have used other\nparts of mathematics to understand structuralism. Hannes Leitgeb\n(2021) develops a non-eliminative structuralism about graphs. See\n \u00a74.2\n below for OSR and category theory, and\n \u00a74.4\n and\n \u00a76\n for OSR and information theory.\n",
