Deontic Logics\n\nDeontic logics introduce the primitive symbol \\(O\\) for \u2018it is\nobligatory that\u2019, from which symbols \\(P\\) for \u2018it is\npermitted that\u2019 and \\(F\\) for \u2018it is forbidden that\u2019\nare defined: \\(PA = {\\sim}O{\\sim}A\\) and \\(FA = O{\\sim}A\\). The\ndeontic analog of the modal axiom \\((M): OA\\rightarrow A\\) is clearly\nnot appropriate for deontic logic. (Unfortunately, what ought to be is\nnot always the case.) However, a basic system \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) of\ndeontic logic can be constructed by adding the weaker axiom \\((D)\\) to\n\\(\\bK\\). \n\\[\\tag{\\(D\\)}\n OA\\rightarrow PA\n\\]\n\n\nAxiom \\((D)\\) guarantees the consistency of the system of obligations\nby insisting that when \\(A\\) is obligatory, \\(A\\) is permissible. A\nsystem which obligates us to bring about \\(A\\), but doesn\u2019t\npermit us to do so, puts us in an inescapable bind. Although some will\nargue that such conflicts of obligation are at least possible, most\ndeontic logicians accept \\((D)\\).\n\n\\(O(OA\\rightarrow A)\\) is another deontic axiom that seems desirable.\nAlthough it is wrong to say that if \\(A\\) is obligatory then \\(A\\) is\nthe case \\((OA\\rightarrow A)\\), still, this conditional ought\nto be the case. So some deontic logicians believe that \\(D\\) needs to\nbe supplemented with \\(O(OA\\rightarrow A)\\) as well.\n\nControversy about iteration (repetition) of operators arises again in\ndeontic logic. In some conceptions of obligation, \\(OOA\\) just amounts\nto \\(OA\\). \u2018It ought to be that it ought to be\u2019 is treated\nas a sort of stuttering; the extra \u2018ought\u2019s do not add\nanything new. So axioms are added to guarantee the equivalence of\n\\(OOA\\) and \\(OA\\). The more general iteration policy embodied in\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) may also be adopted. However, there are conceptions of\nobligation where distinction between \\(OA\\) and \\(OOA\\) is preserved.\nThe idea is that there are genuine differences between the obligations\nwe actually have and the obligations we should\nadopt. So, for example, \u2018it ought to be that it ought to be that\n\\(A\\)\u2019 commands adoption of some obligation which may not\nactually be in place, with the result that \\(OOA\\) can be true even\nwhen \\(OA\\) is false.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n deontic logic.\n",
