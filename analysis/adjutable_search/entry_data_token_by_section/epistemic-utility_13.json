But many epistemological questions arise\nwhen we consider groups of individuals and their interactions. Here\nare two such questions for which we have epistemic utility arguments:\nDoes the group itself have a credence function, just as its individual\nmembers do, and if so how does relate to the credence functions of the\nmembers?\n (Section 5.6.1)\n How do we maximize the total epistemic utility across the group, and\ndoes this place constraints on the individuals?\n (Section 5.6.2).\n5.6.1 The epistemic utility of group credences\n\nIn everyday talk, we often ascribe beliefs and credences to groups of\nindividuals as well as to their members: the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change is 70% confident in such-and-such; the\nparliamentary subcommittee believes so-and-so. And we often think that\nthe credences of the individuals at least partly determine the\ncredences of the group. So suppose I must come up with precise\ncredences to ascribe to a group of individuals. The literature on\nprobabilistic judgment aggregation or opinion pooling offers a range\nof possibilities. For instance:\n\n\nLinear Pooling A group\u2019s credence function\nshould be a\n mixture\n of the members\u2019 credence functions.\n\n\nSarah Moss (2011) offers an epistemic utility argument for Linear\nPooling. She says that the group\u2019s credence function should be\nthe one that maximizes the group\u2019s expected epistemic utility,\nand she defines the group\u2019s expected epistemic utility to be a\nweighted arithmetic mean of the members\u2019 individual expected\nepistemic utilities. And then she proves that, providing our epistemic\nutility function is strictly proper, it is the mixture of the\nmembers\u2019 credence functions with these same weights that\nmaximizes this quantity.\n\nOne concern about this argument is that it assumes something too close\nto what it attempts to establish. It assumes that the members\u2019\nindividual expectations should be combined by weighted\narithmetic averaging and attempts to show that members\u2019\nindividual credence functions should be so combined.\nPettigrew (2017) offers a related argument that improves on\nMoss\u2019s in some ways, though makes very slightly stronger\nassumptions. The idea is that, whatever the group\u2019s credence\nfunction is, there had better not be an alternative that every member\nof the group expects to be better, epistemically speaking. He then\nshows that, if your epistemic utility function is continuous and\nstrictly proper, and if the group\u2019s credence function is not a\nmixture of the individuals\u2019 credence functions, then there is\nsuch an alternative. \n5.6.2 Maximizing total epistemic utility across the group's members\n\nAs well as asking about the epistemic utility of the group\u2019s\ncredences, we can also ask about the total accuracy of the\nmembers\u2019 credences. And this gives an argument for a\nsurprisingly strong norm (Kopec 2012):\n\n\nConsensus Rationality requires that all members of a\ngroup have the same credence function.\n\n\nThe argument is based on the fact that, if a group violates Consensus,\nso that at least two members disagree about some of their credences,\nthen there is a single credence function such that, if all members of\nthe group were to have it, their total epistemic utility would be\ngreater for sure.\n\nWe should take this argument with a pinch of salt. After all, one\nthing that people do is to investigate the world and collect evidence\nand then share their findings. They decide which evidence to collect\nby consulting their credences and asking which will maximize expected\nepistemic or pragmatic utility, as we saw in\n Section 5.3.4.\n And so the individuals in a group that satisfies Consensus will\nconduct the same sorts of investigations and acquire similar evidence,\nwhile a group with more diverse credences will conduct more diverse\ninvestigations and end up with more diverse evidence. And it might\nwell be that the benefits a group gets in the long run from collecting\ndiverse evidence might outweigh the disadvantage they get from lacking\nconsensus at the start (Zollman 2010).\n",
