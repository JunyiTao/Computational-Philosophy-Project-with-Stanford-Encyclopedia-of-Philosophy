One such account, owing to John von Neumann and Oskar\nMorgenstern (1944), will be cashed out in detail below. For now, it is\nuseful to focus on the kind of option that is key to understanding and\nconstructing a cardinal utility function:\n lotteries.[1]\n\nConsider first an ordering over three regular options, e.g., the three\nholiday destinations Amsterdam, Bangkok and Cardiff, denoted \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\) and \\(C\\) respectively. Suppose your preference ordering is\n\\(A\\prec B \\prec C\\). This information suffices to ordinally represent\nyour judgement; recall that any assignment of utilities is then\nacceptable as long as \\(C\\) gets a higher value than \\(B\\) which gets\na higher value than \\(A\\). But perhaps we want to know more than can\nbe inferred from such a utility function\u2014we want to know how\nmuch \\(C\\) is preferred over \\(B\\), compared to how much \\(B\\) is\npreferred over \\(A\\). For instance, it may be that Bangkok is\nconsidered almost as desirable as Cardiff, but Amsterdam is a long way\nbehind Bangkok, relatively speaking. Or else perhaps Bangkok is only\nmarginally better than Amsterdam, compared to the extent to which\nCardiff is better than Bangkok. This kind of information about the\nrelative distance between options, in terms of strength of preference\nor desirability, is precisely what is given by an interval-valued\nutility function. The problem is how to ascertain this\ninformation.\n\nTo solve this problem, Ramsey (1926) and later von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (hereafter vNM) made the following suggestion: we\nconstruct a new option, a lottery, \\(L\\), that has \\(A\\) and\n\\(C\\) as its possible \u201cprizes\u201d, and we figure out what\nchance the lottery must confer on \\(C\\) for you to be indifferent\nbetween this lottery and a holiday in Bangkok. The basic idea is that\nyour judgment about Bangkok, relative to Cardiff on the one hand and\nAmsterdam on the other, can be measured by the riskiness of the\nlottery \\(L\\) involving Cardiff and Amsterdam that you deem equally\ndesirable as Bangkok. For instance, if you are indifferent between\nBangkok and a lottery that provides a very low chance of winning a\ntrip to Cardiff, then you evidently do not regard Bangkok to be much\nbetter than Amsterdam, vis-\u00e0-vis Cardiff; for you, even a small\nimprovement on Amsterdam, i.e., a lottery with a small chance of\nCardiff rather than Amsterdam, is enough to match Bangkok.\n\nThe above analysis presumes that lotteries are evaluated in terms of\ntheir expected choice-worthiness or desirability. That is,\nthe desirability of a lottery is effectively the sum of the chances of\neach prize multiplied by the desirability of that prize. Consider the\nfollowing example: Suppose you are indifferent between the lottery and\nthe holiday in Bangkok when the chance of the lottery resulting in a\nholiday in Cardiff is \\(3/4\\). Call this particular lottery \\(L'\\).\nThe idea is that Bangkok is therefore three quarters of the way up a\ndesirability scale that has Amsterdam at the bottom and Cardiff at the\ntop. If we stipulate that \\(u(A)=0\\) and \\(u(C)=1\\), then\n\\(u(B)=u(L')=3/4\\). This corresponds to the expected\ndesirability\u2014or, as it is usually called, the expected\nutility\u2014of the lottery, since \\(1/4\\cdot 0 + 3/4\\cdot 1 =\n3/4 = u(L')\\). That is, the desirability of the lottery is a\nprobability weighted sum of the utilities of its prizes, where the\nweight on each prize is determined by the probability that the lottery\nresults in that prize.\n\nWe thus see that an interval-valued utility measure over options can\nbe constructed by introducing lottery options. As the name suggests,\nthe interval-valued utility measure conveys information about the\nrelative sizes of the intervals between the options according to some\ndesirability scale. That is, the utilities are unique after we have\nfixed the starting point of our measurement and the unit scale of\ndesirability. In the above example, we could have, for instance,\nassigned a utility value of 1 to \\(A\\) and 5 to \\(C\\), in which case\nwe would have had to assign a utility value of 4 to \\(B\\), since 4 is\n3/4 of the way between 1 and 5. In other words, once we have assigned\nutility values to \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), the utility of \\(L'\\) and thus\n\\(B\\) has been determined. Let us call this second utility function\n\\(u'\\). It is related to our original function as follows: \\(u'=4\\cdot\nu +1\\). This relationship always holds between two such functions: If\n\\(u\\) is an interval-valued utility function that represents a\npreference ordering, \\(\\preceq\\), and \\(u'\\) is another utility\nfunction that also represents this same preference ordering, then\nthere are constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a\\) must be positive,\nsuch that \\(u'=a\\cdot u + b\\). This is to say that interval-valued\nutility functions are unique only up to positive linear\ntransformation.\n\nBefore concluding this discussion of measuring utility, two related\nlimitations regarding the information such measures convey should be\nmentioned. First, since the utilities of options, whether ordinal or\ninterval-valued, can only be determined relative to the\nutilities of other options, there is no such thing as the\nabsolute utility of an option, at least not without further\n assumptions.[2]\n Second, by the same reasoning, neither interval-valued nor ordinal\nutility measures, as discussed here, are interpersonally\ncommensurable with respect to levels and units of utility. By way\nof a quick illustration, suppose that both you and I have the\npreference ordering described above over the holiday options: \\(A\\prec\nB \\prec C\\). Suppose too that, as per the above, we are both\nindifferent between \\(B\\) and the lottery \\(L'\\) that has a \\(3/4\\)\nchance of yielding \\(C\\) and a \\(1/4\\) chance of yielding \\(A\\). Can\nwe then say that granting me Cardiff and you Bangkok would amount to\nthe same amount of \u201ctotal desirability\u201d as granting you\nCardiff and me Bangkok? We are not entitled to say this. Our shared\npreference ordering is, for instance, consistent with me finding a\nvacation in Cardiff a dream come true while you just find it the best\nof a bad lot. Moreover, we are not even entitled to say that the\ndifference in desirability between Bangkok and Amsterdam is the same\nfor you as it is for me. According to me, the desirability of the\nthree options might range from living hell to a dream come true, while\naccording to you, from bad to quite bad; both evaluations are\nconsistent with the above preference ordering. In fact, the same might\nhold for our preferences over all possible options, including\nlotteries: even if we shared the same total preference ordering, it\nmight be the case that you are just of a negative\ndisposition\u2014finding no option that great\u2014while I am very\nextreme\u2014finding some options excellent but others a sheer\ntorture. Hence, utility functions, whether interval-valued or ordinal,\ndo not allow for meaningful interpersonal comparisons. (Elster and\nRoemer 1993 contains a number of papers discussing these issues; see\nalso the entry on\n social choice theory.)\n",
