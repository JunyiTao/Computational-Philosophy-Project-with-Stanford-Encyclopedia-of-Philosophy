    "main_text": "African Philosophy: Contributions\n4. African Philosophy: Contributions\n\n\nAs an ongoing project-of-projects, it would be unwise to attempt a\ncomprehensive and definitive catalog and assessment of the thematic\nfoci across the full range of articulations and discussions still being\ngathered and explored under the heading of \u201cAfrican\nphilosophy\u201d even as new discussions are emerging. Still, a number\nof developments are worth noting.\n\n\nSeveral canonical subfields of academic philosophical discourses\nstand to be enriched by the inclusion of explorations of\nsubject-matters within African contexts. As already noted, historical\naccounts of \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d in the so-called\n\u201cWest\u201d especially, are being reconsidered in light of\ncritical explorations of more recently disclosed relations between and\namong peoples and places in Africa and \u201cthe West\u201d or\nEurope\u2014among Greece, Rome, and Egypt definitely\u2014and in light of\nfurther explorations of the impact of such relations on even canonical\nthinkers in Europe. In general, the discussion of \u201cthe\norigin of philosophy\u201d in Ancient Greece must be replaced by\ncomparative explorations of the emergence of philosophizing in various\nsettings around planet earth, including pre-colonial North Africa,\nEthiopia (home of Zera Yacob and Walda Heyat, two seventeenth century\nphilosophers (Sumner 1976\u201378)), and places on the continent in which Arabic was a\nprincipal language.\n\n\nAs well, new questions should be posed and explored, among these the\nfollowing: How are canonical figures and subject-matters of the\nEuropean Enlightenments to be understood in light of the extensive\ninvolvements of European nation-states\u2014and of canonical\nfigures\u2014in colonial imperialism and the enslavement of African\npeoples? How did the centuries-long institutionalization of enslavement\naffect the philosophizing of various European thinkers with regard to\nnotions of freedom, the person, the citizen,\njustice, of manhood and womanhood? What was the impact on\ncanonical European thinkers of the presence among them of the\narticulated thought and the persons of such figures as Anton Wilhelm\nAmo (c. 1703\u20131758), a native of Ghana who, at age three, was\ntransported to the Netherlands to be educated and baptized in keeping\nwith colonial Dutch efforts to Christianize Africans? Amo settled in\nGermany and became a highly educated and influential\nteacher-philosopher. As more research and scholarship on such figures\nare completed, understandings of eighteenth century intellectual\ncommunities in Germany and elsewhere in Europe will have to be revised;\nso, too, notions of the meanings and influences of notions of\nrace and their impacts on intellectual productions as well as\non social life.\n\n\nWork in Africana philosophy in general, and African philosophy in\nparticular, compels comparative studies. No longer can it be presumed,\ncertainly not taken for granted, that many canonical notions, even\nso-called \u201cperennial\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d issues,\nhave the salience or global significance these issues have long been\nassumed to have. Conceptions of personhood in several indigenous\nAfrican schemes of thought (of Akan and Yoruba peoples, for example)\ninvite comparisons and rethinking of notions of personhood long\nsanctioned in some legacies of Western European and North American\nphilosophizing. For example, Kwasi Wiredu (1987) of Ghana has argued\npersuasively that in the indigenous conceptual-ontological schemes of\nthe Akan it would not be possible, in the normal course of matters, to\ngenerate the \u201cmind-body problem\u201d so central to the\nphilosophizing of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Explorations of matters of\nlogic, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics in Akan and\nother schemes of thought will illuminate the extent to which Western\nEuropean and North American inventories of philosophical\n\u201cproblems\u201d will have to be revised. Likewise for\nexplorations in the areas of religion, aesthetics, politics, and the\nmeaning of social life.\n\n\nWhile there are near daunting challenges being faced by African\npeoples and other citizens of the continent\u2019s nation-states that\ncompel problem-solving philosophizing for enhanced living, there are,\ntoo, example-lessons of such engaged philosophizing that warrant close\nand appreciative study. One such example is the transformation under\nway in South Africa from the White Racial Supremacy of racial\napartheid to a multiracial, multiethnic democracy. A crucial factor\nconditioning the transformation has been the soul-wrenching work of\nthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which sponsored public\nhearings during which victims of the evils of apartheid, and\nperpetrators of the evils, disclosed the truths of their suffering and\nof their dehumanizing aggression, respectively. Grounding premises of\nthe TRC project were that disclosures of the truths of\nsuffering and of abuse were necessary in order to\nachieve restorative justice, not just compensatory or\nretributive justice; and that restorative justice is in keeping with\nphilosophical notions such as ubuntu\u2014love, generosity,\nforgiveness\u2014that are foundational to communal life at its best,\nthus are essential to the rehabilitative healing that must be lived\nthrough in forging new persons for a new and democratic South Africa\n(Bell 2002, Chapter 5, \u201cAfrican Moral Philosophy II: Truth and\nReconciliation,\u201d pp. 85\u2013107). Here, then, a case-study in\nthe articulation and testing out of a new conception of justice, of\nethics more generally, in an African context, a case-study that should\nalready be substantively instructive.  Such comparative work in\nacademic Philosophy that engages seriously and respectfully\nphilosophical articulations of African and African-descendant thinking\nhas only just begun\u2026\n",
