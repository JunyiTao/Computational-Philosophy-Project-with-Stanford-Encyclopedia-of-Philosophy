    "main_text": "The Arcades Project\n5. The Arcades Project\nThe city was the seedbed of Benjamin\u2019s \u2018gothic\u2019 Marxism\n(Cohen 1993); Paris its testing ground. All of Benjamin\u2019s writings\nfrom the autumn of 1927 until his death in 1940 relate in one way or\nother to his great unfinished study \u2018Paris\u2014Capital of the\nNineteenth Century\u2019, otherwise known as The Arcades\nProject (Das Passagen-Werk), after its founding image,\ntaken by Benjamin from the 1926 novel, Le Paysan de Paris, by\nthe French surrealist Louis Aragon. This was a book of which Benjamin\nwrote: \u201cI could never read more than two or three pages in bed\nat night before my heart started to beat so strongly that I had to lay\nthe book aside.\u201d (BA, 88) The arcades would become just one of\nfive or six archetypal images of the psychosocial space of\n19th-century Paris around which the project was organized\u2014each\npaired with a particular, thematically representative individual. But\nit provided the model for the others, and its surrealist origin and\nliminal utopian impulse, neither quite inside nor out, established the\nwish-image and the dream-image\u2014on the threshold of sleeping and\nwaking\u2014at the heart of a work that was initially conceived as a\nkind of \u2018dialectical fairytale\u2019. (The figure with whom\n\u2018the arcades\u2019 was paired was the utopian socialist Charles\nFourier.) All of Benjamin\u2019s major essays of the 1930s derived their\nimpetus and orientation from his Arcades work, and served to defer its\ncompletion in the act of elaborating its elements.\u00a0\nThis deferral was also, in part, the result of a process of\nmaturation\u2014a kind of ripening\u2014immanent to the work\nitself. The Arcades was a vast and ambitious project, not\nsimply in terms of the mass and breadth of its archival sources\n(sought out by Benjamin in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in\nParis), but also\u2014indeed, primarily\u2014with respect to its\nphilosophical and historical intent, and the methodological and\nrepresentational challenges it posed. Its sprawling, yet minutely\ninvestigated historical object was to act as the point of entry into\nthe philosophically comprehended experience of metropolitan\ncapitalism\u2014not some past experience, or the experience of a past\nphase of capitalist development, but the experience of the capitalist\nmetropolis in Benjamin\u2019s own day\u2014through the construction of a\nspecific series of relations between its elements \u2018then\u2019\nand \u2018now\u2019. The practice of research, conceptual\norganization and presentation that it involved was self-consciously\nconceived as a working model for a new, philosophically oriented,\nmaterialist historiography with political intent. Its final,\nfragmentary and \u2018ruined\u2019 status has come to stand not\nsimply as the sign of a failure of completion, but as a paradigm of a\nform of constitutive incompletion that is characteristic of all\nsystematically oriented knowledge under the conditions of\nmodernity. In this respect, in its very failure to be actualized, it\nconfirmed the fundamental historical and philosophical truth of\nBenjamin\u2019s earlier analysis of the Romantic fragment\u2014extending\nthe genre in a hitherto unimagined way.\nIn the ebb and flow of its changing rhythms\u2014additions,\nrevisions, reformulations and retrievals\u2014Benjamin\u2019s Arcades\nProject provides an extraordinary case study in the labour of\nconceptual construction via the configuration and reconfiguration of\narchival materials. The voluminous \u2018Notes and Materials\u2019\nthat make up the Arcades as it has come down to us remained\nunpublished until 1982, finally appearing in English only in 1999 (GS\nV; AP). Only since their publication has it been possible to get a\nclear sense of the overall trajectory of Benjamin\u2019s thought during\nthis period\u2014rendering redundant, or at least displacing, many of\nthe polemics associated with previous cycles of reception. The notes\nand materials are organized into twenty-six alphabetically designated\n\u2018convolutes\u2019 (literally \u2018bundles\u2019) or folders,\nthematically defined by various objects (arcades, catacombs,\nbarricades, iron constructions, mirrors, modes of\nlighting\u2026), topics (fashion, boredom, theory of\nknowledge, theory of progress, painting,\nconspiracies\u2026), figures (the collector, the flaneur,\nthe automaton\u2026), authors (Baudelaire, Fourier, Jung,\nMarx, Saint-Simon\u2026) and their combinations. The project as a\nwhole received two \u2018expos\u00e9s\u2019 or summaries, in 1935\nand 1939 (the second, in French). However, its scope and theoretical\nambition\u2014nothing less than a philosophical construction of\n\u201cthe primal history of the nineteenth century\u201d (BA,\n90)\u2014joined with the circumstances of Benjamin\u2019s life in exile\n(the constant need to earn money by writing and the uncertainty of a\npublisher for the project) to frustrate its realization. The only\nlengthy segment of completed text derives from the part devoted to\nBaudelaire (one of five parts in the 1939 expos\u00e9, cut down from\nsix in the initial 1935 version): the second of its three projected\nsections, \u2018The Paris of the Second Empire in\nBaudelaire\u2019\u2014although even this was never published in\nBenjamin\u2019s lifetime. However, the central chapter of this section,\n\u2018The Flaneur\u2019, was revised and expanded (in part, in\nresponse to an exchange of letters with Adorno) into the essay\n\u2018Some Motifs in Baudelaire\u2019, which was published in the\nInstitute\u2019s journal, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\n(Journal for Social Research) in January 1940. A powerful\ncompressed draft of material corresponding to the final section, on\nthe commodity as a poetic object, exists as \u2018Central Park\u2019\n(SW 4, 161\u2013199). As the project evolved, and in response to the\nbarriers to its realization, Baudelaire thus became increasingly\ncentral to Benjamin\u2019s thinking.  (\u2018Convolute J\u2019, on\nBaudelaire, is by far the longest of the convolutes.) Encouraged by\nHorkheimer, Benjamin planned to publish the material on Baudelaire as\na separate book, to be entitled, Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet\nin the Era of High Capitalism.  The development of this process,\nwhereby a primal history of the nineteenth century gradually morphed\ninto a book on Baudelaire and \u2018high capitalism\u2019, may be\nrepresented, diagrammatically, as follows.\n\nPARIS\u2014CAPITAL OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY (1939 Expos\u00e9)\nA. Fourier, or the Arcades\n(+) [Daguerre, or the Panorama\u2014only in the 1935 version]\nB. Grandville, or the World Exhibitions\nC. Louis Philippe, or the Interior\nD.

The Boh\u00e8me\nii. The Flaneur*\niii. The Modern\n\n3.[The Commodity as Poetic Object]**\n\nE. Haussmann, or the Barricades\n\n\n*\nExpanded and published as \u2018Some Motifs in Baudelaire\u2019 (1940)\n**\nIn draft form as \u2018Central Park\u2019 (1938)\n\n\n\nHowever, to reduce the project to its own, restricted de facto\ntrajectory, rich as it is, does too much violence to the historical and\nphilosophical framework it embodies, from which the material on\nBaudelaire gains its broader significance. The overarching historical\nframework is that of capitalist modernity as a \u2018crisis of\nexperience\u2019. (The two terms, capitalism and modernity, are\ninextricable for Benjamin in the context of 19th- and early\n20th-century Europe.) The founding problematic of Benjamin\u2019s\nthought\u2014the expansion of the Kantian concept of experience, to\ninfinity\u2014is thus here provided with a concretely historical\ncontext, in which the notion of infinity/absoluteness becomes\nassociated with the concept of history itself. The problem: to\ndialectically redeem the concept of experience [Erfahrung]\nby finding an appropriate way of experiencing the crisis of experience\nitself. In classically \u2018modern\u2019 terms, the present is\ndefined as a time of crisis and transition, and philosophical\nexperience (truth) is associated with the glimpse within the present,\nvia the past, of a utopian political future that would bring history to\nan end. More immediately, the crisis is given political meaning by two\npossible resolutions: the one destructive; the other constructive/\nemancipatory\u2014fascism and communism, respectively. In this\nrespect, for all his theoretical heterodoxy as a \u2018Marxist\u2019\nand his philosophical affinities with Adorno, Benjamin was in search\nof, and in solidarity with, new forms of collectivity connected to a\ncommunist future. Herein lay the basis of his friendship with Brecht.\nUnlike Brecht, however, he conceived them within the terms of a\nspeculative cultural history (Caygill 2004). \n\nWithin this framework, three distinct strands of work (discussed in\nthe next three sections) can be discerned: (1) investigation of the\ncrisis of experience via the \u2018crisis of the arts\u2019\n(SW\u00a0 2, 212) through the interrelated terms\nof technology/technique\n[Technik], aura, reproducibility,\nand collectivity; (2) philosophical distillation of the\nformal structure of the experience of the new, and its historical and\npolitical contradictions, out of its social forms, and the examination\nof its relations to allegory and commodity-form; (3) construction of a\nnew historiography and a new philosophical concept of history. The\nfirst may be traced through a linked series of essays of which\n\u2018Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European\nIntelligentsia\u2019 (1929), \u2018Little History of\nPhotography\u2019 (1931), \u2018The Work of Art in the Age of its\nTechnical Reproducibility\u2019 (1935\u20139) and \u2018The\nStoryteller\u2019 (1936) are the most important. The second is\nconcentrated in readings of Baudelaire and related texts by Nietzsche\nand Blanqui. (The focusing-in on these three thinkers is a focusing-in\non the relationship of capitalism to modernity in its purest,\nnihilistic form). The third is conjured from a reflective conjunction\nof Marx, Nietzsche and Surrealism. It takes methodological form in\n\u2018Convolute N [On the Theory of Knowledge, Theory of\nProgress]\u2019 in The Arcades Project and achieved its\naccidentally definitive presentation in Benjamin\u2019s most frequently\ncited, but still fiercely interpretatively disputed text (Caygill\n2004; L\u00f6wy 2005; Tiedemman 1989; Wohlfarth 1978): the\nfragments\u2014known as theses\u2014\u2018On the Concept of\nHistory\u2019.\n",
