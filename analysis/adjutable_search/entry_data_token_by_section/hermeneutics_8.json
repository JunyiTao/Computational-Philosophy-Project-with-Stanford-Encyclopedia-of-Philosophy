    "main_text": "Hermeneutics and Existence\n3. Hermeneutics and Existence\n\nThe principal impetus for contemporary hermeneutics, then, is a new\nuse Heidegger makes of hermeneutics in his early phenomenological\ninquiries into what, in Being and Time, he calls the\n\u2018being\u2019 or also, the \u2018existentiality,\u2019 of\nhuman \u2018existence\u2019 (Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7 7, section C). Heidegger\u2019s philosophy is oriented by the\nquestion of the meaning, or, sense of being (die Frage nach dem\nSinn des Seins), but as he argues in Being and Time,\ninquiry into this question itself begins with inquiry into the sense\nin which human beings can be said to be or exist (Heidegger, Being\nand Time, \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20134). Heidegger defines inquiry into\nthe sense of the being of human existence as hermeneutical, that is,\nas a matter of self-interpretation. Within this context, Heidegger\nleaves behind the idea that hermeneutics is primarily concerned with\nthe methods or foundations of research in the arts and humanities.\nRather, as he argues, such hermeneutical research is itself only\npossible because human beings are, in their very being, interpretive.\nFor Heidegger, understanding is a mode or possibility of human\nexistence, and, indeed, one that is projective, oriented toward the\ninterpretive possibilities available to us in the situations in which\nwe find ourselves (see especially Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7\u00a7 31\u201332). Accordingly, inquiry into the sense of the\nbeing of human existence is enacted in our own attempts to understand\nour own being, as we may interpret our being through the course of our\naffairs.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s use of hermeneutics in the context of his early\nphenomenological inquiries into human existence can be described as a\nbreakthrough in the historical movement of hermeneutics (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, Part II.3). But Heidegger\u2019s\nconsiderations also continue to be a subject of considerable\ndiscussion, and his insights remain at issue, to a greater or lesser\ndegree, in a range of current philosophers and debates.\nHeidegger\u2019s later works are important for hermeneutical\nconsiderations of history, language, art, poetry, and translation, as\nwell. As Heidegger develops, however, he comes to claim that his paths\nof thinking can no longer be served by hermeneutics, and his thought\ncomes to be characterized by new and different orientations.\n",
