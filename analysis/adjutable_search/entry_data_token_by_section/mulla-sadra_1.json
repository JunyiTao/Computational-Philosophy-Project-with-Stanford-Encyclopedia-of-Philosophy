    "main_text": "Life and works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nMulla Sadra wrote over forty-five works. His magnum opus, al-Hikma\nal-muta\u2018aliya fi-l-asfar al-\u2018aqliyya al-arba\u2018a,\nknown as al-Asfar al-arba\u2018a (The Four\nJourneys), is a large compendium of philosophy and theology that,\ninstead of following the traditional divisions of logic, physics, and\nmetaphysics, maps intellectual inquiry upon a mystical metaphor of the\nsoul\u2019s journey in this world. Hence it is popularly known as the\nFour Journeys. He began writing it in 1015 AH/1606 in Kahak\nand completed it in Shiraz in 1038 AH/1628. The first journey from\nthis world to God provides the seeker with the intellectual principles\nfor understanding philosophy such as the basic definition of\nphilosophy and metaphysics, the significance of metaphysics and the\nquestion of being for this study. In this journey, the seeker moves\naway from multiplicity and phenomenal deception towards unity and an\nawareness of the underlying nature of reality. The second journey in\nGod with God is a discourse on the nature of God, the divine\nattributes and significantly including his famous proof for the\nexistence of God. It is the stage of the mystic\u2019s absorption in\nthe divine essence and his effacement of the self. The third journey\nfrom God to this world explains the God-world relationship, nature,\ntime and creation and ontological categories in this world. For the\nmystic, this is the return to sobriety and a realisation of the duties\nof moral agency in this world. The final journey in this world with\nGod is a description of human psychology focusing on soteriology and\neschatology and reveals most clearly the significance of Twelver\nShi\u2018ism to his thought. This is the final stage of the\nmystic\u2019s journey, a recognition that everything as a unified\nwhole reflects the ontological unity of the divine and that the\nrealised human recognises a desire to return to the principle, the one\nwho is the source of being, God.\n\nThe Four Journeys is a major source for the history of\nIslamic philosophical traditions: it reveals the strong influence of\nan Avicennan structure with major contributions from the critiques of\nAvicennism by Suhrawardi and the Sufi metaphysical monism of Ibn\nal-\u2018Arabi (d. 1240). But it is not just the arguments of\nthinkers, well known in academic and scholarly circles, who are\nconsidered. He also addressed the positions of some major philosophers\nof Shiraz, who remain little known even to specialists studying\nIslamic philosophy, such as Mir Ghiyath al-Din Mansur Dashtaki (d. 948\nAH/1541) and Shams al-Din Muhammad Khafri (d. ca. 957 AH/1550).\n\nHis other works mainly deal with philosophical theology, such as\nal-Hikma al-\u2018arshiyya (Wisdom of the throne) and\nal-Shawahid al-rububiyya (Divine witnesses). One work,\nal-Masha\u2018ir (Inspired recognitions) stands out as a\ndense epitome of his doctrine of being as expressed in the first part\nof the Four Journeys on the semantics of existence. As a religious\nthinker, Mulla Sadra was also keen to come to terms with his\nscriptural heritage, and he wrote three works on the hermeneutics of\nthe Qur\u2019an as a preparation for his own incomplete mystical and\nphilosophical commentary on the text: Mafatih al-ghayb (Keys\nto the unseen), Asrar al-ayat (Secrets of the verses/signs),\nand Mutashabihat al-Qur\u2019an (Allegories of the\nQur\u2019an). As a Shi\u2018i thinker, he also wrote an incomplete\ncommentary on the main doctrinal collection of tradition, Usul\nal-kafi of Kulayni (d. 329 AH/941), as an attempt to grapple with\nthe question of what it means to be an intuitive philosopher in the\nShi\u2018i tradition. He also wrote a number of other treatises on\nparticular issues, such as creatio ex nihilo (huduth\nal-\u2018alam), the resurrection, the nature of knowledge,\nlogic, and the relationship between existence and essence. But the\nFour Journeys remains his most important work and the key to\nunderstanding his philosophy as he repeatedly cited it in his other\nworks for a more extended discussion of an issue.\n",
