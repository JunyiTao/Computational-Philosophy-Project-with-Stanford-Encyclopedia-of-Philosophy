    "main_text": "Why Purely Holist Explanations Can Sometimes Stand on Their Own || The Argument from Mechanism Regress\n4.2 The Argument from Mechanism Regress\n\nThe argument from mechanism regress is directed at the mechanism model\nof explanation. The endorsement of this model is taken to support the\ninsistence that purely holist explanations must always be accompanied\nby accounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms (see e.g.,\nVan Bouwel 2006; Norkus 2005; Kincaid 1997: 26; Opp 2005).\n\nThe starting point of the argument involves the observation that when\ntwo social phenomena are linked by a causal chain of events at the\nlevel of individuals, then these events are themselves connected by\nunderlying mechanisms involving events that are, in turn, linked by\nunderlying mechanisms, and so on. In this fashion, it is mechanisms\nall the way down until some physical bottom-level mechanisms are\nprobably reached. According to the argument from mechanism regress,\nthis point brings into view a problem faced by the mechanism model of\nexplanation. The model requires that the underlying mechanisms that\ncausally link two phenomena must be specified. Consequently, due to\nsocial phenomena being connected by underlying mechanisms that extend\nall the way down to some bottom physical level, the model seems to\nrequire that all such mechanisms be specified each time a purely\nholist explanation is offered. But, of course, this is an absurd\nrequirement, and so the mechanism view of explanation should be\nrejected. Without it, there is no longer any basis for holding that\npurely holist explanations can never stand on their own.\n",
