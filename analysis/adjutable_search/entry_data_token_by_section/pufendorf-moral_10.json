    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The State\n4.2 The State\n\nPufendorf\u2019s political philosophy or doctrine of the state,\nincluding the latter\u2019s internal and external functions, is\ncontinuous and consistent with his ethics; in fact, they are not\nreally distinct. Both rest on the same natural law foundation, namely\nthe sociality law which regulates not only pre-civil relations,\ninstitutions, and societies but also the civil condition needed to\nsecure them. As thoroughly social beings who are incapable of living\nalone, humans are subject to sociality\u2019s requirements at all\nstages of their lives, both temporally and organizationally, and the\nestablishment of political authority does not leave morality and its\nobligations behind but rather facilitates and extends their reach. The\ntempered realism of the political sphere is not a forced abandonment\nof moral norms but an articulation of the natural law\u2019s demands\namid the increasing complexities of collective human existence,\nincluding its inevitable constraints, exclusions, and compromises. In\nPufendorf\u2019s natural law theory, politics is a form of social\nethics.\n4.2.1 The Origin of the State\n\nSpeaking generally (since the formation of individual states varies\ngreatly), the moral entity of \u2018the state\u2019 is self-imposed\nby humans at the command of natural law when their pre-civil marital,\nparental, and particularly herilic associations \u2013 as well as\nother pact-based institutions such as property \u2013 become\ndysfunctional because of multiplying conflicts that lead increasingly\nto the unjustified use of force and, thus, reciprocal injury and\ninsecurity. It is a defensive and precautionary response to such\nemergent conditions, a kind of cooperative scheme\n(conspiratio) or mutual protection association created as\nneeded against the growing threat posed by other human beings (DJN\nVII.2.1\u20132). Contra Aristotle, the state is not a natural or\nideal stage of human development emerging spontaneously from\nhumans\u2019 desire to live together (DJN VII.1.2\u20133), but an\nadventitious, willed self-help device broadly enjoined by natural law\nin either or both a prudential (i.e., recommended by sound reason) or\ndeontological (i.e., commanded by God) sense (DJN VII.3.2). It is not\nrequired to eliminate human need (indigentia) in the\npre-cultural natural state, since cities and other forms of\nassociation usually suffice for that (DJN VII.1.3 and 6; Brett 2011).\nRather it secures these social arrangements and their cultural gains\nin the context of increased human numbers, relative scarcity and\ncompetition, growing disagreements, and the ensuing insecurity that\ncomes from the interaction of individually weak and imperfectly social\nbeings.\n\nState formation is explicitly driven by fear, and there is ample\nreference to human wickedness, self-concern, and a willingness to\ninjure in Pufendorf\u2019s sketch of the pre-civil condition (DJN\nVII.1\u20132). Still, his comments are qualified even here, in\nopposition to Hobbes, and they do not amount to an anthropological\nclaim about the exclusive selfishness of all human beings \u2013\nwhich is not needed for the argument (DJN VII.1.5, 7\u20138). In\nfact, the discussion of pre-civil conditions and institutions clearly\ntempers such pessimism. For while those arrangements rely on formal\npromises and pacts, they are also induced by and certainly compatible\nwith mutual affection, a desire for friendship, and the enjoyment of\nconviviality (DJN VII.1.5, 2.4; VIII.4.3, 6.2; II.2.7, 3.16). To be\nsure, such means and motives become increasingly incapable of\nmaintaining them, as the complex feelings regulating smaller, simpler,\nand more intimate human interactions evolve into a cruder and colder\npsychology of scale among composite moral persons or groups. That is,\nwith the reduction of familiarity, predictability, and commonality of\npurpose comes a sort of primitivizing of motives in the direction of\nfear. Still, Pufendorf\u2019s state is not built on a thick,\nessentialist, or teleological (philosophical or theological)\nanthropology \u2013 even of a negative sort \u2013 but on an\nempirical, historical, or realistic assessment of actual human\naffairs. This means both that the state\u2019s minimalist function as\na mutual protection agency may not be controlled or overridden by\nother, substantive (e.g., religious, ethical) ends, but also that,\nsince fear does not necessarily eliminate other human motives but only\nsuppresses or distorts or overrules them, the state as guarantor of\nmutual security may actually allow these to function (again) in their\nproper (subordinate) contexts.\n4.2.2 Contractualism\n\nBeside its sovereignty, what distinguishes Pufendorf\u2019s state\nfrom other pact-based institutions is its size (DJN VII.2.2) \u2013\nthat is, its numbers must suffice for security in particular social\nand historical circumstances \u2013 and, more importantly, its manner\nof formation. Conceptually, it owes its origin to two agreements and\nan intervening decree (DJN VII.2.7\u20138). An initial contract of\nassociation occurs when members of a multitude, or the would-be\ncitizens (in practice, family-fathers or patriarchs, who are the\nprimary or direct citizens: DJN VII.2.20, 5.12), agree with one\nanother to bond together for mutual security. This requires the\naccession of all (full or formal) members of the resultant group, who\nconsent to it either absolutely or conditionally depending on whether\nthey agree individually to bind themselves to any form of state\nselected by the majority, or only to a certain, preapproved form\nsatisfactory to themselves. In either case, the band (coetus)\nthus constituted still lacks unity and has only \u201cthe rudiments\nand beginnings of a state\u201d (DJN VII.2.7; Pufendorf 1994a, p.\n212), although it suffices to prevent an immediate return to the state\nof nature if the second pact is temporarily suspended, as during an\ninterregnum (DJN VII.7.6\u20137, VIII.11.1).\n\nThe second pact follows the selection (via the pragmatic expedient of\nmajority vote; see Pasquino 2010, Schwartzberg 2008) of the specific\nform of state to be instituted (monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy),\nand through it each citizen of the future state subjects himself to\nthe specific governing agent thereby established. It is needed to\nprevent the random defection and individual exceptionalism that\nthreaten all pre-civil agreements (DJN VII.2.3, 10), including the\nfirst contract. At this stage or level, the individual contractors\nunite their wills through separate promises of obedience to a new\nmoral persona equipped with distinctive (i.e., not simply transferred)\nrights and obligations, and capable of using their combined strength\nto discipline, compel, and thus govern effectively (DJN VII.2.5, 3.4,\n8.5; cf. VI.1.12; Boucher 1998, Skinner 2002). Civil subjection is\nanalogous to herilic subjection or slavery, though more focused in\nintent, more limited in scope, and \u2013 because of reciprocal\npromises between governors and governed \u2013 potentially sublatable\nin narrowly defined and (thinks Pufendorf) avoidable circumstances\n(DJN VII.3.1, 2.10; Seidler 1996). Moreover, in combining a title to\ncommand with the strength to sanction or compel, it also recalls the\ngeneral structure and rationale of the moral obligation that enjoins\nhumans to constitute it in the first place (cf. DJN VII.3.1, 2.13;\nI.6.9, 6.12; and Section 3.2 above).\n4.2.3 Sovereignty\n\nLike Bodin and Hobbes, Pufendorf identified sovereignty\n(imperium) as the \u201cvivifying and sustaining soul\u201d\nof the state. It is a new moral quality that emerges from the\nrespective commitments of rulers and ruled, consisting of the\nformer\u2019s right to command and the latter\u2019s duty to obey.\n(DJN VII.3.1\u20132: Pufendorf 1994a, pp. 217\u201318; VII.4.12;\nHolland 2012) Like other souls, as it were, sovereignty comes from God\n(as author of the natural law), though only indirectly in this case,\nor through the instrumentality of reasoning human beings. Thus,\nthroughout Book VII of DJN Pufendorf rejects the arguments of J. F.\nHorn (Politicorum pars architectonica de civitate [1664]),\nthe German Filmer. Natural law bestows sovereignty on no one form of\ngovernment or on specific individuals or groups; instead, such\ndecisions are made by human contractors in particular circumstances.\nIt is always required, however, that sovereignty be supreme in the\nsense that there be no superior or equivalent powers within the state.\nAlso, sovereignty cannot be divided, since that would fragment the\nunity of will that undergirds the state as an effective authority (DJN\nVII.4.11). Accordingly, all governing functions, including\nlegislative, judicial, penal, economic, and war-related powers must\nultimately reside in the same persona or agency. Otherwise (as in the\nHoly Roman Empire whose political diseases Pufendorf diagnosed in\nThe Present State of Germany (Monz.) the state would have two\nor more heads and, by reproducing the conflicts of the pre-civil\ncondition, would invite its own destruction.\n4.2.4 Forms of State\n\nStates where sovereignty is unified \u2013 whatever be their form\n(monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) \u2013 are called regular, and\nthose where it is divided irregular (DJN VII.5.2, 5.14\u201315).\nIrregularity always weakens a state, but each form also has its own\ndifficulties and weaknesses. Pufendorf does not in principle prefer\none regular form over another: God is the author of free states\n(democracies) and monarchies alike (DJN VII.5.5), and sovereignty or\nmajesty belongs equally to all states and not just to monarchies (DJN\nVII.3.3). However, humans incline differently toward particular forms\nof state (DJN VII.5.11), and it is up to them to decide which ones to\nimplement for themselves (DJN VII.3.2). In fact, the choice appears to\nbe prudential in nature, since certain forms of state may require\nspecific human dispositions to function effectively (DJN VII.6.5), and\nsome forms may be more suited for particular settings. Thus, large\nterritories with scattered populations are better ruled as monarchies,\nwhile smaller regions or city-states can be governed well as\ndemocracies (DJN VII.5.22). More generally, monarchy may be more\nefficient because of the simple logistics of human association (DJN\nVII.5.9). Beside such forms and conditions, each type of state is also\nprone to other faults or illnesses peculiar to itself, which Pufendorf\ndistinguishes into \u201cvices of men\u201d and \u201cvices of\nstatus\u201d (DJN VII.5.10). The former obtain, for instance, when\n(in a monarchy) rulership goes to someone unqualified for that role,\nand the latter when (in a democracy) citizens are too self-assertive\nand unwilling to compromise. The fact remains that even though states\nare a remedy for human weakness and imperfection, as human constructs\nthey always remain an imperfect one (DJN VII.5.22).\n\nThis problem cannot be avoided or lessened by mixing forms of state, a\ntraditional expedient (Riklin 2006, Scattola 2009b, Zurbuchen 2009)\nthat Pufendorf rejects because of the irregularities it produces. For\nmixing yields either an entity that is no state at all, because it is\nheld together by a mere agreement (without subjection), or one that\napproximates a system of independent states, else something\n\u2018monstrous\u2019 in between (DJN VII.5.12\u201313). Pufendorf\ndoes allow, though, for a distinction between forms of state and forms\nof administration. Thus, a monarch may utilize executive mechanisms\nthat are aristocratic or democratic in nature, and similarly for other\nforms of state (DJN VII.5.1, 5.13). The crucial defining factor in\neach instance is the unity and locus of ultimate authority, not how\nits commands are executed or policies implemented. Such arrangements\ndiffer from so-called systems of (sovereign) states, which themselves\nexhibit regular and irregular forms depending on the way their\ncollective authority is exercised. By discussing them Pufendorf\nextends his analysis to the international sphere (DJN\nVII.5.17\u201321; see Seidler 2011).\n4.2.5 Absolute and Limited Sovereignty\n\nContra Hobbes, Pufendorf allows that supreme sovereignty (summum\nimperium) may be either absolute or limited (DJN VII.6.7). The\nformer obtains where a sovereign accepts his (her, or its) authority\nwith no conditions attached, the latter where citizens\u2019\nsubmission depends on the sovereign\u2019s initial acceptance of\ncertain terms, such as an existing state\u2019s fundamental laws.\nThese can be violated by the eventual sovereign, making his actions\ninjurious or illegitimate (DJN VII.8.2\u20134, 6.10), even though\nsubjects are not typically \u2013 except in extremis \u2013\nin a position to deny him obedience for this reason because it would\nundermine the important end of sovereignty altogether (DJN\nVII.8.5\u20136). Given human imperfections, Pufendorf clearly favors\nlimited sovereignty; however, and for the same reasons, while he\ncriticizes the abuse of absolute sovereignty he also criticizes\nirrational fear thereof (DJN VII.6.8\u201313). Again, there is no\nuniversal recommendation but all depends on what is needed in\nparticular historical circumstances where such choices present\nthemselves.\n4.2.6 State and Church\n\nThe state or sovereign necessarily controls all sub-state collectives,\nincluding economic, political, and religious associations, especially\nif they compete with it for citizens\u2019 allegiance (DJN\nVII.2.21\u201324). Though piety is a personal matter between the\ndeity and individual believers, its official mediation by ecclesial\nentities or churches, which also direct and organize human actions,\nhas a worldly impact that may interfere with the state\u2019s\nfunctions (which are also divinely enjoined) \u2013 as Pufendorf\nargued by reference to the history of Catholicism and the\npapacy\u2019s role in European affairs (Einl., ch. 12, 2013; also\n[1839, 1714, 1691b]). Therefore, sovereigns have the right (and\nobligation) to regulate religious organizations, to examine beliefs,\nand even to foster an official religion \u2013 though only to insure\ncompatibility with political order (DJN VII.4.11, 9.4). In fact, like\npublic schools (if they do not merely perpetuate scholastic\nsubtleties), religion may also aid the process of civic formation\n\u2013 which is required because states are adventitious moral\nentities devised by humans for a particular purpose, and because\n(good) citizens are not born but made (DJN VII.1.3\u20134). However,\nsince they are disparate institutions regulating different moral\npersonae (citizens, believers), neither state nor church exists\nprimarily to serve the other\u2019s purposes. The state\u2019s\ngeneral authority regarding religion, and its sovereignty over all\nreligious groups alike, also creates room for the toleration of\nreligious minorities and thus restrains destabilizing confessional\nconflict (Seidler 2002, Zurbuchen 2013, Lehmann 2013, Palladini\n1997b). Though Pufendorf had not yet arrived at Christian\nThomasius\u2019 notion of a deconfessionalized state (Hunter 2007),\nhis historical awareness of religion\u2019s impact on government, and\nits frequent contribution to political factionalism, made him wary of\nindependent religious institutions and inclined to favor state\noversight. In any case, since they issue from the same warranting\ndeity, he held that ultimately true politics and true (religious)\ndoctrine cannot conflict (DJN VII.4.8, 4.11).\n4.2.7 Civil Law\n\nDespite its natural law foundation, a state\u2019s positive laws will\nonly partially overlap with natural law. That is, since its purpose is\nnot to make humans perfect but secure, only those natural laws without\nwhich peace among citizens would be impossible should also become\ncivil laws (DJN VIII.1.1, III.4.6). In fact, by focusing on the\nrequirements of human association rather than on personal formation,\nthe sociality principle makes Pufendorf a legal minimalist more\ngenerally, so that even where the natural law is silent or indifferent\n\u201ccivil laws should not sanction more things than conduce to the\ngood of the citizens [as such] and the state\u201d (DJN VII.9.5;\nPufendorf 1994a, p. 242). Besides, and within this narrow focal area,\nit also grants legislators considerable discretion or flexibility of\napplication. Thus, even though civil laws should not explicitly\ncontravene natural law, it is sometimes excusable if they redefine or\n\u201coverlook\u201d (dissimulare) certain practices\n\u2013 like theft, dueling, and tacitly accepted cuckoldry \u2013\nfor which \u201cthe condition of the times and the genius of a\npeople\u201d do not provide a current remedy (DJN VIII.1.3). Such\npractical adjustments are evident throughout Pufendorf\u2019s\ndetailed discussions of state laws in DJN VIII \u2013 regarding\npunishment, social status (esteem), property, and war \u2013 which\nare strongly prudentialist, consequentialist, and realist in\ncharacter. They evince not a substantive moralism but the same\nflexible \u2018reason-of-state\u2019 approach that also guides his\nthinking about inter-state relations. Indeed, through their common\ngrounding in the sociality principle, natural, civil, and\ninternational law are in continuity and in dialogue with one another\n\u2013 though in a complex and sometimes untidy way (DJN II.3.23).\nThat is, though as a broad divine injunction natural law is presumed\nto be ultimately consistent, in practice (as specifically interpreted\nby particular humans) it often appears less so; for its demands must\nalways be articulated in full view of not only human psychology but\nalso the concrete settings in which human action occurs. (Thus, as in\nthe case of immigration [section 3.5 above], Pufendorf could condemn\nthe 1640s English revolution, while approving that in 1688. See\nSeidler 2001.)\n4.2.8 Punishment\n\nThis requirement is also evident in Pufendorf\u2019s long discussion\nof the sovereign\u2019s right to punish (DJN VIII.3, H\u00fcning\n2009b). Punishment presupposes a superior, and so (in contrast to\nLocke) it cannot occur in either the pre-civil or the international\nstate of nature (DJN VIII.3.1\u20132, 3.7). Of course, both\nindividuals and states have a right to defend themselves or wage\ndefensive (and, in limited circumstances, preemptive) war, but neither\nof these is to be construed as punishment strictly speaking. The\nlatter is, instead, a means of social control available only to\nsovereigns for the specific purpose of restraint, deterrence, and\nreform (DJN VIII.3.9). In their hands, moreover, it is more future-\nthan past-oriented, with the latter being important only for the sake\nof the former: that is, one should not pointlessly impose evil on\nsomeone, even if guilty, if the deed cannot be undone or the damage\nrepaired, for he remains after all our conspecific or fellow human\nbeing (cognato) (DJN VIII.3.8). Those who have injured\nanother certainly owe a duty of reparation, as well as assurances\nabout future behavior, but they are under no obligation to submit to\npunishment (DJN VIII.3.4; see end of 4.1.3 above), which is imposed\nfor purely consequentialist reasons. Joining Hobbes, Pufendorf\ndismisses revenge as a \u201cvain and unreasonable\u201d motive (DJN\nVIII.3.8) for punishment, and he also dismisses Selden\u2019s\n\u201csatisfaction, purgation, or expiation\u201d (DJN VIII.3.12) as\nunnecessary or meaningless notions. Moreover, he holds that penalties\nare not \u201cowed to\u201d or \u201cdeserved by\u201d criminals,\nwho are unlikely to assert such a right (DJN VIII.3.5, 3.15).\nInstead,a sovereign\u2019s resort to punishment should be guided by\nstate interest (as, in the case of a parent, by the interests of the\nfamily: DJN VIII.3.10), which also determines the quantity and quality\nof punishment needed (DJN VIII.3.23\u201324). The latter should never\nbe excessive but guided by the actual advantages to be gained (DJN\nVII.9.6\u20137). In some cases, punishment may even be foregone\naltogether if the interest of the state demands it (DJN VIII.3.14,\n16). This is because punishment is an instance of neither distributive\nnor commutative (expletive) justice, but a type of administrative\nsanction recommended by \u201cprudence \u2026 conjoined with the\nduty to rule others\u201d (DJN VIII.3.5).\n\nIn sum, Pufendorf\u2019s analysis of punishment as a whole reflects\nthe positive and (re)constructive attitude of the law of nature, in\nboth pre- and post-civil conditions, particularly its injunctions to\nforgive, to accept apologies and reparations, and basically so to act\nas always to further and facilitate sociality (\u201cinasmuch as [we]\ncan\u201d), rather than to frustrate or make it impossible among\nhuman beings as we actually find them (DJN V.13.1; II.3.15, Pufendorf\n1994a, p. 152). As such, it appears far removed from more absolutist\nor categorical views of justice, such as the well-known statement (of\nKant in The Metaphysics of Morals [Die Metaphysik der\nSitten, 1797]) that a civil society must, before dissolving\nitself, execute every convicted murderer remaining in its prisons\n\u2013 a contrast that reveals well the gulf separating\nPufendorf\u2019s natural law theory from essentialist or Platonizing\nviews (such as Leibniz\u2019s) that challenged, and the Critical\nphilosophy that eventually replaced it (Hunter 2001, 2003a).\n",
