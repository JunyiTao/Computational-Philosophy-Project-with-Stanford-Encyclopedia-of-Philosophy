    "main_text": "Empirical Research || Behavioral Economics\n2.2 Behavioral Economics\n\nBehavioral economics began by focusing on how real people make actual\neconomic decisions, and on explaining the type of information\nprocessing that leads them to fall short of ideal economic rationality\n(Kahneman 2011). In the last few decades, many behavioral economists\nhave also begun to investigate cross cultural variation in economic\nbehavior, and to interpret findings in terms of the different norms\nof, e.g., fairness, equity, and cooperation adopted by their\nparticipants (e.g., Lesorogol 2007). Much of this evidence comes from\npatterns in how people from different cultures perform in economic\ngames (J. Henrich, Boyd, et al. 2001, 2005). Such variation, for\nexample, has been found in ultimatum game experiments, in which two\nparticipants bargain about how to divide a non-trivial sum of\nmoney. The first participant makes a proposal for how to divide the\nsum between the two, which is offered as an ultimatum to the\nother. The second participant can either accept or reject the\noffer. If she accepts, then both participants receive the respective\namounts specified by the proposal; if she rejects it, however, neither\nparticipant receives anything. If they were ideal economic agents,\nthen the first participant, acting from self-interest, would offer the\nlowest possible non-zero amount to the second participant, who would\naccept it because something is better than nothing. This result is\nquite rare in humans, however (though it is more common, intriguingly,\nin chimpanzees; see Jensen, Call, & Tomasello 2007). Actual people\ndo not just diverge from it, but diverge from it in different\nways. Several experiments found that cultural factors affect how\npeople tend to play the game, and that variability in norms and\nconceptions of fairness can help explain different patterns in the\noffers participants make and are willing to accept (Roth et al. 1991;\nthough see Oosterbeek, Sloof & van de Kuilen 2004 for discussion\nof difficulties in interpreting such results). Other experiments use a\nwider range of games to gather evidence of similar patterns of\ncultural variation in economic behavior (see J. Henrich, Boyd, et al.\n2004 for a collection of such work).\n\nAnother family of findings that is puzzling from the point of view of\nclassical economic rationality shows that individuals will routinely\npunish others even at a cost to themselves (Fehr & Gachter 2002;\nJ. Henrich, McElreath, et al. 2006). Evidence suggests that this\npropensity to punish is influenced by norms and other cultural factors\nas well (Bone, McAuliffe, & Raihani 2016). For example, in public\ngoods games participants are given a non-trivial sum of money and must\ndecide if and how much to contribute to a common pool over the course of\nseveral rounds. How much each investment pays off depends on how much\neveryone collectively contributes that round, so each\nparticipant\u2019s decisions should factor in the behavior of every\nother participant. In some versions, participants can also spend their\nmoney to punish others, based on knowledge of the contributions they\nhave made. Results indicate that some participants are willing to\nincur a cost to themselves to sanction low contributors, but also to\npunish high contributors, a surprising phenomenon called\nanti-social punishment. Participants from different cultures\nexhibit different patterns in their willingness to punish others,\nincluding in their enthusiasm for anti-social punishment (Herrman,\nTh\u00f6ni, and G\u00e4chter 2008). Another noteworthy aspect of\npunitive behavior revealed by behavioral economic experiments is that\nhumans are willing to punish even when they are mere bystanders to the\nincident that they are responding to. In such cases of third-party\npunishment, an individual enforces a norm despite the fact that\nshe is neither the offender who commits the violation and\nbecomes the target of the punishment, nor the offended who\nwas wronged or the victim affected by the transgression (Fehr &\nFischbacher 2004; though see Bone, Silva, & Raihani 2014).\n\nMore broadly, the general psychological propensity for punishment\nilluminated by this kind of empirical work has been claimed by\nresearchers to emerge early in humans (Schmidt & Tomasello 2012;\nMcAuliffe, Jordan, & Richerson 2015). Some have argued that it is\ncrucial to a host of features of human social life, including the\ngroup-level stabilization of norms (Boyd & Richerson 1992) and the\ncapacity to sustain cooperation on large scales (Price, Cosmides,\n& Tooby 2002; Mathew & Boyd 2011; Mathew, Boyd, & van\nVeelen 2013). Others have used such results to support inferences\nabout the character of normative psychology, including the nature of\nnormative motivation. For instance, Chudek and Henrich summarize\nseveral neuroeconomic studies (Fehr & Camerer 2007; Tabibnia,\nSatpute, & Lieberman 2008; and de Quervain et al. 2004) that\ninvestigate economic behavior using the methods and technology of\nneuroscience (i.e., fMRI) by pointing out that \n\n\nboth cooperating and punishing in locally normative ways activates the\nbrain\u2019s rewards or reward anticipation circuits in the same\nmanner as does obtaining a direct cash payment. (Chudek & Henrich\n2011: 224)\n\n",
