    "main_text": "Theory of Experience and Consciousness || Pure Experience\n2.1 Pure Experience\n\n\nStarting with An Inquiry Into the Good, Nishida\u2019s early work\ncalls into question two basic presuppositions of most modern\nepistemology: the assumptions that experience is individual and\nsubjective, and that it leads to knowledge only via a corrective\nprocess with input from the mind or other individuals. For Nishida,\nexperience in its original form is not the exercise of individuals\nequipped with sensory and mental abilities who contact an exterior\nworld; rather it precedes the differentiation into subject\nexperiencing and object experienced, and the individual is formed out\nof it. \u201cThe moment of seeing a color or hearing a sound\u201d\nis prior not only to the thought that the color or sound is the\nactivity of an external object or that one is sensing it, but also to\nthe judgment of what the color or sound might be (Nishida 1990a,\n3). \u201cPure experience\u201d names not only the basic form of\nevery sensuous and every intellectual experience, but also the\nfundamental form of reality, indeed the \u201cone and only\nreality\u201d from which all differentiated phenomena are to be\nunderstood. Cognitive activities such as thinking or judging, willing,\nand intellectual intuition are all derivative forms of pure experience\nbut still manifest it insofar as they are in action \u2014when thinking,\nwilling, etc. are going on. The experience of a running horse, for\nexample, underlies the judgment that the horse is running, and the\nactivity of judging is an exercise of pure experience prior to a\nsubsequent judgment that \u201cI am now judging.\u201d Objective\nphenomena likewise derive from pure experience; when unified they are\ncalled \u201cnature,\u201d while \u201cspirit\u201d names the\nactivity of unifying.  Pure experience launches the dynamic process of\nreality that differentiates into subjective and objective phenomena on\ntheir way to a higher unity, and the recapture of our unitary\nfoundation is what Nishida means by the Good.\n\n\nNishida would deny that his position is a kind of idealism, either\nsubjective or transcendental, because no subjective mind, human or\ndivine, is the origin of what is taken as reality, and no personified\nor ego-aware spirit is its beginning or end. His notion of pure\nexperience clearly shows the influence of William James, Ernst Mach,\nand others, but it differs from their notions as well as from\ntwentieth-century expositions of pre-reflective experience by its\nemphasis on the non-individuated character and the seamless\ndevelopment of such experience. It is the pre-individual basis of a\nsystematic and all-comprehensive process. If we call his view a\n\u201ctheory\u201d of experience, we should be aware that from his\nstandpoint the theory is a natural outgrowth of unitary experience and\nnot a reflection on it as proceeding from a different source. The\nquestion of how pure experience grounds reflective knowledge would\noccupy Nishida in works composed after An Inquiry Into the\nGood.\n\n\nThe directness, relative simplicity, and systematic approach of this\nbook made it perhaps the most accessible and popular of his\nworks; and many commentators have tended to emphasize it more than\nlater writings, despite Nishida\u2019s own misgivings about its latent\npsychologism. Indeed Nishida\u2019s initial position anticipates several\ndevelopments in his later thought.  For example, the early statements\nof experience prior to a subject experiencing and an object\nexperienced are re-formulated in the late 1920s as \u201cseeing\nwithout a seer, hearing without a hearer.\u201d The nullification of\nthe self in pure experience is later expressed as seeing the self from\nthe perspective of the world, where world is understood phenomenologically as a\ndetermining horizon of experience. The notion of the individual as\ndetermined by the universal concealed within (Nishida 1990a, 18)\npre-figures Nishida\u2019s later adaptation of Hegel\u2019s concrete universal;\nthe later works speak of the individual as the self-determination of\nthe universal. Finally, the ways in which pure experience can be said\nto be most concrete, to enfold all reality and indicate its\nundifferentiated ground, reflect methods that characterize Nishida\u2019s\nphilosophy as a whole.\n",
