    "main_text": "\n\nIn 1926, Mally presented the first formal system of deontic logic. His\nsystem had several consequences which Mally regarded as surprising but\ndefensible. It also had a consequence (\u201cA is obligatory if and\nonly if A is the case\u201d) which Menger (1939) and almost all later\ndeontic logicians have regarded as unacceptable. We will not only\ndescribe Mally\u2019s system but also discuss how it may be repaired.\n",
