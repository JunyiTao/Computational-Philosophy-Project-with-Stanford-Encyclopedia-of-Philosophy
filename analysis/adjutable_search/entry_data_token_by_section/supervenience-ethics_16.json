    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism || Analytic and conceptual explanations of ethical supervenience\n4.4 Analytic and conceptual explanations of ethical supervenience\n\nThis and the next subsection consider attempts to explain the\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical by appealing to conceptual\nor ethical premises.\n\nThe first such strategy appeals to analytic or conceptual truths.\nSuppose that an ethical realist accepts the popular view that ethical\nsupervenience is an analytic truth. She might put her view this\nway:\n\nAnalytic\n\nIt is an analytic truth that: if two metaphysically possible entities\nare alike in all base respects, they are alike in all ethical\nrespects.\n\n\nThe core idea is that the truth of Analytic explains the truth of the\nsupervenience thesis that it embeds (Intuitive Metaphysical). On this\naccount, the ethical and the base properties covary because it is\ndefinitional of \u2018ethical\u2019 that nothing could\ncount as an ethical property unless it covaried in this way. This\nstrategy claims to meet the bruteness challenge: the necessary\nconnection is explained by the way a property would have to be, in\norder to be what we talk about when we talk about ethical properties\n(cf. Stratton-Lake and Hooker 2006).\n\nConsider three brief worries about this strategy. The first is that on\nsome influential contemporary accounts of analyticity, analyticity\ndoes not guarantee truth. For example, one account of analyticity is\nthat for a sentence \u2018S\u2019 to be analytic in a language L is\nfor competence with L to dispose a speaker to accept \u2018S\u2019.\nAnd some philosophers (e.g. Eklund 2002) have argued that there are\ninconsistent sets of sentences that satisfy this condition. If this is\nright, Intuitive Metaphysical\u2019s being analytic in\nEnglish would not guarantee its being true.\n\nThe second worry is broadly intuitive. Analytic alone does not appear\nto guarantee that the supervenience of the ethical follows\nfrom the other aspects of the nature of ethical properties. And this\nsuggests that, for all Analytic says, we can conceive of ethical*\nproperties, which have every feature characteristic of ethical\nproperties, except that they do not supervene. But this may lead us to\nwonder: why give the ethical properties the role in our lives that we\ndo, and ignore the ethical* properties, just because they do not\nsupervene? (For a related point, see the end of Mabrito 2005.)\n\nThe third worry is that even if the truth of Analytic entails the\ntruth of Intuitive Metaphysical, it nonetheless arguably does nothing\nto explain why the supervenience relationship holds. Consider\nan analogy: suppose that the infallible oracle tells you that a\ncertain ethical supervenience thesis holds. This testimony does\nnothing to explain why that supervenience thesis holds (compare\nMcPherson 2012, 221\u2013222, and Dreier 2015, 2019). Like the\noracle\u2019s testimony, one might think that learning the truth of\nAnalytic would simply reinforce our confidence in the very thesis\n(Intuitive Metaphysical) that we were hoping to explain.\n\nMy exposition of these three worries (like the rest of this entry thus\nfar) has followed the common practice of lumping together the notions\nof analytic truth and conceptual truth. Terence\nCuneo and Russ Shafer-Landau (2014) have argued that distinguishing\nthese two notions permits them to develop an attractive form of moral\nrealism, and also enables them to explain the supervenience of the\nmoral properties. They distinguish analytic and conceptual truth as\nfollows: for a sentence to be analytically true is for it to\nbe true in virtue of the meanings of the terms that constitute it. By\ncontrast, for a proposition to be a conceptual truth is for\nit to be true wholly in virtue of the essences of its constituent\nconcepts (ibid., 410\u201311). Concepts, in turn, are to be\nunderstood as abstract non-mental objects. One has a propositional\nthought in virtue of being appropriately related to some of these\nobjects.\n\nCuneo and Shafer-Landau then offer what they call a \u2018reversal\nargument\u2019, which entails that some conceptual truths about\nmorality are \u2018fact-makers\u2019: that is, some of the facts\nabout the distribution of moral properties are grounded in facts about\nmoral concepts (ibid., 418\u2013421). This puts them in a position to\navoid the complaint that I just made about Analytic: on their view,\nconceptual truths really do metaphysically explain (some) of the\nrelations between the moral and the base properties. They then propose\nthat such connections quite generally explain the supervenience of the\nmoral.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the commitments of this ingenious proposal.\nConsider one central issue. Cuneo and Shafer-Landau argue for the\nexistence of several substantive-seeming conceptual truths about\nmorality. As they admit, their view is quite heterodox in virtue of\nthis. However, they nowhere claim that all necessary moral\ntruths can be explained as conceptual truths. That, of course, would\nbe a much stronger claim, and much harder to motivate. However,\nIntuitive Metaphysical is a quite general modal covariance thesis, and\nin light of this, only the stronger claim would suffice to explain its\ntruth.\n",
