    "main_text": "Introduction || The Modern Revision of the Square\n1.1 The Modern Revision of the Square\n\n\nMost contemporary logic texts symbolize the traditional forms as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nEvery S is P\n\u2200x(Sx \u2192\nPx)\n\n\nNo S is P\n\u2200x(Sx \u2192\n\u00acPx)\n\n\nSome S is P\n\u2203x(Sx &\nPx)\n\n\nSome S is not P\n\u2203x(Sx &\n\u00acPx)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this symbolization is adopted along with standard views about the\nlogic of connectives and quantifiers, the relations embodied in the\ntraditional square mostly disappear. The modern diagram looks like\nthis:\nTHE MODERN REVISED SQUARE: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has too little structure to be particularly useful, and so it\nis not commonly used. According to Alonzo Church, this modern view\nprobably originated sometime in the late nineteenth\n century.[1]\n This representation of the four forms is now generally accepted,\nexcept for qualms about the loss of subalternation in the left-hand\ncolumn. Most English speakers tend to understand \u2018Every\nS is P\u2019 as requiring for its truth that there\nbe some Ss, and if that requirement is imposed, then\nsubalternation holds for affirmative propositions.  Every modern logic\ntext must address the apparent implausibility of letting \u2018Every\nS is P\u2019 be true when there are no\nSs. The common defense of this is usually that this is a\nlogical notation devised for purposes of logic, and it does not claim\nto capture every nuance of the natural language forms that the symbols\nresemble. So perhaps\n \u2018\u2200x(Sx \u2192\nPx)\u2019 does fail to do complete justice to\nordinary usage of \u2018Every S is P\u2019, but\nthis is not a problem with the logic.  If you think that \u2018Every\nS is P\u2019 requires for its truth that there be\nSs, then you can have that result simply and easily: just\nrepresent the recalcitrant uses of \u2018Every S is\nP\u2019 in symbolic notation by adding an extra conjunct to\nthe symbolization, like this:\n \u2200x(Sx\n \u2192 Px)\n &\n \u2203xSx.\n\n\nThis defense leaves logic intact and also meets the objection, which\nis not a logical objection, but merely a reservation about the\nrepresentation of natural language.\n\n\nAuthors typically go on to explain that we often wish to make\ngeneralizations in science when we are unsure of whether or not they\nhave instances, and sometimes even when we know they do not, and they\nsometimes use this as a defense of symbolizing the A\nform so as to allow it to be vacuously true. This is an\nargument from convenience of notation, and does not bear on logical\ncoherence.\n",
