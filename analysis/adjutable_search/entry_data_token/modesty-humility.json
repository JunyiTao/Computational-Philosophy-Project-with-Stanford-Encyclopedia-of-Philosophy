Such a person seems to\nhave an ethical shortcoming; what they\u2019re missing, you might\nthink to yourself, is a bit of modesty or humility. Modesty and\nhumility are ways that we relate to ourselves, to our own goodness and\nlimitations. It involves placing ourselves among others and in the\nworld at large. Immodest people have, among other things, an inflated\nsense of themselves, their accomplishments, and their place in the\nworld.\n\n\nPhilosophers have been particularly drawn to the seemingly paradoxical\naspects of modesty and humility. Saying \u201cI\u2019m modest\u201d\nsounds like a self-undermining joke in a way that saying\n\u201cI\u2019m compassionate\u201d does not.

Modesty and Humility\n\n\nThe feature of modesty and humility that has most captivated\nphilosophers is its elusive nature. It seems as though knowing that\nyou\u2019re modest somehow spoils it; the modest person, it seems,\nmust be unaware of their own modesty. Modesty can seem to be, as\nSorensen (1988) puts it, a kind of ethical blindspot: If you have it\nyou won\u2019t know it (and if you seem to know you have it, you\nprobably don\u2019t really!)\n\n\nThe fact that knowing about your own modesty seems to spoil it\nsuggests what seems, to some at least, to be a troubling tension\nbetween epistemic and moral goods. Can there really be something\nmorally good about forming biased beliefs about your own goodness? Many\nimagine that perfect moral virtue must be compatible with perfect\nknowledge. An extreme version is Plato\u2019s identification of virtue\nand knowledge in the Meno, but even less extreme views can\nfind the idea that moral virtues might require epistemic defects to be\ntroubling, or at least interesting.\n\n\nThis raises a few general issues. The first is what, if any, special\nrequirements there are regarding how we relate to ourselves. Perhaps\nforcing myself to skip lunch to finish the job is not morally different\nfrom forcing someone else to skip lunch to finish the job, but they\ncertainly feel different. This suggests that we cannot always relate to\nourselves in the same way as we relate to others.\n\n\nThese issues are related to debates about what makes modesty or\nhumility morally virtuous at all. Debates about modesty and humility\nare often battles in larger wars about the nature of virtue more\ngenerally.\n1.1 Varieties and Distinctions\n\n\nPhilosophical work on modesty and humility brackets several senses\nof these terms. Philosophical accounts typically do not aim, for\nexample, to capture uses of \u2018modest\u2019 that apply to objects\nas when we say \u201cHe lives in a modest house\u201d or \u201cShe\nhas a modest income\u201d. The sexual sense of modesty, involving\ndress and behavior that presents a non-sexual image, is typically also\nbracketed (see Driver 1989, Statman 1992, Bommarito 2013), though some\naccounts aim to capture this use of the term as well; see Schueler\n(1997, 482), McMullin (2010, 785\u2013786), and Wilson (2014, 79).\n\n\nThere is disagreement about both terms and concepts. Many theorists\ntreat the terms \u2018modesty\u2019 and \u2018humility\u2019 as\ninterchangeable. Hare (1996), Schueler (1997), Hurka (2001), Raterman\n(2006), Garcia (2006), Kellenberger (2010), and Um (forthcoming), to\nname just a few, all treat the terms as referring to more or less the\nsame phenomenon. Others take the different terms to refer to very\ndifferent concepts. There is some historical precedent for this;\nAquinas, for example, considers both modesty and humility to be types\nof temperance (see Summa Theologica 2.2 Q.160 and Foley 2004).\n\n\nAmong those who do draw a distinction between the concepts, there is\nlittle agreement about what exactly the difference is. For some, the\ndifference is between public and private domains. Statman (1992,\n438n45) claims that modesty has an external domain while humility does\nnot and Sinha (2012, 265) says that modesty is public while humility is\nprivate. For others, they have different epistemic requirements:\nBen-Ze\u2019ev (1993, 240) and Nuyen (1998, 101) claim that humility\ninvolves underrating oneself, while modesty does not. Driver (1998,\n378f5), however, claims the opposite making modesty involve underrating\nand humility not. This article will take both terms to refer to a\ngeneral response to one\u2019s own goodness or achievements and will\nuse the term that the author under consideration uses when discussing\nparticular views.\n1.2 Key Features\n\n\nModesty has several key features that theoretical accounts aim to\ncapture. These are explicitly stated in Driver (1989 and 2001) and are\ntaken up in most work on modesty since then.\n\nDependent Virtue: Slote (1983, 61ff) notes that\nmodesty is a dependent virtue. One is modest about something\nelse that is good, about their success or intelligence. In this sense,\nmodesty requires the existence of another good quality. This is\ntypically taken to be something objectively good rather than simply\nsomething that the person thinks is good, though most views\ncan accommodate either intuition. Most views assume that the good\nquality in question is a good quality of the person who is modest,\nthough Bommarito (2013, 94) broadens the scope to allow modesty about\nthe good qualities in others when they reflect on us, as when one is\nmodest about the achievements of their child, nation, or local sports\nteams. Others, such as Ben-Ze\u2019ev (1993) and Um (forthcoming), go\nfurther and deny that modesty is a dependent virtue at all.\n\nFalse Modesty: Theories of modesty also need to be\nable to distinguish modesty from false modesty. That is, some people\nwho are not modest can act as if they are. This rules out accounts of\nmodesty that are entirely behavioral. If being modest is simply a\nmatter of certain external behaviors, then there would be no way to\ndistinguish modesty from false modesty. Modesty and humility require\ncertain mental states in addition to overt behaviors.\n\nSelf-Attribution Strangeness: Self-predications of\nmodesty and humility are, at least in general, self-undermining. This\nis highlighted by Sorensen (1988, 120ff) and Driver (1989, 375) who\nnote that the sentence \u201cI am modest\u201d is a distinctly\nimmodest thing to say. Though Raterman (2006, 232) and\nBommarito (2013, 113) describe contexts in which saying \u201cI am\nmodest\u201d is not self-undermining, self-ascriptions of modesty are,\nin general, self-undermining. It is important to note that this need\nnot be about public utterances; a person seems less modest for\nthinking about how modest they are. Bernard Williams, for\nexample, writes that \u201c\u2026 it is a notorious truth that a\nmodest person does not act under the title of modesty\u201d (1993,\n10). That is, a modest person does not think of themselves as acting\nmodestly, while a just person typically does think of themselves as\nacting justly.\n1.3 Normative Status\n\n\nIn addition to the descriptive features outlined above, accounts of\nmodesty and humility also aim to explain its normative\nstatus\u2014why does modesty or humility count as a virtue? Most\ncontemporary work assumes that modesty and humility are genuine moral\nvirtues. Of course, not all philosophers have agreed. Aristotle and\nDavid Hume in particular are often singled out as denying that modesty\nor humility really are virtuous.\n\n\nRaterman (2006, 222) and Brennan (2007, 112) both claim that\nAristotle denies that modesty is a virtue, as he thinks that a virtuous\nperson is justified in making claims about their own merit. Some have\nalso had a hard time squaring virtues like modesty and humility with\nAristotle\u2019s ideal of the great-souled man\n(megalopsuchos), who deserves honors and knows it (see\nNicomachean Ethics IV.3). \nThose working in a religious context influenced by Aristotle have to\nbalance these competing ideals; see Foley (2004, 407ff.) and McCloskey\n(2006, 183). Some passages used to support the idea that Aristotle\ndenies modesty is a virtue (Nicomachean Ethics 1108a32 and\n1128b10\u201335) concern the Greek term aid\u014ds, which is\nsometimes translated as \u2018modesty\u2019 but also commonly\nrendered as \u2018shame\u2019. Some modern interpreters have drawn\nfrom Aristotle to support the idea that modesty is a virtue:\nDriver (1989, 380) notes that Aristotle says the truthful person is\ninclined to understate the truth (Nicomachean Ethics\n1127b4\u20138), Winter (2012) draws heavily from Aristotle in\ndefending modesty as a virtue, and Hazlett (2012) defends intellectual\nhumility as an Aristotelian mean state between dogmatism and\ntimidity. Whatever Aristotle\u2019s view of modesty, other Greek\nphilosophers use the term\naid\u014ds to name a virtue. Epictetus, for example, uses it\nto refer to a good quality that involves taking other people\u2019s\n point of view into consideration; see\n Epictetus: Appropriate Other-Concern\n and the discussion in Kamtekar (1998).\n\n\nHume is another historical figure who at least doubted whether modesty\nis a virtue. Hume includes modesty in his list of \u201cmonkish\nvirtues\u201d\u2014various non-virtuous traits associated with\nself-denial that masquerade as virtues. Other examples of monkish\nvirtues given by Hume include celibacy, fasting, silence, and\nsolitude. According to Hume these pseudo-virtues \u201c\u2026\nstupefy the understanding and harden the heart, obscure the fancy and\nsour the temper\u201d (Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nMorals sec. IX). Elsewhere, however, Hume seems more positive\nabout modesty as when he writes:\n\n\nBut its [modesty\u2019s] most usual meaning is when it is opposed to\nimpudence and arrogance, and expresses a diffidence of our own\njudgement, and a due attention and regard for others. In young men\nchiefly, this quality is a sure sign of good sense; and is also the\ncertain means of augmenting that endowment, by preserving their ears\nopen to instruction, and making them still grasp after new\nattainments. But it has a further charm to every spectator; by\nflattering every man\u2019s vanity, and presenting the appearance of\na docile pupil, who receives, with proper attention and respect, every\nword they utter. (Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\nsec. VIII)\n\n\nHume takes virtues to be qualities that are useful or agreeable but\nseems to have had mixed feelings about modesty at least. Davie (1999)\nand Reed (2012) have argued that the so-called monkish virtues may\ncount as virtues even by Hume\u2019s standard.\n\n\nModesty\u2019s status as a virtue has been liminal for other figures\ntoo. Benjamin Franklin initially excluded humility when drawing up a\nlist of virtues he wished to develop. He added it only after a Quaker\nfriend mentioned that Franklin was often overbearing and insolent in\nconversation (1771/1982, 84). His description of humility reads\nsimply: \u201cImitate Jesus and Socrates\u201d (77). This\nanticipates contemporary discussion of intellectual humility and its\nrole as both a moral and epistemic virtue.\n\n\nAgain, the bulk of contemporary work assumes that modesty and humility\nare virtues and sees the main challenge as explaining why. For many it\nwas seen as valuable because of its theological role: Aquinas says\nthat humility is important because it makes one open to God\u2019s\ngrace (see Summa Theologica 2.2 Q.161 and Keys 2003). Others\nhave found it virtuous because of the non-religious good effects it\nproduces, like combating jealousy and making social interactions run\nmore smoothly. Others locate the source of its virtuousness in the\nunderlying attitude it manifests, things like kindness and concern for\nothers. Still others argue that it is virtuous because it is a fitting\nresponse to certain morally relevant features of the world like the\nequal moral status of all people. What modesty is and why it is\nvaluable are related questions and the following sections will give an\noverview of contemporary views on both questions.\n\n\nThe following presentation of the various contemporary views of\nmodesty and humility will focus on presenting only the positive\naccounts and not objections to the various positions. The dialectic of\nthe literature typically takes the form of examples and\ncounter-examples, many of which require a good deal of description to\nbe compelling. So in the interest of space, the descriptions of the\nvarious views will focus on presenting only the positive accounts.\n2. Doxastic Accounts\n\n\nDoxastic accounts explain modesty and its value by appeal to the\npresence or absence of certain beliefs. The relevant beliefs are\ntypically self-evaluations, beliefs about our own value, skill, or\ngoodness. The content of the relevant beliefs is sometimes taken to be\ncomparative and sometimes not\u2014think of the difference between\nthinking that you\u2019re really great and thinking that you are\nbetter than others.\n\n\nIgnorance accounts explain modesty by appeal to states that are\nepistemically defective in some way; the modest person either lacks\ncertain beliefs about their own goodness or has false beliefs that\ninvolve underrating themselves. Accuracy accounts, on the other hand,\naim to remove any tension between epistemic and moral virtue and so\nexplain modesty via beliefs that are epistemically good. On these\nviews, modesty is at its heart about getting it right about\none\u2019s place in the world. Strong accuracy accounts make modesty\nincompatible with ignorance. For these views modesty is essentially\nabout having accurate beliefs. Weak accuracy accounts deny that\nmodesty requires an epistemic defect, but leave it open whether moral\nvirtue is compatible with epistemic vices.\n2.1 Ignorance\n\n\nJulia Driver\u2019s account of modesty kicked off a modern revival in\nwork on the virtue. For Driver (1989 and 2001), the modest person is\nsomeone who is ignorant of their own good qualities in certain ways.\nThis was hinted at, but not developed, by Henry Sidgwick:\n\u201chumility prescribes a low opinion of our merits: but if our\nmerits are comparably high, it seems strange to direct us to have a\nlow opinion of them\u201d (1907/1981, 334). He later denies that\nthere is anything virtuous about having a low self-opinion, but Driver\ndevelops this idea and discusses a range of moral virtues that require\nignorance: blind charity (seeing the good in others while remaining\nignorant of the bad), impulsive courage, certain refusals to hold\ngrudges, some types of innocence, and of course, modesty.\n\n\nDriver\u2019s account is sometimes called an \u2018ignorance\u2019\naccount and other times an \u2018underestimation\u2019 account as\nthe modest person need not be completely ignorant of their own good\nqualities, just underestimate them. As she points out (1999, 828),\nthis need not require a low estimation as one can underestimate a good\nquality while still thinking it pretty good overall. The modest\nperson, on this account, is someone who wrongly believes that they are\nnot as good as they really are in some respect. This is taken to\nexplain the key features of modesty: it is a dependent virtue since\nthere is another quality one is ignorant of, it is not purely\nbehavioral so allows for false modesty, and it recognizes\nself-attribution strangeness, since modesty itself is a good\nquality.\n\n\nThis account is set against the background of a more general account\nof virtue. Driver defends a consequentialist account of virtue where\ntraits are virtuous when they, in general, produce good effects\n(Driver, 2001). This view of virtue makes it easy to accommodate\nmorally virtuous traits that involve epistemic defects since some\nepistemic defects might turn out to produce better effects in the long\nrun.\n Accounts of virtue inspired by Aristotle,\n however, make virtue a matter of\npractical wisdom which makes moral virtue incompatible with epistemic\ndefects. It\u2019s important to note that while Driver\u2019s early\nwork makes modesty require ignorance, the weaker claim that moral\nvirtue is compatible with ignorance is enough to make problems for\nAristotelian accounts of virtue (see Driver 1999). Accuracy accounts of\nmodesty and humility are largely responses to Driver that are typically\nmotivated to deny the idea that moral virtue can require, or even be\ncompatible with, ignorance and false belief.\n2.2 Strong Accuracy\n\n\nStrong accuracy accounts not only deny that modesty is compatible\nwith ignorance, but defend the idea that modesty is, at its heart,\nabout having certain true beliefs. On some views, humility does involve\nunderestimation, but only as a means to accurate self-assessment. Foot\n(1978/2002, 9) and Slote (1983, 61\u201362) both note that humility is a\ncorrective to a general human tendency to think too highly of\nourselves. No evidence is offered in support of this empirical claim,\nbut its truth will require considering how self-evaluation works in\ndifferent contexts, skill levels, cultures, and temperaments.\n\n\nMany strong accuracy accounts are called \u2018egalitarian\u2019 or\n\u2018equitable\u2019 views. These accounts make modesty a matter of\na particular kind of correct belief. Drawing on Kantian ideas about\nthe equal moral status of all rational agents, these views root\nmodesty in a the accurate recognition of people\u2019s equal moral\nstatus. So for Ben-Ze\u2019ev (1993) modesty is a matter of knowledge\nof the equal moral worth of everyone and accurately seeing that\nparticular good qualities do not affect this worth. Hare (1996, 240)\ndistinguishes one\u2019s \u201cmoral worth as a person\u201d (a\nstatic and invariable value) from one\u2019s \u201cworth as a moral\nperson\u201d (a value that can be affected by good qualities) and\nsees modesty as rooted in a recognition of the former.\n\n\nSince modesty is a matter of knowing the equal moral worth of all\npeople, defenders of this view sometimes deny that modesty is a\ndependent virtue since one can have the relevant knowledge while\nlacking any good qualities oneself (see Ben-Ze\u2019ev 1993). They\nalso sometimes deny that immoral people, or people who deny the equal\nmoral worth of everyone, can ever be modest at all; see Nuyen (1998,\n107) and Statman (1992, 434).\n\n\nAnother type of strong accuracy view appeals to different scales of\nevaluation. This type of view is defended by Brennan (2007), who\nattributes it to Adam Smith (see Theory of Moral Sentiments 6.3.22\u201323; it is also considered and rejected by Sidgwick 1907/1981,\n334\u20135). On this view, modest people evaluate themselves relative to an\nideal but evaluate others relative to practical norms. So modest people\nrightly think of themselves as not very good (compared to an ideal like\na saint), and can rightly think of other people as being good (relative\nto how good most people actually are). Having two scales allows the\nmodest person to make accurate assessments of themselves and others,\n albeit with regard to different evaluative standards. (See also\n asymmetry accounts\n below).\n\n\nA third type of strong accuracy account requires accuracy about both\nour own good qualities and how those qualities are received by others.\nMcMullin (2010) defends this type of account, requiring that the modest\nperson acknowledge both the legitimacy of public standards and that\none\u2019s worth is not fully defined by them. Though she also\n requires tendencies to foster the welfare of others (as in\n kindness accounts\n below), these are rooted in an\naccurate understanding of oneself and one\u2019s place in the social\nworld.\n\n\nStrong accuracy accounts, by explaining modesty and humility by\nappeal to knowledge, not only deny that modesty requires ignorance or\nfalse belief, but make modesty incompatible with it.\u00a0\n2.3 Weak Accuracy\n\n\nWeak accuracy accounts are typically motivated by the wish to deny\nthat moral virtues can require epistemic defects like ignorance or\nfalse beliefs. They differ from strong accuracy accounts, however, in\nthat they strictly speaking allow that modesty or humility is\ncompatible with epistemic defects. For most defenders of these views,\nhowever, the ideal case will be of moral virtue without any ignorance\nor false belief.\n\n\nNon-overestimation accounts deny that modesty or humility requires\nunderestimation and instead claim that all that is required is not\noverestimating one\u2019s own good qualities. Flanagan (1990) defends\nthis kind of account for modesty and Richards (1988) for humility. This\nkind of account allows that the modest or humble person can have\naccurate self-knowledge. It also makes the virtue compatible with\nignorance since one way of not overestimating one\u2019s good\nqualities is to underestimate them, though Flanagan claims that\n\u201cideally\u201d this will not happen (1990, 427).\n\n\nAnother type of weak accuracy account is the de-emphasis account.\nDefended by Ridge (2000) this account makes modesty a matter of\nde-emphasizing one\u2019s good qualities for the right reasons.\nDe-emphasizing here includes things like not going out of your way to\nstress the significance of your good qualities. This kind of account\nallows modesty to be compatible with accurate self-knowledge, though\nde-emphasis is also compatible with inaccurate self-assessment too.\n\n\nFinally, Raterman (2006) defends a reluctance account of modesty. On\nthis account a person is modest when they are reluctant to evaluate\nthemselves in terms of their good qualities. This allows the modest\nperson to have accurate self-knowledge as long as they are reluctant to\nevaluate themselves through the lens of their good qualities. Though it\ndoes not require ignorance, various inaccurate self-assessments are\ncompatible with being reluctant to self-evaluate in these ways. This\naccount has the benefit of providing a more nuanced view of when\nself-ascriptions of modesty are self-undermining; Raterman points out\nthat his account allows that saying \u201cI am modest\u201d in a\nquiet conversation with a close friend need not be self-undermining\n(2006, 232).\n3. Non-Doxastic Accounts\n\n\nNon-doxastic accounts do not attempt to explain modesty or humility by\nappeal to beliefs or belief-like states at all. For these accounts the\nvirtue may be compatible with ignorance or it may not\nbe\u2014it\u2019s not about one\u2019s beliefs at all. There is a\nwide range of such accounts and they see modesty or humility as being\nrooted in very different kinds of states and relations.\n\n\nHow compatible these various views are is an interpretive issue.\nRead as highlighting a key feature of modesty or humility, many do not\nrule the others out; attention, proportion, and kindness can all be\ncritical features of modesty. They may also be read, and often are\nintended, as describing the fundamental feature that explains all\nothers and in this sense they are genuine rivals that rule each other\nout.\n3.1 Proportion\n\n\nHurka (2001, 110\u2013111) sees modesty and humility as virtues of\nproportion. For him, attitudes should be proportionate to the absolute\ngoodness of their object. This involves a denial of an asymmetry that\nsome (Maes 2004) see as central to modesty; one\u2019s responses\nshould track absolute goodness regardless of whether the object is our\nown good qualities or those of another. Though he acknowledges that\nthis will involve some cognitive states, what must be proportionate for\nHurka are positive responses like pleasure or enjoyment. This account\nrequires accuracy in the sense that one\u2019s responses must be\naccurately proportioned to the goodness of the object, but not in the\nsense that it requires accurate beliefs about one\u2019s own good\nqualities.\n3.2 Indifference\n\n\nMany theorists have seen modesty as rooted in a special kind of\nindifference. Typically this is an indifference to praise, the high\nranking relative to others, or positive evaluation by others. Schueler\n(1997), for example, sees modesty as being indifferent to being\nevaluated highly on the basis of one\u2019s good qualities. Though he\nassumes that the modest person will have an accurate self-image, this\nis not entailed by his account. A similar account is given by Arpaly\nand Schroeder (2014, 245\u2013250) who see being modest as not caring about\nhow you are ranked relative to others. Often, they note, this will have\nignorance as a side effect, but what is essential to modesty is a kind\nof indifference.\n\n\nRoberts and Wood (2003) give a similar account of humility, opposing\nit to the vices of vanity and arrogance. For them, lacking vanity means\nbeing unconcerned with the opinions of others and lacking arrogance\nmeans being unconcerned with entitlements that come along with social\nrecognition of good qualities. Again, this is not doxastic but instead\ndiscussed as a kind of emotional insensitivity (2003, 261).\n\n\nThough not explicitly discussing modesty or humility, many Buddhist\nthinkers defend virtues rooted in a similar kind of indifference. To\noppose pride or arrogance (Sanskrit m\u0101na), Buddhist\nthinkers often advocate for a kind of equanimity that involves a kind\nof indifference to external resentment and approval as it counteracts\nforms of self-attachment that are thought to produce suffering. See\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s Path of Purification IX.91, chapter seven\nof \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s Training Anthology, and the\ndiscussion in McRae (2013 and 2016, 101ff.).\n3.3 Asymmetry\n\n\nAsymmetry accounts explain modesty not in terms of particular\nstates, but in different norms governing self and other. Maes (2004)\nemphasizes differences between what we can acceptably say or think\nabout ourselves and others. So, for example, saying \u201cI deserve a\nstanding ovation\u201d is very different from \u201cShe deserves a\nstanding ovation\u201d (2004, 489). Utterances and thoughts about\nourselves have special norms that are different from those concerning\nothers.\n\n\nThis is in stark contrast with views that see modesty rooted in\nattitudes that apply to everyone, like egalitarian accounts. Modesty on\nthis view is not about seeing some features of the world that apply to\neveryone, but instead seeing how different norms apply to\nself-references. What explains modesty\u2019s self-attribution\nstrangeness on this view is a more general difference in self-regarding\nattitudes; Maes (2004, 490ff.) also discusses, for example, gift-giving\nand receiving compliments in this way too.\n3.4 Kindness\n\n\nMany accounts see modesty or humility as a special type of\nbenevolence or kindness. On these views, it is a way of valuing and\npromoting the wellbeing of others. These views make modesty not merely\na trait of an individual, but deeply social in nature. So Woodcock\n(2008) sees modesty as about balancing one\u2019s own welfare with the\nwelfare of others. Wilson (2014) describes it as a type of kindness, a\nsensitivity to the well-being of others when presenting our own good\nqualities. Sinha (2012, 261) makes a similar claim about humility\ndescribing \u201cpublic humility\u201d as not claiming credit out of\nconcern for the feelings of others.\n\n\nIn addition to making modesty or humility more strongly social in\nnature, these accounts make modesty compatible with epistemic defects\nbut do not require them. One can exhibit the kindness and concern for\nothers these accounts associate with modesty regardless of the accuracy\nof one\u2019s self-assessments.\n3.5 Attention\n\n\nAttention accounts of modesty see it as rooted in patterns of\nmotivated conscious attention. Bommarito (2013) argues that being\nmodest is a matter of motivated inattention to one\u2019s own good\nqualities and attention to external factors that brought them about.\nIt\u2019s not that the modest person doesn\u2019t know about their\ngood qualities, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t think about them very\noften. And when they do think about them, they tend to emphasize the\nrole of situational factors in bringing them about, emphasizing things\nlike having good teachers, supportive parents, or fortunate\ncircumstances. A similar proposal is hinted at by Hastings Rashdall\nwhen he describes immodesty as \u201c\u2026 habitual dwelling with\nsatisfaction upon one\u2019s own capacities or one\u2019s own\nmerits\u201d (1907, 205).\n\n\nSuch habits of attention are compatible with, but do not require\nignorance. This view allows Bommarito (2013, 113) to highlight cases\nwhere uttering the sentence \u201cI am modest\u201d does not seem\nself-undermining as when others are publicly discussing one\u2019s\nmodesty and only an admission will allow the conversation to move on\nto other topics. He later discusses modesty as an \u201cinner\nvirtue\u201d that can be involuntary and lack any outward behavioral\nexpression; see Bommarito (2018, 160\u2013169).\n3.6 Executive\n\n\nSome have seen modesty as being essentially related to the execution\nof other virtues. Statman (1992, 435) calls modesty a\n\u201cwill-power\u201d virtue and likens it to courage, self-control,\nand patience. These virtues help one to overcome inclinations that are\ncontrary to virtue and so serve to help one overcome moral\nobstacles.\n\n\nVarious philosophers have seen modesty as functioning as a brake on\ncertain bad tendencies. Iris Murdoch, for example, sees humility as a\nbrake on pride; see Milligan (2007) for a detailed discussion of\nhumility in Murdoch. Foley (2004) highlights a similar strand in\nAquinas, who describes modesty and humility as moderating desires for\npersonal excellence. Kant sometimes describes humility as moderation\nnot of our personal desires, but of our demands on others\n(Doctrine of Virtue 6:462). While Sidgwick (1907/1981, 335)\ndescribes the function of humility as, in part, repressing certain\nemotions of self-admiration.\n\n\nUm (forthcoming) sees modesty as an \u201cexecutive\nvirtue\u201d\u2014one that, like courage, helps to promote the ends\nof other virtues. Though on this account modesty itself has no\npositive aim, he highlights that this does not mean that modesty has\nmerely a negative function; it is not merely a brake on inclinations,\nbut has a positive role of promoting the ends of other moral\nvirtues.\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nModesty and humility concern how we relate to our own good\nqualities. In an epistemic context, they concern how we relate to the\ntruth or rationality of our own beliefs rather than good qualities more\ngenerally. Discussions of intellectual humility or modesty involve how\nwe relate to our own beliefs, views and judgements. Though sometimes\ndiscussed in a purely epistemic context, these often blur the line\nbetween moral and epistemic virtues, as in the case of\nopen-mindedness.\n4.1 Anti-Expertise\n\n\n To be an\n anti-expert\n about a topic is to be reliably wrong about that topic. Egan and Elga\n(2005) distinguish being unreliable, as when a compass does not point\nnorth when facing north, from being anti-reliable, as when a compass\npoints south when facing north. They also give the example of\ndirections while driving: When someone is an anti-expert about\ndirections, whenever they think they should go left they should really\ngo right and whenever they think they should go right, they should\nreally go left.\n\n\nSorensen (1988) argues that one\u2019s own anti-expertise is a\nblindspot; it is a true proposition that one cannot rationally accept.\nHe argues that one cannot rationally believe that their own beliefs are\nfalse since the anti-expert\u2019s belief in something counts as\nevidence against believing it. Egan and Elga (2005) also argue that one\ncannot rationally believe oneself to be an anti-expert. So in the\ndriving case, they say that one should withhold belief about which way\nto go.\n\n\nBut suppose that whenever the person withholds, it turns out they\nshould go left. In this case, withholding does not escape the problem.\nLike modesty, there are special issues with self-ascription; one can\naccept that others are anti-experts with no problems, but\nself-ascription seems self-undermining. In this sense, it can be seen\nas a limit on epistemic modesty\u2014rationality prohibits one from\nthinking that their own faculties are anti-reliable. So, in the more\ndifficult directions example, Sorensen (1987, 308ff.) claims one cannot\nrationally believe that one is in such a situation. Gilbert (1971)\nmakes a similar claim in the moral domain, arguing that there are\nrational limits on the self-ascription of moral vices.\n\n\nOthers have argued that it is possible to self-ascribe\nanti-expertise. Conee (1987) does this by suggesting that one can\nbelieve the premises of a valid argument but not its conclusion and\nRichter (1990) claims that one can believe general claims without\nbelieving particular instances of it. Bommarito (2010) highlights cases\nwhere the most rational option for non-ideal agents is to self-ascribe\nanti-expertise.\n4.2 Disagreement\n\n\nAnti-expertise highlights the limits of what attitudes we can take\n to our own epistemic states and faculties.\n Disagreement\n raises similar issues in a social context by considering how one should\nrespond to disagreement with others who have similar evidence and\nfaculties as you. For conciliation views, the disagreement itself is a\ntype of higher-order evidence that warrants you to be less confident in\nyour own position (see Christensen 2010). For steadfast views, such\ndisagreement should not alter your confidence in your own view (see\nKelly 2005 and 2010).\n\n\nLike modesty, the epistemology of disagreement in part turns on\nwhether or not we have a special relationship with our own states aside\nfrom more general agent-neutral considerations (see Christensen 2007,\n335ff.). This affects how we should relate to our own beliefs and how\nto respond when such beliefs conflict with those of others. This is\nrelevant to responding to rival philosophical views; see Barnett\n(forthcoming).\n4.3 Intellectual Humility\n\n\nIntellectual humility concerns similar issues as modesty more\ngenerally, but in the epistemic domain. Roberts and Wood (2003) defend\nan account that roots intellectual humility in low concern for status\ndue to a high concern for epistemic goods. Like the indifference views\ndescribed in 3.2, on this view the intellectually humble person\ndoesn\u2019t care about the social status of intellectual activities\nor the social status of believers.\n\n\nWhitcomb et al. (2015) defend a \u201climitations-owning\u201d\nview. On this view the intellectually humble person attends to and owns\ntheir own limitations. Rushing (2013) defends a similar view of\nhumility in a Confucian context arguing that it is about learning and\nfacing one\u2019s own limitations. These accounts tend to presume that\nthere is something special about our own limitations that warrant\nspecial attitudes beyond concern for epistemic limitations more\ngenerally.\n\n\nOther views defend more doxastic accounts of intellectual humility,\nmaking it about particular higher-order epistemic states and not about\ngeneral abilities or attitudes. Hazlett (2012) sees intellectual\nhumility as having proper beliefs about the status of first-order\nbeliefs and Church (2016) sees it as accurate tracking of the\nnon-culpable positive epistemic status of one\u2019s own\nbeliefs.\u00a0\n\n\nThese views treat intellectual humility as an epistemic virtue.\nDalmiya (2016, 115ff.), however, sees it as deeply linked with moral\nvirtue. Drawing on Indian philosophy and ethics of care, she sees\nhumility as both a disposition to embrace others as partners in\ncognitive activity and an awareness of our own ignorance and\nlimitations. This makes intellectual humility strongly relational as it\ninvolves not only a single person\u2019s beliefs and awareness but a\nfocus on the epistemic agency of others. This gives intellectual\nhumility both epistemic and moral aspects.\n4.4 Open-Mindedness\n\n\nOpen-mindedness raises similar issues to modesty and humility in\nthat it involves taking a special attitude to oneself. Some deny this;\nHare (1985), for example, argues that open-mindedness is nothing more\nthan treating evidence in an impartial way. Others take it to be\nstrongly related to one\u2019s own epistemic position: Adler (2004)\nsees it as a way of responding to counter-evidence to one\u2019s own\nbeliefs, Riggs (2010) sees it as a type of self-knowledge and\nself-monitoring, and Baehr (2011) sees it as involving a detachment\nfrom one\u2019s default point of view because one wants to get to the\ntruth.\n\n\nThough it is often talked about as an epistemic view (see Zagzebski\n1996), it is also discussed as a moral virtue too. Arpaly (2011) sees\nit as a disposition to change our beliefs without being opinionated out\nof moral concern. McRae (2016) also sees it as involving moral concern\nbut also a willingness to consider alternate self-narratives, linking\nit with equanimity in the Buddhist tradition. This casts\nopen-mindedness as a freedom from certain mental habits involving the\nself and its place in the world.\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nModesty and humility touch on a variety of more general issues in\nphilosophy. It relates to moral issues about self and other: Whether\nthere are special moral requirements regarding our self-orientation and\nif so, what underlies them?\n\n\nIt also touches on a variety of debates within virtue theory: What\nkinds of self-attitudes enable the exercise of virtue? What features of\nthe self are salient to a virtuous person? What features make the\nstates associated with modesty and humility virtuous in the first\nplace?\n\n\nFinally, it involves questions that arise at the intersection of\nethics and epistemology: Are there moral or rational limits on the\nkinds of goodness or badness I can attribute to myself? Can moral\nvirtue be compatible with, or even require, epistemic failings? Careful\ntheorizing about the nature of modesty and humility helps to shape and\ninform these larger questions in ethics and epistemology.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, Jonathan, 2004, \u201cReconciling Open-Mindedness and\nBelief\u201d, <em>Theory and Research in Education</em>, 2(2):\n127\u2013142.", "Aquinas, Thomas. 1981/1948. <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Fathers of\nthe English Dominican Province, trans. 5 vols.
