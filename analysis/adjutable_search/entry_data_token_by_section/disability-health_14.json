    "main_text": "Personal Relations, Family, and Disability || Personal relationships and third-party assistance\n3.5 Personal relationships and third-party assistance\n\nDisability theorists and activists reject the assumption that\ndisabilities pose unique difficulties for personal relationships on\nthe grounds that this assumption reflects an overly narrow view of the\nmutuality required in an intimate relationship. That said, not all\npersons with and without disabilities have the same views about\npossibility of combining intimacy with disability-specific personal\nassistance. To accommodate these differences, some theorists and\nactivists have argued for options that separate instrumental\nassistance from close relationships. These options involve providing\nby paid staff for personal assistance in cases where this helps to\npreserve the mutuality, sharing, and interdependence of friendships,\npartner relations, and family life (Litvak et al. 1987; Asch 1993;\nRatzka 2004). There is much to be said in favor of making third-party\nassistance available. The lack of education and training of family\nmembers in meeting a person\u2019s disability-related needs, the\nsocietal treatment of these needs as different from and more shameful\nthan other needs, and the scarcity and inaccessibility of other\nsupportive services for meeting these needs, can indeed place enormous\nstrain on intimate relationships between nondisabled and disabled\npersons. Further, the constant reliance upon intimates for assistance\nwith travel, communication, or preparation for work or school may\nthwart the desires of persons with disabilities to select what they\nwear, when they come and go, or with whom they associate in their free\ntime. The idea of an entitlement to state-subsidized personal\nassistance has been developed on a policy level by Litvak, Heumann,\nand Zukas (1987), Adolf Ratzka (2004), and Americans Disabled For\nAttendant Programs Today (ADAPT). \n\nIt might be thought that the argument for state-subsidized personal\nassistance undermines the claim that disability does not pose any\ngeneral barriers to intimacy. Those arguing that the state should\nsubsidize personal assistance for people with disabilities might seem\nto share the assumption of Callahan (1988) and Wertz and Fletcher\n(1993) that disability-related needs differ in kind as well as in\ndegree from other material and emotional needs for which\nstate-subsidized assistance is not defended.\n\nDisability advocates would reject this conclusion for at least two\nreasons. First, it is the stigmatization of disability-related needs,\nmore than the actual cost of meeting them, which serves as a barrier\nto intimacy. The stigmatization of disability-related needs creates an\naversion to meeting those needs and a tendency to exaggerate the costs\nof doing so. There is an inclination to see meeting those needs as\nfalling outside the scope of an intimate relationship, when meeting\nrelevantly similar needs of a nondisabled relative are seen as part\nand parcel of intimate relating. By subsidizing personal assistance,\nthe state helps to overcome the exclusionary effects of deeply\nentrenched social attitudes that pose a barrier to intimacy. If these\nattitudes change so that the dominant culture does not find it\nshameful to have disability-specific needs and distasteful to meet\nthem, there might well be less need for personal assistance programs.\nThe remaining need for personal assistance would not sharply\ndistinguish persons with disabilities from friends and intimates who\nalso call upon each other for various forms of assistance.\n\nSecond, the fact that some people with disabilities require more\nassistance than most nondisabled people to achieve their life goals\ndoes not mean that disabilities must pose a barrier to intimacy.\nIntimate relationships often impose special demands on participants\nunrelated to disability. An individual with expensive projects or\ncommitments may cost significantly more to befriend or marry, but\nunless those projects and commitments are extravagant or\nall-consuming, we would not see them as a general barrier to intimacy.\nLikewise, even in an Internet age, it may be more costly to maintain\nfriendships with people who live in remote areas. Yet we tend to see\nthose costs as incidental to the relationships we form, even if they\nlimit them in ways we may regret (Amundson 2005).\n\nA state-subsidized personal assistance response to disability-related\nneeds is not welcomed by all disability theorists and activists.\nWendell (1989, 1996) sees people with disabilities, in their\ndependence, as having lessons to teach nondisabled people about human\ninterdependence. Similarly, Eva Kittay has argued for the importance\nof kinship caregiving. Kittay stresses the importance of a loving and\n\u201csustaining\u201d relationship between the caregiver and the\ncare-recipient, which may be absent when care is professionally\noutsourced. Moreover, family caregivers are more likely to maintain\ntrusting and long-lasting relationships, as opposed to professional\ncaregivers, who may come and go. Furthermore, Kittay stresses the\nsignificance of including disabled people in familial and cultural\nactivities rather than relegating them to paid caregivers, although it\nis not clear why having a paid assistant is inimical to participating\nin familial and communal activities (Kittay 2003). (See also Longmore\n1995 and Levine 2004.).\n\nThese arguments about the value of kinship caregiving do not undermine\nthe case for making professional caregiving relationships a dignified\nand economically viable option. There are many families ill-equipped\nor poorly disposed to adopt that option. But there are also many\ncircumstances in which the differentiation of personal assistant from\nparent, spouse, or friend will give the person with a disability the\nfreedom and privacy that nondisabled people take for granted. In\ncircumstances where kinship assistance would strain rather than\nenhance intimate relationships between family members, it seems clear\nthat third-party assistance should at least be made available as an\noption, even if it is not encouraged across-the-board. \n\nSubsidizing third-party assistance is a means by which the state can\nhelp to create the conditions for the flourishing of positive\nrelationships. The provision of paid third-party assistance is not\nintended to force the separation of instrumental help from close\nrelationships, but to give friends and family members the freedom to\ndecide how much of such assistance they want to incorporate into their\nrelationships. Friends and family members may be entirely comfortable\nmeeting someone\u2019s disability-specific needs, just as they are\nprepared to meet other needs of the people with whom they have\nintimate relationships (Asch 1993). In other cases, and with respect\nto other needs, they may not. Close relationships are not all of a\npiece, and persons with disabilities, their friends, family members,\nand lovers should be able to determine for themselves what kind of\nrelationship they will have and what role there is in it for\nthird-party assistance.\n",
