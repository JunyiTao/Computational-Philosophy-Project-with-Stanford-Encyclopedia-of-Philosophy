To evaluatively rank (hereafter, simply\n\u201crank\u201d) a set of outcomes is to rank them along some\nevaluative dimension, such as their overall goodness, their goodness\nfor the agent, their goodness for others besides the agent, or some\ncombination of such things. And when we combine act-consequentialism\nwith different ways of ranking outcomes, we get different versions of\nact-consequentialism. For instance, Benthamite utilitarianism (Bentham\n1789) combines act-consequentialism with the view that outcomes are to\nbe ranked in terms of their overall goodness and that the overall\ngoodness of an outcome is simply a function of the intensities and\ndurations of the pleasures and pains that it contains. On this theory,\nagents must always maximize hedonic utility\u2014the net\nbalance of pleasure over pain for all concerned. By contrast, ethical\negoism (Shaver 2002 [2021]) is an act-consequentialist theory that\nranks outcomes in terms of how good they are for the agent.\nIt holds that one outcome outranks another if and only if it is better\nfor the agent. And, so, ethical egoism implies that an agent ought to\nproduce the outcome that\u2019s best for themself even if it\u2019s\nworse overall. In contrast to these two, self/other utilitarianism\n(Sider 1993: 128) holds that one outcome outranks another if and only\nif it outranks the other both in terms of how good it is and in terms\nof how good it is for others besides the agent. On this view, an agent\nmay perform an act whose outcome is worse than that of some available\nalternative so long as that outcome is worse only for themself. And\nthese three are but a few of the possibilities.\n\nAlthough there are many ways to rank outcomes and, consequently, many\nversions of act-consequentialism, Benthamite utilitarianism\n(hereafter, simply \u201cutilitarianism\u201d) is its archetypal and\nprototypical form. The problem is that few are willing to accept it\ngiven its counterintuitive implications, including the following:\n\nwe ought to lobotomize people if this would maximize hedonic\nutility by enabling them to enjoy simple bodily pleasures free of\nintellectual discontent,\nwe are required to sacrifice our own lives to save the lives of\nothers even if this would produce only slightly more hedonic utility\noverall, and\nwe are permitted to maim, torture, and even kill innocent people\nso long as doing so would produce more (perhaps, only slightly more)\nhedonic utility.\n\n\nYet, despite such counterintuitive implications, utilitarianism tends\nto haunt even those of us who refuse to accept it, for there seems to\nbe something quite compelling about its act-consequentialism (Berker\n2013: 364; Foot 1985: 196; Korsgaard 1993 [1996: 225]). Of course,\nwhat exactly, if anything, is so compelling about it is controversial\nand, thus, something that we\u2019ll need to consider below.\n\nGiven this putative tension between the attractiveness of\nact-consequentialism and the unattractiveness of its archetype\u2019s\nimplications, a potentially promising research project is to come up\nwith a version of act-consequentialism that avoids\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications. Given that many\nstandard versions of non-consequentialism (including standard versions\nof Kantianism, virtue ethics, and theological voluntarism) avoid many,\nif not all, of utilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications,\nwe could do this by constructing a ranking of outcomes that, when\ncombined with act-consequentialism, yields the same (or nearly the\nsame) deontic verdicts that one of these non-consequentialist theories\ndelivers. This is to consequentialize that\nnon-consequentialist theory. (Note that deontic verdicts are verdicts\nsuch as \u201cright\u201d, \u201cobligatory\u201d,\n\u201cpermissible\u201d, \u201csupererogatory\u201d, \u201cought\nto be performed\u201d, etc. Unlike evaluative verdicts such as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d, which are directly\nnormative only for what we should desire/prefer, deontic verdicts are\nalso directly normative prospectively for what we should do/intend and\nretrospectively for whom we should blame/praise.)\n\nTo illustrate, consider theological voluntarism\u2014the view that\nthe ultimate right-making feature of an action is that it accords with\nGod\u2019s will. And let\u2019s consider the version that holds that\nGod wills that we abide by the Ten Commandments. To consequentialize\nthis non-consequentialist theory, we need to replace its account of\nthe ultimate right-maker with one that holds instead that the ultimate\nright-making feature of an act is that its outcome is not outranked by\nthat of any available alternative and that one outcome outranks\nanother if and only if the agent refrains from violating the Ten\nCommandments in the one but not the other. This act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory yields the same set of deontic verdicts that this\nversion of theological voluntarism delivers\u2014e.g., that\nit\u2019s obligatory to honor your parents and wrong to both lie and\ncommit murder. But this counterpart theory is a version of\nact-consequentialism as opposed to theological voluntarism because it\nholds that the feature of lying that ultimately makes it wrong is, not\nthat God wills us to refrain from lying, but that the outcome in which\nthe agent lies is outranked by the outcome in which they neither lie\nnor violate any other commandment.\n\nThus, to consequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we combine\nact-consequentialism with a ranking of outcomes such that the\nresulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory yields, in every\npossible world, the same (or nearly the same) deontic verdicts that\nthe target non-consequentialist theory yields. Historically, this has\nmost often been done in the hopes of coming up with a version of\nact-consequentialism that avoids most, if not all, of\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications. And this project\nis often called \u201cthe consequentializing project\u201d\n(Portmore 2007; S. A. Schroeder 2017; Suikkanen 2020). But, as\nwe\u2019ll see below, some contemporary philosophers consequentialize\nfor other reasons. Indeed, there are three different types of\nconsequentializing and, consequently, three distinct\nconsequentializing projects. And, so, when we consider various\nobjections to consequentializing below, we\u2019ll need to be careful\nnot to conflate them, as many of these objections apply only to\ncertain types of consequentializing.\n", "toc": [{"#HowConsDiffOtheAtteRecoUtilCommMoraOpin": "1.

How Consequentializing Differs from Other Attempts to Reconcile Utilitarianism with Common Moral Opinion\n\nThere are at least two ways of trying to modify utilitarianism in the\nhopes of reconciling some portion of it with common moral opinion. One\nway is to keep its act-consequentialism but trade in its simplistic\nranking of outcomes for a more sophisticated one. Consider, then, that\nutilitarianism (which, recall, is short for \u201cBenthamite\nutilitarianism\u201d) ranks outcomes according to quantitative\nhedonism: the view that the only things that ultimately matter in\nranking outcomes are the intensities and durations of the pleasures\nand pains that they contain. Yet, it seems that many more things\nmatter, including whether those outcomes are ones in which we violate\npeople\u2019s rights or affect the quality\u2014and not just the\nquantity\u2014of their pleasures and pains. And this has led to\ntheories such as rights consequentialism (Sen 1982) and\nqualitative utilitarianism (Mill 1861), respectively. The\nother is to keep utilitarianism\u2019s quantitative hedonism but\ntrade in its act-consequentialism. For instance, whereas Bentham held\nthat we should evaluate acts in terms of their own utilities, we could\ninstead evaluate actions in terms of whether they accord with the code\nof rules that, if accepted by the vast majority of everyone\neverywhere, would produce more hedonic utility than the vast majority\nof everyone everywhere accepting some alternative code. And this has\nled to theories such as rule-utilitarianism. (Perhaps, there\u2019s\neven a third way: holding that the outcomes that are to be ranked are\nto be individuated not only metaphysically but also presentationally,\nsuch that they themselves can be agent-relative\u2014see N. R. Howard\n2022.)\n\nOf course, these different ways of trying to reconcile some portion of\nutilitarianism with common moral opinion are not mutually exclusive.\nBrad Hooker\u2019s (2000) rule-consequentialism not only trades in\nutilitarianism\u2019s act-consequentialism for rule-consequentialism\nbut also trades in its simplistic ranking of outcomes for one that\nadmits that other things besides pleasures and pains matter in the\nranking of outcomes. The result is a moral theory that is very close\nto commonsense morality in its deontic verdicts.\n\nBut although there may be more than one way of reconciling some\nportion of utilitarianism with common moral opinion,\nconsequentializing involves doing so by revising its method of ranking\noutcomes while keeping its act-consequentialism intact. This is\nbecause many (including non-consequentialists) believe that when we\nmove away from utilitarianism\u2019s act-consequentialism, we give up\nthe very thing that we found most compelling about it in the first\nplace. For, as Philippa Foot has argued, utilitarianism\u2019s\n\n\n[act-]consequentialist element is one of the main reasons why\nutilitarianism seems so compelling\n\n\nas well as the main reason why\n\n\nthe move to rule utilitarianism seems to be an unsatisfactory answer\nto the problem of reconciling utilitarianism with common moral\nopinion. (1985: 196 & 198)\n\n2. Consequentializing Commonsense Deontic Verdicts\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, one of the main motivations for\nconsequentializing certain commonsense deontic verdicts is to\nreconcile utilitarianism\u2019s putatively compelling\nact-consequentialism with common moral opinion. This section considers\nthe various kinds of deontic verdicts that consequentializers have\nsought to accommodate and the sorts of moves they have historically\nmade to do so.\n\nInterestingly, consequentializing seems to go nearly as far back as\nact-consequentialism itself (see Hurley 2020: 27). Indeed, it goes at\nleast as far back as John Stuart Mill\u2019s development of\nqualitative hedonism in response to the objection that (Benthamite)\nutilitarianism is, given its commitment to quantitative hedonism,\n\u201ca doctrine worthy only of swine\u201d. Mill argued that there\nare certain kinds of pleasures (e.g., intellectual pleasures) that\nhuman beings, but not swine, are capable of and that these\n\u201chigher\u201d pleasures are qualitatively different than the\n\u201clower\u201d, bodily pleasures of which both swine and human\nbeings are capable\u2014so much so that no quantity of these lower\npleasures could ever be as good as a sufficient quantity of higher\npleasures (1861 [1991: 14\u201317]).\n\nG. E. Moore (1903) went even further, arguing\n\nthat pleasure isn\u2019t the only intrinsic good,\nthat not all goods are good for someone, and\nthat the goodness of a whole needn\u2019t equal the sum of the\ngoodness of its parts taken individually.\n\n\nAnd this wholesale rejection of hedonism was, as W. D. Ross pointed\nout, a significant development, allowing the act-consequentialist to\naccount for the fact\n\n\nthat pleasure is not the only thing in life that we think good in\nitself, that for instance we think the possession of a good character,\nor an intelligent understanding of the world, as good or better. (1930\n[2002: 17])\n\n\nThis move to reject hedonism can take the consequentializer even\nfurther when it\u2019s combined with the rejection of\nutilitarians\u2019 narrow conception of an act\u2019s outcome.\nUtilitarians tend to think of an act\u2019s outcome as consisting\nsolely in what\u2019s causally downstream from the act. For they hold\nthat hedonic utility is all that matters and that things that are not\ncausally downstream from the act\u2014things such as whether the act\nis an instance of keeping a promise, whether the agent\u2019s motive\nin performing it was virtuous, and whether there\u2019s a victim of\nsome past injustice who would be compensated by it\u2014don\u2019t\nthemselves affect how much hedonic utility it produces. But\nthere\u2019s no reason why the act-consequentialist can\u2019t be\nconcerned with more than just the causal consequences of an act. And,\nso, it\u2019s now standard to construe the outcome of an act broadly\nto include everything that would be the case if it were performed. (Of\ncourse, if it\u2019s indeterminate what would be the case if it were\nperformed, we would need to switch from talking about the act\u2019s\noutcome to talking about its prospect, which is a\nprobability distribution consisting of all its possible outcomes and\ntheir associated probabilities. But I\u2019ll ignore this\ncomplication in what remains.)\n\nOnce the act-consequentialist both rejects hedonism and construes an\nact\u2019s outcome broadly, they can hold that certain types of\nactions are intrinsically bad\u2014that, for instance,\n\u201cbreaking a promise is intrinsically bad\u201d (Ewing 1948:\n187). The consequentializer can, then, insist that whatever features\nof actions that the target non-consequentialist theory takes to be\nintrinsically wrong-making are instead features of outcomes that make\nthem rank poorly\u2014the idea being that what\u2019s most salient\nis not whether an act has the property of being a promise-breaking but\nwhether its outcome has the property of being one in which this\npromise-breaking occurs. The consequentializer can thereby accommodate\nour intuition that breaking a promise is wrong even if breaking it\nwould produce just as much hedonic utility as keeping it. It\u2019s\nwrong because outcomes in which promises are broken are, other things\nbeing equal, worse than those in which they are kept.\n\nBut although these moves are significant, they are insufficient to\nallow the consequentializer to accommodate other commonsense\nintuitions. For commonsense holds that breaking a promise is wrong\neven if breaking it would produce just as much good as keeping it\n(Ross 1930 [2002: 18]), and the overall goodness of breaking a promise\nmust take into account whatever intrinsic badness there is in the act\nitself. For instance, commonsense holds that it would be wrong, other\nthings being equal, for Abe to break his promise even to prevent Bert\nand Carl from breaking their promises. Yet, clearly, it must, other\nthings being equal, be better for Abe to break his promise than for\nBert and Carl to break theirs. For even if promise-breakings are\nintrinsically bad, two promise-breakings would have to be worse than\njust one, other things being equal.\n\nTo accommodate such commonsense intuitions, consequentializers have\ntypically appealed to an evaluator-relative ranking of outcomes, one\nwhere the agent\u2019s ranking differs from that of, say, some\nbystander (see, e.g., Sen 1983\u2014but see Dougherty 2013 and Setiya\n2018 for an approach that doesn\u2019t appeal to evaluator\nrelativism). Whereas the bystander has no good reason to prefer\nAbe\u2019s breaking his promise to two others\u2019 breaking theirs,\nAbe has a good reason to prefer two others\u2019 breaking their\npromises to his breaking his promise in that Abe has a special\nresponsibility for his own promises, a responsibility that he\ndoesn\u2019t have for ensuring that the others keep theirs. Thus,\ngiven an agent\u2019s special responsibility for their own agency,\nAbe should rank the outcome in which he keeps his promise and two\nothers break theirs above the outcome in which he breaks his promise\nand two others keep theirs. And, so, the act-consequentialist can\naccommodate the intuition that breaking a promise is wrong even if\nbreaking it would produce just as much good as (or even more good\nthan) keeping it.\n\nNow, commonsense morality differs from utilitarianism not only in\ntaking there to be restrictions on performing certain types of\naction\u2014such as promise-breakings\u2014even for the sake of\nbringing about the overall best outcome (i.e., agent-centered\nrestrictions), but also in taking there to be options either to\nbring about the overall best outcome or to refrain from doing so\n(i.e., agent-centered options). To accommodate the latter,\nconsequentializers have typically appealed to a dual ranking of\noutcomes (see Sider 1993 and Portmore 2011). To illustrate, recall\nself/other utilitarianism and imagine that you must choose between (a)\ngiving your last aspirin to some stranger, alleviating their\nmild headache, or (b) taking it yourself, alleviating your\nsevere headache. Assuming that everything else is equal,\nutilitarianism requires you to take the aspirin yourself, as this will\nbring about the overall best outcome: the one with less overall pain.\nBut, intuitively, you are also permitted to give it to the stranger.\nSelf/other utilitarianism accommodates this intuition by holding that\nthe permissibility of actions depends on two different rankings of\ntheir outcomes: one that ranks them in terms of how good they are\noverall and another that ranks them in terms of how good they are for\neveryone but the agent. More specifically, self/other utilitarianism\nholds that an act is permissible if and only if there is no available\nalternative whose outcome outranks its outcome on both of these two\nrankings. And since taking the aspirin yourself outranks giving it to\nthe stranger in terms of what\u2019s best overall but giving it to\nthe stranger outranks taking it yourself in terms of what\u2019s best\nfor others, both are permissible.\n\nUnfortunately, however, self/other utilitarianism accommodates only\none of two types of agent-centered options: namely,\nagent-sacrificing options. Agent-sacrificing options are\noptions to either maximize the overall good or sacrifice your own\ngreater interests (and the overall good) for the sake of doing more to\npromote the lesser interests of others. But just as important are\nagent-favoring options. Agent-favoring options are options to\neither maximize the overall good or favor promoting your own interests\nover promoting the overall good. To illustrate, suppose that you\nlegally and justifiably possess two tablets of an opioid drug. Now,\ngiven your built-up tolerance to this drug, you would need to take\nboth tablets to alleviate your moderate pain. But there are two\nstrangers who are also in moderate pain, and they would each need only\none tablet to alleviate their pain, for they have no built-up\ntolerance to this drug. Thus, you can either take both tablets\nyourself or give the two strangers one tablet each. And the latter\nwould be better overall, as it would alleviate twice as much pain.\nNevertheless, it seems that you are permitted to do either, which is\nan intuitive verdict that self/other utilitarianism cannot\naccommodate.\n\nBut, as consequentializers have shown, other act-consequentialist\ntheories can. One is Schefflerian utilitarianism (see\nPortmore 2011: 93\u20137). It holds that an act is permissible if and\nonly if there is no available alternative whose outcome outranks its\noutcome both in terms of utility for others (other than the agent,\nthat is) and in terms of egoistically-adjusted utility, where\negoistically-adjusted utility includes everyone\u2019s utility but\nadjusts the overall total by giving the agent\u2019s utility ten\ntimes the weight of each other\u2019s. Schefflerian utilitarianism\nimplies that you are permitted to either take the two tablets yourself\n(as this would produce the most egoistically-adjusted utility) or give\nthe two strangers one tablet each (as this would produce the most\nutility for others). What\u2019s more, Schefflerian utilitarianism\nallows that in the previous case you can either take the aspirin to\nalleviate your own severe headache (as this would produce the most\negoistically-adjusted utility) or give it to the stranger to alleviate\ntheir mild headache (as this would produce the most utility for\nothers). Thus, Schefflerian utilitarianism is an act-consequentialist\ntheory that accommodates both agent-favoring options and\nagent-sacrificing options. Still, it is a rather simplistic theory,\nand one that seems both arbitrary in setting the egoistic multiplier\nat ten and ad hoc in its appeal to a dual ranking of outcomes\nsolely as a means to avoiding counterintuitive implications. But\nconsequentializers have tried to come up with ever more sophisticated\nconsequentialist theories that seek to address these issues\u2014see,\ne.g., Portmore 2011: chaps. 5\u20136.\n\nThere are, of course, other commonsense deontic verdicts that\nconsequentializers may wish to accommodate as well as other moves they\nmay need to take to do so. But the above should serve as a brief\nhistory of some of the significant moves that consequentializers have\nmade.\n3. Three Motives for, and Types of, Consequentializing\n\nWe can consequentialize, but why should we? As we\u2019ll see, there\nare three different answers, resulting in three distinct types of\nconsequentializing.\n3.1 Earnest Consequentializing\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen what is perhaps the original, and most\ncommon, motivation for consequentializing: to avoid\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive deontic verdicts while\nretaining what\u2019s most intuitively compelling about it\u2014its\nact-consequentialism (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1477). Following Sergio\nTenenbaum (2014), I\u2019ll call those with this motive for\nconsequentializing earnest consequentializers. Earnest\nconsequentializers (e.g., Sen 1983 and Portmore 2011) give\nwhat\u2019s known as the intuitive argument for\nconsequentializing (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1477):\n\nOn the one hand, there is something intuitively compelling about\nutilitarianism: its act-consequentialism.\nOn the other hand, standard versions of non-consequentialism avoid\nmost, if not all, of the counterintuitive deontic verdicts associated\nwith utilitarianism. Still, they do so at the cost of abandoning\nact-consequentialism.\nThus, by consequentializing standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, we can produce an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that retains what\u2019s most compelling about\nutilitarianism while avoiding most, if not all, of the\ncounterintuitive deontic verdicts associated with it.\nAnd, in doing so, nothing nearly as compelling is lost.\nTherefore, by consequentializing standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, we can produce a theory that\u2019s more\nintuitively attractive than both utilitarianism and standard versions\nof non-consequentialism.\n\n\nEarnest consequentializing is made possible because theory selection\nis underdetermined by the data that our theories seek to explain (see\nDuhem 1914 [1954]; Quine 1951 [1953]; and Baumann 2019). To\nillustrate, consider two moral theories: utilitarian theological\nvoluntarism and utilitarian act-consequentialism. These\ntwo explain the same data set: that all and only acts that maximize\nhedonic utility are permissible. However, their explanations are quite\ndifferent. Utilitarian theological voluntarism holds that the\nexplanation lies with the fact that the ultimate right-making feature\nof an act is that it accords with God\u2019s will along with the fact\n(as they see it) that God is perfectly good and, so, wills each of us\nto maximize hedonic utility (see Paley 1802). Utilitarian\nact-consequentialism, by contrast, holds that the explanation lies\nwith the fact that the ultimate right-making feature of an act is that\nits outcome is not outranked by that of any available alternative\nalong with the fact (as they see it) that an act\u2019s outcome is\nnot outranked by that of any available alternative if and only if it\nmaximizes hedonic utility. Thus, the moral data (i.e., the given set\nof deontic verdicts) can be explained either in non-consequentialist\nterms or in act-consequentialist terms. And, to consequentialize, we\njust need to opt for the latter.\n\nThe fact that data underdetermines theory selection also makes\nKantianizing possible. And, so, just as we can\nconsequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we can Kantianize a\nnon-Kantian theory (Hurley 2013; Sachs 2010). For instance, if we\nwanted to Kantianize utilitarianism, we need only combine Kantianism\n(which, on at least one interpretation, is the view that the ultimate\nright-making feature of an act is that it shows the proper respect for\nhumanity) with the assumption that an act shows the proper respect for\nhumanity if and only if it maximizes hedonic utility. Indeed, the\npoint generalizes: for any moral theory X that holds that the\nultimate right-making feature of an act is that it is F, we\ncan X-ize a non-X theory that holds instead that it\nis G simply by combining X\u2019s account of the\nultimate right-maker with the assumption that an act is F if\nand only if it is G. (This will be possible so long as\nF and G are such that it\u2019s possible that an\nact is F if and only if it is G.)\n\nWe can even theologically voluntarize a\nnon-theological-voluntarist theory such as Kantianism. To do so, we\nneed only combine theological voluntarism\u2019s view that the\nultimate right-making feature of an act is that it accords with\nGod\u2019s will with the assumption that an act accords with\nGod\u2019s will if and only if it shows the proper respect for\nhumanity. The result is a version of theological voluntarism (viz.,\nKantian theological voluntarism) that yields the same set of\ndeontic verdicts that Kantianism delivers.\n\nBut if we can account for the moral data on various types of theories,\nwhy opt to do so in terms of act-consequentialism rather than\nnon-consequentialism? In other words, why consequentialize rather\nthan, say, Kantianize? The earnest consequentializer answers that it\nis because there is something uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism (what\u2019s often called \u201cthe Compelling\nIdea\u201d) and nothing nearly so compelling about Kantianism or any\nother non-consequentialist theory. This claim is, of course,\ncontroversial, but we\u2019ll address this controversy both in the\nnext section and in\n section 4.1\n below.\n3.2 Notational Consequentializing\n\nSome are motivated to consequentialize out of a desire to establish\nboth that the consequentialist/non-consequentialist distinction is\nunimportant and that there is nothing uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism (see Dreier 2011 and Louise 2004). Because these\nphilosophers hold that the act-consequentialist counterpart of a\ntarget non-consequentialist theory is a mere notational variant on\nthat theory, I\u2019ll call them notational\nconsequentializers. They give what\u2019s known as the\nassimilation argument for consequentializing (S. A. Schroeder\n2017: 1480):\n\nEvery plausible non-consequentialist theory has an\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory such that the two are\nnecessarily co-extensive in their deontic verdicts (Dreier 2011:\n104\u2013111).\nIf an act-consequentialist theory and a non-consequentialist\ntheory are necessarily co-extensive in their deontic verdicts, then\nthey are equivalent in the strong sense of being mere notational\nvariants of each other, just as the view that the average kinetic\nenergy of the molecules in a pot of boiling water at one atmosphere of\npressure is 100 degrees Celsius is a mere notational variant of the\nview that the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a pot of\nboiling water at one atmosphere of pressure is 212 degrees Fahrenheit\n(Dreier 2011: 111\u2013115).\nIf every plausible non-consequentialist theory is a mere\nnotational variant of some extensionally equivalent\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory, then the\nconsequentialism/non-consequentialism distinction is unimportant (and,\nindeed, empty), for every plausible moral theory has, then, both an\nact-consequentialist notational variant and a non-consequentialist\nnotational variant (Dreier 2011: 114\u2013115).\nThus, the consequentialism/non-consequentialism distinction is\nunimportant (and, indeed, empty).\n\n\nThe first two premises are the most controversial. And, so,\nwe\u2019ll examine objections to each of them in\n section 4.2\n and\n section 4.5,\n respectively.\n\nBut, for now, let us examine why the notational consequentializer\nthinks that the first premise is true. It\u2019s because they have\nhigh hopes for what\u2019s known as the Footian Procedure\n(Portmore 2011: 112), a procedure for generating an\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory for any plausible target\nnon-consequentialist theory. To follow this procedure, we simply\ncombine act-consequentialism\u2019s view that an act is permissible\nif and only if its outcome is not outranked by that of any available\nalternative with the assumption that an act\u2019s outcome is not\noutranked by that of any available alternative if and only if it is\nF, where \u201cF\u201d stands for whatever feature\nof actions that the target non-consequentialist theory takes to be the\nultimate right-maker (e.g., \u201cshowing the proper respect for\nhumanity\u201d in the case of Kantianism). In other words, we\ngenerate a ranking of outcomes as follows: we rank the outcome of\nevery act that the target non-consequentialist theory takes to be\npermissible above the outcome of every available alternative that the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory takes to be impermissible.\nWhat\u2019s more, if the target non-consequentialist theory allows\nthat some acts are morally better than others in that we have more\nmoral reason to perform them than to perform those others, then we\nrank their outcomes above those of the others, and we do so by\nwhatever degree the target non-consequentialist theory takes them to\nbe morally better. Because, on this procedure, whether one outcome\noutranks another on the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheory just depends on whether the act that would produce the one is,\non the target non-consequentialist theory, morally better than the act\nthat would produce the other, it guarantees that the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory delivers, in every possible\nworld, the same deontic verdicts that the target non-consequentialist\ntheory yields.\n\nBut this procedure doesn\u2019t guarantee that the first premise in\nthe assimilation argument is true. For it may not always be possible\nto employ the Footian Procedure. It won\u2019t be possible if the\nstructural features of the target non-consequentialist theory\u2019s\nmorally-better relation are incompatible with those of\nact-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of outcomes (see Brown 2011). To\nillustrate, suppose that act-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of\noutcomes must be transitive, whereas the target non-consequentialist\ntheory\u2019s morally-better relation is intransitive. For suppose\nthat the target non-consequentialist theory holds:\n\nthat act A is morally better than act B,\nthat act B is morally better than act C,\nbut\nthat act C is morally better than act A.\n\n\nIn that case, there will be no way to employ the Footian Procedure to\nconsequentialize this non-consequentialist theory if\nact-consequentialism\u2019s ranking of outcomes must be\ntransitive.\n\nIn any case, notational consequentializing aims to use the Footian\nProcedure, if possible, to demonstrate that every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory has an extensionally equivalent\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory with the goal of establishing\nthat, in every instance, the target non-consequentialist theory and\nthe resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory are mere\nnotational variants of each other. In doing this, the notational\nconsequentializer hopes to establish that the\nconsequentialist/non-consequentialist distinction is unimportant (and,\nindeed, empty). And this would mean that there is nothing uniquely\ncompelling about act-consequentialism and, so, no reason (or, at\nleast, no non-pragmatic reason) for us to consequentialize rather\nthan, say, Kantianize (cf. Dreier 2011: 115).\n3.3 Pragmatic Consequentializing\n\nMost recently, some have consequentialized for purely pragmatic\nreasons (see Colyvan, Cox, & Steele 2010 and Lazar 2017). For\ninstance, Seth Lazar tells us:\n\n\nMy interest in consequentializing is purely instrumental. It allows me\nto represent my moral theory in a way that makes it amenable to\ndecision theory. \u2026Consequentializing [my] deontological moral\ntheory allows [me] to apply it to situations with imperfect\ninformation. It makes deontological decision theory possible. (2017:\n586\u201387)\n\n\nI\u2019ll call those with this or some other pragmatic motive for\nconsequentializing pragmatic consequentializers. They give\nwhat\u2019s known as the pragmatic argument for\nconsequentializing (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1488). And if we take\nthe relevant pragmatic motive to be the one that Lazar cites, the\ncorresponding version of this argument would be as follows:\n\nWhereas consequentialist theories are amenable to decision theory,\nnon-consequentialist theories are not, which gives consequentialist\ntheories a distinct advantage over non-consequentialist theories when\ndealing with imperfect information.\nBut, by consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nfaithfully represent its extension even if we do thereby misrepresent\n(or, at least, make opaque) its explanation for that extension\n(Colyvan et al. 2010: 523).\nThus, if we consequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nthen apply decision theory to the resultant act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory and thereby determine the target\nnon-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic verdicts in situations\ninvolving imperfect information.\n\n\nThus, pragmatic consequentializing aims to consequentialize some\nplausible non-consequentialist theory using the Footian Procedure to\ncome up with an act-consequentialist counterpart that can then be\nemployed for some practical purpose. For instance, Lazar (2017)\nconsequentializes the deontic verdicts that his non-consequentialist\ntheory yields in situations involving perfect information so that he\ncan then use the tools of decision theory on the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart to determine what deontic verdicts\nhis non-consequentialist theory yields in situations involving\nimperfect information.\n\nSo, for the pragmatic consequentializer, the reason for\nconsequentializing rather than, say, Kantianizing is that\nthere\u2019s supposedly something unique about act-consequentialism\nthat makes it amenable to decision theory, which is pragmatically\nuseful.\n4. Objections to Consequentializing\n\nConsequentializing has its fair share of detractors. Some deny that\nit\u2019s possible to consequentialize every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory. Others see it as possible but consider it\na mere gimmick. Others, still, take it to be possible and more than a\nmere gimmick but find the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheories to be explanatorily inadequate. Unfortunately, though, those\nleveling such objections haven\u2019t always been careful to note\nthat there are different types of consequentializing and that many of\nthese objections apply only to certain types. Below, I\u2019ll\nconsider these and other objections to consequentializing as well as\nwhich types of consequentializing are subject to them.\n4.1 There Is Nothing Uniquely Compelling about Act-Consequentialism\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, even those who refuse to accept utilitarianism\nfind that there is, nonetheless, something quite compelling about it:\nits act-consequentialism. But what\u2019s so compelling about\nact-consequentialism? Let\u2019s call whatever it is \u201cthe\nCompelling Idea\u201d. For earnest consequentializing to succeed,\nthis so-called Compelling Idea must be both genuinely compelling and\nsomething that all and only act-consequentialist theories share. Both\nclaims have been denied. So, let\u2019s look at various proposals for\nthe Compelling Idea and see if any of them are both genuinely\ncompelling and unique to act-consequentialism.\n\nOne proposal is as follows.\n\nBest Option: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform your morally best option\u2014that is, the best option in\nterms of whatever morally matters (Hurley 2017).\n\nAlthough this seems to be a genuinely compelling idea (but see\nPortmore 2019 for some doubts), it is not at all unique to\nact-consequentialism. For, arguably, most, if not all, moral theories\nendorse it (Hurley 2017: 40). So, the earnest consequentializer must\nlook elsewhere. Perhaps, then, the Compelling Idea concerns the best\noutcome as opposed to the best option.\n\nBest Outcome: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform the option that would bring about the best outcome (Scheffler\n1982 [1994]; Ewing 1948: 188).\n\nUnlike\n Best Option,\n this idea is undoubtedly unique to act-consequentialism, but some\nargue that it isn\u2019t compelling\u2014or, at least, not\nuncontroversially so (see Hurley 2017). After all, many find it\nintuitive to think that certain types of acts (e.g., breaking a\npromise) are wrong even if they bring about the best outcome. For\ninstance, deontologists believe that there are agent-centered\nrestrictions that prohibit you from performing certain act-types even\nin some situations in which your performing an instance of one of\nthese act-types would prevent two or more others from each performing\na morally comparable instance of this act-type (see Scheffler 1985:\n409). So, as we saw above, even if there\u2019s something\nintrinsically bad about acts of this type, the outcome in which you\nperform an instance of this act-type would, other things being equal,\nhave to be better than the outcome in which two or more others each\nperform a morally comparable instance of this act-type. So, if the\nCompelling Idea is to be genuinely compelling even to those who\nendorse agent-centered restrictions, it better not appeal to\nthe best outcome. For the best outcome is the\noutcome with the most good, the good being what\u2019s desirable from\na universal point of view rather than what\u2019s desirable from the\nagent\u2019s point of view. And this has led some earnest\nconsequentializers to appeal instead to the following.\n\nBest-Relative-to: It is always morally permissible for you to\nperform the option that would bring about the outcome that\u2019s\nbest-relative-to you (Sen 1983; Smith 2003).\n\nThe problem with this proposal is that the better-relative-to relation\nseems to be a purely theoretical notion. In which case, it would be\nimpossible for us to have any pre-theoretical grasp on claims\ninvolving it, such as\n Best-Relative-to\n (M. Schroeder 2007). And if that\u2019s right, then\nBest-Relative-to cannot be something that we find\ncompelling\u2014at least, not pre-theoretically. Of course, some\nbelieve that we can avoid this worry by defending, via a certain\nconception of the good, the idea that what\u2019s best-relative-to\nsomeone is just what that someone has most reason to desire (see,\ne.g., Smith 2003). Others, though, have sought to avoid the\ncontroversy by instead appealing to the following.\n\nMost Reason to Desire: It is always morally permissible for\nyou to perform the option that would bring about the outcome that you\nhave most reason to desire\u2014or, in other words, the outcome that\nyou ought, or that it is fitting for you, to prefer to every available\nalternative (Portmore 2007).\n\nOne advantage of this proposal is that it explains why utilitarianism\nand ethical egoism\n\n\nhave something deep in common that is the source of their common\nappeal, as demonstrated by Sidgwick [1907]. (M. Schroeder 2007:\n290)\n\n\nFor the two theories share a commitment to\n Most Reason to Desire\n in that they are both act-consequentialist theories, broadly\nconstrued. That is, they both hold that whether an agent ought to\nperform an act is determined solely by whether that agent ought to\nprefer its outcome to those of the available alternatives. It\u2019s\njust that whereas the ethical egoist holds that agents ought always to\nprefer that they themselves have more hedonic utility, the utilitarian\nholds that agents ought always to prefer that there is more hedonic\nutility overall.\n\nMost Reason to Desire\n also seems to be what Philippa Foot (1985) had in mind. Foot\nsaid,\n\n\nWhat is it\u2026that is so compelling about [act-]consequentialism?\nIt is, I think, the rather simple thought that it can never be right\nto prefer a worse state of affairs to a better. It is this thought\nthat haunts us. (1985: 198)\n\n\nBut, of course, act-consequentialism is not a theory about what it is\nright to prefer, but rather a theory about what it is right\nto do. Nevertheless, we can charitably interpret Foot as\nassuming that the Compelling Idea is\n Most Reason to Desire.\n This idea in conjunction with her claim that it can never be right to\nprefer a worse state of affairs to a better one entails the thought\nthat it is always morally permissible to bring about the best outcome,\nand this is the thought that she sought to debunk by arguing that we\nhave no grasp of the notion of the best outcome except as the outcome\nmost favored by benevolence from among those actions permitted by\njustice. The problem, though, is that Foot is wrong about its never\nbeing right to prefer a worse state of affairs to a better one. For,\nas Jamie Dreier has pointed out,\n\n\nit is perfectly intelligible and pretty plausible that it is fitting\nfor me to prefer, say, the safety of my children to the safety of\nyours, and for you conversely to prefer your children\u2019s safety\nto mine. (2011: 101)\n\n\nSo, even if we should accept Foot\u2019s assumption that\n Most Reason to Desire\n is the Compelling Idea, we should reject her assumption that it can\nnever be right to prefer a worse outcome to a better outcome. After\nall, the outcome in which my less gifted child is saved is, other\nthings being equal, worse than the one in which your more gifted child\nis saved (that is, it should, other things being equal, be\ndispreferred from a universal point of view), but I should,\nnevertheless, prefer it from my own point of view.\n\nAlthough\n Most Reason to Desire\n is quite compelling, it is not unique to act-consequentialism. For it\nturns out that consequentializing is a double-edged sword in that it\ncan just as easily be employed to render non-consequentialism\ncompatible with Most Reason to Desire as it can be used to\nrender act-consequentialism compatible with commonsense deontic\nverdicts (Sachs 2010). For in showing that there is a ranking of\noutcomes that renders act-consequentialism compatible with some\nnon-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic verdicts, the\nconsequentializer also shows that there is a ranking of outcomes (the\nvery same one) that renders this non-consequentialist theory\ncompatible with Most Reason to Desire. As Benjamin Sachs\npoints out,\n\n\nall the non-consequentialist has to do in order to make her theory\ncompatible with the Compelling Idea is accept the fruits of the\nconsequentialist\u2019s labor. (2010: 261)\n\n\nBut although this works so long as we hold that the Compelling Idea is\nsomething like\n Most Reason to Desire,\n it doesn\u2019t work if we think that the Compelling Idea includes a\nclaim about what, on act-consequentialism, grounds the\ndeontic statuses of actions. Consider that Sachs\u2019s objection\nrests on the assumption that the best version of non-consequentialism\nis compatible with the Compelling Idea if the best version of\nact-consequentialism is compatible with the Compelling Idea. And, as\neven he admits, this assumption holds only if the Compelling Idea\ndoesn\u2019t include a claim about what, on act-consequentialism,\ngrounds the deontic statuses of actions (Sachs 2010: 266\u20139). So,\nif the earnest consequentializer wants to avoid Sachs\u2019s\nobjection, they need only to adopt something like the following\nproposal.\n\nReasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses: An\nact\u2019s deontic status is grounded in the agent\u2019s reasons\nfor preferring its outcome to those of the available alternatives.\nConsequently, it is always morally permissible for an agent to perform\nthe option that would bring about the outcome that they ought (or that\nit is fitting for them) to prefer to every available alternative\n(Portmore 2011: 5).\n\nLike\n Most Reason to Desire,\n this proposal has the advantage of accounting for the thought that\nthe Compelling Idea is something that both utilitarianism and ethical\negoism hold in common. What\u2019s more, it seems quite attractive to\nmany\u2014or, at least, to those who accept a teleological conception\nof action. On this conception, actions are attempts to affect how the\nworld goes. And, thus, whenever one acts intentionally, one acts with\nthe aim of making the world go a certain way. The aim needn\u2019t be\nanything having to do with the causal consequences of the act. The aim\ncould be nothing more than to perform the act in question. One could,\nfor instance, run merely with the aim of running. But the fact remains\nthat, for every intentional action, there is some end at which the\nagent aims. Thus, it\u2019s natural to suppose that the reasons for\nperforming an action derive from the reasons for desiring the ends\nthat it would achieve. And, so, one has most reason to act in whatever\nway will make the world go as one ought to prefer that it goes (see\nMill 1861 [1991]: Ch. 1; Portmore 2019: 262\u20133; Thomson 2003: 8;\nWood 2017: 266). After all, wouldn\u2019t it be odd to think that one\nisn\u2019t permitted to do what would best achieve the aims that one\nought to want to achieve? In any case, given\n Most Reason to Desire\u2019s\n inclusion of the claim that an act\u2019s deontic status is grounded\nin the agent\u2019s reasons for preferring its outcome to those of\nthe available alternatives (which earnest consequentializers take to\nbe definitive of act-consequentialism), it is at least unique to\nact-consequentialism.\n\nSo, if\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses\n is indeed compelling, then there is something uniquely compelling\nabout act-consequentialism. And, in that case, the earnest\nconsequentializer is off and running. But, some\u2014such as Paul\nHurley (2018)\u2014deny that it is compelling. But even if he is\ncorrect, this poses no problem for either notational\nconsequentializers or pragmatic consequentializers, for neither\ninsists on there being something uniquely compelling about\nact-consequentialism. So, this would be a worry for only earnest\nconsequentializers.\n4.2 Some Key Features of Commonsense Morality Cannot Be Consequentialized\n\nSome argue that it\u2019s not possible to consequentialize every\nplausible non-consequentialist theory (see, e.g., Brown 2011). As\nwe\u2019ll see below, their being correct would be a problem for both\nnotional consequentializers and pragmatic consequentializers, but not\nnecessarily for earnest consequentializers.\n\nBoth the notational consequentializer and the pragmatic\nconsequentializer are committed to what\u2019s known as the\nExtensional Equivalence Thesis: for every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory, there is an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that yields, in every possible world, the same set\nof deontic verdicts that it yields (Dreier 2011: 98). The notational\nconsequentializer is committed to this, for it is just the first\npremise in their assimilation argument for consequentializing. And the\npragmatic consequentializer is committed to this, for the second\npremise in their pragmatic argument for consequentializing assumes\nthat, in consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nfaithfully represent its extension.\n\nNevertheless, the Extensional Equivalence Thesis is controversial. For\ninstance, Campbell Brown (2011) has argued that the consequentializer\ncannot accommodate prohibition dilemmas: situations in which every\navailable act is impermissible. Now, whenever there are certain\ndeontic verdicts that the act-consequentialist supposedly cannot\naccommodate, there are two options for proponents of the Extensional\nEquivalence Thesis. One option is to concede that the\nact-consequentialist cannot accommodate such verdicts but argue that\nany non-consequentialist theory that includes such verdicts is\nimplausible. This is what Dreier does concerning prohibition dilemmas\n(see Dreier 2011: 105\u20136). The other option is to argue that,\ndespite appearances, there\u2019s a way for the act-consequentialist\nto accommodate these deontic verdicts. Some argue, for instance, that\nthe consequentialist can accommodate prohibition dilemmas by adopting\na cyclic ranking of outcomes (Peterson 2010: 158). Thus, if the target\nnon-consequentialist theory holds that all three of an agent\u2019s\noptions\u2014say, A, B, and C\u2014are\nimpermissible, then the consequentialist can just adopt a ranking\nwhere A\u2019s outcome outranks B\u2019s outcome,\nB\u2019s outcome outranks C\u2019s outcome, and\nC\u2019s outcome outranks A\u2019s outcome. Since\neach outcome is outranked by that of some available alternative, each\navailable act is impermissible. But, of course, this assumes, as noted\nabove, that the act-consequentialist can adopt an intransitive ranking\nof outcomes, which Brown contests.\n\nWhereas pragmatic consequentializing and notational consequentializing\nwill succeed only if the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheory yields the same set of deontic verdicts that the target\nnon-consequentialist theory yields, earnest consequentializing can\nsucceed even without such perfect coextension (cf. Tenenbaum 2014:\n233). After all, the success of earnest consequentializing requires\nonly that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory is\nbetter overall than both utilitarianism and standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism; it doesn\u2019t require that it can yield all\nthe same deontic verdicts that any plausible non-consequentialist\ntheory can. Given the earnest consequentializer\u2019s goal of coming\nup with an act-consequentialist theory that is more intuitively\ncompelling than both utilitarianism and standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, they eschew the Footian Procedure. For although\nemploying the Footian Procedure ensures that the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory will be perfectly co-extensive\nwith the target non-consequentialist theory, it doesn\u2019t\nguarantee that it will be more intuitively compelling than that\nnon-consequentialist theory. For it could be that the\nact-consequentialist would have to accept some very implausible\nrankings of outcomes to ensure its perfect co-extension with the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory. And, as we\u2019ll see below,\nthis is indeed what some philosophers have argued (e.g., Emet 2010 and\nC. Howard 2021).\n\nIn any case, the earnest consequentializer adopts a different\nprocedure for consequentializing: what\u2019s known as the\nCoherentist Procedure (Portmore 2011: 113). On this procedure, we\ndon\u2019t just adopt whatever ranking of outcomes is necessary to\nensure that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory will\nbe perfectly co-extensive with the target non-consequentialist theory.\nInstead, we hold constant the idea that one act is morally better than\nanother if and only if its outcome outranks that of the other while\nrevising, in light of each other and in light of our various\nbackground beliefs, both our pre-theoretical judgments about whether\none outcome outranks another and our pre-theoretical judgments about\nwhether the act that produces the one is morally better than the act\nthat produces the other. And we do this until we reach wide reflective\nequilibrium\u2014a state in which we have arrived at an acceptable\ncoherence among our entire set of beliefs (see Daniels 2003 [2020]).\nAnd it may be that, to reach wide reflective equilibrium, we must\nreject some of the target non-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic\nverdicts rather than adopt the ranking of outcomes needed to\nconsequentialize them.\n\nAdmittedly, no one has pre-theoretical judgments about the ranking of\noutcomes in the abstract. But these are evaluative rankings,\nand arguably such evaluative rankings concern what the agent ought (or\nwhat it is fitting for the agent) to desire/prefer (see Portmore 2011:\n59\u201362 and 112\u2013114). Hence, the earnest consequentializer\nholds that the judgment that one outcome outranks another is just the\njudgment that the agent ought (or that it is fitting for the agent) to\nprefer the one to the other. And we clearly have judgments both about\nwhich outcomes an agent ought to prefer and about which outcome it\nwould be fitting for them to prefer\u2014but I\u2019ll talk only of\nwhat they ought to prefer in the remainder. Many would, for instance,\njudge both that, if my child has fallen into the sea, I ought to\nprefer that she does not drown and that, if Sergio can rescue only one\nof two groups of people drowning, I ought to prefer that Sergio\nrescues the group that includes my child even if the other group is\nsomewhat larger. And these judgments seem to be independent of our\njudgment about what Sergio ought to do, for we may judge that,\nalthough Sergio ought to save the larger group, I ought, nevertheless,\nto prefer that Sergio saves the smaller group\u2014that being the\ngroup that includes my child. And, in some instances, the Coherentist\nProcedure may call for revising such pre-theoretical judgments. For\nsuppose that the target non-consequentialist theory holds that my\nturning in my daughter to police is morally better than my refraining\nfrom doing so but our pre-theoretical judgment is that I ought to\nprefer the outcome in which I refrain from turning her in to the\noutcome in which I turn her in. In that case, the act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory must either deny that my turning her in is morally\nbetter than my not doing so (and, thus, give up being perfectly\nco-extensive with the target non-consequentialist theory) or reject\nthe intuitive judgment that I ought to prefer the outcome in which I\nrefrain from turning her in to the outcome in which I turn her in.\nBut, even so, it could be that the resulting act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory is more intuitively plausible than both\nutilitarianism and standard versions of non-consequentialism.\n\nBut even if the earnest consequentializer doesn\u2019t need to\naccommodate every deontic verdict that every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory can accommodate, they do need to\nconsequentialize a good number of them. Moreover, they need to do so\nwithout sacrificing whatever the Compelling Idea is. And whether they\ncan do that depends on what the Compelling Idea is. To illustrate,\nsuppose that we take the Compelling Idea to be\n Best Outcome.\n Since the best outcome is the outcome that\u2019s best from what\nSidgwick (1907) described as \u201cthe point of view of the\nuniverse\u201d, it seems that we must abandon this idea if we want to\nconsequentialize certain deontic verdicts, such as those stemming from\nagent-centered restrictions (but see Dougherty 2013; N. R. Howard\n2022; and Setiya 2018 for a contrary position). And this is why many\nearnest consequentializers reject\n Best Outcome\n in favor of\n Best-Relative-to,\n Most Reason to Desire, or\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses.\n4.3 Act-Consequentialist Counterpart Theories Are Gimmicky\n\nSome philosophers claim that consequentializing a target\nnon-consequentialist theory results in a gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory\u2014and, thus, one that\u2019s implausible (see,\ne.g., Nozick 1974: 29). And, admittedly, the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory can seem gimmicky when we\narrive at it via the Footian Procedure. In that case, the\nconsequentializer just takes whatever features of actions that the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory holds to be intrinsically\nwrong-making and insists that they are instead features of outcomes\nthat make them rank poorly. So, if the non-consequentialist theory\nholds that an act\u2019s being a promise-breaking is, other things\nbeing equal, what makes it wrong, the consequentializer will hold\ninstead that an outcome\u2019s including a promise-breaking is, other\nthings being equal, what makes it rank lower than one that\ndoesn\u2019t. And this move can seem ad hoc.\n\nBut the fact that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheories are gimmicky (and, thus, ad hoc) is no objection to\neither notational consequentializing or pragmatic consequentializing.\nSuch consequentializers will readily concede that these resulting\ntheories are gimmicky. The notational consequentializer will argue\nthat all extensionally equivalent theories are gimmicky\nrepresentations of each other in that they are all just arbitrarily\ndifferent notational variants on the same moral view. So, the fact\nthat consequentializing produces gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theories is no objection to notational consequentializing.\nAnd it\u2019s no objection to pragmatic consequentializing either.\nThe pragmatic consequentializer is happy to admit not only that the\nresulting act-consequentialist counterpart theories are gimmicky but\nalso that they are, consequently, implausible. For pragmatic\nconsequentializers reject the resulting act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theories that they construct merely for certain pragmatic\npurposes.\n\nOf course, things are different for the earnest consequentializer. It\nwould be a problem if they produced an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that was gimmicky. But, arguably, the result of\nearnest consequentializing isn\u2019t gimmicky given that it employs\nthe Coherentist Procedure rather than the Footian Procedure. Of\ncourse, when the earnest consequentializer accommodates, say, our\nintuition that it\u2019s wrong for Abe to break his promise even to\nprevent both Bert and Carl from breaking theirs, they do so by\ninsisting that Abe ought to prefer the outcome in which he keeps his\npromise and Bert and Carl break theirs to the outcome in which he\nbreaks his promise and Bert and Carl keep theirs. But the motivation\nfor this move isn\u2019t the ad hoc one that making it\nallows them to accommodate this intuition. Instead, the earnest\nconsequentializer motivates this move on independent grounds: agents\nbear a special responsibility for their own agency and, thus, for\ntheir own promises. Thus, an agent should, other things being equal,\nblame themselves more harshly for breaking one of their own promises\nthan for letting two others each break one of theirs. And this\nmotivation should appeal even to non-consequentialists. For\nnon-consequentialists, such as Bernard Williams, have powerfully\nargued that agents have a special responsibility for their own\nactions, a responsibility that they don\u2019t bear for what they\nallow others to do. In any case, this thought that agent\u2019s bear\na special responsibility for their own agency can motivate the earnest\nconsequentializer\u2019s claim that agents should prefer, other\nthings being equal, the outcome in which two others violate an\nagent-centered restriction to the outcome in which they themselves\nviolate that restriction\u2014see Otsuka 2011: 42; Portmore 2011:\n100\u2013103; and Williams 1973: 93\u2013100. And, so, there\nneedn\u2019t be anything gimmicky about the way in which the earnest\nconsequentializer motivates these sorts of moves in accommodating our\ncommonsense moral intuitions.\n\nSo, on the one hand, it\u2019s clear that both notational\nconsequentializing and pragmatic consequentializing produce gimmicky\nact-consequentialist counterpart theories by employing the Footian\nProcedure but unclear why this should be objectionable. On the other\nhand, it\u2019s clear that it would be objectionable for the earnest\nconsequentializer to produce a gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory but unclear why we should think that they would\ngiven that they employ the Coherentist Procedure rather than the\nFootian Procedure.\n4.4 Act-Consequentialist Counterpart Theories Are Explanatorily Inadequate\n\nEven if the act-consequentialist counterpart theories that earnest\nconsequentializers produce aren\u2019t gimmicky, they could be\nobjectionable for other reasons. Indeed, some argue that they are\nexplanatorily inadequate. For whereas many earnest consequentializers\nadopt\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses\n and, so, hold that the deontic statuses of actions are grounded in\nthe reasons that agents have for preferring (or dispreferring) the\noutcomes in which they are performed, others believe that it\u2019s\nthe other way around. As they see it, these act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theories invert the true explanatory direction. For\nwhereas the earnest consequentializer holds that the impermissibility\nof Abe\u2019s breaking his promise is grounded in the fact that he\nought to prefer the outcome in which he keeps it, they believe instead\nthat Abe\u2019s reason for preferring the outcome in which he keeps\nit is grounded in the fact that it\u2019s impermissible for him to\nbreak it. And precursors of this objection go as far back as E. F.\nCarritt (1928: 72\u20133) and W. D. Ross (1939: 289), both of whom\nargued that even if we think that promise-breakings are bad, we should\nthink this only because it\u2019s wrong to break a promise. And, so,\nthe wrongness of promise-breakings explains their badness, not the\nother way around, as the act-consequentialist might suppose.\n\nEarnest consequentializers retort that it\u2019s actually\nnon-consequentialists who invert the true order of explanation. They\nargue that the deontic statuses of actions are grounded in reasons for\nperforming them and that it\u2019s more plausible to think that\nreasons for actions are grounded in reasons for preferring their\noutcomes than vice versa (see, e.g., Portmore 2011: chap. 3,\nespecially 78\u201382).\n\nMore recently, however, Stephen Emet (2010) and Christopher Howard\n(2021) have argued that act-consequentialist counterpart theories are\nexplanatorily inadequate for a different reason. They argue that, in\ntaking the Compelling Idea to be something such as\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses,\n the earnest consequentializer is forced to give up a plausible\nrationale for certain deontic verdicts. Take, for instance, the\ndeontic verdict that it would be wrong for you to kill even in a\nsituation in which the mafia has credibly threatened to kill five\ninnocent strangers unless you kill a sixth (C. Howard 2021: 728).\nHoward claims that, in providing a rationale for this verdict, the\nearnest consequentializer must eschew the plausible view that it lies\nwith the fact that your potential victim has the kind of value that\ncalls for your not treating them as a mere means and must instead\nembrace the implausible view that it lies with the fact that you, the\nagent, ought to have a self-centered, and self-indulgent, preference\nfor keeping your own hands clean. He argues that since your reasons\nfor refraining from treating your potential victim as a mere means\n\n\nhave their source in the value of [your potential victim],\n\u2026they\u2019re reasons\u2026[that] don\u2019t derive\nfrom\u2026[your] reasons for preferring some outcomes to others.\n(2021: 749)\n\n\nBut this reasoning is fallacious. From the fact that A\nultimately derives from (and, thus, has its source in) C, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that A doesn\u2019t derive from\nB. For it could be that A derives from B,\nwhich in turn derives from C.\n\nAct-consequentialists are committed to the evaluative rankings of\noutcomes being explanatorily prior to the deontic statuses of the\nactions that produce them, but they\u2019re not committed to the\nevaluative rankings of outcomes being explanatory prior to the deontic\nstatuses of attitudes, such as the attitude of respect towards\nends-in-themselves. Given this, earnest consequentializers can argue\nthat there\u2019s nothing that precludes them from holding either\nthat persons are ends-in-themselves who are owed respect or that this\nfact is explanatorily prior to the evaluative rankings of outcomes.\nThat is, earnest consequentializers can argue that you have a duty to\nrespect persons and that this duty gives rise to a duty to prefer that\nyou not treat them as a mere means\u2014even as a mere means to that\nof preventing the mafia from killing five others. What\u2019s more,\ngiven this duty to prefer the outcome in which you refrain from\nkilling the one to the outcome in which you kill the one as a mere\nmeans to preventing the mafia from killing the five, the former\noutranks the latter from your evaluative position. And this, given\nact-consequentialism, explains the impermissibility of your killing\nthe one to prevent the five from being killed by the mafia. Thus, the\nearnest consequentializer hopes to consequentialize the deontic\nverdict that it\u2019s wrong for you to kill the one even to prevent\nthe mafia from killing the five without giving up the plausible\nthought that the rationale for this ultimately lies with your\nwould-be victim and their value as an end-in-themself (see Portmore\nforthcoming and Portmore 2019: 235\u20137).\n\nNow, one may object that if someone concedes that the rationale for\nthe impermissibility of your killing the one to prevent the five from\nbeing killed by the mafia ultimately lies with your would-be victim\nand their value as an end-in-themself, then they thereby commit\nthemself to Kantianism as opposed to act-consequentialism. But earnest\nconsequentializers argue that this is a mistake. They believe that the\ndifference between Kantianism and act-consequentialism is that whereas\nthe former holds that the ultimate right-making feature of an act is\nthat it shows the proper respect for humanity, the latter holds that\nthe ultimate right-making feature of an act is instead that its\noutcome is not outranked by that of any available alternative. Thus,\nthe act-consequentialist can hold that what determines whether one\noutcome is outranked by another is anything other than the deontic\nstatuses of the acts that produce them. So, they can even hold that\nwhat determines whether the one outranks the other is whether the\nagent treats someone who is an end-in-themself as a mere means in the\none but not the other.\n\nAs the earnest consequentializer sees things, moral theories are to be\ndifferentiated by what they take the ultimate right- and wrong-making\nfeatures of actions to be, not by what they take the ultimate\nrationale for an act\u2019s being right or wrong to be. To\nillustrate, consider utilitarian theological voluntarism again. It\nholds both that the ultimate right-making feature of an act is that it\naccords with God\u2019s will and that God is perfectly good and, so,\nwills each of us to maximize the good, which they take to be hedonic\nutility. In their view, the ultimate rationale for an act\u2019s\nbeing obligatory is that it produces the best outcome. For they hold\nthat an act\u2019s outcome being best is what explains why God (being\nperfectly good) wills the agent to perform it. And God\u2019s willing\nthe agent to perform it, in turn, explains why it\u2019s obligatory.\nBut, as earnest consequentializers see things, this doesn\u2019t make\nthe view act-consequentialist. Indeed, they see it as a rival to\nact-consequentialism given that it holds that the ultimate\nright-making feature of an act is that it accords with God\u2019s\nwill, not that its outcome is not outranked by that of any available\nalternative. And this does seem to be a significant difference. For if\nthe theological voluntarist were to be convinced that, in fact, God\nisn\u2019t perfectly good and even wills us to torture children for\nfun, they would be forced to concede that it would be right to do so.\nBy contrast, the act-consequentialist\u2019s view of what\u2019s\nright is independent of their view on what God wills. Given this,\nearnest consequentializers think that we should conclude that a theory\nthat holds that the ultimate right-making feature of an act is that\nits outcome is not outranked by that of any available alternative is\nact-consequentialist even if it holds that the rationale for the\nwrongness of your killing the one to prevent the mafia from killing\nthe five ultimately lies with your would-be victim and their value as\nan end-in-themself.\n\nThere is, of course, more to be said on this topic of explanatory\nadequacy, including whether the earnest consequentializer can give a\nplausible explanation for the idea that it\u2019s sometimes wrong to\nviolate an agent-centered constraint even to minimize one\u2019s own\nviolations of that constraint\u2014see, e.g., Brook 1991; Kamm 1996;\nLopez et al. 2009; Otsuka 2011; and Portmore forthcoming. Still, the\nabove should give the reader a sense of why non-consequentialists\nmight find act-consequentialist counterpart theories to be\nexplanatorily inadequate and how the earnest consequentializer might\nreply to such worries.\n4.5 \u201cHas an Outcome that Outranks Every Available Alternative\u201d Isn\u2019t Equivalent to \u201cOught to Be Performed\u201d\n\nThis last objection applies only to notational consequentializers. As\nwe saw above, notational consequentializers accept two controversial\nassumptions: the first two premises of their assimilation argument. We\nalready considered their defense of the first premise in\n section 4.2.\n And now it\u2019s time to see how they defend the second premise:\nthe assumption that if an act-consequentialist theory and a\nnon-consequentialist theory are necessarily co-extensive in their\ndeontic verdicts, then they are equivalent in the strong sense of\nbeing mere notational variants of each other.\n\nBefore we get to this defense, though, it\u2019s important to get\nclear on what the assumption is. It\u2019s that just as we can refer\nto the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a pot of boiling\nwater at one atmosphere of pressure using either the metric expression\n\u201c100 degrees Celsius\u201d or some equivalent non-metric\nexpression such as \u201c212 degrees Fahrenheit\u201d, we can refer\nto what makes an act one that ought to be performed using either the\nconsequentialist expression \u201chas an outcome that outranks every\navailable alternative\u201d or some putatively equivalent\nnon-consequentialist expression such as \u201cis necessary to show\nthe proper respect for humanity\u201d. The thought, then, is that\nwhat matters is only what Dreier calls the \u201cactive\ningredients\u201d, not the expressions that we use to label them.\nAnd, in the case of what makes a pot of water boiling, the active\ningredient is the average kinetic energy of the water\u2019s\nmolecules, whereas, in the case of what makes an act one that ought to\nbe performed, it is, according to Dreier, the features of its outcome\n(which includes the act itself) that contribute to its deontic\nstatus\u2014see Dreier 2011: 114.\n\nNow, one way of defending this underlying thought is to claim, as A.\nC. Ewing did, that \u201cthe good\u201d just means \u201cwhat ought\nto be brought into existence, other things being equal\u201d (1939:\n8). But, on this view, a non-consequentialist who claims that it can\nbe wrong to bring into existence what\u2019s best is just misusing\nthe word \u201cbest\u201d. And this may seem too quick.\n\nDreier is less quick. He claims only that insofar as we have some\npre-theoretical notion of a good outcome,\n\n\nits specific content is too weak and thin for it to come apart from\nthe notion of what we are to choose. (Dreier 2011: 115)\n\n\nThus,\n\n\nDreier\u2019s idea (following Foot) is that we don\u2019t have a\nconcept of goodness (applied to outcomes) that is independent of\nthoughts about what we ought to do. (S. A. Schroeder 2017: 1482)\n\n\nFor, as Dreier sees it, the notion of an act whose outcome outranks\nevery available alternative cannot come apart from the notion of an\nact that ought to be performed.\n\nOne reason to doubt this, however, is that whereas some theories hold\nthat whether an agent ought to perform an act just depends on whether\nits outcome outranks every available alternative, other\ntheories hold that it depends instead on whether the outcome of\nthe best option in which the agent performs it outranks every\navailable alternative. Thus, an act whose outcome outranks every\navailable alternative needn\u2019t be one that ought to be performed,\ncontrary to Dreier\u2019s assertions. To illustrate, consider the\nfollowing example from Frank Jackson:\n\n\nWonderful things will happen if I raise both my arms at some given\ntime t. OK things will happen if I raise neither arm at\nt, and also if I raise my right arm but not my left arm at\nt. Dreadful things will happen if I raise my left arm but not\nmy right arm at t. If I raise my left arm at t, I\nwill not raise my right arm at t. I am completely free to\nraise or not to raise either of my arms at t. Let\u2019s\nsuppose that all the foregoing is known for certain by me at the time\nin question. (2014: 645)\n\n\nAccording to some theorists, I ought not to raise my left arm at\nt, because the outcome of my raising my left arm at\nt is outranked by that of an available alternative: that of\nmy raising neither arm at t. These theorists include both\nomnists and actualists\u2014see Portmore 2019 and\nTimmerman & Cohen 2019 [2020], respectively. Given that I will not\nraise my right arm at t if I raise my left arm at t,\ndreadful things will happen if I raise my left arm at t. But\nOK things will happen if I instead either raise neither arm at\nt or raise only my right arm at t. So, these\ntheorists hold that I should not raise my left arm at t.\n\nBut other theorists hold that I ought to raise my left arm at\nt, because although its outcome is outranked by that of\nrefraining from raising my left arm at t, the outcome of the\nbest option in which I raise my left arm at t\u2014that is,\nthe option in which I raise both my arms at t\u2014outranks\nevery available alternative. These theorists include both\nmaximalists and possibilists\u2014see Portmore 2019\nand Timmerman & Cohen 2019 [2020], respectively. After all,\nwonderful things will happen if I raise both my arms at t.\nAnd I have no option where something better than wonderful things\nwould happen. So, I ought to raise both my arms at t. And\nsince this entails raising my left arm at t, I ought to raise\nmy left arm at t.\n\nThis suggests, contrary to Dreier\u2019s assertions, that the notion\nof an act whose outcome outranks every available alternative can come\napart from the notion of an act that ought to be performed. For these\ntwo types of theorists agree that the outcome of my raising my left\narm at t (the outcome in which dreadful things happen) is\noutranked by that of my raising neither arm at t (the outcome\nin which OK things happen). And they agree that the outcome of my\nraising both my arms at t (the outcome in which wonderful\nthings happen) outranks those of every available alternative. But\ndespite their agreeing on how all the outcomes rank, they disagree on\nwhether I ought to perform the option of raising my left arm at\nt. In other words, the two theories agree on how to rank all\nthe available outcomes but disagree on whether the act whose outcome\noutranks every available alternative must always be the one that ought\nto be performed\u2014see Nair 2020. Thus, the two theories disagree\non what the active ingredients are and not just on how to label them.\nFor whereas omnists (and actualists) hold that the active ingredient\nin making an act one that ought to be performed is that its\noutcome outranks every available alternative (as Dreier\nassertions entail), maximalists (and possibilists) hold that it is\ninstead that the outcome of the best option in which the agent\nperforms it outranks every available alternative. Of course,\nDreier could try to argue that these two types of theories are somehow\nequivalent, but, as Shyam Nair points out, doing so would involve\nuncharitably insisting that one of them accepts a very implausible\nclaim about how to rank outcomes\u2014see his 2020. Unfortunately,\nNair\u2019s argument is too long and complex to summarize here. But\nthe reader should at least have a sense of this objection and how it\nmight be rebutted.\n5. Conclusion\n\nAs Campbell Brown (2011) has noted, arguing with an\nact-consequentialist can be frustrating. You describe some\naction\u2014say, your killing one innocent person to prevent the\nmafia from killing five other innocent people. And then you claim that\nalthough your doing this would clearly be wrong, the outcome in which\nyou do this is one that you should prefer to (and, thus, one that\noutranks) the outcome in which you don\u2019t do this. You conclude,\ntherefore, that act-consequentialism is false: an act can be wrong\neven though its outcome is not outranked by that of any available\nalternative. But the act-consequentialist retorts that, to reach this\nconclusion, you had to presuppose a particular account of how outcomes\nrank, one that the act-consequentialist needn\u2019t accept. So, you\nwere wrong to conclude that act-consequentialism is false. All that\nyou\u2019ve shown is that a certain version of act-consequentialism\nis false. But we already knew that act-consequentialism yields\ncounterintuitive deontic verdicts when combined with certain\nassumptions about how outcomes rank. We learned that long ago by\nstudying the implications of utilitarianism.\n\nNote, then, that arguing against act-consequentialism is a complex\ntask. You can\u2019t test it in isolation from various background\nassumptions. Instead, you must evaluate it along with various\nbackground assumptions, including assumptions not only about how to\nrank outcomes but also about the nature of actions and the reasons for\nperforming them.\n\nThis entry suggests that evaluating the merits of consequentializing\nis similarly complex. First, there\u2019s no consequentializing\ntout court, but only three different types of\nconsequentializing. Objections that apply to one don\u2019t\nnecessarily apply to the others. Second, each type of\nconsequentializing has a different motivation. So, there\u2019s no\nway to assess whether consequentializing is, in general, unmotivated.\nWe can assess only whether a particular type of consequentializing is\nunmotivated. And, in the case of earnest consequentializing, this is\nfurther complicated by the fact that earnest consequentializers offer\ndifferent motivations for different moves\u2014e.g., the idea that we\nhave a special responsibility for our own agency as a motivation for\nwhy agents should prefer that others rather than themselves violate\nagent-centered restrictions. Third, there are two different procedures\nfor consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory. And this means\nthat we can\u2019t just assess whether, in general,\nconsequentializing produces a gimmicky theory. We must instead look at\nwhether either of these two procedures produces a gimmicky theory.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Baumann, Marius, 2019, \u201cConsequentializing and\nUnderdetermination\u201d, <em>Australasian Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 97(3): 511\u2013527.\ndoi:10.1080/00048402.2018.1501078", "Benthem, Jeremy, 1789 [1961], <em>An Introduction to the\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation</em>, London: T.
