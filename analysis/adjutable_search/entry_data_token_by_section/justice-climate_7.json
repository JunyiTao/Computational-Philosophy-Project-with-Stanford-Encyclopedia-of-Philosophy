Responsibilities\n\nSuppose that we have identified what kinds of interests should be\nincluded in a theory of justice, what responsibilities persons owe to\nfuture people, and how to treat risk and uncertainty. These can guide\nus in determining what goals we should aim for. The next question to\nask is \u2018Who has what responsibilities to meet\nthese goals?\u2019 It is helpful to break this question down into several\nparts. We can identify four further questions, which together would\nenable us to answer this question and tell us what would be a just\ndistribution of climate responsibilities.\n\nFirst, it is important to be clear on the content of the\nresponsibilities. As noted at the start, climate scientists and\npolicy-makers focus primarily (though not exclusively) on two kinds of\npolicies\u2014mitigation and adaptation. The first question, then, is\n\u201cWho should engage in mitigation and adaptation, and to what\nextent?\u201d Let us call this the Climate Action Question.\n\nA second question is \u201cWho should bear the costs of mitigation\nand adaptation?\u201d Mitigation will often involve economic (and\nother) types of cost. For example, if a carbon tax is levied on goods\nthen purchasers of those goods will be financially worse off.\nSometimes mitigation policies come with benefits (for example,\nregulations discouraging car use are likely to improve air quality;\nencouraging people to cycle rather than drive may improve physical\nfitness). In many cases, however, the policies come with a cost.\nLikewise adaptation policies (such as designing cities to cope better\nwith heatwaves) will come at a cost. Who should pay for these? Let us\ncall this the Burden-Sharing Question.\n\nA third question is Who has the responsibility to ensure that (a)\nthose designated to engage in mitigation and adaptation do so and (b)\nthose designated to bear any financial burdens discharge their\nresponsibilities? Let us call this the Political Action Question.\n\nThe fourth question is rather different in kind. It asks, for all of\nthe previous questions, what kinds of entities are the duty-bearers?\nMany will assume that governments have such responsibilities, but what\nabout other actors? Are individuals duty-bearers? For example, do\nindividuals have duties to engage in mitigation? Or does that duty\nfall exclusively on other actors?\n",
