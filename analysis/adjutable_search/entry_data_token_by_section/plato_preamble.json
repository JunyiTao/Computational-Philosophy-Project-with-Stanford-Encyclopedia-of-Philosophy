    "main_text": "\n\nPlato (429?\u2013347 B.C.E.) is, by any reckoning, one of the most\ndazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most\npenetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the history of\nphilosophy. An Athenian citizen of high status, he displays in his\nworks his absorption in the political events and intellectual\nmovements of his time, but the questions he raises are so profound and\nthe strategies he uses for tackling them so richly suggestive and\nprovocative that educated readers of nearly every period have in some\nway been influenced by him, and in practically every age there have\nbeen philosophers who count themselves Platonists in some important\nrespects. He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d should be applied. But he was so\nself-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its\nscope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the\nintellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of\nphilosophy, as it is often conceived\u2014a rigorous and systematic\nexamination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological\nissues, armed with a distinctive method\u2014can be called his\ninvention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy\napproximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who\nstudied with him), Aquinas, and Kant would be generally agreed to be\nof the same rank.\n",
