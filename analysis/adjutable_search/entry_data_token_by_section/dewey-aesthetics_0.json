    "main_text": "Early Forays into Aesthetics\n1. Early Forays into Aesthetics\n\nDewey was in his seventies when Art as Experience was\npublished, but also his earlier work contains numerous discussions of\naesthetic related themes, beginning already from his very first book,\nPsychology (1887), in which Dewey discusses aesthetics and\nthe arts at various points. Dewey, for example, emphasizes the\nimportance of rhythm to our psychic lives, both in perception and in\nexpression. The soul tends to express its most intimate states,\nespecially emotion, in rhythmic form. Rhythm is defined as the\nmind\u2019s reduction of variety to unity or its breaking unity into\nvariety. It happens when certain beats are emphasized at regular\nintervals, and it requires that elements be organized temporally,\nthrough the mind being carried back and forth, to form a whole. It is\nnot confined to the arts but is pervasive in our experience of\ntime.\n\nPsychology comes from Dewey\u2019s idealist period, which\nfor example shows up in the book\u2019s treatment of imagination,\naesthetic feeling, and beauty. Dewey distinguishes between different\nforms of imagination, which he defines as intellect embodying ideas in\nparticular images. The highest form of imagination is creative\nimagination, which allows us to penetrate into the hidden meaning of\nthings through finding sensuous forms that are both highly revealing\nand pleasurable. It makes its objects anew through non-mechanical\nseparation and combination. Implicitly following Kant, Dewey holds\nthat creative imagination\u2019s goal is free play of the\nself\u2019s faculties. Its function is to seize meaning and embody it\nin sensuous form to give rise to feeling, thus representing the freely\nactive subjective self.\n\nPart Two of Psychology is devoted to feeling, including, in\nChapter Fifteen, aesthetic feeling. This chapter also deals with fine\nart and taste. Aesthetic feelings characteristically accompany\nperception of \u201cthe ideal value of experience\u201d\n(PS: 267). The mind responds to certain relations to ideals\nthrough feelings of beauty or ugliness. Every content of experience\nhas beauty in it to the extent that it contains an ideal element.\nEchoing recent views on functional beauty, Dewey argues that a train\nengine, for example, is beautiful insofar as it is felt to\nsuccessfully embody its ideal, i.e., its ability to overcome distances\nand bring humans together. The beautiful object requires a sensuous\nmaterial. However, this sensuous material is only important insofar as\nit presents the ideal. Art cannot be purely idealistic in the sense of\nabandoning sensuous material, but it is idealistic in that it uses\nsuch material to promote the appreciation of ideal values of\nexperience. The aesthetic feeling of beauty is universal and not a\nthing of place and time.\n\nThis universality excludes such lower senses as taste and smell from\nthe beautiful. It also excludes the feeling of ownership and any\nreference to external ends. Harmony constitutes beauty. Harmony is\ndefined as the feeling that accompanies agreement of experience with\nthe self\u2019s ideal nature (PS: 273). Art attempts to\nsatisfy the aesthetic in our nature, and it succeeds when it expresses\nthe ideal completely. The idea, in turn, is the \u201ccompletely\ndeveloped self\u201d. So the goal of art is to create the perfectly\nharmonious self. Against this background, Dewey ranks the fine arts\naccording to their level of ideality. Architecture is the least ideal\nart, while poetry is fully ideal, having little that is\nsensuous in it, concentrating as it does on the vital personality of\nman himself (and nature as only a reflection of this).\n\nEspecially outside of philosophical circles, Dewey is best known for\nhis work in education. One of his major works in this area,\nDemocracy and Education (1916), also includes reflections on\naesthetic themes, particularly on the imagination, which Dewey regards\n\u201cas the sole way of escape from mechanical methods in\nteaching\u201d (DE: 245) that he, in general, opposes.\nAnticipating the naturalism of Art as Experience Dewey argues\nthat there is no essential gap between aesthetic experience and other\nforms of experience. The function of the fine arts is not to provide\nan escape from ordinary life. Rather, it is the enhancement of\nqualities that make ordinary experiences appealing. The arts are the\nmain means of achieving \u201can intensified, enhanced\nappreciation\u201d (DE: 246). Their purpose, beyond being\nenjoyable, is that they fix taste, reveal depth of meaning in\notherwise mediocre experiences, and concentrate and focus elements of\nwhat is considered good. In the end the fine arts are \u201cnot\nluxuries of education, but emphatic expressions of that which makes\nany education worthwhile\u201d (DE: 247). Dewey is also\ncritical of the Aristotelian distinction between useful labor and\nleisure, where the second is privileged over the first, and believes\nthis prejudicial distinction is still dominant. He comes back to this\nissue in Art as Experience, where he suggests a new\nunderstanding of the relationship between means and ends as a way of\nimproving the quality of people\u2019s daily experience. Means should\nnot be seen as mere disposable preliminary stages, which can be thrown\naway like a ladder once the end is reached, but as integral parts of\nthe ends that they help to fulfill. This reversal, Dewey believes,\nwill infuse people\u2019s everyday experience with a sense of\ndirection and meaning.\n\nThe essay Reconstruction in Philosophy, published in 1920,\nconcludes with a view of an ideal future in which ideas are deepened\nbecause they are expressed in imaginative vision and fine art.\nReligious and scientific values will be reconciled and art will no\nlonger be a mere luxury or a stranger to everyday life. Making a\nliving will be making a life worth living, and the hardness of\ncontemporary life will be bathed in a new light.\n\nDewey returned briefly to issues of the role of art in society in\nThe Public and its Problems (1927), where art is seen as\nsomething that can resolve the problem of dissemination of ideas\nappropriate for social change. Artists are the real purveyors of news\ninsofar as they cause happenings to kindle emotion and perception. For\nDewey, Walt Whitman was the exemplar of such an artist. He concludes\nthat for a great community and a real public to come into being an art\nof \u201cfull and moving communication\u201d must take possession of\nour mechanized world (PP: 350).\n\nIn \u201cQualitative Thought\u201d, which appears in Philosophy\nand Civilization (1931), Dewey says some things that anticipate\nsome of the moves he makes in Art as Experience. For example,\nhe argues that there is a \u201clogic of artistic construction\u201d\nand that refusal to admit this is a sign of breakdown of traditional\nlogic. When a work of art does not hold together so that the quality\nof one part reinforces and expands the qualities of the other parts it\nfails. Works that are genuine intellectual and logical wholes have an\nunderlying quality that defines them and that controls the\nartist\u2019s thinking. The logic of such an artist is the logic of\nqualitative thinking.\n",
