    "main_text": "\n\n\nPractitioners of feminist philosophy of biology use gender as an\nanalytic category to conduct philosophical investigations of the\nbiological sciences. Feminist philosophy of biology deploys feminist\nphilosophical methods to examine the categories of sex and gender (sex\nand gender will be explained below) and its focus can range from\nconsiderations of particular biological knowledge claims to\nconsiderations of foundational concepts and methodologies in biology,\nthe philosophy of biology, and the philosophy of science. In\ndoing so, feminist philosophers of biology often show that the\nphilosophical investigations of a particular science are intertwined\nwith both ethics and politics.\n\n\nThis entry is divided into five sections. The introductory\nsection discusses some of the challenges of defining feminist\nphilosophy of biology and highlights areas of commonality with\nnon-feminist philosophy of biology. The second section explores the\nvariety of motivations and epistemic perspectives found within feminist\nphilosophy of biology. The third section considers, in some\ndepth, two central examples of feminist analysis of biological\nresearch: a) sexual selection and b) sociobiology and evolutionary\npsychology of sex and gender. In section four I discuss feminist\nanalyses of some foundational concepts within philosophy of biology and\nphilosophy of science more generally, such as biological determinism\nand reductionism. Many of these foundational concepts are\nconsidered by both feminist and non-feminist philosophers of\nbiology. The entry concludes with a discussion of opportunities\nfor further research in feminist philosophy of biology.\n",
