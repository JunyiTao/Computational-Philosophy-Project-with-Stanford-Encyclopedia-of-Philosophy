    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Rorty\u2019s America\n3.6 Rorty\u2019s America\n\nRorty\u2019s utopian yearnings describe an America that has taken up\nhis proposal to replace theory with metaphor and universal moral\nprinciples with feelings of solidarity (\u201cLooking Backwards from\nthe Year 2096\u201d in PSH). He also argues that achieving solidarity\nrequires economic security; when our economic circumstances are such\nthat we are forced to choose between feeding our families and feeding\nstrangers, the community to which one is loyal will contract. In his\nwords,\n\n\nOur loyalty to \u2026 larger groups will, however, weaken, or even\nvanish altogether, when things get really tough. Then people whom we\nonce thought of as like ourselves will be excluded. Sharing food with\nimpoverished people down the street is natural and right in normal\ntimes, but perhaps not in a famine, when doing so amounts to\ndisloyalty to one\u2019s family. The tougher things get, the more\nties of loyalty to those near at hand tighten, and the more those to\neveryone else slacken. (PCP, 42)\n\n\nFollowing the pragmatist insight that beliefs are habits of action,\nRorty contends that to hold a belief simply means that one is inclined\nto act in certain ways and not in others. Thus, \u201cto believe that\nsomeone is \u2018one of us,\u2019 a member of our moral community,\nis to exhibit readiness to come to their assistance when they are in\nneed\u201d (Rorty 1996, 13). Thus \u201can answer to the question\n\u2018who are we?\u2019 which is to have any moral significance, has\nto be one which takes money into account\u201d (Rorty 1996, 14).\n\nThis helps to explain why Rorty calls for a return to the reformist\nLeft of the 1960s in America, when universities and unions found\ncommon cause. What Rorty calls the \u201ccultural Left\u201d \u2013\nthe contemporary, academic left \u2013 is plagued by two related\nproblems. First, it has ignored economic inequality (Rorty\u2019s\nshorthand for which is \u201cselfishness\u201d) and focused on\nother, identity-based forms of inequality (Rorty\u2019s shorthand for\nwhich is \u201csadism\u201d). While Rorty thinks attempting to\nameliorate racial and gender inequality is a laudable goal, he laments\nthe fact that this focus has displaced the focus on economic\ninequality. Second, Rorty worries that the cultural left tries to\ntheorize its way \u201cinto political relevance,\u201d and thereby\nadopts a \u201cspectatorial approach\u201d (AOC, 94). In so doing,\nit prioritizes knowledge over hope. Thus, Rorty enjoins the cultural\nLeft to abandon its spectatorial approach by abandoning theory and\nreviving its hope in the promise of America.\n\nA reinvigorated Left would have to reclaim the sort of pride in\nAmerica that animated the work of the reformist Left. Rorty opens\nAchieving Our Country (1998) by writing,\n\n\nNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a\nnecessary condition for self-improvement. Too much national pride can\nproduce bellicosity and imperialism, just as excessive self-respect\ncan produce arrogance. But just as too little self-respect makes it\ndifficult for a person to display moral courage, so insufficient\nnational pride makes energetic and effective debate about national\npolicy unlikely. (AOC, 3)\n\n\nWhile philosophical theorizing about America is a symptom of\nhopelessness, engaging in debates about what America can do and become\nrepresents a hopeful attitude that he thinks is required for social\nprogress.\n",
