    "main_text": "Arguments against svabh\u0101va || Knowledge\n3.4 Knowledge\n\nThe Indian philosophical tradition distinguishes a variety of\nepistemic instruments (pram\u0101\u1e47a) by which epistemic\nobjects (prameya) are accessed. Which epistemic instruments\nwere accepted and how their function is understood differs amongst\nphilosophical theories. In his discussion of epistemology\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna lists four such instruments: perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\nrecognition of likeness (upam\u0101na), and testimony\n(\u0101gama). His primary concern is not a discussion of the\nnature and interrelation of these different epistemic instruments, but\nthe question of how to establish any particular set of such\ninstruments, whether it is the one just indicated or a different one.\nOnce we have agreed that the existence of epistemic objects is\nestablished by the epistemic instruments (as for example the existence\nof the desk in front of me is established by my perceptual abilities,\nin this case primarily non-defective vision) we then have to address\nthe further question of how to establish the instruments. How do we\nknow that these instruments are good guides to the objects out there\nin the world?\n\nThere are three different ways in which we can try to establish\nepistemic instruments. First of all we could regard them as\nestablished by mutual coherence. Secondly we could assume that the\nepistemic instruments justify themselves. We do not have to go beyond\nperception to realize that perception usually delivers an accurate\npicture of the world, but perception itself presents a faithful\nrepresentation of the world and of its own validity. Finally one could\nregard the epistemic instruments and objects as mutually establishing\neach other. The instruments establish an object by giving us epistemic\naccess to it. But we could also argue that the epistemic object in\nturn establishes the epistemic instruments. Given that we manage to\ninteract with the epistemic objects more or less successfully (as\nconfirmed by the evolutionary success of our species) there must be\nsomething amongst our cognitive means which gives us a relatively\naccurate account of the way things are. In this way epistemic success\nallows us to establish the means of knowledge via the objects\nsuccessfully cognized.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna does not devote a great deal of discussion of to\nthe first alternative, the establishment of the epistemic instruments\nby mutual coherence (for some discussion see Stoltz 2021:\n156\u2013157). The reason for this is that this is hardly a position\nhis realist Naiy\u0101yika opponent will want to adopt. There are,\nafter all, coherent fairy-tales. Let us therefore have a closer look\nat the other two alternatives, paying particular attention to whether\nthere is any way in which the epistemic objects and instruments could\nbe construed as having their nature intrinsically, that is, as\nexisting with svabh\u0101va.\n3.4.1 Are the epistemic instruments self-established?\n\nRegarding the epistemic instruments as self-established has the\nimmediate advantage of avoiding two difficulties. Firstly we get\naround the infinite regress of establishing the instruments by other\ninstruments, which then in turn need yet other instruments to\nestablish them, and so forth. Unlike other forms of infinite regress\nwhich N\u0101g\u0101rjuna accepts (such as an infinitely extended\nchain of causes and conditions) this regress is vicious, since the\nburden of proof is transferred in its entirety to the preceding stage,\nas an epistemic instrument would have to establish all the succeeding\nones. Secondly the self-establishment of the epistemic instruments\nallows the opponent to hold on to the assumption that everything\nknowable is established by such instruments. It might be attractive to\ngive up this assumption in order to escape the vicious regress, but\nthis then makes it necessary to give a special reason explaining why\nordinary objects are by established epistemic instruments, but not the\ninstruments themselves.\n\nDespite these advantages, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, there are some\nserious problems with the assumption that the epistemic instruments\nare self-established. First of all, if an epistemic instrument, such\nas visual perception, was self-established it should be able to exist\nindependently of the existence of an object of vision. But if we then\nassume that it is an essential property of visual perception to see,\nvisual perception must be able to function as its own object, as\notherwise there might be no other object to be seen. This,\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna claims, then leads to a problem already\nencountered in his analysis of motion. The mover and the place being\nmoved over cannot exist simultaneously, since motion takes time;\nvision cannot see something that exists simultaneously with it (such\nas itself), since vision takes time too (MMK 3:2\u20133, see also\nGarfield 1995: 139\u2013139).\n\nSecondly, observing again that if the epistemic instruments are\nself-established they will be established independently of the objects\nknown, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues as follows. Assume that we wanted to\nchose those amongst all the different means of cognitive access to the\nworld that deliver accurate knowledge of the nature of the objects\nknown, that is, that qualify as epistemic instruments. We would select\nall those that have a specific internal quality. The possession of\nthis quality would then guarantee that its possessor delivered\naccurate information about the nature of the objects cognized. But how\nis the connection between the specific internal quality and the\ncorrect representation of the object justified? After all there are\nall sorts of properties our means of cognitive access to the world can\nhave, so how do we know that a specific one is a guide to accurate\nrepresentation?\n\nSuppose we are presented with a set of fancy mechanical devices and\nare asked to select the five best tin openers from these. No detailed\nstudy of the internal properties of each will allow us to accomplish\nthat task. We have to analyse each in relation to a tin and try to\ndetermine the way in which it might open it. Only then would we be\nable to conclude which particular properties of the mechanisms are\ncorrelated with good tin-opening abilities. In the same way we can\nonly regard an internal quality of a way of accessing the world as a\ncharacteristic of an epistemic instrument once we have assessed it in\nrelation to the objects cognized. Only then can we conclude that this\nparticular property really leads us to the knowledge of the nature of\nthe object, rather than doing something else. But in this case the\nestablishment of the epistemic instruments can no longer be regarded\nas self-establishment since it incorporates reference to other objects\n(namely the objects known) at an essential place.\n3.4.2 Do the epistemic instruments and objects establish each other?\n\nIf the argument for the self-establishment of the epistemic\ninstruments is not successful, the remaining option is to argue that\nthe instruments and objects mutually establish one another. Assume\nthat I see an apple on the table. The existence of the apple, the\nepistemic object, is established by the epistemic instrument which is\nperception. But we could equally argue the other way round: that the\nobject known establishes the epistemic instrument. This would invite\nthe immediate objection that we then need prior cognitive access to\nthe object known, and if we have this we must already have established\nthe epistemic instrument. We are therefore pointlessly establishing it\ntwice. But if we somehow gain this access without relying on the\nepistemic instruments the whole project of establishing these\ninstruments seems futile, since it is precisely the justification of\nour instruments used in gaining knowledge of the world that we have\nset out to scrutinize. We will therefore need a different\nargumentative strategy to argue for the mutual establishment of\nobjects known and epistemic instruments, and in particular for the\nestablishment of the latter by the former. One way of going about this\n(which does not commit us to the viciously circular mutual\nestablishment criticized by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna) is to argue that\nbecause the epistemic object is perceived, there must be something\nbringing about such a perception, and this is the epistemic\ninstrument. In this case the apple establishes the existence of the\nepistemic instrument by which it is known. An essential prerequisite\nfor this latter direction of establishment is of course success.\nBecause we successfully apprehend an apple our means of apprehension\nis regarded as an epistemic instrument. If we were susceptible to\nfrequent apple-hallucinations that disappeared once we tried to touch\nthem we would not regard perception as a reliable apple-detector, that\nis, as an epistemic instrument. But since we are generally successful\nin our cognitive interactions with the world and normally only\nperceive the existence of apples that are indeed there the very fact\nthat we successfully apprehend a world of outside objects serves as an\nargument for regarding the successful means of apprehension as\nepistemic instruments. An immediate difficulty with this procedure is\nthat we also need an epistemic instrument for establishing the success\nof our cognitive actions, that is to ascertain whether we really are\nperceiving the apple or just an apple-hallucination.\n\nNothing seems to rule out that some epistemic instrument first\ndeceives us about what we see, and later deceives us about the outcome\nof whatever procedure we use to establish whether the first cognition\nwas successful. But this need not rule out any attempts of mutually\nestablishing the epistemic instruments and objects if we do not use\nepistemically suspect procedures (which we know to have lead to\nunsuccessful cognitions in the past) to establish the success of our\ncognitive actions. A more worrying question is whether the mutual\nestablishment of instruments and objects \u2013 if successful \u2013\nactually delivers the account of epistemic instruments\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s opponent wants to defend. In order to see\nthis we have to note first that the notion of \u2018successful\ncognitive apprehension\u2019 referred to above cannot just be an act\nof cognition that leads to a successful action, as many of our\ncognitions (and many of the beliefs subsequently acquired) are never\nacted upon. We therefore also have to include coherence with other\ncognitions or beliefs as a criterion for the success of some epistemic\ninstruments as well. Our cognition of the apple on the table might\ntherefore be deemed successful if it either leads to a successful\naction (we reach out, grasp the apple, and eat it) or if it coheres\nwith other epistemic instruments (for example with my memory of buying\na bag of apples and putting them on the table). However, the\ndifficulty with employing coherence in this way is that we have to\nselect a certain set of cognitions or beliefs that we hold fixed, so\nthat we can then evaluate the status of other cognitions relative to\nthem. One problem now is of course how to assure the accuracy of this\nselected set: if they are not accurate themselves coherence with them\nhas very little argumentative weight.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s account of epistemology is supposed to\nfulfill a purpose both at the object- as well as at the meta-level. At\nthe object-level epistemic instruments and objects are just another\nset of central concepts that have to be investigated as entities\npotentially existing with svabh\u0101va. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\nargues that the various ways in which the epistemic instruments and\nobjects could be established are either not satisfactory or fail to\nshow that they exist with svabh\u0101va. At the meta-level\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of epistemology is supposed to\nprovide the theoretical background of his own account of emptiness. As\nthe theory of emptiness is something we are supposed to acquire\nknowledge of it is essential to get clear about the means by which we\nare supposed to do so, and indeed about what our epistemic object\nconsists of in this case. These two projects are inherently\ninterconnected. For according to the standard Ny\u0101ya theory of\nepistemology N\u0101g\u0101rjuna encountered, knowledge is acquired by\nusing a set of procedures (such as perception or inference) the nature\nof which it is to produce knowledge and which convey information about\na set of objective, mind-independent set of individuals that are the\nbearers of specific qualities. But a theory that thus presupposes the\nexistence of objects of knowledge with distinct natures which the\nmeans of knowledge could adequately represent could hardly be used as\na basis for knowing emptiness, for it presupposes exactly what the\ntheory of emptiness denies. A substantial part of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s epistemological discussion is therefore\ndedicated to a criticism of the standard Ny\u0101ya theory of\nknowledge. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna sets out to establish that nothing can\nbe regarded as intrinsically an epistemic instrument or object. The\ntwo have to be mutually established: the instrument establishes the\nobject by giving us cognitive access to it, our successful interaction\nwith the object establishes the instrument as a trustworthy route to\nthe object. Something will therefore be classified as an epistemic\ninstrument or object not because this is a reflection of its intrinsic\nnature, but because it is regarded as such once a reflective\nequilibrium has been reached. We use beliefs about the nature of the\nobject in order to test our hypotheses concerning the instruments of\nacquiring such beliefs, these hypotheses are then in turn used to\nassess our view of the nature of the object. Such mutual establishment\nof epistemic instruments and epistemic objects then also entails that\nneither of them can exist by svabh\u0101va.\n3.5 Language and truth\n\nLanguage is not a topic that is given much explicit discussion in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. This does not mean that such\nmatters were not important to him, but merely that his extant writings\ndo not contain an extended connected discussion of the impact of his\ntheory of emptiness on his view of language.\n\nNevertheless it is possible to extract some of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s views on this philosophically highly\ninteresting issue from remarks found at different places in his\nworks.\n\nMost importantly it is apparent that the Madhyamaka theory of\nemptiness is not compatible with a the idea of a \u2018ready-made\nworld\u2019, that is of a world that exists independently of human\ninterests and concerns and already shows a particular kind of\nstructuring that our structured language could then set out to\nreflect. If nothing exists with svabh\u0101va nothing in the\nworld could exist from its own side and nothing could bear a structure\nthat is intrinsic to it, rather than something ascribed to it from the\noutside. Moreover, the M\u0101dhyamika will reject the classic\ncorrespondence theory of truth, according to which the truth of a\nstatement is grounded in the identity of structure between a statement\nand the bit of the world it refers to. This also entails a rejection\nof the associated view of how language works, namely that our\nsentences manage to connect up with the world via a set of objectively\nexistent structural similarities. The main reason for this rejection\nis that the M\u0101dhyamika cannot find any sufficiently substantial\nrelation that would allow us to bind together world and word at the\nmost fundamental level. The most plausible candidate for linking words\nand their referents is the causal relation, for example by using it to\nconstruct a causal chain from an \u2018initial baptism\u2019 to our\npresent use of the term. But as we have seen, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has\nargued that the causal relation itself is conceptually constructed. If\ncausation cannot be regarded as a relation that functions objectively,\nindependent of the concepts we employ then it can hardly be regarded\nas a mind-independent way of grounding the relationship between\nlanguage and the world.\n\nAn alternative account which the M\u0101dhyamika might want to adopt\nis one which does not conceive of truth in terms of correspondence\nwith an exterior reality but rather in terms of assertability\nconditions. In this case a statement is regarded as true if conditions\nobtain that warrant our asserting the statement. What makes the\nstatement that water is wet true is not a structural correspondence\nbetween it and a state of affairs involving water, but that we have\nsomething that justifies us in making this statement. What this\njustification consists in depends on the further details of our theory\nof truth; it might be based on facts about empirical observation,\nabout coherence with other beliefs, about pragmatic success and so\nforth. This view of course implies that there could not be any truths\nthat are in principle beyond our ability to know them. This is because\nwe could never have a warrant for asserting such statements, and the\nexistence of such a warrant is precisely what we consider the truth of\nthe statements to consist in. Such statements would have to be\nregarded as lacking a truth-value. This kind of denial of\nverification-transcendent truths in turn agrees very well with\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s contextualist epistemology. For if nothing\nis intrinsically an epistemic instrument nothing can be intrinsically\nbeyond the grasp of such instruments either. As what constitutes an\nepistemic instrument is context-dependent, that a certain truth cannot\nbe accessed by some instrument is context-dependent too. There is no\ncontext-independent concept of knowledge we could use to form the idea\nof a truth that lies beyond all epistemic contexts.\n\nAccording to the Madhyamaka view of truth there can be no such thing\nas ultimate truth, a theory describing how things really are,\nindependent of our interests and conceptual resources employed in\ndescribing it. All one is left with is conventional truth, truth which\nconsists in agreement with commonly accepted practices and\nconventions. These are the truths that are arrived at when viewing the\nworld through our linguistically formed conceptual framework. But we\nshould be wary of denigrating these conventions as a distorting device\nthat incorporates our specific interests and concerns. The very notion\nof \u2018distortion\u2019 presupposes that there is a world\nuntainted by conceptuality out there (even if our minds can never\nreach it) that is twisted and bent to fit our cognitive grasp. But the\nvery notion of such a \u2018way things really are\u2019 is argued by\nthe M\u0101dhyamika to be incoherent. There is no way of investigating\nthe world apart from our linguistic and conceptual practices, if only\nbecause these practices generate the notion of the \u2018world\u2019\nand of the \u2018objects\u2019 in it in the first place. To speak of\nconventional reality as distorted is therefore highly misleading,\nunless all we want to say is that our way of investigating the world\nis inextricably bound up with the linguistic and conceptual framework\nwe happen to employ.\n\nThere are two worries one might have about the rejection of the notion\nof an ultimate truth. First of all one might think that progress in\nhuman inquiry makes it necessary that we question what we now believe\nto be truths and perhaps replace them with other beliefs. Even a\ncursory acquaintance with the history of science will show that we are\nwhere we are now only through a persistent process of replacing\nbeliefs we once held to be true, but no longer hold to be true. But it\nseems hard to explain what our justification for this is if it is not\ntrying to bring our beliefs into greater accordance with the way\nthings are. All we ever seem to be dealing with according to the\nMadhyamaka view is a purely immanent notion of truth where the only\nkind of truth we have access to is a reflection of conventional human\npractices and agreements. In response to this the M\u0101dhyamika\nmight want to make the point that it is at least sometimes\nadvantageous to treat truths as if they had a more than\nconventional grounding, that is as if they were not just the\nproduct of agreement with commonly accepted practices and conventions.\nThis is precisely because such practices need improvement from time to\ntime, and since a spirit of inquiry is facilitated better by the idea\nthat there is a mind-independent truth waiting to be discovered. The\nM\u0101dhyamika could thus argue that for pragmatic reasons we should\nconceive of truths as reflections of an objective, external reality\neven though we do not think that there are any such truths in fact. We\nmight object at this point that if the notion of the existence of at\nleast some verification-transcendent truths is pragmatically useful,\nwhoever believes in truth as warranted assertability then has to\nbelieve that some truths are not conventional, since asserting this is\nnow supported by a warrant. But this will not just turn the\nanti-realist into a realist against his will, since his embracing of\nnon-conventional truths is dictated by purely practical concerns: we\nare considerably better off if we build our inquiries on the\nconvenient fiction of non-conventional truths. But they remain just\nthat, namely convenient fictions; the anti-realist does not think, as\nthe realist does, that the existence of such truths is in any way\ngrounded by the way the world is independent of our interests and\nconcerns.\n\nAnother worry with the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s rejection of an\nultimate truth is that emptiness cannot then be regarded as the\nultimate truth either. But surely, one will argue, for the\nM\u0101dhyamika emptiness is the end-product of the correct analysis\nof phenomena, and thereby indicative of the way things really are.\nHowever, emptiness is not to be understood as a description of reality\nas it is independent of human conceptual conventions, as its main\npurpose it to combat the wrong ascription of svabh\u0101va to\nthings. The absence of svabh\u0101va or emptiness is nothing\nphenomena have within themselves, but only something which is\nprojected onto them from the outside in an attempt to rectify a\nmistaken cognition. Therefore the theory of emptiness is not to be\nregarded as an ultimately true theory either. Such a theory would\ndescribe things as they are independent of human interests and\nconcerns. But the theory of emptiness is intricately bound up with\nsuch interests and concerns: if there were no human minds who\nmistakenly read the existence of svabh\u0101va into phenomena\nwhich lack it there would be no point in having a theory to correct\nthis. It is only due to our erroneous view of things that the theory\nof emptiness is required as a corrective.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe preceding discussion has discussed some of the main topics\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna addresses in order to refute their existence by\nsvabh\u0101va: causation, change, the self, knowledge,\nlanguage, and truth. This is not a comprehensive exposition of the\nMadhyamaka view, however, not just because there are aspects of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought we have not mentioned here (such\nhas his discussion of time and his account of ethics), but because\nMadhyamaka thought regards itself as a philosophical antidote against\nsuperimpositions of svabh\u0101va wherever they arise. It is\ntherefore by necessity more comprehensive than the arguments found in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. They provide examples of\nargumentative procedures and discussions of putative examples of\nsvabh\u0101va prominent amongst N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nopponents. But the Madhyamaka project consists not just in the\nexplanation and defense of these arguments (even though most of the\npositions N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues against are of more than\nhistorical importance) but has to be continued in the debate with the\ndefenders of svabh\u0101va in the contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion. It is apparent that Madhyamaka philosophy is opposed to\nthe brand of realism currently found in much of contemporary analytic\nphilosophy (Michael Devitt (1997: 41) characterizes this succinctly as\nthe claim that \u2018most current common-sense and scientific\nphysical existence statements are objectively and mind-independently\n(deflationary) true\u2019). Things that exist in a mind-independent\nmanner exist with svabh\u0101va, even though they might be\ndependent in all other kinds of ways. (Even if everything out there\ndepended on every other thing, as long as the entire network of\ndependence-relations was mind-independent it would exist with\nsvabh\u0101va). Of course the M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s talk of\n\u201cmind-dependence\u201d does not refer to dependence on any\nindividual mind, as a solipsist would assume, but to collective\ndependence on all the minds there are. This view raises a variety of\ninteresting questions that Madhyamaka philosophy has to address.\n\nFirst of all there is the question of how to make sense of objects\nlike Mt Everest depending on all our minds collectively. It is clear\nhow we could say something like this about things existing merely by\nthe force of convention, such as some objects traded on the stock\nmarket. But how could something like a mountain be merely\nconventionally existent?\n\nSecondly, given the Madhyamaka rejection of a correspondence-theoretic\naccount of truth, how can it come up with a theory of meaning and\ntruth that is not committed to some sort of structural isomorphism\nbetween word and world but still gives us a robust account of what\ndistinguishes true from false sentences?\n\nThirdly, if it is not facts out there that settle what is true how can\nthe M\u0101dhyamika avoid the unacceptable relativistic conclusion\nthat we cannot criticize epistemic or ethical practices which differ\nfrom ours?\n\nFourthly, how can we make sense of an ontology without foundations in\nwhich there are no substantially existent objects on which everything\nelse depends? (For an interesting formal model of such an ontology see\nPriest 2009, 2014. This question has obvious systematics connections\nwith the current discussion of\n grounding.)\n\nMany aspects of these questions have been addressed in vast body of\ncommentarial literature that was written in the nearly two millennia\nsince N\u0101g\u0101rjuna composed his key philosophical works. Other\nstill remain to be addressed. (For some development of contemporary\nMadhyamaka ideas in relation to contemporary Western philosophy see\nGarfield 2015, Westerhoff 2020.) One of these is the question to which\nextent Madhyamaka thought is essentially linked to Buddhism. This is a\nquestion that has attracted more interest recently especially from\nresearchers that study Madhyamaka primarily as a philosophical, rather\nthan as a religious tradition. (For some interesting reflections on\nmatter this see McGuire 2017). If we consider the lively status of\nMadhyamaka studies today it seems evident that the questions\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna asked and the system of philosophy he founded in\nthe second century remain very much alive in the twenty-first.",
