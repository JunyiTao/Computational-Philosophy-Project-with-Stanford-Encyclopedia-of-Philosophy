    "main_text": "\n\n\nKum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, who likely flourished around 660\nce, was a proponent of the orthodox\nBrahmanical school of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. Among\nthe most influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy, he\nmade significant contributions regarding the full range of issues that\nfollow from that school\u2019s constitutive concern with Vedic authority\nand exegesis; virtually all Indian philosophers writing subsequent to\nhim\u2014and particularly Buddhist philosophers, whose positions were\nmost completely antithetical to his\u2014found it necessary to reckon\nespecially with his work in epistemology and philosophy of\nlanguage. Among the areas in which he exercised lasting influence are\nhermeneutics, poetics, jurisprudence, and (arguably) historiography.\nChief among the doctrines that have occasioned philosophical\ninterest in him is that of svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya\u2014\u201cintrinsic\nreliability,\u201d which might be understood as immediate justification\u2014which\nsurely represents Kum\u0101rilas most significant epistemological\ncontribution; occasionally dismissed as fundamentalist in spirit, this\nhas come to be appreciated (sometimes in light of the \u201creformed\nepistemology\u201d advanced by contemporary thinkers such as William\nAlston and Nicholas Wolterstorff) as a cogent working-out of the kinds\nof commonsensical epistemic intuitions characteristic of Thomas\nReid. Together with a robust realism about linguistic universals and\nthe peculiarly M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka conviction that the Vedic\ntexts are eternal, this epistemology was effectively deployed by\nKum\u0101rila to show that a commitment to the uniquely authoritative\nstatus of the Vedas (and to the ritual practices enjoined thereby) was\nrationally held.\n",
