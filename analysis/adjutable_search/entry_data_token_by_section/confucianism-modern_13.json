    "main_text": "Political Thought\n5. Political Thought\n\nPolitical thought was and remains a critical area in modern\nConfucianism. Mou, Tang, and Xu all responded to the failure of\ninitial efforts toward democracy in China with arguments for why\ndemocracy was not only compatible with Confucianism, but a necessary\nevolution for it (Elstein 2014; Fr\u00f6hlich 2017). (Xiong had less\nto say about politics (Van den Stock 2016: 222\u201325).) Strong\nopposition to Communism led them to leave China, but they were also\ndisappointed by the Nationalist dictatorship on Taiwan.\n\nTheir support of a Confucian justification for democracy was a way of\nresponding to three alternative views: two critical of Confucianism\nand one supportive of Confucianism but critical of democracy. The\nfirst two were Chinese Communism and liberalism. The Communist\ninsistence on materialism and reduction of morality to class interest\nwas unacceptable to all three as it amounted to a rejection of the\nmoral self. Liberals in Taiwan supported democracy but insisted\nChinese culture was an obstacle to it that had to be swept away.\nModern Confucians agreed with democracy as an end, but the means could\nnot be giving up Chinese culture. The last, anti-democratic group was\nthe Nationalist government and its supporters in Taiwan. They\nsupported traditional culture, including Confucianism, but used it,\nalong with the need to fight Communism, to justify their one-party\nrule (Huang 2018 [2019: 94\u201395]). A fourth view opposed to\ndemocracy, Confucian meritocracy (Bai 2020; Bell 2015; Jiang 2012),\ndid not exist at the time, but they would have rejected it, too. The\nmodern Confucianism position contains these common elements: due to\nhistorical limitations earlier Confucian thinkers had not advocated\ndemocracy, Confucianism is not only not antithetical to democracy but\nin reality democracy is the way to realize Confucian ideals, and\ndemocracy in fact needs Confucianism or something like it to be\nstable.\n",
