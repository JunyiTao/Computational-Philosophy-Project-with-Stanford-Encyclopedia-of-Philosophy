    "main_text": "Foundations of Mathematics || Type-theoretic vs. Set-theoretic Foundations\n5.2 Type-theoretic vs. Set-theoretic Foundations\n\nIn 1940 Church turned away from a type-free approach and published a\nversion of STT that incorporated \u03bb-abstraction (see\n supplement D).\n Although Church had developed what became the most useful and famous\nversion of STT (1940), he thought that it was not enough to meet\ncondition (1), since he thought that STT when augmented with a\nsemantical predicate was vulnerable to the semantical paradoxes such\nas the Epimenides and Grelling\u2019s paradox (cf.\n section 4\n above). To avoid these he thought it necessary to appeal to RTT (with\nreducibility).\n\nRegarding condition (2), STT with axioms of infinity and choice\npermits the full development of classical number theory and analysis.\nChurch (1959 [BE: 493]) notes that STT with an axiom of infinity and\nZermelo set theory (Z) are of \u201ccomparable\u201d provability\nstrength but that Z is slightly stronger. (Indeed, the first detailed\nproof that Z is stronger than STT with infinity is given in a thesis\nwritten under Church\u2019s supervision by Kemeny (1949). It is now\nknown that STT with an axiom of infinity is equi-consistent with and\nhas as much provability strength as bounded Zermelo set\ntheory (see Farmer 2008 and the citations therein). Moreover,\nChurch\u2019s STT has turned out to be an important tool in the\ninvestigation of automated reasoning and proof verification in\ncomputer science. The typed system with \u03bb is particularly well\nsuited for the use and development of programming languages and\nparadigms (such as Haskell and Functional Programming [Hudak 1989]).\nThus, Church succeeded in providing a type theoretical alternative to\nset theory as a foundation for mathematics. (It\u2019s also worth\nmentioning that through his work on finite automata, Church\ncontributed in yet another fundamental way to computer science [1960,\n1962a].)\n\nHowever, for the most part, at this point, Church focused on the\ndevelopment of intensional logic in the form of LSD (see\n \u00a73)\n and on condition (1)\u2014viz. the problem of semantical\nparadox. In his 1976, his aim is clearly to communicate the resolution\nvia RTT of the semantical paradoxes:\n\n\nTo avoid impredicativity the essential restriction is that\nquantification over any domain (type) must not be allowed to add new\nmembers to the domain, as it is held that adding new members changes\nthe meaning of quantification over the domain in such a way that a\nvicious circle results. (1976 [BE: 794]).\n\n\nGiven the rest of 1976, it is natural to view Church as defending\nRussell\u2019s diagnosis of the paradoxes. (This contrasts with\nChurch\u2019s early view that RTT embodies an \u201cad hoc\u201d\nresolution; see the quotes at the beginning of this section.)\nChurch\u2019s final position seems to have been, then, that both RTT\nand Russell\u2019s rationale for it are correct.\n\nAs for the axioms of reducibility, Church\u2019s view was that the\naxioms only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions and that\nintensional notions remain unaffected: \u201cThus the\nrejection of impredicative definition is annulled in extensional but\nnot in intensional matters\u201d. In this way, RTT with the axioms of\nreducibility permits the full development of classical number theory\nand analysis and blocks the semantical paradoxes. This is a view\nshared by Kripke (2011b) and Myhill (1979).\n\nChurch\u2019s published remarks on set theory are scattered,\nrelatively brief and stop short of full endorsement. However, his\noverall attitude towards set theory was accepting and conciliatory,\nalthough he was skeptical of some of its axioms, including separation\nand choice. His doctoral dissertation (under Veblen) was on\n\u201cAlternatives to Zermelo\u2019s Assumption\u201d\n(1927)\u2014namely, the axiom of choice. He viewed Zermelo\u2019s\naxiomatization of set theory as \u201ctransferring\u201d the\nconcepts of class and class membership from the \u201c(unformalized)\nlogical level\u201d to the \u201c(formalized) mathematical\nlevel\u201d, but viewed the improvements due to von Neumann, Fraenkel\nand Skolem as bringing it continually closer to (formalized) logic, so\nthat\n\n\nit is now possible to formulate the theory as a system of symbolic\nlogic in the same sense as the system of Principia. (1939b\n[BE: 156])\n\n\nThese improvements brought with them an emphasis on formalization\n(such as Skolem\u2019s isolation of first order logic) and that was\nfor Church a sign that logic was being done; although he no doubt\nmodified his view as the distinction between logic and proper theory\nbecame pronounced. Later on, Church himself contributed again to set\ntheory. His paper on set theory with a universal set shows great\ningenuity in the analysis of a route to a consistent set theory\n(consistent relative to ZF) with a universal set (1974c). But he did\nnot think that set theory could handle intensional notions, despite\nthe success of set theoretic model theory for modal logic. For a\ntreatment of intensional notions he continued to look to RTT.\n",
