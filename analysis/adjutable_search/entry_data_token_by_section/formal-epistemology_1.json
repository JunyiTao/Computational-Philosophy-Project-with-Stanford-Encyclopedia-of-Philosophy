    "main_text": "First Case Study: Confirming Scientific Theories || The Deductive Approach\n1.1 The Deductive Approach\n\nConsider a hypothesis like All electrons have negative\ncharge, which in first-order logic is rendered \\(\\forall x (Ex\n\\supset Nx)\\). Having identified some object \\(a\\) as an electron,\nthis hypothesis deductively entails a prediction, \\(Na\\), that \\(a\\)\nhas negative charge:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\forall x (Ex \\supset Nx)\\\\ Ea\\\\ \\hline Na\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nIf we test this prediction and observe that, indeed, \\(Na\\), this\nwould seem to support the hypothesis.\n\nScientific hypothesis-testing thus appears to work something like\n\u201cdeduction in reverse\u201d (Goodman 1954). If we swap the\nhypothesis and the predicted datum in the above deduction, we get an\nexample of confirmation:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{l} Ea\\\\ Na\\\\ \\overline{\\overline{\\forall x (Ex\n\\supset Nx)}} \\end{array} \\]\n\nHere the double-line represents non-deductive inference. The inference\nis very weak in this case, since the hypothesis has only been verified\nin one instance, \\(a\\). But as we add further instances \\(b\\), \\(c\\),\netc., it becomes stronger (provided we discover no counter-instances,\nof course).\n\nThese observations suggest a proposal due to Nicod (1930) and famously\nexamined by Hempel (1945):\n\nNicod\u2019s Criterion\n\nA universal generalization is confirmed by its positive instances (as\nlong as no counter-instances are discovered): \\(\\forall x(Fx \\supset\nGx)\\) is confirmed by \\(Fa \\wedge Ga\\), by \\(Fb \\wedge Gb\\), etc.\n\nThe general idea is that hypotheses are confirmed when their\npredictions are borne out. To capture this idea formally in deductive\nlogic, we\u2019re equating prediction with logical entailment. When\nan object is \\(F\\), the hypothesis \\(\\forall x(Fx \\supset Gx)\\)\nentails/predicts that the object is \\(G\\). So any discovery of an\nobject that is both \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) confirms the hypothesis.\n\nOne classic challenge for Nicod\u2019s criterion is the notorious\nraven paradox. Suppose we want to test the hypothesis that\nall ravens are black, which we formalize \\(\\forall x(Rx \\supset Bx)\\).\nThat\u2019s logically equivalent to \\(\\forall x(\\neg Bx \\supset \\neg\nRx)\\), by contraposition. And Nicod\u2019s Criterion says this latter\nhypothesis is confirmed by the discovery of any object that is not\nblack and not a raven\u2014a red shirt, for example, or a pair of\nblue underpants (Hempel 1937, 1945). But walking the halls of my\ndepartment noting non-black non-ravens hardly seems a reasonable way\nto verify that all ravens are black. How can \u201cindoor\nornithology\u201d (Goodman 1954) be good science?!\n\nA second, more general challenge for the prediction-as-deduction\napproach is posed by statistical hypotheses. Suppose we want to test\nthe theory that only 50% of ravens are black. This hypothesis entails\nnothing about the color of an individual raven; it might be one of the\nblack ones, it might not. In fact, even a very large survey of ravens,\nall of which turn out to be black, does not contradict this\nhypothesis. It\u2019s always possible that the 50% of ravens that\naren\u2019t black weren\u2019t caught up in the survey. (Maybe\nnon-black ravens are exceptionally skilled at evasion.)\n\nThis challenge suggests some important lessons. First, we need a laxer\nnotion of prediction than deductive entailment. The 50% hypothesis may\nnot entail that a large survey of ravens will have some\nnon-black ravens, but it does suggest this prediction pretty strongly.\nSecond, as a sort of corollary, confirmation is quantitative: it comes\nin degrees. A single, black raven doesn\u2019t do much to support the\nhypothesis that 50% of ravens are black, but a large sample of roughly\nhalf black, half white ravens would. Third and finally, degrees of\nconfirmation should be understood in terms of probability. The 50%\nhypothesis doesn\u2019t make it very probable that a single raven\nwill be black, but it makes it highly probable that a much larger\ncollection will be roughly half black, half non-black. And the\nall-black hypothesis predicts that any sample of ravens will be\nentirely black with \\(100\\)% probability.\n\nA quantitative approach also promises to help resolve the raven\nparadox. The most popular resolution says that observing a red shirt\ndoes confirm that all ravens are black, just by a very minuscule\namount. The raven paradox is thus an illusion: we mistake a minuscule\namount of confirmation for none at all (Hosiasson-Lindenbaum 1940).\nBut to make this response convincing, we need a proper, quantitative\ntheory of confirmation that explains how a red shirt could be relevant\nto a hypothesis about ravens, but only just slightly relevant.\n",
