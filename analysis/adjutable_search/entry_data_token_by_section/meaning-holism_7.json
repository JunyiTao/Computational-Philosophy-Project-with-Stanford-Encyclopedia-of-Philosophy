Conclusion\n\nMeaning holism thus comes with a number of costs (particularly\nrelating to instability and objectivity), and while there are a\nvariety of strategies available to make these costs more bearable, no\nsingle approach to doing so seems problem-free. That said, these\nstrategies can be complementary, and it may be the case that a\ncombination of them can do the work in a way that no single one of\nthem would be able to. In any case, being completely problem free is a\nvery high bar to set for a philosophical theory, and meaning holists\nare free to argue not only that the benefits that come with their view\noutweigh the costs, but also that the atomistic and molecularist\ntheories face equally severe problems of their own.\n",
