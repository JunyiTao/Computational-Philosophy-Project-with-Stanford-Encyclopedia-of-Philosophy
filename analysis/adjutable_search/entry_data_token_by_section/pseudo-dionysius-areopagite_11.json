Afterlife: Significance and Influence\n\nIn sum, Dionysius represents the instantaneous resonances, possible in\nunusual circumstances, between forms of thought and practice that may\nat first sight appear entirely divergent. He is therefore in some\nrespects a dangerous thinker, yet at the same time a forger of new\npossibilities:\n\nPartly because as a Christian he cannot accept at face value the\nNeoplatonic view of the One as excluding trinity, Dionysius forges a\nnew way of thinking about God by linking beyond-beingness with\nunrestricted being and by combining in God\u2019s transcendent love\nboth power and a kind of hyperessential, erotic vulnerability. In the\nfirst instance, he provides a fruitful link between philosophies based\nupon a transcendent principle beyond being (for example, the Good) and\nphilosophies of being, and in the second instance he suggests a loving\nGod whom, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, it makes sense to address\nin prayer. At the same time, however, this standpoint leaves room,\nfrom a modern viewpoint particularly, for interreligious dialogue\nsince, while it is certainly a Christian view, it also remains\nradically open-ended.\nHe also succeeds in transposing Pagan Neoplatonism into a complete\nChristian theology, from the Trinity and the angelic world through the\nincarnation and redemption to the sacramental life and orders of the\nChurch, and extending to the old Law, and provides not only a symbolic\nand mystical explanation, but a profound reconsideration of the\nimportance of liturgical practice as a response to both the hidden and\nthe more manifest divine workings of grace in scripture, ritual,\nmorality, law and even material things.\nTogether with scripture, the Fathers, and the entire ancient\ntradition, he provides a framework and a vocabulary for ordinary\nspirituality as well as mystical practice, especially for describing\nthe approach of the soul through inactivity of all knowledge to a\nstate of unification with God \u201cin the brilliant darkness of a\nhidden silence\u201d (MT 1); and his complex negative\ntheology transmits a theory of signification that in many ways is so\nself-subversive and necessarily deceptive at each level (both\nkataphatic and apophatic) that for future\ngenerations after his own time it will hardly be possible to translate\nhis works without also writing commentaries upon them.\nIn addition, Dionysius\u2019 view of the visible created universe\nwas to have a marked influence for two reasons, first, because his\nvivid sense of the aesthetic and imaginative beauty of the sensible\nuniverse, pervaded from the perspective of divine beauty by\ninterrelatedness and harmony (see esp. DN 7), came to inspire\nAbbot Suger\u2019s program for a new architecture, the Gothic\ncathedral, and, second, because Dionysius also took account of\nugliness, defect, resistance, and evil by his theory of evil as\nprivation and non-being, a theory adopted from Plotinus (with\nsignificant changes) and Proclus and destined to have further\ninfluence upon Aquinas in medieval times and Ficino in the\nRenaissance.\n\n\nFor the long commentary tradition, from John of Scythopolis to Aquinas\nand Ficino, see bibliography 2 below. St. Gregory the Great refers to\nDionysius in his own commentary on the angels and probably had the\ncomplete works at Rome. But the study of Dionysius did not take off in\nthe Latin West until the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer sent\na copy of the Dionysian corpus as a gift to the Frankish king Louis\nthe Pious in 827. This copy served as the source of the first\ntranslations of Dionysius into Latin. The first translation, made\naround 838 by Hilduin, abbot of a monastery near Paris (who identified\nDionysius not only as St. Dionysius the Areopagite but also as the\nfirst bishop of Paris), was so unintelligible that Charles II asked\nthe great Irish philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena, to make a new\ntranslation that he completed in 862 and that was subsequently revised\nwith clarifications in 875. The influence of Dionysius is profound in\nEriugena\u2019s own thought as it would be later in the Franciscan\ntradition (especially Grosseteste and Bonaventure) and also to a\nlesser extent in the Dominican (both Albert and Aquinas wrote\ncommentaries). In fact, the abiding-procession-return triad may be\nsaid to form the essential structure of Aquinas\u2019 unfinished\nmasterpiece, the Summa Theologica. The influence of\nDionysius\u2019 ideas pervades not only the Italian and English\nRenaissance, but also the Rhineland mystical writers, such as Meister\nEckhart (d. 1327), Tauler (d. 1361), Ruysbroeck (d. 1381), Gerson (d.\n1429), and later Denis the Carthusian (d. 1471) and Nicholas of Cusa\n(d. 1464) (whose work On Learned Ignorance owes a debt to\nDionysius\u2019 agnosia or unknowingness, as does also the\nanonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing) and the great\nSpanish mystics, for example, St. John of the Cross (d. 1591). In the\nGreek East, Dionysius\u2019 On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\ninspired a series of liturgical commentaries, beginning with the\nMystagogy of Maximus the Confessor (d. 662) and continuing\nwith works by Germanus of Constantinople (d. 733) and Nicholas\nCabasilas (d. 1390). Dionysius played a major role in the Palamite\ncontroversy of the 14th century, cited both by Gregory Palamas (d.\n1359) and by his opponents. In the modern world, Dionysius has\nreceived less attention, though he is of some importance for 19th\ncentury German Idealist thought and also to a lesser extent for\nEnglish and American Romanticism. In the so-called\n\u201cpostmodern\u201d world, however, two thinkers who have written\nabout Dionysius with great insight are Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques\nDerrida. Derrida, in particular, has been one of the few contemporary\nphilosophical thinkers, if not the only one, to realize the importance\nof Dionysius in relation to deconstruction (a term he does not use\nhimself) and to explore the complex nature of prayer, address, and\ndenial in the context of the necessarily deceptive and open-ended\npossibilities of negative theology.\n",
