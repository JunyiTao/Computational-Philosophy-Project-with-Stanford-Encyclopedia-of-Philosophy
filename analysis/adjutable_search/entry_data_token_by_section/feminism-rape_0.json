Common Themes and the Liberal-to-Radical Continuum\n\nVirtually all feminist thinking about rape shares several underlying\nthemes. First among these is feminists\u2019 emphasis on\n\u201cbreaking the silence\u201d around rape. Feminist thought and\nactivism have challenged the myth that rape is rare and exceptional,\nshowing that it is in fact a common experience in the lives of girls\nand women. In recent decades, this awareness emerged in feminist\n\u201cspeakouts\u201d and consciousness-raising groups, where women\nshared their experiences of rape and other forms of abuse. It has now\nbeen amply confirmed by research: according to one study of over\n16,000 Americans, 18.3% of women report having been victims of rape or\nattempted rape at some time in their lives (Black et al., 2011). Of\nthese women, 42.2% were under age eighteen when they were first raped;\nan earlier study showed that these women were twice as likely to\nreport having been raped as adults (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).\nIndeed, many women suffer multiple rapes in their lives: in the same\nearlier study, among those who reported having been raped in the past\nyear, the average number of rapes per woman during that time period\nwas 2.9.\n\nAn accurate estimate of rape\u2019s frequency requires a clear\nunderstanding of rape itself and of the varied circumstances in which\nit occurs. Often contributing to the underestimation of rape\u2019s\nfrequency is a narrow and stereotypical conception of what rape is:\nfor instance, the image of a stranger jumping out from behind the\nbushes, brandishing a weapon at a woman he has never seen before.\nWhile such rapes do occur, the great majority of rapes are committed\nby a man or men known to the victim: dates, relatives, friends,\nbosses, husbands, neighbors, co-workers, and more. (For this reason,\nagain contrary to stereotype, most rapes are intraracial.) In the\nstudy of over 16,000 Americans mentioned above, 51.1% of female\nvictims were raped by an intimate partner, and 40.8% by an\nacquaintance (Black et al., 2011). Remarkably few assailants are\npunished: with estimated U.S. state conviction rates of two to nine\npercent of total rapes (Kim 2012, 264), \u201cninety-four to\nninety-eight percent of total rapists and approximately eighty-four\npercent of reported rapists go free\u201d (Kim 2012, 272).\n\nPerhaps the most basic challenge that feminists have posed to\ntraditional views of rape lies in the recognition of rape as a crime\nagainst the victim herself. For much of recorded history women were\nthe property of men, with their value as property measured largely by\ntheir sexual \u201cpurity.\u201d In this context, rape was regarded\nas a property crime against a woman\u2019s husband or father\n(Burgess-Jackson 1996, 44-49). A raped woman or girl was less valuable\nas property, and penalties for rape often involved fines or other\ncompensation paid to her husband or father (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 68).\nThe marital rape exemption in law, which survived in the U.S. into the\n1990\u2019s, is clearly a remnant of this approach, assuming as it\ndoes that no crime is committed when a man forces intercourse upon his\nwife, since she is his own property; the property status of enslaved\nAfrican-American women was also thought to entitle their owners to the\nwomen\u2019s unrestricted sexual use. A further corollary of this\nview was that women who were not the private property of any\nindividual man\u2014for instance, prostitutes\u2014were unrapeable,\nor at least that no one important was harmed by their rape (Dworkin\n1997, 196\u2013202, Burgess-Jackson 1996, 46-47, 69). Given this\nentrenched historical and cultural legacy, feminists\u2019\nredefinition of \u2018rape\u2019 as a crime against the woman\nherself is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nSadly, the rate of rape reporting remains low; studies using random\nsample surveys of large numbers of women find reporting rates ranging\nfrom 16% to 36% (Anderson 2003, 78). Rates of conviction, too, remain\nsubstantially lower than for other violent crimes; some studies\nestimate a conviction rate of 5% (Caringella 2008) in the U.S.\nFeminists\u2019 recognition of the severity and pervasiveness of\nrape\u2019s harms, and of how infrequently victims receive justice,\nhas inspired decades of activism for social and legal change.\nFeminists in many U.S. states have succeeded not only in changing\nlegal definitions of rape (see below), but also in ending many\ndamaging and sexist practices in rape trials. For instance,\n\u201crape shield\u201d laws now restrict the admissibility of\nevidence about a victim\u2019s sexual history, and most jurisdictions\nhave eliminated the \u201cprompt reporting\u201d requirement, the\ncorroboration requirement, and the reciting of the traditional\n\u201ccautionary rule\u201d (that rape is a charge easy to make and\nhard to disprove). All of these practices reflect sexist and false\nassumptions\u2014for instance, that rape only happens (or only\nmatters when it happens) to sexually \u201cpure\u201d or\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d women, and that women are likely to lie about\nhaving been raped\u2014while increasing the trauma of rape trials for\nvictims and decreasing the likelihood of convictions. In addition to\npressing for changes in law and in police and prosecutorial practices,\nfeminists have founded and staffed rape crisis centers and hotlines to\nsupport victims, whether or not they choose to pursue charges against\ntheir attackers.\n\nFeminist views of rape can be understood as arrayed on a continuum\nfrom liberal to radical. Liberal views tend to regard rape as a\ngender-neutral assault on individual autonomy, likening it to other\nforms of assault and/or illegitimate appropriation, and focusing\nprimarily on the harm that rape does to individual victims. More\nradical views, in contrast, contend that rape must be recognized and\nunderstood as an important pillar of patriarchy. Johnson defines\npatriarchy as a social system in which men disproportionately occupy\npositions of power and authority, central norms and values are\nassociated with manhood and masculinity (which in turn are defined in\nterms of dominance and control), and men are the primary focus of\nattention in most cultural spaces (2005, 4-15). Radical feminists see\nrape as arising from patriarchal constructions of gender and sexuality\nwithin the context of broader systems of male power, and emphasize the\nharm that rape does to women as a group.\n\nIn addition, radical feminist approaches to rape often share one or\nmore of the following three features. First, they regard the\ndeprivation of women\u2019s bodily sovereignty\u2014in particular,\nmale control over the sexual and reproductive uses of women\u2019s\nbodies\u2014as a central defining element of patriarchy (Whisnant\n2007). As a result, they analyze rape as one of multiple forms of\nmen\u2019s sexual violence and exploitation, looking at their\ninterconnections and how they work in concert to maintain and\nreinforce women\u2019s oppression. Second, they expand the definition\nof \u2018rape\u2019 to encompass more than just overt physical force\nand violence (or the explicit threat thereof). Recognizing the ways in\nwhich broad patterns of male power systematically compromise\nwomen\u2019s bodily and sexual freedom, and challenging the equation\nof female submission with meaningful consent, they tend to see a kind\nof continuum (rather than a bright dividing line) between rape and\nmuch \u201cnormal\u201d heterosexual activity. Third, the focus on\ngroup-based oppression has also led many radical feminist thinkers to\nexamine the role of rape itself, and of ideologies about rape, in\ncreating and reproducing not only patriarchy but multiple systems of\ndomination, including racism and colonialism.\n",
