    "main_text": "Robert Boyle || The \u201cdispositive sense\u201d of having a sensible quality\n4.2 The \u201cdispositive sense\u201d of having a sensible quality\n\nSensible qualities pose a particular problem, one that is said to be\nthe \u201cchiefest difficulty\u201d for CT: \u201cit seems evident\nthat [colors, odors, and the like] have an absolute being\nirrelative to us\u201d (OFQ [1991: 32]). Two reasons are given:\n\nsnow would be white and a glowing coal would be hot if there were\nno sentient beings and\nthe heat of the coal would still melt ice and warm wax if sentient\nbeings were taken away.\n\n\nBoyle does not deny that the objection has some basis in fact but\ncontends it is consistent with CT (OFQ [1991: 32\u201337]). That is,\nthe absolute, non-relational, nature of colors, etc. seems evident for\nmisguided reasons that Boyle traces to Suarezian metaphysical\nassumptions. With regard to (b), his long response makes the point\nthat it is not heat but the insensible corpuscular constitutions of\nbodies that are hot that have the power to melt ice according to CT.\nThe response to (a) is a matter of controversy. It specifies a\n\u201cfavorable sense\u201d in which it can be said that bodies\nwould have sensible qualities if there were no sentient beings; but,\nBoyle contends, it does not suffice to establish that SQs are\nabsolute.\n\nAs Boyle explains it, the dispositive sense is conveyed by this: If\nthere were no perceivers, snow, which is actually cold, would in\nvirtue of its corpuscular constitution, be such that if it were\napplied to the tactual sensory organs of an animal, it would produce\n\u201csuch a quality (sic)\u201d, whereas a body, which does not\nactually have a SQ, would not produce such a quality. This is to be\n\u201cdispositively\u201d cold, or \u201cfit\u201d to be cold, but\nactually to be endowed only with certain MAs (OFQ [1991: 31]). Why\nwould the lack of competent perceivers prevent snow\u2019s being cold\ngiven that snow need not be perceived in order to be cold?\n\nAnstey (2000: 103) takes this to be a retreat from the relational\ntheory. Curley (1972: 448\u201350) finds Boyle ambiguous and\nmistaken. Stewart (1991: xiv) holds that instability in Boyle\u2019s\nuse of terms precludes a definitive interpretation. However, Kaufman\n(2006) argues that the dispositive sense is consistent with the\nrelational theory and as Boyle says, part of his defense of it. As\nKaufman sees it, the theory of qualities is a consequence of\nBoyle\u2019s method in natural philosophy, especially his commitment\nto reasoning from nothing but observational data and antipathy to\na priori argumentation. It is possible here to give only a\nrough sketch of two important points of this interesting, detailed,\nand complicated interpretation.\n\nFirst, Kaufman (2006: 175\u201385) notes that if a body that has MAs\nin virtue of which it is dispositively cold is not actually cold, then\nit might seem that the relational account of qualities is expendable.\nOne reason is that from the fact that a body is dispositively cold and\nthe tenets of any adequate mechanist theory, we can predict and\nexplain what the body would do if it were applied to the tactual organ\nof a perceiver; so it might seem that CT can do without relational\nqualities. According to Kaufman, this is not right. This is said to be\nbecause by Boyle\u2019s empiricist lights, we have no way of knowing\nwhat would happen if snow and the right sort of perceiver were to come\ntogether except by observing the event. The point is that we cannot\nattribute dispositive coldness to a body unless such bodies have, or\nonce had, the relational quality cold.\n\nSecond, as Kaufman (2006: 186\u201390) describes it, Boyle maintains\nthat the MAs of snow in the actual world are de re identical\nto the MAs of snow in a world without perceivers, but Boyle wants to\nsay snow is cold in the actual world and only fit to be cold in the\nperceiverless world. This is problematic because it seems there is no\nrespect in which they could be different. Kaufman suggests a solution\nalong the following line. Because CT states that a body gains or\nlooses a quality if its relatum begins or ceases to exist and Boyle\nrecognizes a difference between a body\u2019s having a quality and\nsomeone\u2019s knowing that it does, he maintains that a body has a\ndispositive quality in virtue of how someone thinks of its MAs. That\nis, under the condition that animals are, or are assumed to be, absent\nfrom the world, a corpuscularian may reasonably think of the MAs of\nsnow as being fit to manifest cold were they to operate on a competent\nperceiver. That marks the difference between the MAs of snow in a\nperceiverless world and in the actual world, yet in the latter snow is\nnot cold. On this interpretation, dispositive qualities are beings of\nreason with a foundation in things (Kaufman 2006: 190).\n",
