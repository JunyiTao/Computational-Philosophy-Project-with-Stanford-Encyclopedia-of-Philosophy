    "main_text": "Historical introduction\n1. Historical introduction\n\nSystematic efforts to use philosophical insights about language to\nsolve problems in philosophy of law are relatively recent. Jeremy\nBentham was perhaps the first to make a deliberate attempt at it. He\ndeveloped a radically empiricist theory of the meaning of words, which\nsupported his utilitarianism and his legal theory.\n\nBentham wanted to abandon what he considered to be a nonsensical\nmythology of natural rights and duties\u2014that is, moral rights and\nduties that people have regardless of whether anyone is prepared to\nenforce them. He wanted, instead, to explain the nature of law by\nreference to \u2018sensible\u2019 phenomena (Bentham 1782, 251\u20132,\n283n.). Linguistic acts struck him as respectably empirical phenomena,\nand he made them an essential element of his theory of law. He based\nhis\n \u2018legal positivism\u2019\n on his claims about the meaning and use of words.\n\nLanguage had not been especially important to the\n natural law\n theorists whose views Bentham despised. They accounted for a law as a\ncertain sort of reason. From that perspective, philosophy of language\nhas no special role in explaining the nature of law. Philosophy of\nlanguage cannot explain the nature of reasons; it has the ancillary\nrole of explaining the possibility of communicating reasons and the\npossibility of creating reasons by the use of language (so that\nnatural law theorists have the same reason as others to seek a good\naccount of the legal effects of the use of language, and of the role\nof courts in resolving disputes over it). Bentham, by contrast,\nfastened on the \u2018sensible\u2019 phenomenon of a perceptible,\nintelligible linguistic act for his purpose of expounding the nature\nof law by reference to empirical phenomena.\n\nBentham seems to have thought of the meaning of a word in causal\nterms, as its capacity to act on a subject by raising an image of\nperceptible substances or emotions for which, he said, the word was a\nname. \u2018By these general terms or names, things and persons,\nacts, and so forth are brought to view\u2026\u2019 (Bentham 1782,\n82; see also Bentham 1776, 28, 108n). Words that do not bring to view\nsuch perceptible things have no meaning, on his theory, except insofar\nas they can be expounded by\n\u2018paraphrasis\u2019\u2014Bentham\u2019s method of translating\nwhole sentences in which those words are used into sentences that do\nraise images of perceptible things.\n\nTo many legal theorists that approach appeared, as H.L.A. Hart put it,\n\u2018as a revelation, bringing down to earth an elusive notion and\nrestating it in the same clear, hard, empirical terms as are used in\nscience\u2019 (Hart 2012, 84). The theory supported not only\nBentham\u2019s empiricism, but also his utilitarianism, because it\nprivileged what he viewed as the ultimate sensible (and therefore\nintelligible) \u2018affections\u2019: the pain and pleasure that\nutilitarianism treats as the basis for a theory of value and of\nmorality.\n\nIn his legal theory, this view of language became the basis of an\ninnovative account of law as the expression of the will of a sovereign\nin a political community. Bentham stated it as follows:\n\nA law may be defined as an assemblage of signs declarative of a\nvolition conceived or adopted by the sovereign in a state,\nconcerning the conduct to be observed in a certain case by a\ncertain person or class of persons, who in the case in question are or\nare supposed to be subject to his power\u2026 (Bentham 1782, 1)\n\n\nHe went on to explain that the signification of volition by such an\nassemblage of signs must be backed by \u2018motives\u2019 of pain or\npleasure offered by the sovereign.\n\nTwo features of this theory tie the philosophy of law to the\nphilosophy of language. One feature is methodological, and the other\nis substantive. First, Bentham proposes his theory as a definition of\nthe term a law (see section 6.1 below, on \u2018Definition\nas a methodology in philosophy of law\u2019). Secondly, he defines a\nlaw as a particular kind of assemblage of signs (see section 2.1\nbelow, on \u2018Law and Signs\u2019). In Bentham\u2019s view, a law\nis an assemblage of signs, and legal philosophy is a form of\nphilosophy of language. The legal theorist has a linguistic task of\ndefining the terms (especially law, but others as well) of\nlegal discourse.\n\nThat, in brief, is the apogee of the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law. Bentham was ahead of his time. His theory of the\nmeaning and use of words anticipated various trends in\ntwentieth-century philosophy of language (including Frege\u2019s and\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u2018context principle\u2019, some views of\nlogical positivists, and the development of speech act theory). It was\nH.L.A.Hart who, in the 1950s and 1960s, made a concerted effort to use\ntwentieth-century developments in philosophy of language to\n\u2018elucidate\u2019 the nature of law. He did so with an\nenthusiasm for the work of Wittgenstein, and also of the Oxford\nphilosophers J.L.Austin and Paul Grice. So Hart had some advantages\nover Bentham. Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations had been directed against the view that a\nword\u2019s meaning is the thing for which it stands as a name. That\nwas one of the misconceptions that distorted Bentham\u2019s theory of\nthe meaning of words: he thought that a word like \u2018right\u2019\nhad to be a name for an entity, and that since no such entity could be\nsensed, the word was a name for a \u2018fictitious\nentity\u2019 (Bentham 1782, 251). And J.L.Austin took an\nattitude to ordinary discourse that was quite opposed to that of\nBentham, who thought that philosophy must tear away the \u2018veil of\nmystery\u2019 that ordinary language throws over every object of\nstudy (Bentham 1782, 251). Wittgenstein\u2019s attitude was more\ncomplex: he thought both that philosophers create philosophical\nproblems by bewitching themselves with language, and also that a clear\nunderstanding of the use of language could provide healthy therapy for\npeople suffering from philosophical problems. Taking advantage of the\ninsights of Wittgenstein and J.L.Austin, Hart aimed to put philosophy\nof language to work in addressing problems of legal philosophy,\nwithout making what he regarded as Bentham\u2019s extravagant\nmistakes.\n\nIn 1961, Hart\u2019s book The Concept of Law raised issues\nthat have occupied legal philosophers ever since. He borrowed J.L.\nAustin\u2019s method of \u2018using a sharpened awareness of words\nto sharpen our perception of the phenomena\u2019 (Hart 2012, v, 14).\nHart\u2019s observations about the use of language in law were\nelements in an innovative approach to explaining the normativity of\nlaw\u2014that is, the fact that law presents itself as conferring\nrights and powers and as imposing obligations and liabilities. Hart\nargued that we can understand that feature of law more clearly, if we\nunderstand where Bentham and his nineteenth-century disciple\n John Austin\n (not to be confused with J.L.Austin) went wrong in explaining the\nmeaning and use of normative language. Hart\u2019s new approach to\nthe issue has been a starting point for discussions of the normativity\nof law since the 1960s (see section 6.2 below).\n\nRonald Dworkin argued that Hart\u2019s focus on language had a toxic\neffect on legal philosophy. He wrote that Hart suffered from a\n\u2018semantic sting\u2019, because he wrongly thought \u2018that\nlawyers all follow certain linguistic criteria for judging\npropositions of law\u2019 (Dworkin 1986b, 45; see section 6.1 below).\nThat argument in the philosophy of language has set an agenda for much\ndebate in philosophy of law (see, for example, the essays in Coleman,\n2001).\n\nBecause of the allure of philosophy of language, and partly as a\nresult of the influence of Hart, the use of philosophy of language in\nphilosophy of law became the focus of much jurisprudential thought and\ndebate in the 20th century. One notable example is the work of Jerzy\nWr\u00f3blewski, a Polish legal theorist who developed a\n\u2018semantic conception of a legal norm\u2019 (Wr\u00f3blewski\n1983), and offered a theory of legal language as a sub-type of natural\nlanguage with multiple \u2018fuzzy\u2019 characteristics\n(Wr\u00f3blewski 1985). In Italian analytical legal philosophy, the\ninfluential theorist Norberto Bobbio began in the 1950s \u2018to\nconsider law as a language and legal science as a meta-language\u2019\n(Pintore and Jori 1997, 3), in service of a theory of law based on a\nnon-cognitivist moral theory. Two succeeding generations of Italian\nlegal theorists have engaged in \u2018dispute on semiotic ground,\nrather than directly by arguments of general legal philosophical\npositions\u2019 (Pintore and Jori, 17).\n\nThat development was one instance of the widespread use of views about\nlanguage in debunking conventional views about law in the 20th\ncentury. Perhaps this development resulted not so much from the\ninfluence of Bentham\u2019s own writings, as from pursuit of the same\nsearch that he undertook, for ways of identifying the elements of law\nthat suit empiricist philosophical sensibilities. The energetic\n20th-century school of \u2018Scandinavian legal realism\u2019 viewed\nlegal terms like \u2018right\u2019 as \u2018lacking semantic\nreference\u2019 and \u2018denoting nothing\u2019. So they\nconsidered statements asserting the existence of rights, duties, and\nother legal relations to be incapable of being true or false\n(Olivecrona 1971, 246, 255, 261). They variously explained the use of\nsuch statements as attempts to perform magical incantations, or as\ntools for taking advantage of the psychological conditioning that\nleads officials and citizens to act in one way or another when they\nhear such statements (see the outline of Scandinavian realism in\nOlivecrona 1971, 174\u2013182, and see Ross 1956; see also section\n5.1 of the entry on\n naturalism in legal philosophy).\n\nSimilarly, various strands in the influential American legal academic\nenterprise of \u2018economic analysis of law\u2019 share\nBentham\u2019s debunking attitude toward central legal terms such as\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018obligation\u2019. Like Bentham, some\neconomic analysts oscillate (or equivocate) between (1) a moral theory\nthat reduces those normative terms to terms describing maximization of\nhuman satisfactions, and (2) a theory that does not engage in moral\nargument, but only claims to describe human motivation, accounting for\nterms such as \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018obligation\u2019 as\nrhetorical epithets that agents use to pursue what they will (see the\nentry on the\n economic analysis of law,\n section 2.2).\n\nNot all legal sceptics have been driven by the empiricism of Bentham\nand the Scandinavians. Many other forms of scepticism about law have\nalso sought support in scepticism about the meaning of language.\nAttacks on the coherence of the idea of the rule of law, and on the\nmeaningfulness of legal discourse, have used ideas in the philosophy\nof language as diverse as Saul Kripke\u2019s interpretation of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on rule following (see section 3.1 of the\nentry on\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning),\n and deconstruction (see Endicott 2000, chapter 1).\n",
