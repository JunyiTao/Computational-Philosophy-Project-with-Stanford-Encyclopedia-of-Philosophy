    "main_text": "Specific Fields || Social and Political Thought\n5.5 Social and Political Thought\n\nAnderson\u2019s moral and political thought was strongly influenced\nby the writings of the French socialist Georges Sorel (and before him\nthe libertarian socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon). Although Anderson\nabandoned communism and socialism as movements whose time had passed,\nthe influence of these thinkers for whom socialism was a moral\nmovement remained with him (Cole 2009). In all fields of human\nactivity, there is a conflict between what Sorel described as the\n\u201cethic of the producer\u201d, characterised by spontaneous and\ncooperative endeavour, and the ethic of the consumer, characterised by\nan instrumental morality of reward and punishment, obligation and\nexpectation, an ethic most perfectly suited in sociological terms to\nthe marketplace (and in purely psychological terms to the compulsive\nobligations of the neurotic personality). More accurately, for\nAnderson, the ethic of the consumer is an ethic without a\ntheme. In history there are classical periods of cultural\nachievement in contrast with periods in which we struggle to find a\ntheme at all; that is, periods in which nothing really happens,\nnothing develops from within. Anderson also admired Vico\u2019s\ncyclical view of history and by the 1940s had not only resigned\nhimself to the collapse of heroic 19th century socialism, but\ndiscerned in the era of post-war optimism and state planning the early\nstages of one of Vico\u2019s periods of barbarism\n(EMP, 290). More positively, for Anderson the\nrejection of all totalising views, the thesis that \u201cno formula\ncovers all things\u201d, has the practical consequence of supporting\nand encouraging \u201ca life of responsibility and adventure\u201d\nfor those prepared to face the situation (EMP,\n86).\n\nAnderson intended to combat the influence of idealism in our thinking\non political issues evident since Plato\u2019s Republic. The\nmodernist, realist project he meant to develop in opposition to the\npolitical outlook of British Idealism would draw upon the major\ntheorists of conflict, struggle and cyclic historical movement:\nHeraclitus, Vico and Sorel. In place of a simple contrast between\nindividual and state Anderson insisted upon the complex interplay of\nmovements, institutions and traditions. In place of an unargued\ntendency towards ever greater social harmony he insisted on the\ninevitability of conflict and constant adjustment, the persistent\ndanger of regress, and the consequent need for clear lines of critical\nengagement. Order is a Heraclitean state of balance between complex\ninteracting forces rather than a normative standard by which to\nmeasure existing social and political formations. Conflict is not an\nindication of social dysfunction which needs to be overcome or\nrationalised away, but a necessary feature of any social institution.\nAny notion of an ideal state without such features can have no bearing\non our present real life situation.\n\nAnderson\u2019s political thought is distinctive for his rejection of\nthe state as the fundamental object of political investigation and\nreflection. This aspect of his thought aligns rather strongly with\nmodern Nietzschean and anti-humanist political thought. For Anderson\nthe social is not reducible to agreements among atomic individuals. In\nhis anti-individualist statements, however, he seems to echo an\nidealist view of social movements portrayed, for example, by Bernard\nBosanquet who similarly decried the \u201crepellent isolation\u201d\nof atomist individualism. Culture and human achievement depend upon\nthe capacity of human beings to engage in activities that take them\noutside themselves. Apart from these struggles with nature or within\nbroad social movements, a person collapses into non-entity (Bosanquet\n1899, pp. xxxiii ff.). \n\nAnderson\u2019s rejection of good as an end to be achieved applied to\nhis ultimate rejection of socialism as a progressive movement and of\nMarxism in particular. \u201cThe doctrine of history as struggle is\nat once the liberal and the scientific part of Marxism; the doctrine\nof socialism as something to be established (\u2018classless\nsociety\u2019) is its servile part\u201d (EMP,\n339). Socialism for Anderson was not a goal to be achieved but a\nmovement to be joined. The amelioration of social conditions of the\nworkers would be achieved by the workers themselves in the process of\nasserting the value and validity of their way of life within the wider\nsocio-political sphere. But once alleviation became the primary goal\nof the workers\u2019 movement and representatives, that movement was\nfinished as a progressive and liberating force. It could be bought off\nby employers and the state. Socialism understood as a force lobbying\nfor state action and funding to redress market inequities had become\nmired in \u201cservility\u201d as a matter of historical fact.\n",
