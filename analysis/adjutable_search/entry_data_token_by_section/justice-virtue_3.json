Justice as a Virtue of Societies\n\nFor a variety of reasons, many ethical thinkers have thought that\njustice cannot be based in sentiment but requires a more\nintellectually constructive rational(ist) basis, and in recent times\nthis view of the matter seems to have been held, most influentially,\nby John Rawls in A Theory of Justice. Rawls makes clear his\nbelief in the inadequacy of benevolence or sympathetic human sentiment\nin formulating an adequate conception of social justice. He says in\nparticular that sentiment leaves unanswered or indeterminate various\nimportant issues of justice that a good theory of justice ought to be\nable to resolve.\n\nRawls\u2019s positive view of justice is concerned primarily with the\njustice of institutions or (what he calls) the \u201cbasic\nstructure\u201d of society: justice as an individual virtue is\nderivative from justice as a social virtue defined via certain\nprinciples of justice. The principles, famously, are derived from an\n\u201coriginal position\u201d in which (very roughly) rational\ncontractors under a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d decide how they\nwish to commit themselves to being governed in their actual lives.\nRawls deliberately invokes Kantian rationalism (or\nanti-sentimentalism) in explaining the intellectual or theoretical\nmotivation behind his construction, and the two principles of justice\nthat he argues would be agreed upon under the contractual conditions\nhe specifies represent a kind of egalitarian political liberalism.\nRoughly, those principles stress (equality of) basic liberties and\nopportunities for self-advancement over considerations of social\nwelfare, and the distribution of opportunities and goods in society is\nthen supposed to work to the advantage of all (especially the\nworst-off members of society). He also says that the idea of what\npeople distributively deserve or merit is derivative from social\njustice rather than (as with Aristotle and/or much common-sense\nthinking) providing the basis for thinking about social justice.\n\nAccording to Rawls, individual justice is theoretically derivative\nfrom social justice because the just individual is to be understood as\nsomeone with an effective or \u201cregulative\u201d desire to comply\nwith the principles of justice. However, it is not merely social\njustice that Rawls understands in (predominantly) rationalist fashion.\nWhen he explains how individuals (within a just society) develop a\nsense and/or the virtue of justice, he invokes the work of Piaget.\nRawls lays more stress than Piaget does on the role our affective\nnature (sympathy and the desire for self-mastery) plays in the\nacquisition of moral virtue. But, like Piaget, he stresses the need\nfor a sufficiently general appreciation and rational\nunderstanding of social relations as the grounding basis of a\nsense of duty or of justice and he explicitly classifies his account\nof moral development as falling within the \u201crationalist\ntradition.\u201d \n4. Justice and Other Virtues\n\nFew would doubt that justice is a virtue of character. But there are\nother moral virtues. How is justice related to them? Is it more\nimportant? Even in Republic, in which Plato makes justice a\n\u201cmaster virtue\u201d of sorts, there are other virtues (wisdom,\ncourage, and self-discipline), and elsewhere (notably\nGorgias) Plato makes self-discipline (sophrosune)\nthe \u201cmaster virtue,\u201d so it is not clear that justice has any sort\nof priority over these other virtues. Likewise, though the texts we\nhave show Aristotle devoting more space to justice, it is not clear\nthat the particular form of the virtue of justice has any sort of\npre-eminence. On the other hand, Cicero claims that justice is the\n\u201ccrowning glory\u201d of the virtues (De Officiis I.7). If we\ntake virtue of character to have the moral centrality the ancients\n(perhaps in contrast to the moderns), how much importance should we\naccord to justice among the virtues?\n\nAquinas cites Cicero as a target in developing a sophisticated view of\nthe relationships among the virtues (ST II-II 58.12). On\nAquinas\u2019 view, Cicero is half right, for Aquinas distinguishes\nbetween virtues as responsive to appetites of our animal nature (moral\nvirtues) and as responsive to appetites of our intellect (virtues of\nthe will). He takes it that justice is preeminent over the moral\nvirtues because it inheres in the rational part of the soul, and\nbecause its object is more noble (the good of others, or the common\ngood, rather than the individual good). On that point he can agree\nwith Cicero. However, these virtues themselves are not as excellent as\nthe theological virtues, of which the greatest is love (or charity --\ncaritas; ST II-II 23.6). There are several arguments for this\nclaim but it is grounded in Paul\u2019s admonition to the Corinthians,\nthat love is the greatest among the virtues of faith and hope (1\nCorinthians 13:13).\n\nIn recent decades there have been secular challenges to the primacy of\njustice among virtues. Recall that Carol Gilligan had argued for a\n\u201cdifferent voice\u201d for women in coming to grips with moral\nproblems. Instead of a rights-based understanding of morality that\ngave special consideration to the individual, women saw relationships\nbetween people as primary (Gilligan 1983, pp. 19, 29). Kohlberg had\noffered a thought experiment about a man (\u201cHeinz\u201d) tempted to\nsteal a life-saving drug to save his sick wife (Kohlberg 1981, p. 12).\nWhereas boys are more likely to think of Heinz\u2019 dilemma in terms of\nwhat is the right thing to do, girls, Gilligan argues, see the world\nas \u201ca world of relationships and psychological truths where an\nawareness of the connection between people gives rise to a recognition\nof responsibility for one another\u201d (Gillian 1983, p. 30). Gilligan\ncarefully frames this contrast as one between voices, not a matter of\nranking of dispositions or virtues, but her work can and did provide a\nbasis for making that sort of assessment between virtues, one on which\n(as in Aquinas\u2019 case) love and care for others turns out to be more\nimportant than considerations of justice.\n\nIn some ways, Nel Nodding\u2019s pioneering work in laying out an\n\u201cethic of care\u201d takes such a step. Following Gilligan, she sees\nmuch ethical theory as missing a feminine voice, one which grounds\nmoral concern for the concrete other in caring for them and their\nneeds, and thus as relational rather than individualistic (Noddings\n1983, 1999). Yet some caution is required before seeing her as taking\nup something like a Thomistic stance on the priority of love over\njustice. For one thing, to a significant degree she wants to emphasize\nthe importance of the concrete and particular as opposed to the\nabstract and general (or the reliance on universal principles) in\nthinking and acting morally. But that is an emphasis which animates\nsome particularistic forms of virtue ethics, and does not distinguish\njustice from love or other virtues. Moreover, where she explicitly\nargues that care \u201c\u2018picks up\u2019 where justice leaves off\u201d\n(Noddings 1999, p. 12), she is thinking of justice as a property of\ninstitutions (e.g. Rawls\u2019 theory of justice as fairness), and\ninstitutional implementations of those theories, not a virtue of\ncharacter. She is clearly concerned about the limits of\n\u201crights-talk,\u201d but that at least historically has not been a\nprominent part in thinking about justice as a virtue of character.\nThus she does not clearly take a side in this matter.\n\nLike Noddings, Virginia Held frames much of the point of the ethics of\ncare against a historical theoretical backdrop of attention to justice\n(Held 1995, 2004, 2006). To some extent, like Noddings, for Held the\nrelevant notion of justice is not a virtue of character but a concern\nwith fairness, equality, and individual rights, or perhaps more\ngenerally impartial universal principles (Held 2004, p. 144; 2006, p.\n14). In fact, Held more clearly poses an ethics of care as an\nalternative to virtue ethics (Held 2004, 143; 2006, 14). This is for\ntwo reasons. First, virtue ethical theories focus on dispositions and\ntraits of individuals, whereas an ethics of care focuses on relations\nbetween individuals. Second, an ethics of care sees people as\npartially constituted by their relations with others, as opposed to\nthe individualism characteristic of virtue ethics. Held does not think\nan ethics of care can do without a concern for justice as a value,\nhowever (Held 1995, 129). More generally, she believes, caring\nprovides a \u201cwider network\u201d within which concerns for justice and\nvirtue (as well as utility) should be fitted (2004, 147; 2006, 72).\nMargaret McLaren (2001), on the other hand, responds on the basis of\ncommonalities between care ethics and virtue ethics that care ethics\nactually is most attractive when situated as an ethics of virtue.\nMarilyn Friedman (1987) similarly seems accepting of the general\nframework of virtue ethics, and of crucial places for virtues of both\ncaring and justice within such a framework, responsive to different\ndegrees and in different ways to gender differences she believes\nactually do hold, though not falling along a caring/justice fault\nline.\n\nMichael Slote also accepts care ethics as well-situated as a virtue\nethical theory, but argues for the necessity of conceiving such a\ntheory as \u201cagent-based\u201d -- holding that motivation or motives are\n\u201cthe ultimate bases for evaluation of action, institutions, laws,\nand societies\u201d (Slote 1998, p. 173). As he has developed his view,\nempathic motivation has come to take an increasing role (Slote 2010,\np. 124). As with Noddings and Held, for Slote the relevant questions\nabout justice are about forms of social organization, the allocation\nof rights, and so on. If there is a vestige of the Platonic/Justinian\nmodel of justice as a virtue, it would appear to figure in only as a\nrationale for the shape of some social policies reflecting e.g. social\n(or perhaps global) distributive justice. But empathy is the focal\nnormative concern throughout. The justice of a society constitutively\ndepends on the motives of the individuals who make it up (Slote 1998,\np. 187; 2010, p. 128). If the relevant motives are caring or empathic\nones, then Slote\u2019s analysis would seem to collapse the distinction\nbetween caring and justice as virtues of individual character (or\nmotivation). That is, individuals would count as just exactly to the\ndegree that their motivations are empathic, and they thus contribute\nto the laws, policies, institutions, and so on in ways that are\nreflective of similar motivations across society. But that is just to\nsay that they are caring motivations as well.\n\nA somewhat different feminist critique of a focus on a virtue of\njustice comes from Robin Dillon. Like Slote, her concern is more with\nsocial institutions, structures, and hierarchies than with traits of\ncharacter, and in fact these priorities lead her to be critical of\nvirtue ethical theories which, she believes, cannot ask the right\nquestions about virtues and vices (Dillon 2012, p. 86). However, she\ndoes accept the point that character traits matter, though she\nbelieves attending to the vices that allow and support social\nstructures that allow for oppression and domination is more pertinent\nto feminist moral philosophy.\n\nLisa Tessman, on the other hand, accepts the basic framework of\nAristotelian thinking about virtues of character, and with it the\nvirtue of justice (Tessman 2005). However, she argues that oppressive\nsocial conditions can interfere in ways Aristotle did not anticipate\nwith the formation of virtues of character and consequently (given\nAristotle\u2019s framework) with prospects for happiness (eudaimonia).\nOne point of amendment, then, to Aristotelian thought is to recognize\nthat oppressive social conditions may make other traits \u2014 traits\nthat are important for liberatory struggle \u2014 into virtues.\nAnother, congruent with other lines of feminist critique, is that\nAristotle is insufficiently appreciative of the need for sensitivity\nto and response to suffering, so that something like the kind of\nsupplementation recommended by care ethics is appropriate. A different\nmodel of response to the development of the virtue of justice\nspecifically under non-ideal or unjust social conditions, one modeled\non Kohlberg\u2019s original architectonic understanding of the virtue, is\ndefended by Jon Garthoff (Garthoff 2018). \n\nFinally, in recent work Talbot Brewer has argued that a\n\u201crevisionist\u201d version of Aristotelian virtue ethics does a better\njob than competitors (including Kantian and contractualist theories)\nat recognizing the \u201cirreplaceable value\u201d of each human being\n(Brewer 2018). Brewer believes that a robust conception of the virtue\nof justice does important work for such a theory, not just focusing on\ndistribution and allocation, but more generally establishing the space\nfor virtuous recognition of ways that others can demand that we treat\nthem (Brewer 2018, p. 25). Still, Brewer invokes Aquinas to argue that\nsuch justice is not enough, that that what is required is a\nrecognition of a virtue of love to unify and perfect the other virtues\nof character.\n5. Recent Developments\n\nWhile Rawls\u2019 work has sparked an explosion of work in\ndistributive justice and social justice more generally, in recent\nyears a variety of strategies to return to a focus on justice as a\npersonal virtue has emerged. These strategies vary across both\ndimensions we have considered, taking with various degrees of\nseriousness the connection between institutional and personal forms of\njustice, and focusing on the latter as a virtue, among (and like)\nother virtues.\n\nOne such strategy is that of Jon Drydyk, who builds on the\n\u201ccapability approach\u201d to human welfare to make a case for\na capabilities-based account of the justice of individual agents, in\nparticular as against an \u201cAristotelian\u201d approach that\nstresses justice as a matter of response to merit. Acting justly\ninvolves \u201cstriving to reduce and remove inequalities in\npeople\u2019s capabilities to function in ways that are\nelemental\u201d to a truly human life (Drydyk 2012, pp. 31, 33). This\nis a \u201csubsidiary\u201d virtue account, in that we begin with a\nprior conception of the content of the requirements of justice, and\nconform the virtue to this conception. However, Drydyk emphasizes\njustice as a virtue of individuals, rather than institutions or\nsocieties. Drydyk\u2019s strategy offers a counterpoint both to the\nRawlsian way of thinking about just societies and to the ancient Greek\nway of thinking about justice as a virtue of individuals.\n\nJohn Hacker-Wright argues that what is needed to replace a\n\u201clegalistic\u201d concern with moral status (as on modern\nliberal conceptions of justice) is instead an ethic of virtue with a\ndifferent conception of the virtue of justice. Instead of a concern\nfor the resolution of claims in something like reciprocal, contractual\nrelations, Hacker-Wright\u2019s conception of the virtue of justice\nis a matter of sensitivity to \u201cvulnerability of value\u201d in\nthings, animate and otherwise. Thus, the threat of unjust \u2014\nvicious -- wronging hangs not only over people who are sufficiently\ncognitively impaired so as not to perceive insults, but also corpses,\nanimals, and even rare and valuable rock formations (p. 463). This\ncounts as a sense of justice in that, on Hacker-Wright\u2019s view it\nis not merely that we can act wrongly or viciously toward such\nentities, but (following Midgley 1983) that they can be wronged by us\nby our doing so. However, while Hacker-Wright claims that on a virtue\nethic \u201cThe character of the agent is recognized as ineliminable\nin picking out facts as they figure in our moral deliberation,\u201d\nthis does not strictly speaking seem to be true, as prior to virtue\nthere is value which it is up to the just or virtuous person\nto respond with sensitivity (Hacker-Wright 2007, pp. 461, 463,\n464).\n\nDavid Schmidtz and John Thrasher suggest rethinking the relationship\nbetween social justice and individual justice (Schmidtz and Thrasher\n2014). Turning Plato\u2019s account of justice in Republic\non its head, they depict justice as a bridge between a virtue of the\nsoul and of the polis: because we are essentially social, we\nneed community, and justice is a matter of harmony with the community.\nOn their view this is (largely) a matter of compliance with rules and\ninstitutions that enable people to live in harmony and flourish\ntogether.\n\nAn alternative proposal for thinking of the justice as a personal\nvirtue ties it intimately to the experiences we have as emotional\ncreatures. On this approach, instead of justice standing as distinct\nfrom \u201cnatural virtues\u201d motivated by passions (as on\nHume\u2019s account), or needing to be replaced by\nsentimentally-driven attitudes such as care or compassion, justice is\nto be seen as a virtue largely constituted by emotion\n(Solomon 1994, Roberts 2010). The virtue amounts to a stable\ndisposition of character to respond in the relevant ways to instances\nof injustice, perhaps consisting in those occasions in which one does\nnot receive his or her due, and on the other hand to be disposed to a\n\u201cwill to give each his due\u201d (Roberts 2010, p. 38). For\nRoberts, this is a will to realize \u201cobjective justice,\u201d\nand as on other recent accounts, the virtue (and the passion) are\ntheoretically subsidiary to this primary notion of \u201cobjective\njustice.\u201d\n\nThere are also recent ventures in the spirit of the ancient Greek\nthinking about the individual virtue of justice. Rasmussen and Den Uyl\n(2005) argue for two interpersonal senses of justice (pp. 160-63). One\nis the familiar Aristotelian virtue. The second is a\n\u201cmetanormative\u201d principle governing the institutions and\nlegal frameworks in which individual agents (just and otherwise) live\ntheir lives and exercise their practical agency. The second of these\nsenses of interpersonal justice does not draw its content from the\nexercise of virtue, but rather makes a place for it. The former does\ndepend on virtue overall (including the exercise of practical wisdom)\nfor its demands, but these are construed broadly in the traditional\nway of rendering to each his due. Bloomfield (2011) similarly suggests\nextending the Aristotelian virtue of justice, but in an inward\ndirection, arguing that self-respect is necessary for happiness, and\ntreating oneself fairly requires treating oneself fairly, as one\ntreats others fairly, as a property of justice as individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolterstorff (2008) argues that the eudaimonism of\nGreek thought prevents a proper appreciation for the nature and\nsignificance of justice and rights. Whether there is theoretical space\nremaining for a virtue of justice is not a question Wolterstorff\nconsiders, but he does believe there is no hope for an adequate grip\non justice in an Aristotelian or Stoic framework. \n\nRecent thinkers have grappled with the question of priority between\nformal principle and virtue that vexed Aristotle, and offered\nsolutions that for the most part subordinate the virtue of justice to\nthe prior notion of the justice of distributions, as Aristotle himself\nseems to have suggested. Bernard Williams claims explicitly that this\nis so (Williams 1980, p. 197), as does David Wiggins, in an attempt to\nbring a \u201cpre-liberal,\u201d Aristotelian conception of justice\nto bear on modern liberal conceptions, a la Kant and Rawls (Wiggins\n2004). To do so, Wiggins distinguishes three senses of justice: (A) a\nmatter of outcomes or states of affairs in which each gets what is\ndue; (B) a disposition to promote justice (A); (C) a condition of the\npolis in virtue of which (A) is realized. Wiggins claims that the\nproper outcome of this collision of conceptions is one that recognizes\na form of logical priority of justice (A) over justice (B)\n(p. 489). At the same time, against Williams he insists that the\nnormative demands of justice (A) are \u201ccomprehensible\u201d only\nwithin the perspective of a person with justice (B). And in fact he\nclaims that a necessary condition on acts and outcomes satisfying the\nnorms of justice (A) is that they be recognized to be so by those with\nthe virtue of justice (B). Wiggins\u2019 thinking here is not\ntransparent, but perhaps the thought is that the logical point is\npurely formal: someone with justice (B) must, in act or judging\njustly, be responding to some norm which counts as justice (A). But,\nas merely formal, that tells us nothing about the substantive\ncontent of that norm. To get that, we have ineliminable need to refer\nto the judgment of the person with justice (B). That marks a way\nperhaps of restoring Aristotle\u2019s focus on virtue in coming to\nunderstand the virtue of justice. \n\nLeBar (2013, 2014) takes a similar tack in attempting to incorporate\nKantian and post-Kantian insights into just demands on the treatment\nof others into an Aristotelian virtue framework. On his view, there is\nno way to specify the contents of the demands of justice, or to spell\nout its norms, independently of the wider possession and exercise of\nthe virtues, including the virtue of practical wisdom. At the same\ntime, what the virtuous and just person sees, in inhabiting a social\nworld with equals in moral standing, are the norms which have become\nassociated with the liberal conception: the standing to obligate\nothers and hold them accountable, for example.\n\nFinally, all of these are Western treatments of an individual virtue\nof justice. May Sim (Sim 2007, 2018) makes the case that there are\ninformative parallels between the Confucian treatment of the virtues\n(in particular, yi) and the virtue of justice as adumbrated in Plato\nand Aristotle. \n6. Conclusion\n\nThere are many different conceptions of the virtue of justice, and\nonly some of them are distinctively virtue ethical. Many non-virtual\nethical approaches put forward theories of virtue, and what\ndistinguishes them from virtue ethics is that the given theory of\nvirtue comes later in the order of explanation, rather than itself\nserving as the basis for understanding (all of) morality. This is\nespecially the case with justice, where (as we have seen) it is\nnaturally tempting to account for the norms of justice first\nand derive an account of the virtue in light of those norms.\nThe question of the priority of norms of justice or the virtue of\njustice is likely to continue to generate exploration and debate, as\nis the question of how our lives as social and political animals\ncontributes to understanding the virtue of justice. These vexed\nquestions have inspired a profusion of views and no doubt will\ncontinue to do so. ",
