    "main_text": "The 20th Century\n8. The 20th Century\n8.1. Philosophy and the Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131930)\n\nThe Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910, was the most significant\nevent in modern Mexican history. While it was primarily a military\ncampaign in defense of political democracy and equality, comprehensive\nagrarian reform, and workers\u2019 rights, some argue that it was\ndeeply influenced by a \u201cclimate of ideas\u201d, including\nclassical and social liberalism, the social doctrine of the Catholic\nChurch, socialism, anarchism, spiritism, Bergsonism, and pragmatism.\nSome of the Revolution\u2019s most influential intellectuals were\nactivists first and foremost, such as Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n and\nFrancisco Madero, both of whom fought against the dictatorship of\nPorfirio D\u00edaz. From 1904 until his death in 1922, Flores\nMag\u00f3n lived in the United States, first as an exile and then as\na prison inmate. In many of his writings, distributed through the\nclandestine journal Regeneraci\u00f3n, he developed a\nconception of society based on socialist and anarchist philosophy. And\nMadero, who was elected President of Mexico and who is perhaps best\nknown for his La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910 (1908),\nwas also an important defender of Allen Kardec\u2019s branch of\nspiritism.\n\nIf some revolutionaries were primarily activists, others were\nprimarily artists and intellectuals who became the voice of their\ngeneration. Such was the case of a young group of students who\ngathered in Mexico City and referred to themselves as the\n\u201cAteneo de la Juventud\u201d. Antonio Caso (1883\u20131946)\nand Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos (1882\u20131959) were two of its most\nprominent members, both of whom criticized the predominance of\npositivism, which they found culturally demoralizing. In particular,\nthey rejected the positivist view that humanity is moved by selfish\ncalculation, that morality is accountable to the laws of nature, and\nthat the universe is governed by deterministic laws. The members of\nthe Ateneo stated that humans are free, creative, and spiritual,\ncapable of using intuition to understand the world, and inspired by\nmoral feelings that transcend the laws of nature. This conception of\nhuman beings and the world can also be considered an essential part of\nthe climate of ideas surrounding the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAntonio Caso was the leading figure of Mexican philosophy in the first\ndecades of the 20th century, and was most influential as a\ncharismatic professor who inspired generations of students to pursue\nphilosophy. Caso also created the Department of Philosophy at the\nNational University of Mexico and helped to introduce Mexicans to\ncontemporary European philosophers and schools of thought. His most\nimportant work, Existencia como econom\u00eda, como\ndesinter\u00e9s y como caridad (1919), was a challenge to\nDarwin\u2019s theory of biology, Spencer\u2019s social evolutionism,\nNietzsche\u2019s doctrine of the \u00dcbermensch, and Max\nStirner\u2019s radical egoism, and it drew inspiration from sources\nas diverse as Bergson, Tolstoy, and Christianity.\n\nAccording to Caso, human existence has three levels: the biological or\neconomic, the disinterested or aesthetic, and the charitable. Caso\nconsidered this last level the highest expression of human dignity and\napplied this distinction to other moral, political, and aesthetic\nproblems. In the 1930s, Caso defended academic freedom and the\nautonomy of the university and decried the changes to the 1933 Mexican\nConstitution that would reform public education along the lines of\nhistorical materialism. For example, he famously debated with the\nMexican Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano (1894\u20131968) about\ncongress\u2019s plan to make public education socialist. In La\npersona humana y el estado totalitario (1941), Caso defends\ndemocracy against fascism and communism. For a comprehensive overview\nof Caso\u2019s philosophy, see Mexican philosopher Rosa Krauze de\nKolteniuk\u2019s (1923\u20142003) La filosof\u00eda de Antonio\nCaso (1961).\n\nJos\u00e9 Vasconcelos was one of the most influential thinkers and\npromoters of Mexican culture in the 20th century. His\nreputation as an intellectual, politician, and writer is stronger than\nhis reputation as a philosopher. However, he cannot be passed over in\na history of Mexican philosophy. His theoretical works can be divided\ninto two groups. The first group includes the writings in which he\ndeveloped a philosophical system, from Est\u00e9tica (1936)\nto L\u00f3gica (1945), specifically an overarching\nmetaphysical view that he had sketched out as early as 1916 in his\nPit\u00e1goras, una teor\u00eda del ritmo. Vasconcelos\nbelieved that his main contribution to philosophy was the notion of an\naesthetic a priori, as well as a list of metaphysical\ncategories based on music rather than logic or science. According to\nhim, the universe is more like a symphony than a logical treatise, and\nunderstanding requires the emotions as much as the intellect.\n\nUnfortunately, his philosophical legacy was compromised by his\nabrasive personality and self-imposed isolation, and because he was\nnot, like Caso, a professor of philosophy. Vasconcelos considered his\nwriting on Latin American history and culture\u2014the second group\nof writings\u2014secondary to his philosophical work. Nevertheless,\nhis account of Latin American history and culture have been more\ninfluential than his work on philosophy. His most influential work,\nLa raza c\u00f3smica (1925), is a prophetic essay in which\nhe considers Latin America the fountain of a mixed, cosmic race that\nwill synthesize the four human races and lead humanity to the height\nof its development: the aesthetic. Although Vasconcelos believed that\nphilosophy should be studied for its own sake, and for the\nuniversality of its ideas, he also claimed that Latin American nations\nshould use philosophy to resist political, economic, and intellectual\ndomination of the countries to the north (see his\n\u00c9tica, 1932).\n\nIn the late 1920s the pedagogical and social ideas of John Dewey were\ninfluential in Mexican education. Vasconcelos believed that\nDewey\u2019s philosophy was a vehicle for US imperialism and wrote a\ncriticism of Dewey titled De Robinson a Odiseo (1935).\n8.2. The Forming of Professional Philosophy (1930\u20131960)\n\nThe intellectual atmosphere of the 1930s underwent dramatic changes:\nthe new generation of students, many of whom were\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Caso and Vasconcelos, were not interested in\nthe debate between determinism and freedom or materialism and spirit.\nTo them, values, objectivity, and social responsibility were the\ncentral issues of the day. They rejected the intuitionism and the\nirrationalism of Caso and Vasconcelos and favored a renewed\nrationalism and universalism. Critical reflection on what it means to\nbe Mexican also started to gain importance, although it was not until\nthe end of the 1940s that it reached full prominence.\n\nAt the time, Mexican philosophers also gained confidence in their role\non the international stage. On the one hand, post-revolutionary\nMexican culture was enjoying something of a golden age of creativity,\nparticularly concerning its own authentic national identity. On the\nother hand, the two world wars convinced many intellectuals that the\nfuture of Western Civilization was to be found in America. The\nconstruction of an American philosophy and, in particular, of Mexican\nphilosophy, was seen as the only way the philosophical tradition of\nAncient Greece could be rescued from European decadence and\nsavagery.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, former students of Caso, such as Jos\u00e9\nRomano Mu\u00f1oz (1890\u20131967), Samuel Ramos (1897\u20131959),\nAdalberto Garc\u00eda de Mendoza (1900\u20131963), Oswaldo Robles\n(1905\u20131969), Edmundo O\u2019Gorman (1906\u20131995), Francisco\nLarroyo (1908\u20131981), Eduardo Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez\n(1908\u20131993), Antonio G\u00f3mez Robledo (1908\u20131994) and\nGuillermo H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez (1910\u20131988) adopted and\npromoted philosophical currents from Germany, such as Neo-Kantianism\nof the Marburg and Baden schools, Dilthey\u2019s historicism,\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology, Heidegger\u2019s existentialism,\nKelsen\u2019s legal positivism and, above all, the philosophy of\nvalues of Scheler and Hartmann. Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset,\nspecifically his journal Revista de Occidente, also\ninfluenced that generation.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Samuel Ramos, employed European models and\nideals to reflect inwardly on what Ramos referred to as \u201cthe\nMexican psyche\u201d. Ramos was a famous critic of Caso\u2019s\nphilosophical style and defense of irrationalism, and he believed that\nthe country needed a new philosophy that could diagnose the flaws in\nthe Mexican character, specifically one that committed Mexicans to\nuniversal values, especially the use of reason. Thus, although Ramos\nphilosophized about the Mexican character, he ultimately believed that\nMexican philosophy ought to be dedicated to the rigorous study of\nbeing human and the objective field of values. Ramos also became\ninterested in aesthetics and promoted the professionalization of\nphilosophy. Some of his most important works are: Perfil del\nhombre y la cultura en M\u00e9xico (1934), Hacia un nuevo\nhumanismo (1940), and Filosof\u00eda de la vida\nart\u00edstica (1950).\n\nNot all philosophers were enthusiastic about applying philosophy to\nMexican themes. For example, Francisco Larroyo was the main\nrepresentative of Neo-Kantianism in Mexico, and wrote many books in\ndefense of Neo-Kantian views on philosophy, science, and education,\nincluding La filosof\u00eda de los valores (1936) and\nLa l\u00f3gica de las ciencias (1938). Larroyo claimed that\nMexico\u2019s progress required a rigorous, rationalist, and\nscientific philosophy. Another well-known Neo-Kantian and Kelsenian\nwas Guillermo H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nAside from defending neo-Kantianism, some philosophers defended and\nrefined neo-Thomism, such as Oswaldo Robles, who sought to reconcile\nNeo-Thomism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis. Among his books we\nmight mention La teor\u00eda de la idea en Malebranche y la\ntradici\u00f3n filos\u00f3fica (1937) and Esquema de\nantropolog\u00eda filos\u00f3fica (1942).\n\nFinally, a complete history of the first half of the 20th\ncentury Mexican philosophy would be remiss if it did not discuss the\ndevelopment of Marxism in Mexico, particularly the work of Vicente\nLombardo Toledano. Like many of the intellectuals in our survey, the\nphilosophical contribution of Lombardo Toledano is complicated by the\nfact that he was, perhaps first and foremost, a labor leader and a\npolitician\u2014a scholar-activist\u2014and because he developed\nmany of his ideas through public debate and discourse (cf. the debate\nbetween Caso and Lombardo mentioned above). Nevertheless, Lombardo\nwrote one of the first philosophical analyses of the Mexican\nRevolution and his works are essential reading for those interested in\nMarxist interpretations of Mexican themes in the first half of the\n20th century.\n\nSome philosophers stretched the concept of philosophy to combine\nhistorical, philosophical, and literary analysis to both Mexican and\nuniversal themes. For instance, in his essay \u201cDel arte o de la\nmonstruosidad\u201d (1940), the distinguished historian and\nphilosopher Edmundo O\u2019Gorman maintained that the study of\nPre-Columbian art should be based on different categories from those\nused to evaluate European art. In Crisis y porvenir de la ciencia\nhist\u00f3rica (1947), he criticized positivist historiography\nfrom the point of view of historicism and existentialism, and set the\ntheoretical foundations for his subsequent notion of \u201cthe\ninvention of America\u201d. Likewise, while Alfonso Reyes\n(1889\u20131959) and Octavio Paz (1914\u20131998) were not\nprofessional philosophers, they authored texts that should not be\nexcluded from a history of Mexican philosophy. In El deslinde\n(1944), Reyes offered a theory of literature using tools of\nphenomenology and in El arco y la lira (1956), Paz wrote a\nliterary theory that used elements from existentialism and\nstructuralism.\n\nConcerning the professionalization of philosophy in Mexico, Eduardo\nGarc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez stands out both for his philosophical and\nfor his administrative contributions. In 1940\u201341, Garc\u00eda\nM\u00e1ynez founded and was the first director of the Centro de\nEstudios Filos\u00f3ficas, which was eventually renamed the\nInstituto de Investigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas, and he\nfounded the influential journal Filosf\u00eda y Letras,\nwhich continued to be published until 1958. His book Los\nprincipios de la ontolog\u00eda formal del derecho y su\nexpresi\u00f3n simb\u00f3lica (1953) marked the beginning of\nthe logical turn in Mexican philosophy, anticipating the linguistic\nturn of analytic philosophy in Mexico a decade later. Some of his\nother works include: La definici\u00f3n del derecho. Ensayo de\nperspectivismo jur\u00eddico (1948) and Filosof\u00eda\ndel derecho (1974). Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez claimed that the\nvalidity of the law depends on the existence of objective values, but\nhe added that, in spite of their objectivity, values are subject to\nseveral forms of relativism in relation to culture, concrete practice,\nand geography. Like Ramos, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1ynez believed Mexico\nneeded an objectivist axiology to progress socially. He also claimed\nthat legal freedom was a \u201csecond order\u201d right, that is, a\nnormative right to exercise certain independent faculties through\nchoice. The development of this thesis forced him to sustain that any\nsystem of normativity that is axiomatic and formal contains a\npriori principles. His \u201ctheory of the three circles\u201d\nmaintains that the definitions of law as formally valid, as\nintrinsically valid, and as a positive right are not theoretically\ncompatible, though they are compatible in practice.\n8.3. The Spanish Exiles\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) forced some of the most\nprominent Spanish philosophers to move to Mexico. Joaqu\u00edn Xirau\n(1895\u20131946), Jos\u00e9 Gallegos Rocafull (1895\u20131963),\nWenceslao Roces (1897\u20131992), Jos\u00e9 Gaos (1900\u20131969),\nLuis Recasens Siches (1903\u20131977), Eugenio \u00cdmaz\n(1900\u20131951) and Eduardo Nicol (1907\u20131990), would live,\nspend their careers, and die in Mexico. Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca\n(1901\u20131992) and Mar\u00eda Zambrano (1907\u20131991) spent\npart of their exile in Mexico. Adolfo S\u00e1nchez V\u00e1zquez\n(1915\u20132011), Ram\u00f3n Xirau (1924\u20132017), and Carmen\nRovira (b. 1923) arrived in Mexico at a young age, and completed their\nstudies in their newly adopted country. All of them left a valuable\nimprint on Mexican philosophy through their creativity, teaching, and\ntranslations.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Xirau wrote several books on metaphysics, the history\nof philosophy, and the philosophy of education. After arriving in\nMexico, he wrote Amor y mundo (1940), a reflection on love\nunderstood as Eros and caritas. His ontology is\ndialectical, and he claims that being and value, as well as subject\nand object, are merely abstract ideas if they are considered static\nrealities outside change. His premature death at the age of 50\nprevented him from being more influential than he should have\nbeen.\n\nJos\u00e9 Gaos wrote the majority of his published material in\nMexico, and he is remembered, above all, for his extraordinary\ninfluence as a professor and mentor. For his own part, Gaos defended a\nradical version of perspectivism: for Gaos, philosophy is a personal\nconfession, so no philosophy is better or worse than another since\neach is, in the end, the expression of an individual. His most\nimportant works are: Del hombre (1970) and De la\nfilosof\u00eda (1962). His research in the history of ideas in\nMexico and Latin America were also extremely influential. His ideas on\nhow to teach philosophy were included in the curricula of several\ndepartments of philosophy throughout the country. Among his students\nwere some of the most important philosophers of the second half of the\n20th century.\n\nLuis Recasens Siches, a philosopher of law, wrote many books in which\nthe influence of Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset was apparent. Among them\nis Vida humana, sociedad y derecho (1940).\n\nEduardo Nicol founded the Metaphysics Seminar at the Department of\nPhilosophy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he\ntaught with rigor and brilliance, and in 1955 he founded the\ninfluential journal Dianoia, still published today. For\nNicol, philosophy ought to recover its place as the primary science.\nHis metaphysics, dialectical in essence, wanted to reconcile being and\nrepresentation, and truth and history. All of his works were written\nin Mexico, including: La idea del hombre (1946),\nMetaf\u00edsica de la expresi\u00f3n (1957), and Los\nprincipios de la ciencia (1965).\n8.4. The Hyperion Group\n\nIn 1934, Samuel Ramos published one of the most important books on\nMexican culture, Perfil del hombre y la cultura en\nM\u00e9xico, an analysis of history, culture, and the Mexican\ncharacter, which he believed suffered from an inferiority complex.\nAccording to Ramos, Mexicans had set goals that were impossible to\naccomplish, particularly because they had tried to imitate more\ndeveloped nations, and this had instilled in them a feeling of\ninferiority that explains their individual and collective behavior, as\nwell as many of the problems of Mexican society and politics.\nRamos\u2019s book was very controversial and prompted similar studies\nof Mexican being, such as Octavio Paz\u2019s El laberinto de la\nsoledad (1950).\n\nThe Hyperion Group was a group of young philosophers from the National\nAutonomous University of Mexico that included Leopoldo Zea\n(1912\u20132006), Jorge Portilla (1918\u20131963), Ricardo Guerra\n(1928\u20132007), Emilio Uranga (1921\u20131988), and Luis Villoro\n(1922\u20132014). It was active between 1948 and 1952, and its\npurpose was to employ the categories of existentialism to analyze\nMexico and Mexican being, an analysis that was meant to reveal the\nreality of Mexico and Mexican being and encourage Mexicans to\ntransform their reality.\n\nJorge Portilla\u2019s posthumously\npublished Fenomenolog\u00eda del relajo (1966) is a\nphenomenological study of the complexity of Mexican morality and\nbehavior.\n\nArguably the most important work of the Hyperion group was\nAn\u00e1lisis del ser del mexicano (1952) by Emilio Uranga.\nThis book proposes an ontology of mexicanidad and a\nphilosophy of Mexican culture. According to Uranga, the negative\ntraits that characterize the Mexican, such as resentment, melancholy,\nand zozobra, are expressions of a constitutive mode of\nMexican existence that he calls \u201caccidentality\u201d. (Here\nUranga is employing the Scholastic distinction between accident and\nsubstance.) Uranga argues further that although Mexicans had been made\nto feel inferior throughout their history\u2014specifically, although\nEuropeans had argued that Mexicans were less than fully\nhuman\u2014Mexicans were in fact closer to the essence of being\nhuman, defined as accidentality. As a result, it was the European who\nhad a lesson to learn from the Mexican, not the other way around. If\nthe Conquest of Mexico tried to assimilate Mexican culture to European\nculture, what Uranga did was try to assimilate the whole of what it\nmeans to be human to the Mexican experience of humanity, that is, to\nmake humanity recognize and value its repressed accidentality. By\nidentifying mexicanidad with accidentality, Uranga transforms\nMexican being into an ontological category.\n\nThe filosof\u00eda de lo mexicano (the philosophy of\nMexicanness) was a creative and original movement that impacted other\nareas of culture. However, after the 1960s the desire to treat Mexico\nas the object of philosophical inquiry declined, and it is only in the\nlast few years that a small group of Mexican and Mexican-American\nphilosophers have, in collaboration, attempted to rescue elements of\nthat movement to think about Mexico from a philosophical point of view\nand to think about philosophy from a Mexican point of view.\n8.5. Leopoldo Zea\n\nLeopoldo Zea was the most influential Mexican philosopher in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, particularly in Latin\nAmerica and the former Soviet Bloc. Some of his books are: El\npositivismo en M\u00e9xico (1943), Am\u00e9rica en la\nhistoria (1957), La filosof\u00eda americana como\nfilosof\u00eda sin m\u00e1s (1969), and Discurso desde la\nmarginaci\u00f3n y la barbarie (1988).\n\nIn his essay \u201cEn torno a una filosof\u00eda americana\u201d\n(1945), Zea sustained that Latin American philosophy should devote\nitself to topics that are specifically Latin American, in addition to\nthe universal problems of any other philosophy. In \u201cLa\nfilosof\u00eda como compromiso\u201d (1948), he claims that Latin\nAmerican philosophy should aim to transform the reality of the\nphilosopher, not just understand it. From that point forward,\nZea\u2019s work adopts a clearly defined ideological and political\npurpose of emancipating Latin America and the \u201cThird\nWorld\u201d.\n\nIn a word, Zea considers philosophy an instrument of liberation. He\nstrongly objected to a Eurocentric account of human nature, history,\nand reason\u2014a critique that would evolve more fully decades later\nwith postmodernism and post-colonialism. During most of the second\nhalf of the 20th century, Zea promoted \u201cLatin\nAmerican philosophy\u201d, understood as an academic discipline that\ncombines the interdisciplinary study of society, thought, and history\nin this region of the world.\n\nOther Mexican philosophers who have contributed to the development of\nLatin American philosophy are Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez McGregor\n(1925\u20132008), Abelardo Villegas (1934\u20132001), Mario\nMagall\u00f3n Anaya (b. 1946) and Horacio Cerutti (b. 1950).\n8.6. Luis Villoro\n\nLuis Villoro was a diligent student of the most important\nphilosophical currents of the second half of the 20th\ncentury: existentialism, phenomenology, Marxism, analytic philosophy,\nand multiculturalism. However, in his reflections one can observe a\ncommon thread of lasting questions concerning the metaphysical\nunderstanding of alterity, the limits and boundaries of reason, the\nrelationship between knowledge and power, community, an ethical\nreflection of injustice, a defense of and respect for cultural\ndiversity, and a critical examination of the role of philosophy. Some\nof his books are: Los grandes momentos del indigenismo en\nM\u00e9xico (1950), Creer, saber, conocer (1982),\nEl concepto de ideolog\u00eda (1985), and El poder y el\nvalor (1997).\n\nIn Creer, saber, conocer, a book that belongs to the\nanalytical tradition, Villoro develops an epistemology that eliminates\ntruth from the definition of knowledge in order to make sense of the\nhistorical and political dimensions of epistemology in practice. For\nVilloro, \u201cto know p\u201d is \u201cto believe p\nwith sufficiently objective reasons\u201d. And one\u2019s reasons\nfor believing that p are sufficiently objective if they are\nconclusive, complete, and coherent, regardless of who\nsustains p.  However, one\u2019s reasons can be sufficiently\nobjective in one epistemic community but not another. This leads to an\nepistemic relativism accepted by Villoro as the only way to respond to\nthe challenge of skepticism (see related entry on\n epistemology in Latin America).\n In \u201cFilosof\u00eda y dominaci\u00f3n\u201d (1978), he\nsustained that philosophy must always critique inherited and imposed\nbeliefs by exercising the independent use of reason, that is, without\nbecoming ideological.\n\nIn El poder y el valor, Villoro reflects on the nature of\npolitical power and moral values. After a comprehensive and insightful\nanalysis, Villoro sustains that we should give priority to the values\nthat bind individuals to their community, without, of course,\nundermining either individual freedom or social order. Ultimately,\nVilloro defends a form of radical democracy according to which\npolitical power is concentrated in the hands of ordinary people\nimmersed in concrete social networks. Villoro believed that indigenous\ncommunities of Mexico are a living model of the variety of social and\npolitical egalitarianism he endorsed, and any intellectual biography\nof Villoro would be incomplete without mentioning that Villoro was a\nsecret member of The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and had a\nphilosophically rich correspondence with Subcomandante Marcos.\n8.7. The Years of Expansion (1960\u20132000)\n\nIn the 20th century, several Mexican philosophers developed\nforms of humanism and metaphysics from perspectives as dissimilar as\nHellenism, Thomism, and existentialism.\n\nAntonio G\u00f3mez Robledo (1908\u20131994) was a distinguished\nhumanist and jurist who studied and defended the value of Greco-Latin\nand Christian cultures elegantly and non-dogmatically. Among his works\nare: Ensayo sobre las virtudes intelectuales (1957),\nMeditaci\u00f3n sobre la justicia (1963), and\nS\u00f3crates y el socratismo (1966). He also translated\nPlato\u2019s Republic, Aristotle\u2019s Politics,\nMarcus Aurelius\u2019 Meditations, and other classics. His\nstudies of the principles of international law and the Spanish\ntradition of law should also be included in the history of Mexican\nphilosophy.\n\nRam\u00f3n Xirau wrote philosophy, literary criticism, and poetry,\nand combined them in enriching ways. Xirau wrote about the\nrelationship between philosophy and poetry as two different forms of\nknowledge, and about the ontological nature of being human,\nunderstanding ser and estar as different categories.\nAmong his best-known books are: Introducci\u00f3n a la historia\nde la filosof\u00eda (1964), Poes\u00eda y\nconocimiento (1979), and El tiempo vivido (1985).\n\nJuliana Gonz\u00e1lez (b. 1936) was a student of Eduardo Nicol. She\nhas taught and written about the main problems of philosophical and\nmoral anthropology as well as about Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger.\nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s ethics are grounded in a complex vision of the\nhuman being, which emphasizes our capacity to choose. Gonz\u00e1lez\nhas also dealt with the ethical and metaphysical dimension of\npsychoanalysis and genomics. Some of her books include\n\u00c9tica y libertad (1989a), El malestar en la\nmoral (1989b), and El poder del Eros (1999).\n\nCarmen Rovira (b. 1923) was a student of Gaos. Over the course of her\nlong academic career, she has labored to introduce and analyze the\nhistory of ideas in Mexico, particularly medieval philosophy in\nMexico. In addition to all her edited collections, Rovira authored\nEcl\u00e9cticos portugueses del siglo XVIII y algunas de sus\ninfluencias en Am\u00e9rica (1958) and Francisco de\nVitoria. Espa\u00f1a y Am\u00e9rica. El poder y el\nhombre (2004).\n\nElsa Cecilia Frost (1928\u20132005) was also a student of Gaos, as\nwas O\u2019Gorman and Leon-Portilla. Her main interests lay with the\nhistory of colonial philosophy and the processes of acculturation that\ncreated modern Mexican culture. Her text Categorias de la cultura\nmexicana (1972) is a widely studied and well-regarded text in the\nphilosophy of Mexican culture.\n\nJos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez Villase\u00f1or (1911\u20131961),\nFernando Sodi Pallares (1917\u20131980), H\u00e9ctor\nGonz\u00e1lez Uribe (1918\u20131988), Jos\u00e9 Sanabria\n(1924\u20132002) and Miguel Mansur (1928\u20131993) all taught\nNeo-Thomism at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Carlos Llano\n(1932\u20132010), Virginia Aspe (b. 1952), H\u00e9ctor Zagal (b.\n1963) and Luis Xavier L\u00f3pez Farjeat (b. 1973) all studied the\nAristotelian tradition at the Universidad Panamericana. In Monterrey,\nAgust\u00edn Basave Fern\u00e1ndez del Valle (1923\u20132006),\ndeveloped what he called an integralismo metaf\u00edsico\nantropos\u00f3fico. Among his many books we can single out\nTratado de metaf\u00edsica. Teor\u00eda de la habencia\n(1982).\n\nSocialist and Marxist thought was a popular ideology during the\nMexican Revolution. In addition to the work of Lombardo Toledano who\nemployed a Marxist framework to explain Mexico\u2019s situation,\nJos\u00e9 Revueltas (1914\u20131976) was an unorthodox Marxist who\ndiscussed philosophical themes in his literary and political writings.\nDespite the influence of Lombardo and Revueltas, however, academics\ndidn\u2019t take Marxism seriously until the 1970s. Two central\nfigures of Marxism in the Mexican academy during that period were Eli\nde Gortari (1918\u20131991) and Adolfo S\u00e1nchez\nV\u00e1zquez.\n\nDe Gortari was one of the first academic philosophers of science in\nMexico. He studied the foundation of dialectical logic and the\napplications of logic to science, and worked on the philosophy of\nmathematics and physics, the mechanization of propositional calculus,\nand the history of science in Mexico. In 1955 he founded the Seminar\nof Scientific and Philosophical Problems. Among his books are La\nciencia de la l\u00f3gica (1950) and Dial\u00e9ctica de\nla F\u00edsica (1964).\n\nAdolfo S\u00e1nchez V\u00e1zquez was very young when he arrived in\nMexico and he began his philosophical studies in Mexico. He produced a\nsolid body of work dealing with the concepts of Marxist ethics and\naesthetics. One contribution to Marxist philosophy was his critical\nreflection on the concept of praxis, and he was critical of\nthe aesthetic doctrine of Socialist realism. Among his main books we\ncan mention: Las ideas est\u00e9ticas de Marx (1965),\nUna filosof\u00eda de la praxis (1967), and\n\u00c9tica (1969). Many Mexican Marxist philosophers of\nsubsequent generations studied under him, and there was an important\ndebate between S\u00e1nchez Vazquez and Villoro concerning the\nconcept of ideology.\n\nThe Cuban Revolution had a profound impact among many Latin American\nintellectuals. After the 1960s, the number of Marxists increased\nexponentially, both at and outside the university, and Marxism became\nthe dominant school of thought in some Mexican universities. The books\nof Gramsci, Marcuse, and Althusser were read by many young students,\nas were the writings of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9\nCarlos Mari\u00e1tegu\u00ed and Paolo Freire. The main Mexican\nMarxist philosophers of that period were: Porfirio Miranda\n(1924\u20132001), author of Marx y la Biblia (1971); Enrique\nGonz\u00e1lez Rojo (b. 1928); Ces\u00e1reo Morales (b. 1936);\nJaime Labastida (b. 1940), author of Producci\u00f3n, ciencia y\nsociedad: de Descartes a Marx (1969); Gabriel Vargas Lozano (b.\n1947), author of M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del derrumbre (1994);\nand Aureliano Ortega (b. 1952). Carlos Pereyra (1940\u20131988) was a\nphilosopher of history and a well-known left-wing intellectual. His\nphilosophical papers were collected in Filosof\u00eda, historia\ny pol\u00edtica (2010). Bol\u00edvar Echeverr\u00eda\n(1941\u20132010) wrote La modernidad de lo barroco (1998),\nin which he offers a critique of capitalist modernity from a Latin\nAmerican perspective.\n\nMentioned above, Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n Vicente (b.\n1957), also known as \u201cSubcomandante Marcos\u201d of the EZLN,\nhas been a very influential post-Marxist thinker who has put his ideas\ninto action. His correspondence with Luis Villoro is included in\nLa alternativa. Perspectiva y posibilidades de cambio\n(Villoro 2015).\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall there was an abrupt decline in\nMarxist philosophy. As intellectuals debated how best to reform the\nMexican state, they began to read other foreign political\nphilosophers, such as Weber, Arendt, Rawls, Bobbio and Habermas. Some\nof the philosophers who have focused on the nature of democracy,\njustice, and poverty include: Luis Aguilar Villanueva (b. 1938);\nPaulette Dieterlen (b. 1947), author of La pobreza: un estudio\nfilos\u00f3fico (2003); Luis Salazar (b. 1949); Le\u00f3n\nOliv\u00e9 (1950\u20132017); Griselda Guti\u00e9rrez (1951);\nMar\u00eda P\u00eda Lara (b. 1954), author of Moral\ntextures (1998); Ambrosio Velasco (b. 1954); Rodolfo\nV\u00e1zquez (b. 1956), author of Entre la libertad y la\nigualdad (2006); Mario Teodoro Ram\u00edrez (b. 1958), author\nof De la raz\u00f3n a la praxis (2003); and Enrique Serrano\n(b. 1958).\n\nMexican political philosophy played an important role in two public\ndebates of that period. One concerned the extent to which leftist\npolitical groups were willing accept electoral democracy as opposed to\narmed revolution, like that of Cuba. Another concerned whether Mexico\nwas better described as a homogenous mestizo nation or a racially and\nculturally diverse country.\n\nThe philosophy of liberation was a movement that originated in South\nAmerica in the early 1970s. In the beginning, it mixed elements of\nliberation theology, dependency theory, and Latin American philosophy.\nEnrique Dussel (b. 1934 in Argentina) is the main representative of\nthe philosophy of liberation in Mexico. Among his numerous works,\nwhich have been translated widely into other languages, are\nFilosof\u00eda de la liberaci\u00f3n (1977 [2003]) and\n\u00c9tica de la liberaci\u00f3n en la edad de la\nglobalizaci\u00f3n y la exclusi\u00f3n (1998 [2013]). Dussel\nhas offered a comprehensive critique of Western history and philosophy\nfrom the point of view of the poor and the excluded, particularly in\nLatin America. The Dusselian branch of the filosof\u00eda de la\nliberaci\u00f3n is a vigorous movement with students all over\nthe world. (See the related entry on\n the philosophy of liberation)\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, philosophers began to study analytic\nphilosophy, particularly authors such as Russell, Carnap,\nWittgenstein, Strawson, and Quine. At the time, it was claimed that a\nphilosophy inspired by science was required to modernize Mexico, not\nunlike the positivist turn in the second half of the 19th\ncentury. The creation of the journal Cr\u00edtica in 1967\naccelerated the popularity of analytic philosophy in Mexico. At the\nend of the 1960s, the Institute for Philosophical Research of the\nNational Autonomous University of Mexico became the main center of\nanalytic philosophy in the country and in Latin America. The main\npromoters of analytic philosophy during that period were Alejandro\nRossi (1932\u20132009), author of Lenguaje y significado\n(1969), and Fernando Salmer\u00f3n (1925\u20131997), who also wrote\nextensively on the history of Mexican philosophy.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, a group of analytic philosophers had\ndistinguished themselves: Enrique Villanueva (b. 1938), Jos\u00e9\nAntonio Robles (1938\u20132014), Margarita Vald\u00e9s (b. 1941),\nHugo Marg\u00e1in (1942\u20131978), and Olbeth Hansberg (b. 1943),\nauthor of La diversidad de las emociones (b. 1996). In the\n1980s, more analytic philosophers joined the Institute of\nPhilosophical research, among them: Ra\u00fal Orayen\n(1942\u20132003), who wrote L\u00f3gica, significado y\nontolog\u00eda (1989); Ulises Moulines (b. 1946), a\nstructuralist philosopher of science; Mark Platts (b. 1947), author of\nWays of Meaning (1979); Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9\n(1950\u20132017), who wrote several books of philosophy of science\nand culture; and Adolfo Garc\u00eda de la Sienra (b. 1951), a\ntheologian and philosopher of economics.\n\nMexican analytic philosophy has followed the dominant trends of\nanalytic philosophy since the 1960s. In the beginning, it had strong\nties to Oxford, but today it has developed working relationships with\nother philosophical departments around the world. Some Mexican\nanalytic philosophers have studied abroad and have remained outside\nMexico, such as Agust\u00edn Rayo (b. 1973). Others work in Mexico\nbut publish most of their work in English, such as Mario G\u00f3mez\nTorrente (b. 1967). Others write in both English and Spanish, such as\nMayt\u00e9 Ezcurdia (1966\u20132018). Still others write mainly in\nSpanish, like Alejandro Tomasini Bassols (b. 1952), who has written a large\nnumber of books that develop an original interpretation of\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy.\n\nCarlos Pereda (b. 1944) has also written several important books,\nincluding V\u00e9rtigos argumentales (1994),\nCr\u00edtica de la raz\u00f3n arrogante (1999), and\nSobre la confianza (2009). He develops Aristotle\u2019s\nnotion of phronesis and Kant\u2019s view that practical\nreason is universal to recommend strategies to help navigate the\ntemptations and ambiguities of life. Pereda offers a peculiar\ndiagnosis of the entanglements and pathologies of reason, including\nwhat he calls argumentative vertigo, that is, a kind of\nintellectual or moral dizziness that blinds us to other points of view\nor that makes us stubborn and insensitive to the feelings of\nothers.\n\nThe main exponent of philosophical hermeneutics, Mauricio Beuchot (b.\n1950), distinguished himself early as a historian and a translator of\nthe philosophy of New Spain and medieval philosophy (e.g., La\nfilosof\u00eda del lenguaje en la Edad Media, 1981), as well as\nfor his synthesis of Thomism and analytic philosophy (e.g.,\nL\u00f3gica y ontolog\u00eda, 1986). In the 1990s,\nhowever, he turned to hermeneutics. In his Tratado de\nhermen\u00e9utica anal\u00f3gica (1997), he developed a\nsystem that he called \u201canalogical hermeneutics\u201d. His\nthesis is that, to avoid the excesses of positivist\n\u201cunivocalism\u201d or postmodern \u201cequivocalism\u201d,\none must adopt analogy as the primary method of interpretation.\nBeuchot\u2019s analogical hermeneutics has inspired a philosophical\nmovement with hundreds of students around the world.\n\nAlthough Mexican women have had full legal access to higher education\nsince the beginning of the 20th century, they were\ndiscouraged from pursuing advanced degrees or careers as professors of\nphilosophy. With a few notable exceptions, it wasn\u2019t until after\n1960\u2014not incidentally, the year birth control was made widely\navailable\u2014that women began to publish their own philosophy more\nregularly. In addition to several of the women mentioned above (e.g.,\nKrauze, Frost, Rovira), Vera Yamuni Tabush (1917\u20132003), another\nstudent of Gaos, wrote about philosophy in the Spanish language,\nArabic philosophy, and feminism. See, for example, her highly-regarded\nConceptos e im\u00e1genes en pensadores de lengua\nespa\u00f1ola (1951).\n\nAs women started to pursue advanced degrees in philosophy, they began\nto philosophize about the role of women in Mexican culture and the\nchallenges facing aspiring female intellectuals and artists. The long\nlist of Mexican feminists, which stretches back as far as Sor Juana,\nincludes Paula G\u00f3mez Alonso (1896\u20131972), the first\ngraduate of philosophy of the University of M\u00e9xico, whose\nmaster\u2019s thesis was titled La cultura femenina (1933);\nRosario Castellanos (1925\u20131974), a famous author, who wrote a\nphilosophical essay called Sobre cultura femenina (1950); and\nGraciela Hierro (1928\u20132003), the main proponent of feminist\nphilosophy and founder of the Centro de Estudios de G\u00e9nero of\nthe National Autonomous University of Mexico. Two of her books are\n\u00c9tica y feminismo (1985), and De la\ndomesticaci\u00f3n a la educaci\u00f3n de las mexicanas\n(1989).\n\nAs in other Latin American countries, the history of philosophy is a\npopular area of research, largely because most philosophy departments\ntend to teach the discipline from a historical rather than thematic or\nanalytic perspective. The most popular periods of philosophy are\nancient philosophy, modern philosophy, phenomenology, and German\nexistentialism. Among the historians of philosophy today, we can\nmention: Laura Benitez (b. 1944), Alberto Constante (b. 1949), Antonio\nZiri\u00f3n (b. 1950), Enrique H\u00fclsz (1954\u20132019), Gustavo\nLeyva (b. 1959), Pedro Stepanenko (b. 1960), Efra\u00edn Lazos (b.\n1962), Ernesto Priani (b. 1962), Ricardo Salles (b. 1965), Faviola\nRivera (b. 1967), and \u00c1ngel Xolocotzi (b. 1969).\n9. The 21st Century\n\nNot unlike other areas of Mexican culture, the production of\nphilosophy has been concentrated in Mexico City. However, today dozens\nof philosophy departments throughout the Mexican Republic are growing\nin size and influence. Many universities now offer graduate degrees\nand some publish their own journals and books, such as the state\nuniversities of Guanajuato, Michoac\u00e1n, Puebla, Veracruz, and\nZacatecas.\n\nThere are several philosophical associations in Mexico, though the\nAsociaci\u00f3n filos\u00f3fica de M\u00e9xico is the\nlargest. Since 1975, the AFM (which serves a role similar to the\nAmerican Philosophical Association (in the United States) hosts a\nlarge biannual conference that plays an essential role in forming a\nnational philosophical community (see\n Other Internet Resources below).\n\nPhilosophy also continues to play an important role in Mexican\nsecondary education. Although philosophy has been taught in public\nhigh schools since the 19th century, in 2009 the Mexican\ngovernment tried to eliminate philosophical instruction from public\neducation (not unlike the second half of the 19th century\nunder the guidance of Barreda\u2019s positivist curriculum, and\nCardenas\u2019s attempt to make education in Mexico socialist in\n1933). However, in response, a group of academics founded the\nObservatorio Filos\u00f3fico de M\u00e9xico, which\neventually thwarted government interference (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The Observatorio\u2019s defense of philosophy in Mexico was\nso successful that in 2019, the government made a constitutional\namendment recognizing philosophical instruction as the right of all\nMexicans.\n\nThis official commitment to the value of philosophy is not without\nprecedent; it represents a long history of questioning and reaffirming\nthe role of philosophy in Mexican life. Other events in this history\n(discussed above) include the war for Mexican independence, guided by\nEnlightenment philosophy; Gabino Barreda\u2019s effort to define\nMexican national identity through positivist education; the\nAteneo\u2019s critique of positivism during the Mexican\nRevolution; amendments to the 1933 Constitution, which sought to make\npublic education socialist; and the philosophy of lo\nmexicano, a philosophical expression and critique of\n20th century Mexican nationalism.\n\nOne challenge to studying Mexican philosophy outside Mexico,\nparticularly in the United States, has been the lack of resources in\nEnglish. However, over the past several years, a group of scholars\nhave begun to produce translations of and commentaries on canonical\ntexts. One notable example is Mexican Philosophy in the\n20th Century: Essential Readings, edited by Carlos\nAlberto S\u00e1nchez and Robert Eli Sanchez, Jr. (For future\nprojects related to making Mexican philosophy more widely available in\nEnglish, and related to building a binational community dedicate to\nthe development of Mexican philosophy, see\n 20th Century Mexican Philosophy in Other Internet Resources.)\n The APA\u2019s Newsletter on Hispanic and Latino Issues in\nPhilosophy is another valuable source of information and research\n(see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nToday, Mexican philosophy is a professional, pluralistic, and growing\nfield of study. Thanks in large part to the collaboration among\nphilosophers in Mexico and United States, the resources required to\nadvance research are now easily accessible in both Spanish and\nEnglish. And with the ongoing emergence of new translations,\ncommentaries, and histories, as well as regular binational meetings,\nit is now reasonable to expect that the philosophy produced in Mexico\nand about the Mexican (or Mexican-American) experience will continue\nto attract new scholars and will soon be recognized for its impressive\ncontribution to world philosophy.",
