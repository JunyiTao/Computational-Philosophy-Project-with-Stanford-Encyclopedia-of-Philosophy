    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument\n4. Replies to the Chinese Room Argument\n\nCriticisms of the narrow Chinese Room argument against Strong AI have\noften followed three main lines, which can be distinguished by how\nmuch they concede:\n\n(1) Some critics concede that the man in the room doesn\u2019t\nunderstand Chinese, but hold that nevertheless running the program may\ncreate comprehension of Chinese by something other than the room\noperator. These critics object to the inference from the claim that\nthe man in the room does not understand Chinese to the\nconclusion that no understanding has been created. There might\nbe understanding by a larger, smaller, or different, entity. This is\nthe strategy of The Systems Reply and the Virtual Mind Reply. These\nreplies hold that the output of the room might reflect real\nunderstanding of Chinese, but the understanding would not be that of\nthe room operator. Thus Searle\u2019s claim that he doesn\u2019t\nunderstand Chinese while running the room is conceded, but his claim\nthat there is no understanding of the questions in Chinese, and that\ncomputationalism is false, is denied.\n\n(2) Other critics concede Searle\u2019s claim that just running a\nnatural language processing program as described in the CR scenario\ndoes not create any understanding, whether by a human or a computer\nsystem. But these critics hold that a variation on the\ncomputer system could understand. The variant might be a computer\nembedded in a robotic body, having interaction with the physical world\nvia sensors and motors (\u201cThe Robot Reply\u201d), or it might be\na system that simulated the detailed operation of an entire human\nbrain, neuron by neuron (\u201cthe Brain Simulator Reply\u201d).\n\n\n(3) Finally, some critics do not concede even the narrow point against\nAI. These critics hold that the man in the original Chinese Room\nscenario might understand Chinese, despite Searle\u2019s denials, or\nthat the scenario is impossible. For example, critics have argued that\nour intuitions in such cases are unreliable. Other critics have held\nthat it all depends on what one means by \u201cunderstand\u201d\n\u2013 points discussed in the section on The Intuition Reply. Others\n(e.g. Sprevak 2007) object to the assumption that any system (e.g.\nSearle in the room) can run any computer program. And finally some\nhave argued that if it is not reasonable to attribute understanding on\nthe basis of the behavior exhibited by the Chinese Room, then it would\nnot be reasonable to attribute understanding to humans on the basis of\nsimilar behavioral evidence (Searle calls this last the \u201cOther\nMinds Reply\u201d). The objection is that we should be willing to\nattribute understanding in the Chinese Room on the basis of the overt\nbehavior, just as we do with other humans (and some animals), and as\nwe would do with extra-terrestrial Aliens (or burning bushes or\nangels) that spoke our language. This position is close to\nTuring\u2019s own, when he proposed his behavioral test for machine\nintelligence.\n\nIn addition to these responses specifically to the Chinese Room\nscenario and the narrow argument to be discussed here, some critics\nalso independently argue against Searle\u2019s larger claim, and hold\nthat one can get semantics (that is, meaning) from syntactic symbol\nmanipulation, including the sort that takes place inside a digital\ncomputer, a question discussed in the section below on Syntax and\nSemantics.\n",
