    "main_text": "The Roman Republic and Cicero\n6. The Roman Republic and Cicero\n\nWhile the founders of the city of Rome were said to be the legendary\ntwins Romulus and Remus, Romans would come to identify the origins of\ntheir distinctive liberty in the killing of a tyrannical king,\ngenerally dated in 509 BCE, by the ancestor of the Junius Brutus who\nwould eventually kill Julius Caesar. The position of king was replaced\nby two annually elected consuls, the royal council became the Senate,\nand popular assemblies were established to elect magistrates and pass\nthe laws they proposed. By Cicero\u2019s time, this\nregime\u2014self-identified as the S.P.Q.R., the \u201cSenatus\npopulusque Romanus\u201d or \u201cSenate and people of\n Rome\u201d[13]\u2013\n had become interpreted as a version of the \u201cmixed\nconstitution\u201d which had had a long if complicated and until then\nrelatively minor history as an idea in the works of Thucydides, Plato,\nand Aristotle (Hahm 2009). An influential account of Rome as such a\nmixed constitution, in this case combining the three classical regime\nforms of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, had already been given\nby the Greek historian Polybius, who referred to the distinction\nbetween the characteristic powers in each kind of regime and their\nmutual checking and balancing (Histories 6.11\u201318; see\nvon Fritz 1954). Whereas in Polybius the achievement of balance\nbetween the different powers was portrayed as resulting from mutual\nrivalrous self-assertion, Cicero would refer to it in more harmonious\nlanguage, a form of balancing (compensatio, De rep.\nII. 57) with the ideas of mixing and tempering paramount, as observed\nby E.M. Atkins (2000: 491). (For a useful overview of Roman political\nthought, see J.W. Atkins 2018.)\n\nAccording to Polybius, each element of the constitution exercised a\ndistinctive form of power. The elected consuls wielded\nimperium, a form of executive command; the Senate enjoyed the\npower to deliberate and consent to specific policies; and the popular\nassemblies served as the source of authoritative law, also electing\nthe magistrates, including the popular tribunes who in turn exercised\nveto powers over the Senate. An originally republican formula relating\nthe consuls to the people as the source of authoritative law survives\nin a complete prescript of the Augustan period: \u201cTitus Quinctius\nCrispinus [consul] lawfully asked the people, and the people lawfully\nresolved,\u201d as translated in Lintott 1999: 3. Moreover, the\ntumultuous personal quest for office and influence led many\naristocrats and politically ambitious men to seek support among the\npeople, sometimes with radical measures of land reform which Cicero,\namong others, would resolutely oppose. The theorizing of the proper\nrole of aristocratic leadership and Senatorial independence, together\nwith Platonic analogies for the requisite concord and harmony in the\ncity, would become central themes of Cicero\u2019s political\nphilosophy, as he wrote: \u201cWhat the musicians call harmony with\nrespect to song is concord in the state, the tightest and best bond of\nsafety in every republic; and that concord can never exist without\njustice\u201d (De rep. II.69.)\n",
