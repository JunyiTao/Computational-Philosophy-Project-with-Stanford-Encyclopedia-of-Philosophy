    "main_text": "Culture and Variation || The WEIRD Challenge\n2.1 The WEIRD Challenge\n\nA landmark paper published in 2010 consolidated and raised the\nvisibility of a cluster of issues surrounding the relationship between\nculture and cognitive science (J. Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan\n2010). It laid out the case that the vast majority of research in\npsychology used subjects who came from a very specific demographic;\nmost participants in psychological studies had been WEIRD, drawn from\nsocieties that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,\nDemocratic. Other premises of the argument pointed out that not only\nwas this a very narrowly circumscribed sample population, it was also\n(a) an exotic outlier group, especially from an historical\nperspective, that was nevertheless (b) typically treated by\nresearchers as representative of the species as a whole. Results from\nstudies done with WEIRD participants (and typically by WEIRD\ncognitive scientists) were commonly extrapolated, taken to be true of\nhuman beings in general, and thus to be illuminating universal\nfeatures of human psychological nature. The negative conclusion was\nthat this practice, widespread though it may be, is unjustified, and\nthat distressingly little was known about the range of variation in\nhuman cognition, motivation, and behavior, or about the mechanisms\nthat create and support it. This conclusion also implied that as far\nas was known, culture may have a much deeper and more\nprofound role in shaping human mentality than cognitive science had\nyet appreciated.\n\nThe paper was not the first to recognize many of the problems and\nchallenges it raised, but the acronym it introduced gave a\nrecognizable name to a movement that had been coalescing for some time\n(Shweder 1990, 2003; Markus & Kitayama 1991; Nisbett & Cohen\n1996; Rozin 2001; Nisbett 2003; Arnett 2008; also see Broesch et al.\n2020 for reflections about the entanglement of methodological and\nethical factors in cross-cultural research, and misgivings that the\nacronym WEIRD invites misleading binary thinking about cultural\nvariation). The importance of culture for understanding human minds\nand behaviors had long been central to some disciplines now\ncontributing to cognitive science, especially anthropology and\ncross-cultural psychology (Tylor 1871; Malinowksi 1931; Levi-Strauss\n1958; Triandis & Brislin 1984; Hofstede 1980; Greenfield 2000).\nCulture had also become integral to the application of biological\nthought to humans and human social behavior (Dawkins 1976, 1982; Tooby\n& Cosmides 1992; Laland, Odling-Smee, & Feldman 2000;\nGriffiths 2007) and had been central to the field of cultural\nevolution from its inception (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1981; R.\nBoyd & Richerson 1985; even Darwin 1871).\n\nThe paper helped consolidate and focus attention on a host of\nshortcomings that contemporary cognitive science is still coming to\nterms with (Apicella, Norenzayan, & Henrich 2020). Many are\nmethodological. Cognitive scientists concerned about culture and WEIRD\nsampling bias continue to debate the ideal role of theory in\nformulating hypotheses, interpreting results, and investigating the\ninteraction between minds and cultural influence in a number of other\nways (Muthukrishna & Henrich 2019; Muthukrishna, Bell, et al.\n2020; Barrett 2020; Rozin 2020; Sear 2020). Others seek to better\nintegrate historical evidence into the study of psychology (Turchin\n2015, 2018; J. Henrich 2020; Muthukrishna, Henrich, & Slingerland\n2021) and to clarify the best way to study the ontogenetic sources of\nvariation in development (Stotz 2010; Heyes 2018a; Amir &\nMcAuliffe 2020). Still others connect the discussion of WEIRD sampling\nbias to psychology\u2019s recent difficulties with replication\n(Fidler & Wilcox 2018), arguing that while having more\nexperimental participants and increased statistical power is, all else\nequal, a virtue, it is not a panacea, especially if those participants\nare all WEIRD. Rather, they urge that some questions about behavioral\nand psychological diversity can be more thoroughly addressed by using\nethnographic methods from anthropology alongside\npsychological experiments. In some cases, important insights about\nhuman variation can be won by using these combined methods to study a\nsmall but carefully chosen cultural group (N. Henrich & J. Henrich\n2007; K. Smith & Apicella 2020; Zefferman & Mathew 2020). In\nother cases, however, experimental approaches common to mainstream\ncognitive science may be unsuitable for such work, because the\ndefinition and operationalization of central constructs used to\ninvestigate phenomena associated with, e.g., intelligence or\nself-esteem may be difficult to apply, inhibiting rather than\nfacilitating genuine cross-cultural insight (Greenfield 1997; Joe\n2014; J. Henrich 2020).\n\nAppreciation of the blind spots and questionable inferences\nhighlighted by the WEIRD challenge has contributed to substantive\ntheorizing about minds as well. It has informed work focused on\nestablishing the existence and character of psychological variation,\nbut also made urgent the need to develop a more sophisticated range of\ntheoretical resources to explain that variation. Questions\nhere have often been framed using contemporary versions of the\ndistinction between innate and acquired traits (Carruthers et al.\n2005, 2006, 2007). While theses about the presence and significance of\ninnate mental characteristics have loomed large in the history of\nWestern thought (Samet 2008 [2019]; Markie & Folescu 2021), the\ndistinction and its attendant concepts are not philosophically\nunproblematic (Griffiths 2002; Mallon & Weinberg 2006; Griffiths\n& Machery 2008; Gross & Rey 2012). Nevertheless, much research\nhas sought to illuminate which aspects of mental structure and content\n(and even personality, see Gurven et al. 2013; Smaldino, Lukaszewski,\net al. 2019) might be part of a genetically shared, (quasi-)universal\nhuman psychological nature, and which aspects can vary between groups,\nand how much (Roughley 2021). Further efforts have been directed at\ndiscovering, of those aspects that are acquired and that do exhibit\nvariation, which are obtained via individual learning, and which are\nculturally \u2018inherited\u2019, acquired via (a particular type\nof) social learning. This framing has in turn brought increased\nscrutiny to the psychology of learning itself, and especially the\nstructure and provenance of those cognitive mechanisms that underlie\ndifferent forms of social transmission. Research on this front will be\nthe focus of\n Section 3.2\n and\n Section 3.3.\n",
