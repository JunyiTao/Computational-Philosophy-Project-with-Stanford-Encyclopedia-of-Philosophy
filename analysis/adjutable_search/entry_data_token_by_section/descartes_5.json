    "main_text": "Philosophical Development\n2. Philosophical Development\n\nIn general, it is rare for a philosopher\u2019s positions and\narguments to remain the same across an entire life. This means that,\nin reading philosophers\u2019 works and reconstructing their\narguments, one must pay attention to the place of each work in the\nphilosophical development of the author. Readers of Immanuel Kant are\naware of the basic distinction between his critical and precritical\nperiods. Readers of G. W. Leibniz are also aware of his philosophical\ndevelopment, although in his case there is less agreement on a\ndevelopmental scheme.\n\nScholars have proposed various schemes for dividing Descartes\u2019\nlife into periods. This entry adopts a relatively simple division\nbetween the era when mathematics provided the model for his method (in\nthe Rules) and the period after the \u201cmetaphysical\nturn\u201d of 1629, when his conception of the role of the intellect\nin acquiring knowledge changed to privilege purely intellectual\nintuitions. At this time, he also recognized that the truth of his\nspecial or particular hypotheses in natural philosophy was less than\ncertain and so was subject to confirmation through consequences (as\nmentioned in Sec. 1.3, above). In effect, he adopted what is now\ncalled a hypothetico-deductive scheme of confirmation, but with this\ndifference: the range of hypotheses was limited by his metaphysical\nconclusions concerning the essences of mind and matter, their union,\nand the role of God in creating and conserving the universe.\nConsequently, some hypotheses, such as the \u201csubstantial\nforms\u201d of the scholastics, were ruled out. Argumentative\ndifferences among the World, Discourse, and\nMeditations and Principles may then be ascribed to\nthe fact that, in the 1630s, Descartes had not yet presented his full\nmetaphysics and so adopted an empirical mode of justification for even\nthe first principles of his physics, whereas, after 1641, he appealed\nto his published metaphysics in securing those principles.\n\nOther scholars see things differently. John Schuster (1980) finds that\nthe epistemology of the Rules lasted into the 1630s and was\nsuperseded (unhappily, in his view) only by the metaphysical quest for\ncertainty of the Meditations. Daniel Garber (1992, 48) also\nholds that Descartes abandoned his early method only after the\nDiscourse. In contrast, Peter Machamer and J. E. McGuire\n(2006) believe that Descartes held natural philosophy to the standard\nof absolute certainty through the Meditations but admitted\ndefeat on that score at the end of Principles IV, adopting a\nlower standard of certainty for his particular hypotheses (such as the\nexplanation of magnetism by corkscrew-shaped particles). They see the\nPrinciples as marking Descartes\u2019 \u201cepistemic\nturn\u201d away from the methodological stance of realism about\nintuitive knowledge of substances that they find in the\nRules, Discourse, and Meditations.\n\nSome scholars who emphasize epistemology find that the main change in\nDescartes\u2019 intellectual development is the introduction of\nskeptical arguments in the Discourse and\nMeditations. Some interpreters, perhaps inspired by Richard\nPopkin (1979), believe that Descartes took the skeptical threat to\nknowledge quite seriously and sought to overcome it in the\nMeditations (e.g., Curley 1978). By contrast, in the\ninterpretive thread followed here, skeptical arguments were a\ncognitive tool used to guide the reader of the Meditations\ninto the correct cognitive frame of mind for grasping the first truths\nof metaphysics. An answer to skepticism was a side-effect of this\nfundamental aim.\n\nOther views of Descartes\u2019 development have arisen from new\nattention to the biological and physiological dimensions of his\nthought. A key element is Descartes\u2019 fascination with mechanical\nautomata and his use of the notion of a machine in characterizing\nliving things (Man 11:119\u201320, 130\u201331;\nMed. VI, 7:84). Here again the fundamental change occurs just\nafter the Rules; it is not a \u201cmetaphysical turn\u201d\nbut a turn toward automata as models for human and animal behavior.\nThese interpretations connect with Descartes\u2019 new theory of\nperception (Ben-Yami 2015) or his investigation of ordinary objects\nand living things as coherent unities (Brown and Normore 2019; see\nalso Des Chene 2001).\n",
