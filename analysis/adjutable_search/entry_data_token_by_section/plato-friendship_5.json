    "main_text": "The Art and Psychology of Love Explained\n6. Writing About Love\n\nAt the end of the Symposium, Alcibiades has gone off,\npresumably with the throng of Bacchic revelers, who burst into his\nlife as representatives of his overpowering love for the approval and\nflattery of the crowd. Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon are left\nbehind discussing tragedy and comedy: \u201cthe main point was that\nSocrates was trying to prove to them that the same man knows\n(epistasthai) how to write both comedy and tragedy, that\nsomeone who is by craft (techn\u00ea) a tragic poet is a\ncomic poet too\u201d (223d2\u20136).\n\nThe key words here, as we learn in the Ion, are\nepistasthai and techn\u00ea. Ordinary poets cannot\nwrite both comedy and tragedy, because they do not write out of\nknowledge and craft (techn\u00ea) but out of divine\ninspiration (Ion 534c5\u20136). If they did write out of\ncraft and knowledge, if they were craftsmen poets, they would\nbe able to write both comedy and tragedy, because opposites are always\nstudied by the same craft. Thus the comedic craft and the tragic craft\nwould have to be one and the same; just as one and the same craft,\nmedicine, deals with both sickness and health.\n\nSocrates tells us what a craftsman poet would be able to\nwrite, he does not tell us what he would write. Other\nPlatonic spokesmen are somewhat more forthcoming. \u201cWe ourselves\nare poets,\u201d the Athenian Stranger tells us in the Laws,\n\u201cwho have to the best of our ability created a tragedy that is\nthe finest and the best; at any rate, our entire constitution is\nconstructed as an imitation of the finest and best way of\nlife\u2014the very thing which we claim is the truest tragedy\u201d\n(817b1\u20135). Earlier in the same discussion, the Stranger is\nequally explicit that this same constitution, though not a comedy,\ndoes nonetheless embody comedic knowledge:\n\nSomeone who is going to gain practical wisdom can\u2019t learn\nserious matters without learning ridiculous ones, or anything else,\nfor that matter, without its opposite. But if we intend to acquire\nvirtue, even on a small scale, we can\u2019t be serious and comic\ntoo, and this is precisely why we must learn to recognize what is\nridiculous, to avoid being trapped by our ignorance of it into doing\nor saying something ridiculous, when we don\u2019t have to.\n(816d5-e5)\n\nThe Laws is a tragedy, then, because it is \u201can\nimitation of the finest and best way of life.\u201d\n\nThe Symposium is a tragedy for an analogous reason: it\ncontains an imitation of one part of such a life, namely, what the\nProtagoras terms a \u201csymposium of beautiful and good\nmen\u201d who \u201ctest each other\u2019s mettle in mutual\nargument\u201d by asking and answering questions (347d3\u2013348a9).\nThis is how Socrates responds to Agathon\u2019s speech. It is how\nDiotima converses with Socrates. It is the type of symposium Socrates\ntries to re-establish when Alcibiades\u2019 \u201csatyr-play\u201d\nis finished, and the throng of Bacchic revelers has left.\n\nUnlike the Laws, however, the Symposium is a comedy\ntoo, since it also contains an imitation of the second best kind of\nsymposium described in the Protagoras\u2014one where there\nare poets present, and where the participants \u201cargue over points\nthat can\u2019t be established with any certainty\u201d\n(347e1\u20137). An accurate description, surely, of the speeches made\nby all the symposiasts who speak prior to Socrates.\n\nFinally, Alcibiades arrives with\u2014significantly enough\u2014a\nflute-girl (212c5-e3; compare 176e6-7). And though she does not play,\nher arrival inaugurates the further decline of the symposium into\nsomething even more like the kind of symposium reviled in the\nProtagoras as \u201ca symposium of common, vulgar\nfellows\u2026 who, unable to entertain one another with their own\nconversation, put up the price of flute-girls, and pay large sums to\nhear the sound of the flute instead of their own talk\u201d\n(347c4-d2). This is the element of satyr-play in the\nSymposium\u2014satyr imagery is frequent in\nAlcibiades\u2019\n speech.[2]\n\nThe idea is the one mentioned earlier. Some love stories\u2014the\ngood ones\u2014are tragedies (in the special sense of the term\nintroduced in the Laws): they involve the kind of love found\nin the best kind of life, a life that comes as close as possible to\nthe divine\u2014one in which we achieve happiness by having good\nthings be ours forever (205d1\u2013206a12). Other love stories are\ncomedies: they involve a lesser kind of love. Others still are satyr\nplays: genital farces. But the true story of love, the story that is\nPlato\u2019s Symposium itself, is the story of all these\nstories. In the Symposium, it takes the form appropriate to\nits genre and audience. But in the Phaedrus, we learn of the\nlonger more technical road it might take in the future, when armed\nwith a scientific psychology and rhetoric it becomes a matter for\nexperts.\n",
