    "main_text": "Epistemic issues I: Representing cells || Diagrams in Cell Biology\n4.3 Diagrams in Cell Biology\n\nMicroscopic images, whether hand-drawn, as they were in the nineteenth\ncentury, or captured in photographs, are highly detailed. However, the\nknowledge cytologists and cell biologists seek to develop is more\nabstract and general\u2014they seek to identify the types of\nstructures found in cells, not all their instances. Accordingly, cell\nbiologists frequently generate diagrams that leave out details.\nMaienschein (1991) examines the origin of this practice in\nWilson\u2019s (1896) classic text, The Cell in Development and\nInheritance. Early in the book Wilson provided a diagram\n (Figure 5A)\n which abstracts from the much more replete photographs he had\npresented just a year earlier (Wilson 1895). Instead of showing all\nthe instances of different organelles, he presents just a few\ninstances of each type. Organelles are shown using icons that are\nsuggestive of their shapes. Such diagrams serve to convey the types of\norganelles found in cells and their typical location, but falsely\nsuggest that most of the space in the cell is empty. Maienschein\ncontends that this transition from photographs to abstract diagrams\nreflects Wilson\u2019s growing confidence in the correctness of his\ninterpretation of what he was seeing through the microscope and a\ntransition \u201cfrom presenting data to representing\ntheory\u201d (Maienschein 1991: 252). A\nsign of their theoretical status is that such figures, unlike\nmicrographs or data plots, often undergo numerous revisions as\nscientists develop their account. Revising these diagrams is a means,\nin fact, of developing theory. With the development of biochemical and\nmolecular accounts of cell phenomena, researchers often make what\nSerpente (2011) characterizes as a transition from the iconic to the\nsymbolic. He presents protein-protein interaction maps and gene\nregulatory diagrams as examples of symbolic representations.\n\n\n\n\nA. Wilson\u2019s (1896: 14, figure 5)\ncell diagram that leaves out much of the detail that would be seen\nthrough the microscope to focus on \n\n\n\n\nB. A mechanism diagram of the processes\nof heterophagy and autophagy from de Duve and Wattiaux (1966: 468,\nfigure 6).\n\n\nFigure 5 \n\n\nSimilar points also apply to another type of diagram that appears\nfrequently in cell biology\u2014diagrams of hypothesized mechanisms\nthat are taken to be responsible for a particular phenomenon (Sheredos\net al. 2013; Abrahamsen, Sheredos, & Bechtel 2018). Such diagrams\ndo not try to show all the organelle types but, as in\n Figure 5B,\n only those thought to be involved in generating a particular\nphenomenon\u2014in this case, the breakdown of materials taken into\nthe cell (heterophagy) or of cell components themselves (autophagy).\nOne challenge with mechanism diagrams is that they are static whereas\nmechanisms are engaged in change (the digestion of organelles and the\nexpulsion of the remaining material). One common strategy is to use\narrows to represent activities, although often within the same diagram\narrows may have multiple different meanings. Ultimately, however, it\nis up to the viewer to animate a mechanism diagram (Hegarty\n1992)\u2014to rehearse mentally the different activities that are\nrepresented and to imagine the changes that are being produced by\ndifferent parts.\n\nOne might think that diagrams are only important as a means of\nillustrating results that are presented textually. But examination of\nthe practices of scientists reveals that they are far more central to\ntheir reasoning. Early in the development of a mechanistic hypothesis\nscientists sketch their ideas. Often mechanism diagrams (as well as\nthe other figures that show data or the workflow of the research) are\ncrafted long before text is drafted. Diagrams are commonly presented\nin lab meetings and revised multiple times as scientists are refining\ntheir claims. Researchers often generate the text of the paper only at\nthe end of this process. Taking advantage of access to the draft\nfigures and text for two research projects, Sheredos and Bechtel\n(2017, in press) examined the process of interactive engagement in\nwhich the investigators modified diagrams, changed text, and then\nfurther modified the diagram. What this process suggests is that\nsketching and resketching mechanisms plays a central role as\nresearchers seek to identify what they can conclude from their\nexperimental studies. In one of the cases they examined, an early\nversion of a diagram serves to pose a question that was addressed\nthrough the experimental studies, resulting in a final diagram that\noffers an answer to the question posed. Beyond supporting the\nempirical claims of a research project, Jones and Wolkenhauer (2012)\nprovide an illuminating discussion of how diagrams serve to locate\ninformation required for a computational model in a representation of\nthe cellular mechanism that is being modeled,\n",
