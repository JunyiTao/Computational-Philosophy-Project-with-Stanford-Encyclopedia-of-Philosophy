    "main_text": "Reichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle\n2. Reichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle\n\nLet A and B be events. A storm, a person getting sick, a\nsoccer player scoring a goal, and a scientific measurement yielding a\nspecific result are all examples of events. Assume we can meaningfully\nassign probabilities to these events occurring. Reichenbach himself\ndeveloped a sophisticated frequency interpretation of probability\n(Reichenbach 1949), but we will assume only that some kind of\nobjective probability can be meaningfully applied. Suppose that events\nA and B are positively probabilistically correlated:\n\n\n\n\\[\\tag{1} \\label{introcorr}\np(A\\cap B)>p(A)p(B).\\]\n\n\n\nThat is, the probability that both A and B\noccur is greater than the product of the individual probabilities.\nReichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle says that when such a\nprobabilistic correlation between A and B exists, this\nis because one of the following causal relations exists: A is a\ncause of B; B is a cause of A; or A and\nB are both caused by a third factor, C. In the last\ncase, the common cause C occurs prior to A and B,\nand must satisfy the following four independent conditions: \n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tag{2}  p(A\\cap B|C) &= p(A|C)p(B|C) \\label{off1}\\\\\n\\tag{3} p(A\\cap B|\\overline{C})&= p(A|\\overline{C})p(B|\\overline{C}) \\label{off2}\\\\\n\\tag{4} p(A|C)&> p(A|\\overline{C}) \\label{nagy1}\\\\\n\\tag{5} p(B|C)&> p(B|\\overline{C})\\label{nagy2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nwhere  \n\n\\[\np(X|Y)\\doteq\\frac{p(X\\cap Y)}{p(Y)}\n\\]\n\n\ndenotes the conditional probability of X on condition Y,\n\\(\\overline{C}\\) denotes the absence of event C (the negation\nof the proposition that C happens) and it is assumed that\nneither C nor \\(\\overline{C}\\) has probability zero. Line (2)\nsays that A and B are conditionally\nindependent, given C. In Reichenbach\u2019s terminology,\nC screens A off from B. Line (3) says that\n\\(\\overline{C}\\) also screens A off from B. Lines (4)\nand (5) say that A and B are more probable, conditional\non C, than conditional on the absence of C. These\ninequalities are natural consequences of C being a cause of\nA and of B. Together, conditions (2) through (5)\nmathematically entail\n (1).\n The common cause can thus be understood to explain the correlation in\n(1). The probability relations described in lines (1) through (3)\nexhibit a version of Simpson\u2019s Paradox. For more about\nthis probabilistic phenomenon, see the entry on\n Simpson\u2019s Paradox.\n\nIt will often be helpful to represent such a common cause structure\ndiagrammatically, as in\n Figure 1.\n Arrows indicate causal relationships, and the vertical dimension\nrepresents time (with later times appearing higher up).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A common cause structure.\nC occurs earlier than A and B, and C is a\ncause of A and B.\n\n\nRCCP says that probabilistic correlations are ultimately derived from\ncausal relationships. That is, if \\(p(A\\cap B)>p(A)p(B)\\), that is\neither because one of these events causes the other, or else the\ninequality can be derived from other inequalities \\(p(A|C) >\np(A|\\overline{C})\\) and \\(p(B|C) > p(B|\\overline{C})\\) where\nC is a cause of A and B. The principle is\nsignificant because it posits a connection between causal structure\nand probabilistic correlations that licenses inferences to causal\nrelationships from empirically observable correlations.\n\nAs formulated above, RCCP assumes that there are only two possible\nstates of the common cause: C and \\(\\overline{C}\\). That is,\nC is a binary event that is either present or absent. A natural\nextension of RCCP would be to allow the common cause to be a random\nvariable Z with many possible values \\(z_1,\\dots,z_n\\). In this\ncase we would expect that \\(Z = z_i\\) screens off A from\nB for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). However, this does not imply that we can\ndivide the values of Z into two sets \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S^\\prime}\\) such that \\(Z\\in \\mathbf{S}\\) (corresponding to\nC) and \\(Z \\in \\mathbf{S^\\prime}\\) (corresponding to\n\\(\\overline{C}\\)) each screen off A and B. More\ngenerally, we would not expect coarsenings of Z to yield events\nthat screen off A and B.\n\nOne corollary of this generalization is that if A and B\nhave two distinct binary common causes C and D, we would\nexpect each of \\(CD, C\\overline{D}, \\overline{C}D, \\overline{CD}\\) to\nscreen off A and B, but would not expect C and\nD to screen off A and B. For example, even if we\ncondition on the common cause C, we would expect A and\nB to be correlated because of the further common cause\nD.\n\nWe can further generalize to allow the correlated effects to be\nrandom variables instead of binary events. The fully general version\nof RCCP then reads as follows:\n\n\n\nSuppose X and Y are random variables that are\ncorrelated; i.e., there exist values \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) such that\n \n\n\\[p(X=x_i \\cap Y=y_j) \\neq p(X=x_i)p(Y=y_j).\\]\n\n\nThen there exists a set of variables \\(Z_1,\\dots,Z_m\\), such that each\nvariable is a cause of X and Y, and \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(X=x_i \\cap Y=y_j |& Z_1 = z_{k_1},\\dots,Z_m = z_{k_m}) =\\\\\n&p(X=x_i | Z_1 = z_{k_1},\\dots,Z_m = z_{k_m})\\\\\n&\\times p(Y=y_j | Z_1 = z_{k_1},\\dots,Z_m = z_{k_m})\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nfor all \\(i,j,k_1,\\dots,k_m\\)\n\n\nWith this generalization of RCCP, it is trickier to formulate analogs\nfor conditions 4 and 5 that capture in probabilistic terms the idea\nthat each variable \\(Z_k\\) is a cause of both X and Y.\nIn addition, this set of conditions will not strictly imply that\nX and Y are probabilistically correlated. We will return\nto these issues in\n Section 7.\n",
