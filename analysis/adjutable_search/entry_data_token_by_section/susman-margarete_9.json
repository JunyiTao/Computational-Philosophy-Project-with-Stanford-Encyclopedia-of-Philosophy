    "main_text": "The Book of Job and the Destiny of the Jewish People\n10. Legacy\n\nOne of the first women distinguished as a philosopher and public\nintellectual in Wilhelmine and Weimar Germany as well as in\nSwitzerland (her home in early adolescence and her home again after\n1933) and a prominent exponent of German Jewish intellectual life\nduring the time of the Jewish Renaissance, Susman played an important\nrole in the literary circles of Stefan George and Karl Wolfskehl. She\nwas also a close associate of Georg Simmel and facilitated his\nreception after 1945 with her collaboration on the first edition of a\ncollection of his selected essays, titled Br\u00fccke und\nT\u00fcr, and her monograph Die geistige Gestalt Georg\nSimmels (Georg Simmel\u2019s Intellectual Contour). A\ndistinct voice among philosophers and intellectuals during the\nWilhelmine and Weimar periods, Susman became a symbol of the endurance\nof the legacy of German Jewish thought after 1945. Her thought both\nanticipated and left a formative imprint on the writings of Buber,\nBloch, Benjamin, Scholem, Adorno, Jacob Taubes, Hermann Levin\nGoldschmidt, and others.\n",
