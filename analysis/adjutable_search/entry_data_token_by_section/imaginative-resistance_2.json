    "main_text": "The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance: The Origins || Dependency and Fundamentality Relations between the Puzzles\n1.3 Dependency and Fundamentality Relations between the Puzzles\n\nEven though there is a consensus among believers in imaginative\nresistance that there are puzzles of imaginative resistance, there is\na dissensus on which puzzles to include. This dissensus is also\nindicative of disagreements concerning the dependency and\nfundamentality relations between the puzzles. \n\nWalton has been pushing the line on disentangling the imaginative and\nfictionality puzzles. He states that while the fictionality puzzle\nconcerns what is and isn\u2019t fictional,\n\n\n[t]he imaginative puzzle concerns not what is or isn\u2019t\nfictional, but what we do or do not imagine. These are different; I\nmay recognize that something is fictional, true in the world of a\nstory, without actually imagining it, or imagine something that I take\nnot to be fictional. (2006: 140)\n\n\nWalton (2006) claims that the fictionality puzzle is more\nphilosophically interesting than its counterpart. The imaginative\npuzzle concerns why we refuse to, or are unable to, engage with the\nprompted imagining. Walton thinks that refusal-based imaginative\npuzzles are not puzzling at all and that it is a matter of empirical\nstudy to determine when and how and why they happen (2006: 143). (See\nLiao et al. 2014 for an empirical study which concludes, contra\nWalton, that reactions to the imaginative puzzle and fictionality\npuzzle correlate). Nevertheless, Walton remarks that both puzzles\nshould be connected since fictionality is defined in terms of\nimagining (2006: 144). \n\nIt is questionable the degree of credence he continues to assign to\nthis view, given that Walton (2015), recanting his earlier reductive\naccount of fictionality\u2014according to which \u201c[a]\nproposition is fictional\u2026 just in case there is a prescription\nto the effect that it is to be imagined\u201d\u2014claims that\n\u201cprescriptions to imagine are necessary but not sufficient for\nfictionality\u201d (2015: 17). Walton (2015) states that fictionality\nturns out to be more fundamental than he had originally thought\n(Walton 1990\u2014up to 2015). \n\nKathleen Stock (2017), defending a different theory of truth in\nfiction, i.e., extreme intentionalism, dismisses the fictionality\npuzzle as a pseudo-puzzle. According to extreme intentionalism, \n\n\nthe fictional content of a particular text is equivalent to exactly\nwhat the author of the text intended the reader to imagine. (2017: 1)\n\n\n\nTherefore, as long as a proposition is written into a work of fiction\nwith the intention that it is to be imagined, it is fictional (2017:\n123). In this regard, Stock (2017) agrees that there are puzzles of\nimaginative resistance but disagrees that the fictionality puzzle is\none of them. \n\nCain Samuel Todd (2009), similar to Walton and Stock, states that the\nfictionality and imaginative puzzles must be separated. He claims that\n\u201cfictional truth is neither reducible to, nor straightforwardly\ndepends on, imaginability\u201d (2009: 200). Instead of arguing for\nthe fundamentality of one over the other, he denies that they are\npuzzling at all due to the fact that our resistant reactions might\ndiffer due to various factors, such as further beliefs, commitments,\nand values we hold (2009: 198). Todd is one of the representatives of\n\u201celiminativism\u201d which states that imaginative resistance\nis not a real phenomenon and does not exist outside\nphilosophers\u2019 carefully concocted scenarios. (For more on\neliminativism, see\n section 2.1.3.)\n \n\nThere are other accounts that hold the relation between the\nimaginative and fictionality puzzles to be more tightly connected.\nNils-Hennes Stear (2015) argues for the interconnectivity between the\npuzzles. The main move he makes in this regard is to conceive of the\nimaginative puzzle as normative in character, rather than\npsychological (2015: 8). With respect to the psychological construal\nof the imaginative puzzle, Stear agrees with Todd that it is not\npuzzling at all. The puzzling aspect of the imaginative puzzle on his\naccount concerns the norms of proper engagement with works of fiction,\nas does the fictionality puzzle. How do they differ? Stear writes,\n\u201cimaginative failure is a datum we must explain, and\nfictionality failure is the theoretical posit via which we explain\nit\u201d (2015: 8). (See also Gendler 2006, for an elucidation of the\nfictionality puzzle as dependent on the imaginative puzzle.)\n",
