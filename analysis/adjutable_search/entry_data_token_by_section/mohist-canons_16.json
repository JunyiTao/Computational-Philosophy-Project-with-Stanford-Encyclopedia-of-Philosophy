    "main_text": "Argumentation and Logic || \u201cThe Difficulty of Extending Kinds\u201d\n7.1 \u201cThe Difficulty of Extending Kinds\u201d\n\nIn a typical disputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf), we compare\nsomething to a model or exemplar of the kind (l\u00e8i\n\u985e) of thing denoted by some term and judge whether or not they\nare \u201cthe same.\u201d In the narrowest sort of case, we might\ndispute whether a particular individual is of a certain kind, such as\noxen. At a higher level of generality, we might dispute\nwhether or not one kind of thing, A, is also of another kind,\nB. For instance, we might dispute whether or not oxen are of\nthe kind four-footed animals. In either sort of case, we are\nconsidering whether to \u201cextend\u201d our judgment about what is\nof a kind to include something new. In classical Chinese thought,\njudging that some new thing falls within a recognized kind is called\n\u201canalogical extension\u201d or \u201cextending kinds\u201d\n(tu\u012b l\u00e8i \u63a8\u985e).\n\nSuch judgments will typically be based on comparison with selected\nfeatures of a limited set of exemplars. We will usually proceed by\nidentifying a few distinguishing features of a handful of\nrepresentatives of the kind, a process the Mohists call\n\u201csettling the kind\u201d (B1). Yet things of the same kind may\nbe dissimilar in some respects, while things of different kinds may\nnevertheless share some similarities. So problems can arise in\nidentifying distinguishing features and differentiating kinds. The\nMohists call this the \u201cdifficulty of extending kinds\u201d\n(B2). The canon that presents the problem is corrupt and obscure, but\nwe can make an educated conjecture as to its gist. It identifies two\nsources of difficulty: first, some features, but not all, are shared\nby every member of a kind; second, because kinds may be larger or\nsmaller in scope, two things may be similar in both falling under one\nkind without being similar in falling under another. All quadrupeds\nare alike in having four feet, but not all are alike in being oxen,\nhorses, or deer. Birds and all other animals are alike in being living\ncreatures, but not all animals are birds. One cannot invariably\ngeneralize from features of an exemplar to claims about an entire\nkind, because\u2014with the exception of special cases such as being\nfour-footed\u2014it is not obvious from the exemplar which features\nare shared by all members of the kind. Thus in disputation the process\nof identifying features of individual exemplars that are indeed\nrepresentative of their kind will always be fallible. \n\nOther problems concerned the semantics of compound terms, or phrases.\nThe simplest early Chinese model of language\u2014probably the\ndefault starting point for the Mohists\u2019 and other ancient\nChinese thinkers\u2019 reflections\u2014is what we might call the\none-name-one-thing model (cf. Hansen 1983). On this view, names or\nwords (m\u00edng \u540d) are taken to stand in a\none-to-one correspondence with kinds of sh\u00ed \u5be6\n(stuff, things, events, situations). When the Mohists moved on to\nconsider phrases or expressions (c\u00ed \u8fad) formed\nby combining two or more words, they discovered that the\nlanguage-world relation is more complex than this naive model\nsuggests. Linguistic structure does not always directly reflect the\nstructure of things in the world. When two names are strung together,\nthe reference of the resulting phrase may change in unpredictable\nways. Combining \u2018oxen\u2019 and \u2018horses\u2019 gives\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (ni\u00fa m\u01ce\n\u725b\u99ac), a phrase denoting the sum of all oxen and horses\n(B12). But combining \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 does\nnot produce a phrase denoting the sum of all hard things and white\nthings. It forms one denoting things that are both hard and white in\nthe same place at the same time (A66, B37). Everything hard-and-white\n(ji\u0101n b\u00e1i \u5805\u767d) is white. But not\neverything falling within the extension of\n\u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 is oxen. In fact, a dispute over whether\noxen-and-horses are oxen or not is undecidable, since if we claim that\nthey are, on the grounds that part of the sum is oxen, our opponent\ncan claim in response that they are not, on exactly parallel grounds\n(B67) (Fraser 2007b). \u2018White horse\u2019 and \u2018blind\nhorse\u2019 have the same grammatical structure. But whereas a white\nhorse is white all over, a blind horse is not \u201cblind all\nover\u201d; only its eyes are blind (B3). Deeming someone\n\u201cf\u016b \u592b\u201d (husband) but combining the\nword with \u2018y\u00f3ng \u52c7\u2019 (brave) to form\nthe phrase \u2018y\u00f3ng f\u016b \u52c7\u592b\u2019\n(\u201cbrave man\u201d) is not deeming him a husband. But deeming a\npair of things \u201cshoes\u201d while combining the word with\n\u2018buying clothes\u2019 (\u201cbuying clothes and shoes\u201d)\nis still deeming them shoes (B3). \n\nObservations about such formally similar but semantically dissimilar\nphrases led the Mohists to doubt that complex linguistic structures\nhave any regular or reliable relation to the patterns of similarity\nand difference that ground their correct use. Formal parallels between\nthe words and phrases we use to talk about things can guide us in\ndiscriminating kinds only up to a point, because linguistic\nsimilarities may not reflect actual similarities in things. In\nclassical Chinese, \u2018oxen-and-horses\u2019 (ni\u00fa\nm\u01ce \u725b\u99ac) and \u2018white horse\u2019\n(b\u00e1i m\u01ce \u767d\u99ac) have a similar formal\nstructure, but the first denotes the sum of two kinds of things, the\nsecond a portion of one kind of thing. Formal similarities in\nlinguistic structure are thus an unreliable guide to distinguishing\nkinds. To discriminate kinds properly, we need to examine the semantic\ncriteria (y\u012bn \u56e0) or grounds (g\u00f9\n\u6545) that determine the proper use of the words or phrases that\ndenote them, and not rely only on structural similarities to other\nwords or phrases. In some cases, we may need to point out that\nstructurally similar expressions in fact have very different\nsemantics. This is a key theme of the \u201cLesser Selection\u201d\n(Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4), a brief summary and illustration of\nMohist dialectics that is probably the most important text in the\nhistory of Chinese logic. \n",
