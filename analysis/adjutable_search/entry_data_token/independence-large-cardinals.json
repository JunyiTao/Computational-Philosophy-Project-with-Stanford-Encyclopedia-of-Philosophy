Independence\n\n\nLet us begin with the notion of an axiom system.  To motivate\nthis notion consider the manner in which justification traditionally\nproceeds in mathematics.  In reasoning about a given domain of\nmathematics (or, in fact, any domain) the question of justification is\nsuccessively pushed back further and further until ultimately one\nreaches principles that do not admit more fundamental justification.\nThe statements at this terminal stage are elected as axioms\nand the subject is then organized in terms of derivability from the\nbase of axioms.  In the case of arithmetic this led to the axiom\nsystem PA (Peano arithmetic) and in the case of set theory it led\nto the axiom system ZFC (Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom\nof Choice).\n\n\nTwo natural questions arise: (1) If the axioms do not admit of more\nfundamental justification then how does one justify them?  (2) Is the\nbase of axioms sufficiently rich that one can settle every sentence on\nthis basis?\n\n\nThere are two traditional views concerning the epistemological status\nof axioms.  On the first view the axioms do not admit further\njustification since they are self-evident.  On the second\nview the axioms do not admit further justification since they\nare definitive of the subject matter.  Each of these views\nconcerning our first question leads to an associated optimistic view\nconcerning our second question\u2014according to the first optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom self-evident truths, while according to the second optimistic\nview, all mathematical truths are derivable (in first-order logic)\nfrom statements that are definitive of the subject matter.  Should\neither of these optimistic views turn out to be correct, then the\nquestion of justification in mathematics would take on a particularly\nsimple form: Either a statement would be an axiom (in which case it\nwould be self-evident or definitive of the subject matter (depending\non the view under consideration)) or it would be derivable in\nfirst-order logic from some such statements.\n\n\nUnfortunately, these optimistic views came to be challenged in 1931 by\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.  Here is one version of the second\nincompleteness theorem:\n\nTheorem 1.1\n(G\u00f6del, 1931). \nAssume that PA is consistent.  Then\nPA does not prove Con(PA).\n\n\n\nHere Con(PA) is a statement of arithmetic that expresses the informal\nstatement that PA is consistent.[1]\nUnder slightly stronger assumptions (for\nexample, that PA is \u03a301-sound[2]) one can\nstrengthen the conclusion by adding that PA does not prove\n\u00acCon(PA); in other words, under this stronger assumption,\nCon(PA) is independent of PA.  Thus, we have here a\ncase of a statement of arithmetic (and, in fact, a very simple one)\nthat cannot be settled on the basis of the standard axioms.  Moreover,\nthe theorem is completely general\u2014it holds not just for PA but\nfor any sufficiently strong formal system T.\n\n\nThis raises a challenge for the two aforementioned optimistic views\nconcerning the nature of mathematical truth.  To begin with it shows\nthat we cannot work with a fixed axiom system T.  We will\nalways need to introduce new axioms.  More importantly, it raises the\nquestion of how one is to justify these new axioms, for as one\ncontinues to add stronger and stronger axioms the claim that they are\neither self-evident or definitive of the subject matter will grow\nincreasingly more difficult to defend.\n\n\nAlready in 1931 G\u00f6del pointed out a natural way to justify new\naxioms.  He pointed out that if one moves beyond the natural numbers\nand climbs the hierarchy of types (the sets of natural numbers, the\nsets of sets of natural numbers, etc.) one arrives at axioms (the\naxioms of second-order arithmetic PA2, the axioms of third-order\narithmetic PA3, etc.) that settle the undecided statements that he\ndiscovered.  The axiom system for the second level, PA2, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the first level, namely Con(PA);\nin fact, PA2 proves Con(PA), which is the desired result.  But\nnow we have a problem at the second level.  For the second\nincompleteness theorem shows that (under similar background\nassumptions to those above) PA2 does not settle Con(PA2).\nFortunately, the axiom system for the third level, PA3, settles\nthe statement left undecided at the second level, namely\nCon(PA2).  This pattern continues.  For every problem there is a\nsolution and for every solution there is a new problem.  In this way,\nby climbing the hierarchy of types one arrives at systems that\nsuccessively settle the consistency statements that arise along the\nway.\n\n\nThe above hierarchy of types can be recast in the uniform setting of\nset theory.  The set-theoretic hierarchy is defined inductively by\nstarting with the emptyset, taking the powerset at successor stages\n\u03b1+1, and taking the union at limit levels \u03bb:\n\n\n\nV0\n= \u2205\n\nV\u03b1+1\n= P(V\u03b1)\n\nV\u03bb\n= \u222a\u03b1 < \u03bb V\u03b1\n\n\n\n\nThe universe of sets V is the union of all such stages:\nV=\u222a\u03b1\u2208On V\u03b1,\nwhere On is the class of ordinals.  The first infinite level\nV\u03c9 consists of all of the hereditarily finite sets[3]\nand this level satisfies ZFC-Infinity.\nThe sets at this level can be coded by natural numbers and in this way\none can show that PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.[4]\nThe second infinite level V\u03c9+1 is\nessentially P(\u2115) (or, equivalently, \u211d) and this\nlevel satisfies (a theory that is mutually interpretable with)\nPA2.  The third infinite level\nV\u03c9+2 is essentially P(P(\u2115)) (or, equivalently,\nas the set of functions of real numbers) and this level satisfies (a\ntheory that is mutually interpretable with) PA3.  The first three\ninfinite levels thus encompass arithmetic, analysis and functional\nanalysis and therewith most of standard mathematics.  In this fashion,\nthe hierarchy of sets and associated set-theoretic systems encompasses\nthe objects and systems of standard mathematics.\n\n\nNow, should it turn out to be the case that the consistency sentences\n(and the other, related sentences discovered by G\u00f6del in 1931) were\nthe only instances of undecidable statements, then the\nsequence of systems in the above hierarchy would catch every problem\nthat arises.  And although we would never have a single system\nthat gave us a complete axiomatization of mathematical truth, we would\nhave a series of systems that collectively covered the\ntotality of mathematical truths.\n\n\nUnfortunately, matters were not to be so simple.  The trouble is that\nwhen one climbs the hierarchy of sets in this fashion the greater\nexpressive resources that become available lead to more intractable\ninstances of undecidable sentences and this is true already of the\nsecond and third infinite levels.  For example, at the second infinite\nlevel one can formulate the statement PM (that all projective sets\nare Lebesgue measurable) and at the third infinite level one can\nformulate CH (Cantor's continuum hypothesis).[5]\n  These statements were intensively investigated during the early era\nof set theory but little progress was made.  The explanation was\nultimately provided by the subsequent independence techniques of\nG\u00f6del and Cohen.\n\n\nG\u00f6del invented (in 1938) the method of inner models by\ndefining the minimal inner model L.  This model is defined just as\nV is defined except that at successor stages instead of taking the\nfull powerset of the previous stage one takes the definable powerset of the previous stage, where for a given set\nX the definable powerset Def(X) of X is the set of all\nsubsets of X that are definable over X with parameters from X:\n\n\n\nL0\n= \u2205\n\nL\u03b1+1\n= Def(L\u03b1)\n\nL\u03bb\n= \u222a\u03b1 < \u03bb L\u03b1\n\n\n\n\nThe inner model L is the union of all such stages:\nL\n= \u222a\u03b1\u2208On L\u03b1. G\u00f6del\nshowed that L satisfies (arbitrarily large fragments of) ZFC\nalong with CH.  It follows that ZFC cannot refute CH. Cohen\ncomplemented this result by inventing (in 1963) the method\nof forcing (or outer models). Given a complete\nBoolean algebra B he defined a model\nVB and showed that \u00acCH holds in VB.[6]\nThis had the consequence that\nZFC could not prove CH.  Thus, these results together showed\nthat CH is independent of ZFC.  Similar results hold for PM\nand a host of other questions in set theory.\n\n\nThese instances of independence are more intractable in that no simple\niteration of the hierarchy of types leads to their resolution.  They\nled to a more profound search for new axioms.\n\n\nOnce again G\u00f6del provided the first steps in the search for new\naxioms.  In 1946 he proposed as new axioms large cardinal\n  axioms\u2014axioms of infinity that assert that there are very large\nlevels of the hierarchy of types\u2014and he went so far as\nto entertain a generalized completeness theorem for such axioms,\naccording to which all statements of set theory could be settled by\nsuch axioms (G\u00f6del 1946, 151).\n\n\nThe purpose of the remainder of this entry is to describe the nature\nof independence (along with the hierarchy of interpretability) and the\nconnection between independence and large cardinal axioms.  \n\n\n\nFurther Reading: For more on the incompleteness\ntheorems see Smory\u0144ski (1977), Buss (1998a), and\nLindstr\u00f6m (2003).

The Interpretability Hierarchy\n\n\nOur aim is to investigate the space of mathematical theories\n(construed as recursively enumerable axiom systems).  The ordering on\nthe space of such theories that we will consider is that\nof interpretability.  The informal notion of interpretability\nis ubiquitous in mathematics; for example, Poincar\u00e9 provided an\ninterpretation of two dimensional hyperbolic geometry in the Euclidean\ngeometry of the unit circle; Dedekind provided an interpretation of\nanalysis in set theory; and G\u00f6del provided an interpretation of\nthe theory of formal syntax in arithmetic.\n\n\nWe shall use a precise formal regimentation of this informal notion.\nLet T1 and T2 be recursively enumerable axiom systems.  We say\nthat T1 is interpretable in T2 (T1 \u2264 T2) when,\nroughly speaking, there is a translation \u03c4 from the language of\nT1 to the language of T2 such that, for each sentence \u03c6 of\nthe language of T1, if T1\u22a2\u03c6 then\n T2\u22a2\u03c4(\u03c6).[7]\nWe shall write T1 < T2 when T1\u2264\nT2 and T2\u2270 T1 and we shall write T1\u2261 T2 when both\nT1\u2264 T2 and T2\u2264 T1.  In the latter case, T1 and T2\nare said to be mutually interpretable.  The equivalence class of\nall theories mutually interpretable with T is called the interpretability degree of T.\n\n\nFor ease of exposition we shall make three simplifying assumptions\nconcerning the theories under consideration.  First, we shall assume\nthat all of our theories are couched in the language of set theory.\nThere is no loss of generality in this assumption since every theory\nis mutually interpretable with a theory in this language.  For\nexample, as noted earlier, PA and ZFC-Infinity are mutually\ninterpretable.  Second, we shall assume that all of our theories\ncontain ZFC-Infinity.  Third, we shall assume that all of our\ntheories are \u03a301-sound.\n\n\nThe interpretability hierarchy is the collection of all\ntheories (satisfying our three simplifying assumptions) ordered under\nthe relation \u2264. We now turn to a discussion of the structure of\nthis hierarchy.\n\n\nTo begin with, there is a useful characterization of the relation\n\u2264.  Let us write T1\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\u03a001 T2 to indicate that every\n\u03a001-statement provable in T1 is also provable in T2.  A\ncentral result in the theory of interpretability is that (granting our\nsimplifying assumptions) T1\u2264 T2 iff T1\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\u03a001 T2.\nIt follows from this characterization and the second incompleteness\ntheorem that for any theory T the theory T + Con(T) is strictly\nstronger than T, that is, \n T < T + Con(T).  Moreover, it follows\nfrom the arithmetized completeness theorem that the theory\nT + \u00acCon(T) is interpretable in T, hence,\nT \u2261 T + \u00acCon(T).\n\n\nIn terms of interpretability there are three possible ways in which a\nstatement \u03c6 can be independent of a theory T.\n\nSingle Jump. Only one of \u03c6 or \u00ac\u03c6 leads\n  to a jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 > T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 \u2261 T\n\n  (or likewise with \u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c6 interchanged).\nNo Jump. Neither \u03c6 nor \u00ac\u03c6 lead to a\n  jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 \u2261 T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 \u2261 T.\n  \nDouble Jump. Both \u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c6 lead to a\n  jump in strength, that is,\n  \nT + \u03c6 > T \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T + \u00ac\u03c6 > T.\n  \n\n\n\nIt turns out that each of these possibilities is realized.  For the\nfirst it suffices to take the \u03a001-sentence Con(T).  For the\nsecond it is easy to see that there is no example that is \u03a001;\nthe simplest possible complexity of such a sentence is \u039402\nand it turns out that there are such examples; examples of this type\nof independence are called Orey sentences.  For the third kind\nof independence there are \u03a001 instances.  (This is a corollary\nof Lemma 14 on pages 128\u2013129 of Lindstr\u00f6m (2003).)\n\n\nThese are all metamathematical examples, the kind of example that only\na logician would construct.  It is natural to ask whether there are\n\u201cnatural\u201d examples, roughly the sort of example occurring in the\nnormal course of mathematics.  In the set theoretic case, such\nexamples are abundant for the first two cases.  For example, PM is\nan example of the first kind of independence and CH is an example\nof the second kind of independence.  There are no known \u201cnatural\u201d\nexamples of the third kind of independence.  In the arithmetical case,\nsuch examples are rare.  There are examples of the first kind of\nindependence (the most famous of which is a classic example due to\nParis and Harrington) but none of the second or third kind of\nindependence.\n\n\nNotice that in the case of the third example the two theories above\nT are incomparable in the interpretability order.  To construct a\npair of such \u03a001-statements one uses a reciprocal form of the\ndiagonal lemma to construct two \u03a001-statements that refer to one\nanother.  Using such techniques can show that the interpretability\norder is quite complex.  For example, for any two theories T1 and\nT2 such that T1 < T2 there is a third theory T such that\nT1 < T < T2.  Thus, the order on the degrees of interpretability is\nneither linearly ordered nor well-founded.  (See Feferman (1960).)\n\n\nRemarkably, it turns out that when one restricts to those theories\nthat \u201carise in nature\u201d the interpretability ordering is quite\nsimple: There are no descending chains and there are no incomparable\nelements\u2014the interpretability ordering on theories that \u201carise in\nnature\u201d is a wellordering.  In particular, although there are natural\nexamples of the first and second kind of independence (e.g. PM and\nCH, respectively, something to which we will return to below),\nthere are no known natural examples of the third kind of independence.\n\n\nSo, for theories that \u201carise in nature\u201d, we have a wellordered\nhierarchy under the interpretability ordering.  At the base of the\nordering one has the degree that is represented by our minimal theory\nZFC-Infinity and there is only one way to proceed, namely, upward\nin terms of strength.\n\n\nWe have already seen one way of climbing the hierarchy of the degrees\nof interpretability, namely, by adding consistency statements.  There\nare two drawbacks to this approach.  First, if one starts with a\ntheory that \u201carises in nature\u201d and adds the consistency statement\none lands in a degree that has no known representative that \u201carises\nin nature\u201d.  Second, the consistency statement does not take one very\nfar up the hierarchy.  Both of these drawbacks are remedied by a very\nnatural class of axioms\u2014the large cardinal axioms.\n\nFurther Reading: For more on the structure of the\ninterpretability hierarchy see chapters 6\u20138 of Lindstr\u00f6m\n(2003).\n3. Large Cardinal Axioms\n\n\nLet Z0 be the theory ZFC-Infinity-Replacement.  (This theory\nis logically equivalent to our base theory ZFC-Infinity.) We\nshall successively strengthen Z0 by reflectively adding axioms that\nassert certain levels of the universe of sets exist.\n\n\nThe standard model of Z0 is V\u03c9.  The Axiom of Infinity (in\none formulation) simply asserts that this set exists.  So, when we add\nthe Axiom of Infinity, the resulting theory Z1 (known as Zermelo\nset theory with Choice) not only proves the consistency of Z0; it\nproves that there is a standard model of Z0.  Now the standard\nmodel of Z1 is V\u03c9+\u03c9.  The Axiom of Replacement\nimplies that this set exists.  So, when we add the Axiom of\nReplacement, the resulting theory Z2 (known as ZFC), not only\nproves the consistency of Z1; it proves that there is a standard\nmodel of Z1.\n\n\nA standard model of Z2 has the\nform V\u03ba where \u03ba is a regular cardinal\nsuch that for all \u03b1 < \u03ba, 2\u03b1 <\n\u03ba.  Such a cardinal is called a\n(strongly) inaccessible cardinal.  The next axiom in\nthe hierarchy under consideration is the statement asserting that such\na cardinal exists.  The resulting theory \n ZFC + \u201cThere is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d proves that there is a level of\nthe universe that satisfies ZFC.  Continuing in this fashion one\narrives at stronger and stronger axioms that assert the existence of\nlarger and larger levels of the universe of sets.  Before continuing\nwith an outline of such axioms let us first draw the connection with\nthe hierarchy of interpretability.\n\n\nRecall our classification of the three types of independence.  We\nnoted that there are no known natural examples of the third kind of\nindependence but that there are natural examples of the first and\nsecond kind of independence.\n\n\nNatural examples of the second kind of independence are provided by\nthe dual method of inner and outer models.  For example, these methods\nshow that the theories ZFC+CH and ZFC+ \u00acCH are mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC, that is, all three theories lie in the same\ndegree.  In other words, CH is an Orey sentence with respect to\nZFC.  What about that other sentence we introduced: PM?\n\n\nUsing the method of inner models G\u00f6del showed that \u00acPM holds\nin L.  It follows that ZFC+ \u00acPM is mutually interpretable with\nZFC.  But what about PM?  To show that ZFC+PM is mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC a natural approach would be to follow the\napproach used for CH and build an outer model of ZFC that\nsatisfies PM.  However, it is known that this cannot be done\nstarting with ZFC alone.  For it turns out (by a result of\nShelah (1984)) that ZFC+PM implies the consistency of\nZFC and this implies, by the second incompleteness theorem, that\nZFC+PM is not interpretable in ZFC.  In a sense we have here a\ncase of the independence of independence.  More precisely, even if we\nassume that ZFC is consistent we cannot (in contrast to the case of\nCH) prove that PM is independent of ZFC.  To establish the\nindependence of PM from ZFC we need to assume the consistency of\na stronger theory, namely, that of \n ZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal\u201d.  For it turns out that ZFC+PM lies not in the\ninterpretability degree of ZFC but rather in that\nof ZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly\ninaccessible cardinal\u201d.  To summarize: While CH is a case of the\nsecond type independence, PM is a case of the first type independence;\nit is similar to Con(ZFC) in that it is a sentence \u03c6 such that\nonly one of \u03c6 or \u00ac\u03c6 leads to a jump in strength, only now\nthere are two differences; the jump lands in a degree that is much\nstronger and it is represented by a natural theory.\n\n\nIn general, the (known) sentences of set theory are either like CH\nor PM.  Some are like CH in that both ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+ \u00ac\u03c6 lie in the degree of ZFC.  Others are like PM in\nthat one of ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+ \u00ac\u03c6 lies in the degree of\nZFC while the other lies in the degree of an extension of ZFC\nvia a large cardinal axiom.\n\n\nLet us now return to our overview of large cardinal axioms.  After\nstrongly inaccessible cardinals there are Mahlo cardinals,\nindescribable cardinals, and ineffable cardinals.  All of these large\ncardinal axioms can be derived in a uniform way using the traditional\nvariety of reflection principles (see Tait 2005) but there\nare limitations on how far this variety of reflection principles can\ntake one.  For under a very general characterization of such\nprinciples it is known that they cannot yield the Erd\u0151s cardinal\n\u03ba(\u03c9).  See Koellner (2009).\n\n\nThe large cardinals considered thus far (including \u03ba(\u03c9))\nare known as small large cardinals.  A large cardinal is small if the associated large cardinal axiom can hold in\nG\u00f6del's constructible universe L, that is, if \n \u201cV \u22a8 \u03ba is a\n\u03c6-cardinal\u201d is consistent, then \n \u201cL \u22a8 \u03ba is a\n\u03c6-cardinal\u201d is consistent.  Otherwise the large cardinal is large.\n\n\nThere is a simple template for formulating (large) large cardinal\naxioms is in terms of elementary embeddings.  In general such an axiom\nasserts that there is a transitive class M and a non-trivial\nelementary embedding\n\nj : V \u2192 M.\n\n\n\nTo say that the embedding is non-trivial is just to say that it is not\nthe identity, in which case there must be a least ordinal that is\nmoved.  This ordinal is called the critical point of j and\ndenoted crit(j).  The critical point is (typically) the large\ncardinal associated with the embedding.  A cardinal \u03ba is said to be\nmeasurable iff it is the critical point of some such\nembedding.[8]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that for any such\nembedding V\u03ba+1\u2286 M where\n\u03ba = crit(j).  This amount of agreement enables one to\nshow that \u03ba is strongly inaccessible, Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  To illustrate this let us assume that we have shown\nthat \u03ba is strongly inaccessible and let us show that \u03ba has\nmuch stronger large cardinal properties.  Since \u03ba is strongly\ninaccessible in V and since\n(V\u03ba+1)M\n=V\u03ba+1, M also thinks that \u03ba\nis strongly inaccessible.  In particular, M thinks that there\nis a strongly inaccessible cardinal (namely, \u03ba)\nbelow j(\u03ba).  But then by the elementarity of\nj, V must think the same thing of the preimage of\nj(\u03ba), namely, \u03ba, that is, V must think that\nthere is a strongly inaccessible below \u03ba.  So \u03ba cannot\nbe the least strongly inaccessible cardinal.  Continuing in this\nmanner one can show that there are many strongly inaccessibles below\n\u03ba and, in fact, that \u03ba is Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  So measurable cardinals subsume the small large\ncardinals.\n\n\nIn fact, Scott showed that (in contrast to the small large cardinals)\nmeasurable cardinals cannot exist in G\u00f6del's constructible universe.\nLet us be precise about this.  Let V=L be the statement that\nasserts that all sets are constructible.  Then for each small large\ncardinal axiom \u03c6 (to be precise, those listed above) if the\ntheory ZFC+\u03c6 is consistent then so is the theory\nZFC+\u03c6+V=L.  In contrast, the theory ZFC + \u201cThere is a\nmeasurable cardinal\u201d proves \u00acV=L.  This may seem somewhat\ncounterintuitive since L contains all of the ordinals and so if \u03ba\nis a measurable cardinal then \u03ba is an ordinal in L.  The point is\nthat L cannot \u201crecognize\u201d that \u03ba is a measurable cardinal since\nit is too \u201cthin\u201d to contain the ultrafilter that witnesses the\nmeasurability of \u03ba.\n\n\nOne way to strengthen a large cardinal axiom based on the above\ntemplate is to demand greater agreement between M and V.  For\nexample, if one demands that V\u03ba+2\u2286 M then the fact that\n\u03ba is measurable (something witnessed by a subset of P(\u03ba))\ncan be recognized by M.  And so, by exactly the same argument that\nwe used above, there must be a measurable cardinal below \u03ba.\n\n\nThis leads to a progression of increasingly strong large cardinal\naxioms.  It will be useful to discuss some of the major stepping\nstones in this hierarchy.\n\n\nIf \u03ba is a cardinal and \u03b7>\u03ba is an ordinal then\n\u03ba is \u03b7-strong if there is a transitive\nclass M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V \u2192 M such that crit(j)=\u03ba,\nj(\u03ba)>\u03b7\nand V\u03b7\u2286 M.  A cardinal \u03ba\nis strong iff it is \u03b7-strong for all \u03b7>\u03ba.\nOne can also demand that the embedding preserve certain classes:\nIf A is a class, \u03ba is a cardinal, and \u03b7>\u03ba\nis an ordinal then \u03ba is \u03b7-A-strong if\nthere exists a j: V \u2192 M which witnesses that \u03ba\nis \u03b7-strong and which has the additional feature that\nj(A \u2229 V\u03ba)\n\u2229 V\u03b7 = A\n\u2229 V\u03b7.  The following large cardinal notion\nplays a central role in the search for new axioms.\n\nDefinition 3.1.\n\n  A cardinal \u03ba is a Woodin cardinal if \u03ba is strongly\n  inaccessible and for all A\u2286 V\u03ba  there is a cardinal\n  \u03baA < \u03ba such that\n\n  \n  \u03baA is \u03b7-A-strong,\n   \n\nfor each \u03b7 such that \u03baA < \u03b7 < \u03ba.[9]\n\n\n\nOne can obtain stronger large cardinal axioms by forging a link\nbetween the embedding j and the amount of resemblance between M\nand V.  For example, a cardinal \u03ba is superstrong if there\nis a transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V \u2192 M such that crit(j)=\u03ba and \n Vj(\u03ba)\u2286 M.  If \u03ba is\nsuperstrong then \u03ba is a Woodin cardinal and there are arbitrarily\nlarge Woodin cardinals below \u03ba. \n\n\nOne can also obtain strong large cardinal axioms by placing closure\nconditions on the target model M.  For example, letting \u03b3\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03ba a\ncardinal \u03ba is \u03b3-supercompact if there is a\ntransitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j: V \u2192 M\nsuch that crit(j)=\u03ba and \u03b3M\u2286 M, that is, M is closed\nunder \u03b3-sequences.  (It is straightforward to see that if M is\nclosed under \u03b3-sequences then H(\u03b3+)\u2286 M; so this approach\nsubsumes the previous approach.) A cardinal \u03ba is supercompact if it is \u03b3-supercompact for all \u03b3 \u2265 \u03ba.  Now,\njust as in the previous approach, one can strengthen these axioms by\nforging a link between the embedding j and the closure conditions on\nthe target model.  A cardinal \u03ba is n-huge if there is\na transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j:V \u2192\nM such that j\u2009n(\u03ba)M\u00a0\u2286\u00a0M, where \u03ba=crit(j) and\nj\u2009i+1(\u03ba) is defined to be j(j\u2009i(\u03ba)). \n\n\nOne can continue in this vein, demanding greater agreement between M\nand V.  The ultimate axiom in this direction would, of course,\ndemand that M = V.  This axiom was proposed by Reinhardt and shortly\nthereafter shown to be inconsistent (in ZFC) by Kunen.  In fact,\nKunen showed that, assuming ZFC, there can be a transitive class\nM and a non-trivial elementary\nembedding j: V \u2192 M such that\nj \u2018\u2018 \u03bb \u2208 M, where \n \u03bb=supn < \u03c9\u2009j\u2009n(\u03ba) and\n\u03ba=crit(j).  In particular, there cannot exists such\nan M and\nj such that V\u03bb+1\u2286 M.  This placed a limit on the\namount of closure of the target model (in relation to the\nembedding).[10]\n\n\n\nNevertheless, there is a lot of room below the above upper bound.  For\nexample, a very strong axiom is the statement that there is a\nnon-trivial elementary embedding j:V\u03bb+1\u2192 V\u03bb+1.  The\nstrongest large cardinal axiom in the current literature is the axiom\nasserting that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: L(V\u03bb+1)\u2192 L(V\u03bb+1) such that crit(j)<\u03bb.  In recent\nwork, Woodin has discovered axioms much stronger than this.\n\nFurther Reading: For more on large cardinal axioms\nsee Kanamori (2003).\n4. Large Cardinal Axioms and the Interpretability Hierarchy\n\n\nThe large cardinal axioms discussed above are naturally well-ordered\nin terms of strength.[11]\nThis provides a natural way of climbing the hierarchy of\ninterpretability.  At the base we start with the theory\nZFC-Infinity and then we climb to ZFC and up through\nZFC+\u03a6 for various large cardinal axioms \u03a6.  Notice that for\ntwo large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8, if \u03a8 is stronger\nthan \u03a6 then \u03a8 implies that there is a standard model of\n\u03a6 and so we have a natural interpretation of ZFC+\u03a6 in\nZFC+\u03a8.\n\n\nWe have already noted that ZFC+\u00acPM is mutually interpretable\nwith ZFC+LC where LC is the large cardinal axiom \u201cThere is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d and that this is shown using the dual\ntechniques of inner and outer model theory.  It is a remarkable\nempirical fact that for any \u201cnatural\u201d statement in the\nlanguage of set theory \u03c6 one can generally find a large cardinal\naxiom \u03a6 such that ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03a6 are mutually\ninterpretable.  Again, this is established using the dual techniques\nof inner and outer model theory only now large cardinals enter the\nmix.  To establish that ZFC+\u03a6 interprets ZFC+\u03c6 one\ngenerally starts with a model of ZFC+\u03a6 and uses forcing to\nconstruct a model of ZFC+\u03c6.  In many cases the forcing\nconstruction involves \u201ccollapsing\u201d the large cardinal associated\nwith \u03a6 and arranging the collapse in such a way that \u03c6 holds\nin the \u201crubble\u201d.  In the other direction, one generally starts with\na model of ZFC+\u03c6 and then constructs an inner model (a model\nresembling L but able to accommodate large cardinal axioms) that\ncontains the large cardinal asserted to exist by \u03a6. The branch of\nset theory known as inner model theory is devoted to the\nconstruction of such \u201cL-like\u201d models for stronger and stronger\nlarge cardinal axioms.\n\n\nIn this way the theories of the form ZFC+LC, where LC is a large\ncardinal axiom, provide a yardstick for measuring the strength of\ntheories.  They also act as intermediaries for comparing theories\nfrom conceptually distinct domains: Given ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8\none finds large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8 such that (using\nthe methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03a6 are\nmutually interpretable and ZFC+\u03c8 and ZFC+\u03a8 are mutually\ninterpretable.  One then compares ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8 (in terms\nof interpretability) by mediating through the natural interpretability\nrelationship between ZFC+\u03a6 and ZFC+\u03a8.  So large\ncardinal axioms (in conjunction with the dual method of inner and outer\nmodels) lie at the heart of the remarkable empirical fact that\nnatural theories from completely distinct domains can be compared in\nterms of interpretability.\n\n5. Some Philosophical Considerations\n\n\nThe main question that arises in light of the independence results is\nwhether one can justify new axioms that settle the statements left\nundecided by the standard axioms.  There are two views.  On the first\nview, the answer is taken to be negative and one embraces a radical\nform of pluralism in which one has a plethora of equally legitimate\nextensions of the standard axioms.  On the second view, the answer is\ntaken (at least in part) to be affirmative, and the results simply\nindicate that ZFC is too weak to capture the mathematical truths.\nThis topic is quite involved and lies outside the scope of the present\narticle.  \n\n\n\n\nBut there are other philosophical questions more directly related to\nthe themes of this article.  First, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that the large cardinal axioms appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability?  Second, what is the significance of the\nempirical fact that large cardinal axioms play a central role in\ncomparing many theories from conceptually distinct domains?  Let us\nconsider these two questions in turn.\n\n\nOne might try to argue that the fact that the large cardinal axioms\nare wellordered under interpretability is a consideration in their\nfavour.  However, this would be a weak argument.  For, as we have\nnoted above, all \u201cnatural\u201d theories appear to be wellordered\nunder interpretability and this includes theories that are\nincompatible with one another.  For example, it is straightforward to\nselect \u201cnatural\u201d theories from higher and higher degrees of theories\nin the wellordered sequence that are incompatible with one another.\nIt follows that the feature of being wellordered under\ninterpretability, while remarkable, can not be a point in favour of\ntruth.\n\n\nBut large cardinal axioms have additional features that singles them\nout from the class of natural theories in the wellordered sequence of\ndegrees.  To begin with they provide the most natural way to climb the\nhierarchy of interpretability\u2014they are the simplest and most natural\nmanifestation of pure mathematical strength.  But more important is\nthe second component mentioned above, namely, the large cardinal\naxioms act as intermediaries in comparing theories from conceptually\ndistinct domains.  For recall how this works: Given ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03c8 one finds large cardinal axioms \u03a6 and \u03a8 such\nthat (using the methods of inner and outer models) ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03a6 are mutually interpretable and ZFC+\u03c8 and ZFC+\u03a8\nare mutually interpretable.  One then compares ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+\u03c8 (in terms of interpretability) by mediating through the\nnatural interpretability relationship between ZFC+\u03a6 and\nZFC+\u03a8.\n\n\nIt turns out that in many cases this is the only known way to\ncompare ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+\u03c8, that is, in many cases there is\nno direct interpretation in either direction, instead one must\n  pass through the large cardinal axioms.  Can this additional\nfeature be used to make a case for large cardinal axioms?  The answer\nis unclear.  However, what is clear is the absolute centrality of\nlarge cardinal axioms in set theory.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackermann, Wilhelm, 1937, \u201cDie Widerspruchsfreiheit der allgemeinen Mengenlehre,\u201d\n<em>Mathematische Annalen</em>, 114: 305\u2013315.", "Barwise, Jon K., 1977, <em>Handbook of Mathematical Logic</em>\n(Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics: 90),\nAmsterdam: North-Holland.", "Buss, Samuel R., 1998a, \u201cFirst-Order Proof Theory of Arithmetic,\u201d\nin Buss 1998b, 79\u2013147.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1998b, <em>Handbook of Proof Theory</em>\n(Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics: 137), \nAmsterdam: North Holland.", "Feferman, Solomon, 1960, \u201cArithmetization of metamathematics\n  in a general setting,\u201d <em>Fundamenta Mathematicae</em>,\n 49: 35\u201392.", "Foreman, Matthew and Kanamori, Akihiro, 2009, <em>Handbook of Set Theory</em>,\nBerlin: Springer-Verlag.", "G\u00f6del, Kurt, 1946, \u201cRemarks before the Princeton\nbicentennial conference on problems in mathematics,\u201d in\nG\u00f6del 1990, 150\u2013153.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1986, <em>Collected Works I: Publications 1929\u20131936</em>,\nS.
