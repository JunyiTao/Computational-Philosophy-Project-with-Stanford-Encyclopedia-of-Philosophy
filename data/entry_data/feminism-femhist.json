    "preamble": "\n\n\nThe past twenty-five years have seen an explosion of feminist writing on the\nphilosophical canon, a development that has clear parallels in other\ndisciplines like literature and art history. Since most of the writing\nis, in one way or another, critical of the tradition, a natural\nquestion to ask is: Why does the history of philosophy have importance\nfor feminist philosophers? This question assumes that the history of\nphilosophy is of importance for feminists, an assumption that is\nwarranted by the sheer volume of recent feminist writing on the canon.\nThis entry explores the different ways that feminist philosophers are\ninteracting with the Western philosophical tradition. \n\n\nFeminist philosophers engaged in a project of re-reading and\nre-forming the philosophical canon have noticed two significant areas\nof concern. The first is the problem of historical exclusion. Feminist\nphilosophers are faced with a tradition that believes that there are no\nwomen philosophers and, if there are any, they are unimportant. Of\ncourse, women are not entirely absent from the history of philosophy,\nand that brings us to the second challenge we face. Canonical\nphilosophers have had plenty to say about women and what we are like.\nIn general terms, we often find that philosophical norms like reason\nand objectivity are defined in contrast to matter, the irrational or\nwhatever a given philosopher associates with women and the feminine.\nOur tradition tells us, either implicitly through images and metaphors,\nor explicitly in so many words, that philosophy itself, and its norms\nof reason and objectivity, exclude everything that is feminine or\nassociated with women.\n\n\nIn response, feminist philosophers have criticized both the\nhistorical exclusion of women from the philosophical tradition, and the\nnegative characterization of women or the feminine in it. Feminist\nhistorians of philosophy have argued that the historical record is\nincomplete because it omits women philosophers, and it is biased\nbecause it devalues any women philosophers it forgot to omit. In\naddition, feminist philosophers have argued that the philosophical\ntradition is conceptually flawed because of the way that its\nfundamental norms like reason and objectivity are gendered\nmale.[1]\n By means of these criticisms, feminist\nphilosophers are enlarging the philosophical canon and re-evaluating\nits norms, in order to include women in the philosophical \u201cus\u201d.\n\n\nThe following entry contains 4 major sections. Section 1 (\u201cFeminist\nCriticisms of the Canon as Misogynist\u201d) describes feminist readings of\nthe philosophical canon that challenge its derogatory characterizations\nof women. These are of three kinds: (a) readings that record the\nexplicit misogyny of great philosophers (like Aristotle's description\nof a female as a deformed male); (b) readings that argue for gendered\ninterpretations of theoretical concepts (like matter and form in\nAristotle); (c) synoptic interpretations of the canon (like the view\nthat, historically, reason and objectivity are gendered male). The\nthird category of feminist criticisms of the canon diagnoses where\nphilosophy as a whole went most deeply wrong, and, in doing so, it\nconstructs a negative canon of philosophy. The negative canon exposes\nthe ways in which the views of canonical philosophers throughout the\nhistory of philosophy are explicitly or implicitly misogynist or\nsexist. Section 2 (\u201cFeminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy\u201d)\ndiscusses the response of feminist philosophy to the myths that there\nare no women philosophers and, in any case, no important ones. One\nresponse has been the retrieval of women philosophers for the\nhistorical record. A related development is the elevation to the canon\nof women philosophers like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and\nSimone de Beauvoir. Finally, feminist revisions to the history of \nphilosophy and the canon raise important and pressing questions \nconcerning how to weave women philosophers securely into the story \nof philosophy so that they begin to appear in the philosophical \ncurriculum.  Section 3 (\u201cFeminist Appropriation of Canonical\nPhilosophers\u201d) examines the way that feminist philosophers have been\nengaged in rereading the canon looking for antecedents to feminist\nphilosophy in the work of those philosophers (e.g. Hume) and those\ntheories (e.g. Arisotle's virtue ethics) that are most congenial to\ncurrent trends in feminism or which provide most fuel for feminist\nthought. This is to use the canon as other movements have done\u2014as a\nresource, and as confirmation that a feminist perspective or problem is\nsecurely rooted in our philosophical culture. Section 4 (Feminist \nMethodological Reflections on the History of Philosophy) discusses \nthe methodological issues raised by feminist work on the history of \nphilosophy.  Feminists who are critical of traditional methods of \nreading the history of philosophy have proposed several alternative \nreading strategies that they argue are better suited to feminist \npurposes than traditional methods.  These writers are particularly \nskeptical of the appropriation project outlined in section 3 and \ntheir skepticism provokes interesting questions about what it is \nwe do when we do the history of philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist\nWomen are capable of education, but they are not made for\nactivities which demand a universal faculty such as the more advanced\nsciences, philosophy and certain forms of artistic production. ...\nWomen regulate their actions not by the demands of universality, but by\narbitrary inclinations and opinions. \n\n(Hegel 1973: 263)\n\n\n\nThe idea that the gender of philosophers is important or even relevant\nto their work is a thought that runs counter to the self-image of\nphilosophy. So, it is interesting to explore how and why feminist\nphilosophers came to the realization that gender is a useful analytic\ncategory to apply to the history of philosophy. We can distinguish two\naspects to this process although, in many cases, the two aspects merge\ninto a single project. The first stage of realizing the importance of\ngender consisted of the cataloguing of the explicit misogyny of most of\nthe canon. The second stage consisted of probing the theories of\ncanonical philosophers in order to uncover the gender bias lurking in\ntheir supposedly universal theories. The second stage, the discovery\nthat a philosopher's supposedly universal and objective theories were\ngender specific, raised the further question of whether or not the\ntheoretical gender bias was intrinsic to the theory or extrinsic to it.\nLet me illustrate these points with Aristotle. \n1.1 Explicit Statements of Misogyny in Philosophical Texts\n\n\nThere is no doubt that Aristotle's texts are misogynist; he thought\nthat women were inferior to men, and he said so explicitly. For example,\nto cite Cynthia Freeland's catalogue: \u201cAristotle says that the courage\nof a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter\nyearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the\nbeautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an\nincomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only\nmatter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a\nwoman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a\ntragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too\nclever\u201d(Freeland 1994: 145\u201346). However dispiriting or annoying this\nlitany is, and whatever problems it presents to a woman studying or\nteaching Aristotle, it can be argued that Aristotle simply held a\nmistaken view about women and their capacities (as did most Athenians\nof his time). But, if this is so, then Aristotle's theories, or most of\nthem, are not tarnished by his statements about women, and we can\nignore them, since they are false. \n\n\nHere Aristotle is the chosen example, but similar feminist\ncritiques are available chronicling the explicit misogyny of other\ncanonical figures like Plato and Kant. Feminist criticisms of Plato's\ntheories stress dialogues (like the Timaeus and Laws)\nthat characterize women as inferior to men rather than the egalitarian\nRepublic. Kant's writings, like Aristotle's, provide the ideal\ntarget for feminist criticism because they contain both overt\nstatements of sexism and racism, and a theoretical framework that can\nbe interpreted along gender lines.[2]\n1.2 Gendered Interpretations of Philosophical Concepts\n\n\nIf we consider Aristotle's theory of hylomorphism we find a connection\nbetween form and being male, and matter and being female. That is, we\nfind that matter and form are gendered notions in Aristotle (Witt\n1998). By a gendered notion we mean a notion that is connected either\novertly or covertly, either explicitly or metaphorically with gender or\nsexual difference.[3]\n Furthermore, matter and form are not equal\npartners in Aristotle's metaphysics; form is better than matter. And\nsince hylomorphism is the conceptual framework that underlies most of\nAristotelian theory from metaphysics and philosophy of mind to biology\nand literary theory, it looks as if his supposedly universal and\nobjective theories are gendered, and it looks as if his negative\ncharacterization of women tarnishes his philosophical theories.\n\n\nAre Aristotle's theories intrinsically gendered and sexist, so that\ngender cannot be removed without altering the theories themselves?\nSeveral feminist philosophers have developed this thesis. For example,\nin \u201cWoman Is Not a Rational Animal\u201d, Lynda Lange argues that\nAristotle's theory of sex difference is implicated in every piece of\nAristotle's metaphysical jargon, and she concludes that \u201cit is not at\nall clear that it [Aristotle's theory of sex difference] can simply be\ncut away without any reflection on the status of the rest of the\nphilosophy\u201d(Harding and Hintikka 1983: 2). Elizabeth Spelman has argued\nthat Aristotle's politicized metaphysics is reflected in his theory of\nsoul, which, in turn, is used to justify the subordination of women in\nthe Politics (Spelman 1983). And, finally, Susan Okin has argued that\nAristotle's functionalist theory of form was devised by Aristotle in\norder to legitimate the political status quo in Athens, including\nslavery and the inequality of women (Okin 1979: ch. 4).\n\n\nIf these scholars are right, then Aristotle's theories are\nintrinsically biased against women, and it is unlikely that they can\nhave any value for feminists beyond the project of learning about the\nways in which the philosophical tradition has devalued women.\nAlternatively, Charlotte Witt has argued that the suspect gender associations with\nAristotelian matter and form are extrinsic to these concepts, and\ntherefore removable from Aristotle's theories without substantially\naltering them (Witt 1998). The argument that Aristotle's gender\nassociations are not intrinsic to his concepts of matter (female) and\nform (male) turns on the incompatibility of the position that matter is\nintrinsically female, and form intrinsically male with the position\nthat every composite substance is a unity of matter and form. If every\ncomposite substance is a complex of matter and form, then each would be\na hermaphrodite, rather than a male or a female as is the case with\nanimals. Moreover, whatever plausibility gender associations with\nmatter and form might have with regard to animals, is lost entirely\nwhen we consider artifacts, like shoes and beds. If intrinsic gender\nassociations with matter and form are incompatible with Aristotle's\ntheory of substance and extrinsic gender associations are compatible\nwith that theory, then the principle of charity dictates that we opt\nfor the consistent interpretation.  Recent work on sexism in Aristotle's philosophy\nfocuses on his theory of animal reproduction in the biological writings.\nTo what extent and in what ways is Aristotle's theory of animal generation sexist?\n(Henry 2007; Nielsen 2008)  A related issue concerns how Aristotle's view of\nsexual difference in the biology is connected to his ideas about sexual\ndifference in the \u201cPolitics\u201d. (Deslauriers 2009) \n\n\nSometimes, as in the case of Descartes, the feminist argument in\nfavor of a gendered theory is subtle since, unlike Aristotle, he\nexpresses both a personal and a theoretical commitment to equality.\nFurther, his theories are not stated using gendered notions. Yet, some\nfeminists have argued that his theory of mind-body dualism and his\nabstract characterization of reason resonate with gender implications\u2014\non the assumption that women are emotional and bodily creatures (e.g.\nScheman 1993; Bordo 1987; Lloyd 1993b, ch. 3).\n1.3 Synoptic Interpretations of the Philosophical Canon\n\n\nThe philosophical canon can allow the luster some of its members to be\ntarnished by feminist criticism, just as it has weathered criticisms\nfrom analytic or continental perspectives. The most radical feminist\ncritics, however, have urged that the canon's central philosophical\nnorms and values, like reason and objectivity, are gendered notions.\nThe synoptic approach considers the Western philosophical tradition as a\nwhole, and argues that its core concepts are gendered male. But, if\nthis is so, then the Western philosophical tradition as a whole, and\nthe central concepts that we have inherited from it, requires critical\nscrutiny by feminists. Moreover, philosophy's self-image as universal\nand objective, rather than particular and biased, is mistaken. \n\n\nFeminist synoptic interpretations of the canon take several forms.\nThe first, exemplified by Genevieve Lloyd's Man of Reason,\nargues that reason and objectivity in the history of philosophy are\ngendered male.[4]\n The way that reason and objectivity are\ngendered male varies as philosophical theory and historical period\nvaries, but the fact that they are gendered is a constant. From\nAristotle to Hume, from Plato to Sartre, reason is associated with\nmaleness. Therefore, the notion of reason that we have inherited,\nwhether we are empiricists or existentialists, requires critical\nscrutiny.\n\n\nThe second form of synoptic interpretation, exemplified by Susan\nBordo's The Flight to Objectivity, argues that the modern\nperiod in philosophy, and, in particular, the philosophy of Descartes,\nis the source of our ideals of reason and objectivity that are gendered\nmale. In other words, this story chronicles a turn in philosophy\ncoincident with the rise of modern science, which generated ideals of\nreason and objectivity that are deeply antagonistic to women and\nfeminism.[5]\n Cartesian rationalism and the norms of\nmodern science mark a decisive break with a philosophical and cultural\ntradition that was more accommodating of female characteristics and\npowers.\n\n\nIt is important to note that Lloyd and Bordo differ not only with\nregard to the historical story they tell concerning the maleness of\nreason, but also with regard to the way they understand that maleness.\nFor Lloyd, the maleness of reason is symbolic and metaphorical rather\nthan cultural or psychological. Lloyd does not intend the maleness of\nreason to refer to either a socially constituted gender category or a\npsychological orientation shared by males. \u201cThis book is not a direct\nstudy of gender identity. It seeks rather to contribute to the\nunderstanding of how the male-female distinction operates as a symbol\nin traditional philosophical texts, and of its interactions with\nexplicit philosophical views of reason\u201d.[6]\n In understanding the\nmaleness of reason as symbolic rather than as psychological or social,\nLloyd avoids making a theoretical commitment to any particular\npsychology of sex differences or any particular account of the social\nformation of gender identity. What she gains in flexibility, however,\nshe loses in content, since it is difficult to specify exactly what\nmetaphorical maleness is, and how it is related to psychological or\nsocial maleness. Other feminists have attempted to develop an account\nof how male metaphors and symbols undermine philosophical arguments\n(Rooney 1991).\n\n\nFor Bordo, however, the maleness of Cartesian reason is given both a\nsocial meaning and a psychological content. First, the social meaning\nof maleness: \u201cIn the seventeenth century it [the feminine orientation\ntoward the world] was decisively purged from the dominant intellectual\nculture, through the Cartesian \u2018rebirthing\u2019 and\nrestructuring of knowledge and the world as masculine\u201d(Bordo 1987:\n100). This social meaning is paired with a psychological consequence:\n\u201cThe \u2018great Cartesian anxiety,\u2019 although manifestly\nexpressed in epistemological terms, discloses itself as anxiety over\nseparation from the organic female universe\u201d(Bordo 1987: 5). Cartesian\n\u2018anxiety\u2019 is separation anxiety from mother nature; the\nrational norms of clarity and distinctness are read as symptoms of\nthis anxiety.[7]\n Bordo's social-psychological notion of\nmaleness while rich and explicit, provides a large target for critics\nbecause it is based on a controversial historical thesis (that the 17th\ncentury showed a marked increase in gynophobia) and a disputed\npsychological theory of the family (Object Relations Theory).\n\n\nLuce Irigaray takes a radical stance towards the history of\nphilosophy by trying to indicate what is suppressed and hidden in the\ntradition rather than cataloguing its evident \u201cmaleness\u201d. Her work,\nlike Bordo's, makes use of psychoanalytic theory in interpreting texts\nand, like Lloyd's, it explores the symbolic associations of\nphilosophical images and concepts. However, unlike Bordo and Lloyd,\nIrigaray uses highly unconventional methods of interpreting canonical\nphilosophical texts in order to uncover the ways in which the feminine\nor sexual difference is repressed in them. For example, Irigaray uses\nhumor and parody rather than straightforward exegesis, and she points\nto instabilities (contradictions) in philosophical texts as symptoms of\npatriarchal thinking. According to Irigaray, patriarchal thinking\nattempts to achieve universality by repressing sexual difference. But,\nthe presence of contradictions or instabilities in a philosophical text\nis symptomatic of the failure of patriarchal thinking to contain sexual\ndifference. For example, Irigaray might look at the argument we\ndescribed above for considering gender associations with form and\nmatter in Aristotle to be extrinsic, rather than intrinsic, to those\nconcepts, and argue that the fact that Aristotle's hylomorphism as a\nuniversal theory is incompatible with gender associations is a symptom\nof patriarchal thinking rather than evidence that the proposed\ninterpretation is\n mistaken.[8]\n\n\nDespite their different historical stories, and the different ways\nthat they understand the maleness of reason, each of these panoramic\nvisions of the history of philosophy deliver the same moral, which is\nthat the central norms that inform our philosophical culture today are\ngendered male.[9]\n Hence, these synoptic narratives of the\nphilosophical tradition provide historical justifications for feminist\nphilosophers who are critical of our central philosophical norms of\nreason and objectivity. Does the feminist synoptic critical reading of\nthe history of philosophy justify either the conclusion that\ntraditional conceptions of reason ought to be flat-out rejected by\nfeminists or the conclusion that traditional conceptions of reason\nought to be subjected to critical scrutiny?\n\n\nEven if feminist historical arguments are successful in showing that\nphilosophical norms like reason and objectivity are gendered male, this\nconclusion does not justify a flat-out rejection of either traditional\nphilosophy or its norms of reason and objectivity (Witt 1993). Recall\nthe distinction introduced above between intrinsically and\nextrinsically gendered notions. An intrinsically gendered notion is one\nthat necessarily carries implications regarding gender, i.e., if one\nwere to cancel all implications concerning gender, one would be left\nwith a different notion than the original. In contrast, an\nextrinsically gendered notion typically does carry implications\nconcerning gender, but not necessarily so. If the maleness of reason is\nextrinsic to the traditional concept of reason, then the historical\nfact that it was a gendered notion does not justify or require its\nrejection by feminists. If on the other hand, it can be shown that the\nmaleness of reason is intrinsic to it, it still does not follow that\nreason ought to be rejected by feminists. For, the idea the reason is\nintrinsically male-biased would justify a rejection of it only if it\nought to be other than it is. So, what needs to be argued is that\nreason and objectivity would be different, and better, if they were not\ngendered male, but were gender-neutral, gender-inclusive or female.\nBut, if feminist philosophers develop this argument, which they need to\nbuttress the historical argument, then they are reconceptualizing\ntraditional notions of reason and objectivity rather than rejecting\nthem.\n\n\nEven though the work that feminist philosophers have done to show\nthe ways in which traditional conceptions of reason and objectivity are\nassociated with maleness falls short of justifying their rejection,\ntheir work has been valuable in two respects. First, it has established\nthat gender is associated with the central norms of philosophy, a\nconclusion that warrants attention from anyone attempting to understand\nour philosophical tradition. Second, the historical studies raise\nquestions about reason and objectivity that are valuable areas of\ninquiry for contemporary philosophers.\n2. Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy\nThese women are not women on the fringes of philosophy, but\nphilosophers on the fringes of history. \n\n\u2014Mary Ellen Waithe\n\n\n\nFeminist canon revision is most distinctive, and most radical, in\nits retrieval of women philosophers for the historical record, and in\nits placement of women in the canon of great philosophers. It is a\ndistinctive project because there is no comparable activity undertaken\nby other contemporary philosophical movements, for whom canon creation\nhas been largely a process of selection from an already established\nlist of male philosophers. It is a radical project because by\nuncovering a history of women philosophers, it has destroyed the\nalienating myth that philosophy was, and by implication is or ought to\nbe, a male preserve.\n\n\nIn A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen Waithe has\ndocumented at least 16 women philosophers in the classical world, 17\nwomen philosophers from 500\u20131600, and over 30 from 1600\u20131900.\n\n\nAnd, in the recent feminist series Re-reading the Canon\nseven of the thirty-five canonical philosophers are women: including Mary\nWollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir. What is crucial\nto understand is that none of the three is canonical\u2014if by that you\nmean included in the history of philosophy as it is told in philosophy\ndepartment curricula, in histories of philosophy, and in scholarly\nwriting. Still, there has been progress.\n\n\nConsider that The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, published in\n1967, which contains articles on over 900 philosophers, did not\ninclude an entry for Wollstonecraft, Arendt or de Beauvoir. Moreover,\nif the index is to be believed, de Beauvoir and Wollstonecraft are not\nmentioned at all in any article, and Hannah Arendt merits a single\nmention in an article on \u201cAuthority\u201d.  Far from being canonical, these\nwomen philosophers were scarcely even marginal, warranting perhaps a\npassing reference in a survey of existentialism or political\nphilosophy, but little\n more.[10]\n By 1998, however, The Routledge\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy had entries for all three, and also\nmany other important women philosophers.\n\n\nThe project of retrieving women philosophers has a paradoxical\nrelationship with contemporary feminist theory, however. On the one\nhand, it is clearly a feminist project; its originators were interested\nin establishing that women have been philosophers throughout the\nhistory of the discipline despite their routine omission from standard\nhistories and encyclopedias of philosophy. However, the newly-recovered women philosophers suggest that there is little overlap\namong three groups: women philosophers, feminine philosophers and\nfeminist philosophers. For most of the newly discovered women\nphilosophers were not feminist thinkers nor did they write philosophy\nin a feminine voice, different from their male counterparts. Indeed,\ntheir breadth of philosophical interests is comparable to that of male\nphilosophers although their domain of application sometimes differs. In\nher introduction to A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen\nWaithe comments \u201cIf we except the Pythagorean women, we find little\ndifferences in the ways men and women did philosophy. Both have been\nconcerned with ethics, metaphysics, cosmology, epistemology and other\nareas of philosophic inquiry\u201d (Waithe 1987\u20131991 Vol. 1: xxi). And\nanother editor, Mary Warnock, comments \u201cIn the end, I have not found\nany clear \u2018voice\u2019 shared by women philosophers\u201d (Warnock 1996: xlvii).\nThe women philosophers restored to the tradition by feminist hands are\nnot all proto-feminists nor do they speak in a uniform, and different,\nvoice from their male peers.\n\n\nSimilarly, women philosophers who are candidates for initiation into\nthe philosophical canon\u2014like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and\nSimone de Beauvoir\u2014are a diverse crew. According to Elizabeth\nYoung-Bruehl \u201cThat Hannah Arendt should have become a provocative\nsubject for feminists is startling\u201d presumably because of Arendt's\nexplicit criticism of feminism. And while Wollstonecraft and de\nBeauvoir were both feminists, they share neither a common philosophical\nvoice nor common philosophical principles. In The Vindication of\nthe Rights of Women Wollstonecraft argued for the education of\nwomen using Enlightenment principles, while Beauvoir's The Second\nSex reflects her marxist and existentialist roots.\n\n\nThe diversity of women philosophers raises the question why their\nrecovery or re-valuation is an important project for contemporary\nfeminist theory. What the retrieval of women philosophers, and their\ninclusion in the philosophical canon has done is to challenge the myth\nthat there are no women in the history of philosophy and the fallback\nposition that if there are any women philosophers, they are\nunimportant. Lovers of wisdom that we all are, we all benefit from the\ncorrection of these mistaken beliefs. Moreover, as feminists, we are\ninterested in correcting the effects of discrimination against women\nphilosophers, who were written out of history, unfairly, because of\ntheir gender not their philosophical ideas.\n\n\nHowever, what is really at issue is not philosophy's past, but its\npresent; its self-image as male. That self-image is created and\nmaintained in part by a tacit historical justification. It is a\ndamaging self-image for women philosophers today, and for women who\naspire to be philosophers. The real significance of uncovering the\npresence of women in our history, and in placing women in our canon is\nthe effect that has on the way we think about the \u201cus\u201d of\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe rediscovery of women philosophers raises the following question:  \nHow can women philosophers be rewoven into the history of philosophy \nso that they are an integral part of that history?  Lisa Shapiro, considering the case of women philosophers in the \nearly modern period, argues that it is not enough to simply add a woman \nphilosopher or two to the reading list (Shapiro 1994).  Rather, according to Shapiro,\nwe need to provide internal reasons for the inclusion of women \nphilosophers rather than relying upon a feminist motivation on the part \nof the teacher or editor. The history of philosophy is a story and we \nneed to find a plot line that includes new, female characters.\n\n\nOne way to do this is to show how certain women philosophers made \nsignificant contributions to the work of male philosophers on central \nphilosophical issues.  We could call this the \u201cBest Supporting \nActress\u201d approach in that the central cast remains male and the story \nline of philosophy is undisturbed.  It is a good strategy for several \nreasons:  it is relatively easy to accomplish, and it provides an \ninternal anchor for women philosophers.  On the other hand, it \nreinforces the secondary status of women thinkers and if this were \nthe only way of integrating women philosophers, that would be an \nunfortunate result.  The wholly inadequate interpretation of  \nBeauvoir's philosophical thought as a mere application of  Jean-Paul \nSartre's is a good example of the limitations of this strategy.  Not \nonly does is reinforce a secondary, handmaiden role for Beauvoir, \nbut it also promotes a distorted understanding and appreciation of \nher thought (Simons 1995).\n\n\nAlternatively, we could find in the work of women philosophers issues\nthat they have developed in a sequential fashion.  Shapiro suggests \nthat there are certain philosophical issues concerning women's \nrationality, nature, and education that women philosophers of the \nseventeenth century discuss extensively in a sequential, interactive \nfashion. The thread extends into the following century in the work of  \nJean-Jacques Rousseau and Wollstonecraft. Since philosophers become \ncanonical as part of a story anchored at one end by contemporary \nphilosophical questions that are thought to be central, the task \nwould be to make these questions ones that we turn to the tradition \nfor help in answering.  And, of course, these are precisely the \ncentral questions posed and discussed extensively by contemporary \nfeminism.  Thus, the idea is that as we pose new kinds of questions \nto the history of philosophy we will find in women philosophers an \nimportant, sequential discussion that we can securely thread into \nour curricula and textbooks.\n\n\nAt this relatively early stage of the process of including women in\nthe history of philosophy we need all to use all three strategies.\nThere is nothing wrong with a purely external approach.  By all means\none should include a woman philosopher on a topic just to provide an\nindication that there are some interesting and important women working\non a particular topic.  And the strategy of anchoring a woman\nphilosopher's work to a male canonical figure can also be a useful\nstrategy as long as it is done in a manner that preserves the\nindependence and originality of her work.  Finally, it is important to\nask new questions of the tradition, questions that might allow some\nwomen philosophers to play a starring role rather than a walk-on\npart.\n2.1 Early Modern Women Philosophers: A Case Study\n\n\nFrom about the mid-1990s, there has been a concerted effort by\nscholars both to rehabilitate the works of early modern women\nphilosophers and to integrate at least some of these women into the\nphilosophical canon. These efforts illustrate how a range of different\nfeminist approaches to the history of philosophy can be integrated\ntogether.\n\n\nWhile many contemporary philosophers have little knowledge of the\nwomen philosophers of the early modern period, there are in fact good\nhistorical records of these women and their works. This fact has made\nthe doxographic task of retrieving these women thinkers a relatively\nstraightforward one, even if labor intensive. O'Neill (1998) catalogs a\nlong list of these women, and her doxographical work has provided a\nstarting point for both expanding the list and interpreting the\nphilosophical works of these women.\n\n\nIt is worth considering the context in which these women were\nwriting and what it suggests about their feminist methodology in the\nhistory of philosophy. Though anachronistic, it seems appropriate to\ncharacterize at least some of these women, along with some of the their\nmale contemporaries, as engaged in a feminist project. Many of these\nthinkers were self-consciously countering a recognized misogyny in\nphilosophy but, insofar as they deployed philosophical methods, they\nwould seem to reject the view that the problem was intrinsic to the\ndiscipline of philosophy itself. While the so-called querelle des\nfemmes had been going on for centuries, the seventeenth century\nmarked a turning point in the debate over the status of women as better\nor worse than men in virtue of their form or soul. (See Kelly 1988.)\nBoth women and men thinkers of the period advanced egalitarian\narguments. So, for instance, Marie De Gournay, in her \u201cOn the Equality\nof Men and Women,\u201d(1622) deployed a skeptical method to argue for the\nequality of men and women (De Gournay 2002); Anna Maria van Schurman\ndeployed syllogistic argumentation to argue for women's education both\nby demonstration and as evidence in her Dissertatio Logica\n(1638) (van Schurman 1998); in her Serious Proposal to the Ladies\nfor the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest (1694)\nMary Astell applied Descartes's sex-neutral account of the mind\n(insofar as mind is really distinct from body, rationality is not tied\nto sex) to argue for women's education (Astell 2002); Fran\u00e7ois\nPoulain de la Barre in On the Equality of the Two Sexes (1673)\nalso drew on Cartesian principles to argue for the social equality of\nmen and women (Poulain de la Barre 2002) . (Clarke 2013 collects de\nGournay, van Schurman and Poulain de la Barre together.) While the\nmethods deployed by these thinkers are different, they all appropriate\nphilosophical methods \u2013 skepticism, basic rules of inference, a new\nmetaphysics \u2013 different from what was then the dominant Aristotelian\nparadigm to counter misogynist claims.\n\n\nContemporary scholars concerned to reintegrate these women into the\nphilosophical canon have tended to adopt a strategy that does not\nassume that standard philosophical concepts or the canon itself are\ngender biased. Rather scholars aim (1) to make long out-of-print texts\naccessible again; (2) to develop interpretations of these texts that\n(a) bring out their philosophical content and (b) demonstrate the\ninvolvement of these women in the philosophical debates of the period.\nThe bibliographical appendix to this entry can direct readers to some\nrecent editions of writings by early modern women. The remainder of\nthis section sketches out one way in which scholars have pursued the\nsecond aim, and suggests some others.\n\n\nOne of the central themes of early modern philosophy is the\nreconceptualization of causation. Scholastic philosophy largely\nunderstood causation on an Aristotelian model, on which all change was\nto be explained by a constellation of four causes: final, formal,\nmaterial and efficient causes. Early modern thinking about causation\nbegan with a rejection of final and formal causes. Determining final\ncauses involved a speculation that outstripped human understanding,\nwhile formal causes were dismissed as occult qualities, simple\nassertions that things worked without an intelligible explanation of\nhow they did so. Several canonical figures in early modern philosophy\n\u2013 Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume and Kant \u2013 are often situated with\nrespect to one another through their views on causation. In recent\nyears, Malebranche, with his account of occasionalist causation, (a\nview on which neither bodies nor minds have causal power in themselves,\nand God is the only efficient cause), has been worked into the story.\nWhat Malebranche highlights is that understanding the nature of\ncausation was a live philosophical problem: while there was agreement\nabout dismissing final and formal causation, there was much\ndisagreement about what should replace it, and in particular about the\nnature of efficient causation. Some early modern women thinkers were\nvery much involved in this debate, and they are just as easily\nincorporated into the philosophical story as Malebranche. For instance,\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia, in her 1643 correspondence with him,\nquestions Descartes about the nature of causation between mind and\nbody. She can be read as insisting that an adequate account of\ncausation must be applicable in all causal contexts. Margaret\nCavendish, in her Observations on the Experimental Philosophy,\ndevelops a vitalist account of causation wherein motion is not\ntransferred from one body to another, but rather one body comes to be\nin motion through a self-patterning in harmony with another body around\nit. (The SEP entry on Margaret Cavendish provides a more detailed\nsummary of Cavendish's account of causation, along with guidance for\nfurther reading.) While Cavendish's account of causation did not carry\nthe day, vitalism of one form or another was a dominant strand of\nthought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is worth noting\nthat vitalism is also a position within contemporary philosophy of\nbiology.\n\n\nA similar strategy for incorporating women into the philosophical\ncanon can be used with respect to such central topics as the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason (Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet), free will (Cavendish,\nDamaris Masham, du Ch\u00e2telet), and cosmology (Cavendish, Anne\nConway, Masham, Mary Astell, du Ch\u00e2telet; see Lascano\n(forthcoming)). The SEP entry on du Ch\u00e2telet contains a helpful\ndiscussion on her position on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, as\nwell as an array of secondary sources. The SEP entries on Cavendish,\nMasham and du Ch\u00e2telet provide some detail as to their positions\nregarding free will.\n\n\nHowever, one can also move to incorporate women into our\nphilosophical history by rethinking the questions through which that\nhistory is structured. How the questions are framed influences who is\ntaken to have interesting answers on offer. Within the early modern\nperiod, questions in epistemology are often about the nature of reason\nand rationality, and the limits of the human understanding. While women\nof the period sometimes address these questions theoretically, more\noften they are concerned with implications of such answers for training\nthe human mind. That is, they are concerned with matters of education,\nand they directly relate positions on education to positions on the\nnature of human understanding and rationality. Already mentioned are\nthe works of Anna Maria van Schurman and Mary Astell, but others\nincluding Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry and Gabrielle Suchon also wrote\non education. While education is not today typically taken to be\ncentral to philosophy, a little reflection on the history of philosophy\ncan destabilize this contemporary outlook. Descartes's Discourse on\nMethod for Rightly Conducting Reason (1637) is arguably a work\nabout education; John Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation (1693) and On the Conduct of the Understanding\n(1706); and Rousseau's Emile (1762) also concerns education.\nEqually, education is a central concern of philosophers predating the\nearly modern period (consider Plato in Republic) and after it\n(consider John Dewey). Reconsidering education as a central question of\nphilosophy can facilitate seeing women thinkers as contributing\ncentrally to philosophical projects.\n3. Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers\n\n\nFeminist philosophers have also changed the history of philosophy by\nappropriating its ideas for feminist purposes. From the perspective of\nnegative canon formation, the history of philosophy is a resource only\nin so far as it describes the theories and thinkers that were most\ndeeply mistaken about women. Other feminist historians of philosophy\nhave found important resources for feminism in canonical philosophers.\nIndeed, they have found valuable concepts even in the worst offenders\nof the negative canon, like Aristotle and Descartes.\n\n\nFor example, in The Fragility of Goodness Martha Nussbaum\nhas described the virtues of an Aristotelian ethics with its emphasis\non the importance of concrete context, emotion and care for others in\nan ethical life (Nussbaum 1986). And Marcia Homiak has argued that\nAristotle's rational ideal, far from being antithetical to feminists,\nactually captures some of feminism's deepest ethical insights (Homiak\n1993). With regard to Descartes, Margaret Atherton has argued that his\nconcept of reason was interpreted in egalitarian rather than\nmasculinist terms by several women philosophers of the 18th century,\nand was used in their arguments for equal education for \nwomen.[11]\n\n\nOther feminists have urged the reconsideration of the views of\ncanonical figures, like Hume and Dewey, who have played only a minor\nrole in the negative feminist canon. For example, Annette Baier has\nargued at length for the value of a Humean perspective in both\nepistemology and in ethics for feminist theory (Baier 1987; Baier\n1993). And, in Pragmatism and Feminism Charlene Seigfried\nargues for the value of pragmatism for feminism; a position also taken\nby Richard Rorty (Seigfried 1996; Rorty 1991).\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that some of the very same philosophers\nwho were cast as the villains of the negative canon are also mined by\nfeminist theorists for useful ideas. Indeed, it is likely that every\nphilosopher, from Plato to Nietzsche, who has been condemned to the\nnegative canon also appears in some feminist's positive canon. This is\nperplexing. After all, if feminists evaluate canonical texts so\ndifferently, it raises questions about the coherence of feminist\ninterpretations of texts. Is Aristotle a feminist hero or villain? Are\nDescartes' ideas dangerous for feminists or useful to them? If\nfeminists have argued both positions, we begin to suspect that there is\nno such thing as a feminist interpretation of a philosopher. And this\nmight lead us to wonder about the coherence and unity of the project of\nfeminist canon revision.\n\n\nWhy is it that feminist philosophers have reached different, and\neven sometimes incompatible interpretations of the history of\nphilosophy? The multiple and contrary readings of the\nphilosophical canon by feminists reflects the contested nature of the\n\u201cus\u201d of contemporary feminism. The fact that feminist interpretations\nof canonical figures is diverse reflects, and is a part of, on-going\ndebates within feminism over its identity and self-image. Disagreements\namong feminist historians of philosophy over the value of canonical\nphilosophers, and the appropriate categories to use to interpret them,\nare, in the final analysis, the result of debate within feminist\nphilosophy over what feminism is, and what is theoretical commitments\nshould be, and what its core values are.\n4.\tFeminist Methodological Reflections on the History of Philosophy\n\n\nDisagreements over the value of the history of philosophy for feminist \ntheory has stimulated discussion concerning the methods and \npresuppositions of the study of the history of philosophy itself.  Can \nfeminists use the history of philosophy as a resource in the same way \nthat other philosophical movements have done?  This question, in turn, \ninspires us to reflect upon different reading strategies that we might \nemploy in relation to the history of philosophy.\n\n\nCynthia Freeland (2000) criticizes the idea that feminists can mine \nthe history of philosophy for useful ideas as other philosophical \nmovements and perspectives have done.  She argues that the feminist \nappropriation/inheritance approach to the history of philosophy is an \nideology.  Freeland defines an ideology as a theory or viewpoint that \nis politically oppressive and epistemically flawed.  Feminists who view \nthe philosophical canon as a resource to be mined for ideas useful to \nfeminism are engaged in a potentially oppressive activity since the \nhistory of philosophy is replete with ideas and theories that are (or \nmight be) oppressive of women today.   The epistemic flaw is that the \nappropriation approach is overly reverential of the tradition and might \ntherefore be insufficiently critical of it.  Deference is not an \nepistemic virtue. Freeland  points out that appropriators tend to use \nstandard criteria of historical interpretation like the principle of \ncharity that tries to find consistency in a philosopher's theories or \ndoctrines.  Following out this line of thought, it turns out that all \nstandard historians of philosophy might be guilty of this epistemic \ndefect since all of them use standard criteria of historical \ninterpretation.  The criticism cuts a wide swath since it requires \nfeminist historians of philosophy to deviate radically from the norms \nof their discipline since it turns out that the norms themselves might \npromote deference and oppression. What kind of feminist engagement with \nthe history of philosophy remains possible?\n\n\nSeveral reading strategies other than the standard have been advocated.  \nSome feminists advocate a radical departure from the norms of textual \ninterpretation by focusing, and drawing out the \u201cunthought\u201d of a text; \nits images and metaphors; its omissions and paradoxes. (Deutscher 1997)  Others \nemphasize the importance of questioning the line demarcating a text \nfrom its cultural, psychological or material context. (Schott 1997)  And yet others \nadvocate for an active philosophical engagement with a text rather \nthan the backward-looking activity of trying to determine the exact\nmeaning of a historical text. (LeDoeuff 1991)  These reading strategies, in turn, \nraise further issues concerning the limits of the history of philosophy\nand the criteria for adequate interpretation.\n",
