    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Trust || Internalism vs. externalism\n2.2 Internalism vs. externalism\n\nPhilosophers who agree that trust can be rational (in a truth- or\nend-directed way or both) tend to disagree about the extent to which\nreasons that make it rational must be accessible to the trustor. Some\nsay that these reasons must be available to this person in order for\ntheir trust to be rational; in that case, the person is or could be\ninternally justified in trusting as they do. Others say that the\nreasons need not be internal but can instead be external to the\ntrustor and lie in what caused the trust, or, more specifically, in\nthe epistemic reliability of what caused it. The trustor also\nneedn\u2019t have access to or be aware of the reliability of these\nreasons. The latter\u2019s epistemology of trust is externalist,\nwhile the former\u2019s is internalist.\n\nSome epistemologists write as though trust is only rational if the\ntrustor themselves has rationally estimated the likelihood that the\ntrustee is trustworthy. For example, Russell Hardin implies that if my\ntrust in you is rational, then\n\n\nI make a rough estimate of the truth of [the] claim \u2026 that you\nwill be trustworthy under certain conditions \u2026 and then I\ncorrect my estimate, or \u201cupdate,\u201d as I obtain new evidence\non you. (2002: 112)\n\n\nOn this view, I must have reasons for my estimate or for my updates\n(Hardin 2002: 130), which could come from inductive generalizations I\nmake about my past experience, from my knowledge that social\nconstraints exist that will encourage your trustworthiness or what\nhave you. Such an internalist epistemology of trust is valuable\nbecause it coheres with the commonsense idea that one ought to have\ngood reasons for trusting people (i.e., reasons grounded in evidence\nthat they will be trustworthy) particularly when something important\nis at stake (E. Fricker 1995). One ought, in other words, to be\nepistemically responsible in one\u2019s trusting (see Frost-Arnold\n2020).\n\nSuch an epistemology is also open to criticisms, however. For example,\nit suggests that rational trust will always be partial rather than\ncomplete, given that the rational trustor is open to evidence that\ncontradicts their trust on this theory, while someone who trusts\ncompletely in someone else lacks such openness. The theory also\nimplies that the reasons for trusting well (i.e., in a justified way)\nare accessible to the trustor, at some point or another, which may\nsimply be false. Some reasons for trust may be too\n\u201ccunning\u201d for this to be the case. Relevant here is the\nreason for trusting discussed by Philip Pettit (1995): that trust\nsignals to people that they are being held in esteem, which is\nsomething they will want to maintain; they will honor the trust\nbecause they are naturally \u201cesteem-seeking\u201d. (Note that\nconsciously having this as a reason for trusting\u2014of using\npeople\u2019s need for esteem to get what you want from them\u2014is\nincompatible with actually trusting (Wanderer and Townsend 2013: 9),\nif trust is motives-based and the required motive is something other\nthan self-interest.)\n\nOthers say that reasons for trust are usually too numerous and varied\nto be open to the conscious consideration of the trustor (e.g., Baier\n1986). There can be very subtle reasons to trust or distrust\nsomeone\u2014for example, reasons that have to do with body language,\nwith systematic yet veiled forms of oppression, or with a complicated\nhistory of trusting others about which one can\u2019t easily\ngeneralize. Factors like these can influence trustors without them\nknowing it, sometimes making their trust irrational (e.g., because it\nis informed by oppressive biases), and other times making it\nrational.\n\nThe concern about there being complex reasons for trusting explain why\nsome philosophers defend externalist epistemologies of trust. Some do\nso explicitly (e.g., McLeod 2002). They argue for reliabilist theories\nthat make trust rationally justified if and only if it is formed and\nsustained by reliable processes (i.e., \u201cprocesses that tend to\nproduce accurate representations of the world\u201d, such as drawing\non expertise one has rather than simply guessing; Goldman 1992: 113;\nGoldman and Beddor 2015 [2016]). Others gesture towards externalism\n(Webb 1993; Baier 1986), as Baier does with what she calls \u201ca\nmoral test for trust\u201d. The test is that\n\n\nknowledge of what the other party is relying on for the continuance of\nthe trust relationship would \u2026 itself destabilize the relation.\n(1986: 255)\n\n\nThe other party might be relying on a threat advantage or the\nconcealment of their untrustworthiness, in which case the trust would\nprobably fail the test. Because Baier\u2019s test focuses on the\ncausal basis for trust, or for what maintains the trust relation, it\nis externalist. Also, because the trustor often cannot gather the\ninformation needed for the test without ceasing to trust the other\nperson (Baier 1986: 260), the test cannot be internalist.\n\nAlthough an externalist theory of trust deals well with some of the\nworries one might have with an internalist theory, it has problems of\nits own. One of the most serious issues is the absence of any\nrequirement that trustors themselves have good (motivating) reasons\nfor trusting, especially when their trust makes them seriously\nvulnerable. Again, it appears that common sense dictates the opposite:\nthat sometimes as trustors, we ought to be able to back up our\ndecisions about when to trust. The same is true about our distrust\npresumably: that sometimes we ought to be able to defend it. Assuming\nexternalists mean for their epistemology to apply to distrust and not\njust to trust, their theory violates this bit of common sense as well.\nExternalism about distrust also seems incompatible with a strategy\nthat some philosophers recommend for dealing with biased distrust. The\nstrategy is to develop what they call \u201ccorrective trust\u201d\n(e.g., Scheman 2020) or \u201chumble trust\u201d (D\u2019Cruz\n2019), which demands a humble skepticism toward distrust that aligns\nwith oppressive stereotypes and efforts at correcting the influence of\nthese stereotypes (see also M. Fricker 2007). The concern about an\nexternalist epistemology is that it does not encourage this sort of\nmental work, since it does not require that we reflect on our reasons\nfor distrusting or trusting.\n\nThere are alternatives to the kinds of internalist and externalist\ntheories just discussed, especially within the literature on\n testimony.[12]\n For example, Paul Faulkner develops an \u201cassurance theory\u201d\nof testimony that interprets speaker trustworthiness in terms of\ntrust-responsiveness. Recall that on a trust-responsiveness theory of\ntrust, being trusted gives people the reason to be trustworthy that\nsomeone is counting on them. They are trustworthy if they are\nappropriately responsive to this reason, which, in the case of\noffering testimony, involves giving one\u2019s assurance that one is\ntelling the truth (Adler 2006 [2017]). Faulkner uses the\ntrust-responsiveness account of trust, along with a view of trust as\nan affective attitude (see\n section 4),\n to show \u201chow trust can ground reasonable testimonial\nuptake\u201d (Faulkner and Simpson 2017: 6; Faulkner 2011 and\n2020).\n\n\nHe proposes that A affectively trust S if and only\nif A depends on S \u03a6-ing, and expects his\ndependence on S to motivate S to \u03a6\u2014for\nA\u2019s dependence on S to be the reason for which\nS \u03a6s \u2026. As a result, affective trust is a\nbootstrapping attitude: I can choose to trust someone affectively and\nmy doing so creates the reasons which justify the attitude. (Faulkner\nand Simpson 2017: 6)\n\n\nMost likely, A (the trustor) is aware of the reasons that\njustify his trust or could be aware of them, making this theory an\ninternalist one. The reasons are also normative and non-evidentiary\n(Faulkner 2020); they concern what S ought to do because of\nA\u2019s dependence, not what S will do based on\nevidence that A might gather about S. This view\ndoesn\u2019t require that A have evidentiary reasons, and so\nit is importantly different than the internalist epistemology\ndiscussed above. But it is then also subject to the criticisms made of\nexternalist theories that they don\u2019t require the kind of\nscrutiny of our trusting attitudes that we tend to expect and probably\nought to expect in societies where some people are stereotyped as more\ntrusting than others.\n\nPresumably to avoid having to defend any particular epistemology of\ntrust, some philosophers provide just a list of common justifiers for\nit (i.e., \u201cfacts or states of affairs that determine the\njustification status of [trust]\u201d; Goldman 1999: 274), which\nsomeone could take into account in deciding when to trust (Govier\n1998; Jones 1996). Included on these lists are such factors as the\nsocial role of the trustee, the domain in which the trust occurs, an\n\u201cagent-specific\u201d factor that concerns how good a trustor\nthe agent tends to be (Jones 1996: 21), and the social or political\nclimate in which the trust occurs. Philosophers have tended to\nemphasize this last factor as a justification condition for trust, and\nso let me elaborate on it briefly.\n",
