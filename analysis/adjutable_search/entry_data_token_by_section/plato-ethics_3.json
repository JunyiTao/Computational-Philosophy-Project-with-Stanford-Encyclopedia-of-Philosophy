The middle dialogues: Justice and other virtues\n3.1 Human nature and its deficiencies\n\r\nIf Plato went through a period of open-ended experimentation and\r\ntentative suggestions, this stage was definitely over by the time he\r\nwrote the Republic, the central work of his middle years.\r\nBecause of the Republic\u2019s importance, a more detailed\r\naccount will be provided here in order to explain the ethical\r\nprinciples set forth in that work, for these principles are closely\r\nintertwined with Plato\u2019s political, psychological, and\r\nmetaphysical conceptions. That the work represents a major change in\r\nPlato\u2019s thinking is indicated already by the dialogue\u2019s\r\nsetting. The aporetic controversy about justice in the\r\nRepublic\u2019s first book is set off quite sharply against\r\nthe constructive discussion that ensues in its remaining nine books.\r\nLike the Gorgias, the first book presents three interlocutors\r\nwho defend, with increasing vigor and contentiousness, their notion of\r\njustice against Socrates\u2019 elenchos. Of these disputes,\r\nthe altercation with the sophist Thrasymachus has received the most\r\nattention because he defends the provocative thesis that natural\r\njustice is the right of the stronger and that conventional justice is,\r\nat best, high-minded foolishness. The counter-arguments employed by\r\nSocrates at the various turns of the discussion will not be presented\r\nhere. Though they reduce Thrasymachus to angry silence, they are not\r\nabove criticism. Socrates himself expresses dissatisfaction with the\r\nresult of this discussion R. 354c: \u201cAs far as I am\r\nconcerned, the result is that I know nothing, for when I don\u2019t\r\nknow what justice is, I\u2019ll hardly know whether it is a kind of\r\nvirtue or not, or whether a person who has it is happy or\r\nunhappy.\u201d But for once, the speakers\u2019 confession of\r\naporia is not the end of the discussion. At the beginning of\r\nthe next book, two members of the audience, Plato\u2019s brothers\r\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, challenge Socrates: Perhaps Thrasymachus has\r\ndefended his case badly, but if Socrates wants to convince his\r\naudience, he must do better than that. The brothers demand a positive\r\naccount both of what justice is and of what it does to the soul of its\r\npossessor.\n\r\nThe change of character in the subsequent discussion is remarkable.\r\nNot only are the two brothers not subjected to elenchos, they\r\nget ample time to elaborate on their objections (357a\u2013367e).\r\nThough they profess not to be convinced that injustice is better than\r\njustice, they argue that, in the present state of society, injustice\r\npays \u2013 with the gods as well as with humans \u2013 as long as\r\nthe semblance of respectability is preserved. To prove this claim, the\r\nbrothers play devil\u2019s advocate by unfolding a scathing picture\r\nof their society\u2019s attitude towards justice. As the story of the\r\nRing of Gyges and its gift of invisibility proves, everyone who does\r\nnot have a god-like character will eventually succumb to such a\r\nring\u2019s temptations (359c\u2013360d). Instead of the wolf of\r\nThrasymachus\u2019 account, it is the wily fox who is the paragon of\r\ninjustice (365a-d). He will succeed at every level because he knows\r\nhow to play the power-game with cunning. The just man, by contrast,\r\npays no heed to the mere semblance of goodness but rather to its\r\nsubstance and, therefore, must suffer a Christ-like fate because he\r\ndoes not comply with the demands of favoritism and blandishment\r\n(361e). Even the gods, as the poets confirm, are on the side of the\r\nsuccessful scoundrel since they can be propitiated by honors and\r\nsacrifices. Given this state of affairs, a logic-chopping argument\r\nthat justice is better than injustice is quite insufficient\r\n(367b\u2013e: log\u00f4i). Instead, Socrates must show what\r\neffect each of them has on the souls of their possessors. As this\r\ncritique indicates, Plato, at this point, clearly regards refutation as\r\nan insufficient way of making true converts. Whether he ever had such\r\nconfidence in the power of refutation must remain a moot point. But\r\nthe Republic shows that the time had come for a positive\r\naccount of morality and of the good life. If elenchos is used\r\nin Plato\u2019s later dialogues, it is never again used in the\r\nknock-down fashion of the early dialogues. But in his treatment of\r\njustice, Plato does not directly resort to the theory of Forms.\r\nInstead, he develops a political and psychological model as a solution\r\nto the problem of the nature of justice. That there is also a\r\nmetaphysical way to determine the nature of justice is indicated only\r\nbriefly and enigmatically when Plato speaks of a \u2018longer\r\nway\u2019 that would also have been possible for him to take (435d;\r\n504b)\n\r\nA brief sketch of Plato\u2019s inquiry into the nature of justice\r\nmust suffice here to make intelligible his distinction of justice\r\nfrom the other kinds of virtue and of their role in the good life (for\r\na more penetrating analysis, see the entry Plato\u2019s\r\nEthics and Politics by Eric Brown). This question is addressed in\r\na quite circuitous way. Justice is first to be studied in the\r\n\u2018larger text\u2019 of the state rather than in the\r\nhard-to-decipher \u2018small text\u2019 of the individual soul. A\r\nstudy of how a city comes to be will supposedly reveal the origin of\r\njustice and injustice (369a). Its founding principle is \u2013 at\r\nleast at first \u2013 no high-minded concern of humankind, but mutual\r\neconomic need: \u201cA city comes to be because none of us\r\nis self-sufficient (autark\u00eas), but we all need many\r\nthings. \u2026 And because people need many things, and because one\r\nperson calls on a second out of one need (chreia) and on a\r\nthird out of a different need, many people gather in a single place to\r\nlive together as partners and helpers.\u201d The \u2018need\u2019\r\nis, at least at this point, purely economic. The minimal city is based\r\non the need for food, clothing, shelter, and for the requisite tools.\r\nIt is economic efficiency that dictates the adoption of the principle\r\nof the \u2018division of functions\u2019: It is best if everyone\r\nperforms the task s/he is naturally most fit for. This principle\r\ndetermines not only the structure of the minimal, self-subsistent\r\nstate of farmers and craftsmen but also the subsequent division of\r\nthe city\u2019s inhabitants into three classes in the \u2018fevered\r\nstate\u2019 that caters to higher demands, for a more luxurious city\r\nneeds protection by a professional army as well as the leadership of a\r\nclass of philosopher-kings and -queens. Beyond the claim that the\r\ndivision of functions is more economical, Plato gives no justification\r\nfor this fateful decision that determines the social order in the\r\nstate, as well as the nature of the virtues. Human beings are not born\r\nalike but with different abilities that predestine them for different\r\ntasks in a well-ordered state. This leads to Plato\u2019s principle:\r\n\u2018one person \u2013 one job\u2019 (R. 370a\u2013c;\r\n423d).\n\r\nBecause the division of functions paves the way for the definition of\r\njustice as \u2018doing your own thing and not meddling with that of\r\nothers\u2019 in Book IV (432d\u2013433b), it is necessary to briefly\r\nreview the kind of social order Plato has in mind, the psychological\r\nprinciples he assumes, and the political institutions by which that\r\norder is to be secured, for this explains not only the establishment\r\nof a three-class society and the explanation of the corresponding\r\nstructure of the soul but also Plato\u2019s theory of education and\r\nthe metaphysical underpinnings. That economic needs are the basis of\r\nthe political structure does not, of course, mean that they are the\r\nonly human needs Plato recognizes. It indicates, however, that the\r\nemphasis here is on the unity and self-sufficiency of a\r\nwell-structured city, not on the well-being of the individual\r\n(423c\u2013e; 425c). This focus should be kept in mind when assessing\r\nthe \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 and the rigorous cultural\r\nconservatism of the political philosophy of Plato\u2019s middle\r\nyears.\n\r\nThe need for a professionally trained army leads to the discussion of\r\neducation and moral psychology because the preservation of internal\r\npeace and external security presupposes the combination of two quite\r\ndifferent character-traits among the \u2018guardians\u2019\r\n(\u2018the philosophical watchdogs\u2019, 375d\u2013376c):\r\nfriendliness towards their fellow-citizens and fierceness towards\r\ntheir enemies. The injunctions concerning the citizens\u2019\r\neducation are very detailed because it must combine the right kind of\r\n\u2018muses\u2019 (poetry, music, and other fine arts) with the\r\nappropriate physical training in order to develop the right\r\ntemperament and attitude in the soldiers (376d\u2013403d). The\r\norganisation and supervision of education is the special task of the\r\nthird class, that of the rulers of the city (412b\u2013417b). They\r\nare to be selected through tests of both intelligence and character\r\nfrom among the soldiers \u2013 individuals who are unshakable in\r\ntheir conviction that their own well-being is intimately tied to that\r\nof the city. To ensure that members of the military and the ruling\r\nclass retain the proper attitude towards their civic duties, members\r\nof both classes must lead a communal life without private homes,\r\nfamilies, or property. When Socrates\u2019 interlocutors object that\r\nsuch a life is not apt to make these citizens happy, the topic of\r\nhappiness is addressed for the first time, but Socrates quickly\r\nbrushes it aside at this point on the ground that the political order\r\nis designed to make the entire city happy, rather than any one\r\nparticular group (419a-e).\n3.2 Virtues of state and soul\n\r\nThe division of functions that leads to the separation of the three\r\nclasses for the purpose of achieving the social conditions for justice\r\nconcludes the discussion of the social order (427d\u2013434c). The\r\npeculiar manner in which Socrates further develops his explanation of\r\nthe nature of justice can best be understood with reference to the\r\nupshot of this discussion. The catalogue of what in later tradition\r\nhas been dubbed \u2018the four cardinal Platonic virtues\u2019\r\n\u2013 wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice \u2013 is first\r\npresented without comment. Piety, as the text indicates, is\r\nn\u03bft treated as a virtue; religious practices should, rather,\r\nbe left to tradition and to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi on the\r\nground that: \u201cWe have no knowledge of these things\u201d\r\n(427b\u2013c). The definition of justice is to be discovered\r\nby a process of elimination. If there are four virtues in the city,\r\nthen justice must be the one that is left over after the other three\r\nhave been identified. There is no proof offered that there are\r\nexactly four virtues in a state, nor that they are items that can be\r\nlifted up, singly, for inspection, like objects from a basket.\r\nInstead, Socrates points out the role they play in the maintenance of\r\nthe social order. About wisdom (sophia) \u2013 the only purely\r\nintellectual virtue and the exclusive possession of the rulers \u2013 little\r\nmore is said at this point than that it is \u2018good council\u2019\r\n(euboulia) in decisions about the internal and external\r\naffairs of the city. Courage (andreia) is the soldiers\u2019\r\nspecific virtue. Socrates takes some trouble explaining its nature\r\nbecause it is a mixture of belief (doxa) and steadfastness of\r\ncharacter (s\u00f4t\u00earia). It is compared to colorfast\r\nwool: Through thick and thin, the guardians must be dyed-in-the-wool\r\nadherents to the laws\u2019 decrees about what is to be feared and\r\nwhat is to be faced with confidence. Moderation\r\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) is not an intellectual excellence\r\neither, but rather a combination of belief with a certain disposition\r\nto support order. It is a conviction (doxa, 431e) shared by\r\nall classes about who should rule \u2013 a conviction based on a\r\nstate of \u2018order\u2019 (kosmos),\r\n\u2018consonance\u2019 (sumph\u00f4nia), and\r\n\u2018harmony\u2019 (harmonia). The state\u2019s third\r\nclass, then, has no specific virtue of its own. Finally, the\r\nidentification of justice is due to the sudden insight on\r\nSocrates\u2019 part that justice is the principle that has been at\r\nwork all along in the founding of the model state \u2013 namely, that\r\neveryone is to \u201cdo their own thing and not meddle with that of\r\nanother\u201d (433a).\n\r\nThe promise to establish the isomorphic structure of the city and soul\r\nhas not been forgotten. After the definition and assignment of the\r\nfour virtues to the three classes of the city, the investigation turns\r\nto the role and function of the soul\u2019s virtues. The soul is held\r\nto consist of three parts corresponding to the three classes in the\r\ncity. The lengthy argument for the tri-partition of the soul into a\r\nrational (logistikon), a spirited (thumoeides), and\r\nan appetitive (epithum\u00eatikon) part (434d\u2013441c)\r\ncan here be neither reproduced nor subjected to a critical evaluation.\r\nThat Plato lets Socrates express reservations concerning the adequacy\r\nof his own procedure, despite his unusually circumspect way of\r\njustifying the division of the soul\u2019s faculties, indicates that\r\nhe regards it as an important innovation. Indeed, there is no\r\nindication of separate parts of the soul in any of the earlier\r\ndialogues; irrational desires have been attributed there to the\r\ninfluence of the body. In the Republic, by contrast, the soul\r\nitself becomes the source of the appetites and desires. The difference\r\nbetween the rational and the appetitive part is easily justified\r\nbecause the opposition between the decrees of reason and the various\r\nkinds of unreasonable desires is familiar to everyone. The existence\r\nof a third, a \u2018spirited\u2019 or courageous part \u2013\r\ndifferent from both reason and appetite \u2013 is harder to prove.\r\nBut the phenomenon of moral indignation is treated as evidence for a\r\npsychic force that is reducible neither to reason nor to any of the\r\nappetites; it is rather an ally of reason in a well-ordered soul, a\r\nforce opposed to the unruly appetites. This concludes the proof that\r\nthere are three parts in the soul, corresponding to the three classes\r\nin the city \u2013 namely, the rational part representing the wisdom\r\nof the rulers, the spirited part, manifest in the courage of the\r\nsoldiers, and the appetitive part that motivates the rest of the\r\npopulation in its quest for material gain.\n\r\nThe discussion of the division of the soul sets the stage for the\r\nfinal determination of the contrast between justice and injustice\r\n(441c-445e): There will be justice in the city if the members of all\r\nthree classes mind their own business; similarly, in the individual\r\nsoul, there will be justice if each part of the soul fulfills its\r\nown function properly. This presupposes that the soul\u2019s two\r\nupper parts have been given the right kind of training and education\r\nin order to control the appetitive part. The three other virtues are\r\nthen assigned to the respective parts of the soul. Courage is the\r\nexcellence of the spirited part, wisdom belongs to the rational part,\r\nand moderation is the consent of all three parts about who should rule\r\nand who should obey. Justice turns out to be the overall unifying\r\nquality of the soul, for the just person not only refrains from\r\nmeddling with what is not his externally but also harmonizes the\r\nthree parts of the soul internally. While justice is order and\r\nharmony, injustice is its opposite: It is a rebellion of one part of\r\nthe city or soul against the others, and it results in the\r\ninappropriate rule of their inferior parts. Justice and injustice in\r\nthe soul are, then, analogous to health and illness in the body. This\r\ncomparison suffices to bring the investigation to its desired result:\r\nIf justice is health and harmony of the soul, then injustice must be\r\ndisease and disorder. Hence, it is clear that justice is a good state\r\nof the soul that makes its possessor happy, and injustice is its\r\nopposite. As no one in his right mind would prefer to live with a\r\nruined body, similarly no one would prefer to live with a diseased soul. In\r\nprinciple, the discussion of justice has, therefore, reached its\r\npromised goal already at the end of Book IV. Socrates has met\r\nGlaucon\u2019s and Adeimantus\u2019 challenge to prove that justice\r\nis a good, in and by itself, for the soul of its possessor, and\r\nthat it is preferable to injustice.\n\r\nThat the Republic\u2019s discussion does not end here but\r\noccupies six more books is due most of all to several loose ends that\r\nneed to be tied up. Apart from the fact that reason and order are to\r\nreign supreme, little has been said about the citizens\u2019 way of\r\nlife. This gap will be filled, at least in part, by the description of\r\nthe communal life of the upper classes without private property and\r\nfamily in Book V. More importantly, nothing has been said about the\r\nrulers and their particular kind of knowledge. This is a crucial point\r\nbecause, as the definitions of the three \u2018inferior\u2019\r\nvirtues show, their quality is contingent on the rulers\u2019 wisdom.\r\nSocrates addresses this problem with the provocative thesis\r\n(473c\u2013d): \u201cUntil philosophers rule as kings or those who\r\nare now called kings and leaders genuinely and adequately philosophize\r\n... cities will have no rest from evils, nor will the human\r\nrace.\u201d This thesis starts the discussion of the\r\nphilosophers\u2019 knowledge and of their upbringing and education,\r\nwhich will continue through Books VI and VII. Because they also\r\nintroduce the special objects of the philosophers\u2019 knowledge,\r\nthese books provide the metaphysical underpinning of the entire\r\nconception of the good soul and the good state, for the \u2018Form of\r\nthe Good\u2019 turns out to be the ultimate source of all being and\r\nknowledge. A short summary of the upshot of the educational program\r\nmust suffice here. The future philosophers, both women and men, are\r\nselected from the group of guardians whose general cultural training\r\nthey share. If they combine moral firmness with quickness of mind,\r\nthey are subject to a rigorous curriculum of higher learning that will\r\nprepare them for the ascent from the world of the senses to the world\r\nof intelligence and truth, an ascent whose stages are summed up in the\r\nsimiles of the Sun, the Line, and the Cave (508a\u2013518b). To\r\nachieve this ascent, the students have to undergo, first, a\r\npreparatory schooling of ten years\u2019 duration in the\r\n\u2018liberal arts\u2019: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and\r\ntheoretical harmonics (518c\u2013531c). Afterwards, they are admitted\r\nto the training in the master-science of \u2018dialectic\u2019, a\r\nscience that supposedly enables its possessor to deal in a systematic\r\nway with the objects of real knowledge \u2013 the Forms in general\r\n\u2013 and with the Form of the Good in particular \u2013 the\r\nprinciple of the goodness of all else (531c\u2013535a). This study is\r\nto last for another five years. Successful candidates are then sent\r\nback into the Cave as administrators of ordinary political life for 15\r\nyears. At the age of fifty, the rulers are granted leave to pursue\r\nphilosophy, but even that pursuit is interrupted by periods of service\r\nas overseers over the order of the state. This completes, in a\r\nnutshell, the description of the philosopher-kings\u2019 and\r\n-queens\u2019 education and activities (539d\u2013541b).\n\r\nPlato\u2019s design of an autocratic rule by an aristocracy of the\r\nmind has received a lot of flak. But our assessment of his politics\r\nmust here be limited to an assessment of the kind of happiness it supposedly\r\nprovides. Regardless of whether or not we find plausible Plato\u2019s\r\nassumption of an overall principle of the good as the basis of the\r\npolitical order, his model state has, at least in theory, the\r\nadvantage that it guarantees both internal and external peace. That is\r\nno mean feat in a society where interstate and civil wars were a\r\nconstant threat and often enough ended in the destruction of the\r\nentire city. In addition, the division of functions guarantees a high\r\ndegree of efficiency if every citizen does what he/she is naturally\r\nsuited to do. But what about the citizens\u2019 needs beyond those\r\nfor security and material goods? Are they to find their life\u2019s\r\nfulfillment only in the pursuit of their jobs? Plato seems to think\r\nso when he characterizes each class by its specific kind of desire\r\nand its respective good (581c): The philosophers are lovers of wisdom\r\n(philosophoi), the soldiers lovers of honor\r\n(philotimoi), and the workers are lovers of material goods\r\n(philochr\u00eamatoi). That human beings find, or at least\r\ntry to find, satisfaction in the kinds of goods they cherish is a\r\npoint that is further pursued in the depiction of the decay of the\r\ncity and its ruling citizens, from the best (the aristocracy of\r\nthe mind) down to the worst (the tyranny of lust) in\r\nBooks VIII and IX. A discussion of the tenability of this explanation\r\nof political and psychological decadence will not be attempted here.\r\nIt is supposed to show that all inferior forms of government of city\r\nand soul are doomed to fail because of the inherent tensions between\r\nthe goods that the different citizens aim for.\n\r\nSome brief comments on Plato\u2019s conception of happiness are in\r\norder at this point. He clearly goes on the assumption that human\r\nbeings are happy insofar as they achieve the goals they cherish.\r\nThough this notion seems to come close to the \u2018preference\r\nsatisfaction\u2019 for all citizens that is nowadays regarded as the\r\nprimary aim of every liberal state, Plato\u2019s restriction of each\r\nclass to one type of good must seem objectionable, most\r\nobviously in the case of the citizens of the third class who\r\nsupposedly covet nothing but material goods. This\r\n\u2018reductive\u2019 view of their human nature militates not only\r\nagainst present-day intuitions \u2013 it should also militate against\r\nPlato\u2019s own moral psychology, in that all human souls consist of\r\nthree parts \u2013 a rational, a spirited, and an appetitive part\r\n\u2013 whose health and harmony constitute the soul\u2019s and the\r\nstate\u2019s happiness. Why, then, reduce the third class to\r\nanimal-like creatures with low appetites, as suggested by the\r\ncomparison of the people to a strong beast that must be placated\r\n(493a\u2013c)? This comparison is echoed later in the comparison of\r\nthe soul to a multiform beast, where reason just barely controls the\r\nhydra-like heads of the appetites and manages to do so only thanks to\r\nthe aid of a lion-like spirit (588c\u2013590d). Is Plato thereby\r\ngiving vent to anti-democratic sentiments, showing contempt for the\r\nrabble, as has often been claimed? He can at least be cleared of the\r\nsuspicion that the workers are mere serfs of the upper classes\r\nbecause he explicitly grants them the free enjoyment of all the\r\ncustomary goods that he denies to the upper classes (419a):\r\n\u201cOthers own land, build fine big houses, acquire furnishings to\r\ngo along with them, make their own private sacrifices to the gods,\r\nentertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you were talking\r\nabout just now, gold and silver and all the things that are thought to\r\nbelong to people who are blessedly happy.\u201d\r\n\u2018Appetite\u2019 is clearly not confined to food, drink, and\r\nsex. But apart from the granting of material largesse, the members of\r\nthe third class are quite neglected in Plato\u2019s ideal city.\r\nApparently, no education is provided for them, for there is no\r\nsuggestion that they participate in the guardians\u2019 musical and\r\nathletic training, and there is no mention that obedience to the\r\nrulers\u2019 commands is not the only source of happiness for the\r\nthird class. Plato seems to sidestep his own insight that all human\r\nbeings have an immortal soul and have to take care of it as best they\r\ncan, as he not only demands in the Phaedo but is going to\r\nconfirm in a fanciful way in the Myth of Er at the end of\r\nRepublic Book X.\n\r\nThe lifestyle designated for the upper classes also seems open to\r\nobjections. The soldiers\u2019 musical and physical training is\r\nstrictly regimented; they must take satisfaction in obedience to\r\nthe laws for the sake of preserving the city\u2019s inner and outer\r\npeace, and in the deeds of valor in war. Theirs is an austere\r\ncamp-life; not all of them will be selected for higher education. But\r\neven the philosophers\u2019 lives leave a lot to be desired, and not\r\nonly because they have to starve their common human appetites and\r\ndevote many years to administrative duties back in the\r\n\u2018Cave\u2019. Their intellectual pursuits are also not\r\naltogether enviable, as a closer inspection would show. Not only do\r\nthe philosophers have two jobs \u2013 in violation of the rule\r\n\u2018one person \u2013 one function\u2019 \u2013 in that they are\r\nresponsible for both administrative work and philosophical thought.\r\nThey are also not to enjoy open-ended research but are, rather, subject\r\nto a mental training that is explicitly designed to turn their minds\r\naway from the enjoyment of all worldly beauty in order to focus\r\nexclusively on the contemplation of the Forms. This is indicated by\r\nthe injunctions concerning the study of astronomy and harmonics\r\n(529a\u2013531d): The students are not to crane their necks to watch\r\nthe beauty of the \u201cembroidery in the heavens\u201d but rather\r\nto concern themselves with the ideal motions of ideal moving bodies\r\nin a purely geometrical fashion, and they are not to listen to audible\r\nsounds, but to attend to the mathematics of harmonics. The universe is\r\nnot treated as an admirable cosmos \u2013 with the explicit purpose of\r\nproviding moral and intellectual support to the citizens \u2013 in the way\r\nPlato is going to explain in the Philebus, the\r\nTimaeus, and in the Laws. Given these limitations of\r\nthe philosophers\u2019 mental exercises in the Republic, the\r\nclaim that their lives are 729 times more pleasant than the\r\ntyrants\u2019 (IX 587e) seems like a gross exaggeration, even if they\r\nenjoy the pleasures of being filled with pure and unadulterated truths\r\nwhile everyone else enjoys only semblances of the really real\r\n(581e\u2013588a).\n\r\nFor all the advances that the Republic represents in certain\r\nrespects, Plato\u2019s ideal city must seem to us far from ideal. The\r\nsystem resembles a well-oiled machine where everyone has their\r\neconomic niche and function, but its machine-like character must seem\r\nrepellent to us, given that no deviations are permitted from the\r\nprescribed pattern. If innovations are forbidden, no room is left for\r\ncreativity and personal development. Plato seems to presuppose that\r\nthe fulfillment of a person\u2019s function is sufficient to secure\r\nher happiness, or at least that is suggested by the\r\n\u2018functional\u2019 argument that defeats Thrasymachus\r\n(352d\u2013354a). It states that every object, animal, and person has\r\na specific function or work (ergon). If it performs its\r\nfunction well, it does well: For a living thing, \u2018doing\r\nwell\u2019 means \u2018living well\u2019 and living well is\r\ntantamount to \u2018living happily\u2019. Though Socrates\u2019\r\nrefutation of Thrasymachus is found wanting as a proof of\r\njustice\u2019s superiority, the ergon-argument is nowhere\r\nrevoked. On the contrary, it is affirmed by the principle of\r\n\u2018one person \u2013 one job\u2019 that is the very basis of\r\nPlato\u2019s ideal city. But the confinement of everyone\u2019s\r\nactivities to just one kind of work seems rather a narrow one\r\nin the case of the citizens of the third class, given that they are\r\nnot permitted to engage in politics, even if it may be economically\r\nmost efficient. These features suffice to make the ideal life in\r\nPlato\u2019s city unattractive to us, not to speak of certain other\r\nfeatures that have not been explored here, such as the communal life\r\nenvisaged for the upper classes and the assignment of sexual\r\npartnerships by a lottery that is rigged for the purposes of eugenics.\r\nBut the feature that must strike us as strangest about Plato\u2019s\r\ndepiction of his citizens\u2019 lives is that he does not acknowledge\r\nthe one factor that could throw a more favorable light on the\r\nlife of the third class, the life of tailors, carpenters, doctors,\r\narchitects, sailors, i.e., that they will take pride and joy in their\r\nown work and in what they produce, given that they each in their own\r\nway make valuable contributions to the community\u2019s well-being,\r\nwithout which the city could not function. Plato does not seem to\r\nacknowledge this when he addresses them, rather ungraciously, as\r\n\u2018money-lovers\u2019, indicating that he regards material gain\r\nas the only motivating factor in their lives.\n\r\nHave these deficiencies escaped Plato\u2019s notice? Justified as\r\nthis critique must seem, it should be pointed out that Plato is\r\nclearly not concerned with the conditions that would make his city\r\nattractive to all citizens. His aim is rather more limited: He wants\r\nto present a model and work out its essential features.\r\nThe same explanation applies to his depiction of the city\u2019s and\r\nits citizens\u2019 decay in Books VIII and IX. Contrary to certain\r\ncritics\u2019 assumptions, Plato is not there trying to predict and\r\nexplain the course of history. Rather, he wants to explain the\r\ngeneration and decay typical of each political system and the\r\npsychopathology of its leaders. Plato finds the basis of both in the\r\nspecific values \u2013 be they honor, money, freedom, or lust \u2013\r\nthat are embedded in the constitutions of the different types of\r\nstate. It is unlikely that Plato presupposes that there are, in reality,\r\npure representatives of these types, though some historical states may\r\nhave been better representatives of those types than others. But the\r\nquestion remains whether he had a notion of the fact that his\r\nblack-and-white picture of civic life in the model-state disregards\r\nthe claim of individuals to have their own aims and ends and not to\r\nbe treated like automata, with no thoughts and wishes of their own.\r\nThough the Republic contains some suggestions that would\r\nmitigate this bleak picture, for the sake of balancing this picture, it\r\nis more fruitful to look at other works of Plato\u2019s middle period\r\nthat concentrate on and prioritize the conditions of the\r\nindividual soul rather than focus on the demands of the\r\ncommunity. These works are the Symposium and the\r\nPhaedrus, for though each dialogue should be studied as a\r\nunity of its own, it is also necessary to treat the different\r\ndialogues as part of a wider picture.\n3.3 The desire for self-perfection\n\r\nThe Symposium and the Phaedrus are two dialogues\r\nthat focus on the individual soul and pay no attention to communal\r\nlife at all. Instead, they concentrate on self-preservation,\r\nself-improvement, and self-completion. The Symposium is often\r\ntreated as a dialogue that predates the Republic, most of all\r\nbecause it mentions neither the immortality nor the tripartition of\r\nthe soul. But its dramatic staging \u2013 the praise of Eros by a\r\ncompany of symposiasts \u2013 is not germane to the otherworldly and\r\nascetic tendencies of the Gorgias and the Phaedo. In\r\naddition, Plato has good reasons for leaving aside a discussion of the\r\nsoul\u2019s separability from the body in the Symposium (a\r\nfeature it shares with the much later Philebus). He aims to\r\nshow in the Symposium that love is an incentive, not only for all humans but\r\nfor all other living beings as well. Contrary to all previous\r\nspeakers, Socrates denies that Eros is a god because the gods are in\r\na state of perfection. Love, by contrast, is a desire by needy\r\ncreatures (endeeis) for the beautiful and the good\r\n(199c\u2013201c). Socrates thereby corrects the previous\r\nspeakers\u2019 confusion of love itself with the beloved object. This\r\nimportant insight is presented not as Socrates\u2019 own but as the\r\nupshot of a \u2018lecture on the nature of love by the wise priestess\r\nDiotima\u2019 (201d\u2013212b): Eros is a powerful demon, a being\r\nbetween (metaxu) what is mortal and what is immortal, an ever\r\nneedy hunter of the beautiful. Human beings share that demonic\r\ncondition, for they are neither good nor bad but desire the good and\r\nthe beautiful, the possession of which would constitute happiness for\r\nthem. Because all people want happiness, they pursue the good as well\r\nas they can (205a\u2013206b). In each case, they desire the particular\r\nkinds of objects that they hope will fulfill their needs. Such\r\nfulfillment is not a passive possession; it is, rather, the\r\nappropriation of the objects of love that are deemed to be essential\r\nin the struggle for self-preservation, self-completion, and\r\nself-fulfillment (207d): \u201cFor among animals the principle is the\r\nsame as with us, and mortal nature seeks so far as possible to live\r\nforever and be immortal. And this is possible in one way only: by\r\nreproduction, because it leaves behind a new young one in place of the\r\nold.\u201d There is, then, a constant need for self-restoration and\r\nself-improvement by procreation in the quest for an \u2018earthly\r\nimmortality\u2019 manifest in all living things (206e et\r\npass.). This need is explained by Diotima with an impressive\r\ndepiction of the constant flux that all organisms undergo, which, in the\r\ncase of human beings, not only affects their physical constitution but\r\ntheir moral and intellectual condition as well. Without constant\r\nreplenishment, none of them even stays the same over time\r\n(207c-208b).\n\r\nIn the case of human beings, these needs express themselves in\r\ndifferent ways. The search for \u2018self-eternalization\u2019 may\r\nresult in, or even be fulfilled by, the production of biological\r\nchildren or of so-called \u2018children of the mind\u2019 (e.g.,\r\nworks of art), or even by the creation of order in the city that is\r\nthen guided by the virtues of justice and moderation (209a\u2013e).\r\nDiotima\u2019s lecture is finally crowned by a depiction of the\r\nfamous scala amoris \u2013 the explanation of the refinement\r\nand sublimation that a person experiences when recognizing higher and\r\nhigher kinds of beauty (210a\u2013212a). Starting with the love of\r\none beautiful body, the individual gradually learns to appreciate not\r\nonly all physical beauty but also the beauty of the mind, and in the\r\nend, she gets a glimpse of the supreme kind of beauty; namely, the\r\nvision of the Form of the Beautiful itself \u2013 a beauty that is\r\nneither relative, nor changeable, nor a matter of degree.\n\r\nBecause beauty of the higher kind is tied to virtue and is attained\r\nby the comprehension of what is common in laws and public\r\ninstitutions, it is clear that Plato does not have purely aesthetic\r\nvalues in mind but the principles of good order that are ultimately\r\ntied to the Form of the Beautiful/Good. The difference between the\r\nRepublic\u2019s and the Symposium\u2019s accounts\r\nlies in the fact that the scala amoris treats physical beauty\r\nas an incentive to the higher and better, an incentive that, in\r\nprinciple, affects every human being. There is no talk of a painful\r\nliberation from the bonds of the senses or of a turn-around of the\r\nentire soul that is reserved only for the better educated. Brief as\r\nthe Symposium\u2019s explanation of happiness is, it shows\r\nthree things: First, all human beings aim for their own\r\nself-preservation and -perfection. Second, this drive finds its\r\nexpression in the products of their work, in creativity. Third, their\r\nrespective activities are instigated by each person\u2019s own\r\nparticular desire for the beautiful. There is no indication that\r\nindividuals must act as part of a community. Though the communitarian\r\naspect of the good and beautiful comes to the fore in the high praise\r\nof the products of the legendary legislators (209e\u2013210a), the\r\nultimate assent to the Beautiful itself is up to the individual. That\r\nmessage of the Symposium is not unique in Plato\u2019s\r\nworks. The Lysis shares its basic assumption concerning the\r\nintermediary state of human nature between good and bad, and it\r\nregards need (endeia) as the basis of friendship.\r\nDue to the aporetic character of that dialogue, its lesson remains\r\nsomewhat obscure, but it is obvious enough that it shares the\r\nSymposium\u2019s general anthropological\r\npresuppositions.\n\r\nThe idea that eros is the incentive to sublimation and\r\nself-completion is further pursued in the Phaedrus. Although\r\nthe close relationship between the two dialogues is generally\r\nacknowledged, the Phaedrus is commonly regarded as a much\r\nlater work. Not only does it accept the Republic\u2019s\r\npsychological doctrine of a tri-partite soul, it also advocates the\r\nimmortality of the soul \u2013 doctrines that are conspicuously\r\nabsent in the Symposium. But this difference seems due to a\r\ndifference in perspective rather than to a change of mind.\r\nThe discussion in the Symposium is deliberately confined to\r\nthe conditions of self-immortalization in this life, while\r\nthe Phaedrus takes the discussion beyond the\r\nconfines of this life. If it shares the Republic\u2019s\r\ndoctrine of a division of the soul into three parts, it does so for\r\nreasons of its own: The three parts of the soul in the\r\nPhaedrus are not supposed to justify the separation of people\r\ninto three classes. They explain, rather, the different routes taken\r\nby individuals in their search for beauty and their levels of success.\r\nIf the Phaedrus goes beyond the Symposium, it does\r\nso in order to show how the enchantment by beauty can be combined with\r\nan element of Plato\u2019s philosophy that seems quite alien to the\r\nnotions of self-improvement and sublimation through the love of\r\nbeauty. That element is abruptly identified as dialectic, the\r\nsystematic method of collection and division that is characteristic of\r\nPlato\u2019s later work. At first sight, it might seem that the\r\ndialogue\u2019s topic, Eros, is hardly the right tie to keep together\r\nthe dialogue\u2019s two disparate parts \u2013 i.e., the highly\r\npoetical depiction of the enchantment by beauty and the ensuing\r\nheavenly voyage to a hyperouraneous place, and Plato\u2019s\r\nsubsequent, quite pedestrian, methodological explanations of the\r\npresuppositions of rhetoric (249b\u2013c). But although the coherence\r\nof the Phaedrus cannot be argued for in full here, the notion\r\nthat the Phaedrus is disjointed does not do justice to the\r\ndialogue\u2019s careful composition and overall aim.\n\r\nRhetoric, its purpose and value, is, in fact, the dialogue\u2019s topic\r\nright from the start. The misuse of rhetoric is exemplified by the\r\nspeech attributed to the orator Lysias, a somewhat contrived plea to\r\nfavor a non-lover rather than a lover. Socrates\u2019 retort points\r\nup Lysias\u2019 presuppositions: that love is a kind of sickness, an\r\nirrational craving for the pleasures of the body; that a lover tries\r\nto dominate and enslave the beloved physically, materially and\r\nmentally; and, most importantly, that the lover tries to deprive the\r\nbeloved of philosophy. Once restored to his senses, the lover will shun\r\nhis former beloved and break all his promises. This one-sided view of\r\nEros is corrected in Socrates\u2019 second speech: Eros, properly\r\nunderstood, is not a diseased state of mind but a kind of\r\n\u2018divine madness\u2019 (theia mania). To explain the\r\nnature of this madness, Socrates employs the comparison of the\r\ntripartite soul to a charioteer with a pair of winged horses, an\r\nobedient white one and an unruly black one. The crucial difference\r\nbetween the Phaedrus\u2019 tripartition and that in the\r\nRepublic lies in this: Instead of a long and arduous\r\nliberation through education, the Phaedrus envisages a\r\nliberation through the uplifting force of love, a love that is \u2013\r\njust as it is in the Symposium \u2013 instigated by physical\r\nbeauty. That is what first makes the soul grow wings and soar in the\r\npursuit of a corresponding deity, to the point where it will attain\r\ngodlike insights. The best-conditioned souls \u2013 those where the\r\ncharioteer has full control over his horses \u2013 get a glimpse of\r\ntrue being, including the nature of the virtues and of the good\r\n(247c\u2013e). Depending on the quality of each soul, the quality of\r\nthe beauty pursued will also determine the cycle of reincarnations\r\nthat is in store for each soul after death (248c\u2013249c).\n3.4 The quest for method\n\r\nWhat is remarkable in the Phaedrus\u2019 depiction of the\r\nuplifting effect of beauty is not only its exuberant tone and imagery,\r\nwhich goes far beyond the Symposium\u2019s unadorned\r\nscala amoris, but also its intricate interweaving of mythical\r\nand philosophical elements. For, in the midst of his fanciful depiction\r\nof the different fates that are in store for different kinds of souls,\r\nPlato specifies, in quite technical terms, that the capacity \u201cto\r\nunderstand speech in terms of general Forms, proceeding to bring many\r\nperceptions together into a reasoned unity\u201d (249b\u2013c:\r\nsynienai kat\u2019 eidos legomenon, ...eis hen\r\nlogism\u00f4i synairoumenon), is the condition for the\r\nreincarnation of individual souls as human beings. It is this capacity\r\nfor abstract thought that he then calls \u201crecollection of what\r\nthe soul saw when it was travelling with god, when it disregarded the\r\nthings we now call real and lifted up its head to what is truly real\r\ninstead.\u201d The heavenly adventure now seems to amount to no more\r\nthan the employment of the dialectical method that Socrates is going\r\nto describe, without further mythical camouflage, in the\r\ndialogue\u2019s second part. The ability to work out a taxonomy,\r\nestablishing the unity in a given subject-matter and dividing it up\r\naccording to its natural kinds, is the art that characterizes the\r\n\u2018scientific rhetorician\u2019 (265d\u2013266b). Socrates\r\nprofesses the greatest veneration for such a master: \u201cIf I\r\nbelieve that someone is capable of discerning a single thing that is\r\nalso by nature capable of encompassing many, I follow \u2018straight\r\nbehind, in his tracks, as if he were a god\u2019.\u201d So the\r\nheavenly voyage has a quite down-to-earth counterpart in the\r\ndialectical method \u2013 a method that Plato regards as a\r\n\u2018gift of the gods\u2019, as he is going to confirm in the\r\nPhilebus (16c). At the same time, Plato\u2019s esteem for\r\ntaxonomy explains the inner unity of the Phaedrus\u2019\r\nseemingly incongruous two parts as two sides of one coin, and it also\r\nshows why Plato no longer treats the sensory as a mere distraction and\r\ndisturbance of the mind. Instead, the properly conditioned\r\nsouls\u2019 sensory impressions are its first incentives to seek the\r\nhigher and better.\n\r\nWhat concept of happiness is suggested by this \u2018divinely\r\ninspired\u2019 view of human life? Individuals do not, here, find\r\ntheir fulfillment in peaceful interactions in a harmonious community.\r\nInstead, life is spent in the perennial pursuit of the higher and\r\nbetter. But, in that task, the individual is not alone; she shares it\r\nwith kindred spirits. The message of both the Symposium and\r\nthe Phaedrus is, therefore, two-pronged. On the one hand, there\r\nis no permanent attainment of happiness as a stable state of\r\ncompletion in this life. In the ups and downs of life (and of the\r\nafterlife), humans are in constant need of beauty as an incentive to\r\naim for self-perfection. Humans are neither god-like nor wise; at\r\nbest, they are god-lovers and philosophers, demonic hunters for truth\r\nand goodness. To know is not to have, and to have once is not to have\r\nforever. In the Symposium, Diotima states in no uncertain\r\nterms that humans have a perennial need to replenish what they\r\nconstantly lose, both in body and soul, because they are mortal and\r\nchangeable creatures, and the Phaedrus confirms the need for\r\ncontinued efforts because the heavenly voyage is not a one-time\r\naffair. On the other hand, there is also the message conveyed that the\r\npursuit of the good and the beautiful is not a lonely enterprise. As\r\nindicated in the Symposium and further elaborated in the\r\nPhaedrus, love for a beautiful human being is an incentive to\r\nsearch for a higher form of life, a sacred joint journey of two\r\nfriends in communion (255a\u2013256e). The need for, and also the\r\npossibility of, constant self-repletion and -perfection is a motive\r\nthat will reappear in the ethical thought of Plato\u2019s late works,\r\na motif he sometimes presents as the maxim that humans should aim at\r\nthe \u2018likening of oneself to god\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis\r\nthe\u00f4i in Theaetetus 176b; Timaeus\r\n90c).\n\r\nSober philosophers have a tendency to ignore such visionary talk as a\r\nkind of Schw\u00e4rmerei that lacks the substance to be worth\r\nserious thought. That Plato, appearances notwithstanding, is not\r\nindulging in a god-besotted r\u00eaverie in the\r\nPhaedrus is indicated by his interweaving of the mythical\r\ndepiction in the dialogue\u2019s first part with his specification\r\nand exploration of the dialectical method in the later part\r\n(259e-279c), where Socrates attempts to determine the requirements of\r\n\u2018scientific rhetoric\u2019 (259e\u2013279c). Artful speaking,\r\nas well as artful deception, presupposes knowledge of the truth,\r\nespecially where the identity of the phenomena is difficult to grasp,\r\nbecause similarities can be misleading. This applies in particular to\r\nconcepts like the good and the just, as witnessed by the wide\r\ndisagreement about their nature (263a\u2013c). The development of the\r\n\u2018sharp eye\u2019 that is needed to assign each object to the\r\nright class is the aim of Plato\u2019s method of collection and\r\ndivision, a method on which he expounds at some length in the\r\nPhaedrus. He discusses the care that is needed in order to\r\n\u201csee together things that are scattered about everywhere, and to\r\ncollect them into one kind (mia idea)\u201d, as well as\r\n\u201cto cut the unity up again according to its species along its\r\nnatural joints, and to try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher\r\nmight do (265d\u2013e).\u201d That this method is supposed to serve\r\nan overall ethical purpose is confirmed by the fact that rhetoric\r\nbased on truth must reflect the speaker\u2019s knowledge not only of\r\nthe different types of souls and the types of speech that fit them\r\n(271d) but also of the truth about just and good things (272d).\n\r\nThat dialectic is geared to this end is somewhat obscured in the\r\nsubsequent discussion in the Phaedrus. First of all, Plato\r\nturns away from this issue in his long depiction of the iniquities of\r\ncontemporary rhetoricians when he contrasts their efforts with that\r\nof the scientific rhetorician. And Plato continues this excursion with\r\na discussion of speaking and writing, culminating in his famous\r\n\u2018critique of writing\u2019. Second, although Plato makes ample\r\nuse of the method of collection and division in later dialogues such\r\nas the Sophist and the Statesman, he seems to pay\r\nlittle heed there to problems of ethics, with the exception of the\r\nPhilebus. But the aptness of the dialectical method in\r\ndiscerning the nature of the good has already been emphasized in the\r\nRepublic (534b\u2013c): \u201cUnless someone can\r\ndistinguish in an account the Form of the Good from everything else,\r\ncan survive all refutation as if in battle... you will say that he\r\ndoes not know the good itself or any other good.\u201d Brief as these\r\nremarks are, they show that the application of dialectic is of central\r\nimportance to the understanding and pursuit of the good. That the good\r\nis nowhere subjected to such treatment must be due to the enormity of\r\nthe task involved in undertaking a systematic identification of all\r\nthat is good and in working out the criteria of distinction. Although\r\nit is unclear whether Plato in the Republic had already\r\nrefined the dialectical method in the systematic way indicated in the\r\nPhaedrus, the hints contained about a \u2018longer\r\nway\u2019 (435d; 504b) to determine the nature of justice and that of\r\nthe other virtues suggest that the development of a systematic method\r\nof collection and division was at least \u2018in the works\u2019. As\r\na closer look at the much later Philebus will show, the\r\ndetermination of what is good about each kind of thing presupposes\r\nmore than a classification by collection and division: the internal\r\nstructure of each kind of entity has also to be determined. Knowledge\r\nis not confined to the comprehension of the objects\u2019 being,\r\nidentity, difference and other interrelations that exist in a given\r\nfield. It also presupposes the knowledge of what constitutes the\r\nobjects\u2019 internal unity and complexity. It would, of course, be\r\nrather presumptuous to claim that Plato had not seen the need to\r\ninvestigate the ontological \u2018anatomy\u2019, as well as the\r\ntaxonomy, of the Forms from early on. But as the late dialogues show,\r\nit took him quite some effort to develop the requisite conceptual\r\ntools for such analyses.\n\r\nBefore we turn to the late dialogues, a final review is in order of\r\nthe kind of good life that Plato envisages in the dialogues\r\nunder discussion here. In the Symposium, the emphasis is on\r\nthe individual\u2019s creative work, which involves others at least\r\nas catalysts in one\u2019s efforts to attain self-perpetuation and\r\nself-perfection. The quality of life attainable by each person\r\ndiffers depending on the kind of \u2018work\u2019 each individual\r\nis able to produce. This is what the scala amoris is all\r\nabout. In the Phaedrus, the emphasis is on the \u2018joint\r\nventure\u2019 of two kindred souls. True friends will get to the\r\nhighest point of self-fulfillment through the joint insights that they\r\nattain. Just as in the Symposium, the philosophical life is\r\ndeemed the best. But then, this preference is found everywhere in\r\nPlato, and it is not unique to him: All ancient philosophers regard\r\ntheir own occupation as the true fulfillment of human nature \u2013\r\nas they saw it. If there are differences between them, they concern\r\nthe kinds of study and occupation that they deemed appropriate for the\r\nphilosopher. The more individualistic view of happiness espoused in\r\nthe Symposium and in the Phaedrus need, however, not\r\nbe seen as a later stage in Plato\u2019s development than the\r\nRepublic\u2019s communitarian conception. They may present\r\ncomplementary, rather than rival, points of view, and no fixed\r\nchronology need be assumed in order to accommodate both.\n4. The late dialogues: Ethics and Cosmology\n4.1 Harmony and cosmic goodness\n\r\nMost modern readers of Plato tend to ignore the significance of\r\nPlato\u2019s late dialogues for his ethical views, for late dialogues\r\nsuch as the Timaeus appear to concentrate on nature and\r\nmetaphysics \u2014 and, for the most part, drop questions such as the\r\nnature of the virtues and the moral psychology of the soul. This\r\nappears to be a shift in emphasis since nature and natural things are\r\nnot among the objects that concern Plato in his earlier and middle\r\nphilosophical investigations. Thus, in the Republic, he\r\ndismisses the study of the visible heaven from the curriculum of\r\nhigher learning, along with the study of audible music. But, such\r\ngeneralizations about Plato\u2019s intentions may be misleading. What\r\nhe denigrates is not the study of the heavenly order as such or that\r\nof harmonics; it is, rather, the extent to which humans must necessarily\r\nrely on their eyes and ears in those concerns. Students of philosophy\r\nare, rather, encouraged to work out the true intelligible order\r\nunderlying the visible heaven and audible music. Not only that: The\r\nascent out of the Cave does include recognition of objects outside,\r\nespecially \u201cthe things in the sky\u201d (R.\r\n516a\u2013b). If Plato is critical of natural science, it is because\r\nof its empirical approach. This echoes the Phaedo\u2019s\r\ncomplaint that one ruins one\u2019s eyes by looking directly at\r\nthings, most of all at the sun (Phdo. 99d\u2013e), while\r\nignoring the \u2018binding force\u2019 of the good. But what kind of\r\n\u2018binding force\u2019 does Plato attribute to \u2018the\r\nGood\u2019? His reticence about this concept, despite its centrality\r\nin his metaphysics and ethics, is largely responsible for the\r\nobscurity of his concept of happiness and of what it is to lead a good\r\nlife. The philosophers\u2019 knowledge supposedly provides a solid\r\nbasis for the good life of the entire community, as well as for that\r\nof the \u2013 perhaps uncomprehending \u2013 majority, because all\r\nbenefit from the good order of the state. But what is \u2018the\r\nGood\u2019 that is responsible for the goodness of all other things?\r\nA lot of ink has been spilt over the following passage in\r\nRepublic book VI, 509b: \u201cNot only do the objects of\r\nknowledge owe their being known to the Good, but their\r\nbeing (ousia) is also due to it, although the Good\r\nis not being, but beyond it (epekeina) in rank and\r\npower.\u201d The analogy with the sun\u2019s maintenance of all that\r\nis alive suggests that the Good is the intelligent inner principle\r\nthat determines the nature of every object that is capable of\r\ngoodness, in the sense that these objects fulfill their respective\r\nfunctions in the appropriate way. Plato does not attempt to state how\r\nsuch a principle of goodness works in all things in the\r\nRepublic, nor does he indicate whether he has in mind a\r\nunifying principle in a strong sense. That he is indeed thinking of an\r\ninternal \u2018binding force\u2019 for all kinds of things is\r\nindicated, however, in Book X, in his elucidation of the ontological\r\ndifferences that exist, respectively, between the Forms as the\r\nproducts of a divine maker, their earthly copies, and the imitation of\r\nthese copies by an artist (R. 596a ff.). According to Plato,\r\nin each case, it is the use or function that\r\ndetermines what it is to be good (601d): \u201cAren\u2019t the\r\nvirtue or excellence, the beauty and correctness of each manufactured\r\nitem, living creature, and action related to nothing but the use\r\n(chreia) for which each is made or naturally adapted?\u201d\r\nGiven that Plato does not limit this account to tools or instruments\r\nbut explicitly includes living things and human actions, he seems to\r\nhave a specific criterion in mind for what constitutes each\r\nthing\u2019s excellence. But what determines the \u2018use\u2019 of\r\na human being, and to what extent can there be a common principle that\r\naccounts for all good things? In the Republic, this question\r\nis answered only indirectly through the isomorphism of the just state\r\nand the just soul, based on a harmonious internal order. The postulate\r\nof such an orderly structure is not explicitly extended beyond the\r\nstate and the soul. In the later dialogues, by contrast, the Good\r\nclearly operates on a cosmic scale. That such is Plato\u2019s view\r\ncomes to the fore in his excursus on the philosopher\u2019s nature in\r\nthe Theaetetus (173c\u2013177c). Contrary to Socrates\u2019\r\ndenial in the Apology, Socrates in the Theaetetus\r\naffirms that the philosopher is to pursue both \u201cwhat lies below\r\nthe earth and the heights above the heaven\u201d (173e):\r\n\u201ctracking down by every path the entire nature of each whole\r\namong the things that are.\u201d And Socrates also concerns himself\r\nthere with the question of \u201cWhat is man? What actions and\r\npassions properly belong to human nature and distinguish it from all\r\nother beings?\u201d In that connection, he compares the discovery of\r\ntruth with \u2018likening oneself to God\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis\r\nthe\u00f4i) and indicates that there is a unitary principle of\r\ngoodness. The ability to achieve this superhuman state depends on\r\none\u2019s readiness to engage in strenuous philosophical discourse\r\n(177b).\n\r\nIf, in the Republic, the goodness of the individual soul is\r\nexplained in terms of its being a smaller copy of a harmonious\r\nsociety, in the Timaeus, Plato goes for an even larger model.\r\nThe universe and its soul now supply the \u2018large text\u2019 for\r\ndeciphering the nature of the human soul. The structure of the\r\nworld-soul is replicated in the nature of the human soul. That there\r\nis, nevertheless, a close affinity between the Republic and\r\nthe cosmological project that Plato means to pursue in the\r\nTimaeus and its intended sequel is clearly indicated in the\r\npreface to the Timaeus. The tale of the origin of the\r\nuniverse, including human nature, is presented as the first step\r\ntowards fulfilling Socrates\u2019 wish to see his own best city\r\n\u2018in action\u2019 (Ti. 19b\u2013c). From antiquity on,\r\nthis introduction has created the impression that the Timaeus\r\nis the direct continuation of the Republic, an impression\r\nthat explains its juxtaposition in the Corpus Platonicum.\r\nStrong indications speak, however, for a much later date of the\r\nTimaeus. If Plato establishes a link between these two works,\r\nhis intent is to compare as well as to contrast. The continuity\r\nconsists solely in the fact that Socrates reaffirms his adherence to\r\nhis ideal city\u2019s order \u2013 at least in principle\r\n(Ti. 17c\u201319b). It is this order that Critias promises\r\nto illustrate by a narration of the tale of two cities, of the war\r\nbetween pre-historic Athens, a city that exemplifies the ideal order,\r\nand Atlantis, a powerful tyrannical superpower (Ti.\r\n20d\u201326e). However, Plato never completed this project: The\r\nCritias breaks off after some 15 Stephanus-pages, in\r\nmid-sentence, and the third dialogue in the series,\r\nHermocrates, whatever was to have been its content, was never\r\nwritten at all. So, the story of Socrates\u2019 ideal city in\r\naction and of the life of its citizens remains untold. All we\r\nhave is Plato\u2019s cosmic model for such a state and the soul of\r\nits inhabitants (on Plato\u2019s cosmology, see the entry\r\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus by Donald Zeyl and Barbara Sattler in\r\nSEP).\n\r\nA crucial difference between the philosophical approach in the\r\nRepublic and that in the Timaeus lies in the fact\r\nthat, in the latter dialogue, Plato concerns himself with the structure\r\nof the visible heaven as a model for the human soul and also with the\r\nmaterial conditions of human physiology. What is confined to mythology\r\nin Plato\u2019s earlier works is here worked out \u2013 though not\r\nwithout a caveat to the effect that Plato is merely offering\r\na likely story rather than a scientific explanation of the\r\nstructure of the universe, of the human soul, and of human physiology.\r\nPlato\u2019s choice of presenting his explanation of the order of the\r\nuniverse as a story of creation by a so-called demiurge or\r\n\u2018divine workman\u2019 is certainly no accident. It can be\r\nunderstood as a kind of \u2018retractation\u2019 of his deprecatory\r\ndepiction of the divine workman\u2019s heavenly embroidery in\r\nRepublic VII 528e-530d, where such a product is depreciated\r\nbecause of its inferiority to a model conceivable in theory. To be\r\nsure, the Timaeus presupposes the Forms as the divine\r\nworkman\u2019s unchanging models, and he resorts to mathematical\r\nprinciples to explain the cosmic order (27d\u201329d; 30c\u201331b),\r\nbut the focus is almost exclusively on the construction of the visible\r\nheavens. Plato now seems to have convinced himself that in order to\r\nexplain the nature of a living being, it is necessary to show what\r\nfactors constitute such a live organism.\n\r\nThis intention explains certain peculiarities of the Timaeus\r\nthat make the dialogue hard to penetrate, for it falls into three\r\nrather disparate parts. The first part describes the structure of the\r\nworld-soul and its replication in the human soul in a way that\r\ncombines the general principles with those of mathematics and\r\nharmonics and illustrates it with fantastic imagery (29d\u201347e).\r\nThe second part consists of a rather meticulous account of the\r\nelementary corporeal constituents of nature, which are supposedly\r\nformed out of geometrically constructed atoms (47e\u201369a). The\r\nthird part combines elements from the first and second parts in a\r\nlengthy explanation of human physiology and psychology\r\n(69b\u201392c). The first, cosmological, part of the Timaeus\r\ngreatly taxes one\u2019s ability to relate the notion of a divinely\r\ncreated world-soul to the motions of the visible heavens because\r\nPlato offers only the barest hints concerning the intelligible,\r\nmathematical, and harmonic structure that is to explain these motions.\r\nBy contrast, the explanations in the second and third parts are hard to\r\nfollow because of Plato\u2019s quite unique concern with the\r\nstructure and the dynamics of the basic elements of the physical world\r\nin general and with that of human physiology in particular.\n\r\nBut why does Plato burden himself and his readers with such a complex\r\nmachinery, and what does this heavenly instrument have to do with\r\nethics? Since the human soul is formed out of the same ingredients as\r\nthe world soul (albeit of a less pure kind) and displays the same\r\nstructure (41d\u2013e), Plato is clearly not just concerned with the\r\norder of the universe but with that of the human soul as well. He\r\nattributes to it the possession of the kinds of concepts that are\r\nnecessary for the understanding of the nature of all things, both\r\neternal and temporal. The soul\u2019s ingredients are here limited to\r\nthe purely general concepts and to mathematical proportions. There is\r\nno reference to a theory of recollection of the nature of all things.\r\nRather, Plato is concerned to ascertain that the soul has all the\r\ntools for dealing with all objects: (1) the most important concepts\r\nnecessary for the identification and the differentiations in the way\r\nrequired for dialectical procedure; (2) the numbers and proportions\r\nneeded to understand numerical relations and harmonic structures of\r\nall sorts; (3) the capacity of the soul to perform and comprehend\r\nharmoniously coordinated motions. This, it seems, is all the soul\r\nneeds and all it gets so that it can perform its various tasks. The\r\nunusual depiction of the soul\u2019s elements and composition makes\r\nit hard, at first, to penetrate to the rationale of its construction,\r\nand it must remain an open question to what extent Plato expects his\r\nmodel to be taken in a literal rather than in a figurative sense. His\r\noverall message should be clear, however: The soul is a\r\nharmoniously structured entity that can, in principle, function\r\nforever, and it also comprehends the corresponding structures\r\nof other entities and, therefore, has access to all that is good and\r\nharmonious. This last point has consequences for his ethical thought\r\nthat are not developed in the Timaeus itself, but that can be\r\ndetected in some of the other late dialogues.\n4.2 Measure for Measure\n\r\nPlato\u2019s concern with \u2018right measure\u2019 in a sense that\r\nis relevant for ethics is, of course, not confined to his late work.\r\nIt shows up rather early. Already in the Gorgias, Socrates\r\nblames Callicles for the undisciplined state of his soul and\r\nattributes it to his neglect of geometry (508a): \u201cYou\u2019ve\r\nfailed to notice that proportionate equality (geometrik\u00ea\r\nisot\u00eas) has great power among both gods and men.\u201d But\r\nit is unclear whether this expression is to be taken in a more than\r\nmetaphorical sense; it is, at any rate, not repeated anywhere else in\r\nPlato\u2019s earlier work. There is also no indication that Plato\r\ntakes seriously the idea of a \u2018quantification\u2019 of the\r\nnature of the virtues in his middle dialogues. If mathematics looms\r\nlarge, then, it is as a model science on account of its exactness, the\r\nstability of its objects, and their accessibility to reason. A\r\nsystematic exploration of the notion that measure and proportion are\r\nthe fundamental conditions of goodness is confined to the late\r\ndialogues. Apart from the Timaeus\u2019 emphasis on a\r\nprecise cosmic and mental order, there is a crucial passage in the\r\nStatesman (283d\u2013285c), where the Eleatic Stranger\r\ndistinguishes two kinds of \u2018art of measurement\u2019. The first\r\nkind is the ordinary measuring of quantities relative to each other\r\n(\u2018the great and small\u2019). The second kind has a normative\r\ncomponent: It is concerned with the determination of \u2018due\r\nmeasure\u2019 (to metrion). The latter is treated with great\r\nconcern, for the Eleatic Stranger claims that it is the basis of all\r\nexpertise, including statesmanship, the very art that is the subject\r\nof that dialogue (284a\u2013b): \u201cIt is by preserving measure in\r\nthis way that they produce all the good and fine things they do\r\nproduce.\u201d His point is that all good productions and all\r\nprocesses of generation that come to a good end presuppose\r\n\u2018right measure\u2019, while arbitrary quantities (\u2018the\r\nmore and less\u2019) have no such results. The Eleatic Stranger\r\ntherefore suggests a separation of the simple arts of measuring from\r\nthe arts concerned with due measure (284e): \u201cPositing as one\r\npart all those sorts of expertise that measure the numbers, lengths,\r\ndepths, breadths and speeds of things in relation to what is opposed\r\nto them, and as the other, all those that measure in relation to what\r\nis in due measure (to metrion), what is fitting (to\r\nprepon), the right moment (to kairion), what is as it\r\nought to be (to deon) \u2013 everything that is removed from\r\nthe extremes to the middle (meson).\u201d This distinction\r\nfinds no application in the Statesman itself, except that due\r\nmeasure must be presupposed in the final definition of the statesman\r\nas a \u2018kingly weaver\u2019, weaving together the fabric of the\r\nstate by combining the aggressive and the moderate temperaments in the\r\npopulation so as to produce a harmonious citizenry (305e\u2013 311c).\r\nBut no mathematic procedure is specified as the condition of such a\r\n\u2018mixing together of the citizens\u2019 characters\u2019 in due\r\nmeasure.\n\r\nThe importance of \u2018measure\u2019 in a seemingly literal sense\r\nis made explicit; however, in the Philebus, the dialogue that\r\nis concerned with the question of whether pleasure or knowledge is the\r\nstate of mind that constitutes happiness. In that dialogue, number\r\n(arithmos), limit (peras), and measure\r\n(metron) play a crucial role at various points of the\r\ndiscussion, and the Philebus is also the dialogue where Plato\r\nrequires that numerical precision must be observed in the application\r\nof the \u2018divine gift\u2019 of the dialectical procedure of\r\ncollection and division (16c\u201317a). The dialectician must know\r\nprecisely how many species and subspecies a certain genus contains;\r\notherwise, he has no claim to any kind of expertise. Despite this\r\nemphasis on precision and on the need to determine the numerical\r\n\u2018limit\u2019 in every science, Socrates does not provide the\r\nenvisaged kind of collection and division of pleasure and knowledge.\r\nHe avoids that task with the pretense that he suddenly remembers that\r\nneither of the two contenders suffices in itself for the happy life\r\nand that a mixture of the two is preferable. To explain the nature of\r\nthis mixture, Socrates introduces a fourfold division of all beings\r\n(23c\u201327c), a division that uses the categories of\r\n\u2018limit\u2019 and \u2018measure\u2019 in a different way than\r\nthe one suggested earlier for the \u2018divine method of\r\ndialectic\u2019. Limit now concerns the objects\u2019 internal\r\nstructure. As Socrates states, all beings belong in one of four\r\nclasses \u2013 namely (1) limit (peras), (2) the unlimited\r\n(apeiron), (3) the mixture (meixis) of limit and the\r\nunlimited, or (4) the cause (aitia) of such a mixture. As the\r\nsubsequent explications concerning the four classes show, the\r\nunlimited comprises all those things that have no exact measure or\r\ngrade in themselves, such as what is hotter and colder, faster and\r\nslower. Although at first the examples are confined to relative terms,\r\nthe class of the unlimited is then extended to things like hot and\r\ncold, dry and moist, fast and slow, and even heat and frost, i.e., to\r\nall that has no fixed limit or degree. Mixture takes place when such\r\nqualities take on a definite quantity (poson) or due measure\r\n(metrion) that puts a definite limit on their variety. That\r\nonly measured entities qualify as mixtures is not only suggested by\r\nthe examples Socrates refers to (health, strength, beauty, music, and\r\nthe seasons) but by his assertion, later in the dialogue, that a\r\nmixture without due measure or proportion does not deserve its name\r\n(64d\u2013e): \u201cit will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and\r\nmost of all itself. For there would be no blending in such cases at\r\nall but only an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be\r\ncontained in it.\u201d The upshot of this discussion is that all\r\nstable entities represent a harmonious equilibrium of their otherwise\r\nlimitless ingredients. Since indeterminate elements usually turn up in\r\npairs of opposites, the right limit in each case must be the right\r\nproportion necessary for their balance. In the case of health, there\r\nwill be the right balance between the hot and the cold, the dry and\r\nthe moist. The cause of the proper proportion for each mixture turns\r\nout to be reason; it is the only member of the fourth class.\r\nAs Socrates indicates, divine reason is the ultimate source of all\r\nthat is good and harmonious in the universe, while human reason\r\nconstitutes order down here (26e\u201327c; 28a\u201330e).\n\r\nThe adoption of this fourfold ontology allows Socrates to assign\r\npleasure and knowledge to two of the four classes of being: Pleasure\r\nturns out to be unlimited because it admits of the \u2018more and\r\nless\u2019. Reason, by contrast, belongs to the fourth class, to the\r\ncauses of good mixtures. On the basis of this classification, Socrates\r\nprovides the criteria for a critical assessment of the different kinds\r\nof pleasure and knowledge (31b\u201359d) and presents happiness as a\r\nmixture of all kinds of knowledge with true and pure kinds of pleasure\r\n(59d-64b). In a final \u2018ranking of goods\u2019, measure and due\r\nproportion, unsurprisingly, get the first rank among the possessions\r\nof the soul, things in proper proportion come in second, reason is\r\nranked third, the arts and sciences obtain fourth place, whereas the\r\ntrue and pure pleasures get fifth and last place on the scale of goods\r\n(64c\u201367b). If Plato in the Philebus is more favorably\r\ndisposed towards a hedonist stance than in some of his earlier works,\r\nhe is so only to a quite limited degree: He regards pleasure as a\r\nnecessary ingredient in human life because both the physical and the\r\npsychic equilibria that constitute human nature are unstable. In a\r\nsense that recalls the Symposium, Plato presupposes that\r\nthere is always some deficiency or lack that needs\r\nsupplementation. Because the range of such \u2018supplements\u2019\r\nincludes learning and the pursuit of the virtues, there are some\r\npleasures that are rightly cherished. But even they are deemed goods\r\nonly insofar as they are a compensation for human imperfection.\n\r\nGiven the importance of \u2018measure\u2019, there is the question\r\nof how serious Plato is about such a \u2018mathematization\u2019 of\r\nhis principles, quite generally. Though harmony and order have been\r\ntreated as important principles in Plato\u2019s metaphysics and\r\nethics from early on, in his late dialogues, he seems to envisage right\r\nmeasure in a literal sense. This explains his confidence that even\r\nphysical entities can attain a relatively stable state. As he suggests\r\nboth in the Timaeus and in the Philebus, not\r\neverything is in a constant flux. On the contrary, those things that\r\npossess the measures that are right for their type are stable entities\r\nand can be the objects of \u2018firm and true beliefs and\r\nconvictions\u2019 (Ti. 37b\u2013c). This applies not only\r\nto the nature of the visible universe but also to the human body and\r\nmind. Plato seems to have felt encouraged to embrace such theories by\r\nthe advances of astronomy and harmonics in his own lifetime so that\r\nhe postulates \u2018due proportion\u2019 in an arithmetical sense as\r\nthe cause of all harmony and stability.\n\r\nPlato\u2019s confidence seems to have extended not only to the\r\nphysical but also to the moral state of human nature. That assumption\r\nis confirmed not only by the emphasis on right mixture in the\r\nPhilebus but also by the discussion in the Laws\r\nabout how the laws are to achieve peace in the state and harmony in\r\nthe souls of the citizens. Plato no longer treats the emotions as a\r\nmenace to the virtues; rather, he assigns to the legislators the task\r\nof providing for an adequate balance of pleasure and pain by\r\nhabituating the citizens in the right way (632a\u2013643a). This\r\nbalance, through paideia, is crucial for maintaining a truly\r\nliberal soul (I 636e): \u201cPleasure and pain flow like two springs\r\nreleased by nature. If a man draws the right amount from the right\r\nspring at the right time, he lives a happy life.\u201d Suffice it to\r\nnote that the comments concerning the right measure of pleasure and\r\npain form the preface to the entire project. That there is a\r\nconsiderable re-evaluation of the emotions in the Laws,\r\ncompared to that in the Republic, is confirmed by the fact\r\nthat, according to Laws II, education is supposed to provide\r\nthe citizens with the right habituation (\u0115thos)\r\nconcerning the measure of pleasure and pain. The function assigned,\r\nthere, to the right measure of pleasure and pain in the\r\ncitizens\u2019 sentimental education clearly anticipates the\r\nAristotelian conception of the moral virtues as the right mean between\r\nexcess and deficiency (II 653b\u2013c): \u201cVirtue is this general\r\nconcord of reason and emotion. But there is one element you could\r\nisolate in any account you give, and this is the correct formation of\r\nour feelings of pleasure and pain, which makes us hate what we ought\r\nto hate from first to last, and love what we ought to love.\u201d The\r\nconfidence expressed in the Laws in the power of due measure\r\nculminates in the famous maxim that God (rather than Protagoras\u2019\r\nMan) is the measure of all things (IV 716c\u2013d): \u201cIn our\r\nview, it is God who is preeminently the \u2018measure of all\r\nthings\u2019, much more so than any man, as they say. So if you want\r\nto recommend yourself to someone of this character, you must do your\r\nlevel best to make your own character reflect his, and on this\r\nprinciple the moderate man is God\u2019s friend, being like him,\r\nwhereas the immoderate and unjust man is not like him and is his\r\nenemy; and the same reasoning applies to the other vices too.\u201d\r\nBut because Plato, like Aristotle after him, carefully refrains from\r\nany kind of specifications of concrete right measures, we should treat\r\nthe \u2018arithmetic\u2019 of the good life with a pinch of salt.\r\nThat individuals differ in their internal and external conditions is\r\nas clear to Plato as it is to Aristotle. This does not shake\r\nPlato\u2019s faith in the Laws that right habituation\r\nthrough the right kind of education, most of all in the arts, will\r\nprovide the necessary inner equilibrium in the soul of the good\r\ncitizen.\n\r\nAre Plato\u2019s views of human nature and the human good more\r\nsympathetic to democratic standards in his last works? If we look at\r\nthe requirements in the Timaeus concerning the good state of\r\nthe human soul in \u2018orderly circles\u2019, Plato seems to remain\r\nas demanding and elitist as ever. But he no longer puts so much\r\nemphasis on the distance between the best and the ordinary. As he\r\nremarks in the Statesman, statesmen don\u2019t stick out\r\nfrom the rest of humankind in mind and body like the queen-bees do in\r\nthe hive (301d-e). Further, even the best of the souls of human beings\r\nare far inferior to the world-soul, because, in the case of human souls,\r\ntheir \u2018incorporation\u2019 means disorder that subsides only\r\ngradually (Ti. 42e-44c). That this applies to all human\r\nbeings suggests that Plato has become more democratic in the sense\r\nthat he regards the \u2018human herd\u2019 as a more uniform flock\r\nthan he did in his earlier days. He retains the conviction, however,\r\nthat a well-ordered soul is the prerequisite of the good life and that\r\nhuman beings stand in need not only of a careful moral education but\r\nalso of a well-regulated life. Whether a life in Plato\u2019s\r\nnomocracy would better please modern minds than a life ruled by\r\nphilosopher-kings is a question that would require a careful perusal\r\nof that enormous compendium of regulations and laws, which makes the\r\ntask of reading and understanding the Laws very hard work.\r\nBut that compendium is at the same time a valuable sourcebook for all\r\nthose interested in Plato\u2019s late moral thought (for a more\r\ndetailed evaluation of the Laws, see the entry Plato on\r\nUtopia in SEP by Chris Bobonich and Katherine\r\nMeadows).\nGlossary\n\naccount: logos\nappetitive part: \u00e9pithumetikon\nart: techn\u00ea\nbeing: ousia\ncause: aitia\nconsonance: sumphonia\ncourage: andreia\ndifference: heteron\neducation: paideia\nenthusiasm: enthusiasmos\nexcellence: aret\u00ea\nform: eidos, idea\nfunction: ergon\nhabit: ethos\nhappiness: eudaimonia\nharmony: harmonia\nkind: eidos, idea\njustice: dikaiosun\u00ea\nlikening to god: homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4\nlimit: peras\nlook: idea\nlove: er\u00f4s\nmadness, divine: theia mania\nmeasure: metron; metrion\nmixture: meixis\nmodel: paradeigma\nmoderation: s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea\nneed: endeia; chreia\nnumber: arithmos\norder: kosmos\nperplexity: aporia\nquantity: poson\nrational part: logistikon\nreason: nous\nreasoning: logos\nrecollection: anamn\u00easis\nrefutation: elenchos\nsameness: tauton\nself-mastery: egkrateia\nself-sufficiency: autarkeia\nsoul: psuch\u00ea\nsort: eidos, idea\nspirited part: thumoeides\nsteadfastness: s\u00f4t\u00earia\nunlimited: apeiron\nvirtue: aret\u00ea\nweakness of the will: akrasia\nwisdom: sophia\n",
