    "main_text": "Confucian Ethics || Virtue ethics: the dao, the junzi, and ren\n2.1 Virtue ethics: the dao, the junzi, and ren\n\nA common way to understand Confucian ethics is that it is a virtue\nethic. For some scholars this will be an obvious, uncontroversial\ntruth. For others, it is a misconstrual that imposes contentious\nWestern assumptions on Confucianism about what it is to be a person\nand what an ethics should be about. In light of this controversy, it\nis important to specify the sense in which it is relatively\nuncontroversial to claim that virtues constitute a major focus of\nattention in these texts. Virtues in the relevant sense are qualities\nor traits that persons could have and that are appropriate objects of\naspiration to realize. These virtues go into the conception of an\nideal of a kind of person that one aspires to be. Given this rather\nbroad sense of \u201cvirtue,\u201d it is unobjectionable to say that\nConfucian texts discuss ethics primarily in terms of virtues and\ncorresponding ideals of the person.\n\nWhat makes the characterization of Confucianism as a virtue ethic\ncontroversial are more specific, narrower senses of\n\u201cvirtue\u201d employed in Western philosophical theories.\nTiwald (2018) distinguishes between something like the broad sense of\nvirtue and a philosophical usage that confers on qualities or traits\nof character explanatory priority over right action and promoting good\nconsequences. Virtue ethics in this sense is a competitor to rule\ndeontological and consequentialist theories. There simply is not\nenough discussion in the Confucian texts, especially in the classical\nperiod, that is addressed to the kind of questions these Western\ntheories seek to answer.\n\nThere are other narrower senses of \u201cvirtue\u201d that are\nclearly mischaracterizations when applied to Confucian ethics. Virtues\nmight be supposed to be qualities that people have or can have in\nisolation from others with whom they interact or from their\ncommunities, societies, or culture. Such atomistic virtues could make\nup ideals of the person that in turn can be specified or realized in\nsocial isolation. Further, virtues might be supposed to be\nidentifiable through generalizations that hold true in every case,\nsuch that the ways these traits are concretely manifested in conduct\ndo not vary across context or situation. Prominent and influential\ncritics of the \u201cvirtue\u201d characterization of Confucian\nethics--Roger Ames (2011, 2021) and Robert Neville (2016)--seem to be\nsupposing that the term is loaded with such controversial\npresuppositions.\n\nAs will become clear in subsequent discussion here, one can employ\nvirtue language with the appropriate qualifiers and at the same time\nacknowledge much of what the critics claim as insights of Confucian\nethics: e.g., that the process of realizing the virtues\ncharacteristically takes place in relationship to others--those to\nwhom one has responsibilities as a son or daughter or mother or\nfather, for example--and that it can be part of one\u2019s very\nidentity to be a particular person\u2019s son or daughter, mother or\nfather. It is part of the Confucian vision of a life befitting human\nbeings that it is a life of relationships marked by mutual care and\nrespect, that one achieves fullest personhood that way. One achieves\nthis in a manner that is particular to one\u2019s circumstances,\nincluding the particular others with whom one most interacts. None of\nthis is inconsistent with virtue characterizations in the broad sense\n(for an alternative role-ethic characterization of Confucian ethics\nthat incorporates these insights in a different way, see Ames, 2011,\n2021).\n\nThe most frequently discussed ideal is that of the junzi. The\nChinese word originally meant \u201cprince\u2019s son,\u201d but in\nthe Analects it refers to ethical nobility. The\nfirst English translations rendered it as \u201cgentleman,\u201d but\nAmes and Rosemont (1998) have usefully suggested \u201cexemplary\nperson.\u201d Among the traits connected to ethical nobility are\nfiliality, a respect for and dedication to the performance of\ntraditional ritual forms of conduct, and the ability to judge what the\nright thing to do is in the given situation. These traits are virtues\nin the sense that they are necessary for following the dao,\nthe way human beings ought to live their lives. As Yu (2007) points\nout, the dao plays the kind of role in ancient Chinese ethics\nthat is analogous to the role played by eudaimonia or\nflourishing, in ancient Greek ethics. The junzi is the\nethical exemplar with the virtues making it possible to follow the\ndao.\n\nBesides the concepts of dao and junzi, the concept\nof ren is a unifying theme in the Analects. Before\nConfucius\u2019s time, the concept of ren referred to the\naristocracy of bloodlines, meaning something like the strong and\nhandsome appearance of an aristocrat. But in the Analects the\nconcept is of a moral excellence that anyone has the potential to\nachieve. Various translations have been given of ren. Many\ntranslations attempt to convey the idea of complete ethical virtue,\nconnoting a comprehensive state of ethical excellence. In a number of\nplaces in the Analects the ren person is treated as\nequivalent to the junzi, indicating that ren has the\nmeaning of complete or comprehensive moral excellence, lacking no\nparticular virtue but having them all. However, ren in some\nplaces in the Analects is treated as one virtue among others\nsuch as wisdom and courage. In the narrower sense of being one virtue\namong others, it is explained in 12.22 in terms of caring for others.\nIt is in light of these passages that other translators, such as D.C.\nLau, 1970a, use \u2018benevolence\u2019 to translate ren.\nHowever, others have tried to more explicitly convey the sense of\n\u2018ren\u2019 in the comprehensive sense of\nall-encompassing moral virtue through use of the translation\n\u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018Goodness\u2019 (see Waley, 1938, 1989;\nSlingerland, 2003). It is possible that the sense of ren as\nparticular virtue and the sense of comprehensive excellence are\nrelated in that attitudes such as care and respect for others may be a\npervasive aspect of different forms of moral excellence, e.g., such\nattitudes may be expressed in ritual performance, as discussed below,\nor in right or appropriate action according to the context. But this\nsuggestion is speculative, and because the very nature of ren\nremains so elusive, it shall be here referred to simply\nas\u2018ren\u2019.\n\nWhy is the central virtue discussed in such an elusive fashion in the\nAnalects? The answer may lie in the role that pre-theoretical\nexperience plays in Chinese philosophy. Tan (2005) has pointed to the\nnumber and vividness of the persons in the Analects who serve\nas moral exemplars. She suggests that the text invites us to exercise\nour imaginations in envisioning what these people might have been like\nand what we ourselves might become in trying to emulate them. Use of\nthe imagination, she points out, draws our attention to the\nparticularities of virtue and engages our emotions and desires. Amy\nOlberding (2008, 2012) develops the notion of exemplarism into a\nConfucian epistemology, according to which we get much of our\nimportant knowledge by encountering the relevant objects or persons.\nUpon initial contact, we may have little general knowledge of the\nqualities that make them so compelling to us, but we are motivated to\nfurther investigate. Confucius treated as exemplars legendary figures\nfrom the early days of the Zhou dynasty, such as the Duke of Zhou and\nKings Wu and Wen. Confucius served as an exemplar to his students,\nperhaps of the virtue of ren, though he never claimed the\nvirtue for himself. Book Ten of the Analects displays what\nmight appear to be an obsessive concern with the way Confucius greeted\npersons in everyday life, e.g., if he saw they were dressed in\nmourning dress, he would take on a solemn appearance or lean forward\non the stanchion of his carriage. Such concern becomes much more\ncomprehensible if Confucius is being treated as an exemplar of virtue\nfrom which the students are trying to learn. The focus of Book Ten and\nelsewhere in the Analects also suggests that the primary\nlocus of virtue is to be found in how people treat each other in the\nfabric of everyday life and not in the dramatic moral dilemmas so much\ndiscussed in contemporary Western moral philosophy.\n",
