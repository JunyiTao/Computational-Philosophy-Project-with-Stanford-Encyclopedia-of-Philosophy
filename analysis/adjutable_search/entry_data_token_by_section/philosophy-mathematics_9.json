    "main_text": "Platonism || Deflating Platonism\n3.3 Deflating Platonism\n\nBernays observed that when a mathematician is at work she\n\u201cnaively\u201d treats the objects she is dealing with in a\nplatonistic way. Every working mathematician, he says, is a platonist\n(Bernays 1935). But when the mathematician is caught off duty by a\nphilosopher who quizzes her about her ontological commitments, she is\napt to shuffle her feet and withdraw to a vaguely non-platonistic\nposition. This has been taken by some to indicate that there is\nsomething wrong with philosophical questions about the nature of\nmathematical objects and of mathematical knowledge.\n\nCarnap introduced a distinction between questions that are internal to\na framework and questions that are external to a framework (Carnap\n1950). It has been argued that Carnap\u2019s distinction in some\nguise survives the demise of the logical empiricist framework in which\nit was first articulated (Burgess 2004b). Tait has attempted to work\nout in detail how the resulting distinction can be applied to\nmathematics (Tait 2005). This has resulted in what might be regarded\nas a deflationary versions of platonism.\n\nAccording to Tait, questions of existence of mathematical entities can\nonly be sensibly asked and reasonably answered from within (axiomatic)\nmathematical frameworks. If one is working in number theory, for\ninstance, then one can ask whether there are prime numbers that have a\ngiven property. Such questions are then to be decided on purely\nmathematical grounds. Philosophers have a tendency to step outside the\nframework of mathematics and ask \u201cfrom the outside\u201d\nwhether mathematical objects really exist and whether\nmathematical propositions are really true. In this question\nthey are asking for supra-mathematical or metaphysical grounds for\nmathematical truth and existence claims. Tait argues that it is hard\nto see how any sense can be made of such external questions. He\nattempts to deflate them, and bring them back to where they belong: to\nmathematical practice itself. Of course not everyone agrees with Tait\non this point. Linsky and Zalta have developed a systematic way of\nanswering precisely the sort of external questions that Tait\napproaches with disdain (Linsky & Zalta 1995).\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Tait has little use for G\u00f6delian\nappeals to mathematical intuition in the philosophy of mathematics, or\nfor the philosophical thesis that mathematical objects exist\n\u201coutside space and time\u201d. More generally, Tait believes\nthat mathematics is not in need of a philosophical foundation; he\nwants to let mathematics speak for itself. In this sense, his position\nis reminiscent of the (in some sense Wittgensteinian) natural\nontological attitude that is advocated by Arthur Fine in the\nrealism debate in the philosophy of science.\n",
