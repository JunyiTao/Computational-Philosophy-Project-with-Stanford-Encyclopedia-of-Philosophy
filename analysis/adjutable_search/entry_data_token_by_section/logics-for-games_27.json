    "main_text": "Analyzing Play\n4. Analyzing Play\n\nThe term \u2018game theory\u2019 suggests that everything of\ninterest is captured in the format of a game with its moves and\noutcomes. The present entry reassembles this perspective, considering\nadditional structure. A first extension was offered in\n Section 3,\n treating the nature of players as a topic in its own right. This\nsections puts a spotlight on a second topic, game play in a wider\nsense.\n\nMany themes in the literature on logic and games fall into three\nphases connected to play. Certain activities can already be conducted\nbefore the actual game. Examples are assessing the opponent\nor forming a plan. Most relevant choices and decisions, however, take\nplace during the game \u2014 at least unless one thinks of players\nas automata blindly following preset strategies. Lastly, also\nafter a game significant activities occur. These involve\nlearning about opponent types, identifying crucial mistakes made, or\nrationalizing the moves taken. In what follows, examples will be\npresented of each phase.\n",
