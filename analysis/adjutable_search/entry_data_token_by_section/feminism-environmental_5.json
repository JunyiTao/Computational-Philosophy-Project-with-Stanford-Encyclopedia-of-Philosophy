It does so by granting moral status (or, moral standing) to\nnonhuman animals.  \u201cAnimal Ethics\u201d is one such revised\nposition (see the entry on the\n moral status of animals).\nFeminist animal ethicists oppose the same practices (e.g., factory\nfarming, vivisection, and hunting) that are opposed by the two\noriginal non-feminist versions of animal ethics, Peter Singer's\nutilitarian version (1975) and Tom Regan's right-based version\n(1982). Singer opposes these practices because they cause unnecessary\npain and suffering to sentient beings. Regan opposes them because they\nviolate the rights to life of what he calls \u201csubjects of a\nlife\u201d. But feminist animal ethics goes further by providing a\ngendered perspective on such practices and on animal protection\ngenerally (see feminist animal ethics of care discussed in Section 3.8).\n\n\nHow does it do this? There are six ways feminist animal ethics has\nmade distinct contributions to traditional, non-feminist positions in\nanimal ethics: (1) it emphasizes that canonical Western philosophy's\nview of humans as rational agents, who are separate from and superior\nto nature, fails to acknowledge that humans are also animals\u2014even\nif rational animals\u2014and, as such, are a part of nature; (2) it\nmakes visible the interconnections among violence against women,\nviolence against nature, and pornography (see Adams 1990, 2004; Carol\nAdams and Josephine Donovan 1995; Susan Griffin 1981; Pattrice Jones\n2011); (3) it demonstrates the role played by language in creating,\nmaintaining, and perpetuating the interconnected exploitations of\nwomen and animals (See Section 3.3); (4) it shows how bedrock dualisms\nin canonical philosophy\u2014such as culture versus nature and mind\nversus body\u2014have historically not been gender-neutral; they have\nassociated males/men with superior culture and mind, and both\nfemales/women and animals with inferior nature and body (Gruen and\nKari Weil 2011); (5) it locates the exploitation of women and animals\nin mutually reinforcing systems and practices of unjustified\ndomination, particularly sexism and speciesism (or, the prejudicial\ndiscrimination against other beings based on their membership in\n(allegedly) inferior nonhuman species) (Gaard 2011); and (6) it raises the\nissue whether the absence of a gendered perspective in traditional\nanimal ethics makes those positions on the mistreatment of nonhuman\nanimals incomplete or inadequate (see Adams 1994; Adams and Donovan\n1995; Gaard 1993; Gruen 1996; Slicer 1991).\n",
