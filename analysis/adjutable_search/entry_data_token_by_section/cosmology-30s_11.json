In October,\nMilne addressed the Philosophical Association, giving an explicit and\ndetailed analysis not only of his philosophical views, but also of\ntheir history, which, he claimed, extended back to Locke and Hume\n(Milne 1934a) His description of the two opposed\nmethods\u2014inductive empiricism vs.\nhypothetico-deductivism\u2014is quite clear and useful:\n\nStrictly speaking, physics has no philosophy. It has method\u2026Now\nthe methods of theoretical physics seem to be reducible to two\nspecies, the method of starting with concepts and the method of\nstarting with things observed. \u2026When a subject is developed\nfrom concepts the concepts play the part of the terms occurring in the\naxioms of geometry\u2026. The concepts are undefined save as being\ngoverned by propositions of which they are subjects.\n\n\nMilne\u2019s commitment to axiomatization is notable here. It was\nbased in his earlier admiration for the work of Whitehead and Russell\n(Crowther 1970); commitment to axiomatization in cosmology, once\nhaving been initiated by Milne, would be an enduring hallmark of the\nwork of many, including both Robertson and Walker.\n\nThree weeks after this address, Milne spoke on related topics at the\nmonthly meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. His main point was\nthat theories differed only insofar as their concepts could be cashed\nout in observations deduced from them. Eddington took strong exception\nto Milne\u2019s arguments, claiming in response that kinematic\nrelativity and relativistic cosmology differed more importantly in\ntheir ontology than in their consequences. Eddington was especially\nconcerned with differences in the spacetime-geometry each theory\nascribed to the world. For Eddington and his colleagues, the\nequivalence of gravitation and spacetime geometry was a genuine\nreality, a feature of the physical world, just as real as suns and\nmoons and stars.\n",
