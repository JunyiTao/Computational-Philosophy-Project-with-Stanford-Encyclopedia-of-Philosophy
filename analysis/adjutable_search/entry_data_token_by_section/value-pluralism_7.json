    "main_text": "Monist Solutions || Different Bearers of Value\n3.1 Different Bearers of Value\n\nOne way for monists to make sense of complexity in value choice is to\npoint out that there are different bearers of value, and this makes a\nbig difference to the experience of choice. (See Hurka, 1996; Schaber,\n1999; Klocksiem 2011). Here is the challenge to monism in Michael\nStocker\u2019s words (Stocker, 1990, p. 272): \u201c[if monism is\ntrue] there is no ground for rational conflict because the better\noption lacks nothing that would be made good by the lesser.\u201d In\nother words, there are no relevant differences between the better and\nworse options except that the better option is better. Thomas Hurka\nobjects that there can be such differences. For example, in a choice\nbetween giving five units of pleasure to A and ten units to\nB, the best option (more pleasure for B) involves\ngiving no pleasure at all to A. So there is something to\nrationally regret, namely, that A had no pleasure. The\nargument can be expanded to deal with all sorts of choice situation:\nin each situation, a monist can say something sensible about an\nunavoidable loss, a loss that really is a loss. If, of two options one\nwill contribute more basic value, the monist must obviously choose\nthat one. But the lesser of the options may contribute value via\npleasure, while the superior option contributes value via knowledge,\nand so there is a loss in choosing the option with the greater value\ncontribution\u2014a loss in pleasure\u2014 and it is rational for us\nto regret this.\n\nThere is one difficulty with this answer. The loss described by Hurka\nis not a moral loss, and so the regret is not moral regret. In\nHurka\u2019s example, the relevant loss is that A does not\nget any pleasure. The agent doing the choosing may be rational to\nregret this if she cares about A, or even if she just feels\nsorry for A, but there has been no moral loss, as\n\u2018pleasure for A\u2019 as opposed to pleasure itself is\nnot a moral value. According to the view under consideration, pleasure\nitself is what matters morally, and so although A\u2019s\npleasure matters qua pleasure, the moral point of view takes\nB\u2019s pleasure into account in just the same way, and\nthere is nothing to regret, as there is more pleasure than there would\notherwise have been. Stocker and Williams would surely insist that the\npoint of their argument was not just that there is a loss, but that\nthere is a moral loss. The monist cannot accommodate that\npoint, as the monist can only consider the quantity of the value, not\nits distribution, and so we are at an impasse.\n\nHowever, the initial question was whether the monist has succeeded in\nexplaining the phenomenon of \u2018moral regret\u2019, and perhaps\nHurka has done that by positing a conflation of moral and non-moral\nregret in our experience. From our point of view, there is regret, and\nthe monist can explain why that is without appealing to irrationality.\nOn the other hand the monist cannot appeal to anything other than\nquantity of value in appraising the morality of the situation. So\nalthough Hurka is clearly right in so far as he is saying that a\ncorrect moral choice can be regretted for non-moral reasons, he can go\nno further than that.\n",
