    "main_text": "Constructing Plausible Functional Theories || Characterizing Intentional States\n4.2 Characterizing Intentional States\n\nOn the other hand, intentional states such as beliefs, thoughts, and\ndesires (sometimes called \u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d) have\noften been thought to be easier to characterize functionally than\nexperiential states such as pains and color experiences (but not\nalways: see Searle 1992, G. Strawson 1994, Horgan and Tienson 2002,\nKriegel 2003, Pitt 2008, and Mendelovici, 2018) who suggest that\nintentional states have qualitative character as well). We can begin\nby characterizing beliefs as (among other things) states produced in\ncertain ways by sense-perception or inference from other beliefs, and\ndesires as states with certain causal or counterfactual relations to\nthe system\u2019s goals and needs, and specify further how (according\nto the relevant commonsense or empirical theory) beliefs and desires\ntend to interact with one another, and other mental states, to produce\nbehavior.\n\nOnce again, this characterization is crude, and needs more detail.\nMoreover, there are some further questions about characterizing\nintentional states \u2013 particularly belief \u2013 that have\nemerged in recent discussions. Once is whether a subject should be\nregarded as believing that p if there is a mismatch between her\navowals that p and the characteristic behaviors associated with\nbelieving that p in standard circumstances: do avowals outweigh\nbehaviors, or vice versa \u2013 or are there pragmatic factors that\ndetermine what the answer should be in different contexts? (See\nGendler, 2008, and Schwitzgebel, 2010). Another question is whether\nthe states that interact with desires (and other mental states) to\nproduce behavior are best regarded as \u201cfull on\u201d or\n\u201coutright\u201d beliefs, or rather as representations of the\nworld for which individuals have varying degrees of confidence. (See\nStaffel, 2013, 2019, and the many contributions to Huber and\nSchmidt-Petri, 2009, and Ebert and Smith, 2012, for further\ndiscussion. Functionalism, at least arguably, can accommodate a number\nof different answers to these questions, but the project of\ncharacterizing beliefs may not be straightforward.\n\nIndependently of these questions, functionalists need to say more\n(outright or not) about what makes a state a particular belief\n(outright or not) or desire, for example, the belief \u2013 or desire\n\u2013 that it will snow tomorrow. Most functional theories describe\nsuch states as different relations (or \u201cattitudes\u201d) toward\nthe same state of affairs or proposition (and to describe the belief\nthat it will snow tomorrow and the belief that it will rain tomorrow\nas the same attitude toward different propositions). This permits\ndifferences and similarities in the contents of intentional states to\nbe construed as differences and similarities in the propositions to\nwhich these states are related. But what makes a mental state a\nrelation to, or attitude toward, some proposition P? And can these\nrelations be captured solely by appeal to the functional roles of the\nstates in question?\n\nThe development of conceptual role semantics may seem to provide an\nanswer to these questions: what it is for Julian to believe that P is\nfor Julian to be in a state that has causal and counterfactual\nrelations to other beliefs and desires that mirror certain\ninferential, evidential, and practical (action-directed) relations\namong propositions with those formal structures (Field 1980; Loar\n1981; Block 1986). This proposal raises a number of important\nquestions. One is whether states capable of entering into such\ninterrelations can (must?) be construed as being, or including\nelements of, a \u201clanguage of thought\u201d (Fodor 1975; Harman\n1973; Field 1980; Loar 1981). Another is whether idiosyncrasies in the\ninferential or practical proclivities of different individuals make\nfor differences in (or incommensurabilities between) their intentional\nstates. (This question springs from a more general worry about the\nholism of functional specification, which will be discussed\nmore generally in Section 5.1.)\n\nYet another challenge for functionalism are the widespread intuitions\nthat support \u201cexternalism\u201d, the thesis that what mental\nstates represent, or are about, cannot be characterized without appeal\nto certain features of the environments in which those individuals are\nembedded. Thus, if one individual\u2019s environment differs from\nanother\u2019s, they may count as having different intentional\nstates, even though they reason in the same ways, and have exactly the\nsame \u201ctake\u201d on those environments from their own points of\nview.\n\nThe \u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenarios introduced by Putnam (1975) are\noften invoked to support an externalist individuation of beliefs about\nnatural kinds such as water, gold, or tigers. Twin Earth, as Putnam\npresents it, is a (hypothetical) planet on which things look, taste,\nsmell, and feel exactly the way they do on Earth, but which have\ndifferent underlying microscopic structures; for example, the stuff\nthat fills the streams and comes out of the faucets, though it looks\nand tastes like water, has molecular structure XYZ rather than\nH2O. Many theorists find it intuitive to think that we\nthereby mean something different by our term\n\u2018water\u2019 than our Twin Earth counterparts mean by theirs,\nand thus that the beliefs we describe as beliefs about water are\ndifferent from those that our Twin Earth counterparts would describe\nin the same way. Similar conclusions, they contend, can be drawn for\nall cases of belief (and other intentional states) regarding natural\nkinds.\n\nThe same problem, moreover, appears to arise for other sorts of belief\nas well. Tyler Burge (1979) presents cases in which it seems intuitive\nthat a person, Oscar, and his functionally equivalent counterpart have\ndifferent beliefs about various syndromes (such as arthritis) and\nartifacts (such as sofas) because the usage of these terms by their\nlinguistic communities differ. For example, in Oscar\u2019s\ncommunity, the term \u2018arthritis\u2019 is used as we use it,\nwhereas in his counterpart\u2019s community \u2018arthritis\u2019\ndenotes inflammation of the joints and also various maladies of the\nthigh. Burge\u2019s contention is that even if Oscar and his\ncounterpart both complain about the \u2018arthritis\u2019 in their\nthighs and make exactly the same inferences involving\n\u2018arthritis\u2019, they mean different things by their terms and\nmust be regarded as having different beliefs. If these cases are\nconvincing, then there are differences among types of intentional\nstates that can only be captured by characterizations of these states\nthat make reference to the practices of an individual\u2019s\nlinguistic community. These, along with the Twin Earth cases, suggest\nthat if functionalist theories cannot make reference to an\nindividual\u2019s environment, then capturing the representational\ncontent of (at least some) intentional states is beyond the scope of\nfunctionalism. (See Searle, 1980, for related arguments against\n\u201ccomputational\u201d theories of intentional states.)\n\nOn the other hand, the externalist individuation of intentional states\nmay fail to capture some important psychological commonalities between\nourselves and our counterparts that are relevant to the explanation of\nbehavior. If my Twin Earth counterpart and I have both come in from a\nlong hike, declare that we\u2019re thirsty, say \u201cI want some\nwater\u201d and head to the kitchen, it seems that our behavior can\nbe explained by citing a common desire and belief. Some theorists,\ntherefore, have suggested that functional theories should attempt\nmerely to capture what has been called the \u201cnarrow\ncontent\u201d of beliefs and desires \u2013 that is, whichever\nrepresentational features individuals share with their various Twin\nEarth counterparts. There is no consensus, however, about just how\nfunctionalist theories should treat these \u201cnarrow\u201d\nrepresentational features (Block 1986; Loar 1987, Yli-Vakkuti and\nHawthorne, 2018), and some philosophers have expressed skepticism\nabout whether such features should be construed as representations at\nall (Fodor 1994; also see the entry on\n narrow mental content).\n Even if a generally acceptable account of narrow representational\ncontent can be developed, however, if the intuitions inspired by\n\u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenarios remain stable, then one must\nconclude that the full representational content of intentional states\ncannot be captured by \u201cnarrow\u201d functional\ncharacterizations alone (and this will be true as well for certain\nsorts of qualitative states, e.g. color experiences, if they too have\nrepresentational content).\n",
