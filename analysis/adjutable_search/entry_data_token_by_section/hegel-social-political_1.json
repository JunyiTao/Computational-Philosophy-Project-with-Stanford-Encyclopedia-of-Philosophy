    "main_text": "The Place of Hegel\u2019s Social and Political Thought || Conservativism and Progressive Readings\n1.1 Conservativism and Progressive Readings\n\nOne such debate concerned whether or not his views endorsed a\ndangerous conservativism, sometimes described as quietest or\nreactionary. His double-saying (Doppelsatz) in the Preface to\nthe Philosophy of Right that the \u201cthe rational is actual\nand actual is rational\u201d was read by some as saying that the\nabsolutist Prussia that Hegel lived under was somehow rational and so\njustified (Haym 1857). Yet, the more detailed comments found in the\nmain body of the Philosophy of Right consistently favour the\naims of the Prussian Reform era which were opposed by the newly\nascendant reactionaries after 1819 making it difficult to situate this\nwork politically at that time.\n\nThis position was taken even further to some extremes by Karl Popper\n(1966) who claimed that Hegel was \u201cthe father of modern\nhistoricism and totalitarianism.\u201d This view looked selectively at\ndifferent remarks we can find in the PR about how the state is\n\u201cthe march of God in the world\u201d found not in Hegel\u2019s\nown text, but in the published lecture note \u201cAdditions\u201d (or\nZus\u00e4tze) by his students included in most editions of the\nPR today (\u00a7258 Addition). Moreover, it was motivated by a\nphilosophical and political stance that had little, if anything, to do\nwith what is actually found in Hegel\u2019s work. \n\nThis \u201cconservative\u201d reading of Hegel was challenged\nlater by a more \u201cliberal\u201d interpretation that highlighted\nthe reforms and divergences both cultural and political between Prussia\nand the PR that make clear that Hegel did not support an\nauthoritarian government, but a new form of democratic institutions\ncomplete with jury trials that was more progressive (Avineri 1972, Knox\n1970). Hegel held a lifelong admiration for the French Revolution\ntoasting the fall of the Bastille throughout his adult life.\n\nToday, most commentators agree that Popper and others were wrong to\nclaim Hegel endorsed some view of authoritarianism. At the same time,\nHegel\u2019s social and political philosophy is more ideologically\nmoderate than the conservativism versus progressivism debate had often\nadmitted.  While he did advocate for more democratic and progressive\nelements than a reality at his time, Hegel did also defend the\ntraditional family and constitutional monarchy. Perhaps purposefully,\nHegel\u2019s thought is notoriously difficult to categorize given his\ninterest to overcome and transform ordinary distinctions with a\nvirtual consensus today that his work resists tidy classification as\nconservative, progressive or anything else.\n",
