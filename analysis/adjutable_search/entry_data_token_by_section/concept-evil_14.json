    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Relation\n3.5 Evil and Relation\n\nSome theorists argue that the relationship between perpetrators and\nvictims is an important element of evil action. For example, Nel\nNoddings (1989) argues that a primary form of evil consists in\nneglecting relations, while Zachary Goldberg (2019) argues that to\nfully understand evil we must understand the asymmetric power\nrelations that exist between perpetrators and victims. Todd Calder\n(2022) argues that to make sense of the difference between evil action\nand complicity in evil we must incorporate a relational component into\nour theory of evil action. According to Calder\u2019s relational\ncomponent, to perform an evil action we must be close to our victim or\ntheir harm (either socially, physically, or agentially). Calder\ncontends that if the relational component is not satisfied the\nconnection between a perpetrator\u2019s actions and their\nvictim\u2019s harm is too tenuous to support a charge of evil action\nand can, at most, support a charge of complicity in evil (Calder 2022,\n474\u2013475).\n\nOther questions concerning the relationship between perpetrators of\nevil and their victims center on the relationship between evil and\nforgiveness. Some theorists define evil as the unforgivable. Others\nargue that it should be up to victims to decide whether perpetrators\nof evil can be forgiven (Norlock 2019, 283\u2013285). Other interesting\nquestions concerning the relationship between evil and forgiveness\ninclude whether forgiveness requires reconciliation, whether only the\ndirect victims of evil can forgive perpetrators, and whether victims\nof evil can be obligated to forgive, or to not forgive. (See Norlock\n2019; MacLachlin 2009; Thomas 2009).\n",
