    "main_text": "Conceptual Space, Distinctions, and Beyond Organisms || Conceptual Space and Pluralism\n3.3 Conceptual Space and Pluralism\n\nRecognizing the distinction between evolutionary and physiological\nindividuals commits one to a minimal form of pluralism about what\npopulates that conceptual space. But there are also more radical forms\nthat pluralism about biological individuals has taken in the\nliterature.\n Section 3.1\n indicated that the emphasis on the collaborative nature of the\ninteractions between biological individuals in Microbialism motivates\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s promiscuous individualism, a position that\ninvites a very liberal form of pluralism that makes biological\nindividuality seem, at least partly, a function of our epistemic,\npractical, and other proclivities, rather than of just the structure\nof the biological world itself. \n\nHere Dupr\u00e9 can be understood as following the general intuition\nthat if some kind K seems too diverse to characterize, it should be\nsplit into diverse sub-kinds, with each of those characterized. In\nearly philosophical work (J. Wilson 1999, 2000) also drew on this\nintuition, where K = biological individual, moving beyond\nthat broad concept to characterize genetic,\nfunctional, developmental, and evolutionary\nindividuals. Famously, the botanist John Harper invoked pluralism,\nwhere K = plant, by introducing the more particular kinds\nramet and genet to replace talk of individuals. A\nramet is what might be readily identified as an individual plant; a\ngenet is a collection of ramets that propagate, as is often the case,\nthrough the clonal growth of a particular ramet (Harper 1977). How\nmany plants there are, in many cases, depends on whether ramets or\ngenets are meant. For example, while each of the trees in an aspen\ngrove that forms clonally is a ramet, collectively they typically form\na single genet. A pluralist might prefer a description cast in terms\nof ramets and genets over any attempt to answer the question of how\nmany plants or individuals, per se, there are in this case. \n\nPluralism about biological individuals has also been motivated by the\ngeneral idea that particular epistemic practices, rather than\nor additional to high-level biological theory, should drive\none\u2019s ontological commitments (Kovaka 2015, Chen 2016, Love\n2018; for interplay of theory and experimental practice in this\nconnection, see Fagan 2016). Just as practices of the individuation of\nspecies might vary with the differential practices of (say)\nciliatologists and ornithologists, so too might the very individuative\ncriteria for being a (relevant) biological individual differ according\nto the varying epistemic practices across the biological sciences. How\nradical the resulting form of pluralism is will depend in part on how\nfine-grained one\u2019s view of the relevant practices is and the\nexpanse of the range of those practices. For example, are all of the\npractices in developmental biology clustered, or are distinctions to\nbe drawn between those relevant to the experimental investigation of\ngrowth and those relevant to homology? Are biological individuals that\nare posited in community ecology and are constituted by organisms,\nother living things, and non-living things including soils, included,\nas Roberta Millstein (2018) has recently done when discussing the\nland community (see also Eliot 2011)? Whether this results in\nwhat Alan Love calls strong individuality pluralism, the view\nthat \u201cfor a given situation, individuality can be modeled\ncorrectly in more than one way\u201d (2018: 187), turns on answers to\nsuch questions. \n",
