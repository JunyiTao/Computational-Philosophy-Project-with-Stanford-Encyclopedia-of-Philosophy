    "main_text": "Philosophies of Facts || Brute Facts\n1.5 Brute Facts\n\nAccording to a common definition, a brute fact is a fact that is\nunexplained, i.e. a fact of which there is no explanation. (On the\nquestion of how to characterise brute facts and a number of other\nissues discussed below, see Vintiadis and Mekios 2018, a volume\ndedicated to the topic of brute facts.)\n\n\u201cExplain\u201d, like many other verbs of interest to\nphilosophers (\u201cmean\u201d, \u201crefer\u201d\n\u201cname\u201d) can be used personally and impersonally (typically\na three-place vs a binary relation). The contrast is for instance\nbetween\n\nMaria explains quantum gravity/how bicycles work to Sam.\n\n\nand\n\nThe fact that p explains the fact that q.\n\n\nPersonal explanations are not truth-bearers but are correct or\nincorrect and successful or unsuccessful. Impersonal explanations are\ntrue or false but not correct or incorrect, successful or\nunsuccessful. What is the relation between personal and impersonal\nexplanations? Plausibly, one connection between the two is this: if a\npersonal explanation is successful, then the person on the receiving\nend of the explanation must grasp some true impersonal explanation\nthanks to the explanation. Personal explanation is arguably irrelevant\nto the notion of bruteness, and accordingly from now on we will focus\non impersonal explanation.\n\nIt is common to distinguish between epistemic and\nmetaphysical (or ontic, or ontological) explanations (see\ne.g. Barnes 1984 and Salmon 1984). The distinction can be precisely\nformulated in many different ways, but the contrast can be illustrated\nin a simple way by means of an example taken from Bolzano 1837\n(\u00a7162). The following two statements are (let us suppose)\ntrue:\n\nThe thermometer is higher in summer than it is in winter because\nit is warmer in summer than it is in winter.\nIt is warmer in summer than it is in winter because the\nthermometer is higher in summer than it is in winter.\n\n\nWhereas the first one gives a metaphysical (in this case, a causal)\nexplanation of a fact, the second one gives an epistemic explanation\n(in this case, a reason to believe that a state of affairs obtains).\n(We find it very plausible to think that every epistemic explanation\nis a personal explanation, but since this seems to be far from being a\nmajority view, we will not assume it to be correct.)\n\nGiven that there is this distinction between explanations, one can\ncorrespondingly distinguish between two types of brute facts, the\nepistemically brute facts and the metaphysically\nbrute facts. Since epistemic explanations and metaphysical\nexplanations themselves come in various types, one can actually make\nmore fine-grained distinctions. Thus, for instance, if\ndeductive-nomological explanations count as epistemic explanations,\none can introduce the notion of a \u201cdeductive-nomologically brute\nfact\u201d, i.e. of a fact that has no deductive-nomological\nexplanation. And given that grounding explanations (explanations given\nby pointing to a ground) count as metaphysical explanations, one can\nintroduce the notion of a \u201cground-theoretically brute\nfact\u201d, i.e. of a fact that has no grounding explanation.\n\nA further distinction adds to the multiplicity of notions of\nbruteness. This is the distinction between explanations and relations\nthat \u201cback\u201d explanations. The relation of causation, it is\noften claimed, backs causal explanation: what makes it true that a\ngiven fact causally explains another fact is that the former causes\nthe latter or that some event causes another event. Likewise, some\nphilosophers distinguish between the relation of grounding and\ngrounding explanations (see \u00a74 of the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Corresponding to these various relations are various notions of\nbeing brute, which must be distinguished from the notions\nintroduced above: being brute qua uncaused, being brute\nqua ungrounded, etc. These notions deserve to be put under the\nlabel \u201cmetaphysical bruteness\u201d, just like the notions\ndefined in terms of explanation that we did put under this label\nabove.\n\nThus, there are very many notions of bruteness one may want to\ndistinguish. In what follows we will largely (but not completely)\nignore this variety, and we will focus mainly on metaphysical\nbruteness.\n1.5.1 Putative examples\n\nThe fact that there is a world and the fact that throughout its\nhistory the universe will have contained exactly N electrons\nare perhaps good examples of facts that are metaphysically brute, in\nseveral senses of \u201cmetaphysically brute\u201d. The same is\nperhaps true of basic laws of physics (understood as facts).\n\nIn reply to van Inwagen\u2019s (1990) Special Composition Question,\nMarkosian (1998) defends the \u201cbrutality of compositional\nfacts\u201d, the view that whenever there is an object composed of\nsome given objects, then it is an ungrounded fact that there is an\nobject composed of these objects.\n\nDasgupta (2016) holds that essentialist facts, such as the fact that\nSocrates is essentially human, are \u201cnot apt for being\ngrounded\u201d, and hence are brute in the sense of ungrounded.\nGlazier (2017) argues against Dasgupta\u2019s view, but holds that\nessentialist facts are brute in another sense. He advocates the view\nthat metaphysical explanations of a certain kind, essentialist\nexplanations of the type \u201cp because it is essential to\nx that p\u201d, are true when the explanans is\ntrue. On his view, essentialist facts cannot themselves receive such\nessentialist explanations, and hence are metaphysically brute in this\nspecific sense.\n\n\u201cEmergent\u201d facts (see the entry on emergent properties)\nprovide a further interesting illustration. On some views, they are\nbrute in the sense of ungrounded, but they are nevertheless\nnomologically necessitated by what they emerge from, and hence have an\nexplanation (see Baysan 2019).\n\nAre modal facts brute? This question has been at the centre of\nmetaphysical inquiry for a large part of the 20th century\nand is still widely debated. Which notion of bruteness is at stake in\nthe debate is however (very) often unclear. The key question here is\nwhether modal facts have their \u201csource\u201d in other kinds of\nfacts.\u00a0 This can be understood in various ways, some\nmetaphysical, some not. Thus, friends of the view that necessity has\nits source in essence may be understood as endorsing any of the\nfollowing claims:\n\nThe fact that a proposition is necessary is explained by\nsome essentialist facts (Hale 2013: 158).\nThe fact that a proposition is necessary is grounded in\nthe fact that it is true in virtue of the nature of some things (Lowe\n2012: 939).\nThe fact that a proposition is necessary consists in the\nfact that it is true in virtue of the nature of some things (Fine\n1994: 9).\n\n\nOn each view, the fact that a given proposition is necessary is never\nbrute. While on the first view, it may be epistemic bruteness that is\ninvolved, on the other view it is metaphysical bruteness, in two\ndifferent forms. Another example where metaphysical bruteness is\nunderstood in terms of the relation of consisting in is\nGeach\u2019s (1969, pp. 32\u201334) application of Anscombe\u2019s (1958)\naccount of brute facts in his account of basic and non-basic\nactivities, according to which thinking is a basic activity, in the\nsense that \u201cthere is not a more basic activity in which, given\nthe context, the activity of thinking consists\u201d (Geach 1969, p.\n34).\n\n1.5.2 Brute facts and the PSR\n\nThe concept of a brute fact is closely related to the Principle of\nSufficient Reason (see the entry on the\n principle of sufficient reason).\n The PSR comes in various versions. For each sense of\n\u201cbrute\u201d, the claim that there are no brute facts is\n(logically equivalent to) a version of the PSR. Thus if we appeal to\nthe distinction between epistemically brute and metaphysically brute\nfacts, then some of these versions are epistemic (e.g. \u201cEvery\nfact has a deductive-nomological explanation\u201d) and others\nmetaphysical (e.g. \u201cEvery fact is grounded\u201d).\n\nVan Inwagen (1983) and Bennett (1984) once put forward a famous\nargument to the effect that the PSR entails that every truth is\nnecessary. Since some truths are contingent, the argument is in effect\nan objection against the PSR, and hence potentially in favour of brute\nfacts. The force of the argument strongly depends on which version of\nthe PSR is taken to be involved. The argument, in one version or\nanother, has stimulated much philosophical reflection since then (see\ne.g. Hudson 1997 and the reply in Feit 1998, Dasgupta 2016, and\nMcDaniel 2019 and the reply in Werner 2020).\n1.5.3 Brute facts and foundationalism\n\nFollowing current discussions on grounding, let us define\nmetaphysical foundationalism as the view according to which\nevery fact is either ungrounded or grounded in ungrounded facts (see\nDixon 2016 and Rabin & Rabern 2016 for discussions on the view and\nits relations to other views in the vicinity). Metaphysical\nfoundationalism entails that there are ungrounded facts. The converse\nentailment, of course, fails.\n\nLet us say, following common usage, that a fact partially\ngrounds another fact if the former fully grounds, or only helps\nto ground, the latter. Granted that partial grounding is a strict\npartial order (i.e. a transitive and irreflexive relation), the\nnegation of metaphysical foundationalism entails the existence of\ninfinitely descending chains of partial grounds (a series \\(F_1\\),\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_3\\), \u2026 where \\(F_1\\) is partially grounded in\n\\(F_2\\), \\(F_2\\) in \\(F_3\\), \u2026). The converse entailment, of\ncourse, also fails: foundationalism is compatible with the existence\nof such chains.\n\nSwapping grounding for other explanation-backing relations, or for\nrelations of explaining, yields other forms of foundationalism, and\nthe previous considerations apply mutatis mutandis to these\nviews.\n1.5.4 Brute facts and fundamentality\n\n\u201cBrute\u201d is often taken to be interchangeable with\n\u201cfundamental\u201d (see McKenzie 2017 for a representative list\nof references). Is this objectionable? Just like \u201cbrute\u201d,\n\u201cfundamental\u201d can be understood in many ways (see the\nentry on\n fundamentality\n for the various notions currently discussed in metaphysics), and\nwhether \u201cbrute\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d mean the\nsame or otherwise have the same extension depends, trivially, on how\nthese terms are understood. As we saw, \u201cbrute\u201d can be\nunderstood as meaning the same as \u201cungrounded\u201d. In some\ncontexts, many philosophers use \u201cfundamental\u201d as\nsynonymous with \u201cungrounded\u201d in a way that is not at all\nobjectionable (see e.g. Bennett 2011, Rosen 2010 and Schaffer 2009).\nUsing \u201cbrute\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d as\ninterchangeable can thus be perfectly legitimate, albeit in\nuninteresting ways.\n\nThe question of interchangeability becomes interesting when\n\u201cbrute\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d are used with\ndifferent meanings. Thus, for instance, the question of whether a\nfundamental qua ungrounded fact can fail to be brute qua\nlacking a metaphysical explanation is interesting\n(McKenzie\u2019s (2017) aim is to argue for a positive answer to this\nquestion). However, in this case, as presumably in all the other\npossible cases of interest, the use of the labels \u201cbrute\u201d\nand \u201cfundamental\u201d is immaterial because the question can\nbe rephrased using only their respective definientia (the\nprevious question, for instance, can be rephrased as the question\nwhether an ungrounded fact can be metaphysically explained).\n",
