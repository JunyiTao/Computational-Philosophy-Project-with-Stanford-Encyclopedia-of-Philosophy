    "main_text": "The Logic of Begriffsschrift\n2. The Logic of Begriffsschrift\n\nThe logic of Begriffsschrift was formulated before Frege\nwrote \u201cFunction and Concept\u201d (1891), \u201cSense and\nReference\u201d (1892a), and \u201cConcept and Object\u201d\n(1892b). Each of these papers was aimed at solving a particular\nproblem in Frege\u2019s original logic as laid out in\nBegriffsschrift: \u201cFunction and Concept\u201d clarifies\nthe status of concepts and relations as a species of mathematical\nfunction (and contains the first appearance of a number of other\nchanges to the logic, including the first published mention of\nFrege\u2019s sense/reference distinction), \u201cSense and\nReference\u201d provides Frege with the tools to provide an adequate\ntreatment of identity, and \u201cConcept and Object\u201d addresses\npuzzles raised by the type distinctions at work in Frege\u2019s\nhigher-order logic first clearly introduced in \u201cFunction and\nConcept\u201d (although the sharp concept/object distinction is also\nimplicitly assumed, and does much work, in Grundlagen\n[1884]). Each of these works led to significant alterations to both\nthe formal details and the philosophical interpretation of\nFrege\u2019s logic between Begriffsschrift and\nGrundgesetze, and we will examine a number of such\ndifferences below. For the purposes of understanding the basic\nmechanics of the logic of Begriffsschrift on its own,\nhowever, the most critical of these three essays is \u201cSense and\nReference\u201d.\n\nAt the time of writing Begriffsschrift, Frege did not have a\nclear distinction between sense and reference. As a result, he instead\nmobilizes the notion of conceptual content which, in a sense,\ndoes the work that would be distributed between sense and reference in\nhis later, post \u201cSense and Reference\u201d writings.\n\nIn his argument against the traditional subject-predicate analysis of\njudgements (which we return to below), Frege explicitly states that\nthe logic of Begriffsschrift is insensitive to differences\nbetween judgements that express the same conceptual content:\n\n\nI note that the contents of two judgements can differ in two ways:\neither the conclusions that can be drawn from one when combined with\ncertain others also always follow from the second when combined with\nthe same judgements, or else this is not the case. The two\npropositions \u201cAt Plataea the Greeks defeated the Persians\u201d\nand \u201cAt Plataea the Persians were defeated by the Greeks\u201d,\ndiffer in the first way. Even if a slight difference in sense can be\ndiscerned, the agreement still predominates. Now I call that part of\nthe content that is the same in both cases the conceptual\ncontent. Since only this has significance for the\nBegriffsschrift, no distinction is needed between\npropositions that have the same conceptual content. (Frege 1879a:\n\u00a73)\n\n\nAs a result, and, interestingly, somewhat more like contemporary logic\nthan the later approach taken in Grundgesetze, the logical\noperators of Begriffsschrift are operations that (in some\nsense) map arguments of the appropriate sort to judgeable\ncontents, which can be glossed as something like possible\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d (see Dummett 1981\nand Currie 1984 for more discussion). Thus, in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift negation is an operation that takes a\njudgeable content (again, something like a possible fact or\ncircumstance) as input and gives another judgeable content as its\nvalue, and Frege\u2019s version of the universal quantifier is an\noperator that takes a predicative conceptual content as argument and\ngives a judgeable content as its value.\n\nFamiliar worries regarding \u201cnegative\u201d and\n\u201cgeneral\u201d facts (or, more carefully,\n\u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cuniversal\u201d conceptual\ncontents) no doubt plague the logic of Begriffsschrift as a\nresult (Beaney 1997), but Frege does not address such problems, which\nat any rate disappear in the post-sense/reference-distinction logic of\nGrundgesetze. The important point for our purposes is that\nthe use of this early notion of conceptual content, rather than the\nmore nuanced sense/reference distinction, means that the range of\napplicability of the operators found in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift is rather narrower than the range of\napplicability of the (typographically identical) operators found in\nthe logic of Grundgesetze.\n\nIn Section 3 of Begriffsschrift, Frege introduces an\nimportant departure from the work of his contemporaries (such as Boole\nand Schr\u00f6der), and from the logical tradition more generally: the\nrejection of the subject-predicate analysis of propositions:\n\n\nA distinction between subject and predicate finds\nno place in my representation of a judgement. (1879a:\n\u00a73)\n\n\nHe follows up this jettisoning of subject-predicate analyses with an\nalternative, and more flexible, proposal later in\nBegriffsschrift:\n\n\nLet us suppose that the circumstance that hydrogen is lighter than\ncarbon dioxide is expressed in our formula language. Then in place of\nthe symbol for hydrogen we can insert the symbol for oxygen or that\nfor nitrogen. This changes the sense in such a way that\n\u201coxygen\u201d or \u201cnitrogen\u201d enters into the\nrelation in which \u201chydrogen\u201d stood before. If an\nexpression is thought of as variable in this way, it splits up into a\nconstant component, which represents the totality of relations, and a\nsymbol which can be though of as replaceable by others and which\ndenotes the object that stands in these relations. The former I call\nthe function, the latter its argument. The distinction has nothing to\ndo with the conceptual content, but only with our way of grasping it.\nAlthough as viewed in the way just indicated, \u201chydrogen\u201d\nwas the argument and \u201cbeing lighter than carbon dioxide\u201d\nthe function, we can also grasp the same conceptual content in such a\nway that \u201ccarbon dioxide\u201d becomes the argument and\n\u201cbeing heavier than hydrogen\u201d the function. (1879a:\n\u00a79)\n\n\nHe goes on later in the same section to specify that:\n\n\nIf, in an expression (whose content need not be a judgeable\ncontent), a simple or complex symbol occurs in one or more places, and\nwe think of it as replaceable at all or some of its occurrences by\nanother symbol (but everywhere by the same symbol), then we call the\npart of the expression that on this occasion appears invariant the\nfunction, and the replaceable part its argument. (1879a:\n\u00a79)\n\n\nThis marks an important innovation in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift: Frege has replaced the analysis of a\nproposition into its unique subject and predicate (a method embedded\nin most work on logic since Aristotle) with the more flexible idea\nthat a proposition can be analyzed into an argument and a\nfunction applied to that argument in more than one way.\n\nA warning is in order: Frege\u2019s distinction in\nBegriffsschrift between function and argument should not be\nconfused with the type theory of objects, first-level functions\n(applying to objects), second-level functions (applying to first-level\nfunctions), and third-level functions (applying to second-level\nfunctions) that is developed in detail in Grundgesetze.\nFrege, at the time of writing Begriffsschrift, does not yet\nhave these type distinctions in place, and admits as much in the\nintroduction to Grundgesetze:\n\n\nMoreover, the nature of functions, in contrast to objects, is\ncharacterized more precisely than in my Begriffsschrift.\nFurther, from this the distinction between function of first and\nsecond level results. (1893/1903: x)\n\n\nThus, what appear within Begriffsschrift to be\nsomething akin to first-order variables (i.e., German \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\mathfrak{e}\\)\u201d,\netc., and Roman\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(y\\)\u201d,\netc.) are instead better\nunderstood as variables ranging over arguments of any level (which\nwould include what the later Frege would consider first- and\nsecond-level functions), and what appear to be second-order variables\n(i.e., German \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{f}\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\mathfrak{g}\\)\u201d,\netc., and Roman\n\u201c\\(f\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d)\nare instead better understood\nas variables ranging over functions that are appropriate to those\narguments.\n\nWhile correct, even this is somewhat misleading, since anything that\ncan be taken to be the argument of a judgement can also be taken to be\nthe function of that same judgement, and vice versa. In introducing\nthe concavity generalization device of the logic of\nBegriffsschrift (about which more below) Frege writes:\n\n\nSince the symbol \\(\\Phi\\) occurs in the expression \\(\\Phi(A)\\) and can\nbe thought of as replaced by other symbols \\(\\Psi\\), \\(X\\), by means\nof which other functions of the argument \\(A\\) are then expressed,\n\\(\\Phi(A)\\) can be regarded as a function of the argument\n\\(\\Phi\\). (Frege 1879a: \u00a710)\n\n\nIn other words, we can parse the sentence \u201cHydrogen is lighter\nthan carbon dioxide\u201d in such a way that \u201cHydrogen\u201d\nis the argument and \u201cis lighter than carbon dioxide\u201d is\nthe function, but we can also parse the same sentence such that\n\u201cis lighter than carbon dioxide\u201d is the argument and\n\u201cHydrogen\u201d (and not, as it would be in\nGrundgesetze, the second-level concept that we might\nparaphrase as \u201cis satisfied by hydrogen\u201d) is the\nfunction\u2014see Heck and May (2013) for more discussion. Further,\nFrege notes that the function/argument distinction is not a reflection\nof any objective facts regarding the structure of reality (unlike the\nlater object/function hierarchy found in Grundgesetze) but\ninstead merely reflects a choice to analyze a statement in one way\nrather than another:\n\n\nFor us the different ways in which the same conceptual content can be\ntaken as a function of this or that argument has no importance so long\nas function and argument are fully determined. (1879a: \u00a79)\n\n\nThus, anything can be an argument or a function, and the apparently\nfirst- and second-order variables of Begriffsschrift are\nnothing of the sort. Instead, the difference between what appear to be\nfirst-order variables (i.e., \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\mathfrak{e}\\)\u201d,\netc., and Roman\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(y\\)\u201d,\netc.) and what appear to be\nsecond-order variables (i.e., German \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{f}\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\mathfrak{g}\\)\u201d,\netc., and Roman\n\u201c\\(f\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d)\nis merely heuristic, serving\nto assist the reader in understanding the upshot of formulas with\nmultiple quantifiers.
