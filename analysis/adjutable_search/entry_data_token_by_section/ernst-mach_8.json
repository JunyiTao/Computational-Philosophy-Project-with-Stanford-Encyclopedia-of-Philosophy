What began as simple\nadaptations that allowed instinctive responses to immediate conditions,\ngradually evolved into ever more complex capacities for\nresponse. Gradually life acquired memory and thus an\nawareness of a wider field of spatial-temporal relations than is\npresent immediately to the senses. Memory then grew beyond\nindividual memory and became communicated culturally. Science is\na direct outgrowth of this deep natural process:\n\n\nLower animals living under simple, constant and favorable conditions\nadapt themselves to immediate circumstances through their innate\nreflexes.  This usually suffices to maintain individuals and species\nfor a suitable period.  An animal can withstand more intricate and\nless stable conditions only if it can adapt to a wider range of\nspatial and temporal surroundings.  This requires a farsightedness in\nspace and time which is met first by more perfect sense organs, and\nwith mounting demands by a development in the life of the imagination.\nIndeed an organism that possesses memory has wider spatial and\ntemporal surroundings in its mental field of vision than it could\nreach through its senses.  It perceives, as it were, even those\nregions that adjoin the directly visible, seeing the approach of prey\nor foe before any sense organ announces them.  What guarantees to\nprimitive man a measure of advantage over his animal fellows is\ndoubtless only the strength of his individual memory, which is\ngradually reinforced by the communicated memory of forebears and\ntribe.  Likewise, what essentially marks progress in civilization is\nthat noticeably wider regions of space and time are drawn within the\nscope of human attention.  With the partial relief that a rising\ncivilization affords, to begin with through division of labor,\ndevelopment of trades and so on, the individual\u2019s life is focused on a\nsmaller range of facts and gains in strength, while that of society as\na whole does not lose in scope.  Gradually the activity of thinking\nthus invigorated may itself become a calling.  Scientific thought\narises out of popular thought, and so completes the continuous series\nof biological development that begins with the first simple\nmanifestations of life.\u2026. Indeed, the formation of scientific\nhypotheses is merely a further degree of development of instinctive\nand primitive thought, and all the transitions between them can be\ndemonstrated. [KE: 171]\n\n\nIn an article to which Mach often refers, he writes: \u201cHere I\nwish simply to consider the growth of natural knowledge in the\nlight of the theory of evolution. For knowledge, too, is a\nproduct of organic nature. And although ideas, as such, do\nnot comport themselves in all respects like independent organic\nindividuals, and although violent comparisons should be avoided, still\nif Darwin reasoned rightly, the general imprint of evolution and\ntransformation must be noticeable in ideas also.\u201d [PL:\n218] And later, \u201cWe are prepared, thus, to regard ourselves and\nevery one of our ideas as a product and a subject of universal\nevolution; and in this way we shall advance sturdily and unimpeded\nalong the paths which the future will throw open to us.\u201d\n[PL: 233]\n",
