Much of the earlier pluralist literature (e.g., Suppes 1978;\nFodor 1974; Kitcher 1984b) argued for the irreducible plurality of\ntheories, methods, or concepts without relating to the social\norganization of science. While post-positivist philosophies of the\nrelation between science and society emerged in different academic\ncommunities (Canguilhem 1977 [1990]; Feyerabend 1978; Freire 1968\n[1970]; Habermas 1968 [1972]; Janich, Kambartel, & Mittelstrass\n1974; Klimovsky 1975), they remained largely outside of the mainstream\nof North American philosophy of science. Feminist philosophers of the\n1980s (Harding 1988; Haraway 1988; Longino 1987) challenged this\nmainstream by exploring how diverse theories, methods, or concepts\nrelate to diverse social positions and values of scientists.\nStandpoint theory (Harding 1992; Wylie 2012) and feminist empiricism\n(Longino 2002a; Anderson 2004) emerged as two major theoretical\nstrands with lasting influence on scientific pluralism.\n\nFeminist standpoint theory can be described as combining a thesis of\nsituated knowledge and a thesis of epistemic advantage (Wylie 2003;\nIntemann 2010). First, knowledge is assumed to be situated in the\nsense that it is shaped by social positioning of actors and their\nexperiences (Haraway 1988). Second, the social positioning of\nmarginalized groups creates epistemic advantages as it can contribute\nto challenging biases in science (Harding 1992). While the second\ncondition has sometimes been interpreted (and strategically\nmisinterpreted) as making obscure claims about epistemic superiority\nof women, standpoint theory does not attribute automatic epistemic\nprivilege to specific social groups (Wylie 2003). For example, women\ndo not always know more or better but are often able to bring\nattention to neglected facts (e.g., about sexual health or labor\nconditions), to methodological biases (e.g., in survey samples or\ninterview guides) or to fruitful research questions (e.g., about\nneglected social causes of human behavior or of health disparities)\nthat have been marginalized by dominant actors in scientific\npractices.\n\nFeminist standpoint theory has been of lasting influence on pluralist\nframeworks in philosophy of science by contributing to a wide range of\nresearch programs that explore the knowledge of marginalized\nstakeholders and challenge dominant scientific perspectives as being\ngrounded in the standpoints of dominant actors in scientific practice.\nFor example, Wylie\u2019s (2015) work connects standpoint theory with\ndebates about indigenous knowledge in archaeological research. As also\nincreasingly recognized in philosophy of science more broadly (Kendig\n2020; Ludwig 2017; Weiskopf 2020; Whyte 2013), indigenous people are\nexperts about local environmental and social systems while indigenous\nknowledge remains widely marginalized both in research and policy. By\nemphasizing the situated knowledge of indigenous people, philosophers\nof science have therefore more recently articulated accounts of\nepistemic injustice in science (Koskinen & Rolin 2019) and\nexplored the challenges of approaching epistemic plurality from a\nglobal perspective (Ludwig et al. [eds.] 2021; Zambrana & Machaca\nBenito 2014). Harding\u2019s work (2015) has connected standpoint\ntheory to debates about post- and decolonial perspectives on science\nthat emphasize that situated knowledge in the Global South remains\nlargely marginalized in the mainstream of academic knowledge\nproduction (Mavhunga 2017; Mignolo 2010; Santos & Meneses [eds.]\n2009).\n\nFeminist empiricism constitutes another major influence on scientific\npluralism (Anderson 2004; Longino 2002a; Kourany 2010; Solomon 2006b)\nthat has developed in productive tension with standpoint theory\n(Intemann 2010). Rather than focusing on the knowledge of specific\nsocial groups such as women or indigenous communities, feminist\nempiricism departs from methodological considerations about the role\nof social values in scientific practice. Commonly contrasted with the\nideal of value-free science (Elliott 2017), feminist empiricists have\nargued that social values cannot be eliminated from scientific\npractice including theory choice. For example, Longino (1990)\ninfluentially argued that the underdetermination of theories through\nempirical evidence requires social and other contextual values in\ntheory choice.\n\nWhile feminist empiricism makes the case for the legitimacy of\nfeminist values in science, it has also shaped scientific pluralism\nmore broadly by fostering a debate about the methodological dimensions\nof value plurality and dissent in science. Longino (1993), for\nexample, aims to replace the ideal of value-free science with a\ndifferent set of procedural criteria according to which science should\nprovide (1) forums for criticism that allow the formulation of\nscientific dissent, (2) uptake of criticism in the sense that dissent\nis actively discussed in scientific discourse, (3) standards that are\npublicly recognized and allow for the evaluation of dissenting\npositions, (4) equality in the sense that different epistemic\ncommunities are recognized as having equal authority.\n\nLongino\u2019s criteria illustrate the contributions of feminist\nempiricism to scientific pluralism beyond explicit concerns with\ngender by aiming to articulate a general framework for epistemic and\nvalue diversity as conditions of successful science. In fact, one of\nthe common criticisms of Longino\u2019s framework has been that it is\nnot feminist at all but rather opens the door for arguments in favor\nof the inclusion of anti-feminist or otherwise anti-egalitarian voices\nin research (Crasnow 2013; Hicks 2011; Kourany 2010). As such,\nfeminist empiricism has contributed to the development of a social\nepistemology of scientific knowledge production that addresses the\ncomplexity of epistemic and value plurality in practice (Grasswick\n& Webb 2002; Solomon 2006a; Biddle 2007). For example, climate\nscience has become a focus of debates both in relation to the role of\nvalues in theory choice and the role of dissenting opinions in\nscientific practice (de Melo-Mart\u00edn & Intemann 2018; Keller\n2017; Lewandowsky, Cook, & Lloyd 2018). Simple narratives about\nthe epistemic benefits of plurality may fail to account for\nepistemically detrimental forms of dissent as exemplified by climate\nskepticism (Biddle & Leuschner 2015). For scientific pluralists,\nhard cases such as climate skepticism indicate the need to carefully\narticulate what types of dissent, disagreement, and diversity are\ndesirable in scientific practice (Dells\u00e9n & Baghramian\nforthcoming; Hauswald 2017; Intemann 2011; Leuschner 2018; Rolin\n2017).\n",
