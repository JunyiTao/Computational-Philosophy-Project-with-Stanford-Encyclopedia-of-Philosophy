    "main_text": "The Divergent Views\n8. The Divergent Views\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is not a homogenous view. This insight\nhas begun to emerge among historians and philosophers of science over\nthe last ten to fifteen years. Both James Cushing (1994) and Mara\nBeller (1999) take for granted the existence of a unitary Copenhagen\ninterpretation in their social and institutional explanation of the\nonce total dominance of the Copenhagen orthodoxy; a view they\npersonally find unconvincing and outdated partly because they read\nBohr\u2019s view on quantum mechanics through Heisenberg\u2019s\nexposition. But historians and philosophers of science have gradually\nrealized that Bohr\u2019s and Heisenberg\u2019s pictures of\ncomplementarity on the surface may appear similar but beneath the\nsurface diverge significantly. Don Howard (2004, p. 680) goes as far\nas concluding that \u201cuntil Heisenberg coined the term in 1955,\nthere was no unitary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum\nmechanics.\u201d The term apparently occurs for the first time in\nHeisenberg (1955). In addition, Howard also argues that it was\nHeisenberg\u2019s exposition of complementarity, and not\nBohr\u2019s, with its emphasis on a privileged role for the observer\nand observer-induced wave packet collapse that became identical with\nthat interpretation. Says he: \u201cWhatever Heisenberg\u2019s\nmotivation, his invention of a unitary Copenhagen view on\ninterpretation, at the center of which was his own, distinctively\nsubjectivist view of the role of the observer, quickly found an\naudience\u201d (p. 677). This audience included people like David\nBohm, Paul Feyerabend, Norwood Russell Hanson, and Karl Popper who\nused Heisenberg\u2019s presentation of complementarity as the target\nfor their criticism of the orthodox view. However, it should also be\nmentioned that in later work, Feyerabend (1968, 1969) was one of the\nfirst philosophers who gave a painstaking analysis of complementarity\nin order to clear up the myth of it being unintelligible. Feyerabend\nurged philosophers and physicists to go back to Bohr and read him\ncarefully.\n\nFollowing up on Don Howard\u2019s research, Kristian Camilleri (2006,\n2007) points to the fact that complementarity was originally thought\nby Bohr (in his Como-paper) to exist between the space-time\ndescription and the causal description of the stationary states of\natoms \u2014 and not between different experimental outcomes of the\nfree electron. So the formulation of complementarity was restricted to\nthe concept of stationary states because only there does the system\nhave a well-defined energy state independent of any measurement. This\nobservation deserves general recognition. But when Bohr rather soon\nthereafter began analysing the double slit experiment in his\ndiscussion with Einstein (1930), he had to extend his interpretation\nto cover the electron in interaction with the measuring apparatus.\n\nCamilleri then shows how Heisenberg\u2019s view of complementarity,\nin spite of Heisenberg\u2019s own testimony, radically differs from\nBohr\u2019s. As Heisenberg understood complementarity between the\nspace-time description and causal description, it holds between the\nclassical description of experimental phenomena and the description of\nthe state of the system in terms of the wave function. A quotation\nfrom Heisenberg (1958, p. 50) shows how much he misunderstood Bohr in\nspite of their previously close working relationship.\n\nBohr uses the concept of \u2018complementarity\u2019 at several\nplaces in the interpretation of quantum theory \u2026 The space-time\ndescription of the atomic events is complementary to their\ndeterministic description. The probability function obeys an equation\nof motion as did the co-ordinates in Newtonian mechanics; its change\nin the course of time is completely determined by the quantum\nmechanical equation; it does not allow a description in space and time\nbut breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by\nchanging our knowledge of the system.\n\n\nSo, where Bohr identified the causal description with the conservation\nof energy, Heisenberg saw it as the deterministic evolution of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s \u03c8-function. In other words,\nHeisenberg, in contrast to Bohr, believed that the wave equation gave\na causal, albeit probabilistic description of the free electron in\nconfiguration space. It also explains why so many philosophers and\nphysicists have identified the Copenhagen interpretation with the\nmysterious collapse of the wave packet. The transition from a causal\ndescription in terms of the evolution of the \u03c8-function\nto a classical space-time description is characterized by the\ndiscontinuous change that occurs by the act of measurement. According\nto Heisenberg, these two modes of description are complementary.\n\nIn another study Ravi Gomatam (2007) agrees with Howard\u2019s\nexposition in arguing that Bohr\u2019s interpretation of\ncomplementarity and the textbook Copenhagen interpretation (i.e.\nwave-particle duality and wave packet collapse) are incompatible. More\nrecently, Henderson (2010) has come to a similar conclusion. He makes\na distinction between different versions of Copenhagen interpretations\nbased on statements from some of the main characters. On one side of\nthe spectrum there is Bohr who did not think of quantum measurement in\nterms of a collapse of the wave function (for a contrasting view see\nJens Hebor 2005; and partly Zinkernagel 2016); in the middle we find\nHeisenberg talking about the collapse as an objective physical process\nbut thinking that this couldn\u2019t be analyzed any further because\nof its indeterministic nature, and at the opposite side Johann von\nNeumann and Eugene Wigner argued that the human mind has a direct\ninfluence on the reduction of the wave packet. Unfortunately, von\nNeumann\u2019s dualistic view has become part of the Copenhagen\nmethodology by people opposing this interpretation.\n",
