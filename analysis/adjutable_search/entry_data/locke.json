    "preamble": "\n\nJohn Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxford\nacademic and medical researcher. Locke\u2019s monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (1689) is one of the first great\ndefenses of modern empiricism and concerns itself with determining the\nlimits of human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics.\nIt thus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to\nknow and what one cannot. Locke\u2019s association with Anthony\nAshley Cooper (later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become\nsuccessively a government official charged with collecting information\nabout trade and colonies, economic writer, opposition political\nactivist, and finally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed\nin the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Among Locke\u2019s political\nworks he is most famous for The Second Treatise of Government\nin which he argues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains\nthe nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the\nsocial contract. He is also famous for calling for the separation of\nChurch and State in his Letter Concerning Toleration. Much of\nLocke\u2019s work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism.\nThis is apparent both on the level of the individual person and on the\nlevel of institutions such as government and church. For the\nindividual, Locke wants each of us to use reason to search after truth\nrather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject to\nsuperstition. He wants us to proportion assent to propositions to the\nevidence for them. On the level of institutions it becomes important\nto distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate functions of\ninstitutions and to make the corresponding distinction for the uses of\nforce by these institutions. Locke believes that using reason to try\nto grasp the truth, and determine the legitimate functions of\ninstitutions will optimize human flourishing for the individual and\nsociety both in respect to its material and spiritual welfare. This in\nturn, amounts to following natural law and the fulfillment of the\ndivine purpose for humanity.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical Background and Locke\u2019s Life\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) was one of the greatest philosophers in\nEurope at the end of the seventeenth century. Locke grew up and lived\nthrough one of the most extraordinary centuries of English political\nand intellectual history. It was a century in which conflicts between\nCrown and Parliament and the overlapping conflicts between\nProtestants, Anglicans and Catholics swirled into civil war in the\n1640s. With the defeat and death of Charles I, there began a great\nexperiment in governmental institutions including the abolishment of\nthe monarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican church, and the\nestablishment of Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Protectorate in the 1650s.\nThe collapse of the Protectorate after the death of Cromwell was\nfollowed by the Restoration of Charles II\u2014the return of the\nmonarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican Church. This period\nlasted from 1660 to 1688. It was marked by continued conflicts between\nKing and Parliament and debates over religious toleration for\nProtestant dissenters and Catholics. This period ends with the\nGlorious Revolution of 1688 in which James II was driven from England\nand replaced by William of Orange and his wife Mary. The final period\nduring which Locke lived involved the consolidation of power by\nWilliam and Mary, and the beginning of William\u2019s efforts to\noppose the domination of Europe by the France of Louis XIV, which\nlater culminated in the military victories of John Churchill\u2014the\nDuke of Marlborough.\n1.1 Locke\u2019s Life up to His Meeting with Lord Ashley in 1666\n\nLocke was born in Wrington to Puritan parents of modest means. His\nfather was a country lawyer who served in a cavalry company on the\nPuritan side in the early stages of the English Civil War. His\nfather\u2019s commander, Alexander Popham, became the local MP, and\nit was his patronage which allowed the young John Locke to gain an\nexcellent education. In 1647 Locke went to Westminster School in\nLondon.\n\nFrom Westminster school he went to Christ Church, Oxford, in the\nautumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. As Westminster school was the\nmost important English school, so Christ Church was the most important\nOxford college. Education at Oxford was medieval. Locke, like Hobbes\nbefore him, found the Aristotelian philosophy he was taught at Oxford\nof little use. There was, however, more at Oxford than Aristotle. The\nnew experimental philosophy had arrived. John Wilkins,\nCromwell\u2019s brother in law, had become Warden of Wadham College.\nThe group around Wilkins was the nucleus of what was to become the\nEnglish Royal Society. The Society grew out of informal meetings and\ndiscussion groups and moved to London after the Restoration and became\na formal institution in the 1660s with charters from Charles II. The\nSociety saw its aims in contrast with the Scholastic/Aristotelian\ntraditions that dominated the universities. The program was to study\nnature rather than\n books.[1]\n Many of Wilkins associates were people interested in pursuing\nmedicine by observation rather than the reading of classic texts.\nBacon\u2019s interest in careful experimentation and the systematic\ncollection of facts from which generalizations could be made was\ncharacteristic of this group. One of Locke\u2019s friends from\nWestminster school, Richard Lower, introduced Locke to medicine and\nthe experimental philosophy being pursued by the virtuosi at\nWadham.\n\nLocke received his B.A. in February 1656. His career at Oxford,\nhowever, continued beyond his undergraduate days. In June of 1658,\nLocke qualified as a Master of Arts and was elected a Senior Student\nof Christ Church College. The rank was equivalent to a Fellow at any\nof the other colleges, but was not permanent. Locke had yet to\ndetermine what his career was to be. Locke was elected Lecturer in\nGreek at Christ Church in December of 1660 and he was elected Lecturer\nin Rhetoric in 1663. At this point, Locke needed to make a decision.\nThe statutes of Christ Church laid it down that fifty five of the\nsenior studentships should be reserved for men in orders or reading\nfor orders. Only five could be held by others, two in medicine, two in\nlaw and one in moral philosophy. Thus, there was good reason for Locke\nto become a clergyman. Since his graduation Locke had been studying\nmedicine. Locke decided to become a doctor.\n\nJohn Wilkins had left Oxford with the Restoration of Charles II. The\nnew leader of the Oxford scientific group was Robert Boyle. He was\nalso Locke\u2019s scientific mentor. Boyle (with the help of his\nastonishing assistant Robert Hooke) built an air pump which led to the\nformulation of Boyle\u2019s law and devised a barometer as a weather\nindicator. The work on the air pump led to a controversy with Thomas\nHobbes because Boyle\u2019s explanations of the working of the air\npump were incompatible with Hobbes\u2019 micro-corpuscular theory.\nThis controversy continued for ten years. Boyle was, however, most\ninfluential as a theorist. He was a mechanical philosopher who treated\nthe world as reducible to matter in motion. But he had no\nmicro-corpuscular account of the air.\n\nLocke read Boyle before he read Descartes. When he did read Descartes,\nhe saw the great French philosopher as providing a viable alternative\nto the sterile Aristotelianism he had been taught at Oxford. In\nwriting An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Locke adopted\nDescartes\u2019 \u2018way of ideas\u2019; though it is transformed\nso as to become an organic part of Locke\u2019s philosophy. Still,\nwhile admiring Descartes, Locke\u2019s involvement with the Oxford\nscientists gave him a perspective that made him critical of the\nrationalist elements in Descartes\u2019 philosophy.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Reader at the beginning of the Essay\nLocke remarks:\n\n\nThe commonwealth of learning is not at this time without\nmaster-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but everyone\nmust not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces\nsuch masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton,\nwith some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed\nas an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing\nsome of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge \u2026. (N:\n9\u201310; all quotations are from the Nidditch edition of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding [N])\n\n\nLocke knew all of these men and their work. Locke, Boyle and Newton\nwere all founding or early members of the English Royal Society. It is\nfrom Boyle that Locke learned about atomism (or the corpuscular\nhypothesis) and it is from Boyle\u2019s book The Origin of Forms\nand Qualities that Locke took the language of primary and\nsecondary qualities. Sydenham was an English physician and Locke did\nmedical research with him. Sydenham championed careful observation of\ndisease and rejected appeal to underlying causes. Both Boyle and\nNewton did work on colors that did not involve micro-corpuscular\nexplanations. Locke read Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica\nPhilosophiae Naturalis while in exile in Holland, and consulted\nHuygens as to the soundness of its mathematics. Locke and Newton\nbecame friends after Locke\u2019s return from Holland in 1688. It may\nbe that in referring to himself as an \u2018under-labourer\u2019,\nLocke is not only displaying a certain literary modesty, he is\ncontrasting the positive discoveries of these men, with his own\nattempt to show the inadequacies of the Aristotelian and Scholastic\nand to some degree the Cartesian philosophies. There are, however,\nmany aspects of Locke\u2019s project to which this image of an\nunder-labourer does not do justice (see Jolley 1999: 15\u201317).\nWhile the corpuscular philosophy and Newton\u2019s discoveries\nclearly influenced Locke, it is the Baconian program of producing\nnatural histories that Locke makes reference to when he talks about\nthe Essay in the Introduction. He writes:\n\n\nIt shall suffice to my present Purpose, to consider the discerning\nFaculties of a Man, as they are employ\u2019d about the Objects,\nwhich they have to do with: and I shall imagine that I have not wholly\nmisimploy\u2019d my self in the Thoughts I shall have on this\nOccasion, if in this Historical, Plain Method, I can give any Account\nof the Ways, whereby our Understanding comes to attain those Notions\nof Things, and can set down any Measure of the Certainty of our\nKnowledge\u2026. (I.1.2, N: 43\u20134\u2014the three numbers, are\nbook, chapter and section numbers respectively, followed by the page\nnumber in the Nidditch edition)\n\n\nThe \u2018Historical, Plain Method\u2019 is apparently to give a\ngenetic account of how we come by our ideas. Presumably this will\nreveal the degree of certainty of the knowledge based on such ideas.\nLocke\u2019s own active involvement with the scientific movement was\nlargely through his informal studies of medicine. Dr. David Thomas was\nhis friend and collaborator. Locke and Thomas had a laboratory in\nOxford which was very likely, in effect, a pharmacy. In 1666 Lord\nAshley, one of the richest men in England, came to Oxford in order to\ndrink some medicinal waters there. He had asked Dr. Thomas to provide\nthem. Thomas had to be out of town and asked Locke to see that the\nwater was delivered. As a result of this encounter, Ashley invited\nLocke to come to London as his personal physician. In 1667 Locke did\nmove to London becoming not only Lord Ashley\u2019s personal\nphysician, but secretary, researcher, political operative and friend.\nLiving with him Locke found himself at the very heart of English\npolitics in the 1670s and 1680s.\n1.2 Locke and Lord Shaftesbury 1666 to 1688\n\nLocke\u2019s chief work while living at Lord Ashley\u2019s\nresidence, Exeter House, in 1668 was as Ashley\u2019s physician.\nLocke used his medical training to organize a successful operation on\nAshley. This was perhaps the most carefully documented operation in\nthe 17th century. Locke consulted doctors across the country to\ndetermine what the best practices were for this operation and made\ncleanliness a priority. In doing so he saved his patron\u2019s life\nand thus changed English history.\n\nLocke had a number of other jobs. He worked as secretary of the Board\nof Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of the\nCarolinas. Lord Ashley was one of the advocates of the view that\nEngland would prosper through trade and that colonies could play an\nimportant role in promoting trade. Ashley persuaded Charles II to\ncreate a Board of Trade and Plantations to collect information about\ntrade and colonies, and Locke became its secretary. In his capacity as\nthe secretary of the Board of Trade Locke was the collection point for\ninformation from around the globe about trade and colonies for the\nEnglish government. Among Ashley\u2019s commercial projects was an\neffort to found colonies in the Carolinas. In his capacity as the\nsecretary to the Lords Proprietors, Locke was involved in the writing\nof the fundamental constitution of the Carolinas. There is some\ncontroversy about the extent of Locke\u2019s role in writing the\n constitution.[2]\n In addition to issues about trade and colonies, Locke was involved\nthrough Shaftesbury in other controversies about public policy. There\nwas a monetary crisis in England involving the value of money, and the\nclipping of coins. Locke wrote papers for Lord Ashley on economic\nmatters, including the coinage crisis.\n\nWhile living in London at Exeter House, Locke continued to be involved\nin philosophical discussions. He tells us that:\n\n\nWere it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should\ntell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and\ndiscoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves\nquickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After\nwe had awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a\nresolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my\nthoughts that we took a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves\nupon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own\nabilities, and see what objects our understandings were, or were not,\nfitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all readily\nassented; and thereupon it was agreed that this should be our first\ninquiry. Some hasty and undigested thoughts, on a subject I had never\nbefore considered, which I set down against our next meeting, gave the\nfirst entrance into this Discourse; which having been thus begun by\nchance, was continued by intreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and\nafter long intervals of neglect, resumed again, as my humour or\noccasions permitted; and at last, in a retirement where an attendance\non my health gave me leisure, it was brought into that order thou now\nseest it. (Epistle to the Reader, N: 7)\n\n\nJames Tyrrell, one of Locke\u2019s friends was at that meeting. He\nrecalls the discussion being about the principles of morality and\nrevealed religion (Cranston 1957: 140\u20131). Thus the Oxford\nscholar and medical researcher came to begin the work which was to\noccupy him off and on over the next twenty years.\n\nIn 1674 after Shaftesbury had left the government, Locke went back to\nOxford, where he acquired the degree Bachelor of medicine, and a\nlicense to practice medicine, and then went to France (Cranston 1957:\n160). In France Locke went from Calais to Paris, Lyons and on to\nMontpellier, where he spent the next fifteen months. Much of\nLocke\u2019s time was spent learning about Protestantism in France.\nThe Edict of Nantes (promulgated by Henry IV in 1598) was in force,\nand so there was a degree of religious toleration in France. Louis XIV\nwas to revoke the edict in 1685 and French Protestants were then\nkilled while some 400,000 went into exile.\n\nWhile Locke was in France, Shaftesbury\u2019s fortunes fluctuated. In\n1676 Shaftesbury was imprisoned in the tower. His imprisonment lasted\nfor a year. In 1678, after the mysterious murder of a London judge,\ninformers (most notably Titus Oates) started coming forward to reveal\na supposed Catholic conspiracy to assassinate the King and put his\nbrother on the throne. This whipped up public anti-Catholic frenzy.\nThough Shaftesbury had not fabricated the conspiracy story, nor did he\nprompt Oates to come forward, he did exploit the situation to the\nadvantage of his party. In the public chaos surrounding the\nsensational revelations, Shaftesbury organized an extensive party\nnetwork, exercised great control over elections, and built up a large\nparliamentary majority. His strategy was to secure the passage of an\nExclusion bill that would prevent Charles II\u2019s openly Catholic\nbrother from becoming King. Although the Exclusion bill passed in the\nCommons it was rejected in the House of Lords because of the\nKing\u2019s strong opposition to it. As the panic over the Popish\nplot receded, Shaftesbury was left without a following or a cause.\nShaftesbury was seized on July 21, 1681 and again put in the tower. He\nwas tried on trumped-up charges of treason but acquitted by a London\ngrand jury (filled with his supporters) in November.\n\nAt this point some of the Country Party leaders began plotting an\narmed insurrection which, had it come off, would have begun with the\nassassination of Charles and his brother on their way back to London\nfrom the races at Newmarket. The chances of such a rising occurring\nwere not as good as the plotters supposed. Memories of the turmoil of\nthe civil war were still relatively fresh. Eventually Shaftesbury, who\nwas moving from safe house to safe house, gave up and fled to Holland\nin November 1682. He died there in January 1683. Locke stayed in\nEngland until the Rye House Plot (named after the house from which the\nplotters were to fire upon the King and his brother) was discovered in\nJune of 1683. Locke left for the West country to put his affairs in\norder the very week the plot was revealed to the government and by\nSeptember he was in exile in\n Holland.[3]\n\nWhile in exile, Locke finished An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding and published a fifty-page advanced notice of it in\nFrench. (This was to provide the intellectual world on the continent\nwith most of their information about the Essay until Pierre\nCoste\u2019s French translation appeared in 1704.) He also wrote and\npublished his Epistola de Tolerentia in Latin. Richard\nAshcraft, in his Revolutionary Politics and Locke\u2019s Two\nTreatises of Government (1986) suggests that while in Holland,\nLocke was not only finishing An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding and nursing his health, he was closely associated\nwith the English revolutionaries in exile. The English government was\nmuch concerned with this group. They tried to get a number of them,\nincluding Locke, extradited to England. Locke\u2019s studentship at\nOxford was taken away from him. In the meanwhile, the English\nintelligence service infiltrated the rebel group in Holland and\neffectively thwarted their efforts\u2014at least for a while. While\nLocke was living in exile in Holland, Charles II died on Feb. 6, 1685,\nand was succeeded by his brother, who became James II of England. Soon\nafter this, the rebels in Holland sent a force of soldiers under the\nDuke of Monmouth to England to try to overthrow James II. The revolt\nwas crushed, and Monmouth was captured and executed (Ashcraft 1986).\nFor a meticulous, if cautious review, of the evidence concerning\nLocke\u2019s involvement with the English rebels in exile see Roger\nWoolhouse\u2019s Locke: A Biography (2007).\n\nUltimately, however, the rebels were successful. James II alienated\nmost of his supporters, and William of Orange was invited to bring a\nDutch force to England. After William\u2019s army landed, James II,\nrealizing that he could not mount an effective resistance, fled the\ncountry to exile in France. This became known as the Glorious\nRevolution of 1688. It is a watershed in English history. For it marks\nthe point at which the balance of power in the English government\npassed from the King to the Parliament. Locke returned to England in\nFebruary 1689.\n1.3 The End of Locke\u2019s Life 1689\u20131704\n\nAfter his return from exile, Locke published An Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding and The Two Treatises of Government.\nIn addition, Popple\u2019s translation of Locke\u2019s A Letter\nConcerning Toleration was also published. It is worth noting that\nthe Two Treatises and the Letter Concerning\nToleration were published anonymously. Locke took up residence in\nthe country at Oates in Essex, the home of Sir Francis and Lady Masham\n(Damaris Cudworth). Locke had met Damaris Cudworth in 1682 and became\ninvolved intellectually and romantically with her. She was the\ndaughter of Ralph Cudworth, the Cambridge Platonist, and a philosopher\nin her own right. After Locke went into exile in Holland in 1683, she\nmarried Sir Francis Masham. Locke and Lady Masham remained good\nfriends and intellectual companions to the end of Locke\u2019s life.\nDuring the remaining years of his life, Locke oversaw four more\neditions of the Essay and engaged in controversies over the\nEssay most notably in a series of published letters with\nEdward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester. In a similar way, Locke\ndefended the Letter Concerning Toleration against a series of\nattacks. He wrote The Reasonableness of Christianity and\nSome Thoughts on Education during this period as well.\n\nNor was Locke finished with public affairs. In 1696 the Board of Trade\nwas revived. Locke played an important part in its revival and served\nas the most influential member on it until 1700. The new Board of\nTrade had administrative powers and was, in fact, concerned with a\nwide range of issues, from the Irish wool trade and the suppression of\npiracy, to the treatment of the poor in England and the governance of\nthe colonies. It was, in Peter Laslett\u2019s phrase \u201cthe body\nwhich administered the United States before the American\nRevolution\u201d (Laslett 1954 [1990: 127]). During these last eight\nyears of his life, Locke was asthmatic, and he suffered so much from\nit that he could only bear the smoke of London during the four warmer\nmonths of the year. Locke plainly engaged in the activities of the\nBoard out of a strong sense of patriotic duty. After his retirement\nfrom the Board of Trade in 1700, Locke remained in retirement at Oates\nuntil his death on Sunday 28 October 1704.\n2. The Limits of Human Understanding\n\nLocke is often classified as the first of the great English\nempiricists (ignoring the claims of Bacon and Hobbes). This reputation\nrests on Locke\u2019s greatest work, the monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding. Locke explains his project in\nseveral places. Perhaps the most important of his goals is to\ndetermine the limits of human understanding. Locke writes:\n\n\nFor I thought that the first Step towards satisfying the several\nEnquiries, the Mind of Man was apt to run into, was, to take a Survey\nof our own Understandings, examine our own Powers, and see to what\nThings they were adapted. Till that was done, I suspected that we\nbegan at the wrong end, and in vain sought for Satisfaction in a quiet\nand secure Possession of Truths, that most concern\u2019d us whilst\nwe let loose our Thoughts into the vast Ocean of Being, as if\nall the boundless Extent, were the natural and undoubted Possessions\nof our Understandings, wherein there was nothing that escaped its\nDecisions, or that escaped its Comprehension. Thus Men, extending\ntheir Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts\nwander into those depths where they can find no sure Footing;\n\u2019tis no Wonder, that they raise Questions and multiply Disputes,\nwhich never coming to any clear Resolution, are proper to only\ncontinue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in a\nperfect Skepticism. Wheras were the Capacities of our Understanding\nwell considered, the Extent of our Knowledge once discovered, and the\nHorizon found, which sets the boundary between the enlightened and the\ndark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible\nby us, Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the\navow\u2019d Ignorance of the one; and employ their Thoughts and\nDiscourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other. (I.1.7,\nN: 47)\n\n\nSome philosophers before Locke had suggested that it would be good to\nfind the limits of the Understanding, but what Locke does is to carry\nout this project in detail. In the four books of the Essay\nLocke considers the sources and nature of human knowledge. Book I\nargues that we have no innate knowledge. (In this he resembles\nBerkeley and Hume, and differs from Descartes and Leibniz.) So, at\nbirth, the human mind is a sort of blank slate on which experience\nwrites. In Book II Locke claims that ideas are the materials of\nknowledge and all ideas come from experience. The term\n\u2018idea\u2019, Locke tells us \u201c\u2026stands for\nwhatsoever is the Object of the Understanding, when a man\nthinks\u201d (I.1.8, N: 47). Experience is of two kinds, sensation\nand reflection. One of these\u2014sensation\u2014tells us about\nthings and processes in the external world. The\nother\u2014reflection\u2014tells us about the operations of our own\nminds. Reflection is a sort of internal sense that makes us conscious\nof the mental processes we are engaged in. Some ideas we get only from\nsensation, some only from reflection and some from both.\n\nLocke has an atomic or perhaps more accurately a corpuscular theory of\n ideas.[4]\n There is, that is to say, an analogy between the way atoms or\ncorpuscles combine into complexes to form physical objects and the way\nideas combine. Ideas are either simple or complex. We cannot create\nsimple ideas, we can only get them from experience. In this respect\nthe mind is passive. Once the mind has a store of simple ideas, it can\ncombine them into complex ideas of a variety of kinds. In this respect\nthe mind is active. Thus, Locke subscribes to a version of the\nempiricist axiom that there is nothing in the intellect that was not\npreviously in the senses\u2014where the senses are broadened to\ninclude reflection. Book III deals with the nature of language, its\nconnections with ideas and its role in knowledge. Book IV, the\nculmination of the previous reflections, explains the nature and\nlimits of knowledge, probability, and the relation of reason and\nfaith. Let us now consider the Essay in some detail.\n2.1 Book I\n\nAt the beginning of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke says that since his purpose is \u201cto enquire into the\nOriginal, Certainty and Extent of human knowledge, together with the\ngrounds and degrees of Belief, Opinion and Assent\u201d he is going\nto begin with ideas\u2014the materials out of which knowledge is\nconstructed. His first task is to \u201cenquire into the Original of\nthese Ideas\u2026and the ways whereby the Understanding comes to be\nfurnished with them\u201d (I.1.3, N: 44). The role of Book I of the\nEssay is to make the case that being innate is not a way in\nwhich the understanding is furnished with principles and ideas. Locke\ntreats innateness as an empirical hypothesis and argues that there is\nno good evidence to support it.\n\nLocke describes innate ideas as \u201csome primary\nnotions\u2026Characters as it were stamped upon the Mind of Man,\nwhich the Soul receives in its very first Being; and brings into the\nworld with it\u201d (I.2.1, N: 48). In pursuing this enquiry, Locke\nrejects the claim that there are speculative innate principles (I.2),\npractical innate moral principles (I.3) or that we have innate ideas\nof God, identity or impossibility (I.4). Locke rejects arguments from\nuniversal assent and attacks dispositional accounts of innate\nprinciples. Thus, in considering what would count as evidence from\nuniversal assent to such propositions as \u201cWhat is, is\u201d or\n\u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be\u201d\nhe holds that children and idiots should be aware of such truths if\nthey were innate but that they \u201chave not the least apprehension\nor thought of them\u201d. Why should children and idiots be aware of\nand able to articulate such propositions? Locke says:\n\n\nIt seems to me a near Contradiction to say that there are truths\nimprinted on the Soul, which it perceives or understands not;\nimprinting if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making\ncertain Truths to be perceived. (I.2.5, N: 49)\n\n\nSo, Locke\u2019s first point is that if propositions were innate they\nshould be immediately perceived\u2014by infants and idiots (and\nindeed everyone else)\u2014but there is no evidence that they are.\nLocke then proceeds to attack dispositional accounts that say,\nroughly, that innate propositions are capable of being perceived under\ncertain circumstances. Until these circumstances come about the\npropositions remain unperceived in the mind. With the advent of these\nconditions, the propositions are then perceived. Locke gives the\nfollowing argument against innate propositions being\ndispositional:\n\n\nFor if any one [proposition] may [be in the mind but not be known];\nthen, by the same Reason, all Propositions that are true, and the Mind\nis ever capable of assenting to, may be said to be in the Mind, and to\nbe imprinted: since if any one can be said to be in the Mind, which it\nnever yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of knowing it;\nand so the Mind is of all Truths it ever shall know. (I.2.5, N:\n50)\n\n\nThe essence of this argument and many of Locke\u2019s other arguments\nagainst dispositional accounts of innate propositions is that such\ndispositional accounts do not provide an adequate criterion for\ndistinguishing innate propositions from other propositions that the\nmind may come to discover. Thus, even if some criterion is proposed,\nit will turn out not to do the work it is supposed to do.\n\nWhen Locke turns from speculative principles to the question of\nwhether there are innate practical moral principles, many of the\narguments against innate speculative principles continue to apply, but\nthere are some additional considerations. Practical principles, such\nas the Golden Rule, are not self-evident in the way such speculative\nprinciples as \u201cWhat is, is\u201d are. Thus, one can clearly and\nsensibly ask reasons for why one should hold the Golden Rule true or\nobey it (I.3.4, N: 68). There are substantial differences between\npeople over the content of practical principles. Thus, they are even\nless likely candidates to be innate propositions or to meet the\ncriterion of universal assent. In the fourth chapter of Book I, Locke\nraises similar points about the ideas which compose both speculative\nand practical principles. The point is that if the ideas that are\nconstitutive of the principles are not innate, this gives us even more\nreason to hold that the principles are not innate. He examines the\nideas of identity, impossibility and God to make these points.\n\nIn Book I Locke says little about who holds the doctrine of innate\nprinciples that he is attacking. For this reason he has sometimes been\naccused of attacking straw men. John Yolton has persuasively argued\n(Yolton 1956) that the view that innate ideas and principles were\nnecessary for the stability of religion, morality and natural law was\nwidespread in England in the seventeenth century, and that in\nattacking both the naive and the dispositional account of innate ideas\nand innate principles, Locke is attacking positions which were widely\nheld and continued to be held after the publication of the\nEssay. Thus, the charge that Locke\u2019s account of innate\nprinciples is made of straw, is not a just criticism. But there are\nalso some important connections with particular philosophers and\nschools that are worth noting and some points about innate ideas and\ninquiry.\n\nAt I. 4. 24. Locke tells us that the doctrine of innate principles\nonce accepted \u201ceased the lazy from the pains of search\u201d\nand that the doctrine is an inquiry stopper that is used by those who\n\u201caffected to be Masters and Teachers\u201d to illegitimately\ngain control of the minds of their students. Locke rather clearly has\nin mind the Aristotelians and scholastics at the universities. Thus\nLocke\u2019s attack on innate principles is connected with his\nanti-authoritarianism. It is an expression of his view of the\nimportance of free and autonomous inquiry in the search for truth.\nUltimately, Locke holds, this is the best road to knowledge and\nhappiness. Locke, like Descartes, is tearing down the foundations of\nthe old Aristotelian scholastic house of knowledge. But while\nDescartes focused on the empiricism at the foundation of the\nstructure, Locke is focusing on the claims that innate ideas provide\nits first principles. The attack on innate ideas is thus the first\nstep in the demolition of the scholastic model of science and\nknowledge. Ironically, it is also clear from II.1.9. that Locke sees\nDescartes\u2019 claim that his essence is to be a thinking thing as\nentailing a doctrine of innate ideas and principles.\n2.2 Book II\n\nIn Book II of the Essay, Locke gives his positive account of\nhow we acquire the materials of knowledge. Locke distinguishes a\nvariety of different kinds of ideas in Book II. Locke holds that the\nmind is a tabula rasa or blank sheet until experience in the\nform of sensation and reflection provide the basic\nmaterials\u2014simple ideas\u2014out of which most of our more\ncomplex knowledge is constructed. While the mind may be a blank slate\nin regard to content, it is plain that Locke thinks we are born with a\nvariety of faculties to receive and abilities to manipulate or process\nthe content once we acquire it. Thus, for example, the mind can engage\nin three different types of action in putting simple ideas together.\nThe first of these kinds of action is to combine them into complex\nideas. Complex ideas are of two kinds, ideas of substances and ideas\nof modes. Substances are independent existences. Beings that count as\nsubstances include God, angels, humans, animals, plants and a variety\nof constructed things. Modes are dependent existences. These include\nmathematical and moral ideas, and all the conventional language of\nreligion, politics and culture. The second action which the mind\nperforms is the bringing of two ideas, whether simple or complex, by\none another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting\nthem. This gives us our ideas of relations (II.12.1, N: 163). The\nthird act of the mind is the production of our general ideas by\nabstraction from particulars, leaving out the particular circumstances\nof time and place, which would limit the application of an idea to a\nparticular individual. In addition to these abilities, there are such\nfaculties as memory which allow for the storing of ideas.\n\nHaving set forth the general machinery of how simple and complex ideas\nof substances, modes, relations, and so forth are derived from\nsensation and reflection, Locke also explains how a variety of\nparticular kinds of ideas, such as the ideas of solidity, number,\nspace, time, power, identity, and moral relations arise from sensation\nand reflection. Several of these are of particular interest.\nLocke\u2019s chapter on power gives rise to a discussion of free will\nand voluntary action (see the entry on\n Locke on freedom).\n Locke also made a number of interesting claims in the philosophy of\nmind. He suggested, for example, that for all we know, God could as\neasily add the powers of perception and thought to matter organized in\nthe right way as he could add those powers to an immaterial substance\nwhich would then be joined to matter organized in the right way. His\naccount of personal identity in II. xxvii was revolutionary. (See the\nentry on\n Locke on personal identity).\n Both of these topics and related ones are treated in the\nsupplementary document:\n Some Interesting Issues in Locke\u2019s Philosophy of Mind\n\n\nIn what follows, we focus on some central issues in Locke\u2019s\naccount of physical objects. (See also the entry\n Locke\u2019s philosophy of science,\n which pursues a number of topics related to Locke\u2019s account of\nphysical objects that are of considerable importance but largely\nbeyond the scope of this general account of Locke\u2019s philosophy.)\nThese include Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy, the\nlimitations of the corpuscular philosophy and Locke\u2019s relation\nto Newton.\n\nLocke offers an account of physical objects based on the mechanical\nphilosophy and the corpuscular hypothesis. The adherents of the\nmechanical philosophy held that all material phenomena can be\nexplained by matter in motion and the impact of one body on another.\nThey viewed matter as passive. They rejected the \u201coccult\nqualities\u201d and \u201ccausation at a distance\u201d of the\nAristotelian and Scholastic philosophy. Robert Boyle\u2019s\ncorpuscularian hypothesis treated the material world as made up of\nparticles. Some corpuscularians held that corpuscles could be further\ndivided and that the universe was full of matter with no void space.\nAtomists, on the other hand, held that the particles were indivisible\nand that the material world is composed of atoms and the void or empty\nspace in which the atoms move. Locke was an atomist.\n\nAtoms have properties. They are extended, they are solid, they have a\nparticular shape and they are in motion or rest. They combine together\nto produce the familiar stuff and physical objects, the gold and the\nwood, the horses and violets, the tables and chairs of our world.\nThese familiar things also have properties. They are extended, solid,\nhave a particular shape, and are in motion and at rest. In addition to\nthese properties that they share with the atoms that compose them,\nthey have other properties such as colors, smells, tastes that they\nget by standing in relation to perceivers. The distinction between\nthese two kinds of properties goes back to the Greek atomists. It is\narticulated by Galileo and Descartes as well as Locke\u2019s mentor\nRobert Boyle.\n\nLocke makes this distinction in Book II Chapter 8 of the\nEssay and using Boyle\u2019s terminology calls the two\ndifferent classes of properties the primary and secondary qualities of\nan object. This distinction is made by both of the main branches of\nthe mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth and early eighteenth\ncentury. Both the Cartesian plenum theorists, who held that the world\nwas full of infinitely divisible matter and that there was no void\nspace, and the atomists such as Gassendi, who held that there were\nindivisible atoms and void space in which the atoms move, made the\ndistinction between these two classes of properties. Still, the\ndifferences between these two branches of the mechanical philosophy\naffect their account of primary qualities. In the chapter on Solidity\n(II.4) Locke rejects the Cartesian definition of body as simply\nextended and argues that bodies are both extended and impenetrable or\nsolid. The inclusion of solidity in Locke\u2019s account of bodies\nand of primary qualities distinguishes them from the void space in\nwhich they move.\n\nThe primary qualities of an object are properties which the object\npossesses independent of us\u2014such as occupying space, being\neither in motion or at rest, having solidity and texture. The\nsecondary qualities are powers in bodies to produce ideas in us like\ncolor, taste, smell and so on that are caused by the interaction of\nour particular perceptual apparatus with the primary qualities of the\nobject. Our ideas of primary qualities resemble the qualities in the\nobject, while our ideas of secondary qualities do not resemble the\npowers that cause them. Locke also distinguishes a second class of\nsecondary properties that are the powers that one substance has to\neffect another, e.g. the power of a fire to melt a piece of wax.\n\nThere has been considerable scholarly debate concerning the details of\nLocke\u2019s account of the distinction. Among the issues are which\nqualities Locke assigns to each of the two categories. Locke gives\nseveral lists. Another issue is what the criterion is for putting a\nquality in one list rather than another. Does Locke hold that all the\nideas of secondary qualities come to us by one sense while the ideas\nof primary qualities come to us through two or is Locke not making the\ndistinction in this way? Another issue is whether there are only\nprimary qualities of atoms or whether compounds of atoms also have\nprimary qualities. And while Locke claims our ideas of primary\nqualities resemble the primary qualities in objects, and the ideas of\nsecondary qualities do not resemble their causes in the object, what\ndoes \u2018resemble\u2019 mean in this context? Related to this\nissue is how we are supposed to know about particles that we cannot\nsense. It seems clear that Locke holds that there are certain\nanalogies between the middle sized macroscopic objects we encounter in\nthe world, e.g. porphyry and manna for example, and the particles that\ncompose these things. Maurice Mandelbaum called this process\n\u2018transdiction\u2019. These analogies allow us to say certain\nthings about the nature of particles and primary and secondary\nqualities. For example we can infer that atoms are solid and that heat\nis a greater rate of motion of atoms while cold is a slower motion.\nBut these analogies may not get us very far in grasping the necessary\nconnections between qualities in nature. Yet another issue is whether\nLocke sees the distinction as reductionistic. If what we mean by\nreductionistic here is that only the primary qualities are real and\nthese explain the secondary qualities then there does not seem to be a\nclear answer. Secondary qualities surely are nothing more than certain\nprimary qualities that affect us in certain ways. This seems to be\nreductionistic. But on Locke\u2019s account of \u201creal\nideas\u201d in II.30 both the ideas of primary and secondary\nqualities count as real. And while Locke holds that our ideas of\nsecondary qualities are caused by primary qualities, in certain\nimportant respects the primary qualities do not explain them. Locke\nholds that we cannot even conceive how the size, figure and motion of\nparticles could cause any sensation in us. So, knowing the size,\nfigure and motion of the particles would be of no use to us in this\nregard (see IV.3.11\u201340, N: 544\u2013546).\n\nLocke probably holds some version of the representational theory of\nperception, though some scholars dispute this. On such a theory what\nthe mind immediately perceives are ideas, and the ideas are caused by\nand represent the objects which cause them. Thus perception is a\ntriadic relation, rather than simply being a dyadic relation between\nan object and a perceiver. Such a dyadic relational theory is often\ncalled naive realism because it suggests that the perceiver is\ndirectly perceiving the object, and naive because this view is open to\na variety of serious objections. Some versions of the representational\ntheory are open to serious objections as well. If, for example, one\ntreats ideas as things, then one can imagine that because one sees\nideas, the ideas actually block one from seeing things in the external\nworld. The idea would be like a picture or painting. The picture would\ncopy the original object in the external world, but because our\nimmediate object of perception is the picture we would be prevented\nfrom seeing the original just as standing in front of a painting on an\neasel might prevent us from seeing the person being painted. Thus,\nthis is sometimes called the picture/original theory of perception.\nAlternatively, Jonathan Bennett called it \u201cthe veil of\nperception\u201d to emphasize that \u2018seeing\u2019 the ideas\nprevents us from seeing the external world. One philosopher who\narguably held such a view was Nicholas Malebranche, a follower of\nDescartes. Antoine Arnauld, by contrast, while believing in the\nrepresentative character of ideas, is a direct realist about\nperception. Arnauld engaged in a lengthy controversy with Malebranche,\nand criticized Malebranche\u2019s account of ideas. Locke follows\nArnauld in his criticism of Malebranche on this point (Locke, 1823,\nVol. IX: 250). Yet Berkeley attributed the veil of perception\ninterpretation of the representational theory of perception to Locke\nas have many later commentators including Bennett. A.D. Woozley puts\nthe difficulty of doing this succinctly:\n\n\n\u2026it is scarcely credible both that Locke should be able to see\nand state so clearly the fundamental objection to the picture-original\ntheory of sense perception, and that he should have held the same\ntheory himself. (Woozley 1964: 27)\n\n\nJust what Locke\u2019s account of perception involves, is still a\nmatter of scholarly debate. A review of this issue at a symposium\nincluding John Rogers, Gideon Yaffe, Lex Newman, Tom Lennon, and Vere\nChappell at a meeting of the Pacific Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association in 2003 and later expanded and published in\nthe Pacific Philosophical Quarterly (2004, volume 85, issue\n3) found most of the symposiasts holding the view that Locke holds a\nrepresentative theory of perception but that he is not a skeptic about\nthe external world in the way that the veil of perception doctrine\nmight suggest.\n\nAnother issue that has been a matter of controversy since the first\npublication of the Essay is what Locke means by the term\n\u2018substance\u2019. The primary/secondary quality distinction\ngets us a certain ways in understanding physical objects, but Locke is\npuzzled about what underlies or supports the primary qualities\nthemselves. He is also puzzled about what material and immaterial\nsubstances might have in common that would lead us to apply the same\nword to both. These kinds of reflections led him to the relative and\nobscure idea of substance in general. This is an \u201cI know not\nwhat\u201d which is the support of qualities which cannot subsist by\nthemselves. We experience properties appearing in regular clumps, but\nwe must infer that there is something that supports or perhaps\n\u2018holds together\u2019 those qualities. For we have no\nexperience of that supporting substance. It is clear that Locke sees\nno alternative to the claim that there are substances supporting\nqualities. He does not, for example, have a theory of tropes (tropes\nare properties that can exist independently of substances) which he\nmight use to dispense with the notion of substance. (In fact, he may\nbe rejecting something like a theory of tropes when he rejects the\nAristotelian doctrine of real qualities and insists on the need for\nsubstances.) He is thus not at all a skeptic about\n\u2018substance\u2019 in the way that Hume is. But, it is also quite\nclear that he is regularly insistent about the limitations of our\nideas of substances. Bishop Stillingfleet accused Locke of putting\nsubstance out of the reasonable part of the world. But Locke is not\ndoing that.\n\nSince Berkeley, Locke\u2019s doctrine of the substratum or substance\nin general has been attacked as incoherent. It seems to imply that we\nhave a particular without any properties, and this seems like a notion\nthat is inconsistent with empiricism. We have no experience of such an\nentity and so no way to derive such an idea from experience. Locke\nhimself acknowledges this point (I.4.18, N: 95). In order to avoid\nthis problem, Michael Ayers has proposed that we must understand the\nnotions of \u2018substratum\u2019 and \u2018substance in\ngeneral\u2019 in terms of Locke\u2019s distinction between real and\nnominal essences and particularly his doctrine of real essences\ndeveloped in Book III of the Essay rather than as a separate\nproblem from that of knowing real essences. The real essence of a\nmaterial thing is its atomic constitution. This atomic constitution is\nthe causal basis of all the observable properties of the thing, from\nwhich we create nominal essences. Were the real essence known, all the\nobservable properties could be deduced from it. Locke claims that the\nreal essences of material things are quite unknown to us.\nLocke\u2019s concept of substance in general is also a\n\u2018something I know not what\u2019. Thus, on Ayers\u2019\ninterpretation \u2018substance in general\u2019 means something like\n\u2018whatever it is that supports qualities\u2019 while the real\nessence means \u2018this particular atomic constitution that explains\nthis set of observable qualities\u2019. Thus, Ayers wants to treat\nthe unknown substratum as picking out the same thing as the real\nessence\u2014thus eliminating the need for particulars without\nproperties. This proposed way of interpreting Locke has been\ncriticized by scholars both because of a lack of textural support, and\non the stronger grounds that it conflicts with some things that Locke\ndoes say (see Jolley 1999: 71\u20133). As we have reached one of the\nimportant concepts in Book III, let us turn to that Book and\nLocke\u2019s discussion of language.\n2.3 Book III\n\nLocke devotes Book III of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding to language. This is a strong indication that Locke\nthinks issues about language were of considerable importance in\nattaining knowledge. At the beginning of the Book he notes the\nimportance of abstract general ideas to knowledge. These serve as\nsorts under which we rank all the vast multitude of particular\nexistences. Thus, abstract ideas and classification are of central\nimportance in Locke\u2019s discussion of language and its importance\nfor knowledge. Without general terms and classes we would be faced\nwith the impossible task of trying to know a vast world of\nparticulars.\n\nThere is a clear connection between Books II and III in that Locke\nclaims that words stand for ideas. In his discussion of language Locke\ndistinguishes words according to the categories of ideas established\nin Book II of the Essay. So there are ideas of substances,\nsimple modes, mixed modes, relations and so on. It is in this context\nthat Locke makes the distinction between real and nominal essences\nnoted above. Perhaps because of his focus on the role that kind terms\nplay in classification, Locke pays vastly more attention to nouns than\nto verbs. Locke recognizes that not all words relate to ideas. There\nare also the many particles, words that \u201c\u2026signify the\nconnexion that the Mind gives to Ideas, or Propositions, one with\nanother\u201d (II.7.1, N: 471). Still, it is the relation of words\nand ideas that gets most of Locke\u2019s attention in Book III.\n\nNorman Kretzmann calls the claim that \u201cwords in their primary or\nimmediate signification signify nothing but the ideas in the mind\nof him that uses them\u201d (III.2.2) \u201cLocke\u2019s main\nsemantic thesis\u201d (see Kretzmann 1968:179). This thesis has often\nbeen criticized as a classic blunder in semantic theory. Thus Mill,\nfor example, wrote, \u201cWhen I say, \u2018the sun is the cause of\nthe day\u2019, I do not mean that my idea of the sun causes or\nexcites in me the idea of day\u201d (Mill 1843: bk 1, ch. 2, \u00a7\n1). This criticism of Locke\u2019s account of language parallels the\n\u201cveil of perception\u201d critique of his account of perception\nand suggests that Locke is not distinguishing the meaning of a word\nfrom its reference. Kretzmann, however, argues persuasively that Locke\ndistinguishes between meaning and reference and that ideas provide the\nmeaning but not the reference of words. Thus, the line of criticism\nrepresented by the quotation from Mill is ill founded.\n\nIn addition to the kinds of ideas noted above, there are also\nparticular and abstract ideas. Particular ideas have in them the ideas\nof particular places and times which limit the application of the idea\nto a single individual, while abstract general ideas leave out the\nideas of particular times and places in order to allow the idea to\napply to other similar qualities or things. There has been\nconsiderable philosophical and scholarly debate about the nature of\nthe process of abstraction and Locke\u2019s account of it. Berkeley\nargued that the process as Locke conceives it is incoherent. In part\nthis is because Berkeley is an imagist\u2014that is he believes that\nall ideas are images. If one is an imagist it becomes impossible to\nimagine what idea could include both the ideas of a right and\nequilateral triangle. Michael Ayers has recently argued that Locke too\nwas an imagist. This would make Berkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke\nvery much to the point. Ayers\u2019 claim, however, has been disputed\n(see, for example, Soles 1999). The process of abstraction is of\nconsiderable importance to human knowledge. Locke thinks most words we\nuse are general (III.1.1, N: 409). Clearly, it is only general or\nsortal ideas that can serve in a classificatory scheme.\n\nIn his discussion of names of substances and in the contrast between\nnames of substances and names of modes, a number of interesting\nfeatures of Locke\u2019s views about language and knowledge emerge.\nPhysical substances are atoms and things made up of atoms. But we have\nno experience of the atomic structure of horses and tables. We know\nhorses and tables mainly by secondary qualities such as color, taste\nand smell and so on and primary qualities such as shape, motion and\nextension. So, since the real essence (the atomic constitution) of a\nhorse is unknown to us, our word \u2018horse\u2019 cannot get its\nmeaning from that real essence. What the general word signifies is the\ncomplex of ideas we have decided are parts of the idea of that sort of\nthing. These ideas we get from experience. Locke calls such a general\nidea that picks out a sort, the nominal essence of that sort.\n\nOne of the central issues in Book III has to do with classification.\nOn what basis do we divide things into kinds and organize those kinds\ninto a system of species and genera? In the Aristotelian and\nScholastic tradition that Locke rejects, necessary properties are\nthose that an individual must have in order to exist and continue to\nexist. These contrast with accidental properties. Accidental\nproperties are those that an individual can gain and lose and yet\ncontinue in existence. If a set of necessary properties is shared by a\nnumber of individuals, that set of properties constitutes the essence\nof a natural kind. The borders between kinds are supposed to be sharp\nand determinate. The aim of Aristotelian science is to discover the\nessences of natural kinds. Kinds can then be organized hierarchically\ninto a classificatory system of species and genera. This\nclassification of the world by natural kinds will be unique and\nprivileged because it alone corresponds to the structure of the world.\nThis doctrine of essences and kinds is often called Aristotelian\nessentialism. Locke rejects a variety of aspects of this doctrine. He\nrejects the notion that an individual has an essence apart from being\ntreated as belonging to a kind. He also rejects the claim that there\nis a single classification of things in nature that the natural\nphilosopher should seek to discover. He holds that there are many\npossible ways to classify the world each of which might be\nparticularly useful depending on one\u2019s purposes.\n\nLocke\u2019s pragmatic account of language and the distinction\nbetween nominal and real essences constitute an anti-essentialist\nalternative to this Aristotelian essentialism and its correlative\naccount of the classification of natural kinds. He claims that there\nare no fixed boundaries in nature to be discovered\u2014that is there\nare no clear demarcation points between species. There are always\nborderline cases. There is debate over whether Locke\u2019s view is\nthat this lack of fixed boundaries is true on both the level of\nappearances and nominal essences, and atomic constitutions and real\nessences, or on the level of nominal essences alone. The first view is\nthat Locke holds that there are no Aristotelian natural kinds on\neither the level of appearance or atomic reality. The second view\nholds that Locke thinks there are Aristotelian natural kinds on the\natomic level, it is simply that we cannot get at them or know what\nthey are. On either of these interpretations, the real essence cannot\nprovide the meaning to names of substances. A.O. Lovejoy in the\nGreat Chain of Being, and David Wiggins are proponents of the\nsecond interpretation while Michael Ayers and William Uzgalis argue\nfor the first (Uzgalis 1988; Ayers 1991: II. 70).\n\nBy contrast, the ideas that we use to make up our nominal essences\ncome to us from experience. Locke claims that the mind is active in\nmaking our ideas of sorts and that there are so many properties to\nchoose among that it is possible for different people to make quite\ndifferent ideas of the essence of a certain substance. This has given\nsome commentators the impression that the making of sorts is utterly\narbitrary and conventional for Locke and that there is no basis for\ncriticizing a particular nominal essence. Sometimes Locke says things\nthat might suggest this. But this impression should be resisted. Peter\nAnstey has characterized Locke\u2019s conventionalism about\nclassificatory terms as both constrained and convergent (Anstey 2011:\n209, 212). Locke claims that while the making of nominal essences is\nthe work of the understanding, that work is constrained both by usage\n(where words stand for ideas that are already in use) and by the fact\nthat substance words are supposed to copy the properties of the\nsubstances they refer to. Locke says that our ideas of kinds of\nsubstances have as their archetype the complex of properties that\nproduce the appearances we use to make our nominal essences and which\ncause the unity of the complex of ideas that appear to us regularly\nconjoined. The very notion of an archetype implies constraints on what\nproperties (and hence what ideas) can go together. If there were no\nsuch constraints there could be no archetype. (For further discussion\nof the nominal-real essence distinction see the entry\n Locke on Real Essences).\n\nLet us begin with the usage of words. It is important in a community\nof language users that words be used with the same meaning. If this\ncondition is met it facilitates the chief end of language which is\ncommunication. If one fails to use words with the meaning that most\npeople attach to them, one will fail to communicate effectively with\nothers. Thus one would defeat the main purpose of language. It should\nalso be noted that traditions of usage for Locke can be modified.\nOtherwise we would not be able to improve our knowledge and\nunderstanding by getting more clear and determinate ideas.\n\nIn the making of the names of substances, there is a period of\ndiscovery as the abstract general idea is put together (e.g. the\ndiscovery of violets or gold) and then the naming of that idea and\nthen its introduction into language. Language itself is viewed as an\ninstrument for carrying out the mainly prosaic purposes and practices\nof everyday life. Ordinary people are the chief makers of\nlanguage.\n\n\nVulgar Notions suit vulgar Discourses; and both though confused\nenough, yet serve pretty well for the Market and the Wake. Merchants\nand Lovers, Cooks and Taylors, have Words wherewith to dispatch their\nordinary affairs; and so, I think, might Philosophers and Disputants\ntoo, if they had a mind to understand and to be clearly understood.\n(III.11.10, N: 514)\n\n\nThese ordinary people use a few apparent qualities, mainly ideas of\nsecondary qualities to make ideas and words that will serve their\npurposes.\n\nNatural philosophers (i.e. scientists) come along later to try to\ndetermine if the connections between properties which the ordinary\nfolk have put together in a particular idea in fact holds in nature.\nScientists are seeking to find the necessary connections between\nproperties. Still, even scientists, in Locke\u2019s view, are\nrestricted to using observable (and mainly secondary) qualities to\ncategorize things in nature. Sometimes, the scientists may find that\nthe ordinary folk had erred, as when they called whales\n\u2018fish\u2019. A whale is not a fish, as it turns out, but a\nmammal. There is a characteristic group of qualities that fish have\nthat whales do not have. There is a characteristic group of qualities\nthat mammals have that whales also have. To classify a whale as a\nfish, therefore, is a mistake. Similarly, we might make an idea of\ngold that only included being a soft metal and gold color. If so, we\nwould be unable to distinguish between gold and fool\u2019s gold.\nThus, since it is the mind that makes complex ideas (they are\n\u2018the workmanship of the understanding\u2019), one is free to\nput together any combination of ideas one wishes and call it what one\nwill. But the product of such work is open to criticism, either on the\ngrounds that it does not conform to already current usage or that it\ninadequately represents the archetypes that it is supposed to copy in\nthe world. We engage in such criticism in order to improve human\nunderstanding of the material world and thus the human condition. This\nis the convergent character of Locke\u2019s conventionalism. In\nbecoming more accurate, the nominal essence converges on the real\nessence.\n\nHowever, we should not forget the master-builders that Locke mentions\nat the beginning of the Essay. Stephen Gaukroger (2010)\nclaims that Locke\u2019s great achievement was to provide a\nphilosophical justification for the kind of experimental philosophy\nthat Boyle\u2019s work on the air pump, and his and Newton\u2019s\nwork on colors, as well as Sydenham\u2019s observational medicine.\nAll of these had been attacked for not providing explanations in terms\nof matter theory. Thus, Locke is justifying the autonomy of\nexperimental philosophy. Such experimental explanations depend solely\non the relation between phenomena, even when there is some\nmicro-corpuscular basis for the phenomena being explained. According\nto Gaukroger, this is Locke\u2019s contribution to the collapse of\nmechanism. For the details of the problem and its solution, see\nChapters 4 and 5 of Gaukroger (2010).\n\nThe distinction between modes and substances is surely one of the most\nimportant in Locke\u2019s philosophy. In contrast with substances,\nmodes are dependent existences\u2014they can be thought of as the\nordering of substances. These are technical terms for Locke, so we\nshould see how they are defined. Locke writes:\n\n\nFirst, Modes I call such complex Ideas, which\nhowever compounded, contain not in themselves the supposition of\nsubsisting by themselves; such are the ideas signified by the Words\nTriangle, Gratitude, Murther, etc. (II.12.4, N: 165)\n\n\nLocke goes on to distinguish between simple and mixed modes. He\nwrites:\n\n\nOf these Modes, there are two sorts, which deserve distinct\nconsideration. First, there are some that are only variations, or\ndifferent combinations of the same simple Idea, without the\nmixture of any other, as a dozen or score; which are nothing but the\nideas of so many distinct unities being added together, and\nthese I call simple Modes, as being contained within the\nbounds of one simple Idea. Secondly, There are others,\ncompounded of Ideas of several kinds, put together to make\none complex one; v.g. Beauty, consisting of a certain\ncombination of Colour and Figure, causing Delight to the Beholder;\nTheft, which being the concealed change of the Possession of\nany thing, without the consent of the Proprietor, contains, as is\nvisible, a combination of several Ideas of several kinds; and\nthese I call Mixed Modes. (II.12.5, N: 165)\n\n\nWhen we make ideas of modes, the mind is again active, but the\narchetype is in our mind. The question becomes whether things in the\nworld fit our ideas, and not whether our ideas correspond to the\nnature of things in the world. Our ideas are adequate. Thus we define\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 as an unmarried, adult, male human being. If we\nfind that someone does not fit this definition, this does not reflect\nbadly on our definition, it simply means that that individual does not\nbelong to the class of bachelors. Modes give us the ideas of\nmathematics, of morality, of religion and politics and indeed of human\nconventions in general. Since these modal ideas are not only made by\nus but serve as standards that things in the world either fit or do\nnot fit and thus belong or do not belong to that sort, ideas of modes\nare clear and distinct, adequate and complete. Thus in modes, we get\nthe real and nominal essences combined. One can give precise\ndefinitions of mathematical terms (that is, give necessary and\nsufficient conditions), and one can give deductive demonstrations of\nmathematical truths. Locke sometimes says that morality too is capable\nof deductive demonstration. Though pressed by his friend William\nMolyneux to produce such a demonstrative morality, Locke never did so.\nThe entry\n Locke\u2019s moral philosophy\n provides an excellent discussion of Locke\u2019s views on morality\nand issues related to them for which there is no room in this general\naccount. The terms of political discourse also have some of the same\nmodal features for Locke. When Locke defines the states of nature,\nslavery, and war in the Second Treatise of Government, for\nexample, we are presumably getting precise modal definitions from\nwhich one can deduce consequences. It is possible, however, that with\npolitics we are getting a study that requires both experience as well\nas the deductive modal aspect.\n2.4 Book IV\n\nIn the fourth book of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke tells us what knowledge is and what humans can know and what\nthey cannot (not simply what they do and do not happen to know). Locke\ndefines knowledge as \u201cthe perception of the connexion and\nagreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas\u201d\n(IV.1.1, N: 525). This definition of knowledge contrasts with the\nCartesian definition of knowledge as any ideas that are clear and\ndistinct. Locke\u2019s account of knowledge allows him to say that we\ncan know substances in spite of the fact that our ideas of them always\ninclude the obscure and relative idea of substance in general. Still,\nLocke\u2019s definition of knowledge raises in this domain a problem\nanalogous to those we have seen with perception and language. If\nknowledge is the \u201cperception of \u2026 the agreement or\ndisagreement \u2026 of any of our Ideas\u201d\u2014are we not\ntrapped in the circle of our own ideas? What about knowing the real\nexistence of things? Locke is plainly aware of this problem, and very\nlikely holds that the implausibility of skeptical hypotheses, such as\nDescartes\u2019 Dream hypothesis (he doesn\u2019t even bother to\nmention Descartes\u2019 malin genie or Evil Demon\nhypothesis), along with the causal connections between qualities and\nideas in his own system is enough to solve the problem. It is also\nworth noting that there are significant differences between\nLocke\u2019s brand of empiricism and that of Berkeley that would make\nit easier for Locke to solve the veil of perception problem than\nBerkeley. Locke, for example, makes transdictive inferences about\natoms where Berkeley is unwilling to allow that such inferences are\nlegitimate. This implies that Locke has a semantics that allows him to\ntalk about the unexperienced causes of experience (such as atoms)\nwhere Berkeley cannot. (See Mackie\u2019s perceptive discussion of\nthe veil of perception problem, in Problems from Locke, 1976:\n51 through 67.)\n\nWhat then can we know and with what degree of certainty? We can know\nthat God exists with the second highest degree of assurance, that of\ndemonstration. We also know that we exist with the highest degree of\ncertainty. The truths of morality and mathematics we can know with\ncertainty as well, because these are modal ideas whose adequacy is\nguaranteed by the fact that we make such ideas as ideal models which\nother things must fit, rather than trying to copy some external\narchetype which we can only grasp inadequately. On the other hand, our\nefforts to grasp the nature of external objects are limited largely to\nthe connection between their apparent qualities. The real essence of\nelephants and gold is hidden from us: though in general we suppose\nthem to be some distinct combination of atoms which cause the grouping\nof apparent qualities which leads us to see elephants and violets,\ngold and lead as distinct kinds. Our knowledge of material things is\nprobabilistic and thus opinion rather than knowledge. Thus our\n\u201cknowledge\u201d of external objects is inferior to our\nknowledge of mathematics and morality, of ourselves, and of God. We do\nhave sensitive knowledge of external objects, which is limited to\nthings we are presently experiencing. While Locke holds that we only\nhave knowledge of a limited number of things, he thinks we can judge\nthe truth or falsity of many propositions in addition to those we can\nlegitimately claim to know. This brings us to a discussion of\nprobability.\n2.5 Knowledge and Probability\n\nKnowledge involves the seeing of the agreement or disagreement of our\nideas. What then is probability and how does it relate to knowledge?\nLocke writes:\n\n\nThe Understanding Faculties being given to Man, not barely for\nSpeculation, but also for the Conduct of his Life, Man would be at a\ngreat loss, if he had nothing to direct him, but what has the\nCertainty of true Knowledge\u2026 Therefore, as God has set\nsome Things in broad day-light; as he has given us some certain\nKnowledge\u2026So in the greater part of our Concernment, he has\nafforded us only the twilight, as I may say so, of Probability,\nsuitable, I presume, to that State of Mediocrity and Probationership,\nhe has been pleased to place us in here, wherein to check our\nover-confidence and presumption, we might by every day\u2019s\nExperience be made sensible of our short sightedness and liableness to\nError\u2026 (IV.14.1\u20132, N: 652)\n\n\nSo, apart from the few important things that we can know for certain,\ne.g. the existence of ourselves and God, the nature of mathematics and\nmorality broadly construed, for the most part we must lead our lives\nwithout knowledge. What then is probability? Locke writes:\n\n\nAs Demonstration is the shewing of the agreement or disagreement of\ntwo Ideas, by the intervention of one or more Proofs, which have a\nconstant, immutable, and visible connexion one with another: so\nProbability is nothing but the appearance of such an Agreement or\nDisagreement, by the intervention of Proofs, whose connection is not\nconstant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so, but is\nor appears, for the most part to be so, and is enough to induce the\nMind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, rather than the\ncontrary. (IV.15.1, N: 654)\n\n\nProbable reasoning, on this account, is an argument, similar in\ncertain ways to the demonstrative reasoning that produces knowledge\nbut different also in certain crucial respects. It is an argument that\nprovides evidence that leads the mind to judge a proposition true or\nfalse but without a guarantee that the judgment is correct. This kind\nof probable judgment comes in degrees, ranging from near\ndemonstrations and certainty to unlikeliness and improbability in the\nvicinity of impossibility. It is correlated with degrees of assent\nranging from full assurance down to conjecture, doubt and\ndistrust.\n\nThe new science of mathematical probability had come into being on the\ncontinent just around the time that Locke was writing the\nEssay. His account of probability, however, shows little or\nno awareness of mathematical probability. Rather it reflects an older\ntradition that treated testimony as probable reasoning. Given that\nLocke\u2019s aim, above all, is to discuss what degree of assent we\nshould give to various religious propositions, the older conception of\nprobability very likely serves his purposes best. Thus, when Locke\ncomes to describe the grounds for probability he cites the conformity\nof the proposition to our knowledge, observation and experience, and\nthe testimony of others who are reporting their observation and\nexperience. Concerning the latter we must consider the number of\nwitnesses, their integrity, their skill in observation, counter\ntestimony and so on. In judging rationally how much to assent to a\nprobable proposition, these are the relevant considerations that the\nmind should review. We should, Locke also suggests, be tolerant of\ndiffering opinions as we have more reason to retain the opinions we\nhave than to give them up to strangers or adversaries who may well\nhave some interest in our doing so.\n\nLocke distinguishes two sorts of probable propositions. The first of\nthese have to do with particular existences or matters of fact, and\nthe second that are beyond the testimony of the senses. Matters of\nfact are open to observation and experience, and so all of the tests\nnoted above for determining rational assent to propositions about them\nare available to us. Things are quite otherwise with matters that are\nbeyond the testimony of the senses. These include the knowledge of\nfinite immaterial spirits such as angels or things such as atoms that\nare too small to be sensed, or the plants, animals or inhabitants of\nother planets that are beyond our range of sensation because of their\ndistance from us. Concerning this latter category, Locke says we must\ndepend on analogy as the only help for our reasoning. He writes:\n\n\nThus the observing that the bare rubbing of two bodies violently one\nupon the other, produce heat, and very often fire it self, we have\nreason to think, that what we call Heat and Fire consist of the\nviolent agitation of the imperceptible minute parts of the burning\nmatter\u2026. (IV.16.12, N: 665\u20136)\n\n\nWe reason about angels by considering the Great Chain of Being;\nfiguring that while we have no experience of angels, the ranks of\nspecies above us is likely as numerous as that below of which we do\nhave experience. This reasoning is, however, only probable.\n2.6 Reason, Faith and Enthusiasm\n\nThe relative merits of the senses, reason and faith for attaining\ntruth and the guidance of life were a significant issue during this\nperiod. As noted above James Tyrrell recalled that the original\nimpetus for the writing of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding was a discussion about the principles of morality\nand revealed religion. In Book IV Chapters 17, 18, and 19 Locke deals\nwith the nature of reason, the relation of reason to faith and the\nnature of enthusiasm. Locke remarks that all sects make use of reason\nas far as they can. It is only when this fails them that they have\nrecourse to faith and claim that what is revealed is above reason. But\nhe adds:\n\n\nAnd I do not see how they can argue with anyone or even convince a\ngainsayer who uses the same plea, without setting down strict\nboundaries between faith and reason. (IV.18.2, N: 689)\n\n\nLocke then defines reason as\n\n\nthe discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or\ntruths, which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas,\nas it has got by the use of its natural faculties; viz, by the use of\nsensation or reflection. (IV.18.2, N: 689)\n\n\nFaith, on the other hand, is assent to any proposition\n\u201c\u2026upon the credit of the proposer, as coming from God, in\nsome extraordinary way of communication\u201d. That is we have faith\nin what is disclosed by revelation and which cannot be discovered by\nreason. Locke also distinguishes between the original\nrevelation by God to some person, and traditional\nrevelation which is the original revelation\n\u201c\u2026delivered over to others in Words, and the ordinary\nways of our conveying our Conceptions one to another\u201d (IV.18.3,\nN: 690).\n\nLocke makes the point that some things could be discovered both by\nreason and by revelation\u2014God could reveal the propositions of\nEuclid\u2019s geometry, or they could be discovered by reason. In\nsuch cases there would be little use for faith. Traditional revelation\ncan never produce as much certainty as the contemplation of the\nagreement or disagreement of our own ideas. Similarly revelations\nabout matters of fact do not produce as much certainty as having the\nexperience oneself. Revelation, then, cannot contradict what we know\nto be true. If it could, it would undermine the trustworthiness of all\nof our faculties. This would be a disastrous result. Where revelation\ncomes into its own is where reason cannot reach. Where we have few or\nno ideas for reason to contradict or confirm, these are the proper\nmatters for faith.\n\n\n\u2026that Part of the Angels rebelled against GOD, and thereby lost\ntheir first happy state: and that the dead shall rise, and live again:\nThese and the like, being Beyond the Discovery of Reason, are purely\nmatters of Faith; with which Reason has nothing to do. (IV.18.8, N:\n694)\n\n\nStill, reason does have a crucial role to play in respect to\nrevelation. Locke writes:\n\n\nBecause the Mind, not being certain of the Truth of that it evidently\ndoes not know, but only yielding to the Probability that appears to\nit, is bound to give up its assent to such Testimony, which, it is\nsatisfied, comes from one who cannot err, and will not deceive. But\nyet, it still belongs to Reason, to judge of the truth of its being a\nRevelation, and of the significance of the Words, wherein it is\ndelivered. (IV.18.8, N: 694)\n\n\nSo, in respect to the crucial question of how we are to know whether a\nrevelation is genuine, we are supposed to use reason and the canons of\nprobability to judge. Locke claims that if the boundaries between\nfaith and reason are not clearly marked, then there will be no place\nfor reason in religion and one then gets all the \u201cextravagant\nOpinions and Ceremonies, that are to be found in the religions of the\nworld\u2026\u201d (IV.18.11, N: 696).\n\nShould one accept revelation without using reason to judge whether it\nis genuine revelation or not, one gets what Locke calls a third\nprinciple of assent besides reason and revelation, namely enthusiasm.\nEnthusiasm is a vain or unfounded confidence in divine favor or\ncommunication. It implies that there is no need to use reason to judge\nwhether such favor or communication is genuine or not. Clearly when\nsuch communications are not genuine they are \u201cthe ungrounded\nFancies of a Man\u2019s own Brain\u201d (IV.19.2, N: 698). This kind\nof enthusiasm was characteristic of Protestant extremists going back\nto the era of the civil war. Locke was not alone in rejecting\nenthusiasm, but he rejects it in the strongest terms. Enthusiasm\nviolates the fundamental principle by which the understanding\noperates\u2014that assent be proportioned to the evidence. To abandon\nthat fundamental principle would be catastrophic. This is a point that\nLocke also makes in The Conduct of the Understanding and\nThe Reasonableness of Christianity. Locke wants each of us to\nuse our understanding to search after truth. Of enthusiasts, those who\nwould abandon reason and claim to know on the basis of faith alone,\nLocke writes:\n\n\n\u2026he that takes away Reason to make way for Revelation, puts out\nthe Light of both, and does much what the same, as if he would\nperswade a Man to put out his eyes, the better to receive the remote\nLight of an invisible Star by a Telescope. (IV.19.4, N: 698)\n\n\nRather than engage in the tedious labor required to reason correctly\nto judge of the genuineness of their revelation, enthusiasts persuade\nthemselves that they are possessed of immediate revelation. This leads\nto \u201codd Opinions and extravagant actions\u201d that are\ncharacteristic of enthusiasm and which should warn that this is a\nwrong principle. Thus, Locke strongly rejects any attempt to make\ninward persuasion not judged by reason a legitimate principle.\n\nWe turn now to a consideration of Locke\u2019s educational works.\n3. Locke\u2019s Major Works on Education\n\nLocke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning Education and his\nConduct of the Understanding form a nice bridge between\nAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his political\nworks. Ruth Grant and Nathan Tarcov write in the introduction to their\nedition of these works:\n\n\nThe idea of liberty, so crucial to all of Locke\u2019s writings on\npolitics and education, is traced in the Essay to reflection on the\npower of the mind over one\u2019s own actions, especially the power\nto suspend actions in the pursuit of the satisfaction of one\u2019s\nown desires until after a full consideration of their objects\n(II.21.47, N: 51\u201352). The Essay thus shows how the independence\nof mind pursued in the Conduct is possible. (G&T 1996:\nxvi)\n\n\nSome Thoughts Concerning Education was first published in\n1693. This book collected together advice that Locke had been giving\nhis friend Edward Clarke about the education of Clarke\u2019s son\n(and also his daughters) since 1684. In preparing the revision for the\nfourth edition of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke began writing a chapter called \u201cThe Conduct of the\nUnderstanding\u201d. This became quite long and was never added to\nthe Essay or even finished. It was left to Locke\u2019s\nliterary executors to decide what to do with it. The Conduct\nwas published by Peter King in his posthumous edition of some of\nLocke\u2019s works in 1706. As Locke was composing these works, some\nof the material from the Conduct eventually made its way into\nthe Thoughts. Grant and Tarcov write that the\nThoughts and the Conduct \u201ccomplement each\nother well: the Thoughts focuses on the education of children\nby their parents, whereas the Conduct addresses the\nself-education of adults\u201d (G&T 1996: vii). Though they also\nnote tensions between the two that illustrate paradoxes in liberal\nsociety. The Thoughts is addressed to the education of the\nsons and daughters of the English gentry in the late seventeenth\ncentury. It is in some ways thus significantly more limited to its\ntime and place than the Conduct. Yet, its insistence on the\ninculcating such virtues as\n\n\njustice as respect for the rights of others, civility, liberality,\nhumanity, self-denial, industry, thrift, courage, truthfulness, and a\nwillingness to question prejudice, authority and the biases of\none\u2019s own self-interest\n\n\nvery likely represents the qualities needed for citizens in a liberal\nsociety (G&T 1996: xiii).\n\nLocke\u2019s Thoughts represents the culmination of a\ncentury of what has been called \u201cthe discovery of the\nchild\u201d. In the Middle Ages the child was regarded as\n\n\nonly a simple plaything, as a simple animal, or a miniature adult who\ndressed, played and was supposed to act like his elders\u2026Their\nages were unimportant and therefore seldom known. Their education was\nundifferentiated, either by age, ability or intended occupation.\n(Axtell 1968: 63\u20134)\n\n\nLocke treated children as human beings in whom the gradual development\nof rationality needed to be fostered by parents. Locke urged parents\nto spend time with their children and tailor their education to their\ncharacter and idiosyncrasies, to develop both a sound body and\ncharacter, and to make play the chief strategy for learning rather\nthan rote learning or punishment. Thus, he urged learning languages by\nlearning to converse in them before learning rules of grammar. Locke\nalso suggests that the child learn at least one manual trade.\n\nIn advocating a kind of education that made people who think for\nthemselves, Locke was preparing people to effectively make decisions\nin their own lives\u2014to engage in individual\nself-government\u2014and to participate in the government of their\ncountry. The Conduct reveals the connections Locke sees\nbetween reason, freedom and morality. Reason is required for good\nself-government because reason insofar as it is free from partiality,\nintolerance and passion and able to question authority leads to fair\njudgment and action. We thus have a responsibility to cultivate reason\nin order to avoid the moral failings of passion, partiality and so\nforth (G&T 1996: xii). This is, in Tarcov\u2019s phrase,\nLocke\u2019s education for liberty.\n\nWe turn now to Locke\u2019s political writings. (See the entry on\n Locke\u2019s political philosophy,\n which focuses on five topics (the state of nature, natural law,\nproperty, consent and toleration) and goes into these topics in more\ndepth than is possible in a general account and provides much useful\ninformation on the debates about them.)\n4. The Two Treatises Of Government\n\nLord Shaftsbury had been dismissed from his post as Lord Chancellor in\n1673 and had become one of the leaders of the opposition party, the\nCountry Party. In 1679 the chief issue was the attempt by the Country\nParty leaders to exclude James, Duke of York from succeeding his\nbrother Charles II to the throne. They wanted to do this because James\nwas a Catholic, and England by this time was a firmly Protestant\ncountry. They had acquired a majority in the House of Commons through\nserious grass roots election campaigns, and passed an exclusion bill,\nbut given the King\u2019s unwillingness to see his brother excluded\nfrom the throne, the bill failed in the House of Lords. They tried a\ncouple of more times without success. Having failed by parliamentary\nmeans, some of the Country Party leaders started plotting armed\nrebellion.\n\nThe Two Treatises of Government were published in 1689, long\nafter the rebellion plotted by the Country party leaders had failed to\nmaterialize and after Shaftsbury had fled the country for Holland and\ndied. The introduction of the Two Treatises was written after\nthe Glorious Revolution of 1688, and gave the impression that the book\nwas written to justify the Glorious Revolution. We now know that the\nTwo Treatises of Government were written during the Exclusion\ncrisis in 1681 and may have been intended in part to justify the\ngeneral armed rising which the Country Party leaders were\nplanning.\n\nThere were serious obstacles to a rebellion to force James\u2019\nexclusion from the throne. The English Anglican gentry needed to\nsupport such an action. But the Anglican church from childhood on\ntaught that: \u201c\u2026men\u2019s political duties were\nexhaustively determined by their terrestrial superiors, that under\ngrave conscientious scruples they might rightly decline to carry out\nthose decrees of authority which were in direct breach of divine law,\nthey could under no circumstances have a right to resist such\nauthority\u201d. (Dunn, 1968, 48) Since by 1679 it was abundantly\nclear that the King opposed excluding his brother from the throne, to\nfavor exclusion implied \u201cexplicit and self-conscious resistance\nto the sovereign\u201d. Passive resistance would simply not do. On\nthe other hand, the royal policy \u201coutraged their deepest\nreligious prejudices and stimulated their most obscure emotional\nanxieties.\u201d So, the gentry were deeply conflicted and neither of\nthe choices available to them looked very palatable. John Dunn goes on\nto remark: \u201cTo exert influence upon their choice it was above\nall necessary to present a more coherent ordering of their values, to\nshow that the political tradition within which the dissenters saw\ntheir conduct was not necessarily empirically absurd or socially\nsubversive. The gentry had to be persuaded that there could be reason\nfor rebellion which could make it neither blasphemous or\nsuicidal.\u201d (Dunn, 1968, 49) To achieve this goal Locke picked\nthe most relevant and extreme of the supporters of the divine right of\nKings to attack. Sir Robert Filmer (c 1588\u20131653), a man of the\ngeneration of Charles I and the English Civil War, who had defended\nthe crown in various works. His most famous work, however,\nPatriarcha, was published posthumously in 1680 and\nrepresented the most complete and coherent exposition of the view\nLocke wished to deny. Filmer held that men were born into helpless\nservitude to an authoritarian family, a social hierarchy and a\nsovereign whose only constraint was his relationship with God. Under\nthese circumstances, anything other than passive obedience would be\n\u201cvicious, blasphemous and intellectually absurd.\u201d So,\nLocke needed to refute Filmer and in Dunn\u2019s words: \u201crescue\nthe contractarian account of political obligation from the criticism\nof impiety and absurdity. Only in this way could he restore to the\nAnglican gentry a coherent basis for moral autonomy or a practical\ninitiative in the field of politics.\u201d (Dunn, 1968, 50)\n\nThe First Treatise of Government is a polemical work aimed at\nrefuting the theological basis for the patriarchal version of the\nDivine Right of Kings doctrine put forth by Sir Robert Filmer. Locke\nsingles out Filmer\u2019s contention that men are not\n\u201cnaturally free\u201d as the key issue, for that is the\n\u201cground\u201d or premise on which Filmer erects his argument\nfor the claim that all \u201clegitimate\u201d government is\n\u201cabsolute monarchy\u201d\u2014kings being descended from the\nfirst man, Adam, and their subjects being naturally slaves. Early in\nthe First Treatise Locke denies that either scripture or\nreason supports Filmer\u2019s premise or arguments. In what follows\nin the First Treatise, Locke minutely examines key Biblical\npassages.\n\nWhile The Second Treatise of Government provides\nLocke\u2019s positive theory of government, it also continues his\nargument against Sir Robert Filmer\u2019s claims that monarchs\nlegitimately hold absolute power over their subjects. Locke holds that\nFilmer\u2019s view is sufficiently incoherent to lead to governments\nbeing established by force and violence. Thus, Locke claims he must\nprovide an alternative account of the origin of government \u201clest\nmen fall into the dangerous belief that all government in the world is\nmerely the product of force and violence\u201d (Treatises\nII,1,4). Locke\u2019s account involves several devices which were\ncommon in seventeenth and eighteenth century political\nphilosophy\u2014natural rights theory and the social contract.\nNatural rights are those rights which we are supposed to have as human\nbeings before ever government comes into being. We might suppose, that\nlike other animals, we have a natural right to struggle for our\nsurvival. Locke will argue that we have a right to the means to\nsurvive. When Locke comes to explain how government comes into being,\nhe uses the idea that people agree that their condition in the state\nof nature is unsatisfactory, and so agree to transfer some of their\nrights to a central government, while retaining others. This is the\ntheory of the social contract. There are many versions of natural\nrights theory and the social contract in seventeenth and eighteenth\ncentury European political philosophy, some conservative and some\nradical. Locke\u2019s version belongs on the radical side of the\nspectrum. These radical natural right theories influenced the\nideologies of the American and French revolutions.\n\nLocke\u2019s strategy for refuting Filmer\u2019s claims that\nmonarchs have absolute power over their subjects is to show that\nFilmer is conflating a whole variety of limited powers, all of which\nmight be held by one man and thus give the false appearance that a\nking has absolute power over wives, children, servants and slaves as\nwell as subjects of a commonwealth. When properly distinguished,\nhowever, and the limitations of each displayed, it becomes clear that\nmonarchs have no legitimate absolute power over their subjects.\n4.1 The Second Treatise of Government\n\nAn important part of Locke\u2019s project in the Second\nTreatise is to figure out what the role of legitimate government\nis, thus allowing him to distinguish the nature of illegitimate\ngovernment. Once this is done, the basis for legitimate revolution\nbecomes clear. Figuring out what the proper or legitimate role of\ncivil government is would be a difficult task indeed if one were to\nexamine the vast complexity of existing governments. How should one\nproceed? One strategy is to consider what life is like in the absence\nof civil government. Presumably this is a simpler state, one which may\nbe easier to understand. Then one might see what role civil government\nought to play. This is the strategy which Locke pursues, following\nHobbes and others. So, in the first chapter of the Second\nTreatise Locke defines political power.\n\n\nPolitical power, then, I take to be a right of\nmaking laws with penalties of death, and consequently all less\npenalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of\nemploying the force of the community, in the execution of such laws,\nand in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign injury; and all\nthis only for the public good. (Treatises, II, 1,3)\n\n\nIn the second chapter of The Second Treatise Locke describes\nthe state in which there is no government with real political power.\nThis is the state of nature. It is sometimes assumed that the state of\nnature is a state in which there is no government at all. This is only\npartially true. It is possible to have in the state of nature either\nno government, illegitimate government, or legitimate government with\nless than full political power. (See the section on the\n state of nature\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy.)\n\nIf we consider the state of nature before there was government, it is\na state of political equality in which there is no natural superior or\ninferior. From this equality flows the obligation to mutual love and\nthe duties that people owe one another, and the great maxims of\njustice and charity. Was there ever such a state? There has been\nconsiderable debate about this. Still, it is plain that both Hobbes\nand Locke would answer this question affirmatively. Whenever people\nhave not agreed to establish a common political authority, they remain\nin the state of nature. It\u2019s like saying that people are in the\nstate of being naturally single until they are married. Locke clearly\nthinks one can find the state of nature in his time at least in the\n\u201cinland, vacant places of America\u201d (Second\nTreatise V. 36) and in the relations between different peoples.\nPerhaps the historical development of states also went though the\nstages of a state of nature. An alternative possibility is that the\nstate of nature is not a real historical state, but rather a\ntheoretical construct, intended to help determine the proper function\nof government. If one rejects the historicity of states of nature, one\nmay still find them a useful analytical device. For Locke, it is very\nlikely both.\n4.2 Human Nature and God\u2019s Purposes\n\nAccording to Locke, God created man and we are, in effect, God\u2019s\nproperty. The chief end set us by our creator as a species and as\nindividuals is survival. A wise and omnipotent God, having made people\nand sent them into this world:\n\n\n\u2026by his order and about his business, they are his property\nwhose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one\nanother\u2019s pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties,\nsharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any\nsubordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another,\nas if we were made for one another\u2019s uses, as the inferior ranks\nof creatures are for our\u2019s. (Treatises II,2,6)\n\n\nIt follows immediately that \u201che has no liberty to destroy\nhimself, or so much as any creature in his possession, yet when some\nnobler use than its bare possession calls for it\u201d\n(Treatises II.2.6). So, murder and suicide violate the divine\npurpose.\n\nIf one takes survival as the end, then we may ask what are the means\nnecessary to that end. On Locke\u2019s account, these turn out to be\nlife, liberty, health and property. Since the end is set by God, on\nLocke\u2019s view we have a right to the means to that end. So we\nhave rights to life, liberty, health and property. These are natural\nrights, that is they are rights that we have in a state of nature\nbefore the introduction of civil government, and all people have these\nrights equally.\n\nThere is also a law of nature. It is the Golden Rule, interpreted in\nterms of natural rights. Thus Locke writes:\n\n\nThe state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges\neveryone: and reason which is that law, teaches all mankind who will\nbut consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to\nharm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions\u2026.\n(Treatises II.2.6)\n\n\nLocke tells us that the law of nature is revealed by reason. Locke\nmakes the point about the law that it commands what is best for us. If\nit did not, he says, the law would vanish for it would not be obeyed.\nIt is in this sense that Locke means that reason reveals the law. If\nyou reflect on what is best for yourself and others, given the goal of\nsurvival and our natural equality, you will come to this conclusion.\n(See the section on\n the law of nature\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s Political Philosophy.)\n\nLocke does not intend his account of the state of nature as a sort of\nutopia. Rather it serves as an analytical device that explains why it\nbecomes necessary to introduce civil government and what the\nlegitimate function of civil government is. Thus, as Locke conceives\nit, there are problems with life in the state of nature. The law of\nnature, like civil laws can be violated. There are no police,\nprosecutors or judges in the state of nature as these are all\nrepresentatives of a government with full political power. The\nvictims, then, must enforce the law of nature in the state of nature.\nIn addition to our other rights in the state of nature, we have the\nrights to enforce the law and to judge on our own behalf. We may,\nLocke tells us, help one another. We may intervene in cases where our\nown interests are not directly under threat to help enforce the law of\nnature. This right eventually serves as the justification for\nlegitimate rebellion. Still, in the state of nature, the person who is\nmost likely to enforce the law under these circumstances is the person\nwho has been wronged. The basic principle of justice is that the\npunishment should be proportionate to the crime. But when the victims\nare judging the seriousness of the crime, they are more likely to\njudge it of greater severity than might an impartial judge. As a\nresult, there will be regular miscarriages of justice. This is perhaps\nthe most important problem with the state of nature.\n4.3 Of War and Slavery\n\nIn chapters 3 and 4, Locke defines the states of war and slavery. The\nstate of war is a state in which someone has a sedate and settled\nintention of violating someone\u2019s right to life (and thus all\ntheir other rights). Such a person puts themselves into a state of war\nwith the person whose life they intend to take. In such a war the\nperson who intends to violate someone\u2019s right to life is an\nunjust aggressor. This is not the normal relationship between people\nenjoined by the law of nature in the state of nature. Locke is\ndistancing himself from Hobbes who had made the state of nature and\nthe state of war equivalent terms. For Locke, the state of nature is\nordinarily one in which we follow the Golden Rule interpreted in terms\nof natural rights, and thus love our fellow human creatures. The state\nof war only comes about when someone proposes to violate someone\nelse\u2019s rights. Thus, on Locke\u2019s theory of war, there will\nalways be an innocent victim on one side and an unjust aggressor on\nthe other.\n\nSlavery is the state of being in the absolute or arbitrary power of\nanother. On Locke\u2019s definition of slavery, there is only one\nrather remarkable way to become a legitimate slave. In order to do so,\none must be an unjust aggressor defeated in war. The just victor then\nhas the option to either kill the aggressor or enslave them. Locke\ntells us that the state of slavery is the continuation of the state of\nwar between a lawful conqueror and a captive, in which the conqueror\ndelays taking the life of the captive, and instead makes use of him.\nThis is a continued war because if conqueror and captive make some\ncompact for obedience on the one side and limited power on the other,\nthe state of slavery ceases and becomes a relation between a master\nand a servant in which the master only has limited power over his\nservant. The reason that slavery ceases with the compact is that\n\u201cno man, can, by agreement pass over to another that which he\nhath not in himself, a power over his own life\u201d\n(Treatises II.4.24). Legitimate slavery is an important\nconcept in Locke\u2019s political philosophy largely because it tells\nus what the legitimate extent of despotic power is and defines and\nilluminates by contrast the nature of illegitimate slavery.\nIllegitimate slavery is that state in which someone possesses absolute\nor despotic power over someone else without just cause. Locke holds\nthat it is this illegitimate state of slavery which absolute monarchs\nwish to impose upon their subjects. It is very likely for this reason\nthat legitimate slavery is so narrowly defined. This shows that the\nchapter on slavery plays a crucial role in Locke\u2019s argument\nagainst Sir Robert Filmer and thus could not have been easily\ndispensed with. Still, it is possible that Locke had an additional\npurpose or perhaps a quite different reason for writing about\nslavery.\n\nThere has been a steady stream of articles and books over the last\nsixty years arguing that given Locke\u2019s involvement with trade\nand colonial government, the theory of slavery in the Second\nTreatise was intended to justify the institutions and practices\nof Afro-American slavery. If this were the case, Locke\u2019s\nphilosophy would not contradict his actions as an investor and\ncolonial administrator. However, there are strong objections to this\nview. Had he intended to justify Afro-American slavery, Locke would\nhave done much better with a vastly more inclusive definition of\nlegitimate slavery than the one he gives. It is sometimes suggested\nthat Locke\u2019s account of \u201cjust war\u201d is so vague that\nit could easily be twisted to justify the institutions and practices\nof Afro-American slavery. This, however, is also not the case. In the\nchapter \u201cOf Conquest\u201d Locke explicitly lists the limits of\nthe legitimate power of conquerors. These limits on who can become a\nlegitimate slave and what the powers of a just conqueror are ensure\nthat this theory of conquest and slavery would condemn the\ninstitutions and practices of Afro-American slavery in the\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Nonetheless, the\ndebate continues. One element of the debate has to do with\nLocke\u2019s role in the writing of the Fundamental Constitutions\nof the Carolinas. David Armitage in his 2004 article \u201cJohn\nLocke, Carolina and the Two Treatises of Government\u201d argues that\nLocke was involved in a revision of the Fundamental Constitution\nof the Carolinas at the very time he was writing The Two\nTreatises of Government. The provision that \u201cEvery Freedman\nof the Carolinas has absolute power and authority over his negro\nslaves\u201d remained in the document unchanged. In his 2016 book\nThe Ashley Cooper Plan, Thomas Wilson gives a detailed\naccount of Ashley Cooper\u2019s intentions for the Carolina colony\nand how Cooper\u2019s intent was thwarted by Barbadian slave owners\nwho changed Carolina society from a society with slaves to a slave\nsociety. L. H. Roper, in his 2004 book Conceiving Carolina:\nProperty, Planters and Plots 1662\u20131729, offers a different\naccount of what went wrong, focusing on conflicts over the trade in\nIndian slaves. James Farr\u2019s article \u201cLocke, Natural Law\nand New World Slavery\u201d (2008) is one of the best statements of\nthe position that Locke intended his theory of slavery to apply to\nEnglish absolutism and not Afro-American slavery while noting that\nLocke\u2019s involvement with slavery has ruined his reputation as\nthe great champion of liberty Roger Woolhouse in his recent biography\nof Locke (Woolhouse 2007: 187) remarks that \u201cThough there is no\nconsensus on the whole question, there certainly seems to be \u2018a\nglaring contradiction between his theories and Afro-American\nslavery\u2019\u201d.\n\nRecently, there has been a debate over whose theory of slavery and\nabsolutism Locke was attacking. Johan Olsthoorn and Laurens van\nApeldoorn (2020) argue that Locke\u2019s account of slavery and in\nparticular, that no person can consensually establish absolute rule\nover themselves with all its consequences has little force against\nother classical contract theories, in particular those of Grotius and\nPuffendorf. Both Grotius and Puffendorf defended both absolutism and\ncolonial slavery.\n\nFelis Waldmann in \u201cSlavery and Absolutism in Locke\u2019s Two\nTreatises: A Response to Olsthoorn and van Apeldoorn\u201d objects to\na number of their claims finding others not relevant. Most\nnotably, he objects to these claims: First, \u201cLocke is working\nwith an idiosyncratic conception of slavery and absolute rule\nrepudiated by prominent early modern thinkers defending political\nabsolutism.\u201d Second: \u201cLike Filmer, Locke maintains that\nabsolute rulers may arbitrarily kill and maim their subjects at will,\nby dint of having a dominium in the latter\u2019s\nlives.\u201d Finally, he objects to the claim that: \u201cEarly\nmodern natural lawyers, from Grotius onward, conceptualized slavery\nrather differently, insisting that enslaved people were not\nowned in the way we own things (which may be destroyed at\nwill)\u201d (Waldmann 7).\n\nIn brief, Waldmann\u2019s response to the first claim is that Filmer\naccurately represented the Royalist position in the late 1670s and\nearly 1680s and so Locke\u2019s account is not a straw man. Thus,\nLocke is attacking Filmer\u2019s account of slavery and not some weak\nand extreme version of the argument for absolutism that no one\nheld. Waldmann suggests that the second claim magnifies this tendency\nof the two authors\u2019 portrayal of Locke\u2019s argument as not\nresponding to the standard arguments for absolutism. Thus, Olsthoorn\nand van Apeldoorn attribute Filmer\u2019s position to Locke. Waldmann\nconcludes that the claims of Olsthoorn and van Apeldoorn that since\nLocke\u2019s position on slavery was significantly different from\nthose of Grotius and Puffendorf, it had little force against them is,\nin fact, the case.  But he thinks this is of little importance since\nLocke was not arguing against them. One suggestion he considers\nplausible is that Locke is aiming his argument against the possibility\nof self-enslavement at Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes was recognized by his\ncontemporaries as asserting both that one could by contract enslave\noneself and that the king had dominium, over his\nsubjects.\n\nWilliam Uzgalis, in his 2017 chapter \u201cJohn Locke, Slavery and\nIndian Lands,\u201d holds that Locke has two theories of slavery, one\nof them of legitimate slavery and the other of illegitimate\nslavery. Note that the authors discussed above simply\ndon\u2019t make this distinction. If they had, it would be\nplain that while Locke shares with Filmer the dominium\nconception of slavery that allows a master to kill or maim a slave,\nneither theory belongs to Filmer, and if Locke is correct about royal\nabsolutism and given the character of the practices of the slave\ntrade and colonial slavery, both absolutism at home and the slave\ntrade and colonial slavery fall under the theory of illegitimate\nslavery. Neither Grotius, Puffendorf or Hobbes has an explicit\ntheory of illegitimate slavery. Uzgalis also notes that Grotius and\nPuffendorf provided claims that Locke could have adopted had he wished\nto justify the slave trade and slavery in the colonies. Still, he\ndenies them all, and with good reason. He would have\nsubstantially weakened his argument against the kind of absolutism he\nattributed to Filmer and the Stuarts had he done so. This\nsuggests that he was crafting an alternative theory and not arguing\nagainst its competitors, with the exception, perhaps, of Hobbes.\n\nHolly Brewer in her 2017 article \u201cSlavery, Sovereignty, and\n\u2018Inheritable Blood\u2019, Reconsidering John Locke and the\nOrigins of American Slavery\u201d argues for a different approach\nto these questions. She presents evidence that the Stuart\nkings, and Charles II and his brother James, Duke of York, in\nparticular, were not just interested in absolute government at home;\nthey actively promoted the Royal Africa Company, the slave trade and\nslavery in the colonies as it provided considerable amounts of money\nto the royal coffers. James was the Governor (the President) of the\nRoyal Africa Company and Admiral of the English fleet. Lord\nShaftesbury, Locke\u2019s patron, was the sub-governor, and Locke\nassisted him. Using the fleet, James attacked and captured Dutch forts\non the coast of Africa to make bases for the Royal Africa Company and\ndeprive the Dutch of them. The Stuarts minted guinea coins to\ncelebrate these efforts. After becoming King, James continued as\nGovernor of the Royal Africa Company. Thus Brewer underlines the\nsimilarities and connections between the absolutism Locke objected to\nat home and the slave trade and slavery in the colonies. She argues\nthat the spread of slavery needs to be understood as an English\nimperial policy and not something that occurred in different times and\nplaces unconnected with one another. She also claims that while Locke\nwas a member of King William III\u2019s Board of Trade in the waning\nyears of the seventeenth century, he sought to undo Stuart policies\nconcerning slavery in the colonies.\n4.4 Of Property\n\nChapter 5 \u201cOf Property\u201d is one of the most famous,\ninfluential and important chapters in the Second Treatise of\nGovernment. Indeed, some of the most controversial issues about\nthe Second Treatise come from varying interpretations of it.\nIn this chapter Locke, in effect, describes the evolution of the state\nof nature to the point where it becomes expedient for those in it to\nfound a civil government. So, it is not only an account of the nature\nand origin of private property but leads up to the explanation of why\ncivil government replaces the state of nature (see the section on\n property\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy).\n\nIn discussing the origin of private property Locke begins by noting\nthat God gave the earth to all men in common. Thus there is a question\nabout how private property comes to be. Locke finds it a serious\ndifficulty. He points out, however, that we are supposed to make use\nof the earth \u201cfor the best advantage of life and\nconvenience\u201d (Treatises II.5.25). What then is the\nmeans to appropriate property from the common store? Locke argues that\nprivate property does not come about by universal consent. If one had\nto go about and ask everyone if one could eat these berries, one would\nstarve to death before getting everyone\u2019s agreement. Locke holds\nthat we have property in our own person. And the labor of our body and\nthe work of our hands properly belong to us. So, when one picks up\nacorns or berries, they thereby belong to the person who picked them\nup. There has been some controversy about what Locke means by\n\u201clabor\u201d. Daniel Russell claims that for Locke, labor is a\ngoal-directed activity that converts materials that might meet our\nneeds into resources that actually do (Russell 2004). This\ninterpretation of what Locke means by \u201clabor\u201d connects\nnicely with his claim that we have a natural law obligation first to\npreserve ourselves and then to help in the preservation and\nflourishing of others.\n\nOne might think that one could then acquire as much as one wished, but\nthis is not the case. Locke introduces at least two important\nqualifications on how much property can be acquired. The first\nqualification has to do with waste. Locke writes:\n\n\nAs much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it\nspoils, so much by his labor he may fix a property in; whatever is\nbeyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others.\n(Treatises II.5.31)\n\n\nSince originally, populations were small and resources great, living\nwithin the bounds set by reason, there would be little quarrel or\ncontention over property, for a single man could make use of only a\nvery small part of what was available.\n\nNote that Locke has, thus far, been talking about hunting and\ngathering, and the kinds of limitations which reason imposes on the\nkind of property that hunters and gatherers hold. In the next section\nhe turns to agriculture and the ownership of land and the kinds of\nlimitations there are on that kind of property. In effect, we see the\nevolution of the state of nature from a hunter/gatherer kind of\nsociety to that of a farming and agricultural society. Once again it\nis labor which imposes limitations upon how much land can be enclosed.\nIt is only as much as one can work. But there is an additional\nqualification. Locke says:\n\n\nNor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by\nimproving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still\nenough, and as good left; and more than the as yet unprovided could\nuse. So that, in effect, there was never the less for others because\nof his inclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another\ncan make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could\nconsider himself injured by the drinking of another man, though he\ntook a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left to\nquench his thirst: and the case of land and water, where there is\nenough, is perfectly the same. (Treatises II.5.33)\n\n\nThe next stage in the evolution of the state of nature involves the\nintroduction of money. Locke remarks that:\n\n\n\u2026 before the desire of having more than one needed had altered\nthe intrinsic value of things, which depends only on their usefulness\nto the life of man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow\nmetal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a\ngreat piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men had a right\nto appropriate by their labor, each one of himself, as much of the\nthings of nature, as he could use; yet this could not be much, nor to\nthe prejudice of others, where the same plenty was left to those who\nwould use the same industry. (Treatises II.5.37)\n\n\nSo, before the introduction of money, there was a degree of economic\nequality imposed on mankind both by reason and the barter system. And\nmen were largely confined to the satisfaction of their needs and\nconveniences. Most of the necessities of life are relatively short\nlived\u2014berries, plums, venison and so forth. One could reasonably\nbarter one\u2019s berries for nuts which would last not weeks but\nperhaps a whole year. And says Locke:\n\n\n\u2026if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with\nits color, or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling\npebble or diamond, and keep those by him all his life, he invaded not\nthe right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things\nas he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his property not lying\nin the largeness of his possessions, but the perishing of anything\nuselessly in it. (Treatises II.5.146)\n\n\nThe introduction of money is necessary for the differential increase\nin property, with resulting economic inequality. Without money there\nwould be no point in going beyond the economic equality of the earlier\nstage. In a money economy, different degrees of industry could give\nmen vastly different proportions.\n\n\nThis partage of things in an inequality of private possessions, men\nhave made practicable out of the bounds of society, and without\ncompact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly\nagreeing to the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate\nthe rights of property, and the possession of land is determined by\npositive constitutions. (Treatises II.5.50)\n\n\nThe implication is that it is the introduction of money, which causes\ninequality, which in turn multiplies the causes of quarrels and\ncontentions and increased numbers of violations of the law of nature.\nThis leads to the decision to create a civil government. Before\nturning to the institution of civil government, however, we should ask\nwhat happens to the qualifications on the acquisition of property\nafter the advent of money? One answer proposed by C. B. Macpherson in\nThe Political Theory of Possessive Individualism is that the\nqualifications are completely set aside, and we now have a system for\nthe unlimited acquisition of private property. This does not seem to\nbe correct. It seems plain, rather, that at least the non-spoilage\nqualification is satisfied, because money does not spoil. The other\nqualifications may be rendered somewhat irrelevant by the advent of\nthe conventions about property adopted in civil society. This leaves\nopen the question of whether Locke approved of these changes.\nMacpherson, who takes Locke to be a spokesman for a proto-capitalist\nsystem, sees Locke as advocating the unlimited acquisition of wealth.\nJames Tully, on the other side, in A Discourse of Property\nholds that Locke sees the new conditions, the change in values and the\neconomic inequality which arise as a result of the advent of money, as\nthe fall of man. Tully sees Locke as a persistent and powerful critic\nof self-interest. This remarkable difference in interpretation has\nbeen a significant topic for debates among scholars over the last\nforty years. Though the Second Treatise of Government may\nleave this question difficult to determine, one might consider\nLocke\u2019s remark in Some Thoughts Concerning Education\nthat\n\n\nCovetousness and the desire to having in our possession and our\ndominion more than we have need of, being the root of all evil, should\nbe early and carefully weeded out and the contrary quality of being\nready to impart to others inculcated. (G&T 1996: 81)\n\n\nLet us then turn to the institution of civil government.\n4.5 The Social Contract Theory\n\nJust as natural rights and natural law theory had a fluorescence in\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth century, so did the social contract\ntheory. Why is Locke a social contract theorist? Is it merely that\nthis was one prevailing way of thinking about government at the time\nwhich Locke blindly adopted? The answer is that there is something\nabout Locke\u2019s project which pushes him strongly in the direction\nof the social contract. One might hold that governments were\noriginally instituted by force, and that no agreement was involved.\nWere Locke to adopt this view, he would be forced to go back on many\nof the things which are at the heart of his project in the Second\nTreatise, though cases like the Norman conquest force him to\nadmit that citizens may come to accept a government that was\noriginally forced on them. Remember that the Second Treatise\nprovides Locke\u2019s positive theory of government, and that he\nexplicitly says that he must provide an alternative to the view\n\n\nthat all government in the world is merely the product of force and\nviolence, and that men live together by no other rules than that of\nthe beasts, where the strongest carries it \u2026 .\n(Treatises II, 1, 4)\n\n\nSo, while Locke might admit that some governments come about through\nforce or violence, he would be destroying the most central and vital\ndistinction, that between legitimate and illegitimate civil\ngovernment, if he admitted that legitimate government can come about\nin this way. So, for Locke, legitimate government is instituted by the\nexplicit consent of those governed. (See the section on\n consent, political obligation, and the ends of government\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s political philosophy.) Those who make\nthis agreement transfer to the government their right of executing the\nlaw of nature and judging their own case. These are the powers which\nthey give to the central government, and this is what makes the\njustice system of governments a legitimate function of such\ngovernments.\n\nRuth Grant has persuasively argued that the establishment of\ngovernment is in effect a two step process. Universal consent is\nnecessary to form a political community. Consent to join a community\nonce given is binding and cannot be withdrawn. This makes political\ncommunities stable. Grant writes: \u201cHaving established that the\nmembership in a community entails the obligation to abide by the will\nof the community, the question remains: Who rules?\u201d (1987:\n114\u2013115). The answer to this question is determined by majority\nrule. The point is that universal consent is necessary to establish a\npolitical community, majority consent to answer the question who is to\nrule such a community. Universal consent and majority consent are thus\ndifferent in kind, not just in degree. Grant writes:\n\n\nLocke\u2019s argument for the right of the majority is the\ntheoretical ground for the distinction between duty to society and\nduty to government, the distinction that permits an argument for\nresistance without anarchy. When the designated government dissolves,\nmen remain obligated to society acting through majority rule. (1987:\n119)\n\n\nIt is entirely possible for the majority to confer the rule of the\ncommunity on a king and his heirs, or a group of oligarchs or on a\ndemocratic assembly. Thus, the social contract is not inextricably\nlinked to democracy. Still, a government of any kind must perform the\nlegitimate function of a civil government.\n4.6 The Function Of Civil Government\n\nLocke is now in a position to explain the function of a legitimate\ngovernment and distinguish it from illegitimate government. The aim of\nsuch a legitimate government is to preserve, so far as possible, the\nrights to life, liberty, health and property of its citizens, and to\nprosecute and punish those of its citizens who violate the rights of\nothers and to pursue the public good even where this may conflict with\nthe rights of individuals. In doing this it provides something\nunavailable in the state of nature, an impartial judge to determine\nthe severity of the crime, and to set a punishment proportionate to\nthe crime. This is one of the main reasons why civil society is an\nimprovement on the state of nature. An illegitimate government will\nfail to protect the rights to life, liberty, health and property of\nits subjects, and in the worst cases, such an illegitimate government\nwill claim to be able to violate the rights of its subjects, that is\nit will claim to have despotic power over its subjects. Since Locke is\narguing against the position of Sir Robert Filmer who held that\npatriarchal power and political power are the same, and that in effect\nthese amount to despotic power, Locke is at pains to distinguish these\nthree forms of power, and to show that they are not equivalent. Thus\nat the beginning of chapter 15 \u201cOf Paternal, Political and\nDespotic Power Considered Together\u201d he writes:\n\n\nTHOUGH I have had occasion to speak of these before, yet the great\nmistakes of late about government, having as I suppose arisen from\nconfounding these distinct powers one with another, it may not be\namiss, to consider them together.\n\n\nChapters 6 and 7 give Locke\u2019s account of paternal and political\npower respectively. Paternal power is limited. It lasts only through\nthe minority of children, and has other limitations. Political power,\nderived as it is from the transfer of the power of individuals to\nenforce the law of nature, has with it the right to kill in the\ninterest of preserving the rights of the citizens or otherwise\nsupporting the public good. Legitimate despotic power, by contrast,\nimplies the right to take the life, liberty, health and at least some\nof the property of any person subject to such a power.\n4.7 Rebellion and Regicide\n\nAt the end of the Second Treatise we learn about the nature\nof illegitimate civil governments and the conditions under which\nrebellion and regicide are legitimate and appropriate. As noted above,\nscholars now hold that the book was written during the Exclusion\nCrisis, and may have been written to justify a general insurrection\nand the assassination of the king of England and his brother. The\nargument for legitimate revolution follows from making the distinction\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate civil government. A legitimate\ncivil government seeks to preserve its subjects\u2019 life, health,\nliberty, and property insofar as this is compatible with the public\ngood. Because it does this, it deserves obedience. An illegitimate\ncivil government seeks to systematically violate the natural rights of\nits subjects. It seeks to make them illegitimate slaves. Because an\nillegitimate civil government does this, it puts itself in a state of\nnature and a state of war with its subjects. The magistrate or king of\nsuch a state violates the law of nature and so makes himself into a\ndangerous beast of prey who operates on the principle that might makes\nright, or that the strongest carries it. In such circumstances,\nrebellion is legitimate, as is the killing of such a dangerous beast\nof prey. Thus Locke justifies rebellion and regicide under certain\ncircumstances. Presumably, this justification was going to be offered\nfor the killing of the King of England and his brother had the Rye\nHouse Plot succeeded. Even if this was not Locke\u2019s intention, it\nstill would have served that purpose admirably.\n5. Locke and Religious Toleration\n\nThe issue of religious toleration was of widespread interest in Europe\nin the seventeenth century, largely because religious intolerance with\naccompanying violence was so pervasive. The Reformation had split\nEurope into competing religious camps, and this provoked civil wars\nand massive religious persecutions. John Marshall, in his massive study\nJohn Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture notes\nthat the 1680s were the climactic decade for this kind of\npersecution. The Dutch Republic, where Locke spent years in exile, had\nbeen founded as a secular state which would allow religious\ndifferences. This was a reaction to the Catholic persecution of\nProtestants. However, once the Calvinist Church gained power, they\nbegan persecuting other sects, such as the Remonstrants, who disagreed\nwith them. Nonetheless, The Dutch Republic remained the most tolerant\ncountry in Europe. In France, religious conflict had been temporarily\nquieted by the edict of Nantes. But in 1685, the year in which Locke\nwrote the First Letter concerning religious toleration, Louis XIV had\nrevoked the Edict of Nantes, and the Huguenots were being persecuted.\nThough prohibited from doing so, some 200,000 emigrated, while\nprobably 700,000 were forced to convert to Catholicism. People in\nEngland were keenly aware of the events taking place in France.\n\nIn England itself, religious conflict dominated the seventeenth\ncentury, contributing in important respects to the coming of the\nEnglish Civil War, and the abolishing of the Anglican Church during\nthe Protectorate. After the Restoration of Charles II, Anglicans in\nparliament passed laws that repressed both Catholics and Protestant\nsects such as Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers and Unitarians who did\nnot agree with the doctrines or practices of the state Church. Of\nthese various dissenting sects, some were closer to the Anglicans,\nothers more remote. One reason, among others, why King Charles may\nhave found Shaftesbury useful was that they were both concerned about\nreligious toleration. They parted when it became clear that the King\nwas mainly interested in toleration for Catholics, and Shaftesbury for\nProtestant dissenters.\n\nOne widely discussed strategy for reducing religious conflict in\nEngland was called comprehension. The idea was to reduce the doctrines\nand practices of the Anglican church to a minimum so that most, if not\nall, of the dissenting sects would be included in the state church.\nFor those which even this measure would not serve, there was to be\ntoleration. Toleration we may define as a lack of state persecution.\nNeither of these strategies made much progress during the course of\nthe Restoration.\n\nWhen Locke fled to Holland after the discovery of the Rye house plot,\nhe became involved with a group of scholars advocating religious\ntoleration. This group included Benjamin Furly, a quaker with whom\nLocke lived for a while, the noted philosopher Pierre Bayle, several\nDutch theologians, and many others. This group read all the arguments\nfor religious intolerance and discussed them in book and conversation\nclubs. Members of the group considered toleration not only for\nProtestants and Protestant dissenters but Jews, Moslems, and Catholics. A\nrecent discovery of a page of Locke\u2019s reflections on toleration\nof Catholics shows that Locke considered even the pros and cons of\ntoleration for Catholics (Walmsley and Waldmann 2019). Some members\nof the group also wrote tolerationist articles and books. They helped\neach other get jobs. Some of their members founded journals that\nreviewed books and articles on religious, scientific, and other\ntopics. The group took the notion of free speech, civility, and\npoliteness in discourse seriously. They called themselves the\n\u2018the Republic of Letters\u2019 or in Locke\u2019s phrase\n\u2018the commonwealth of learning.\u2019\n\nWhat were Locke\u2019s religious views and where did he fit into the\ndebates about religious toleration? This is a quite difficult question\nto answer. Religion and Christianity in particular, is perhaps the\nmost important influence on the shape of Locke\u2019s philosophy. But\nwhat kind of Christian was Locke? Locke\u2019s family were Puritans.\nAt Oxford, Locke avoided becoming an Anglican priest. Still, Locke\nhimself claimed to be an Anglican until he died and Locke\u2019s\nnineteenth-century biographer Fox Bourne thought that Locke was an\nAnglican. Others have identified him with the Latitudinarians\u2014a\nmovement among Anglicans to argue for a reasonable Christianity that\ndissenters ought to accept. Still, there are some reasons to think\nthat Locke was neither an orthodox Anglican or a Latitudinarian. Locke\ngot Isaac Newton to write Newton\u2019s most powerful\nanti-Trinitarian tract. Locke arranged to have the work published\nanonymously in Holland though in the end, Newton decided not to\npublish (McLachlan 1941). This strongly suggests that Locke too was by\nthis time an Arian or unitarian. (Arius, c. 250\u2013336, asserted\nthe primacy of the Father over the Son and thus rejected the doctrine\nof the Trinity and was condemned as a heretic at the Council of Nicaea\nin 325. Newton held that the Church had gone in the wrong direction in\ncondemning Arius.) Given that one main theme of Locke\u2019s\nLetter on Toleration is that there should be a separation\nbetween Church and State, this does not seem like the view of a man\ndevoted to a state religion. It might appear that Locke\u2019s\nwriting The Reasonableness of Christianity in which he argues\nthat the basic doctrines of Christianity are few and compatible with\nreason make him a Latitudinarian. Yet Richard Ashcraft has argued that\ncomprehension for the Anglicans meant conforming to the existing\npractices of the Anglican Church; that is, the abandonment of\nreligious dissent. Ashcraft also suggests that Latitudinarians were\nthus not a moderate middle ground between contending extremes but part\nof one of the extremes\u2014\u201cthe acceptable face of the\npersecution of religious dissent\u201d (Ashcraft 1992: 155). Ashcraft\nholds that while the Latitudinarians may have represented the\n\u201crational theology\u201d of the Anglican church, there was a\ncompeting dissenting \u201crational theology\u201d. Thus, while it\nis true that Locke had Latitudinarian friends, given Ashcraft\u2019s\ndistinction between Anglican and dissenting \u201crational\ntheologies\u201d, it is entirely possible that The Reasonableness\nof Christianity is a work of dissenting \u201crational\ntheology\u201d.\n\nLocke had been thinking, talking and writing about religious\ntoleration since 1659. His views evolved. In the early 1660s he very\nlikely was an orthodox Anglican. He and Shaftesbury had instituted\nreligious toleration in the Fundamental Constitutions of the\nCarolinas (1669). He wrote the Epistola de Tolerantia in\nLatin in 1685 while in exile in Holland. He very likely was seeing\nProtestant refugees pouring over the borders from France where Louis\nXIV had just revoked the Edict of Nantes. Holland itself was a\nCalvinist theocracy with significant problems with religious\ntoleration. But Locke\u2019s Letter does not confine itself to the\nissues of the time. Locke gives a principled account of religious\ntoleration, though this is mixed in with arguments which apply only to\nChristians, and perhaps in some cases only to Protestants. He excluded\nboth Catholics and atheists from religious toleration. In the case of\nCatholics it was because he regarded them as agents of a foreign\npower. Because they do not believe in God, atheists, on Locke\u2019s\naccount: \u201cPromises, covenants and oaths, which are the bonds of\nhuman society, can have no hold upon an atheist\u201d (Mendus 1991:\n47). He gives his general defense of religious toleration while\ncontinuing the anti-Papist rhetoric of the Country party which sought\nto exclude James II from the throne.\n\nLocke\u2019s arguments for religious toleration connect nicely to his\naccount of civil government. Locke defines life, liberty, health and\nproperty as our civil interests. These are the proper concern of a\nmagistrate or civil government. The magistrate can use force and\nviolence where this is necessary to preserve civil interests against\nattack. This is the central function of the state. One\u2019s\nreligious concerns with salvation, however, are not within the domain\nof civil interests, and so lie outside of the legitimate concern of\nthe magistrate or the civil government. In effect, Locke adds an\nadditional right to the natural rights of life, liberty, health and\nproperty\u2014the right of freedom to choose one\u2019s own road to\nsalvation. (See the section on\n Toleration\n in the entry on Locke\u2019s Political Philosophy.)\n\nLocke holds that the use of force by the state to get people to hold\ncertain beliefs or engage in certain ceremonies or practices is\nillegitimate. The chief means which the magistrate has at her disposal\nis force, but force is not an effective means for changing or\nmaintaining belief. Suppose then, that the magistrate uses force so as\nto make people profess that they believe. Locke writes:\n\n\nA sweet religion, indeed, that obliges men to dissemble, and tell lies\nto both God and man, for the salvation of their souls! If the\nmagistrate thinks to save men thus, he seems to understand little of\nthe way of salvation; and if he does it not in order to save them, why\nis he so solicitous of the articles of faith as to enact them by a\nlaw? (Mendus 1991: 41)\n\n\nSo, religious persecution by the state is inappropriate. Locke holds\nthat \u201cWhatever is lawful in the commonwealth cannot be\nprohibited by the magistrate in the church\u201d. This means that the\nuse of bread and wine, or even the sacrificing of a calf could not be\nprohibited by the magistrate.\n\nIf there are competing churches, one might ask which one should have\nthe power? The answer is clearly that power should go to the true\nchurch and not to the heretical church. But Locke claims this amounts\nto saying nothing. For every church believes itself to be the true\nchurch, and there is no judge but God who can determine which of these\nclaims is correct. Thus, skepticism about the possibility of religious\nknowledge is central to Locke\u2019s argument for religious\ntoleration.\n\nFinally, for an account of the influence of Locke\u2019s works, see\nthe supplementary document:\n Supplement on the Influence of Locke\u2019s Works\n\n",

This will supersede <em>The Works of\nJohn Locke</em> of which the 1823 edition is probably the most\nstandard. The new Clarendon editions began with Peter Nidditch\u2019s\nedition of <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> in 1975.\nThe Oxford Clarendon editions contain much of the material of the\nLovelace collection, purchased and donated to Oxford by Paul Mellon.\nThis treasure trove of Locke\u2019s works and letters, which includes\nearly drafts of the <em>Essay</em> and much other material, comes down\nfrom Peter King, Locke\u2019s nephew, who inherited Locke\u2019s\npapers. Access to these papers has given scholars in the twentieth\ncentury a much better view of Locke\u2019s philosophical development\nand provided a window into the details of his activities which is\ntruly remarkable. Hence the new edition of Locke\u2019s works will\nvery likely be definitive.</p> The Clarendon Edition of the Works of\nJohn Locke, Oxford: Clarendon Press:\n\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>[N] <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, Peter H.\nNidditch (ed.), 1975.\ndoi:10.1093/actrade/9780198243861.book.1/actrade-9780198243861-book-1</li>\n<li><em>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</em>, John W.
