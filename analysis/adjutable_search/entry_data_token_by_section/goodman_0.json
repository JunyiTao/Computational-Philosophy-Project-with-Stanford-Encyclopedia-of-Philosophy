    "main_text": "Anti-Absolutism\n2. Anti-Absolutism\nNelson Goodman\u2019s philosophy synthesizes German/Austrian Logical\nEmpiricism, as developed and practiced by philosophers like Rudolf\nCarnap and Carl Hempel, with American Pragmatism of the kind practiced\nand advocated by C.I. Lewis. Goodman, however, departs from both\ntraditions considerably. As we will see, he departs from Lewis\u2019s\npragmatism in dismissing the idea of an indubitable given in\nexperience. He departs from logical empiricism in giving up a\nprincipled analytic/synthetic distinction.\n",
