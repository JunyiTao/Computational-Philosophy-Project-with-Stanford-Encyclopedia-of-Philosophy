Philosophical Issues Brought into Play by Attention to Control of Biological Materials and Conditions\n\nJohannsen, as noted earlier (and conveyed in the contrast between the\nmethod of\n figure 2\n and the theory of\n figure 1),\n provided no method to divide a natural varying population into\nphenotypes as classes of organisms, let alone to use these classes to\nidentify genotypes as classes within such populations. What would be\nrequired then in order to apply his terms and distinction in the study\nof heredity for natural varying populations? A number of pathways can\nbe delineated: \n\n reintegrate\u2014develop methods to bring back and tie\ntogether what had been de-emphasized through the control of biological\nmaterial and conditions employed in the experiments that provided the\nbasis for his original presentation of genotype and phenotype and for\nsubsequent developments in the study of heredity; \n engineer\u2014retain the experimental control within an\nincreasing range of contexts; \n generalize theoretically\u2014use the theory and models\nthat inform the control and engineering as a basis for explaining\nand/or intervening more broadly (Hacking 1983; Cartwright 1999; entry\non\n the structure of scientific theories);\n \n liken\u2014think or act as if observations in natural\nvarying population or less controlled situations derived from similar\ntheory and models; and \n experiment more\u2014do not pursue reintegration, but\ncontinue to employ Mendelian methods to learn more about the biology\nof organisms (Waters 2004).\n\n\nAs a sociological, not a logical matter, success in engineering may\nunderwrite theoretical generalizing and both may, in turn, make more\nplausible any assumed extension to naturally varying populations.\nTogether with further experiments, these pathways may eventually lead\nto success in re-integration. It could be imagined that the processes\nexposed in controlled conditions would eventually explain heredity in\nnaturally varying populations. This might happen by researchers\nidentifying the material constituents of the genotype passed to the\norganism by its parents and then tracing how all these constituents\ninfluence the development over time of the organism\u2019s traits or\nphenotype\u2014perhaps first in controlled conditions, and then in\nvariable ecological situations (see entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n However, there is no guarantee that the original experimental basis\nfor the genotype-phenotype distinction or subsequent developments must\nlead to effective engineering, theoretical generalization, or likening\nthat clarifies. Indeed, as a sociological not logical matter, pursuing\nsuch steps may distract attention from the project of re-integration.\n Section 5\n reviews what would be entailed in reintegration, doing so in order to\nproblematize the status of the original experimentally based\ndistinction as a basis for the study of heredity for natural varying\npopulations. The rest of section 4 points to several areas of\nphilosophical discussions brought into play and extended by\nexperiments followed by the pathways and steps above.\n\nThe \u201cNew Experimentalism\u201d counters or complicates a\ntraditional emphasis in philosophy of science on theories by studying\nwhat goes on in laboratories, or, more generally, the practical\nmethods of achieving reliable results (see entries on\n experiment in biology\n &\n the structure of scientific theories).\n As noted earlier\n (section 2),\n attention is also warranted to the ways that an area of biology, such\nas the study of heredity, becomes experimental in the first place.\nExperiments in biology may lead to the engineering of new phenomena or\nobjects, such as knockout mice (i.e., a line with a specific gene\ndeactivated), but, at the same time, they leave open the question of\nthe significance of what gets de-emphasized through the control of\nbiological material and conditions employed in the experiments. To\ncontinue the knockout example: does the effect of a gene knocked out\nin a highly inbred line of mice extrapolate to its effects in\nnaturally variable populations of mice, let alone other species? In\nother words, the demonstration of genes in knockout lines that have\ndefined effects could be a textbook case of something\nrepresented\u2014the DNA sequence as gene\u2014warranting the status\nreal given the reliable effect of its absence. Yet\nantirealists could point to what has not yet been observed given the\nspecial experimental conditions of Mendelian research and subsequent\nmolecular biology (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Such an objection notwithstanding, if there is a method that is\nproductive of results, there will be scientists who apply it even if\nthe results do not address questions that once motivated their line of\ninquiry (as evident, for example, when, as noted earlier, the study of\nheredity came to focus on differences not similarity and development).\nHow is any such pragmatism to be viewed?\u2014are experiments in\nbiology like a philosophical pragmatism concerned with truth or one\nconcerned about achieving goals and formulating further goals that can\nbe pursued in practice (see entry on\n pragmatism).\n Or is it a pragmatism highlighted more in sociology than philosophy\nof science, in which the researcher or the interpreter of science\nconsiders how difficult it is in practice to modify what has\nbeen established as knowledge (Latour 1987)? The last sense fits well\nwith this entry\u2019s attention to abstraction in the form of the\nmaterial practices of control over biological\nmaterials and conditions advanced in modern experimental biology and\nagricultural breeding. It should be noted, however, that this form of\nabstraction centers on objects that are concrete, not therefore\nconforming to the contrast abstract versus concrete (see entry on\n abstract objects).\n \n\nThe interrelated issues concerning pragmatism, scientific realism, and\nabstraction become even more pertinent when the theory and models that\ninform experiments, such as the genotype-phenotype distinction in\nMendelian research, are extended to less-controlled situations, such\nas agricultural breeding trials, and to analysis of data derived from\nthem. As noted earlier, quantitative genetics relies on models of\ncontributions from unobserved, theoretical genotypes. Analyses of data\nusing those models allow breeders to decide which traits to enhance\nthrough selection even though they have no evidence independent of the\ndata to confirm the assumption in their models about\ntheoretical genotypes and their contributions (Lloyd 1988). Yet, as publications,\ncareers, release of varieties, software packages, and so on get built\non such a foundation, it becomes ever more difficult in practical\nterms for researchers to promote alternatives that do not rest on the\nunobserved and unconfirmed entities and properties. Indeed,\nunconceived alternatives, the possibility that Stanford\n(2006) highlights, may well include theories that entail methods that\nare, for various reasons, impractical. The pragmatic issue of\nneeding a practical method applies in turn to philosophy: When\nphilosophers make distinctions or otherwise point to issues that\nscientists have left unclear or under-examined, by what means do they\nenvisage influencing the scientists to change their views or\npractices? That question is left open by this entry. The\ngenotype-phenotype distinction has been positioned in this entry in\nrelation to control of biological materials and conditions, thus\ndrawing attention to the challenge of reintegrating what had been\nde-emphasized through that control. Yet, no method is provided for\nphilosophers to get the challenge taken up beyond the implication that\nthe description\u2014the framing\u2014would be a helpful starting\npoint. In other words, the entry has positioned the genotype-phenotype\ndistinction in line with the descriptive emphasis in the New\nExperimentalism on scientific practice, a prescriptive\npossibility of reintegration, and an open question about the method\nneeded to shift actual practice. (The contrast of descriptive versus\nprescriptive perspectives is explored in Stegenga\u2019s 2009 review\nof Weber\u2019s contribution to philosophy of experimental\nbiology.)\n\nThe description versus prescription contrast also comes into play in\nrelation to the different kinds of meaning given to the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction. Should philosophers descriptively\ntrace the shifts in meaning from Johannsen to the current day, or\nshould they prescriptively disambiguate different meanings that may\ncoexist among the work of different groups of researchers or even\nwithin a given group (see entry on\n ambiguity)?\n Or should it be simply and descriptively noted that coexisting\nmeanings make the genotype-phenotype distinction a \u201cboundary\nobject\u201d that allows various fields (or \u201csocial\nworlds\u201d) to interact even though the fields use the term to\ndifferent ends (Star & Griesemer 1989)? Perhaps the different\nmeanings given to the term serve as a reminder of the disunity of\nscience that follows once rationality and objectivity are seen not as\n\u201cuniversal or necessary [matters], but local and contingent,\nrelative to scientific interests and purposes\u201d (entry on\n the unity of science;\n Cartwright 1999). Descriptively, philosophers could tease out the\ndifferent, sometimes incommensurable, interests and purposes that make\na line of inquiry rational. Prescriptively, they may highlight where\nthey disagree with a given field\u2019s interests and purposes, but\nthey could also advocate pluralistic acceptance of different sciences\nthat reflect \n\n\nthe complexity of the phenomena under investigation in interaction\nwith the limitations of human cognitive capacities and the variety\nof\u2026 pragmatic interests in representations of those phenomena\n\n\n\n(The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge; on \u201cpragmatic\ninterests\u201d, see also references on social and economic history\nof heredity at the end of\n section 1).\n However, two other possibilities remain, namely, ambiguity in the use\nof the genotype-phenotype distinction obscures shortcomings in\ntheories and methods and allows the advances in one field (e.g.,\nmolecular genetics) to be seen to render more plausible the\nempirically and conceptually unrelated claims of another (e.g.,\nquantitative genetics) (see sections\n 5.2.1,\n 6.4, and\n 6.5).\n",
