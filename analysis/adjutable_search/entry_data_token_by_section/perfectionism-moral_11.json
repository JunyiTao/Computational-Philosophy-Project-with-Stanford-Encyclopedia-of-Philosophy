    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics || Manipulation and Independence\n3.5 Manipulation and Independence\n\n\nMost perfectionist writers accept that sometimes the state can\npermissibly use coercion to promote the good. Still, coercion is\nin general a clumsy device for pursuing perfectionist ends\n(Hurka 1993, 157). Noncoercive perfectionism, such as subsidizing\nvaluable pursuits, attaching penalties to worthless ones or creating\nnew valuable options, is often the better method for promoting\nthe\n good.[16]\nEven noncoercive\nperfectionist measures, however, may pose a threat to autonomy.\nAs one critic expresses the worry,\n\n\nMessing with the options that one faces, changing one\u2019s\npayoffs can be seen as manipulation \u2026 If it is done\nintentionally, it also takes on the insulting aspect of manipulation,\nfor it treats the agent as someone incapable of making independent\nmoral decisions on the merits of the case. (Waldron 1989,\n1145\u20131146)\n\n\nThe objection is that noncoercive state perfectionism is inherently\nmanipulative. It distorts the rational decision making of\ncitizens by altering the value of their options. It is also\ninsulting\u2014the state treats its subjects as if they were\nchildren\u2014and this is objectionable, over and above any impact\nit has on their autonomy.\n\n\nThese are important concerns. Before discussing them more\nfully, we need to clarify their character. The noncoercive\nperfectionist measures in question are paternalistic in the sense that\nthey are intended to help citizens lead better lives. Not every\nkind of noncoercive state perfectionism is paternalistic,\nhowever. Recall nonhumanistic versions of perfectionism.\nThose who accept these views might favor state support for excellence\nin science and art not because doing so will enable citizens to lead\nbetter lives, but because the state ought to promote excellence.\nThis defense of noncoercive state paternalism does not presume that\nsome citizens are not good at making independent moral decisions about\nhow to lead their lives. The manipulation objection to\nnoncoercive state perfectionism, accordingly, must target a subset of\nthese measures.\n\n\nFocus then on noncoercive state perfectionist measures that are\nintended to help citizens make better decisions about how to lead their\nlives. Even if these measures are well designed, they may invade\nautonomy. And if autonomy is itself a perfectionist good, then\nthere would be perfectionist reasons to oppose these perfectionist\nmeasures. These reasons would not establish that no such measures\nshould be undertaken. Presumably, the autonomy-based reasons\ncould be outweighed in some cases, but\u2014assuming again that\nautonomy is a perfectionist good\u2014these reasons would establish\nthat there is a pro tanto case against state perfectionism of\nthis kind.\n\n\nIs it true that noncoercive state perfectionism that aims to help\ncitizens make better choices is inherently manipulative in an\nautonomy-invading way? Perhaps not. No government\n\u201ccan avoid either nonrationally shaping its citizen\u2019s\npreferences or providing them with incentives\u201d (Sher 1997,\n66). This is true, since even if governments do not adopt\nperfectionist measures, the unintended consequences of state action\nwill have effects on citizen preferences for options and on the\nrelative costs of the different options that they confront. Thus\nit can be said that \u201cif all political arrangements do\nnonrationally shape preferences and provide incentives, a government\nwill not further diminish autonomy simply by producing these effects\nintentionally\u201d (Sher 1997, 67).\n\n\nThis line of argument can be extended further. Every political\nsociety provides its members with an ethical environment, an\nenvironment that consists of options and pressures, some rational and\nsome not, that affect how the options are perceived. A political\nsociety that does not engage in state perfectionism of any kind can be\nsaid to countenance the ethical environment that results from its\npolitical decisions. (It countenances this environment insofar as\nit could have made decisions that would have affected it, but chose not\nto do so.) It is possible that an ethical environment that\nresults from no state perfectionism will be ideal for the autonomous\ndecision making of its members. This may not always be the case,\nhowever. Noncoercive state perfectionist measures may be able to\ncounteract or cancel various pressures and influences that would\notherwise impede rational decision making by its citizens.\nDesigned well, such measures might contribute to an ethical environment\nin which people were best able to respond to the reasons for and\nagainst the options that they confront.\n\n\nThis argument puts the spotlight squarely on the effects of\nperfectionist measures. If these measures help citizens respond\nbetter to the reasons for and against the choices that they confront,\nthen they may not invade, but rather protect and promote, autonomous\ndecision making. If so, this state perfectionism could not be\nresisted by appeal to autonomy\u2019s perfectionist value.\nEven if this argument were accepted, however, it would not\naddress all the concerns that motivate the manipulation\nobjection. That objection points not only to the effect that\nnoncoercive state perfectionism can have on autonomous decision making,\nbut also to its potentially insulting character. And its\npotentially insulting character is a function of the fact that it is\nintentionally undertaken by the state.\n\n\nNoncoercive state perfectionism can take two forms. It might\nbe designed to protect and promote autonomous agency, or it might be\ndesigned to help citizens pursue or engage with valuable options\n(Wall 1998, 197\u2013198). The second form may seem insulting in the\nway that the first is not. For the first form of state\nperfectionism merely seeks to empower citizens to make authentic\ndecisions about how to lead their own lives. It does not attempt\nto encourage them to take up some pursuits over others on the grounds\nthat doing so would constitute a more valuable exercise of their\nautonomous agency. It is possible that people have a fundamental\nright to ethical independence that rules out at least this second form\nof state \n perfectionism.[17]\n\n\nWe cannot escape the influence of our ethical environment: we\nare subject to the examples, exhortations, and celebrations of other\npeople\u2019s ideas about how to live. But we must insist that\nthat environment be created under the aegis of ethical independence:\nthat it be created organically by the decisions of millions of people\nwith the freedom to make their own choices, not through political\nmajorities imposing their decisions on everyone. (Dworkin 2011,\n371)\n\n\nIf there is a right to ethical independence (and if people generally\nbelieved in its existence), then this would help to explain the sense\nof insult mentioned above. State perfectionism, it could be said,\nusurps the responsibility of people to lead their own lives as they see\nfit, provided that they allow others the same freedom. By so\ndoing, it treats adult citizens as if they were children.\n\n\nThe right to ethical independence may be thought to follow from\nsomething even more fundamental\u2014the equal moral status of\ncitizens. State perfectionist measures, whether coercive or not,\nthat aim to encourage some pursuits and discourage others on the\ngrounds that they have greater ethical value offends this status by\npresuming that some citizens are not fully capable of forming, pursuing\nand revising a conception of the good (Quong 2011, 101\u2013106).\nThis denial of equal moral status explains why such measures send an\ninsulting message, one that is objectionable over and above any impact\nit has on the autonomy of citizens.\n\n\nIn response, perfectionists can argue that the purported right to\nethical independence is an exaggeration of an important, but more\nmodest truth. If autonomy is a perfectionist good, and if it is a\ncentral component in a well lived life, then persons have rights to\nmake important life-shaping decisions that governments must\nrespect. By acknowledging and honoring these rights, governments\ntreat their citizens not as children, but as independent moral\nagents. However, these rights do not follow from, or add up to, a\ngeneral right of ethical independence, one that rules out all\ngovernmental efforts to promote the good.\n\n\nFurther, perfectionists can argue that it is no insult to a\nperson\u2019s status as a moral equal to treat him in ways that\npresume that his rational capacities are not perfect, but subject to\nerror. Our capacity to form, pursue and revise a conception of\nthe good, like our capacity for a sense of justice, can lead us to\nmistaken conclusions. When the state supports valuable pursuits\nover worthless ones, it no more denies the equal moral status of those\nwho reject its action than when it enforces a sound conception of\njustice that is in dispute. In both cases, presuming that\ncitizens can make errors does not express the view that they lack, or\nare deficient in, the capacities that constitute equal moral\nstatus.\n",
