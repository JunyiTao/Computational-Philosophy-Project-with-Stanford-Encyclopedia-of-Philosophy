The barometer and the storm (Jeffrey\n1969).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The barometer and the storm.\n\\(A =\\) drop in atmospheric pressure; \\(B =\\) drop in mercury level in\nbarometer; \\(S =\\) storm.\n\n\nA drop in the level of mercury in a barometer is frequently followed\nby a storm. Call these events B and S, respectively.\nSince storms in general are not so frequent, these events are\nprobabilistically correlated: \\(p(B \\cap S) > p(B)p(S)\\). The\nbehavior of one barometer doesn\u2019t affect the weather, so\nB is not a cause of S; rather, B and S\nhave a common cause: a drop in atmospheric pressure A (see\n Figure 2).\n A increases the probability of both B and S:\n \n\n\\[p(B|A) > p(B|\\overline{A}) \\textrm{ and  }p(S|A) > p(S|\\overline{A}). \\]\n\n\nMoreover, A will screen off B from S:\n\n \\[p(B \\cap S|A) = p(B|A)p(S|A)\\] \n\n\nand  \n\n\\[p(B \\cap S|\\overline{A}) = p(B|\\overline{A})p(S|\\overline{A}).\\]\n\n\nFor example, if the atmospheric pressure drops, but the column of\nmercury in the barometer does not drop because the barometer is\nmalfunctioning, the probability of a storm is the same as it would be\nif the barometer were functioning properly.\n\n\n\nExample 2. The theatre troupe (Reichenbach\n1956).\n\nA small theatre troupe travels around the country putting on\nperformances. Occasionally, the leading man becomes seriously\nill\u2014call this event M\u2014and an understudy must take\nhis place. The same thing sometimes happens to the leading\nlady\u2014L. Although both events are rare, they tend to occur\ntogether: \\(p(L \\cap M) > p(L)p(M)\\). The reason is that the actors\nusually eat together at the same restaurants, where they occasionally\nshare tainted food\u2014T. See\n Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The theatre troupe. \\(T =\\)\nfood tainted at restaurant patronized by actors; \\(L =\\) leading lady\ngets sick; \\(M =\\) leading man gets sick.\n\n\nSuppose the probabilities are as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(T)  & = .1\\\\\np(L|T) = p(M|T) & = .8\\\\\np(L|\\overline{T}) = p(M|\\overline{T}) & = .1\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThen we can compute: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(L \\cap M|T) = p(L|T)p(M|T) &= .64\\\\\np(L \\cap M|\\overline{T}) = p(L|\\overline{T})p(M|\\overline{T}) &= .01\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThese calculations make use of the fact that T and\n\\(\\overline{T}\\) screen L off from M. We can also\ncompute: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np(L) = p(L|T)p(T) + p(L|\\overline{T})p(\\overline{T}) & = .17 = p(M)\\\\\np(L \\cap M) = p(L \\cap M|T)p(T) + p(L \\cap M|\\overline{T})p(\\overline{T}) & = .073\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus \n\n\\[.073 = p(L \\cap M) > p(L)p(M) = .17^{2} = .0289.\\]\n\n\nL and M are probabilistically correlated.\n\nSuppose that, on a given night, both the leading man and the leading\nlady are seriously ill. Can we infer that they ate tainted food? From\nthe probabilities above, we can compute \n\n\\[p(T|L \\cap M) = \\frac{.064}{.073} \\cong .877.\\]\n\n\nWhile it is probable that they ate tainted food, it is by no means a\ncertainty. This example shows that the Common Cause Principle, by\nitself, does not license token-level causal inferences. That\nis, it does not tell us that when two effects A and\nB occur on a particular occasion, then their common cause\nC also occurred on this occasion. Instead, the Common Cause\nPrinciple licenses the inference from a probabilistic correlation to\nthe existence of a type-level common cause.\n\n\n\nExample 3. Language descent.\n\nCommon words in English that start with the letter \u2018F\u2019\noften have counterparts in Spanish that start with the letter\n\u2018P\u2019: \u2018foot\u2019/\u2018pie\u2019,\n\u2018fish\u2019/\u2018pez\u2019,\n\u2018father\u2019/\u2018padre\u2019, etc. One could quantify this\nby looking at canonical wordlists from both languages, and seeing how\noften words begin with \u2018F\u2019 in English and with\n\u2018P\u2019 in Spanish. By treating the relative frequencies in\nthis list as probabilities, one would discover that there is indeed a\nprobabilistic correlation between the English word-initial\n\u2018F\u2019 and Spanish word-initial \u2018P\u2019.\n\nThe explanation for this correlation is that English and Spanish are\ndescended from a common language, called Proto-Indo-European.\nSome, but not all, words in Proto-Indo-European began with a consonant\nwe can label [P/F], which evolved into \u2018P\u2019 in Romance\nlanguages (including Spanish), and \u2018F\u2019 in Germanic\nlanguages (including English). (Note that it is the phonetic\npronunciation, rather than the spelling that is of interest here; for\nexample, many German words whose spelling begins with \u2018V\u2019\nare counted for this purpose.) In the separate lineages leading from\nProto-Indo-European to English and to Spanish, Proto-Indo-European\nroots were retained for some words, but replaced for others. The roots\nwere retained often enough that the correlation can still be detected.\nMoreover, the two lineages evolved more or less independently after\nsplitting from Proto-Indo-European. Note that the common cause is not\nthe Proto-Indo-European language as a whole, and the effects are not\nEnglish and Spanish. It would make little sense to assign\nprobabilities to these languages (let alone a joint probability to\nEnglish and Spanish). Rather, the common cause is an initial consonant\n[P/F] in Proto-Indo-European; the effects are initial \u2018F\u2019\nin English and initial \u2018P\u2019 in Spanish. It makes sense to\nassign probabilities to these sounds, since we can count the frequency\nwith which words in these languages start with these sounds. See\n Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The descent of words with\ninitial consonant \u2018F\u2019 in English and initial consonant\n\u2018P\u2019 in Spanish, from words with initial consonant [P/F] in\nProto-Indo-European.\n\n\nNote that the evidence of common descent between the two languages is\nthe correlation between the two sounds, rather than any\nphonetic similarity between them. For example, there is a recognized\ncorrelation between the Latin \u2018du\u2019 and Armenian\n\u2018erk\u2019, as in \u2018duo\u2019/\u2018erku\u2019\n(\u2018two\u2019). Despite the differences in these sounds, the\ncorrelation is evidence of common descent (both are also Indo-European\nlanguages).\n\nFor further discussion of this example, see Hitchcock (1998).\n\n\n\nExample 4. Fried fish.\n\nBoth the British and the Japanese eat battered seafood that has been\ndeep-fried in oil: the British in the form of fish and chips, and the\nJapanese in the form of tempura. The technique of battering and\ndeep-frying seafood seems to have originated with Moors in the Iberian\nPeninsula in the thirteenth century, where the dish was called\nmu\u2019affar. It spread to the Jewish and Christian\ninhabitants of Spain and Portugal. In the sixteenth century, Sephardic\nJews fleeing persecution took the recipe to Britain, and Portuguese\ntraders carried it to Japan.\n\nWhile it might be reasonable to call mu\u2019affar the\ncommon cause of fish and chips and tempura, this is not an instance of\nthe Common Cause Principle. There are no probabilities involved in\nthis example, and there is no clear sense in which the British and\nJapanese both eating fried seafood is a probabilistic correlation.\nPerhaps one could construct a probabilistic model of global food\ndistribution that would supply such probabilities, but in the absence\nof such a model, we do not have an instance of RCCP.\n\n",
