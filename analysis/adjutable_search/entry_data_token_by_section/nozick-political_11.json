    "main_text": "Justice in Holdings || The Critique of End-State and Patterned Principles\n4.2 The Critique of End-State and Patterned Principles\n\nNozick discerns two types of principles concerning justice in holdings\nother than the historical entitlement type. These are end-state\nprinciples and patterned principles. To a considerable extent,\nNozick\u2019s argument on behalf of his historical entitlement\napproach consists in his critiques of end-state and patterned\ndoctrines. End-state principles hold that justice in the distribution\nof income (or economically valuable goods) is a matter of some\narithmetical feature of one of the available distributions. Consider\nthree available distributions of income among three individuals (or\namong three positions to be occupied by individuals):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA\nB\nC \n\nDistribution D1\n12\n10\n9 \n\nDistribution D2\n4\n22\n13 \n\nDistribution D3\n20\n8\n8  \n\n\nA utilitarian (or income maximization) theory will select\nD2 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nhas the greatest total income. An egalitarian theory will select\nD1 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nis the most equal distribution. Rawls\u2019 difference principle will\nselect D1 on the distinct ground that within it\nthe lowest payoff is greater than the lowest payoff within any other\navailable distribution. What makes each of these doctrines an\nend-state view is their shared conviction that the information\nprovided by this sort of matrix is sufficient for determining which of\nthe available distributions is the just one.\n\nAccording to Nozick, a major problem for all end-state doctrines is\nprecisely the falsity of this shared conviction. For surely\ninformation that cannot appear within such a matrix is essential to a\nsensible judgment about which of these available distributions is\njust. Consider, e.g., the following information.\nD2 is the distribution of income that obtains when\nA is enslaved to B who employs C as his\neffective overseer. D1 is the distribution that\nobtains when A is partially emancipated and is only subject\nto slavery-like exploitation by B and C one week per\nmonth. And D3 is the distribution that obtains\nwhen A is entirely emancipated. Given the obvious relevance\nof this sort of information for any responsible selection of one of\nthese distributions as the just one, any doctrine that asserts or\npresumes that the information available in the matrix suffices has to\nbe deeply flawed.\n\nPatterned theories of distributive justice escape this problem because\nthey hold that the just distribution is the available distribution in\nwhich the income accorded to individuals most tracks some feature of\nthose individuals\u2014e.g., their moral desert or their economic\neffort\u2014and the incidence of that feature is not reported in that\nincome matrix. Hence, one cannot say which of the distributions\npresented in the above table is to be selected until one also knows\nwhat the distribution of the to-be-tracked feature is among\nA, B, and C. In addition, plausible\npatterned doctrines will focus on features of individuals that are\nhistorical\u2014e.g., how much moral desert particular individuals\nhave amassed or how much economic effort they have evinced. So,\nplausible patterned doctrines will be historical. However, unlike\nhistorical entitlement doctrines, historical patterned theories will\nnot determine the justice of the particular holdings of individuals on\nthe basis of whether those individuals acquired those holdings through\nentitlement generating or conveying processes.\n\nNozick offers a series of arguments each of which is supposed to\ndiscredit all (non-trivial) end-state and patterned principles. (At\nthis point, Nozick employs the term \u201cpatterned\u201d to refer\nboth to end-state principles and track-the-feature principles.) We\nmust focus here on two of those arguments. The first, most famous, and\nmost misunderstood of these arguments appears in the section of\nASU that is entitled \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d (160\u2013164). The second appears in the section\nentitled \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d\n(167\u2013174).\n\nIn \u201cHow Liberty Upsets Patterns\u201d, Nozick asks each of his\nreaders to envision an income distribution that accords with her\nfavorite patterning principle. Then Nozick points out that more or\nless as soon as that pattern P1 is instituted,\nindividuals will engage in highly innocuous dispositions of what has\nbeen assigned to them in the name of justice that will engender a\ndifferent pattern P2. For instance, a million fans\nwill each pay Wilt Chamberlain 25 cents to see him play basketball.\nHowever, this new pattern P2 will almost certainly\nbe convertible through fine-tuned social engineering into another\npattern P3 that better realizes the favored\npatterning principle. Imagine, e.g., that the $250,000 that is\nconcentrated in Wilt\u2019s hands within P2 can\nbe effectively redistributed downward whereas it could not be\neffectively redistributed downward when it was still spread out among\nWilt\u2019s moderately prosperous fans. Thus, if we continue to\nassess distributions on the basis of the selected patterning\nprinciple, we will have to declare P2 to be unjust\nand maintain that justice requires its conversion into\nP3. And, more or less as soon as\nP3 is instituted, individuals will engage in\nhighly innocuous dispositions of what has just been assigned to them\nin the name of renewed justice that will engender a different pattern\nP4 \u2026 and so on. Nozick then identified two\nproblems with this continued application of the favored patterned\nrule.\n\nThis first problem is that, if (as stipulated) the holdings of\nindividuals under P1 were just and if (as\nstipulated) interactions that converted P1 into\nP2 were all just, it is difficult to see how\nP2 can become infected with injustice. Of course,\nP2 (almost certainly) must be judged to\nbe unjust if one continues to assess the justice of distributions on\nthe basis of the adopted patterned principle. But it seems reasonable\nto demand an explanation of how that asserted injustice could\nhave entered P2 given the justice of\nP1 and of the processes through which\nP2 emerges from P1.\n\n\nBy what process could such a transfer among two persons give rise to a\nlegitimate claim of distributive justice on a portion of what was\ntransferred, by a third party who has no claim of justice on any\nholding of the others before the transfer? (161\u20132)\n\n\nIt does not seem to be a sufficient answer to say that injustice must\nhave entered in P2 because, after all, when we\napply the operative distributive principle to P2\nwe reach the conclusion that P2 is unjust.\n\nThe second problem is that the endorsement of redistributive\ninterference with the outcomes of persons\u2019 innocuous deployments\nof their assigned holdings seems to be inconsistent with the justice\nof that assignment of holdings. For surely one may dispose as one\nchooses of one\u2019s just holdings as long as one does not unjustly\nimpinge upon others and their just holdings.\n\n\nIf the people were entitled to dispose of the resources to which they\nwere entitled (under D1), didn\u2019t this\ninclude their being entitled to give it to, or exchange it with Wilt\nChamberlain? (161)\n\n\nTo endorse redistributive interference with the outcomes of\npersons\u2019 non-impinging dispositions of the holdings that have\nbeen assigned to them seems to rescind the justice of that assignment\nof holdings.\n\n\nPatterned distributional principles do not give people what\nentitlement principles do, only better distributed. They do not give\nthe right to choose what to do with what one has\u2026 (167)\n\n\nThis aspect of Nozick\u2019s critique is nicely summed up in Hillel\nSteiner\u2019s quip that patterned theories of justice \u201ccreate\nrights to interfere with the rights that they have created\u201d\n(Steiner 1977:\n 43).[26]\n\nIt is important to note that the problems that Nozick\u2019s\nidentifies are problems internal to the ongoing application\nof any patterned principle. Nozick should not be read as making the\nquestion-begging external argument that, since conforming to liberty\nis the standard by which theories of justice in holdings should be\nassessed and patterned theories often call for interferences with\nliberty, patterned theories must be dismissed. Nevertheless, Nozick\nbears considerable responsibility for this reading when he says,\n\n\nThe general point\u2026 is that no end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continually\nrealized without continuous interference with people\u2019s lives.\n(163)\n\n\nNor should Nozick be pictured as holding that the problem with\npatterned theories is that they would forbid any departure from a\nP1 that is instituted because, at the time it is\ninstituted, it is the available distribution that best realizes some\nfavored pattern. Nozick is not charging patterning theorists with\nforbidding the exchange between Wilt and his fans.\n\nAn important response to Nozick\u2019s \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d arguments is that they rely upon a mistaken picture of\nthe patterned theorist\u2019s program. According to this response,\nNozick represents the patterned theorist as aiming at the daily (or\nweekly or monthly) fullest available realization of her favorite\npattern. On this representation, at the end of each day (or week or\nmonth) the advocate of, e.g., the Rawlsian difference principle will\ndetermine whether the existing distribution can be transformed into\none that provides a higher income for those in the lowest income\npositions for the next day (or week or month); if such a\ntransformation is available then (on this representation) the\ndifference principle advocate will require it as a matter of justice.\nHence, the continuous interference in the name of justice with the\nresults of people acting as they choose with their purported just\nholdings. However, the advocate of the difference principle will\nmaintain that this principle guides the design of the basic\ninstitutional structure of society; it provides the basic structure\nwith the aim of raising the lifetime income of the representative\nlowest income individual as much as possible. What is assigned to\nindividuals as a matter of distributive justice is a lifetime stream\nof income that arises through some combination of permitted and\nprotected modes of income acquisition, tax and regulatory structures,\nand tax-funded assistance. Wilt does not have a claim in justice to\nhis holdings on the day before the fans transfer $250,000 to him or to\nhis holdings on the following day. He has a claim in justice to the\nlifetime income that will accrue to him when a basic structure is in\nplace which, through enabling income acquisition, taxing, regulating,\nand subsidizing income yields (something like) the highest possible\nlifetime income for the least advantaged. That claim in justice is not\nviolated when the IRS seizes, say, 70% of his $250,000 windfall.\n\nHence, in his most direct response to Nozick\u2019s challenge, Rawls\ndeclares,\n\n\nThere are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences with\ncitizens\u2019 expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are\nearned, and honored as the public system declares. Taxes and\nrestrictions are all in principle foreseeable, and holdings\nare acquired on the known condition that certain transfers\nand redistributions will be made. (Rawls 1993: 283, emphasis\nadded)\n\n\nIt would seem, however, that Nozick can insist that any ongoing\nattempt to maximize lifetime incomes for the worst off (or to sustain\nany other non-trivial pattern) will require unannounced and\nunpredictable interferences with citizens\u2019 expectations and\nacquisitions. For, as economic preferences, needs, opportunities,\nbeliefs, insights, and capacities change in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways, the public system will similarly have to change if\nit is going to continue to aim at maximizing lifetime incomes for the\nworst off. And as further unannounced and unpredictable changes occur,\nthe basic structure will again have to be changed in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways. As Rawls himself says, \u201c\u2026 even in a\nwell-ordered society, adjustments in the basic structure are always\nnecessary\u201d (Rawls 1993: 284, Mack 2018: 124\u2013129). The\ninstitution of those adjustments will almost certainly have to\ndishonor some of the entitlements proclaimed under the previous public\nsystem and treat some of people\u2019s previously earned holdings to\npreviously unannounced and unpredictable transfers and redistributions\n(Mack 2002a, 85\u201391).\n\nIn \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d Nozick offers a\nmore external argument against all patterned theories of justice. The\nargument is that the institutional operation of any (non-trivial)\npatterned doctrine amounts to the institution of partial ownership of\nsome people by other people.\n\n\nWhether it is done through taxation on wages or on wages over a\ncertain amount, or through seizure of profits, or through there being\na big social pot so that it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s coming from\nwhere and what\u2019s going where, patterned principles of\ndistributive justice involve appropriating the actions of other\npersons. Seizing the results of someone\u2019s labor is equivalent to\nseizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various\nactivities\u2026 . This process \u2026 makes [those who carry it\nout] a part-owner of you; it gives them a property right in you. Just\nas having such partial control and power of decision, by right, over\nan animal or inanimate object would be to have a property right in it.\n(172)\n\n\nNozick distances himself from a Lockean labor-mixing account of just\ninitial holdings by jokingly asking whether one comes to own the ocean\nby pouring one\u2019s can of tomato juice into it (175). And, in the\npassage above, he carefully avoids saying that the operation of any\npatterned doctrine infringes upon one\u2019s self-ownership by way of\nappropriating one\u2019s labor.\n\nNevertheless, the argument in this passage seems to be quite Lockean\nin its basic structure. Rather than focusing on particular\nexpropriations of this or that labor infused object, the argument\nattends to the configuration of control over individuals\u2019\nactions, time, and decisions that the institution of any (non-trivial)\ndistributive pattern will require. According to Nozick, such a\nconfiguration of control wrongly treats the individuals who are\nsubject to it without their consent as though they are in part the\nproperty of those who establish and exercise that control. Note that\neven here Nozick does not seem to be proposing specific content for\nthe principles of just initial acquisition and just transfer. Rather,\nthe goal is to provide a general vindication of the historical\nentitlement approach by undercutting the end-state and patterned\napproaches.\n",
