    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments || Reply 4: The Argument is Self-Undermining\n3.4 Reply 4: The Argument is Self-Undermining\n\nAs should be clear, slow switch arguments can be seen as skeptical\narguments, where the skeptic raises the possibility that we\nare in Oscar\u2019s predicament. The externalist is thus asked to\nrule out deviant thought contents from the armchair. Moreover, since\nthe skeptic thinks she cannot do so, he claims that the externalist\nlacks armchair self-knowledge. But one sort of reply is that such\nskepticism is self-undermining (Ebbs 1996; 2001; 2005;\nBrueckner & Ebbs, 2012, ch. 12). The contention is that, assuming\nEXT, the skeptic cannot both deny SK and be justified in accepting the\npremises of his own argument. If so, skeptical slow switch arguments\nend up being incoherent.\n\nConsider that, since the skeptic wants to make a general point about\nknowledge, he should see slow switch possibilities as relevant to his\nown situation. The skeptic should not make an exception of himself,\nre: his skeptical thesis. Hence, when the skeptic levies the slow\nswitch argument, his premises force him to say of himself:\n\nIf I am on Twin Earth, then my saying \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that twin water is\nscrumptious.\nIf I am on Earth, then my saying \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that water is\nscrumptious.\n\n\nHis premises also require him to say that:\n\nI cannot know from the armchair which of the two thoughts is\nexpressed by \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 (given that switching\npossibilities are relevant).\n\n\nThe problem, however, is that (III) applies to \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 whenever the skeptic says it. Therefore, it applies\nto the utterance as it occurs in the consequent of (II). So\nif (III) is assumed, it follows that the skeptic does not know from\nthe armchair what thought is expressed by the consequent of (II),\nhence, by (II) itself. Yet if it is unknown what thought is expressed\nby (II), one can hardly be justified in accepting the\nthought. Hence, the skeptic cannot simultaneously hold (III) and be\njustified in accepting (II). (Ebbs also makes the analogous point\nabout the justification for (I), followed by similar objections and\nreplies. But for brevity\u2019s sake, we shall just consider\n(II).)\n\nThe skeptic might offer two different replies to the self-undermining\ncharge. The first is that, although the exact content of (II) may be\nunknown, the skeptic can still be justified in accepting (II)\n(Brueckner 1997b). For it seems that (II) can be shown true, no matter\nwhether the skeptic speaks English or Twin English. After all,\nregardless of what \u2018water\u2019 denotes, it is true to say\n\u201c \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought that\nwater is scrumptious.\u201d Moreover, since the skeptic can recognize\nthis from the armchair, it seems he can be justified in accepting\n(II), even while assuming (III).\n\nBut to the contrary, it is possible to imagine \u201cweird\nworlds\u201d where (II) ends up false (Ebbs 2001). Consider a world\nmuch like this one, where H2O fills the lakes and rivers,\netc., and where \u2018water\u2019 refers to H2O. The\ndifference is that \u2018Earth\u2019 in this weird world does not\ndenote the planet that the skeptic currently occupies. Rather, it\ndenotes Twin Earth. In that case, when the skeptic states (II), the\nproposition expressed is that if he is on Twin Earth, then\nasserting \u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 expresses the thought\nthat water (i.e. H2O) is scrumptious. (Remember\nthat \u2018water\u2019 in this scenario still denotes\nH2O.) Yet if that is what (II) expresses, then the skeptic\nsays something false. And so, since the skeptic apparently\ncannot exclude a weird world from the armchair, he cannot prove to\nhimself that (II) is true. So once more, the skeptic cannot\njustifiably adopt (II) while assuming (III).\n\nThe skeptic has a second line of reply to the self-undermining charge,\nwhich takes the form of a dilemma. Observe that \u2018water is\nscrumptious\u2019 either expresses the content that the skeptic\nthinks it expresses, or not. If it does, then (II) is true\u2014and\nso, in conjunction with (I) and (III), the slow switch argument\nremains standing (Brueckner 2003). On the other hand, suppose that\n\u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 does not express the content that\nthe skeptic thinks it does. That just means he has a false belief\nabout the content of his first order thought. So he lacks knowledge of\nits content (since knowledge requires truth). And thus SK is false in\nthis case too. Consequently, on either horn of the dilemma, SK is\nthreatened (Brueckner 2003).\n\nNevertheless, the skeptic could not justifiably claim that (I)-(III)\nfigure into a sound argument (Ebbs 2005). For at this stage, the\nskeptic has conceded that (II) might not be true. Even so, it seems\nthat he can justifiably identify a different argument as a sound\nskeptical argument, namely, the dilemma offered above (Brueckner\n2007).\n\nSo has the skeptic escaped the self-undermining charge? There may\nstill be a question about the skeptic\u2019s adoption of (III). It\nmay seem that this is entirely justified, but why is that exactly?\nApparently, it is because the skeptic is justified in thinking that\n\u2018water is scrumptious\u2019 might express a different thought\nthan the one it actually expresses on Earth, viz., that water is wet.\nYet notice that this last bit assumes (II) (Brueckner & Ebbs,\n2012, ch. 12). But at this stage, the skeptic has already conceded\nthat (II) might be false, due to the possibility of a \u201cweird\nworld.\u201d So if (III) is justifiably believed only if (II)\nis\u2014and (II) was already surrendered\u2014then the skeptic must\nconcede the justification for (III). So a kind of self-undermining\nworry remains (Brueckner & Ebbs, ch. 12. For a response, see ch.\n13).\n",
