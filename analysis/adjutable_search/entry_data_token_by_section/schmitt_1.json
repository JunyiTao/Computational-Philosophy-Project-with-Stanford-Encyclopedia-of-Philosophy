Sovereignty and Dictatorship\n\n\nModern liberal constitutions do not acknowledge a bearer of sovereign\nauthority, and modern legal and constitutional theory has often tried\nto dispense with the concept. But Schmitt argues, in Political\nTheology, that such attempts to get rid of sovereignty cannot be\nsuccessful. In Schmitt\u2019s view, there can be no functioning legal order\nwithout a sovereign authority (PT 5\u201335; Dyzenhaus 1997,\n42\u201351; McCormick 1997, 121\u201356; Hofmann 2002, 49\u201364;\nKennedy 2004, 54\u201391; Kahn 2011, 31\u201361; Croce and Salvatore\n2013, 13\u201329; Vinx 2015). According to Schmitt, liberal constitutionalists\ntypically hold that all legitimate particular acts of state must apply\ngeneral legal norms, so that people are subject only to the\ndeterminate and predictable demands of the law, not to the potentially\narbitrary authority of persons (PT 18\u201326; see also CT\n169\u201396, CPD 33\u201350). This view overlooks, Schmitt argues,\nthat general legal norms often fail to provide determinate guidance\nwithout considerable interpretation and interstitial legislation (PT\n29\u201335; GU 21\u201343). In order for the law to become\neffective, there needs to be an authority that decides how to apply\ngeneral legal rules to concrete cases and how to deal with problems of\ncontested interpretation or under-determination. However, the material\ncontent of the law does not itself determine who is to interpret and\nto apply it. Hence, a sovereign authority prior to the law is needed\nto decide how to apply general legal norms to particular cases (PT\n29\u201335).\n This argument appears to assume that all legal norms are material\nnorms providing substantive grounds of legal decision. But modern\nlegal systems typically contain norms of competence in addition to\nmaterial norms. Hence, it seems that the view that all legitimate\npolitical authority depends on legal authorization is not as\nindefensible as Schmitt suggests (Kaufmann 1988, 337\u201345). The\nlaw can determine, for any material legal norm, which person or\ninstitution has the competence to interpret and apply it. Subjects of\nthe law may admittedly have to accept that a final decision might turn\nout to be binding even though wrong. And in this limited sense,\nSchmitt is right to appeal to Hobbes\u2019s dictum that it is authority and\nnot truth that makes the law.  (PT 33\u20134) But that a legal\nsystem, through its norms of competence, provides for the\nauthoritative interpretation of its material legal norms hardly\nentails that it must contain a sovereign in the traditional\nunderstanding of that term. Schmitt\u2019s implicit reply to this objection\nclaims that the applicability of legal norms presupposes a general\ncondition of social normality. Legal norms, Schmitt argues, cannot be\napplied to a chaos. They require a \u201chomogeneous medium.\u201d\n(PT 13) No legal norm, in Schmitt\u2019s view, can govern an extreme case\nof emergency or an absolute state of exception. In a completely\nabnormal situation, the continued application of the law through the\nnormal administrative and judiciary channels is going to lead to\nhaphazard and unpredictable results, while preventing effective action\nto end the emergency (PT 13; GU 44\u2013114; Scheuerman 1996; Hofmann\n2002, 17\u201333). If the applicability of material legal norms\npresupposes a condition of normality, Schmitt assumes, a polity must\nbe entitled to decide whether to suspend the application of its law on\nthe ground that the situation is abnormal. Hence Schmitt\u2019s famous\ndefinition of sovereignty, according to which the sovereign is he who\ndecides on the state of exception: If there is some person or\ninstitution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total\nsuspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize\nthe situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in\nthat polity (PT 5). Any legal order, Schmitt bluntly concludes, is\nbased on a sovereign decision and not on a legal norm (PT 10,\n12\u20133).\n\n\nOne might reply to this line of thought that it is perfectly\npossible to establish legal conditions for the declaration of a state\nof emergency as well as legal constraints on the permissible means of\ndealing with an emergency. Schmitt argues, though, that attempts to\nlegalize the exceptional situation are doomed to failure. It is\nimpossible to anticipate the nature of future emergencies and to\ndetermine in advance what means might be necessary to deal with them.\nAs a result, the positive law can at best determine who is to decide\nwhether there is an emergency that requires a wholesale suspension of\nthe law. But the sovereign decision cannot be guided by existing\nmaterial law (PT 11\u20132). In Schmitt\u2019s view, it is not even necessary for\nthe law to determine who can take a decision on the exception. There\ncan be a sovereign authority, in a jurisprudentially relevant sense,\neven where such an authority is not recognized by positive\nconstitutional law. All that matters is whether there is a person or\ninstitution that possesses the ability, as a matter of fact, to take a\ndecision on the exception. If a sovereign, so understood, exists, its\nauthority to suspend the law does not stand in need of positive legal\nrecognition, since the law\u2019s applicability itself depends on a\nsituation of normality secured by the sovereign (PT 12\u20133). What about\ncases, though, where sovereignty is not just unrecognized in positive\nlaw but where there is no one, as a matter of fact, who could\nsuccessfully take a decision to suspend the law altogether? This\ncondition seems to apply in many contemporary western democracies.\nPerhaps such polities are ill-prepared to deal with radical\nemergencies. But it would be implausible to conclude that they do not\npossess a legal order. Schmitt\u2019s full response to this objection will\nonly become clear from his discussion of \u2018the political.\u2019 The objection\nsuggests, however, that Schmitt\u2019s claims about sovereignty cannot\nplausibly be understood as claims about the presuppositions of the mere\nfactual existence of a legal system. Schmitt must be arguing that\nwherever the situation of normality or homogeneity that makes the\nresults of the application of law determinate and predictable is no\nlonger guaranteed by a sovereign, the positive legal system, consisting\nof material norms and of positive norms of competence, can no longer be\nlegitimate (Mauss 1980, 81\u2013121; Scheuerman 1999, 15\u201337; Hofmann\n2002).\n If the sovereign\u2019s decision on the exception is not subject to any\nmaterial legal constraint, the power to decide on the state of\nexception is tantamount to the power to decide what should count as a\nstate of exception (PT 13; Norris 2007). A sovereign\u2019s view on this\nissue, however, must be responsive to prevailing social attitudes. If\nit were not, a sovereign could hardly possess the factual capability\nto suspend the law and to act successfully against the perceived\nemergency. To do so, his decision will need to be supported by a\nsufficiently large and powerful constituency. Nevertheless, the need\nfor sovereign decision will be greatest in a society torn by serious\nideological or social conflict. And if there is no unanimity among\nsocial groups as to what situation to perceive as normal or\nexceptional, the sovereign decision will inevitably have to side with\none group\u2019s conception of normality against that of another. The\nsovereign creation of a condition of normality, in other words,\nconstitutes a community\u2019s political identity and it is likely to do so\nthrough the forcible suppression of those whose conception of\nnormality differs from the sovereign\u2019s (D 132\u201347). The question\nof the legitimacy of law thus turns on the question of the legitimacy\nof an identity-constituting sovereign exercise of foundational\nviolence.\n\n\nSchmitt admits that the principle of democracy is the only principle\nof legitimacy that is available as an ideological basis for a\ncontemporary constitution (PT 50\u20132; CPD 22\u201332). If\nSchmitt\u2019s conception of sovereignty is to be defensible, it must\ntherefore be given a democratic interpretation. But it is difficult to\nsee how this could be possible. The only candidate for sovereignty in\na democratic polity is the popular sovereign, composed of politically\nequal citizens. A popular sovereign, it seems, cannot be a Schmittian\nsovereign, as it will only be able to decide under existing\nconstitutional rules that determine how the people as a collective are\nto form a unified will.  Schmitt prepared the groundwork for a\nsolution to this problem in Dictatorship, his historical\nstudy of the development of the institution of dictatorship (McCormick\n1997, 121\u201356; Cristi 1998 108\u201325; Kalyvas 2008,\n88\u2013126; Kelly 2016).\n Dictatorial power in its original, Roman form is a formally\ndelegated and time-limited power to defend an already existing\nrepublican constitution through the use of extra-legal force (D\nxlii\u2013xliv, 1\u201319). A Roman dictator, then, was clearly not a sovereign\nin Schmitt\u2019s sense of the term. In the course of modern constitutional\nhistory, however, the institution of dictatorship, Schmitt claims,\nfused with sovereignty, and this fusion related sovereignty to\ndemocracy. The first step towards this fusion, in Schmitt\u2019s account,\nwas the use of commissarial dictatorship in the early modern\nabsolutist state. The absolutist sovereign did possess the sovereign\npower to decide on the exception, and was thus capable of authorizing\ncommissars to use dictatorial methods in his name. But the notions of\ndictatorship and sovereignty were not yet fused. The commissarial\ndictators of the absolutist sovereign were mere agents of the\nsovereign and did not themselves possess the power to decide on the\nexception. The absolutist sovereign, in turn, though he had the power\nto decide on the exception, was not himself a dictator; first of all\nsince he did not decide under someone else\u2019s but by his own authority,\nand secondly because he was of course expected to rely on legal\ngovernance as his normal mode of operation (D 20\u201333). But the\nrelation between sovereignty and dictatorship changed in the French\nrevolution. The revolutionary governments relied heavily on\ndictatorial action to create a new situation of normality that would\nallow a new constitution to come into force. The revolutionary\ngovernments, like the absolutist sovereign, claimed the power to\ndecide on the exception, but they did not claim to be\nsovereign. Rather, they claimed to exercise the authority to decide on\nthe exception in the name of the French people, even while they were\nruling the French people by the use of dictatorial methods (D\n132\u201347). Sovereignty and dictatorship had become fused in the\nnovel institution of sovereign dictatorship: A sovereign dictator is a\ndictator who does not defend an already existing constitution but\nattempts to create a new one and who does so not by his own authority\nbut in the name of the people (D 112\u201331).\n\n\nSovereign dictatorship, in Schmitt\u2019s view, is an eminently\ndemocratic institution. It can exist only where it has become possible\nto take a sovereign decision on the exception in the name of the\npeople. Sovereignty, Schmitt concludes, is not just compatible with\ndemocracy but central to it, as it is exercised whenever and wherever a\ndemocratic constitution is founded (CT 109\u201310, 265\u20136; CPD 32). The fact\nthat a democratic constitution cannot endow a particular person with\npermanent sovereign authority does not entail that the possibility of a\ngenuine sovereign decision on the exception has disappeared. It merely\nimplies that a decision on the exception in the democratic state must\ntake the form of an exercise of the people\u2019s constituent power.\n",
