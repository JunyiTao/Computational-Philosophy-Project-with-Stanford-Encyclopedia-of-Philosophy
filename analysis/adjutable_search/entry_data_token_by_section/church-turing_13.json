    "main_text": "Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of effective method and decision method || Hilbert and the G\u00f6ttingen group\n2.5 Hilbert and the G\u00f6ttingen group\n\nIt was largely Hilbert who first drew attention to the need for a\nprecise analysis of the idea of an effective decision method. In a\nlecture he gave in Zurich in 1917, to the Swiss Mathematical Society,\nhe emphasized the need to study the concept of \u201cdecidability by\na finite number of operations\u201d,\nsaying\u2014accurately\u2014that this would be \u201can important\nnew field of research to develop\u201d (Hilbert 1917: 415). The\nlecture considered a number of what he called \u201cmost challenging\nepistemological problems of a specifically mathematical\ncharacter\u201d (1917: 412). Pre-eminent among these was the\n\u201cproblem of the decidability [Entscheidbarkeit] of a\nmathematical question\u201d because the problem \u201ctouches\nprofoundly upon the nature of mathematical thinking\u201d (1917:\n413).\n\nHilbert and his G\u00f6ttingen group looked back on Leibniz as the\noriginator of their approach to logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. Behmann, a prominent member of the group, said that\nLeibniz had anticipated modern symbolic logic (Behmann 1921:\n4\u20135). Leibniz\u2019s hypothesized \u201cuniversal\ncharacteristic\u201d or universal symbolistic was a universal\nsymbolic language, in conception akin to languages used in\nmathematical logic and computer science today. Hilbert and Ackermann\nacknowledged Leibniz\u2019s influence on the first page of their\nGrundz\u00fcge der Theoretischen Logik, saying \u201cThe\nidea of a mathematical logic was first put into a clear form by\nLeibniz\u201d (Hilbert & Ackermann 1928: 1). Cassirer said that\nin Hilbert\u2019s work \u201cthe fundamental idea of Leibniz\u2019s\n\u2018universal characteristic\u2019 is taken up anew and attains a\nsuccinct and precise expression\u201d (Cassirer 1929: 440). It was in\nthe writings of the G\u00f6ttingen group that Leibniz\u2019s idea of\nan effective method for answering any specified mathematical or\nscientific question found its fullest development (see further the\n Supplement).\n\nHilbert\u2019s earliest publication to mention what we would now call\na decision problem is his 1899 book Grundlagen der Geometrie\n[Foundations of Geometry]. He said that in the course of his\ninvestigations of Euclidean geometry he was\n\n\nguided by the principle of discussing each given question in such a\nway that we examined both whether it can or cannot be answered by\nmeans of prescribed steps using certain limited resources. (Hilbert\n1899: 89)\n\n\nConcerning a specific example, he wrote:\n\n\nSuppose a geometrical construction problem that can be carried out\nwith a compass is presented; we will attempt to lay down a criterion\nthat enables us to determine [beurteilen] immediately, from\nthe analytical nature of the problem and its solutions, whether the\nconstruction can also be carried out using only a ruler and a\nsegment-transferrer. (Hilbert 1899: 85\u201386)\n\n\nHe described what would now be called an effective method for\ndetermining this, and his term \u201cbeurteilen\u201d\ncould, with a trace of anachronism, be translated as\n\u201cdecide\u201d.\n\nHilbert expressed the concept of a decision method more clearly the\nfollowing year, in his famous turn-of-the-century speech in Paris, to\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians. He presented\ntwenty-three unsolved problems, \u201cfrom the discussion of which an\nadvancement of science may be expected\u201d. The tenth on his list\n(now known universally as Hilbert\u2019s Tenth Problem) was:\n\n\nGiven a diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and\nwith rational integral numerical coefficients: To devise a process\naccording to which it can be determined by a finite number of\noperations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.\n(Hilbert 1900: 276 [trans. 1902: 458])\n\n\nThe Entscheidungsproblem was coming into even clearer focus by the\ntime Hilbert\u2019s student Behmann published a landmark article in\n1922, \u201cContributions to the Algebra of Logic, in particular to\nthe Entscheidungsproblem\u201d. It was probably Behmann who coined\nthe term \u201cEntscheidungsproblem\u201d (Mancosu & Zach 2015:\n166\u2013167). In a 1921 lecture to the G\u00f6ttingen group, Behmann\nsaid:\n\n\nIf a logical or mathematical statement is given, the required\nprocedure should give complete instructions for determining whether\nthe statement is correct or false by a deterministic calculation after\nfinitely many steps. The problem thus formulated I want to call the\nallgemeine Entscheidungsproblem [general decision problem].\n(Behmann 1921: 6 [trans. 2015: 176])\n\n\nPeirce, as we saw, spoke of a procedure\u2019s forming \u201csuch a\ncomprehensive routine that it would be easy to define a machine that\nwould perform it\u201d. His work was well-known in G\u00f6ttingen:\nHilbert and Ackermann said that Peirce \u201cespecially\u201d, and\nalso Jevons, had \u201cenriched the young science\u201d of\nmathematical logic (1928: 1). Like Peirce, Behmann used the concept of\na machine to clarify the nature of the Entscheidungsproblem. \u201cIt\nis essential to the character\u201d of the problem, Behmann said,\nthat \u201conly entirely mechanical calculation according to given\ninstructions\u201d is involved. The decision whether the statement is\ntrue or false becomes \u201ca mere exercise in computation\u201d;\nthere is \u201can elimination of thinking in favor of mechanical\ncalculation\u201d. Behmann continued:\n\n\nOne might, if one wanted to, speak of mechanical or machine-like\nthinking. (Perhaps one can one day even let it be carried out by a\nmachine.) (Behmann 1921: 6\u20137 [trans. 2015: 176])\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Llullian idea of a machine that could calculate the\ntruth was suddenly at the forefront of early twentieth century\nmathematics.\n",
