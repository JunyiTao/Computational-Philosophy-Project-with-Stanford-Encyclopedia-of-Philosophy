Intentions as Plans\n\nHaving criticized Davidson\u2019s theory, Bratman offers a diagnosis\nof his mistake that appeals to the functional role of intention as a\nmental state. According to Bratman (1985, \u00a7VI), Davidson neglects\nthe place of prospective intentions in cross-temporal and\ninter-personal coordination, and as inputs to further practical\nthought. There is room for doubt about this verdict, since all-out\nevaluative judgement may well appear as a premise of practical\nsyllogism (\u2018I ought to do A; doing B is a\nmeans to that; so I ought to do B\u2019) and since it may\nsustain \u2018diachronic autonomy,\u2019 at least to some extent,\njust through the working of memory (a point emphasized by Ferrero\n2006). But Bratman is right to indicate a gap in Davidson\u2019s\nstory, which he has done more than anyone to fill.\n\nFor Bratman (1987), intention is a distinctive practical attitude\nmarked by its pivotal role in planning for the future. Intention\ninvolves desire, but even predominant desire is insufficient for\nintention, since it need not involve a commitment to act: intentions\nare \u2018conduct-controlling pro-attitudes, ones which we are\ndisposed to retain without reconsideration, and which play a\nsignificant role as inputs to [means-end] reasoning\u2019 (Bratman\n1987, p. 20). The plans for action contained in our intentions are\ntypically partial and must be filled out in accordance with changing\ncircumstances as the future comes.\n\nAmong the advantages of being able to commit ourselves to action in\nadvance, albeit defeasibly, are: (i) the capacity to make rational\ndecisions for circumstances in which we cannot deliberate, or that\nlend themselves to deliberative distortion; (ii) the capacity to\nengage in complex, temporally extended projects that require\ncoordination with our future selves; and (iii) the capacity for\nsimilar coordination with others.\n\nBratman (1987) argues that these advantages are best secured if our\nintentions are consistent with one another and with our beliefs, if\nthey conform to principles of means-end coherence\u2014for instance,\nthat when we intend E and believe that intending M\nis necessary to achieve E, we also intend M, and if\nthey are resistant to reconsideration. There is, he claims, a\n\u2018pragmatic rationale\u2019 for such requirements, \u2018one\ngrounded in [their] long-run contribution to getting what we\n(rationally) want\u2019 (Bratman 1987, p. 35).\n\nResponses to Bratman\u2019s theory have focused largely on the nature\nof these alleged requirements. Bratman (1987, \u00a72.5) argues that\nintentions do not provide inputs to practical reasoning by providing\nadditional reasons. This conception is, on the one hand, too weak,\nsince it treats the fact that I have settled on doing A as\njust one consideration among many in favour of doing it, whereas\nmeans-end coherence is a strict or peremptory demand. And it is, on\nthe other hand, too strong, since it permits a form of illicit\nbootstrapping in which an irrational decision can generate a reason\nthat tips the balance in favour of acting on it. (Do intentions ever\nprovide reasons? Many deny this; see, for instance, Broome 2001;\nBrunero 2007; Cullity 2008; Kolodny 2011. But Bratman\u2019s argument\nleaves room for such reasons, so long as the actions they support\nwould be rational without them. For versions of this point, see Chang\n2009; Ferrero 2010; Smith 2016.)\n\nBratman\u2019s pragmatic theory gives intentions a substantive role\nin practical thought without treating them as reasons. But it faces\nproblems of its own. In structure, Bratman\u2019s theory is akin to\nthe variety of rule-utilitarianism on which we have utilitarian\ngrounds for adopting a practice of punishment or promising that\nsometimes goes against considerations of utility. This structure\nprompts a serious dilemma. If reasons for adopting a practice or\npattern of reasoning transmit to the actions or inferences that fall\nunder it, as Rawls (1955) once argued, the problems of bootstrapping\nand peremptoriness return. All we have is a theory of why\nintentions provide reasons. But if reasons do not transmit in this\nway, the picture appears to be one of \u2018rational\nirrationality\u2019: having reason to adopt or sustain an irrational\npattern of reasoning, on the ground that the results of doing so are\nmostly for the best. Neither option is appealing.\n\nIn his 1987 book, Bratman in effect pursued the second path, hoping to\nsoften its peculiarity by distinguishing \u2018internal\u2019 and\n\u2018external\u2019 perspectives on rationality and deliberation\n(Bratman 1987, \u00a73.5). More recently, he has argued that the\nbenefits of consistency and coherence are more than pragmatic, since\nthey allow for a form of self-governance that is of non-instrumental\nvalue (Bratman 2009b), and that they are closely tied to the\nfunctional role of intentions as plans (Bratman 2009c,\n\u00a7\u00a7VIII\u2013IX). He also adopts John Broome\u2019s (2004)\nidea that the relevant norms take \u2018wide scope.\u2019 For\ninstance, it is irrational to [intend E, believe that\nintending M is necessary to achieve E, and not\nintend M]. It does not follow from this that, if one intends\nE, one is under rational pressure to intend the necessary\nmeans, since one can just as well avoid the forbidden combination of\nattitudes by giving up one\u2019s intention for the end. By the same\ntoken, there is no need to admit that intentions provide reasons for\nacting. We thus avoid both horns of the dilemma sketched above. How\nfar this strategy succeeds is a matter of ongoing dispute (Setiya\n2007b; Bratman 2009b; Brunero 2010; Way 2010). There is also a\nquestion how far Bratman\u2019s functional explanation of means-end\nrationality commits him to a wider form of rationalism or\n\u2018constitutivism\u2019 about practical reason (Setiya 2014;\nBratman 2018).\n\nA further objection to the demands for consistency and coherence in\nintention turns on an implication that Bratman (1987, Ch. 8) himself\ndraws out. According to the Simple View, doing A\nintentionally involves an intention whose object is A. As\nBratman argues, however, it is sometimes rational to attempt both\nA and B, hoping to achieve one or the other, when I\nknow that I cannot do both. If I succeed in doing A, I will\nhave done so intentionally, and thus, on the Simple View, I must have\nintended to do A. Considerations of symmetry imply that I\nalso intended to do B. But then my intentions are not jointly\nconsistent with my beliefs. Bratman concludes that the Simple View is\nfalse, since it would be irrational to have such intentions. Instead,\nI intend to try doing A and to try doing B, knowing\nthat I can make both attempts, though both cannot succeed. Bratman\nadmits that, when I try to do A, I take the relevant means\n\u2018with the intention\u2019 of doing it. But he finds this phrase\nambiguous. On one reading, it ascribes the intention to do A,\nbut in the present case it does not. Instead, I merely\n\u2018endeavour\u2019 to do A, where this is a matter of\n\u2018guiding desire\u2019 (Bratman 1987, Ch. 9).\n\nThe main objection to this view, pressed forcefully by Hugh McCann\n(1991), is that it generates an unhappy proliferation of\nintention-like states, and that, by finding ambiguity in\n\u2018intention with which,\u2019 it fails to unify the guises of\nintention. What is more, there are natural alternatives. One equates\nintention with guiding desire, defends the Simple View, and finds the\nrequirement of consistency defeasible. There is rational pressure to\nconform to it, in general, but this pressure can be outweighed, as\nwhen it makes sense to intend both A and B, despite\ntheir manifest inconsistency, hoping to achieve just one. Another\nalternative appeals to partial intention, by analogy with partial\nbelief (see Holton 2009; Goldstein 2016; Shpall 2016; Archer 2017;\nMu\u00f1oz 2018). There is also room for a more radical view, on\nwhich the reasons for being consistent in one\u2019s intentions, or\nconforming to means-end coherence, reduce to the reasons for acting in\none way or another: Bratman\u2019s alleged requirements are a\n\u2018myth\u2019 (Raz 2005; Kolodny 2008; Tenenbaum 2014).\n\nOther puzzles concern the formulation and defense of diachronic\nrequirements of rationality for intention: the idea that intentions\nshould persist over time, resisting reconsideration, especially in\nlight of temptations they were designed to forestall. (On the nature\nof such requirements, see Holton 2009; Broome 2013: Ch. 10; Paul\n2014b; Bratman 2018; Tenenbaum 2020; Brunero forthcoming.) The idea\nthat intentions resist reconsideration creates potential moral risks:\nwhat if they make us insensitive or indifferent to changing moral\nreasons? (See Bok 1996; Paul 2017.) What do ethical concerns of this\nkind mean for the role of intention in diachronic autonomy or\nself-governance?\n\nA final objection to Bratman\u2019s theory is more general, and would\napply as well to the theory of intention as guiding desire. The\nquestion is whether such accounts reveal the unity of intentional\naction, intention for the future, and intention-with-which.\nMcCann\u2019s objection concerned the latter. The more basic\nobjection is about the role of intention in intentional action.\nBratman (1987, Ch. 8) does not ignore this connection: he proposes\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for doing A intentionally\nthat rely on the state of intending, though not always the intention\nof doing A itself. But it is open to question how deep the\nenvisaged unity goes. Why must there be intention in intentional\naction, if intentions are plans? (See Velleman 2007, \u00a73.)\n\nA partial answer cites the need for direction and guidance in doing\nanything that takes time or requires the selection of means. But it is\nnot clear that such guidance requires intention (see Bratman 1987, pp.\n126\u20137 on spontaneous action). Nor would this forge a general\nconnection between the state of intending and the phenomenon of acting\nfor reasons or the application of Anscombe\u2019s (1963, p. 9)\nquestion \u2018Why?\u2019 If S is doing A on the\nground that p, she is doing it intentionally. Bratman\u2019s\nconditions do not explain why intention must be involved in the\nantecedent of this conditional. Why must reasons attach to what I am\ndoing by way of plans or guiding desires? One response is to admit\nthat they may not: there can be intentional action without intention\n(see Bratman 2000, pp. 51\u20132). But if we hope to unify intention\nwith intentional action, we cannot accept this. Intention must figure\nin the correct account of acting for a reason, and thus intentionally.\nIn order to avoid disunity, the theory of intentions as plans (or as\nguiding desires) needs such an account.\n",
