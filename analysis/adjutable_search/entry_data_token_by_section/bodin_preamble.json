    "main_text": "\n\n\nJean Bodin (1529/30\u20131596) was a lawyer, economist, natural\nphilosopher, historian, and one of the major political theorists of\nthe sixteenth century. There are two reasons why Bodin remains both\nfascinating and enigmatic: on the one hand, aspects of his life remain\nshrouded in legend; on the other, misunderstandings about his thought\nand political positions have engendered contradictions and\ndiscrepancies amongst historians which have been attributed mistakenly\nto Bodin himself. His most significant work, The Six Books of the\nCommonwealth (Les Six livres de la R\u00e9publique,\n1576), represents the sum total of legal and political thought of the\nFrench Renaissance. His Method for the Easy Comprehension of\nHistory (Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem,\n1566) is at the pinnacle of early-modern, European humanism\u2019s Ars\nhistorica. Finally, his work \u2014 if he was genuinely really\nthe author \u2014 Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the\nSublime (Colloquium Heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis\nabditis, 1683), which was published posthumously, provides clues\nabout his own religious views.  Bodin\u2019s spiritual beliefs did not\ncoincide with any official religion of his day, but instead resembled\na form of natural religion.\n\n In this entry, we cite Bodin\u2019s original works and their translations\nby using abbreviations.  These abbreviations are defined in the first\ntwo subsections of the Bibliography.  For example, Methodus\nwill refer to the original work in Latin (Methodus ad facilem\nhistoriarum cognitionem), while [Re] will refer to the\nB. Reynolds 1945 translation of Methodus into English and\n[Me] will refer to the P. Mesnard\u2019s entire 1951 volume of French\ntranslations.\n",
