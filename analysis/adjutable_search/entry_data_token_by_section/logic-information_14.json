    "main_text": "Connections Between the Approaches || Code and correlations\n4.2 Code and correlations\n\nLogical frameworks that crossover information as code and information\nas correlation get their most explicit representation in work that\ndoes just this\u2014model the crossover between the two frameworks.\nRestall (1994) and Mares (1996) give independent proofs of the\nrepresentability of Barwise\u2019s information as correlation\nchannel-theoretic framework within the information as code approach as\nexemplified by the substructural logics framework. In this section we\nwill trace the motivations and the main details of the proof, before\ndemonstrating the connection with category theory.\n\nThe basic steps are these\u2014if we understand information channels\nto be information states of a special sort, namely the sort of\ninformation state that carries information of conditional types, then\nthere is an obvious meeting point between information as correlation\nas exemplified by channel theory, and information as code as\nexemplified by informationalised substructural logics. The\nintermediate step is to reveal the connection between channel\nsemantics for conditional types, and the frame semantics for\nconditionals given by relevance logics.\n\nStarting with the channel theoretic analysis of conditionals, as noted\nalready, the running motivation behind Barwise\u2019s\nchannel-theoretic framework is that information flow is underpinned by\nan information channel. Barwise understood conditionals as\nconstraints in the sense that \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is a\nconstraint from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) in the sense of \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\)\nfrom\n section 2.2\n above. If the information that \\(A\\) is combined with the information\nencoded by the constraint, then the result or output is the\ninformation that \\(B\\).\n\nThe information that \\(A\\) and that \\(B\\) is carried by the situations\n\\(s_1, s_2\\ldots\\). and the information encoded by the constraint is\ncarried by an information channel \\(c\\). Given this, Barwise\u2019s\nevaluation condition for a constraint is as follows (the condition is\ngiven here in Barwise\u2019s notation from his later work on\nconditionals, although in earlier writings such conditions appeared in\nthe notation given in\n section 2.2\n above): \n\\[\\tag{15} c \\models A \\rightarrow B \\text{ iff for all } s_1, s_2, \\text{ if } s_1 \\stackrel{c}{\\mapsto} s_2 \\text{ and } s_1 \\models A, \\text{ then } s_2 \\models B, \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(s_1 \\stackrel{c}{\\mapsto} s_2\\) is read as\n\nthe information carried by the channel \\(c\\), when combined with the\ninformation carried by the situation \\(s_1\\), results in the\ninformation carried by the situation \\(s_2\\).\n\nObviously enough, this is very close in spirit to (9) in the section\non information as code above.\n\nAs noted above, the intermediate step concerns the ternary relation\n\\(R\\) from the early semantics for relevance logic. The semantic\nclause for the conditional from relevance logic is: \n\\[\\tag{16} x \\Vdash A \\rightarrow B \\text{ iff for all } y, z \\in \\mathbf{F} \\text{ s.t. } Rxyz, \\text{ if } y \\Vdash A \\text{ then } z \\Vdash B. \\]\n\n\n\\(Rxyz\\) is, by itself, simply an abstract mathematical entity. One\nway or reading it, the way that became popular in relevance logic\ncircles, is\n\n\\(Rxyz\\) iff the result of combining \\(x\\) with \\(y\\) is true at\n\\(z\\).\n\nGiven that the points of evaluation in relevance logics were\nunderstood originally as impossible situations (since they may be both\ninconsistent and incomplete), the main conceptual move was to\nunderstand channels to be special types of situations. The full proofs\nmay be found in Restall (1994) and Mares (1996), and these demonstrate\nthat the expressive power of Barwise\u2019s system may be captured by\nthe frame semantics of relevance logic. What it is that such\n\u201ccombining\u201d of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) amounts to depends on, of\ncourse, which structural rules are operating on the frame in question.\nAs explained in the previous section above, the choice of which rules\nto include will depend on the properties of the phenomena being\nmodelled.\n\nThe final step required for locating the meeting point between\ninformation as code and information as correlation is as follows.\nContemporary approaches to relevance and other substructural logics\nunderstand the points of evaluation (impossible situations) to be\ninformation states. There is certainly no constraint on information\nthat it be complete or consistent, so the expressibility of impossible\nsituations it not sacrificed. Such an informational reading (Paoli\n2002; Restall 2000; Mares 2004) lends itself to multiple applications\nof various substructural frameworks, and also does away with the\nontological baggage brought by questions like \u201cwhat are\nimpossible situations?\u201d in the \u201cWhat are possible\nworlds?\u201d spirit. An information-state reading of \\(Rxyz\\) will\nbe something like\n\nthe result of combining the information carried by \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\ngenerates the informations carried by \\(z\\).\n\nMaking this explicit results in \\(Rxyz\\) being written down as \\(x\n\\bullet y \\sqsubseteq z\\), in which case (15) is, via (16), equivalent\nto (9).\n\nAn important structural rule for the composition operation on\ninformation channels, that is, on information states that carry\ninformation of conditional types, is that it is associative. What this\nmeans is that: \n\\[\\tag{17} z \\stackrel{x \\bullet (y \\bullet v)}{\\longmapsto} w = z \\stackrel{(x \\bullet y) \\bullet v}{\\longmapsto} w. \\]\n\n\nWhere \\(z \\Vdash A\\) and \\(w \\Vdash D\\), this will be the case for all\n\\(x, y, v\\) s.t. \\(x \\Vdash A \\rightarrow\\), \\(y \\Vdash B \\rightarrow\nC\\), \\(v \\Vdash C \\rightarrow D\\). This is just the first step\nrequired to demonstrate that channel theory, and its underlying\nsubstructural logic, form a category.\n\nCategory theory is an extremely powerful tool in its own right. For a\nthorough introduction see Awodey (2006). For more work on the\nrelationship between various substructural logics and channel theory,\nsee Restall (1994a, 1997, 2006). Further category-theoretic work on\ninformation flow may be found in Goguen (2004\u2014see Other Internet\nResources). Recent important work on category-theoretic frameworks for\ninformation flow that extend to quantifiable/probabilistic\nframeworks is due to Seligman (2009). Perhaps the most in depth\ntreatment of information flow in category theoretic terms is to be\nfound in the work of Samson Abramsky, and an excellent overview may be\nfound in his \u201cInformation, Processes, and Games\u201d (2008).\nRecent work on the intersection between information as code and\ninformation as correlation uses substructural logics (relevance and\nlinear logics in particular) to model logical proofs as information\nsources themselves. A proof is a source of information par\nexcellence, and the contributions in the area by Mares (2016) are\nvital.\n",
