    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\nLittle is known of Heraclitus\u2019 life; most of what has been\nhanded down consists of stories apparently invented to illustrate his\ncharacter as inferred from his writings (Diogenes Laertius\n9.1\u201317). His native Ephesus was a prominent city of Ionia, the\nGreek-inhabited coast of Asia Minor, but was subject to Persian rule\nin his lifetime. According to one account, he inherited the honorific\ntitle and office of \u201cking\u201d of the Ionians, which he\nresigned to his brother. He is generally considered to have favored\naristocratic government as against democracy, based on his own\npolitical observations. \n\nHis city lies close to Miletus, where the first thinkers recognized in\nlater tradition as philosophers lived; but there is no record of his\nhaving made the acquaintance of any of the Milesian thinkers (Thales,\nAnaximander, Anaximenes) or having been taught by them, or of his ever\nhaving traveled.\n\nHe is said to have written a single book (papyrus roll), and deposited\nit in the great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The story is plausible\nenough: temples often served as depositories for money and other\nvaluables, and no libraries are known from the time of Heraclitus. The\nstructure of Heraclitus\u2019 book is controversial. It could have\nconsisted of a relatively coherent and consecutive argument. On the\nother hand, the numerous fragments (over one hundred) that have come\ndown to us do not easily connect with each other, even though they\nprobably constitute a sizable fraction of the whole. Thus it is\npossible and even likely that the book was composed more of sayings\nand epigrams than of continuous exposition. In its form, then, it\nmight have looked more like a collection of proverbs such as were\nascribed to the seven sages than like a cosmological treatise of the\nMilesians. Theophrastus, who knew his book, said that it seemed only\nhalf-finished, a kind of hodgepodge he attributed to the\nauthor\u2019s melancholy. Diogenes Laertius reports that the work was\ndivided (he does not say by whom) into three sections, one on\ncosmology, one on politics (and ethics), and one on theology\n(9.5\u20136). All these topics are treated in the extant fragments of\nHeraclitus, though it is often difficult to see what boundaries the\nwork might have drawn between them, since Heraclitus seems to see deep\ninterconnections between science, human affairs, and theology.\n\nUnlike most other early philosophers, Heraclitus is usually seen as\nindependent of the several schools and movements later students\n(somewhat anachronistically) assigned to the ancients, and he himself\nimplies that he is self-taught (B101). He has been variously judged by\nancient and modern commentators to be a material monist or a process\nphilosopher; a scientific cosmologist, a metaphysician, or a mainly\nreligious thinker; an empiricist, a rationalist, or a mystic; a\nconventional thinker or a revolutionary; a developer of logic or one\nwho denied the law of non-contradiction; the first genuine philosopher\nor an anti-intellectual obscurantist. No doubt the sage of Ephesus\nwill continue to remain controversial and difficult to interpret, but\nscholars have made significant progress in understanding and\nappreciating his work.\n2. Method\n\nHeraclitus made every effort to break out of the mold of contemporary\nthought. Although he was influenced in a number of ways by the thought\nand language of his predecessors, including the epic poets Homer and\nHesiod, the poet and philosopher Xenophanes, the historian and\nantiquarian Hecataeus, the religious guru Pythagoras, the sage Bias of\nPriene, the poet Archilochus, and the Milesian philosophers, he\ncriticized most of them either explicitly or implicitly, and struck\nout on his own path. He rejected polumathi\u00ea or\ninformation-gathering on the grounds that it \u201cdoes not teach\nunderstanding\u201d\n (B40).[1]\n He treated the epic poets as fools and called Pythagoras a fraud.\n\nIn his fragments Heraclitus does not explicitly criticize the\nMilesians, and it is likely that he saw them as the most progressive\nof previous thinkers. He does tacitly criticize Anaximander for not\nappreciating the role of injustice in the world (B80), while he might\nhave expressed some admiration for Thales (B38). His views can be seen\nto embody structural criticisms of Milesian principles, but even in\ncorrecting the Milesians he built on their foundations. \n\nHeraclitus\u2019 most fundamental departure from previous philosophy\nlies in his emphasis on human affairs. While he continues many of the\nphysical and cosmological theories of his predecessors, he shifts his\nfocus from the cosmic to the human realm. We might well think of him\nas the first humanist, were it not for the fact that he does not seem\nto like humanity very well. From the outset he makes it clear that\nmost people are too stupid to understand his theory. He may be most\nconcerned with the human relevance of philosophic theories, but he is\nan elitist like Plato, who thinks that only select readers are capable\nof benefitting from his teachings. And perhaps for this reason he,\nlike Plato, does not teach his philosophical principles directly, but\ncouches them in a literary form that distances the author from the\nreader. In any case he seems to regard himself not as the author of a\nphilosophy so much as the spokesman for an independent truth:\n\nHaving harkened not to me but to the Word (Logos) it is wise\nto agree that all things are one. (B50)\n\n\nHeraclitus stresses that the message is not his own invention, but a\ntimeless truth available to any who attend to the way the world itself\nis. \u201cAlthough this Word is common,\u201d he warns, \u201cthe\nmany live as if they had a private understanding\u201d (B2). The Word\n(account, message) exists apart from Heraclitus\u2019 teaching, but\nhe tries to convey that message to his audience.\n\nThe blindness of humans is one of Heraclitus\u2019 main themes. He\nannounces it at the beginning of his book:\n\nOf this Word\u2019s being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending,\nboth before they hear and once they have heard it. For although all\nthings happen according to this Word, they are like the unexperienced\nexperiencing words and deeds such as I explain when I distinguish each\nthing according to its nature and show how it is. Other men are\nunaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful\nof what they do when they are asleep. (B1)\n\n\nHe begins by warning his readers that most of them will not understand\nhis message. He promises to \u201cdistinguish each thing according to\nits nature and show how it is,\u201d a claim similar to the\nMilesians\u2019. Yet like sleepers his readers will not understand\nthe world around them. As this implies, in his book Heraclitus does\nhave some things to say about the natural world, but much more to say\nabout the human condition.\n\nNo less important than Heraclitus\u2019 message is the form in which\nhe imparts it to his audience. Aristotle noticed that even in the\nfirst sentence of B1, quoted above, the force of the word\n\u2018forever\u2019 was unclear: did it go with the preceding or the\nsubsequent words, with \u2018being\u2019 or \u2018prove\u2019\n(Rhetoric 1407b11\u201318)? He regarded the ambiguity as a\nweakness in Heraclitus\u2019 communication. But if we attend to\nHeraclitus\u2019 language we see that syntactical ambiguity is more\nthan an accident: it is a common technique he uses to enrich his words\nand to infuse them with a unique verbal complexity like that of\npoetry. Charles Kahn (1979: 89) identifies two general traits of\nHeraclitus\u2019 style, linguistic density and resonance. The former\nis his ability to pack multiple meanings into a single word or phrase,\nthe latter his ability to use one expression to evoke another. To take\na simple example:\n\nmoroi mezones mezonas moiras lanchanousi.\n\nDeaths that are greater greater portions gain. (B25)\n\n\nHeraclitus uses alliteration (four m-words in a row) and chiasmus (an\nABBA pattern) to link death and reward. The latter appears as a mirror\nimage of the former, and in sound and sense they fuse together.\nAnother fragment consists of three words in Greek:\n\n\u00eathos anthr\u00f4p\u00f4i daim\u00f4n.\n\nThe character of man is his guardian spirit. (B119)\n\n\nThe second word, in the dative case \u201cto\u201d or\n\u201cfor\u201d man, stands between the names of two very unlike\nobjects, \u2018character\u2019 and \u2018deity.\u2019\nGrammatically, it can attach to either indifferently, and seems\nintended to be heard with both, so that it counts twice. Because of\nits double role, the word forms a kind of syntactic glue between the\notherwise diverse subjects, joining them together in a unity.\nTraditionally having a good or a bad guardian spirit constitutes\none\u2019s \u201cluck\u201d\u2013one is eudaim\u00f4n or\ndusdaim\u00f4n, fortunate or wretched, at the mercy of\none\u2019s divine overseer. But Heraclitus turns one\u2019s luck\ninto a function of one\u2019s character, one\u2019s ethical stance,\nby making \u201cman\u201d the link.\n\nUltimately, Heraclitus loads his words with layers of meaning and\ncomplexities that are to be discovered in insights and solved like\nriddles. As he implies in the second sentence of his introduction, B1,\nhis logoi are designed to be experienced, not just\nunderstood, and only those who experience them in their richness will\ngrasp his message.\n3. Philosophical Principles\n\nAlthough his words are meant to provide concrete vicarious encounters\nwith the world, Heraclitus adheres to some abstract principles which\ngovern the world. Already in antiquity he was famous for advocating\nthe coincidence of opposites, the flux doctrine, and his view that\nfire is the source and nature of all things. In commenting on\nHeraclitus, Plato provided an early reading, followed tentatively by\nAristotle, and popular down to the present (sharpened and forcefully\nadvocated by Barnes 1982, ch. 4). According to Barnes\u2019 version,\nHeraclitus is a material monist who believes that all things are\nmodifications of fire. Everything is in flux (in the sense that\n\u201ceverything is always flowing in some respects,\u201d\n69), which entails the coincidence of opposites (interpreted as the\nview that \u201cevery pair of contraries is somewhere coinstantiated;\nand every object coinstantiates at least one pair of\ncontraries,\u201d 70). The coincidence of opposites, thus\ninterpreted, entails contradictions, which Heraclitus cannot avoid. On\nthis view Heraclitus is influenced by the prior theory of material\nmonism and by empirical observations that tend to support flux and the\ncoincidence of opposites. In a time before the development of logic,\nBarnes concludes, Heraclitus violates the principles of logic and\nmakes knowledge impossible.\n\nObviously this reading is not charitable to Heraclitus. There are,\nmoreover, reasons to question it. First, some of Heraclitus\u2019\nviews are incompatible with material monism (to be discussed later),\nso that the background of his theories must be rethought. Second,\nthere is evidence that Heraclitus\u2019 flux theory is weaker than\nthat attributed to him by this reading. Third, there is evidence that\nhis view of the coincidence of opposites is weaker than that\nattributed to him here. \n3.1 Flux\n\nBarnes bases his Platonic reading on Plato\u2019s own statement:\n\nHeraclitus, I believe, says that all things pass and nothing stays,\nand comparing existing things to the flow of a river, he says you\ncould not step twice into the same river. (Plato Cratylus\n402a = A6)\n\n\nThe established scholarly method is to try to verify Plato\u2019s\ninterpretation by looking at Heraclitus\u2019 own words, if possible.\nThere are three alleged \u201criver fragments\u201d:\n\n\nB12. potamoisi toisin autoisin embainousin hetera kai hetera\nhudata epirrei.\n\nOn those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters\nflow. (Cleanthes from Arius Didymus from Eusebius)\n\n\nB49a. potamois tois autois \u2026 \n\nInto the same rivers we step and do not step, we are and are not.\n(Heraclitus Homericus)\n\n\nB91[a]. potam\u00f4i \u2026 t\u00f4i aut\u00f4i\n\u2026\n\nIt is not possible to step twice into the same river according to\nHeraclitus, or to come into contact twice with a mortal being in the\nsame state. (Plutarch)\n\n\n\nOf these only the first has the linguistic density characteristic of\nHeraclitus\u2019 words. The second starts out with the same three\nwords as B12, but in Attic, not in Heraclitus\u2019 Ionic dialect,\nand the second clause has no grammatical connection to the first. The\nthird is patently a paraphrase by an author famous for quoting from\nmemory rather than from books. Even it starts out in Greek with the\nword \u2018river,\u2019 but in the singular. There is no evidence\nthat repetitions of phrases with variations are part of\nHeraclitus\u2019 style (as they are of Empedocles\u2019). To start\nwith the word \u2018river(s)\u2019 goes against normal Greek prose\nstyle, and on the plausible assumption that all sources are trying to\nimitate Heraclitus, who does not repeat himself, we would be led to\nchoose B12 as the one and only river fragment, the only actual\nquotation from Heraclitus\u2019 book. This is the conclusion of Kirk\n(1954) and Marcovich (1967), based on an interpretation that goes back\nto Reinhardt (1916). That B12 is genuine is suggested by the features\nit shares with Heraclitean fragments: syntactic ambiguity (toisin\nautoisin \u2018the same\u2019 [in the dative] can be construed\neither with \u2018rivers\u2019 [\u201cthe same rivers\u201d] or\nwith \u2018those stepping in\u2019 [\u201cthe same people\u201d],\nwith what comes before or after), chiasmus, sound-painting (the first\nphrase creates the sound of rushing water with its diphthongs and\nsibilants), rhyme and\n alliteration.[2]\n\nIf B12 is accepted as genuine, it tends to disqualify the other two\nalleged fragments. The major theoretical connection in the fragment is\nthat between \u2018same rivers\u2019 and \u2018other waters.\u2019\nB12 is, among other things, a statement of the coincidence of\nopposites. But it specifies the rivers as the same. The statement is,\non the surface, paradoxical, but there is no reason to take it as\nfalse or contradictory. It makes perfectly good sense: we call a body\nof water a river precisely because it consists of changing waters; if\nthe waters should cease to flow it would not be a river, but a lake or\na dry streambed. There is a sense, then, in which a river is a\nremarkable kind of existent, one that remains what it is by changing\nwhat it contains (cf. Hume Treatise 1.4.6, p. 258\nSelby-Bigge). Heraclitus derives a striking insight from an everyday\nencounter. Further, he supplies, via the ambiguity in the first\nclause, another reading: on the same people stepping into rivers,\nother and other waters flow. With this reading it is people who remain\nthe same in contrast to changing waters, as if the encounter with a\nflowing environment helped to constitute the perceiving subject as the\nsame. (See Kahn 1979.) B49a, by contrast, contradicts the claim that\none can step into the same rivers (and also asserts that claim), and\nB91[a], like Plato in the Cratylus, denies that one can step\nin twice. Yet if the rivers remain the same, one surely can step in\ntwice\u2013not into the same waters, to be sure, but into the same\nrivers. Thus the other alleged fragments are incompatible with the one\ncertifiably genuine fragment.\n\nIn fact, Marcovich (1967) has succeeded in showing how a misreading of\nB12 could lead to an interpretation such as that embodied in A6 and\nB91[a]. It is possible to see Cratylus, a late follower of Heraclitus,\nsupplying the wayward reading, and then adding his famous rejoinder\nthat one cannot step into the same river even once (although the\nreading may go back earlier to Hippias: Mansfeld 1990: 43\u201355).\nSince Plato is alleged to have heard Cratylus\u2019 lectures, he may\nwell have derived his reading from Cratylus\u2019 criticism. \n\nIf this interpretation is right, the message of the one river\nfragment, B12, is not that all things are changing so that we cannot\nencounter them twice, but something much more subtle and profound. It\nis that some things stay the same only by changing. One kind of\nlong-lasting material reality exists by virtue of constant turnover in\nits constituent matter. Here constancy and change are not opposed but\ninextricably connected. A human body could be understood in precisely\nthe same way, as living and continuing by virtue of constant\nmetabolism\u2013as Aristotle for instance later understood it. On\nthis reading, Heraclitus believes in flux, but not as destructive of\nconstancy; rather it is, paradoxically, a necessary condition of\nconstancy, at least in some cases (and arguably in all). In general,\nat least in some exemplary cases, high-level structures supervene on\nlow-level material flux. The Platonic reading still has advocates\n(e.g. Tar\u00e1n 1999), but it is no longer the only reading of\nHeraclitus advocated by scholars.\n3.2 The Unity of Opposites\n\nHeraclitus\u2019 flux doctrine is a special case of the unity of\nopposites, pointing to ways things are both the same and not the same\nover time. He depicts two key opposites that are interconnected, but\nnot identical. Heraclitus sometimes explains how things have opposite\nqualities:\n\nSea is the purest and most polluted water: for fish drinkable and\nhealthy, for men undrinkable and harmful. (B61)\n\n\nBarnes thinks Heraclitus gets his doctrine of the universal\ncoinstantiation of contraries through fallaciously dropping qualifiers\n(such as: \u2018for fish,\u2019 \u2018for men\u2019). But B61\nshows he is perfectly aware of them, and we might rather say that he\nunderstands them tacitly even when he does not utter them. When he\nsays,\n\nCollections: wholes and not wholes; brought together, pulled apart;\nsung in unison, sung in conflict; from all things one and from one all\nthings (B10)\n\n\nhe does not contradict himself. There are perfectly good contexts in\nwhich everything he says is true. One can divide a collection into its\nparts or join the parts into a unified whole. \n\nMost tellingly, Heraclitus explains just how contraries are\nconnected:\n\nAs the same thing in us are living and dead, waking and sleeping,\nyoung and old. For these things having changed around are those, and\nthose in turn having changed around are these.(B88)\n\n\nContrary qualities are found in us \u201cas the same thing.\u201d\nBut they are the same by virtue of one thing changing around to\nanother. We are asleep and we wake up; we are awake and we go to\nsleep. Thus sleep and waking are both found in us, but not at the same\ntime or in the same respect. Indeed, if sleeping and waking were\nidentical, there would be no change as required by the second\nsentence. Contraries are the same by virtue of constituting a system\nof connections: alive-dead, waking-sleeping, young-old. Subjects do\nnot possess incompatible properties at the same time, but at different\ntimes.\n\nIn general, what we see in Heraclitus is not a conflation of opposites\ninto an identity, but a series of subtle analyses revealing the\ninterconnectedness of contrary states in life and in the world. There\nis no need to impute to him a logical fallacy. Opposites are a\nreality, and their interconnections are real, but the correlative\nopposites are not identical to each other.\n3.3 Ontology\n\nThe standard view of Heraclitus\u2019 ontology since Aristotle is\nthat he is a material monist who holds that fire is the ultimate\nreality; all things are just manifestations of fire. According to\nAristotle the Milesians in general were material monists who advocated\nother kinds of ultimate matter: Thales water, Anaximander the\nboundless, Anaximenes air (Metaphysics 983b6\u2013984a8). So\nHeraclitus\u2019 theory was just another version of a common\nbackground theory. There are problems already with Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of the Milesians: Aristotle lacks any textual evidence\nfor Thales\u2019 view and must reconstruct it out of almost nothing;\nhe sometimes treats Anaximander as a pluralist like Anaxagoras who\nthinks the boundless is a mixture of qualities; at most Anaximenes\nmight exemplify material monism\u2013but Plato reads him as a\npluralist (Timaeus 39 with Graham 2003b; Graham 2003a). In\nthe case of Heraclitus, his own statements make material monism\nproblematic as an interpretation. According to material monism, some\nkind of matter is the ultimate reality, and any variation in the world\nconsists merely of qualitative or possibly quantitative change in it;\nfor there is only one reality, for instance fire, which can never come\ninto existence or perish, but can only change in its appearances.\nHeraclitus, however, advocates a radical kind of change:\n\nFor souls it is death to become water, for water death to become\nearth, but from earth water is born, and from water soul. (B36)\n\n\n(Here soul seems to occupy the place of fire.) The language of birth\nand death in the world of living things is precisely the language used\nin Greek metaphysics for coming to be and perishing. It implies a\nradical transformation that rules out continuing identity (cf. B76,\nB62). Indeed, interpreters of Heraclitus cannot have it both ways:\nHeraclitus cannot be both a believer in radical flux (the change of\neverything into everything else: fire into water, water into earth,\nand so on) and an advocate of monism. Either he must believe in a\nmerely illusory or at most a limited kind of change, or he must be a\npluralist. \n\nOne further difficulty remains for the monist reading. In his alleged\nversion of monism, fire is the ultimate reality. Yet fire (as the\nancients recognized) is the least substantial and the most evanescent\nof elemental stuffs. It makes a better symbol of change than of\npermanence. Other alleged cases of material monism offer a basic kind\nof matter that could arguably be stable and permanent over long\nperiods of time; but fire manifests \u201cneed and satiety\u201d\n(B65), a kind of ongoing consumption that can live only by devouring\nfuel. Is not Heraclitus\u2019 choice of a basic reality itself\nparadoxical? At best his appeal to fire seems to draw on material\nmonism in a way that points beyond the theory to an account in which\nthe process of change is more real than the material substances that\nundergo change.\n4. Cosmology\n\nAlthough Heraclitus is more than a cosmologist, he does offer a\ncosmology. His most fundamental statement on cosmology is found in\nB30:\n\nThis world-order [kosmos], the same of all, no god nor man\ndid create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire,\nkindling in measures and being quenched in measures.\n\n\nIn this passage, he uses, for the first time in any extant Greek text,\nthe word kosmos \u201corder\u201d to mean something like\n\u201cworld.\u201d He identifies the world with fire, but goes on to\nspecify portions of fire that are kindling and being quenched.\nAlthough ancient sources, including Aristotle (On the Heavens\n279b12\u201317) as well as the Stoics, attributed to Heraclitus a\nworld that was periodically destroyed by fire and then reborn, the\npresent statement seems to contradict that view, as Hegel already\nnoticed. If the world always was and is and will be, then it does not\nperish and come back into existence, though portions of it (measures\nof fire) are constantly being transformed. \n\nHeraclitus describes the transformations of elementary bodies:\n\nThe turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half\nfireburst. (B31[a])\n\n\n<Earth> is liquefied as sea and measured into the same\nproportion as it had before it became earth. (B31[b])\n\n\nFire turns into water (\u201csea\u201d), and then half of that\nquantity turns into earth and half into \u201cfireburst\u201d\n(pr\u00east\u00ear, a fiery, windy kind of storm\nphenomenon). The portion that becomes earth turns back into water, in\nthe same quantity it had previously. Here Heraclitus envisages a\nlawlike transformation of stuff from fire to water to earth; the\ntransformation is reversible, and in it the same relative quantities\nof stuff are preserved. There is, then, a kind of conservation of\nmatter, or at least overall quantity of matter. What would make the\nworld to be continuous would be the fact that when one portion of fire\nturns into water, an equivalent portion of water turns into fire. The\noverall equilibrium is preserved, even if the water that is now in the\nsea is not the same water as was in it before. This picture bears a\nsimilarity to the image of the river, which remains the same despite\nits changing material contents. \n\nIn this view of the world, the mutual transformations of matter are\nnot an accidental feature, but the very essence of nature. Without\nchange, there would be no world. Heraclitus seems to acknowledge this\nin his praise of war and strife:\n\nWe must recognize that war is common, strife is justice, and all\nthings happen according to strife and necessity. (B80)\n\n\nWar is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods,\nsome as men; some he made slaves, some free. (B53)\n\n\nConflicting powers of opposites, including those of elemental bodies,\nmake possible the world and all its variety; without that conflict we\nwould have only lifeless uniformity. In the former passage Heraclitus\nis perhaps criticizing Anaximander for his view that cosmic justice\nconsists of a punishment of powers that overstep their boundaries\n(Anaximander B1). Justice is not the correction of an excess, but the\nwhole pattern of the domination of one opposite followed by that of\nthe other. \n\nThere is, however, a guiding force in the world:\n\nThunderbolt steers all things. (B64)\n\n\nThe fiery shaft of lightning is a symbol of the direction of the\nworld. Anaximander may have already used the image of the shipmaster\nof the universe (Kahn 1960: 238). Heraclitus identifies it with the\nthunderbolt, itself an attribute of Zeus the storm god. The changes\nwrought by and symbolized by fire govern the world. The ruling power\nof the universe can be identified with Zeus, but not in a\nstraightforward way: \u201cOne being, the only wise one, would and\nwould not be called by the name of Zeus\u201d (B32). And here the\nword used for \u2018Zeus\u2019 can be rendered \u201cLife.\u201d\nLike the Milesians, Heraclitus identifies the ruling power of the\nworld with deity, but (like them also) his conception is not a\nconventional one. \n\nHeraclitus provided some sort of discussion of meteorological and\nastronomical phenomena. He studied the disappearance and reappearance\nof the moon at the end and beginning of a month (Oxyrhynchus Papyri\nLIII 3710 ii. 43\u201347 and iii. 7\u201311\u2013the clearest\nevidence that Heraclitus had a scientific interest in astronomy). He\nexplained the sun and moon as bowls full of fire. As the moon\u2019s\nbowl rotated it caused the phases. Eclipses were the result of a\nrotation of the convex side of the bowls to face the earth. We have no\nreports about the earth itself, but we may suppose that, like his\npredecessors, Heraclitus viewed it as flat. Evaporations from the\nearth and sea apparently provided fuel for the heavenly bodies, which\nburned like oil lamps. \n\nDivine power is manifest in all phenomena: \u201cGod is day night,\nwinter summer, war peace, satiety hunger, and he alters just as\n<fire> when it is mixed with spices is named according to the\naroma of each of them\u201d (B67). Again Heraclitus seems to stress\nthe unity of divine power, even if humans assign different names and\nattributes to it. All things that happen are good, but humans do not\nperceive them to be so: \u201cTo God all things are fair, good and\njust, but men suppose some things are unjust, some just\u201d (B102).\nHeraclitus does not attempt to provide a detailed theodicy, but seeks\nto view all things sub specie aeternitatis, in which conflict\n(including presumably human conflict) keeps the world going (B80,\ncited above). \n5. Knowledge\n\nPlato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the\nflux of sensible objects. Yet Heraclitus does not repudiate knowledge\nor the wisdom that comes from a proper understanding of the world. To\nbe sure, he believes most people are not capable of wisdom;\nunderstanding is a rare and precious commodity, which even most\nreputed sages do not attain to (B28[a]). Yet wisdom is possible, and\nit is embodied in Heraclitus\u2019 message, for those who can discern\nit.\n\nHeraclitus seems to accept the evidence of the senses as in some way\nvaluable: \u201cThe things of which there is sight, hearing,\nexperience, I prefer\u201d (B55). Sight is the best of the senses:\n\u201cThe eyes are more accurate witnesses than the ears\u201d\n(B101a). Yet in contrast to those who view knowledge as an\naccumulation of information or wisdom as a collection of sayings, he\nrequires much more than sensation and memory:\n\nLearning many things does not teach understanding. Else it would have\ntaught Hesiod and Pythagoras, as well as Xenophanes and Hecataeus.\n(B40)\n\n\nIn this statement Heraclitus reviews the leading authorities of his\nday, living (the last three) and dead, dealing with religious and\nsecular knowledge, and finds them all wanting. They spend too much\neffort in collecting information and not enough in grasping its\nmeaning. \u201cWhat intelligence or understanding do they [the\npeople] have?\u201d asks Heraclitus. \u201cThey follow popular bards\nand treat the crowd as their instructor, not realizing that the many\nare base, while the few are noble\u201d (B104). He criticizes Hesiod\non specifics: \u201cThe teacher of the multitude is Hesiod; they\nbelieve he has the greatest knowledge\u2013who did not comprehend day\nand night: for they are one\u201d (B57). In his myths, Hesiod treats\nDay and Night as separate persons, taking turns traveling abroad,\nwhile one remains at home. But this fails to capture the\ninterconnectedness of day and night, and falsifies reality. Heraclitus\ncriticizes Homer, Pythagoras and Archilochus for their inadequacies.\n\n\nIn general, he holds that people do not learn what they should:\n\u201cMany do not understand such things as they encounter, nor do\nthey learn by their experience, but they think they do\u201d (B17).\nIndeed, they do not process the information they receive:\n\u201cHaving heard without comprehension they are like the deaf; this\nsaying bears witness to them: present they are absent\u201d (B34).\nHeraclitus explains: \u201cPoor witnesses for men are the eyes and\nears of those who have barbarian souls\u201d (B107). A barbarian was\na non-Greek; just as a foreigner hears Greek words without\nunderstanding their meaning, most people perceive without\nunderstanding the world around them. Sense perception is necessary for\nknowledge, but not sufficient; without the ability to decipher\ninformation from the senses, one cannot understand the world.\n\nWhat chance is there then to learn the secrets of the world?\nHeraclitus is not wholly pessimistic about human cognitive abilities:\n\u201cAll men have a share in self-knowledge and sound\nthinking\u201d (B116). What is needed is not simply more sense\nexperience or more information, but an improved way of comprehending\nthe message (logos) that the world offers. In this context\nhis curious method of expression begins to make sense. He presents his\nstatements in the form of puzzles, riddles, aper\u00e7us. Many of\nthem support two or more readings, and contain hidden insights. To\ncomprehend them the reader must grasp their complexity and then\ndiscover their unity. To read Heraclitus appropriately is to have a\nrich cognitive experience, as the philosopher hints in his\nintroduction (B1).\n\nHeraclitus often presents a simple concrete situation or image which\nhas implications for our understanding of the world: a river, a bow, a\nroad. He does not generally pronounce generalizations and deduce\nconsequences. Rather, his method can be seen as inductive: he offers\nan example which suggests general principles. Unlike most\nphilosophers, he challenges the right brain rather than the left. He\ndoes not teach in the conventional sense; he offers his readers\nmaterials for understanding and lets them educate themselves. He cites\nwith approval a model of religious instruction:\n\nThe Lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither reveals nor conceals, but\ngives a sign. (B93)\n\n\nThe riddling statements of the Delphic oracle do not provide\nstraightforward answers, but force people to interpret them. His\ntruths come to the attentive reader as discoveries resulting from the\nsolution of a puzzle.\n6. Value\n\nThe aim of Heraclitus\u2019 unusual approach is to produce readers\nwho have a proper grasp of the world and their place in it.\n\u201cSound thinking is the greatest virtue and wisdom: to speak the\ntruth and to act on the basis of an understanding of the nature of\nthings\u201d (B112). Such an understanding can result only from an\nability to interpret the language of nature. The proper understanding\nallows one to act in a harmonious way.\n\nHeraclitus urges moderation and self-control in a somewhat\nconventional way (B85, B43). He also recommends the conventional Greek\ngoal of seeking fame: \u201cThe best choose one thing above all, the\neverlasting fame of mortals; the many gorge themselves like\ncattle\u201d (B29). To die in battle is a superior kind of death\n(B24). Those who drink to excess make their souls wet, and accordingly\nharm them (B117), for a healthy soul is dry (B118). Those who\nexperience better deaths attain better rewards (B25). Those who lie\nwill be punished (B28[b]). \u201cFor men who die there await things\nthey do not expect or anticipate\u201d (B27). Some of these remarks\ntend to suggest an afterlife with rewards and punishment, although his\nbelief in a continued existence is controversial (see Nussbaum 1972).\nIn any case, Heraclitus views the soul as the moral and cognitive\ncenter of human experience.\n\nIn political theory he maintains that one good man is worth ten\nthousand ordinary people (B49). He criticizes his fellow citizens for\nbanishing a distinguished leader:\n\nThe adult citizens of Ephesus should hang themselves, every one, and\nleave the city to children, since they have banished Hermodorus, a man\npre-eminent among them, saying, Let no one stand out among us; or let\nhim stand out elsewhere among others. (B121)\n\n\nEvidently he trusts the few and distrusts the many. He sees good laws\nas being reflections of universal principles:\n\nSpeaking with sense we must fortify ourselves in the common sense of\nall, as a city is fortified by its law, and even more forcefully. For\nall human laws are nourished by the one divine law. For it prevails as\nfar as it will and suffices for all and is superabundant. (B114)\n\n\nThe divine law, on Heraclitus\u2019 view, is probably continuous with\nthe laws governing the cosmos, which maintain justice through\nopposition (B80).\n7. Influence\n\nAlthough Heraclitus is not known to have had students, his writings\nseem to have been influential from an early time. He may have provoked\nParmenides to develop a contrasting philosophy (Patin 1899; Graham\n2002), although their views have much more in common than is generally\nrecognized (Nehamas 2002). Empedocles seems to have invoked\nHeraclitean themes, and some Hippocratic treatises imitated\nHeraclitean language and presented applications of Heraclitean themes.\nDemocritus echoed many of Heraclitus\u2019 ethical pronouncements in\nhis own ethics. From an early time Heraclitus was seen as the\nrepresentative of universal flux in contrast to Parmenides, the\nrepresentative of universal stasis. Cratylus brought Heraclitus\u2019\nphilosophy to Athens, where Plato heard it. Plato seems to have used\nHeraclitus\u2019 theory (as interpreted by Cratylus) as a model for\nthe sensible world, as he used Parmenides\u2019 theory for the\nintelligible world. As mentioned, both Plato and Aristotle viewed\nHeraclitus as violating the law of non-contradiction, and propounding\nan incoherent theory of knowledge based on a radical flux. Yet\nAristotle also treated him as a coherent material monist who posited\nfire as an ultimate principle. The Stoics used Heraclitus\u2019\nphysics as the inspiration for their own, understanding him to\nadvocate a periodic destruction of the world by fire, followed by a\nregeneration of the world; Cleanthes in particular commented on\nHeraclitus. Aenesidemus interpreted Heraclitus as a kind of\nproto-skeptic (see Polito 2004). \n\nEver since Plato, Heraclitus has been seen as a philosopher of flux.\nThe challenge in interpreting the philosopher of Ephesus has always\nbeen to find a coherent theory in his paradoxical utterances. Since\nHegel, he has been seen as a paradigmatic process\nphilosopher\u2013perhaps with some justification. \n8. Addendum\n\nThe recently published Derveni Papyrus, discovered in a tomb in\nnorthern Greece, contains a commentary on an Orphic poem. The\ncommentator discusses some passages of Heraclitus in connection with\nthe poem, namely B3 + B94 (which may have been thus joined in\nHeraclitus\u2019 book) (column 4). See Betegh 2004. The Oxyrhynchus\nPapyri (vol. 53, no. 3710) also show that Heraclitus was interested in\ndetermining the days of the lunar month and thus in scientific\nquestions. See Burkert 1993. On the Derveni Papyrus material, see\nBetegh & Piano 2019, 2022; Ranocchia 2019; and Hladky 2022.\n\nIn recent work, scholars have devoted special attention to\nHeraclitus\u2019 moral and political theory (Fattal 2011, Sider 2013,\nRobitzsch 2018), to questions of logos and rationality (H\u00fclsz\n2013, Long 2013), to the material character of soul (Betegh 2007), and\nto the theory of elemental change (Neels 2018).\n\nThere is an important new edition of the Presocratics, which contains\na volume mostly dedicated to Heraclitus, with a generous selection of\ntexts including many dedicated to reception (Laks and Most 2016).\nThere is also an important new study of Heraclitus that defends a\ntraditional interpretation of the sources (Finkelberg 2017).\n\nHeraclitus\u2019 influence on culture seems undiminished, appearing\nprominently in studies of fields as diverse as business management and\nveterinary medicine. Often cited as the philosopher of flux,\nHeraclitus now seems to be emerging as the standard-bearer for process\nphilosophy, having displaced more recent icons such as Henri Bergson\nand Alfred North Whitehead. See, for instance, van Geert and de Ruiter\n2022, a major contribution to the discipline of psychology. (On\nHeraclitus as a process philosopher, see Graham 2011.)\n",
