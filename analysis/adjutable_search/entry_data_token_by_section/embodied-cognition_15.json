    "main_text": "Constitution || Constitution Through Coupling\n5.1 Constitution Through Coupling\n\n\nThe previous discussion of dynamic cognitive science serves also to\nillustrate the Constitution theme. As the quotation above from Spivey\nindicated, dynamically-oriented cognitive scientists regard cognition\nto be the product of interactions between brain, body, and world. The\ncontinuous interactions between these things, Chemero writes, explains\nwhy \u201cdynamically-minded cognitive scientists do not assume that\nan animal must represent the world to interact with it. Instead, they\nthink of the animal and the relevant parts of the environment as\ntogether comprising a single, coupled system\u201d (2001, 142).\nChemero continues this idea: \u201cIt is only for convenience (and\nfrom habit) that we think of the organism and environment as separate;\nin fact, they are best thought of as comprising just one\nsystem\u2026the animal and environment are not separate to begin\nwith\u201d (2001, 142).\n\n\nChemero\u2019s description of the animal and environment as coupled\nis ubiquitous in dynamical cognitive science. Coupling is a technical\nnotion. The behaviors of objects are coupled when the differential\nequations that describe the behavior of one contains a term that\nrefers to the behavior of the other. The equations that apply to the\ncentrifugal governor, for instance, contain terms referring to the\nheight of the flyballs and the size of the steam valve opening. The\nLotka Volterra equations contain terms that refer to the number of\npredators and the number of prey. The co-occurrence of terms in the\nequations that describe a dynamical system shows that the behavior of\nthe objects to which they refer are co-dependent. They are thus\nusefully construed as constituents of a single system\u2014a system\nheld together by the interactions of parts whose relationships are\ncaptured in coupled differential equations.\n\n\nIn addition to the technical sense of coupling, philosophers often\nappeal to a looser sense when defending Constitution. Clark, for\ninstance, discusses the process of writing. When writing, \u201c[i]t\nis not always that fully formed thoughts get committed to paper.\nRather, the paper provides a medium in which, this time via some kind\nof coupled neural-scribbling-reading unfolding, we are enabled to\nexplore ways of thinking that might otherwise be unavailable to\nus\u201d (2008, 126). Clark\u2019s idea is that the cognitive system\nthat produces writing extends beyond a subject\u2019s brain, to\ninclude among its constituents the paper on which words are written.\nThe paper and the acts of reading and writing are literally parts of\nthe cognitive process, no less than neural processes, because of the\ncontinuous interactions between all of these things. If it were\npossible to provide differential equations that describe the\nproduction of writing, they would include terms referring to the\nbehaviors of each of these things. Thus, the reasoning that brings us\nto the conclusion that the components of a centrifugal governor are\nconstituents of a single system, and that predator and prey are\nconstituents of single system, leads also to the conclusion that the\nconstituents of many cognitive systems will include parts of the body\nand world.\n\n\nThe coupling concept underlies some arguments for extended\ncognition. When brain processes are coupled to processes in the\nbody or world, either in the technical sense deriving from dyamical\nsystems theory or in the less strict sense involving loops of\ndependency, the resulting \u201cbrain+\u201d is itself a single\ncognitive system. It is a cognitive system that extends beyond the\nhead because the constituents of the system are not brain-bound.\n\n\nAdams and Aizawa (2008; 2009; 2010) have objected to coupling-inspired\ndefenses of Constitution, and hence the idea of extended cognition, on\nthe grounds that they commit a\ncoupling-constitution fallacy: \u201cThe pattern of\nreasoning here involves moving from the observation that process X\nis in some way causally connected (coupled) to a process Y of type\nj to the conclusion that X is part of the process of type\nj\u201d (2009, 81). They argue that this reasoning leads to\nabsurd results. For instance, \u201c[i]t is the interaction of the\nspinning bowling ball with the surface of the alley that leads to all\nthe pins falling. Still, the process of the ball\u2019s spinning does\nnot extend into the surface of the alley or the pins (2009,\n83). Similarly, Adams and Aizawa would claim, the process of cognition\ndoes not extend into the paper and scribblings involved in\nwriting.\n\n\nThis response is unlikely to impress supporters of coupling arguments\nfor Constitution. Firstly, coupling arguments require that process\nX be more than simply causally connected to process Y of type\nj for X to be part of the j process. Suppose that process\nY of type j is the production of a written paragraph on a\npiece of paper. Let X be the sound of the pencil as it leaves\ngraphite on the surface of the paper. The sound is causally connected\nto the production of writing, but defenders of Constitution need not\nregard it as a constituent in the system of that results in the\nwritten paragraph. The sound does not contribute to the\n\u201cloop\u201d\u2014neural events, scribbling, reading\u2014from\nwhich the paragraph emerges. So, not just any causal connections\nsuffice for constituency in a process.\n\n\nSecond, Clark and other defenders of Constitution would not claim that\nthe writing process itself occurs in the constituents of the\ncognitive system that produces writing. Certainly the bowling\nball\u2019s spinning does not extend into the floor of the alley, and\nof course the writing process does not extend into a piece of paper.\nBut the Constitution thesis is not committed to such claims (Shapiro\n2019a). Just as one can say that a neuron is a constituent of a brain\neven if cognition does not take place in a neuron, it might make sense\nto say that the floor of the alley is a constituent in a system that\nresults in the ball\u2019s spinning even if spinning does not take\nplace in the floor, and the paper is a constituent in a system that\nproduces writing even if the writing process does not take place\nin the paper. Such conclusions, even if ultimately\nunwarranted, do not fail for the reasons Adams and Aizawa muster.\n",
