    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics || Proof and Definition\n2.3 Proof and Definition\n2.3.1 Proof\n\n\nFrege\u2019s system (i.e., his term logic/predicate calculus) consisted\nof a language and an apparatus for proving statements. The latter\nconsisted of a set of logical axioms (statements considered to be\ntruths of logic) and a set of rules of inference that lay out the\nconditions under which certain statements of the language may be\ncorrectly inferred from others. Frege made a point of showing how every\nstep in a proof of a proposition was justified either in terms of one\nof the axioms or in terms of one of the rules of inference or justified\nby a theorem or derived rule that had already been proved.\n\n\nThus, as part of his formal system, Frege developed a strict\nunderstanding of a \u2018proof\u2019. In essence, he defined a proof\nto be any finite sequence of statements such that each statement in the\nsequence either is an axiom or follows from previous members by a valid\nrule of inference. Thus, a proof of a theorem of logic, say \u03c6, is\ntherefore any finite sequence of statements (with \u03c6 the final\nstatement in the sequence) such that each member of the sequence: (a)\nis one of the logical axioms of the formal system, or (b) follows from\nprevious members of the sequence by a rule of inference. These are\nessentially the definitions that logicians still use today.\n2.3.2 Definition\n\n\nFrege was extremely careful about the proper description and\ndefinition of logical and mathematical concepts. He developed powerful\nand insightful criticisms of mathematical work which did not meet his\nstandards for clarity. For example, he criticized mathematicians who\ndefined a variable to be a number that varies rather than an expression\nof language which can vary as to which determinate number it may take\nas a value.\nMore importantly, however, Frege was the first to claim that a\nproperly formed definition had to have two important metatheoretical\nproperties.  Let us call the new, defined symbol introduced in a\ndefinition the definiendum, and the term that is used to\ndefine the new term the definiens.  Then Frege was the first\nto suggest that proper definitions have to be both eliminable\n(a definendum must always be replaceable by its definiens in any\nformula in which the former occurs) and conservative (a\ndefinition should not make it possible to prove new relationships\namong formulas that were formerly unprovable).  Concerning one of his\ndefinitions in the Begriffsschrift (\u00a724), Frege\nwrites: \nWe can do without the notation introduced by this\n  sentence, and hence without the sentence itself as its definition;\n  nothing follows from the sentence that could not also be inferred\n  without it. Our sole purpose in introducing such definitions is to\n  bring about an extrinsic simplification by stipulating an\n  abbreviation.\n\nFrege later criticized those mathematicians who developed\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 definitions or \u2018creative\u2019\ndefinitions. In the Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, II (1903,\nSections 56\u201367) Frege criticized the practice of defining a\nconcept on a given range of objects and later redefining the concept\non a wider, more inclusive range of objects. Frequently, this\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 style of definition led to conflict, since the\nredefined concept did not always reduce to the original concept when\none restricts the range to the original class of objects. In that same\nwork (1903, Sections 139\u2013147), Frege criticized the mathematical\npractice of introducing notation to name (unique) entities without\nfirst proving that there exist (unique) such entities. He pointed out\nthat such \u2018creative definitions\u2019 were simply unjustified.\nCreative definitions fail to be conservative, as this was explained\nabove. \n",
