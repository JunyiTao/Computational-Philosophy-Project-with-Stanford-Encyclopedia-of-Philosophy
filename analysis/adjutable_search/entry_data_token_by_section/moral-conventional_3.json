Does the \u201cMoral\u201d Pattern of Criterion Judgments Actually Identify Moral Judgments?\n\nIt is clear that studies eliciting criterion judgments and\njustification categories demonstrate that children respond quite\ndifferently to different sorts of normative transgressions. But why\nshould we think that in most or\n all[10]\n cases, when a participant judges that an action is wrong and then\noffers what Turiel and other social domain theorists take to be the\nmoral pattern of criterion judgments, that the participant\u2019s\njudgment that the action was wrong really was a moral\njudgment? The question is an important one for assessing\nTuriel\u2019s achievement. It\u2019s also important, as we will see\nin\n Section 10,\n because facts about Turiel-style criterion judgments and\njustification categories have been used to support claims about the\nnature of moral judgments and claims about the moral capacities of\nvarious groups of people, including children and psychopaths.\n\nIn formulating his account of criterion judgments indicating that a\nparticipant\u2019s normative judgment is a moral judgment,\nTuriel focused on three features\u2014authority independence,\nuniversalizability in space, and universalizability in time\u2014that\nhad been discussed by the philosophers who contributed to the\ndefinition of morality literature. But, as noted in\n Section 2,\n those philosophers reached no agreement about whether these features\nare necessary conditions for a judgment to count as moral. And Turiel\nmade no effort to advance or resolve the arguments found in the\nphilosophical literature. He contributed nothing to the descriptive\nproject of analyzing the ordinary concept of moral judgment. Nor did\nhe offer any normative arguments aimed at showing how our ordinary\nconcept of moral judgment should be revised. Rather, it seems, he\nsimply picked a cluster of disputed philosophical proposals, and\nclaimed that they could be used to identify genuinely moral judgments.\nSo what justification do we have for the claim that the criterion\njudgments Turiel uses actually do identify moral judgments? The\nproblem is nicely, though inadvertently, underscored by Judith Smetana\nin a passage describing work using the social domain theorists\u2019\nexperimental paradigm. \u201cChildren\u201d, she tell us,\n\n\nhave been asked to make judgments along a set of dimensions that are\nhypothesized to differentiate moral and conventional rules.\n(Smetana 1993: 114\u2013115; emphasis added)\n\n\nTuriel and other social domain theorists have indeed\nhypothesized that the criterion judgments they focus on\ndifferentiate moral judgments from conventional judgments. But it is\nfar from clear how they have defended that hypothesis. Can\nthe claim that these criterion judgments enable us to identify moral\njudgments be defended?\n",
