    "preamble": "\n\nThe distinction between essential versus accidental\nproperties has been characterized in various ways, but it is\noften understood in modal terms: an essential\nproperty of an object is a property that it must have, while an\naccidental property of an object is one that it happens to\nhave but that it could lack. Let\u2019s call this the basic modal\ncharacterization, where a modal characterization of a\nnotion is one that explains the notion in terms of\nnecessity/possibility. In the characterization just given of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties, the use of\nthe word \u201cmust\u201d reflects the fact that\nnecessity is invoked, while the use of the word\n\u201ccould\u201d reflects that possibility is\ninvoked. The notions of necessity and possibility are interdefinable:\nto say that something is necessary is to say that its negation is not\npossible; to say that something is possible is to say that its\nnegation is not necessary; to say that an object must have a certain\nproperty is to say that it could not lack it; and to say that an\nobject could have a certain property is to say that it is not the case\nthat it must lack it.\n\nMany would say that each individual human could not fail to be human;\nif so, then the basic modal characterization counts the property of\nbeing human as an essential property of each human. And, too, many\nwould say that although someone, say Socrates, is in fact fond of\ndogs, Socrates could have lacked that property; if that is right, then\nthe basic modal characterization counts the property of being fond of\ndogs as an accidental property of Socrates.\n \nA modal characterization of the distinction between essential and\naccidental properties is taken for granted in nearly all work in\nanalytic metaphysics in the latter half of the 20th century. Advocates\nof the modal characterization have included Ruth Barcan Marcus (1967)\nand Saul Kripke (1972/1980), among others. However, some other\ncharacterizations of the distinction (see \u00a72) have recently\ngained currency. It is worth stressing here at the outset that\nalthough there is now some disagreement about how the distinction\nbetween essential and accidental properties is to be drawn, there is\nnevertheless some agreement about cases. Most would agree that however\nthe distinction is drawn, it should come out that being human (or\nbeing human if existent) is an essential property of Socrates while\nbeing fond of dogs is a merely accidental property of Socrates.\n\nEssentialism in general may be characterized as the doctrine\nthat (at least some) objects have (at least some) essential\nproperties. This characterization is not universally accepted (see\n\u00a73), but no characterization is; and at least this one has the\nvirtue of being simple and straightforward. As for specific\nessentialist claims, we have already encountered one\u2014the claim\nthat the property of being human is essential to Socrates. Another\nexample is the claim that Socrates\u2019s biological\norigin\u2014Socrates\u2019s parents, or more particularly, the sperm\nand egg from which Socrates arose\u2014is essential to Socrates. The\nfirst example is a brand of sortal essentialism while the\nsecond is a brand of origin essentialism. Both of these kinds\nof essentialisms have figured prominently in the philosophical\nliterature.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Modal Characterization of the Essential/Accidental Property Distinction\n\nAccording to the basic modal characterization of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties, which is the\ncharacterization given at the outset,\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\), whereas\n\\(P\\) is an accidental property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) but it is possible that\n\\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nPutting this into the language of possible worlds that\nphilosophers often adopt,\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) in all possible worlds, whereas\n\\(P\\) is an accidental property of an object \\(o\\) just in\ncase \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) but there is a possible world in which\n\\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\).\n\n\nAlthough the basic idea behind the modal characterization is clear\nenough from these statements, a moment\u2019s reflection reveals a\nlittle bit of trouble. Many properties (some philosophers would say\nall properties) are such that in order for an object to\npossess them, that object must exist. According to the basic modal\ncharacterization, any such property, if possessed by a contingently\nexisting object, will be counted as an accidental property of\nthat object. But this seems wrong. Consider the property of being a\ndog. It is plausible (and for present purposes we assume it is true)\nthat an object must exist in order to possess this property. Now\nconsider a particular dog named \u2018Emma\u2019, who in fact exists\nbut who might not have existed. There is a possible world in which\nEmma does not exist. And in this world (given our assumption) Emma is\nnot a dog, since Emma does not exist there. So, according to the basic\nmodal characterization, being a dog is an accidental property\nof Emma. But however we characterize the distinction between essential\nand accidental properties, the characterization should not by itself\nrule out the intuitively compelling claim that Emma is\nessentially a dog. So the basic modal characterization seems\nflawed.\n\nIn response to this point, it is tempting to turn to a variant of the\nbasic modal characterization, the existence-conditioned modal\ncharacterization, according to which\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) and it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) if\n\\(o\\) exists, whereas \\(P\\) is an accidental\nproperty of an object \\(o\\) just in case \\(o\\) has\n\\(P\\) but it is possible that \\(o\\) lacks \\(P\\) and yet\nexists.\n\n\nBut this formulation too is less than satisfactory. A widely noted\nproblem for this way of drawing the distinction is that it makes\nexistence into an essential property of each object, since no object\ncould lack existence and yet exist. Thus, this characterization of the\nessential/accidental property distinction effectively rules out a\ntheist\u2019s claim that only God has existence as an essential\nproperty. But a good characterization of the distinction should not\nrule on a substantive matter in this way.\n\nArguably neither of these problems is devastating. Those who favor the\nbasic characterization can say that typically when someone claims, for\nexample, that Emma is essentially a dog, what is really meant is not\nthat Emma has essentially the property of being a dog, but\ninstead that Emma has essentially the property of being a dog if\nexistent. Existence will be treated specially on this approach:\nthe claim that an object has existence as an essential property will\nnot be taken as the claim that the object has as an essential property\nthe property of being existent if existent; instead the claim\nwill be taken at face value. Those who favor the existence-conditioned\ncharacterization can say that when someone says that only God has\nexistence as an essential property, what is really meant is that only\nGod has existence as a necessary property, where a necessary\nproperty of an object is a property that the object possesses in all\npossible worlds. (According to the basic modal characterization, an\nessential property is the same as a necessary property.) Both\napproaches may be faulted for making a special case of the property of\nexistence. But that is not perhaps such a great fault, given that\nexistence does seem to be a special case and that it is treated\nspecially in other areas of philosophy as well. (It is perhaps worth\npointing out that according to many philosophers\u2014Kant, Russell,\nand Frege to name three\u2014existence is not a property at all. If\nthis is right, then existence is indeed a very special case.) In what\nfollows, we shall not be concerned with the details arising from the\nneed for some sort of existence condition\u2014either in the\nstatement of the definition of an essential property (as on the\nexistence-conditioned modal characterization) or in the properties\nthat are taken to be essential (as on the basic modal\ncharacterization). There are other ways of explaining the distinction\nbetween essential and accidental properties of objects in modal terms\n(to be discussed in \u00a72), but what we have called the basic\nmodal characterization and the existence-conditioned modal\ncharacterization are the standard ways. Together, usually\nindiscriminately, these amount to what we call the modal\ncharacterization.\n\nThe central notion involved in any modal characterization of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties is that of\nmetaphysical necessity/possibility. But, since there are a\nnumber of notions that correspond to the many ways that we use the\nwords \u2018necessity\u2019 and \u2018possibility\u2019, it is\nhelpful to contrast the relevant notion of necessity/possibility with\nsome other notions with which it might be confused.\n\nIf one claims that something is possible, it is sometimes natural to\ntake this to mean that one does not know it to be false. For example,\nsuppose that you ask someone whether Socrates ever went to Sparta and\nshe answers that it is possible. It is natural to understand her as\nsaying that she does not know that Socrates did not go to Sparta.\nThus, the possibility that is expressed here is a kind of\nepistemic possibility (in particular, one according to which\n\\(p\\) is epistemically possible for an agent \\(X\\) just in\ncase not-\\(p\\) is not known by \\(X)\\). This notion of\nepistemic possibility is clearly distinct from the notion of\nmetaphysical possibility, since there are cases of epistemic\npossibilities that are not metaphysical possibilities. Of\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture (that every even number greater than two\nis the sum of two primes) and its denial, each is epistemically\npossible but one (we know not which) is not metaphysically possible.\nAnd there are cases of metaphysical possibilities that are not\nepistemic possibilities. That there are only two planets in our solar\nsystem is metaphysically possible but not epistemically possible for\nmost of us, given that most of us know that there are not only two\nplanets in our solar system. (This is not to deny that there may be\nsome notions of epistemic possibility\u2014for example, maximally\ncomplete ways the universe can coherently be conceived to\nbe\u2014for which it is at least plausible to suppose that every\nmetaphysical possibility is also an epistemic possibility. Even if\nthis is so, the notions of metaphysical possibility and epistemic\npossibility are distinct.)\n\nIn addition to various notions of epistemic possibility, philosophers\nhave been concerned with three particular notions of possibility that\nare generally regarded as non-epistemic: logical possibility,\nmetaphysical possibility, and physical possibility.\nOn one common view, the physical possibilities are a subset of the\nmetaphysical possibilities, which in turn are a subset of the logical\npossibilities. (But see Fine (2002) for an opposing view.) Here are a\ncouple of examples of things that are logically possible but neither\nmetaphysically nor physically possible: the Eiffel Tower\u2019s being\nred all over and green all over at the same time; the Eiffel\nTower\u2019s being red but not\n extended.[1]\n Here is an example of something that is logically and metaphysically\npossible but not physically possible: the Eiffel Tower\u2019s\ntraveling faster than the speed of light. The Eiffel Tower\u2019s\nbeing both red and not red at the same time is possible in none of the\nsenses while its traveling faster than a speeding bullet is possible\nin all of them.\n\nTo supplement these examples, it would be nice to give\ncharacterizations of the three notions that are free from controversy.\nThat is easier said than done. Nonetheless, we offer some\ncharacterizations that are relatively uncontroversial. Metaphysical\npossibility is often taken as a primitive notion that figures into the\nidea of a physical possibility: a proposition is physically possible\nif and only if it is metaphysically compossible with the laws of\nphysics. (Other nomological possibilities, such as chemical or\nbiological possibility, can be understood similarly.) Assuming that\nthe notion of a\n logical truth\n is understood, then the logical necessities are simply the logical\ntruths, so that the logical possibilities are those things whose\nnegations are not logical truths.\n\nWe end this overview of the modal characterization of the\nessential/accidental property distinction by mentioning a notion that\nis close to, but different from, that of an essential property. It is\neasy to confuse the notion of an essential property\u2014a property\nthat a thing could not lack\u2014with the notion of a\nproperty that a thing could not lose, so it is worth taking a\nminute to reflect on the difference. Of course, any property that a\nperson could not lack is one that that person could not lose, since by\nlosing a property the person comes to lack it. Still, the\n\u201creverse\u201d does not hold. There are properties that a\nperson could not lose\u2014like the property of having spent\nChristmas 2007 in Tennessee\u2014that are nevertheless not essential\nto that person.\n2. Other Ways of Characterizing the Essential/Accidental Property Distinction\n\nThe modal characterization of an essential property of an object as a\nproperty that an object must possess fits well with (at least\none aspect of) our everyday understanding of the notion of\nessentiality, which often seems simply to be the notion of necessity.\nTo say that something is essential for something else is typically\njust to say that the first is necessary for the second. But however\nwell this account fits with (this aspect of) our everyday\nunderstanding of essentiality, it has some consequences that may be\nsurprising: this characterization classifies the property of being\nsuch that there are infinitely many primes (or, perhaps, being such\nthat there are infinitely many primes if the thing in question is\nexistent) as essential to Socrates (as well as to all other things),\nsince Socrates (like all other things) must have this property.\nSocrates must have this property for the simple reason that it is\nnecessary that there are infinitely many primes. Moreover, this\ncharacterization classifies the property of being the sole member of\nthe unit set \\(\\{2\\}\\) as essential to the number 2, given that it is\nnecessary that 2 is the sole member of the unit set \\(\\{2\\}\\).\n\nSome philosophers, most prominently Kit Fine (1994), have found these\nresults disturbing. Fine thinks that the notion of an essential\nproperty of a thing should be bound up with the notion of the thing\u2019s nature or what it\nis to be that thing, but, Fine thinks, being such that there are\ninfinitely many primes intuitively has nothing to do with what it\nis to be Socrates. And although it seems that having the number 2\nas its sole member is part of what it is to be the unit set \\(\\{2\\}\\), it\ndoes not seem that being this unit set\u2019s sole member is part of\nwhat it is to be the number 2. It is Fine\u2019s view that these\nsorts of properties are counterexamples to the modal\n characterization.[2][3]\n To replace the modal characterization, Fine offers a definitional\ncharacterization of essential properties, according to which the\nessential properties of an object are those of its properties that are\npart of the object\u2019s \u201cdefinition\u201d. What exactly is a\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of an object? This is a difficult question.\nAt first sight, it seems to be a category mistake: it is words and\nperhaps concepts\u2014but not objects\u2014that have definitions.\nEven so, it must be admitted that some objects\u2014such as the\nnumber 2 and the unit set \\(\\{2\\}\\)\u2014do seem to be definable: it is\nplausible to think that the number 2 is defined as being the successor\nof the number 1; and it is plausible to think that the unit set \\(\\{2\\}\\) is\ndefined as being the set whose sole member is the number 2. But other\nobjects\u2014such as Socrates\u2014do not seem to admit so readily\nof definition. So even if the notion is understood well enough for\nsome objects (never mind that not everyone would allow that the number\n2, for example, is an object), a major challenge for the advocate of\nthe definitional characterization is to provide a respectable general\nunderstanding of the notion of a definition for an object.\n\nAnother issue bears mentioning inasmuch as the present article\nconcerns the distinction between essential and accidental\nproperties and not merely different ways that one may\ncharacterize what an essential property is. There is a recognized\nanalytic connection between the terms \u2018essential property\u2019\nand \u2018accidental property\u2019 such that the properties of a\ngiven thing divide exclusively and exhaustively into the categories\nessential and accidental. Although the thought that\na thing\u2019s essential properties are those that are a part of its\ndefinition has caught on in the philosophical literature, the thought\nthat a thing\u2019s accidental properties are those of its properties\nthat are not part of its definition has not. For example, few would\nsay that it is merely accidental to Socrates to be the sole member of\n\\(\\{\\text{Socrates}\\}\\). In short, the phrase \u2018accidental\nproperty\u2019 tends to be used in the sense of a modally accidental\nproperty.\n\nSeveral philosophers have defended non-standard versions of the modal\ncharacterization in light of Fine\u2019s putative counterexamples.\nEdward Zalta (2006) was among the first. He distinguishes between\nabstract objects (such as numbers and fictional characters) and\nordinary objects (such as Socrates). According to Zalta, every object\nnecessarily exists (whether abstract or ordinary), but ordinary\nobjects are not necessarily concrete. Indeed, an ordinary object such\nas Socrates is concrete in some possible worlds but non-concrete in\nothers. Zalta suggests two separate accounts of essence, one\ncorresponding to abstract objects and the other corresponding to\nordinary objects. Here is Zalta\u2019s account of essence for\nordinary objects, slightly simplified:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an ordinary object\n\\(o\\) just in case (1) it is necessary that \\(o\\) has\n\\(P\\) if \\(o\\) is concrete, and (2) it is not necessary that\n\\(o\\) has \\(P\\).\n\n\nIn all possible worlds, Socrates is such that there are infinitely\nmany primes (whether Socrates is concrete or non-concrete). Thus,\ncondition (2) is not satisfied. Thus, this is not one of\nSocrates\u2019s essential properties. (In Zalta\u2019s terminology,\nthis is not one of Socrates\u2019s strongly essential\nproperties, although Zalta would say that it is one of\nSocrates\u2019s weakly essential properties, since condition\n(1) is satisfied.) Here is Zalta\u2019s account of essence for\nabstract objects:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an abstract object\n\\(o\\) just in case it is necessary that \\(o\\) encodes \\(P\\).\n\n\nOnly abstract objects are capable of encoding properties,\naccording to Zalta. To say that an abstract object encodes a property\nis to say that the property is included in our conception of the\nobject. Thus, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes encodes the\nproperty of being a detective, even though Sherlock Holmes does not\nhave this property. (In Zalta\u2019s terminology, Sherlock Holmes\ndoes not exemplify this property. Sherlock Holmes exemplifies\nproperties such as being created by Arthur Conan Doyle and having been\nportrayed by Jeremy Brett.) According to Zalta, being a detective is\none of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s essential properties. In contrast,\nbeing such that there are infinitely many primes is not one of\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s essential properties, since this property is not\nincluded in our conception of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe asymmetry between the essential properties of Socrates, who is an\nordinary object, and {Socrates}, which is an abstract object, is\nexplained: given the theory and definitions proposed, it is not\nessential to Socrates that he is an element of {Socrates}, but it is\nessential to {Socrates} that Socrates is an element of it (see Zalta\n2006, \u00a75, for the details).\n\nFabrice Correia (2007) suggests a different version of the modal\ncharacterization, based on a non-standard conception of modality:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case it is locally necessary that \\(o\\) has\n\\(P\\) if there are facts about \\(o\\).\n\n\nIn order to understand this characterization, we must first understand\nCorreia\u2019s non-standard conception of modality, inspired by\nArthur Prior (1957). Philosophers typically regard possible worlds as\ngiving a complete description of a possible state of the universe.\nThese are what Correia calls globally possible worlds.\nLocally possible worlds form a broader class. They include\nall the globally possible worlds, but also strictly\nlocally possible worlds, which are incomplete and do not include\nfacts about certain objects. A strictly locally possible world is\n\u201ca globally possible world in miniature\u201d (2007, pp.\n72\u201373). Correia suggests that there are strictly locally possible\nworlds in which there are facts about Socrates but no facts about\nprime numbers. Thus, it is not locally necessary that\nSocrates has the property of being such that there are infinitely many\nprimes. Thus, this is not one of Socrates\u2019s essential\nproperties.\n\nIn a series of papers, Berit Brogaard and Joe Salerno (2007a, 2007b,\n2013) have defended a version of the modal characterization that\nrelies on their non-standard conception of counterfactuals:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case (1) it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) if\n\\(o\\) exists, and (2) if nothing had \\(P\\), then \\(o\\)\nwould not exist.\n\n\nIn order to understand this characterization, we must first understand\nBrogaard and Salerno\u2019s non-standard conception of\ncounterfactuals. According to Brogaard and Salerno, counterfactuals\nwith impossible antecedents (\u201ccounterpossibles\u201d) can be\nfalse (rather than being \u201cvacuously true,\u201d as standard\naccounts would have it). For example, Brogaard and Salerno would say\nthat the following counterfactual is false: If nothing had the\nproperty of being such that there are infinitely many primes, then\nSocrates would not exist. Since this counterfactual is false,\ncondition (2) is not satisfied. Thus, Socrates is not essentially such\nthat there are infinitely many primes.\n\nAnother account, defended by Nathan Wildman (2013) and suggested by Sam Cowling (2013), appeals to David Lewis\u2019s (1983, 1986) distinction between sparse\nproperties and abundant properties:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case (1) it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) if\n\\(o\\) exists, and (2) \\(P\\) is a sparse property.\n\n\nAs Wildman and Cowling point out, there are several ways of cashing\nout the distinction between sparse properties and abundant properties\n(see Schaffer (2004) for a thorough discussion). The basic idea is\nthat sparse properties are somehow more fundamental than abundant\nproperties (they somehow \u201ccarve nature at the joints\u201d).\nWhat is important is that on any plausible account of the distinction,\nthe properties invoked by Fine will not count as sparse properties.\nThus, condition (2) will not be satisfied.\n\nDavid Denby (2014) defends a similar version of the modal\ncharacterization, appealing to the more familiar distinction between\nintrinsic properties and extrinsic properties:\n\n\\(P\\) is an essential property of an object \\(o\\)\njust in case (1) it is necessary that \\(o\\) has \\(P\\) if\n\\(o\\) exists, and (2) \\(P\\) is an intrinsic property.\n\n\nRoughly, an intrinsic property is a property that an object possesses\nin isolation, while an extrinsic property is a property that\nan object possesses only in relation to other objects. Again\nthere are different ways of cashing out this distinction. But again\nthe important point is that on any plausible account of the\ndistinction, the properties invoked by Fine will not count as\nintrinsic properties. Thus, condition (2) will not be\n satisfied.[4]\n\n\nIn connection with the definitional characterization, it should be mentioned that Fine (1994) also argues that modal truths are reducible to truths about essence. Metaphysically necessary truths, for example, are identified with those propositions which are true by virtue of the essence of all objects whatsoever. This reductionist idea has generated a significant amount of literature in recent years. Among others, see Jessica Leech (2018), Carlos Romero (2019), Robert Michels (2019), and Nathan Wildman (forthcoming). \n\n\nIn addition to the modal characterization and the definitional\ncharacterization, there is yet another way of characterizing the\nnotion of an essential property. It agrees with the definitional\ncharacterization that the modal characterization is too liberal in\nwhat it counts as essential, but it avoids appeal to the notion of a\ndefinition of an object. On the explanatory characterization,\nthe essential properties of an object are the object\u2019s deepest\nexplanatory properties\u2014those properties that figure\nfundamentally into explanations of the object\u2019s possessing the\nother properties it does. (For example, having six protons might count\nas an essential property of a carbon atom because this property\nfigures fundamentally into explanations of its possession of other\nproperties, like its bonding characteristics.) This sort of account\nthreatens to make the essential/accidental property distinction\nrelative, since what counts as explanatorily primary seems to depend\non the interests and abilities of the explainers. Some advocates of the explanatory characterization, such as Meghan Sullivan (2017), are willing to accept that the distinction is relative in some sense. Others, such as\nIrving Copi (1954) and Michael Gorman (2005), hold that there is a\nmore \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and less \u201cepistemic\u201d\nunderstanding of the notion of explanation, according to which one\nthing explains another thing just in case there is a certain\nmind-independent relation that holds between them. Just as the\nadvocate of the definitional characterization is challenged to provide\na respectable understanding of the relevant notion of definition, the\nadvocate of the explanatory characterization is challenged to provide\n(or to borrow from the philosophy of science) a respectable\nunderstanding of the relevant notion of explanation.\n\nThe distinction between accidental and essential properties is, at\nleast on the most basic version of each account, both exclusive and\nexhaustive. (On some more refined versions of these accounts, the\ndistinction remains exclusive, but not exhaustive. Exhaustiveness is\nlost when certain properties\u2014like the property of being such\nthat there are infinitely many primes\u2014are not counted as\nproperties to which the essential/accidental distinction applies. See\nthe discussion of Della Rocca (1996a) in \u00a73.) In addition, it\nseems that the root of each of the characterizations goes back at\nleast to the work of Aristotle. (For the modal characterization, see\nTopics 102b5ff; for the definitional, see\nMetaphysics 1031a12; and for the explanatory, see\nPosterior Analytics 74b5ff. For more on the notion of essence\nin Aristotle\u2019s work, see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.)\n It is not clear whether these three characterizations should properly\nbe thought of as competing characterizations of a single notion or\ninstead as ways of trying to capture three related, but different, and\nequally legitimate, notions. (A similar point has been made by Livingstone-Banks (2017) and Cowling(2013).) Since the modal characterization has been so common, and since the distinction between essential and accidental properties, which is the topic of this entry, is almost always understood modally, it will dominate the remainder of this entry.\n3. Four Ways of Characterizing Essentialism\n\nThere are at least four fairly standard ways of characterizing\nessentialism, and by considering two extreme views, we can easily see\nthe differences among these four characterizations. According to the\nfirst extreme view\u2014one that it is natural to call maximal\nessentialism\n\nall of any given object\u2019s properties are essential to it.\n\n\nAccording to the other extreme view\u2014one that it is natural to call\nminimal essentialism\n\nthere are virtually no limits to the ways in which any given object\nmight have been different from the way that it actually is, so that\nthe only essential properties of an object are what we might think of\nas its trivial essential properties\u2014properties like being either\n\\(F\\) or non-\\(F\\) (for any property \\(F\\)) and being\nself-identical.\n\n\nShould so-called minimal essentialism really count as a form of\nessentialism? And should so-called maximal essentialism really count\nas a form of essentialism? There are four positions in logical space\nwith respect to these questions: yes and yes; yes and no; no and yes;\nand no and no. Each of these positions is occupied by some reasonably\nprominent characterization of\n essentialism.[5]\n\nThe first position\u2014according to which both \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d and \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d count as\ngenuine forms of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the\ncharacterization of essentialism that was offered at the outset:\n\nthe doctrine that (at least some) objects have (at least some)\nessential properties.\n\n\nWe are inclined to think that this simple and straightforward\ncharacterization is the most common understanding of essentialism,\nalthough it is rarely explicitly stated. (Mackie (2006, p. 1) provides\nan example of someone who does explicitly use this\ncharacterization.)\n\nThe second position\u2014according to which \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d but not \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d counts\nas a genuine form of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the\ncharacterization that Quine (1953b/1976, pp. 175\u20136) very\nfamously offered:\n\nthe doctrine that some of the attributes of a thing (quite\nindependently of the language in which the thing is referred to, if at\nall) may be essential to the thing, and others accidental.\n\n\nIn more formal terms, essentialism, Quine (1953b/1976, p. 176) says,\nis the doctrine that there are true sentences of this form:\n\\(\\exists x(\\Box Fx \\amp Gx \\amp{\\sim}\\Box Gx)\\) (where\n\u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 may be read as \u2018it is necessary\nthat\u2019). According to \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d any\ngiven object has only essential properties. It has no accidental ones.\nThat means that according to \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d, there\nwill be no properties to \u201cgo in for\u201d the\n\u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 in Quine\u2019s sentence schema; and so,\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d is no form of essentialism at all\non Quine\u2019s characterization.\n\nThe third position\u2014according to which \u201cmaximal\nessentialism\u201d but not \u201cminimal essentialism\u201d counts\nas a form of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the characterization of\nessentialism as\n\nthe view that (at least some) objects have (at least some) non-trivial\nnecessary properties.\n\n\nDella Rocca (1996a) thinks of essentialism in this way, and so counts\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d but not \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d as a form of essentialism. (It is natural to\nsuppose that Della Rocca thinks that essential properties are\nnon-trivial necessary properties, so that he can say things\nlike, \u201cEssentialism is the view that some objects have some\nessential properties.\u201d If this is what Della Rocca thinks, then\non his view, either the essential/accidental distinction is not exhaustive\u2014since trivial necessary properties, like being such that there are infinitely many primes, are neither accidental nor essential\u2014or the distinction is exhaustive but being such that there are infinitely many primes is counted an accidental property, contrary to intuition.)\n\nThe fourth position\u2014according to which neither \u201cminimal\nessentialism\u201d nor \u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d counts as a\nform of essentialism\u2014is occupied by the characterization of\nessentialism as\n\nthe view that the accidental/essential property distinction is robust\nin the sense that (at least some) objects have (at least some)\nnon-trivial essential properties and (at least some) objects have (at\nleast some) accidental properties.\n\n\nYablo (1998) has this characterization in mind, and so he\ncharacterizes both \u201cminimal essentialism\u201d and\n\u201cmaximal essentialism\u201d as forms of anti-essentialism.\n\nIn the remainder of this entry, essentialism will be understood in the\nfirst of the four ways\u2014so maximal essentialism and minimal\nessentialism will both be viewed as forms of essentialism.\n4. Some Varieties of Essentialism\n\nA variety of particular forms of essentialism have been advocated.\nStarting at one extreme, there is maximal essentialism. Although\nLeibniz famously held this view, it nearly goes without saying that\nthis view has had relatively few adherents. According to a less\nextreme and correspondingly more popular form of essentialism,\norigin essentialism, an object could not have had a radically\ndifferent origin than it in fact had. The view that a particular table\ncould not have been originally made from completely different material\nthan the material from which it was actually originally made and the\nview that a person could not have originated from a different sperm\nand egg than those from which he or she actually originated are both\nforms of origin essentialism. Origin essentialism has been defended by\nKripke (1972/1980) Salmon (1981), and Forbes (1985), among others.\nAccording to another moderate form of essentialism, sortal\nessentialism, an object could not have been of a radically\ndifferent kind\u2014at least for certain kinds\u2014than it in fact\nis. Both the view that being human (or being human if existent) is an\nessential property of Socrates and the view that Socrates could not\nhave been a credit card account are forms of sortal essentialism. The\nmildest form of essentialism is minimal essentialism. Mackie (2006)\noffers a sustained defense of roughly this view.\n\nIn addition to these sorts of claims about the essential properties of\nordinary individuals, claims about the essential properties of natural\nkinds have figured prominently in the literature, since Kripke\n(1972/1980) and Putnam (1975) made essentialist claims concerning, for\nexample, cats and water. The core intuitions are that in any possible\nworld anything that is not an animal is not a cat and that in any\npossible world anything that is not composed of molecules of\nH2O is not water. Since we discovered empirically that cats\nare animals (and not, for example, robots) and that water is\nH2O (and not some other type of molecule), each of these\nclaims asserts a necessary a posteriori connection between\ntwo properties. In the first case, what is asserted is that it is\nnecessary that anything that is a cat is an animal. In the second\ncase, what is asserted is that necessarily anything that is (a sample\nof) water is composed of molecules of\n H2O.[6]\n It is natural to construe these claims on the model of the\nessentialist claims we have so far considered: it is essential to a\nparticular object, namely the species cat, to be such that\nall of its instances are also instances of the kind animal; it is\nessential to a particular object, namely the kind water, to\nbe such that all samples of it are composed of molecules of\nH2O. Notice that one may hold that cats are essentially\nanimals in the sense that there is a necessary a posteriori\nconnection between the property of being a cat and the property of\nbeing an animal, without holding that any particular cat is\nessentially an animal. In other words, from the fact that it is\nnecessary that every individual that is a cat is an animal, it does\nnot follow that every individual that is in fact a cat is such that\nnecessarily it is an animal. In still other words, this type of\nessentialism about natural kinds does not entail sortal\nessentialism.\n\nIt is perhaps worth mentioning that similar remarks apply to the case\nof a necessary a priori connection between properties. It is\na necessary a priori truth that all mathematicians are\nrational. Following our model, we can say that it is essential to\nthe kind mathematician to be such that all of its instances\nare also instances of the kind rational (thing). It does not\nfollow that Andrew Wiles, who is in fact a mathematician, could not\nfail to be rational\u2014in which case he would also fail to be a\nmathematician. To give an even more perspicuous example, it is a\nnecessary a priori truth that all bachelors are unmarried. It\ndoes not follow that Michael, who is in fact a bachelor, could not be\nmarried.\n\nPhilosophers have thought not only about whether an object has this or\nthat particular property essentially but also about whether an object\nhas a special kind of essential property, an individual\nessence, a property that in addition to being essential to the\nobject is also unique to it in the sense that having that property is\nmodally sufficient for being that object (that is, it is not possible\nthat something distinct from that object has that property). A trivial\nexample of an individual essence is a haecceity or\nthisness of an object, the property of being (identical to)\nthat very object. Some have defended the claim that there are\nsubstantive examples of individual essences. Leibniz famously held\nthat there are, and that they can be given by purely qualitative\n(general) properties. Forbes (1985) also holds that there are\nsubstantive individual essences, but he disagrees with Leibniz that\nthey can be given by purely qualitative properties. Instead, he\nthinks, an individual essence involves non-purely qualitative\n(singular) properties: for example, Socrates\u2019s essence involves\noriginating from the particular sperm and egg from which he actually\noriginated. For more on modal sufficiency principles, see the\n\nSupplement on Arguments for Origin Essentialism.\n \n5. Suspicions about Essentialism\n\nIn \u00a73, we passed over without comment the parenthetical phrase\nfrom Quine\u2019s characterization of essentialism. Adding that\nphrase to the first view of essentialism from \u00a73 yields:\n\nessentialism is the doctrine that (at least some) objects have\nindependently of how they are referred to (at least some)\nessential properties.\n\n\nThe added phrase stresses that the essentialist thinks that it at\nleast makes sense to ask of an object (\u201cin itself\u201d)\nwhether it must have a particular property. Skeptics about\nessentialism have doubted the very intelligibility of such a question.\nHere is one prominent thought behind such anti-essentialism. (See\nQuine 1960, pp. 195\u2013200.) Since it is necessary that seven plus two is\ngreater than seven, when the number nine is referred to as\n\u2018seven plus two\u2019 it is essentially greater than seven.\nBut, since it is not necessary that the number of planets is greater\nthan seven, when the number nine is referred to as \u2018the number\nof planets\u2019 it is not essentially greater than seven. The point\nis supposed to be that it makes no sense to say of the number nine,\nindependently of any way of referring to it, that it is or is not\nessentially greater than seven. Similarly, an anti-essentialist might\nsay that when a person who is both a mathematician and a cyclist is\nthought of as a mathematician, being rational is essential to him,\nwhile being two-legged is not; but when the very same person is\nthought of as a cyclist, then although being two-legged is essential\nto him, being rational is not. Again, the point is supposed to be that\nit makes no sense to say of the very person who is the mathematical\ncyclist, independently of any way of thinking about him, that he is or\nis not essentially rational (or two-legged). According to the\nanti-essentialist, asking whether Andrew Wiles (who we may suppose is\na cycling mathematician) could fail to be rational is like asking\nwhether Andrew Wiles is taller than\u2014both questions demand\nanother relatum. Could he fail to be rational, relative to what\nway of referring to him? Is he taller than whom?\n\nIn response the essentialist will point out that the\nanti-essentialist\u2019s thought does not square very well with\nintuition. Consider the object that is referred to by all these\nphrases: \u2018nine\u2019, \u2018seven plus two\u2019, \u2018the\nnumber of planets\u2019. Could that very object have failed\nto be greater than seven? Intuitively the question seems intelligible,\nand the answer seems to be that it could not have failed to be greater\nthan seven. According to intuition then, the very object that is\nreferred to by \u2018the number of planets\u2019 (which is the very\nsame object that is referred to by \u2018seven plus two\u2019 and\n\u2018nine\u2019) is essentially greater than seven. Intuition also\nhas it that the claim that the number of planets is greater than seven\nis not itself necessary. To add some jargon: Intuition has it that the\nclaim that it is necessary that the number of planets is greater than\nseven is true read de re (\u201cof the thing\u201d), but\nfalse read de dicto (\u201cof the dictum\u201d or \u201cof\nthe statement\u201d). (The de re reading is this: the number\nof planets has the property of being necessarily greater than seven.\nThe de dicto reading is this: the claim that the number of\nplanets is greater than seven has the property of being necessary.)\nThe essentialist is pointing out that the anti-essentialist\u2019s argument\nasserts that the latter intuition undermines the former, but does not\nsay why.\n6. The Epistemology of Essentialist Claims\n\nAssuming that we have knowledge of some essentialist claims, how might\nwe account for that knowledge? For the purposes of the present\ndiscussion, let us assume that we know that being such that there are\ninfinitely many primes, being human, and originating from sperm\n\\(s\\) and egg \\(e\\) are essential properties of Socrates.\nThe first example is different from the last two in that it seems that\nwe can know a priori that being such that there are\ninfinitely many primes is essential to Socrates whereas it seems that\nwe can know only a posteriori that being human and\noriginating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) are also essential to\nhim.\n\nWhile it is a vexed philosophical issue just how to account for a\npriori knowledge of necessary truths such as logical truths,\nmathematical truths, and the homelier necessary truths like the truth\nthat nothing can be red all over and green all over at the same time,\naccounting for our knowledge of the necessary truth that Socrates is\nsuch that there are infinitely many primes, does not seem to be\nproblematic in some extra special way. If we had a good account of our\na priori knowledge of the necessary truth that there are\ninfinitely many primes, then it would take little more to account for\nour knowledge of the necessary truth about Socrates that he is such\nthat there are infinitely many primes.\n\nKripke (1972/1980) suggests that our knowledge of some other\nessentialist claims is based in part on a bit of a priori\nknowledge and in part on a bit of empirical knowledge. For example,\nour knowledge that originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is\nessential to Socrates is based in part on our a priori\nknowledge that every organism has its origin essentially and in part\non our empirical knowledge that Socrates (is an organism that)\noriginated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\). (Similarly our knowledge\nthat Socrates is essentially human appears to be based in part on our\na priori knowledge that everything has its kind essentially\nand in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates is (of the kind)\nhuman.) Thus, our knowledge of the claim that originating from\n\\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is essential to Socrates should be no more\nproblematic epistemologically than our knowledge of the two claims on\nwhich it is based and our knowledge of the validity of the argument\nfrom those two claims. As we have already mentioned, although there\nare difficult philosophical issues concerning our knowledge of logical\ntruths, our knowledge of the validity of the argument in question does\nnot seem to add any special problems of its own. Similarly, although\nthere are philosophical issues concerning empirical knowledge, our\nknowledge that Socrates originated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) does\nnot appear to add any special problems. However our a priori\nknowledge that every organism has its origin essentially does seem to\nhave special problems over and above the problems associated with\naccounting for our a priori knowledge of logic, mathematics,\nand the homelier necessary truths. The latter claims are generally\nsupported by universally held intuitions or by arguments that are\nuniversally accepted whereas the former, like most philosophical\nclaims, is supported by a less robust intuition and by a more\ncontroversial argument. To see in some detail how philosophers have\ngone about defending origin essentialism, see the\n\nSupplement on Arguments for Origin Essentialism.\n \n\nFor more about arguments for sortal essentialism, see Wiggins (1980)\nand Mackie (2006, chapters 7 and 8). The entry on\n the epistemology of modality\n is useful on general issues in modal epistemology.\n7. Essentialist Claims in Arguments for Nonidentities\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according\nto which, if \u201ctwo\u201d things are identical, then they share\nall their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of\nnonidentity. If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy\nmajor and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is\nnot identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some\nprominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain\nbrand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way:\n\\(X\\) is essentially a thinking thing; \\(X\\)\u2019s body is\nnot essentially a thinking thing; so \\(X\\) is not (identical to)\n\\(X\\)\u2019s body. A similar argument can be given for the\nconclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material\n(wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a\nhuman-shaped statue\u2014call it \u2018Goliath\u2019\u2014and the\nlump of wax that composes it\u2014call it\n\u2018Lump\\(_1\\)\u2019. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout\nits entire existence composed of Lump\\(_1\\) while\nLump\\(_1\\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In\nthis case, Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are spatiotemporally\ncolocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same\nspatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This\nbeing the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17\nkilograms and so does Lump\\(_1\\); Goliath has a white surface\nand so does Lump\\(_1\\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious\nthat we are writing as though there are two things at all.\nWhy not say simply that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are identical?\nWell, it at least seems that a pretty straightforward\nargument\u2014one that relies on essentialist\nclaims\u2014establishes their nonidentity:\n\nGoliath is essentially human-shaped. \nLump\\(_1\\) is not essentially human-shaped.\nSo, Goliath is not identical to Lump\\(_1\\).\n\n\nThe plausibility of the two premises seems undeniable, given that we\nthink, for example, that if the room containing\nGoliath/Lump\\(_1\\) were to get really hot (hot enough to melt\nthe wax) and then to cool again (so that what was left was a lump of\nwax in the shape of something like a mountain), then Goliath would be\ndestroyed while Lump\\(_1\\) would still exist. And the reasoning\nlooks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\\(_1\\), then each would\nhave to have all of the same properties as \u201cthe other\u201d;\nsince they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few\nthings in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz\u2019s Law of\nthe Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute\nabout the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile\nour intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think\nthat Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are not really two things but just\none is a version of the problem of material constitution.\nThere are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A\n\u201ctwo-thinger\u201d\u2014one who thinks that there really are\ntwo things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one\nlocation\u2014may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and\nLump\\(_1\\). Other responses suggest that there is something\namiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this\nkind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca (1996c) holds\nthat such arguments are question begging; Lewis (1971) and Noonan\n(1991) hold that they are invalid; and Burke (1994) and Rea (2000)\nhold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false.\nFor those who are interested, Rea (1997) is a good place to start to\ndelve more deeply into this problem.\n",
