The Early Modern Reception of Locke\u2019s Picture of Persons\n\nThis section addresses how Locke\u2019s view was received by his\ncontemporaries and by those writing in the remainder of the early\nmodern period (16th-18th centuries). A good\nnumber of philosophers vehemently objected to Locke\u2019s treatment\nof persons, though some defended it, and many others used it as an\ninspiration, or springboard, for their own views.\n\nMany who objected to Locke\u2019s treatment of persons did so because\nthey objected to the decreased importance Locke places on the soul for\npersonhood and personal persistence (see Joseph Butler, Thomas Reid,\nand Samuel Clarke, for example). Many such philosophers argue that\nnumerical identity consists in no change at all, and the only\nkind of entity that allows for identity in this strict sense is an\nimmaterial substance. \n\nAlong the way, some charged Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity\nwith circularity. As Joseph Butler puts it, \n\n\n\u2026[O]ne should really think it self-evident that consciousness\nof personal identity presupposes, and therefore cannot constitute,\npersonal identity; any more than knowledge, in any other case, can\nconstitute truth, which it presupposes. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nButler then asserts that Locke\u2019s misstep stems from his\nmethodology. He says, \n\n\nThis wonderful mistake may possibly have arisen from hence; that to be\nendued with consciousness is inseparable from the idea of a person, or\nintelligent being. For this might be expressed inaccurately thus, that\nconsciousness makes personality: and from hence it might be concluded\nto make personal identity. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nOne of the points that Locke emphasizes\u2014that persistence\nconditions are determined via defining kind terms\u2014is what,\naccording to Butler, leads Locke astray.\n\nButler additionally makes the point that memory is not required for\npersonal persistence. He says, \n\n\nBut though present consciousness of what we at present do and feel is\nnecessary to our being the persons we now are; yet present\nconsciousness of past actions or feelings is not necessary to our\nbeing the same persons who performed those actions, or had those\nfeelings. (1736 [1842: 298]) \n\n\nThis is a point that others develop when they assert that\nLocke\u2019s view results in contradiction.\n\nThe most popular, or well known, version of this line of objection\ncomes from Thomas Reid (1785). In the \u201cbrave officer\u201d\nobjection, Reid poses the following challenge to Locke\u2019s theory\nof personal identity. He says:\n\n\nSuppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school for\nrobbing an orchard, to have taken a standard from the enemy in his\nfirst campaign, and to have been made a general in advanced life;\nsuppose, also, which must be admitted to be possible, that, when he\ntook the standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged at\nschool, and that, when made a general, he was conscious of his taking\nthe standard, but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his\nflogging. These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine, that he who was flogged at school is the same\nperson who took the standard, and that he who took the standard is the\nsame person who was made a general. Whence it follows, if there be any\ntruth in logic, that the general is the same person with him who was\nflogged at school. But the general\u2019s consciousness does not\nreach so far back as his flogging; therefore, according to Mr.\nLocke\u2019s doctrine, he is not the person who was flogged.\nTherefore, the general is, and at the same time is not, the same\nperson with him who was flogged at school. (Reid 1785 [1851:\n248\u2013249]) \n\n\nIn this exercise (and other similar versions of it) we are supposed to\nassume Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity, and maintain that\nsameness of person consists in sameness of consciousness. When we do,\nReid expects we will conclude that the general (C) is the same person\nas he who took the standard from the enemy (B) because the general (C)\nremembers doing so. Additionally he who took the standard from the\nenemy (B) is the same person as he who was flogged at school for\nrobbing the orchard (A) because he (B) remembers that past traumatic\nexperience. Thus C (he who is was made general) is identical to B (he\nwho took the standard) and B (he who took the standard) is identical\nto A (he who was flogged at school).\n\nGiven the law of transitivity (which says that if C is identical to B\nand B is identical to A, then C is identical to A), we should conclude\nthat C (the general) is identical to A (the flogged school boy). But,\nsince we are assuming Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity, Reid\nthinks we cannot come to this conclusion. If we assume Locke\u2019s\nview, Reid contends that we have to conclude that C (the general) is\nnot identical to A (the school boy). This is because C (the general)\nhas no consciousness or memory of having been flogged at school\n(A).\n\nThis and other similar objections are meant to show that if we place\nthe identity of persons in the identity of consciousness, as Locke\nsuggests, then we run into a problem\u2014namely one of\ncontradiction\u2014for we get the result that C and A both are, and\nare not, identical. Nevertheless, as is made clear above, there is\ndebate about whether Locke\u2019s claims about identity of\nconsciousness should be read in terms of memory, and whether Reid is\ncorrect to take \u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cconsciousness\u201d\nas synonymous terms for Locke.\n\nCircularity and contradiction are just two of the major objections\nlaunched at Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity shortly after it\nis published. Importantly, these are objections to which sympathetic\nreaders of Locke are still responding (see Atherton 1983, Weinberg\n2016, LoLordo 2012, Thiel 2011, Garrett 2003, Schechtman 2014, etc).\nThis gives the reader a glimpse of some of the lines of attack that\nwere launched against Locke\u2019s discussion of persons during the\nearly modern period. Nevertheless, not all of Locke\u2019s peers\nattacked his picture of persons, and numerous philosophers worked to\ndefend his view.\n\nOne such philosopher is Catharine Trotter Cockburn. Cockburn pens her\nDefence of Mr. Locke\u2019s Essay of Human Understanding in\n 1702.[9]\n In this text, Cockburn is responding to three pamphlets directed at\nLocke\u2019s\n Essay.[10]\n These pamphlets take aim at Locke\u2019s Essay rather\nbroadly, and Cockburn\u2019s Defence reflects this, but much\nis said about Locke on persons and their persistence conditions\ntherein. Specifically, these pamphlets charge Locke with not proving\nthat the soul is immortal, or threatening proofs of the immortality of\nthe soul. They additionally charge that Locke\u2019s view leaves us\nwith the strange consequence that our souls are in constant flux,\nmaking it the case that we \u201cawake with new souls each\nmorning\u201d. Given the importance of the soul, its persistence, and\nits immortality, to many traditional theories of personal identity,\nthese objections are arguably intended to be objections to\nLocke\u2019s picture of persons. Cockburn is quick to defend Locke,\nbut proceeds carefully and thoroughly as she does so.\n\nCockburn points out that Locke never sets out to prove the soul\nimmortal, and Locke actually claims that it is more probable\nthat the soul is immaterial, than material. Moreover, even if Locke is\nnot committed to the soul being immaterial, this ought not threaten\nproofs of the immortality of the soul. This is because what allows\nLocke to speculate that God could have superadded thinking to formerly\ninert systems of matter is that God is omnipotent, and surely an\nomnipotent being could make souls immortal even if they are material.\nMoreover, proofs for the immortality of the soul that rely on the\nimmateriality of the soul are not likely to convince laymen of the\nsoul\u2019s immortality, and may actually leave them sceptical about\nwhether the soul is indeed immortal (even if it is immaterial). \n\nCockburn additionally attacks the assertion that Locke\u2019s claim\nthat \u201cmen think not always\u201d threatens proofs of the\nimmortality of the soul. Of this she says,\n\n\nBut let it be granted, that it is ever so clearly proved, that\nthinking is necessary to the soul\u2019s existence, that can no more\nprove, that it shall always exist, than it proves, that it has always\nexisted; it being as possible for that omnipotence, which from nothing\ngave the soul a being, to deprive it of that being\nin the midst of its most vigorous reflections, as in an utter\nsuspension of all thought. If then this proposition, that the soul\nalways thinks, does not prove, that it is immortal, the contrary\nsupposition takes not away any proof of it; for it is no less easy to\nconceive, that a being, which has the power of thinking with some\nintervals of cessation from thought, that has existed here for some\ntime in a capacity of happiness or misery, may be continued in, or\nrestored to the same state, in a future life, than that a\nBeing which always thinks, may be continued in the same\nstate. (Cockburn, in Sheridan (ed) 2006: 53) \n\n\nAs Cockburn points out, the notion that the soul is always thinking is\nnot used as evidence for the soul\u2019s immortality. Locke\u2019s\nclaim to the contrary thus ought not count as evidence against it, and\nwe ought to have faith that an omnipotent God will ensure the\nsoul\u2019s immortality (whether it always thinks or not).\nAdditionally, there is ample evidence that Locke thinks the soul is\nimmortal, and that persons will go on to receive divine punishment and\nreward in the next life for their deeds in this life. This comes\nthrough not just in L-N 2.27 of the Essay, but also in\nLocke\u2019s correspondence with Stillingfleet, and many of\nLocke\u2019s religious writings, including the posthumously published\n\u201cResurrectio et quae secuuntur\u201d (though Cockburn\nwould not have had access to the latter while drafting her\n Defence).[11]\n\nFinally, Cockburn argues that the assumption that Locke\u2019s view\nentails that we \u201cawake with new souls each morning\u201d rests\non a misunderstanding. Just as a body that was in motion and comes to\nrest does not become a new body once it starts moving again, a soul\nthat was thinking and ceases to think does not become a new soul once\nthought is restored to it. Thus, Locke\u2019s claim that we do not\nalways think\u2014and indeed may have dreamless sleep\u2014does not\nhave the absurd consequences for the persistence of persons that the\npamphlets charge. To this it might also be added that even if we awake\nwith new souls each morning, it need not mean that we are new persons\neach morning, according to Locke.\n\nThrough the Defence, Cockburn additionally makes clear that\nalthough Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity allows for sci-fi\nswitches such as those described in the \u201cprince and the\ncobbler\u201d passage (L-N 2.27.15), the \u201cwaking and sleeping\nSocrates\u201d passage (2.27.19), and the \u201cday and\nnight-man\u201d passage (2.27.23), Locke does not think that this is\nthe way things ordinarily go. In other words, in\nLocke\u2019s view it is not that persons are switching bodies and\nswapping souls on a regular basis. Rather, Locke is making clear that\nwe should distinguish between the concepts \u201cman\u201d,\n\u201cbody\u201d, \u201csoul\u201d, and \u201cperson\u201d.\nMoreover, the persistence of any person does not always align with the\npersistence of a human being or soul, as many assume. Making this\npoint is the purpose of those imaginary cases.\n\nSixty-seven years after Cockburn\u2019s Defence, and\ntwenty-one years after the correspondence between Cockburn and Edmund\nLaw ends, Law drafts a Defence of his own. Law\u2019s\nDefence of Mr. Locke\u2019s Opinion Concerning Personal\nIdentity (1769) is later included in the 1823 version of\nLocke\u2019s Works, and in it Law offers a particular\nreading of the ontological status of persons. Law defends a\nconsciousness-based view, and makes much of Locke\u2019s claim that\nperson is a \u201cforensic term\u201d. Law moves from this point to\nthe conclusion that Locke thinks persons are modes (or attributes)\nrather than substances (or things in themselves). He says, \n\n\nNow the word Person, as is well observed by Mr.\nLocke\u2026is properly a forensick term, and here\nto be used in the strickt forensick sense, denoting some such quality\nor modification in man as denominates him a moral agent, or an\naccountable creature; renders him the proper subject of\nLaws, and a true object of Rewards or Punishments. (1823:\n1\u20132) \n\n\nThis is significant since whether Lockean persons are best thought of\nas substances, modes, or relations is something that is still debated\namongst Locke scholars today.\n\nWhile some philosophers were happy to defend Locke, as Cockburn and\nLaw did, numerous philosophers writing in the eighteenth century\nutilized Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity as a stepping stone\nto establish their own even more provocative views on persons. The\nways in which these theorists go beyond Locke varies. Some of these\nare outlined\n below.[12]\n\nIn Anthony Collins\u2019s correspondence with Samuel Clarke\n(1707\u20131708), it can often look as if Collins is a mere defender\nof Locke\u2019s view. Collins holds a consciousness-based view of\npersonal identity, and Collins invokes Locke\u2019s discussion of\npersons and their persistence conditions throughout this lengthy\nexchange. Nevertheless, Collins takes Locke\u2019s assertion that for\nall we know God could have superadded the ability to think to formerly\ninert systems of matter, and runs with it. As Larry Jorgensen puts\nit,\n\n\nA significant difference between Collins and Locke\u2026is that\nCollins thought that material systems provided a better explanatory\nbasis for consciousness, which changes the probability calculus.\nCollins provides evidence that casts doubt on Locke\u2019s claim that\n\u201cit is in the highest degree probable\u201d that humans have\nimmaterial souls. Although he is building from a Lockean starting\npoint, namely the possibility that God might superadd thinking to\nmatter, he ends up with a naturalized version: thinking \u201cfollows\nfrom the composition or modification of a material system\u201d\n(Clarke and Collins 2011: 48). (Jorgensen forthcoming) \n\n\nCollins\u2019s view on personal identity is a consciousness-based\nview, but what gives rise to consciousness, according to Collins, is\nlikely a material system. Thus some take Locke\u2019s purported\nagnosticism about the substantial nature of finite thinkers, and\nproceed more forcefully in the direction of materialism. In other\nwords, Locke\u2019s views on the substantial nature of finite\nthinkers opens the door to materialist views of persons and their\npersistence conditions.\n\nOthers take criticisms launched at Locke\u2019s theory of personal\nidentity, including the criticism that the self (or persisting self)\nis a fiction, and appear to embrace such\n consequences.[13]\n This can be seen rather readily in David Hume\u2019s Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1738). In the Treatise, Hume asserts that\nit is not clear how we can even have an idea of the self. This is\nbecause most take selves to be persisting entities, and all of our\nideas come from corresponding impressions. But since our impressions\nconstantly change, there is no one impression that can give rise to\nthe idea we call \u201cself\u201d. Of this Hume says,\n\n\nIt must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea.\nBut self or person is not any one impression, but that to which our\nseveral impressions and ideas are suppos\u2019d to have a reference.\nIf any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must\ncontinue invariably the same, thro the whole course of our lives;\nsince self is suppos\u2019d to exist after that manner. But there is\nno impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and\njoy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist\nat the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these\nimpressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is\nderiv\u2019d; and consequently there is no such idea. (1738 Book I,\nPart IV, Section VI [1896: 251\u2013252]) \n\n\nMoreover, whenever Hume looks for himself, all he finds are\nimpressions. He says, \n\n\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I\nalways stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or\ncold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch\nmyself at any time without a perception, and never can\nobserve any thing but the perception. (1738 [1896: 252]) \n\n\nThis leads Hume to claim that we are just bundles of perceptions, in\nconstant flux (1738 [1896: 252]).\n\nThus it is not only the case that we fail to have an idea of the self,\naccording to Hume, but also the case that, properly speaking, no\nsubsisting self persists from one moment to the next. It is the\nimagination that leads us astray when we think of ourselves, and other\nentities, as persisting over time (1738 [1896: 254]). As Hume puts it,\n\n\n\nThe identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a\nfictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to\nvegetables and animal bodies. (1738 [1896: 259]) \n\n\nHe goes on, \n\n\nIt cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed from a\nlike operation of the imagination upon like objects. (1738 [1896:\n259]) \n\n\nIn moving away from a more traditional substance-based view of\npersonal identity (where the identity of person lies in the identity\nof soul), Locke opens the door to more fragmentary treatments of\nselves and\n persons.[14]\n\n\nAlong similar lines, some take Locke\u2019s claim that the identity\nof persons lies in the identity of consciousness as fuel for the\nassertion that, properly speaking, there is no special relation\nbetween person x and any other future person. That is,\npersonal identity only exists between present and past selves, not\npresent and future selves. For this reason, we ought not have\nprudential concern, or concern for a future self that is distinct from\nour concern for others. This is the argumentative move that William\nHazlitt makes, and in An Essay on the Principles of Human\nAction (1805), he explicitly sets as his task showing \n\n\n\u2026that the human mind is naturally disinterested, or that it is\nnaturally interested in the welfare of others in the same way, and\nfrom the same motives, by which we are impelled to the pursuit of our\nown interests. (1805: 1) \n\n\nThis line of argumentation is replicated and expanded almost one\nhundred and eighty years later by Derek Parfit in Reasons and\nPersons (1984), though it does not appear that Parfit is aware of\nHazlitt\u2019s view when he drafts his\n own.[15]\n",
