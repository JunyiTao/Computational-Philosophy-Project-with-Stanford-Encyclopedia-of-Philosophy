    "main_text": "What sorts of entities are works of art? || Type-token distinctions\n3.2 Type-token distinctions\n\n\nMany philosophers who have sought to say what sorts of entities works\nof art are have spoken of \u2018types\u2019 and\n\u2018tokens\u2019, an idiom which can be traced back to Charles\nSanders Peirce (1931\u20131958, IV, para. 537, 423). (For background,\nincluding a discussion of Peirce\u2019s statements on the topic, see the\nentry on types and tokens.) One idea that some art ontologists have\nfound promising is that as a special sort of abstraction, types have\nfeatures that should be kept in mind as we seek to solve the paradox\nof creation and other vexed issues, such as the question of how a work\nof art can have particular perceptible qualities if it is an\nimperceptible abstract object. As becomes apparent below, however, the\nconclusions on this score have been quite diverse.\n\n\nAlthough Wollheim has at times wrongly been credited with this move,\nthe earliest explicit reference to the type-token distinction in the\nliterature on the ontology of art is to be found in Rudner\n(1950). Subsequent philosophers who have discussed applications of\ntype-token distinctions in the philosophy of art include Charles\nStevenson (1957, 1958), Meager (1958\u201359) Margolis (1958, 1959,\n1961), W. D. L. Scobie (1960), Wacker (1960), Khatchadourian (1960),\nRuth Saw (1961), Donald F. Henze (1957, 1961), Jay E. Bacharach\n(1971), Nigel Harrison (1975), R. A. Sharpe (1979, 1995, 2001),\nRossberg (2012), and Davies (2012).\n\n\nRudner brought up the type-token distinction in the context of a\ncritique of Lewis\u2019s (1946) idea that a work of art is a\ncontextualized abstract entity. Rudner conjectured that what Lewis had\nin mind in talking about the relationship between an abstract entity\nand its renditions or instances was the type-token relation. This\nconjecture makes sense given that Lewis was one of the first American\nphilosophers to read his way through the Peircean Nachlass,\nwhich he found stored in cartons in the first office he was assigned\nat Harvard. Lewis indeed refers to Peirce at times in his (1946), but\nhe did not endorse Peirce\u2019s theses about the nature of types; nor did\nLewis use the idiom of types and tokens in the passages where he tried\nto identify what he took to be the special character of the relations\nbetween aesthetic essences and their concrete vehicles, one of his\nmain proposals being that some kinds of works of art depend more than\nothers on concrete objects.\n\n\nStevenson (1957) reached for a type/token distinction in an attempt to\ndisambiguate the intuitively appealing idea that a poem is a written\nor spoken sequence of words. \u2018Word\u2019, Stevenson notes, is\nambiguous between the particular instance or token and the type of\nword. While he finds it tempting to rule that the poem is the type (of\nword sequence), Stevenson considers this to be incompatible with\nordinary discourse about literature, as when we use the title of a\nwork to refer to a particular token, saying \u201cPlease hand me\nParadise Lost.\u201d Stevenson considers it best to\nallow that the work is either a type or a token, leaving the task of\ndisambiguation to context-sensitive usage. He explicitly rejects\nRen\u00e9 Wellek and Austin Warren\u2019s (1942) Ingarden-inspired\nthesis that a work is an abstract item, namely a stratified system of\nnorms. In order to accommodate the idea that meaning is also\nessential to the kind of thing a poem is, Stevenson uses the term\n\u2018megatype\u2019 to pick out classes of word sequences having the\nsame meaning, so that a poem is identifiable as a megatype.\nMegatypes, he would appear to believe, are ultimately reducible to\n\u201ca special kind of physical object or event\u201d (1958, 41 n.\n2), but it is not clear how this analysis will proceed: is the\nconjunction of a meaningful text type and the text types of all of its\npast, present, and future faithful translations a physical object or\nevent?\n\n\nIn an extended criticism of particularist accounts of the\nindividuation and evaluation of works, Meager characterizes a work as\neither a spatiotemporal object or performance that manifests a pattern\nof elements that is the product of a person\u2019s (or group of\npersons\u2019) activity, where the activity was not a matter of\ncopying or servile imitation, and where the object or performance is\nevaluated non-instrumentally. The concept of a work of art, she\ncomments, \u201coperates in a rather special way as a universal\ndefined by a spatio-temporal particular, which may itself therefore be\nregarded as a type-universal\u201d (1958\u201359, 59). According to\nMeager, the identity of the individual artist is not a factor of work\nindividuation: should two different persons independently author poems\nthat happen to consist in the same sequence of words, they have\nindependently authored the same work, even if their motives,\nintentions, and contexts are strikingly different.\n\n\nTurning now to Wollheim\u2019s influential application of a\ntype-token distinction (1968, 1980), what is most noteworthy about his\narticulation of the idea that at least some works of art are best\ncategorized as types is the reason he gives for saying that types are\ndifferent from other \u201cgeneric entities,\u201d and in\nparticular, universals. The relation between a type and its tokens is,\naccording to Wollheim, \u201cmore intimate\u201d than the relation\nbetween a universal (e.g., a property) and its instances. Whereas the\nproperty being white is not itself white, all and only those\nproperties that a token has by virtue of its being a token of a given\ntype are \u201ctransmitted\u201d to that type as well: as no bit of\ncloth that is not rectangular can be a correctly formed token of the\ntype The Union Jack, it follows that the property of being\nrectangular also belongs to the type The Union Jack. This\nidea is endorsed by Oswald Hanfling (1992, 80\u201382), Linda Wetzel\n(2009), and others.\n\n\nThis contention about the \u201cmore intimate\u201d relation between\ntypes, tokens, and their instantiations of properties leaves one to\nwonder how Wollheim conceived of both universals and types.  Unlike\nPeirce, he does not hold that the existence of a type depends on that\nof at least one token; Wollheim seems inclined to accept types as a\nspecies of autonomously existing abstract object. Yet if any item that\ninstantiates the property rectangular must be spatial, and if\nevery token of The Union Jack instantiates that property,\nthen it follows from Wollheim\u2019s claim that The Union\nJack is, qua type, rectangular. It would appear to\nfollow from this that the type must be a concrete, spatially located\nentity, since anything that can literally be rectangular must be\nlocated in space. Yet one of the main reasons for going in for the\ntheory of types in the first place was Peirce\u2019s basic\nobservation that while token word inscriptions of \u2018the\u2019\nhave their times and places, the word the, qua type,\nhas no location. Is it sound to postulate the existence of an\nautonomous abstraction having spatial or temporal features?\n\n\nReicher (1998) acknowledges that if works are types, they cannot\nliterally have spatiotemporal properties. With the aim of providing a\nmore accurate restatement of ordinary talk about the perceptible\nqualities of works, she distinguishes between two different modes of\npredication. In an example of a first mode of predication, someone\nsays \u2018the table is rectangular\u2019. This is contrasted to a\ndifferent mode whereby we say, for example, \u2018this work of art is\ndetermined as [ist bestimmt als] rectangular\u2019. If a\nwork of art has been determined as rectangular, then every realization\nof the work is rectangular. We can perceive a work\u2019s\nrealizations, as these are concrete objects or actions, but strictly\nspeaking, we apprehend [erfassen] but do not perceive the\ntype itself. (For background on this approach, see the entry on\nnonexistent objects.)\n\n\nGuy Rohrbaugh (2003) argues that even in the case of repeatable works\nsuch as photographs, the category of types does not adequately capture\nat least three fundamental features of works of art: temporality (they\ncome into existence and can cease to exist), temporal flexibility\n(some of their qualities can change over time), and modal flexibility\n(a work could have had properties other than those it actually\nhas). According to Rohrbaugh, type theories cannot accommodate this\nkind of modal flexibility. He proposes instead that works of art\nshould be conceived of as historical individuals that persist through\ntime.\n",
