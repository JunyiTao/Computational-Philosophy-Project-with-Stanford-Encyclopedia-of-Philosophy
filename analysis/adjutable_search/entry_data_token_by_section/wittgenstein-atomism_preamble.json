    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough it has few adherents today, logical atomism was once a\nleading movement of early twentieth-century analytic philosophy.\nDifferent, though related, versions of the view were developed by\nBertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Russell\u2019s logical\natomism is set forth chiefly in his 1918 work \u201cThe Philosophy of\nLogical Atomism\u201d (Russell 1956), Wittgenstein\u2019s in his\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus of 1921 (Wittgenstein 1981).\nThe core tenets of Wittgenstein\u2019s logical atomism may be stated\nas follows: (i) Every proposition has a unique final analysis which\nreveals it to be a truth-function of elementary propositions\n(Tractatus 3.25, 4.221, 4.51, 5); (ii) These elementary\npropositions assert the existence of atomic states of affairs (3.25,\n4.21); (iii) Elementary propositions are mutually independent \u2014\neach one can be true or false independently of the truth or falsity of\nthe others (4.211, 5.134); (iv) Elementary propositions are immediate\ncombinations of semantically simple symbols or \u201cnames\u201d\n(4.221); (v) Names refer to items wholly devoid of complexity,\nso-called \u201cobjects\u201d (2.02 & 3.22); (vi) Atomic states\nof affairs are combinations of these objects (2.01).\n\nAlthough these doctrines are recognizably atomist in spirit, the term\n\u2018logical atomism\u2019 is not used by Wittgenstein. It was\nintroduced by Russell in his 1911 lecture to the French Philosophical\nSociety, Le R\u00e9alisme Analytique (Russell\n 1911).[1]\n Russell had advertised \u201cThe Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d as being \u201cvery largely concerned with explaining\ncertain ideas which [he had] learnt from [his] friend and former pupil\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u201d (Marsh, 177). No doubt partly as a result\nof this description, the term \u2018logical atomism\u2019\nsubsequently became associated with Wittgenstein\u2019s early\nphilosophy. The term is now standardly used to apply to a vaguely\ndefined set of doctrines centered on theses (i)\u2013(vi). In\nRussell\u2019s opinion, what makes it appropriate to speak of\nlogical atomism is that the atoms in question are to be\narrived at by logical rather than physical analysis (Russell 1956,\n179). For Wittgenstein too, the ultimate constituents of reality are\nto be revealed by a process of logical analysis; so, to that extent,\nthe label seems apt. It is not, however, uncontroversial (see Floyd\n1998 and\n 2007).[2]\n\n",
