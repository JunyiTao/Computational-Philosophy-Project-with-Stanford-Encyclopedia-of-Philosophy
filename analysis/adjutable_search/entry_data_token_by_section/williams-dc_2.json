    "main_text": "Metaphysics\u2014Cosmology\n3. Metaphysics\u2014Cosmology\n\nFollowing his own prescription for an affirmative and constructive\nphilosophy, Williams worked steadily towards the development of his\nown distinctive position in metaphysics. He introduced the useful\ndivision of the subject into Speculative Cosmology, which deals with\nthe basic elements making up the world we live in, such as matter,\nmind, and force, together with the relations between them, and\nAnalytic Ontology, which explores the fundamental categories, such as\nSubstance and Property, and how they relate to one another.\nSpeculative Cosmology, in particular, needs to be open to developments\nin the fundamental sciences, and so needs to be seen as always\nprovisional and a posteriori. Analytic Ontology, the\nexploration of the categories of being, is a more purely reflective\nand a priori discipline aiming to elucidate the range of different\nelements in any universe.\n\nTo begin with Speculative Cosmology, Williams\u2019s position has\nthree main features.\n\nIt is Naturalistic. The natural world of space, time, and matter, with\nall its constituents, is a Reality in its own right. Contrary to all\nIdealist metaphysics, this world, except for the finite minds that are\nto found within it, is independent of any knowing mind. Moreover, it\nis the only world. There are no divinities or supernatural powers\nbeyond the realm of Nature (\u201cNaturalism and the Nature of\nThings\u201d 1966, pp 212\u2013238). Even mathematical realities\nbelong in the natural world: numbers\u2014at least natural\nones\u2014as abstractions from clusters, and geometrical objects as\nabstractions from space. The philosophy of mathematics was an aspect\nof his position that was never fully worked through.\n\nSecond, his position is not only Naturalist but also Materialist. This\nMaterialism is not of the rather crude kind that supposes that every\nreality is composed of a solid, crunchy substance, the stuff that\nmakes up the atoms of Greek speculation. Any spatio-temporal reality,\nwhether an \u2018insubstantial\u2019 property, such as a color, or\nsomething as abstract as a relation, such as farther-away-than, or\nfaster-than, so long as it takes its place as a spatio-temporal\nelement at home in the world of physics, is accepted as part of this\none great spatio-temporal world. Williams\u2019s Materialism is thus\none which can accept whatever physical theory posits as the most\nplausible foundation for the natural sciences, provided that it\nspecifies a world which develops according to natural law, without any\nteleological (final) causes.\n\nThe Mental is accommodated in the same way. Although Mind is\nunquestionably real, mental facts are as spatio-temporally located as\nany others (\u201cThe Existence of Consciousness\u201d, \u201cMind\nas a Matter of Fact\u201d 1966, pp 23\u201340, 239\u2013261). The\nMental is not an independent realm parallel to and equal to the\nMaterial, but rather a tiny, rather insignificant fragment of Being,\ndependent upon, even if not reducible to, the physical or biological\nnature of living beings. Williams has a capacious conception of the\nMaterial\u2014his position could perhaps be better described as\nSpatio-Temporal Naturalism.\n\nThirdly, Williams\u2019s metaphysics is 4-dimensional. Or, more\nprecisely, given the development of multi-dimensional string theories\nsince his time, it takes Time to be a dimension in the same way that\nSpace has dimensions. The first step is to insist, against Aristotle\nand his followers, that statements about the future, no less than\nthose concerning the present and the past, are timelessly true or\nfalse. They need not await the event they refer to, in order to gain a\ntruth value (\u201cThe Sea Fight Tomorrow\u201d 1966, pp\n262\u2013288.) This encourages the further view that the facts that\nunderpin truths about the future are (timelessly) Real. All points in\ntime are (timelessly) Real, as are all points on any dimension of our\nfamiliar Space. Whatever account is to be given of Change, it does not\nconsist in items gaining or losing Reality. This stance receives\npowerful support from physical theory. Williams embraced and argued\nfor the conception of Time as a fourth dimension introduced by\nMinkowski\u2019s \u2018Block Universe\u2019 interpretation of\nEinstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity. A consequence of this\nis that the experience of the flow or passage of Time must be some\nsort of illusion. Williams embraced that consequence, and argued for\nit in a celebrated paper (\u2018The Myth of Passage\u2019,\n1951).\n",
