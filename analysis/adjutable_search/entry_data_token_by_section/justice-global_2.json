Such actions might be mediated through institutions,\npolicies, or norms.\nWe cannot solve a problem that affects residents of one or more\nstates without co-operation from other states.\n\n\nSo, in general, a problem is one of global justice when the problem\neither affects agents resident in more than one state or the problem\nis unresolvable without their co-operation. For the problem to be\nconsidered genuinely global rather than regional it should affect more\nthan one regional area.\n",
