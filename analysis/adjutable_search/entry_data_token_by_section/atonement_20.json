    "main_text": "Recent Theories || Another Satisfaction Theory\n5.2 Another Satisfaction Theory\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory of atonement is Anselmian, although it\ndispenses with Anselm\u2019s calculus about how valuable the\nsatisfaction must be in order to atone. According to Swinburne (1989),\natonement has four components: repentance, apology, reparation, and\npenance (see\n section 2.6\n for a description of Swinburne\u2019s notion of penance). For less\nsevere wrongs, repentance and apology may suffice to atone, but for\nmore serious wrongs\u2014especially those that cause harm aside from\nthe offense itself\u2014reparation and penance are required. Since\nhuman sin is immense and immensely harmful, humans must make\nreparation and penance for sin\u2014and not only for their own\npersonal sin, but also for the sins of their forebears, to whom they\nowe a debt of helping to repair their moral debts. However, the victim\nmay determine what counts as adequate satisfaction for wrongdoing.\nChrist\u2019s entire life lived in obedience and service to God,\nwhich caused his death at the hands of his enemies, was offered by\nChrist as a reparation and penance for human sin. Humans can adopt it\nas their own reparation and penance by adding to it their personal\nrepentance and apology.\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory evades many of the objections to\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory presented in\n section 4.3\n (although Hick 1994 argues that some of the classic objections\napply). He has responded to Stump\u2019s objection that his view\nmakes forgiveness contingent by arguing that Stump\u2019s view of\nforgiveness is not well reflected in Christ\u2019s view of\nforgiveness, whereas his is (Swinburne 2019). Cross\u2019s and\nLombardo\u2019s objections have yet to be rebutted.\n\nPorter (2004), among others (Quinn 1994; Stump 2018; Thurow 2021a),\nobjects that Swinburne\u2019s theory does not explain why\nChrist\u2019s death is distinctly important for atonement. His\nperfect life is what appears to do the reparative work; his death\nappears to be simply a causal consequence of that work, but not\nsomething in virtue of which reparation is made. Hick (1994) adds that\nsince Swinburne thinks God could have accepted a supererogatory act\nfrom a mere human or angel as satisfaction, it is hard to see why God\nwould instead use the horrific death of the Son of God as\nsatisfaction. McNaughton (1992) and Aspenson (1996) present other\ncritiques.\n",
