    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Cook Wilson (1849\u20131915) was Wykeham Professor of Logic at\nNew College, Oxford. His ideas are at the origin of \u2018Oxford\nRealism\u2019, a philosophical movement that flourished at Oxford\nduring the first decades of the twentieth century. Although trained as\na classicist and a mathematician, his most important contributions\nwere to the theory of knowledge, where he argued that knowledge is\nfactive in conjunction with the thesis that, as a state of mind, it is\nnot definable in terms of belief\u2014they share no \u2018highest\ncommon factor\u2019\u2014and he thus rejected \u2018hybrid\u2019\nand \u2018externalist\u2019 accounts of knowledge. He also argued\nfor direct realism in perception, criticizing both empiricism and\nidealism, and argued for a view of universals as tropes. His influence\nswayed Oxford away from idealism and, through figures such as H. A.\nPrichard, Gilbert Ryle and J. L. Austin, his ideas were also to some\nextent at the origin of \u2018moral intuitionism\u2019 and\n\u2018ordinary language philosophy\u2019, which defined in turn much\nof Oxford philosophy until the second half of the twentieth century.\nCook Wilson\u2019s name was, however, all but forgotten by the end of\nthe century, but the influence of his ideas is still felt today in the\nwritings of philosophers as diverse as John McDowell, Charles Travis\nand Timothy Williamson.\n",
