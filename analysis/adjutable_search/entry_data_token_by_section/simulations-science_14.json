    "main_text": "Simulation and Experiment\n5. Simulation and Experiment\n\n\nWorking scientists sometimes describe simulation studies in\nexperimental terms. The connection between simulation and\nexperiment probably goes back as far as von Neumann, who, when\nadvocating very early on for the use of computers in physics, noted\nthat many difficult experiments had to be conducted merely to determine\nfacts that ought, in principle, to be derivable from theory. Once\nvon Neumann\u2019s vision became a reality, and some of these\nexperiments began to be replaced by simulations, it became somewhat\nnatural to view them as versions of experiment. A\nrepresentative passage can be found in a popular book on\nsimulation:\n\n\nA simulation that accurately mimics a complex phenomenon contains a\nwealth of information about that phenomenon. Variables such as\ntemperature, pressure, humidity, and wind velocity are evaluated at\nthousands of points by the supercomputer as it simulates the\ndevelopment of a storm, for example. Such data, which far exceed\nanything that could be gained from launching a fleet of weather\nballoons, reveals intimate details of what is going on in the storm\ncloud. (Kaufmann and Smarr 1993, 4)\n\n\nThe idea of \u201cin silico\u201d experiments becomes even more\nplausible when a simulation study is designed to learn what happens to\na system as a result of various possible interventions: What would\nhappen to the global climate if x amount of carbon were added\nto the atmosphere? What will happen to this airplane wing if it is\nsubjected to such-and-such strain? How would traffic patterns change\nif an onramp is added at this location?\n\n\nPhilosophers, consequently, have begun to consider in what sense, if\nany, computer simulations are like experiments and in what sense they\ndiffer.  A related issue is the question of when a process that\nfundamentally involves computer simulation can counts as measurement\n(Parker, 2017) A number of views have emerged in the literature\ncentered around defending and criticizing two theses:\n\nThe identity thesis. Computer simulation studies are\nliterally instances of experiments.\nThe epistemological dependence thesis. The identity\nthesis would (if it were true) be a good reason (weak version), or the\nbest reason (stronger version), or the only reason (strongest version;\nit is a necessary condition) to believe that simulations can provide\nwarrants for belief in the hypotheses that they support. A\nconsequence of the strongest version is that only if the identity\nthesis is true is there reason to believe that simulations can confer\nwarrant for believing in hypotheses.\n\n\n\nThe central idea behind the epistemological dependence thesis is\nthat experiments are the canonical entities that play a central role in\nwarranting our belief in scientific hypotheses, and that therefore the\ndegree to which we ought to think that simulations can also play a role\nin warranting such beliefs depends on the extent to which they can be\nidentified as a kind of experiment.\n\n\nOne can find philosophers arguing for the identity thesis as early as\nHumphreys 1995 and Hughes 1999. And there is at least implicit support\nfor (the stronger) version of the epistemological dependence thesis in\nHughes. The earliest explicit argument in favor of the epistemological\ndependence thesis, however, is in Norton and Suppe 2001. According to\nNorton and Suppe, simulations can warrant belief precisely because\nthey literally are experiments. They have a detailed story to tell\nabout in what sense they are experiments, and how this is all supposed\nto work.  According to Norton and Suppe, a valid simulation is one in\nwhich certain formal relations (what they call\n\u2018realization\u2019) hold between a base model, the modeled\nphysical system itself, and the computer running the algorithm. When\nthe proper conditions are met, \u2018a simulation can be used as an\ninstrument for probing or detecting real world phenomena. Empirical\ndata about real phenomena are produced under conditions of\nexperimental control\u2019 (p. 73).\n\n\nOne problem with this story is that the formal conditions that they\nset out are much too strict. It is unlikely that there are very many\nreal examples of computer simulations that meet their strict standards.\nSimulation is almost always a far more idealizing and approximating\nenterprise. So, if simulations are experiments, it is probably\nnot in the way that Norton and Suppe imagined.\n\n\nMore generally, the identity thesis has drawn fire from other\nquarters.\n\n\nGilbert and Troitzsch argued that \u201c[t]he major difference is\nthat while in an experiment, one is controlling the actual object of\ninterest (for example, in a chemistry experiment, the chemicals under\ninvestigation), in a simulation one is experimenting with a model\nrather than the phenomenon itself.\u201d (Gilbert and Troitzsch 1999,\n13). But this doesn\u2019t seem right. Many (Guala 2002, 2008, Morgan 2003,\nParker 2009a, Winsberg 2009a) have pointed to problems with the\nclaim. If Gilbert and Troitzsch mean that simulationists manipulate\nmodels in the sense of abstract objects, then the claim is difficult\nto understand\u2014how do we manipulate an abstract entity? If, on\nthe other hand, they simply mean to point to the fact that the\nphysical object that simulationists manipulate\u2014a digital\ncomputer\u2014is not the actual object of interest, then it is not\nclear why this differs from ordinary experiments. \n\n\nIt is false that real experiments always manipulate exactly their\ntargets of interest. In fact, in both real experiments and\nsimulations, there is a complex relationship between what is\nmanipulated in the investigation on the one hand, and the real-world\nsystems that are the targets of the investigation on the other. In\ncases of both experiment and simulation, therefore, it takes an\nargument of some substance to establish the \u2018external\nvalidity\u2019 of the investigation \u2013 to establish that what is\nlearned about the system being manipulated is applicable to the system\nof interest. Mendel, for example, manipulated pea plants, but he was\ninterested in learning about the phenomenon of heritability\ngenerally. The idea of a model organism in biology makes this\nidea perspicuous. We experiment on Caenorhabditis elegans\nbecause we are interested in understanding how organism in general use\ngenes to control development and genealogy. We experiment\non Drosophila melanogaster, because it provides a\nuseful model of mutations and genetic inheritance. But the idea is not\nlimited to biology.  Galileo experimented with inclined planes because\nhe was interested in how objects fall and how they would behave in the\nabsence of interfering forces\u2014phenomena that the inclined plane\nexperiments did not even actually instantiate.\n\n\nOf course, this view about experiments is not uncontested. It is\ntrue that, quite often, experimentalists infer something about a system\ndistinct from the system they interfere with. However, it is not clear\nwhether this inference is proper part of the original experiment.\nPeschard (2010) mounts a criticism along these lines, and hence can be\nseen as a defender of Gilbert and Troitzsch. Peschard argues that the\nfundamental assumption of their critics\u2014that in experimentation,\njust as in simulation, what is manipulated is a system standing in for\na target system\u2014is confused. It confuses, Peschard argues, the\nepistemic target of an experiment with its epistemic\nmotivation. She argues that while the epistemic motivation for\ndoing experiments on C. elegans might be quite far-reaching,\nthe proper epistemic target for any such experiment is the worm\nitself.  In a simulation, according to Peschard, however, the\nepistemic target is never the digital computer itself. Thus,\nsimulation is distinct from experiment, according to her, in that its\nepistemic target (as opposed to merely its epistemic motivation) is\ndistinct from the object being manipulated. Roush (2017) can also be\nseen as a defender of the Gilbert and Troitzsch line, but Roush\nappeals to sameness of natural kinds as the crucial feature that\nseparates experiments and simulations. Other opponents of the identity\nthesis include Giere (2009) and Beisbart and Norton (2012, Other\nInternet Resources).\n\n\nIt is not clear how to adjudicate this dispute, and it seems to\nrevolve primarily around a difference of emphasis. One can\nemphasize the difference between experiment and simulation,\nfollowing Gilbert and Troitzsch and Peschard, by insisting that\nexperiments teach us first about their epistemic targets and only\nsecondarily allow inferences to the behavior of other systems. \n(I.e., experiments on worms teach us, in the first instance, about\nworms, and only secondarily allow us to make inferences about genetic\ncontrol more generally.) This would make them conceptually\ndifferent from computer simulations, which are not thought to teach us,\nin the first instance, about the behavior of computers, and only in the\nsecond instance about storms, or galaxies, or whatever.\n\n\nOr one can emphasize similarity in the opposite way. One can\nemphasize the degree to which experimental targets are always chosen\nas surrogates for what\u2019s really of interest.  Morrison, 2009 is\nprobably the most forceful defender of emphasizing this aspect of the\nsimilarity of experiment and simulation.  She argues that most\nexperimental practice, and indeed most measurement practice, involve\nthe same kinds of modeling practices as simulations.  In any case,\npace Peschard, nothing but a debate about nomenclature\u2014and maybe\nan appeal to the ordinary language use of scientists; not always the\nmost compelling kind of argument\u2014would prevent us from saying\nthat the epistemic target of a storm simulation is the computer, and\nthat the storm is merely the epistemic motivation for studying the\ncomputer.\n\n\nBe that as it may, many philosophers of simulation, including those\ndiscussed in this section, have chosen the latter path\u2014partly as\na way of drawing attention to ways in which the message lurking behind\nGilbert and Troitzsch\u2019s quoted claim paints an overly simplistic\npicture of experiment. It does seem overly simplistic to paint a\npicture according to which experiment gets a direct grip on\nthe world, whereas simulation\u2019s situation is exactly\nopposite. And this is the picture one seems to get from the\nGilber and Troitzsch quotation. Peschard\u2019s more sophisticated picture\ninvolving a distinction between epistemic targets and epistemic\nmotivations goes a long way towards smoothing over those concerns\nwithout pushing us into the territory of thinking that simulation and\nexperiment are exactly the same, in this regard.\n\n\nStill, despite rejecting Gilbert and Troitzsch\u2019s\ncharacterization of the difference between simulation and experiment,\nGuala and Morgan both reject the identity thesis. Drawing on the\nwork of Simon (1969), Guala argues that simulations differ\nfundamentally from experiments in that the object of manipulation in an\nexperiment bears a material similarity to the target of interest, but\nin a simulation, the similarity between object and target is merely\nformal. Interestingly, while Morgan accepts this argument against the\nidentity thesis, she seems to hold to a version of the\nepistemological dependency thesis. She argues, in other words,\nthat the difference between experiments and simulations identified by\nGuala implies that simulations are epistemologically inferior to real\nexperiments \u2013 that they have intrinsically less power to warrant\nbelief in hypotheses about the real world because they are not\nexperiments.\n\n\nA defense of the epistemic power of simulations against Morgan\u2019s\n(2002) argument could come in the form of a defense of the identity\nthesis, or in the form of a rejection of the epistemological\ndependency thesis. On the former front, there seem to be two problems\nwith Guala\u2019s (2002) argument against the identity thesis. The\nfirst is that the notion of material similarity here is too weak, and\nthe second is that the notion of mere formal similarity is too vague,\nto do the required work. Consider, for example, the fact that it is\nnot uncommon, in the engineering sciences, to use simulation methods\nto study the behavior of systems fabricated out of silicon. The\nengineer wants to learn about the properties of different design\npossibilities for a silicon device, so she develops a computational\nmodel of the device and runs a simulation of its behavior on a digital\ncomputer. There are deep material similarities between, and some of\nthe same material causes are at work in, the central processor of the\ncomputer and the silicon device being studied. On Guala\u2019s line\nof reasoning, this should mark this as an example of a real\nexperiment, but that seems wrong. The peculiarities of this example\nillustrate the problem rather starkly, but the problem is in fact\nquite general: any two systems bear some material similarities to each\nother and some differences.\n\n\nOn the flip side, the idea that the existence of a formal similarity\nbetween two material entities could mark anything interesting is\nconceptually confused. Given any two sufficiently complex entities,\nthere are many ways in which they are formally identical, not to\nmention similar. There are also ways in which they are formally\ncompletely different. Now, we can speak loosely, and say that two\nthings bear a formal similarity, but what we really mean is that our\nbest formal representations of the two entities have formal\nsimilarities. In any case, there appear to be good grounds for rejecting both\nthe Gilbert and Troitzsch and the Morgan and Guala grounds for\ndistinguishing experiments and simulations. \n\n\nReturning to the defense of the epistemic power of simulations, there\nare also grounds for rejecting the epistemological dependence thesis.\nAs Parker (2009a) points out, in both experiment and simulation, we\ncan have relevant similarities between computer simulations and target\nsystems, and that\u2019s what matters. When the relevant background\nknowledge is in place, a simulation can provide more reliable\nknowledge of a system than an experiment. A computer simulation of the\nsolar system, based on our most sophisticated models of celestial\ndynamics, will produce better representations of the planets\u2019\norbits than any experiment.  \n\nParke (2014) argues against the epistemological dependency thesis by\nundermining two premises that she believes support it: first, that\nexperiments generate greater inferential power than simulations, and\nsecond, that simulations cannot surprise us in the same way that\nexperiments can.  The argument that simulations cannot surprise us\ncomes from Morgan (2005).  Pace Morgan, Parke argues that\nsimulationists are often surprised by their simulations, both because\nthey are not computationally omniscient, and because they are not\nalways the sole creators of the models and code they use.  She argues,\nmoreover, that \u2018[d]ifferences in researcher\u2019s epistemic states, alone,\nseem like the wrong grounds for tracking a distinction between\nexperiment and simulation\u2019 (258).  Adrian Curry (2017) defends\nMorgan\u2019s original intuition by making two friendly amendments.  He\nargues that the distinction Morgan was really after was between two\ndifferent kinds of surprise, and in particular to what the source of\nsurprise is: surprise due to bringing out theoretical knowledge into\ncontact with the world are distinctive of experiment.  He also more\ncarefully defines surprise in a non-psychological way such that it is\na \u201cquality the attainment of which constitutes genuine epistemic\nprogress\u201d (p. 640).\n",
