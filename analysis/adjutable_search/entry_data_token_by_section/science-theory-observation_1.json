    "main_text": "Observation and data || Traditional empiricism\n2.1 Traditional empiricism\n\nReasoning from observations has been important to scientific practice\nat least since the time of Aristotle, who mentions a number of sources\nof observational evidence including animal dissection (Aristotle(a),\n763a/30\u2013b/15; Aristotle(b), 511b/20\u201325).\nFrancis Bacon argued long ago that the best way to discover things\nabout nature is to use experiences (his term for observations as well\nas experimental results) to develop and improve scientific theories\n(Bacon 1620, 49ff). The role of observational evidence in scientific\ndiscovery was an important topic for Whewell (1858) and Mill (1872)\namong others in the 19th century. But philosophers didn\u2019t talk\nabout observation as extensively, in as much detail, or in the way we\nhave become accustomed to, until the 20th century when\nlogical empiricists transformed philosophical thinking about it.\n\nOne important transformation, characteristic of the linguistic turn in\nphilosophy, was to concentrate on the logic of observation reports\nrather than on objects or phenomena observed. This focus made sense on\nthe assumption that a scientific theory is a system of sentences or\nsentence-like structures (propositions, statements, claims, and so on)\nto be tested by comparison to observational evidence. It was assumed\nthat the comparisons must be understood in terms of inferential\nrelations. If inferential relations hold only between sentence-like\nstructures, it follows that theories must be tested, not against\nobservations or things observed, but against sentences, propositions,\netc. used to report observations (Hempel 1935,\n50\u201351; Schlick 1935). Theory testing was treated as\na matter of comparing observation sentences describing observations\nmade in natural or laboratory settings to observation sentences that\nshould be true according to the theory to be tested. This was to be\naccomplished by using laws or lawlike generalizations along with\ndescriptions of initial conditions, correspondence rules, and\nauxiliary hypotheses to derive observation sentences describing the\nsensory deliverances of interest. This makes it imperative to ask what\nobservation sentences report.\n\nAccording to what Hempel called the phenomenalist account,\nobservation reports describe the observer\u2019s subjective\nperceptual experiences.\n\n\u2026 Such experiential data might be conceived of as being\nsensations, perceptions, and similar phenomena of immediate\nexperience. (Hempel 1952, 674)\n\n\nThis view is motivated by the assumption that the epistemic value of\nan observation report depends upon its truth or accuracy, and that\nwith regard to perception, the only thing observers can know with\ncertainty to be true or accurate is how things appear to them. This\nmeans that we cannot be confident that observation reports are true or\naccurate if they describe anything beyond the observer\u2019s own\nperceptual experience. Presumably one\u2019s confidence in a\nconclusion should not exceed one\u2019s confidence in one\u2019s\nbest reasons to believe it. For the phenomenalist, it follows that\nreports of subjective experience can provide better reasons to believe\nclaims they support than reports of other kinds of evidence.\n\nHowever, given the expressive limitations of the language available\nfor reporting subjective experiences, we cannot expect phenomenalistic\nreports to be precise and unambiguous enough to test theoretical\nclaims whose evaluation requires accurate, fine-grained perceptual\ndiscriminations. Worse yet, if experiences are directly available only\nto those who have them, there is room to doubt whether different\npeople can understand the same observation sentence in the same way.\nSuppose you had to evaluate a claim on the basis of someone\nelse\u2019s subjective report of how a litmus solution looked to her\nwhen she dripped a liquid of unknown acidity into it. How could you\ndecide whether her visual experience was the same as the one you would\nuse her words to report?\n\nSuch considerations led Hempel to propose, contrary to the\nphenomenalists, that observation sentences report \u2018directly\nobservable\u2019, \u2018intersubjectively ascertainable\u2019 facts\nabout physical objects\n\n\u2026 such as the coincidence of the pointer of an instrument with a\nnumbered mark on a dial; a change of color in a test substance or in\nthe skin of a patient; the clicking of an amplifier connected with a\nGeiger counter; etc. (ibid.)\n\n\nThat the facts expressed in observation reports be intersubjectively\nascertainable was critical for the aims of the logical empiricists.\nThey hoped to articulate and explain the authoritativeness widely\nconceded to the best natural, social, and behavioral scientific\ntheories in contrast to propaganda and pseudoscience. Some\npronouncements from astrologers and medical quacks gain wide\nacceptance, as do those of religious leaders who rest their cases on\nfaith or personal revelation, and leaders who use their political\npower to secure assent. But such claims do not enjoy the kind of\ncredibility that scientific theories can attain. The logical\nempiricists tried to account for the genuine credibility of scientific\ntheories by appeal to the objectivity and accessibility of observation\nreports, and the logic of theory testing. Part of what they meant by\ncalling observational evidence objective was that cultural and ethnic\nfactors have no bearing on what can validly be inferred about the\nmerits of a theory from observation reports. So conceived, objectivity\nwas important to the logical empiricists\u2019 criticism of the Nazi\nidea that Jews and Aryans have fundamentally different thought\nprocesses such that physical theories suitable for Einstein and his\nkind should not be inflicted on German students. In response to this\nrationale for ethnic and cultural purging of the German educational\nsystem, the logical empiricists argued that because of its\nobjectivity, observational evidence (rather than ethnic and cultural\nfactors) should be used to evaluate scientific theories (Galison\n1990). In this way of thinking, observational evidence and its\nsubsequent bearing on scientific theories are objective also in virtue\nof being free of non-epistemic values.\n\nEnsuing generations of philosophers of science have found the logical\nempiricist focus on expressing the content of observations in a\nrarefied and basic observation language too narrow. Search for a\nsuitably universal language as required by the logical empiricist\nprogram has come up empty-handed and most philosophers of science have\ngiven up its pursuit. Moreover, as we will discuss in the following\nsection, the centrality of observation itself (and pointer readings)\nto the aims of empiricism in philosophy of science has also come under\nscrutiny. However, leaving the search for a universal pure observation\nlanguage behind does not automatically undercut the norm of\nobjectivity as it relates to the social, political, and cultural\ncontexts of scientific research. Pristine logical foundations aside,\nthe objectivity of \u2018neutral\u2019 observations in the face of\nnoxious political propaganda was appealing because it could serve as\nshared ground available for intersubjective appraisal. This appeal\nremains alive and well today, particularly as pernicious\nmisinformation campaigns are again formidable in public discourse (see\nO\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019). If individuals can genuinely\nappraise the significance of empirical evidence and come to\nwell-justified agreement about how the evidence bears on theorizing,\nthen they can protect their epistemic deliberations from the undue\ninfluence of fascists and other nefarious manipulators. However, this\naspiration must face subtleties arising from the social epistemology\nof science and from the nature of empirical results themselves. In\npractice, the appraisal of scientific results can often require\nexpertise that is not readily accessible to members of the public\nwithout the relevant specialized training. Additionally, precisely\nbecause empirical results are not pure observation reports, their\nappraisal across communities of inquirers operating with different\nbackground assumptions can require significant epistemic work.\n\nThe logical empiricists paid little attention to the distinction\nbetween observing and experimenting and its epistemic implications.\nFor some philosophers, to experiment is to isolate, prepare, and\nmanipulate things in hopes of producing epistemically useful evidence.\nIt had been customary to think of observing as noticing and attending\nto interesting details of things perceived under more or less natural\nconditions, or by extension, things perceived during the course of an\nexperiment. To look at a berry on a vine and attend to its color and\nshape would be to observe it. To extract its juice and apply reagents\nto test for the presence of copper compounds would be to perform an\nexperiment. By now, many philosophers have argued that contrivance and\nmanipulation influence epistemically significant features of\nobservable experimental results to such an extent that epistemologists\nignore them at their peril. Robert Boyle (1661), John Herschell\n(1830), Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979), Ian Hacking (1983),\nHarry Collins (1985) Allan Franklin (1986), Peter Galison (1987), Jim\nBogen and Jim Woodward (1988), and Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger (1997),\nare some of the philosophers and philosophically-minded scientists,\nhistorians, and sociologists of science who gave serious consideration\nto the distinction between observing and experimenting. The logical\nempiricists tended to ignore it. Interestingly, the contemporary\nvantage point that attends to modeling, data processing, and empirical\nresults may suggest a re-unification of observation and intervention\nunder the same epistemological framework. When one no longer thinks of\nscientific observation as pure or direct, and recognizes the power of\ngood modeling to account for confounds without physically intervening\non the target system, the purported epistemic distinction between\nobservation and intervention loses its bite.\n",
