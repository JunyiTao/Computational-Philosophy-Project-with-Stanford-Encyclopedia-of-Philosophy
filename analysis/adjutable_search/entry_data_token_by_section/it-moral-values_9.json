    "main_text": "Information Technologies of Morality || Information Technology as a Model for Moral Discovery\n4.1 Information Technology as a Model for Moral Discovery\n\nPatrick Grim has been a longtime proponent of the idea that philosophy\nshould utilize information technologies to automate and illustrate\nphilosophical thought experiments (Grim et al. 1998; Grim 2004). Peter\nDanielson (1998) has also written extensively on this subject\nbeginning with his book Modeling Rationality, Morality, and\nEvolution with much of the early research in the computational\ntheory of morality centered on using computer models to elucidate the\nemergence of cooperation between simple software AI or ALife agents\n(Sullins 2005). \n\nLuciano Floridi and J. W. Sanders argue that information as it is used\nin the theory of computation can serve as a powerful idea that can\nhelp resolve some of the famous moral conundrums in philosophy such as\nthe nature of evil (1999, 2001). The propose that along with moral\nevil and natural evil, both concepts familiar to philosophy (see entry\non\n the problem of evil);\n we add a third concept they call artificial evil (2001). Floridi and\nSanders contend that if we do this then we can see that the actions of\nartificial agents\n\n\n\u2026to be morally good or evil can be determined even in the\nabsence of biologically sentient participants and thus allows\nartificial agents not only to perpetrate evil (and for that matter\ngood) but conversely to \u2018receive\u2019 or \u2018suffer\nfrom\u2019 it. (Floridi and Sanders 2001)\n\n\nEvil can then be equated with something like information dissolution,\nwhere the irretrievable loss of information is bad and the\npreservation of information is good (Floridi and Sanders 2001). This\nidea can move us closer to a way of measuring the moral impacts of any\ngiven action in an information environment.\n",
