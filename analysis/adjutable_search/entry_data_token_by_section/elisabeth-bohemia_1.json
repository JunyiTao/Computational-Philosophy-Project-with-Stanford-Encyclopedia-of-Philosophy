    "main_text": "Early Interest in the Passions\n2. Early Interest in the Passions\n\nElisabeth seems to have taken an early interest in the passions, as\nEdward Reynolds dedicated his Treatise on the passions and the\nfaculties of the soule of man (1640) to her. While there is\nlittle information about its context, the dedication suggests that\nElisabeth had seen a draft of the work, and so one can infer that they\nhad some discussion or correspondence. Reynolds\u2019s work, while one of\nthe first self-standing treatments of the passions of the period,\ndraws largely on Aristotelian-Scholastic discussions. It does,\nhowever, focus on the sensitivity of the passions to reason, and so\nour capacity to correct our errant passions through reflection.\n",
