    "main_text": "Elucidating Methodological Naturalism || Degree of sanction\n3.4 Degree of sanction\n\n\nScientific standards sanction propositions to a certain degree\nrather than outright. The latest hypothesis at the research coalface\nadopted tentatively by a few experts does not have the same standing as\na long-entrenched theory. Thus the black-or-white notion of scientific\nstandards sanctioning or not sanctioning p will not do. (This is an idea which Bayesian confirmation theory takes seriously.) It might also be argued that\nthis is also true for mathematical standards, for example by considering non-deductive grounds for belief in mathematical\npropositions. It seems reasonable to see Goldbach's\nConjecture, the claim that every even number greater than 4 is the sum\nof two primes, as supported to a high degree by the non-deductive\nevidence currently available for it. In the absence of a\nproof of Goldbach's Conjecture, however, this degree falls short\nof 1. A more precise statement of the naturalist's creed must\ntherefore issue guidelines for apportioning\ncredence in p in line with the degree and type of commitment\nto p scientific or mathematical standards recommend.\n",
