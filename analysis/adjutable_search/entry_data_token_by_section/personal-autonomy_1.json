Four More or Less Overlapping Accounts of Personal Autonomy\n\n\nPhilosophers have proposed many different accounts of the autonomous\nagent\u2019s special relation to her own motives. According to one\nprominent conception, which one might call\n\u201ccoherentist,\u201d an agent governs her own action if\nand only if she is motivated to act as she does because this\nmotivation coheres with (is in harmony with) some mental state that\nrepresents her point of view on the action.  The relevant mental state\nvaries from account to account. According to one popular story, an\nagent\u2019s point of view is constituted by her highest-order desires\nregarding which of her first-order desires moves her to\nact. (Frankfurt\n 1988c)[1] \nAccording to another story, her point of\nview is constituted by her (contemporaneous or long-term) evaluative\njudgments regarding which actions are (most) worth performing. (Watson\n 1975)[2] Still\nanother account adds that there must also be harmony between what the\nagent does and her more or less long-term plans (Bratman 1979 and\n2007).  And others appeal to the relatively stable network of\nemotional states constitutive of \u201ccaring\u201d (Frankfurt 1988f\nand 1999d, Jaworska, Shoemaker\n 2003)[3]\n or to the agent\u2019s character traits\n(Dworkin, R.), or to her most thoroughly \u201cintegrated\u201d\npsychological states (Arpaly and Schroeder).\n\n\n\nAll these accounts reflect the intuition that an action cannot be\nattributed to the agent herself if, even as she performs this action,\nshe occupies a point of view from which she repudiates what she is\ndoing. More carefully, such an action cannot be the agent\u2019s doing in\nthe way that it must be if it is to qualify as an instance of\nself-government. According to this intuition, if someone repudiates,\nor in some other way dissociates herself from, the causal efficacy of\nher own motives, then the power of these motives is independent of her\nauthority. If, on the other hand, she endorses these motives, whether\nimplicitly or explicitly, then her actions occur with her permission,\nif not necessarily at her command. Under what conditions does someone\ncount as endorsing or repudiating her motives?  Each account offers a\ndifferent answer to this question.\n\n\nNot only does there appear to be a tight conceptual connection between\nself-governing agency and synchronic psychic unity; there\nalso appears to be a connection between self-governing agency and\nthe diachronic unity of one\u2019s later self with one\u2019s earlier\nself. This is the connection central to accounts that identify\nself-governing agents with agents constrained by plans, or by\nwell-integrated emotions, or traits of character. Agents persist\nthrough time; and so, these accounts stress, an agent\u2019s point of view\nis not simply a function of whatever mental state(s) she happens to be\nin at some point in time. Because an agent\u2019s plans play a crucial role\nin ensuring that she is more than a mere collection or sequence of\nmental states, it is reasonable to think that whether her motives have\nher support depends on whether they are constrained by these plans.\nSo, too, it is reasonable to think that her stance toward her motives\nis determined by her long-term values and/or her relatively stable\ncommitments and cares.\n\n\n\nOn a strict coherentist conception of autonomy, autonomous agents can\nbe moved by desires they are helpless to resist: though an addict fails\nto govern herself if she would rather resist her irresistible urge to\ntake drugs, she is an autonomous agent if she has no objection to her\naddiction and its motivational effects. According to the coherentist,\nmoreover, both the origin and the content of a person\u2019s higher-order\nattitudes (evaluative judgments, plans) are irrelevant to whether she\nis an autonomous agent. She need have done nothing to bring it about\nthat she has these attitudes; and the attitudes need not be especially\nrational or well-informed. Coherentist accounts are thus doubly\ninternalist. They express the intuition that whether we govern\nourselves depends on neither how we came to be who we are (a fact that\nis prior to (and in this sense external to) the action itself) nor how\nour beliefs and attitudes relate to reality (a fact that is independent\nof (and in this sense external to) the beliefs and attitudes\nthemselves). In other words, on these accounts, there need be no special\nrelation between our autonomy-constituting attitudes and either the\npast circumstances that caused these attitudes or the present\ncircumstances in response to which they move us to act.\n\n\nOther accounts of autonomy introduce conditions that are\nexternalist in one or both of these ways. According to those\nwho advocate a reasons-responsive conception of autonomous agency, an\nagent does not really govern herself unless her motives, or the mental\nprocesses that produce them, are responsive to a sufficiently wide\nrange of reasons for and against behaving as she\n does. (Fischer and Ravizza, Nelkin, \n Wolf)[4]\n On accounts\nof this type, an agent who is unresponsive to the reasons for\n\u201cstanding behind,\u201d or \u201cbacking up,\u201d certain\nmotives and not others is not in the proper position to authorize her\nown actions. Whether the relevant reasons are grounded in facts about\nher own desires and interests, or whether they have some independent\nsource, the idea is that someone is not qualified to govern herself if\nshe cannot understand what she (really) has reason to do, or (if this\nis a distinct handicap) is incapable of being moved by these reasons.\nIn effect, her exercise of authority is so ill-conceived that it is\npowerless to confer legitimacy on her motives.\n\n\nThe feature of these accounts that most distinguishes them from\ncoherentist accounts is the importance they attribute to an agent\u2019s\nability to appreciate the reasons she has. (Once she appreciates these\nreasons, her inability to act accordingly is, essentially, the\ninability to conform her act to her own judgment, and to her\ncorresponding (higher-order) desire.) What, exactly, is the connection\nsupposed to be between being out of touch with (evaluative and/or\nnonevaluative) reality and failing to govern oneself? Clearly, a person\nwho fails to appreciate a wide range of reasons for action is unlikely\nto govern herself well: she is likely to do things that will,\nin the long run, thwart her own purposes and interests. The\nreasons-responsiveness conception of autonomy thus appears to\nreflect the intuition that when we do something very poorly, we do not\nreally do it at all. There is, however, another possible underlying\nrationale for regarding ignorance as a threat to self-government. If\ndoing Y is constitutive of doing Z, then if I\nauthorize myself to be moved by the desire to do Y because I\nmistakenly believe that doing Y is a way of not doing\nZ, then there is an obvious sense in which I have not\nauthorized myself to do what I am now doing when I am moved by the\ndesire to do Y. So, if I have a general desire to do what is\nright and prudent, or, even more generally, a desire to do what I can\njustify to myself (and others), or, more generally still, a desire to\nbe responsive to reasons, then insofar as I am moved to act in ways\nthat are, in fact, incompatible with satisfying these desires, there\nis a sense in which I\u2014who am committed to doing only what I\nhave good (enough) reason to do\u2014have not really authorized my\naction. Alternatively, we could say that, under these circumstances,\nsomething external to my power to guide myself by reasons has\nprevented me from exercising this power, and so has prevented me from\ngoverning\n myself.[5]\n\n\nAn additional source of support for the reasons-responsive\nconception of autonomy comes from the thought that someone who cannot\nrespond to the reasons there are must have a limited ability to reason.\nThis brings us to a third popular approach to autonomous \nagency\u2014an approach that stresses the importance of the reasoning process\n itself (Christman 1991, 1993 and Mele 1993,\n 1995).[6]\n According to\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, the essence of\nself-government is the capacity to evaluate one\u2019s motives on the basis\nof whatever else one believes and desires, and to adjust these motives\nin response to one\u2019s evaluations. It is the capacity to discern what\n\u201cfollows from\u201d one\u2019s beliefs and desires, and to act\naccordingly. One can exercise this capacity despite holding false\nbeliefs of all kinds about what one has reason to do. Accordingly, on\nthese accounts, being autonomous is not the same thing as being guided\nby correct evaluative and normative judgments.\n\n\nThe emphasis on an autonomous agent\u2019s responsiveness to her own\nreasoning reflects the intuition that someone whose education consisted\nof a method of indoctrination that deprived her of the ability to call\nher own attitudes into question would, in effect, be governed by her\n\u201cprogrammers,\u201d not by herself. So, too, someone whose\npractical reasoning was directly manipulated by others would not govern\nherself by means of this reasoning. And so, it seems, she would have no\npower over the motives that this reasoning produced.\n\n\nLike the coherentists, advocates of responsiveness-to-reasoning\naccounts believe that the key to autonomous agency is the ability to\ndistance oneself from one\u2019s attitudes and beliefs\u2014to occupy a\nstandpoint that is not constituted by whatever mental states are moving\none to act. They agree that motives authorized from this reflective\nstandpoint are internal to the agent herself in a way that her other\nmotives are not. Unlike the coherentists, however, the\nreasoning-responsive theorists believe that there is more to the\ncapacity for self-reflection than the capacity to hold higher-order\nattitudes. The authority of our higher-order attitudes is grounded,\nthey claim, in the authority of the practical reasoning that supports\nthese attitudes. So a self-governing agent does not merely endorse her\nmotives: her endorsements are implicit claims about which motives have\nthe support of her reason.\n\n\nThis fact is closely tied to another. Like many accounts that stress\nan autonomous agent\u2019s responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness-\nto-reasoning accounts often suggest that self-government requires the\ncapacity for self-transformation. On this assumption, an autonomous\nagent is someone who can change her mind when she discovers good reason\nto do\n so.[7]\n In contrast, strict coherentists insist that\nit is possible to act autonomously while being moved by desires that\nare not only irresistible when they produce their effects, but so\nintegral to one\u2019s identity that one could not possibly will to resist\nthem.[8]\n\n\n\nThe conception of autonomous agency as responsiveness to reasoning\nclearly has a more internalist character than the conception of\nautonomous agency as responsiveness to reasons: according to those who\nstress the autonomous agent\u2019s ability to evaluate her own motives, what\ncounts is not the relation between the agent\u2019s attitudes and external\nreality, but her ability to draw inferences from what she wants and\nbelieves, and by so doing, to reconsider\u2014to rationally reflect\nupon\u2014her other desires and beliefs. Insofar, however, as a\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning account presupposes a particular conception\nof practical reasoning, it appeals to standards, or principles, that\nthe agent herself might misapply, or fail to recognize altogether.\nMoreover, even if advocates of autonomy as responsiveness-to-reasoning\nhave nothing in particular in mind when they speak of the process of\n\u201creflection,\u201d \u201crational evaluation,\u201d etc.,\nreasoning is a norm-governed process that an agent might reject for\nreasons of her own. Responsiveness to reasoning accounts thus contain\nan externalist element that is absent from strict coherentist accounts.\nThey imply that an agent can be mistaken about whether she is really\nreasoning\u2014and so can be mistaken about whether the power of her\nmotives reflects the fact that she has the authority to determine her\nown actions.\n\n\nThis weak externalism naturally expands into more robust varieties.\nIn particular, it supports the idea that whether an agent\u2019s reasoning\nis really her way of governing her actions depends on which\nforces exert a nonrational influence on this reasoning. Even when\nindoctrination and other more or less imaginary forms of \u201cmind\ncontrol\u201d do not prevent a person from reaching evaluative\nconclusions about her own motives, they can prevent her from thinking\nfor herself. So, too, it seems, someone in the grip of compulsion or\naddiction can be so dominated by this condition that whatever facts she\nconsiders, and whatever conclusions she draws, cannot legitimately be\nattributed to her. One way to interpret these cases is to say that the\nperson\u2019s reasoning falls so far short of the norms of \u201crational\nreflection\u201d that she is not really reasoning at all.\nAlternatively, one can say that her reasoning does not guarantee her\nautonomy because it is under the control of external forces.\n\n\nInsofar as accounts of autonomy simply stipulate that certain\ninfluences on an agent\u2019s intention-forming process \u201cinterfere\nwith,\u201d or \u201cpervert,\u201d this process, these accounts\nare incomplete. For they leave it mysterious why certain influences,\nand not others, are a threat to self-government. One response to this\nchallenge is offered by reasons-responsive accounts: according to this\nresponse, the autonomy-undermining influences are the ones that\nprevent the reasoning process from being sufficiently sensitive to the\nreasons there\n are.[9]\nAnother \u2013 compatible \u2013 response appeals to the\n\u201crelational\u201d aspects of autonomy: other agents can prevent\nsomeone\u2019s reasoning from qualifying as a mode of self-government by\npreventing the reasoner from developing the self-respect and/or\nself-trust necessary for forming a point of view that is truly her\nown (Benson 1994, 2000, Mackenzie and Stoljar, Anderson and \n Honneth)[10].\n If an agent\u2019s point of view does not reflect her respect for\nherself and for her ability to set her own ends and assess the reasons\nrelevant to pursuing some ends and not others, then the direction her\nreasoning takes cannot be attributed to her.  (Though relational\naccounts of autonomy highlight the extent to which an agent\u2019s capacity\nto govern herself depends on her interactions with other agents, it is\nimportant to note that self-respect and self-trust can also be\nundermined by experiences or psychological conditions that do not\ninvolve the actions of anyone else.)\n\nA fourth conception of personal autonomy offers a very different\nresponse to the challenge of distinguishing (i) the determining causes\nthat prevent an agent from governing herself when she employs her\nreason from (ii) the causes that determine how an agent governs\nherself when she reasons.  According to this incompatibilist\nconception, each of these influences undermines the agent\u2019s autonomy;\ncases of mind control simply call our attention to the fact that\nwhenever our motives are causally determined by events over which we\nhave no control, their power does not reflect our\nauthority. (Pereboom) According to incompatibilists, if our actions\ncan be fully explained as the effects of causal powers that are\nindependent of us, then even if our beliefs and attitudes are among\nthese effects, we do not govern them, and so we do not govern\nourselves. (Kane 1996 and van Inwagen\n1983)[11]\n\n\nIncompatibilist accounts of autonomy take many subtly different\nforms. So do the three other (compatibilist) accounts mentioned here.\nSome of the differences reflect disagreements over the extent to which\nthe relevant conditions\u2014coherence among higher- and\nlower-order attitudes, responsiveness to reasons, responsiveness to\nreasoning, freedom from determination by external causes\u2014must\nactually obtain when an agent determines her will, or whether it is\nenough that under certain specified circumstances the\nagent would relate to her motives in the stipulated manner.\nThere is also a difference of opinion about the scope of the relevant\ncapacities: Must an autonomous agent be capable of responding to a\nwide range of reasons for and against her action? or is it enough that\nher motives are responsive to the \u201cstrongest,\u201d \u201cmost\ncompelling\u201d reasons? and can these reasons include the sort of\ncredible threats that figure in cases of coercion? What range of\nattitudes must an autonomous agent be capable of calling into\nquestion?  How well must she be capable of reasoning? Does it matter\nwhether she is guided by certain principles of rationality? Must it be\npossible for her to draw different conclusions on the basis of the\nreasons she considers? Is it essential that she could have considered\na different set of reasons instead?\n\n\nThere are even disagreements over whether the reasons to which\nself-governing agents respond are, as most assume, practical\nconsiderations concerning what to do, or what is worth doing. It has\nbeen suggested that agents govern their actions by engaging in\ntheoretical reasoning to the end of forming beliefs about which modes\nof behavior they could explain, given their desires. (Velleman) This suggestion\nstresses the extent to which governing oneself involves deferring to\npsychic demands whose power is independent of one\u2019s authority. On this\npicture, an agent exercises authority over what she does only once she\nis faced with a set of possible actions, whose possibility reflects\ntheir compatibility with the causal power of her desires: in predicting\nthat she will perform one of these actions, she authorizes this action,\nand thereby strengthens her motives for performing\n it.[12]\n\n\nThis way of interpreting the link between autonomous agency and\nresponsiveness to reasons raises larger questions about the\nrelationship between our practical impulses and our reason.  The\nanswers to these questions, and to those mentioned above can be\ncombined in many different ways.  Not only, moreover, can each\napproach thus take a wide variety of forms, but the approaches\nthemselves can (and often do) figure together as necessary or\nsufficient conditions in a single complex account.\n",
