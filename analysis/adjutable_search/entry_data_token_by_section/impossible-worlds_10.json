    "main_text": "The Structure of Impossible Worlds || The Closeness of Impossible Worlds\n4.2 The Closeness of Impossible Worlds\n\nIf impossible worlds display different degrees of logical structure\n(or lack thereof), it may make sense to order them. A natural way to\ndo this is via an extension of the traditional \u201ccloseness\u201d\nrelations between possible worlds. How to spell out the ordering in\ndetail, though, is far from straightforward. Within standard\nconditional logics, and in the treatment of counterfactual\nconditionals in terms of possible worlds due to Robert Stalnaker\n(1968) and David Lewis (1973), worlds stand in similarity relations;\nand similarity comes in degrees. This is usually represented by having\neach possible world, \\(w\\), come with a system of\n\u201cspheres\u201d. If \\(W\\) is the set of all worlds, let \\(\\$\\)\nbe a function from worlds to sets of subsets of \\(W\\), so that \\(\\$w =\n\\{S_1, S_2 , \\ldots \\}\\), with \\(w \\in S_1 \\subseteq S_2 \\subseteq\n\\ldots = W\\). Worlds within a given sphere \\(S_i\\) are more similar to\n\\(w\\) than worlds outside it.\n\nIf we take the special case in which \\(w =\\) the actual world (call it\n\u201c@\u201d), we get a natural arrangement of possible worlds in a\nsystem of spheres that mirrors their degree of (dis)similarity with\nrespect to @, according to the different kinds of possibilities and\n(relative) impossibilities they represent. For instance, a world which\nis exactly like @, except that Franz wears a white t-shirt instead of\nthe black one he\u2019s actually wearing while writing these lines,\nis, intuitively, closer to @ than a world at which the laws of physics\nare turned upside down. Some people have a general, intuitive\ndepiction of such closeness relations, and set out a hierarchy of\nmodalities accordingly: possible worlds where the laws of physics are\ndifferent from ours are naturally seen as more eccentric than worlds\nwhere only biological, but not physical, laws are different; and these\nare more eccentric than possible worlds with minimal factual changes\nwith respect to @, such as the white t-shirt world.\n\nCan such a natural view be extended to impossible worlds? First, it is\nintuitive to claim that some impossible worlds are more similar to the\nactual world @ than others. For instance, the \u201cexplosion\u201d\nworld (call it \\(e)\\) at which everything is the case (every sentence\nis true) seems to be as far from @ as one can imagine, if one can\nactually imagine or conceive such an extremely absurd situation. Now,\npick the impossible world, \\(t\\), at which everything is as in @,\nexcept that Franz wears an impossible t-shirt which is white all over\nand black all over. Intuitively, \\(t\\) is closer to @ than \\(e\\).\n\nNext, some authors (e.g. Mares 1997) favor Nolan\u2019s SIC principle\n(introduced in\n section 2.5).\n This implies that any possible world is closer to @ than any\nimpossible world is to @. A system of spheres for impossible worlds\ncentered on @ will just extend the intuitive possible worlds spheres\ndescribed above, by adding further, larger spheres where worlds\noutside (logical, or more generally unrestricted) possibility stand.\nBut how are these latter to be internally ordered?\n\nOne very general option is the following. Even though we subscribe to\nsome unrestricted comprehension principle for impossible worlds, we\nmay admit that worlds where only the intensional operators, e.g., the\nbox and diamond of necessity and possibility, behave in a non-standard\nfashion are less deviant than worlds where also the extensional\noperators, like classical conjunction and disjunction, do. Let us call\nworlds of the former kind intensionally impossible and worlds\nof the latter kind extensionally impossible. This picture\n(inspired by Priest 2005, Chapter 1) has some intuitive force to\nrecommend it. Kripkean non-normal worlds, where only the behaviour of\nthe modal operators is non-standard (see\n section 5.1),\n are intuitively less deviant than open worlds, where all formulas may\nbehave arbitrarily. Generalizing, the view would entail arranging the\nrespective spheres in such a way that any intensionally impossible\nworld is closer to @ than any extensionally impossible one.\n\nThis very general ordering of impossibilities, albeit intuitive, may\nnot be fully satisfying. A general qualm concerns the SIC principle\nitself. For one may claim that, intuitively, some slightly deviant\nimpossible worlds may be more similar to the actual world @\nthan some possible but very weird worlds. For instance, the impossible\nworld \\(t\\) above, which is like @ except for Franz\u2019s wearing an\ninconsistent T-shirt, may look more familiar than a world which is\nlogically possible, but where the laws of physics are turned upside\ndown. Several authors (Nolan 1997, Vander Laan 2004, Bernstein 2016)\nhave proposed putative counterexamples to SIC along these lines.\n\nAlthough we cannot pursue this topic further within the limits of this\nentry, the discussion developed so far should show that the issue of\nthe structure, closeness, and ordering of impossible worlds is quite\nopen.\n",
