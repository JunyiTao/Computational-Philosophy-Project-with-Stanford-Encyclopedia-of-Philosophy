    "main_text": "What is Pornography?\n1. What is Pornography?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t define pornography,\u201d one judge once famously\nsaid, \u201cbut I know it when I see it\u201d (Justice Stewart in\nJacobellis v. Ohio 378 US 184 [1964]). Can we do better?\n\nThe word \u201cpornography\u201d comes from the Greek for writing\nabout prostitutes. However, the etymology of the term is not much of a\nguide to current usage, since many of the things commonly called\n\u201cpornography\u201d nowadays are neither literally written nor\nliterally about prostitutes.\n\nHere is a first, simple definition. Pornography is any material\n(either pictures or words) that is sexually explicit. This\ndefinition of pornography may pick out different types of material in\ndifferent contexts, since what is viewed as sexually explicit can vary\nfrom culture to culture and over time. \u201cSexually explicit\u201d\nfunctions as a kind of indexical term, picking out different features\ndepending on what has certain effects or breaks certain taboos in\ndifferent contexts and cultures. Displays of women\u2019s uncovered ankles\ncount as sexually explicit in some cultures, but not in most western\ncultures nowadays (although they once did: the display of a female\nankle in Victorian times was regarded as most risqu\u00e9). There may\nbe borderline cases too: do displays of bared breasts still count as\nsexually explicit in various contemporary western cultures? However,\nsome material seems clearly to count as sexually explicit in many\ncontexts today: in particular, audio, written or visual representations\nof sexual acts (e.g., sexual intercourse, oral sex) and exposed body\nparts (e.g., the vagina, anus and penis-especially the erect\npenis).\n\nHowever, this first simple definition is not quite right. Anatomy\ntextbooks for medical students are sexually explicit \u2013 they depict\nexposed genitalia, for example \u2013 but are rarely, if ever, viewed as\npornography. Sexual explicitness may be a necessary condition for\nmaterial to count as pornographic, but it does not seem to be\nsufficient. So, something needs to be added to the simple definition.\nWhat else might be required?\n\nHere is a second definition. Pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial (verbal or pictorial) that is primarily designed\nto produce sexual arousal in viewers. This definition is better:\nit deals with the problem of anatomy textbooks and the like. Indeed,\nthis definition is one that is frequently employed (or presupposed) in\ndiscussions of pornography and censorship (e.g., Williams 1981). Of\ncourse, it is important to distinguish here between sexually explicit\nmaterial that is wholly or primarily designed to\nproduce sexual arousal (i.e., whose only or overriding aim is to\nproduce sexual arousal) and material whose aim is to do this in order\nto make some other artistic or political point. The film Last Tango\nin Paris arguably aims to arouse audiences, but this is not its\nprimary aim. It does so in order to make a broader political point.\n Within the general class of pornography, so defined, there is\nenormous variety in content. For example, some material depicts women,\nand sometimes men, in postures of sexual display (e.g., Playboy\ncenterfolds). Some depicts non-violent sexual acts (both homosexual\nand heterosexual) between adults portrayed as equal and consenting\nparticipants. Feminist pornography is a subset of pornography (in this\ngeneral sense) that aims to subvert traditional gender roles, bodies,\nand narratives unreflectively endorsed by mainstream heterosexual\npornography. Other sexually explicit representations depict acts of\nviolent coercion: people being whipped, beaten, bound, tortured,\nmutilated, raped and even killed. Some sexually explicit material may\nbe degrading without necessarily being overtly violent. This material\ndepicts people (most often women) in positions of servility and\nsubordination in their sexual relations with others, or engaged in\nsexual acts that many people would regard as humiliating. Some\nsexually explicit material involves or depicts children. Some portrays\nbestiality and necrophilia; and so on. Researchers often distinguish\nbetween \u2018hardcore\u2019 and \u2018softcore\u2019 porn;\n\u2018egalitarian\u2019 and \u2018inegalitarian\u2019 porn; or\nbetween \u2018violent\u2019, \u2018non-violent and\ndegrading\u2019, and \u2018non-violent and non-degrading\u2019\npornography, since different types of pornography may be harmful to\ndifferent degrees and in different ways.\n\nThe decades following the advent of the internet have seen an\nexplosion in the amount of readily accessible pornography; and\npornography use is common among adolescents as well as adults.\nPornography production and distribution is now a massive and highly\nprofitable international industry, with a multibillion-dollar annual\nturnover.\n\nThe two definitions considered above are purely\ndescriptive: They leave it open whether pornography is good or\nbad. By contrast, a third approach to defining pornography is\nvalue-laden. Sometimes when people describe something (e.g., a\nbook such as Tropic of Capricorn or a film such as Baise\nMoi) as \u201cpornographic,\u201d they seem to be doing more\nthan simply dispassionately describing its sexually explicit content or\nthe intentions of its producers\u2014indeed, in these debates, the\nintentions of producers are sometimes treated as irrelevant to the\nwork\u2019s status as pornography. They seem to be saying, in addition, that\nit is bad\u2014and perhaps also that its badness is not\nredeemed by other artistic, literary, or political merit the work may\npossess. (Consider, for example, how the term \u201cvisual\npornography\u201d is sometimes used to condemn certain artworks, often\nwhen the work is not even sexually explicit.)\n\nThis suggests a third definition: pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial designed to produce sexual arousal in consumers that is\nbad in a certain way. This definition of pornography is\nvalue-laden because it is built into the definition that pornography is\n(somehow) bad; material that is not bad in the relevant way is not\npornography. It might be that all and only sexually explicit\nmaterial is bad in the relevant way (e.g., obscene), in which case\n\u201cpornography\u201d will refer to all and only the class of\nsexually explicit materials. But it may be that only some\nsexually explicit material has the (allegedly) objectionable property\n(e.g., subordinating women), in which case only that objectionable\nsubset of sexually explicit material will count as\npornography. And, of course, it is possible that no sexually\nexplicit material is bad in the relevant way (e.g., harmful to women),\nin which case we would have an error theory about pornography: there\nwould be no pornography, so defined, merely harmless, sexually explicit\n\u201cerotica\u201d.\n\nSeveral influential approaches define pornography as sexually\nexplicit material that is (somehow) bad\u2014although they disagree\nboth about why pornography is bad and exactly what\nmaterials are pornographic. A particularly influential approach, which\nhas provided the dominant legal framework for understanding pornography\nin the U.S. and U.K., has been to define pornography in terms of\nobscenity. Material counts as obscene if an average,\nreasonable person applying community standards would find the work as a\nwhole to lack any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific\nvalue, and the work describes or depicts in an obvious way offensive\nsexual conduct. On this conception, which is employed by many of\npornography\u2019s conservative critics, pornography should be regulated\nbecause it transgresses certain (allegedly) shared community standards\nof morality or decency, and thus counts as obscene. Conservatives\nusually class all sexually explicit material\u2014even\negalitarian sexually explicit \u201cerotica\u201d\u2014within the category of\npornography since conservatives typically view all such material as\nobscene. (For critical discussions of this obscenity approach, see\nSchauer 1982; Feinberg 1987; MacKinnon 1987.)\n\nBut the badness of pornography need not reside in obscenity.\nPornography might be defined, not as sexually explicit material that is\nobscene, but as sexually explicit material that harms women.\nThus, many contemporary feminist definitions define\n\u201cpornography\u201d as material (pictures and/or words) that\ndepicts women\u2019s subordination in such a way as to endorse,\nencourage or eroticize it (Longino 1980; MacKinnon\n1987). This definition of pornography leaves it open in principle that\nthere might be sexually explicit material that is not pornography:\nsexually explicit material that does not depict women\u2019s subordination,\nor that depicts but does not endorse it, will count as harmless\n\u201cerotica.\u201d Determining whether a given film or image\nfunctions to endorse oppressive social hierarchies is complex and\ncontext-sensitive; it depends not simply on the intrinsic content of\nthe film or image, or on the intentions of its creators, but also on\nhow it is interpreted or used on a particular occasion (McGowan 2019,\nCh. 6). The very same material (e.g., a graphic documentary film about\nthe sex trade) could count as pornographic in one context (e.g., if\nused for masturbation) but not in another (e.g., when shown in gender\nstudies class). Likewise, although it may depict sexual\nrelations of domination and subordination, BDSM material may not\nfunction to endorse oppressive sexual hierarchies on many or\nmost occasions of use. If so, it would not be pornographic in this\ncurrent value-laden sense, but rather harmless \u201cerotica\u201d.\n\nOf course, women may not be the only people harmed by the production\nor consumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material. The\nconsumption of sexually explicit material has often been thought to be\nharmful to its (predominantly male) consumers: for example, by making\nthem less likely to have long-term, loving sexual relationships. Many\npeople strongly object to \u201cchild pornography,\u201d that subset\nof sexually explicit material that involves depictions of actual\nchildren engaged in sexual activity. This class of sexually explicit\nmaterial is widely regarded as objectionable because it involves the\nactual sexual exploitation of children, together with a permanent\nrecord of that abuse which may further harm their interests.\n\nI have discussed how, on this third approach to defining\n\u201cpornography\u201d as sexually explicit material that is bad or\nharmful in a certain way, there are three possibilities:\n\u201cpornography\u201d might name all, some or\neven no sexually explicit material, depending on what (if\nany) class of sexually explicit material is in fact bad in the\nrelevant way.  But it is worth noting that there is an interesting\nfourth possibility.  It is possible that some non-sexually\nexplicit material might also turn out to be bad in the\nrelevant way. It might be that some non-sexually explicit material is\nobscene in the relevant sense (e.g., Andres Serrano\u2019s famously\ncontroversial artwork entitled \u201cPiss Christ,\u201d which\ndisplays a plastic crucifix in urine with cow\u2019s blood). Or it might\nturn out that non-sexually explicit advertising that depicts women in\npositions of sexual servility in such a way as to endorse or eroticize\nthat subordination is also bad in the relevant way. (As many\nphilosophers might be inclined to put the point, the sexually explicit\nmaterials that subordinate women via their depiction of women as\nsubordinate may turn out not to form a natural kind.) In this case,\nthere are two options.  \u201cPornography\u201d might be taken to\nname only the sexually explicit subset of material that is\nbad in the relevant sense (e.g., that depicts women as men\u2019s sexual\nsubordinates in such a way as to endorse their subordination); or\n\u201cpornography\u201d might be taken to refer to all the\nmaterial that is bad in that way, whether that material is sexually\nexplicit or not. The former option would clearly stick more closely to\nthe everyday conception of pornography as involving the sexually\nexplicit. But it might be that this ordinary conception, on\nreflection, turns out not to capture what is of moral and political\nimportance. There may thus be a theoretical reason to conceive of\npornography more broadly than simply sexually explicit material that\nis bad in a certain way, or perhaps simply to invent a new term that\ncaptures the theoretically interesting kind.  Some feminists seem\ninclined to this broader approach, suggesting that material that\nmerely implies certain messages about sex can sometimes count as\npornography if it contributes in certain ways to sexualized violence\nor oppression (Longino 1980; MacKinnon 1984). This may include some\nnon-sexually explicit material that would not ordinarily be thought of\nas pornography: for example, photographs in artwork, advertising or\nfashion spreads that depict women bound, chained, or bruised in such a\nway as to endorse or eroticize this treatment.\n\nThe term \u201cpornography\u201d is used in all of these different\nways in everyday discourse and debate, as well as in philosophical\ndiscussions. Sometimes it is used to mean merely material which is\nsexually explicit; sometimes it is used to mean material which is\nsexually explicit and objectionable in some particular way;\nand so on. (For further discussion, see Rea 2001.) We do not need to\nchoose between these different definitions, for all of them capture\nsomething of the term\u2019s everyday use and different definitions may be\nuseful for different purposes. What matters crucially is that we know\nwhich definition is being used on a particular occasion. The fact that\n\u201cpornography\u201d has different senses can have two very\nunfortunate consequences if these differences are not clearly noted and\nkept in mind: It can make it seem that there is disagreement when there\nis not; and it can obscure the real nature of the disagreement when\nthere is.\n\nHere is one topical example of how this might happen. Some feminists\nobject to pornography on the grounds that it harms women. Others claim\nthat pornography may not always be harmful to women and may even\nsometimes be liberating and beneficial. It seems that there is genuine\ndisagreement here. But is there? Not necessarily. For the two sides\nmight mean different things by \u201cpornography.\u201d Suppose that\nfeminists who object to pornography are defining\n\u201cpornography\u201d as sexually explicit material that\nsubordinates women. So, pornography, for them, is that subset of\nsexually explicit material that in fact harms women. This definition\nmakes it definitionally true that pornography, wherever it exists, is\nbad for women. Those who defend pornography, however, may be using\n\u201cpornography\u201d to mean simply sexually explicit material\naimed or used primarily for sexual arousal (regardless of whether it is\nharmful to women). There may thus be no genuine disagreement here, for\nboth sides might agree that sexually explicit material that\nharms women is objectionable. They might also agree that there\nis nothing objectionable about sexually explicit material that does not\nharm women (or anyone else). If different parties are using\n\u201cpornography\u201d in different senses they may be talking past\neach other, perhaps without realizing it.\n\nTwo really substantive issues at stake in the feminist debate over\npornography are 1) whether any sexually explicit material is\nin fact harmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it?;\nand 2) whether all sexually explicit material is in fact\nharmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it? (We can\nthus phrase two of the important issues, if we like, without mentioning\n\u201cpornography\u201d at all.)\n",
