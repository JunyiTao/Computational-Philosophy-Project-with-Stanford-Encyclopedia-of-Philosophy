    "main_text": "Extant Philosophical Commentaries || Space and Place\n2.3 Space and Place\n\n\nPhiloponus\u2019 impetus theory ties in with other far-reaching\ncriticisms of Aristotelian principles of physics. Aristotle had\ndismissed the notion of a void as a logical\nimpossibility. Philoponus concedes that in nature empty spaces never\nbecome actual, but he insists that a clear conception of the void is\nnot only coherent but also necessary if one wants to explain movement\nin a plenum. When bodies move and in consequence exchange places, this\npresupposes that somehow there is empty space available to be filled\nby them (In Phys. 693f.). Again, there are certain phenomena\nwhich clearly exhibit the force of the vacuum, for example handling a\npipette (clepsudra), which allows one to raise small\nquantities of fluids, or the fact that one can suck up water through a\npipe (In Phys. 571f). Philoponus\u2019 elaborate defense of\nthe void (In Phys. 675\u201394) is closely related to his\nconceptions of place and space (In Phys. 557\u201385). Aristotle\ndefined the place of a body as the inner surface of the body or all\nthe bodies taken together that contain it (Phys. IV 4);\nPhiloponus replies that place ought instead to be conceived as the\nthree-dimensional extension identical to the determinate size of the given\nbody, i.e. its volume. This was also the theory of the Stoic\nChrysippus, but there is no indication in the extant text of\nPhiloponus (as there are in his later works) that he saw himself\ninfluenced here by the Stoics.\n",
