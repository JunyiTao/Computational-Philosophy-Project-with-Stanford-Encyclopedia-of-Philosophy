If and when they do, their relata cannot fail to exist. If\nCleopatra kisses Caesar, then both Cleopatra and Caesar must exist.\nNot so with intentional relations. If Cleopatra loves Caesar, then\npresumably there is some concrete particular in space and time whom\nCleopatra loves. But one may also love Anna Karenina (not a concrete\nparticular in space and time, but a fictitious character). Similarly,\nthe relata of the admiration relation (another intentional relation)\nare not limited to concrete particulars in space and time. One may\nadmire not only Albert Einstein but also Sherlock Holmes (a fictitious\ncharacter). As the following passage from the Appendix to the 1911\nedition of his 1874 book testifies, this asymmetry between\nnon-intentional and intentional relations puzzled Brentano:\n\nWhat is characteristic of every mental activity is, as I believe I\nhave shown, the reference to something as an object. In this respect,\nevery mental activity seems to be something relational. [\u2026] In\nother relations both terms\u2014both the fundament and the\nterminus\u2014are real, but here only the first term\u2014the\nfundament is real. [\u2026] If I take something relative [\u2026]\nsomething larger or smaller for example, then, if the larger thing\nexists, the smaller one exists too. [\u2026] Something like what is\ntrue of relations of similarity and difference holds true for\nrelations of cause and effect. For there to be such a relation, both\nthe thing that causes and the thing that is caused must exist.\n[\u2026] It is entirely different with mental reference. If someone\nthinks of something, the one who is thinking must certainly exist, but\nthe object of his thinking need not exist at all. In fact, if he is\ndenying something, the existence of the object is precisely what is\nexcluded whenever his denial is correct. So the only thing which is\nrequired by mental reference is the person thinking. The terminus of\nthe so-called relation does not need to exist in reality at all. For\nthis reason, one could doubt whether we really are dealing with\nsomething relational here, and not, rather, with something somewhat\nsimilar to something relational in a certain respect, which might,\ntherefore, better be called \u201cquasi-relational.\u201d\n\n\nWhile the orthodox paradigm is clearly consistent with the possibility\nthat general thoughts may involve abstract objects (e.g., numbers) and\nabstract properties and relations, none of which are in space and\ntime, special problems arise with respect to singular thoughts\nconstrued as intentional relations to non-existent or fictitious\nobjects. Two related assumptions lie at the core of the orthodox\nparadigm. One is the assumption that the mystery of the intentional\nrelation should be elucidated against the background of\nnon-intentional relations. The other is the assumption that\nintentional relations which seem to involve non-existent (e.g.,\nfictitious) entities should be clarified by reference to intentional\nrelations involving particulars existing in space and time.\n\nThe paradigm of the intentional relation that satisfies the orthodox\npicture is the intentionality of what can be called singular\nthoughts, namely those true thoughts that are directed towards\nconcrete individuals or particulars that exist in space and time. A\nsingular thought is such that it would not be available\u2014it could\nnot be entertained\u2014unless the concrete individual that is the\ntarget of the thought existed. Unlike the propositional contents of\ngeneral thoughts that involve only abstract universals such\nas properties and/or relations, the propositional content of a\nsingular thought may involve in addition a relation to a concrete\nindividual or particular. The contrast between \u2018singular\u2019\nand \u2018general\u2019 propositions has been much emphasized by\nKaplan (1978, 1989). In a slightly different perspective, Tyler Burge\n(1977) has characterized singular thoughts as incompletely\nconceptualized or de re thoughts whose relation to the\nobjects they are about is supplied by the context. On some views, the\nobject of the singular thought is even part of it. On the\northodox view, part of the importance of true singular thoughts for a\nclarification of intentionality lies in the fact that some true\nsingular thoughts are about concrete perceptible objects. Singular\nthoughts about concrete perceptible objects may seem simpler and more\nprimitive than either general ones or thoughts about abstract\nentities.\n\nConsider, for example, what must be the case for belief-ascription (1)\nto be true:\n\nAva believes that Lionel Jospin is a Socialist.\n\n\nIntuitively, the belief ascribed to Ava by (1) has intentionality in\nthe sense that it is of or about Lionel Jospin and\nthe property of being a Socialist. Besides being a belief (i.e., a\nspecial attitude different from a wish, a desire, a fear or\nan intention), the identity of Ava\u2019s belief depends on its\npropositional content. What Ava believes is identified by the embedded\n\u2018that\u2019-clause that can stand all by itself as in (2):\n\nLionel Jospin is a Socialist.\n\n\nOn the face of it, an utterance of (2) is true if and only if a given\nconcrete individual does exemplify the property of being a Socialist.\nArguably, it is essential to the proposition that Ava\nbelieves\u2014the proposition expressed by an utterance of\n(2)\u2014that it is about Jospin and the property of being a\nSocialist. Just by virtue of having such a true belief, Ava must\ntherefore stand in relation\u2014the belief relation\u2014to Jospin\nand the property of being a Socialist. Notice that Ava can have a\nbelief about Jospin and the property of being a Socialist even though\nshe has never seen Jospin in person.\n\nFrom within the orthodox paradigm, one central piece of the mystery of\nintentionality can be brought out by reflection on the conditions in\nwhich simple singular thoughts about concrete individuals are true.\nThis is the problem of the relational nature of the contents\nof true singular beliefs. In order to generate this problem, it is not\nnecessary to ascend to false or abstract beliefs about fictional\nentities. It is enough to consider how a true thought about a concrete\nindividual that exists in space and time can arise. On the one hand,\nAva\u2019s belief seems to be a singular belief about a concrete\nindividual. It seems essential to Ava\u2019s belief that it has the\npropositional content that it has. And it seems essential to the\npropositional content of Ava\u2019s belief that Ava must stand in\nrelation to somebody else who can be very remote from her in either\nspace or time. On the other hand, Ava\u2019s belief is a state\ninternal to Ava. As John Perry (1994, 187) puts it, beliefs and other\nso-called \u2018propositional attitudes\u2019 seem to be\n\u201clocal mental phenomena.\u201d How can it be essential to an\ninternal state of Ava\u2019s that Ava stands in relation to someone\nelse? How can one reconcile the local and the relational characters of\npropositional attitudes?\n",
