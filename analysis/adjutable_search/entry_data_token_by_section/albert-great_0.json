    "main_text": "Life of Albert the Great\n1. Life of Albert the Great\n\n\nThe precise date of Albert\u2019s birth is not known. It is generally\nconceded that he was born into a knightly family sometime around the\nyear 1200 in Lauingen an der Donau in Germany. He was apparently in\nItaly in the year 1222 where he was present when a rather terrible\nearthquake struck in Lombardy. A year later he was still in Italy and\nstudying at the University of Padua. The same year Jordan of Saxony\nreceived him into the Dominican order. He was sent to Cologne in order\nto complete his training for the order. He finished this training as\nwell as a course of studies in theology by 1228. He then began\nteaching as a lector at Cologne, Hildesheim, Freiburg im Breisgau,\nRegensburg, and Strassburg. During this period he published his first\nmajor work, De natura boni.\n\n\nTen years later he is recorded as having been present at the general\nchapter of the Dominican Order held in Bologna. Two years later he\nvisited Saxony where he observed the appearance of a comet. Some time\nbetween 1241 and 1242 he was sent to the University of Paris to\ncomplete his theological education. He followed the usual prescription\nof lecturing on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. In addition\nhe began writing his six part Summa parisiensis dealing with\nthe sacraments of the Church, the incarnation and resurrection of\nChrist, the four coevals, human nature, and the nature of the good. He\ntook his degree as master of theology in 1245 and began to teach\ntheology at the university under Gueric de Saint-Quentin. St. Thomas\nAquinas became his student at this time and remained under\nAlbert\u2019s direction for the next three years. In 1248 Albert was\nappointed regent of studies at the studium generale that was\nnewly created by the Dominican order in Cologne. So Albert, along with\nThomas Aquinas, left Paris and went to Cologne. Thomas continued his\nstudies under Albert in Cologne and served as magister\nstudium in the school as well until 1252. Then Thomas returned to\nParis to take up his teaching duties while Albert remained in Cologne,\nwhere he began to work on the vast project he set himself of preparing\na paraphrase of each of the known works of Aristotle.\n\n\nIn 1254 the Dominican order again assigned Albert a difficult task.\nHe was elected the prior provincial for the German-speaking province\nof the order. This position mandated that Albert spend a great deal of\nhis time traveling throughout the province visiting Dominican\nconvents, priories, and even a Dominican mission in Riga. This task\noccupied Albert until 1256. That year he returned to Cologne, but left\nthe same year for Paris in order to attend a General Chapter of his\norder in which the allegations of William of St. Amour\u2019s De\npericulis novissimorum temporum against mendicant orders were\nconsidered. A little later Pope Alexander IV asked Albert to go to\nAnagni in order to speak to a commission of Cardinals who were looking\ninto the claims of William. While engaged in this charge Albert\ncompleted his refutation of Averroistic psychology with his De\nunitate intellectus contra Averroistas. Afterwards Albert\ndeparted for another tour of the province of Germany. In 1257 he\nreturned to the papal court, which was now located in Viterbo. He was\nrelieved of his duties as prior provincial and returned again to\nCologne as regent of studies. He continued to teach until 1259 when he\ntraveled to Valenciennes in order to attend a General Chapter of his\norder. At that time, along with Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Tarentasia,\nBonhomme Brito, and Florent de Hesdin, he undertook on behalf of his\norder an extensive discussion of the curriculum of the scholastic\nprogram used by the order.\n\n\nThe next year of his life found Albert once again appointed to an\nonerous duty. In obedience to the wishes of the pope Albert was\nconsecrated a bishop of the Church and sent to Ratisbon (modern\nRegensburg) in order to undertake a reform of abuses in that diocese.\nAlbert worked at this task until 1263 when Pope Urban IV relieved him\nof his duties and asked Albert to preach the Crusade in the German\nspeaking countries. This duty occupied Albert until the year 1264. He\nthen went to the city of W\u00fcrzburg where he stayed until 1267.\n\n\nAlbert spent the next eight years traveling around Germany conducting\nvarious ecclesiastical tasks. Then in 1274 while he was traveling to\nthe Council of Lyons Albert received the sad news of the untimely\ndeath of Thomas Aquinas, his friend and former student of many\nyears. After the close of the Council Albert returned to\nGermany. There is evidence that he traveled to Paris in the year 1277\nin order to defend Aquinas\u2019 teaching, which was under attack at\nthe university. In 1279, anticipating his death he drew up his own\nlast will and testament. On November 15, 1280 he died and was buried\nin Cologne. On December 15, 1931 Pope Pius XI declared Albert both a\nsaint and a doctor of the Church. On the 16th of December\n1941 Pope Pius XII declared Albert the patron saint of the natural\nsciences.\n",
