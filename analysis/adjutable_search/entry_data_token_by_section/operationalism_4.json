Critiques of operationalism\n\nDespite the initial popularity of Bridgman\u2019s ideas, by the\nmiddle of the 20th century the common reactions among philosophers and\nphilosophically-minded scientists were strongly critical.\nOperationalism received many high-profile debates, among them a\nsymposium held at the annual meeting of the American Association for\nthe Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1953 (published in Frank 1956),\nand the Psychological Review issue mentioned above. On such\noccasions Bridgman attempted to refine and defend his views, but also\nfound that the debate was moving in directions that both surprised and\ndisturbed him. In his contribution to the AAAS symposium he\nexclaimed:\n\nThere would seem to be no reason why I am better fitted than anyone\nelse to open this discussion. As I listened to the papers I felt that\nI have only a historical connection with this thing called\n\u201coperationalism.\u201d In short, I feel that I have created a\nFrankenstein, which has certainly got away from me. I abhor the word\noperationalism or operationism, which seems to imply\na dogma, or at least a thesis of some kind. The thing I have envisaged\nis too simple to be dignified by so pretentious a name. (Bridgman in\nFrank 1956, 75\u201376)\n\n\nStill, arguably it was not Bridgman\u2019s own ideas about\noperational analysis but the Frankenstein of operationalism that had a\nmore significant impact in philosophy and science, so this survey of\noperationalism must deal with how other people responded to\noperationalism as they saw it. In the course of the discussion I will\ntry to point out some places where there were clear misunderstandings\nof Bridgman\u2019s ideas, and also other places where Bridgman\nhimself was ambivalent or ambiguous, rather than simply\nmisunderstood.\n\nGiven the timing and contexts of the publication of Bridgman\u2019s\nideas, the philosophical debates surrounding them were to a large\nextent framed in relation to logical positivism, which was just making\nits big impact on the American philosophical scene. The young Herbert\nFeigl (1902\u20131988), with a personal introduction by no less than\nMoritz Schlick, came to Harvard in 1930 with the express purpose of\nlearning from Bridgman, despite the latter\u2019s warning that he did\nnot have much to teach (Walter 1990, 164\u2013165; Moyer 1991, 391).\nBridgman\u2019s insistence on operational meaningfulness had at least\na surface resemblance to the logical positivists\u2019 verification\ntheory of meaning. Bergmann thought Bridgman had given a\n\u201cscientist\u2019s version\u201d of the latter (Bergmann in\nFrank 1956, 55), and Carl Hempel regarded operationalism and logical\npositivism as \u201cclosely akin\u201d to each other (Hempel in\nFrank 1956, 56). And it is not difficult to see how a kindred\nphilosophical doctrine coming from a world-class scientist would have\ncaptured the logical positivists\u2019 imagination.\n\nWhen subjected to the scrutiny of professional philosophers, however,\nBridgman\u2019s ideas were soon exposed as unsystematic and\nundeveloped, as he freely admitted himself. Moreover, it became\nevident that his ideas did not help logical positivists solve the key\nproblems that they were struggling with. After the initial\nfascination, the standard positivist (and post-positivist) reaction to\noperationalism was disappointment, and operationalism was often seen\nas a failed philosophy that did not live up to its promises.\n",
