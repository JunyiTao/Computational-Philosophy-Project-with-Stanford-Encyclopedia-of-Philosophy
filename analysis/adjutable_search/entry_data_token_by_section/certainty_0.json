    "main_text": "Kinds of certainty\n1. Kinds of certainty\n\nThere are various kinds of certainty (Russell 1948, p. 396). A belief\nis psychologically certain when the subject who has it is\nsupremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is similar\nto incorrigibility, which is the property a belief has of\nbeing such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But\npsychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility. A\nbelief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible; this\nmay happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling\nbit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it\nup for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible without\nbeing psychologically certain. For example, a mother may be incapable\nof giving up the belief that her son did not commit a gruesome murder,\nand yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief, she may be\ntortured by doubt.\n\nA second kind of certainty is epistemic. Roughly\ncharacterized, a belief is certain in this sense when it has the\nhighest possible epistemic status. Epistemic certainty is often\naccompanied by psychological certainty, but it need not be. It is\npossible that a subject may have a belief that enjoys the highest\npossible epistemic status and yet be unaware that it does. (More\ngenerally, a subject\u2019s being certain that p does not\nentail that she is certain that she is certain that p; on\nthis point, see Van Cleve 1979, and see Alston 1980 on level\nconfusions in epistemology.) In such a case, the subject may feel less\nthan the full confidence that her epistemic position warrants. I will\nsay more below about the analysis of epistemic certainty and its\nrelation to psychological certainty.\n\nSome philosophers also make use of the notion of moral\ncertainty (see Markie 1986; James 2020). For example, in the Latin\nversion of Part IV of the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes\nsays that \u201csome things are considered as morally certain, that\nis, as having sufficient certainty for application to ordinary life,\neven though they may be uncertain in relation to the absolute power of\nGod\u201d (PW 1, pp. 289\u201390). Thus characterized, moral\ncertainty appears to be epistemic in nature, though it is a lesser\nstatus than epistemic certainty (see Matthen 2014 for a\nsimilar account of what he calls \u201cempirical certainty\u201d). In the\nFrench version of this passage, however, Descartes says that\n\u201cmoral certainty is certainty which is sufficient to regulate\nour behaviour, or which measures up to the certainty we have on\nmatters relating to the conduct of life which we never normally doubt,\nthough we know that it is possible, absolutely speaking, that they may\nbe false\u201d (PW 1, p. 289 n. 2). Understood in this way, it does\nnot appear to be a species of knowledge, given that a belief can be\nmorally certain and yet false (contra Markie 1986, p. 36). Rather, on\nthis view, for a belief to be morally certain is for it to be\nsubjectively rational to a high degree. In a similar way, Spinoza\ndistinguishes moral certainty from mathematical certainty and says\nthat the former should not be rejected when \u201cit is confirmed by the\ntestimonies of so many prophets, is a source of great solace for those\nwhose capacity to reason is limited, is of great value to the state,\nand may be believed unreservedly without danger or damage\u201d\n(Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, ch. 15; see James 2020, ch.\n1). Moral certainty understood in this way is not merely a form of\npsychological certainty, as someone who has the highest degree of\nconfidence in a particular claim might nevertheless do so for\nmanifestly irrational or frivolous reasons.\n\nAlthough all three kinds of certainty are philosophically interesting,\nit is epistemic certainty that has traditionally been of central\nimportance. In what follows, then, I shall focus mainly on this kind\nof certainty.\n",
