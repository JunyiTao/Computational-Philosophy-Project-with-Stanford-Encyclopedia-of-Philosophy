    "main_text": "Conceptions of Divine Revelation || General/Natural and Special Revelation\n1.1 General/Natural and Special Revelation\n\nA common distinction that relates to the audience (n) is\nbetween general and special (or particular)\nrevelation, where the former refers to a revelation that is\nuniversally available, and the latter to a revelation made (directly\nor initially) to a limited group of people. Often, general revelation\nis identified with natural revelation, even though the latter\nconcept has to do with the means of revelation (k) rather than\nthe audience. The natural world, including human nature, is available\nto all, and would be the most plausible candidate as a means for a\ngeneral revelation. However, it is conceivable that God could have\nmade a general revelation by acting outside of the natural order, for\nexample by making miracles visible to all (Helm 1982: 17). Strictly\nspeaking, therefore, the counterpart to natural revelation\u2014if\nthere is a counterpart\u2014is supernatural revelation\nrather than special revelation. \u201cSupernatural\u201d, in a\ntheological context, refers to putative divine action that is not\nincluded in God\u2019s ordinary activity of creating and sustaining\nthe world. For the most part, however, \u201cgeneral\nrevelation\u201d and \u201cnatural revelation\u201d are used\ninterchangeably, as are their counterparts \u201cspecial\nrevelation\u201d and \u201csupernatural revelation\u201d (for\ncriticism of the distinction, see Downing 1964).\n\nSome philosophers make a distinction between natural revelation and\nnatural theology (e.g., King 2012; Helm 1982: 22\u201326;\nWolterstorff 1995: 24\u201325). According to Helm, for something to\nqualify as divine revelation it must be immediate, and the human\nrecipients must be passive. Since natural theology includes the\nactivity of inferring knowledge of God from publicly available\nevidence, natural theology is not a species of natural revelation,\nHelm argues. It is unclear, however, why God could not reveal himself\nin a way that requires inferential activity on the part of the\nrecipients, and many thinkers make no distinction between natural\nrevelation and natural theology (Davies 2009: 36; O\u2019Collins\n2016b: 287). In the context of this entry, however, it is necessary to\nexclude traditional natural theology from treatment, and\n\u201cnatural revelation\u201d will therefore be understood in\naccordance with Helm\u2019s restrictive definition. The major focus,\nhowever, will be on special\n revelation.[3]\n\nThe very idea of special revelation has often been viewed with\nsuspicion since the Enlightenment (Abraham 2002). Why is not natural\nrevelation enough? Why would God in addition need to reveal himself to\ncertain people at certain points in history? A related critique takes\nissue with divine hiddenness. If God exists, why does he seem to be\n\u201chidden\u201d, so that a revelation is necessary in the first\nplace? Since objections of this kind concern the coherence of\nreligious outlooks based on a purported \u201cspecial\u201d\nrevelation, it is reasonable for defenders of revelation to appeal to\nthe doctrines of their own religious tradition. Christian thinkers\nhave traditionally explained divine hiddenness and the need for\nspecial revelation with reference to humanity\u2019s fall into sin.\nSin has cognitive effects, and revelation is typically seen as the\nepistemic aspect of salvation (O\u2018Collins 2011: 70\u201374).\nWhen God acts in history to save humanity, he reveals himself and what\nhe is doing. Nevertheless, as a result of the Enlightenment critique,\nnineteenth century theologians started to downplay special revelation.\nInstead, they emphasized what could be ascertained about God on the\nbasis of \n\n\nrational argument, historical enquiry, analysis of the structures of\nhuman perception or moral motivation, or any combination of these.\n(Quash 2007: 328) \n\n\nThis \u201creduction\u201d of special revelation to a vague form of\ngeneral revelation, however, generated a counter-reaction in the\ntwentieth century by theologians such as Karl Barth, who emphasized a\nunique divine revelation in Christ.\n\nWhen it comes to the means (k) of revelation, philosophical\nreflection can either consider a priori possibilities for how\nrevelation might proceed, or study ideas and claims about revelation\nfound in a particular religious tradition, such as Christianity.\nPerhaps it is most fruitful to combine analysis of religious claims\nwith conceptual or metaphysical reflection in order to map the\npossible means of divine revelation. Using this kind of method,\nWilliam Abraham has described revelation as a \u201cpolymorphous\nconcept\u201d like \u201cteach\u201d and \u201cfarm\u201d\n(Abraham 1997: 206). Just like one can teach by doing a variety of\ndifferent concrete things (lecturing, using pictures or models,\ngrading papers, etc.), so God could reveal by doing many different\nthings, such as speaking, doing \u201cmight acts\u201d in history,\ncausing dreams, visions or other experiences, or \u201cmaking Himself\npresent and manifesting Himself\u201d by means of an incarnation\n(Vatican II, Dei Verbum \u00a7 4).\n",
