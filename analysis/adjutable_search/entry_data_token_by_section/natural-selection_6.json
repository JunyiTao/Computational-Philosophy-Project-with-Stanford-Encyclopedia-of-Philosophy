    "main_text": "Natural Selection and Explanation || Explanatory Scope\n4.1 Explanatory Scope\n\nThere exists a longstanding debate among both scientists and\nphilosophers over exactly what natural selection can explain, one\nbegun by Sober and Neander who were concerned with what natural\nselection can explain (Sober 1984, 1995; Neander 1988, 1995). In a\nrecent expansive treatment, Razeto-Barry & Frick 2011 distinguish\nbetween the creative and non-creative views of natural selection. On\nthe non-creative view, natural selection merely eliminates traits\nwhile doing nothing to create new ones; the latter phenomenon is the\nresult of mutation. Proponents of the creative view see natural\nselection as a creative force that makes probable combinations of\nmutations that are necessary for the development of at least some\ntraits. While Razeto-Barry and Frick grant that natural selection\ncannot explain the origin of traits that arise by a single mutation,\nthey argue that it can explain the occurrence of sequences of\nphenotypic changes that would otherwise be wildly unlikely to occur\nwithout selection operating to cause the spread of the changes prior\nto the final one in the sequence. Additionally, it is disputed whether\nnatural selection can explain why an arbitrary individual has the\ntraits it has (Walsh 1998; Pust 2004; Birch 2012). On the positive\nview, selection affects the identity of individual organisms, and it\nis part of the identity of an individual to have been produced by the\nparents that produced it, so natural selection explains why\nindividuals have the traits they do. On the negative view, the\nexplanatory scope of natural selection is limited to population level\nproperties. Razeto-Barry and Frick further consider the question of\nwhether natural selection can explain the existence of individuals,\nultimately arguing against it.\n",
