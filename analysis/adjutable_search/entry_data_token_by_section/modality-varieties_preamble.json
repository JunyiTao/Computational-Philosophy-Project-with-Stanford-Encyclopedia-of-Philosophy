    "main_text": "\n\nModal statements tell us something about what could be or must be the\ncase. Such claims can come in many forms. Consider:\n\nNo one can be both a bachelor and married. (\u2018Bachelor\u2019\nmeans \u2018unmarried man\u2019.)\nYou could not have been born of different parents.\n(Someone born of different parents wouldn\u2019t be you.)\nNothing can travel faster than light. (It\u2019s a law of\nnature.)\nOne cannot get from London to New York in less than one hour.\n(Planes that fast haven\u2019t been built yet.)\nYou cannot leave the palace. (The doors are locked.)\nYou cannot promise to come and then stay at home. (It\u2019s\nwrong.)\nYou cannot start a job application cover letter with \u201chey\nguys\u201d. (It\u2019s just not done.) \nYou cannot castle if your king is in check. (It\u2019s against\nthe rules.)\nYou cannot deduct your holidays from your taxes. (It\u2019s\nagainst the law.)\nFred cannot be the killer. (The evidence shows that he\u2019s\ninnocent.)\n\n\nEach of these claims appears to have a true reading. But it also seems\nthat \u2018cannot\u2019 needs to be interpreted in different ways to\nmake the different sentences true. For one thing, we can, in the same\nbreath, accept a modal claim in one of the senses illustrated by\n(1)\u2013(10) while rejecting it in another one of these senses, as\nin the following dialogue:\n\nCaesar:\n You\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m still here. The doors were\nunlocked. I could have left the palace.\nCleopatra:\n True. But then again, you couldn\u2019t have left the\npalace. That would have been wrong, given that you promised to meet me\nhere.\n\n\nMoreover, the modal claims (1)\u2013(10) appear to be true for\ncompletely different reasons. For example, it may be held that the\ntruth of (1) is due to the meanings of its constituent expressions;\nthat (2) holds because it lies in your nature to be born of your\nactual parents; that (3) is true because the laws of nature preclude\nsuperluminal motion; that (4) holds because of technological\nlimitations; that (5) owes its truth to the presence of insurmountable\npractical obstacles; that (6)\u2013(9) are made true by the demands\nof morality, etiquette, the rules of chess, and the law respectively;\nand that (10) holds because the known facts prove Fred\u2019s\ninnocence.\n\nIt is one of the tasks of a philosophical theory of modality to give a\nsystematic and unified account of this multiplicity of modal concepts.\nThis article discusses a few of the main issues that need to be\naddressed by anyone pursuing this goal. Sections 1 and 2 concern the\nquestion of what fundamental categories of modal notions there are.\nThe focus will be on two contemporary debates: whether there are\nseparate forms of modality that are tied to the epistemic and the\nmetaphysical domains (section 1), and whether there is a special kind\nof necessity associated with the laws of nature (section 2). Section 3\ndiscusses questions about the relations between different notions of\nnecessity. Can some of them be reduced to other, more fundamental\nones? If so, which concepts of necessity are the most fundamental\nones? And if there are several fundamental kinds of necessity, what do\nthey have in common that makes them all kinds of necessity?\n",
