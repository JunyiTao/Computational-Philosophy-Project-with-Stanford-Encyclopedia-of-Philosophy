    "main_text": "A New Law of Thought || Identity Propositions and Significant Assertion\n2.2 Identity Propositions and Significant Assertion\n\nThe distinction between the intension (or connotation) and extension\n(or denotation) of names, which traces back to the\n Port Royal Logic,\n was widely acknowledged by nineteenth century logicians. But the\ndistinction was applied, as a rule, to general names, not\nproper names. With regard to proper names, logicians\ngenerally sided with John Stuart Mill in holding that they lack\nconnotation. Keynes, for example, writes that proper names are\n\u201cnon-connotative\u201d\u2014that is, \u201ctheir application\nis not determined by a conventionally assigned set of\nattributes\u201d (Keynes 1906, 42).\n\nJones\u2019s \u201cNew Law of Thought\u201d\u2014the law of\nsignificant assertion\u2014incorporates the distinction as\nfollows.\n\nThe Law of Significant Assertion:\n\nAny Subject of Predication is an identity of denotation in diversity\nof intension. (Jones 1910\u201311, 169; 1911b, 2)\n\n\nThe general idea is quite straightforward and will have a familiar\nring to anyone acquainted with Frege\u2019s sense-reference\ndistinction (or Russell\u2019s pre-\u201cOn Denoting\u201d\ndistinction between meaning and denotation), even if the formulation\nis slightly clumsy: when we predicate a property of an individual or\ncollection x, we first identify x via an intension\nf and then assert its identity with an individual or\ncollection y, where y is itself identified via a\ndistinct intension, g. We thus combine \u201cidentity of\ndenotation\u201d or \u201cdenotational oneness\u201d with\n\u201cdiversity of intension\u201d. As she puts it as early as 1893,\n\u201cthe very essence of Categorical statements\u2026 is the\nreference (in affirmatives) of two terms to one object, in such a way\nas to indicate that the object (or group) pointed out by the one term\nhas also the characteristics signified by the other\u2026\u201d\n(1893a, 219). Or, as Stout writes in his Preface to Jones (1911b),\n\u201cevery affirmative proposition asserts, and every negative\nproposition denies, the union of different attributes within the unity\nof the same thing\u201d (Stout 1911, v).\n\nAs noted, Jones\u2019s conception of logical form is austere: every\npositive proposition asserts an identity. Accordingly, she takes the\nterms of all F is G to be the quantifier phrase all\nF and the predicate G. (\u201cI understand the\nterms to include the whole of any proposition except\nthe copula\u201d [1893\u201394, 36].) This departs from the\nthen-standard view, which distinguishes, in addition to the copula,\nsubject term (F), predicate term (G) and quantifier\nor \u201cterm indicator\u201d (all). The quantifier, she\nalso notes, is optional, citing \u2018Cicero is Tully\u2019 as a\ncase of an identity proposition in which it is absent (1890, 5).\n\nThere are thus only two forms that can properly be referred to as\nlogical forms for Jones\u2014identities and their negations.\nWhile Jones holds that S is P asserts an \u201cidentity of\ndenotation\u201d in \u201cdiversity of intension\u201d, S\nis not P asserts \u201cdifference of denotation\u201d in\n\u201cintensional diversity\u201d. (Even if one accepts the former\nanalysis, however, the latter is problematic. As Augusta Klein (1911)\nnotes, for a statement of the form S is not P to be\ninformative, more is required than the mere \u201cintensional\ndiversity\u201d of S and P. To see this note that,\nwhile \u2018Horses are not house plants\u2019 gives us a case of\n\u201cdifference of denotation\u201d in \u201cintensional diversity\u201d, it is\nno more informative than \u2018Horses are horses.\u2019 For Klein,\nthe intensions must overlap to a significant degree for the claim of\ntheir diversity to have any cognitive value.)\n\nJones thus solves a problem that must be faced by anyone espousing the\nview that predication is, at root, identity. If assertively uttering a\nsentence exemplifying \u2018S is P\u2019 is\nconstrued as asserting a proposition that A is\nA, then we fail to capture the point of the assertion. The\nassertion appears significant and informative; yet the content is\ntrifling\u2014something about which we can hardly be\n\u201cinformed\u201d. If we take the general form of assertion to be\nan informative identity\u2014to be \u201can identity of denotation\nin diversity of intension\u201d\u2014then the problem disappears.\nThe solution, of course, applies to the cases that interested\nFrege\u2014sentences that are explicitly of the form A =\nA. Indeed, Jones\u2019s proposal here is in rough outline that\nof Frege (1892). (See the entry on\n Frege\u2014in\n particular, the section\n Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language.)\n \n\nIt is worth remarking, however, that Jones\u2019s label \u201ca new\nlaw of thought\u201d is somewhat misleading. In the nineteenth\ncentury, the laws of thought were commonly understood to be the\nfollowing: the law of identity, the law of\nnon-contradiction, and the law of excluded middle. These\nare all easily statable in a first-order language. But Jones does not\nstate a new firs-order law, in addition to these three; nor does she\nexplain how the new \u201claw\u201d can supplant the law of\nidentity. \n\nWhat then is the status of her law, vis-\u00e0-vis the\nother laws? The following passage provides some help:\n\nIf we genuinely accept A is A as the expression of a\nfundamental and primary logical principle, the difficulty is, how\ntheoretically to get beyond it. If we reject it, what we need, and\nwhat we find, to put in its place, is a principle of significant\nassertion of the form S is P. The laws of\ncontradiction and excluded middle are laws of the relations of\nassertions, and they cannot be expressed in satisfactory and\nunambiguous form without the use of S is P,\nS is not P, propositions. So even for them we\nrequire a prior principle, explaining and justifying the S is\nP proposition itself. Such a logical principle, based on\na new analysis of S is P, I think I can provide.\n(1911b, 10\u201311; emphasis added)\n\n\nFor Jones, the laws of contradiction and excluded middle apply\nexclusively to contentful assertions. Jones\u2019s worry is that the\nconception of content inherited from Lotze, on which S is P\nis, effectively, A is A, is a poor model not only for\nordinary assertions, but also of instances of the laws of\ncontradiction and excluded middle. These laws tell us, respectively,\nthat it cannot be the case, for example, both that Socrates\nis mortal and that he is not, and that it must be the case that\neither Socrates is mortal or he is not. In short, they tell\nus, of a significant assertion \u03a6, that either \u03a6 or its\nnegation obtains, and that \u03a6 and its negation cannot both obtain.\n\n\nAlthough Jones calls her law a \u201cprior principle\u201d, this\ndoes not mean that she takes her law to be logically prior to\nthe other laws. These other laws provide us with logical forms that\ncannot have false instances. Jones\u2019s law does something else: it\nplaces a constraint on significant assertion, whether true or false,\ntelling us what conditions an assertion has to meet for it to be a\nsignificant instance, not only of identity, but also of contradiction\nand excluded middle. \n",
