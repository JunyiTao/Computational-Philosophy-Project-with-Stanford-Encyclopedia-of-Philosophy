    "main_text": "Russell versus Moore: Two Kinds of Consequentialism\n4. Russell versus Moore: Two Kinds of Consequentialism\n\nAlthough Russell became a convert to the doctrines of Principia\nEthica, he disagreed with Moore on two important points. Russell,\nlike Moore was what is nowadays known as a consequentialist. He\nbelieved that the rightness or otherwise of an act is \u201cin some\nway, dependent on consequences\u201d. But for the young Moore, it is\n\u201cdemonstrably certain\u201d (!) that \u201cI am morally bound\nto perform this action\u201d is identical [that is\nsynonymous] with the assertion \u201cThis action will produce the\ngreatest amount of possible good in the Universe\u201d (PE:\nch. 5, \u00a789). Thus it is analytic that the right thing to\ndo is the action that will, actually produce the best\nconsequences. But in Russell\u2019s view this claim is neither analytic nor\ntrue. Moore\u2019s own Open Question Argument can be deployed to prove that\nit is not analytic, and a little critical reflection reveals that it\nis not true.\n\n\nIt is held [by Moore] that what we ought to do is that action, among\nall that are possible, which will produce the best results on the\nwhole; and this is regarded as constituting a definition of\nought. I hold that this is not a definition, but a\nsignificant proposition, and in fact a false one. (RoE:\n101/Papers 4: 573)\n\n\nIt is a \u201csignificant\u201d or non-analytic proposition because\na competent speaker can believe that X is the act that will\nproduce the best consequences without believing that she ought to do\nit. If the two propositions \u201cX is the act available to me\nthat will produce the best consequences\u201d and \u201cI ought to\ndo X\u201d were really synonymous, then a competent\nspeaker could not believe the one whilst remaining in doubt about the\nother. Since this is perfectly possible (as is shown by the fact that\n\u201cOught I to do what will have the best results?\u201d is an\nobstinately open question for competent speakers of English) the two\nclaims are not synonymous. (W.D. Ross developed a similar line of\nargument in The Right and the Good (1930) but it was Russell\nwho convinced Moore that he was wrong. See Moore 1942: 558).\n\nBut the fact that these claims are not synonymous does not show that\nit is false that I ought to do that act which will, in\nfact, produce the best consequences. The latter claim could be\nsynthetic (or, as Russell would have it, \u201csignificant\u201d)\nbut true. Why does Russell think it false? Russell raises the ad\nhominem objection that Moore\u2019s thesis is flatly inconsistent with\nthe moral conservatism that he goes on to embrace. According to Moore,\nalthough \u201cthere are cases where [an established moral] rule\nshould be broken\u201d, since \u201cin some cases the neglect of an\nestablished moral rule will be the best course of action\npossible\u201d, nevertheless, \u201cwe can never know what those\ncases are, and ought, therefore, never to break it\u201d\n(PE: \u00a799). \u201cThe individual, therefore, can be\nconfidently recommended always to conform to rules which are\ngenerally useful and generally practiced.\u201d But if we ought to\nperform the best action possible, what this implies is that there are\nsome cases (though we can never know which) where we ought to do what\nit is not the case that we ought to do. Moore could avoid this\ncontradiction by adopting the view that what we ought to do is that\naction which we have reason to believe will produce the best\nconsequences. As Russell himself put it, Moore\u2019s moral conservatism\n\u201cimplies that we ought to do what we have reason to\nthink will have the best results, rather than what really\nwill have the best results\u201d [my italics]\u2014since,\nin any given instance, we may have reason to think that the\nconventionally right act will have the best consequences even though\nwe know that this won\u2019t always be the case.\n\nBut Russell did not reject Moore\u2019s brand of consequentialism because\nit was inconsistent with his moral conservatism, since he\nalso rejected Moore\u2019s moral conservatism. As he informed\nMoore by letter, he regarded his views on Practical Ethics as\n\u201cunduly Conservative and anti-reforming\u201d. However, anybody\nwho thinks that there are some actions which we ought to do\neven though, as a matter of fact they won\u2019t have the best consequences\nmust, reject Moore\u2019s view. And it is precisely because he believes\nthis that Russell rejects Moore\u2019s brand of consequentialism.\n\u201cSome people\u201d, says Russell, \u201cwhom I refrain from\nnaming, might with advantage to the world have been strangled in\ninfancy; but we cannot blame the good women who brought them up for\nhaving omitted this precaution.\u201d So if Stalin\u2019s mother (say) did\nthe right thing in not strangling him at birth, then it\nfollows that the right thing to do is not always the act with the best\nactual consequences. Russell admits that his view is not without\nparadox, since if it sometimes right to do what is actually\ndisastrous, it follows that it can sometimes be \u201ca pity [that] a\nman did his duty\u201d, a thesis which Moore regards as \u201ca\ncontradiction in terms\u201d. But paradoxical as this may seem, it is\nonly a contradiction on the assumption that \u201cthe right\naction\u201d simply means \u201cthe action with the best\nactual consequences\u201d, an assumption which Moore\u2019s own Open\nQuestion Argument proves to be false. Moore\u2019s view, by contrast, is\ncontradictory however \u201cright\u201d and \u201cought\u201d are\nto be defined, since it implies that we sometimes ought to perform\nacts which (since they are not optimific) it is not the case that we\nought to perform.\n\nRussell\u2019s criticisms can be summed up as follows:\n\nIt is false that \u201cI am morally bound/I ought/it is right for\nme to perform this action\u201d is synonymous with the\nassertion \u201cThis action will produce the greatest amount of\npossible good in the Universe\u201d, since the Open Question Argument\ncan be deployed mutatis mutandis to prove otherwise.\nMoore subscribes to three theses that are flat-out contradictory:\n\n\nWe ought to perform those acts that will in fact produce the best\nconsequences.\nFollowing established rules does not always result in acts that\nproduce the best consequences.\nWe ought to follow the established rules.\n\n\nThese three theses jointly imply that we sometimes ought to do things\nthat it is not the case that we ought to do. Russell gently points out\nthis contradiction and suggests, in effect, that Moore could resolve\nit by modifying (1) to (1\u2032).\n\n1\u2032.\nWe ought to perform those acts which it is reasonable to\nbelieve will produce the best consequences.\n \nThe \u201cgood women\u201d who brought up the likes of Hitler\nand Stalin cannot be blamed for not strangling them in infancy. This\nsuggests that it was right of them to refrain even though the actual\nconsequences of their acts of forbearance turned out to be horrendous.\nThus the right thing to do is not that act which will\nactually produce the best consequences but that act which it\nis reasonable to believe will produce the best\nconsequences.\n\n\nMoore accepted argument A (see his \u201cReply to My Critics\u201d:\n558), and in his later book Ethics (1912) he treats\nconsequentialism as a synthetic thesis.\n\n\nIt is, I think, quite plain that the meaning of the two words\n[\u201cexpedience\u201d and \u201cduty\u201d] is not the\nsame; for if it were, then it would be a mere tautology to say that it\nis always our duty to do what will have the best possible\nconsequences. Our theory does not, therefore, do away with the\ndistinction between the meaning of the two words\n\u201cduty\u201d and \u201cexpediency\u201d; it only implies that\nboth will always apply to the same actions. (Ethics: 89)\n\n\nHe also seems to have accepted Russell\u2019s ad hominem argument\nB\u2014that, given the fairly obvious fact that doing the done thing\ndoes not always produce the best results, his actualist brand of\nconsequentialism is inconsistent with his moral conservatism. However,\nhe did not resolve the problem by modifying thesis (1) as Russell, in\neffect, recommended\u2014instead he resolved it by dropping thesis\n(3). In Principia, moral conservatism had been\n\u201cconfidently recommended\u201d to the conscientious\n\u201cindividual\u201d. By the time Moore came to write\nEthics in 1912 it had simply disappeared, leaving the puzzled\n\u201cindividual\u201d bereft of practical guidance. What ought the\nindividual to do, when, as is usually the case, she cannot determine,\nwhich of the available acts will have the best total consequences?\nMoore does not say, thereby sacrificing helpfulness to theoretical\nconsistency.\n",
