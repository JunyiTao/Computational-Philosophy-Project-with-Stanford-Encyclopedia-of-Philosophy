One of the causal\ntransactions that then follow can be described thus: Lisa removed her\nhand from the stove because she felt pain. This is a\ndescription which seems to pick out \u2018being in pain\u2019 as one\ncausally relevant property of the cause. That \u2018being in\npain\u2019 is a causally relevant property accords well with\nour intuitions. However, to say it is leads to trouble. The reason for\nthis is that mental properties, like that of \u2018being in\npain\u2019, can be realized by physically very different systems.\nTherefore, mental properties cannot be identified with\nphysical ones. On the other hand, we seem to live in a physically\nclosed and causally non-overdetermined universe. But this means that,\ncontrary to what we have supposed so far, Lisa did not remove her hand\nbecause she felt pain. In general, it means that mental properties are\nnot causally relevant, however much they seem to be (cf. Kim\n1989 for a famous expression of this problem).\n\nIf properties are tropes, some trope theorists have proposed, this\nconclusion can be resisted (cf. Robb 1997; Martin and Heil\n1999; Heil and Robb 2003; for a hybrid version cf. Nanay\n2009; cf. also Gozzano and Orilia 2008). To see this, we need\nfirst to disambiguate our notion of a property. This notion, it is\nargued, is really two notions, namely:\n\nProperty1 = that which imparts on an individual thing\nits particular nature (property as token), and\nProperty2 = that which makes distinct things the same\n(property as type).\n\n\nOnce \u2018property\u2019 has been disambiguated, we can see how\nmental properties can be causally relevant after all. For now, if\nmental properties1 are tropes, they can be identified with\nphysical properties1. Mental properties2 can\nstill be distinguished from physical properties2, for\nproperties considered as types are\u2014in line with the\nstandard view of tropes\u2014identified with similarity classes\nof tropes. When Lisa removes her hand from the stove because she\nfeels pain, therefore, she removes her hand in virtue of\nsomething that is partly characterized by a trope which is such that\nit belongs to a class of mentally similar tropes. This trope is\nidentical with a physical trope\u2014it is both mental and\nphysical\u2014because it also belongs to a (distinct)\nsimilarity class of physically similar tropes. Therefore, mental\nproperties can be causally relevant in spite of the fact that the\nmental is multiply realizable by the physical, and in spite of the\nfact that we live in a physically closed and non-overdetermined\nuniverse.\n\nThis suggestion has been criticized. According to Paul Noordhof (1998:\n223) it fails because it does not respect the \u201cbulge in the\ncarpet constraint\u201d. For now the question which was ambiguously\nasked about properties, can be unambiguously asked about tropes: is it\nin virtue of being mental or in virtue of being physical that the\ntrope is causally relevant for the effect (for a response,\ncf. Robb 2001 and Ehring 2003)? And Sophie Gibb (2004) has\ncomplained that the trope\u2019s simple and primitive nature makes it\nunsuitable for membership in two such radically different classes as\nthat of the mentally and of the physically similar tropes,\nrespectively (for more reasons against the suggestion cf.\nMacdonald and Macdonald 2006 and Zhang 2021).\n",
