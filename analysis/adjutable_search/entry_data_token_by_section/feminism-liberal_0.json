    "main_text": "Egalitarian-Liberal Feminism\n1. Egalitarian-Liberal Feminism\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminism conceives of freedom as personal autonomy\n(living a life of one\u2019s own choosing) and political autonomy\n(being co-author of the conditions under which one lives).\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists hold that the exercise of personal\nautonomy depends on certain enabling conditions that are\ninsufficiently present in women\u2019s lives or that social and\ninstitutional arrangements often fail to respect women\u2019s\npersonal autonomy and other elements of women\u2019s flourishing.\nThey hold also that women\u2019s needs and interests are\ninsufficiently reflected in the basic conditions under which they live\nand that basic arrangements that perpetuate those conditions lack\nlegitimacy because women are inadequately represented in the processes\nof democratic self-determination. Egalitarian-liberal feminists link\nautonomy deficits like these to the \u201cgender system\u201d (Okin\n1989: 89), that is, inherited patriarchal traditions and institutions,\nand they hold that the women\u2019s movement should work to identify\nand remedy them. As the protection and promotion of citizens\u2019\nautonomy is an appropriate role of the state on the\negalitarian-liberal view, egalitarian-liberal feminists hold that the\nstate can and should be the women\u2019s movement\u2019s ally in\npromoting women\u2019s autonomy. There is disagreement among\negalitarian-liberal feminists, however, about the role of personal\nautonomy in the good life, the appropriate role of the state, and how\negalitarian-liberal feminism is to be justified.\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists draw from the broad tradition of\nfeminist theorizing for insight concerning the gender system. For\nexample, some draw on radical feminist insights into the nature of\nviolence against women (Nussbaum 1999a) and the nature of gender\nhierarchy (Watson 2019); some draw on psychoanalytic feminist theory\n(Meyers 2002, Cornell 2003); some draw on feminist work on caregiving\n(Bhandary 2019); and some draw on socialist feminist thinking about\nthe exploitation of women\u2019s work in the home (Gheaus 2008).\nContemporary egalitarian-liberal feminism may be understood as a\ncontribution to the larger scholarly philosophical conversation\nconcerning egalitarian-liberalism. Since John Rawls\u2019s work\n(1971, 1993, 2001) has played a very large role in that conversation\nover the past 50 years, it figures centrally in much\negalitarian-liberal feminist philosophy.\n",
