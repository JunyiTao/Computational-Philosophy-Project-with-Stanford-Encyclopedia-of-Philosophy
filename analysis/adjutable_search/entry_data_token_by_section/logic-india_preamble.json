Preoccupation with the nature of reason and\nargument occurs in the earliest philosophical texts, where their\ntreatment is intimately connected with questions of ontology,\nepistemology and dialectics. These questions continued to be at the\ncenter of philosophical discussion through the classical and medieval\nperiod of Indian philosophy. This article will chronicle the answers\nIndian philosophers gave to these questions during the preclassical\nand classical period.\n",
