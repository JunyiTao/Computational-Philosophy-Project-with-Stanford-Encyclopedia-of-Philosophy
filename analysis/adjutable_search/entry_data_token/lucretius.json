Lucretius\u2019 rendering of technical\nGreek prose into Latin verse, combined with the encyclopedic scope of\nthe work, was a pioneering accomplishment in Latin literature, a\ncontender for the most ambitious poem ever written. The DRN\nis complete but probably lacking its final revision. Allowing for some\nabridgments and simplifications, Lucretius reproduces Epicurean\ndoctrine faithfully. He provides us with our most detailed account of\nthe foundations of Epicurean atomism, and he is our sole Epicurean\nsource for the doctrine of the atomic \u2018swerve.\u2019 In the\nmore poetic openings of the individual books, he expresses his\ndevotion to Epicurus and his confidence in Epicureanism as the path to\nhappiness. The DRN is a nearly unique survival from antiquity\nof the anti-teleological and anti-providential materialist outlook.\nAmong its philosophical highlights are: the scientific image of atoms\nas motes of dust in a sunbeam, and the denial of most phenomenal\nproperties, including color, to the atoms themselves, both in book 2;\nthe treatment of the fear of death in book 3; the criticism of\nteleological explanations of nature, from cosmic design down to body\nparts, in books 4 and 5; and, from book 5, the humanistic explanation\nof the origins of religion.\n", "toc": [{"#Life": "1.

Life\n\nWe know little about Lucretius\u2019 life beyond what we can infer\nfrom his work. Our sole external reference comes from Cicero, in a\nletter to his brother Quintus serving with Caesar in Gaul, dated from\nFebruary 54 BCE (Q.F. 2.10.3). Cicero agrees with his\nbrother\u2019s praise of the work, noting that it displays both\nbrilliance and originality, but also considerable craftsmanship.\nAlthough Cicero and his brother may have read an earlier or partial\ndraft, such a date for the poem we have is compatible with two main\ninternal indicators.\n\nFirst is the poem\u2019s addressee, the Roman aristocrat, Memmius,\nnamed only in books 1, 2 and 5. While doubts are possible as to which\nmember of the Memmii Lucretius so honoured, most likely he is C.\nMemmius, the praetor of 58 BCE, governor of Bithynia in 57, where the\npoets Catullus and Cinna served on his staff, and who was exiled in 52\nBCE as the result of an electoral scandal. The story, attested in\nother letters of Cicero, that Memmius had plans to build on the site\nof Epicurus\u2019 house (in Melite, not the Garden itself), has\nsometimes been taken as spite from a failed attempt at conversion, but\nit makes more sense as an offer of patronage by an Epicurean-Roman\ngrandee that fell afoul of local sensitivities (Morgan and Taylor\n2017). The friendship with Memmius to which Lucretius aspires\n(DRN 1.141) need not imply equal status for Lucretius but is\nalso compatible with a patronage relation. The second indicator is\nLucretius\u2019 mention at DRN 1.41 of the current age as\n\u2018this troubled time for our country\u2019. The standard view,\nthat this relates to the early 50s was challenged by Hutchinson\n(2001), who argued for 49\u201348 BCE, but for a rejoinder see Volk\n(2010). Krebs (2013), in support of the earlier date, shows some\npossible Lucretian influence on Caesar\u2019s vocabulary in his\nCommentaries on the Gallic War.\n\nLater biographical material contains a few plausible elements but is\notherwise unreliable. Donatus\u2019 life of Vergil claims that\nLucretius died on 15th October 53 BCE, the same day Vergil reached\nmanhood (donned his toga virilis). The date is possible, but\nthe coincidence is obviously a passing of the poetic torch. Jerome\ngives his birth as 94 BCE and his death at age 44 or 39 (uncertain\ntext; 39 best matches other evidence), but then relates a bizarre\nstory that Lucretius was driven mad by a love potion and composed the\nDRN during the \u2018intervals of sanity\u2019 before he\ncommitted suicide. Thereafter Cicero edited or prepared the poem for\npublication. That the love philtre was administered by his wife is not\nin Jerome but turns up in medieval sources. Much of this is hard to\ntake at face value (Holford-Strevens 2002). Cicero\u2019s involvement\nin the initial diffusion, as opposed to editing of the DRN,\nis just possible, but he never mentions it in his later philosophical\nworks. Otherwise, Jerome\u2019s tale of madness does not square with\nthe earliest reception of the DRN, the high esteem shown\nLucretius in Vergil, Horace, Ovid and beyond.\n\nTo consider only the first of these, his influence on his younger\ncontemporary Vergil (70\u201319 BCE) was central. Vergil\u2019s\nadmiration is made quasi explicit in the poetic blessing at\nGeorgics 2.490\u201392: \u2018Happy he who was able to know\nthe causes of things and crushed underfoot all fear, inexorable fate,\nand the harsh roar of greedy hell\u2019. In specifying the basis for\nthis happiness, \u2018knowing the causes of things\u2019, Vergil\nevokes Lucretius\u2019 title (rerum causas suggests\nrerum natura), yet also connects this universal knowledge to\nits practical aim: the banishment of fears of all kinds, including\nliberation from fatalism (the swerve) and the fear of death and the\nafterlife (Book 3). Peace of mind in the here and now, Greek\nataraxia, achieved through the study of Epicurean, atomic\nphysics, was the formal, therapeutic goal of Epicureanism.\nVergil\u2019s evocation thus knowingly sums up some of the\nDRN\u2019s key themes, and flatteringly conflates\nLucretius\u2019 poetic accomplishments with the wisdom of Epicurus\nhimself \u2014flatteringly because in doctrinal matters Lucretius\nonly depicts himself as following his master. More importantly, the\nbeatitude Vergil attributes to him is hardly compatible with, and more\nthan enough to dispel, Jerome\u2019s suicidal madman.\n\nLucretius\u2019 insanity and miserable end in Jerome seem rather\nmotivated by early Christian hostility to the Epicurean denial of\nprovidence (Lactantius, sometimes using Lucretius as a source for\nEpicureanism, calls him \u2018mad\u2019), perhaps overlaid upon some\nnow-lost poetic-fictional retribution for Lucretius\u2019 attack on\nerotic love in the concluding sections of book 4, although that is\nonly a guess. But even if our sole biographical source is not\ncredible, its chronology remains compatible with our other\ninformation, that is, a life span ranging from the mid-90s to mid-50s\nBCE. Perhaps one last nugget of plausibility among the biographical\ndross is that a premature death, as opposed to suicide, does seem\nconsistent with the unfinished status of the DRN.\n2. The poem\u2019s structure and lack of final revision\n\nThe six books of the DRN display a clear architectural\ndesign:\n\nAtoms and void as the sole permanent entities\nAtomic motion and atomic shapes; the properties of compounds\nThe nature and mortality of soul; curing the fear of death\nActivities of the soul: sensation and thought, volition, dreams\nand emotions\nOur world: cosmology, origins of life, and history of\ncivilisation\nMeteorological and terrestrial phenomena\n\n\nThe most obvious feature is the progression in scale of the\nsubject-matter, in two-book increments. We start with the atomic level\nin books 1\u20132, move to the human scale in books 3 and 4, and then\nonto the cosmic in 5\u20136. Between each of the three pairs the\nfirst book concentrates on the nature or permanent properties of the\nsubject, while the second depicts its powers and activity, the subject\nin action. Only the atoms, however, are indestructible and thus\neverlasting. All generated entities, from our souls to the cosmos, are\ncompounds and so transient and destructible (on gods see section 7\nbelow).\n\nA second structuring feature is the direction given by the themes of\nbirth and death. The opening hymn to Roman Venus features a spring\nscene of birth and joy, nature at her most benign and nurturing, while\nbooks 3 and 6 close on the theme of death. Book 3 argues for the\nmortality of the soul, and its final sections seek to remove the fear\nof death, while Book 6 ends with a dark and horrible portrayal of mass\ndeath adapted from Thucydides\u2019 account of the Athenian plague in\n430\u2013426 BCE. A balance between the two halves of the work is\nalso marked out by the one and only mention of Epicurus by name in the\nwhole DRN, at 3.1042. This unique direct mention is already\nconspicuous, but its position at the end of book 3, at the very core\nof the poem, gives it more prominence.\n\nSuch large-scale symmetries show careful poetic design. At the same\ntime, there are a number of indications that the DRN is\nlacking its final revision. The strongest sign of this is a passage\nfrom the opening of Book 4. Lines 4.45\u201353 recap the contents of\nbooks 1 and 2 and then announce as the next subject\nsimulacra, Lucretius\u2019 renderings of the\neidola, the thin film of images constantly shed by all solid\nobjects, whose stream is the object of vision. These are indeed\ntreated next but, oddly 4.45\u201353 make no mention of the soul, the\ntopic of book 3. Worse, the lines follow another programmatic passage,\n4.26\u201344 also introducing the simulacra, but now given\nas the sequel to the discussion of soul. Together the two passages\nshow that 4.45\u201353 are a left-over from an earlier draft. This\nrelative imperfection, however, is also precious evidence for the\ndevelopment of the work. As pointed out long ago (Mewaldt 1908), it is\nevidence of a change of plan: at some point books 3 and 4 were\ninterchanged. Interestingly, this first ordering of the material\nagrees with the order of exposition in Epicurus\u2019s Letter to\nHerodotus.\n\nA number of other features are less conclusive, but also suggest that\na final revision was never executed. First, Books 1 to 3 as a group\nare shorter and more polished than 4 to 6. Second, the recurrence of\nthe vital honey and woodworm passage from book 1 at the opening of\nbook 4, with minor variations (1.926\u2013950 = 4.1\u201325) is\nawkward. Some suspect that the book 4 version was slated for\nreplacement, though some defend it. Third is the promise at 5.155 to\ndiscuss the abodes of the gods at some length (largo\nsermone), never taken up. Two final considerations, though\ninconclusive, also deserve mention. For some, the ending of book 6 as\nwe have it is too bleak and lacking its moral, but others think it\nadequate as a closure, the readers being by then sufficiently\ninstructed to draw the moral themselves. Lastly, the proems of books 1\nto 3 appear to form an integrated pattern. The proems of 1 to 3 appear\nto mark out degrees of cosmic ascent as equivalent to degrees of\nEpicurean initiation: book 1 celebrates Venus/pleasure here on earth;\nthe second proem locates readers among \u2018the lofty sanctuaries of\nthe wise\u2019 (2.8), now free from the struggles of the\nunenlightened; the third proem raises us all the way to the level of\ngods (3.15\u201330), as if outside the cosmos. After that, however,\nthe pattern is harder to discern.]\n3. Poetic format\n\nLucretius writes in Latin verse to spread the gospel of Epicurus, who\nwrote in Greek prose two and a half centuries before him. A\npreliminary review may best allow us to consider how Lucretius\nadapted Epicurus\u2019 message to his own poetic medium and Roman\nworld. The present section covers poetic format, the next the\nEpicurean background and sources. Some readers may prefer to skip\ndirectly to section 5 on the contents of the DRN and read the\nnext two sections once they are more familiar with the poem.\n\nLucretius expounds his master\u2019s message in Latin hexameter,\nadapting the inherited genre of didactic epic. Greek didactic epic,\nwhich starts with Hesiod, standardly features a teacher offering\n(fictional) live instruction on a given field of knowledge to a\nstudent or addressee in need of such instruction. This continues to be\nstandard in Latin didactic (Volk 2002). In the DRN, Memmius,\nstanding in for the audience, is depicted as a beginner, which may not\nhave been the case. Lucretius is not the doctrinal, much less the\ndivine authority of the DRN \u2013that is Epicurus, on both\ncounts\u2013 but he does actively instruct.\n\nAs his main Latin poetic influence, Lucretius adopts the archaic\nformat and diction of Ennius (239 \u2013169 BCE), whose epic the\nAnnales on the history of Rome in 18 books, now known only\nfrom fragments, was the Roman national epic until displaced by the\nAeneid. Couching his revolutionary message in this\nestablished format may have helped Lucretius make it more acceptable\nto his Roman audience and simultaneously prompt them to reflect\ncritically on traditional Roman values (Nethercut 2021). A second\nimportant Latin influence appears to have been Cicero\u2019s\nAratea of c. 89 BCE, the orator\u2019s youthful rendering in\nLatin verse of the first part of the Phaenomena by the\nHellenistic Greek poet Aratus (Gee 2013 chapters 3 and 4, and appendix\nB for full parallels). The Phaenomena, published c. 276 BCE,\nis a work on astronomy and weather-signs. As was widely recognised,\nmost of its subject-matter comes from the prose treatise of the same\nname by the fourth-century mathematician and scientist Eudoxus of\nCnidus. One of the more popular poems of antiquity, the\nPhaenomena was at the forefront of a trend in Hellenistic\ndidactic poetry, in which a poet could showcase his originality,\nlearnedness and virtuosity by taking on obscure or challenging\ntechnical subjects. For Lucretius, since unobservable atoms and void,\nthe most obscure topics possible (DRN 1.933 obscura de re),\nprovide the subject-matter of the DRN, and given that\nEpicurus wrote in a clear but often complex Greek prose saturated with\ntechnical terms, on these two criteria it makes sense to view him as\nan heir to the Hellenistic tradition of learned didactic (Kenney 1970,\nBrown 1982, Gale 2007). To be sure, when at 1.921\u201330 Lucretius\nadvertises his originality as the first Latin poet to attempt his\nsubject, he tells us that he does so, at least in part, for \u2018the\nhigh hope of renown\u2019. This is not necessarily incompatible with\nEpicureanism, though it hardly flows from it (on Epicurean poetics see\nsection 4). As for the challenge posed by Epicurean terminology,\nLucretius recognised it (1.136\u20139) and met it by opting, on the\nwhole, to avoid directly importing Greek technical terminology (Sedley\n1998 ch. 2).\n\nIn a more important respect, however, the framework of Hellenistic\ndidactic epic is less helpful if it implies that Lucretius merely\nused Epicureanism to generate some sublime poetry. On the\ncontrary, Lucretius\u2019 missionary fervour make it clear that the\nmedium serves the message and that the aim of the poem is to convert\nthe hearer to Epicureanism (Asmis 2016). This relation is most clearly\nset out in the important \u2018honey and wormwood\u2019 passage,\nfrom which I quote DRN 1.936\u201347:\n\nBut as with children, when physicians try to administer rank wormwood,\nthey first touch the rims about the cups with the sweet yellow fluid\nof honey, that unthinking childhood be deluded as far as the lips, and\nmeanwhile may drink up the bitter juice of the wormwood, and though\nbeguiled be not betrayed, but rather by such means be restored and\nregain health, so now do I: since this doctrine commonly seems\nsomewhat harsh to those who have not used it (haec ratio\nplerumque videtur/ tritior esse quibus non est tractata) and the\npeople shrink back from it, I have chosen to set forth our doctrine to\nyou in sweet-speaking Pierian song, and as it were to touch it with\nthe Muses\u2019 delicious honey\u2026 . (transl. Rouse-Smith with\nmodifications)\n\n\nPoetry sweetens the bitter medicine needed to restore the patient, so\nthat Lucretius subordinates his poetic activity, honey, to the cure\nand salvation that is instruction in Epicureanism (for more on the\npassage, Gale 2020). At the same time, this image of benevolent\ndeception is more complicated than it looks, since the medicine is not\nactually bitter, it only \u2018seems\u2019 so to those who have not\nexperienced it. Indeed, no later than the opening of Book 3, Lucretius\ndepicts himself as a bee flitting through Epicurus\u2019 works,\nfeasting on the honey of his \u2018golden words\u2019 (3.13, fuller\nquote in 4). The medicine has become the honey, it appears, at least\nfor those who have converted to Epicureanism.\n\nThe goal of philosophical conversion leads us to a last important\nGreek poetic influence, the philosopher-poet Empedocles of Acragas\n(490\u2013430 BCE). Lucretius singles Empedocles out for explicit\npraise at 1.729\u201333, even as he turns to criticize his elemental\ntheory from an atomist perspective. Empedocles was the father of Greek\nfour-element theories and was recognized as the canonical champion of\nGreek philosophical didactic poetry. Although we know his work only\nthrough fragments, the great number of identifiable allusions or\nborrowings in the DRN from Empedocles, along with the\nclustering of Empedoclean themes in the opening of Book 1, make it\nclear that Lucretius was positioning himself as the Roman Empedocles\n(Jobst 1907, Kranz 1944, Furley 1970, Sedley 1998, ch. 1).\nEmpedocles\u2019 goal was to convert the hearer to new\n\u2018scientific\u2019 understanding of the world. In one summing-up\npassage, he explains how all things (\u2018all that was, all that is,\nand all that will be hereafter\u2019, a Homeric formula he adapts to\nhis own aims) are to be understood as the products of the four eternal\nelements, earth, air, fire and water, acting under the alternating\ninfluence of two moving-psychological powers, Love and Hate (On\nnature 1.265\u201372 Laks Most 2016 D 73). This effectively\ndowngrades the world of experience to the rank of temporary products\nof a more fundamental, invariant principles. Despite other important\ndifferences, this is close enough to the atomist picture, both systems\nbeing attempts to save appearances from the Eleatic challenge\n(Mourelatos 1987; Wardie 1988; Burnyeat 2017). Empedocles was also\nwidely celebrated for his use of imagery. In particular, he pioneered\na new type of epic simile, one that displays multiple points of\ncorrespondence between a given biological process and\n\u2013usually\u2013 a technological analogue. Lucretius\u2019 own\ncareful use of imagery and poetic vividness owe much to Empedocles\n(West 1969, Schiesaro 1990, Garani 2007, Taylor 2020).\n\nSince 1998, the Strasbourg papyrus, eds. Martin and Primavesi, has\nshown that Empedocles\u2019 commitment to the afterlife of the soul\nmost likely stood alongside his scientific cosmology, not in\nopposition to it. Although scholarship has only begun to reckon with\nthis new factor, it appears to make the new Empedocles even more\nsuitable as a Lucretian model (for a sketch of how this might have\nworked, Tr\u00e9panier 2007). The clearest instance of this\ncrossover between science and religion is section d\nof the papyrus, where Empedocles loudly laments his meat-eating sins\neven as he turns to describe the origins of living creatures from the\nearth. This contrast in tones seems a plausible predecessor to\nLucretius\u2019 own two styles, the juxtaposition of cool technical\nsections with impassioned rhetorical passages. Next, if more\ncontroversially, the compresence in Empedocles of (Pythagorean?)\nreligion and Early Greek science suggests that the instruction itself\nwas framed as an \u2018assimilation to the divine\u2019. That is, the scientific\nquest for knowledge was understood as both natural and a form of\ndivinization for the pupil. This was an important theme in later\nphilosophy, Plato especially, but no less so in Epicureanism. In both\ncases it also requires redefining the concept of divinity against more\npopular inherited notions (see section 7).\n4. Epicurean background\n\nEpicurus (341\u2013270 BCE), an Athenian citizen, began teaching and\namassing disciples in Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos and then at\nLampsacus on the coast of Asia Minor before establishing his school in\nAthens in 306 BCE. In a property later known as the Garden, Epicurus\nand his friends lived a closed community life devoted to philosophy,\nin retreat from politics, and practiced an austere to ascetic\nlifestyle. The latter was the case despite Epicureans\u2019\ncommitment to hedonism (Tsouna, 2020). Outside accusations of hedonism\nwere thus strictly correct, but not sympathetic or informed. In\nAthens, alongside his collaborators Metrodorus (331\u2013278 BCE) and\nHermarchus, who succeeded him in 270 BCE, Epicurus continued to\nproduce instalments of his On nature, which eventually\ntotaled 37 volumes. The monumental On nature appears to have\nbeen the foundational text for Epicureanism, so much so that school\nmembers could make shorthand references among themselves to individual\nbook numbers, omitting the title (reconstruction in Sedley 1998 ch.\n4). Even so, it was only one of many works produced by Epicurus and\nthe first generation of Epicureans, collectively referred to by later\nEpicureans as \u2018the men\u2019 (Mitsis ed. 2020 has surveys\nof all aspects of Epicureanism; on the life of the school,\nsee ch. 1 by Dorandi)\n\nBy the late Hellenistic period, the Garden was one of the four main\nphilosophical systems that competed for the allegiance of the educated\nelite. Although all were originally headquartered in Athens, by the\nfirst century BCE the schools had representatives and active branches\nthroughout the Mediterranean. In first-century Italy, the Epicureans\nseems to have been especially successful in recruiting prominent\nRomans, for example Atticus the banker, Cicero\u2019s friend and\ncorrespondent, Cassius, the future assassin of Caesar, and\nCaesar\u2019s father-in-law L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. The last\nof these was closely associated with or more likely the patron of\nPhilodemus of Gadara (c. 110\u201330 BCE), a prominent Epicurean\nphilosopher and accomplished poet, who taught in the area of the Bay\nof Naples. The damaged and difficult-to-read carbonized papyrus rolls\nfirst recovered in the 18th century at the Villa dei Papiri\nin Herculaneum are to all appearances Philodemus\u2019 working\nlibrary. They include Philodemus\u2019 own philosophical works, some\ndrafts or teaching texts, a good number of classic Epicurean texts,\namong which books from the On nature, sometimes in multiple\ncopies, a number of standard works from rival schools, and even a few\nLatin manuscripts (Del Mastro 2014; Capasso 2020).\n\nThe Epicureans were noted for their doctrinal conservatism, with\northodoxy controlled by appeal to the textual authority of the works\nof \u2018the men\u2019 (Sedley 1989). Lucretius is in keeping with\nthis when he writes in the proem to book 3:\n\nYou I follow, O glory of the Graecian race, and now on the marks you\nhave left I plant my own footsteps firm, not so much desiring to be\nyour rival, as for love, because I yearn to copy you\u2026 You are\nour father, the discoverer of truths, you supply us a father\u2019s\nprecepts from your scrolls, from your pages, illustrious man, as bees\ndrink all they can in the flowery glades, so we likewise feed on your\ngolden words, golden, ever most worthy of life eternal. (3.3\u201313\nRouse-Smith transl. with modifications).\n\n\nAs noted above, his own reverence for and enjoyment of these Greek\nprose texts does not require the honey of poetic inducements, but to\nLucretius the Epicurean, they are all at once authoritative,\nbeneficial, and supremely enjoyable. It is worth noting, however, that\nthe order of comparisons made in the fuller passage, not quoted above,\nrely on established poetic tropes used when a minor poet invokes the\nexample of a master (Volk 2002: 108\u2013115). Lucretius therefore,\nin the act of affirming his faith in Epicurus the philosopher,\nretroactively casts Epicurus in the mold of a master poet. This shows\nan active capacity to shape and color the material.\n\nDespite such coloring, Lucretius makes it clear that he will not\ndeviate from his master\u2019s doctrinal path. Indeed, two of the\ngreatest peculiarities of the DRN relate directly to this\nfaithfulness. First, as best we can tell, Lucretius\u2019\npresentation of Epicurean physics is not \u2018live\u2019, in the\nsense that it makes no attempt to update or defend the Epicurean\nsystem in light of later scientific developments, for instance the\nvictory of \u2018head\u2019 over \u2018chest\u2019 as the seat of\nthe soul, thanks to the discovery of the nerves by Hellenistic doctors\n(von Staden 1989, Leith 2020). Second and related to the first is the\nabsence of any explicit inter-school polemics, especially the kind one\nwould come to expect from reading the works of Philodemus or the\ndialogues of Cicero. The main named philosophical adversaries in the\nwork are the three Presocratic philosophers deployed at\n1.635\u2013920 as the champions of alternative theories of matter.\nAlthough it is tempting to infer that the various anti-teleological or\nanti-providential critiques in the DRN are aimed at the\nStoics, Furley, in an influential (1966) article argued that in all\nsuggested instances the polemical targets are more likely Platonic or\nAristotelian (fullest reply in Schmidt 1990, with\ncounter-reply in Sedley 1998 ch 3). At most, the Stoics may\nbe included among the implicit targets of various anonymous views\ncriticised by Lucretius, but none of these are ever named. The closest\nwe get is an alleged Latin pun where, in calling the followers of\nHeraclitus stolidi, \u2018stupid\u2019, some think\nLucretius is referring to Stoici, the Stoics (Bailey 1947\nvol. II on 1.641 and 1.1068).\n\nHow should we understand this? Before considering some possible\nanswers, it will be useful to include two more factors: the question\nof Lucretius\u2019 sources, and second, the school\u2019s views on\npoetry.\n\nThe problem of Lucretius\u2019 sources is to a certain extent\nacademic since, as just seen, we can be confident that Lucretius\nreproduces Epicurean doctrine faithfully. Despite that, and while also\nrecognizing that we only have access to a fraction of the material\nthat may have been available to Lucretius, a bit of stock-taking will\nhelp clarify the background.\n\nFirst, then, there is the material we possess. Thanks to Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 recycling of them into Book 10 of his Lives of the\nPhilosophers, we have three letters by Epicurus himself. These\nare: the Letter to Herodotus: a brief summary of his physics;\nthe Letter to Pythocles on celestial phenomena, which\nexemplifies the Epicurean use of multiple explanations for those\nphenomena not open to closer examination; the Letter to\nMenoeceus: a more basic introduction to his moral philosophy.\nBeyond that, we have ancient collections of maxims culled from the\ncorpus, especially the Key doctrines, plus various\nancient reports, fragments and list of titles of lost works, to which\nwe can add the material from Herculaneum, which includes portions of\nthe different books On nature and those of other Epicureans,\nPhilodemus foremost. (The most up-to-date collection of all material,\nwith extensive notes, is the French translation by Delattre and\nPigeaud eds. 2010).\n\nAmong these sources, we can eliminate the Letter to\nHerodotus, in other respects the most relevant extant text.\nLucretius cannot have relied on it, because the DRN is a\nlarger and more detailed treatment. Importantly, Lucretius\u2019 case\nfor atoms and void is the fuller one, designed for beginners.\nInterestingly, though, as noted above, the Letter\u2019s\norder of exposition matches that of the DRN, or at least the\norder we can discern before Lucretius changed the order of books\n3 and 4. If we next consider the On nature, it will be\nuncontroversial that it was in some sense Lucretius\u2019 ultimate\nsource, but also obvious that Lucretius will not have wanted to\nreproduce all of its contents. In any case, the 37 books of On\nnature were not a single continuous exposition, although certain\nsections of it did function as sequential units.\n\nBeyond that, the evidence is too complex for detailed examination, so\nwe can pass instead to scholarly theories. Over a century ago Giussani\n(1896), followed by many, for example Bailey (1947 vol. I pp.\n24\u20135), suggested that another known summary, the lost Great\nEpitome, was Lucretius\u2019 main source. The appeal here is\nthat the putative source seems to be closer in scale to the\nDRN, and possibly more suited to beginners, but other than\nthat there is very little to go on. Later in the 20th\ncentury the trend was towards recognizing more Lucretian autonomy in\nshaping and organizing the material (Clay 1983, Schrijvers 1999).\nAgainst that, the most detailed investigation into this background so\nfar, Sedley 1998, argues that the first 15 books of the On\nnature were Lucretius\u2019 main initial source, which he\ngradually reshaped and compressed. Even for those who disagree with\nits thesis, this study is the starting-point for subsequent\ndiscussion, because it is the first to incorporate developments in\nHerculaneum papyrology since the 1970s, importantly our improved\nknowledge of the On nature, to which Sedley himself has\ncontributed significantly.\n\nSince that study, the most significant development has been G.\nLeone\u2019s magisterial (2012) edition of On nature II,\nwhose best-preserved sections deal with the Epicurean doctrine of the\neidola, the thin films of atoms emitted by all larger bodies\nand which form the external basis of vision. On the one hand, the new\nedition seems to reinforce Sedley\u2019s thesis, in so far as we can\nnow see that the order of exposition found in On nature II is\nindeed reproduced both in the Letter to Herodotus and in\nLucretius. In the Letter to Herodotus, section 45 is\non infinite worlds, followed by sections 46\u201348 on the\neidola. In Leone\u2019s 2012 edition, columns 1\u20136,\nthough poorly preserved, clearly mention the infinity of atoms being\nresponsible for an infinity of worlds, kosmoi. Then, although\nwe lack textual evidence for a transition, what remains of the next\n114 columns deal with the eidola. In Lucretius, provided we\nfactor in the swap of books 3 and 4, we have the same sequence: after\nthe conclusion of DRN 2 on infinite worlds, the\nsimulacra are dealt with at DRN 4.54\u2013216 (=\nbook 3 in the earlier draft). On the other hand, and somewhat\nbafflingly, this makes it more difficult to imagine the contents of\nOn nature I, since that single book now seems insufficient to\ncover all the material abridged into Herodotus sections\n37\u201344. For that reason, Sedley had argued that the\neidola section of Book 2 must have covered no more than a\nfifth of that book (1998 p. 112). But Leone\u2019s edition suggests\nsomething more like four fifths.\n\nFrom sources let us now consider one final peculiarity of the\nDRN, the apparent clash between the project itself, a\ndidactic poem on Epicurean physics, and the reported hostility to\npoetry in Epicureanism. This topic has been much discussed, but it is\npossible to think that its paradox has been overplayed, especially in\nearlier scholarship (start rather at Obbink ed. 1995; full survey in\nMcOsker 2020). Epicurus is indeed reported to have been critical of\npoetry, perhaps not specifically relating to verse itself, but as part\nof the broader Epicurean rejection of conventional ideas and the\ncentral role played by poetry in ancient education. So far, this is\nmerely the \u2018ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy\u2019\n(Republic 607b5\u20136) with an Epicurean twist. More\nnarrowly, Epicureans\u2019 hostility to verse may have been sharpened\nby the wish to demarcate themselves from the early Stoics\u2019\nembrace of poetry as making a positive contribution to elevated or\nsublime content. Philodemus, in order to record his contempt for the\nview, reports that the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon reported that the\nearlier Stoic Cleanthes claimed: \u2018meters, melodies, and rhythms\napproach as closely as possible to the truth of the contemplation\n(\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) of divine things\n(\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd)\u2019 (Philodemus On\nMusic 4, ed. Delattre 142.5\u201322; discussion in Asmis 2017).\nWe also have reports of Epicurean arguments criticising the use of\nverse as not adding anything to the content. That is, Epicureans held\nthat the arguments and doctrines were what helped us achieve peace of\nmind, ataraxia, and literary format does not contribute\nanything to that (Sextus Empiricus Adv. Math. 1.299). Closer\nto Lucretius, there is the case of Philodemus, who wrote extensively\non poetics and rhetoric and was himself an accomplished poet. The fact\nthat Philodemus was a poet makes a complete ban on poetry in\nEpicureanism very unlikely, as opposed to, perhaps, a distinction\nbetween poetry as entertainment and more serious philosophical\ncontent. More positively, both Philodemus and Lucretius display a wide\nand deep knowledge of literature. Yet Philodemus did not write poetry\non philosophical topics, so there remains a gap between Philodemus and\nLucretius.\n\nWe can now review attempts make sense of these features as a whole,\nnamely Lucretius\u2019 anachronistic reliance on Epicurus alone, the\nabsence of inter-school polemics, and the possible clash with his\nown\u2019 school\u2019s views on poetry. To account for these, a\nrange of motivations have been suggested. Perhaps the least generous\nview is that, operating mainly as a poet, Lucretius found in\nEpicureanism, or rather its foundational texts, an engaging subject\nfor poetry (Volk 2002). More generously, we can imagine that even if\nLucretius was a committed Epicurean, he may have been isolated from\nthe philosophical mainstream and not fully conversant with the most\nup-to-date version of his denomination, and even something of a\nfundamentalist, seeing no need to go beyond the master\u2019s words\n(Sedley 1998 ch. 3). More generously still, the narrowing of focus we\nfind in the DRN could have been a deliberate simplification\nfor the sake of a more appealing introductory work. The mix of\nphilosophical argument, rhetoric and poetic imagery found in the\nDRN is typical of protreptic literature, which must avail\nitself of imagery and rhetorical persuasion to render the hearer more\nreceptive to its philosophical arguments (De Lacy 1948; on emotional\nappeal, O\u2019Keefe 2021; on rhetoric Markovic 2008). Poetry,\nmoreover, is the best medium in which to express the intense emotional\nimpact of such conversion, in this instance the \u2018heavenly\ndelight\u2026 and awe\u2019 (3.28\u20139 divina\nvoluptas\u2026 atque horror) Lucretius felt at\nEpicurus\u2019 revelation of the true nature of the universe. One of\nLucretius\u2019 favorite images, used no less than four times in the\nDRN, is that of illumination: our fear of the unknown, before\nEpicurus illuminated it, makes us like children afraid of the\ndark.\n\nOn any reading of Lucretius\u2019 motivations, it will be helpful in\nto keep in mind some simplifications that he has made in the material.\nFirst, the single divine savior Epicurus replaces the plural authority\nof \u2018the men\u2019 and their different works. Second, technical\nlanguage is largely avoided. Third, Lucretius focuses mainly on\nintroductory exposition and uses a starker set of contrasts between\nerror and truth, darkness and illumination, before and after Epicurus.\nThat is at the expense of more extensive or complex technical content,\nof dealing with developments in contemporary science or of scoring\npoints in inter-school polemics. Two positive features, however, are\nnot lost in the translation to Latin verse. First, Lucretius retains a\nstrong commitment to clarity and careful organization\n(stoicheiosis) of the system, with explicit statements of\npoints needing proof, supporting arguments, transitions between\npoints, and a general care not to rely upon points not yet proven.\nSecond is an appeal to empirical data and careful use of analogies to\nconstruct theories. Among these Lucretius will often seek out examples\nfamiliar to his own Roman audience, an effective way of carrying\npoints.\n5. Natural science\n\nEpicurus advanced atomist explanations to an unsurpassed degree, yet\nEpicurean science remained subordinate to the ethical aim of freeing\nus from anxiety in the quest for peace of mind (Key doctrines\n10\u201313, Letter to Herodotus 37 and 81, Letter\nto Pythocles 85). In Lucretius, this ethical goal is\noften left implicit, with ethical material concentrated in the proems\n(see section 6). Officially, Lucretius proposes two programs for the\nwork as a whole. The first curriculum (1.50\u201361) announces the\npoem\u2019s subject as \u2018the high system of heaven and the\ngods\u2019 and the primordia rerum, \u2018first-beginnings\nof things\u2019, in other words, a cosmology, including gods as part\nof the world, the whole underwritten by a set of first principles.\nThis is a fairly standard ancient scientific program. But Lucretius\nimmediately follows that up with the claim that it is not science, but\nreligion, specifically the human fear of divine governance, that\noppresses mankind and ruins happiness. We are then told, in a second\ncurriculum (1.127\u201335), that the nature of soul must be joined to\nthe previous topics, to dispel such fear. The two together cover the\nfull Epicurean project, although Lucretius does not formally\nsubordinate the first to the second.\nBook 1\n\nBook 1 introduces the foundational principles of the system, atoms and\nvoid.\n1.147\u2013482: Causation, method, and metaphysics.\n\nLucretius starts from the observed regularities of nature to argue\nthat nothing comes from nothing and nothing is reduced to nothing\n(147\u2013264). We then get a first methodological point that even\ninvisible bodies can have observable effects. Lucretius supports the\nclaim by reference to air and wind and illustrates it through an epic\nsimile offering an analogy between a windstorm and a mountain river in\nflood and extends the point by noting the inability of the individual\nsenses to perceive the other senses\u2019 \u2018proper\nsensibles\u2019 (265\u2013328). Lucretius next makes the case for\nvoid as necessary for motion, or rather that motion is inconceivable\nwithout void, and rebuts some counter examples (329\u2013417).\nFollowing that, \u2018the all\u2019, that is the universe, is\nasserted to consist of body and void; these two are the only per\nse entities, no third per se thing being conceivable.\nAll other things therefore are dependent on these and inherit their\nproperties. Lucretius distinguishes properties that are inseparable\n(coniuncta, Greek\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1)\nfrom others that are accidental (eventa,\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1). Even time\nor facts about the past, like the Trojan war, do not have a\nstand-alone existence but are dependent on our world and will not\nsurvive it.\n1.483\u2013634: Atoms and their minimal parts\n\nThe case for atoms follows (483\u2013615). All perceptible bodies\nmust be compounds of body and void, but since destruction into nothing\nis impossible, there must be a limit to destruction, \u2018pure\nvoid\u2019 and \u2018voidless body\u2019. Compound bodies must be\nmade of minute, indestructible bodies, stress-tested over infinite\ntime. Lucretius does not use the Greek word atomos,\n\u2018uncut(able)\u2019, though Cicero had tried\nindividuum, preferring terms that denote their\ngenerative capacities, such primordia ,\u2018first\nthings\u2019, or corpora prima, \u2018first bodies\u2019.\nEpicurean atoms are not physically divisible, but they are\ntheoretically analyzable into multiples of minimal or\n\u2018partless\u2019 parts (615\u201334). A minimum unit must\nbe conceded to account for differences in size and shapes of atoms.\nThere must also be differences among atoms themselves, for if atoms\ncould be reduced to a standard minimum unit, no variety in generation\nwould be possible. In Lucretius, however, the discussion of minimal\nparts is much abridged (see also 2.478\u2013580; on atoms, Konstan\n2020; on minima, Verde 2013).\n1.635\u2013920: Rival theories of matter refuted\n\nFrom the positive case for atomism, Lucretius veers to a critique of\nthree rival theories of matter. Three Presocratic philosophers\nare put forward as representatives of these theories. First comes\nHeraclitus (635\u2013711), leader of the monists, advocate of the\nsingle element fire, with generation operating by rarefaction and\ncondensation. Empedocles is the champion of the four-element theorists\n(712\u2013829) and he generates all things by union and dissolution,\nand finally Anaxagoras, advocate of an indefinite pluralism, who\nposits an indefinite number of \u2018homoeomerous\u2019 or\n\u2018like-parted\u2019 stuffs (830\u2013920) which merely vary in\nlocal concentration. The section may have been imported from\nelsewhere. One can suspect an Epicurean and/or doxographic source\nat work, whether Epicurus himself (Sedley 1998) or a later one\n(Montarese 2012). The key point that Lucretius stresses is that only\natomism can accommodate change while keeping the first principles, the\natoms themselves, completely invariant.\n1.951\u20131118 Infinite universe and space; critique of geocentrism\n\nFollowing the simile of the honey and the wormwood (921\u201350),\nbook 1 concludes with a dizzying transition from microcosm to infinite\nuniverse (951\u20131051). Lucretius argues that void or space cannot\nbe bounded: there is always further to go in all directions. And if\nso, then body, as well as space, must be infinite, for without\ninfinite body, creation would run out of matter. (Lucretius here is\nrelying upon the Epicurean doctrine that up and down are\nuniversal, as he will explain in book 2.) The infinite universe was a\nlegacy from earlier atomists and had been subject to criticism from\nPlato and Aristotle, who argued that the world was finite and unique,\nwith earth at the center. This is why Lucretius adds a critique of\ngeocentric cosmology to his positive case for the infinite universe\n(1052\u20131113). \nBook 2\n\nBook 2 covers atomic motion, atomic shapes, and the emergent\nproperties of compounds\n2.62\u2013332: Atomic motion and the swerve (for this section, see Fowler 2002).\n\nLucretius resumes his exposition with atomic motion, offering the\nfamous scientific image of motes of dust in a sunbeam (simulacrum\net imago \u2018likeness and image\u2019 112) to illustrate\nceaseless atomic motion, within or outside of compounds. Atoms travel\nat a constant but unimaginably high speed, meeting no resistance in\nthe pure void. They are much faster even than particles of light\n\u2014fire being a compound\u2014 whose constitutive atoms pull and\npush one another, causing the particles to have a lower aggregate\nvelocity (150\u201364). Atomic rebounds merely redirect them, without\nloss of speed. There is a universal up and down, however, and the\nweight of atoms will lead them to fall through space, at uniform\natomic speed.\n\nIt is at this point that Lucretius introduces the doctrine of the\natomic swerve or clinamen, a minimal deviation by atoms from\ntheir straight course that occurs randomly, at no specific time or\nplace (216\u201393). The swerve, attributed to Epicurus in our\nsources but not attested in our surviving works, is brought in to\nanswer a narrow hypothetical problem: what would happen if atoms were\nall traveling downwards, like drops of rain? Since they travel at\nequal speed, they could never overtake each other, nor could they\nshift from their straight downward trajectory and collide, so that no\natomic compounds could ever get going. Lucretius maintains that a\nminimal deviation \u2013best imagined as a\none-minimum lane-shift on a highway, rather than a change in\ndirection, an offramp\u2013 must take place in order to ensure that\ncollisions (and eventually worlds?) can arise. The account as we have\nit (216\u201350) is already too brief. But now, quite surprisingly,\nLucretius links it to a second factor, voluntary action\n(251\u201393). Taking voluntary action as a self-evident fact, he\nasserts that it stands as second independent reason requiring a\nminimal swerve, lest volition be trapped within an infinite causal\nchain. The exact meaning of this section has been much debated.\nIndeterminism in ancient atomist theory cannot help but remind us of\nindeterminism in modern quantum physics, which has sometimes been\ninvoked to support psychological indeterminism, thereby inviting us to\ndo the same for Lucretius. Yet the apparent lack of recourse to the\nswerve in some substantial surviving sections of On nature\nbook 25, where Epicurus argues for human agency over causal\ndeterminism, leaves it unclear how widely Epicurus relied on the\nswerve. Some think a swerve is involved in every voluntary animal\naction; a more minimal view requires only that the swerve grant minds,\nthose most subtle of physical bodies, enough slack from the chain of\ncausation, over time, to develop an independent domain of agency\n(survey in Englert, 2020; on Epicurus against determinism, Kamtekar\n2021).\n\nLucretius returns to atomic motion to assert the permanence of matter\nand motion (308\u2013332). Atomic motion does not cease in bodies at\napparent rest, but in cosmic settings the atoms settle into regular\npatterns, presumably within compounds, producing regular properties.\nTo support this Lucretius uses the analogy of distant views: just as\nsheep pasturing on a hill are reduced, at a distance, to white dots on\na green background; similarly, the clamor and flashing armor of a\nlegion being drilled dies down, from a nearby mountain top, to a mere\ngleam on the plain.\n2.333\u2013729 Atomic shapes and their combinations.\n\nThere is a great variety of atomic shapes, with many small variations\n(333\u2013477). Like animals, atoms can be classed into types or\nspecies without also requiring that all individuals of the species be\ncompletely identical. These atomic types underlie the diversity, but\nalso the finite regularity, of phenomenal properties and sensations.\nFrom line 380 and following Lucretius offers examples of the\ncontrasting properties of various materials, but his inferences from\nthese perceptible properties to their microstructures is problematic\nif referred directly to atoms (Bailey 1947 vol. II p. 866) instead of\nto compounds or \u2018molecules\u2019. The number of atomic\ntypes or shapes, we next learn, is unimaginably large, but not\ninfinite, since the atoms are finite multiples of finite\nminima and all atoms are imperceptibly small; but there is no\nlimit to the number of atoms of each exact shape (478\u2013580).\n\nA fuller account of compounds is then promised by the announcement\nthat nothing perceptible consists of only one type of atom\n(581\u201388). Instead, however, Lucretius offers an allegorical\nimage of \u2018mother earth\u2019, the great repository of all\nstuffs, rendered through the image of the Asiatic goddess Cybele, the\nMagna Mater (2.598\u2013660). From the surviving final\nsections of On nature 14, where Epicurus criticizes Plato in\nthe Timaeus for reducing fire to a single pyramidal atomic\nshape, it does seem that Epicurus recognized the four elements as\n(the most?) basic types of atomic compounds (Wigodsky 2007). Lucretius\ndoes not delve into this, however, and stresses instead the complexity\nof visible bodies. Such variety and complexity do not threaten\nthe regularities of nature, since they all proceed from finite and\nfixed atomic shapes.\n2.730\u20131022 Properties of atoms and emergent properties of compounds\n\nThe next section completes the introduction of atoms by distinguishing\nbetween atoms, whose only inseparable properties are shape, size and\nweight, and the emergent properties of compounds. Atoms lack\ncolor (730\u2013841), heat, moisture or smell (842\u201364). As for\nsensation, it is also an emergent property of living things, and atoms\ndo not have it (865\u2013900). This somewhat alienating thought is\nthen capped with the grand and slightly less alienating poetic idea of\nthe cycle of life (991\u20131022, a recap of 2.569\u201380). We are\nall children of heaven and earth, since we grow from the elements and\ndie back into them; within our world, the emergence and then\ndisappearance of life are in constant balance, secured by the\nindestructibility of the atoms.\n2.1023\u20131174 Infinite Worlds.\n\nAs did book 1, book 2 ends with the infinite universe. This time the\ninfinite universe is the basis for arguing that there are other worlds\nthan ours; since space is infinite, we cannot be unique\n(1048\u201389). Worlds occur by chance, when the sufficient material\nconditions are met, without any need for gods (1090\u20131104). The\ngrowth and decay of worlds is not a metaphor, but closer to a\nbiological fact. Lucretius ends book 2 on the pessimistic note that\nour world is already in decay (1105\u201374; but contrast\n5.325\u201337 where it is said to be young).\nBook 3\n\nBook 3 is on the nature and mortality of soul, concluding with the\nfear of death.\n3.94\u2013416: the nature and structure of soul\n\nThe soul is a body and not a harmony of parts in tension; it\nis a biological part of the body, like an organ, which remains active\nwhen the body is at rest, but it is unable to survive separation from\nit (94\u2013135). Lucretius distinguishes two main parts of soul\n(136\u201376). The animus, roughly mind, is the controlling\npart and center of consciousness, located in the chest, the\nanima more like the nervous system, spread throughout the\nbody (on partition, Verde, 2020; broader background in von Staden\n2000). Both parts are bodily since they act and are acted upon. A more\ndetailed elemental analysis of the soul follows (177\u2013322): the\nanimus is made of fine and mobile particles. It is a\ncomposite of breath, heat, air plus a fourth finest and nameless\nstuff. The nameless stuff initiates movement, which imparts it to\nbreath, heat and air; these then move the body. They form a single\nbody or mixture, but with small variations among individuals. These\nelemental-humoral \u2018idiosyncrasies\u2019 run from excess fire (=\nprone to anger) to excess air (= too placid). Although these\nimperfections cannot be eradicated, they can be controlled with\ntraining. Mind and body cannot survive apart, but each will eventually\nbe dissolved into their constituent atoms (323\u2013416).\n3.417\u2013829: Thirty proofs of the mortality of soul\n\nLucretius offers an epic catalogue of thirty arguments for the\nmortality of soul, mostly turning upon the interdependency of soul and\nbody for life. Lines 425\u2013669 argue against post-mortem survival,\n670\u2013783 against pre-existence, while 784\u2013829 return to\nmore general considerations. These proofs seek to undermine older\ntraditional beliefs in the afterlife and underworld (Hades) or attack\nPlatonic reincarnation and the immortality of the soul. The final\nsection of the book shifts from the fact of death as the end of all\nsensation, to argue that death is not to be feared (see section\n6).\nBook 4\n\nBook 4 explains the activities of soul: perception, thought, dreams,\nand emotions\n4.26\u2013215: the existence and nature of the simulacra\n\nSimulacra (Greek eidola) are thin atomic films that\nare constantly emitted in all directions from all larger aggregates,\npreserving the structure or shape of the original object\n(26\u2013109). They are extremely fine, form spontaneously and\nswiftly, and travel at great speed.\n4.216\u2013822: sensation and thought.\n\nSight and related phenomena are treated first (216\u2013378). Vision\nis due to the multiple impacts of a stream of\nsimulacra, while other sensations are due to other\nkinds of effluences or direct contact. Lucretius examines a number of\nvisual puzzles to show that the eyes are never wrong, rather the mind\ngenerates false inferences. This leads to an Epicurean critique of\nskepticism and a defense of the infallibility of the senses\n(469\u2013521). Lucretius replies to the sceptic that reason cannot\nrefute the senses and any attempt to deny knowledge through the senses\nis self-defeating, the very concept of true and false being anchored\nin sense-experience. (522-721). The working of the other senses is\ndiscussed before turning to thought (722\u2013822). Mental visions\nand dreams are a sort of attenuated inner vision reliant on the impact\nof even finer simulacra directly onto the soul. These\nsimulacra are so abundant, at all times, that the mind can focus on\nany of them; even fantastical imaginings are real enough, since the\nimages, like clouds, are constantly forming and coalescing into all\nmanner of shapes.\n4.823\u20131057: Functions of the body and soul\n\nLucretius deals with a number of bodily functions, from nutrition to\nvoluntary motion, sleep and dreams, before transitioning to a more\ngeneral critique of erotic love (1058\u20131287). The transition is\nhandled by a pointed refutation of teleology aimed at the notion of\nbody parts as designed to serve a purpose (823\u201357). In all\ncases, Lucretius replies, their existence preceded their use. Unlike\nartefacts, which serve a purpose that already exists, for example,\ncups for drinking or beds for sleeping, sight was not designed before\nthere were eyes to see.\nBook 5\n\nBook 5 contains a cosmology, describes the origins of life and the\nhistory of civilization.\n5.91\u2013770: Our world\n\nOur world had a beginning and will have an end (91\u2013109). Before\nexpanding on each of these, Lucretius offers a refutation of\ncreationist accounts (110\u2013234). The gods do not dwell in the\nworld, nor did they make the world for man. Even supposing they did,\nawkward questions can be raised. What were the gods up to before they\nbuilt the world for us? Where did they get the scientific knowledge\nneeded to plan life? And so on. At 195\u2013234, Lucretius rejects\nthe idea that the world was designed for human use. In fact, the world\nis barely able to sustain us. Most of it cannot support agriculture\nand agriculture itself is hard work, with crops sometimes failing. Why\nare there so many beasts and pests? They seem to thrive even without\nhelp, while humans are completely helpless when born. Next the\nmortality of the world is inferred from the mortality of its component\nparts, the four elements, each of which is destructible\n(235\u2013415). Against the upholders of an eternal world, Lucretius\nasks: why does human history not reach further back than the Theban\nand Trojan wars?\n\nOur world did not arise through intelligence or design, but because,\nin the infinite universe, as atoms work out randomly all possible\ncombinations, at some point an accumulation of atoms of a suitable\nkind to form our world occurred (416\u2013508). The formation of the\nearth is followed with an account of the heavens (509\u2013771). In\nhis account of the nature and movements of the sun, moon and stars,\nLucretius has recourse to the Epicurean mode of \u2018multiple\nexplanations\u2019, to be used for phenomena where we cannot\ndetermine, among a number of possible explanations \u2013and\nexcluding divine causation\u2013 which one applies. In such cases we\nshould stay open to all of them. Of each we can be confident that,\neven if not the case in our world, it will be true in some other world\n(526\u201333 and also 6.703\u201311; on the background,\nEpicurus\u2019 Letter to Pythocles and Hankinson 2013).\n5.772\u20131457: Life on earth, early man, history of civilization\n\nLucretius returns to the early earth and the origins of life\n(772\u2013925). The account, marked throughout by the conspicuous\nabsence of gods or teleology, is one of the most detailed and\ninfluential in the ancient anti-creationist tradition. First, grasses\nand plants sprouted from the earth, who, as mother of all, produced\nanimals from wombs inside the earth and quasi-milk for those first\nanimals. That fertility was of brief duration, however. The key\nanalogy is the earth as a female animal. A limited amount of\nstill-occurring spontaneous generation, small insects from mud,\nunderwrites the legitimacy of the comparison, while the notion of a\nlimited period of fertility explains why large creatures were once\nproduced but are no more (795\u2013836). Lucretius allows for many\nearly defective creatures and semi-Darwinian false starts that died\noff because they were not viable, could not reproduce, or find\nadvantageous arrangements, as in domestic animals (878\u2013925).\nAlthough much of this non-teleological account owes an obvious debt to\nEmpedocles\u2019 zoogony, with its phase of random, monstrous\ncross-species combinations of limbs (Diels-Kranz B 57-61), Lucretius\ncorrects the earlier theory by arguing against even temporary\ncrossings of the species boundary (Schrijvers 1999, Campbell\n2003).\n\nEarly man was solitary, not social, and much sturdier\n(926\u20131010). Lucretius outlines the hardships of life before\nagriculture, fire, clothing, society or law or marriage, but balances\nthat with the absence of the many ills civilization has brought, such\nas warfare or the perils of navigation. This same balance runs through\nthe history of civilization that closes the book (1011\u20131457). As\nis now widely recognized, Lucretius is not a progressivist, nor does\nhe see humanity as fallen from a past Golden Age of innocent happiness\nand self-sufficiency. At each technological advance he points out the\ndrawbacks of the new stage. The advances are prompted by nature,\nwithout divine inventors, as mankind recognizes the usefulness of\nshelter, clothes, fire, marriage, friendship and family life, the last\nof which is framed in Epicurean ethical terms, justice as a social\ncontract (1011\u20131027). The origins of language are not due to a\nprimeval name-giver, but an innate human impulse to make sounds and\nthe posterior recognition of the utility of designating objects\nthrough sounds (1028\u201390). A similar story goes for fire and\ncooking (1091\u20131104), the foundation of cities and the rise of\nkings and property (1105\u201335), later replaced by laws and the\nfear of punishment (1136\u201360). After outlining the origins of\nbelief in the gods (1161\u20131240; see section 6), Lucretius\ncontinues with the arts of war, metals, weapons (including a weird\naccount of unsuccessful experiment of bulls, boars and lions trained\nfor war), clothing, agriculture, music, and simple rustic pleasures,\nleading to the final improvements in war and the arts. These accounts\nare mere reconstructions, since these origins are mostly unavailable\nto investigation, but even without offering multiple alternatives,\nLucretius must think it sufficient to provide for each discovery a\nplausible, non-divine origin.\nBook 6\n\nBook 6 explains meteorological and terrestrial phenomena\n\nIn keeping with the two-book pattern, book 6 describes the world in\naction, doing so by tackling successive meteorological and earthly\nphenomena often viewed in popular belief as divine manifestations. The\nmultiple explanations featured in this section can be matched from\ndoxographic sources, but the pattern of the book is shaped by\nLucretius. In each case there is an emphasis on destruction or the\nthreatening aspects of nature, building to the final account of the\nAthenian plague, all in responsion to Book 1\u2019s theme of birth\nand generation (Jope 1989). Lucretius reviews thunder and lightning\n(96\u2013422), waterspouts (451\u2013534) clouds and rain, before\npassing to terrestrial level with earthquakes (533\u2013607), mount\nAetna and volcanoes (639\u2013711), the pestilential fumes of lake\nAvernus (738\u2013839) and other strange springs and fountains. An\nextensive account of magnetism \u2013a special challenge for\natomism\u2013 comes next (6.906\u20131089), and then various\npestilences (1090\u20131137), followed by the gruesome case study of\nthe Athenian plague. Throughout Lucretius encourages an attitude of\ndemythologizing detachment before the uncanny or invisible, thanks to\nthe denial of divine causation and recognition of the \u2018finite\ncapacity\u2019, finita potestas, of all natural\nprocesses (6.64\u20135, cf. 1.76).]\n6. Ethics\n\nThe DRN\u2019s opening, perhaps channeling Empedocles,\nproposes religion, or rather wrong religion, as the obstacle to human\nhappiness, for which the cure is physics. Yet as the work progresses\nLucretius provides a richer picture of Epicurean ethics, including\nEpicurean hedonism, and outlines a wider range of obstacles to human\nhappiness. Lucretius does not give a full presentation of Epicurean\nethics, though the end of Book 3 on death comes close, but the proems\noffer brief sermons or strenuous pleas for Epicurean values mixed with\npointed diagnoses of contemporary malaises. Thanks to these, by the\nend of the 6 books, Lucretius manages a reasonably full picture of\nEpicurean ethics and its goal of peace of mind, the capacity to\n\u2018face all things with a calm mind\u2019 placata\nposse omnia mente tueri (5.1203).\n\nThe proem of book 1 opens with a hymn to Venus as world-governing\ndeity (1.21) and a prayer for her to intervene with Mars, god of war\n(1.29\u201344), both of which are problematic for Epicurean theology\n(see section 7). But the hymn also celebrates the generative and\nattractive side of nature, Venus as \u2018pleasure of gods and\nmen\u2019 hominum divomque voluptas (1.1). The\nproem of Book 2 (1\u201361) also opens with pleasure\n(iucunda voluptas 2.4), but a more refined\npsychological pleasure, that of knowing you have escaped ills and are\nabove the fray in the \u2018lofty sanctuaries of the wise\u2019\n(2.7). Lucretius follows this with the normative claim that nature\ncalls for nothing else than freedom from pain and a mind at\npeace. Other apparent goods such as luxury, social status or glory do\nnot profit the body or the mind. None of these, moreover, can dispatch\nthe fear of death; only reason or philosophy can do that. The opening\nof book 3 concentrates upon the praise of Epicurus, whose teachings\ndispel all fear, so that in contemplating nature, as revealed by him,\nwe seem to leave the world behind us, to experience divine pleasure\nand awe divina voluptas\u2026 atque horror\n(3.1\u201330).\n\nThe conclusion of book 3 (830\u20131094), following the demonstration\nof the mortality of body and soul, seeks to remove the fear of death.\nDeath according to Epicurus is the end of all sensation, it is\n\u2018nothing to us\u2019 (830). To fear being dead\n\u2013as opposed to dying\u2013 is to suffer from a conceptual\nmuddle. The hard fact is that you will not be at your own\nburial, nor will you be nibbled by worms in the ground or\nsuffer torments or rewards in the afterlife, because you will\nno longer exist. In what has become known as the symmetry argument\n(Warren 2004), Lucretius argues that, just as we calmly accept our\nnon-existence before life, we should view the time after it with the\nsame indifference. This therapeutic mix of emotion and argument is\nonly one of many in the close of book 3, which combines philosophical\nargument with rhetorical and poetic techniques to great effect.\n\nNot as magnificent, but more appropriately comic is the attack on\nerotic love concluding book 4 (1058\u20131287). Lucretius demotes\ncosmic Venus from the proem of 1 to human sexual desire and dismisses\nerotic passion as simply an excessive form of a natural desire.\nLucretius\u2019 attitude seems less philosophical than middle-aged or\nmedical, with emphasis on practical sexual education. We are informed\nthat women also have a libido, what positions are best for conception,\nand that devotion and clean habits are the basis of stable\nattachment.\n\nThe proems of 5 and 6 concentrate more directly on Epicurus. The proem\nof 6 (1\u201395, especially 10\u201333) contains the most explicit\nsummary of Epicurus\u2019s moral benefactions in the poem. Building\non the account of civilisation from book 5, it places Epicurus in\nhistorical Athens, and explains how, despite having every material\nneed satisfied, the Athenians were still unable to achieve peace of\nmind. For this they needed Epicurus to teach them the limits of fear\nand pleasure and a scientific understanding of the world (31\u20132).\nThe function of the last, as Lucretius expands in managing the\ntransition to the meteorological subject of the book, was to banish\nfear of the divine (50\u201367), which was particularly linked to the\nheavens in the imagination and liable to insinuate itself into our\nthinking through ignorance of the workings of nature (see section\n7).\n\nThe gruesome depiction of the Athenian plague concludes the poem\n(6.1138\u20131286). As noted, its focus on death and suffering\ncorresponds to the poem\u2019s opening scene with Venus and birth.\nEpicurus taught that suffering could be resisted through mental\nfocusing on the joys one had already experienced, while extreme pain\ncould be endured through the knowledge that it would be short-lived\n(Key doctrines 3 and 4). Though moderns tend to find this\nless than convincing, Epicurus put it into to practice for the benefit\nof his disciples in recording how he coped successfully with the\npainful circumstances of his own death (Diogenes Laertius\n10.22). In the later summing-up formula of Epicurean ethics, such\ncheerful endurance was the final ingredient in the \u2018fourfold\nremedy\u2019 for happiness: \u2018God holds no fear, death no\nworries; the good is easy to get; evil easily endured\u2019\n(Philodemus, Against the Those who Claim to be Readers,\nPHerc 1005, 4.9\u201314). Although Lucretius dwells on the\nhelpless mental anguish of the Athenian plague victims, he does not\noffer an explicit Epicurean remedy. Some hold that the ending we have,\nwhich merely depicts the ailment and not the cure, is the one\nLucretius intended because, thanks to all we have learnt, we can\nsupply it ourselves. For others, the ending still awaits its final\nrevision, because it is hard to imagine that Lucretius, having dealt\nwith the first three explicitly in the poem, would have left the\nfourth merely implicit.\n7. Religion\n\nLucretius opens the DRN with a traditional prayer to\nanthropomorphic Venus, as a world-governing deity (1.21), to support\nhis poetic project and to pacify her lover Mars (1.21\u201340). This\nis already problematic, but the opening sequence is made even more\npuzzling by the immediate sequel, a clear statement of the most\nimportant Epicurean departure from popular belief about the gods, the\ndenial that they intervene in the world, because that is incompatible\nwith their eternal happiness, 1.44\u20139:\n\nFor the nature of divinity must necessarily enjoy immortal life along\nwith the greatest peace, far removed and separated from our affairs;\nfor without any pain, without any danger, itself mighty by its own\nresources, needing us in nothing, it is neither moved by benefactions\nnor touched by anger. (transl. Rouse-Smith with modifications)\n\n\nThe passage is fully orthodox (Key doctrines 1, Letter to\nMenoceus 123) and the same lines recur later at 2.644\u201351,\nafter the Magna Mater passage, where they make much better\nsense as a correction, from an Epicurean standpoint, of the preceding\nallegorical treatment of the earth as mother of the gods. But the\nbrutally abrupt way the lines undercut the prayer to Venus is\ndifficult. Many editors have suggested that 1.44\u20139 are an\nintrusion and should be removed or at most reflect an incomplete draft\n(defense in Bailey 1947 vol. II pp. 601\u20134; survey in Butterfield\n2020). But regardless of whether we keep or reject 1.44\u20139, it\nseems likely that Lucretius meant us, later on and from hindsight, to\nreinterpret the opening scene in some way more compatible with\nEpicureanism.\n\nLucretius next describes the intellectual hero, whose \u2018flight of\nthe mind\u2019 liberated humanity through science (61\u201379;\nEpicurus, again in hindsight, though not named), followed by the\nexample of human sacrifice of Iphigeneia (80\u2013101), to condemn\nwrong religion. (The example is quite literary: human sacrifice\nwas not a feature of Roman religion.) The main focus thereafter is\nnatural science, the atomic world free from divine governance, and\nLucretius does not return to the gods themselves until book 5. At\n5.146\u201355 we learn that the gods have exceedingly fine bodies, so\nthat they cannot be seen or touched, only grasped by the mind (that\nis, via especially fine simulacra, see below). Accordingly,\nthey do not dwell in the world. Lucretius\u2019 promise to tell us\nwhere they dwell (5.155) is never fulfilled, but other Epicurean\nsources hold that the gods dwell in the inter-cosmic voids. In\nLucretius this much seems strongly implied by the imagery used at\n3.14\u201330, when the world falls away as we experience\ndivine pleasure.\n\nThe origins of human belief in gods are given later in book 5 as part\nof the history of civilisation (1161\u20131240). Early men, both with\nwaking mind and in their dreams, had visions of the gods as beings of\ngreat beauty, stature and strength. As these figures did not seem to\nage, they attributed to them eternal life (1169\u201382). It was then\nthat, unable to puzzle out the workings of the heaven, they\n\u2018took shelter\u2019 by, as it were, handing over the governance\nof the world to these gods. That, for Lucretius, was the great fall.\nAt 1204\u20131240 Lucretius offers some impressive lines on\nnature\u2019s capacity, still now, to cow and grind down humanity, as\nwhen we contemplate the majesty of the heavens or are shaken up by the\nthunder and lightning of a powerful storm.\n\nLucretius\u2019 fullest positive account of the Epicurean gods and of\nhuman piety is given in the proem of book 6 at 68\u201378:\n\nUnless you spew all these errors out of your mind, and put far from\nyou thoughts unworthy of the gods and alien to their peace, their holy\ndivinity, impaired by you, will often do you harm, not that the\nsupreme power of the gods is open to insult, so that it should in\nwrath thirst to inflict sharp vengeance, but because you yourself will\nimagine that they who are quiet in their placid peace, are rolling\ngreat billows of wrath, you will not be able to approach their shrines\nwith placid heart, you will not have the strength to receive with\ntranquil peace of spirit the images (simulacra) that are\ncarried to men\u2019s minds from their holy bodies, declaring what\nthe divine shapes are. (transl. Rouse-Smith)\n\n\nIn the Letter to Menoeceus 123 Epicurus enjoins us to\n\u2018think of a god as an indestructible animal\u2019 and\nexplains that to form a proper conception of the divine, we must\nreject all that is incompatible with that core notion (as above\n1.44\u20139). What this book 6 passage adds is an explanation of how\nwe must make ourselves receptive to the gods, so that their images may\nimpinge upon our minds. The result is that it is we who are in\nlarge part responsible for shaping our conception of the gods. Peace\nof mind, while mostly an Epicurean end in itself, in this case also\nbecomes instrumental to the formation of a proper conception of the\ngods.\n\nStill, there are problems. Since our access to the gods proceeds\nexclusively through simulacra, and it is all too easy to form\na wrong conception of the gods, one can worry how any certain\nconception about them is possible (why no multiple explanations\nhere?), or why we should think that these gods are anything above and\nbeyond those simulacra, or again if it actually matters that\nthere should be such beings, since they do not answer prayers or\npunish wrongdoing. Add to that the numerous difficulties and awkward\nquestions that must be overcome to support the extra-cosmic life of\nsuch anthropomorphic gods with quasi-bodies and quasi-blood (see\nCicero On the nature of the gods 1.43\u20139), and one can\nsee how Epicurus\u2019 ancient critics felt free to accuse him of\natheism, the extra-cosmic gods merely providing plausible denial. An\necho of that tension is still heard in the modern scholarly debate\nabout these gods, confronting realists, who hold that Epicurus really\nwas committed to the existence of these gods (Konstan 2011) and\nidealists, who hold that we are mostly responsible for constructing\nour own conception of an ideal life (Long and Sedley 1987 section 23;\nSedley 2011). Perhaps the only relative certainty is that Lucretius,\nwho above distinguishes the gods from their simulacra, is\nofficially a realist, as is Philodemus (Essler 2011).\n\nYet however that theoretical debate comes out, it makes little\ndifference at the practical level, where the exemplarity of the gods\nis far more important. By focusing our minds upon the perfect life we\nconceive these gods to live, we can find or construct models on how\nbest to live out our own finite span. Such exemplarity in turn appears\nto be the best way to understand the various claims made by the\nEpicureans, followed by Lucretius, that Epicurus himself was a\nparadoxical \u2018mortal god\u2019 (deus ille fuit\n5.8) who taught his followers how to lead \u2018a life worthy of the\ngods\u2019 (3.322) that is, a life lived as far as possible in\nimitation of the blessed and imperturbable gods (Erler 2002). The\nexemplary life Epicurus led \u2013 and often in other Epicurean\nliterature his immediate disciples as well \u2013 could function as a\nsuitable model for such \u2018focusings\u2019 of the mind.\n\nOne last aspect of Lucretius\u2019 deification of Epicurus that\nappears to go beyond his status as model is his depiction as the\ngreatest benefactor of humanity in the proem of Book 5. This, however,\nmay owe more to the popularity of Euhemerism at Rome in the first\ncentury B.C. than anything Epicurean. Euhemerus (active c. 300 BCE)\nproposed that the gods of myth had originally been men, who had been\ngranted immortality in recognition of their discoveries or gifts to\nmankind, and whose names recorded their accomplishment, for example\n\u2018Bacchus\u2019 for wine. This rationalistic work had an\nunderstandable vogue in the Hellenistic period, where divinization of\nkings was not infrequent, and had been translated into Latin by\nEnnius. Lucretius claims that Epicurus\u2019 benefactions surpass the\ndiscoveries of agriculture, wine, and even the heroic deeds of\nHeracles, so that he should count as the greatest benefactor of\nmankind. Whereas these benefactors only improved mankind materially,\nEpicurus purged our hearts from troubles and desires (5.49\u201351).\nThe passage is in good part a rhetorical exercise in which Lucretius\nshows that he can beat the Euhemerists at their own game, while also\nsubtly undermining them, since Epicurus hardly strove after\nimmortality, as shown by the past tense fuit (Gale 1994\nappendix 1). More obviously the sequence serves the literary function\nof introducing the main topic of the last third of the book, the\ngrowth of civilisation. But unlike the discoverers celebrated and\nimmortalised by Euhemerus, Lucretius\u2019 discoverers in\n5.1011\u20131457 are all anonymous.\n8. Influence and reception\n\nWhether or not Lucretius operated on the margins of the Roman world,\nthere is no doubt that by the next generation, in poetry at least, his\nwork became mainstream and his influence extensive (Hardie 2009). In\nimperial Latin prose, with the exception of Seneca in his Natural\nQuestions, he is mainly discussed as a\npoet. His transformation into a philosophical source for\nEpicureanism is first seen in the hostile Lactantius and the more\nambivalent Arnobius (Gatzemeier 2013). In Latin poetry he was read\ncontinuously until the end of antiquity (Hardie 2020); his presence in\nlate antique Latin prose remains largely unexplored.\n\nThe DRN reached us through two 9th century\nCarolingian manuscripts both now in Leiden, O and Q (on the early\ntextual history and for discussion of the unusual\n\u2018capitula\u2019 see Butterfield 2013). Lucretius re-entered\ncirculation when he was rediscovered in 1417 by the papal secretary\nPoggio Bracciolini (on the story of that discovery, Greenblatt 2011).\nLater in the same generation the migration of Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nLives of the Philosophers to Italy, followed by its\ntranslation into Latin and various first printings, allowed Epicurean\nideas to be studied first-hand and eventually play a leading but\nhardly exclusive role in the scientific revolution and the rise of\nearly modern moral thought, especially social contract theories (on\nRenaissance dissemination, Palmer 2014 and 2020; on the influence of\nideas, Wilson 2008). Lucretius\u2019 early modern reception is now a\nflourishing scholarly enterprise and most recent collections of essays\non Lucretius have a substantial section devoted to this aspect (for a\nstart, see Gillespie and Hardie 2007 and Mitsis 2020). Though\nEpicurean ideas were suspect, and an easy label for accusations of\natheism and crude hedonism, the DRN was never put on the\nIndex of banned books, so long as it was kept among the learned. But\nearly translations into vernacular languages were banned (Prosperi\n2020). Many of Lucretius\u2019 most open humanist critics were also\nhis best students and editors. Denys Lambin\u2019s watershed 1563\nedition and commentary praises Lucretius as the \u2018sweetest\u2019\nof all Roman poets but points out the \u2018correct\u2019\nAristotelian answer for every Lucretian-Epicurean departure. Montaigne\nstudied Lucretius intently and used the DRN as a regular\nquarry for arguments, see for example the presence of book 3 in his\nessay \u2018Que philosopher, c\u2019est apprendre \u00e0 mourir.\u2019\nPierre Gassendi\u2019s Christianity-compatible atomism, built up out\nof Lucretius and Book 10 of Diogenes Laertius, did more to\nre-establish empiricism and attack Aristotelianism than produce much\nin the way of atomism-based science, although it did open up\ntheoretical space for later scientists, in Britain more so than in\nFrance (Jones 1989).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
