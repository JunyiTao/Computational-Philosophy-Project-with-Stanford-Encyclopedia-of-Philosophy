    "main_text": "Metaethics of Value Judgments || Valuing vs. Evaluation\n2.1 Valuing vs. Evaluation\n\nDewey\u2019s metaethics is grounded in the distinction between\nvaluing and evaluation (also denoted as \u201cprizing\u201d vs.\n\u201cappraising\u201d, or \u201cesteeming\u201d vs.\n\u201cestimating,\u201d). Dewey\u2019s term \u201cvaluation\u201d\ncovers both valuing and evaluation. Valuing, prizing, and esteeming\ndenote \u201caffective-motor attitudes,\u201d, with more emphasis on\n\u201cmotor\u201d than \u201caffective.\u201d Valuing is a matter\nof loving or hating, liking or disliking something, where these\nattitudes involve tendencies to act (LJP 23\u201327). In his later\nwork, Dewey embraced a more uncompromising behavioristic view of\nvaluing that questioned the attribution of inner emotional aspects to\nvaluing (TV 199, 202\u20133).\n\nAt the most primitive level, valuings are tendencies to move toward,\nacquire, or ingest certain things, or, on the negative side, to avoid,\nreject, spew out other things. One need not have any idea of what one\nis valuing in order to value it. Hence, they are less sophisticated\nthan desires, which have propositional content (an end in view) and\narise from practical reflection (TV 207). In the first instance,\nvaluings denote impulses toward or away from objects, as when an\ninfant turns toward human voices, or swats away a fly. Valuings of\nobjects as useful can also be immediate \u2014 that is, not mediated\nby cognition or awareness of what one is doing. One uses a fork to\npick up food, without thinking about it. Habits, then, are also a\nspecies of valuing.\n\nDewey contrasted valuings, which are mostly behavioral, from the\nphilosophical idea of a pleasure or enjoyment, understood as an\nisolated and passive experience. Dewey criticized that idea as arising\nfrom philosophical demands not grounded in experience (LJP\n40\u20131). In reality, when we enjoy something, as when we savor an\nice cream cone, we are actively engaged with it: we roll the ice cream\naround on our tongues, chew the cone, taking note of its texture and\nflavor, explore it on all sides. These activities, not just passive\nexperiences, are part of the pleasure of eating an ice cream cone.\n\nValuings may be expressed in ejaculations. A child may jump up and\ndown, saying \u201c goody! \u201d at an ice cream cone. As a\nspontaneous and uncalculated ejaculation, \u201c goody \u201d does\nnot express a value judgment. The child may say the same thing with\nself-awareness, as if to say \u201cI like ice cream.\u201d Such a\nsubjective report of a valuing still does not express a value\njudgment.\n\nValue judgments arise when valuings are subjected to\nevaluation or appraisal, when one asks the question whether\n(one ought) to value (seek, cherish, consume, etc.) something (TV\n208\u20139; VORC 84\u20136).\n\nThus, value judgments are practical judgments. Although they may have\na descriptive form (\u201cx is good,\u201d\n\u201cx is right\u201d), the constitutive point of making\nthem is to alter or guide our valuings. The need to question our\nvaluings arises when immediate action on them is not possible or\nyields unsatisfactory consequences. There is no more ice cream in the\nrefrigerator; is it worthwhile to go to the store to buy some more?\nOr, the lactose-intolerant person may observe that she gets a stomach\nache after eating ice cream, and discover that ice cream is the cause.\nShould she just give up ice cream, can she take something that avoids\nthe symptoms, or are there lactose-free substitutes? Having sketched\nout some alternative solutions to her predicament, she imaginatively\nfills out the details of acting on them, including their projected\nconsequences (Do the pills have side effects? Does the lactose-free\nice cream taste good?). The consequences are the objects of valuings,\nwhich guide the formation of a new end-in-view, a new valuing \u2014\nsay, to go for lactose-free ice cream, because taking pills would be\nbothersome, and the lactose-free ice cream tastes just as good. The\ncomparative value judgment (\u201ceating lactose-free ice cream is\nbetter than taking pills with regular ice cream, or eating regular ice\ncream alone\u201d) is practical because its function is to guide\nconduct toward the best solution to the person\u2019s problem.\n\nThus, value judgments or appraisals result in new valuings. This fact\nhas two implications, one for the nature of valuing, the other for the\nassessment of value judgments. First, when valuings change in response\nto value judgments, they become desires, interests, or tastes. Second,\nbecause the function of value judgments is to constitute new valuings\nthat solve the individual\u2019s predicament, they can be assessed\ninstrumentally, in terms of how well they perform that function.\n",
