    "main_text": "Climate Data || Reanalyses\n3.2 Reanalyses\n\nIn situ observations of conditions away from earth\u2019s\nsurface are much less plentiful than surface observations.\nRadiosondes, which are balloon-borne instrument packages that ascend\nthrough the atmosphere measuring pressure, temperature, humidity and\nother variables, are now launched twice daily at hundreds of sites\naround the world, but they do not provide even, global coverage\n(Ingleby et al. 2016). Satellite-borne instruments can provide global\ncoverage\u2014and are of significant value in the study of weather\nand climate\u2014but they do not directly measure vertical profiles\nof key climatological variables like temperature; approximate values\nof these variables must be inferred in a complex way from radiance\nmeasurements. A recently-established system of several thousand ocean\nfloats, known as Argo, takes local profiles of temperature\nand salinity in the top 2000 meters of the ocean roughly every 10 days\n(Riser et al. 2016). None of these data sources existed a century ago,\nthough observations of conditions away from earth\u2019s surface were\nsometimes made (e.g., using thermometers attached to kites).\n\nOne way to remedy spatial and temporal gaps in observations is to\nperform statistical interpolation. Beginning in the 1990s, however,\nclimate scientists also began to employ a different type of\nmethodology, known as data assimilation (Kalnay 2003). First\ndeveloped in the context of weather forecasting, data assimilation\nestimates the three-dimensional state of the atmosphere or ocean using\nnot only available observations but also one or more forecasts from a\nphysics-based simulation model. The forecast constitutes a first-guess\nestimate of the atmosphere or ocean state at the time of interest;\nthis is updated in light of observational data collected around that\ntime. In daily weather forecasting, the resulting best estimate is\nknown as the analysis, and it provides initial conditions for\nweather prediction models. To produce long-term datasets for climate\nresearch, data assimilation is performed iteratively for a sequence of\npast times (e.g., every 12 hours over several decades), producing a\nretrospective analysis or reanalysis for each time in the\nsequence (Bengtsson & Shukla 1988; Edwards 2010).\n\nAtmospheric reanalysis datasets are in heavy use in climate research,\nbecause they provide complete gridded data at regular time steps over\nlong time periods, both at the surface and above, for a wide range of\nvariables, including ones that are difficult to measure with\ninstruments. Many reanalysis datasets cover a few decades of the\ntwentieth century and are produced using as much of the available\nobservational data as is feasible (see Dee et al. 2016 for an\noverview); when satellite data are available, this can amount to\nmillions of observations for each analysis period in the sequence. An\ninteresting exception is NOAA\u2019s 20th Century\nReanalysis (20CR) project: it covers the entire twentieth century and\nassimilates only surface pressure observations and observed monthly\nsea surface temperatures and sea ice distribution (Compo et al. 2011).\n20CR is not informed by any temperature observations over land, yet\nits results indicate twentieth century global warming over land\nsimilar to that seen in station-based temperature datasets.\n\n20CR has been described as providing independent\n\u201cobservational\u201d confirmation of the twentieth century\nwarming seen in station-based datasets (Compo et al. 2013). More generally, despite the\ncentral role of computer forecasts in reanalysis, many climate\nscientists refer to reanalysis data as \u201cobservations\u201d and\nuse them as such: to investigate climate system dynamics, to evaluate\nclimate models, to find evidence of the causes of recent climate\nchange, and so on. Other climate scientists, however, emphasize that\nreanalyses should not be confused with \u201creal\u201d observations\n(e.g., Schmidt 2011). Parker (2017) argues that differences between\ndata assimilation and traditional observation and measurement are not\nas great as one might think; she suggests that data assimilation can\nbe understood as a complex measuring procedure that is still under\ndevelopment.\n",
