    "main_text": "Traditional Arguments (B) Con (with Epiphenomenalists\u2019 Responses) || Obvious Absurdity\n2.1 Obvious Absurdity\n\nEpiphenomenalism is absurd; it is just plain obvious that our pains,\nour thoughts, and our feelings make a difference to our (evidently\nphysical) behavior; it is impossible to believe that all our behavior\ncould be just as it is even if there were no pains, thoughts, or\nfeelings. (Taylor, 1963 and subsequent editions, offers a\nrepresentative statement.)\n\nThis argument is surely the briefest of those against\nepiphenomenalism, but it may have been more persuasive than any other.\nEpiphenomenalists, however, can make the following reply. First, it\ncan never be obvious what causes what. Animated cartoons are full of\ncausal illusions. Falling barometers are regularly followed by storms,\nbut do not cause them. More generally, a regularity is causal only if\nit is not explained as a consequence of underlying regularities. It is\npart of epiphenomenalist theory, however, that the regularities that\nwe observe to hold between mental events and actions can be explained\nby underlying regularities. Schematically, suppose physical event\n\\(P_1\\) causes both mental event \\(M\\) and physical successor \\(P_2\\),\nas in Figure 1.\n\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\nM & & & & & & \\\\\n \\uparrow & & & & & & \\\\\n P_1 & \\rightarrow & P_2 & \\rightarrow & P_3 & \\rightarrow & \\cdots \n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nSuppose there is no other cause of \\(M\\), and no other cause of\n\\(P_2\\). Then every \\(M\\) will be followed by \\(P_2\\), yet the cause\nof \\(P_2\\) will be adequately found in \\(P_1\\). It is true that, under\nthe assumptions stated, the counterfactual, \u201cIf \\(M\\) had not\noccurred, then \\(P_2\\) would not have occurred\u201d holds; but then,\nso may \u201cif the barometer had not fallen, the storm would not\nhave occurred.\u201d The moral to be drawn is that causation may\nimply that certain counterfactuals hold, but the holding of\ncounterfactuals is not enough to show causation. Thus, it is true that\nsome of our actions would not have occurred, under normal conditions,\nunless we had had certain mental events. But this fact cannot show\nthat those actions are caused by our mental events (rather than being\ncaused by the physical causes of those mental events).\n\nIt is often said that pains cause withdrawals of affected parts of the\nbody. In extreme cases, however \u2014 for example in a case of\ntouching a hot stove \u2014 it can be observed that the affected part\nis withdrawn before the pain is felt. These cases cannot show\nthat pain never causes withdrawals, but they do show that pain is not\nnecessary as a cause of withdrawals. In less extreme cases, it is open\nto the epiphenomenalist to hold that the causal order is the same as\nin the extreme cases (i.e., some physical event, \\(P_1\\), causes both\nwithdrawal and pain) but is not ordinarily recognized to be so.\n\nA variant of the obvious absurdity objection is that epiphenomenalism\nleads to a feeling of loss of self, or a sense that we can no longer\nregard our actions as ours. (See Hyslop 1998. Baysan [2021]\nargues to the contrary that epiphenomenalism is compatible with\nagency.) Epiphenomenalists may, however, reply that there would be\ndifferent brain states corresponding to the difference between cases\nof moving our bodies and cases of having our body parts moved by\nsomething else, and their view allows different brain states to have\ndifferent phenomenological effects. Epiphenomenalism is also\ncompatible with there being a distinction between actions that proceed\nfrom normal brain processes in normal conditions, and actions that\nproceed from manipulation by others, disease, or situations that\noverwhelm normal reasoning abilities.\n",
