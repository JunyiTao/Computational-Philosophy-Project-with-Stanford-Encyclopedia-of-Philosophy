    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nAs with so many important medieval figures, we know little about\nWilliam\u2019s early years. According to one manuscript source, he\nwas born in Aurillac, in the province of Auvergne in south-central\nFrance. His birth date is unknown, but since he was a professor of\ntheology at the University of Paris by 1225, a position rarely\nattained before the age of 35, he is not likely to have been born\nlater than 1190, and scholars have placed his probable birth date some\ntime between 1180 and 1190. He may have come from a poor background,\nas the Dominican, Stephen of Bourbon (died c. 1261), tells a story of\nWilliam begging as a young child (Valois 1880, 4). He was a canon of\nNotre Dame and a master of theology by 1223, and is mentioned in bulls\nof Pope Honorius III in 1224 and 1225.\n\nThe story of his elevation to the episcopacy in 1228 paints a picture\nof a man of great determination and self-confidence. The previous year\nthe Bishop of Paris, Bartholomeus, had died, and the canons of the\nchapter of Notre Dame met to select his successor. The initial\nselection of a cantor named Nicholas did not secure unanimous\nagreement and was contested, in particular, by William. Nicholas\nexcused himself, and the canons went on to choose the Dean of the\nCathedral. William again contested the election and went to Rome to\nappeal to the Pope to vacate it. He made a favorable impression, for\nthe Pope, impressed by his \u201ceminent knowledge and spotless\nvirtue,\u201d as he put it (Valois 1880, 11), both ordained him\npriest and made him Bishop of Paris, a position he retained until his\ndeath in 1249.\n\nIt was not long before the Pope would have regrets. In February 1229 a\nnumber of students were killed by the forces of the queen-regent,\nBlanche of Castile, when they intervened in a drunken student riot\nduring Carnival. Outraged, the masters and students appealed to\nWilliam for redress of their rights, but William failed to take\naction. The students and masters went on strike, dispersing from Paris\nand appealing to Pope Gregory IX. It was apparently during this period\nthat William gave the Dominicans their first chair in theology at the\nuniversity. The Pope, who was to remark that he regretted\n\u201chaving made this man,\u201d rebuked William, appointed a\ncommission to settle the dispute, and ordered William to reinstate the\nstriking masters. Nevertheless, William went on to receive important\nmissions from the Pope in subsequent years, acting, for example, as a\npapal representative in peace negotiations between France and England\nin 1231.\n\nIn 1239 William was closely involved in the condemnation of the\nTalmud. The Pope had asked him for his response to a list of heresies\nin the Talmud proposed by a converted Jew, Nicholas. William\u2019s\nresponse led to a papal bull ordering the confiscation of sacred books\nfrom synagogues in 1240, and to their burning in 1242 (for details,\nsee Valois 1880, Smith 1992 and de Mayo 2007).\n\nWilliam died at the end of March (the exact date is unsure) in 1249,\nand was buried in the Abbey of St. Victor.\n",
