    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || The Way of Abstraction\n3.3 The Way of Abstraction\n\nAnother methodology is what Lewis calls the way of\nabstraction. According to a longstanding tradition in\nphilosophical psychology, abstraction is a distinctive mental process\nin which new ideas or conceptions are formed by considering the common\nfeatures of several objects or ideas and ignoring the irrelevant\nfeatures that distinguish those objects. For example, if one is given\na range of white things of varying shapes and sizes; one ignores or\nabstracts from the respects in which they differ, and thereby\nattains the abstract idea of whiteness. Nothing in this tradition\nrequires that ideas formed in this way represent or correspond to a\ndistinctive kind of object. But it might be maintained that the\ndistinction between abstract and concrete objects should be explained\nby reference to the psychological process of abstraction or something\nlike it. The simplest version of this strategy would be to say that an\nobject is abstract if it is (or might be) the referent of an abstract\nidea; i.e., an idea formed by abstraction. So conceived, the way\nof abstraction is wedded to an outmoded philosophy of mind.\n\nIt should be mentioned, though, that the key idea behind the way\nof abstraction has resurfaced (though transformed) in the\nstructuralist views about mathematics that trace back to Dedekind.\nDedekind thought of numbers by the way of abstraction.\nDedekind suggested that when defining a number-theoretic structure,\n\u201cwe entirely neglect the special character of the elements,\nmerely retaining their distinguishability and taking into account only\nthe relations to one another\u201d (Dedekind 1888 [1963, 68]). This\nview has led some structuralists to deny that numbers are abstract\nobjects. For example, Benacerraf concluded that \u201cnumbers are not\nobjects at all, because in giving the properties (that is, necessary\nand sufficient) of numbers you merely characterize an abstract\nstructure\u2014and the distinction lies in the fact that the\n\u2018elements\u2019 of the structure have no properties other than\nthose relating them to other \u2018elements\u2019 of the same\nstructure\u201d (1965, 70). We shall therefore turn our attention to\na variant of the way of abstraction, one that has led a\nnumber of philosophers to conclude that numbers are indeed abstract\nobjects.\n",
