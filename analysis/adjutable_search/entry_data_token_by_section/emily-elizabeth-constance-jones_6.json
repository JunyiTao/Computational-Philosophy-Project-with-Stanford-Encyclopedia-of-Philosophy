    "main_text": "Comparison with Frege and Russell || Comparison with Frege\n3.1 Comparison with Frege\n\nIn the opening paragraph of \u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d\n(Frege 1892), Frege argues that a theory that identifies the semantic\nvalue of a name with its referent\u2014the na\u00efve\ntheory\u2014cannot differentiate between the contents of\n\u2018Hesperus = Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019. Given the plausible assumption that the proposition\nexpressed by a sentence is a function of the semantic values of its\nconstituent expressions together with their mode of combination, it\nseems inevitable that what the latter sentence says is just what the\nformer sentence says\u2014assuming, with the na\u00efve theory, that\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 possess the same\nsemantic value. Of course, the latter sentence is potentially\ninformative, whereas the former sentence is not. This leads Frege to\nreject the na\u00efve theory. He also rejects, for reasons that need\nnot detain us, a view according to which identity is a relation\nbetween the names \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019. The view he settles on is that the\ncontribution that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 makes to the propositions\nexpressed by the above-quoted identity sentences is a sense\n\u2014a way of thinking of the referent. (While one might say that\nthe semantic value of \u2018Hesperus\u2019 is the\nassociated sense, this would be incorrect, since, on Frege\u2019s\nview, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 has two semantic values\u2014its sense,\nand the referent determined by this sense. The proposition expressed\nby, e.g., \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is partly determined by\nthis sense, whereas the referent of this sentence\u2014for Frege, its\ntruth-value\u2014is partly determined by the associated\nreferent.)\n\nJones\u2019s argument is similar, but not identical, to\nFrege\u2019s. She argues that a theory that assimilates all assertion\nto A is A must fail to account for cases of\nsignificant assertion\u2014cases in which we go beyond \u201cpure\ntautology\u201d. Frege\u2019s argument is more sophisticated, making\nimplicit appeal to a principle of compositionality, and considering\nalternative theories of the semantic contents of singular terms.\nStill, both are concerned to correct a similar\u2014perhaps the\nsame\u2014mistake. Indeed, Jones\u2019s and Frege\u2019s interest\nin identity may derive from a common source, namely Lotze. (See\nGabriel 2002 and Heis 2013 for assessments of Lotze\u2019s role in the\ndevelopment of Frege\u2019s thought.)\n",
