It is more\nplausible to go the other way, analysing \u2018natural class\u2019\nas \u2018class whose members are collectively natural\u2019. The\ntask of explaining plural naturalness in terms of the naturalness of\nproperties raises similar difficulties to that of explaining the\nnaturalness of classes.\n",
