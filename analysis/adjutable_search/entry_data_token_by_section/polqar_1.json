    "main_text": "Polqar and Abner of Burgos: Judaism vs. Christianity\n2. Polqar and Abner of Burgos: Judaism vs. Christianity\n\nPolqar\u2019s objection to Abner\u2019s decision to abandon the\nfaith of his birth and to accept Christianity stems from his view that\na true religion cannot, under any circumstances, contradict basic\nphilosophical principles. Christianity, for Polqar, does contradict\nthose principles, and so it follows that Christianity is not a true\n religion:[8]\n\n\nThe essential principle and purpose of all knowledge in the view of\nall nations is the knowledge of the existence of God, may He be\nblessed, through whose power the encompassing sphere is moved. This\nwas first explained by our religion in the verse \u201cI am the\nLord\u201d [Exod. 20:2]. The second principle is His unity. This is\nexplained in the verse \u201cyou shall have no other gods before\nme\u201d [Exod. 20:3] and in the verse \u201cHear O Israel! The Lord\nis our God, the Lord is One\u201d [Deut. 6:4]. The third principle is\nthat He has no body, which is also known and revealed in the verse\n\u201cTake therefore good heed to yourself: for you saw no manner of\nform\u201d [Deut. 4:15], and also that He is not a force within a\nbody, in the sense that nothing that happens to dark bodies can be\nverified of Him, which is known and evident from the verse \u201cI\nthe Lord have not changed\u201d [Mal. 3:6]. It is known by every\nintelligent person that these beliefs are explained with firm proofs\nand full demonstration in the books about physics and metaphysics\nwritten by Aristotle, as is obvious to those who make the effort to\nstudy them, so that no one will reject them and deny them unless he is\na denier of the first principle, which the ancient sages considered to\nbe punishable by stoning. (Teshuvat Apikoros: 2b; cf.\n\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 35\u201336)\n\n\nThe philosophers, Polqar claims, have already demonstrated\n\u201cthese beliefs\u201d, that is, the three philosophical\nprinciples: the existence of God, His Unity, and His being neither a\nbody nor a force in a body, principles that were fully maintained by\nJews. While Christians sought to reconcile these principles with their\ntheological doctrines, their attempts to do so were unsuccessful in\nPolqar\u2019s view.\n\nPolqar\u2019s fundamental objection to Christianity as contradicting\nphilosophical principles is reflected in his disputes with Abner\nregarding (1) monotheism vs. the Trinity, and (2) God\u2019s\nincorporeality vs. the Incarnation.\n\nWhile Christianity, as perceived by Polqar, accepts the existence of\nGod, it rejects the other two principles\u2014God\u2019s unity and\nincorporeality\u2014because of its acceptance of the doctrines of the\nTrinity and the Incarnation. Hence, Christianity cannot be a true\nreligion. Polqar presents his critique chiefly in the second chapter\nof Teshuvat Apikoros and in the second section of treatise\none of \u02bfEzer ha-Dat, where he enumerates the three\nprinciples that should form the foundation of any true religion.\nAlthough he does not explicitly mention Christianity, we can\nconfidently assume, based on Abner\u2019s reference to this chapter\nin his Teshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref, that the object of this\ncritique is the Christian believer.\n",
