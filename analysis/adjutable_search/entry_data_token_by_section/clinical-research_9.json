    "main_text": "Industry Sponsored Research\n10. Learning Health Care\n\nLike most early clinical research, James Lind\u2019s experiments on\ntreatments for scurvy took place in the clinical setting, with a\nphysician evaluating different possible treatments in his patients.\nThis practice eventually led to concern that it did not offer\nsufficient protection for patients who were frequently unaware that\nthey were involved in research. And this concern led to separating\nclinical research from clinical care and subjecting it to\nsignificantly more extensive regulations, including independent review\nand extensive consent. This approach offered greater protections for\nresearch participants and likely led to more sophisticated clinical\ntrials as the result of being conducted by dedicated researchers\nrather than clinicians in their spare time. \n\nThis segregation of clinical research from clinical care has also had\nsignificant drawbacks. It makes clinical research much more expensive\nand much more difficult to conduct. Given that studies are conducted\nin specialized environments, this approach has also undermined to some\nextent the relevance that the findings of clinical trials have for\nclinical care. For example, clinical trials assessing possible new\ntreatments for hypertension are conducted in individuals who are aware\nthat the trials exist and take the time to find out what is required\nto enroll. These studies frequently have trouble enrolling sufficient\nnumbers of participants and take years to complete. At the same time,\non the other side of the clinical research/clinical care divide,\nmillions of patients with hypertension who might be eligible for a\nclinical trial are obtaining care from their doctors. Moreover, the\ncountless data points generated by these encounters, what dose did the\npatient receive, did they experience any side effects, how long did\nthey last, end up gathering dust in the patients\u2019 medical\nrecords rather than being systematically collected and used to inform\nfuture practice.\n\nIn response, commentators have called for developing learning health\ncare systems. According to one definition, a learning health care\nsystem is one in which \u201cscience, informatics, incentives, and\nculture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with\nbest practices seamlessly embedded in the care process, patients and\nfamilies active participants in all elements, and new knowledge\ncaptured as an integral by-product of the care experience\u201d\n(Committee on Learning 2013). The important point for present purposes\nis that these commentators are calling for the desegregation of\nclinical research and clinical care, with clinical research once again\nbeing conducted in the context of clinical care. This approach offers\nwhat seems a potentially appealing response to the central challenge\nof justifying the risks to which research participants are exposed.\nPut simply, this practice would be justified by the fact that the\npractice of exposing individuals to research risks is an essential\ncomponent of a learning health care system which continuously\nevaluates methods of providing clinical care and passes the benefits\nof the improvements on to its members (Faden et al 2013).\n\nThe segregated model of clinical research was designed to protect\nresearch participants from exploitation. The primary drawbacks are\nthat it is inefficient and it raises concerns over free riders,\nallowing patients to realize the benefits of improved clinical care\nwithout having to accept any of the risks associated with its\ngeneration. Learning health care systems are intended to address the\nproblem of inefficiency. Given that all the members of learning health\ncare systems are possible research participants and also beneficiaries\nof research, they may, in the process, address concerns over free\nriders. \n\nThe ethical challenge learning health care systems face is whether it\nis possible to do away with the segregated model, along with its\nregulations and practices, without reintroducing the potential for\nparticipant exploitation. For example, should individuals in a\nlearning health care system be told that their data might be used for\nresearch purposes? Should they be notified when it is? To what extent\ncan patients in learning health care systems be exposed to added risks\nfor the purposes of research? Should they be permitted to decline\nbeing so exposed? In the end, then, on-going attempts to address the\nconcerns raised by clinical research raise new ethical concerns and,\nthereby, offer opportunities for philosophers and others looking for\ninteresting, not to mention practically important issues in need of\nanalysis and resolution. \n",
