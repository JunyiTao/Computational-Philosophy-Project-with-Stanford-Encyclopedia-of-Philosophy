    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophers have always lived among, and often as, people who could\nnot see, walk, or hear; who had limited mobility, comprehension or\nlongevity, or chronic illnesses of various sorts. And philosophers\nhave lived in societies that respond to these and other bodily\ndifferences in a wide variety of ways. And yet philosophical interest\nin these conditions and the social response to them was piecemeal and\noccasional until the past hundred or so years. Some of these\nconditions were cited in litanies of life\u2019s hardships or evils;\nsome were the vehicle for inquiries into the relationship between\nhuman faculties and human knowledge (see entry on\n Molyneux\u2019s problem).\n But the treatment of disability as a subject of philosophical\ninterest in its own right is relatively new.\n\nThe lack of attention to \u201cdisability\u201d or the related\nconcept of \u201cimpairment\u201d may have a simple explanation:\nthere were no such concepts to attend to until nineteenth century\nscientific thinking put variations in human function and form into\ncategories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were\nestablished, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about (first)\n\u201cthe disabled\u201d, and (then) \u201ctheir\nimpairments\u201d, and philosophers have done so for various purposes\n[Hacking, 1990; L. Davis, 2002: Ch. 4]). The resurgent political\nphilosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with\neliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat\ndisability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed\nwith medical correction or government compensation (Cohen 1993; Sen\n1993). Somewhat later, social philosophers began to see disability as\na source both of discrimination and oppression, and of group identity,\nakin to race or gender in these respects. And biomedical and other\npractical applied\u2019 ethicists have been concerned to help\npolicy-makers construct and interpret new legal and regulatory\nframeworks making central reference to \u201cdisability\u201d and\nrelated concepts.\n\nFor these reasons and others, philosophers have had much to say,\ninitially in passing and now at length, about what disability is and\nwhat \u201cdisability\u201d means. This entry will discuss both\nissues\u2014first, detailing philosophical engagement with\nlongstanding debates over the correct \u201cmodel\u201d or general\nframework for understanding disability as a phenomenon; second, asking\nhow philosophers have come to understand the meaning of concepts\ndenoted by words like \u201cdisability\u201d and\n\u201cimpairment\u201d, as those have been used in various empirical\nand normative discourses concerning people with disabilities.\n",
