    "main_text": "Motivating and Explanatory Reasons || Motivating Reasons\n3.1 Motivating Reasons\n\nThe term \u201cmotivating reason\u201d is a semi-technical\nphilosophical term. As we saw above, the phrase is now generally used\nin the literature to refer to a reason that the agent takes to favour\nher action, and in light of which she acts. Motivating reasons are\nalso considerations that can figure as premises in the practical\nreasoning, if any, that leads to action. The terms \u201cagential\nreason\u201d, \u201cthe agent\u2019s normative reason\u201d,\n\u201csubjective (normative) reasons\u201d, \u201cthe agent\u2019s\noperative reason\u201d and \u201cpossessed reasons\u201d are\nsometimes also used to capture this notion of a reason. Because the\nconcept is somewhat technical, further clarification is needed.\n\nFirst, the current use of the term excludes some otherwise plausible\ncandidates from being motivating reasons. For instance,\nsomeone\u2019s goal or intention in acting, which is something the\nagent desires (to grow vegetables; to kill Desdemona) seem to be\nmotivating factors in acting. But because these are not considerations\nin light of which one acts, they do not fall under the category\n\u201cmotivating reasons\u201d as currently understood (but see Audi\n1993). Similarly, a state of desiring (wanting to have one\u2019s\nrevenge), or a motive or emotion (for instance, jealousy) can be\nstates \u201cthat encompass motivation\u201d, to use Mele\u2019s\nphrase, 2003: if one is in any such a mental state, one is thereby\nmotivated to act. But again, these are not motivating reasons in the\nsense at issue because they are not considerations that the agent\ntakes to favour acting. Moreover, many hold that states of desiring\nare often grounded in considerations about the goodness or value of\nwhat is desired\u2014a view defended by Anscombe 1957, Nagel 1970,\nQuinn 1993, Raz 1999, and Schueler 2003, among others. When this is\nso, the motivating reasons both for wanting and for acting accordingly\nare the considerations about the goodness or rightness of what is\ndesired. To continue with our example, Othello\u2019s desire to kill\nDesdemona is grounded in the thoughts that she is unfaithful to him\nand that killing her is a fitting way to restore his reputation (even\nif the desire is intensified by his jealousy). These considerations\nare his reason for wanting to kill her and his reason for doing so. In\nshort, what Othello desires (to kill Desdemona), his goal (to redress\nher betrayal), his state of desiring those things, or his motive\n(jealousy) are things that motivate him to kill Desdemona but they are\nnot his motivating reasons in the semi-technical sense of the phrase\nstipulated above. His motivating reasons, if we agree he has any, are,\nrather, the putative facts that she is unfaithful to him and that\nkilling her is a fitting way to restore his reputation.\n\nSecond, talk of an agent\u2019s motivating reason, or of \u201cthe\nagent\u2019s reason\u201d, always involves some simplification.\nIt\u2019s a simplification because an agent may be motivated to act\nby more than one reason: I may hoover the house early in the morning\nboth because I won\u2019t have time to do it later and because it\nwill annoy my inconsiderate neighbour. Moreover, a fact will seem a\nreason for me to act only in combination with other facts: that I\nwon\u2019t have time to hoover later will seem a reason to do it now\nonly if the house needs hovering. So my reason is, arguably, a\ncombination of at least two facts: that the house needs hovering and\nthat I won\u2019t be able to do it later. Finally, I may consider a\nfact that counts against acting, for instance, that hoovering early\nwill also disturb my other neighbour, who is very considerate. If I\nstill decide to hoover, I do not act for that \u201ccon-reason\u201d\nbut, arguably, I am still guided by it if I give it some weight in my\ndeliberation (see Ruben 2009 for a discussion of\n\u201ccon-reasons\u201d).\n\nSince motivating reasons are considerations that an agent takes to\nfavour acting, and since the reasons that favour acting are facts, it\nmight seem that motivating reasons are also facts or at least putative\nfacts, rather than mental states. However, the view that they are\nmental states was, as noted earlier, the dominant view till the turn\nof the 20th century, and it is still very popular today. A\nseemingly compelling argument for adopting psychologism for motivating\nreasons is the following. For a reason to motivate you it must be a\nreason you have. This does not require that the reason should\ngenuinely apply to you. But it requires that you \u201cpossess\u201d\nthe reason: you must know or believe the consideration that\nconstitutes the reason. And this appears to support the view that\nreasons are mental states of agents, or facts about those states. The\nopponent of psychologism about motivating reasons can respond by\nnoting that, while it is true that, for it to motivate you to act, you\nmust know or believe the thing that constitutes a reason, that\ndoesn\u2019t imply that the reason that motivates you is your knowing\nor believing what you do. Rather your reason is what is known or\nbelieved: a (putative) fact. To put the point differently, motivating\nreasons are the contents of mental states but not mental states\nthemselves. This argument about motivating reasons is not, therefore,\ndecisive for psychologism. And in fact, there are several compelling\narguments against psychologism.\n\nA very influential argument, found in Dancy 1995 and 2000, focuses on\nthe relation between normative and motivating reasons. The argument\nhinges on Dancy\u2019s claim that any account of motivating reasons\nmust meet what he calls \u201cthe normative constraint\u201d:\n\n\nThis [normative constraint] requires that a motivating reason, that in\nthe light of which one acts, must be the sort of thing that is capable\nof being among the reasons in favour of so acting; it must, in this\nsense, be possible to act for a good reason. (2000: 103)\n\n\nDancy\u2019s charge against psychologism about motivating reasons is\nthat it fails to meet the constraint because, if psychologism is\nright, we can never act for a good reason. Why? In order to act for a\ngood reason, we need to act for a reason that is or could be a fact.\nHowever, according to psychologism, motivating reasons are mental\nstates. If so, the reasons for which we act are mental states, and not\nfacts. If, by contrast, motivating reasons were, say facts and\nputative facts, then some of the reasons for which we act would be\nfacts, and it would follow that we can, and sometimes do, act for a\ngood reason. But in saying that motivating reasons are mental states,\npsychologism eliminates this possibility, for a mental state can never\nbe a fact. As Dancy puts it, psychologism has the consequence that\n\u201cthe reasons why we act can never be among the reasons in favour\nof acting\u201d (2000: 105). The argument relies on the\n\u201cidentity thesis\u201d about reasons: the thesis that you act\nfor a good reason, only if your motivating reason is identical to the\nnormative reason that favours your action (see Heuer 2004 for a\nhelpful explanation).\n\nDancy (2000: 106ff.) considers a possible response: that acting for a\ngood reason may simply require your motivating reason to be a mental\nstate whose content is a good reason. So, you act for a good reason if\nyour motivating reason for, say, taking your umbrella is your\nbelieving that it is raining, which is a mental state whose\ncontent\u2014\u201cit is raining\u201d\u2014is a good reason to\ntake your umbrella. The success of this response to Dancy\u2019s\nargument is unclear. On the one hand, if the response is that the\nreasons that motivate us are the contents of our mental\nstates of believing, this meets the normative constraint but it does\nnot favour psychologism. It meets the normative constraint because the\ncontent is the fact that it is raining and that is a good\nreason. But this interpretation amounts to abandoning psychologism\nbecause the contents of mental states are not themselves mental\nstates. On the other hand, the response might be just the assertion\nthat a mental state with the right content can be a good reason for\nacting. But this does not seem so much a response to Dancy\u2019s\nargument as a refusal to engage with it. For it remains unclear how,\naccording to this response, we can ever act for a good (i.e., a\nnormative) reason (but see Mantel 2014 for an attempt to develop the\nobjection by rejecting the identity thesis).\n\nThis brings us to another, related argument against psychologism,\nwhich is simply that consideration of what agents take their reasons\nfor acting to be, and of what they typically give and accept as their\nreasons for acting, count against psychologism. Thus, as Othello\nconsiders what to do, even while in the grip of his jealousy, his\nreasoning does not include considerations about whether he believes\nthis or that but rather considerations about what Desdemona has or has\nnot done. The things that Othello considers, then, are not his mental\nstates but rather facts, or alleged facts, about the world around him,\nin particular about Desdemona. This argument is reinforced by\nconsidering that motivating reasons are the reasons that would figure\nas premises in a reconstruction of the agent\u2019s practical\nreasoning, if any. Again, these premises are sometimes considerations\nto the effect that one believes this or that; but much more often,\nthey are considerations about the world, about the value or goodness\nof things and people around us, the means of achieving those things,\netc. In short, although practical reasoning sometimes includes\npsychological facts about oneself among its premises, much more often\nthese premises refer to (perceived or real) facts about the world\nbeyond our minds.\n\nThese arguments lend substantial support to non-psychologism and\nsuggest that being motivated by a reason is not acting in light of, or\nguided by, a mental state, or by a fact about one\u2019s mental\nstates. Along with other arguments, they have led many philosophers (see Alvarez 2008, 2009b, 2010; Bittner 2001; Dancy 2000, 2008; Hornsby 2007, 2008: Hyman 1999, 2015;\nMcDowell 2013; Raz 1999; Schueler 2003; Stout 1996; Stoutland 1998;\nWilliamson 2000, among others) to reject psychologism. But non-psychologism is not free from difficulties. A central problem for non-psychologism is presented by\n\u201cerror cases\u201d. If motivating reasons are facts, then\nwhat is the agent\u2019s reason in cases, like\nOthello\u2019s, where the agent is in error and is motivated to act\nby a false consideration? In such a case, what the agent would give as\nhis reason\u2014say, that Desdemona has been unfaithful\u2014is\nfalse. So, Othello cannot act in light of the fact that Desdemona has\nbeen unfaithful. And non-psychologism does not seem to have a ready\nanswer to what the motivating reason is in these cases.\n\nNon-psychologists have offered different proposals to accommodate\nerror cases. One proposal is to say that in error cases agents act for\na reason that is a falsehood that the agent believes. So, in the\nexample above, Othello\u2019s reason is his false belief about\nDesdemona. Note\u2014not his believing that she\u2019s unfaithful,\nwhich would bring us back to psychologism, but his false belief (the\ncontent). According to this proposal, then, Othello did act for a\nreason: a false belief, which is a putative fact that the agent takes\nto be a fact. The view is defended or at least endorsed by many, among\nothers: Dancy (2000, 2008, 2014), Hornsby (2007, 2008), McDowell\n(2013), Schroeder (2008), Setiya (2007), and Comesa\u00f1a and\nMcGrath (2014). Jennifer Hornsby defends the view in the process of\noffering a disjunctive conception of a reason for acting, analogous to\nMcDowell\u2019s \u201cdisjunctive conception of appearances\u201d\n(Hornsby 2008: 251), summarized in the following passage:\n\n\nWe now have the two answers to the question What is a reason for\nacting? Reasons for acting are given when facts are\nstated: let us call these \u201c(F)-type reasons\u201d. Reasons for\nacting are given when it is said what an agent believes: let\nus call these \u201c(B)-type reasons\u201d. (2008: 247)\n\n\nThis response to problem of error cases is plausible but there are\nalso considerations against it. One such consideration is that stating\nthese alleged reasons often leads to paradox or infelicitous claims.\nFor many would argue that a claim such as \u201cEllie\u2019s reason\nfor stepping on your toes is that you are stepping on her toes,\nalthough you are not stepping on her toes\u201d is paradoxical. By\ncontrast, there is no air of paradox whatsoever in the corresponding\nclaim about Ellie\u2019s beliefs: \u201cEllie believes that\nyou\u2019re stepping on her toes although you are not\u201d. Thus,\nUnger writes: \n\n\nit is inconsistent to say \u201cHis reason was that the store was\ngoing to close, but it wasn\u2019t going to close\u201d. (1975: 208)\n\n\nIf this is right, then the operator \u201cher reason is that\n\u2026\u201d, unlike \u201cher belief is that \u2026\u201d is\nfactive: the truth of the propositions expressed by sentences formed\nwith \u201cher reason is that\u2026\u201d requires the truth of\nthe proposition expressed with the \u201cthat\u201d clause. This\nresponse to the error cases\u2014that a reason can be a\nfalsehood\u2014is therefore problematic.\n\nA related difficulty is that this view commits one to awkward claims\nabout reasons, such as Dancy\u2019s claim that one\u2019s reason for\nacting may be \u201ca reason that is no reason\u201d (Dancy 2000: 3;\nhe qualifies this with the parenthesis \u201cno good reason, that\nis\u201d), or Hornsby\u2019s claim that sometimes it is the case\nthat \u201cthere was no reason to do what he did, even though he did\nit for a reason\u201d (Hornsby 2008: 249; though again, she clarifies\nthat the first clause denies that there is an \u201cF-type\u201d\nreason, a fact, while the second asserts that the agent had a\n\u201cB-type\u201d). The awkwardness of these claims is further\nsupported by considerations about usage, for it seems that claims\nabout what someone\u2019s reason is are often retracted and qualified\non learning that the person was mistaken concerning what he or she\nbelieved. If I say that Lisa\u2019s reason for attending the party is\nthat James will be there, and you tell me that he won\u2019t be at\nthe party, it would sound paradoxical if I insist that her reason is\nthat James will be at the party.\n\nThe fact that these claims about reasons are prima facie\nparadoxical or infelicitous is not a decisive argument against the\nviews that generate them, but it has led some non-psychologists to\noffer alternative accounts of error cases. One such alternative says\nthat, in error cases, an agent acts on something that he treats as a\nreason and in light of which he acts but which is in fact not a\nreason. So, in these cases an agent acts for an \u201capparent\nreason\u201d (Alvarez 2010 and Williamson forthcoming). The view is\nalso defended by Parfit, who characterizes apparent reasons as\nfollows: \u201cWe have some apparent reason when we have some belief\nwhose truth would give us that reason\u201d (2001: 25). On this view,\nan apparent motivating reason is not merely a bad reason but simply\nnot a reason. So according to this alternative, agents who act on\nfalse beliefs are motivated by something, a false belief. They treat\nthat belief as a reason and are guided by it in acting. Nonetheless,\nthat false belief is not a motivating reason because it is not a fact,\nbut merely an apparent fact, and hence only an apparent reason.\n\nIt might appear that the difference between these two\nnon-psychological alternatives boils down to just a terminological\ndispute: some philosophers choose to call these false beliefs\n\u201cfalse\u201d, \u201csubjective\u201d, or \u201cbad\nreasons\u201d, etc., while others choose to call them \u201capparent\nreasons\u201d. Surely, the thought would go, terminology is a matter\nof choice and nothing of substance depends on this choice. What\nmatters is that every proposal contains clear definitions of how terms\nare being used. A response would be that some terminological choices\nare more apt than others because they reflect a more nuanced or\nprecise understanding of the relevant concept. The substantial issue\nbehind this debate seems to be whether the notion of a reason we apply\nin different contexts is a unified notion. If it is, the choice\nbetween the alternative non-psychological views outlined in the\nprevious paragraphs will depend largely on what features are taken to\nbe essential to that notion.\n\nWe noted above that most if not all accounts of acting for a\nmotivating reason require as a condition that the agent be in some\nkind of epistemic relation to the reason that motivates her. And we\nsaw also that a widespread view is that this epistemic relation is one\nof belief: for an agent to act for the reason that p, the agent must\nbelieve that p. It is this thought that led many to endorse the view\nthat reasons are mental states (often as part of the\n\u201cdesire-belief\u201d conception of reasons for action described\nabove). But the view that mere belief is not sufficient to act for a\nreason has gained popularity in recent years. And many have argued\nthat, in order to act in light of a fact that is a reason, an agent needs to\n know the relevant fact. The view is explicitly\ndefended by Unger (1975), Hyman (1999, 2011 and 2015), Williamson\n(2000 and forthcoming), Hornsby (2007 and 2008 (as part of her\ndisjunctive conception mentioned above)), and McDowell\n(2013)\u2014but many others also endorse it. The basic idea behind\nthis position is that an agent may act on the basis of a belief merely\nby treating that belief (i.e., what she believes) as a reason for\nacting. However, if there is a fact in virtue of which her belief is\ntrue, then she acts in light of that fact, or is guided by that fact,\nonly if she knows that fact. If the agent does not know the fact, we\ncannot say that she was guided by it (Hyman), or that she was\nresponding rationally to it (McDowell). If the agent does not know the\nfact, the argument goes, the relationship between the agent\u2019s\nacting as she did and the fact is fortuitous, a matter of luck or\ncoincidence, and hence not sufficient for the fact to be her reason\nfor acting. And this, they argue, is so even in cases where an agent\nacts motivated by a belief that is both true and justified. For just\nas Gettier (1963) showed that having a justified true belief is not\nsufficient for having knowledge of the corresponding fact, so, these\nauthors argue, acting on a justified true belief is not enough for\nacting in light of the corresponding fact: the connection between the\nfact and the action is fortuitous. (See entries on\n the analysis of knowledge\n and\n epistemology\n for discussions of Gettier\u2019s arguments).\n\nThose who think that acting for a reason requires merely treating\nsomething one believes as a ground, e.g., using it as a premise in\none\u2019s reasoning, reject this characterisation of acting for a\nreason\u2014Dancy (2011 and 2014) is an example. But defenders of the\nknowledge condition complain that Dancy\u2019s remarks are\noff-target. For their point is that there is a notion of acting for a\nreason\u2014arguably, the central notion\u2014that involves the idea\nof acting guided by a fact. This notion requires not mere belief but\nknowledge of the fact that is a reason. Others have argued that it is,\nhowever, possible to accept that there is this distinctive, central\nnotion of acting for a reason but still deny that an agent needs to\nknow a fact in order to act guided by it. Dustin Locke (2015), for\nexample, argues that it is possible for someone to act guided by a\nfact that he does not know. Locke uses so-called\n\u201cfake-barn\u201d cases to make his point against the knowledge\ncondition. These cases are due to Alvin Goldman (1967) who developed\nthem in his defence of his theory of knowledge. Suppose that a man is\ndriving in the countryside and sees a barn. Unbeknown to him,\nhe\u2019s driving in \u201cfake-barn country\u201d, which is\nlittered with fake barns: barn fa\u00e7ades designed to look like\nreal barns. The widely held consensus is that a person in a fake-barn\nsituation who, on seeing a real barn, forms the belief that there is a\nbarn, does not know that there is a barn, even though he has a\njustified true belief to that effect. Locke uses this sort of case to\nargue that a person in this situation could, for instance, drive\ntowards a barn guided by the fact that there is a barn over there,\nwithout knowing that there is. If so, Locke claims, the agent acts for\nthe reason that there is a barn over there, since he is guided by that\nfact. Nonetheless, he doesn\u2019t know that there is a barn. (For\nfurther discussion of practical reasoning, the knowledge condition and\nfake-barn situations see Hawthorne 2004, Brown 2008 and Neta\n2009.)\n\nThese debates about motivating reasons focus primarily on what sort of\nthing motivating reasons are and what it takes for an agent to act for\na reason. We now turn to when and how reasons explain actions.\n",
