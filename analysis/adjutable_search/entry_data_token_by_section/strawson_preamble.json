    "main_text": "\n\nPeter Frederick Strawson (1919\u20132006) was an important and\ninfluential philosopher of the late twentieth century.  His writings\nrange over philosophical logic, the philosophy of language,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and the history of philosophy.  Across these\ndebates, Strawson aimed to identify the most fundamental concepts\ninvolved in our ordinary ways of thinking. He took these to include\nsuch core concepts as those of body, person, space and time, and\ncausation. Strawson aimed to show both that sceptical challenges to\nour use of such concepts are spurious and unwarranted and also that\nour entitlement to use these concepts does not depend on their being\nreduced to some supposedly more naturalistically acceptable basis,\nsuch as experience as conceived of by the empiricists, or the concepts\ninvolved in fundamental science. According to Strawson, the proper task\nof metaphysics is to describe these indispensable notions and their\ninterconnections. His work was influential in moving Oxford philosophy\naway from the anti-metaphysical work of A.J. Ayer and J.L. Austin\ntowards a re-engagement with many traditional philosophical questions.\nStrawson\u2019s work continues to command attention. \n",
