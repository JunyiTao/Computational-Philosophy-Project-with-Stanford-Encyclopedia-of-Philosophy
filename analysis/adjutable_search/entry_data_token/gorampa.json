Life and Works\n\nGorampa was born in 1429 in eastern Tibet. At age nineteen, he\ntraveled to central Tibet to pursue monastic studies. He briefly\nattended Nalendra monastery, one of the prominent Sakya monastic\ninstitutions in Tibet, where he studied Madhyamaka texts with the\nscholar Rongton Sheja Kunrig (Rong ston Shes bya Kun rigs,\n1367\u20131449). Rongton passed away the following summer, and\nGorampa began to travel throughout central Tibet, studying with a\nnumber of other teachers. In addition to becoming a skilled\nphilosopher, Gorampa mastered a variety of Tantric practices,\nincluding the Lamdre (lam \u2018bras), the defining practice\nof the Sakya School.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Gorampa became a teacher, and in 1473 he\nfounded Thubten Namgyal Ling Monastery, developing a curriculum that\nemphasized both rigorous philosophical education and thorough training\nin meditative practices. Gorampa later spent four years as the sixth\nabbot of Ewam Choden, the primary institution of the Ngor subsect of\nthe Sakya school. He died in 1489.\n\nGorampa lived during a period of political instability in Tibet. From\n1244 until 1354, the Sakya sect had held political control over Tibet,\nand was backed by the support of the Mongol army. Eventually the\nMongolian court\u2019s interest in Tibet weakened, and the Pagmodruk\nsect of Tibetan Buddhism ousted the Sakyapas from power in a violent\nconfrontation. The Pagmodrukpas continued to rule over Tibet for over\na century, but by the latter half of Gorampa\u2019s life, they had\nfallen from power, resulting in a number of groups fiercely competing\nfor religious and political dominance.\n\nGorampa composed his philosophical texts, therefore, at a time in\nwhich the Sakya sect was struggling to re-assert its dominance.\nAlthough verifiable information about the political motivations of the\nSakyapas remains elusive, the unstable political situation in Tibet\ncould have at least partially accounted for the overtly polemical\nnature of some of Gorampa\u2019s philosophical writings. When the\nGelugpas eventually ascended to political power in the sixteenth\ncentury, the fifth Dalai Lama ordered that Gorampa\u2019s texts,\nwhich were so critical of Tsongkhapa, be destroyed or otherwise\nremoved from monastic institutions. However, many of Gorampa\u2019s\ntexts continued to be studied in eastern Tibet, beyond the Central\nTibetan government\u2019s scope of influence.\n\nWhen work began on the republication of Gorampa\u2019s writings in\n1905, thirteen volumes of texts were recovered from monasteries\nthroughout Tibet. In addition to his works on Madhyamaka philosophy,\nGorampa composed a number of treatises on Abhidharma, several\ncommentaries on the Indian text the\nAbhisamay\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra, and various practice texts\nbased on Tantra. Gorampa\u2019s complete Madhyamaka texts comprise\nonly two of these thirteen volumes. These are:\n\nDistinguishing the View (lta ba\u2019i shan\n\u2018byed), a polemical text distinguishing Gorampa\u2019s own\nview from those of Tsongkhapa (Tsong kha pa bLo bzang Grags pa,\n1357\u20131419) and Dolpopa (Dol po pa Shes rab rGyal mtshan,\n1292\u20131361);\nElucidating the View (lta ba ngan sel), a\ncommentary on the Indian scholar Candrak\u012brti\u2019s\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra;\nSynopsis of Madhyamaka (dbu ma\u2019i spyi\ndon), an encyclopedic text outlining Gorampa\u2019s views on the\nmajor points of Madhyamaka, as well as the views of a number of Indian\nand Tibetan scholars with whom he both agrees and disagrees.\n The main difference in these texts concerns the ways in which\nGorampa presents his philosophical view. Distinguishing the\nView is a polemical text in which Gorampa focuses on the\nmetaphysics of Madhyamaka, positioning his own interpretation as a\nsort of middle way between other interpretations that cast Madhyamaka\nin terms of nihilism or eternalism. Elucidating the View\nfocuses on the process through which a follower of Madhyamaka\ntransforms her mind as she progresses toward complete awakening.\nSynopsis of Madhyamaka presents Gorampa\u2019s interpretation\nof Madhyamaka in three ways: ontologically, in terms of its grounding\n(bzhi) in the two truths; ethically, in terms of the path\n(lam) that a Buddhist must follow; and epistemologically, in\nterms of the mental content that a Buddha experiences as a result\n(\u2018bras bu) of complete awakening.\n\n\nDespite the different emphases of these three texts, Gorampa\u2019s\ngeneral presentation of Madhyamaka remains consistent throughout his\nwritings. This is especially striking when compared to Gorampa\u2019s\nrough contemporaries, including Tsongkhapa and \u015a\u0101kya\nChokden, whose views evolved over the course of their careers. The\nrelative stability of Gorampa\u2019s views over his lifetime is one\nreason why he is held in such high regard among proponents of the\nSakya tradition.\n2. Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka\n\nGorampa, like all of his M\u0101dhyamika interlocutors, appeals to the\nauthority of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. As such, most disagreements between\nGorampa and his opponents primarily concern the correct ways to\ninterpret the works of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and his commentators. While\nGorampa and his opponents generally agree that a Buddhist must\nunderstand the nature of reality by eliminating ignorance and\nrealizing emptiness, what sets Gorampa apart from other\nM\u0101dhyamikas is the way in which he articulates reality, and the\nprocesses by which he argues that one must eliminate ignorance and\nrealize emptiness.\n\nWith this in mind, there are four defining characteristics of\nGorampa\u2019s philosophy that set him apart from other Tibetan\nphilosophers. They are his understandings of: (1) the two truths; (2)\nnegation and the tetralemma; (3) the role of logic and reasoning; and\n(4) proper methods of argumentation on the path to awakening.\n2.1 The Two Truths\n\nThe theory of the two truths, or two realities, is fundamental to\nMadhyamaka philosophy. Reality can be classified in terms of the\nconventional truth (or conventional reality), which corresponds to the\nway that things appear to ordinary persons, and the ultimate truth (or\nultimate reality), which corresponds to the way that things really\nare. While M\u0101dhyamikas tend to disagree about the nature of and\nrelationship between the conventional and ultimate truths, the final\ngoal of Madhyamaka philosophy involves realizing the ultimate truth\n\u2013 seeing things not just as they appear, but as they really\nare.\n\nGorampa argues that the distinction between the two truths is made\nbased on the ways in which a subject (yul can) apprehends an\nobject (yul). That is, the way in which one engages with the\nworld determines whether one perceives things conventionally or\nultimately. Broadly speaking, the conventional truth is mediated by\nconcepts, logic, and reasoning, while the ultimate truth is outside of\nthe realm of conceptual thought. As long as one is engaged in\nconcepts, one is interacting with conventional reality. Once all\nconcepts have been eliminated by following the Buddhist path (as will\nbe explained below), one is said to have realized the ultimate\nreality.\n\nGorampa defines \u201cconventional truth\u201d as that which appears\nto ordinary beings with ordinarily functioning sense faculties.\nObjects, words, smells, and ideas are all sorts of things that can be\nconventionally true, or conventionally real. They are true or real in\nthe sense that they appear to be true or real to ordinary persons,\nwithout any sort of philosophical analysis. Most people in Paris, for\nexample, can point to the Eiffel Tower and agree, \u201cThat is the\nEiffel Tower.\u201d The existence of the Eiffel Tower is thus\nconventionally true. It appears to ordinary people with fully\nfunctioning sense faculties, and these ordinary people identify it by\nmeans of the linguistic convention, \u201cEiffel Tower.\u201d\n\nIt is not, however, necessarily the case that anything that can be\nidentified or described in words is conventionally true. If a tourist\nin Paris drinks too much wine and starts seeing double, for example,\nthis does not mean that the existence of two Eiffel Towers is suddenly\nconventionally true. The drunk person\u2019s perception is skewed; he\nis no longer operating with ordinary faculties. After he sobers up, he\nwill once again see that really, there is only one Eiffel Tower. To\nillustrate this point in his texts, Gorampa refers to\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s well-known Madhyamaka analogy of a person\nwith an eye disorder (rab rib can) mistakenly thinking that the\nfloaters in his field of vision are actually hairs on his dinner\nplate. But the truth of the matter \u2013 the conventional truth,\nthat is \u2013 is that the hairs are not really there, as a person\nwith normally functioning eyes can affirm.\n\nThe conventional truth, therefore, is true in the sense that it is\nsomething upon which all ordinary persons with normally functioning\nfaculties can agree. The conventional truth is what allows for people\nto travel to Paris to visit the Eiffel Tower, to talk about the\nweather, and to engage in debates about politics. It is also, most\nimportantly for Gorampa, what allows people to understand conceptually\nwhat a realization of the ultimate truth is like, and what enables\nBuddhist practitioners to correctly develop logical reasoning and\nengage in proper types of meditative practices. In other words, some\nfeatures of the conventional \u2013 such as reasoning and\nlanguage \u2013 can be used to approach an understanding of the\nultimate, even though the ultimate itself transcends those\nfeatures.\n\nIn contrast to the conventional, the ultimate truth is understood as\nthe way things really are, independent of the concepts and conventions\nwith which ordinary persons engage. Gorampa contends that the\nconventional truth is mired in ignorance \u2013 the cause of\nsa\u1e43s\u0101ra, which keeps sentient beings cycling from\none birth to the next, lifetime after lifetime. When this ignorance is\nremoved, one is capable of realizing the ultimate truth, and through\nthat realization, one can attain freedom from the cycle of\nrebirth.\n\nBased on this account, then, when philosophers attempt to describe or\neven label \u201cthe ultimate truth,\u201d they fail to capture it\nin its entirety; when identifying and describing the ultimate truth,\nconcepts and language must be used, and Gorampa\u2019s definition of\nthe ultimate truth is that it is beyond all concepts and language.\nStill, Gorampa argues that it is important to begin the process of\nrealizing the actual ultimate truth by developing a conceptual\nunderstanding of the general features of the ultimate. In other words,\nforming a concept of the ultimate is not the final goal of awakening\nitself, but it gives one a sense of what awakening is like.\n\nIn order to explain the difference between a conceptual understanding\nand a nonconceptual realization of the ultimate truth, Gorampa divides\nit into two types: the ultimate that is taught (bstan pa'i don\ndam) and the ultimate that is realized (rtogs pa'i don\ndam). The ultimate that is taught corresponds to an ordinary\nperson\u2019s concept of the ultimate, while the ultimate that is\nrealized is directly and nonconceptually ascertained by awakened\nbeings.\n\nWhen the ultimate is divided in this way, Gorampa makes the case that\nordinary persons and awakened beings are capable of recognizing each\nof the two truths, but in different ways. An ordinary person can\nconceptually understand the ultimate that is taught, while still\nperceiving the conventional realm as true or real. From this\nperspective, the conventional is called \u201cthe conventional\ntruth\u201d (kun rdzob bden pa). But once an awakened\nbeing nonconceptually apprehends the ultimate that is realized, the\nconventional no longer appears as real or as solid as it once was. The\nawakened being, having had a direct experience of the way things\nreally are, no longer experiences the conventional as true, but\nrather as merely conventional (kun rdzob tsam).\n\nIn other words, we can say that the conventional truth is that\nwhich is true for ordinary, unawakened beings. The merely\nconventional, however, is perceived after an awakened being\nrealizes the ultimate truth. There merely conventional is not false;\nit is simply a mode of perception that is subordinated to the ultimate\ntruth that an awakened being has directly experienced.\n\nUnlike some other Tibetan philosophers, Gorampa stresses that the\ndifference between conventional truth and mere convention is based\nentirely on the subject who apprehends these objects. The same table\nappears as truly existent to an ordinary being, and as a merely\nconventional imputation to an awakened being. The conventional and\nultimate truths, similarly, are distinguished on the basis of the ways\nin which they are apprehended. (This approach differs from someone\nlike Tsongkhapa, who distinguishes the two truths on the basis of the\nobject, arguing that every appearing thing consists of conventional\nand ultimate aspects.)\n\nIn short, ordinary beings perceive the conventional truth, and\nunderstand the ultimate that is taught. Awakened beings\nexperience the merely conventional, and directly realize the\nultimate that is realized. Based on this model of the two\ntruths, Gorampa argues that the Buddhist path involves a process of\ntransforming one\u2019s perspective. One begins by correctly\nidentifying and understanding the conventional truth. Then, through\nlogical reasoning and meditative practices, one gradually begins to\nrealize that this so-called truth is merely conventional and that it\nis based entirely on concepts that are rooted in ignorance; in this\nway one comes to a conceptual understanding of the ultimate that is\ntaught. Through more analysis and practice still, one eventually\nrecognizes that the conventional truth is only merely conventional,\nand directly realizes the ultimate truth, which does not depend on\nignorance and concepts.\n\nBy working through this process to transform one\u2019s mind, Gorampa\nargues that a Buddhist practitioner on the Madhymaka path will finally\narrive at a state of freedom from conceptual proliferations (spros\npa dang bral ba). This is a mental state in which conceptual\nthought does not occur, and one directly and immediately apprehends\nthe ultimate that is realized. Gorampa is explicit in pointing out\nthat this state of freedom from conceptual proliferations is different\nfrom a state of unconsciousness. In order to cultivate a state of\nfreedom from conceptual proliferations, one must eliminate concepts\ngradually, through particular methods that involve both logical\nreasoning and meditative practices. As we will see below, Gorampa\noutlines a very specific fourfold process for eliminating concepts in\norder to arrive at this desired state of nonconceptuality.\n2.2 Negation\n\nIn order to cultivate an awakened mind that realizes the ultimate\ntruth, the Madhyamaka school of philosophy advocates a fourfold\nprocess of analyzing the conventional truth that is commonly referred\nto as a tetralemma (catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di, mtha\u2019\nbzhi). While this fourfold analysis is not unique to Buddhism, its\nuse as a tool in Buddhist philosophical traditions can be traced to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rika, in\nwhich he famously remarks, \u201cNeither from itself, nor from\nanother, nor from both, nor without a cause, does anything, anywhere,\never, arise\u201d (MMK I:1). This fourfold rejection of one extreme,\nits opposite, both, and neither, is adopted and expanded upon by later\nM\u0101dhyamikas, and is frequently used as a tool in order to\ndemonstrate the Madhyamaka view.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s commentator \u0100ryadeva applies this\nfourfold negation to an analysis of existence in his\nJ\u00f1\u0101nas\u0101rasamuccaya, writing, \u201cThere is\nno existence, there is no nonexistence, there is no existence and\nnonexistence, nor is there the absence of both.\u201d Gorampa\nfrequently cites this passage in order to illustrate the Madhyamaka\nview as that which is free from conceptual constructs. He contends\nthat a proper understanding and application of this passage allows a\npractitioner to successfully transition from the state of an ordinary\nperson who sees conventional truth, to an awakened buddha who directly\nand nonconceptually realizes the ultimate.\n\nMost Tibetan Buddhist philosophers agree that the tetralemma is a tool\nthat can help one to realize the ultimate, but they differ in their\nexplanations of the ways in which this tool functions. Gorampa argues\nthat one must negate each of the four extremes in succession by using\nlogic and reasoning, and then one must subsequently realize the\nnegation of all four extremes simultaneously through meditative\npractices.\n2.2.1 The Process of Refuting the Four Extremes\n\nAs Gorampa formulates the tetralemma, the process begins by analyzing\nand refuting existence. This is done by using the \u201cFive\nMadhyamaka Reasonings\u201d (dbu ma gtan tshigs lnga). These\nfive types of reasoning are:\n\nNeither one nor many (gcig du dral), which analyzes the\nessence (ngo bo) of things.\nDiamond splinters (rdo rje'i gzegs ma), which analyzes\ncauses.\nRefuting the arising of something existent or nonexistent (yod\nmed skye \u2018gog), which analyzes effects.\nRefuting the four possibilities of arising (mu bzhi skye\n\u2018gog), which analyzes causes and effects together.\nDependent arising (rten \u2018brel), which shows that\nphenomena cannot exist independently.\n\n\nThese points are generally agreed upon by all M\u0101dhyamikas, and\nentire essays can be devoted to each of these five types of reasoning,\nso they will not be discussed in detail here. The basic thrust of\nthese five types of reasoning is that when we analyze the things that\nappear in the conventional truth, and try to find some kind of\nessential qualities that underpin those conventionally appearing\nthings, nothing whatsoever can be found. In other words, if one\nsearches for an ultimate truth that exists beyond conventional\nappearances, nothing whatsoever can be found.\n\nAfter one has refuted the concept that things truly exist, Gorampa\nconcedes that a person\u2019s natural inclination might be to assume\nthat things are therefore nonexistent. He argues, however, that if one\nwere to affirm the nonexistence of things, this would amount to a view\nof nihilism, which is antithetical to the Madhyamaka position. In\norder to show that the acceptance of nonexistence is untenable,\nGorampa argues that existence and nonexistence are concepts that\ndepend upon each other, just like left and right, or big and small;\none makes no sense without the other. So, once the concept of\nexistence is eliminated completely, it makes no sense to conceive of\nnonexistence independently of that. Things cannot be nonexistent\nunless they stand in contrast to things that are existent.\n\nOnce he has shown that existence and nonexistence are each untenable,\nGorampa refutes the third possibility of the tetralemma, that things\ncan somehow simultaneously both exist and not exist. He dismisses this\npossibility quite succinctly, stating that if existence and\nnonexistence have each been refuted individually, then it makes no\nsense that they could somehow exist together.\n\nThe refutation of the fourth lemma, neither existence nor\nnonexistence, yet again depends upon the successful refutation of the\nprevious three. Gorampa argues that to conceive of something as\n\u201cneither existent nor nonexistent\u201d is to conceive of\nsomething that is somewhere between the two extremes of existence and\nnonexistence. He contends, however, that if one has any concept of\nanything at all \u2013 even if it is some sort of concept of\nquasi-existence \u2013 this is still a wrong view. Once the extremes\nof existence, nonexistence, and both have been completely refuted,\nthere is no viable position left. To somehow claim that things are\nneither existent nor nonexistent after having refuted the first three\npossibilities is illogical.\n\nWith the refutation of these four positions in succession, Gorampa\nshows that any possible way of conceiving of the ultimate\nreality of a thing is impossible. Gorampa stresses the importance of\nunderstanding the refutation of each of these four lemmas in\nsuccession; the logic that refutes the concept of nonexistence depends\nupon the successful refutation of the existence, the refutation of the\nthird concept (both existence and nonexistence) depends on the\nrefutation of the first two, and the refutation of the fourth (neither\nexistence nor nonexistence) depends upon the refutation of the first\nthree concepts. Existence, nonexistence, both, and neither are the\nonly possible ways of conceiving of the ultimate status of a thing, so\nonce each of these possible ways is eliminated, there is no way to\nconceive of things that remains.\n\nThe refutation of each of the four extremes of the tetralemma is a\nlogic-oriented process that helps a follower of Madhyamaka to\ncultivate a conceptual understanding of the ultimate truth that is\ntaught. But Gorampa argues that logic alone will not bring about a\nrealization of the actual ultimate truth. For this, one must also\nincorporate meditative practices. Gorampa argues that through repeated\nmeditation on the refutation of each of the four lemmas in succession,\none will eventually come to realize all four refutations\nsimultaneously. We might describe this style of meditative practice as\na kind of \u201cturning off\u201d of concepts. After one\nconceptually understands the negation of existence, for example, one\nmeditates on this negation and eventually stops having concepts of\nthings existing altogether. This process continues through all four\npossibilities in the tetralemma, until one no longer conceives of\nthings at all. Again, it is important to note that this is distinct\nfrom simply arresting the process of thought.\n2.2.2 The Role of Negation and the Function of the Tetralemma\n\nAccording to Gorampa, the tetralemma is a tool that is used to\ninvestigate the ultimate status of appearances. Through the logic of\nthis fourfold negation, one cultivates a conceptual understanding of\nthe ultimate that is taught, and then, through subsequent meditative\npractices, one eventually cultivates a direct, nonconceptual\nrealization of the actual ultimate truth. In short, the logical\nreasoning involved in the fourfold negation is implemented by ordinary\npersons in order to understand what the ultimate truth is like,\nbut logic alone is not sufficient to arrive at a direct realization of\nthe ultimate.\n\nAlthough tetralemmic analysis is employed by all M\u0101dhyamika\nphilosophers, Gorampa\u2019s interpretation of this fourfold negation\nis unique in that it amounts to a complete eradication of conceptual\nthought. Other M\u0101dhyamikas, such as Tsongkhapa, qualify each of\nthe negations in the tetralemma in ways that eliminate only certain\nkinds of concepts. For someone like Tsongkhapa, the tetralemma is a\ntool that can be used to eliminate wrong concepts; for Gorampa,\nhowever, it is a tool that eliminates all concepts.\n\nGorampa\u2019s particular interpretation of the tetralemma is based\non the ways that he understands negation to function within this\nfourfold analysis. For him, the negations of existence, nonexistence,\nboth, and neither are each complete and total non-affirming negations\n(med dgag); that is, each limb of the tetralemma is negated in\nits entirely, without the existence of anything else being affirmed in\nits place. The result of this process is, again, the complete\neradication of any concepts of existence, nonexistence, both, or\nneither.\n\nSome of Gorampa\u2019s opponents \u2013 again, including Tsongkhapa\n\u2013 understand negation differently. Tsongkhapa and his supporters\nadhere to the law of double negation, and understand the negations\nwithin the tetralemma to be qualified in certain ways. As such, while\nthe negation of existence is interpreted to mean that nothing exists\nultimately, the negation of nonexistence is interpreted to mean that\nsomething does, nevertheless, exist. For Tsongkhapa, this\n\u201csomething\u201d is the conventional truth. Because of this,\nTsongkhapa\u2019s understanding of the tetralemma involves a complex\nsystem of logical statements, each qualified according to one of the\ntwo truths. If one accepts double negation elimination, then it makes\nno sense for both existence and nonexistence to be negated, unless\nthese negations are qualified in certain ways.\n\nGorampa, on the other hand, does not adhere to double negation in the\ncontext of the tetralemma. Instead, he understands the tetralemma as a\nsuccession of four negations that are applied to the four possible\nways of conceiving of the status of the ultimate truth. Because the\nultimate truth is nonconceptualizable, Gorampa contends that\nTsongkhapa\u2019s understanding of the tetralemma is incomplete,\nbecause it doesn\u2019t negate enough \u2013 literally, it\nunderpervades (khyab chung ba). While Tsongkhapa\u2019s model\nsuccessfully refutes the extreme view of existence at the ultimate\nlevel, Gorampa argues that it does not eliminate all extreme views\nultimately and in their entirety.\n\nTsongkhapa argues that a negation of all four extremes at the ultimate\nlevel defies logic, but Gorampa contends that a transcendence of logic\nis specifically the tetralemma\u2019s purpose. By negating all\npossibilities for logical, conceptual thought, the only recourse is to\nabandon concepts completely. True freedom from conceptual\nproliferations lies outside of the scope of conceptual thought, and is\ntherefore inexpressible. Gorampa maintains, however, that because\nordinary persons utilize conceptual thought, they necessarily construe\nthe ultimate truth as an object of conceptual constructs (that is,\nthey construe it as the ultimate that is taught). As such, one must\nfirst use conceptual reasoning to refute each of the four extremes,\nbut these concepts must eventually be abandoned.\n\nIn other words, because all four extremes are negated under the\nanalysis of the tetralemma, Gorampa concludes that a correct\nrealization of the ultimate truth must be something that is other than\nthese conceptualizations of and dichotomizations into existence and\nnonexistence. As such, the ultimate truth cannot be described using\nthese terms. And, since these are the only possible ways of speaking\nof or conceptualizing the status of the existence of things, once they\nare all negated, one is forced to conclude that the ultimate truth\ncannot be described linguistically or conceptually. The ultimate truth\nthat is realized transcends the boundaries of language and conceptual\nthought. However, Gorampa still maintains that logic and analysis are\nessential in arriving at a state of nonconceptuality.\n2.3 The Role of Logic\n\nGorampa\u2019s understanding of the relationship between the two\ntruths and the use of negation in the tetralemma reinforce his\nunderstanding of the ways in which a practitioner should proceed on\nthe Buddhist path toward awakening. Through the logic of the\ntetralemma, Gorampa demonstrates that the final goal of awakening is\nbeyond conceptual thought.\n\nConceptual thought comes from ignorance, so by eradicating ignorance,\none eradicates conceptual thought. In other words, since an awakened\nbeing is completely free from ignorance, she has no concepts\nwhatsoever. This claim is quite controversial for obvious reasons:\nbuddhas are understood as consisting of perfect wisdom, and are\ndescribed in scriptures as omniscient beings. How, then, can a buddha\nhave no concepts at all, but still be considered omniscient?\n\nTsongkhapa and his fellow Gelugpa opponents criticize Gorampa for this\nvery reason. They contend that Gorampa\u2019s philosophy negates too\nmuch \u2013 it \u201coverpervades\u201d (khyab che ba). They\nargue that if the final goal of awakening is really a complete\nelimination of concepts, then one ought to be able to attain awakening\nby simply falling asleep or otherwise becoming unconscious. Gorampa\ncontends, however, that in order to successfully eliminate all\nconcepts in their entirety, it is absolutely essential that one begins\nby using logic and reasoning. The end result is indeed nonconceptual,\nbut it differs from the quietism that is a result of simply\nnot-thinking, without any prior analysis.\n\nThe issue underlying this debate concerns the status of conceptual\ncontent in the minds of fully awakened buddhas. Gorampa contends,\nciting Candrak\u012brti, that fully awakened buddhas have no\nconceptual content whatsoever; they have completely eliminated\nignorance in its entirety, and therefore do not actively engage in the\nconventional world. They do not conceive of things as existent,\nnonexistent, both, or neither. In fact, they do not conceive of things\nat all. They do, however, appear to be omniscient from the\nperspective of ordinary beings, and because of their previous karma\nand the compassion that they have cultivated on the path to\nenlightenment, they continue to function in the world for the benefit\nof ordinary unenlightened beings for a period of time.\n\nThe implications of Gorampa\u2019s view are significant. While\nTsongkhapa\u2019s model stresses the eradication of only certain\nkinds of concepts \u2013 e.g., concepts relating to the ultimate\nexistence of things \u2013 Gorampa\u2019s model shows that\nall concepts must be eliminated, first through the logical\nreasoning of the tetralemma, and then through subsequent meditative\npractices. Because Gorampa is not concerned with the preservation of\ncertain kinds of concepts, he is more tolerant of variations in styles\nof argumentation that might be used to arrive at a state of freedom\nfrom conceptual proliferations.\n2.4 Methods of Argumentation\n\nGorampa\u2019s emphasis on the possibility for different acceptable\nstyles of argumentation occurs in the context of his analysis of the\nso-called Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and Sv\u0101tantrika subschools of\nMadhyamaka thought. These two subschools were understood by Tibetan\nthinkers as being developed by the Indian M\u0101dhyamikas\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Bh\u0101viveka, the former advocating the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika position and the latter that of the\nSv\u0101tantrika. Candrak\u012brti is understood as upholding the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika tradition, because he defended\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s views against Bh\u0101viveka\u2019s\ncriticisms. It is important to note, however, that none of these\nIndian scholars labeled themselves as adherents of particular\nsubschools of Madhyamaka, and that the terms rang gyud pa\n(Sv\u0101tantrika) and thal \u2018gyur ba (Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika)\nwere coined centuries later by Tibetans.\n\nRegardless of whether Buddhap\u0101lita, Bh\u0101viveka, or\nCandrak\u012brti actually understood themselves to be advocating these\ndistinct positions, the differentiation between Sv\u0101tantrika and\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika became reified in medieval Tibetan Buddhist\ndiscourse. Because Tibetans held Candrak\u012brti\u2019s Madhyamaka\nin high regard, they purported to be Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gikas\nthemselves, and many constructed detailed explanations of the division\nbetween the Sv\u0101tantrika and Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika systems, always\nupholding Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika as the highest form of Madhyamaka.\n\nTsongkhapa famously composed a list of \u201ceight difficult\npoints\u201d (dka\u2019 gnad brgyad) distinguishing his own\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika view from that of the Sv\u0101tantrika. Based on\nthese eight points, Tsongkhapa concluded that the two schools to\ndiffer in terms of their views regarding the nature of the ultimate\ntruth.\n\nGorampa also considers himself a Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika, but insists\nthat the distinction between these two Madhyamaka subschools is a\nmatter of method, not view. Because Gorampa\u2019s interpretation of\nthe two truths and negation informs a process by which the\nM\u0101dhyamika begins with logic and analysis, and ends in a state of\nnonconceptuality, Gorampa contends that there can be no differences\nbetween M\u0101dhyamikas with respect to their final view. There\ncannot be different types of nonconceptuality; the end result of any\ntrue Madhyamaka analysis is freedom from conceptual proliferations.\nOnce one has successfully eradicated conceptual thought, the methods\nthat she has used to arrive at such a state are no longer relevant.\nThe differences between these Madhyamaka subschools, therefore, occur\nwith respect to the ways in which they understand the conventional\ntruth, and utilize logic and reasoning.\n\nIn short, Gorampa\u2019s particular brand of Madhyamaka is\ncharacterized by his understanding of the two truths, and the ways in\nwhich negation functions within the logic of tetralemmic analysis.\nBecause the ultimate truth is entirely free from concepts, one\nutilizes negation to eliminate all concepts in their entirety. The\nways in which one employs Madhyamaka reasoning in order to negate\nthese concepts are ultimately not as important as actually arriving at\na state of nonconceptuality. Thus, unlike Tsongkhapa, who concludes\nthat there is one correct final view, Gorampa contends that the final,\nultimate view is actually no view at all.\n3. Influence on Other Philosophers\n\nGorampa\u2019s harsh criticisms of Tsongkhapa resulted in his works\nbeing banned throughout Tibet for centuries. When these texts were\nrecovered and reprinted, however, Gorampa\u2019s philosophy\nexperienced a resurgence of sorts, not only among fellow Sakyapas, but\nalso among some scholars belonging to the Kagyu and Nyingma schools.\nGorampa\u2019s emphasis on logic and reasoning, combined with his\nview that different methods can successfully be applied to arrive at\nthe same result of freedom from conceptual proliferations, appealed to\nnon-Sakya scholars who had historically placed more of an emphasis on\nmeditative practices, but wished to counter Gelugpa-style logical\narguments.\n\nJust as Gorampa argues that the distinction between Sv\u0101tantrika\nand Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika is a matter of method, but not of a\nM\u0101dhyamika\u2019s final view, later Tibetan commentators have\nextended this reasoning to apply to other, non-Sakya schools within\nTibetan Buddhism. Gorampa\u2019s philosophy has become influential\nwithin what has recently come to be known as the \u201cnonsectarian\nmovement\u201d (ris med) of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nKagyu and Nyingma scholars managed to appropriate some of\nGorampa\u2019s philosophy and incorporate it into their own systems.\nNot only did Gorampa provide a compelling refutation of\nTsongkhapa\u2019s particular understanding of Madhyamaka, but his\nphilosophical arguments also proved compatible with Kagyu and Nyingma\nstyles of meditative practice. Today, Kagyu and Nyingma scholars study\nGorampa\u2019s philosophical texts at Sakya monastic institutions,\nand some even teach Gorampa\u2019s philosophy in their own\nmonasteries.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Cabezon, Jose Ignacio, and Geshe Lobsang Dargyay, 2007,\n<em>Freedom from Extremes: Gorampa\u2019s \u201cDistinguishing the\nViews\u201d and the Polemics of Emptiness</em>, Boston: Wisdom\nPublications.", "Deguchi, Yasuo, Jay L.
