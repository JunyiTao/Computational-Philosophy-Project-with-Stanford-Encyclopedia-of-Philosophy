    "main_text": "The Theory of Symbol Systems in Languages of Art || Modes of Reference\n3.1 Modes of Reference\n\nThe fundamental notion which is at the core of Goodman\u2019s theory\nof symbols is that of reference\u2014the primitive relation\nof \u201cstanding for\u201d\u2014seen as articulated in different\nmodes, of which denotation is one, and as obtaining not just directly\nbut indirectly as well, sometimes across long chains of reference.\nIndeed, one of the great contributions of Goodman to philosophy is his\ninvestigation of kinds of reference or symbolization. Denotation and\nexemplification are the two fundamental forms of reference out of\nwhich Goodman develops most of his analysis. Denotation is\nthe relationship between a \u201clabel,\u201d such as \u201cJohn F.\nKennedy,\u201d or \u201cThe 34th President of the United\nStates,\u201d and what it labels (Goodman 1976, Chap. 1). In fact,\naccording to Goodman\u2019s nominalist approach, possessing\na feature (or what ordinarily would also be called a property, such as\nbeing blue) just amounts to being denoted by a certain\npredicate or, more precisely, by a \u201clabel\u201d (such as\n\u201cblue\u201d). Hence possession is the converse of\ndenotation. (Of course, labels can be particular or general, as\nreference can be to an individual, as in the \u201cJFK\u201d example\nabove, or, severally, to all the members of a set, as with\n\u201cblue\u201d with respect to all blue items.) Furthermore,\nlabels are not limited to linguistic ones, i.e., to predicates:\npictures, musical symbols, and all other labels classify world items;\nand what something is depends as much on the nonverbal labels applying\nto it as on the predicates it falls under.\n\nExemplification\u2014the sort of reference typical, for\ninstance, of tailors\u2019 swatches\u2014requires possession. In\naddition to possession, however, which of course by itself is not a\nform of symbolization, exemplification requires that the exemplifying\nsymbol refers back to the label or predicate that denotes it.\nHence, exemplification is \u201cpossession plus reference\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 53). When a feature is referred to in this way, it is\n\u201cexhibited, typified, shown forth\u201d (Goodman 1976, 86).\nWhile any blue object is denoted by the label \u201cblue,\u201d only\nthose things\u2014e.g., blue color swatches\u2014that also refer to\n\u201cblue\u201d and analogous labels exemplify such color, are\n\u201csamples\u201d of it. An important characteristic of samples is\nthat they are selective in the way they function symbolically (see\nalso Goodman 1978a, 63\u201370). A tailor\u2019s swatch does not\nexemplify all of the features it possesses\u2014or all the predicates\nthat denote it\u2014but rather only those for which it is a symbol\n(hence, e.g., predicates denoting color and texture, and not\npredicates denoting size or shape). Which of its properties does a\nsample exemplify depends on the system within which the sample is\nbeing used: color and texture are relevant to the systems used in\ntailoring, not size and shape. Exemplification is for Goodman a common\nand yet, philosophically, unrecognized form of reference. Indeed,\nthroughout his own philosophical oeuvre, we find Goodman using\nexemplification to explain a number of issues: most notably,\nexpression in art, but also, for instance, the notion of artistic\nstyle (1975), how works of architecture can be attributed meaning\n(1985), or the notion of a \u201cvariation upon a theme\u201d in\nsuch arts as music and painting (Goodman, Elgin 1988, Chap. 4).\n\nYet the paths or \u201croutes\u201d of reference can be of many\ndifferent sorts, and indeed symbols may combine in \u201cchains of\nreference\u201d to give rise to instances of complex\nreference (Goodman 1981a). There is, first of all, the sort of\nsymbolization employed by metaphors (as when human beings are\nreferred to as \u201cwolves\u201d), a mode of reference that becomes\ncrucial to Goodman\u2019s analysis of expression in art. In analyzing\nmetaphor, Goodman (1976, Chap. 2; 1979) follows suggestions included\nin Max Black\u2019s famous article on the topic (Black 1954) but\nexpands and adapts them to his own view that denotational\nsymbols\u2014labels\u2014don\u2019t work alone but rather as\nmembers of \u201cschemata\u201d (\u201ca label functions not in\nisolation but as belonging to a family\u201d [Goodman 1976, 71]),\nnormally correlated to some referential \u201crealm.\u201d\n\u201cBlue,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201cred,\u201d etc., for\ninstance, typically belong to the same \u201cschema\u201d\u2014a\nset of labels established by context and habit\u2014and the realm of\nreference of such a schema is made of all the ranges of things that\neach label in the schema denotes (all blue objects, all green objects,\netc.). We have an instance of metaphorical reference when a symbol,\nlinguistic or not, is made to refer to something not\nbelonging to the realm normally correlated to the symbol\u2019s\nschema, i.e., not belonging to the sorts of things that the symbols in\nthe schema normally refer to. Hence, calling a painting\n\u201csad\u201d is metaphorical because a predicate that is normally\nprojected upon bearers of mental, emotional states is projected upon\nan inanimate object made of canvas and wood and paint. Using the\nnotions of schema and realm allows Goodman\u2019s analysis to include\nthe claim that typically metaphors bring about rearrangements in a\nfield of reference, which affect several labels at once. It is\nimportant to emphasize that, for Goodman, metaphorical usage is no\nless real or connected to knowledge than literal usage, and\nmetaphorical truth no less a form of truth than literal truth. Indeed,\nthe literal and the metaphorical in a sense lie on the same continuum.\nWhether the application of a label (and the corresponding possession\nof a feature) should be considered literal or metaphorical is just a\nmatter of habit\u2014specifically, a matter of the age of the\nmetaphor, for old metaphors lose their metaphorical status and\nbecome just literal applications. Using a metaphor himself, Goodman\nclaims that \u201ca metaphor is an affair between a predicate with a\npast and an object that yields while protesting\u201d (1976, 69).\nNotice that such a formula includes two elements: that there is\nresistance to a metaphor (deriving from its literal\nfalseness) but also attraction (deriving from the insightful\nreorganization of a schema of labels vis-\u00e0-vis a referential\nrealm, which the metaphor may bring about). A metaphor is a voluntary\nmisassignment of a label, but it is also more than that:\n\u201cWhereas falsity depends upon misassignment of a label,\nmetaphorical truth depends upon reassignment\u201d (1976, 70\nemphasis added).\n\nOther rhetorical figures (although not all of them) can, in\nGoodman\u2019s view be explained in terms of metaphorical\n\u201ctransfers\u201d of this kind, indeed as \u201cmodes of\nmetaphor\u201d: personification, synecdoche, antonomasia, hyperbole,\nlitotes, irony\u2026 (1976, 81\u201385).\n\nOf course, the same item may perform several referential functions at\nthe same time, denoting certain things while exemplifying certain\nfeatures, and do so literally or metaphorically. Furthermore,\nsometimes reference is indirect or mediate (Goodman,\nElgin 1988, 42), brought about by the combination of different forms\nof reference into instances of complex reference. Reference\nmay, so to speak, travel along \u201cchains of\nreference\u201d made of symbols that refer to, or are referred by,\nother symbols. An obvious case is that in which a country like the\nUnited States is referred to by a picture of a bald eagle, thanks to\nthe picture of the bald eagle being a label for a bird that in turn\nexemplifies a label like \u201cbold and free,\u201d which in turn\ndenotes the United States and indeed is, furthermore, exemplified by\nit (Goodman 1984, 62).\n",
