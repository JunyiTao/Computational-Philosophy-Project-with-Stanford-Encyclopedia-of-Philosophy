    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Liberal Principles and the Categorical Approach\n3.1 Liberal Principles and the Categorical Approach\n\nIn an early and famous passage Mill conceives of liberalism in terms\nof \u201cone very simple principle.\u201d\n\n\nThe object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as\nentitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means\nused be physical force in the form of legal penalties or the moral\ncoercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for\nwhich mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in\ninterfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is\nself-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be\nrightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against\nhis will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical\nor moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be\ncompelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so,\nbecause it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others,\nto do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for\nremonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or\nentreating him, but not for compelling him or visiting him with any\nevil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which\nit is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to\nsomeone else. The only part of the conduct of anyone for which he is\namenable to society is that which concerns others. In the part which\nmerely concerns himself, his independence, is, of right, absolute.\nOver himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\n(I 9)\n\n\nIn this passage, Mill distinguishes paternalistic and moralistic\nrestrictions of liberty from restrictions of liberty based upon the\nharm principle and claims that the harm prevention is the sole\nlegitimate basis for restricting individual liberties.\n\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is\npaternalistic if it is done for B\u2019s own\nbenefit.\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is\nmoralistic if it is done to ensure that B acts morally or not\nimmorally.\nA\u2019s restriction of B\u2019s liberty is an\napplication of the harm principle if it is done to prevent\nharm to someone other than B.\n\n\nLater, Mill distinguishes between genuine harm and mere\noffense. In order to satisfy the harm principle, an action must\nviolate or risk violation of those important interests of others in\nwhich they have a right (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10; IV 12; V 5).\n\nThese distinctions allow Mill to defend a categorical\napproach to liberal rights. To decide whether an\nindividual\u2019s liberty ought to be protected, we must ascertain to\nwhich category the potential restriction of liberty belongs: offense,\nmoralism, paternalism, and harm prevention. Mill seems to permit or\nforbid restrictions on liberty by category, claiming that the only\nrestrictions that are permissible involve harm prevention. Of course,\na given regulation might fall under more than one category. Many\nprovisions of the criminal law, such as prohibitions on murder and\nassault, might be designed both to enforce fundamental moral\nprovisions and to prevent harm to others. Mill does not object to\nmoralistic or paternalistic legislation that can also be defended by\nappeal to the harm principle. Rather, the objection is to restrictions\nthat can only be justified in these ways and cannot be justified by\nappeal to harm prevention.\n\nHarm prevention is a necessary but not sufficient ground for\nrestricting individual liberties. Harm prevention is sufficient to\nestablish a pro tanto case for regulation (I 11), but whether\nregulation is all things considered appropriate depends on a\nutilitarian calculation of whether the benefits of regulation exceed\nits costs.\n\n\nAs soon as any part of a person\u2019s conduct affects prejudicially\nthe interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the\nquestion whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by\ninterfering with it, becomes open to discussion. (IV 3)\n\n\nThis means that the harm principle is not in fact Mill\u2019s only\nprinciple, because we cannot decide whether regulations that would\nprevent harm should be adopted without appealing to the principle of\nutility. But even if harm prevention is not sufficient to justify\nrestricting liberty, Mill does appear to claim that it is\nnecessary.\n\nSometimes Mill suggests that the harm principle is equivalent to\nletting society restrict other-regarding conduct (I 11; IV 2). On this\nview, conduct can be divided into self-regarding and other-regarding\nconduct. Regulation of the former is paternalistic, and regulation of\nthe latter is an application of the harm principle. So on this view it\nis never permissible to regulate purely self-regarding conduct and\nalways permissible to regulate other-regarding conflict. But, as Mill\nhimself concedes, very little conduct is purely self-regarding (IV 8).\nSome other-regarding conduct causes mere offense, not genuine harm (IV\n3; IV 12). So Mill cannot equate harmful behavior and other-regarding\nbehavior and cannot think that all other-regarding behavior may be\nregulated.\n\nIt is generally thought that by applying this categorical approach to\nliberty and its permissible restrictions Mill is led to offer a fairly\nextensive defense of individual liberties against interference by the\nstate and society. In particular, it is sometimes thought that Mill\nrecognizes a large sphere of conduct which it is impermissible for the\nstate to regulate. We might characterize this sphere of protected\nliberties as Mill\u2019s conception of liberal rights. On\nthis reading, Mill is deriving his conception of liberal rights from a\nprior commitment to the categorical approach and, in particular, to\nthe harm principle (see Jacobson 2000 for an alternative reading).\n",
