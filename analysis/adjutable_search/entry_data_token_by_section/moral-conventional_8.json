    "main_text": "The Origin of Moral Judgments: Reason, Emotion, Social Learning or Innate Cognitive Machinery\n9. The Origin of Moral Judgments: Reason, Emotion, Social Learning or Innate Cognitive Machinery\n\nBy the time they reach their fourth birthday, many children offer what\nsocial domain theorists take to be the \u201cmoral\u201d pattern of\ncriterion judgments about transgressions that involve harm. How do\nthey recognize that these behaviors have a distinct status? According\nto Turiel\u2019s \u201cconstructivist\u201d account, both\nperception and reasoning play a central role. Here is a passage in\nwhich Turiel describes the process in some detail. It focuses on the\nhypothetical example of \u201cEvent A\u201d in which a child in a\nnursery school who wants to use a swing that is being used by another\nchild pushes the other child off the swing and hits him.\n\n\nFor the child to regard the act in Event A as wrong or as a\ntransgression, it is not necessary to be told by others that it is\nwrong, or that he or she model others, or to perceive the act as a\nrule violation. Rather the child can generate prescriptions through\nabstractions from the experience itself (either as an observer or\nparticipant). Important elements in the perception of such an event\nwould be the pain experienced by the victim and the reason for the\noffender\u2019s act. By coordinating these different concepts, the\nchild can generate prescriptions regarding the event. For instance,\nthe child will connect his or her own experience of pain (an\nundesirable experience) to the observed experience of the victim. In\nturn, this will be related to the perceived validity of the\nchild\u2019s motive for harming the other person. Moreover, when the\nchild is the victim, the perception of the undesirability of the\noffender\u2019s act is even more direct and vivid.\n\nOne of the ways children form judgments of moral necessity regarding\nactions of the type depicted in Event A would be through comparison of\nperformance of the act itself with its opposite. In the case of the\nact described in Event A, its negation (in the child\u2019s mental\nactivities) would result in a comparison of its occurrence with its\nnonoccurrence. If the constructed consequences of its nonoccurrence\n(the victim is unharmed) are judged to be more desirable than the\nconsequences of its occurrence (the victim is harmed), then inferences\nwill be made regarding how people should act under those\ncircumstances (e.g., people ought not to hit each other). In\nattempting to understand their social experiences, children form\njudgments about what is right or wrong and fair or unfair. Such\njudgments evolve from the child\u2019s experiences but are not latent\nin the experiences themselves. (Turiel 1983: 43)\n\n\nThis account makes it clear why Haidt favors the term\n\u201crationalist\u201d for views like Turiel\u2019s. The young\nchild is portrayed as doing quite a lot of reasoning. But there is\nmuch in this account that is puzzling. The child is said\nperceive the validity of the assailant\u2019s\nmotive. How does he do that? How does he know which motives are valid\nand which are not? The child also judges that it would be\nmore desirable if the victim is unharmed than if the victim\nis harmed. Why does the child find this outcome more desirable? Having\njudged that it is more desirable if the victim is unharmed, the child\nthen makes an inference about how people should\nact\u2014\u201cpeople ought not to hit each other\u201d.\nBut this conclusion does not follow logically from the premise that it\nis more desirable if the victim is unharmed. So if the\nchild\u2019s inference is deductive then presumably the child is\ninvoking one or more additional premises. What are they and how did\nthe child come to believe them? If the inference is not deductive,\nwhat sort of inference is it, and how does the child come to have the\ncapacity to make this sort of inference? Having made the judgment that\nthe act in Event A is wrong the child will, if asked, make\nmoral-pattern criterion judgments. How does he do that?\nObviously, Turiel\u2019s constructivist account of the processes\nunderlying the formation of criterion judgments in response to\nquestions about harmful transgressions leaves a lot unexplained.\n\nOne influential researcher who has offered a widely discussed\nalternative account is Shaun Nichols. Social learning is the process\nin which normative rules are acquired from parents and other important\npeople in a child\u2019s environment. And while Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists downplay the importance of social learning, it\nplays a central role in Nichols\u2019 theory. Another widely\ndiscussed idea is that emotion or affect is important in moral\ndevelopment and moral cognition. This is a central theme in\nShaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume and in the work of many contemporary\nphilosophers (Kauppinen 2014 [2018]). Though emotion is rarely\nmentioned in Turiel\u2019s work, it is a key element in\nNichols\u2019 explanation of how people distinguish conventional\ntransgressions from transgressions involving harm.\n [17]\n\nOn Nichols\u2019 account, as children mature they acquire an\nincreasingly sophisticated cluster of rules\u2014a normative\ntheory\u2014that specifies which actions are prohibited. The\nnormative theory is acquired primarily via social\n learning[18]\n and includes both moral rules that proscribe harming others under a\nwide variety of circumstances, and conventional rules about such\nmatters as appropriate clothing, etiquette, and classroom behavior.\nHowever, Nichols maintains, Turiel\u2019s work has shown that both\nchildren and adults draw an important distinction in the class of\nbehaviors that are prohibited by the normative theory they have\nacquired. Questions about transgressions in which a victim has been\nharmed and questions about harmless transgressions like wearing\ninappropriate clothing evoke very different responses. What explains\nthe fact that people react differently to different kinds of\ntransgressions? According to Nichols, the answer is provided by the\naffect system. Thinking about some transgressions\u2014most notably\nthose that cause someone to suffer\u2014arouses strong affect in\npeople, and questions about normative transgressions that induce this\nstrong affective reaction evoke different responses than questions\nabout affectively neutral transgressions. However, transgressions\ninvolving harm and suffering are not the only ones that evoke a strong\naffective response. And this leads Nichols to an intriguing\nprediction.\n\n\nOn the account of moral judgment that I\u2019ve proposed, the\nmoral/conventional\n task[19]\n really taps a distinction between a set of norms that are backed by\nan affective system and a set of norms that are not backed by an\naffective system. On this theory, affect-backed normative claims will\nbe treated differently than affect-neutral normative claims. Thus, the\naccount predicts that transgressions of other (non-harm-based) rules\nthat are backed by affective systems should also be treated as\nnon-conventional. As a result, if we find that other affect-backed\nnorms are also distinguished from conventional norms along the\ndimensions of permissibility, seriousness, authority contingency, and\njustification type, then this will provide an independent source of\nevidence for the account of moral judgment that I\u2019ve\nproposed\u2026. To test the prediction we need to exploit a body of\n(non-harm based) rules that are backed by an affective system. (2002:\n227\u2013228)\n\n\nThe affectively potent non-harm based rules Nichols focused on are\nthose that proscribe behaviors likely to evoke disgust. In his first\nexperiment designed to test the theory, Nichols administered his\nversion of the moral/conventional task to participants who had read\nshort vignettes describing prototypical moral transgressions, like one\nchild hitting another, prototypical conventional transgressions, like\na child wearing pajamas to school, and vignettes describing\nnormatively proscribed disgusting behavior. In one of these, Bill, a\nman at a dinner party, spits in his water glass before drinking it. To\nassess whether participants viewed Bill\u2019s transgression to be\nauthority independent, Nichols\u2019 asked:\n\n\nNow what if, before Bill went to the party, the hosts had said,\n\u201cAt our dinner table, anyone can spit in their food or\ndrink\u201d. Would it be O.K. for Bill to spit in his water if the\nhosts say he can? (2002: 229)\n\n\nThe results were consistent with Nichols\u2019 theory.\nParticipants\u2019 judgments about the disgusting transgressions\ndiffered from their judgments about the prototypical conventional\ntransgressions, and resembled their judgments about the prototypical\nmoral transgressions, though the justifications that participants\nprovided were disgust-based rather than harm-based.\n\nIn a second experiment, Nichols sought to confirm that it was the\nemotion of disgust that was responsible for the fact that participants\nin the first experiment treated disgusting transgressions like\nprototypical moral transgressions, rather than like prototypical\nconventional transgressions. To do this, he employed the same\nexperimental strategy used in the first experiment, and then asked\nparticipants to fill out a questionnaire that assesses sensitivity to\ndisgusting stimuli. He found that participants who scored high on the\ndisgust sensitivity scale rated the disgusting transgressions as\nsignificantly more serious than participants who scored low on disgust\nsensitivity. Moreover, the low disgust-sensitivity participants were\nmore likely than the high disgust-sensitivity participants to judge\nthat the disgusting transgressions were authority contingent (2002:\n231).\n\nThe conclusion Nichols urges is that norms prohibiting harmful\nbehavior and norms prohibiting disgusting behavior are part of an\nimportant class of norms that he labels \u201cnorms with\nfeeling\u201d. Though Nichols calls the test that he uses to identify\nviolations of these norms \u201cthe moral/conventional task\u201d,\nthe class of transgressions that evoke what he calls the\n\u201cnon-conventional\u201d response pattern is a much larger, more\nheterogenous, and arguably much less philosophically interesting class\nof transgressions than the ones Turiel claimed to be in the moral\ndomain.\n\nNichols\u2019 theory provoked trenchant criticism from Royzman,\nLeeman, and Baron (2009), who are more sympathetic to Turiel\u2019s\nview that transgressions involving harm are central to moral\ncognition. Their most telling critique focuses on methodological\nproblems with Nichols\u2019 work. Though Nichols\u2019 studies were\ndone about a decade after Haidt, Koller, and Dias (1993) had stressed\nthe importance of asking participants in Turiel-style studies whether\nthey thought the action they were considering had caused any\nharm, Nichols did not ask participants whether anyone was negatively\naffected by the behavior of the protagonists in his disgust scenarios.\nWhen Royzman et al. repeated Nichols\u2019 spitting in the water\nglass experiment and explicitly asked \u201cwas anyone negatively\naffected by [the protagonist\u2019s] action?\u201d 71% of their\nparticipants judged that other guests at the diner table were\nnegatively affected, and those who thought the disgusting behavior was\nharmful were more likely to judge that the protagonist\u2019s\nbehavior was not permissible even if the party host allowed it (2009:\n166\u2013167).\n\nIn a second experiment, Royzman and colleagues explored the\npossibility that participants\u2019 responses to Nichols\u2019\ndisgust sensitivity questionnaire might have been influenced by their\nrecent judgments about the disgusting transgression. When they\nadministered the disgust sensitivity questionnaire two weeks\nbefore participants were asked about the disgusting\ntransgressions, they found that disgust sensitivity was not correlated\nwith responses to questions about whether the action would be wrong\nunder a range of counterfactual circumstances\u2014if there were no\nsocial norm against it, for example, or if it occurred in another\ncountry where it was thought to be OK. Royzman and colleagues call\njudgments that don\u2019t vary under these counterfactual\ncircumstances socially transcendent, and they argue that\nsocial transcendent judgments should be taken to be the fundamental\ncomponent of the moral/conventional task. They found that social\ntranscendence correlated only with ratings of current harm, and not\nwith disgust sensitivity. These experimental findings are, of course,\na direct challenge to Nichols\u2019 \u201cnorms with feeling\u201d\n view.[20]\n What seems to be responsible for \u201cnon-conventional\u201d\nresponses on the moral/conventional task used in Royzman et\nal.\u2019s experiments is not affect, as Nichols\u2019 theory would\nurge, but a judgment that someone is harmed.\n\nRoyzman and colleagues conclude that their findings\n\n\nare largely consistent with Turiel\u2019s basic insight that the\nprocess of selective moralization is effected by a system oriented\ntowards a particular rule content, and that this content is largely\ndefined by acts or dispositions deemed intrinsically harmful to\nothers. (2009: 172\u2013173)\n\n\nBut they do not endorse Turiel\u2019s constructivism. Rather, to\nexplain how people acquire the ability to distinguish moral and\nconventional transgressions they propose a sophisticated version of\nnativism.\n\n\n[T]he data and reflections presented \u2026 appear to constrain the\nanswer to the question about the formation of the\nmoral\u2013conventional distinction to the point where it may be\nplausible to suggest that humans possess, as part as of their evolved\ncognitive machinery, something analogous to Azimov\u2019s\n\u201cFirst Law of Robotics\u201d (in a nutshell: \u201charm no\nhuman\u201d [even if commanded so via the authority of another human,\nincluding one\u2019s human master]), a hard-wired\nproto-prohibition that serves to automatically imbue the\nsocially transmitted rules of a certain kind (those concerned with\none\u2019s impact on the utilities of others) with a special\n(rule-/authority independent) status that registers as social\ntranscendence on the moral-conventional distinction task and that\nappears to be an aspect of moral competence world-wide. (2009:\n173)\n\n\nHaidt\u2019s findings comparing high and low SES participants suggest\nthat there is substantial and systematic variation in judgments about\nwhich transgressions are socially transcendent. It might be thought\nthat this variation is best explained by differences in socially\ntransmitted rules like those that Haidt and his colleagues have\nexplored in their more recent work on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt\n& Joseph 2007; Graham, Haidt, & Nosek 2009; Haidt 2012;\nGraham, Haidt, Koleva, et al. 2013). But Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin\n(2014) proposed a different, and more disquieting, explanation for\nSES-linked variation in judgments about the social transcendence of\ntransgressions. Social domain theorists recognize that some of the\ntransgressions they classify as conventional can lead to harm by\nupsetting onlookers (as in Nichols\u2019 table manners case) or by\ndisrupting established social routines. But, Royzman and colleagues\nnote, those harms\n\n\nare contingent upon aspects of an existing normative regime\nthat could themselves be deemed arbitrary and modifiable by consensus.\n(2014: 178)\n\n\nBy contrast, the harms caused by what social domain theorists take to\nbe moral transgressions \u201cinvolve acts that are (perceived to be)\nintrinsically harmful to others (Turiel 1983, e.g., p. 44, p.\n221)\u201d (2014: 178). To discern the difference between\ntransgressions that are intrinsically harmful and those that are\ncontingently harmful, one needs to engage in counterfactual thinking.\nOne must ask questions like:\n\nWould it still be harmful to torture a puppy even if everyone in\nthe community thought it was OK? [Yes, it would.] and\nWould it still be harmful to wear pajamas to school even if\neveryone in the community thought it was OK? [No, it\nwouldn\u2019t.]\n\n\nIt is questions like this that are used in some versions of the\nmoral/conventional task to assess whether a transgression is socially\ntranscendent. But, Royzman and colleagues note, not everyone is\nequally inclined to engage in counterfactual thinking or equally good\nat it. And in a striking experiment they found that people with lower\nscores on the Cognitive Reflection Test, which measures people\u2019s\ntendency to give reflective answers instead of following their\nimmediate intuitions, were more likely to judge that behaviors that\nare not intrinsically harmful (like wearing pajamas to work) would not\nbe OK in a culture, even if everyone in that culture had come together\nand decided that it would be OK (Royzman, Landy, & Goodwin\n2014).\n\nRoyzman and colleagues conclude that we should not assume that the\nsort of socioeconomic differences that Haidt found in his\nmoral/conventional task studies are due to fundamentally divergent\nvalues. Rather, since poverty has been linked to impaired cognitive\nperformance, they speculate that the differences between Haidt et\nal.\u2019s high- and low-SES participants is \u201ca product of the\nlow-SES participants\u2019 cognitive limitations\u201d (Royzman,\nLandy, & Goodwin 2014: 187) Needless to say, the suggestion that\nsome of the moral judgments made by low SES people in the USA and\nabroad are the result of impaired cognitive performance is more than a\nbit provocative! Much more work is needed before accepting this\nconclusion, and careful skepticism is warranted: Instead of\nspeculating about the causal role of alleged \u201ccognitive\nlimitations\u201d in explaining why low- and high-SES judgments vary,\nRoyzman and colleagues could have actually collected data from both\nsocio-economic groups and tested the claim directly; unfortunately\nthey didn\u2019t. But if Royzman, Landy, and Goodwin are right, then\nTuriel and other social domain theorists may have been on to something\nimportant when they claimed that harm plays a central role in\ncharacterizing the moral transgressions picked out by the\nmoral/conventional task, though because of their cognitive style\neconomically challenged people may be less able to assess the moral\nimportance of cases involving harms that are not intrinsic.\n",
