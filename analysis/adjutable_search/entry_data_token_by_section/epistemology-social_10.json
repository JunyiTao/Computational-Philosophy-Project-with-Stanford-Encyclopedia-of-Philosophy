Social Epistemology and Society\n\nLet us now move on to see how topics from social epistemology\nintersect with important questions about the proper functioning of\ndemocratic societies, and questions about the dysfunctions in the\nsocial practices bound up in our quest for knowledge.\n5.1 The Social Epistemology of Democracies\n\nA good deal of social epistemology focuses on topics in political\nepistemology.\n\nA large portion of this work is devoted to evaluating the epistemic\nproperties of democratic institutions and practices, falling within\nwhat Alvin Goldman (2010) labeled \u201csystems-oriented\u201d\nsocial epistemology. By a \u201csystem\u201d he meant some entity\nwith various working components and multiple goals. System-oriented\nsocial epistemology asks how best to design systems whose goals\ninclude epistemic goods such as the production or distribution of\nknowledge or true belief. A number of theorists have pursued this\nresearch programme, examining various institutions in democratic\npolitical systems (see e.g. Zollman (2015), Fallis and Matheson\n(2019), O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2019), Miller (2020), and\nFrost-Arnold (2021).)\n\nThe systems-oriented research programme in social epistemology has\nalso been brought to bear on more general questions regarding\ndemocratic politics. Elizabeth Anderson (2006), for example, addresses\nhow the epistemic properties of democratic systems can be designed to\nattain the best possible form of democracy. She provides three\nepistemic models of democracy: the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the\nDiversity Trumps Ability result, and John Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalism. Anderson herself plumps for Dewey\u2019s\nexperimentalist approach, while several others argue for voting\naggregation and the Condorcet Jury Theorem (List and Goodin 2001;\nLandemore 2011), and Singer (2019) defends a version of diversity\ntrumps ability (albeit in connection with scientific teams). By\ncontrast, Claudio Lopez-Guerra (2010), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore\n(2013) and Alex Guerrero (2014) defend a lottery system for selecting\npolitical representatives, contending that the policies that would\nresult would be better than those arrived at through voting. (Estlund\n2008 rejects the core idea of systems-oriented social\nepistemology\u2014 that the epistemic goodness of democratic politics\nis to be sought in the quality of its outcomes\u2014arguing instead\nthat it should be sought in the legitimacy of its procedures.)\n\nPolitically-oriented social epistemologists have also written\nextensively on the epistemic properties of public deliberation. Since\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty, there has been a long\nhistory of attempts to argue for free speech rights on epistemic\ngrounds. This discussion has continued, albeit with many recent\nauthors casting a more skeptical eye. Some, recognizing the pitfalls\nof deliberation under conditions of oppression, continue to defend the\nepistemic potential of deliberation to illuminate social problems\n(Young 2000; Anderson 2010).\n\nIn addition, there is a lively discussion about the role of experts in\ndemocratic politics. One question concerns how non-experts are to\nidentify experts (Goldman 2001 is the locus classicus).\nAnother question concerns how to balance reliance on experts with\ndemocracy\u2019s commitment to deliberation and equality (see e.g.\nKitcher 2011). There is also a question regarding how to square the\ndemocratic legitimacy conferred by public deliberation among equals\nwith the distinctive epistemic authority of experts (see e.g.\nChristiano 2012).\n\nTwo excellent recent handbooks on political epistemology are Hannon\nand De Ridder (2021) and Edenberg and Hannon (2021). (In addition to\nthe topics listed above, these handbooks also delve into such social\nepistemology topics as political disagreement, polarization, and the\nepistemic responsibilities of citizenship.)\n5.2 Misleading Online Content\n\nThe latest challenge confronting the informational state of the public\nis the accelerating spread of misleading content on the internet. Over\nthe last decade it has become increasingly clear that such content is\nwidespread, pernicious, and threatening democratic function.\nPhilosophers have contributed to emerging research on internet\nepistemology in a number of ways. \n\nOne question, relevant to thinking about preventing the harms of\nmisleading content, is how to define and categorize such content. A\ntypical distinction disambiguates misinformation and disinformation,\nwhere the former is false or inaccurate content not intended to\nmislead and the latter is intended to mislead (Fallis 2016, Floridi\n2013). It is increasingly recognized, though, that misleading content\nneed not be false (Fallis 2015, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019),\nleading some to define malinformation which is intended to mislead but\npotentially true or accurate (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). Others have\nchallenged the idea that disinformation needs to be misleading, as\nopposed to producing ignorance (Simion 2023) or otherwise blocking\nsuccessful action (Harris 2023). Given the variety and complexity in\nmisleading online content, some argue that these terms will always be\nimprecise (Weatherall and O\u2019Connor 2019) or that we should\ncarefully describe relevant epistemic failures in any case\n(Habgood-Coote 2019). \n\nA number of researchers have turned to virtue epistemology to think\nabout epistemic failures related to the internet. This work has\nidentified socially-oriented vices that might increase susceptibility\nto misleading content (and increase its sharing), such as Cassam\n(2018)\u2019s epistemic insouciance, which he describes as a careless\nattitude towards expertise, especially when communicating with others.\nLynch (2018) argues that epistemic arrogance, which involves an\nunwillingness to learn from others, undermines the process of public\ndebate. Meyer et al. (2021), in empirical work, found an association\nbetween high scores on an epistemic vice scale and false belief. And\nPriest (2021) worries about the role of epistemic vices among elites,\nsuch as obstructionism (using overly complex language and theory), and\nhow these vices impact public belief. On the other side, authors like\nPorter et al. (2022) and Koetke et al. (2022) argue for the benefits\nof intellectual humility \u2013 an awareness of one\u2019s own\nlimitations and openness to the possibility of being wrong \u2013 in\ncommunities grappling with internet misinformation.\n\nSocial media connections and algorithms determine what content is seen\nto what degree and by whom. There have been concerns that various\naspects of this process may exacerbate false beliefs. Echo chambers,\nwhere individuals select online connections and spaces that\ncontinually \u201cecho\u201d their own beliefs back to them, may\nlead to polarization and prevent disconfirmation of false beliefs\n(Cinelli et al. 2021). Nguyen (2020) gives a more specific analysis of\necho chambers as actively discrediting of those with different\nbeliefs, and disambiguates these from epistemic bubbles where there is\nselective exposure to confirmatory content without the discrediting of\noutsiders. (This analysis is also in line with the empirical work done\nby Ruiz and Nilson (2023).) Both sorts of effects are worrying.\nExacerbating this are tendencies by algorithms to present users with\ndata and opinions that confirm their beliefs and attitudes, because\nthat is precisely the content that users tend to like. This is\nsometimes called the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d or \u201cinformation\nbubble\u201d effect (though these various phenomena are by no means\nclearly delineated) (Pariser 2011, Kitchens et al. 2020). One response\nmight be that platforms should make structural and algorithmic choices\nthat best promote accurate beliefs among users, but it has been widely\nacknowledged that this goes against platform incentives to increase\nengagement. Another difficulty is that as platforms shape algorithms\nto prevent the spread of disinformation, the producers of\ndisinformation are incentivized to adapt and create new forms of\nmisleading content (O\u2019Connor and Weatherall 2019).\n\nAn ill-informed populace may not be able to effectively represent\ntheir interests in a democratic society. In order to protect\ndemocratic functioning, it will be necessary for those fighting online\nmisinformation to keep adapting with the best tools and theory\navailable to them. This includes understanding social aspects of\nknowledge and belief formation. In other words, social epistemology\nhas much to say to those faced with the challenging task of protecting\ndemocracy from misleading content.\n5.3 Socio-Epistemic Dysfunctions\n\nInfluenced by long-standing work in feminism and critical race theory,\nsocial epistemology has attempted to theorize about various types of\ndysfunction in the social practices through which we aim to generate,\ncommunicate, assess, and preserve knowledge. In this subsection we\nhighlight several of these.\n\nIn one of the most influential works in epistemology in the last two\ndecades, Miranda Fricker (2007) introduced the term \u201cepistemic\ninjustice\u201d to designate the sort of injustice which wrongs a\nsubject in their capacity as a knower. Fricker distinguished two\nkinds. \u201cTestimonial\u201d injustice obtains when (on the basis\nof identity-based prejudice) an audience gives less credence to a\nspeaker than she deserves. (Fricker illustrated this sort of injustice\nwith Tom Robinson, a character in To Kill a Mockingbird whose\ntestimony, as a Black man on trial for raping a white woman, was\nprejudicially rejected by the all-white jury.)\n\u201cHermeneutical\u201d injustice obtains when, owing to social\nforces which reflect the interests of certain social groups, a subject\nlacks the concepts for understanding and/or communicating socially\nsignificant aspects of her own experience. (Fricker\u2019s example is\nthe experience of women before the term \u201csexual\nharassment\u201d was coined.) Fricker\u2019s (2007) reflections on\nepistemic injustice have inspired a generation of social philosophers\nto pursue questions in this vicinity. Some have sought to amend or\nqualify Fricker\u2019s definitions (Medina 2011, Mason 2011, Anderson\n2012, Davis 2016, Lackey 2018, Maitra 2018), while others have\nemployed one or another notion of epistemic injustice in new domains,\nincluding social or political contexts (Medina 2012, Dular 2021),\nhealth care (Carel and Kidd 2014), education (Kotzee 2017), and\ncriminal law (Lackey 2023).\n\nA second type of socio-epistemic dysfunction of significant interest\nto social epistemologists is ignorance. Influenced by the seminal work\nof Sandra Harding (1991), Michelle Moody-Adams (1994), Charles Mills\n(1997, 2007), Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Nancy Tuana (2004, 2006),\nKristie Dotson (2011), and Gaile Pohlhaus (2012), among others, social\nepistemologists have begun to characterize how\nignorance\u2014understood as involving either false belief or lack of\ninformation\u2014is distributed, and sometimes willfully maintained,\nin communities. The guiding hypothesis, explicitly formulated by Mills\n(2007) in connection with his notion of \u201cwhite ignorance,\u201d\nis that ignorance in contemporary society patterns in ways that\nreflect the interests of dominant social groups. (Because Mills,\nDotson, and others have argued that this sort of ignorance can be\nwillfully maintained through certain social arrangements, it can be\nsomewhat misleading to label this a \u201cdysfunction.\u201d)\nInteresting work has been done in the \u201cepistemology of\nignorance\u201d in connection with women\u2019s health (Tuana 2004),\nmatters of race (Sullivan and Tuana 2007), gender oppression (Gilson\n2011), and trust in social media (Frost-Arnold (2016)), among other\nareas. This work makes clear that the ignorant subject often lacks\nevidence she ought to have. As such, it challenges the\ntraditional idea that the focus of epistemic assessment should be\nrestricted to how well a subject does with the evidence she has. For\nthis reason, the acquisition and handling of evidence, long a topic in\nfeminist and virtue epistemology, has recently begun to attract the\nattention of social epistemologists as well. (For discussion see\nGoldberg 2017, Lackey 2020, Simion 2021, Woodard and Flores 2023).\n\nTo be sure, there are many other types of dysfunction that are\ndiscussed by social epistemologists. We have already mentioned several\nof these above: misleading online content, polarization, bias, and\necho chambers. Beyond these, social epistemologists have been\ndeveloping concepts for additional types. A general framework for\nunderstanding various dimensions of epistemic oppression can be found\nin Dotson (2014). Regarding additional types themselves, Abramson\n(2014) and McKinnon (2017) treat gaslighting as a socio-epistemic\ndysfunction in which one person consistently questions another\u2019s\nsanity or competence in order to destroy the victim\u2019s\nself-confidence and undermine her sense of self (Ru\u00edz 2020\ndevelops the cultural analogue of this phenomenon); Stanley (2015)\npresents a wide-ranging discussion of propaganda, including its\nsocio-epistemic dimensions; Berenstain (2016) introduces the notion of\nepistemic exploitation, the phenomenon in which members of\nunderrepresented groups are burdened by the expectation of informing\ndominant group members about their experiences; Davis (2018) develops\nthe notion of \u201cepistemic appropriation,\u201d the epistemic\nanalogue of cultural appropriation; Ballantyne (2019) discusses\n\u201cepistemic trespassing,\u201d wherein experts assume authority\nand speak on topics beyond their expertise; and Leydon-Hardy (2021)\nidentifies \u201cepistemic infringement\u201d as the phenomenon in\nwhich one person undermines the epistemic agency of another by\nviolating social and epistemic norms.",
