    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology || Enter Popper\n8.2 Enter Popper\n\nClearly, with this reference to the connection between science and\ndisproof, Bondi has added a distinctly Poppererian element to the\ndeductivist methodology, one which had not previously appeared in the\nworks of any of the earlier members of the hypothetico-deductive\nschool. According to Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, a theory\ncan legitimately be called \u201cscientific\u201d only if that\ntheory makes a prediction that, in principle, can be shown to be\nfalse, or falsified, to use Popper\u2019s own term. Thus\nastrology, for example, fails to be a scientific theory because it\ncannot be falsified: although astrology seems to make predictions,\nthese statements about the future are so vague, so general and\nabstract, that they cannot be tied down to definite claims about\nobservations to be made at a definite time and place. Hence there is\nno explicit observation to be made in falsification. Astronomy, in\ncomparison, makes explicit, specific predictions about what will occur\nin the sky on such-and-such a date, in such-and-such a place. If the\nprediction fails, then we know that the element of astronomical theory\nwhich made the prediction is deficient, maybe even false.\n\nCosmology is a borderline case: since observations of cosmological\nsignificance are so rare and hard-won\u2014Hubble\u2019s observation\nof the red shift was one of the first solid ones\u2014it is very\ndifficult, not to mention brave, to tie one\u2019s cosmological\ntheory to Popper\u2019s falsificationist principle as a guarantee of\nscientific acceptability. But this is exactly what Bondi did.\n\nMuch later Bondi was to make explicit his debt to Popper:\n\nI think the person from whom we had most help on the philosophical\nside was Popper. His analysis of science encouraged one to be\nimaginative, and encouraged one to go for something that was very\nrigid and therefore empirically disprovable. (Bondi 1990, p. 194)\n\n",
