Both the scholarly philosophical\nneglect and the popular spiritual embrace of Eckhart have, in no small\npart, to do with his contemporary recasting as a\n\u201cmystic\u201d\u2014a designation which has led present-day\nscholars to downplay his intellectual importance and spiritual seekers\nto up-play his esotericism. Even the German title Meister\n(\u201cmaster\u201d) is often mistakenly assumed to reflect\nEckhart\u2019s status as a spiritual \u201cguru\u201d of sorts,\nwhen in reality it derives from the Latin honorific magister,\na title granted only to the most learned of university-trained\nscholars of his day. Yet neither the contemporary philosophers who\nignore him nor the new-age enthusiasts who adore him adequately\ncapture the complexity of the Meister, who was both a sophisticated\nand well-respected intellectual\u2014a master of letters, learning,\nand language\u2014as well as a spiritual leader of his order helping\nthe men and women under his instruction to master the \u201cwayless\nways\u201d of leaving the self, knowing God, and living well. This\nentry seeks to show the ways in which the intellectual, spiritual, and\nethical aspects of Eckhart\u2019s thought are deeply intertwined,\nusing his unique approach to language and communication as a guiding\nthread.\n\nUnfortunately, the neglect in philosophical circles of Eckhart\u2019s\nintellectual contributions to the history of philosophy makes it\ndifficult to find a comprehensive list of the\nmagister\u2019s (confirmed) Latin and German works, and\nthere is to-date no complete English translation of the Latin works.\nAdditionally, various editors and translators over the years have\nnumbered the German sermons differently, often leading to confusion\nregarding the ordering and cross-referencing of the sermons. For this\nreason, citations of primary-source material in this entry provide,\nfirst, the abbreviation of the relevant work with the section number,\nfollowed by the volume and page number from the German critical\nedition (LW or DW for Lateinische Werke and\nDeutsche Werke, respectively), as well as the page number of\nthe English translation when possible. With respect to Eckhart\u2019s\nGerman sermons, I have used Quint\u2019s numbering, as it is the most\nwidely recognized by Eckhart scholars (and that used by the critical\neditions). Finally, where relevant, I have cited LW I/2, as opposed to\nLW I, since the former is also used in the more accessible (and\naffordable) Latin-German study edition.\n", "toc": [{"#Life": "1.

Life\n\nMeister Eckhart, also known as Eckhart of Hochheim, was born around\n1260, most likely in or near the German village of Tambach near the\nThuringian capital of Erfurt, where he probably entered into the\nDominican order sometime during his late teenage years. It is unclear\nwhere Eckhart completed his initial studies, but the obvious influence\nof Albert the Great on his intellectual formation indicates that he\nmay have studied in Cologne sometime before Albert\u2019s death in\n1280 (Sturlese 2013: 125\u201326). What is certain is that Eckhart\neventually made his way to study theology in Paris, where he was made\na lecturer on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences in 1293. Fresh\nfrom the university at Paris, the new baccalaureus theologiae\nreturned to Erfurt in 1293\u20134, this time as the prior of the\nDominican monastery where he had spent his early years.\n\nIn 1302, Eckhart was called to return to Paris for two years to occupy\nthe external Dominican chair as magister actu regens, a\nposition considered the pinnacle of academic success in the medieval\nscholastic world, after which he was called back to Erfurt to serve as\nthe provincial for the newly-established province of Saxony. There he\nwas charged with the oversight and administration of at least 47\nconvents and monasteries in Eastern and Northern Germany and the Low\nCountries. During this time, he established three new convents for\nwomen and was additionally appointed general vicar of Bohemia. Yet\nEckhart remained as much an academic as an administrator, and the\nstatus he enjoyed as a scholar and teacher is reflected by the fact\nthat, in 1311, he was called back to Paris to serve a second term as\nmagister, a distinction previously only granted to Thomas\nAquinas (McGinn 2001: 2ff.; Ruh 1996: 239ff.). In the summer of 1313,\nEckhart left Paris for Strasbourg in the Alsace region to function as\nthe special vicar for the Dominican Master General. Over the next\ndecade, he had close contact with several female convents, as well as\nwith the growing communities of Beguines in the region, and he is\nrecorded as having made personal visits to the convents of St.\nKatharinental, \u00d6tenbach, and Unterlinden (McGinn 2001: 10). It is\nnot unlikely that his encounter with these female religious\ncommunities played a role in Eckhart\u2019s increasing focus on his\nvernacular preaching during this period (Largier 1998), and some\nscholars (e.g., Milem 2013) have even proposed that many of the\nMeister\u2019s German sermons were aimed at a female audience\ninterested in pursuing unitive and/or ecstatic religious experiences,\nthough the exclusivity and aims of his audience in this respect is\n(rightly) considered controversial (cf. Wegener 2013).\n\nEver the scholar, however, Eckhart left Strasbourg sometime between\n1323\u201324 to return to the German center of Dominican learning,\nCologne (Senner 2013). In the years that followed, he was presented\nwith several lists of purportedly heretical ideas and passages he had\nwritten or preached. The first list, presented to him in 1325 by\nNicholas of Strasbourg (who was otherwise generally supportive of\nEckhart\u2019s preaching), likely contained passages from the\nBook of Divine Consolation drawn up by two\n\u201crenegade\u201d Dominicans, Hermann of Summo and William of\nNideggen, who only accused Eckhart of heresy after themselves being\naccused of corruption (Tobin 1986: 11; Senner 2013: 50\u201352). In\nresponse, Eckhart appears to have written a now-lost treatise, the\nRequisitus, that satisfied Nicholas for the time being.\nWilliam was eventually reassigned to a priory in Aachen, while Hermann\nwas later found guilty of being a false accuser (among other, more\nserious crimes) and imprisoned in the priory jail, but it would appear\nthat both of them would manage to dodge their punishments and continue\nto accuse Eckhart of heresy (Senner 2013: 52\u201353). In 1326 they\npresented the Archbishop of Cologne Henry II of Virneburg (who was\nsignificantly less sympathetic to Eckhart\u2019s cause than Nicholas)\nwith their list of 74 purportedly heretical propositions from\nEckhart\u2019s Latin and German works. A further list from the German\nsermons seems to have been drawn up later, and there may have been\nsubsequent lists (Tobin 1986: 10). On September 26, 1326, Eckhart\nappeared before the diocesan inquisitorial commission to speak to the\ncharges of heresy in a trial that, as Bernard McGinn notes, was\n\u201cunprecedented\u201d for the late middle ages (McGinn 2001:\n15). In his defense at these proceedings, Eckhart cleverly appealed to\nthe distinction between intellect and will central to the debates\nbetween the Franciscans and the Dominicans. Even if he were in error\nregarding certain theological statements, he maintained, this was\nmerely an intellectual failure and could not by itself amount\nto his having committed heresy, since the latter is, properly\nunderstood, a volitional matter (Senner 2013: 61; McGinn\n2001: 15). Eckhart thereby publicly declared that he was willing to\nretract any and all errors the commission might find.\n\nIn the Spring of 1327, Eckhart set off for the papal court at Avignon\nto appeal directly to the pope, who set up a commission of theologians\nto examine the lists from the Cologne hearings. By this point, the\nconcern was no longer whether Eckhart was a heretic (perhaps\ndue to the careful distinction he had drawn in his earlier defense)\nbut rather to determine the orthodoxy of the propositions\nthemselves. The list was ultimately reduced to 28 propositions, all of\nwhich were eventually deemed by the commission to be as\n\u201cheretical as the words sound\u201d (LW V:569), indicating that\nits members were inclined to take the propositions literally and out\nof context, despite Eckhart\u2019s protestations that he had been\nmisunderstood (Senner 2013: 75\u201376). These articles range from\nthe claim that the world has existed from eternity to the idea that\nGod\u2019s glory is also revealed in evil to assertions that God is\nglorified in those who renounce the pursuit of inwardness, holiness,\nreward, or heaven. Many of the articles center on claims that hint at\nnotions of apotheosis, deification, and/or the identification of the\nhuman soul with the (or a) Son of God. (For a full list, see EE\n77\u201381 and MW 26\u201328.)\n\nThe commission\u2019s findings, however, were merely a recommendation\nto the pope, and unfortunately, by the time the pope\u2019s official\nconsistorium with the cardinals was able to take place,\nEckhart had fallen ill and most likely died on January 28, 1328\n(Senner 1997). On March 27, 1329, Pope John XXII issued the bull\nIn agro dominico, which followed the commission\u2019s\nrecommendation in condemning all 28 articles, but ordered them\naccording to various levels of severity, eleven of them being merely\nclaimed to be \u201clikely misunderstood\u201d. The bull was sent to\nCologne with the order that it be published, so that\n\n\nthe hearts of the simple [people to whom Eckhart had preached such\narticles] which are easily seduced [\u2026] may not be filled with\nthe errors contained in them. (LW V:602; quoted in Senner 2013:\n84)\n\n\nNowhere in the bull or its accompanying documents, however, was\nMeister Eckhart himself ever declared a heretic.\n2. Influences\n\nAlthough Eckhart was an innovative and controversial figure, he was\nalso a product of his time\u2014and by those standards not nearly as\nheterodox as he is often made out to be. While much has been made of\nthe accusations against him, there has also been a significant effort\nby various Eckhart scholars to rehabilitate the Meister\u2019s\northodoxy and demonstrate his adherence to the theological and\nphilosophical doctrines from which his thought arose.\n\nSimilar to other thirteenth-century Dominicans of the Cologne School\nlike Albert the Great (d. 1280), Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), and\nDietrich of Freiburg (d. 1310)\u2014all of whom exercised a\nsignificant influence on the young Dominican\u2014Eckhart\u2019s\nthought represents a kind of synthesis between, on the one hand, a\ndeeply Augustinian and Dionysian Christian Neoplatonism (one strongly\ninfluenced by Proclus and the Liber de causis) and, on the\nother hand, the late medieval scholastic Aristotelianism of the\nuniversities. Eckhart\u2019s own analysis of Aristotle was not\nseldomly filtered through the Jewish and Islamic sources available to\nhim in Latin\u2014most especially in the works of Maimonides,\nAvicenna, Averroes, and Avicebron (Palazzo 2013; Schwartz 2002).\nIndeed, in Eckhart\u2019s Latin works only Aristotle is cited more\nfrequently than Maimonides, leading Bernard McGinn to claim that\n\u201cno Christian author of the Middle Ages [\u2026] knew\nMaimonides better or reflected greater sympathy for his view\u201d\n(McGinn 1986: 17). In a similar vein, Kurt Flasch (2006 [2015])\ncharacterizes Eckhart as having inherited the \u201cspirit of Arabic\nphilosophy\u201d.\n\nWith respect to lesser known figures and movements, Eckhart\u2019s\nrelationship with his female contemporaries, especially Dominican nuns\nand the Beguines in Strasbourg\u2014as well as the similarities in\naspects of his thought to the work of Rhineland contemplatives like\nHadewijch of Antwerp (d. 1260), Mechthild of Magdeburg (d. c.1282),\nand especially Marguerite Porete (burned at the stake in Paris in 1310\nfor heresy)\u2014have been the subject of much speculation. It is\nstill debated as to whether Eckhart was explicitly familiar with\nMarguerite\u2019s Mirouer des simples \u00e2mes anienties\n[The Mirror of Simple Annihilated Souls]. We do know that he\nshared a residence with her inquisitor, William of Paris, the year\nafter her execution, and there are certainly striking parallels\nbetween some of the ideas in Eckhart\u2019s sermons and\nMarguerite\u2019s Mirouer (e.g., the metaphor of the\n\u201cspark\u201d of the soul and the divine as abyss, the notions\nof poverty or freedom of spirit, the negation or\n\u201cannihilation\u201d of the self-possessed soul, and the\nhypernomian allusions to the detached soul\u2019s transcendence of\nthe virtues). But their thought also diverges in significant\nways\u2014as can be seen, for example, in the stark contrast between\nEckhart\u2019s staunch intellectualism and Marguerite\u2019s\nrepeated emphasis on the supremacy of love over reason and intellect.\nThus, whether the parallels between the two more likely suggest a\ndirect connection between Marguerite and Eckhart, a third party who\nexercised influence on both individuals, or the cultural influence of\nideas that were simply \u201cin the air\u201d in the late thirteenth\nand early fourteenth centuries remains a topic for further research.\n(For more on comparisons between medieval women\u2019s spirituality\nand Eckhart\u2019s thought see, among others, Wegener 2013; Hollywood\n1995 [2001]; Sells 1994; and the collection of essays in McGinn\n1994.)\n3. Lebemeister or Lesemeister? Eckhart as Mystic, Theologian, and Philosopher\n\nIn much contemporary spiritual literature, various popular new-age\ntomes, and not a little academic scholarship, Meister Eckhart has been\ncharacterized first and foremost as a mystic\u2014and only\nsecondarily as a theologian or philosopher. This characterization has\nto do, in part, with the recovery of Eckhart\u2019s vernacular works\nby nineteenth-century Romantic and Idealist movements in Germany for\nwhom the so-called \u201cmystics\u201d symbolized the\nrepresentatives and custodians of \u201ctrue\u201d religion (Schmidt\n2003). (Eckhart\u2019s more \u201cscholarly\u201d Latin writings\nwere not discovered until the second half of the nineteenth century by\nwhich time he had already been claimed for mysticism.) Relatedly,\nEckhart\u2019s vernacular works lent themselves well to a growing\ninterest in religious perennialism and a desire in the burgeoning\nfields of religious studies, philosophy of religion, and religious\npsychology to locate parallels between the attitudes, experiences, and\nideas found in Christianity and those of other religious and spiritual\ntraditions (Griffioen 2021: 9\u201312). Already in Volume 2 of\nThe World as Will and Representation (1844), Schopenhauer\ncompared Eckhart\u2019s ideas with those found in Buddhism, Sufism,\nand the Upanishads (Schopenhauer 1844 [2018]), and Rudolf Otto\ncompared the Meister to Shankara in his influential 1926 Mysticism\nEast and West (Otto 1926 [1932]). Since then, Eckhart has often\nbeen set alongside other figures sometimes claimed for\nmysticism\u2014e.g., Abraham Abulafia, Ibn \u2018Arabi, Rumi,\nZhuangzi, and Zhu Xi, to name just a few\u2014and his work has been\ncompared to traditions as wide ranging as Advaita Vedanta,\nConfucianism, Sufism, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and Zoharic Kabbalism,\namong others. Indeed, Eckhart remains a significant touchstone for\nscholars of comparative mysticism today. (For a few direct comparisons\nsee, e.g., Ueda 2018, 1977; Griffioen & Zahedi 2018; Zarrabi-Zadeh\n2016; Wolfson 2013; Zheng 2016b, 2016a; Heitz 2007; Shah-Kazemi 2006;\nSuzuki 1957.)\n\nEckhart\u2019s modern reception as a mystic is unfortunately also due\nto entrenched scholarly biases, both past and present, against\nmedieval vernacular spiritual and theological writing. Quite often,\nthe category commonly referred to as \u201cvernacular\nmysticism\u201d has been misleadingly set up as an irrationalist foil\nto medieval scholasticism, leading to the outright dismissal as\n\u201cnon-philosophical\u201d of many traditions and genres of late\nmedieval religious writing\u2014especially those penned by women and\nlaypersons (Griffioen 2022). And although Eckhart belonged to neither\nof these social categories, his connections to such groups and the air\nof heterodoxy surrounding his later work may have played a significant\nrole in the perpetuation of his contemporary reputation as a mystic\nand his partial exclusion from the scholastic canon. (It is telling\nthat, although an English translation of Eckhart\u2019s German\nsermons appeared already in 1909, his Latin works have never been\ncompletely translated into English.)\n\nAt the same time, in contrast to his Beguine counterparts,\nEckhart\u2019s role as a speculative thinker and champion of natural\nphilosophy did not go wholly unnoticed. For example, his adoption by\nGerman Idealists like Franz von Baader and G.W.F. Hegel transformed\nthe Dominican master into \u201cthe father of modern\nspeculation\u201d in the German-speaking world (Moran 2013:\n669\u201370) and served to make him culturally and philosophically\nrelevant in a way \u201cunmatched in the German intellectual sphere\nin the second half of the nineteenth and for much of the twentieth\ncentury\u201d (O\u2019Regan 2013: 666). However, this also resulted\nin twentieth-century German philosophers like Martin Heidegger\nadapting Eckhartian terms like Gelassenheit (\u201cthe state\nof letting-go\u201d or \u201creleasement\u201d) for their own\nphilosophical purposes, further obscuring the Meister\u2019s own use\nof such terms, as well as the rebranding of Eckhart by the National\nSocialists as the progenitor of a uniquely \u201cGerman\u201d\nChristianity (Moran 2013: 675). However, although Eckhart\u2019s\nplayful use of his vernacular tongue was indeed distinctive, and there\nis certainly a Rhenish-Flemish spiritual tradition to which he can be\nsaid to belong, there is nothing particularly \u201cGerman\u201d\nabout his theology. (Or, if there is, he has other\n\u201cGerman\u201d thinkers like Albert or Dietrich to thank for\nit.)\n\nMore recently, scholars like John Caputo have seen in Eckhart\u2019s\nthought an early critique of what has come to be known as\n\u201contotheology\u201d (Caputo 1975), placing him squarely in a\nhistorical lineage of thinkers taken to anticipate contemporary\nphenomenology and Continental philosophical theology. Others like Kurt\nFlasch place Eckhart in a more recognizably analytic lineage, focusing\non his\n\n\nattempts to prove those theses generally considered essential tenets\nof Christian thought with what he considers to be a purely rational\nmethod. (Flasch 2006 [2015: 15\u201316])\n\n\nStill, we should not be so hasty to completely disassociate Eckhart\nwith \u201cmystical theology\u201d altogether, at least as the term\nwas commonly understood in the late middle ages, in which it was\nassociated less with religious experience and more with a special kind\nof hermeneutical expertise (Griffioen 2021: 1\u20132;\nJantzen 1995: 59ff.). Several places in the Dominican\u2019s work\ndiscuss his self-described aim as a teacher and preacher to uncover\nthe \u201cmystical\u201d (i.e., \u201chidden\u201d) meanings lying\nunder the surface of Holy Scripture, a task that for Eckhart was\nsimultaneously speculative and practical, involving both the pursuit\nof truth and the edification of the soul. Moreover, although Eckhart\nrarely speaks of anything resembling mystical\nexperience\u2014in fact, his work might be better\ncharacterized as \u201canti-experiential\u201d (Yadav 2016; Van Dyke\n2010)\u2014the ideas expressed in both his German sermons and his\nLatin writings do appear to set out a spiritual program of the kind\nthat has traditionally been identified with apophatic (and especially\nDionysian) mysticism. For this reason, we might do better to think of\nhis work as embodying a kind of speculative\nmystagogy\u2014an edificatory spiritual itinerary grounded in a\ncomplex philosophical cosmology and anthropology, fused to a\nsophisticated Trinitarian doctrine of God, and culminating in (without\naiming at!) the intellectual realization of the unity of the Divine\nand human natures.\n\nIndeed, to assume that Eckhart\u2019s intellectual and pastoral tasks\nwere completely divorced from one another fails to capture the\nrichness of his thought. Eckhart has often been called both a\nLesemeister (\u201cmaster of learning\u201d) and a\nLebemeister (\u201cmaster of living\u201d), and it does not\nseem inappropriate to characterize him as simultaneously occupying the\nroles of mystic, theologian, and philosopher, even in his written\nworks (McGinn 2005: 108ff.; Ruh 1996: 229ff.). However we choose to\nlabel him, Eckhart\u2019s thought has been taken up (and adapted,\nrevised, or repurposed) by a wide range of figures and movements,\nincluding proponents of Thomism, negative theology, ecological\ntheology, liberation theology, analytic philosophy, Continental\nphilosophy, phenomenology, feminist theory, Marxist theory, and other\nintellectual circles\u2014as well as by spiritualists, artists, new\nage gurus, and those simply seeking spiritual or existential guidance,\ndemonstrating his relevance for thinkers and movers from all walks of\nlife.\n4. Saying and Unsaying: Language and the Philosophical Eckhart\n\nJust as it is difficult to separate Eckhart the philosopher from\nEckhart the theologian or Eckhart the mystic, it is often equally\ndifficult to systematically tease apart Eckhart\u2019s speculative\nmetaphysics from his epistemological, practical, and pastoral views.\nTo be sure, with respect to the debate between the Dominicans and the\nFranciscans regarding the primacy of intellect versus will, Eckhart\nfalls decidedly on the side of his order, emphasizing that intellect\nand our rational nature (Middle High German:\nvern\u00fcnfticheit) are \u201cnobler\u201d than the will.\nHowever, this does not mean that Eckhart\u2019s philosophical focus\nis solely or even primarily on the cognitive or even the\nrational, at least as these terms are employed today. Even if\nhe agrees with his fellow Dominicans that human beings\u2019 rational\nnature represents the aspect in which they most closely resemble the\nDivine, not only does the late medieval understanding of\n\u201crational nature\u201d goes far beyond the mere ability to\nreason, Eckhart himself claims that true wisdom and genuine knowledge\nof God involves leaving reason (or at least discursive\nreasoning) behind (Van Dyke 2019, 2022). This\n\u201csapiential\u201d approach establishes a tight connection\nbetween cosmology (the \u201ctop-down\u201d order of reality and\ndivine creation), the pursuit of wisdom (the \u201cbottom-up\u201d\norder of knowledge and human intellection), and the perfection of the\nhuman being (a rightly-ordered will grounded in the divine reality).\nStill, as discussed in more detail below, creating, knowing, and\nwilling all involve fundamental motions of intellection for Eckhart:\nontologically on the part of God (in \u201cbirthing\u201d creation\nvia an \u201coverflowing\u201d act of divine causal knowing),\nepistemically and spiritually within the human being (in\n\u201cbirthing the Word\u201d in the depths of the soul via the\nnon-teleological \u201cnon-activity\u201d of silent\ncontemplation).\n\nOne way of thinking about how the various vertices of Eckhart\u2019s\nthought are connected to each other is to explore his nuanced approach\nto and use of language in the pursuit of what his student,\nHeinrich Seuse (Henry Suso), would later characterize in his widely\nread Horologium Sapientiae as the highest form of philosophy,\na philosophia spiritualis (one which Seuse took Eckhart to\nembody). Not only does the Meister engage in a kind of \u201cserious\nplay\u201d with words and language in both his Latin and German\nwritings, much of his work ultimately revolves around the ways in\nwhich words, especially understood as \u201csigns\u201d or\n\u201cimages\u201d, can both reveal and obscure. This tension is\nplayed out in a dynamic, distinctly Eckhartian dialectic that moves\nback and forth between saying and \u201cunsaying\u201d (Sells 1994),\nunivocity and equivocity (Mojsisch 1983 [2001]; Wendlinder 2014),\nspeech and silence (Duclow 1984)\u2014between the limits of finite\nhuman language and the self-communication of the Divine Intellect in\nthe \u201cEternal Word\u201d (i.e., Christ). In fact, despite his\nstrong apophatic tendencies, the speculative aspect of Eckhart\u2019s\nmystagogy might best be characterized as a philosophy of the\nWord, according to which the second person of the Christian\nTrinity (understood as the divine logos or scholastic\nratio) represents the metaphysical threshold between the\nhuman and the divine, as well as the medium by which the timeless,\nsingular Godhead (the \u201cOne\u201d of Neoplatonist philosophy) is\n\u201ctranslated\u201d\u2014linguistically, epistemically, and even\nontologically\u2014into the discursivity and multiplicity\ncharacteristic of the grammar, thought, and very existence of\ncreatures.\n\nTherefore, although it is to some extent misleading and anachronistic\nto carve up Eckhart\u2019s thought into distinct philosophical\nsubdisciplines, to borrow one of Eckhart\u2019s favorite\n\u201chermeneutical keywords\u201d (Ruh 1985: 96)\u2014namely\nin quantum (MHG: als verre)\u2014it may\nnevertheless be helpful to explore his philosophical views insofar\nas they might be said to fall under various contemporary\nphilosophical categories, using his approach to language,\ninterpretation, and communication as a guide. In practice, however,\nthese different aspects of his philosophical system were not intended\nto be thought independently of one another.\n5. Faith and Philosophy: Eckhart\u2019s Hermeneutical Approach\n\nThe best way to understand Eckhart\u2019s views on the relationship\nbetween revelation and reason, faith and philosophy, is to explore its\nrelevance with respect to his views on the interpretation of Scripture\nin the Opus tripartitum\u2014a novel orientation toward\nexegesis that would become increasingly prominent in his later work,\nperhaps as a result of his encounter with Beguine spirituality (Ruh\n1996: 303; Largier 1998). To begin with, Eckhart explicitly maintains\nin several passages that the truths of Scripture are wholly\ncommensurate with those derivable via natural philosophy, and in the\nCommentary on John he writes that\n\n\nholy scripture can be interpreted [\u2026] so that what the\nphilosophers have written about the natures and properties of things\nagree with it, especially since everything that is true, whether in\nbeing or knowing, in scripture or in nature, proceeds from one source\nand one root of truth.\n\n\nHe even goes so far as to claim that\n\n\nMoses, Christ and the Philosopher teach the same thing, differing only\nin the way they teach, namely as worthy of belief [Moses], as probably\nor likely [Aristotle], and as truth [Christ]. (In Ioh. n.185;\nLW III:154\u20135; quoted in McGinn 1981: 27)\n\n\nImportantly, however, the exegetical tendency in Eckhart to blur the\nboundaries between theology and philosophy is not a matter of\ndownplaying the centrality of revelation; rather, it is more\nexpressive of his desire to demonstrate just how much philosophy can\nbe found \u201chidden under the image and surface of the literal\nsense\u201d of Scripture (In Gen. II n.1; LW I/2:333; EE 92;\ncf. also Tobin 1986: 25ff.).\n\nIn this sense, Eckhart\u2019s approach to the question of revelation\nand reason is less akin to later Enlightenment projects that would\nsubject purportedly revealed Scripture to rational verification.\nRather, it is just the other way around: reason and natural philosophy\ncan also be used to illuminate the truths and \u201chidden\nmeanings\u201d revealed in Scripture (Ruh 1996: 295). Unlike\nphilosophy, Eckhart thinks, Scripture by itself does not\nprove the truths revealed within it, but rather\n\u201cparabolically intimates in hidden fashion [\u2026] what we\n[elsewhere] prove and declare about matters divine, ethical and\nnatural\u201d (In Gen. II n.4; LW I/2:336; EE 95). The job\nof the exegete and the preacher, then, is to extract this hidden (or\n\u201cmystical\u201d) meaning from the text and to clarify it for\nthe audience, using whatever tools she has at her\ndisposal\u2014including those of rational argumentation and natural\nphilosophy. Thus, in his discussion of John 1:1 (\u201cIn the\nbeginning was the Word\u201d), Eckhart notes that\n\n\nin interpreting this Word and everything else that follows my\nintention is the same as in all my works\u2014to explain what the\nholy Christian faith and the two Testaments maintain through the help\nof the natural arguments of the philosophers. (In Ioh. n.2;\nLW III:4; EE 122\u20133)\n\n\nHowever, unlike the traditional \u201cfourfold\u201d hermeneutical\nmethod employed by many medieval scholars, which usually appeals to\neach of the literal/historical, allegorical, moral/tropological, and\nanagogical/eschatological senses of particular Biblical passages in\nturn, Eckhart\u2019s biblical exegesis largely divorces what we today\nwould call the \u201cliteral\u201d reading of the text from the\nmeaning he draws out of it in ways that often strike modern readers as\nremarkably idiosyncratic. There is some evidence that Eckhart\u2019s\nhermeneutical method seems to have been intentionally\ndisruptive\u2014a way of shocking his medieval audiences out of their\ncomplacency and opening them up to new and \u201cdeeper\u201d ways\nof (philosophically, theologically, and spiritually) encountering\nfamiliar passages (Tobin 1986: 23). His so-called\n\u201cparabolic\u201d method takes a dehistoricized and\ndecontextualized approach to Scripture, in which a passage is\ndissected into individual words, phrases, or sentences, which are then\ngiven particular philosophical, theological, or metaphorical glosses\nand sometimes recombined with other similarly interpreted biblical\npassages in what McGinn calls \u201ca dense web of\nintertextuality\u201d (McGinn 2005: 112). It also provides multiple,\nnot necessarily commensurate interpretations, so that \u201cthe\nreader can freely take now one and now the other as seems useful to\nhim\u201d (In Ioh. n.39; LW III:33; EE 135). This pragmatic\napproach served an explicitly pastoral function, insofar as the\npreachers and clerics under Eckhart\u2019s tutelage would have\nencountered different situations in their vocations that might call\nfor different approaches to Scripture. But it was also intellectually\nlegitimate, Eckhart thought, insofar as every true sense \u201ccomes\nfrom the Truth itself\u201d (In Gen. II n.2; LW I/2:334; EE\n93). In fact, for Eckhart, all remotely true senses found in Scripture\ncan be understood as literal senses, \u201csince the literal\nsense is that which the author [\u2026] intends, and God is the\nauthor of holy scripture\u201d (ibid.).\n\nFrom an epistemic standpoint, Eckhart may have seen this polyphonic\nhermeneutical method as providing a way for finite and limited humans\nto mirror the infinite and all-encompassing divine\nperspective\u2014namely, by using a kind of deliberate\nmulti-perspectivity to achieve a more comprehensive and\nobjective \u201cGod\u2019s-eye view\u201d, one which (in the human\ncase) discursively subsumes all things under the unified aspect of the\ndivine logos, allowing the human mind to reflect, albeit\nimperfectly, the timeless, or eternally present,\nn\u00fb/nunc of the divine Intellect (McGinn 2005: 112).\n6. Esse or Intelligere? Eckhart on God and Creation\n\nPerhaps due to this pragmatic and multi-perspectival approach, Eckhart\nis not always entirely clear when it comes to the nature of God on\nwhich, if any, of the so-called transcendentals or divine\nperfections (being, truth/understanding, unity, or goodness) he takes\nto have conceptual or metaphysical priority. For example, in the\nopening sentence to the \u201cPrologue to the Book of\nPropositions\u201d in the Opus tripartitum, Eckhart appears\nto follow his Dominican predecessor Thomas Aquinas in giving\nbeing place of priority\u2014though he subtly reverses\nThomas\u2019s emphasis on the idea that God is being itself,\nasserting instead: Esse est deus (Prol. op. prop.\nn.11; LW I/2:29; PQP 93). Elsewhere, he speaks of God as\n\u201cexistence itself\u201d (In Exod. n.21; LW II:28; TP\n48), or as \u201cthe fullness of all existence [plenitudo omnis\nesse]\u201d, which \u201ccan have nothing outside of it\u201d\n(ibid. n.48; LW II:52; TP 58). However, in the first of the\nParisian Questions, Eckhart boldly states that\n\n\nit is not my present opinion that God understands because he exists,\nbut rather that he exists because he understands. God is an intellect\nand understanding [intellectus et intelligere], and his\nunderstanding itself is the ground of his existence. (Qu.\nPar. 1 n.4; LW V:40; PQP 45)\n\n\nIn fact, not only does Eckhart claim here that \u201camong [the]\nperfections intelligence comes first and then being or\nexistence\u201d (ibid. n.6; LW V:43; PQP 47), he claims that\n\u201ceverything in God transcends existence\u201d (ibid.\nn.8; LW V:44; PQP 48) and that \u201cnothing in him has the nature of\nbeing\u201d (ibid. n.10; LW V:46; PQP 49).\n\nThese seemingly inconsistent statements themselves correspond to two\nways the Meister discusses God\u2019s creation of the universe and\nthe status of the creatures that emerge from God\u2019s creative act.\nThe first involves what Bernard McGinn (2001, 2005), following Alain\nde Libera (1990), has called a metaphysics of flow, involving\na sort of \u201cspilling over\u201d of the divine plenitude of being\ninto creation. The second\u2014perhaps best described as a form of\ncausative epistemology\u2014maintains that the\ndivine\u2019s thinking or knowing all things is what both formally\ngrounds and efficiently causes those things to come to be. The former\naccount of creation, in which Eckhart commonly uses maternal metaphors\nto represent creation as a kind of ontological \u201cemanation\u201d\nfrom the \u201cpregnant\u201d Godhead (McGinn 2001: 84\u201385), is\ncommonly cited in discussions of the Meister\u2019s\n\u201cmystical\u201d Neoplatonism. The latter account, in contrast,\nis sometimes invoked by contemporary scholars to highlight the\nDominican\u2019s adherence to a form of Aristotelian intellectualism\nand his commitment to the doctrine of the primacy of intellect over\nwill (or, for Eckhart, even over being itself). To see how Eckhart can\nconsistently maintain both views, it will be important to more closely\nexamine both his doctrine of analogy and his understanding of the role\nof the divine logos as an intermediary between God and\ncreature. First, however, it will help to take a brief look at each of\nthese accounts on their own.\n6.1 The Boiling (Over) of Being: Eckhart\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics of Flow\u201d\n\nIn his discussion of Exodus 3:14 (\u201cI am who I am\u201d),\nEckhart speaks of God as \u201cthe fullness of existence and full\nexistence [plenitudo esse et plenum esse]\u201d and\n\u201cnothing else but pure existence [nihil aliud nisi purum\nesse]\u201d (In Exod. n.74; LW II:77; TP 68). This\n\u201cpure naked existence [purum esse et nudum\nesse]\u201d, he maintains, is \u201cwithout any accident,\nwithout anything foreign, [pure] substance without quality, without\nthis or that form\u201d and is \u201cabove accident, species, and\ngenus\u201d (In Exod. n.15; LW II:21; TP 45\u20136).\nMoreover, like Avicenna, Aquinas, and most of his contemporaries, he\naffirms that God\u2019s qualityless existence is identical with\nGod\u2019s essence. Adapting for his own purposes the metaphors of\n\u201cboiling\u201d employed by scholastic thinkers like Albert the\nGreat and Dietrich of Freiburg, and drawing heavily on the mystical\nimagery of birthing, metalworking, liquid, light, and mirrors\nreminiscent of contemplative authors like Bernard of Clairvaux and\nMarguerite Porete, Eckhart writes:\n\n\n[\u2026] the repetition [in I am who I am] indicates\n[\u2026] a \u201cboiling\u201d or giving birth to itself\n[bullitionem sive parturitionem sui]\u2014glowing in itself,\nand melting and boiling in and into itself, light that totally forces\nits whole being in light and into light [lux in luce et in lucem\nse toto se totum penetrans] and that is everywhere totally turned\nback and reflected upon itself. (In Exod. n.16; LW\nII:21\u201322; EE 46)\n\n\nHe continues, citing John 1:4 (\u201cIn him was life\u201d):\n\n\n\u201cLife\u201d expresses a type of \u201cpushing out\u201d\n[exseritionem] by which something swells up in itself [in\nse intumescens] and first breaks out totally in itself [se\nprofundit primo in se toto], each part into each part, before it\npours itself forth and \u201cboils over\u201d on the outside\n[effundat et ebulliat extra]. (ibid.)\n\n\nEckhart\u2019s use here and elsewhere of bullitio\n(\u201cboiling\u201d) and ebullitio (\u201cboiling\nover\u201d) is central to his metaphysics of flow. The former term\nrefers to the timeless divine emanation of the Trinity within the\nGodhead. Put in terms of the transcendentals, the Father (here\nidentified with \u201cOneness\u201d or \u201cUnity\u201d)\neternally begets the Son (\u201cTruth\u201d or\n\u201cWisdom\u201d), and together they \u201cbreathe\u201d or\n\u201cspirate\u201d the Holy Spirit\n(\u201cLove\u201d/\u201cGoodness\u201d) (cp. In Sap.\nn.28; LW II:348; TP, 150). This \u201cinner boiling\u201d or\n\u201cswelling\u201d is, for Eckhart, a purely formal emanation. It\ndoes not result in any new beings but rather merely represents the\ninternal dynamism of the Godhead\u2014i.e., the eternal\n\u201cunfolding\u201d of the divine perfections within Godself. The\nlatter ebullitio, on the other hand\u2014the \u201cboiling\nover\u201d or \u201coutflowing\u201d of God\u2019s overabundant\nfullness of being into the world\u2014represents God\u2019s\nconstant, wholly free act of creation ex nihilo that not only\ngrounds the being of all creatures (as their formal cause) but also\ngives rise to their existence (as their efficient cause) and orders\nthem to their proper ends (as their final cause). Put in more\nNeoplatonist terms, it represents the Eckhartian version of the\nontological exitus\u2014the \u201cfall\u201d or\n\u201cdeparture\u201d from divine unity into created multiplicity.\nOn this view, only God has \u201ctrue being\u201d, and creatures\nare, strictly speaking, nothing. Since, for Eckhart,\n\u201cwhatever is outside of God, inasmuch as it is outside of being\nis not something else or [even] something at all\u201d (In\nIoh. n.215; LW III:181, quoted in Tobin 1986: 39), whatever being\ncreatures might be said to have is derivative of the puritas\nessendi that is the Godhead and wholly dependent on their\nparticipation in it.\n\nImportantly, according to the Meister, although God\u2019s inner\nboiling is conceptually prior to God\u2019s ebullitive act,\nand although the Father is logically prior to the Son and\nSpirit, there is no temporal distinction between the\nunfolding of the divine persons within Godself and the flowing out of\nthe universe from the Godhead (In Gen. I, n.7; LW I/2:65; EE\n84\u20135). When considered from the divine perspective, God\u2019s\ninward-directed activity of begetting and spirating Godself and\nGod\u2019s outward-directed activity of forming, birthing, and\nsustaining all of creation occur simultaneously in the \u201ceternal\nnow\u201d and might be said to constitute a single, unified,\nalways-occurring event of divine superabundance. However, viewed from\nour limited and finite human perspective, creation is conceived as a\ntemporal unfolding of the Trinitarian divine image in the\n\u201cflowing out\u201d (\u01d4zganc/uzfliessen) of\nBeing\u2014one which secondarily \u201cin-forms\u201d Truth and is\nultimately expressed in creation through the self-giving nature of\ndivine Love.\n6.2 The Primacy of Intellect: Eckhart\u2019s Causative Epistemology\n\nWhereas Eckhart\u2019s metaphysics of flow characterizes God as a\nkind of fullness of being \u201cboiling over\u201d into\ncreation, his account of creative divine intellection, while\ncontinuous with a long medieval tradition of theories of divine causal\nknowledge, rests on a somewhat surprising idea of God as\nnon-being, a kind of nothingness, or better:\nno-thing-ness. This negative characterization of God is also\nreflected in the metaphors Eckhart employs in his vernacular sermons\nwhen he speaks of God variously as a \u201cdesert\u201d\n(VeM n.25; DW V 119; EE 247), an \u201cabyss\u201d\n(Pr. 29; DW II:84 ; TP 289), a \u201cwasteland\u201d or\n\u201cwilderness\u201d (Pr. 10; DW I:171; TP 265), or\nsimply \u201cthe divine nothing\u201d (Pr. 71; DW III:228;\nTP 324).\n\nThis identification of God with utter non-being, as opposed to total\nfullness of being, rests on Eckhart\u2019s approach to\nintellectus more generally. In human beings, for example, the\nintellect, as a natural power of the soul, is a capacity to take on\nthe representations or \u201ccognitive forms\u201d\n(species) of the objects that it cognizes and, ultimately, to\nbecome in some sense identical with them (an idea Eckhart takes over\nfrom Averroes: cf. Flasch 2006 [2015: 184ff.]). However, when\nconsidered apart from its objects, the created intellect is, strictly\nspeaking, nothing. Its objects lend it form and content, but\ntaken by itself it is \u201cnone of the things it knows\u201d\n(Qu. Par. 2 n.2; LW V:50; PQP 51) and therefore, unlike the\nobjects it cognizes, cannot be considered a determinate thing\u2014a\n\u201cthis or that\u201d (esse hoc et hoc). The intellect\nis, Eckhart maintains, \u201cneither here, nor now, nor a definite\nthing [\u2026], [it] is not a being, nor does it have an\nexistence\u201d (Qu. Par. 2 n.7; LW V:52\u20133; PQP 53).\nIt is more like an emptiness or void\u2014one able to be cognitively\n(in)formed by its intentional objects. Indeed, given Eckhart\u2019s\ncommitment to the identity of the intellect and the intelligible, in\norder to come to know anything, the intellect must itself be nothing.\nIt must be \u201c\u2018unmixed\u2019 with anything [\u2026] so\nthat it might know everything\u201d (Qu. Par. 2 n.2; LW\nV:50; PQP 51).\n\nFurther, on Eckhart\u2019s view the \u201ccognitive forms\u201d\nthat mediate the object to the intellect also lack existence. They may\nproperly be said to \u201chave\u201d objects, but they themselves\nare not substances in which accidents inhere. Neither are they\naccidents because, although they are found in the soul or\nintellect, they do not inhere in it or ontologically depend on it, as\nan accident would in relation to its subject (Qu. Par. 2 n.5;\nLW V:51; PQP 52). And what is neither substance nor accident is,\nsimply put, not a being. Instead, the species for Eckhart is\nmuch more like a relation of intentionality\u2014a way of being\ndirected toward entities\u2014than an entity itself (Caputo\n1975: 108), since on his view such relations are not themselves\nexistents. Thus, while Eckhart appears to build on Aquinas\u2019s\ndistinction between the object (the \u201cquod\u201d) of\nknowledge and the means (the \u201cquo\u201d) by which the\nobject is known, he goes beyond Thomas\u2019s approach to knowledge\nby explicitly characterizing both as non-being (Caputo 1975: 104).\n\nInterestingly, unlike many of his late medieval counterparts, it\nappears to be this \u201cnothingness\u201d of the human intellect in\nits sheer potentiality and indeterminateness that Eckhart sees as most\nclosely mirroring the divine intellect. Indeed, in contrast to the\nAlbertian tradition, it is the possible intellect, not the\nagent intellect, on which the Meister models the divine mind (Keenan\n2013; Goris 2009; Mojsisch 1983 [2001]). For Eckhart, in order to\nunderstand God as the true ground (fundamentum) of Being (and\nof all created beings), God cannot himself have being or\notherwise be a being. Rather, God must first and foremost be a\n\u201cnothing\u201d\u2014i.e., a no(n)-thing. Since\nintellect in and of itself is fundamentally characterized by a kind of\nindeterminate nothingness (one capable, however, of conceiving\neverything), it is more properly said of God than of any other\nattribute, name, or perfection one might ascribe to him. It is in this\nsense that Eckhart can assert in the Parisian Questions that\nGod\u2019s understanding is prior to (and the foundation of)\nGod\u2019s existence.\n\nEckhart famously illustrates this point in German Sermon 9 (DW\nI:141ff.; TP 255ff.) by employing the architectural and sartorial\nimagery common to many of his vernacular works (and found in much\nthirteenth-century Beguine mystical literature). He claims that, while\nconsidering God under the aspect of being (in dem wesene) is\nnot illegitimate, to do so is still to qualify God in some\nway\u2014to make of him something determinate\u2014and therefore\nmerely to see God as he resides in the \u201cantechamber\u201d\n(vorb\u00fcrge) of the temple in which \u201che shines as\nholy\u201d. Likewise, approaching God under the aspect of will or\nlove is to encounter a God still enshrouded (verborgen) in\nthe \u201cmantle of goodness\u201d (kleide der g\u00fcete).\nConsidering God under the aspect of intellection\n(vern\u00fcnfticheit), on the other hand, is to witness the\nwholly \u201cnaked\u201d (bl\u00f4z) Godhead in his true\n\u201ctemple\u201d, unclothed and \u201cstripped\n[entkleidit] of [all] goodness and being\u201d.\n\nOf course, the non-being of the intellect considered in itself is\nwhere the comparison between the human intellect and the divine mind\nends:\n\n\nHere the imagination fails. For our knowledge is different from\nGod\u2019s. His knowledge is the cause of things whereas our\nknowledge is caused by them. (Par. Qu. 1 n.8; LW V:44; PQP\n48)\n\n\nOn Eckhart\u2019s view the human intellect is largely\nreceptive, its potentiality actualized by the\nalready-existing objects in the world that it passively receives. The\nnothingness of the divine intellect, in contrast, is essentially\nproductive. It \u201creaches out\u201d to those things that\nare not and, in cognizing them, simultaneously causes them to be. Put\nin more contemporary terms, human cognition is characterized by a\nmind-to-world direction of fit, with the direction of causation\nproceeding from world to mind. With respect to God, things are exactly\nthe other way around. Divine intentionality causes the world to fit\nwith what the divine mind eternally understands.\n\nEckhart\u2019s idea here is that the divine intellect\n\u201cpre-conceives\u201d both being itself and the entirety of\nknowable forms within it, and in God\u2019s knowing them (as their\nratio), they come to exist. Considered merely as essences or\nforms that have their principle in the divine mind, they are said to\nbe pre-contained \u201cintellectually\u201d like a house in the mind\nof an architect (In sap. n.21; LW, II:34; TP 148), which has\nno being until the architect herself \u201ctrans-forms\u201d the\nidea into a real building. However, in the divine intellect they are\nneither individually distinct nor determinate, but are rather\ncontained as a unity. Moreover, because of the utter Oneness of God,\nas well as Eckhart\u2019s Aristotelian commitment to the identity of\nintellect and intelligible, the unity of the ratio of the\nforms in the divine intellect is nothing other than God himself, in\nthe form of the eternal logos. (On this point, see\n Section 8\n below.) Thus, when the divine intellect knows, it simultaneously\nknows itself and the whole world, and in knowing itself as the formal\ncause of creatures, its self-giving intentionality gives rise to them\nas their efficient and final cause. The potentiality of the divine\nintellect, therefore, is perhaps best thought of as a\npluripotential prescience (or \u201cpre-science\u201d), an\noriginative \u201cpotency\u201d eternally exercised as the divine\nmind knows itself.\n\nImportantly, however, despite his views on God\u2019s intellective\n\u201cconception\u201d of the world, Eckhart need not be viewed as a\npantheist, or even a panentheist. Rather, the universe and everything\nin it reflect the rationality of the divine mind, even as\nthey are distinct from it. To put it in more Eckhartian linguistic\nterms, the existence of the universe is \u201csynonymous\u201d with\n(and wholly dependent upon) God\u2019s act of knowing it (Milne 2010:\n10), but it is not identical with God, even if God is in some\nessential sense \u201cin\u201d it (though not as a proper part). In\nany case, with regard to God Eckhart\u2019s ontology is distinctly\nepistemological (insofar as he gives primacy to intellect over being),\nand his epistemology is distinctly ontological (insofar as the\n\u201cself-reflective\u201d activity of the divine mind is the cause\nof what it knows).\n\nIn one sense, then, Eckhart\u2019s metaphysics of flow and his\ndoctrine of causative knowledge appear to stand in tension with one\nanother. One affirms the identity of being and God (esse est\ndeus), construing being as God\u2019s most fundamental\nattribute, that out of which all creation (over)flows. The other\nnegates being of God (esse formaliter non est in deo) and\ngives God\u2019s intellect priority of place over existence. On the\none hand, this kind of tension is not out of character for Eckhart and\nperhaps simply represents one more example of what might be called his\ndialectic apophaticism\u2014or the attempt to show how God\nboth grounds and utterly transcends the standard categories of human\ncognition and language by pushing common scholastic tropes to their\nconceptual limits. It may also simply be a product of Eckhart\u2019s\npragmatic commitment to presenting various models of God that his\naudiences could \u201cfreely take [\u2026] as seems useful\u201d\nto them, as discussed in\n Section 5\n above. On the other hand, a closer look at the Meister\u2019s\ndoctrine of analogy, when combined with his emphasis on the importance\nof in quantum-qualifications, might reveal one way in which\nEckhart\u2019s intertwined views on language and metaphysics create a\nspace in which God can legitimately be said to be both\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cnon-being\u201d.\n7. Signs of the Divine: Eckhart\u2019s \u201cMetaphysics of Analogy\u201d\n\nMuch has been written on the extent to which Eckhart\u2019s views on\nanalogy draw on and/or depart from those of his philosophical\npredecessors (e.g., Aristotle, Proclus, Augustine, Maimonides, Albert\nthe Great, Dietrich of Freiberg, Henry of Ghent, and especially Thomas\nAquinas)\u2014as well as on whether his approach endorses an analogy\nof attribution, proportionality, or both/neither. Earlier scholars\ntended to view Eckhart\u2019s doctrine of analogy as largely\nderivative of (and perhaps even deficient by comparison with) these\nscholars, but more recent work has focused on the ways in which his\nposition represents something distinctive and innovative. (For a\ncomprehensive overview, see Hackett & Weed 2013.) In any case,\nlike his medieval contemporaries, Eckhart saw analogy as an important\nmeans of spelling out the relationship between God and creatures.\n\nThere were several understandings of analogy in play in the late\nmiddle ages, but the theories one is most likely to encounter have to\ndo with either the so-called \u201canalogy of attribution\u201d or\nthe \u201canalogy of proportionality\u201d. Different thinkers\nemployed these terms in different ways, but in general \u201canalogy\nof attribution\u201d was used to refer to a relation between items in\nwhich some predicate or property is \u201cproperly\u201d or\n\u201cprimarily\u201d said of one of the objects of comparison,\nwhile the others are related to it in a lesser,\n\u201cderivative\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d sense (e.g.,\ncausally or as a sign). \u201cAnalogy of proportionality\u201d, on\nthe other hand, postulates some relevant similarity in the way the\nsubject and predicate of the respective objects of comparison are\nrelated. The former approach to analogy maintains the radical\n(ontological, epistemological, and semantic) gulf between God and\ncreatures. It thereby helped medieval theologians guard against\nworries concerning idolatry and the anthropomorphization of God, while\nstill allowing them to positively identify conceptual lines along\nwhich a (usually causal) relationship could be postulated between God\nand creatures with respect to a particular attribute or property. The\nlatter approach, however, preserves the intuition that our human\nlanguage can actually express genuine truths about God without\ncommitting a category mistake, thereby helping to bridge the gap\nbetween God and creatures (Tobin 1986: 35).\n\nWith respect to the transcendental perfections discussed at the\nbeginning of\n Section 6,\n Aquinas had attempted to \u201csynthesize\u201d analogy of\nattribution and proportionality in what is sometimes called an\n\u201canalogy of participation\u201d. Roughly speaking, he proposed\nthat God has being, wisdom, goodness, and unity essentially, whereas\ncreatures can only be said to be (and to be good, wise, one,\netc.) in a secondary and deficient sense\u2014and only insofar as\nthey \u201cshare\u201d or \u201cparticipate\u201d in these\nproperties as they are in God, of whom they are properly and primarily\npredicated, and with respect to whom they stand in a relation of\ncausal dependence (Ashworth & D\u2019Ettore 2021). However, even\n(or especially) with respect to being, Aquinas appears to\nhave thought that, despite the immense gulf between God and creatures,\n\u201cbeing\u201d could be properly attributed to both God and\ncreatures (Tobin 1986: 35). Even though God is Being whereas\ncreatures only \u201chave\u201d being, in some important sense\ncreatures still have their own \u201cproper being\u201d (Hackett\n& Weed 2013: 219).\n\nEckhart, too, seems to have a doctrine of analogy that makes\nparticipation central to understanding the relation between God and\ncreatures, but he goes beyond both mere attribution and structural\nproportionality to a more radical participational view than that\nespoused by his Dominican predecessor. Like Aquinas, he agrees that\n\u201cGod alone properly speaking exists and is called being, one,\ntrue, and good\u201d, and he further agrees that \u201ceverything\nthat is being, one, true, or good does not have this from itself but\nfrom God and from him alone\u201d (Prol. gen., n.4; LW\nI:132; PQP 79). However, whereas Thomas indicates that attributes like\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cgoodness\u201d can be predicated of\nboth God and creatures (albeit to radically different degrees or\nlevels of perfection), Eckhart restricts the proper attribution of\npredicates to only one of the analogates:\n\n\nThe things which are analogous to something have nothing in themselves\nby which they are in a positive way rooted to the form which is the\nbasis of the analogy. (In Eccli. n.53; LW II:282; quoted in\nTobin 1986: 45)\n\n\nPace Aquinas, then, on Eckhart\u2019s approach creatures do\nnot have their own \u201cproper\u201d, albeit derivative, being. Any\nbeing creatures might be said to have can only be\n\u201cborrowed\u201d (Hackett & Weed 2013). Or, as he puts\nit:\n\n\n[E]very created being radically and positively possesses existence,\nlife, a wisdom from and in God, not in themselves as a created being.\n(ibid.; TP 178)\n\n\nLikewise, the goodness of creatures is not an \u201cimperfect\u201d\nor \u201csecondary\u201d way of instantiating what God exhibits\nperfectly. It simply is God\u2019s goodness to which the\ncreature\u2019s goodness refers. Considered in and of themselves,\ncreatures and their properties are nothing\u2014mere \u201csigns\npointing to what is real\u201d (Tobin 1986: 64).\n\nIn this sense, the relation of analogy for Eckhart is not a matter of\ndegree or level of perfection, nor is there any form of proportional\nsymmetry in the relations between subject and predicate in God and\ncreatures. There is only one proper attribution of the predicates\n\u201cis\u201d, \u201cone\u201d, \u201cwise\u201d, and\n\u201cgood\u201d, namely to God, and their attribution to any other\nbeing merely refers one immediately back to the divine essence. So in\nGod the predicate \u201cis-good\u201d and goodness express a\nrelation of (essential) identity, whereas in creatures, \u201cis\ngood\u201d is merely related to God\u2019s goodness in the mode of a\nsign. Eckhart tries to explain this idea in his defense against the\nlist of 49 articles brought against him. There, he claims that\n\n\nthe good man and goodness are one. The good man insofar as he is good\nsignifies [God\u2019s] goodness alone, just as something white\nsignifies only the quality of whiteness.\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\nThese two things, being good and goodness, are univocally one in the\nFather, Son and Holy Spirit. They are analogically one in God and in\nus considered as good. (Resp. n.82; LW V:278; EE 73)\n\n\nStill, even if God and creatures differ with respect to the modes in\nwhich they signify the divine perfections, it nevertheless appears\nthat, for Eckhart, the meaning (in the sense of ratio\npropria) of terms like \u201cbeing\u201d,\n\u201cgoodness\u201d, \u201cunity\u201d, \u201cwisdom\u201d, is\nunivocal whether said of God or creatures, even if it is God alone who\nis properly the subject of such attributions. (On the significance of\nunivocity in Eckhart\u2019s doctrine of analogy, see Mojsisch 1983\n[2001].) This might lead one to question whether his doctrine really\nis one of analogy at all.\n\nWhatever the case, like many medieval thinkers, Eckhart\u2019s\nmetaphysics and semantics were deeply, perhaps inextricably,\nintertwined. This makes things doubly difficult for Eckhart as a\nphilosopher and theologian, since it might turn out on his view that\nthere is very little we can say about anything whatsoever. For\nexample, with respect to ourselves as creatures, if we care about the\ncultivation of virtues and the pursuit of the good life, we want to be\nable to talk about things like \u201cthis just woman\u201d or\n\u201cthat virtuous person\u201d. We also tend to naturally speak of\nourselves as though we really exist, have properties, do\nthings, think about stuff, gain knowledge, and so on. But if we really\n\u201care\u201d nothing more than mere signs pointing to the divine\nessence, it would seem that there is very little we can say about\nour-selves at all. With respect to God, on the other hand,\nthe problem is exactly reversed, especially for theologians like\nEckhart with strong apophatic leanings who think that the divine\nradically transcends the limits of human language. If terms like\n\u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cone\u201d are all\nonly \u201cproperly\u201d predicated of the divine essence, yet that\nessence is simultaneously thought to radically surpass all human\nunderstanding, let alone anything we might say about it, then it might\nseem the most appropriate approach to God is simply to remain\nsilent.\n\nThis is certainly an attitude Eckhart sometimes appears to endorse, as\nwhen he writes that \u201cthe very best and noblest attainment in\nthis life is to be silent and let God work and speak within\u201d\n(Pr. 101; DW IV/1:355; MW 33). Yet despite his insistent\ninjunctions to move past concrete \u201cimages\u201d and ultimately\nto give up the attempt to \u201ccapture\u201d God in language,\nsymbol, or story (see\n Section 9\n below), his hermeneutical approach as discussed above together with\nthe rich imagery he employs in his preaching (e.g., the images of the\nGodhead as pregnant mother, desert, abyss, wilderness, etc., as well\nas the descriptions of the uncreated \u201cground\u201d of the soul\nas a castle, a spark, a nobleman, etc.) imply that the Meister thought\nthat imagery and positive language about God (and creatures) had at\nleast some role to play in helping the individual make both epistemic\nand spiritual progress (Griffioen & Zahedi 2018).\n\nEckhart\u2019s use of the qualifier in quantum is again key\nhere. This \u201creduplication\u201d, as he calls it, is used to\n\u201cexclude from the term in question everything that is other or\nforeign to it even according to reason\u201d (Resp. n.81; LW\nV:277; EE 72). Take the example of a caterpillar. If we are\nconsidering it merely insofar as it is a locomotive animal,\nand we understand animal legs merely as \u201cweight-bearing\nanatomical structures used for locomotion\u201d, it might not be\ninappropriate to say that a caterpillar has 16 legs. However, the\ncaterpillar will someday turn into a butterfly, and butterflies are\ninsects. If we are therefore specifically considering the caterpillar\ninsofar as it is an insect, and given that insects per\ndefinitionem have 6 legs, it will be more appropriate to\nunderstand the caterpillar as having 6 legs and to characterize the\nother weight-bearing locomotive structures differently\u2014e.g., as\n\u201cprolegs\u201d. We can also consider it insofar as it is, e.g.,\na living thing, a creature, a being, or very hungry\u2014and what\ncounts as a fitting characterization of it may change according to the\nconceptual, metaphysical, and pragmatic restrictions imposed on it by\nthe qualifying class or context to which it is indexed. In this sense,\nthen, Eckhart thinks that it is not always inappropriate to speak of\ncreatures as possessing \u201cbeing\u201d or even as \u201cbeing\nwise\u201d or \u201cbeing good\u201d, so long as we always keep in\nmind that when we speak of the creature insofar as it has\nbeing, we are speaking about created being\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cborrowed\u201d being\u2014not \u201cabsolute\u201d or\n\u201cpure\u201d being. So even if created beings are technically\n\u201cnothing\u201d when compared to the divine esse,\ninsofar as they are considered under the aspect of their\ncreatureliness, they may appropriately be said to possess being,\ntruth, goodness, and unity, albeit in a radically qualified and\nrestricted sense that always necessarily points back to the\ndivine.\n\nImportantly, invoking the in quantum qualifier does not\nrequire sacrificing metaphysical or conceptual precision. In fact, the\nuse of in quantum indicates both a logical and a metaphysical\nconnection between two terms that can only be set in relation to each\nanother if the one is related to the other as a mode or sign\n(Beccarisi 2013: 122). If anything, such qualifications are supposed\nto better preserve precision by clarifying which aspects of the\nsubject are under discussion in which context. Eckhart is therefore\ncareful to consistently apply the driving principle behind his\ndoctrine of analogy\u2014namely, that what is said of one analogate\nmust be denied of the other. (This derives from a causal principle the\nMeister cites from the Book of Causes that \u201cnothing is\nformally in both a cause and its effect if the cause is a true\ncause\u201d: Par. Qu. 1 n.9; LW V:43; PQP 48.) When combined\nwith the in quantum-strategy, this allows Eckhart\u2019s use\nof analogy to be \u201creversible\u201d, especially as concerns\nesse and intelligere (McGinn 2001: 92). That is, if\nwe are speaking of God as an eternally creative and overflowing\nplenitude of being, then in predicating \u201cbeing\u201d of God we\nmust deny it of creatures and affirm their nothingness. On the other\nhand, if we are concerned with the existence of creatures (or with\nconstruing \u201cbeing\u201d as the first of created things, as per\nthe Book of Causes), then we must reject the attribution of\nbeing to God (Beccarisi 2013: 113). In the latter case,\nintelligere becomes a clearer and more appropriate way of\nspeaking about the divine than esse, given the special kind\nof non-being that constitutes intellect (insofar as it is pure\nintellect), as discussed above. Consequently, when we view\nourselves as genuinely existing beings, we are considering the human\nbeing in the mode of creaturely existence, and this appropriately\nretains the gulf between the divine-qua-creator and the human\nbeing-qua-created. However, when we view ourselves as\n\u201cnothing\u201d in comparison to the absolute being of the\ndivine, we locate in that nothingness the very mode in which human\nbeings are made ad imaginem Dei\u2014namely, insofar as they\npossess that very same mode of non-being, i.e., intellect. In\nthis way, Eckhart\u2019s \u201cmetaphysics of analogy\u201d (Libera\n1980) attempts to preserve intuitions concerning both God\u2019s\nutter transcendence and the real presence of God in creation.\n\nNevertheless, adherence to these two principles\u2014the in\nquantum-principle and the analogical principle\u2014might also\ntake Eckhart\u2019s semantics past traditional scholastic metaphysics\nand to usher his audience into a dialectical space in which, for\nexample, negation can itself be negated to come to an even deeper\nunderstanding of God\u2019s utter fullness and transcendence (which,\nparadoxically, is what Eckhart thinks is needed to allow the\nindividual to be capable of apprehending God\u2019s utter\nimmanence in the ground of the soul, as will be discussed\nbelow). For example, when Eckhart discusses unum with respect\nto God, he notes that\n\n\nthe term \u201cone\u201d is a negative word but is in reality\naffirmative. Moreover, it is the negation of negation which is the\npurest form of affirmation and the fullness of the term affirmed.\n(In Sap. n.147; LW II:485; TP 167)\n\n\nElsewhere, he clarifies:\n\n\nThe One itself is the negation of [the] negation [\u2026] which\nevery multitude that is opposed to the One includes. The negation of\nnegation is the core, the purity, and the repetition of the\naffirmation of existence. \u201cI am who am\u201d. (In Ioh.\nn.556; LW III:485; TP 185)\n\n\nAs Bernard McGinn puts it, the divine unity\n\n\n\u201cnegates\u201d everything that we know \u201cis\u201d; but\nthe negation of all that is [\u2026] opens up vistas into a new\nworld in which our distinctions between what is and what is not no\nlonger pertain. God as negatio negationis is simultaneously\ntotal emptiness and supreme fullness. (McGinn 2001: 93\u201394)\n\n\nStill, this understanding of unum as negatio\nnegationis is not mere wordplay; it represents an attempt on\nEckhart\u2019s part to explode the strict conceptual divide between\nwhat-is and what-is-not that permeates and constrains human thought\nand language.\n8. A Unified Onto-logos? The Divine Word as Principle and Mediator\n\nEckhart\u2019s reversible doctrine of analogy, when taken together\nwith the in quantum principle, allows him to characterize God\nin ways that alternately give Being, Intellect, and Unity conceptual\nprimacy among the transcendentals, and there is some controversy over\nwhich divine attribute, if any, he ultimately took to be most\nfundamental. Of course, Eckhart himself might have countered that such\na question posed simpliciter and without qualification is\njust another instance of trying to say what cannot be said. In any\ncase, it does not seem wrong to characterize Eckhart\u2019s\nmetaphysics as heavily intellectualist, even where he centers Being or\nUnity (or occasionally even Goodness). At the same time, it is an\nintellectualism centered not only on thinking or\ncognition but also crucially on speech and the\ncommunication of being\u2014in the case of God, through an\nsingular, eternal, self-communicating speech-act.\n\nIndeed, for Eckhart, \u201cbeing\u201d just is acting in\nthe sense of communicating something intelligible: \u201cTo exist is\nto communicate\u201d (Dobie 2010: 32). This is exemplified most\nperfectly in God, whose \u201cinner boiling\u201d is characterized\nby its wholly self-sufficient intellectual activity, in which the\nFather \u201cspeaks\u201d (and thereby generates) the Son, and the\nFather and the Son together \u201cbreathe\u201d out the Holy Spirit\nin their bond of divine love. As Eckhart formulates it in his analysis\nof John 1:1 (\u201cIn the beginning was the Word\u201d):\n\n\nUnder the name \u201cBeginning\u201d or \u201cPrinciple\u201d,\nunderstand the Father, under \u201cWord\u201d the Son, and because a\nword cannot exist without a breath, consequently also understand the\nHoly Spirit. (In Ioh. n.82; LW III:70; EE 152)\n\n\nHowever, as we have seen, the intellection of God is not wholly\nself-contained in the internal activity of bullitio. Rather,\nGod\u2019s self-communication is also outward-directed, and it is\nthis notion of \u201cebullitive\u201d divine speech that allows\nEckhart to better express how it is that God\u2019s intellection is\nessentially causative: In speaking the Word in love, God \u201cboils\nover\u201d into creation and thereby also \u201cspeaks\u201d the\nworld into existence. There is therefore a very real sense in which we\nmight characterize Eckhart\u2019s views on God and creation (whether\nin the context of viewing God as esse or\nintelligere) as a verbal ontology (Duclow 1984).\n\nEckhart\u2019s ontology is verbal not only in the sense that\nGod the Father speaks but also regarding what is spoken (even\nif in a strict sense the activity of God\u2019s speaking and the\ncontent of God\u2019s speech is identical). In fact, it is the\n\u201cWord\u201d or logos spoken by the Father that lies at\nthe center of Eckhart\u2019s philosophical theology and unites the\napproach to God-as-intellect in the Parisian Questions with\nthat of being-as-God in the prologue to the Opus tripartitum.\nEckhart use of the term principle is key here. As was not\nuncommon for his time, Eckhart interpreted the phrase \u201cIn\nprincipio\u201d that opens both the book of Genesis and the\ngospel of John as referring not only to the temporal beginning of the\nuniverse but also to the \u201cprinciple\u201d that designates the\norigin of and ratio underlying all creation. Thus, when\nconsidering God under the aspect of plenitudinous being, Eckhart tends\nto use principium to designate the internal principle of the\nTrinitarian Godhead. This principle is equated with the Neoplatonic\n\u201cOne\u201d (understood either as the conceptually\npre-Trinitarian Godhead itself or as God the Father), who is the\nfontal source or \u201cgenerator\u201d of the Son and Spirit in the\ninternal activity of bullitio\u2014which, as we have seen\nabove, culminates in the expressive ebullitio of divine\nplenitude into creation (McGinn 2001: 75).\n\nOf course, the Godhead\u2019s \u201coverflowing\u201d of being into\ncreation puts God in the role of efficient cause, whereas Eckhart\nfocuses his energies predominantly on the divine viewed as the\nessential or formal cause of creation (such causes\nbeing the proper domain of metaphysics, according to the Meister).\nHere, it is the act of divine intellection in the form of the\nverbum in principio\u2014i.e., the second person of the\nTrinity, the Son\u2014that stands at the center of the\nMeister\u2019s account of the relation between God and creation. In\nhis receptive role as the person of the Trinity most immediately\ngenerated by the One, the Son can appropriately be called \u201cthe\nprinciple from the principle\u201d, as he \u201creceive[s]\nthe power to flow\u201d solely from the Father, who is \u201cthe\nprinciple without principle\u201d (In Ioh. n. 656; LW\nIII:570; quoted in McGinn 2001: 75). At the same time, in his role as\nthe content of divine speech\u2014that which is spoken by (but is\nalso one with) the Father\u2014the Son contains the ratio of\nall intelligible forms and can thus be characterized as \u201cthe\nWord in the principle\u201d (In Ioh. n.12; LW\nIII:12; EE 126). In this respect, the Son, as emanated by the One, is\nboth the representation or \u201cimage\u201d of the Father and\nhimself \u201cthe blueprint of all creatures\u201d (Pr.\n117; DW IV/2:1123; SW 245), who in turn are the images and signs\npointing back to the divine. The Son qua Word, Idea, or\nlogos is thus simultaneously the receptive\n\u201cconduit\u201d of ebullitio and the active,\nintellectual formal cause of (and ultimate exemplar for) all creation.\nAny genuine reality that particular creatures might have from the\nDivine is mere \u201cformal being\u201d (esse formale), but\nthe Word contains their being \u201cvirtually\u201d (esse\nvirtuale), a mode of being which Eckhart considers to be\n\u201cprior and more eminent\u201d (In Ioh. n.38; LW\nIII:32\u20133; EE 135), insofar as the latter is eternal and\nunchanging, whereas the former is transient and mutable. Thus, even if\nthere was no time \u201cbefore\u201d creation, when we consider the\nuniverse under the aspect of being still-uncreated, \u201ceverything\nin the universe was not mere nothing, but was in possession of virtual\nexistence\u201d in the Word (In Ioh. n.45; LW III:37; EE\n137). Importantly, this \u201cvirtual existence\u201d that things\nhave in their \u201cprinciple\u201d or \u201cIdea\u201d is the\n\u201creally real\u201d mode of existing (McGinn 1981: 40).\nEverything else is just an image.\n\nEckhart\u2019s verbal \u201conto-logos\u201d not only\nreconciles the idea of God as absolute (plenitudinous) being and pure\n(intellectual) nothingness, it also shows how his views on analogy and\nunivocity are related. On the one hand, insofar as the Word is the\nconduit or medium of divine speech, it can be\nunderstood as the pure intellect\u2014the \u201cno-thing\u201d that\nis \u201cbeyond being\u201d\u2014through which the principial\nGodhead flows, thereby lending or communicating being to creatures as\nan essential (and final) cause. In this respect, the divine activity\nof ebullitio, in which all things are created\nthrough the Word, establishes an analogical\nrelationship between God and creatures, since there are clear\nrelationships of causal dependence and superiority in play. But\ninsofar as the Word is the content of divine speech\u2014the\nexpression of God thinking Godself and containing all things as one in\nthe divine mind\u2014it grounds the essences of creatures\nand thus represents a univocal cause of the perfections in\nthings, as well as the very ground of the human soul (McGinn 2001: 77;\nMojsisch 1983 [2001: 33]).\n9. Birthing the Word and Being in the World: Eckhart\u2019s Mystagogical Ethics\n\nAs noted above, for Eckhart there is ultimately no clear-cut\ndistinction between theoria and ethica, nor between\nhis metaphysics and his mystagogy. As with many mendicant orders of\nthe period, the goals of the Meister\u2019s academic work and his\nmission as a preacher and provincial were \u201cinextricably united\nin their understanding of the apostolic goal\u201d (Hollywood 1995\n[2001: 120]). And while much of the more \u201cpractical\u201d and\n\u201cmystical\u201d aspects of Eckhart\u2019s thought come out in\nhis vernacular works, the Meister\u2019s Dominican emphasis on\nintellect over will and the key role of the verbum that we\nfind in his more systematic works remain ever-present themes\nthroughout the Eckhartian corpus. In fact, for Eckhart the intellect\nis the aspect of the human being that most directly reflects the image\nof the Godhead. It is also importantly the space where the Eternal\nWord can be \u201cborn\u201d within us, a concept central to\nEckhart\u2019s mystagogical and moral approach.\n\nHowever, when speaking of the intellect insofar as it images God or\n\u201cbirths\u201d the Word in the soul, Eckhart is not referring to\nthe traditional notion of intellect understood as one of the three\nmain \u201cpowers\u201d of the soul (i.e., memory, intellect, and\nwill). As with his treatment of the divine nature of which it is an\nimage, he means the intellect insofar as it is\nintellect\u2014which, as we saw above, he takes to be pure\nnegativity or \u201cno-thing-ness\u201d. This is not the human\nintellect insofar as it apprehends or \u201ctakes in\u201d the\nenvironment around it via the senses, nor even insofar as it reasons\nabstractly or performs certain cognitive operations to extract\nintelligibles from its sensory input. Rather, it is nothing but\npure potentiality\u2014a wholly receptive intellectus\npossibilis (Largier 2002: 849). To put it in more Eckhartian\nterms, it is the soul taken in its bare (\u201cnaked\u201d)\nintellective essence or ground (MHG:\ngrunt)\u2014which Eckhart characterizes as an uncreated,\neternal aspect of the soul, one related univocally, not analogically,\nto its Creator (Connolly 2014: 162; Kern 2013: 246). Insofar as it\nimages the Godhead in being wholly one and simple (ein und\neinvaltic)\u2014\u201cneither this nor that\u201d (diz\nnoch daz), but a \u201csomething\u201d (waz) higher\nthan any particular thing or created power\u2014it transcends memory,\nreason, will, and even contingent being itself (Largier 2002:\n764\u201365). It even lies beyond the purview of God understood as\nFather, Son, or Holy Spirit. Only the Godhead itself, insofar as it is\n\u201cone and indivisible [einvaltic ein], without mode\n[w\u00eese] or properties [eigenschaft]\u201d, can\nenter into the soul\u2019s ground (Pr. 2; DW I:[43\u201344]; MW\n81). As bare intellect, absent any contingent or created object that\ncould serve to distract it, the soul is able to take on\u2014and\nbecome one with\u2014its proper object, i.e., the eternal\nlogos as communicated in an outpouring of self-giving love by\nthe Father. Thus, the eternal unfolding of the Trinity is, according\nto Eckhart, one that also takes place in the ground of the soul.\n\nThus, the Eckhartian parallel to the Neoplatonic\nreditus\u2014the final end and fulfillment of the human\nbeing\u2014is the \u201creturn\u201d to and unification with the\neinvaltic ein in the ground of the soul. Yet just as the\n\u201coverboiling\u201d of the Godhead into creation proceeds by way\nof the eternally true logos, the return to God can only take\nplace through the Word in the ground of the soul. In the soul\u2019s\nground, Eckhart claims, the human being as an intellective imago\ndei is like a b\u00eewort or\nadverbium\u2014i.e., a \u201csecondary word\u201d that\naccompanies a princip(i)al Word to form a single unit of meaning. Thus\nhe claims, \u201cwhere the [eternal] Word remains\nwithin\u201d\u2014in its intellectual ground\u2014\u201cthere the\nsoul should be an ad-verb and work one work with God in order to\nreceive its happiness in the same inwardly hovering knowledge where\nGod is happy\u201d (Pr. 9; DW I:158; TP 260). In this sense,\nthe ultimate \u201chappiness\u201d of the human being is not\ndistinct from God\u2019s happiness. United in the ground via the\nWord, the soul\u2019s activity is nothing other than God\u2019s\nactivity, and what it is for the human being to flourish just is to\nparticipate in divine happiness.\n9.1 Images for De-Imaging: Birthing the Word Without a Why\n\nEckhart uses various metaphors in his vernacular discussions of the\nsoul\u2019s ground. In some places, he speaks of a\n\u201ctemple\u201d or a \u201clittle castle\u201d\n(b\u00fcrgelin)\u2014a place in which God can\n\u201creside\u201d. In others, it is a \u201csprout\u201d or\n\u201clittle spark\u201d (v\u00fcnkelin)\u2014the\nintellective power or potential to, like God, \u201cwork in\nnonbeing\u201d. As the highest (or \u201crichest\u201d) aspect of\nour humanity, it is sometimes referred to as a \u201cnobleman\u201d.\nYet, as with his account of God\u2019s creation of the universe, the\ndriving metaphor behind much of Eckhart\u2019s language about the\nground of the soul is that of pregnancy and birth.\nAlthough his language is in keeping with a longstanding Christian\ntradition of allegorically representing the human soul as a female\n(the MHG word s\u00eale and the Latin anima are\nboth feminine nouns), and despite taking on familiar tropes from\nRhenish-Flemish bridal mysticism as well as the common scholastic\nunderstanding of women\u2019s bodies as mere \u201cpassive\nreceptacles\u201d\u2014Eckhart is perhaps at his most creative (or\nat least his most emphatic) when discussing what he calls the\n\u201cbirth of the Word\u201d in the human soul. (For an extended\ndiscussion of the ways in which Eckhart\u2019s views both perpetuate\nand subvert medieval gender stereotypes and norms see Hollywood 1995\n[2001], especially Chapters 5 and 6. For Eckhart\u2019s own extended\nreflections on the birth of the Word in the soul, see the famous\n\u201cbirth cycle\u201d\u2014Pr. 101\u2013104\u2014which\nthe Meister likely composed for the Advent/Christmas season; DW\nI/1V:279\u2013610; MW 29\u201361.)\n\nOne of Eckhart\u2019s most interesting allegorical uses of these\nmetaphors involves his innovative reading of Luke 10:38 (which Eckhart\ntranslates as \u201cOur Lord Jesus Christ went up into a citadel and\nwas received by a virgin who was a wife\u201d) and his discussion of\nthe ways in which the soul itself should be like a \u201cvirgin\nwife\u201d. Roughly speaking, Eckhart\u2019s claim is that the soul\nmust be \u201cstripped\u201d of all the external objects of\nconsciousness that serve to distract it and \u201cemptied\u201d of\nall its finite attachments. When it is pure, naked, and unsullied by\nworldly things\u2014\u201cvoid of alien images\u201d (von allen\nvremden bilden ledic) as Eckhart puts it\u2014the soul becomes\ntruly \u201cfree\u201d and unobstructed (\u201coffering no\nhindrance to the highest Truth\u201d), and therefore \u201ca maiden,\na virgin\u201d who can receive the \u201cempty and free and\nvirginal\u201d Jesus, i.e., the Truth that is the Word. When the\nintellect is thusly \u201cfreed\u201d and\n\u201cbare\u201d\u2014when it is turned inward toward itself and\nbrought back down to its objectless grunt (which is also\nunivocally God\u2019s ground)\u2014it is thereby transformed into\nthe passive vehicle of the Eternal Word. In fact, Eckhart goes so far\nas to claim that, once it has become purged of external images and\ncreaturely things, God cannot refrain from thusly\n\u201cimpregnating\u201d the receptive soul:\n\n\nWhen God finds you ready, He has to act, to overflow into you, just as\nwhen the air is clear and pure the sun has to burst forth and cannot\nrefrain, (Pr. 103; DW IV/1:484; MW 58)\n\n\nand elsewhere, \u201che is forced to do it; he must do it of\nnecessity\u201d (Pr. 14; DW I:234; TP 272).\n\nThe claim that God is forced to do anything with respect to the human\nbeing, let alone enter into their soul, may appear quite radical at\nfirst glance, but when we recall that the ground of the soul is the\nunivocal point of connection to the divine, and that this connection\nis, for Eckhart, fundamentally intellectual, we may think of\nthe Meister\u2019s necessity claim less as making a causal assertion\n(e.g., \u201cthe emptied soul causes God to enter the\nsoul\u201d) and more as expressing a fundamental truth to be\ndiscovered by the subject. Indeed, the problem of human beings as\ncreatures occupied with finite things is first and foremost an\nepistemic one: We neither understand what we, at our core,\nreally are\u2014namely, the images and\n\u201coffspring\u201d of God\u2014nor how to \u201cwant\u201d\nproperly (Connolly 2014: 141). We need to be \u201cstill\u201d, to\nempty ourselves of worldly distractions and illusory attachments, to\nbe able to \u201chear\u201d and come to understand the Word that is\neternally communicated by the Father in the ground. In this sense, it\nis not as though God is absent in us and then becomes present due to\nsome action of ours that we undertake of our own initiative. Rather,\nfor Eckhart, our task as human beings is to come to be able to\nlisten to\u2014and thereby apprehend\u2014the Word\nthat is eternally and always poured out into in us. (It is also\nnoteworthy that Eckhart shifts the traditional Christian emphasis on\nthe beatific vision in which one sees God face to face to the\nmodality of spiritually hearing the self-communication of the\ndivine.) Further, just as a pregnant person is, in a very real sense,\none with that which they have conceived, the\n\u201cpregnant\u201d soul and God are united in the\nground\u2014thereby again preserving the identity of the intellect\nand the intelligible.\n\nIn this sense, then, only the soul \u201cstripped bare\u201d of its\nobjects and attachments\u2014a soul that has been wholly\n\u201cde-imaged\u201d (entbildet) can truly\nconceive the divine already within it. However, this\n\u201cbirth\u201d is not, according to Eckhart, something we can\nsimply will to bring about\u2014at least not in the ordinary\nsense of prudential means-ends reasoning. First, Eckhart is emphatic\nthat God should not be sought for the sake of any reward or external\nstate such as heaven, eternal bliss, or even the rapturous experience\nof God itself. In other words, the return of the soul to God is not a\nmere means to some further desirable or pleasurable end. It is\nidentical with our ultimate end, our telos, and should be\nsought for its own sake. Neither is it an end that can be reached by\nadopting particular methods or techniques. According to Eckhart, God\nshould not\u2014indeed, cannot\u2014be sought in such \u201cspecial\nways\u201d as devotion, prayer, meditation, good works, or even\ndivinely inspired religious ecstasy: \u201cWhoever seeks God in a\nspecial way gets the way and misses God, who lies hidden in it\u201d\n(Pr. 5b; DW I:91; MW 110). Rather, Eckhart says, the soul in\nits ground must always act as God acts, i.e., \u201cwithout [a]\nwhy\u201d (\u0203ne warumbe). When we give ourselves wholly\nover to God, and the Word is born in the ground of our souls, God will\nsimply act through us, such that our actions are God\u2019s\nactions and therefore performed simply for their own sake without some\nfurther \u201cwhy\u201d or \u201cwherefore\u201d.\n9.2 Learning to Let Go: Negative Virtue and Non-Attachment\n\nThe idea that God cannot be found in ways puts those who wish to\nfollow Eckhart\u2019s spiritual advice in a tricky position. On the\none hand, the Meister claims that God cannot be sought in means and\nthat we should give up our attempts to find God via spiritual,\nmystical, or moral techniques. On the other hand, he often seems to\nimply that we can and even should do something to put\nourselves in a position that would allow the intellectual conception\nof the Word to be \u201ctriggered\u201d in us:\n\n\nAll God wants of you is for you to go out of yourself in the way of\ncreatureliness and let God be within you,\n\n\nhe exclaims.\n\n\nMy dear friend, what harm can it do you to do God the favor of letting\nHim be God in you? Go right out of yourself for God\u2019s sake, and\nGod will go right out of Himself for your sake. (Pr. 5b; DW\nI:91; MW 110)\n\n\nEckhart also extols the active pursuit and cultivation of certain\nhabitual ways of being that he takes to be most valuable in freeing\nthe self from its worldly attachments and keeping our\n\u201ccreaturely impulses\u201d in check (Connolly 2014: 185),\nthereby opening up the very possibility of becoming receptacles for\nthe divine. Whereas the more traditional Aristotelian and Christian\nvirtues tended to revolve around moral and spiritual\nformation, Eckhart\u2019s focus on cultivating attitudes of\n\u201cdetachment\u201d (abgescheidenheit) and\n\u201creleasement\u201d or \u201cletting-go-ness\u201d\n(gel\u0203zenheit) created a set of more Stoic-sounding\nnegative virtues (Griffioen & Zahedi 2018) that could\nassist the individual in the pursuit of the un-formation\n(another sense of entbildung) of their sinful souls (see,\ne.g., BgT; DW V:12; MW 527; see also Wackernagel 1993).\nInsofar as the cultivation of such virtues can lead a soul from\ndivision to unity, from distraction by attachment to the world to a\nfocus on knowledge of one\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d self (and\ntherefore of God), the soul can be \u201cpurified in the exercise of\nvirtues\u201d, creating the conditions for the ascent \u201cinto the\nlife of unity\u201d and the realization of oneness with the Word in\nthe ground of the soul (Pr. 9; DW I:136; MW 405).\n\nUnderstanding Eckhart on these points is not easy, and scholars have\nstruggled with this mystagogical aspect of his thought. However, the\nMeister was not the first to grapple with the tension between activity\nand passivity, between human action and divine grace, that inevitably\nappears when classical philosophy comes into contact with Christian\ntheology. To some extent, much of his philosophical thought might even\nbe characterized as an attempt to provide a metaphysics that can make\nsense of these aspects of Christian doctrine. Whatever the case, the\ncommon thread in Eckhart\u2019s mystagogical and moral\nthought seems to be that attachment to anything distinct from God\nhinders the soul from true freedom and keeps God and the soul apart\nfrom one another (Milne 2016: 97). This includes those seeking God via\nsuch methods as \u201cprayer, fasting, vigils, and all kinds of\noutward discipline and mortification\u201d, since any \u201cwork to\nwhich you are possessively attached\u201d is something that\n\n\ninvolves the loss of freedom to wait on God in the here and now, and\nto follow Him alone in the light wherein He would show you what to do\nand what not to do, every moment freely and anew, as if you had\nnothing else and neither would nor could do otherwise. (Pr.\n2; DW I:28\u201329; MW 78)\n\n\nIndeed, it is perhaps the notion of possessiveness that\ncharacterizes the fundamental problem of the human being. True freedom\ninvolves a kind of self-dispossession, and a letting go of the\nattachment to the \u201cmine-ness\u201d of one\u2019s actions. This\nfor Eckhart is the kind of spiritual \u201cpoverty\u201d that\nresults in genuine freedom. Here, the Meister mirrors many of his\nBeguine predecessors (and not a few of his Muslim Sufi counterparts)\nin characterizing human freedom, not in the modern sense of\nfreedom from external constraint, or even the ability to do otherwise,\nbut rather as acting in consonance with that which is wholly unified\nand thereby wholly unencumbered by the hindrances of multiplicity,\ndivision, and internal conflict\u2014namely, with the divine will\n(Griffioen & Zahedi 2018). In fact, Eckhart\u2019s emphasis on\ndispossession takes him even further. It is not merely sufficient that\nour will be in conformance with God\u2019s will, but rather\nour actions should be a result of God\u2019s acting through\nus: \u201cIf our will is God\u2019s will, that is good, but if\nGod\u2019s will is our will, that is far better\u201d (Pr.\n25; DW II:9; MW 92).\n9.3 \u201cFruitful Virginity\u201d: Being in the World and the Christian Life\n\nImportantly, however, although becoming appropriately\nabgescheiden, gel\u0203zen, and entbildet\ncan be the ladder one climbs up to eventually throw away for a life of\nunity in, with, and through participation in the \u201cwayless\nway\u201d of the divine life of the Trinity\u2014this\n\u201cvirginal\u201d conception of the Word in the soul liberated\nfrom attachment to the world is not the end of the story. So\nlong as we remain embodied created beings, we are always beings\nin the world (even if we are no longer of it). The\n\u201cletting-go\u201d involved in true spiritual poverty is itself\na negatio negationis\u2014a turning of nothingness\n\u201cfrom a simple negation of creation into a way of being in the\nworld\u201d (Howells 2010: 38). Put in the terms of Sermon 2, the\n\u201cvirginal\u201d soul must also \u201cbear fruit\u201d and be\na \u201cwife\u201d. It is not enough to be merely\n\u201cpregnant\u201d with the divine logos, the soul must\nalso continually \u201cbirth\u201d the Word in itself, such that God\ncan work through the soul and thereby bring it to a \u201cdeeper mode\nof participation in the truth and goodness of all things\u201d (Milne\n2016: 107). For this reason, even if Eckhart\u2019s selective focus\non negative virtues like releasement and detachment, together with his\nrepeated warnings that God cannot be sought in ways or by technical\nmeans, might make one question whether Eckhart\u2019s thought can\nreally be considered to contain any sort of normative ethical\nforce, there is nevertheless a role for the traditional virtues and\nvirtuous moral action to play in his conception of the good life.\n\nFirst, Eckhart seems to think that it is better for us to be created\nas we are than to have always rested in God and perfect self-awareness\n(Milne 2016: 101). Like the \u201cnobleman\u201d in the parable of\nthe ten pounds (Luke 19:12), who \u201cwent to a distant region to\nreceive royal power for himself\u201d and (on Eckhart\u2019s\nreading) returned home wealthier, our lives, too, are richer for\nhaving \u201cflowed out of God\u2019s will\u201d into creaturely\nbodies endowed with reason and having experienced the moral and\nepistemic struggle involved in our return to the Creator (Pr.\n15; DW I:245; MW 270). Even the inclination to sin, Eckhart thinks, is\nitself beneficial for human beings, insofar as the \u201cperfection\nof virtue comes by struggle\u201d, and the struggle against our\nsinful inclinations \u201cmakes [us] ever more zealous to practice\nvirtue strongly\u201d (RdU n.9; DW V:213; MW 494).\n\nSecond, as part of this return, the cultivation of the traditional\nmoral and theological virtues can be a useful\u2014perhaps even\nnecessary\u2014preparation for the life of detachment and spiritual\npoverty. Indeed, Eckhart cautions that his words regarding leaving\nimages and goal-oriented actions behind are\n\n\nonly for the [already] good and perfected people, who have so absorbed\nand assimilated the essence of all virtues that these virtues emanate\nfrom them naturally, without their seeking. (Pr. 101; DW\nIV/1:354; MW 33)\n\n\nThird, and most importantly, the soul united with God in pure\ndetachment\u2014although in some sense having transcended the\nvirtues\u2014nevertheless continues to act virtuously in the world,\nthough she does not act for the sake of anything else, even of virtue\nitself (Connolly 2014: 190ff.). Rather, her will and God\u2019s will\nare a singular will, such that she acts wholly freely\nin virtue, but unbound by the constraints that even morality\nwould place on her. As Eckhart exhorts his audience, \u201cYou should\ntraverse [durchg\u00e2n] and transcend all the virtues,\ndrawing virtue solely from its source in that ground where it is one\nwith the divine nature\u201d (Pr. 16b; DW I:276; MW 117; cf.\nalso TP 278). When this happens, Eckhart thinks, \u201call virtues\nshould be enclosed in you and flow out of you in their true being\n[wesenl\u00eeche von dir vliezen]\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nIt is with this in mind that Eckhart turns the Mary and Martha story\non its head in Sermon 86 (Pr. 86; DW III:481\u2013503; MW\n83\u201390), claiming that it is not Mary, sitting enraptured at the\nfeet of Christ, who represents the moral and spiritual exemplar.\nRather, this role is played by Martha, who busily tends to the guests\nand the housework, being \u201cso well grounded in her essence that\nher activity was no hindrance to her\u201d. Although Mary has\ncorrectly grasped what is most valuable and worthy of\nworship\u2014and therefore begun her journey of spiritual\nprogress\u2014according to Eckhart, we might suspect that she\nnevertheless \u201csat there a little more for her own happiness than\nfor spiritual profit\u201d. Martha, on the other hand, is\n\u201cunhindered\u201d insofar as all her works are \u201cguided by\nthe eternal light\u201d. In contrast to her contemplative sister, who\nis just beginning her \u201cschooling\u201d in \u201clearning how\nto live\u201d, the experienced and busy Martha has already progressed\nto being \u201cwith things and not in them\u201d. Eckhart concludes\nthe sermon by noting that \u201csome people hope to reach a point [of\nspiritual progress] where they are free of works\u201d, but that\n\u201cthis cannot be\u201d (Pr. 86; DW III:492; MW 89). In\nthis sense, then, there is ultimately no distinction for Eckhart\nbetween the vita activa and the vita\ncontemplativa:\n\n\nIt is actually the same thing, for we take only from the same ground\nof contemplation and make it fruitful in works, and thus the object of\ncontemplation is achieved. (Pr. 104; DW IV/1:580; MW 48)\n\n\nIndeed, as has been shown repeatedly throughout this entry,\nEckhart\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the Word\u201d attempts to bring\nthese two strands together with the help of an intellectualist\nmetaphysics that places divine thought and speech\u2014the eternal\nlogos and ewig wort\u2014at its (silent and still)\ncore.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nN.B.
