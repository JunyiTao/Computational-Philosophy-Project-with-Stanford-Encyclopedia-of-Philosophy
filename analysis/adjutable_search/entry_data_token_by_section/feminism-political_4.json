    "main_text": "Contemporary Approaches and Debates || Socialist, Marxist, and Materialist Feminisms\n2.3 Socialist, Marxist, and Materialist Feminisms\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, many political theorists in Europe,\nthe United States, and Latin America drew on socialist and Marxist\ntexts to develop theories of social change attentive to issues of\nclass relations and exploitation in modern capitalist economies. By\nand large, Marxist feminists focus on how modes of production, along\nwith changing relations of production and reproduction shape the\nsocial arrangements (e.g., the gender division of labor, gender\nhierarchy) and institutions (e.g., marriage, motherhood, the family)\nthat contribute to women\u2019s oppression. After learning of the\nhorrors of Stalinism, most Western Marxists and socialists, feminists\nincluded, were extremely critical of the communist systems in the\nSoviet Union and later in China. Western, mostly anti-communist,\nMarxist thought flourished in Italy (with Antonio Gramsci\u2019s\nwork), England (with Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams\u2019 work),\nFrance (with the Socialisme ou Barbarie group), and the\nUnited States (less so there after McCarthyism, yet renewed somewhat\nin the 1960s with the New Left). Jaggar\u2019s 1983 book summed up\nwell the way feminists were using socialist and Marxist ideas to\nunderstand the way women were exploited and their laboring and\nreproductive work devalued and unpaid though necessary for capitalism\nto function. Drawing on Frederick Engels\u2019 emphasis on the\n\u201creproduction of immediate life\u201d, Marxist and socialist\nfeminists were able to move beyond more orthodox readings of Marx that\nrestrict focus to modes of \u201cproduction\u201d that privilege the\nexperience of men as wage-laborers (Engels 1884: Preface). Social\nreproduction theorists instead analyze forms of labor, most often\nwomen\u2019s unpaid labor, that contribute to the maintenance of life\nat the individual, family, and species level (see Bhattacharya [ed.]\n2017; Federici 2004 and 2021; S. Ferguson 2019). In the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work,\n the authors point to much of the work that was going on in this field\nup through the mid-1990s. Since then, the authors note, various\npostmodern, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and deconstructive\ntheories have criticized the bases for socialist and Marxist thought,\nincluding the \u201cgrand narrative\u201d of economic determinism\nand the reduction of everything to economic and material relations.\nDespite this, Marxist analyses remain important to a variety of work\nbeing done in contemporary feminist political philosophy (see Dean\n2009; Delphy 1984; Federici 2004; Fraser 2009, 2022; Gago 2019 [2020];\nSpivak 1987; Vogel 1983).\n\nWhile the lineage and trajectory of materialist feminism (as distinct\nfrom Marxist or socialist feminism) is unclear (see Gimenez 2000),\nMarxist, Socialist, and materialist feminisms all share an attention\nto the concrete material conditions underlying existing social\narrangements (e.g., of gender hierarchy), the historically specific\nnature of these conditions, and a commitment to feminism as an\nemancipatory movement, not merely a scholarly endeavor. Meanwhile,\nfeminists associated with these schools of thought tend to diverge\nwhen it comes to which topics of analysis are taken up, which aspects\nof Marx\u2019s theory are considered pertinent for explaining\nwomen\u2019s oppression, and the relationship between feminism and\n(anti)capitalism (Gimenez 2000). While the categories of socialist and\nMarxist feminisms are less relevant today, materialist feminism is\nexperiencing something of a renaissance. While\n\u201cmaterialist\u201d can mean many things, as in the broader\nfocus on matter and the body animating the work of \u201cNew\nMaterialism\u201d (e.g., see Coole & Frost [ed.] 2010), for the\npurposes of this entry, \u201cmaterialist feminism\u201d has a\ndeeper and more explicit connection to the Marxist usage of the term\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d as described by Engels (and referenced\nabove):\n\n\nAccording to the materialist conception, the decisive element of\nhistory is pre-eminently the production and reproduction of life and\nits material requirements. This implies, on the one hand, the\nproduction of the means of existence (food, clothing, shelter and the\nnecessary tools); on the other hand, the generation of children, the\npropogation of the species. (Engels 1884 [trans. Untermann 1902],\nPreface).\n\n\nIn Martha Gimenez\u2019s view, the fact that materialist feminism has\nsomewhat displaced Marxist and socialist feminisms may have more to do\nwith the \u201cideological balance of power\u201d in politics,\nacademia, and publishing than the strength of feminist critiques of\nMarxism for its alleged economism and class reductionism (Gimenez\n2000: 25).\n\nSince the 1990s, the feminist concern with culture, identity, and\ndifference\u2014issues that were previously marginalized within\nmainstream white Anglo-American and French feminist theory and\nactivism\u2014increased, somewhat displacing Marxist and socialist\nfeminism\u2019s focus on systemic social forces and concrete material\nconditions. Certainly, new generations of materialist feminists and\ncritical theorists tend to be more friendly to postmodern theories of\nmeaning, identity, and subjectivity important in the field (see, for\nexample, Fraser 2009; Fraser & Jaeggi 2018; Amy Allen 2008; McAfee\n2008; and Young 2000) and classic works by philosophers like Angela\nDavis (Women, Race, and Class, 1981) demonstrate that\nconcerns about identity, culture, and difference are not incompatible\nwith Marxist feminist analysis.\n",
