    "main_text": "Eighteenth-Century Philosophical Discussions about Molyneux\u2019s Problem\n2. Eighteenth-Century Philosophical Discussions about Molyneux\u2019s Problem\n\nIn the first instance, philosophers considered it to be impossible\nthat a man born blind should be able to acquire sight. They regarded\nMolyneux\u2019s problem as a kind of thought-experiment, which was to\nbe dealt with by ratiocination alone. The arguments put forward were\nusually concerned with the relation between visual and tactual\nsensations or between visual and tactual notions of the form of\nobjects.\n\nAll these philosophers assumed that the visual and tactual sensations\nof an object differ from each other, but there was no agreement\nconcerning the relation between the two. Some, Berkeley for instance,\nbelieved that this relation is arbitrary and based only on experience.\nOthers, such as Lee and Synge, thought that it is necessary and\nperceived directly, while yet others, such as Molyneux and Locke,\nthought that it is necessary and learned by experience. Opinions were\nalso divided concerning the relation between visual and tactual\nnotions of objects. Some philosophers defended the position that the\nvisual and tactual notions of a globe differ from one another, and can\nonly be related by either experience or reason (the latter view was\ndefended by Reid). Others believed that the visual and the tactual\nnotion of a globe are actually the same, or have something in common\nwhich is either observed directly (Boullier and Hutcheson) or inferred\nby reason (Leibniz).\n\nInvestigating how the different positions correlate with the answers\ngiven to Molyneux\u2019s question, one can conclude as follows.\nEmpiricists such as Molyneux, Locke and Berkeley answered in the\nnegative. More rationalist philosophers such as Synge, Lee and Leibniz\ngave an affirmative answer. There was no unanimous solution, amongst\nothers because Molyneux\u2019s problem was interpreted in different\nways. Some philosophers thought that the man born blind had to answer\ndirectly, while others were of the opinion that he should be able to\nmake use of his memory and reason, and that he should be at liberty to\nview all sides of the objects by walking around them. Some\nphilosophers believed that the question implied that the man should be\ntold in advance that he would be presented with a globe and cube,\nwhereas others thought that he should not be provided with this\ninformation.\n",
