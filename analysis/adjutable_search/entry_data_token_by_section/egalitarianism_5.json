    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Income and Wealth\n3.3 Income and Wealth\n\n\nIn modern societies with market economies, an egalitarian is\ngenerally thought to be one who supports equality of income and wealth\n(income being a flow, wealth a stock). Respecting this usage, this\nentry considers an egalitarian in the broad sense to be someone who\nprefers in actual or at least non-exotic circumstances that people\nshould be more nearly equal in income and wealth and favors policies\nthat aim to bring about such equality.\n\n\nMoney is a conventional medium of exchange. Given an array of goods\nfor sale at various prices, with some money one has the option to\npurchase any combination of these goods, within the budget constraint\nset by the amount of money one has. What money can purchase in a given\nsociety depends on the state of its economy and also on legal and\ncultural norms that may limit in various ways what is allowed to be put\nup for sale. For example, the laws may forbid the sale of sexual\nactivity, human organs intended for transplant, the right to become a\nparent of a particular child by adoption, narcotic drugs, and so on.\nWhat money can purchase also obviously depends on what one is free to\ndo with whatever one purchases\u2014one may catch fish with the\nfishing rod one purchases only with a license and in accordance with\nrules issued by the state agency that regulates fishing.\n\n\nLeaving these complications in the background, one can appreciate\nthat having money gives one effective freedom to engage in a wide\nvariety of activities and experiences. One has the option to purchase\nany of many commodities and do with them whatever is legally and\nconventionally allowed, up to the limit of one's budget. The ideal of\nequality of income and wealth is roughly the ideal that people should\nenjoy this effective freedom to the same extent.\n\n\nThis ideal is attractive to some and repulsive to others. One\nserious objection is that to bring about and sustain the condition in\nwhich all people have the same amount of money would require continuous\nand extensive violation of people's Lockean rights, which as standardly\nunderstood include the right to gain more property than others possess\nby gift or trade or hard work. Another, closely related objection is\nthat a regime of equal money could be maintained only by wrongful\ninterference with people's liberty, because if money is distributed\nequally at one time people will choose to act in ways that over time\nwill tend to result in unequal distribution of money at later times.\n(For the first objection, see Nozick 1974, chapter 7, for the second,\nsee Walzer 1983.)\n\n\nAnother objection to the ideal of monetary equality is that its\npursuit would inhibit people's engagement in wealth-creating and\nwealth-saving activity, and in the not very long run would reduce\nsociety's stock of wealth and make us all worse off in the terms of the\neffective freedom that was being equalized. Yet another objection is\nthat people behave in ways that render them more and less deserving,\nand monetary good fortune is among the types of things that people come\nto deserve differentially.\n\n\nThe advocate of egalitarianism in the broad sense has some replies.\nUnless some substantive argument is given as to why Lockean rights\nshould be accorded moral deference, the mere fact that equality\nconflicts with Lockean rights does not by itself impugn the ideal of\nequality. Maybe some purported \u201crights\u201d should not be regarded as\nmomentous, and their sacrifice to secure equality might be acceptable\non balance. In the same vein, one might hold that the fact that\ncontinuous restriction of individual liberty is needed to satisfy some\nnorm does not by itself tell us whether the moral gain from satisfying\nthe ideal is worth the moral cost of lessened freedom. Some\nrestrictions of liberty are undeniably worth their cost, and some ideal\nof equality might be among the values that warrant some sacrifice of\nliberty.\n\n\nEquality might be upheld as one value among others, and increase in\nwealth or in wealth per capita may be included along with equality in a\npluralistic ethics. We may want more effective freedom (of the sort\nmoney combined with goods for sale provides), and we may also want this\nfreedom equally distributed, and then we would need to find an\nacceptable compromise of these values to deal with cases when they\nconflict in practice. Much the same might be said about the conflict\nbetween the achievement of equality of money and the distribution of\ngood fortune according to people's differential desert.\n\n\nMonetary equality can strike one as a misguided ideal for the\ndifferent reason that it does not deal in what is of fundamental\nimportance. The value of purchasing power, equal or unequal, depends on\nthe value of what is for sale. Imagine that the economy of a society is\norganized so it produces only trivial knick-knacks. Freedom to purchase\ntrivia is a trivial freedom, and rendering it equal does not\nsignificantly improve matters. (Critics of consumerism and consumer\nculture are moved by the idea that in actual modern societies, the\neconomy, responsive to consumer demand, is responsive to demands for\nwhat is not very worthwhile and ignores many truly important human\ngoods, that either happen to be not for sale or that by their nature\nare not suitable for sale on a market.)\n\n\nAnother concern about monetary equality is that purchasing power\ninteracts with individuals' personal powers and traits, and real\nfreedom reflects the interaction, which an emphasis on purchasing power\nalone conceals. Consider two persons, one of whom is blind, legless,\nand armless, while the other has good eyesight and full use of her\nlimbs. Given equal money, the first must spend his money on devices and\nservices to cope with his handicaps, while the second may purchase far\nmore of what she likes. Here equality of purchasing power seems to\nleave the two very unequal in real freedom to live their lives as they\nchoose. But the case of handicaps is just an extreme instance of what\nis always present, namely each individual has a set of traits and\nnatural powers bestowed by genetic inheritance and early socialization,\nand these differ greatly across persons and greatly affect people's\naccess to valuable ways to live.\n",
