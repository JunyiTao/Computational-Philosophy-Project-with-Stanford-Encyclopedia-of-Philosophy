    "main_text": "Challenges and Defenses || Arguments from Unreliability\n3.3 Arguments from Unreliability\n\nA more plausible normative premise would hold that unreliable (rather\nthan uncalibratable) faculties cannot justify belief, yielding the\nfollowing:\n\n\nThe Argument from Unreliability\u2014First Version\n\n[P1] One is justified\nin believing on the (sole) basis of a putative source of evidence only\nif it is reliable.\n[P2] Intuitions (or\nintuitions of type T) are not reliable.\n[C]  Beliefs based\n(solely) on intuitions (or intuitions of type T) are not\njustified.\n\n\n\nInsofar as the normative premise is meant to articulate a necessary\ntruth, it is open to the \u201cnew evil demon\u201d counterexample\nto the necessity of reliability (Cohen 1984) according to which\nsubjects with exactly our experiences and beliefs are justified in\nbelieving as we do even if they are the victims of a deceptive evil\ndemon. As a natural interpretation of the reliability condition would\nbe contravened here, this is taken by many to demonstrate that\nreliability (so understood) is not a necessary condition of justified\nbelief.\n\nHowever, even those who reject [P1] typically allow that good reason\nto think a putative source of evidence is unreliable is\nsufficient to defeat whatever prima facie justification it\nmay otherwise provide. Hence, we may reformulate the argument as\nfollows in order to provide it with a more plausible normative\npremise:\n\n\nThe Argument from Unreliability\u2014Second Version\n\n[P1*]  One is justified\nin believing on the (sole) basis of a putative source of evidence only\nif one lacks (undefeated) reason to think it unreliable.\n[P2*]  We have\n(undefeated) reasons to think intuitions (or intuitions of type\nT) unreliable.\n[C]  Hence, beliefs\nbased (solely) on intuitions (or intuitions of type T) are not\njustified.\n\n\n\nAs the defense of [P1] or [P1*] requires appeal to epistemic\nintuitions, any attempt to justify by such means a skeptical\nconclusion regarding all intuitions, all epistemic intuitions or even\nall normative intuitions, would fail to observe the\nnon-self-undermining constraint.\n\nStill, it is worth considering the possible ways of attempting to\njustify skeptical arguments of a more limited sort by arguing\nthat intuitions of some sort (which does not include epistemic\nintuitions or at least the epistemic intuitions of the sort needed to\njustify the premises) are unreliable. Given that the relevant\nnon-normative premise must claim that intuitions of the sort at issue\nare more frequently false than true (or equally likely to be false as\nto be true) it seems to require an inductive justification based on a\nsufficiently large number of cases in which we have justification for\nbelieving \\({\\sim}p\\) while p is the content of an\nintuition.\n\nOne way of developing the case would involve a sufficiently large\nnumber of cases in which one has an intuition-independent\njustification for thinking \\({\\sim}p\\) while intuition testifies that\np (intrapersonal intersource inconsistency). Another\nwould involve a sufficiently large number of cases in which one has\nthe intuition that p and either oneself or some other person\nhas the intuition that \\({\\sim}p\\). In the intrapersonal case, this\nmight involve our finding a given proposition intuitive and, at some\nother time, our finding its explicit negation intuitive\n(intrapersonal intrasource inconsistency). More likely is a\nless direct inconsistency, as when we have two intuitions which,\nthough not the explicit propositional negations of each other, can be\nshown to contradict with the aid of some other justified principle.\nMany contemporary skeptics, however, wish to appeal to\ninterpersonal disagreement as justification for their\nskepticism. Here we should distinguish between cases in which some\nother person has intuition-independent justification for believing the\nnegation of the content of one of one\u2019s own intuitions\n(interpersonal intersource inconsistency) and cases in which\nthe other person has an intuition with a content contradicting\none\u2019s own intuition or, perhaps, fails to have any intuition\nregarding p (interpersonal intrasource\ninconsistency).\n3.3.1 Intersource Inconsistency\n\nAs noted when conceding the factual premise, [P2], of the Argument\nfrom Lack of Independent Calibration\n (\u00a73.2),\n on the sui generis accounts of intuition\n (\u00a71.3),\n there are few, if any, direct conflicts between the putative\ndeliverances of rational intuition and our other sources of evidence\n(Bealer 1998; BonJour 1998). Indirect conflicts would be ones\nin which the results of empirical theory contradict the content of\nrational intuitions. Such cases, if there are any, are quite rare.\n\nIndeed, in view of the lack of direct conflicts, there is substantial\nreason to think indirect conflicts must be quite rare as standard\nempirical theorizing seems unlikely to yield conclusions about the\ndomains about which intuition seems to inform us. These facts suggest\nthat interpersonal interfaculty inconsistency will also be an\ninsufficient basis for skepticism.\n3.3.2 Intrasource Inconsistency\n\nThe main case of intrapersonal intrasource inconsistency has\nbeen mentioned previously\u2014the case of paradoxes. To support the\npresent (limited) skeptical argument, however, it must be parlayed\ninto an argument that intuitions are so unreliable as to fail to\njustify belief at all.\n\nIt is not clear how this can be done. For one thing, there remains the\nfact that most of a person\u2019s intuitions are not in conflict with\none another. For another, some conflicts between intuitions can be\nresolved by standard means or by favoring the more intuitive\npropositions. This is not to claim that such disagreements might not\nrationally require a suspension of judgment about the actual\ncontradicting intuitions (if they are suitably balanced in strength).\nHowever, such a conclusion is quite limited and extends clearly only\nto areas of demonstrable and irresolvable inconsistency.\n\nThe case of greatest interest to skeptics is likely to be the case of\ninterpersonal intrasource inconsistency or disagreement. We\nmust be careful to distinguish between interpersonal conflicts of\nintuitions and conflicts between beliefs or between beliefs and\nintuitions. Philosophers disagree a great deal about the correct\ntheory of free will, knowledge, justification and the like.\nThis fact has been alleged to make a certain sort of epistemic modesty\n(though not complete skepticism) about the theoretical\naccomplishments of philosophy quite reasonable (Christensen 2007).\nHowever, philosophers seem to disagree less about what the relevant\nintuitions are. Bealer claims that\n\n\nthe on-balance agreement among our elementary concrete-case intuitions\nis one of the most impressive general facts about human cognition.\n(1998: 214) \n\n\n(See, however, \u201cthe variation project\u201d of experimental\nphilosophers discussed in\n \u00a74.1.)\n Functionalists, for example, don\u2019t usually claim to lack the\nintuition that the Chinese nation (Block 1978) would lack qualia.\nRather, they often go to great lengths to explain away such\nintuitions, formulate the functionalist theory to accommodate them\n(Putnam 1967), or selectively deflate their epistemic value.\nReliabilists don\u2019t typically claim that there is no new evil\ndemon problem (Cohen 1984). Rather, they engage in considerable\nmaneuvering to discount the intuition, to rephrase it in a way not\ndamaging to straightforward reliabilism, or, most commonly, to provide\nan alternative, recognizably reliabilist, theory which accommodates\nthe intuition.\n\nMuch of the recent literature on the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement is focused on cases in which two persons disagree with\nrespect to a single proposition which is inferentially\njustified, and in which the two parties are known to each\nother to have the same evidence and general cognitive\nvirtues (Christensen 2009). The lessons of such cases for the present\nquestions are likely to be limited. If intuitions are evidence which\nnon-inferentially justify belief, then even if one ought to suspend\njudgment in the aforementioned kind of case, it will not follow that\none ought to do so in the case of intuitive disagreements. Hence, we\nmust instead focus on cases of disagreement between non-inferentially\njustified beliefs or, more appropriately, on the propositional content\nof some non-doxastic basis for such belief. Feldman (2007) provides a\nperceptual case (explicitly compared to something like rational\nintuition) in which one person seems to see p and the other,\nsimilarly situated, does not seem to see p. When the two become\napprised of each other\u2019s appearances (and know each other to\nhave equally good vision and to be honest), Feldman avers that they\nmust withhold judgment on p. Perhaps the same is true with\nrespect to philosophical intuitions.\n\nHowever, it can be difficult to determine if another\u2019s failure\nto have an intuition that p is epistemically significant, as\nthey may have yet to really grasp or consider the precise proposition\nat issue. An analogous claim is true in the perceptual case as well,\nas when one sees an object which is well camouflaged and another\nclaims not to see it. Still, restricting ourselves to a situation in\nwhich one has good reason to think the other fully understands the\ncontent at issue and claims either not to have the intuition or to\nhave the contrary intuition, we must ask what the appropriate\nresponses to such cases is. Here, it does seem that the proper\nresponse is sometimes (depending on the proposition at issue)\nsuspension of belief or some suitable diminution of credence (BonJour\n1998: 138\u2013142). Even if the correct response to disagreement\nabout p in such cases is the suspension of belief (or a\nreduction of credence), it won\u2019t follow that beliefs in\npropositions about which no known disagreement exists are undermined.\nNor could it follow that one must always have independent reason to\nthink there is no disagreement prior to being justified in accepting\nthe content of an intuition. That would be impossible.\n\nA serious case for disagreement-based local skepticism regarding some\nentire class of intuitions which evades the non-self-undermining\nconstraint would require justification for thinking that quite\nsubstantial disagreement with some equally (or more) competent other\nperson has arisen. It cannot be supposed that the question of whether\none is justified in thinking that some apparent competent interlocutor\nis sincerely testifying that p is entirely independent of the\ncontent of their apparent assertion or of one\u2019s total evidence\nrelevant to existence of other minds and their mental contents of the\nappropriate sort. Some sorts of apparent disagreement call into\nquestion the understanding, sanity, intelligence, or sincerity of\none\u2019s interlocutor, as when some other denies some basic truth\nof arithmetic. Consider a version of Feldman\u2019s perceptual case\nin which there are successive occasions on which one seems to see\np and one\u2019s interlocutor apparently denies that they see\nany such thing. Were they to become frequent enough, there might be\nreason to doubt that the other is honest and competent, speaking\none\u2019s language, or, indeed, whether there is another person to\nwhom one is speaking. Similar obstacles arise for the possibility of\nvery widespread disagreement of intuitions, especially on views\naccording to which the reliability of intuitions is constitutive of\npossessing certain concepts (Bealer 1998; Huemer 2005; Ludwig\n2007).\n3.4 Arguments from Explanation\n\nMany of the most interesting arguments for skepticism regarding\nphilosophical intuitions do not appeal to direct evidence of\nunreliability, but are instead instances of what shall here be called\n\u201carguments from explanation.\u201d Such arguments maintain\neither that (a) the fact that our best explanations of the occurrence\nof intuitions (i.e., intuitings) do not appeal to the truth\nof their contents is reason to think we are not justified in accepting\nsuch contents, or that (b) the fact that we cannot provide any\nexplanation of how our intuitions are or could be reliable\nregarding the domains about which they might initially appear to\ninform us, is reason to think we are not justified in believing their\ncontents. Let us call former sort of argument \u201cthe argument from\nlack of explanatory necessity\u201d and the second sort, \u201cthe\nargument from inexplicability of reliability.\u201d Recent arguments\nof this sort have been discussed by those concerned with so-called\n\u201cdebunking arguments\u201d regarding our moral beliefs and\nintuitions (Street 2006; Clarke-Doane 2015).\n3.4.1 The Argument from Lack of Explanatory Necessity\n\nGilbert Harman (1977) suggests that moral theories are unjustified\nbecause they cannot be tested and confirmed in the way that scientific\ntheories can. While he admits that we may \u201ctest\u201d general\nmoral principles against our intuitions regarding particular actual\nand hypothetical situations, he argues that we are not thereby testing\nour moral theories or principles against the world. Instead, we are\nmerely testing them against our \u201cmoral sensibility\u201d or\nagainst our tacitly held moral views.\n\nHarman claims that there is an important difference between the use of\nobservations in empirical science and the use of intuitions in moral\ninquiry, a difference which renders moral intuitions unable to provide\nevidence for moral theory. The alleged difference is that\n\n\nyou need to make assumptions about certain physical facts to explain\nthe occurrence of the observations that support a scientific theory,\nbut you do not seem to need to make assumptions about any moral facts\nto explain the occurrence\n\n\nof the moral intuitions. When, for example, one has the intuition, in\nthe Transplant case, that it would be wrong for a doctor to kill an\nunconsenting healthy patient to save the lives of five other patients,\n\n\n\nan assumption about moral facts would seem to be totally irrelevant to\nthe explanation of your making the judgment you make\n\n\nand hence the intuition \u201cdoes not seem \u2026 to be \u2026\nevidence for or against any moral theory\u201d (1977: 6\u20137). The\nargument seems to be:\n\n\nThe Argument from Lack of Explanatory Necessity\n\n[P1] Aside from\npropositions describing the occurrence of her introspectively\naccessible states, S is justified in believing only those\npropositions which are part of the best explanation of the occurrence\nof those introspectively accessible states.\n[P2] Moral propositions\nare not part of the best explanation of the occurrence of\nS\u2019s introspectively accessible states.\n[C]  S is not\njustified in believing moral propositions.\n\n\n\nThe normative premise, [P1], is perfectly general and hence may be\nequally deployed to undermine justified belief of any proposition\nfailing its standard. Indeed, there seems equally good reason to think\nthat the propositions which are the contents of most philosophical\nintuitions will not be part (outside of attitude contexts) of the best\nexplanation of our having those intuitions. (See Goldman\n1989, 1992 for similar skeptical arguments regarding the use of\nintuitions in contemporary metaphysics.)\n\nOne possible response to this sort of argument is to concede [P1] and\nto argue, for the class of propositions at issue, that they do satisfy\nthe necessary condition of justification. This maneuver is represented\nby Sturgeon\u2019s (1984) rejoinder to Harman. Sturgeon suggests that\nit is often reasonable to think that we wouldn\u2019t think\nsome action or person possessed a relevant moral property unless they\nin fact possessed the property. More precisely, he holds that in order\nfor a given act or agent to have a different moral status it or they\nwould have to differ in some non-moral way and then we often would not\ntake it or them to have the same moral status. However, whatever the\nplausibility of this account with respect to actual token actions or\npersons, it is less clear how the counterfactual criterion would apply\nto the moral status of actions featured in the merely hypothetical\ncases found in typical methodology. Moreover, even if one takes\nSturgeon\u2019s maneuver to be successful against Harman\u2019s\nattack on moral intuitions, it seems quite unclear how it is to be\nextended to the many appeals to intuition catalogued above\n (\u00a72).\n\nIt has also been argued that [P1] is unjustified (Pust 2001). There\nappear to be only two ways that [P1] could be justified. It might be\njustified by being intuitive or by being supported by our intuitions\nregarding particular cases of justified belief. [P1] is not, however,\nintuitive. Furthermore, an inductive argument for [P1] based on our\nintuitions about particular cases of justified belief will not support\n[P1] since many of what seem, intuitively, to be our most justified\nbeliefs run afoul of [P1]. (See, for example, [I1]\u2013[I4] from\n \u00a71\n and the examples in\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a72.3.)\n Many of our particular epistemic beliefs, moral beliefs, and modal\nbeliefs seem, intuitively, no less justified than our empirical\nbeliefs. Indeed, some of them seem more justified. Since it seems\nimplausible that all of these propositions are required in the best\nexplanation of the occurrence of our intuitions, it seems that [P1],\nwhich requires such a role, is undermined by such cases.\n\nEven if there were sufficient intuitive support for [P1], defending\nthis argument by such means would contravene both strands of the\nnon-self-undermining constraint (Pust 2001). According to [P1],\nS\u2019s non-introspective belief that p is justified\nonly if the proposition believed plays a role in the best explanation\nof S\u2019s mental states. No demonstration of explanatory\nrelevance is involved in the two methods of justifying [P1] just\ndiscussed. Rather, each approach would take the mere fact that the\nprinciple is the content of an intuition or best explains the\ncontent of a set of particular intuitions (i.e., intuiteds)\nas sufficient for justified belief in that principle. This is to treat\nintuiteds as supporting evidence for a principle allowing\nonly intuitings to count as evidence. Moreover, since [P1]\nstates a necessary condition for the justified acceptance of\nany proposition not about the occurrence of an observation or\nintuition, acceptance of [P1] itself is justified only if it satisfies\nthe very requirement it articulates. Unfortunately, because [P1] is a\nnormative proposition about when a belief is justified, it is\ndifficult to see how its truth could play any role in the explanation\nof the occurrence of any of our experiences or intuitions.\nHowever, if [P1] does not satisfy [P1], then, if [P1] is true, we\ncannot be justified in believing [P1].\n3.4.2 The Argument from Inexplicability of Reliability\n\nThe second argument from explanation has its origins in\nBenacerraf\u2019s (1973) epistemological objection to Platonism in\nmathematics. Benacerraf argued that the best semantic accounts of\nmathematics (e.g., Platonist ones) were in tension with our best\ntheories of knowledge (e.g., causal ones) and that attempts to bring\nthe truth conditions of mathematical statements into closer epistemic\nproximity to human subjects were semantically inadequate. Though he\nclaimed to favor \u201ca causal account of knowledge\u201d and such\nan account is now generally thought mistaken, it should be noted that\nBenacerraf motivated the causal connection constraint by noting that\none may justify the claim that S does not know p by\narguing that S \n\n\ncould not have come into possession of the relevant evidence or\nreasons: that [S\u2019s] four-dimensional space-time worm does\nnot make the necessary (causal) contact with the grounds of the truth\nof the proposition\n\n\nfor S to have adequate evidence (1973: 671).\n\nField (1989) provides a Benacerraf-style epistemic challenge to belief\nin mathematics (construed in a Platonist fashion), one which he\nalleges \n\n\ndoes not depend on any theory of knowledge in the sense in which the\ncausal theory is a theory of knowledge; that is it does not depend on\nany assumption about necessary and sufficient conditions for\nknowledge. (pp.\u2009232\u2013233)\n\n\nOn his account, the fundamental problem has to do with the\nimpossibility of explaining \u201cthe reliability of our\nbeliefs\u201d in the domain in question. More precisely, he\nalleges that \u201cif it appears impossible to explain\u201d how our\nbeliefs about some entities or our grounds for the beliefs \u201ccan\nso well reflect the facts about them,\u201d then \n\n\nthat tends to undermine the belief in \u2026. (these) entities,\ndespite whatever initial reasons we might have for believing in\nthem. (p.\u200926, emphasis added)\n\n\nThough Field\u2019s argument has various of our beliefs as it target,\nit seems to support the following argument against intuition:\n\n\nThe Argument from Inexplicability of Reliability\n\n[P1] If we have good\nreason to think that there is no explanation of why our intuitions are\nreliable, then we are not justified in believing p on the basis\nof the intuition that p.\n[P2] We have good\nreason to think that there is no explanation of why our intuitions are\nreliable.\n[C] We are not\njustified in believing p on the basis of the intuition that\np.\n\n\n\nThe non-normative premise, [P2], seems to extend to all necessary\ntruths if the explanation of reliability mentioned in [P1] requires\nany sort of counterfactual sustaining relation between the truth\nmakers of the propositions in question and our psychological states.\nThe failure of explanation here is intimately linked to the intuitive\ndeviance of counterfactuals featuring in their antecedents the\nnegations of necessary propositions. The standard semantics treats\nthem as uniformly and vacuously true and so there is little\ninformative sense to be made of the notion that were some proposition\nwe take to be (necessarily) true to be false we would believe (or\nintuit) otherwise than we do. As it is implausible that all\nour beliefs in non-contingent matters are unjustified, this cuts\nagainst [P1] if it is taken to require a counterfactual supporting\nkind of explanation.\n\nIf, on the other hand, [P1] requires only that we have reason to think\nour reliability not utterly mysterious, then, while [P1] is more\nplausible, the relevant instance of [P2] may be false. It has been\nsuggested that the provision of an explanation of our having the\nintuitions we do would, in virtue of the impossibility of such\npropositions as we intuit having different truth values, suffice as\nan explanation of their reliability. There is no\nparticular reason to think that our intuitions lack explanation while\nour other mental states have an explanation. That explanation, when\nconjoined with our prima facie justification for believing\nthe contents of our intuitions (and our being prima facie\njustified isn\u2019t challenged on this construal of the argument)\nseems to suffice as an explanation of our reliability. Put\nanother way, if our reliability is a necessary accompaniment of having\na certain content, then we have no reason to think our reliability is\ninexplicable. The explanation, in this sense, of our\nreliability is a straightforward consequence of the necessarily true\ncontents of our intuitions and the psychological explanation for our\nhaving those particular intuitions (Pust 2004; Grundmann 2007: 84; but\nsee Schechter 2010).\n\nIt may also be argued (Pust 2004) that it isn\u2019t, as seems\nassumed by Field\u2019s objection, clearly possible for a creature to\nhave intuitions significantly different from our own. Given the more\nconstrained accounts of intuition discussed above, it is not clear\nthat a creature might have intuitions with contents generally\ncontradicting our own. That such a creature is metaphysically possible\nis itself a modal claim apparently requiring justification by\nintuition and such intuitions seem to be lacking. This response to the\nexplanationist can be elaborated in the context of a theory of concept\npossession according to which a necessary condition of the genuine\npossession of a given concept (of the sort of primary interest in\nphilosophical investigation) is the reliability of one\u2019s\nintuitions regarding hypothetical cases. Such an account is justified\nby intuitions and so cannot be an independent justification of them.\nIt may, however, still reasonably be thought to be an explanation\n(though not a causal one) of their (necessary) reliability.\n\nFinally, just as was true with respect to the Argument from Lack of\nExplanatory Necessity, there remains the concern that any attempt to\njustify believing [P1] and [P2] will run afoul of the\nnon-self-undermining constraint by relying on intuitions about\njustification and explanation in order to argue that\nintuitions do not justify belief.\n3.5 Defenses of Intuitions: Self-Support and Epistemic Circularity\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two ways of defending the use of\nintuitions as evidence. The first possible defense would be an\nempirical defense of intuitions by arguing against the second premise\nof the Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n (\u00a73.2).\n The defense would proceed by providing an inductive argument, based\non non-intuitive evidence, that the contents of intuitions (either\ngenerally or of some specific sort) are reliable.\n\nThe only other apparent possible defense of the thesis that intuitions\nprima facie justify belief in their content appeals, as does\nthe traditional rationalist, to the fact that there are many\nparticular propositions which one seems justified in believing simply\nin virtue of their being the content of a rational intuition (Bealer\n1998; BonJour 1998). The strength of the conclusion is, of course,\nmore supported to the extent that such examples are multiplied. And,\nas noted above, there appear to be many such examples.\n\nThis defense may be generalized by claiming that intuition is\nself-supporting insofar as the general claim that intuitions\nprovide prima facie justification for belief in their\ncontents is itself intuitive. The possibility of such a defense is the\nresult of the same fact that revealed that all of the extant local\nskeptical arguments run afoul of the non-self-undermining\nconstraint\u2014the fact that intuitions seem to be the only source\nof justification for claims about justification, reason, evidence, and\nother epistemic properties.\n\nThe obvious concern about this sort of defense (in both its particular\nand general form) is the fact that it necessarily involves epistemic\ncircularity of some kind. That is, it defends the appeal to intuitions\nas reasons for belief by appeal to intuitions. It seems clear that\nepistemically circular defenses are sometimes illegitimate, as when\nquestions about the epistemic probity of appeals to a crystal ball are\nanswered by consulting the ball. However, as indicated above\n (\u00a73.2),\n it also appears that some sort of epistemic circularity is\ninevitable in the attempt to defend our most basic modes of evidence\nand justification. Exactly when such circularity is epistemically\ndisabling and when, if ever, it is acceptable is a difficult question\nwhich cannot be here treated in detail (Alston 1986, 1993; Bergmann\n2006; Cohen 2002; Vogel 2008). However, a few remarks are in\norder.\n\nFirst, if epistemic circularity is always unacceptable, then\nit is impossible to defend the appeal to intuition. However, the same\nresult will follow (ultimately) for any putative source of evidence.\nSo, while it will be the case that the use of intuitions as evidence\ncannot be defended, it will also follow that the reliance on\nperception, memory and introspection can also not be defended.\nUniversal skepticism would appear to follow. Alternatively, if\nepistemic circularity is sometimes acceptable, then no reason has been\nprovided why it is not acceptable in the case of rational\nintuition.\n\nSecond, if we focus on the question of whether we are prima\nfacie justified in accepting the contents of our intuitions,\nthere may be a feature which distinguishes intuition from all other\nputative sources of evidence. Only intuition is clearly capable of\nepistemic self-support because it is the only source which produces\nnon-doxastic states with epistemically normative content.\nWhether or not apparent perception that p, introspection that\np, or apparent memory that p justify us in believing\ntheir content is, it seems, a question they cannot answer as their\ncontent is never epistemic. Hence, intuition appears distinguishable\nfrom our other putative sources of evidence in being both\nrequired for a coherent epistemology and capable of epistemic\nself-support. So, if any source of evidence can be defended against\nglobal skeptical attack, it seems that intuitions can.\n\nRecently, a number of philosophers have argued that the epistemic\ncredentials of intuitions can be defended by appealing to similarities\nbetween perceptual justification and intuitive justification or to a\ngeneral doctrine regarding non-inferential justification. According to\nperceptual dogmatism, a person having a perceptual experience\nor a perceptual seeming with propositional content p is thereby\nprima facie justified in believing p (Pryor 2000).\nAccording to intuitive dogmatism, a person having an\nintuition or intellectual seeming with propositional content p\nis thereby prima facie justified in believing p.\nAccording to general dogmatism, when it seems to a person\nthat p, that person is thereby prima facie justified\nin believing p. It follows from general dogmatism that\nintuitions, as characterized by the various versions of the sui\ngeneris state view above\n (\u00a71.3),\n are a source of justification (Huemer 2005, 2007). Moreover, it seems\nextremely plausible that if perceptual dogmatism is true, then so is\nintuitive dogmatism (Chudnoff 2011b; Koksvik 2011; Bengson 2015).\n\nWhatever the merits of general or perceptual dogmatism, it is\nimportant to recognize that appealing to them in defending intuitive\ndogmatism involves exactly the same sort of epistemic\ncircularity as that involved in the more straightforward defense\npreviously noted. This is because all versions of dogmatism are\nthemselves justified entirely on intuitive grounds\u2014by the fact\nthat they properly accommodate our various intuitions about the\nconditions under which a person has non-inferential propositional\njustification. Hence, appeals to dogmatism of any sort are ultimately\njustified only if intuitions do provide prima facie\njustification and so cannot serve as an independent defense of the\nappeal to intuitions. Epistemic circularity in the epistemology of\nintuition appears unavoidable.\n4. Experimental Philosophy and Intuitions\n4.1 The Nature of Experimental Philosophy\n\nIn the last ten to fifteen years, there has been an explosion of\ninterest in research involving the scientific or empirical\ninvestigation of intuitions of philosophical interest. Such projects\nare now frequently grouped under the rubric of \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy.\u201d (For general characterizations of experimental\nphilosophy see Knobe and Nichols 2008, Appiah 2008, and Nadelhoffer\nand Nahmias 2007.) At least four broadly-individuated projects in\nexperimental philosophy can be distinguished.\n\nThe first project, \u201cthe psychology project,\u201d aims\nto discover how people ordinarily think. Knobe and Nichols claim that\nthe results of such inquiries \u201chave great philosophical\nsignificance in their own right \u2026 for traditional philosophical\nquestions\u201d (2008: 12). This claim is motivated in part by the\nidea that questions which occupied the attention of historically\nsignificant philosophers ought to count as philosophically significant\nquestions. As many philosophers of antiquity and the early modern\nperiod made various claims about human psychology, such questions, it\nis claimed, count as philosophical questions which may be better\npursued by modern psychological inquiry.\n\nThe second project, \u201cthe verification project,\u201d\naims to determine if the various propositions which philosophers\nallege to be intuitive, pre-theoretical, or \u201cpart of common\nsense\u201d are, in fact, intuitive to ordinary non-philosophers.\nThis project is motivated both by the general conviction that\nempirical claims, such as those regarding the extent to which some\nbelief or intuition is shared by others, require adequate empirical\nsupport, and by the suspicion that what philosophers find intuitive or\nregard as commonsensical may be the result of their specialized\ntraining, theoretical allegiance, or general cognitive biases\n(Nadelhoffer and Nahmias 2007: 125; Knobe and Nichols 2008: 9). An\nexample of this approach can be found in Nahmias and colleagues\u2019\ninvestigations of free will (2006, 2007).\n\nThe third project, \u201cthe sources project,\u201d aims to\ndiscover the psychological mechanisms or processes that produce\npeople\u2019s intuitions. According to Knobe and Nichols, it is\nmotivated by the \u201chope \u2026 that we can use the information\nto help determine whether the psychological sources \u2026 undercut\nthe warrant for the beliefs\u201d based upon the source (2008: 9).\nSimilarly, Allman and Woodward suggest that\n\n\nbetter understanding of the sources and character of moral intuition\nwill help to clarify whether and when it has a legitimate role in\nmoral argument. (2008: 167) \n\n\nExamples of this approach include: Greene\u2019s (Greene et al. 2001;\nGreene 2003: 848) fMRI investigations of moral judgment (criticized in\nBerker 2009), Horowitz\u2019s (1998) attempt (see also Sunstein 2005)\nto explain certain intuitions taken to support the doctrine of doing\nand allowing using Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s prospect theory\n(criticized in Kamm 1998 and van Roojen 1999), and aspects of Nichols\nand Knobe\u2019s (2007) investigations of the role of affect on\njudgments regarding the compatibility of determinism and moral\nresponsibility.\n\nThe fourth project, \u201cthe variation project,\u201d\nseeks to determine the extent of variation in intuitions between\ndifferent groups, persons or persons-at-times or persons-in-contexts.\nMany working on this project hold that the empirically discovered\nvariation in intuitions gives us reason to believe that intuitions are\nunreliable (Alexander et al. 2010). Examples of this approach (which\ntraces its main intellectual lineage back to Stich 1988) include\nWeinberg et al. (2001) on cross-cultural variation in intuitions about\nknowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007), Swain et al. (2008) on order\neffects in intuitions about knowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007),\nBuckwalter and Stich (2013) on gender variation in intuitions of many\nsorts, and Machery et al. (2004) and Mallon et al. (2009) on\ncross-cultural variation in intuitions about reference (criticized in\nLudwig 2007; Devitt 2011; Deutsch 2009; Sytsma and Livengood\n2011).\n4.2 The Experimental Evidence\n\nFor experimental philosophers seeking to investigate the sources,\ncharacter, and distribution of intuitions of philosophical interest,\nthe primary method has consisted of asking subjects questions about\nhypothetical scenarios, or less frequently, about principles or\ngeneralizations. The evidence has been responses (whether binary\n[yes/no] responses or graded [Likert scale] responses) to such survey\nquestions. Those pursuing the sources project and the variation\nproject also aim to determine which factors co-vary with\nanswers\u2014cultural or ethnic group, socio-economic status, region\nof brain or cognitive processes implicated in answering the question,\npsychopathology, order of questions, framing of questions, etc.\n\nOf course, traditional first-person armchair methods seek to determine\nwhich features of the content of the scenario under consideration vary\nwith one\u2019s intuitions. Indeed, this is exactly how one endeavors\nto test or to make more precise some general thesis in many areas of\nphilosophy. Proponents of the sources project and the variation\nproject however, seek to determine which features of those considering\nthe scenario or of framing or presenting the same question vary with\nthe relevant intuitions.\n\nThere have been a variety of worries raised about the adequacy of\nsurvey methods as means of gaining access to intuitions of\nthe relevant sort. The strength of these worries vary according to the\nconception of intuition. If, as claimed by various sui\ngeneris state accounts\n (\u00a71.3),\n intuitions are not beliefs or mere dispositions to believe, then the\ninferential route from evidence consisting of survey responses to\nconclusions about intuitions is considerably lengthened.\n\nFirst, differences in responses may be produced by different ways of\n\u201cfilling in\u201d a schematic hypothetical case (Sosa 2007;\nHorvath 2015). Second, there may be multiple concepts answering to a\nsingle word (Sosa 2007). (For some recognition of this fact by\nexperimental philosophers, see the use of the\n\u201ccoin-flipping\u201d case by Weinberg et al. (2001) and Swain\net al. (2008) to exclude subjects who use \u201cS knows that\np\u201d to mean merely that S has high confidence that\np.) These two suggestions do not raise the possibility that\nthat the subjects in such surveys are not responding on the basis of\nintuitions. Rather, they raise the possibility that the intuitions are\nnot intuitions regarding the same property or about the same case.\n(See Alexander and Weinberg 2007 for the suggestion that both of these\nconcerns apply equally to non-solipsistic proponents of the\ntraditional armchair methodology.)\n\nA third, more general, worry is that such surveys run a risk of\neliciting from subjects responses determined by something other than\ntheir intuitions regarding the answer to the survey\nquestion\u2014e.g., by implicatures determined by what a sentence is\ntypically used to communicate (Adams and Steadman 2004; Deutsch 2009;\nBach 2002) and by more general pragmatic factors governing the\ndetermination of speaker meaning and task interpretation. These\nworries may be especially pressing in the odd and ambiguous context of\na set of hypothetical and often bizarre cases presented by a\nphilosopher to a philosophically na\u00efve subject unaware of the\nnature of the discipline (Scholl 2007: 580; Cullen 2010; Ludwig 2007).\nBengson (2013) argues that it is plausible that many survey responses\nare often not indicative of subjects\u2019 intuitions but are instead\nthe product of guesses, hunches, or inferences.\n\nSome proponents of survey methods claim that such worries have very\nlow prior probability and should not be taken seriously without\nexperimental confirmation. Those who raise them, however, claim to\nhave significant independent evidence of their general relevance\n(Cullen 2010; Scholl 2007) or their importance in producing the\nparticular results at issue (Bengson 2013). Some of these problems\nseem difficult to control for without engaging subjects in something\nlike philosophical dialogue and dialectic (see Kauppinen\n2007)\u2014i.e., by doing philosophy with them\u2014which is thought\nby many experimental philosophers to be a form of biasing or data\ncontamination.\n\nA final worry, of relatively recent vintage, concerns the extent to\nwhich the results in question are reproducible or robust. A number of\nrecent studies have provided reason to think that many published\npsychological results are not reproducible, with studies in social\npsychology being especially likely to fail attempts at reproduction.\nExactly what to make of this fact and how to respond to it is a matter\nof much current debate, but it should be noted that experimental\nphilosophers have begun to pay attention to the problem and to seek\nreplication of their results. The issue is quite complicated and the\nresearch moving quickly, but it appears that quite a few of the claims\nof cultural or gender differences have not proved robust\n(Seyedsayamdost 2014, 2015; Adleberg et al. 2014). These claims of\nvariation, as noted below, have been the primary empirical basis of\nskepticism regarding the evidential value of intuition.\n\nNothing precludes experimental philosophers from circumventing some of\nthe concerns just noted by using experimental paradigms other than the\nadministering of surveys. They may use reaction-time studies from\ncognitive psychology (Arico et al. 2011), empirical evidence from\nneuroscience (Allman and Woodward 2008; Greene et. al. 2001),\nevolutionary biology, or other sources. While such sources of evidence\nare not subject to the difficulties of surveys, they also appear\nunlikely to produce direct evidence of use to the verification project\nor the variability project because these projects require responses to\nthe abstract and detailed linguistic descriptions of cases one\ntypically presents in philosophical analysis. Indeed, Scholl (2007)\nsuggests that the most methodologically satisfactory experimental\nphilosophy will be primarily a version of the sources project\nimplicating rather low-level processes immune, in virtue of their\nmodularity, from the interpretive and pragmatic difficulties outlined\nabove.\n4.3 Experimental Philosophy and Skeptical Challenges\n\nThe sources project is, as noted above, often presented as a possible\nmeans of justifying skepticism regarding some class of philosophical\nintuitions. An analogy suggested by Knobe and Nichols (2008) is to\ndebunking explanations of religious beliefs. Theorists engaged in such\nprojects argue that religious belief (or religious experience on which\nsuch belief is based) is produced by some questionable process such as\nwish fulfillment, desire for a father figure, cultural indoctrination,\netc. It is then argued (or assumed) that this fact about the source of\nthe belief (or its direct internal ground) undermines the epistemic\ncredentials of such beliefs.\n\nThis may suggest that some skeptical proponents of the sources project\naim to motivate an instance of the Argument from Unreliability\n (\u00a73.3).\n As an example, consider Greene\u2019s fMRI-based arguments (Greene\net al. 2001; Greene 2003, 2007) against certain\n\u201ccharacteristically deontological\u201d intuitions in ethics.\nThe primary experimental data on which his argument is based is the\nfact that portions of the brain independently implicated in emotional\nreaction are more active when subjects consider cases giving rise to\ncharacteristically deontological intuitions than when they consider\ncases giving rise to characteristically consequentialist intuitions.\nHowever, critics will allege\n (\u00a73.3)\n that attempts to show that a process is unreliable (independent of\ndisagreement) require independent access to the target domain and such\nintuition-independent access seems lacking for most of the target\ndomains of philosophical inquiry. In this vein, Berker (2009) argues\nthat the best argument in Greene\u2019s work rests largely on other\nintuitions about the general normative insignificance of the\nfactors within hypothetical cases to which Greene believes\ndeontological intuitions are responsive. (See Unger 1996 for an\nentirely a priori criticism of many \u201ccharacteristically\ndeontological\u201d intuitions for their apparent responsiveness to\nintuitively normatively insignificant factors.)\n\nThe aforementioned analogy to debunking explanations of religious\nbelief might also be taken to suggest a version of the Argument from\nLack of Explanatory Necessity\n (\u00a73.4.1).\n According to that argument, the provision of an explanation of the\noccurrence of the intuitions in question (the intuitings)\nwhich does not appeal to the truth of their contents (the\nintuiteds) undermines belief in their contents. The role of\nexperimental work might be thought to be to support the factual\npremise of that argument (see Greene 2003: 849 for such a suggestion).\nAs we have seen\n (\u00a73.4.2),\n critics will claim that the argument relies on a questionable\nnormative premise and violates the non-self-undermining constraint.\nThey may also suggest that the plausibility of the non-normative\npremise of the argument derives from very general armchair (perhaps\neven entirely a priori) reflections on the contents of the\nintuitions, their truth-makers, and the nature of explanation. If so,\nthen the experimental investigations are idle.\n\nSome proponents of the variation project present us empirical evidence\nof disagreement between intuitions in order to motivate a version of\nthe Argument from Intrasource Inconsistency\n (\u00a73.3.2).\n Some critics of skepticism motivated by the variation project claim,\ncontrary to what was suggested earlier\n (\u00a72.4),\n that intuitions are not treated as evidence or reasons in\nphilosophical inquiry (Deutsch 2015; Williamson 2007; Cappelen 2012).\nWhether such a maneuver really evades whatever skeptical implications\nfollow from disagreement depends on whether disagreements of belief\nare epistemologically less troubling than variations in non-doxastic\njustifiers.\n\nThough critical of the variation project, Sosa\u2019s suggests that\n\n\n\nthere will definitely be a prima facie problem for the appeal\nto intuitions in philosophy if surveys show that there is extensive\nenough disagreement on the subject matter supposedly open to intuitive\naccess. (Sosa 2007)\n\n\nRelevant to determining whether the antecedent of Sosa\u2019s\nconditional is satisfied are the methodological concerns about survey\nmethods noted above and their ability to support claims of\nintuition disagreement. Relevant to determining the\npossibility of the antecedent of Sosa\u2019s conditional being\nsatisfied are the distinctively a priori concerns raised\nabove\n (\u00a73.4.2)\n about the possible extent of disagreement, about how the existence of\nwidespread disagreement could be justifiably believed to exist\n (\u00a73.3.2),\n and, importantly, about the non-self-undermining constraint.\n5. Further Research\n\nIn light of the foregoing, it seems that further research on the\nfollowing issues would be especially beneficial.\n\nThe first is determining the precise conditions under which epistemic\ncircularity is problematic. Though some epistemic circularity appears\nunavoidable, this would aid in determining the relative initial\nepistemological standing of intuition and perception.\n\nThe second is determining the exact actual and possible extent of\nintuitive disagreement and the proper response to such disagreement.\nThis would enable the proper evaluation of what appears to be the most\nserious sort of skeptical argument.",
