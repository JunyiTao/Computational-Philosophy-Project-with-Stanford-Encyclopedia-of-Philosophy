    "main_text": "\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy,\nreligion and morality have been closely intertwined. This is true\nwhether we go back within Greek philosophy or within Christianity and\nJudaism and Islam. The present entry will not try to step beyond these\nconfines, since there are other entries on Eastern thought (see, for \nexample, the entries on\n Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism\nand\n Chinese Ethics).\n The entry\nproceeds chronologically, giving greatest length to the contemporary\nperiod.  It cannot, within the present compass, aspire to be\ncomprehensive.  But it will be able to describe the main\noptions as they have occurred historically.  The purpose of proceeding\nhistorically is to substantiate the claim that morality and religion\nhave been inseparable until very recently, and that our moral\nvocabulary is still deeply infused with this history. Since there are\nhistorically so many different ways to see the relation, a purely\nschematic or typological account is not likely to succeed as well.\nThe entry will not try to enter deeply into the ethical theories of\nthe individual philosophers mentioned, since this encyclopedia already\ncontains individual entries about them; it will focus on what they say\nabout the relation between morality and religion. \n\n\nThe term \u2018morality\u2019 as used in this entry will not be\ndistinguished from \u2018ethics.\u2019 Philosophers have drawn\nvarious contrasts between the two at various times (Kant for example,\nand Hegel, and more recently R.M. Hare and Bernard Williams). But\netymologically, the term \u2018moral\u2019 comes from the\nLatin mos, which means custom or habit, and it is a\ntranslation of the Greek ethos, which means roughly the same\nthing, and is the origin of the term \u2018ethics\u2019. In\ncontemporary non-technical use, the two terms are more or less\ninterchangeable, though \u2018ethics\u2019 has slightly more flavor\nof theory, and has been associated with the prescribed practice of\nvarious professions (e.g., medical ethics, etc.). In any case, this\nentry will assume that morality is a set of customs and habits that\nshape how we think about how we should live or about what is a good\nhuman life. The term \u2018religion\u2019 is much disputed. Again,\nwe can learn from the etymology. The origin of the word is probably\nthe Latin\nreligare, to bind back. Not all uses of the term require\nreference to a divinity or divinities. But this entry will use the\nterm so that there is such a reference, and a religion is a system of\nbelief and practice that accepting a \u2018binding\u2019 relation to\nsuch a being or beings. This does not, however, give us a single\nessence of religion, since the conceptions of divinity are so various,\nand human relations with divinity are conceived so variously that no\nsuch essence is apparent even within Western thought. The ancient\nGreeks, for example, had many intermediate categories between full\ngods or goddesses and human beings. There were spirits (in Greek\ndaimones) and spiritual beings like Socrates's mysterious\nvoice (daimonion) (Apology, 31d1\u20134, 40a2\u2013c3). There\nwere heroes who were offspring of one divine and one human\nparent. There were humans who were deified, like the kings of\nSparta. This is just within the culture of ancient Greece. If we\nincluded Eastern religions in the scope of the discussion, the hope\nfor finding a single essence of religion would recede\nfurther. Probably it is best to understand \u2018religion\u2019 as a term for a\ngroup of belief/practice amalgams with a family resemblance to each\nother, but no set of necessary and sufficient conditions tying them\ntogether (see Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations,\n65\u20137).\n",
