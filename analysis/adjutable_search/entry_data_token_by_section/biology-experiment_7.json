Another important\nentity are so-called experimental systems. These are not to be\nconfused with model organisms: The latter is a biological species that\nis being bred in the laboratory for experimental work. An experimental\nsystem may involve one or several model organisms, and most model\norganisms are used in several experimental system. An experimental\nsystem typically consists of certain research materials (which may be\nobtained from a model organism), preparatory procedures, measurement\ninstruments, and data analysis procedures that are mutually adapted to\neach other.\n\nExperimental systems are the core of Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger\u2019s\n(1997) account of mid-20th Century research on protein\nsynthesis. Rheinberger characterizes experimental systems as\n\u201csystems of manipulation designed to give unknown answers to\nquestions that the experimenters themselves are not yet clearly to\nask\u201d and also as \u201cthe smallest integral working units of\nresearch\u201d (Rheinberger 1997, 28). He argues that research in\nexperimental biology always \u201cbegins with the choice of a system\nrather than with the choice of a theoretical framework\u201d (p. 25).\nHe then follows a certain experimental system through time and shows\nhow it exerted a strong effect on the development of biology. The\nsystem in question is a so-called in-vitro system for protein\nsynthesis that was developed in the laboratory of Paul Zamecnik at\nMassachusetts General Hospital in the 1950s. \u201cIn vitro\u201d\nmeans that the system doesn\u2019t contain any living cells. It is rather\nbased on a cell extract, originally from bacteria, later also from\nother organisms including rabbits and yeast. The cell extract is\nprepared in a way that preserves functionality of the protein\nsynthesis machinery. Instead of the RNAs that naturally occur in the\nsource organism, the in-vitro system may be \u201cprogrammed\u201d\nwith exogenous or even artificial RNA. Furthermore, the experimental\nsystem contains measurement procedures (sometimes called\n\u201cassays\u201d in experimental biology) for protein synthesis\nactivity. One such method is to measure incorporation of radioactivity\nintroduced by amino acids containing a radioisotope such as sulfur-35,\nbut there were other methods as well. Probably the most famous\nexperiment done with such a system is the experiment by Marshall\nNirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei (1961). These researchers added an\nartificial RNA, namely poly-U (U or uracil is one of the four bases of\nRNA) to the in-vitro system and showed that it produced a polypeptide\n(=protein) containing only the amino acid phenylalanine. Thus, they\n\u201ccracked\u201d the first \u201cword\u201d of the genetic\ncode, namely UUU for phenylalanine.\n\nOne of the central points of Rheinberger\u2019s analysis is that the\nin-vitro system was never designed to do this task. Its original\npurpose was to study protein synthesis in cancer cells. In addition to\nunraveling the genetic code and the mechanisms of protein synthesis,\nit was later used for various other purposes in biochemistry and cell\nbiology (for example, for studying the transport of proteins across\nendoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes). The system was\nthus not even confined to a single discipline, in fact, it to some\nextent lead to a re-organization of scientific disciplines.\nFurthermore, the system was also fused with other experimental system\nor it bifurcated into different systems. Experimental systems, like\nmodel organisms are at least as important as focal points that\norganize research as theories.\n\nWhile Rheinberger\u2019s account of experimental research in biology is\nright to put its emphasis on experimental systems rather than on\ntheories, it may be criticized for the ontology of experimental\nsystems that it contains. On this account, experimental systems are\nconstrued as very inclusive entities. They contain not only the\nspecific materials and apparatus necessary to do research, but also\nthe preparatory procedures, lab protocols, storage devices,\nmeasurement techniques, and so on. Thus, it is clear that such systems\nare not only composed of material entities; at least some of the\nconstituents of experimental systems are conceptual in\nnature. For example, a lab protocol that describes how to prepare a\ncell extract that will be able to carry out protein synthesis in vitro\nis really a conceptual entity. A researcher who is following such a\nprotocol is not merely manipulating materials, lab equipment or\nsymbols. Rather, she is acting under the guidance of concepts. (Action\nis always behavior guided by concepts). Among these concepts there may\nbe what used to be known as \u201cobservation concepts\u201d such as\n\u201csupernatant\u201d, \u201cpellet\u201d, \u201cband\u201d,\nand so on. Furthermore, the protocol will contain terms such\n\u201cmicrosomal fraction\u201d, which is supposed to designate a\ncertain sediment produced by centrifugation that contains microsomes\n(vesicles of endoplasmic reticulum membrane). Thus, the protocol also\ncontains theoretical terms.\n\nRheinberger refers to theoretical entities as \u201cepistemic\nthings\u201d. This concept signifies the \u201cmaterial entities or\nprocesses\u2014physical structures, chemical reactions, biological\nfunctions\u2014that constitute the objects of inquiry\u201d\n(Rheinberger 1997, 28). Epistemic things can unexpectedly appear and\ndisappear, or be re-constituted in new guises as experimental systems\nare developed. Sufficiently stabilized epistemic things can\n\u201cturn into the technical repertoire of the experimental\narrangement\u201d (1997, 29) and thus become \u201ctechnical\nobjects.\u201d One of Rheinberger\u2019s examples of an epistemic thing is\nthe ribosome (a comparatively large molecular complex of protein and\nRNA that catalyzes some of the crucial steps in protein synthesis).\nHere, it can be argued that whether or not some experimental setup\ncontained ribosomes is a theoretical judgment. Thus, an\nexperimental system contains materials and apparatus as well as\nobservation concepts and theoretical concepts. They are rather\nheterogeneous ontologically.\n\nIf jumbles are considered undesirable from an ontological point of\nview, it is also possible to construe experimental systems as\npurely conceptual entities. They are ways of acting in a\nlaboratory, and action is always guided by concepts. Material things,\ninsofar as they appear in experimental practice, are only parts of an\nexperimental system to the extent in which they are subject to\npurposeful experimental action. They can only be subject to such\naction to the extent to which they are recognized by an experimenter,\nfor example, as a microsomal fraction or an antiserum with a certain\nantigen specificity, and so on. A biological sample without its label\nand some researcher who knows what this label means is of no value\nwhatsoever; in fact, it isn\u2019t even a biological sample.\n\nIt can thus be argued that it\u2019s really thought and concepts that give\nan experimental system its identity and persistence conditions;\nwithout concepts it\u2019s really just a loose assemblage of plastic,\nglass, metal, and dead stuff coming out of a blender. On such a view,\nexperimental systems are not \u201cout there\u201d as\nmind-independent parts of a material reality; they exist only within\nsome concept-guided practice.\n",
