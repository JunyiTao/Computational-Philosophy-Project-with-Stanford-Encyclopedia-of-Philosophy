    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Redescription and Social Progress\n3.5 Redescription and Social Progress\n\nThe key imperative in Rorty\u2019s ethico-political agenda is the\ndeepening and widening of solidarity. Consistent with his\nethnocentrism, he distinguishes between \u201cus\u201d and\n\u201cthem,\u201d arguing that thinking of more and diverse people\nas \u201cone of us\u201d is the hallmark of social progress (CIS,\n191). Solidarity is brought about by gradual and contingent expansions\nof the scope of \u201cwe;\u201d it is created through the hard work\nof training our sympathies rather than through the recognition of\nantecedent criteria that stipulate what we have in common. We train\nour sympathies, Rorty thinks, by exposing ourselves to forms of\nsuffering we had previously overlooked. Thus, the task of the\nintellectual, with respect to social progress, is not to provide\nrefinements of social theory, but to sensitize us to the suffering of\nothers, and refine, deepen and expand our ability to identify with\nothers, to think of others as like ourselves in morally relevant ways.\n(EHO, Part III; CIS, Part III). The liberal ironist, in particular,\nsees \u201cenlarging our acquaintance\u201d (CIS, 80) as the only\nway to assuage the doubts she has about herself and her culture.\n\nThe task of achieving solidarity is, for Rorty, divided up between\nagents of love (or guardians of diversity) and agents of justice (or\nguardians of universality). Rorty writes,\n\n\nThe moral tasks of a liberal democracy are divided between the agents\nof love and the agents of justice. In other words, such a democracy\nemploys and empowers both connoisseurs of diversity and guardians of\nuniversality. The former insist that there are people out there whom\nsociety has failed to notice. They make these candidates for admission\nvisible by showing how to explain their odd behavior in terms of a\ncoherent, if unfamiliar, set of beliefs and desires \u2013 as opposed\nto explaining this behavior with terms like stupidity, madness,\nbaseness or sin. The latter, the guardians of universality, make sure\nthat once these people are admitted as citizens, once they have been\nshepherded into the light by the connoisseurs of diversity, they are\ntreated just like all the rest of us. (ORT, \u201cOn Ethnocentrism: A\nReply to Clifford Geertz\u201d 206)\n\n\nThis distinction between guardians of universality and guardians of\ndiversity corresponds to Rorty\u2019s distinction between\npropositions and vocabularies (see section 2.2). A change in our\nbeliefs may result from convincing argument that occurs at the\nintra-vocabulary level, within what Rorty earlier refers to as\n\u201cnormal discourse\u201d (PMN, 320). A change in what we\nperceive as interesting truth-value candidates occurs at the\ninter-vocabulary level, within \u201cabnormal discourse.\u201d\nAbnormal discourse, Rorty contends, can produce \u201canything from\nnonsense to intellectual revolution\u201d (PMN, 320). Which of these\nit will produce depends on whether the new descriptions offered up\ncatch on more broadly. Rorty identifies romanticism as the view that\nthe latter sort of change is the more significant one (CIS\n\u201cIntroduction,\u201d essay 1).\n\nThe guardians of diversity contribute to social progress by offering\nnew descriptions that the liberal ironist might find in her search for\nnew and compelling descriptions to adopt or incorporate into her own\nfinal vocabulary. In CIS, this role is attributed to strong poets and\nironist theorists on the one hand, and novelists and journalists, on\nthe other. Strong poets and ironist theorists, like Marcel Proust,\nFriedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Jacques Derrida, offer new\ndescriptions in their private attempts to achieve autonomy by getting\nout from under the final vocabularies they have inherited. Novelists,\nlike Vladimir Nabokov, George Orwell, Charles Dickens, Harriet Beecher\nStowe, and Radclyffe Hall, offer new descriptions that draw our\nattention to the suffering of previously-overlooked people and groups.\nThey contribute to social progress by pointing out \u201cconcrete\ncases of particular people ignoring the suffering of other particular\npeople\u201d (ORT, 79). Because reading novels is one of the best\nways to sensitize ourselves to the suffering experienced by others\n\u2013 to see that they have \u201cthe same tendency to bleed when\npricked\u201d (RR, 465) \u2013 Rorty thinks a liberal arts education\nis key to maintaining liberal democracy, and for strengthening a\nglobal human rights culture (\u201cHuman Rights, Rationality, and\nSentimentality\u201d in TP). In other essays, like \u201cFeminism\nand Pragmatism,\u201d the role of guardian of diversity is expanded\nto include prophetic thinkers, like Catharine A. MacKinnon and Marilyn\nFrye, who offer new descriptions in their public efforts to reduce\nsuffering.\n\nRorty ultimately refers to these methods for securing social progress\nas \u201ccultural politics.\u201d Cultural politics includes both\nnegative projects \u2013 abandoning words and descriptions that block\nour ability to sympathize with others \u2013 and positive projects\n\u2013 new ways of speaking that help us see that\n\u201cothers\u201d are \u201cjust like us,\u201d and therefore\ndeserve to be part of our moral community (\u201cCultural Politics\nand the Question of the Existence of God\u201d in PCP). Cultural\npolitics thus involves imagining and articulating utopian visions, a\ntask he contends falls naturally to the Left, which is, \u201cby\ndefinition, the party of hope. It insists that our nation remains\nunachieved\u201d (AOC, 14).\n",
