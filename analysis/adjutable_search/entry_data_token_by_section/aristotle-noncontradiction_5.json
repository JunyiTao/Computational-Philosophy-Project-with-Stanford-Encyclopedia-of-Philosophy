    "main_text": "The Principle of Non-Contradiction and Action\n6. The Principle of Non-Contradiction and Action\n\nAristotle notes that even if the opponent fails to speak, she must\nstill act, and if she acts in a certain way, that shows that she\nthinks that things in the world are one way rather than another, and\nthat some courses of action are better than others. That is why people\ndo not walk into wells or over precipices, and it shows that people\nthink it better not to walk into a well or over a precipice than to do\nso. Their actions show that they have beliefs that conform to PNC.\n\nIn response to Aristotle, one might wonder whether it is possible to\nact merely as if one has certain beliefs, without having\nthem. In Hellenistic philosophy, the question arises whether the\nskeptic can live his skepticism, and in modern philosophy the parallel\nquestion arises whether moral anti-realists can act on their theory.\nIf the answer is yes, then all Aristotle will have shown is that we do\nact as if we are committed to PNC, an answer that falls short\nof Aristotle\u2019s aim in Metaphysics IV 4, whether this is\ninterpreted as to show that PNC is true or to show that PNC is\nindubitable.\n\nOn this view, we are left with a skeptical Humean or pragmatic\naccount. Aristotle\u2019s account would be parallel to Hume\u2019s\nskeptical solution to the problem of induction: We just do proceed as\nif induction is correct, even though we lack any justification for so\ndoing. Or compare Wittgenstein: \u201c..the end is not an unfounded\npresupposition\u2014It is an unfounded way of acting.\u201d (On\nCertainty, Section 110).\n\nIs such a view coherent? Here it is appropriate to ask the skeptic\nwhat kind of justification she is seeking. The question returns us to\nthe problem of PNC being a first principle for which there is no\nordinary proof. Is it possible to act as if one has certain\nbeliefs even though one does not? Here the skeptic owes the\nnon-skeptic some account of \u201cas-if belief\u201d that differs\nfrom actual belief. If this is to act following \u201chow things\nappear to one\u201d, Aristotle is justified in asking whether they\ncan even appear to be F and not F to the same human\nbeing at the same time. \u201cAs-if belief\u201d may commit one to\nPNC just as much as actual belief does.\n\nAction is the place where our beliefs collide with the world. If the\nskeptic is skeptical about beliefs, it is not clear that she can\naccept that there are actions, as opposed to reflexes and\nother involuntary movements. Such a PNC-opponent would become a robot,\nnot just a vegetable.\n",
