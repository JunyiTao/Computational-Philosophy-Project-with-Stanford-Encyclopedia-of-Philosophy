    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Context\n6.1 Context\n\n\nSeveral issues in the historical and religious context of Reid's\nwriting influence his moral philosophy. First, Reid adopts what, for\nhis time, was a non-traditional approach to moral philosophy insofar\nas he is neither a rationalist, like Samuel Clarke or Richard Price,\nnor a sentimentalist like Hutcheson, Hume or Smith. Reid understood\nwhy it was that the unified front of cognitivists against Hobbesian\negoism had deteriorated into inter-nicene disputes between\nsentimentalism and rationalism. Reid's position inhabits a middle\nground because he rejected assumptions dividing these camps (Davis\n2006, ch. 2). Reid denies that a single faculty generates moral\nmotivation and moral judgment, and denies Locke's division of labor\nbetween sense and reason. Instead Reid argues on behalf of a moral\nsense capable of both motivation and judgment. He rejects rationalist\ngoals to identify and systematize necessarily true and general moral\nprinciples. He repudiates the sentimentalist's wayward account of\nmoral judgment, and its lapse into observer-dependent moral\nproperties. Seen in its context in the history of Early Modern moral\nthought, Reid attempts to draw the best from both groups in order to\navoid the errors of each.\n\n\nThe second relevant feature of Reid's context concerns the Scottish\nlegal tradition. Reid routinely discusses the competence of witnesses;\nthe \u2018final court of appeal\u2019 and first principles; inadmissible\nevidence for moral judgments; burdens of proof; etc. The Scottish\nlegal tradition places an abiding presumption of charity in witnesses\nand places faith in an independent judiciary. This is balanced by a\nnetwork of checks warranting credulity and securing\nimpartiality. These factors, and the competency of judges, provide the\ncontext for Reid's moral first principles, for their use and for their\nepistemological status. For example, criticisms that the moral first\nprinciples do not seem to be universally believed or self-evident must\nbe put in context of the fact that Reid's moral system presupposes, as\ndid the Scottish legal system, that it administers subjects of sound\nminds and common sense (Davis 2006, ch. 3).\n",
