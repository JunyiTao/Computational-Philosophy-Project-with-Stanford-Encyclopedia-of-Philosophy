    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Non-physical theories\n10. Conclusion\n\n\nA comprehensive understanding of consciousness will likely require\ntheories of many types. One might usefully and without contradiction\naccept a diversity of models that each in their own way aim\nrespectively to explain the physical, neural, cognitive, functional,\nrepresentational and higher-order aspects of consciousness. There is\nunlikely to be any single theoretical perspective that suffices for\nexplaining all the features of consciousness that we wish to\nunderstand. Thus a synthetic and pluralistic approach may provide the\nbest road to future progress.\n",
