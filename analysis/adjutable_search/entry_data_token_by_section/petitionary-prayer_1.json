    "main_text": "Divine Omniscience\n3. Divine Omniscience\n\nA different puzzle concerning the effectiveness of petitionary prayer\narises in connection with divine omniscience, the idea that God knows\neverything that can be known. If God already knows the future, for\ninstance, then how can petitionary prayer make a difference? The\nfuture, after all, is just the set of things that will happen. If God\nknows the future in all of its detail, then it seems that there is no\nroom for petitionary prayers to be effective: either the thing\nrequested in prayer is something that God already knows will be done,\nor it isn\u2019t, and either way, it looks like the prayer can make\nno difference. Like many other questions in theology, this puzzle\nraises an interesting question about the limits of God\u2019s\nknowledge. Is it possible for anyone, including God, to know the\nfuture in all of its detail? Philosophers disagree sharply about this.\nHere we will explore briefly three possible answers to this question.\n(For more on this, see Borland 2006 (Other Internet Resources) and the\nentries on\n omniscience\n and\n prophecy.)\n\nFirst, according to the view known as \u201copen theism,\u201d God\ncannot know those parts of the future that are yet to be determined,\nsuch as the future free actions of human beings, either because there\nare no truths to be known yet or because there is no way for anyone,\nincluding God, to know them (see Hasker 1989, Rissler 2006, the entry\non\n process theism,\n Other Internet Resources). This does not mean the God is not\nomniscient, because God still knows everything that can be known (and\nthat is what it means to be omniscient, according to open theists). So\nopen theists have a way to defuse the puzzle for petitionary prayer\ninvolving omniscience concerning the future: if our prayers are free,\nor God\u2019s decision whether or not to answer them is free (or\nboth), then those things cannot be part of a determined future and God\ncannot know about them in advance. But open theism is controversial\nbecause (among other things: see Rissler 2006) it appears to deny\nsomething that theists have affirmed traditionally, namely, that God\nknows the future in all of its detail.\n\nSecond, there is something called the \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d\nview. This position holds that God knows the future in all of its\ndetail as a result of knowing both (1) what everyone and everything\nwould do in any possible situation and (2) which situations everyone\nand everything will be placed in actually (see Flint 1998). According\nto this picture, God knows the future in all of its detail, but what\nGod knows about the future free choices of human beings depends on\nwhat they would choose\u2014and that is something that is up to the\nhuman beings in question, not up to God. Even though God knows what\nyou will do in the future, according to this picture, it is still up\nto you. In fact, when you make a free choice, you have the ability to\ndo something such that were you to do it, God would have always known\nsomething different from what he knows in fact. (This is sometimes\ndescribed in terms of having so-called \u201ccounterfactual\npower\u201d with respect to God\u2019s knowledge: see Flint\n1998.)\n\nAccording to the proponents of middle knowledge, then, petitionary\nprayer can still make a difference because God can take into account\nthose prayers that can be offered in the future when God plans how to\ncreate the world over time. The mere fact that God knows the future in\nall of its detail does not mean that this future is determined. So the\nproponents of middle knowledge have a way to answer the puzzle\nconcerning omniscience. But the theory of middle knowledge is very\ncontroversial; critics wonder whether there are truths about what\neveryone and everything would do in every situation, and even if there\nwere, how God could know such things (see the entry on\n prophecy and Zagzebski 2011).\n\nDefenders of a view called \u201ctimeless eternity\u201d hold that\nGod knows all of history at once, from a point of view outside of time\naltogether (see the entry on\n eternity.)\n Like the proponents of middle knowledge, the defenders of timeless\neternity will say that just because God knows the future, this does\nnot mean that God determines it. They will also say that God\u2019s\nsingle act of creation from outside of time has many effects in time,\nincluding, perhaps, answers to prayers that God anticipates from the\npoint of view of eternity. In this way, the defenders of timeless\neternity can answer the puzzle concerning omniscience. But like open\ntheism and the theory of middle knowledge, the idea that God is\ntimelessly eternal is controversial too; for one thing, if God can\ntell from the point of view of eternity what people will pray in the\nfuture, God should also be able to tell what God will do (if anything)\nin that same future, so it is hard to see how such knowledge could\ninform divine choices (see Hasker 1989, Flint 1998, Pruss 2007, Hunt\n2009, and Zagzebski 2011).\n\nIt is worth noting, in this section, the view known as \"theological\ndeterminism,\" according to which God determines everything in every\ndetail, and so knows the past, present, and future on this basis.\nAlthough theological determinism raises other questions about\ncreaturely responsibility and the problem of evil, it certainly\nexplains how God could know about future prayers in a way that permits\nGod to answer them. (For more on these questions, see Hasker 1989,\nTimpe and Speak 2016, White 2019, and Furlong 2019.)\n\nIt is also worth noting, in this section, that some philosophers have\nargued that not only does it make sense to pray for the future if God\nexists, but also it makes sense to pray for the past as\nwell\u2014such prayers could be effective, depending on the extent of\nGod\u2019s knowledge. For example, given the way we have described\neffective petitionary prayer, it could be possible for a prayer for\nsomething to have happened yesterday to be effective, as long as the\nthing in question actually did happen yesterday. This is because God\ncould know that I would offer the prayer in the future, and could have\ntaken this into account yesterday, as long as God can know the future.\nSo defenders of middle knowledge and timeless eternity can say that\nprayers for the past might be effective (but open theists, it seems,\ncannot say this: for more on this question, see Timpe 2005).\n",
