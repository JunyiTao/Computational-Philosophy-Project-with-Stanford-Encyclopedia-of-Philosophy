    "main_text": "Psychology || Dreams and Divination Through Dreams\n4.4 Dreams and Divination Through Dreams\n\nSince Simon\u2019s commentary on the Parva naturalia does\nnot contain commentaries on De sensu and De memoria,\nthe best place to reconstruct his views on the physiological and\npsychological mechanisms of sensory cognition is his commentary on\nDe somno et vigilia, which also covers De insomniis\nand De divinatione per somnum. Question 13* of this\ncommentary provides broad accounts of the physiological and\npsychological mechanisms of dreams and divination in dreams (ed.\nEbbesen 2013). \n\nAccording to Simon, dreams are produced by the common sense from\nimages (idola) sent to it by the phantasia. Dreams,\nhowever, have different origins, stemming either from the human being\nhimself or from celestial bodies. If from the human being, they either\nstem from his body or soul. Dreams stem from someone\u2019s body when\nthe powers of a bodily organ are affected by the choleric or\nphlegmatic humors (two of the four bodily fluids in Hippocratic\nmedical doctrine). When the organs are thus affected, the\nphantasia forms images that are in agreement with those\nfluids and sends them to the common sense. A person can then dream\nthat she is on fire, for example, if the choleric humor is dominant.\nDreams stem from someone\u2019s soul when during sleep the soul is\naffected by a memory, e.g., of a friend who is far away. A person can\nthen have a melancholic dream about her friend.\n\nDreams with their origin in the celestial bodies explain the\npossibility of divination in dreams. Such dreams originate from an\ninflux the human body receives from the celestial bodies. Thereafter,\nthe phantasia forms images in agreement with the influx and\nsends them to the common sense. When the organ of the common sense is\naffected by those images, the common sense produces likenesses of\nthings that will happen. Thus, thanks to the influx of the celestial\nbodies, humans can foresee future things in dreams, for instance,\nrelated to war or the fertility of the land. According to Simon, who\nfollows in Averroes\u2019s footsteps, this sort of dream is divinely\ngiven to humans because they lack the cognitive insight to know future\nthings that are useful or harmful. The premonitory dream, however,\ndoes not provide an exact sign of the future thing. In fact, the\ndiviner must interpret her dream in order to judge what the dream is\nsupposed to signify. Since divination is part of astrology, a good\ninterpretation requires that one understand properly both the\nmechanisms of dreams and celestial bodies (Ebbesen 2013: 144). When\nproperly interpreted, divination in dreams provides accurate\ninformation about the future:\n\n\n\u2026 it is infallibly true that the images formed by the\nphantastic power [i.e., the phantasia] are signs of such\neffects, and that these effects occur by necessity unless a stronger\nmotion supervenes, which \u2026 hinders those effects \u2026\n(Ebbesen 2013:\n 145)[9]\n\n\nSo, unless something unexpected happens that changes the course of\nevents, a properly interpreted dream originating from the celestial\nbodies is an almost certain indication that a useful or harmful future\nevent will take place.\n",
