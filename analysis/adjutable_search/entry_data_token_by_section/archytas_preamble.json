    "main_text": "\n\nArchytas of Tarentum was a Greek mathematician, political leader and\nphilosopher, active in the first half of the fourth century BC (i.e.,\nduring Plato\u2019s lifetime). He was the last prominent figure in\nthe early Pythagorean tradition and the dominant political figure in\nTarentum, being elected general seven consecutive times. He sent a\nship to rescue Plato from the clutches of the tyrant of Syracuse,\nDionysius II, in 361, but his personal and philosophical connections\nto Plato are complex, and there are many signs of disagreement between\nthe two philosophers. A great number of pseudepigrapha were written in\nArchytas\u2019 name starting in the first century BC, and only four\nfragments of his genuine work survive, although these are supplemented\nby a number of important testimonia. Archytas was the first to solve\none of the most celebrated mathematical problems in antiquity, the\nduplication of the cube. We also have his proof showing that ratios of\nthe form (n+1) : n, which are important in music\ntheory, cannot be divided by a mean proportional. He was the most\nsophisticated of the Pythagorean harmonic theorists and provided\nmathematical accounts of musical scales used by the practicing\nmusicians of his day. Fr. 1 of Archytas may be the earliest text to\nidentify the group of four canonical sciences (logistic [arithmetic],\ngeometry, astronomy and music), which would become known as the\nquadrivium in the middle ages. There are also some\nindications that he contributed to the development of the science of\noptics and laid the mathematical foundations for the science of\nmechanics. He saw the ultimate goal of the sciences as the description\nof individual things in the world in terms of ratio and proportion and\naccordingly regarded logistic, the science of number and proportion,\nas the master science. Rational calculation and an understanding of\nproportion were also the bases of the just state and of the good life\nfor an individual. He gave definitions of things that took account of\nboth their matter and their form. Although we have little information\nabout his cosmology, he developed the most famous argument for the\ninfinity of the universe in antiquity.\n",
