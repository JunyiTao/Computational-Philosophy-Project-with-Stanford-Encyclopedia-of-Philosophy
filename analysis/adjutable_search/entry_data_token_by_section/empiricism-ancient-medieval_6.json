    "main_text": "Ancient Empiricism || The Emergence of an Empiricist Attitude\n3.1 The Emergence of an Empiricist Attitude\n\nIf we think of empiricism as an attitude, rather than a clearly\nformulated doctrine, then it dates from the very beginnings of Western\nphilosophy, in the work of some Presocratic philosophers. Some care is\nneeded here, since we know of the Presocratics only through quotations\nand reports, found in authors who in some cases lived centuries later\nand who themselves had philosophical axes to grind. One of our major\nsources, for instance, is Aristotle. But Aristotle was not trying to\nwrite a carefully balanced history of philosophy; he was attempting to\nconstruct his own system and he sometimes reshaped his\npredecessors\u2019 views with this goal in mind (Cherniss 1935: 347).\nJudging from the quotations and reports we do have, it would be\ndifficult to describe the Presocratics as empiricists in practice.\nThere is little sign they engaged in what we would call\n\u201cempirical research\u201d: acts of observation intended to\ndiscover new facts or test hypotheses (Lloyd 1979: 139). Even if they\nhad, many of their claims about the natural world are sweeping and\nvague: it is far from clear how they could be tested empirically\n(Barnes 1982: 48). Despite this, some of the Presocratics did express\nsentiments that provide a foundation on which later empiricist\nthinkers could build.\n\nOf particular note are some sayings attributed to the Ionian\nphilosopher Heraclitus (fl. ca. 500 BCE). One fragment reads,\n\u201cThe things of which there is sight, hearing, experience,\n[these] I prefer\u201d (DK 22B55; Graham 2010: 149). Although the\ncontrast here may be between knowledge by experience and knowledge by\nhearsay (Kahn 1979: 106), it does suggest a confidence in knowledge\nthat comes from sense perception. It is, however, balanced by another\nsaying, which notes that \u201cpoor witnesses for men are the eyes\nand ears of those who have barbarian souls\u201d (DK 22B107; Graham\n2010: 149). This suggests that while the senses do provide knowledge,\nwhat they offer needs to be correctly understood. We find a similar\nattitude in Empedocles (ca. 495\u2013435 BCE), who, while emphasizing\nthe limits of human understanding, encourages his hearers to\n\u201cunderstand each thing in the way in which it is clear\u201d\n(noei d\u2019h\u0113i d\u0113lon hekaston, gleaning what\nknowledge they can from the senses (DK 31B3; Graham 2010: 343).\n\nEmpedocles\u2019s saying can be understood as a response to the work\nof the Eleatic philosophers, such as Parmenides (ca. 515\u2013445\nBCE) and Melissus of Samos (fl. ca. 440 BCE). Parmenides\nrelied on a priori arguments to reach conclusions that flew\nin the face of experience, while his follower Melissus argued for the\nunreliability of sense perception on the grounds that its deliverances\nwere contradicted by reason (Barnes 1982: 298\u2013302). Such\nteachings offered a challenge to the early scientific tradition\nestablished by Thales of Miletus (fl. ca. 585 BCE), for they\nsuggested that \u201cthe phenomena which science attempts to\nunderstand \u2026 are figments of our deceptive senses\u201d\n(Barnes 1982: 305). If there was to be a scientific tradition, it\nrequired a defence of sense perception over against pure reason.\n\nOther Presocratic thinkers take empiricism beyond a simple defence of\nsense perception; they also express suspicion regarding claims that go\nbeyond what can be observed. A key figure here is Xenophanes (ca.\n570\u2013475 BCE). Perhaps the best known of his sayings is fragment\n34: \u201cNo man knows, or ever will know, the truth about the gods\nand about everything I speak of; for even if one chanced to say the\nwhole truth, yet oneself knows it not; but seeming (dokos) is\nwrought over all things\u201d (DK 21B34; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield\n1983: 179). This is a cryptic saying, made more so by the fact that it\nlacks a context. But a plausible interpretation holds that in matters\ninaccessible to perception, we cannot be confident about the claims\nthat are made, since we have no way of independently verifying them\n(Hussey 1999: 22). Xenophanes\u2019s saying certainly expresses\ncaution about claimed knowledge of the gods. But if the phrase\n\u201ceverything I speak of\u201d refers to Xenophanes\u2019s\naccount of the physical world, it may also refer to knowledge of its\nunderlying principles (Barnes 1982: 139). Yet Xenophanes is no\nsceptic: he believes that growth in knowledge (broadly understood) is\npossible. As he is reported to have said, \u201cthe gods have not\nrevealed all things to men from the beginning; but by seeking men find\nout better in time\u201d (DK 21B18; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield\n1983: 179). Indeed Xenophanes himself seems to have made bold claims\nabout both the physical world and divinity. His empiricism is limited\nto the idea that in matters that go beyond what can be immediately\nexperienced we can expect to attain nothing more than \u201cbelief\n[dokos] and verisimilitude\u201d (Barnes 1982: 140).\n\nA striking feature of ancient empiricism is its association with\nmedical writers, and Xenophanes\u2019s caution about knowledge of the\nunseen is picked up by an early medical writer, Alcmaeon of Croton\n(fl. ca. 500 BCE), to whom the following fragment is attributed:\n\u201cConcerning things unseen (peri t\u014dn aphane\u014dn)\nthe gods see clearly, but so far as men may conjecture\n(tekmairesthai)\u2026 \u201d (DK 24B1; Kirk, Raven, &\nSchofield 1983: 339). Once again, it would be foolish to read a body\nof empiricist doctrine into such a cryptic (and apparently incomplete)\nremark. Yet it, too, indicates a contrast, not only between what the\ngods know and men may know (a commonplace of ancient Greek thought),\nbut between knowledge that can be obtained by observation and\nknowledge of \u201cthe unseen\u201d. Yet Alcmaeon himself appears to\nhave made claims regarding \u201cunseen matters\u201d (ta\naphan\u0113), not merely (as a medical writer) about the interior\nworkings of the body, but also about the soul and its immortality. So\nit would be mistaken to regard him as an explanatory empiricist,\nrejecting inferences to what is unseen. Indeed in its original\ncontext, the remark may have suggested that despite the difficulties\nof knowing what is unseen, careful investigation allows us to make\nsuch inferences (Huffman 2021: sect. 2.1). Indeed while\ntekmairesthai can mean \u201cconjecture\u201d, it can also\nmean to infer from \u201csigns\u201d (tekm\u0113ria), a\nphrase that would later be used for inferences from what can be\nobserved\n (sect. 3.3.3)\n\nStaying within the medical tradition, a similar caution about\nknowledge of \u201cthings unseen\u201d can be found in some of the\nworks attributed to Hippocrates (ca. 460\u2013370 BCE). The author of\none Hippocratic treatise argues against those who practice medicine on\nthe basis of some general principle or postulate\n(hupothesis). Medicine, he suggests, does not require a\ngeneral theory \u201cabout human nature\u201d (ho ti estin\nanthr\u014dpos), of the kind offered by Empedocles and other\nphilosophers (AM 20.1). Such general principles may be\nrequired when dealing with with matters that are \u201cobscure and\ndubious\u201d, such as \u201cthe things in the sky or under the\nearth\u201d (AM 1.3). But medicine differs from such\nspeculative sciences, since its conclusions can be confirmed by\nexperience. Of particular note here is the phrase \u201cthe things in\nthe sky or under the earth,\u201d which picks out the main areas of\nearly Ionian science (Barnes 1982: 139; cf. Plato Ap.\n18b8\u20139), regarding knowledge of which the author seems to be\nexpressing caution.\n\nAt first sight, this looks like an early expression of explanatory\nempiricism: a refusal to make inferences to things that cannot be\nobserved. But as in the case of Xenophanes and Alcaemon, it is better\nregarded as the expression of an empiricist attitude than an\nempiricist doctrine. Even leaving aside the fact that \u201cthe\nthings in the sky\u201d are not strictly unobservable, the same\nHippocratic work also speaks of discovering facts about what is inside\nthe body \u201cfrom evident things outside [the body]\u201d\n(AM 22.3). In particular, it argues, we can draw conclusions\nabout the body\u2019s internal organs by noting the behaviour of\ndifferent kinds of observable objects: those that are solid,\nstretched, spongy, porous, and so on. (The reasoning here is by way of\nanalogy, a common practice among the earliest Greek thinkers [Lloyd\n1992: 254\u201355; Allen 2001: 10\u201311].) This appears\ninconsistent with an explanatory empiricism, since it justifies\ninferences from what can be observed to what is (at least in practice)\nunobservable.\n\nTalk of discovering what is unseen from what is evident calls to mind\nthe maxim attributed to Anaxagoras (ca. 500\u2013428 BCE):\n\u201cAppearances are a vision of the invisible\u201d (hopsis\n\u2026 t\u014dn ad\u0113l\u014dn ta phainomena) (DK 59B21a;\nGraham 2010: 309). Not only was this principle employed in the\nHippocratic writings, but it was said to have been endorsed by\nDemocritus (ca. 460\u2013371 BCE) (Sextus M VII 1.140). For\nall his scepticism regarding sense perception (DK 68B6\u201310;\nGraham 2010: 592\u201395), Democritus seemed to think it had an\nevidential role (Asmis 1984: 345). In particular, he apparently\nbelieved it could confirm the atomist theory which Leucippus\n(fl. ca. 450\u2013420 BCE) had originated and he himself had\nembraced. There is, however, a difficulty here, as Democritus himself\nmay have realized, for in one report he has the senses utter the\nfollowing: \u201cWretched mind, after taking from us your evidence,\ndo you overthrow us? Our fall will be your defeat!\u201d (DK 68B125;\nGraham 2010: 597). The problem here is that while one can cite\nobservable facts (such as the fact of motion) in support of atomism,\nthat doctrine in turn suggests that appearances are deceptive (Barnes\n1982: 559\u201364), since the world does not appear to be made up of\natoms. As another fragment reads, \u201cby convention color, by\nconvention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and\nvoid\u201d (DK 68B9, 125; Graham 2010: 597). This contrast between\nwhat appears to be the case (which we accept \u201cby\nconvention\u201d) and what is actually the case threatens the\nundermine the atomist\u2019s appeal to the evidence of the\nsenses.\n\nWhat we find, then, in the work of some of the earliest Greek\nphilosophers is not only the first outline of empiricist doctrines; we\nalso find hints of the difficulties such doctrines would encounter.\nBut to find a clearer statement of an empiricist view of knowledge, we\nmust turn to the work of Aristotle.\n",
