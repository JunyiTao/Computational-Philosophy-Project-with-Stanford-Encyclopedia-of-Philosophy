Some critics concede that\nPAP is false, but insist that some neighboring principle\u2014one\nthat will serve many of the same purposes as PAP\u2014is immune to\nFrankfurt\u2019s examples. Others attack FSCs directly, arguing that\nthe examples fail to show even that PAP is false. The critical\nliterature is too large to cover in detail here, but this section\noutlines a few broad themes. (Among the many useful surveys are\nFischer 1999, 2011; Sartorio 2017; and the pertinent chapters of\nBeebee 2013; Griffith 2013; Timpe 2013.)\n",
