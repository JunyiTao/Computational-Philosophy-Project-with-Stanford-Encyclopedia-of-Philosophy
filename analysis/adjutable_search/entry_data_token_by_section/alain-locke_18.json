    "main_text": "Philosophy of Race || Social or Cultural Conceptions of Race\n6.4 Race Creeds, Race Practices, Racial Difference and Prejudice\n\nPolitical and social conceptions of race are more useful in explaining\nracial domination and cultural assimilation and pluralism than\nscientific theories of race, which have been thoroughly undermined as\nthe cause of cultural variation. Moreover, the distinctions made, the\nvery populations designated by, anthropological race, rarely if ever\ncoincide with those of ethnic race. The three conceptions carve up the\nworld differently, and of them, Locke finds the political analysis and\nsocial or ethnic conception of race more accurate historically and\nsociologically. This is a matter of some debate in recent work in the\nphilosophy of race. Also, advances in recent decades have raised\nimportant questions about the viability and usefulness of treating\ngenetically discernable populations of human beings as races. Locke\nprovides us further reason to doubt the viability of such projects.\nMoreover, he was adept enough to envision that even in the light of\nsuch advances it is a separate question whether the genetic\npopulations of evolutionary biologists track closely the social\npopulations putatively taken to be races.\n\nPutatively biological conceptions of race, Locke argues, are social\nfictions. This aligns his thinking with fictionalist, or antirealist\naccounts of race, and inclines him in the direction of racial\neliminativism. He argues that theoretical and scientific conceptions\nof race are misguided and ought to be eliminated for metaphysical,\nepistemological and normative reasons. Despite this he regards race as\na fundamental category for understanding human social interactions.\nThis informs his view that political conceptions of race are useful\nfor understanding the way a society\u2019s race creeds can rest on\nfalse beliefs, race practices are misguided and effectuate oppression,\nand understanding of the role of race in advancing imperialism and\ncolonialism. In good pragmatist fashion, Locke is careful not to\ninterpret political conceptions of race as postulating race as a\nmetaphysical reality. His political conception of race offers a model\nfor interpreting and analyzing a society\u2019s racial creeds and\nrace practices, it does not establish that race is a real biological\nor cultural factor of human populations or of individual persons.\nLocke argues that the only viable meaning of race is social. The\nconception of social race is for Locke the only plausible meaning of\nrace. This aligns him with contemporary social constructionist. Locke\nendorses a form of substitutionism by contending that metaphysically\nrealist conceptions of race should be abandoned in favor of ethnic or\nsocial race. His view is reconstructionist in that it aims to correct\nclassical racialist views as well as the prevailing metaphysically\nrealist views of his day.\n\nLocke distinguishes between racial conceptions and a society\u2019s\nrace practices. The social differentiations that produce various\nsocial groupings including races, result on his analysis from social,\npolitical, and economic causes. Locke does not deny that racial\ndifferences or racial prejudices exist. Racial differences, he\nthought, often parallel racial inequalities. (Locke, 1992, 1\u201314)\nLocke claims that \u201c[w]e should expect naturally that race theory\nshould be a philosophy of the dominant group.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 3)\nAs it was in the United States and other European colonial powers\nwhose members proffered racial theories that privileged dominant\ngroups. This leads Locke to argue that much of what has passed for\nrace theory in Western civilizations is \u201cbad science.\u201d\nSpecious justifications of exploitive and oppressive race practices\nabound, and such theories, Locke observes are resistant to correction\nby more accurate scientific investigation, or social scientific or\nhistorical facts.\n\nLocke is doubtful of the prospects of a thorough-going racial\neliminativism. He writes: \u201cI believe that a word and an idea\ncovering so indispensable, useful, and necessary a grouping in human\nsociety will never vanish, never be eradicated, and that the only\npossible way in which a change will come about will be through a\nsubstitution of better meanings for the meanings which are now so\ncurrent under the term.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 84\u201385) This is a\nclear articulation of Locke\u2019s racial substitutionism. He rejects\neliminativism as the appropriate response to problematic conceptions\nof race or pernicious race practices and creeds. But Locke, unlike Du\nBois, is not clearly a racial conservationist. He argues that\nprevailing conceptions of race are illegitimate, present race\npractices are pernicious, and contemporary race creeds unjust.\n\nLocke is arguably a qualified or partial eliminativist as he advocates\na radical redefinition of race in terms of culture, the elimination of\ncertain race practices, race creeds, and race prejudices. Race\nprejudices, Locke claims, are ultimately based on cultural differences\nand differences in the type of civilization. Racial difference is at\nbase a difference in the social consciousness of groups. Race\nprejudice erroneously assigns that variation to biological and\nanthropological factors that are unrelated to racial groups. This\nleaves racial prejudice in the paradoxical situation of being\n\u201can almost instinctive aberration in favor of anthropological\nfactors erected into social distinctions\u201d without any scientific\nwarrant for so doing. (Locke, 1992, 10)\n\nRace prejudices, Locke claims, result from aberrant psychological\npredispositions and tendencies. These habits often function\nunconsciously, but are not exempt from control and amelioration.\nMoreover, race creeds are for Locke distorted conceptual schemes and\nat the root of our notions of racial superiority and inferiority. Race\nprejudice and race creeds can and should be eliminated as features of\nrace practice. His racial eliminativism is partial or qualified\nbecause he advocates jettisoning the more pernicious forms of our race\npractice, and is adamant about substituting current racial conceptions\nfor the view of race as social culture.\n",
