    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism\n1. Methodological Naturalism\n\n\nMethodological naturalism has three principal and related senses in\nthe philosophy of mathematics. The first is that the only\nauthoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of\nnatural science (physics, biology, etc.). The second is that the only\nauthoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics are those of\nmathematics itself. The third, an amalgam of the first two, is that\nthe authoritative standards are those of natural science and\nmathematics.  We refer to these three naturalisms\nas scientific,\nmathematical, and mathematical-cum-scientific. Note\nthat throughout this entry \u2018science\u2019 and cognate terms encompass only the\nnatural sciences.\n",
