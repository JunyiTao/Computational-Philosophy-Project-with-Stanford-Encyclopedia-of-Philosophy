The Epiphenomenalism Objections\n\nIt has been widely held that Anomalous Monism cannot avoid\nepiphenomenalism\u2014the view that mental events lack\ncausal/explanatory powers. At a first approximation, the concern\nderives from a tension between mental anomalism and the apparently\nprivileged status assigned to physical properties in Davidson\u2019s\nframework\u2014in particular, that all events are physical, and all\nphysical events have a strict explanation in terms of other physical\nevents. It then becomes an important question what sort of\ncausal/explanatory role mental properties can play when all events\nalready have a physical explanation.\n\nSome welcome this result, holding that mental events explain actions\nin a sui generis way not accountable for in the terms of\ntypical scientific explanations (see von Wright 1971; Stoutland 1976;\nWilson 1985; Ginet 1995; Campbell 1998 and 2005 and related discussion\nin the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism).\n Many, however, see this charge as devastating to the prospects of\nAnomalous Monism\u2019s attempt to occupy a position between\nreductionist materialism and dualism. Without a distinctive causal\nrole for mental events to play in the explanation of action, many\nthink that they would lack the sort of robust reality needed to\ncompete with reductionism and dualism. On this way of thinking, only\ncausal powers can justify mental realism. So if Anomalous Monism\ncannot avoid epiphenomenalism, it appears to open the door to\neliminativist materialism, which holds that mental vocabulary and\nexplanations are vacuous and ought to be thrown out and replaced by\nneuroscience (assuming, which seems extremely doubtful, that\nneuroscience can itself supply strict laws\u2014if not, then this\nline of thought would lead to throwing out all but\n\u2018physical\u2019 strict law properties and explanations).\n\nAs noted, the epiphenomenalist worry arises from two points that are\nabsolutely basic to Anomalous Monism\u2014first, that mental events\nare at the same time physical events, and, second, that while mental\npredicates cannot figure into strict causal laws, physical predicates\nmust. Early critics moved quickly from these points to the\nepiphenomenalist conclusion that mental properties are causally\nirrelevant, because there are always strict law\nproperties\u2014physical properties\u2014to causally explain the\noccurrence of an event. (For detailed discussion of this line of\nargument, see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance.)\n Among many other problems with this line of argument, however, there\nis the one immediately capitalized on by Davidson: that within the\nextensionalist metaphysical framework in which Anomalous Monism is\ndeveloped\n (2.1\n above), properties don\u2019t cause anything, and so can be neither\ncausally relevant nor irrelevant. According the Davidson, only events\nare causal relata. He expresses general skepticism about\nepiphenomenalist objections to Anomalous Monism that depend on the\nidea that events cause \u2018by virtue\u2019 of the properties they\ninstantiate (Davidson 1993, 6, 13). This is closely connected to his\nsharp distinction between causation\u2014a metaphysical relation\nbetween particular events independently of how they are\ndescribed\u2014and explanation\u2014which relates events only as\nthey are described in particular ways. But as we will now see, this\ndoesn\u2019t end the concerns about epiphenomenalism. (For related\ndiscussion concerning epiphenomenalism and its bearing on the\nrelationship between Anomalous Monism and human freedom, see \n Related Issues: 3.2 Anomalous Monism and Contemporary Compatibilism.)\n",
