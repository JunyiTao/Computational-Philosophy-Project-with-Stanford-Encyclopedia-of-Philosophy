Quantifier criteria will undergenerate if they\nfail to account for all the implicit ontological commitments of\ntheories. Whereas the problems canvassed\nin \u00a71.6 for the sufficiency of a\nquantifier account can all be addressed by a devoted Quinean, the\nproblems with necessity are more serious. Indeed, they suggest that\nQuinean approaches that focus on the values of the variables of\nquantification should be jettisoned for a more general entailment\napproach to ontological commitment\n(\u00a72).\n1.7.1 Commitment to Properties or Universals\n To play its appointed role, a criterion of ontological commitment\nshould be ontologically neutral: it lets the theory speak for itself,\nas it were, without imposing ontological assumptions from the\noutside. Quinean criteria, however, by focusing only on the values of\nthe (individual) variables, have been accused of being ontologically\nbiased against realism about properties or universals because they\nfail to attach ontological significance to the\npredicate.[22]\nConsider \u2018\u2203x Swims(x)\u2019. According\nto Quinean criteria, this sentence is committed to entities that\nswim, but not to a property of swimming; for no property of swimming\nneed be among the values of the bound variables in order for the\nsentence to be true. One way to ensure ontological neutrality is to\nswitch to an entailment criterion. An entailment criterion\u2014such\nas the modal entailment criterion\nin \u00a71.5\u2014avoids bias by allowing\nany component of a sentence to contribute to its ontological\ncommitments, not just the (first-order) quantifiers and bound\nvariables. If universals must exist in order for a theory to be true,\nthen the theory is ontologically committed to universals; if not,\nnot. And the same goes for particulars, or any other ontological\ncategory. This neutrality, however, comes at a price. The ontological\ncommitments of a theory\u2014indeed, of a simple subject-predicate\nsentence\u2014cannot be determined prior to resolving the debate\nbetween nominalists and realists. Ontological commitments will not be\ntransparent. Even a professed nominalist may in fact be committed to\nuniversals, willy-nilly. (For more on entailment accounts,\nsee \u00a72.)\nIn response to the charge of ontological bias, the Quinean might\ntry to turn the tables on the objector: to take predicates to carry\nontological commitment would be to be biased against\nnominalism. If even \u2018\u2203x Swims(x)\u2019\nwere committed to properties or universals, no theory would be\ncompatible with nominalism. In any case, the Quinean will reject the\ncharge of ontological bias. Ontological commitment to universals is\nnot excluded by the quantifier criteria; a theory couched in a\nfirst-order language whose variables range over universals can be so\ncommitted. For example, the sentence\n\u2018\u2203x\u2203y (Universal(y)\n& y=Swim &\nInstantiates(x,y)\u2019 is committed to universals,\nas is, more simply, \u2018\u2203y\nUniversal(y)\u2019. The Quinean, then, simply asks that the\ncommitment to universals be made explicit in the same way that the\ncommitment to particulars is made explicit: by quantifying.\n1.7.2 Second-Order Languages\nAnother reason for refusing to allow predicates to carry\nontological commitment parallels Quine's reason for refusing\nontological commitment to names: just as there can be empty names,\nthere can be empty predicates. (An empty predicate is not a predicate\nwith the null set for its extension; it is a predicate with no\nextension.) If I introduce the name \u2018Herman\u2019 stipulating\nthat it refers to the one and only monster under my bed, I introduce\nan empty name; and sentences containing \u2018Herman\u2019 should\nnot thereby be ontologically committed to monsters.  Similarly, if I\nintroduce a predicate \u2018whish\u2019 stipulating that it\nexpresses a biological kind property that applies to whales and fish\nbut excludes rabbits and rhinoceri, I introduce an empty predicate;\nand sentences containing \u2018whish\u2019 should not thereby be\nontologically committed to any biological kinds.  Parallel problems\nadmit of parallel solutions: we can eliminate predicates in favor of\nsecond-order variables, and take ontological commitment, if any, to be\ncarried by the second-order variables rather than the predicates. (But\nwe cannot make our second-order language too austere: we need to have\nsome non-logical descriptive vocabulary to express the (non-logical)\ncontent of the theory.) The charge of ontological bias against Quinean\ncriteria is simply shifted: why allow first-order variables\nto carry ontological commitment, but not second-order\nvariables?\nFor Quine, this question simply doesn't arise.  Second-order logic\nis illegitimate because it treats predicates as if they were\nnames:\n\nPredicates have attributes as their \u201cintensions\u201d or\nmeanings (or would if there were attributes), and they have sets as\ntheir extensions; but they are names of neither. Variables eligible\nfor quantification therefore do not belong in predicate\npositions. (Quine 1970: 67)\n\nSecond-order logic is \u201cset theory in sheep's clothing\u201d:\nthe ontological commitments of set theory have been hidden under the\nguise of logic. To make ontological commitment transparent, Quine\nholds, second-order theories must be transformed into first-order\ntheories by replacing second-order variables with first-order\nvariables ranging over sets, and taking predication to be set\nmembership.\nFor the proponent of second-order theories, no such transformation\nis needed: the quantifier criterion can be applied directly to the\nvalues of the second-order variables. The ontological commitments of\nsecond-order theories will then depend on how the second-order\nvariables are interpreted. If the second-order variables range over\nproperties (\u201cattributes\u201d), then second-order theories are\ncommitted to properties; if instead they range over sets, then\nsecond-order theories are committed to sets. On either interpretation,\nany world at which a second-order theory is true will have either\nproperties or sets in its domain, and so the modal quantifier\ncriterion (from \u00a71.5) can be applied\nwithout amendment. Extending the quantifier criterion to second-order\ntheories, then, would seem to be within the spirit, if not the letter,\nof Quine's account of ontological commitment.\nIf the (monadic[23]) \nsecond-order quantifiers are\ninterpreted as plural quantifiers, as recommended by Boolos\n(1984), then, arguably,\nthey carry no additional ontological commitments beyond those already\ncarried by the first-order quantifiers. Plural quantification\nis ontologically innocent according to Boolos: to refer to\nsome things plurally\u2014some books, for example\u2014is not to\nrefer to a plural entity\u2014a set, or set-like entity, with books\nas members\u2014but to refer to the things\u2014the books\nthemselves\u2014in an irreducibly plural way.\n[24] \nIndividual and plural quantifiers range over the same domain. Since\nquantifier criteria attribute ontological commitment based on the\ndomain of quantification, they reveal no hidden ontological cost to\ntheories couched in an extension of first-order logic that includes\nplural quantification.  To get this result, we simply extend\nquantifier criteria to apply to plural as well as individual\nvariables. In slogan form: \u201cto be is to be the value of some\nvariable or the values of some variables\u201d (Boolos 1984). A plural variable takes as\nits semantic value a plurality of entities, not a plural entity (such\nas a set or class). Plural entities are not needed to serve as\nsemantic values\u2014not, in any case, if the language in which the\nsemantics is done is itself a plural language.\nWithin the framework of plural logic, however, there are two\ndistinctively different ways that a theory can be ontologically\ncommitted to entities, or kinds of entity, corresponding to the\ndistinction between distributive and collective predication (see Rayo\n(2007: 435\u20137), who calls the latter \u201cplethological\ncommitment\u201d). Suppose that \u2018K\u2019 is a\npredicate that applies to plural terms. If \u2018K\u2019\napplies distributively, then a theory that affirms the plural\nquantification \u201cthere are some things such that they\nare Ks\u201d introduces no commitment beyond that of the\nsingular quantification \u201cthere is something such that it\nis K\u201d. But if \u2018K\u2019 is a predicate\nthat applies collectively, then the plural quantification \u201cthere\nare some things such they are Ks\u201d is committed\nto Ks in a distinctively plural way that, in general, cannot\nbe captured in terms of its ontological commitments. For example, the\nmereological nihilist who holds that \u201cthere are simples arranged\nchairwise\u201d is thereby ontologically committed only to simples,\nnot to any plural entity containing simples; but she is also\ncommitted, in an irreducibly plural way, to there being simples\narranged chairwise.\n1.7.3 Intensional Languages\nQuine's criterion is silent on the ontological commitments of\ntheories couched within intensional languages\u2014languages with\nintensional operators such as \u2018it is possible that\u2019 or\n\u2018it will be that\u2019 or \u2018it is believed that\u2019. If\nit were directly applied to such languages, it would run the risk of\nundergenerating ontological commitments: perhaps there are commitments\nhidden by the intensional operators, as would be the case if they are\ndisguised quantifiers.  Quine's extended criterion involving\nparaphrase can be applied; but now there is a danger of\novergenerating. For paraphrases of theories couched within an\nintensional language into first-order predicate logic will almost\ninevitably have to treat the intensional operators as disguised\nquantifiers, and it may be that any adequate domain for those\nquantifiers will require controversial entities that do not correctly\nrepresent the ontological commitments of the original intensional\ntheory. For example, if modal theories are \u201ctranslated\u201d\ninto first-order logic in the standard way, where\n\u2018possibly\u2019 means \u2018at some possible world\u2019 and\n\u2018necessarily\u2019 means \u2018at all possible worlds\u2019,\nthey will be ontologically committed to possible worlds according to\nthe extended quantifier criterion. But this seems to just beg the\nquestion against the modalist who does not think she is so\ncommitted. (For problems with the extended\ncriterion, see \u00a74.2.)\nEntailment accounts of ontological commitment\n(\u00a72) get this right, but only by\ndodging the hard questions. Thus, if modal operators are\ndisguised quantifiers over possible worlds, then modal theories will\nbe ontologically committed to possible worlds according to an\nentailment account: possible worlds must exist in order for the\ntheories to be true. If modal operators are not disguised\nquantifiers over possible worlds, then modal theories need not be\nontologically committed to possible worlds according to an entailment\naccount. An entailment account will accurately reflect the ontological\ntruth; but it does nothing to help us discover that truth. \n1.7.4 Implicit Commitment: Extrinsic Properties\n Consider the sentence \u2018\u2203x\nParent(x)\u2019. Any criterion that focuses on the\nquestion\u2014what entities need to be among the values of the\nvariable \u2018x\u2019 in order for this sentence to be\ntrue?\u2014appears to get the ontological commitments of the sentence\nwrong (see Rayo 2007: 431\u20132). For the sentence appears to be\nontologically committed to children no less than\nto parents; but children do not need to be taken to be values\nof the variable in order for the sentence to be true (assuming, that\nis, that it is possible for a parent not also to be a child). We have\nhere, it seems, a stark division between two approaches to ontological\ncommitment: the quantifier approach, which looks only to the values of\nthe variables of the sentences of a theory, and the entailment\napproach, which looks to the existential entailments of the theory,\nand ignores whether or not the entities whose existence is entailed\nare values of the theory's variables. In cases where predicates\nexpress extrinsic properties, the quantifier approach undergenerates;\nit misses ontological commitments.\nBefore addressing the objection from extrinsic properties, it is\nimportant to note an ambiguity in the informal expression of the\nquantifier account. When we ask, following Quine, \u201cwhat entities\nmust be values of the variables\u201d in order for a\ntheory T to be true, we might mean: what entities must\nbe assigned to the variables of the sentences in T in order\nfor T to be true. Or we might mean: what entities must\nbe included in the domain of the interpretation of T in order\nfor T to be true, whether or not those entities must be\nassigned to the variables of the sentences in T. When\npredicates of the theory express extrinsic properties, this difference\nmatters. In this article, Quine's criterion\u2014and quantifier\ncriteria more generally\u2014have always been understood in the\nfirst, stronger way. But those philosophers who take Quine's criterion\nto be compatible with an entailment approach to ontological commitment\nare best understood as interpreting him in the second, weaker way.\nThere are two ways that one might try to defend the quantifier\naccount, neither very satisfactory. First, one might simply restrict\nthe predicates of the language of the theory to those that express\nintrinsic properties (and relations). Perhaps one could argue that the\ntheories Quine had primarily in mind, theories of mathematics and\nnatural science, obey this restriction already with respect to their\nprimitive predicates (though this has been contested even for physics,\nand is not plausible for the special sciences).  But this would be a\nrather severe restriction; and there is no evidence that Quine had\nintended the criterion to be restricted in this way. Moreover, it\nwould needlessly inject controversies over which properties and\nrelations are intrinsic into the application of the criterion,\nthreatening both its foundational and polemical roles.\nSecond, one might dig in one's heels and deny that\n\u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019 is committed to\nchildren. One familiar gloss on \u201cthe ontological commitments of\na theory\u201d takes this to include only \u201cwhat the theory\nsays there is\u201d. If \u201csays\u201d is interpreted narrowly,\na theory that contained only \u2018\u2203x\nParent(x)\u2019 does not say that children exist,\neven though this follows analytically from the theory. In defense of\nthe view, one can point out that the intuitive judgment that\n\u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019 is ontologically\ncommitted to children comes from including the definitions of\n\u2018Parent(x)\u2019 and \u2018Child(x)\u2019\nas an unspoken part of the theory. (Compare the defense of the\nmetalinguistic criterion in \u00a71.4.)\nThus, if we suppose the language contains, in addition to the unary\npredicate \u2018Parent(x)\u2019, the unary predicate\n\u2018Child(x)\u2019 and the binary predicate\n\u2018Parent(x,y)\u2019; and we suppose the theory\ncontains, in addition to \u2018\u2203x\nParent(x)\u2019, the sentences \u2018\u2200x\n(Parent(x) if and only if \u2203y\nParent(x,y))\u2019 and \u2018\u2200x\n(Child(x) if and only if \u2203y\nParent(y,x))\u2019, then the modal quantifier account gets\nthe ontological commitments of the beefed-up theory right: for every\nworld and sub-domain of the domain of that world such that the theory\nis true at that world with its variables ranging over that\nsub-domain, children are in the sub-domain. Perhaps the existence of\nchildren is an implicit commitment of\n\u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019; but, on the view\nbeing considered, the quantifier account should not be required to\ncapture all the implicit commitments of the theory.\nOne problem with this view, at least as a defense of\nthe modal quantifier account, is that it requires an\ninvidious distinction between different sorts of analytic entailment;\nfor, although \u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019 is\nnot committed to children according to the modal quantifier criterion,\n\u2018\u2203x Bachelor(x)\u2019 is\ncommitted to males. The chief problem, however, with accepting a\ncriterion that omits implicit ontological commitments is that it\nundermines the philosophical use of the criterion. Surely, the\nimplicit ontological commitments of the theory must be included in\ntabulating the ontological costs of a theory. Enjoining the theorist\nto \u201cmake all implicit ontological commitments explicit\u201d\ndoes not solve the problem because the theorist may not know, and may\nbe in no position to know, the implicit commitments of her\ntheory. Such ignorance, however, does not make the theory less\ncostly. It seems, then, that the problem of extrinsic\nproperties\u2014and, more generally, the problem of capturing\nimplicit ontological commitment\u2014provides a genuine\ncounterexample to quantifier accounts of ontological commitment.\n1.7.5 Implicit Commitment: Sets and Wholes\n The problem of extrinsic properties arises because there are\nanalytic connections between one predicate holding of a thing and\nanother predicate holding of some other thing.  Similar problems arise\nfor quantifier criteria if there are metaphysically necessary\nconnections between non-identical things. Thus, if a set cannot exist\nwithout its members existing, then it appears that a theory that\ncontains \u2018\u2203x x =\n{a, b}\u2019 is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of a. But a need not be assigned as a\nvalue to the variable \u2018x\u2019 in order for the theory\nto be true.  Similarly, if a whole cannot exist without one of its\nparts existing, then there appears to be implicit commitment. Suppose,\nfor example, that a human cannot exist without his head. Then a theory\nthat contains \u2018\u2203x x = Obama\u2019 is\nontologically committed to Obama's head. But, again, Obama's head need\nnot be assigned as a value to the variable \u2018x\u2019 in\norder for the theory to be true.\nResponses can be given that parallel the responses to the problem\nof extrinsic properties. And a parallel conclusion applies: to capture\nthese cases of implicit ontological commitment, one must switch from a\nquantifier account to an entailment account.\n2. Entailment Accounts of Ontological Commitment\n2.1 Overview\nAccording to an entailment account of ontological commitment: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\nif and only if T entails that Ks exist. One must\nspeak of an entailment account because different entailment\nrelations lead to different accounts of ontological commitment; the\nchallenge is to find the right entailment relation. But in\nany case, entailment accounts do not \u201clook to the values of the\nvariables\u201d for the ontological commitments of a theory.\nQuantifiers and variables have no privileged role; they figure into\nthe ontological commitments of a theory only to the extent that they\nfigure into the entailments of the theory, just as with other\ncomponents of the sentences of the theory.\nEntailment accounts, as understood here, have the feature that\nontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. (Thus, the metalinguistic\naccount discussed in \u00a71.4 is not\nincluded.)  Two theories that have the same content, then, have the\nsame ontological commitments. If we say that theories have the same\ncontent just when they mutually entail one another, then each\nentailment account comes with its own notion of content; the problem\nof finding the right entailment relation is just the problem of\nfinding the right notion of content, the notion that is relevant to\nontological commitment.\nIt is convenient, though not obligatory, to hypostasize content and\nspeak of the propositions expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory. That allows us to neatly separate the problem of determining\nthe ontological commitments of a theory (set of sentences) into two\ncomponents: What propositions are expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory? And, what are the ontological commitments, that is, the\nexistential entailments, of those propositions? Indeed, we could then\nchoose to construe theories as sets of propositions and treat all talk\nof sentences as outside the bounds of an account of ontological\ncommitment proper. But propositions are controversial entities, not\naccepted by all parties to the debate. To maintain neutrality, we will\ncontinue to apply ontological commitment to theories construed as sets\nof sentences, but with the understanding that, for the friend of\npropositions, the ontological commitment of sentences is just the\nontological commitment of the propositions those sentences\nexpress.\nThe principle advantage of entailment accounts over quantifier\naccounts is that they have no problem with implicit ontological\ncommitment. (Or, more exactly, since different entailment accounts\nwill differ as to what counts as implicit content, entailment accounts\nhave no problem with what counts as implicit ontological commitment by\nthat account's own standards.) If \u2018\u2203x\nHuman(x)\u2019 entails not only that humans exist, but that\nhumanity exists, then it is ontologically committed to properties or\nuniversals, even though no property or universal is the value of any\nquantified variable. If \u2018\u2203x\nParent(x)\u2019 entails that children exist, then\n\u2018\u2203x Parent(x)\u2019 is ontologically\ncommitted to children, again, even though it need not \u201cquantify\nover\u201d any children. An entailment account, unlike the quantifier\naccount, gets these cases right\u2014supposing, that is, we want our\naccount to capture implicit ontological commitment.\nFor a stark illustration of the difference between entailment and\nquantifier accounts, consider a theory T that contains the\nsingle sentence \u2018\u2203x K(x)\u2019\nand the theory T* that contains the single sentence\n\u2018True(T)\u2019 (see Peacock (2011: 81\u20132), who\ncalls T* a \u201cmeta-theory\u201d). T\nand T* mutually entail one another (assuming\n\u2018K\u2019 is not a semantical predicate); they thus\nhave the same ontological commitments on an entailment account. And\nthis seems right.  Surely, a philosopher cannot eliminate her\ncommitment to Ks by switching from T to T*;\nit matters not that T*'s commitment to Ks is only\nimplicit. But this implicit ontological commitment is invisible to the\nquantifier account because T* has no quantificational\nstructure. Once again, by missing implicit commitments, the quantifier\naccount fails to capture the ontological costs of a theory.\nThe principle disadvantage of an entailment account as compared\nwith a quantifier account is that it fails to provide a neutral\nplatform for assessing the ontological costs of theories:\ndisagreements over ontology will often reappear as disagreements over\nthe existential entailments of a theory. Here it is important to\ndistinguish two things that might be meant by \u201ccriterion of\nontological commitment\u201d. (This isn't always done; but Jackson\n(1989) and Rayo (2007) are clear on the distinction.) One might mean\na test by which ontological commitments can be discovered. Or\none might mean an analysis that says what ontological\ncommitment consists in. An adequate test would be a procedure\nthat could be applied by all parties in a neutral way, independently\nof those parties' prior ontological beliefs. Quine believed that the\nquantifier criterion provided such a test. He was aware, of course,\nthat there would be disputes over how best to regiment theories within\nfirst-order logic. But\u2014or so he thought\u2014once theories were\nregimented, the quantifier criterion would supply unequivocal\nverdicts.\nA correct analysis of ontological commitment, however\ntheoretically valuable, might do nothing towards providing an adequate\ntest. Such an analysis, unaccompanied by a test, would be of little\nhelp in determining the ontological costs of theories, or resolving\nontological disputes. Entailment accounts have good claim to providing\na correct analysis of ontological commitment; but they do not provide\na test. For one thing, the parties to an ontological dispute will\noften disagree as to what propositions are expressed by the sentences\nof a theory, that is, as to what the truth conditions of those\nsentences are. Quine's criterion bypasses this problematic step by\napplying the criterion only to already regimented theories. For a\nsecond thing, parties to an ontological dispute will often disagree\nover the existential entailments of a theory (see\n\u00a72.2 below).  Quine's criterion (as he understood it) avoids\nthis problem by focusing on the formal relation of logical entailment\nbetween sentences, a relation that is well understood. The material\nrelations of entailment between the propositions, however\u2014be\nthey modal, or conceptual, or a priori\u2014are matters of\nmuch dispute. If the goal is to find an adequate test for ontological\ncommitment, entailment accounts fall short.\nInitially, one might have hoped to combine an entailment\naccount, qua analysis, with a quantifier\naccount, qua test. (Arguably, this is the best way to\nunderstand Quine's project.) But the problems with implicit commitment\nsuggest that the entailment analysis and the quantifier test do not\nmatch up, that the test will undergenerate with respect to the\nanalysis. One could dampen one's ambitions, and be content with a\none-sided test, a test that in general provides only a sufficient\ncondition. (This is suggested by Rayo (2007: 432) as a response to the\nproblem of extrinsic properties.) But a one-sided test won't be of\nmuch help in comparing the ontological costs of theories. Such\ncomparisons require that all costs be put on the table.\n2.2 Modal Entailment Criteria\nThe problem of applying an entailment account to ontological\ndisputes is especially acute if the entailment relation is taken to\nbe necessary implication. That choice results in the\nfollowing criterion (introduced above\nin \u00a71.5):\n\nModal Entailment Criterion. A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff T\nnecessarily implies that Ks exist iff, for every\n(metaphysically) possible world w, T is true\nat w only if the domain of w contains at least one\nK.[25]\n\nOn this criterion, every theory is ontologically committed to every\nnecessarily existing kind of entity, what was called above\n(\u00a71.5) the problem of irrelevant\nnecessary existents. The problem can be ignored when comparing\nthe ontological costs of theories that disagree only over contingently\nexisting kinds: the irrelevant commitments are the same for both\ntheories, and cancel one another out. But many traditional ontological\ndisputes are over the existence of necessarily existing kinds of\nentity, such as mathematical entities or intensional\nentities. Consider, for example two theories that disagree only over\nwhether numbers exist. On the modal entailment criterion, these\ntheories have the same ontological commitments; moreover, supposing\nnumbers do exist, the theory that explicitly denies the existence of\nnumbers is nonetheless committed to numbers. Clearly, the modal\nentailment criterion fails to capture the intuitive notion of\nontological commitment.  Applying the criterion in this case will do\nnothing to further the ontological enterprise.\nJackson (1989) highlights the problem of irrelevant necessary\nexistents by comparing the following two arguments:\n\nB1.\n Materialism is true.\nB2. \n Materialism is ontologically committed to non-actual possible worlds.\nBC. \n Therefore, non-actual possible worlds exist.\n\n\nC1. \n Modal Realism is true.\nC2. \n Modal Realism is ontologically committed to non-actual possible worlds.\nCC. \n Therefore, non-actual possible worlds exist.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that non-actual possible worlds\nnecessarily exist. Then the second premises, B2 and C2, are both true\non the modal entailment account. Moreover, on the modal entailment\naccount, both of these arguments are necessarily truth preserving. It\nseems to follow that the conclusion that non-actual possible worlds\nexist can be supported either by arguing for B1, that modal\nrealism is true, or by arguing for C1, that materialism is true. But,\nsurely, an argument for materialism provides no support for the claim\nthat possible worlds exist. Or, to turn this around, an objection to\nthe claim that possible worlds exist does not cast doubt on\nmaterialism.\nJackson defends the modal entailment account in the following\nway. Although the two arguments are on a par with respect to validity,\nand the truth of their premises,\n\n there is an enormous epistemological difference\nbetween the arguments. \u2026 doubts about the existence of\nnon-actual possible worlds cannot cast doubt on B1, but can cast doubt\non C1. (Jackson 1989: 197\u20138)\n\nThus, there is an epistemological relation between propositions,\n\u201ccasts doubt on\u201d, which holds between CC and C1 but not\nbetween CC (=BC) and B1. Or, turning this around once again, there is\nan epistemological relation\u2014presumably some sort of a\npriori entailment relation\u2014according to which modal realism\nentails that non-actual possible worlds exist, but materialism does\nnot entail that non-actual possible worlds exist. Jackson says nothing\nto further characterize this relation, let alone provide a semantic\nanalysis. But, however the relation is precisely characterized, the\nnatural question to put to Jackson is: why not use that\nrelation, in place of modal entailment, to characterize ontological\ncommitment? For, clearly, this \u201cepistemological\u201d\nentailment relation better tracks our judgments as to the ontological\ncommitments of theories; and it is the \u201cepistemological\u201d\nrelation, not modal entailment, that will have to be brought to bear\nwhen comparing the ontological costs of theories positing necessary\nexistents.\nPeacock (2011) also defends the modal entailment account from the\nproblem of irrelevant necessary existents. In particular, he argues\nthat the ontological costs of theories positing necessary existents\ncan be compared by considering, not the theories' actual\ncommitments (which cannot be known prior to determining the truth of\nthe theories), but by considering \u201cwhat ontology\nwe would regard a theory as implicitly committed to, were it\ntrue\u201d (Peacock 2011: 93). This suggests that there is some\ncounterfactual relation between propositions according to\nwhich\u2014to return to Jackson's example\u2014non-actual possible\nworlds would have to exist if modal realism were true, but it is not\nthe case that non-actual possible worlds would have to exist if\nmaterialism were true. This counterfactual relation, of course, could\nnot be given a standard possible worlds analysis lest it apply\nvacuously to impossible antecedents. But even supposing a semantics\nfor such a counterfactual relation could be given, the natural\nquestion to put to Peacock is: why not use that relation, in\nplace of modal entailment, to characterize ontological commitment?\nFor it is this counterfactual relation, not modal entailment, that\nwill have to be brought to bear when comparing the ontological costs\nof theories positing necessary\nexistents.[26]\nIn sum: neither Jackson nor Peacock give any positive reason to hold\non to a modal entailment account, which is puzzling in light of the\nfact that each is committed to there being an entailment\nrelation\u2014be it epistemological or counterfactual\u2014that\nbetter fits the role that the notion of ontological commitment was\nintroduced to play.\n2.3 A Priori Entailment Criteria\nIf the notion of ontological commitment is to play a role in theory\nchoice or clarifying ontological disputes, then the ontological\ncommitments of a theory must be rationally accessible;\nfailure to acknowledge the ontological commitments of one's theory\nmust be a rational failing (see Michael 2008). That puts the following\nepistemic constraint on the entailment relation that is invoked by an\nentailment account of ontological commitment: the entailments of a\ntheory must be knowable by any ideally rational agent, that is to say,\nmust be knowable a priori. Does modal entailment meet this\nconstraint? With respect to the examples considered thus\nfar\u2014theories positing necessary existents\u2014it may depend on\nhow \u201cideally rational\u201d and \u201ca priori\u201d\nare understood; some philosophers would argue that entities that\nnecessarily exist can be known a priori to exist. But if\n(following Kripke 1980) we accept that there are necessary\npropositions that cannot be known a priori, then modal\nentailment will run afoul of the epistemic constraint. Suppose, for\nexample, that \u2018Water is H2O\u2019 is\n(metaphysically) necessary but not knowable a priori. Then\nthe theory containing the single sentence, \u2018Water exists\u2019,\nmodally entails that hydrogen exists. But, according to the epistemic\nconstraint, the existence of hydrogen should not be an entailment on\nan entailment account of ontological commitment. It appears that some\nsort of a priori entailment relation must take the place of\nmodal entailment in the analysis of ontological commitment:\n\nA Priori Entailment Criterion. A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks\niff T a priori entails that Ks exist iff,\nfor every conceptually possible world w, T is true\nat w only if the domain of w contains at least one\nK.[27]\n\nSwitching to an a priori entailment relation goes partway\ntowards restoring the applicability of an entailment account to\nontological disputes. It allows that philosophers\u2014if ideally\nrational\u2014will be able to agree on the ontological commitments\nof propositions. But there is still the problem of\ndetermining what propositions are expressed by the sentences of a\ntheory, that is, what the truth conditions of those sentences are. If\nthe sentences are couched within ordinary or philosophical English, so\nthat their truth conditions are not just a matter of stipulation,\nthere may be no resolving the dispute, even among ideally rational\nphilosophers (see \u00a74).\n3. Truthmaker Accounts of Ontological Commitment\n3.1 Overview\nQuantifier accounts of ontological commitment, we have seen, are\nliable to miss the implicit ontological commitments of\ntheories because they look exclusively to the values of the variables\nof quantification. Entailment accounts succeed in capturing implicit\ncommitments, but are liable to overgenerate if the entailment\nrelation fails to be sensitive to relevant ontological\ndistinctions. According to truthmaker accounts of ontological\ncommitment, being a truthmaker for a theory is just such a\nrelevant ontological distinction: to find the ontological commitments\nof a theory, we should look towards the truthmakers for that theory;\na theory is ontologically committed to Ks only\nif Ks are needed in order to make the theory true. According\nto truthmaker theorists, focusing on truthmakers will eliminate\nspurious ontological commitments of an entailment theory. The problem\nfor a truthmaker account, however, is how to do this without also\neliminating genuine ontological\ncommitments.[28]\nTruthmaker accounts, like entailment accounts, have the feature\nthat ontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. That will be so if the\nprimary truthbearers are taken to be non-linguistic propositions\n(individuated by content) rather than sentences. In that case,\nontological commitment applies directly to the propositions, or to\ntheories construed as sets of propositions, and only indirectly to\nthe sentences, or sets of sentences, that express those propositions.\nThat has the benefit, as with the entailment account, of freeing the\nnotion of ontological commitment from language (see\n\u00a72.1).  But taking propositions to be truthbearers will not\nbe to every truthmaker theorist's liking. Moreover, different views\non the nature of propositions\u2014possible worlds accounts,\nRussellian accounts, Fregean accounts, to name a few\u2014lead to\nsomewhat different truthmaker accounts. To remain neutral in what\nfollows with respect to the existence and nature of propositions,\nsentences will be taken to be the bearers of truth, and ontological\ncommitment will continue to be applied to theories construed as sets\nof sentences.[29]\nSay that an entity makes true (or is a truthmaker\nfor) a sentence or theory if the existence of that entity is, in\nsome sense, sufficient for the truth of the sentence or\ntheory. (It is left open for now just how to understand this notion of\nsufficiency.) In some cases, truthmakers are easy to come by. For\nexample, the sentence \u2018Socrates exists\u2019 has Socrates as a\ntruthmaker (assuming, at any rate, that Socrates has real\nexistence; see \u00a73.2 below). The\nsentence \u2018Elephants exist\u2019 has multiple truthmakers: each\nand every particular elephant (assuming elephants are necessarily\nelephants; see \u00a73.3 below). Other cases\nare more problematic. Consider the conjunction: \u2018Socrates exists\nand Plato exists\u2019. Neither Socrates nor Plato, by himself, is a\ntruthmaker for the conjunction; we need the pair of Socrates\nand Plato. But how should we understand \u2018pair\u2019 here? There\nare three options. If one is a universalist about mereological\ncomposition\u2014for any things, there is a mereological sum composed\nof just those things\u2014then perhaps the sum of Socrates and Plato\ncan serve as a truthmaker for the conjunction. If one is a realist\nabout sets\u2014and sets exist \u201cin the world\u201d when their\nmembers do\u2014then perhaps the set with Socrates and Plato as its\nmembers can serve as a truthmaker. But if we reject mereological\nuniversalism and set theoretic realism, then we will have to allow\nthat the truthmaker relation takes a plural argument: Socrates and\nPlato together are truthmakers for the conjunction, but there is no\nsingle entity that is a truthmaker. In what follows, it will be\nsimplest to speak as if, whenever a theory has truthmakers, it has a\nsingle entity as a truthmaker; but only minor emendations would be\nneeded to allow for plural truthmaking.\nSome sentences, it is natural to think, have neither singular nor\nplural truthmakers (see Lewis 2001). For example, a negative\nexistential sentence such as \u2018There are no unicorns\u2019 is\nmade true, it seems, not by what exists, but by what fails to exist:\nit is true for lack of any falsemakers. And whether a (contingent)\npredication such as \u2018the ball is red\u201d is made true by the\nball in question will depend on how the notion of sufficiency is\nunderstood (see  Supplement to\n\u00a73.3).  Truthmaker maximalists hold\nthat every truth (or at least every contingent truth) has a\ntruthmaker. Typically, truthmaker maximalists will\nintroduce states of affairs or facts to serve as the\nrequired truthmakers: totality states of affairs can serve as\ntruthmakers for negative existentials (see Armstrong 2004:\n72\u20135); the state of affairs of the ball's being red, not the red\nball itself, is the truthmaker for \u2018the ball is red\u2019 (see\nArmstrong 1997: 115\u20136).  There is a danger here that truthmaking\ncould be trivialized: could any true sentence S be said to\nhave the state of affairs that S as its truthmaker?\nTypically, truthmaker maximalists avoid such trivialization by holding\nto a sparse theory of states of affairs. For example, a disjunctive\nsentence \u2018S or T\u2019 is not made true by a\ndisjunctive state of affairs: there are none. Rather, the truthmakers\nfor S (if any) and the truthmakers for T (if any)\nare separately truthmakers for the disjunction \u2018S\nor T\u2019. In any case, truthmaker maximalism is not\nrequired for the truthmaker approach to ontological commitment. What\nmatters, rather, is that the truthmakers and the ontological\ncommitments of a theory are aligned.\nHow might a truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment be\nformulated? It will be useful to separately consider two versions, one\nfor ontological commitment to particular entities, the other for\nontological commitment to kinds:\n\nTruthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to a particular a iff,\nnecessarily, if T is true, then a is a truthmaker\nfor T.\nTruthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, necessarily,\nif T is true, then Ks are among the truthmakers\nfor T.\n\nNote that in the criterion for particulars the necessity is de\nre. The particular a itself must be a truthmaker\nfor T in any world where T is true. But in the\ncriterion for kinds the necessity must be taken to be de\ndicto (with respect to \u2018K\u2019) if the criterion\nis to give the desired results. For example, \u2018there are\nelephants\u2019 is ontologically committed to elephants according to\nthe criterion if some elephant or other is a truthmaker for\n\u2018there are elephants\u2019 in any world in which it is true,\nwhether or not any actual elephant is a truthmaker in those\nworlds.\nHow should we understand the truthmaking relation, and the way in\nwhich the existence of the truthmaker is sufficient for the\ntruth of the theory? On the orthodox necessitation approach to\ntruthmaking (Fox 1987; Bigelow 1988: 125; Armstrong 1997: 115; Lewis\n2001), this sufficiency is analyzed in modal terms as\nfollows: x is a truthmaker for T\niff T is true and, necessarily, if x exists,\nthen T is true. (A plural version replaces the singular\nvariable \u2018x\u2019 with a plural variable\n\u2018xx\u2019 (read \u201cthe xs\u201d).) This\nleads to a familiar problem when truthmakers are sought for necessary\ntheories: any entity (or plurality of entities) is a truthmaker for\nany necessary theory on the analysis. And there is the familiar fix:\nreplace modal entailment (in the analysis of truthmaking) with a more\ndiscriminating entailment relation, perhaps some sort of relevant\nentailment (Restall 1996). But for many truthmaker theorists, no\nentailment relation will be able to capture the idea that truthmakers\nmust be fundamental entities, and must ground the\ntheories they make true. This drives these truthmaker theorists to\nintroduce a primitive grounding or in-virtue-of relation to\ncharacterize the truthmaking relation: x is\na truthmaker for T iff T is true and,\nnecessarily, Ts truth is grounded in x\n(or T is true in virtue of the existence\nof x) (see Schaffer 2010 and Cameron forthcoming).  Call\nthis the grounding account of\ntruthmaking.[30]\nAccording to truthmaker necessitarianism, the existence of\nthe truthmaker necessitates the truth of the sentence: any\npossible world in which the truthmaker exists is a world in which the\nsentence is true. Truthmaker necessitarianism is automatic on the\nnecessitation analysis of truthmaking. On a grounding account,\ntruthmaker necessitarianism can be upheld by endorsing an axiomatic\nconstraint on the notion of grounding: if an entity grounds\nthe truth of a sentence, then, necessarily, if the entity exists,\nthen the sentence is true. The problems to be discussed\n(in \u00a73.3\nand \u00a73.4) apply to any truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment that endorses truthmaker\nnecessitarianism.[31]\n3.2 Deep vs. Shallow Ontological Commitment\nThe truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to kinds, as\nformulated above, strengthens the modal entailment criterion\n(\u00a72.2) since, necessarily,\nif Ks are among the truthmakers for T,\nthen Ks exist. Thus, on a truthmaker account, for a theory\nto be ontologically committed to Ks, it is required not only\nthat there exist Ks if the theory is true, but that there\nexist Ks that are truthmakers for the theory, if\nthe theory is true. The chief reason given for the strengthening\n(Cameron 2008, 2010) is this: if the Ks are\nnot fundamental entities, if they lack real\nexistence, then a theory can entail that Ks exist\nwithout thereby incurring ontological commitment to Ks. For\nexample, suppose one holds that, although it can truly be said that\nchairs exist, only (mereological) simples (or states of affairs\ninvolving those simples) are fundamental, or have real\nexistence. Moreover, suppose that only entities that are fundamental,\nor have real existence, can play the truthmaking role, in line with\nthe grounding account of truthmaking. Then, the (true) sentence\n\u2018chairs exist\u2019 is made true, not by chairs, but only by\nsimples arranged chairwise. It then follows on the truthmaker account\nof ontological commitment that \u2018chairs exist\u2019 is\ncommitted only to simples arranged chairwise, not to chairs. And,\narguably, this is the right result: chairs should not be counted\namong the ontological commitments of \u2018chairs exist\u2019\nbecause, on the view being supposed, they do not add to the\nontological cost of accepting \u2018chairs exist\u2019. In\nArmstrong's memorable phrase: they are \u201can ontological free\nlunch\u201d (Armstrong 1997: 12\u20133).  This result cannot be had\nby the quantifier account or the entailment account because these\naccounts are both insensitive to the crucial distinction between\nexistence and real existence. These accounts inevitably\novergenerate commitments, thus ruling out by fiat a minimal ontology\nthat accepts only simples.\nMuch more would have to be said in a defense of the truthmaker\naccount about the distinction between existence and real\nexistence.[32]\nBut let us suppose for what follows that the distinction is\nlegitimate, and has the ontological significance attributed to\nit. Still, one might wonder whether we have just changed the\nsubject. On the traditional notion of ontological commitment, as\nintroduced by Quine, it is supposed to be trivially true that\n\u2018Ks exist\u2019 is ontologically committed\nto Ks (see \u00a71.6.4). Instead of\nproviding an account of a theory's ontological commitment as\ntraditionally understood, the truthmaker account is an account of a\ntheory's fundamental ontological commitments. Looked at in\nthis way, the quantifier account and the truthmaker account are not\nin competition, and can live side by side (see Schaffer 2008). \nEven if the dispute is partly terminological, however, sometimes\nthe choice of terminology matters. It is important to be clear on what\nthe different notions of ontological commitment are, and how they fit\nin to the general project of ontology. Given a distinction between\nexistence and real existence, the notion of ontological commitment\nbifurcates into two distinct notions, one shallow and\none deep. On the shallow notion, entities that exist but do\nnot really exist are to be counted among the ontological commitments\nof a theory: it is trivial or analytic that \u2018Socrates\nexists\u2019 is committed to Socrates, and that \u2018elephants\nexist\u2019 is committed to elephants, whether or not Socrates or\nelephants have real existence. On the deep notion, only entities that\nreally exist count towards the theory's ontological\ncommitments. Ontological commitment, arguably, has traditionally been\ngiven the shallow interpretation; but that is because, within the\northodox Quinean setting, there simply is no ontologically relevant\ndistinction between existence and real existence. Once the distinction\nis accepted, however, and the project of ontology is construed to be\nthe project of discovering not what there is, but what\nthere really is, then it is only the deep notion of\nontological commitment that resonates with the ontological\n enterprise.[33] \nIt is an analysis of this deep notion, as given by the truthmaker \naccount, that matters for ontology.\nJust as there are shallow and deep notions of ontological\ncommitment, so there are shallow and deep notions of truthmaking.  On\nthe necessitation account of truthmaking, truthmaking is shallow:\nSocrates is a truthmaker for \u2018Socrates exists\u2019 and\nelephants are truthmakers for \u2018elephants exist\u2019, whether\nor not Socrates or elephants have real existence. On the grounding\naccount of truthmaking, truthmaking is deep: only real existents can\nserve as truthmakers.  Clearly, if we pair a shallow interpretation of\nontological commitment with a deep interpretation of truthmaking, then\na truthmaker account of ontological commitment is off the table: the\nontological commitments and the truthmakers of a theory will not be\naligned.  In evaluating a truthmaker account, then, it must be\nsupposed from the start that either both notions are taken to be\nshallow or both notions are taken to be deep. In what follows, both\nwill be taken to be deep in accord with the truthmaker theorist's\nintentions.\n3.3 The Problem of Inessential Predication\nLet us begin an evaluation of the truthmaker account with a problem\nfor the truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to\nparticulars: the problem of inessential predication. Consider\nthe sentence \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019, and suppose that Socrates\nreally exists. (If not, switch to an inessential predication whose\nsubject is an entity that really exists.) Then it seems undeniable\nthat \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 is ontologically committed to\nSocrates. But, given truthmaker necessitarianism and the orthodox\nunderstanding of essential properties, Socrates will not be a\ntruthmaker for \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 on the truthmaker\naccount. Wisdom, presumably, is not an essential property of Socrates;\nand so Socrates' mere existence does not necessitate his being\nwise. But, then, the truthmaker account of ontological commitment for\nparticulars wrongly claims that \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019\nis not ontologically committed to Socrates. Note that this\nproblem doesn't arise for essential predications. Suppose,\nfor example, that Socrates is essentially human. Then Socrates' mere\nexistence necessitates his being human, and \u2018Socrates is\nhuman\u2019 has Socrates both as a truthmaker and as an ontological\ncommitment. But pointing this out only seems to make matters worse for\nthe truthmaker account: why should \u2018Socrates is human\u2019 but\nnot \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 be ontologically committed to\nSocrates? Essential and inessential predications should be treated on\na par with respect to ontological commitment.\nAn analog of the problem of inessential predication applies to the\ntruthmaker criterion of ontological commitment to kinds. Consider the\nsentence \u2018philosophers exist\u2019, and suppose that\nphilosophers really exist. Then it seems undeniable that\n\u2018philosophers exist\u2019 is ontologically committed to\nphilosophers. Presumably, however, philosophers are not essentially\nphilosophers. And so, given truthmaker necessitarianism, no\nphilosopher is a truthmaker for \u2018philosophers exist\u2019: any\nphilosopher is such that he or she could have existed in a\nphilosopher-less world. The truthmaker criterion for kinds, then,\nwrongly claims that \u2018philosophers exist\u2019 is not\nontologically committed to philosophers. Call this the problem of\ninessential generalization.\nDifferent accounts of truthmaking\u2014of which entities are\ntruthmakers, and what their essential properties are\u2014will lead\nto different responses. Since adequate responses appear to be\navailable to the truthmaker theorist, these responses are relegated to\nthe supplementary document.\n3.4 The Problem of Sufficiency: Implicit Commitment Revisited\nThe truthmaker account of ontological commitment\u2014like the\nquantifier account, but for an entirely different reason\u2014has a\nproblem with capturing implicit commitment. The problem arises\nbecause the truthmakers for a theory, but not the ontological\ncommitments of a theory, are entities whose existence\nis sufficient for the truth of the theory. The problem\nafflicts both the truthmaker criterion for particulars, and for\nkinds. Indeed, assuming truthmaker necessitarianism, it follows from\nthe former criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nparticular only if the existence of the particular is both\nnecessary and sufficient for the truth of the theory; it follows from\nthe latter criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nkind only if the existence of some members (or other) of the kind\nis both necessary and sufficient for the truth of the\ntheory. But the examples of implicit commitment considered\nin \u00a71.7.4\nand \u00a71.7.5 suggest that sufficiency\nis not required for ontological commitment. The truthmaker account,\nlike the quantifier account, undergenerates\ncommitments.[34]\nTo illustrate the problem of sufficiency, consider the following\nexamples. Suppose, as is standard, that the existence of a set\nnecessitates the existence of any of its members. Then, intuitively,\nthe sentence \u2018{a, b} exists\u2019 is\nimplicitly committed to a, a result that is captured by\nentailment accounts of ontological commitment. But since the existence\nof a is not sufficient for the existence of\n{a, b}, a is not a truthmaker for\n\u2018{a, b} exists\u2019, and the truthmaker\ncriterion for particulars fails to capture this commitment. For a\nsecond example, suppose that, necessarily, elephants have trunks, but\nthat any trunk could exist without there existing any elephants.\nThen, intuitively, the sentence \u2018elephants exist\u2019 is\nontologically committed, not only to elephants, but to elephants'\ntrunks, a result that is captured by entailment accounts. But since\ntrunks are not among the truthmakers for \u2018elephants\nexist\u2019, the truthmaker criterion for kinds fails to capture this\ncommitment. For a final example, consider the sentence\n\u2018bachelors exist\u2019. Since it is analytic (suppose) that\nmales exist if bachelors exist, this sentence, intuitively, is\nontologically committed to males, a result that is captured by both\nquantifier and entailment accounts. But no male is a truthmaker for\n\u2018bachelors exist\u2019, since any male could exist without\nthere existing any bachelors. So, again, the truthmaker criterion for\nkinds fails to capture an implicit commitment.\nHow might a defender of the truthmaker account\nrespond?[35] It\nwon't do to claim that the notion of ontological commitment targeted\nby the truthmaker account doesn't include the missing implicit\ncommitments.  For one thing, the truthmaker criterion will let in\nthose implicit commitments that pass the sufficiency test, and there\nseems to be no principled reason for admitting these implicit\ncommitments, but not the others. More importantly, excluding implicit\ncommitments does not sit well with the chief motivation for a\ntruthmaker account, viz., that ontological commitments should reflect\nfundamental ontology; for commitments are no less fundamental for\nbeing implicit. The mismatch between the notions of ontological\ncommitment and truthmaking\u2014that the ontological commitments of\na theory are entities whose existence is necessary, given the truth\nof the theory, whereas the truthmakers of a theory are entities whose\nexistence is sufficient for the truth of the theory\u2014seems to be\na serious problem for a truthmaker account of ontological commitment,\nat least as presented above.\nPerhaps the best response to the problem of sufficiency for a\ntruthmaker theorist who wants to capture a deep notion of ontological\ncommitment is to omit the requirement that the ontological commitments\nof a theory be truthmakers for that theory. It is enough that\nthey are truthmakers for some theory or other, that is, that they are\nentities that really exist. This leads to the following criteria:\n\nWeakened Truthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to a\nparticular a iff T entails that a really\nexists.\nWeakened Truthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff T entails that Ks are among the entities that\nreally exist.[36]\n\nBut it is doubtful that this is properly called a truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment. The (deep) ontological\ncommitments of a theory are no longer being analyzed in terms of the\ntruthmaker commitments of the theory, but instead in terms of its\nfundamental commitments, its commitments to entities that really\nexist. And these, we have seen, are not the same.\n4. Ontological Commitment in Ordinary Language\n4.1 Overview\nIf a quantifier account of ontological commitment is to be applied\ndirectly to ordinary language, we need to know which ordinary language\nquantifiers or uses of quantifiers (if any) are ontologically\ncommitting. The same goes for entailment and truthmaker accounts,\nnotwithstanding our relaxed attitude in applying the accounts to\nordinary language examples. For on both accounts ontological\ncommitment depends on the entailment of existentially quantified\nsentences, and we need to know whether the quantifiers of the entailed\nsentences carry ontological commitment.\nQuine's considered view was that his criterion of ontological\ncommitment cannot be applied to theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage.  Before applying the criterion, the theory must be\nparaphrased into first-order predicate logic (without names); and\nthen, strictly speaking, it is only the first-order theory that\ncarries ontological commitment, not the ordinary language theory.\n[37] \n(The proponent of the theory can be convicted of holding the\nontological commitment if\u2014and only if\u2014she accepts the\nparaphrase.) For Quine, this view reflected his general approach to\nordinary language and ontology: the speakers of ordinary language,\ntypically, are not ontologically serious; it is the task of\nphilosophers, not ordinary folk, to determine which prima\nfacie commitments are genuine. There were also specific reasons\nwhy a direct application of his criterion to ordinary language might\nlead to erroneous results. For one thing, theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage containing non-extensional constructions might have\nontological commitments not revealed by quantificational structure (see \u00a71.7.3). For another thing, quantification\nin ordinary language might fail to carry ontological commitment if it\nis not objectual, not amenable to the standard Tarskian\nmodel-theoretic semantics\n (see \u00a71.6.2). Only the quantifiers\n of first-order logic, Quine\nheld, are guaranteed to be objectual (because we stipulate their\nsemantics); and only objectual quantification carries ontological\ncommitment.[38]\nOn closer inspection, however, Quine is in no position to claim\nthat theories couched in ordinary language never carry\nontological commitment. In giving the truth conditions for the\nquantifiers of first-order logic, Quine explicitly makes use of\nordinary language quantifiers (see, for example, Quine 1970). Thus,\nhis claim that the first-order quantifiers are objectual, and carry\nontological commitment, can't help but carry over to the ordinary\nlanguage quantifiers from which they derive their meaning. There\nmust, then, be some portion of ordinary language that can do all the\nwork, vis-\u00e0-vis ontological commitment, that the first-order language\nwas introduced to \ndo.[39] \nThis doesn't eliminate the need to seek\nparaphrases of ordinary language theories\n(see \u00a74.2 below). But such theories\nneed not be paraphrased into the language of first-order predicate\nlogic; it is enough if they are paraphrased into that regimented\nportion of ordinary language that can be counted on, in appropriate\ncontexts, to be ontologically serious. The problem that needs to be\naddressed by the Quinean is then: how to recognize which quantifiers,\nor which uses of quantifiers, make up this ontologically serious\nportion of ordinary language. Those who reject the Quinean approach\nto ontological commitment, on the other hand, need to argue that\nthere is no principled way to separate out those quantifiers, or uses\nof quantifiers, that carry ontological commitment in ordinary\nlanguage; or, more radically, that quantification in ordinary\nlanguage is never ontologically committing.\nThere is a wide spectrum of views on whether ordinary language\nquantification is ontologically committing. On one end of the\nspectrum is the view that all ordinary assertive uses of the\nquantifiers \u2018there is\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019 are\nontologically committing, a view that may be dubbed\n\u201callism\u201d (see Lewis 1990,\nand \u00a71.6.4 above). On this view,\ndiscovering the ontological commitments of ordinary speakers is\neasy. In asserting that \u201csome prime numbers are greater than\n100\u201d, we commit ourselves to the existence of numbers; in\nasserting that \u201cthere are properties that all great leaders\nhave in common\u201d, we commit ourselves to the existence of\nproperties. Ontological commitment cannot be avoided by paraphrasing\nthese sentences into the ontologically serious portion of our\nlanguage because these ordinary assertions are already ontologically\nserious.[40]\nHofweber (2005) agrees that quantification in ordinary language is\nsometimes ontologically committing, but not always, and not when we\nquantify over abstract entities, such as numbers and properties, in\nordinary (i.e., non-philosophical) contexts. Hofweber claims that\nthere are two distinct readings of ordinary language quantifiers,\nreadings that make different contributions to truth conditions and\nperform different communicative functions. One reading, which he calls\nthe \u201cdomain conditions reading\u201d, is tied to ontology: it\nplaces conditions on what exists in reality.  If I say\n\u201csomething fell on my head\u201d (in a standard context), I am\nthereby committed to the existence of an object meeting the condition\n\u201cfell on my head\u201d. But, Hofweber argues, there is another\nreading of ordinary language quantifiers that is not tied to ontology,\nwhat he calls the \u201cinferential role reading\u201d. On this\nreading, the inference from F(t)\nto F(something) is trivially valid, even in cases\nwhere we do not take the term t to refer to anything in\nreality. On this reading, I can infer \u201cthere is someone whom I\nadmire\u201d from \u201cI admire Sherlock Holmes\u201d without my\nquantified assertion conveying any ontological commitment.\nYablo (1998) holds that the distinction between quantified\nstatements that are ontologically committing and those that are\nnot\u2014if it can be made out at all\u2014will rest not on\ndifferent readings of the quantifiers, but on the distinction between\nliteral and figurative uses of language. Indeed, all parties agree\nthat figurative language can fail to be ontologically committing; one\ncan assert, truly, that she has butterflies in her stomach without\nthereby being committed to the existence of butterflies. But\nfigurative language is very widespread, even in the sciences. A case\ncan be made, for example, that ordinary talk of numbers is merely a\npretense we engage in to more easily communicate facts about the\nconcrete world; and similarly for talk of other abstract entities. The\nproject of applying ontological commitment to ordinary language\ntheories, then, is none too easy: it depends upon being able to\ndemarcate language that is literal from language that is partly\nfigurative; and it depends on there being a stripped-down core of\nordinary language that, when interpreted literally, has the\nrepresentational capacity for fully describing the world.\nOn the far end of the spectrum is the view that ordinary language\nquantifiers, by themselves, are never ontologically committing. A\nCarnapian might hold this view as a consequence of her general view\nthat ontological commitment, in a metaphysically loaded sense of the\nterm, is incoherent (see \u00a75.1). A Meinongian\nmight hold this view on the grounds that it is only the existence\npredicate, not the quantifier, that conveys ontological\ncommitment. The Meinongian, however, is in a weak position when she\nclaims that quantification over non-existent objects fails to be\nontologically committing (see \u00a71.6.3); for\nnon-existent objects don't differ from existent objects in their\ninstantiation of properties, or their having natures independent of\nour theorizing. Azzouni (2004), like the Meinongian, takes the\nexistence predicate to be what conveys ontological commitment; but,\nunlike the Meinongian, he denies that our talk of non-existent objects\nrequires that they have any sort of independent being. The\ntie between ontology and quantification is completely severed. All\nquantification\u2014like Hofweber's \u201cinference role\u201d\nreading of the quantifier\u2014is ontologically neutral.\nHow do the various views along this spectrum impact the Quinean\nproject of using paraphrase to provide substitutes for ordinary\nlanguage theories that can be evaluated for ontological commitment?\nFor Quine, as already noted, there is no presumption that ordinary\nlanguage quantification is ontologically serious.  But it is crucial\nto Quine's project that some portion of ordinary language can be used\nfor ontologically serious discourse, and that when so used,\nquantification holds the key to ontological commitment. The allist\nview, although compatible with the Quinean project, will lead to\nattributions of ontological commitment wildly different from Quine's\nown. It makes ontological commitment hard to avoid, leading to\noverpopulated ontological slums; the desert landscape favored by Quine\nwill be hard to come by.  Hofweber's view is more congenial to the\nQuinean project, so long as the \u201cdomain conditions\u201d\nreading of the quantifiers can be stipulated to be in effect. That can\nbe done, Quine seems to presuppose, merely by taking an appropriately\nserious attitude to the discourse in question. Inside the philosophy\nroom\u2014or, better, the ontology room\u2014that attitude is\npervasive. Outside the philosophy room, the philosopher is no less\nfree than other speakers to engage in ontologically frivolous\ndiscourse (see Quine 1960: 210). Yablo's view would be congenial to\nthe Quinean project if it were possible to make out the line between\nliteral and figurative discourse: Quine's ontologically serious\ndiscourse could then be identified with thoroughly literal discourse,\nassertively uttered. But Yablo is skeptical that any such project can\nsucceed, and sees that as dooming the Quinean approach to\nontology. Azzouni's view, of course, is outright incompatible with the\nQuinean project. It leads towards a substantially different account of\nontological commitment in which quantification plays no role (see\nAzzouni 2004: ch. 4).\n4.2 The Method of Paraphrase, and its Problems\nIf criteria of ontological commitment cannot be applied directly to\nordinary language, then attributions of ontological commitment to\nphilosophers\u2014or ordinary folk, but we will focus on\nphilosophers\u2014cannot be made just by examining the statements or\ntheories that they accept. Those statements or theories may\nhave prima facie ontological commitments, to be sure, in\nvirtue of their quantificational or referential apparatus. But some\nmethod is needed to determine which prima facie commitments\ncount as genuine commitments. Enter here the method of\nparaphrase endorsed by Quine and his modern day\nfollowers. According to this method, we must first ask the philosopher\nto provide paraphrases of her statements into the regimented portion\nof our language, paraphrases that are acceptable by standards agreed\nto in advance. We then apply our criterion of ontological commitment\nto the regimented paraphrases. If the philosopher provides acceptable\nparaphrases that are not ontologically committed to Ks, then\nshe is acquitted of commitment to Ks. If the paraphrases she\nprovides are ontologically committed to Ks, then she is\nguilty of such commitment. If she opts out, refusing to provide\nparaphrases into the regimented portion of language, then attributions\nof ontological commitment are moot.\nThe method of paraphrase dominated ontological discussion\nthroughout much of the twentieth century. For a detailed illustration\nof the method from its heyday, one can do no better than to turn to\nDavid and Stephanie Lewis's article \u201cHoles\u201d (Lewis and\nLewis 1970), a dialogue between two philosophers, a nominalist and a\nrealist about abstract objects. Suppose that the nominalist accepts\nstatements that are prima facie committed to\n(immaterial) holes, such as \u201cthere are holes in this\npiece of cheese\u201d. To be acquitted of this prima facie\ncommitment, the nominalist seeks a paraphrase that avoids\nit\u2014not just for this one sentence, but for ordinary discourse\nabout holes generally. To be acceptable, the paraphrases should\npreserve the truth of those statements about holes, and the validity\nof those arguments about holes, that are endorsed by ordinary\nspeakers. As a first stab, she might make use of the predicate\n\u2018perforated\u2019 and paraphrase \u201cthere are holes in\nthis piece of cheese\u201d as \u201cthe cheese is\nperforated\u201d. This allows the nominalist to continue to\n\u201cspeak with the vulgar\u201d without taking on a commitment to\nholes. But the predicate \u2018perforated\u2019 won't help in\nproviding paraphrases for statements that count holes, such as\n\u201cthere are seventeen holes in this piece of cheese\u201d.\nHere the nominalist could introduce a separate predicate,\n\u2018n-perforated\u2019, for each n. That,\nhowever, would violate strictures against infinitely many primitive\npredicates in the regimented language; and it wouldn't be of much\nhelp in paraphrasing numerical comparisons such as \u201cthere are\nas many holes in this piece of cheese as there are crackers on this\nplate\u201d. In the case of discourse about holes, the nominalist\ndoes better to turn to a different strategy of paraphrase:\nontological reduction.[41] \nAn ontological reduction maintains the\nquantificational structure of the discourse, but restricts the\nunderlying domain to uncontroversial entities, in this case, material\nobjects. For example, \u201cthere are holes in this piece of\ncheese\u201d can be taken to quantify, not over immaterial holes,\nbut over material hole-linings; talk of holes is interpreted as talk\nof the hole-linings that, intuitively, surround the holes. Problems\npersist: identity conditions for holes and hole-linings do not agree,\nmaking trouble for the paraphrasing of identity statements involving\nholes. But let us end the story here: enough has been said to\nillustrate how the method of paraphrase might used to avoid prima\nfacie ontological commitments.\nAvoiding ontological commitment, however, is not the only role that\nparaphrase plays in ontological disputes. The method of paraphrase has\nalso been used to bring hidden ontological commitments of ordinary\ndiscourse to the fore. One prominent example is Davidson's (1967)\nargument that action sentences are committed to an ontology of\nevents. For example, to explain the logical inference from \u201cJohn\nwalked slowly\u201d to \u201cJohn walked\u201d, we should treat the\nadverb \u2018slowly\u2019 as a description of an event over which\nthese sentences tacitly quantify. Paraphrases of action sentences into\nthe regimented portion of our language will thus be ontologically\ncommitted to events. A second well-known example is Lewis's argument\nfrom Counterfactuals that modal discourse, as he understands\nit, is committed to possible worlds: \n\nIt is uncontroversially true that things might be otherwise than\nthey are. \u2026 Ordinary language permits the paraphrase: there are\nmany ways things could have been besides the way they actually\nare. \u2026 I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe;\ntaking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the\nexistence of entities that might be called \u2018ways things could\nhave been\u2019. I prefer to call them \u2018possible worlds\u2019.\n(Lewis 1973: 84)\n\nIn both of these cases, a version of the method of paraphrase is\nused to support, rather than avoid, commitment to controversial\nontology.\nThe method of paraphrase provides a clear, well-defined\nstrategy\u2014some would say the only such\nstrategy[42]\u2014for\n determining the ontological\ncommitments of the two parties to an ontological dispute. But there\nhave been objections to the method, both early and late. Early on,\nAlston (1958) posed more or less the following dilemma (see also\nJackson 1980). Either the paraphrase and the sentence being\nparaphrased have the same truth conditions, or they do not. If they\ndo, then they cannot differ in their ontological commitments; for the\nrole of truth conditions, in part, is to specify what must exist in\norder for the sentence to be true. But then the method of paraphrase\ncannot be used to avoid ontological commitment. Suppose then that the\nparaphrase and the sentence being paraphrased do not have the same\ntruth conditions.  Then the paraphrase does nothing to support the\nclaim that the original sentence can be used without incurring\nontological commitment.  Indeed, whatever the precise relation\nbetween the paraphrase and the sentence being paraphrased, nothing\njustifies reading the ontological commitments of the original\nsentence off the paraphrase rather than the other way around (compare\nthe neo-Fregean account in \u00a75.2).\nThe best response on behalf of the defender of the method of\nparaphrase is to reject the assumption that the goal of paraphrase is\nto capture the truth conditions, or the ontological commitments, of\nthe original. For Quine, an acceptable paraphrase is just a sentence\nthat \u201cserves any purposes [of the original] that seem worth\nserving\u201d (Quine 1960: 214). A stronger notion of paraphrase is\nruled out because the truth conditions, and so the ontological\ncommitments, of sentences in ordinary language are, for the most\npart, semantically indeterminate. In applying the method of\nparaphrase, we ask the philosopher to make her ordinary language\ntheory precise through the process of regimentation, not to uncover\nthe hidden commitments of the original\ntheory.[43] If\nshe complies, then the ontological commitments of the regimented\ntheory can be attributed to her.  But there is no going back to\nassign ontological commitments to the original theory couched in\nordinary language.[44]\nMore recent critics of the method of paraphrase see the search for\nparaphrase as fundamentally misguided. Sider (1999), for example,\nsuggests that the project of discovering the ontological commitments\nof ordinary language should proceed by searching, not for paraphrases,\nbut for underlying truths (see also Melia 1995 and Yablo 1999\nfor related critiques). Suppose some sentence in ordinary language\nthat we use in describing the world is prima facie committed\nto Ks. Nonetheless, the attitude that we take to the sentence\nmay be something weaker than believing the sentence true. In that\ncase, our use of that sentence need not commit us to Ks, even\nif all acceptable paraphrases are committed to Ks. To get at\nour commitments, we should look, not to paraphrases, but to the truths\nthat underlie the descriptive role of the sentence; our commitment is\nthe commitment of those underlying truths. Roughly, we can say that\nthe underlying truths are true propositions that would still have been\ntrue and would have been sufficient for the truth of the original\nsentence, if there had been Ks (see Sider 1999:\n332\u20133). To illustrate with a simple example, consider the\nsentence: \u201cthe number of moons of Jupiter is sixty-seven\u201d.\nSuppose a philosopher uses this sentence to describe the world, but\ndoes not want to accept its prima facie commitment to\nnumbers. If, as seems plausible, the underlying truths for the\nsentence are just propositions stating what physical objects are in\nthe vicinity of Jupiter and what their motions are, then the sentence\nis ontologically committed only to those physical objects, not to\nnumbers. We may not know what these underlying truths are, or be able\nto express them in ordinary language. That matters not. For, unlike\nthe method of paraphrase, the philosopher is under no obligation to\nprovide the underlying truths in order to acquit herself of\nthe prima facie commitments. She can justify her use of\nsentences that are prima facie committed to numbers as long\nas she holds that there are underlying truths, and that the underlying\ntruths are not so committed.\n5. Frege and Neo-Fregeanism\n5.1 Frege \nAlthough explicit discussion of ontological commitment postdates\nFrege's writings, an account of ontological commitment can be garnered\nfrom his defense of arithmetical platonism in The Foundations of\nArithmetic (Frege 1884). That account is embedded in the\nfollowing argument for the claim that numbers exist as\n\u201cself-subsistent objects\u201d (see Wright (1990), who calls\nthe argument \u201cdeceptively simple\u201d). The semantic role of\nsingular terms (Frege's proper names) is to refer to\nobjects. When singular terms occur in true sentences of an appropriate\nkind\u00ad\u2014extensional sentences generally, and identity\nsentences in particular\u2014they cannot help but to refer; for that\nis their contribution to the truth of the sentence. Appropriate\nsentences involving numerical singular terms are sometimes true;\nwitness \u2018the number of planets is nine\u2019 and\n\u20181+1=2\u2019. Therefore, these singular terms refer to\nobjects. Moreover, the argument may be continued, since some of these\nsingular terms\u2014those of the form \u2018the number\nof Fs\u2019\u2014figure in the identity condition\ndefinitive of the concept of number (Hume's Principle, see below), the\nobjects referred to are properly called\n\u201cnumbers\u201d. Therefore, numbers exist.\nThis argument might be challenged in two different ways.  First,\none might deny that sentences containing numerical singular terms are\n(literally) true; one might, for example, endorse a fictionalist\naccount of mathematics (Field 1980). For our purposes, we can sidestep\nthis objection and focus on the other premise of the argument, that\nextensional sentences containing numerical singular terms, if true,\nrefer to numbers\u2014which is to say, in other words, that such\nsentences, whether true or not, are ontologically committed\nto numbers. If this is to serve as a criterion of ontological\ncommitment, there must be some purely syntactic way of\ndetermining which expressions are genuine singular terms; if genuine\nsingular terms are characterized semantically\u2014for\nexample, as expressions that refer to objects when they occur in true\nextensional sentences\u2014then the account of ontological commitment\ngoes in a circle. Thus, Fregean accounts are committed to\na syntactic priority thesis: ontology depends on ontological\ncommitment plus truth; and ontological commitment in turn depends on\nsyntax (see Wright 1983 for extended discussion).\nIn various scattered remarks, Frege appears to endorse the\nsyntactic priority thesis. For example, he writes (1884: \u00a757):\n\u201cwe say \u2018the [number] 1\u2019, and by means of the\ndefinite article, set up 1 as an object\u201d. And he notes that\nnumerals occur, not only attributively, for example, in \u2018Jupiter\nhas four moons\u2019, but also in identity statements, such as\n\u2018the number of Jupiter's moons is four\u2019; and the sense of\nsuch an identity statement is just that \u201cthe expression\n\u2018the number of Jupiter's moons\u2019 denotes the same object as\nthe word \u2018four\u2019\u201d. The difficulty of identifying the\nappropriate use of the definite article, or when \u2018is\u2019\nsignals a genuine identity statement, was, perhaps, not sufficiently\nappreciated by Frege. But recent work (especially Dummett (1973) and\nHale (1996)) has given some reason to think that genuine singular\nterms in English can be recognized syntactically in terms of their\ninferential role.\nSuppose that the task of providing syntactic criteria for\nidentifying genuine singular terms can be accomplished. Suppose,\nmoreover, that there are syntactic criteria for saying when a genuine\nsingular term purports to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nthe Fregean can put forth the following sufficient condition for\nontological commitment: \n\nFregean Account.  Suppose that t is a singular\nterm purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then, any\nextensional theory containing the term t is ontologically\ncommitted to Ks.\n\nNote that, unlike the criteria for ontological commitment\nconsidered heretofore, this is intended only as a sufficient\ncondition for ontological commitment. For one thing, just as Frege\ntook singular terms to be a vehicle for commitment\nto objects, he took incomplete expressions to be a vehicle of\ncommitment to concepts and (more\ngenerally) functions. Unlike Quine, Frege treated all\nmeaningful expressions on a par with respect to ontological\ncommitment. But even if we restrict our attention to ontological\ncommitment to objects, there is no reason to think that Frege's\ncriterion is necessary as well as sufficient. Frege could well have\nallowed existentially quantified sentences to be ontologically\ncommitted to objects, whether or not they were equivalent to\ndisjunctions of sentences containing singular terms.\nIn one important respect, Frege's approach to ontological\ncommitment is in agreement with Quine's. Both hold that the smallest\nunit of ontological commitment is the complete sentence.  For Frege,\nthis can be seen as an uncontroversial application of his\nfamous Context Principle: \u201cit is only in the context of\na proposition that words have any meaning\u201d (Frege 1884:\n\u00a762). It follows that attribution of ontological commitment to\npersons always goes by way of the theories (sentences) that they\naccept. This approach to ontological commitment is common to all\nmainstream views in contemporary analytic philosophy. It could be\ndenied, however, by a philosopher who holds that we stand in\nintentional relations, not only to propositions, but also to\nobjects. For such a philosopher, plausibly, a person is ontologically\ncommitted to the objects of her thought, and the kinds they exemplify,\nindependently of what propositions she takes to be true of those\nobjects, or even whether there are any such propositions.\nThe Fregean approach to ontological commitment differs from\northodox Quinean approaches most obviously in its emphasis on singular\nterms as opposed to quantifiers and variables. But this may reflect\nmore a difference in their accounts of singular terms than a\nsubstantial difference in their accounts of ontological commitment;\nboth approaches, after all, focus on the referential\napparatus of the language. Quine eliminated all singular\nterms prior to assessing ontological commitment: definite\ndescriptions were eliminated via Russell's theory of descriptions;\nnames were eliminated in favor of predicates satisfied by at most one\nthing.  This allowed Quine to sidestep issues arising from ostensibly\nempty names (see \u00a71.2 above). Frege, on\nthe other hand, took singular terms to be the locus of commitment to\nobjects. In Frege 1892, he writes: \u201cwhen we say \u2018the\nmoon\u2019 \u2026 we presuppose a reference\u201d. Singular terms,\nthen, are ontologically committing in this sense: they presuppose\nreference to objects. This applies no less to empty names that in fact\nfail to refer. Frege writes:\n\n anyone who seriously took the sentence\n[\u201cOdysseus \u2026\u201d] to be true or false would ascribe to\nthe name \u201cOdysseus\u201d a reference.\n\nThis has a couple of awkward consequences. For one, it follows that\ndenials of existence cannot be made with empty names: \u201cOdysseus\nnever existed\u201d is neither true nor false. But perhaps these\ndenials won't much be missed, since we can always say instead that the\nname \u2018Odysseus\u2019 doesn't refer. For another, sentences with\nfictional names are always ontologically committing. But, ultimately,\nit is the ontological commitment of persons that we care about, not\nsentences. A person may use a sentence containing a singular\nterm\u2014for example, an actor on the stage\u2014without inheriting\nthe sentence's ontological commitments. Only when a person judges the\nsentence to be true is she committed to an object as referent of the\nsingular term, and to the kinds of entity to which the object\nbelongs.\nAnother difference between Frege and Quine (but not all Quineans)\nis that Frege's account of ontological commitment applies directly to\nsentences of ordinary language. Quine's account applies only\nindirectly to sentences of ordinary language via the method of\nparaphrase, or, in what seems to be his \u201cofficial\u201d view,\nnot at all. This difference leads to different, and more onerous,\ndemands being placed on the Fregean. As already noted, the Fregean\nmust discover syntactic criteria for identifying genuine singular\nterms in ordinary language. Quine never engaged in the corresponding\nproject: finding syntactic criteria for identifying objectual\nquantifiers in ordinary language. As we saw\nin \u00a74.2, that task is none too easy, and\nthere is substantial disagreement even over basic\ncases. But, contra Quine, it is a task that must be carried\nout if quantifier approaches to ontological commitment are to have\nphilosophical application.  Philosophers, after all, do not often\nspeak or write in Quine's target language: first-order predicate\nlogic. Quinean approaches\u2014if they are to provide a\ntheory-neutral criterion of ontological commitment applicable to\nordinary language\u2014are no less beholden to the syntactic priority\nthesis than Fregean approaches.\n5.2 Neo-Fregeanism\nThus far, we have canvassed Frege's argument that, if sentences\ncontaining numerical singular terms are true, then those terms refer\nto numbers. The last step in the argument\u2014that the objects\nreferred to by numerical singular terms satisfy the sortal concept of\nnumber\u2014invoked the following identity criterion for numbers:\n\nHume's Principle. The number of Fs is identical\nwith the number of Gs if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the Fs and the Gs. \n\nFrege considered, but rejected, the idea that Hume's Principle, by\nitself, could be taken to define the concept of number. His rejection\nwas based on what has come to be known as the \u201cCaesar\nProblem\u201d: Hume's Principle allows one to decide whether the\nnumber of Fs is identical with q, when q is\ngiven in the form \u2018the number of Gs\u2019, but it\nfails to do so when q is not given in that form. Thus, Frege\n(1884: \u00a756) requires that we be able to\n\n decide by means of our definitions whether any\nconcept has the number Julius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that\nsame familiar conqueror of Gaul is a number or not.\n\n Frege thus opted instead to define numbers explicitly in terms of\nextensions: the number of Fs = the extension of the concept\n\u2018equal to the concept F\u2019 (where F is equal to\nG just in case the Fs are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the Gs). These explicit definitions arguably allow Frege\nto maintain the logicist thesis that arithmetic is logic: they define\nnumbers as logical objects in the sense that their existence\ncan be justified on the basis of (Frege's) logic alone. But, as is\nwell known, these explicit definitions foundered on the inconsistency\nof Frege's underlying theory of extensions, in particular, the na\u00efve\ncomprehension principle embodied in his Basic Law V.\nThe Neo-Fregean seeks to defend arithmetical platonism and\nlogicism by taking a different tack: Hume's Principle by itself is\ntaken to provide a contextual definition of numbers.  The viability of\nthis approach is secured by the result now called Frege's\nTheorem: Hume's Principle, when added to a suitable system of\nsecond-order logic, suffices for the proof of the basic laws of\narithmetic, Peano's axioms (see Wright 1983:\n158\u201369). Arithmetical logicism is secured if Hume's Principle\ncan be shown to be analytic in an appropriate sense. Arithmetical\nplatonism, with numbers as logical objects, is secured because, when\nlogical truths are substituted for the right-hand side of Hume's\nPrinciple, the resulting instance on the left-hand side is also\nlogically true, and explicitly refers to numbers.\nFor our purposes, the main interest of the Neo-Fregean approach is\nthat it leads to a conception of ontological commitment more liberal\nthan any yet considered. This conception arises from the\nNeo-Fregean's particular way of understanding Hume's\nPrinciple. First, since Hume's Principle is to define the\nconcept of number, the left- and right-hand sides of the principle\nmust at least have the same truth conditions.  Second, sentences with\nthe same truth conditions have the same ontological commitments. This\nsecond assumption amounts to a sense in which being supervenes on\ntruth: circumstances cannot differ with respect to what there is\nwithout differing with respect to what is true. It follows from these\ntwo assumptions that the left- and right-hand sides of Hume's\nPrinciple have the same ontological commitments. But that still\nleaves open three different ways that Hume's Principle can be viewed\n(Wright 1990). First, one might reject it on the grounds\nthat the left- and right-hand sides clearly do not have the same\nontological commitments: the numerical identity on the left-hand side\nis committed to numbers; the claim that two concepts are equal on the\nright-hand side is not. On this view, only a conditionalized version\nof Hume's Principle could be accepted: \u201cif there are numbers,\nthen \u2026\u201d (Field 1984). In response, the neo-Fregean can\nsay that this confuses \u201chaving the same truth conditions\u201d\nwith some more fine-grained equivalence such as \u201cexpressing the\nsame thought\u201d. Only the latter requires that both sides refer\nto the same objects, where reference is a kind of explicit\nontological commitment.[45]\nA second response takes Hume's Principle to provide\nan ontological reduction of numbers to concepts, and\nrelations between concepts. On this view, Hume's Principle is true,\nbut ontological commitments should be read off of the right-hand\nside. Since the right-hand side, it is supposed, is not ontologically\ncommitted to numbers, the left-hand side\u2014being\ntruth-conditionally equivalent\u2014cannot be ontologically committed\nto numbers either; surface grammar is deceptive here. This response is\nin line with the standard Quinean approach to paraphrase as a means of\neliminating ontological commitment.  But, as noted\nin \u00a74.2, it is unclear what justifies\nthe asymmetric attitude with respect to commitment. Granted, there is\nno explicit ontological commitment to numbers by the\nright-hand side; but once one allows that ontological commitment can\nbe implicit, it is unclear why one cannot say that it is the surface\ngrammar of the right-hand side that is deceptive with respect\nto ontological commitment.\nThe third response, that of the Neo-Fregean, is to say that\nontological commitments should be read off of the left-hand side, and\nthat therefore both sides are ontologically committed to numbers.\nThis is no idle preference. It is backed up by the Fregean argument\nconsidered above that the left-hand side is ontologically committed to\nnumbers in virtue of containing numerical singular terms. The symmetry\nis broken.\nThe neo-Fregean thus endorses a sufficient condition for\nontological commitment much weaker than the Fregean account:\n\nNeo-Fregean Account.  Suppose that t is a\nsingular term purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nany theory truth-conditionally equivalent to a theory containing the\nterm t is ontologically committed\nto Ks.\n\nTo illustrate: \u201cthere are exactly as many forks as\nknives\u201d is ontologically committed to numbers because it is\ntruth-conditionally equivalent to \u201cthe number of forks is\nidentical with the number of knives\u201d, which contains a singular\nterm \u2018the number of forks\u2019 which purports to refer to\nnumbers.\nThe liberality of the neo-Fregean account of ontological commitment\nis best appreciated by considering its application to abstraction\nprinciples for which, unlike Hume's Principle, the right-hand side\nappears to be entirely about concrete entities, and so appears to be\nacceptable to a nominalist. For example, consider the abstraction\nprinciple for directions: the direction of line a is\nidentical to the direction of line b if and only\nif a is parallel to b (where a\nand b are concrete). According to the neo-Fregean account,\nthe claim that concrete lines a and b are parallel\nis committed, by itself, to abstract objects,\ndirections.[46]\nMoreover, it has this commitment whether or not any mind ever grasps\nthe concept of direction, or formulates the corresponding abstraction\nprinciple. In general, commitments to abstracta are\nconcomitant with certain commitments to concreta, and\ninseparable from them, regardless of our ways of\nconceptualizing.[47]\n6. Carnap and Neo-Carnapianism\n6.1 Carnap\nCarnap was a deflationist about traditional ontological disputes,\nsuch as whether numbers exist, or physical objects exist. He held that\nexistence questions could be interpreted in two different ways,\ninternally or externally. When interpreted internally, the question\nwas to be answered relative to a linguistic framework.  If the\nframework was mathematical, existence questions, such as whether there\nare prime numbers greater than 1000, were to be answered by means of\nproof, given the axioms and rules of logic introduced by the\nframework. If the framework was empirical, existence questions, such\nas whether electrons exist, were to be answered through observation\naccording to the rules of confirmation and disconfirmation introduced\nby the framework. When the existence questions involved the most\ngeneral kinds introduced by the framework, the answers were\ntrivial. In the framework of numbers, it is trivial that numbers\nexist; in the framework of physical objects, it is trivial that\nphysical objects exist. For it is stipulated in introducing these\nframeworks that the variables range over numbers, or physical\nobjects.\nWhen existence questions are interpreted externally, they purport\nto be about \u201creality\u201d independent of any particular\nlinguistic framework. So interpreted, according to Carnap, these\nquestions\u2014such as \u201cdo numbers exist?\u201d or \u201cdo\nphysical objects exist?\u201d\u2014are pseudo-questions lacking any\ncognitive meaning. Since metaphysicians engaging in ontological\ndisputes over these questions evidently have the external\ninterpretation in mind\u2014they do not take them to be\ntrivial\u2014much of traditional metaphysics for Carnap was\ncognitively meaningless as well. The best one can do to make sense of\nexternal existence questions is to re-construe them as pragmatic\nquestions as to which frameworks to accept. The question, \u201cdo\nnumbers exist\u201d, for example, could be re-construed as the\nquestion, \u201cis it useful to introduce the number\nframework\u201d. A framework could be deemed useful, for example, if\nit facilitated factual communication in ways that were\n\u201cefficient, fruitful, and simple\u201d (Carnap 1950).\nOne might wonder whether it is coherent to interpret all meaningful\nexistence questions as internal: don't we need the concept of\nexistence to introduce and meaningfully discuss the frameworks\nthemselves, and their pragmatic virtues? Can it be frameworks\n\u201call the way down\u201d? But, for purposes of this article, it\nsuffices to ask how the notion of ontological commitment fits in to\nCarnap's scheme. One might expect Carnap to tie talk of ontological\ncommitment to external questions, and reject it accordingly: if it is\ncognitively meaningless to say that Ks exist in\nreality, then it is cognitively meaningless to say that a theory\npresupposes or assumes that Ks exist in reality.  But that\nis not what Carnap did. Rather, he endorsed Quine's quantifier\naccount of ontological commitment, applying it internally; his only\nreservation had to do with Quine's use of the word\n\u2018ontological\u2019.[48] \nFor Carnap, a theory always comes\npackaged with a linguistic framework for interpreting the theory. To\nsay that a theory is ontologically committed to Ks, then, is\njust to say that according to the rules of the framework-cum-theory,\nit is true that Ks exist. A philosopher can be said to\n\u201caccept a kind of entities\u201d when he introduces a\nlinguistic framework that, first, introduces a general term satisfied\nby all and only entities of that kind and, second, introduces\nvariables to range over all and only those entities (see Carnap 1950:\n213).\nHow do Carnap's views relate to Quine's? First, it might well be\nasked, which of the quantifier accounts canvassed above is Carnap\nendorsing when he claims to be in agreement with Quine?  Since Carnap\nclearly allows a philosopher who has not accepted (for\npragmatic reasons) some kind of entity to attribute acceptance of that\nkind to another philosopher, Carnap's view would appear to be closest\nto the metalinguistic version of Quine's quantifier account. We are\nmaking claims about linguistic frameworks, and what follows from the\nrules of those frameworks; and these claims, at least for Carnap, do\nnot make problematic assertions about \u201creality\u201d. Second, a\nconsequence of Carnap's view is that theories with different\nontological commitments should not be thought of as conflicting. This\ncontrasts sharply with Quine. Because Quine has a single, all-purpose\nlogico-linguistic framework\u2014austere first-order predicate\nlogic\u2014within which all theories are couched for purposes of\nexamining their ontological commitments, theories with differing\nexistential presuppositions genuinely conflict; a philosopher must\nchoose which theory to accept. For Carnap, theories with differing\nontological commitments are ipso facto couched within\ndifferent linguistic frameworks. If there is disagreement, it can only\nbe over the relative pragmatic virtues of the frameworks in\nquestion. In this way, Carnap's deflationary approach to ontology\ncarries with it a deflationary approach to ontological\ncommitment. Carnap is a pluralist; a philosopher can choose\nto accept multiple theories, with differing ontological commitments,\nwithout pain of contradiction. Let many flowers bloom (see Carnap\n1950: 221).\n6.2 Neo-Carnapianism: Quantifier Variance\nAccording to Carnap, each linguistic framework comes with its own\nunrestricted existential quantifier, and thus its own notions of\nobject and existence. No one of these quantifiers is logically or\nmetaphysically privileged over any of the others; there is no neutral\nstandpoint from which one framework can be judged correct and another\nincorrect. When frameworks appear to disagree\u2014as when one says\nthat arbitrary fusions exist, and another denies it\u2014the dispute\nis merely verbal; they are using quantifiers with different\nmeanings. This is a form of the doctrine of quantifier\nvariance. One might well wonder: don't we get a single,\nprivileged quantifier by combining all linguistic frameworks, and\nconsidering a quantifier that ranges over the union of all the domains\nof these frameworks? But the question presupposes, in effect, that the\nnotion of \u201call linguistic frameworks\u201d is meaningful, and\nthere is no reason why Carnap would accept that. Any attempt to\nintroduce a single all-inclusive quantifier that ranges over\nabsolutely everything would be rejected by Carnap. For what does\neverything mean here, if not \u201ceverything in reality?\nAnd that, for Carnap, is cognitively meaningless.\nEli Hirsch (2002) is a neo-Carnapian proponent of the doctrine of\nquantifier variance, but he differs from Carnap in at least two\nrespects (see also Putnam 1987). First, Hirsch applies the doctrine of\nquantifier variance not just to the quantifiers in artificial\nlanguages, as was Carnap's way, but to ordinary language\nquantifiers. Instead of Carnap's many linguistic frameworks, we have\nmany possible languages including English and (Hirsch would say) the\nsomewhat bizarre variations on English spoken by some contemporary\nmetaphysicians. For example, Lewish, the language spoken by\nmereologists (and named after its defender, David Lewis) quantifies\nover arbitrary fusions, whereas English, Hirsch claims, does\nnot. Second, Hirsch's brand of quantifier variance is meant to be\ncompatible with realism, that there is a single reality in virtue of\nwhich our theories, with their various quantifiers, are made true or\nfalse. This reality cannot, in and of itself, be ontologically\nstructured; it cannot have a metaphysically privileged division into\nobjects, lest one quantifier be privileged over the others. Reality\nconsists rather of unstructured facts that we carve up differently\nwith our different quantifiers.\nHirsch's realism contrasts sharply with Carnap's anti-realism. For\nCarnap, different linguistic frameworks are incommensurable. They\npeacefully coexist, logically isolated from one another. Apparent\nontological disputes are meaningless for lack of a common subject\nmatter, a single \u201creality\u201d that is being disputed. For\nHirsch, on the other hand, each side in an ontological dispute is\nspeaking truly of the one and only reality. The appearance of a\ngenuine dispute arises because they are speaking different languages\nwhose quantifiers have different meanings. Each side of the dispute\ncan translate the others claims into his own language to see that both\nare speaking truly, and that the dispute is merely verbal. The\ndisagreement is over the meaning of words, not the nature of\nreality.\nThis claim of intertranslatability is difficult to maintain (see\nHawthorne 2009). But suppose it can be made good: what would that say\nabout ontological commitment? Since theories that assert \u201cthere\nare Ks\u201d and theories that assert \u201cthere are\nno Ks\u201d need not conflict, one cannot simply look to the\nquantifiers for ontological commitment. Moreover, since no language,\nand no quantifier, is ontologically privileged, it would not help to\nfirst translate into a single language. We could relativize the notion\nof ontological commitment to languages; but given that reality itself,\nfor Hirsch, isn't ontologically structured, none of these relativized\nnotions of ontological commitment would be getting at something of\nontological significance (including the one that gave ontological\ncommitment relative to ordinary language, and ordinary language\nquantifiers). All theories, it appears, are ontologically committed to\nthe single reality, and the unstructured facts that comprise it; but\nthat commitment does not come from quantification. Where it comes from\nis not addressed.",
