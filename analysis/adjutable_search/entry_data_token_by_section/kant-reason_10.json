Unfortunately, neither edition of\nthe Critique considers what this principle might be.\n\nKant also raises this principle in his works on practical reason,\nwithout giving a clear account. In the Preface to the\nGroundwork, Kant explains why the book is not entitled a\nCritique of Pure Practical Reason:\n\n[A critique of pure practical reason] is not of such utmost necessity\nas [a critique of pure theoretical reason], since human reason, even\nin the commonest understanding, can easily be brought to a high\nmeasure of correctness and accuracy in moral matters, whereas in its\ntheoretical but pure use it is totally and entirely dialectical [i.e.,\na source of illusion]\u2026 I require that the critique of a pure\npractical reason, if it is to be complete, also be able to present its\nunity with speculative reason in a common principle; because in the\nend there can be only one and the same reason, which must differ\nmerely in its application. (4:391)\n\n\nIn the second Critique, Kant compares the book\u2019s\nstructure with the first Critique and comments: \u201csuch\ncomparisons [are] gratifying; for they rightly occasion the\nexpectation of being able some day to attain insight into the unity of\nthe whole rational faculty (theoretical as well as practical) and to\nderive everything from one principle\u2014the undeniable need of\nhuman reason, which finds complete satisfaction only in a complete\nsystematic unity of its cognitions\u201d (5:91). Kant\u2019s tone is\nconfident. But once again, he has postponed an account of \u201cthe\nunity of the whole rational faculty.\u201d (Prauss 1981 argues that\nKant failed to achieve this insight, in part because he did not\nappreciate how cognitive success is a fundamentally practical goal.\nF\u00f6rster 1992 discusses Kant\u2019s reflections on this topic in\nhis final manuscript, the Opus Postumum.)\n\nHowever, as Onora O\u2019Neill points out in a celebrated essay\n(1989: Ch. 1), Kant\u2019s claims about practical reason imply a\nfurther claim about reason\u2019s \u201ccommon principle.\u201d\nKant has argued that the Categorical Imperative is the supreme\nprinciple of practical reason. He has also argued that practical\nreason has primacy over theoretical reason. It follows, therefore,\nthat the Categorical Imperative is the supreme principle of\nreason.\n\nTo be sure, Kant never states this conclusion explicitly. But there\nare reasons for thinking that this ought to have been his view, and in\nsome places he comes very close to this\n claim.[28]\n\nThe clearest passage is a footnote (!) in Kant\u2019s essay,\n\u201cWhat is it to Orient Oneself in Thinking?\u201d (1786):\n\nTo make use of one\u2019s own reason means no more than to ask\noneself, whenever one is supposed to assume something, whether one\ncould find it feasible to make the ground or the rule on which one\nassumes it into a universal principle for the use of reason. (8:146n)\n\n\nThis bears an obvious parallel with the first formulation of the\nCategorical Imperative\u2014\u201cact only according to that maxim\nthrough which you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw\u201d (4:421). Kant now says: think only in accordance\nwith that maxim that could be a universal\n law.[29]\n\nTo rephrase the point: Thinking and judging are activities. If the\nCategorical Imperative is truly \u201ccategorical\u201d then it\napplies to all our activities\u2014\u201ctheoretical\u201d\nas well as \u201cpractical.\u201d\n\nOther strands of Kant\u2019s thought support this interpretation. The\nmost important are his \u201cmaxims of reason\u201d and his account\nof the \u201cpublic use of reason.\u201d\n",
