    "main_text": "Further Developments || The Return of Normativity to Hermeneutics\n8.3 The Return of Normativity to Hermeneutics\n\nRecent research in hermeneutics has seen a rise of interest in the\nrole played in interpretive experience by a number of normative\nmatters. In this, some argue that the influence of Heidegger and\nGadamer over contemporary hermeneutics has led to a neglect of\nnormative considerations in current debate. To be sure, it is possible\nto defend Heidegger and Gadamer against the charge that their\napproaches leave too little room for normative considerations. When it\ncomes to Heidegger, Steven Crowell, for example, argues that\nphenomenology as conceived by Husserl and Heidegger can itself be\ngrasped as inquiry into a \u201cnormatively structured \u2018space\nof meaning\u2019\u201d (Crowell 2016, 238). Crowell, in his\nconsideration of Heidegger, focuses on Heidegger\u2019s analysis of\nhuman existence, arguing that Heidegger\u2019s view of the role\nplayed by care in human existence speaks to the possibility of being\nresponsive to norms as such (Crowell 2013). When it comes to Gadamer,\nattempts to defend his philosophical hermeneutics against charges that\nit neglects normative concerns have played an important role in debate\nsince Habermas first raised objections against Gadamer.\n\nRecent interest in the role played in interpretive experience by\nnormative considerations, though, has also led to a revival of\ninterest in these matters in hermeneutics before Heidegger. Kristin\nGjesdal, in her recent Gadamer and the Legacy of German\nIdealism, for example, recommends that we return to\nSchleiermacher in order to focus attention on\n\u201ccritical-normative standards in interpretation\u201d (Gjesdal\n2009, 7). Rudolf Makkreel, in his recent Orientation and Judgment\nin Hermeneutics, argues for the priority of judgment, and with\nit, reflection and criticism, in interpretive experience. Really,\nMakkreel\u2019s project is to develop an original position or\napproach within hermeneutics in its own right, one that takes up\nhermeneutical considerations in our contemporary, multi-cultural\ncontext, and that relies on a broad range of philosophers associated\nwith hermeneutics. But, he develops his view of judgment, and the\nnormative considerations involved in it, in reference to Kant and\nDilthey in particular.\n",
