    "main_text": "Epicurus and the Harm Thesis || The Deprivationist Defense\n3.2 The Deprivationist Defense\n\nTo argue that death may be bad for those who die (even if they do not\nexperience dying), theorists typically draw upon some version of the\ncomparativist view that we are harmed by what makes our lives\nas wholes worse than they otherwise would be, and benefitted by what\nmakes our lives as wholes better than they otherwise would be (early\nproponents of this view include Nagel 1970, Quinn 1984, and Feldman\n1991). Applying comparativism, we may claim that, in at least some\ncases, dying at a time makes our lives as wholes worse than they would\nhave been had we not died when we did, roughly because, by cutting our\nlives short, it deprives us of good life. This suggestion about death\nneeds further development, but first let us explain the comparativist\nview more clearly.\n\nNote that how well off you are at one time is likely to differ from\nhow well off you are at another time. Your welfare level rises and\nfalls over time. (For a discussion of welfare, see the article on\nWell-Being.) What determines how well off you are at a time, or during\nan interval of time, are the things you then accrue that are\nintrinsically good for you, goods such as pleasure, together with the\nthings you then accrue that are intrinsically bad for you, evils such\nas pain (using the term \u2018evil\u2019 as a synonym for\n\u2018bad\u2019). Accruing the former at a time boosts your welfare\nlevel during that time, other things being equal, while accruing the\nlatter lowers your welfare level during that time. Your welfare level\nduring an interval of time will be positive if the goods you then\naccrue outweigh the evils. It will be 0\u2014neither positive nor\nnegative\u2014if and only if you are capable of accruing goods or\nevils (unlike, say, a shoe, which is incapable of faring well or ill)\nbut the goods you accrue are exactly offset by the evils and vice\nversa. The welfare level resulting from the goods and evils you accrue\nover the course of your life we may call your lifetime welfare\nlevel.\n\nUsing the notion of a lifetime welfare level, let us formulate an\naccount of what it is for something to be extrinsically good or bad\nfor us. Let us say that something is extrinsically good (bad) for us\nif and only if, and to the extent that, it is overall good (bad) for\nus simpliciter, where:\n\nan event is overall good (bad) for us simpliciter if\nand only if, and to the extent that, it makes our lifetime welfare\nlevel higher (lower) than it otherwise would be.\n\n(Why add the term \u2018simpliciter\u2019? Read on.) By way of\nillustration, consider a typical case in which you receive treatment\nby a dentist. Let us assume that, on this particular occasion, the\ndentist fills a cavity in one of your teeth, and that, had you not\nreceived this treatment, your tooth would have decayed, painfully, for\nmonths, until finally you would have sought out proper treatment. So\nthe salient difference between your lifetime welfare level in the\nsituation in which you are treated right away, on one hand, and the\nlifetime welfare level you would have in the case that you were not\ntreated until much later, on the other, is that, in the latter\nsituation, that level is significantly lower, due to the pain you\nwould incur. Hence, on these assumptions, receiving treatment was\noverall good for you: the greater that pain would have been, the\nbetter for you it was that you were treated.\n\nNote that things that are overall good for you may be a mixed\nbag\u2014they may bring some pain or other intrinsic evils in their\nwakes, as well as some intrinsic goods, and the mix may differ from\ntime to time. In some cases, what is overall good for you\nsimpliciter is overall bad for you in a temporally relative\nsense\u2014overall bad for you during some period of time.\nAnd although it is overall bad for you during one period of time, it\nmight be overall good for you during some other period of time. Let us\nelaborate upon this point briefly. Comparativists can say that:\n\nan event is overall good (bad) for us at some time t\nif and only if, and to the extent that, it makes our lifetime welfare\nlevel higher (lower) at t than it otherwise would be.\n\nSuppose, for example, that, while your tooth\u2019s cavity is being\nfilled, the dentist\u2019s drill causes you pain, and that this is\npain you would not have had if you had not sought treatment, and\ninstead watched TV. In that case, your visit to the dentist is overall\nbad for you during the time your tooth is being repaired.\nYet, as emerged earlier, your visit to the dentist is overall good for\nyou simpliciter, insofar as it enables you to reduce the\nepisodes of toothache you would suffer over the course of your\nlife.\n\nComparativists can accept intrinsic hedonism, but need not. They\ncould, for example, pair comparativism with some version of the\npreferentialist view (mentioned earlier) that getting what we\nwant\u2014fulfilling one of our desires\u2014is intrinsically good\nfor us, and having our desires thwarted is intrinsically bad for us.\nComparativism is neutral on the issue of what counts as the intrinsic\ngoods and evils. Theorists who conclude that things other than\npleasure are intrinsically good for us will want to weigh them in when\nthey assess an individual\u2019s welfare level. For example,\npreferentialists can say that even if accruing pleasure boosts a\nperson\u2019s welfare level so does desire fulfillment.\n\nAccording to comparativism, a person\u2019s death, whether painful or\nnot, may well be overall bad for her (and hence extrinsically bad for\nher). To decide whether a person\u2019s death is overall bad for her\nsimpliciter (usually we can drop \u2018simpliciter\u2019\nwithout creating confusion) we compare her actual lifetime welfare\nlevel to the lifetime welfare level she would have had if she had not\ndied. Suppose, for example, that Hilda died (painlessly) on December\n1, 2008 at age 25 and that, had she not died, she would have gone on\nto prosper for 25 years\u2014her welfare level during that time would\nhave been high\u2014then suffer during her final five years. Her\noverall welfare level over her final 30 years would have been high,\ndespite the downturn during the last five. Hence her lifetime welfare\nlevel had she not died at age 25 is significantly higher than her\nlifetime welfare level would be upon dying at 25. The former is\nboosted by the many goods she accrues during her final 30 years, and\nthese goods are absent from her lifetime welfare level as it would be\nwere her life ended at age 25. Hence dying at 25 is overall bad for\nher.\n\nImportantly, dying at a time is not overall bad for everyone who dies.\nIn fact, it will be overall good in many cases. Imagine that, had she\nnot died at age 25, Hilda would have fared badly for 25\nyears\u2014her welfare level during that time would have been low. We\nmight also suppose that, during her last five years her welfare level\nwould have been positive. Despite this last stipulation concerning her\nfinal five years, her lifetime welfare level had she not died at 25 is\nsignificantly lower than her lifetime welfare level would be if she\ndid die at 25, so, on our new assumptions, dying at 25 is overall good\nfor her.\n\nAccording to comparativism, when a death is bad for us despite not\nmaking us accrue intrinsic evils such as pain, it is bad for us\nbecause it precludes our coming to have various intrinsic goods which\nwe would have had if we had not died. We might say that death is bad\nfor us because of the goods it deprives us of, and not, or at least\nnot always, because of any intrinsic evils for which it is\nresponsible. This stance is sometimes called deprivationism,\nand its proponents deprivationists.\n\nAs promising as it is, however, there may be grounds for doubting that\ncomparativists can give the harm thesis a deprivationist defense. Let\nus discuss one such doubt next.\n",
