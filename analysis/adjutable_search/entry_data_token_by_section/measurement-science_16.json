On the historical side, the development of theory and\nmeasurement proceeds through iterative and mutual refinements. On the\nconceptual side, the specification of measurement procedures shapes\nthe empirical content of theoretical concepts, while theory provides a\nsystematic interpretation for the indications of measuring\ninstruments. This interdependence of measurement and theory may seem\nlike a threat to the evidential role that measurement is supposed to\nplay in the scientific enterprise. After all, measurement outcomes are\nthought to be able to test theoretical hypotheses, and this seems to\nrequire some degree of independence of measurement from theory. This\nthreat is especially clear when the theoretical hypothesis being\ntested is already presupposed as part of the model of the measuring\ninstrument. To cite an example from Franklin et al. (1989: 230): \n\n\nThere would seem to be, at first glance, a vicious circularity if one\nwere to use a mercury thermometer to measure the temperature of\nobjects as part of an experiment to test whether or not objects expand\nas their temperature increases. \n\n\nNonetheless, Franklin et al. conclude that the circularity is not\nvicious. The mercury thermometer could be calibrated against another\nthermometer whose principle of operation does not presuppose the law\nof thermal expansion, such as a constant-volume gas thermometer,\nthereby establishing the reliability of the mercury thermometer on\nindependent grounds. To put the point more generally, in the context\nof local hypothesis-testing the threat of circularity can usually be\navoided by appealing to other kinds of instruments and other parts of\ntheory.\n\nA different sort of worry about the evidential function of measurement\narises on the global scale, when the testing of entire theories is\nconcerned. As Thomas Kuhn (1961) argues, scientific theories are\nusually accepted long before quantitative methods for testing them\nbecome available. The reliability of newly introduced measurement\nmethods is typically tested against the predictions of the theory\nrather than the other way around. In Kuhn\u2019s words, \u201cThe\nroad from scientific law to scientific measurement can rarely be\ntraveled in the reverse direction\u201d (1961: 189). For example,\nDalton\u2019s Law, which states that the weights of elements in a\nchemical compound are related to each other in whole-number\nproportions, initially conflicted with some of the best known\nmeasurements of such proportions. It is only by assuming\nDalton\u2019s Law that subsequent experimental chemists were able to\ncorrect and improve their measurement techniques (1961: 173). Hence,\nKuhn argues, the function of measurement in the physical sciences is\nnot to test the theory but to apply it with increasing scope and\nprecision, and eventually to allow persistent anomalies to surface\nthat would precipitate the next crisis and scientific revolution. Note\nthat Kuhn is not claiming that measurement has no evidential role to\nplay in science. Instead, he argues that measurements cannot test a\ntheory in isolation, but only by comparison to some alternative theory\nthat is proposed in an attempt to account for the anomalies revealed\nby increasingly precise measurements (for an illuminating discussion\nof Kuhn\u2019s thesis see Hacking 1983: 243\u20135).\n\nTraditional discussions of theory-ladenness, like those of Kuhn, were\nconducted against the background of the logical positivists\u2019\ndistinction between theoretical and observational language. The\ntheory-ladenness of measurement was correctly perceived as a threat to\nthe possibility of a clear demarcation between the two languages.\nContemporary discussions, by contrast, no longer present\ntheory-ladenness as an epistemological threat but take for granted\nthat some level of theory-ladenness is a prerequisite for measurements\nto have any evidential power. Without some minimal substantive\nassumptions about the quantity being measured, such as its amenability\nto manipulation and its relations to other quantities, it would be\nimpossible to interpret the indications of measuring instruments and\nhence impossible to ascertain the evidential relevance of those\nindications. This point was already made by Pierre Duhem (1906:\n153\u20136; see also Carrier 1994: 9\u201319). Moreover,\ncontemporary authors emphasize that theoretical assumptions play\ncrucial roles in correcting for measurement errors and evaluating\nmeasurement uncertainties. Indeed, physical measurement procedures\nbecome more accurate when the model underlying them is\nde-idealized, a process which involves increasing the theoretical\nrichness of the model (Tal 2011).\n\nThe acknowledgment that theory is crucial for guaranteeing the\nevidential reliability of measurement draws attention to the\n\u201cproblem of observational grounding\u201d, which is an inverse\nchallenge to the traditional threat of theory-ladenness (Tal 2016b).\nThe challenge is to specify what role observation plays in\nmeasurement, and particularly what sort of connection with observation\nis necessary and/or sufficient to allow measurement to play an\nevidential role in the sciences. This problem is especially clear when\none attempts to account for the increasing use of computational\nmethods for performing tasks that were traditionally accomplished by\nmeasuring instruments. As Margaret Morrison (2009) and Wendy Parker\n(2017) argue, there are cases where reliable quantitative information\nis gathered about a target system with the aid of a computer\nsimulation, but in a manner that satisfies some of the central\ndesiderata for measurement such as being empirically grounded and\nbackward-looking (see also Lusk 2016). Such information does not rely\non signals transmitted from the particular object of interest to the\ninstrument, but on the use of theoretical and statistical models to\nprocess empirical data about related objects. For example, data\nassimilation methods are customarily used to estimate past atmospheric\ntemperatures in regions where thermometer readings are not available.\nSome methods do this by fitting a computational model of the\natmosphere\u2019s behavior to a combination of available data from\nnearby regions and a model-based forecast of conditions at the time of\nobservation (Parker 2017). These estimations are then used in various\nways, including as data for evaluating forward-looking climate models.\nRegardless of whether one calls these estimations\n\u201cmeasurements\u201d, they challenge the idea that producing\nreliable quantitative evidence about the state of an object requires\nobserving that object, however loosely one understands the term\n \u201cobservation\u201d.[23]\n",
