Despite the difficulties described above about definitions,\nhundreds of scientists, philosophers, and others have tried their hand\nat defining life. Much of the interest is motivated by new science and\nnew technologies \u2013 including artificial life, synthetic biology,\norigins of life, and astrobiology \u2013 which complicate the issue\nby violating some of the traditional groupings of properties\nassociated with life. There are numerous books, articles, and\nworkshops on the nature of life (P\u00e1lyi et al. 2002, Popa 2004,\nBedau & Cleland 2010).\n\n\n\n\nPopa\u00a02004\nTrifonov\u00a02011\nMalaterre\u00a0& Chartier\u00a02019\n\nMatter & Energy\n\nMechanistic: pragmatic interpretations that see life\nas a complex machine, including thermodynamic approaches\nEnergy: relating to terms like force\n\n\nMaterial-Related: those based on biochemistry and other\nfeature of life on Earth\nMatter: relating to terms like\norganic, material, and molecules\n1.\u00a0Matter/Energy, including the categories:\n\n\nHolistic Definitions: function- and purpose-related\ndescriptions that treat life as a collective property\nSystem: relating to terms: systems,\norganization, organism, order, network, etc.\n1a. Metabolism: including digestion,\nfermentation, digestion, and thermodynamics\n\n\nChemical: relating to terms: process,\nmetabolism, reactions, etc.\n1b. Catalysis and Synthesis of Proteins:\nincluding everything from monomers to macromolecules\nStructure\n\nReductionist: definitions which focus on underlying\nstructures common to life\n\n2. Structural, including the single subcategory:\n\n\nCellularist: views of life that take single cells\nto be the relevant origin and, hence central feature of life\n\n2a. Cellular/Structural Features: including cell\ndivision, stressors, and transporters\nEnvironment\n\n\nEnvironment: relating to terms: external,\netc.\n3. Environmental Interactions, a broad category that\nincluded:\n\n\n\n3a. Micro/Macro Environment: including all sorts of\nmutualisms and properties for interacting with other creatures\n\n\n\n3b. Plant/animals related: including those \nintersecting with human society: ticks, farming, spillover diseases,\netc.\n\n\n\n\n3c. Human related: including phenomena that\nresemble human physiology or produces immune responses, primarily in\nhumans\nEvolution\n\n\nEvolution: relating to terms: evolve,\nchange, mutation, etc.\n4. Evolution, including the single subcategory:\n\n\n\n4a. Evolvability: including most features of\nheredity and evolution, such as variation, adaptation, and\nspeciation\nInformation\n\nMinimalist: approaches that use the least amount of\ninformation to demarcate life from non-life\nComplexity: relating to terms:\ncomplex, information, etc.\n5. Information, including the single subcategory:\n\nGenetic: views of life that take replication and\nvariability to be the origin and key feature of life\nReproduction: relating to terms:\nreproduce, replication, etc.\n5a. Genetics: including all genetic\nmaterial, transcription and translation, and subsequent epigenetic\nmodification\nMiscellaneous\n\nCybernetic: approaches to life that abstract in\nsuch a way as to incorporate computer-based artificial life\nAbility: relating to terms:ability,\ncapacity, etc.\n\n\nGeneralist: approaches that are broad,\nobscurantist, or otherwise purposefully vague\n\n\n\nVitalist: definitions that take life to be an\nas-yet mysterious force, organization of matter, or other\nphenomenon\n\n\n\nParametric: definitions that identify one or more\nrelevant features of life\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Some recent attempts at meta-categories\nfor life definitions. Each column is one account\u2019s categories,\nthe rows are lined up according to rough similarity.\n\n There are perhaps thousands of competing definitions proposed\nacross hundreds of articles. A true survey of that variety would be\nbeyond the scope of this article and beyond your patience as a reader.\nNevertheless, some broad categories have been proposed that might\noffer some insight into current contending definitions. Table 1\nsummarizes three of the most rigorous attempts this century to\ncategorize definitions of life.\n\nEach of these authors used different approaches to arrive at their\ncategories. Popa 2004 and Trifonov 2011 attempted to reverse engineer\nthe categories from dozens of definitions collected from many dozens of\nexperts, while Malaterre and Chartier 2019 conducted a more extensive,\ntext-mining approach across 30,000 scientific articles selected from\njournals that published pieces in biology. As one can see, there are\nareas of rough overlap, but each categorization scheme has its own\nunique categories as well.\nMost of the definitions considered by these authors straddle some of\nthese distinctions and are often ambiguous as to whether they are\nintended to be theoretical definitions, operational definitions, or\nsomething else. For example, Popa 2004 considers definitions ranging\nfrom Oparin 1961\u2019s \u201cAny system capable of replication and\nmutation is alive\u201d to Schulze-Makuch et al. 2002:\n\nWe propose to define living systems as those that are: (1)\ncomposed of bounded micro-environments in thermodynamic equilibrium\nwith their surroundings; (2) capable of transforming energy to maintain\ntheir low-entropy states; and (3) able to replicate structurally\ndistinct copies of themselves from an instructional code perpetuated\nindefinitely through time despite the demise of the individual carrier\nthrough which it is transmitted. \nCategorizing definitions such as these\nnecessarily requires some choices and reasonable people can disagree\nabout whether each belongs in one or more categories.\nThe takeaway from current understandings of the definition of life\nis that there is no consensus forthcoming in the near future. One concern is that these are summaries of attempts to define a category for which there is only loose agreement.\nMany scientists disagree as to the phenomena a definition of life is\nintended to unify. Some scientists would include prions, viruses, and\nentities only hypothesized to exist in the origin of life, while others\nwould completely reject them. Some might accept digital organisms as\nalive, others would deny this approach. Conceptual equivocation could\nhave significant costs for research. One field recently quantified this\ncost, suggesting it is more than a merely theoretical concern (Trombley\nand Cottenie 2019). Given the diversity described above, one may be\ntempted to adopt a definitional pluralism: there are many ways to be\nalive. For some reason, that approach is not common in the\nliterature.\n",
