The History and Early Reception of the Incompleteness Theorems\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results were certainly surprising, but some sort of\nincompleteness phenomenon was not totally unexpected. The possibility\nof incompleteness in the context of set theory was discussed by\nBernays and Tarski already in 1928, and von Neumann, in contrast to\nthe dominant spirit in Hilbert\u2019s program, had considered it\npossible that logic and mathematics were not decidable. G\u00f6del\nhimself had mentioned the possibility of an undecidable problem\nconcerning real numbers in his thesis in 1929 (see Dawson 1985).\nHilbert (1928), on the other hand, had assumed that Peano Arithmetic\nand other standard theories were complete. Apparently G\u00f6del was\nalso impressed by Brouwer, who in his lecture in Vienna in 1928 had\nsuggested that mathematics is inexhaustible and cannot be completely\nformalized (see Wang 1987, 84; and the section on Brouwer\u2019s view\nof the formalist program in the entry on\n the development of intuitionistic logic).\n\nBe that as it may, it seems that G\u00f6del actually arrived at the\nfirst exact observations about incompleteness via a different route,\nduring his attempts to contribute to Hilbert\u2019s program,\nand not to undermine it (see Dawson 1997: Ch. IV). Namely, in 1930,\nG\u00f6del made an effort to advance Hilbert\u2019s program by\nattempting to prove the consistency of analysis (or, second-order\narithmetic) with the resources of arithmetic, and thus reduce the\nconsistency of the former to the consistency of the latter. In his\nattempted proof, he needed the notion of truth. G\u00f6del soon faced\nvarious paradoxes (such as the Liar paradox), and had to conclude that\narithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. Hence, G\u00f6del\nfirst arrived at a version of the undefinability of truth theorem,\nusually associated with Tarski (cf. Murawski 1998). This also easily\nyields a weak version of the incompleteness result: the set of\nsentences provable in arithmetic can be defined in the language of\narithmetic, but the set of true arithmetical sentences cannot;\ntherefore the two cannot coincide. Moreover, under the assumption that\nall provable sentences are true, it follows that there must be true\nsentences which are not provable. This approach, though, does not\nexhibit any particular such sentence.\n\nHowever, the intellectual environment of G\u00f6del was that of the\nVienna Circle with its radically anti-metaphysical attitude. In\nparticular, even the notion of truth was considered as suspicious or\neven nonsensical at the time, at least by some logical positivists\n(e.g., Neurath, Hempel). Therefore, G\u00f6del worked hard to\neliminate any appeal to the notion of truth and attempted to do\nwithout it. He therefore introduced the notion of \\(\\omega\\)-consistency,\nwhich can be defined rigorously and purely syntactically. This led to\nthe incompleteness theorems in the form that they are now known.\n\nAs to the Diagonalization Lemma, actually G\u00f6del himself\noriginally demonstrated only a special case of it, that is, only for\nthe provability predicate. The general lemma was apparently first\ndiscovered by Carnap 1934 (see G\u00f6del 1934, 1935). Still more\ngeneral versions, for formulas with free variables, were presented in\nEhrenfeucht & Feferman 1960 and Montague 1962 (see Smory\u0144ski\n1981).\n\nThe reception of G\u00f6del\u2019s results was mixed. Some important\nfigures in the field of logic and the foundations of mathematics quite\nquickly assimilated the results and understood their relevance, but\nthere was also quite a lot of misunderstanding and resistance (for\ndetailed accounts of the reception, see Dawson 1985; Mancosu\n1999).\n\nG\u00f6del revealed his results to Carnap in Vienna on 26 August 1930,\nand announced his result (the first theorem) in a casual discussion\nremark in the famous K\u00f6nigsberg Conference on September 7, 1930.\nJohn von Neumann, who was in the audience and was at the time working\nin the context of Hilbert\u2019s program, immediately understood the\ngreat importance of the result. On 20 November he wrote a letter to\nG\u00f6del on a \u201cremarkable\u201d corollary of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result he had discovered: the unprovability of\nconsistency (the second theorem). Meanwhile G\u00f6del himself,\nhowever, had found the same idea and had already sent the final\nversion of his article, which now contained also a statement of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, for publication. The article was\npublished in January 1931 (G\u00f6del 1931; helpful introductions to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s original paper are Kleene 1986 and Zach 2005). The\nword quickly started to spread of these results which apparently had\ngreat importance for the foundations of mathematics\u2014though views\non what really was the moral varied. Paul Bernays, perhaps the most\nimportant collaborator of Hilbert, showed great interest in the\nresults, though he first had difficulties in understanding them\nproperly. His active correspondence with G\u00f6del also shows that\nG\u00f6del was already at the time fully aware of the undefinability\nof truth.\n\nAs G\u00f6del\u2019s original approach focused on his specific though\nvery comprehensive system P and its (primitive\nrecursive) extensions, some doubted the generality of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s results. Alonzo Church, for example, in a letter to\nG\u00f6del in July 1932, suggested that G\u00f6del\u2019s results\nwould not apply to his system of \\(\\lambda\\)-conversion (the system was\nlater proved to be inconsistent by Kleene and Rosser). G\u00f6del was\nanxious to generalize his discoveries, and extended the results to a\nwider class of systems in papers in 1932 and 1934. He also suggested\nthat his methods would be applicable to standard systems of set theory\n(however, it was only after the satisfactory characterization of\ndecidability and the Church-Turing thesis a few years later that it\nwas possible to give a fully general formulation of the incompleteness\ntheorems (see above); this was first done in Kleene 1936). The eminent\nset-theorist Ernst Zermelo directed some rather harsh criticism\ntowards G\u00f6del\u2019s work, but the two also corresponded on the\ntopic. Zermelo seems to have had serious difficulties in understanding\nthe relevant concepts and results.\n\nIn March 1933, G\u00f6del received a letter from Paul Finsler, from\nZ\u00fcrich, who suggested that he had already earlier (in Finsler\n1926) done closely related work but with a more general relevance.\nG\u00f6del replied that Finsler\u2019s system was not really defined\nat all. In his heated response, Finsler claimed that it was not\nnecessary to be able to study a system for it to be sharply defined,\nand that there was no difference in principle between his ideas and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s. In retrospect, it is quite clear that the\napproaches of Finsler and G\u00f6del were very different: for\nG\u00f6del\u2019s work, the notion of formalized system was\nessential, whereas Finsler rejected the very notion as artificially\nrestrictive. In fact, it is far from clear that Finsler\u2019s ideas\nmake any sense\u2014whatever vague analogies there may be between\nthem and G\u00f6del\u2019s proof.\n\nOn the other hand, it is fair to say that Emil Post had in some\nrespects anticipated G\u00f6del\u2019s discoveries. He obtained\nabstract versions of incompleteness results apparently already in\n1922. In particular, he observed that his methods would provide a\nstatement undecidable in Principia Mathematica. These results\nwere, however, based on Post\u2019s own version of the\n\u201cChurch-Turing thesis\u201d, with which he was dissatisfied,\nand his work was left unpublished. It was reported much later in (Post\n1941). \n\nThe correctness of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems remained the subject of\nlively debate throughout the 1930s (see Dawson 1985). In 1939, Hilbert\nand Bernays\u2019 second volume of Die Grundlagen der\nMathematik appeared, including a detailed proof of the second\nincompleteness theorem. Thereafter, serious opposition to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s conclusions disappeared at least among those who\nwere working actively in mathematical logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. However, in more philosophical circles, some resistance\nremained. Most famously, Wittgenstein made some critical remarks\nconcerning G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem in his posthumously published\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. The dominant initial\nreaction was that Wittgenstein simply failed to understand the result.\nMore charitable interpretations have emerged, and the debate is still\nvery much alive (see the section on G\u00f6del and undecidable\npropositions in the entry on\n Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of mathematics).\n",
