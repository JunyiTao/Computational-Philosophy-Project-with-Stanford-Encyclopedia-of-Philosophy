    "main_text": "A Tutorial on Bayesian Epistemology || Two Core Norms\n1.2 Two Core Norms\n\nThe two Bayesian norms sketched above can be stated a bit more\ngenerally as follows. (A formal statement will be provided after this\ntutorial, in\n section 2.)\n Suppose that there are some possibilities under consideration, which\nare mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. A proposition under\nconsideration is one that is true or false in each of those\npossibilities, so it can be identified with the set of the\npossibilities in which it is true. When those possibilities are finite\nin number, and when you have credences in all of them, Probabilism\ntakes a simple form, saying that your credences ought to be\nprobabilistic in this sense:\n\n\n(Non-Negativity) The credences assigned to the\npossibilities under consideration are non-negative real numbers.\n(Sum-to-One) The credences assigned to the\npossibilities under consideration sum to 1.\n(Additivity) The credence assigned to a\nproposition under consideration is equal to the sum of the credences\nassigned to the possibilities in that proposition.\n\n\n\nWhile this norm is synchronic in that it constrains your\ncredences at each time, the next norm is diachronic. Suppose\nthat you just received a piece of evidence E, which is true in\nat least some possibilities under consideration. Suppose further that\nE exhausts all the evidence you just received. Then the\nPrinciple of Conditionalization says that your credences ought to\nchange as if you followed the procedure below (although it is possible\nto design other procedures to the same effect):\n\n\n(Zeroing) For each possibility incompatible\nwith evidence E, drop its credence down to zero.\n(Rescaling) For the possibilities compatible\nwith evidence E, rescale their credences by a common factor to\nmake them sum to 1.\n(Resetting) Now that there is a new credence\ndistribution over the individual possibilities, reset the credences in\npropositions according to the Additivity rule in Probabilism.\n\n\n\nThe second step, rescaling, deserves attention. It is designed to\nensure compliance with Probabilism, but it also has an independent,\nintuitive appeal. Consider any two possibilities in which new evidence\nE is true. Thus the new evidence alone cannot distinguish those\ntwo possibilities and, hence, it seems to favor the two equally. So it\nseems that, if a person starts out being twice as confident in one of\nthose two possibilities as in the other, she should remain so after\nthe credence change in light of E, as required by the rescaling\nstep. The essence of conditionalization is preservation of certain\nratios of credences, which is a feature inherited by generalizations\nof conditionalization (see\n section 5\n for details).\n\nSo there you have it: Probabilism and the Principle of\nConditionalization, which are held by most Bayesians to be the two\ncore norms in Bayesian epistemology.\n\n\n",
