How many mechanisms for how many marks?\n\nWe have distinguished three \u201cmarks\u201d or effects of\nintensionality: substitution-resistance, the availability of\nunspecific readings, and existence-neutrality. A natural question is\nwhether one and the same semantic mechanism underlies all three\neffects, whether they are entirely independent, or whether two have a\ncommon source distinct from the third\u2019s.\n\nIn the context of a discussion of propositional attitude verbs, that\nis, verbs which take clausal or clause-embedding noun-phrase\ncomplements rather than simple noun-phrase (NP) objects, one\nhypothesis which keeps explanatory apparatus to the minimum is that\nall three effects of intensionality arise from the possibility of the\ncomplement having narrow scope with respect to the attitude\nverb. Thus we might distinguish two readings of\n\n(1)\n\nLex Luthor fears that Superman is nearby,\n\nnamely\n\n(2a)\n\nLex Luthor fears-true the proposition that Superman is\n nearby[2]\n\n\nand\n\n(2b)\n\nSuperman is someone such that Lex Luthor fears(-true the\nproposition) that he is nearby.\n\n\nIn (2a) we make the clause \u2018that Superman is nearby\u2019 the\ncomplement of \u2018proposition\u2019 to guarantee that\n\u2018Superman\u2019 is within the scope of \u2018fears\u2019 (the\nresulting NP \u2018the proposition\u2026\u2019 is a \u201cscope\nisland\u201d). And in (2b) we use a form of words that encourages an\naudience to process \u2018Superman\u2019 ahead of\n\u2018fears\u2019. We can associate substitution-resistance with\n(2a), while allowing substitution in (2b). (2b) ascribes a complex\nproperty to Superman, and therefore also to Clark; namely, being\nan x such that Lex fears x to be nearby. (2a), on the other hand,\nputs Lex in the fearing-true attitude relation to a certain\nproposition, with essentially no implications about what other\npropositions he may fear-true. So, provided the proposition that\nSuperman is nearby is distinct from the proposition that Clark Kent is\nnearby, substitution-failure in (1) construed as (2a) is\nexplicable.\n\nAs for taking these two propositions to be distinct, there are many\nserviceable accounts, mostly involving some variation of the original\nproposal in modern philosophical semantics, found in (Frege 1892,\n1970). According to Frege, every meaningful expression or phrase has\nboth a customary reference that it denotes, and a\ncustomary sense that it expresses. In the case of clauses,\nthe customary reference would be a truth-value which is\ncompositionally derived from the denotations of the words of the\nclause, and the customary sense would be a way of thinking of that\ntruth-value, compositionally derived from the senses of the words of\nthe clause. Therefore, provided that \u2018Superman\u2019 and\n\u2018Clark Kent\u2019 have different though coreferential senses\n(i.e., provided they express different ways of thinking of the same\nindividual) we will get different propositions. (However, it\u2019s highly\nnon-trivial to find an adequate account of the senses of names, given\nthe critique of the most straightforward accounts in (Kripke\n1972).)\n\nHowever, on the face of it, this only has (1), intended in the (2a)\nmanner, expressing a different proposition from\n\n(2c)\n Lex Luthor fears that Clark is nearby.\n\n\nSince truth-value is on the level of reference, and the corresponding\nwords of (2a) and (2c) all have the same referents, the resulting\ntruth-values for (2a) and (2c) will be the same; but they are supposed\nto be different. So Frege makes the ingenious suggestion that it is an\neffect of embedding in intensional contexts (he only considered\nclausal verbs) that expressions in such contexts no longer denote\ntheir customary references, but rather their customary senses. Using\n\u2018iff\u2019 henceforth to abbreviate \u2018if and only\nif\u2019, then (1) intended as (2a) is true iff the reference of\n\u2018Lex\u2019 stands in the fearing-true relation to\nthe switched reference of \u2018Superman is nearby\u2019,\nnamely, its customary sense. Now we have our explanation of why merely\ninterchanging\ncustomarily co-referential expressions in (1) can produce\nfalsehood from a truth: the substitution does not preserve reference,\nsince the names are now denoting their customary senses. However, if\n(1) is intended as (2b), there will be no truth-value switch, since\nthere is no name-reference switch: in (2b) \u2018Superman\u2019 is\nnot in the scope of \u2018fears\u2019, therefore it denotes its\ncustomary reference, and interchange with any other expression\ndenoting that same referent must of necessity be truth-value\npreserving. (Readers in search of more detailed discussion of Frege\u2019s\nnotion of sense might consult the section on\n Frege\u2019s philosophy of language\n in the entry on Frege. See also the entry on\n propositional attitude reports,\n and for other uses of Frege-style \u201cswitcher semantics\u201d,\nGluer and Pagin 2012.)\n\nA view like this has the capacity to explain the other intensionality\neffects. The specific-unspecific ambiguity in \u2018Lex fears that an\nextraterrestrial is nearby\u2019 is explained in terms of scope\nambiguity, the notional or unspecific reading corresponding to\n\n(3a)\n Lex Luthor fears-true the proposition that an extraterrestrial is\nnearby\n\n\nand the relational or specific reading to\n\n(3b)\n An extraterrestrial is such that Lex Luthor fears that it is\nnearby.\n\n\nExistence-neutrality is also explained, since the proposition\nthat an extraterrestrial is nearby is available for its truth to be\nfeared, believed, doubted or denied, whether or not there are\nextraterrestrials.\n\nThere are other accounts of substitution failure, but details are\nincidental at this point. For there are real issues about (A) whether\na single mechanism could be responsible for all three\neffects, and (B) whether an account of any effect in terms of a scope\nmechanism is workable for transitive, as opposed to clausal,\nverbs.\n\n(A) The behaviors cited in the previous section suggest that\nsubstitution-resistance and the availability of an unspecific reading\nhave different explanations. For we saw that the verb\n\u2018need\u2019 contrasts with the verb \u2018want\u2019 as\nregards substitution-resistance, but is similar as regards the\navailability of unspecific readings of embedding VPs. So it seems\nthat there is a mechanism that blocks substitution, perhaps the\nFregean reference-switch one, perhaps something else more compatible\nwith what Davidson calls \u201csemantic innocence\u201d (Davidson\n1969, 172\u2014a semantically innocent account of\nsubstitution-failure is one that does not alter the semantics of the\nsubstitution-resisting expressions themselves for the special case in\nwhich they occur in intensional contexts). And this mechanism cannot\noccur with \u2018need\u2019, but can with \u2018want\u2019\n(\u2018can\u2019 rather than \u2018does\u2019 because it is\noptional; this is to allow for \u201ctransparent\u201d or\nsubstitution-permitting readings of the likes of \u2018Lex fears\nSuperman\u2019 analogous to (3b)). On the other hand, whatever\naccounts for notional readings is evidently available to both verbs,\nand therefore it is not the same mechanism as underlies the\nsubstitution-resistance of \u2018wants\u2019. However, this\nreasoning is not conclusive, since the substitution-resistance\nmechanism may be present with \u2018needs\u2019 (and transaction\nverbs) but somehow rendered ineffective (see Parsons 1997, 370). One\nwould need to hear how the ineffectiveness comes about.\n\nEvaluative verbs present the converse challenge:\nsubstitution-resistance but apparently no unspecific readings of\nembedding VPs, certainly not existential ones. It is less clear how a\ndefender of a \u2018single explanation\u2019 theory would handle\nthis, at least if the single explanation is a scope mechanism, since\nit appears from the other cases that occurrence within the scope of\nthe intensional verb immediately produces an unspecific reading.\n\nSuspension of existential commitment may group with availability of\nunspecific readings for explanatory purposes. There appear to be no\ncases of intensional transitives which allow notional readings of\nembedded VPs, but where those VPs have the same existential\nconsequences as ones which differ just by the substitution of an\nextensional for the intensional verb.\n\n(B) The scope account is the only real contender for a single\nexplanation of the intensionality effects. But there is a major\nquestion about whether it can be transferred at all from clausal to\ntransitive verbs. For the intensionality effects would all be\nassociated with narrow-scope occurrences of noun phrases (NPs), and\nwith a transitive verb such syntactic configuration is problematic\nwhen the NP is quantified. This is because, in standard first-order\nsyntax, a quantifier must have a sentence within its scope (an open\nsentence with a free variable the NP binds, if redundant\nquantification is ruled out in the syntax). We can provide this for\nrelational or wide-scope readings, for example\n\n(4)\n An extraterrestrial is such that Lois is looking for it\n\n\nin which \u2018Lois is looking for it\u2019 is the scope of\n\u2018an extraterrestrial\u2019. But if \u2018an\nextraterrestrial\u2019 is supposed to be within the scope of\n\u2018looking for\u2019 there is no clause to be its scope;\nit has to be an argument of the relation, which is not allowed in\nfirst-order language. As Kaplan says, \u2018without an inner\nsentential context\u2026distinctions of scope disappear\u2019\n(Kaplan 1986, 266). (Though readers who have taught symbolic logic\nwill be very familiar with the student who, having symbolized\n\u2018Jack hit Bill\u2019 as \u2018Hjb\u2019, then offers\nsomething like \u2018Hj(\u2203x)\u2019 as the\nsymbolization of \u2018Jack hit someone.\u2019)\n\nThe description of the problem suggests two forms of solution. One is\nto preserve first-order syntax by uncovering hidden material to be the\nscope of a quantified NP even when the latter is within the scope of\nthe intensional verb. The other is to drop first-order syntax in favor\nof a formalism which permits the meanings of quantified NPs to be\narguments of intensional relations such as fearing and seeking. We\nconsider these options in turn in the following two sections.\n",
