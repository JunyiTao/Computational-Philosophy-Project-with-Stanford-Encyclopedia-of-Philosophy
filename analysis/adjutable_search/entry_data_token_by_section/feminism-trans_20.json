    "main_text": "Feminist Solidarity After Queer Theory || Race/Sex Analogies\n8.3 Race/Sex Analogies\n\nHeyes also examines the use of sex/race analogy in questions about\ntranssexuality and a hypothetical \u201ctransracialism.\u201d Recall\nRaymond's rhetorical question \u201cDoes a Black person who\nwants to be white suffer from the \u2018disease\u2019 of being a\n\u2018transracial?\u2019\u201d Such a question is intended to show\nthat, since \u201ctransracialism\u201d is politically and morally\nsuspect, so too, is transsexuality. Christine Overall, by contrast,\nargues the inverse of what Raymond claims, namely that those who accept\nthe morality of transsexuality ought to accept the morality of\n\u201ctransracialism\u201d as well (2004).\n\nHeyes observes that Raymond's claim that \u201cthere is no\ndemand for transracial medical intervention precisely because most\nBlacks recognize that it is their society, not their skin, that needs\nchanging\u201d [1994, xvi] is actually empirically false (2003, 1102).\nCosmetic procedures do exist which aim to modify ethnically or\nracially marked features (e.g. hair-straightening treatments,\nnose-jobs, eye-lid surgery). Heyes points to Raymond's use of a\nsex/race analogy to dismiss transsexuals as \u201ccapricious or\nappropriative\u201d (2006, 269). The analogy is used, Heyes claims, as\na basis for assessing the motivations and politics of individuals who\nchange identity in a way that problematically assumes that such\nmotivations may be based on a \u201ctransparent political evaluation\nof its benefits and drawbacks\u201d (ibid.).\n\nWhile Overall offers a far more nuanced analysis, claims Heyes, she\nstill treats race and sex in a way that is abstracted from the\nhistorical conditions and assumes that such history is irrelevant to\nethical assessment (2006, 269\u201370). In particular, Heyes argues that in\ndrawing analogies between race and sex there is a danger in not paying\nsufficient attention to the contrasting histories of race and sex. For\nexample, since sex has been viewed as a core ontological fact in a\nbinary scheme, the conditions are in place for the possibility of\nsex-change as well as medicalized transsexual discourse which\nreinscribes this basic, ontological binary (2003, 1102; 2006, 2006,\n277). By contrast, while race has also been viewed as a natural\ncategory, there is another racial discourse which understands it as a\nsuperficial feature under which human beings are all the same. This,\nalong with the lack of the same strict binary, does not provide the\nsame conditions which would make \u201ctransracialism\u201d a similar\npossibility (2003, 1103).\n\nHeyes points to the historical role played by heredity in determining\nrace (but not sex). This mitigates against the possibility of\n\u201ctransracialism\u201d in a way that is not present in the case\nof sex, she argues (2006, 271). Relatedly, changing race has a history\nof being associated with \u201cpassing\u201d which would leave any\n\u201ctransracialist\u201d subject to accusations of\n\u201cpassing\u201d in a way that is not present in the case of\nsexual crossing (272). Heyes notes, then, that those promoting cosmetic\nprocedures which change ethnic or racial features take care to avoid\nissues around racial betrayal by emphasizing individual self-expression\nand aesthetics (273\u20134). By contrast, argues Heyes, since sex is not\nviewed as hereditary, the possible of sex-change has been more viable.\nIndeed, contemporary sex must be understood as partially constituted by\nthe history of technological developments in sex modification (as\n\u201cpassing\u201d has partially constituted race) that has\nprecisely allowed for such sex-change within the discourse of\npathology and internal gender identity (277).\n",
