    "main_text": "Background\n2. Background\n\nLike all philosophical movements and traditions, the philosophy of\nliberation emerged out of both world historical and regional\nsocio-historical contexts. In terms of the world historical\nbackground, World War II, and in particular the disclosures about the\ngenocide of the Jews, the Cold War, and the South East Asian wars,\ncreated a world historical stage in which Europe and its intellectual\nand moral traditions stood discredited. Whereas before, all things\nEuropean were regarded as the standard against which everything would\nhave to be measured, Europe had become suspect. Latin Americans had to\nlook elsewhere for inspiration and intellectual guidance.\n\nThe regional socio-historical situation was framed, on the one side,\nby the Cuban revolution, and the numerous military dictatorships\nthroughout the Latin American subcontinent, on the other, that took\nplace as a consequence of the Cold War and the failures of economic\ndevelopment in Latin America. The Cuban revolution, however, had a\nprofound impact in the socio-political-cultural imagination throughout\nLatin America. In the iconic image of Che Guevara (1928\u20131967),\nthe revolution promise a transformation of the Latin American human\nbeing\u2014el nuevo hombre\u2014as it also raised the\npossibility of political sovereignty for Latin American nations. The\ndecade of the sixties in Latin American was a time of political\nturmoil, but above all of cultural renewal and utopian yearning.\n\nThe philosophy of liberation, however, was above all an intellectual\nand philosophical response and unquestionably synthesis of a series of\nintellectual and cultural movements that had been gestating for a\ndecade throughout Latin America. The cultural context was so ripe with\nproclamations and thinking about \u201cliberation\u201d that if the\nphilosophy of liberation had not been so named in the late sixties and\nearly seventies, today we would have wondered whether philosophers had\nbeen abducted from this world and sequestered in some time capsule.\nThe philosophy of liberation was both necessary and inevitable.\n\nDrawing on the work of Carlos Beorlegui, a historian of Latin American\nphilosophy, we can say that there are some identifiable\n\u201cmatrixes\u201d, or intellectual sources, from which liberation\nphilosophy emerged (Beorlegui 2004:\n 677\u2013690).[2]\n Here, they will be characterized as follows.\n\nThe Economic Matrix: The Theory of Dependence. After the end\nof World War II, the United States undertook to finance the\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d of Latin America on the model of\nindustrialized and capitalist nations. This is what the Alliance for\nProgress (1961\u20131973) aimed to do this by granting loans that\nwould help economically underdeveloped nations to ascend the ladder of\neconomic development. This program was guided by the economic theory\ncalled \u201cdesarrollismo\u201d or\ndevelopmentalism. Yet, Latin American nations continue to lag\nbehind both socially and economically.\n\nIt is in the face of this failure that a series of economists began to\ndevelop \u201cdependency theory\u201d, or the \u201ctheory of the\ndevelopment of underdevelopment\u201d, among who were: Theothonio dos\nSantos, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Enzo Falleto, Celso Furtado, and\nAnibal Quijano. The core of this theory was that the underdevelopment\nof the Latin American nation was not due to endogenous factors, but\nrather was a direct consequence of economic dependence on Europe and\nthe United States. The model of development that reigned during the\nfifties and sixties, according to these theorists, had a double\nperverse effect: greater capital accumulation in the metropolises and\nlending nations, and greater indebtedness and impoverishment in the\nso-called underdeveloped nations. The economic underdevelopment of\nLatin America was now to be understood in terms of an economic theory\nthat showed that underdevelopment is not a prior stage in the natural\neconomic development of nations, but rather an integral dimension of\nthe international economic order created by colonialism, imperialism,\nand neo-imperialism.\n\nThe Religious Matrix: The Theology of Liberation. The\nemergence of Liberation Theology has been amply documented and studied\nin the specialized literature. Yet, liberation theology is as much a\nphenomenon of global Catholicism as it is a unique Latin American\ndevelopment. The reforms began with Vatican II (1962\u20131965) and\nthe Second Latin American Bishops congregation in Medell\u00edn,\nColombia (1968), created the church context for the consolidation of\nwhat was in effect a social movement, namely the\n\u201ccommunidades de base\u201d (base communities). The\ntheology of liberation developed in response to a new understanding of\nthe church\u2019s relationship to the \u201cpeople\u201d and the\nrole of the faith in a world of incredible poverty and social\ninequality.\n\nThe theology of liberation forged a whole new language: the\n\u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d, the \u201cunderside\nof history\u201d, \u201cthe church of the people\u201d,\n\u201corthopraxis is prior to orthodoxy\u201d that influenced some\nphilosophers of liberation. Still, two of the most important\ncontributions of the theology of liberation to the philosophy of\nliberation were the imperative that critical reflection had to emerge\nout of committed praxis, and the problematization of the\nconcept of \u201cel pueblo\u201d. The theology of\nliberation may be understood as theological reflection on what\nconstituted a people, a community of faith. In short, theology of\nliberation asks: who is the subject of God\u2019s soteriology. Most\nnoteworthy is that Gustavo Gutierrez published his Teolog\u00eda\nde la liberaci\u00f3n. Perspectivas (A Theology of Liberation)\nin 1971 in Peru, while Hugo Assmann published his\nOpresi\u00f3n-Liberaci\u00f3n: desaf\u00edo a los\ncristianos (Oppression-Liberation: Challenge to\nChristians) the same year in Chile. The Catholic Church also\nprovided an institutional framework within which some of the work of\nphilosophers of liberation could be pursued by hosting\n\u201cjornadas\u201d, sponsoring congresses, and providing\nteaching opportunities in its affiliated universities for philosophers\nof liberation, many who had been expelled from public\nuniversities.\n\nThe Educational Matrix: The Pedagogy of the Oppressed. In\n1970, after nearly two decades of literacy work in the Brazilian\nfavelas and poor sectors of Brazil, Paulo Freire published\nhis paradigm shifting text Pedagogia del oprimido\n(Pedagogy of the Oppressed) (1970), which was followed in\n1972 by his Education for the Praxis of Liberation. At the\ncore of Freire\u2019s work were three key ideas: if the people are to\novercome their dependence, they can only do so through their own\nagency, by becoming the subject of their own liberation; to become a\nsubject of one\u2019s own liberation means to engage in a process of\nconscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o, or consciousness raising, that\ntakes place through a pedagogy that rejects the notion of the learner\nas a passive receptacle and instead departs from the fundamental\nrealization that learning is a dynamic process. Two key notions of\nFreire\u2019s pedagogy of liberation were that (1) teaching requires\nlistening to the people, and (2) schooling means life, that is,\nlearning is both indispensable to life and it takes place in the midst\nof living. Freire\u2019s key phrase\n\u201cconscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d goes on to be\nappropriated by liberation philosophers as their own goal: philosophy\nis at the service of the raising of both individual and collective\nconsciousness.\n\nThe Literary-Artistic Matrix: The Boom and the Muralists. It\nis often forgotten that the sixties were the time of the Latin\nAmerican literary Boom. This is the decade when Jos\u00e9 M.\nArguedas, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel\nGarc\u00eda-M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Octavio Paz, Juan\nRulfo, Ernesto S\u00e1bato published their major works. During this\ndecade there also emerged a genre that gave expression to the heavy\nconsciousness of dependence and the spirit of rebellion and quest for\nemancipation, namely the Novelas de Guerrilla; among which\nare Julio de la Vega\u2019s Mat\u00edas, el ap\u00f3stol\nsuplente (1971, Jes\u00fas Lara\u2019s\n\u00d1aucahuaz\u00fa, Sue\u00f1os (1969, Renato Prada\nOropeza\u2019s, Los fundadores del alba (1969), Gaby Vallejo\nde Bol\u00edvar\u2019s Los Vulnerables (1973, Oscar Uzin\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s, La oscuridad radiante (1976). Just\nas these writers demonstrated how a distinct Latin American literary\ntradition could be forged, the muralists demonstrated how standards of\nartistic beauty that celebrated proudly the aesthetic sensibility and\ncreativity of the continent. The est\u00e9tica indigenista\n(indigeneous aesthetics) celebrates by muralists like Diego\nOrozco, Rivera, Siqueiros, and painters like Frida Kahlo, created a\nnew iconic representation of the Latin American people that more\necumenically reflected the continent\u2019s mestizaje, or\nracial mixing and hybridity.\n\nThe Sociological Matrix: The Sociology of Liberation. The\nfifties and sixties, as was already noted, were decades of tremendous\nsocial-economic-political turmoil throughout Latin America. Latin\nAmerican industrialization went in tandem with massive urbanization\nand de-ruralization. Extensive migrations from the countryside to the\ncities gave rise to the shantytowns that are so distinctly visible in\nmost Latin American metropolises. Sociologist began to address the\nunique challenges of de-ruralization and urbanization. In Colombia,\nsociologist Orlando Fals Borda, who worked with Colombian peasants,\nbegan to develop what he called a \u201csociology of\nliberation\u201d that meant to address the very unique situation of\nthe urban and rural poor in contexts in which the state was nearly\nabsent. Fals Borda studied in particular the ways in which the poor\ncreated their own institutions and norms of social interaction.\nCombined with the theory of dependence, the sociology of liberation,\ncreated an interdisciplinary matrix that sought to address the\nconditions of systemic inequity, while raising the norm that people\ncould be the agents of their own liberation.\n\nIt is clear that both dependence and liberation were in the lips of\neconomists, sociologists, theologians, and writers. The philosophy of\nliberation gave expression in concepts what was a lived local and\nglobally interlinked experience.\n",
