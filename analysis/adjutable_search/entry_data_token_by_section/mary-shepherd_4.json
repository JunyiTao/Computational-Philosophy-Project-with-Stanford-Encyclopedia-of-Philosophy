    "main_text": "Knowledge of the existence of an external world || Perceptual knowledge and reason\n3.1 Perceptual knowledge and reason\n\nThere is considerable evidence that Shepherd has a foundational theory\nof perceptual knowledge, e.g. \u201cReason does establish this\nbeautiful and certain proposition, which is the foundation of all our\nknowledge\u2014That like causes must ever produce like Effects\u201d\n(ERCE [2000: 143\u20134]). The principles of the theory of causation\n\u201cregulate every opinion speculative and practical\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: xiii, 190]). The epistemic foundations of our knowledge\nare the basic causal principles. Because knowledge of causal\nprinciples is secured somehow by reason, she wants to suggest, they\nare less subject to doubt than those offered by Hume (EPEU\n[2020: 27\u20138]). Yet the most sharply focused issue about\nShepherd\u2019s epistemology discussed in the literature is the part\nreason plays in knowledge.\n\nAs we saw, Shepherd holds we have an idea of a cause adequate for an\nargument for CP. Fantl (2016) and Bolton (2019) assume this is an\nexample of knowing a principle by reason. But this is difficult to\nmake out. Fantl interprets the argument as a thought experiment\nsupposed to reduce the denial of CP to a contradiction, but finds no\nunproblematic way to state the argument. Bolton interprets it as a\nvalid, but circular, argument which implies nothing about what happens\nin the world.\n\nFolescu (2020) objects to these accounts mainly because they take the\nargument to confer knowledge. She finds the view that CP is a\nfoundational principle, i.e. a proposition known without basis in\nknowledge of another proposition, to be in tension with the view that\nCP is established by an argument. As Folescu understands it, the\nargument for CP is analytic yet we are said to know the principle; she\nconcludes it is known without proof. This is confirmed by the fact\nthat shortly after stating this argument, Shepherd asks readers to\ngrant the causal principle so she can use it in making her points\nagainst Hume (ERCE [2000: 39]; EPEU [2020: 164, note 9]). So, Folescu\nmaintains, although Shepherd sometimes seems to say causal principles\ncan be demonstrated, she ought not to (e.g. Folescu: 13\u201314). To\nmy mind, this is right and helpful.\n\nThen what does reason contribute to our knowledge of the existence of\nthe external world? As Folescu interprets it, reason constructs\narguments which have a role similar to that of proofs in the practice\nof early twentieth century mathematicians who built axiomatic theories\nabout neglected subjects such as sets. She provides an instructive\npicture of their use of proofs to motivate acceptance of certain\npropositions as axioms by bringing out the benefits it brings, e.g.\nadopting an axiom may greatly increase the usefulness of the theory\n(Folescu 17\u201319 ). But our interest is in Shepherd\u2019s\naccount of knowledge of foundational principles, or first principles.\nFolescu quotes a neglected passage which states that first principles\nare a sort of perception: \u201cFirst principles are the perceptions\nof the corollaries, inclusions, or necessary relations of our simple\nimpressions, and infants who have not a capacity fitted to generate\nsuch perceptions are born idiots\u201d (EPEU [2020: 314], quoted in\nFolescu (2020: 11). Taking this to say first principles are\nknown without proof and characterizing this as a sort of intuitive\nknowledge, Folescu mentions two sources known to Shepherd that might\nhave influenced her: Locke and Reid. Locke contrasts\nintuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Briefly put, he holds we know a\nproposition by intuition just in case when we join two ideas in accord\nwith a proposition-making relation, we perceive relations among the\ncombined representations which are sufficient to show the proposition\nis true; we have demonstrative knowledge if the truth is perceived\nonly with aid of intuitive perception of intermediary truths (E [1975:\n4.2.1\u20133; 4.7.1]). We might say, intuition presents us with\nrepresentational evidence of truth. According to Reid\u2019s doctrine\nthat we have intuitive knowledge of the principles of common sense, a\nproposition known by intuition is believed as soon as it is\nunderstood; it is known without seeking evidence or inferring it from\nsomething else; knowledge of a principle is \u201cthe work of nature,\nand our original powers.\u201d (EPI [2002: 452: quoted by Folescu\n(2020: 12). According to Reid, intuitive knowledge is self evident in\nthat it neither has nor needs evidence of the proposition\u2019s\ntruth.\n\nFolescu argues that Shepherd\u2019s position has more in common with\nReid\u2019s theory than Locke\u2019s. She notes that Reid recognizes\nthe utility of arguments about epistemically basic principles that\nbring out the advantages of endorsing them as axioms; in this\nconnection, he explicitly mentions reductio proofs. She\nsuggests Shepherd intends CP to make the fundamental principle\naccessible to reasoning and to bring out its self-evident truth.\nFolescu admits Shepherd is critical of Reid\u2019s appeal to human\nnature or instinct to explain the foundations of knowledge. But,\nFolescu explains, Shepherd misses the point that Reid\u2019s theory\nis not unlike her own. On this interpretation, Shepherd maintains that\nfirst principles are known by intuition in the manner of Reid and she\nrecognizes that psychological explanations of belief of first\nprinciples are useful for the general advancement of knowledge,\n\nThis brief summary does not do justice to the sophistication and\nsubtlety of Folescu\u2019s discussion of the interplay of psychology\nand epistemology in Shepherd\u2019s thought. But the interpretation\nis open to the objection that Shepherd\u2019s critique of Reid is\nsquarely addressed to the doctrine he holds, and on many occasions.\nFor instance, Reid \u201ccuts the knot instead of untying it\u201d\nby referring belief in the existence of body to a natural instinct.\nThis is because it offers no satisfactory reason for belief or detail\nabout how it arises ([EPEU [2020: 5, 111\u201312]). Shepherd\npropounds a more complex account:\n\nThe class of ideas which Dr. Reid terms instinctive \u2026 I\nconsider to be the conclusions of a latent reasoning: as the mere\nresults and corollaries, included in the relation of those ideas and\nsensations already existing in the mind, and which were previously\nformed by the senses. (EPEU [2020: 170])\n\n\n As she sees it, perception is not a primitive inexplicable\ndisposition; but it is \u201cno more than an observation of the\nsimplest relations of our ideas\u2014It is but a simple\ninference of the understanding\u2026\u201d (EPEU [2020:\n113, 3, 8]) This and other texts strongly suggest that reason confers\nknowledge because it is the ability to grasp a relation between ground\nand consequent. Yet reason is the means by which we perceive the\nexistence of external objects. Although Folescu\u2019s reading neatly\nresolves a tension between the foundational status of CP and view that\nwe know the principle by means of an argument, it can also be seen as\nopening the way for an alternative resolution, namely, that Shepherd\nrecognizes more than one basis on which reason can respond to an\nepistemic relation between ground and consequent and rests causal and\nperceptual knowledge on one of them.\n\nBefore saying more about this, we should get clear about what Shepherd\nmeans by \u201cperception.\u201d She explicitly disagrees with\nReid\u2019s theory that sensations always precede acts of perception\nbut are entirely extrinsic to them; for him, sensations are\nintentional blanks that merely trigger the mind\u2019s formation of\nthe concept of an object and firm belief in its existence. By\ncontrast, when she uses the word \u201cperception\u201d it is\n\u201cin the sense of \u2018a consciousness of sensation\u2019, a\nSENSATION TAKEN NOTICE OF BY THE MIND\u201d ([EPEU [2020:\n6\u20139]).\n\nThe continuation of one of Shepherd\u2019s objections to Reid\npartially quoted above is more forthcoming. The gist is that\nperception is \u201cthe observation of the simplest relations of\nour ideas\u201d; this is analyzed as \u201ca simple inference\nof the understanding;\u201d this is broken down to \u201cthe\nperception of the CONSCIOUS SENSE (which takes notice when it is\naffected)\u201d together with \u201cthe perception of THE\nUNDERSTANDING\u201d to the effect that the sense organs and mind must\nbe affected by objects external to both. Shepherd adds: \u201cthis\ninference \u2026 is knowledge rather than instinct\u201d (EPEU\n[2020: 113]).\n\nThis is no more than a sketch, but three things are clear. First, we\nhave two types of perceptual knowledge: consciousness of juxtaposed\nsensations and understanding that some sensations are caused by\nparticular objects distinct from the amassed sensations. Second, the\nrelations discovered by understanding are inferred from\nthe\u2014presumably temporal\u2014relations of juxtaposition\nperceived by consciousness; i.e. the order among a mass of sensations\nknown by consciousness provides some sort of basis from which\nunderstanding infers the existence of a particular object that causes\ncertain sensations. (See especially the objection to Brown\u2019s\ntheory of instinctive belief (ERCE [2000: 138, 146]).) Third, if two\nor more sensations are juxtaposed in consciousness, their relation is\npart of a more comprehensive relation between items of consciousness\nand objects unavailable to consciousness which is the locus of the\ncausal relation (see the dichotomy of inner and outer existences,\nsection 3.2). An interpretation on which reason confers perceptual\nknowledge because it is inferential has considerable textual\nsupport.\n\nIt is clear, Shepherd holds we can, and sometimes do, deliberately\nargue from observed relations among things we perceive by sense to\nconclusions about relations among the (unknown) objects that cause\nthem. She holds that although sensations are essentially felt and can\nbe essentially like nothing but sensations, they have non-essential\nrelations to other things, such as variety, sameness, contrariety, and\nproportionality. She argues that there must be relations among\nsensible quality sensations accumulated in experience that are similar\nto relations among their respective causes. This is because if the\nsensory system and the mind are functioning well, they always operate\nin the same way, so the differences among temporally ordered\nsensations must be due to corresponding differences among their causes\ntaken in the same order (EPEU [2020: 4749, 63\u2013165,\n703\u2013704]). Not that the corresponding relations must be exactly\nthe same, but the same in some respect. Shepherd likens this to the\nLondon diorama, an elaborate three dimensional walk-in illusion of the\ncity famous in her day; she often makes an analogy with algebraic\nsigns used to calculate the values of their significations under an\ninterpretation, and sometimes a language that needs\ninterpretation (e.g. Boyle, 2020: 100),\n",
