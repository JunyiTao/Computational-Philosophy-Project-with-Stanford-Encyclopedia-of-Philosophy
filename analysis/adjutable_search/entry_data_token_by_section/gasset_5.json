    "main_text": "Biography || Ortega\u2019s Exile, Return and Last Years\n1.6 Ortega\u2019s Exile, Return and Last Years\n\nOrtega\u2019s acrid comments failed to shield him from the Republic\u2019s\npolitical turmoil. Thus, on August 31, 1936, during the early phases\nof the Spanish Civil War, stricken with serious gall bladder issues\nand not knowing what to expect from his political enemies, Ortega, his\nwife, his three children and his brother Eduardo embarked on a French\nboat from Alicante to Merseilles with the assistance of the French\nEmbassy. They settled in La Tronche, near Grenoble, until November\nwhen they moved to Paris where they remained, the winter of 1937 to\nAugust 1939, except for short trips to the Netherlands and Portugal.\nAt the invitation of Johann Huizinga, from late November 1937 to\nFebruary 1938,Ortega presented lectures in Rotterdam, Amsterdam,\nDelft, Leiden and The Hague. After the lectures in the Netherlands,\nOrtega returned to Paris where he underwent a gallbladder operation in\nOctober. In February, 1939, he traveled to the south of Portugal to\nrecuperate from the operation. While in Portugal, Ortega\u2019s mother died\non April 21, 1939 in a small town (Puente Genil) near C\u00f3rdoba;\non November 12 of the following year, his sister, Rafaela, died.\nEventually, at the end of August, Ortega left for Argentina\naccompanied by his wife and daughter. He remained in Argentina during\nthe major part of the Second World War, lecturing at the University of\nBuenos Aires until late February/early March in 1942, when he, his\nwife and daughter settled in Estoril, Portugal.\n\nIn August 1945, Ortega returned to Spain for the first time since the\noutbreak of the Spanish War. He passed the remainder of the summer in\nZumaya before returning to Portugal for the winter. Ortega\u2019s return to\nhis native country in 1945 marked the end of nine years in exile.\nHowever, to several of his Republican compatriots who remained in\nexile, a return to Franco Spain called into question his intellectual\nintegrity. The supporters of Franco, on the other hand, considered him\na former enemy and untrustworthy. Unable to republish issues of the\nRevista de Occidente because of governmental intervention,\nOrtega published extensively in German periodicals. Though his chair\nin metaphysics was officially restored, Ortega never resumed his\nteaching at the university. However, in 1948, with the assistance of\nhis former student and disciple, Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas\n(1914\u20132005), Ortega established El Instituto de Humanidades\n(\u201cInstitute of Humanities\u201d), in Madrid, at which he\nlectured and succeeded in attracting many students and liberal\nintellectuals. Despite its success, the government rarely allowed the\nInstitute to function freely and eventually shut down their activities\nin 1950.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1955, Ortega avoided the pressure of the Spanish\nGovernment by reactivating his cultural interests in conferences and\nmeetings abroad where he lectured and received honors. In early July\n1949, he visited Aspen, Colorado, with his good friend Ernst R.\nCurtius, the cultural historian, to attend and participate in the\nbicentennial commemoration of Goethe\u2019s birth under of the auspices and\ndirection of Robert M. Hutchins and the University of Chicago. In\nSeptember, he visited Hamburg, Berlin, Darmstadt and Munich for\nsimilar reasons. In August 1951, he returned to Germany to participate\nin a conference at Darmstadt (where he met Heidegger) and to receive\nan honorary doctorate from the University of Marburg. The conference,\nwhich Ortega was invited to attend in Darmstadt, was sponsored by\nscientists and architects to discuss \u201cMan and Space\u201d. This\nbrief meeting was apparently pleasant, as neither philosopher broached\nthe sensitive issue of originality or similarities of certain aspects\nof their thought during the course of their private conversations. In\n1951, he received another honorary doctorate from the University of\nGlasgow. Failing health due to stomach and liver cancer curtailed his\ntraveling after his last lecture given in May 1955 at Venice. On\nOctober 18, 1955, in Madrid, Ortega died in his apartment on the sixth\nfloor at Calle Monte Esquinza 28.\n",
