    "main_text": "Impossibility Results\n9. Conclusions\n\nThe coherence theory of justification represents an initially\nsuggestive solution to some deeply rooted problems of epistemology.\nPerhaps most significantly, it suggests a way of thinking about\nepistemic justification as arising in a \u201cweb of belief\u201d.\nAs such, it competes with, and could potentially replace, the\nhistorically dominating, but increasingly disreputable,\nfoundationalist picture of knowledge as resting on a secure base of\nindubitable fact. Coherentism may also be more promising than\nalternative foundationalist views with their reliance on non-doxastic\nsupport. Unfortunately, coherence theorists have generally struggled\nto provide the details necessary for their theory to advance beyond\nthe metaphorical stage, something which has not gone unnoticed by\ntheir critics. Following the seminal work of C. I. Lewis, contemporary\nscholars have taken on that challenge with considerable success in\nterms of clarity and established results, although a fair number of\nthe latter are to the coherentist\u2019s disadvantage. Some results support\na weak foundationalist theory according to which coherence can boost\ncredibility that is already there, without creating it from scratch.\nHowever, on the face of it, the impossibility results negatively\naffect this less radical form of coherence theory as well. It is often\nobserved that while it is relatively easy to put forward a convincing\ntheory in the outline, the ultimate test for any philosophical\nendeavor is whether the product will survive detailed specification\n(the devil is in the details, and so on). What the recent developments\nin this area have shown, if nothing else, is that this is very much\ntrue for the coherence theory of epistemic justification.\n",
