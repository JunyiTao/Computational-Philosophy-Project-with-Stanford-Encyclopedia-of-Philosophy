    "main_text": "Against Institutional Definitions\n7. Against Institutional Definitions\n\nBefore he arrived at that view, though, he spent some time arguing\nagainst a popular definition proposed by George Dickie. According to\nDickie,\n\n\na work of art in the classificatory sense is (1) an artifact, (2) a\nset of aspects of which has had conferred upon it the status of\ncandidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting on behalf\nof a certain social institution (the artworld). (Dickie 1974, 34)\n\n\nBeardsley has no quarrel with (1), but he finds fault with (2) on\nseveral counts.\n\nFirst, he wonders whether the \u201cappreciation\u201d spoken of can\nbe any sort of appreciation at all\u2014historical, moral, personal,\nprofessional, or whatever. If it can, the definition is far too broad.\nPerhaps, though, it\u2019s distinctly aesthetic appreciation\nthat\u2019s meant. In that case, Dickie would have to square his\nsecond condition with his attack on the idea of aesthetic appreciation\nas a distinct sort or kind of appreciation.\n\nSecond, the idea of candidacy for appreciation is problematic. A\ncandidate for appreciation can\u2019t be merely something, some\nproperty (or aspect), that\u2019s potentially appreciable. Too many\nproperties of too many things are potentially appreciable. If\n\u201ccandidacy\u201d is interpreted more narrowly and strictly,\nhowever, the idea that a property needs a status like \u201ccandidate\nfor appreciation\u201d bestowed upon it seems wrongheaded. A\ncandidate for President of the United States, for example, isn\u2019t\njust anyone who\u2019s eligible\u00a0but someone who has taken at\nleast some steps toward attaining that office, or someone who has had\nan official endorsement. But what\u2019s comparable in the case of\naspects of works of art?\n\n\nWhat sort of preparation or endorsement is contained in the assignment\nof candidacy for appreciation? The term suggests that something cannot\nbe appreciated until it has been declared a candidate for\nappreciation.\u00a0(APV: 133)\n\n\nbut being appreciated, or even appreciable, stands in need of no\none\u2019s imprimatur.\n\nThird, there\u2019s the question of who confers the status of\ncandidate for appreciation. Dickie\u2019s explicit answer is\n\u201csome person or acting on behalf of a certain social institution\n(the artworld)\u201d, with the artworld itself being\n\n\na bundle of systems: theater, painting, sculpture, literature, music,\nand so on, each of which furnishes an institutional background for the\nconferring of the status on objects within its domain\u00a0(Dickie\n1974, 33).\n\n\nIn calling the artworld an institution, Dickie says, he\u2019s saying\nthat \u201cit is an established practice\u201d (1974, 31). Music,\npainting, literature, and so on are social practices.\n\nBeardsley will have none of this. What it is to act on behalf of an\ninstitution is clear enough when an identifiable social institution,\nsuch as a university, is in question. The president of Marquette\nUniversity, for example, declares a tuition hike, or signs a document\ngranting tenure to David Decker. He acts on behalf of the institution\nin doing so, because there are clearly defined rules, roles, rights,\nresponsibilities, powers, positions, concepts, and acts that\nconstitute the institution that is the university, and he fits into it\nin a way that enables him to raise tuition, or to confer the status of\ntenured professor. There\u2019s nothing remotely comparable in\n\u201cthe artworld\u201d\u2014no formal, identifiable set of\ninterlocking rules, roles, relations, and so on constituting an\ninstitution, and so nothing like an institutional token (comparable to\nMarquette University or the Department of the Treasury) with empowered\nindividuals capable of conferring the status of painting, literature,\nor music on objects. What there are are loose collections of people of\nvarious sorts interested in painting, music, and literature. The same\nis true of gardening and cooking, however, and roses and veal cutlets\nneed no social institutions, no \u201cgardenworlds\u201d or\n\u201cfoodworlds\u201d, to be what they are. Neither, Beardsley\nthinks, do paintings, poems, or concertos need social institutions,\nsubdivisions of the \u201cartworld\u201d, to be what they are.\nMuseums, books of poetry, academies of music, and journals of art\ncriticism exist because of a felt need to accommodate, promote,\nexplore, and otherwise reap the benefits of pre-existing, logically\nprior objects known as works of art. And as for practices,\n\n\nDoes it make any sense to speak of acting on behalf of a\npractice? Status-awarding authority can center in an\ninstitutional token, but practices, as such, seem to lack the\nrequisite source of authority. Perhaps the artworld, as Dickie\nconceives it, could not confer status.\u00a0(APV: 134)\n\n\nLast, and independent of the other objections, there is the problem of\ncircularity. Works of art are defined in terms of the artworld; the\nartworld consists of people who have some sort of special doings with\nworks of art. Ultimately, art is defined in terms of itself. To the\nresponse to this\u2014basically, Dickie\u2019s\u2014that the circle\nis large enough to make the definition interesting and informative,\nBeardsley shakes his head in dismay: if works of art are\n\n\nultimately defined in terms of themselves, some important piece of the\ntruth must not have been encompassed in the circle.\u00a0(APV:\n134)\n\n\nAlthough some of these objections apply to Dickie alone, most,\nBeardsley thinks, apply in one form or another to every institutional\ndefinition of art.\n",
