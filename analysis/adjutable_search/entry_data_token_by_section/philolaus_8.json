    "main_text": "Cosmogony and Cosmology || The Birth of the Cosmos\n4.1 The Birth of the Cosmos\n\nFragment 7 is the beginning of Philolaus\u2019 account of the coming to be\nof the cosmos:\n\nThe first thing fitted together, the one in the center of the sphere,\nis called the hearth.\n\n\nAs we would expect from Fragment 1, the world begins with a fitting\ntogether. Fragment 1 also indicates that the fitting together should\ninvolve a limiter and an unlimited. What is fitted together in\nFragment 7 is \u201cthe one in the center of the sphere,\u201d which\nis then called \u201cthe hearth.\u201d From the testimony regarding\nPhilolaus\u2019 astronomical system (see 4.2 below) it is clear that what\nis in the center of Philolaus\u2019 cosmos is the central fire, and surely\nit is the central fire that is called the hearth in Fragment 7. What\nare the limiter and the unlimited from which the central fire is put\ntogether? Fire is the obvious choice as the unlimited element, and it\nis limited by being placed at the center of a sphere. Aristotle tells\nus that the next step was for the nearest part of the unlimited to be\ndrawn in (Metaph. 1091a17), and elsewhere he specifies that\nit is time, breath and the void, which are drawn in from the unlimited\n(Arist., Fr. 201). Evidently then Philolaus first envisaged the\nemergence of a sphere with a fire at its center. As in most\nPresocratic cosmologies, the cosmos is surrounded by an unlimited\nexpanse, and Philolaus\u2019 central fire draws in time, breath and void\nfrom that expanse. Each of these three is itself an unlimited, a\ncontinuum not yet limited in any way. Like many other Presocratics\nPhilolaus drew an analogy between the birth of the cosmos and the\nbirth of a human being. At birth the human embryo, which is hot,\nbreathes in cooling air just as the central fire draws in cooling\nbreath from the unlimited. It may be that the interaction of hot fire\nand cold breath was thought to generate the other prominent stuffs in\nthe world such as earth and water. Void serves to distinguish\nindividual things from each other spatially (Arist., Fr. 201); bits of\nthe central fire were perhaps separated off to form the sun, stars and\nplanets. Time provides the temporal continuum in which the cosmos can\ndevelop and according to which the periods of the planets can be\nmeasured (see Zhmud 1998 for doubts that time should be included in\nthe cosmology but note that Aristotle refers to time outside the\ncosmos not only in Fr. 201 but also at De Caelo 279a12,\nalthough without specifically mentioning the Pythagoreans). Some have\nargued that this cosmogony does not distinguish breath and void, since\nthey are drawn in together, and hence that at least this element of\nthe cosmogony is archaic and dates before Philolaus, since it must\nantedate Anaxagoras, who first made the distinction (Kahn 2001, 37).\nBreath and void are listed separately, however, along with time as\nthree things drawn in, and there is no obvious reason to assume that\nthe first two are being identified. Moreover, breath and void serve\ndifferent functions in the cosmogony (cooling and the spatial\ndifferentiation of objects), so that it appears more likely that they\nare not being equated and that Philolaus developed the cosmogony after\nvoid and air had been first distinguished by Anaxagoras and\nEmpedocles. Fragment 17 provides us with the only further evidence for\nPhilolaus\u2019 cosmogony, asserting again that the cosmos began to come to\nbe at the middle and adding that it developed symmetrically around the\nmiddle. The end of the cosmogony is the astronomical system described\nin section 4.2 below, in which ten heavenly bodies including the earth\nencircle the central fire.\n\nThere is considerable controversy about the role of number in this\ncosmogony. Some scholars argue that the generation of the cosmos is\nalso the generation of numbers and that the central fire is the number\none and other heavenly bodies are identified with other numbers, e.g.,\nthe sun is seven (Kahn 2001, 28; Schibli 1996). Thus, in Fragment 7,\nwhen Philolaus refers to \u201cthe one in the center of the\nsphere,\u201d he is not referring simply to the central fire as the\nfirst unity of limiter and unlimited but also to the number one. The\nstrongest support for this view is Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the\nPythagoreans \u201cclearly state that the one was constructed\u2026\nand then that the nearest part of the unlimited was drawn in\u201d\n(Metaph. 1091a15 ff.). Aristotle is complaining about the\nabsurdity of supposing that there can be a generation of eternal\nthings such as numbers, and he appears to be taking Fr. 7 as a clear\nstatement by the Pythagoreans that the number one is generated. The\ndifficulty with accepting this view is that it seems unintelligible to\nsay that the central fire and the number one are the same thing. It is\nquite plausible to assume that there is an analogy between\nthe central fire as the first thing in the cosmos and the number one\nas the first of the numbers, but the claim is that the number one is\nidentical with the central fire, and it would follow that the number\none is a large fire at the center of the cosmos surrounded by ten\nheavenly bodies. The context of Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the number\none was constructed shows, moreover, that there was considerable\ncontroversy as to whether or not the Pythagoreans were to be\ninterpreted in this way and that Aristotle is taking sides in a\ndebate; he says that \u201cit is not necessary to doubt\u201d his\nassertion, which implies that some have indeed doubted it. \u00a0The\nevidence he cites for his own position appears to be precisely Fr. 7,\nand there seems to have been little clear evidence on the issue;\nAristotle complains that the Pythagoreans do not say of what the\nnumber one is composed and suggests planes, surfaces and seeds as\npossibilities. It thus does not appear that Aristotle was drawing on\nany other more explicit statement than what we find in Fr. 7, and his\nremarks indicate that the interpretation of Fr. 7 was controversial\neven in his own time. None of the other fragments of Philolaus equate\nnumbers with things in this way, and Fr. 5 asserts that things\n\u201cgive signs of\u201d or \u201cpoint to\u201d numbers rather\nthan that they are identical with numbers (see section 3 above). This\nevidence suggests that in Fr. 7 Philolaus is not asserting that the\nnumber one was generated but is instead describing the generation of\nthe first unity of limiter and unlimited, the central fire (Huffman\n1993, 202\u2013215; followed by Zhmud 2012: 400).\n",
