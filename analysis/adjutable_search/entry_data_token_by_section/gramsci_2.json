During that sojourn, he met\nJulija Schucht who in the next year became his wife and, later, mother\nto his two sons.\n\nIn Moscow, Gramsci was absorbed into the bureaucratic complexities of\ninternational communist politics, negotiating with the Comintern over\nthe PCd\u2019I\u2019s relations to other left parties. Events in\nboth Russia and Italy compelled Gramsci to reconsider his position on\nparty tactics. In November, the fourth congress of the Comintern\nagreed that the PCd\u2019I should fuse with the PSI (which, by then,\nhad expelled its own reformists and renewed its links to the\nInternational). In truth, there was little enthusiasm among Italian\ncommunists for this option and no real opportunity after Mussolini had\ntaken power. Leading members of each party (including Bordiga) were\nbeing persecuted by the regime and detained by the police. From\nprison, Bordiga circulated a draft manifesto openly rejecting the\npolicy of fusion, but Gramsci\u2014increasingly concerned at\nBordiga\u2019s open divergence from the Comintern\u2014refused to\nsign it, arguing later that he had \u201ca different conception of\nthe Party\u201d (GTW: 197).\n",
