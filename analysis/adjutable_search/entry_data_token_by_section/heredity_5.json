    "main_text": "Missing Heritability and related philosophical issues arising from GWAS\n6. Looking forward\n\nThe study of heritability has a long and rich history. Many scientific\ndevelopments have led to refined techniques for estimating\nheritability and each of these scientific developments has been the\nfocus of philosophical analysis. In recent\nyears, empirical approaches toward the investigation and construction\nof heritability estimates have undergone great changes, especially\nwith the introduction of GWAS, SNP chips, and SNP heritability. These\nrecent developments are beginning to see more attention from\nphilosophers. At the forefront of debates about SNP heritability is\nthe issue of causation we raised above: are SNPs causal? Bourrat\n(forthcoming) addresses the question of whether SNPs are causal under\nan interventionist framework, but there is more work to be done here.\nMethodologically, twin and heritability and SNP heritability are\nestimated very differently. There is need for more philosophical\nanalysis regarding the nature of heritability and a fine-grained\nperspective of the differences between twin and SNP heritability. In\naddition to philosophical arguments for or against causal\ninterpretations of SNPs and heritability, scientists present their own\ncases, often appealing to sophisticated statistical techniques as\nsufficing for the identification of causal relationships in human\ngenetics. Philosophers could profitably address such\ntechniques\u2014notably Mendelian randomization\u2014with an eye for\nhow they align with broader philosophical frameworks such as alternate\naccounts of causation.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the advent of SNP heritability gives rise to\na new and interesting issue: the missing heritability problem.\nAlthough Matthews and Turkheimer (forthcoming) have considered the\nimplications of the missing heritability problem for debates about\nscientific pluralism, we expect that the implications are broader.\nMore philosophical work here should prove to be productive.\n\nFinally, heritability is unequivocally tethered to bioethics. To the\nextent that twin heritability estimates played a central role in\ndebates about race science from the 70s through the 90s, the advent of\nSNP heritability warrants a renewed assessment. Just as it was for\ntwin heritability, SNP heritability is now being used to assess old,\ncontroversial questions about the genetic basis of racial differences\nin intelligence and cognitive ability. Presumably because twin\nheritability and SNP heritability are conceptually and\nmethodologically distinct, there is demand for philosophers and\nscientists to re-assess the legitimacy of group-difference\ninvestigations that appeal to SNP heritability.\n",
