    "main_text": "\n\nAntoine Arnauld (1612\u20131694) was a powerful figure in the\nintellectual life of seventeenth-century Europe. He had a long and\nhighly controversial career as a theologian, and was an able and\ninfluential philosopher. His writings were published and widely read\nover a period of more than fifty years and were assembled in\n1775\u20131782 in forty-two large folio volumes.\n\nEvaluations of Arnauld\u2019s work as a theologian vary. Ian Hacking,\nfor example, says that Arnauld was \u201cperhaps the most brilliant\ntheologian of his time\u201d (Hacking 1975a, 25). Ronald Knox, on the\nother hand, says, \u201cIt was the fashion among the Jansenists to\nrepresent Antoine Arnauld as a great theologian; he should be\nremembered, rather as a great controversialist\u2026 A theologian by\ntrade, Arnauld was a barrister by instinct\u201d (Knox 1950, 196). It\nis agreed on all sides, however, that Arnauld was acute and learned in\ntheology as well as in philosophy.\n\nArnauld was an important participant in the philosophical debates of\nhis century, and carried out famous intellectual exchanges with\nDescartes, Malebranche, and Leibniz. In addition, the Port-Royal\nLogic, l\u2019Art de penser, which he co-authored with\nPierre Nicole, was a standard text in the field for two centuries.\nLess attention has been paid to Arnauld\u2019s lifelong efforts to\nreconcile the doctrine of gr\u00e2ce efficace par\nelle-m\u00eame with freedom of will, though they have many\nconnections with the debate about determinism and free will that\ncontinues to this day.\n",
