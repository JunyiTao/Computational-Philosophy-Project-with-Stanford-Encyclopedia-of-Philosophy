    "main_text": "Spinoza and the experimental and mathematical sciences || Experimentation\n6.2 Experimentation\n\nSpinoza engaged in very little experimentation of his own, but he did\nshow some interest in the experimental results of others. His letters\ncontain several discussions of experimental and theoretical dioptrics,\nto be expected from a lens grinder and man of letters, as well as\ndiscussions of recent observations of comets and whether they can be\nexplained on Cartesian principles, of the new microscope, and of\nmedical and alchemical experiments. Far and away the most famous and\nsignificant discussion of experimentation are found in his exchanges\nwith Henry Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Royal Society, who\noperated largely as the mouthpiece of Robert Boyle, and in particular\nthose concerning Boyle's experiments on solidity, fluidity, and on\nnitre. The latter of these is the most telling of Spinoza's attitude\ntowards the relevance of experiment to theorizing about nature. Boyle\nhad claimed to show that nitre (potassium nitrate) is a chemical\ncompound rather than a mixture, by having decomposed it into fixed and\nvolatile parts (potash and spirit of nitre), and then recombining them\ninto nitre with little or no loss of quantity. The disparate\nproperties of the components, he argued, showed that the nitre itself\nwas a compound, in which the components were altered and transformed,\nrather than a mere mixture. This, in turn, suggested that the basic\nconstituents of the components were preserved through the interaction,\nconfirming the corpuscular chemical theory over the scholastic view\nthat chemical transformation involves the substantial form of given\nmatter being destroyed and replaced by some other substantial\nform.\n\nSpinoza in fact agrees with Boyle that the scholastic view is\nbankrupt, but he rejects Boyle's claim that the separation of the\nnitre into two parts is actually a decomposition of a distinctive\nsubstance into two others; rather, he claims that the experiment is\nconsistent with the Cartesian view, itself based on reason, that\ndifferentiations among extended substance are always owing to\ndifferent quantities of motion and rest. He claimed that the\n\u201dfixed nitre\u201c (potash) was actually an impurity mixed into\nthe original sample, and that the spirit of nitre was simply the\nvolatile state of the pure, crystallized nitre portion of the original\nmix. Thus the different chemical properties of spirit of nitre and the\noriginal sample owe not to a difference of substantial\nstructure\u2014the basic shape of the particles of each is the\nsame\u2014but to a difference in their motion. In support of this\nreading and against Boyle's interpretation, Spinoza claimed that, if\nBoyle were actually to show what he claimed, \u201dfurther experiment\nseems to be required to show that Spirit of Nitre is not really Nitre,\nand cannot be reduced to solid state or crystallized without the help\nof salt of lye\u201c (Letters, p. 71). Spinoza then went on at some\nlength to show how, in the absence of such a demonstration, it is easy\nenough to explain the results of Boyle's experiments along Cartesian\nlines. He further explains several experiments he himself performed\nwhich he takes to support the Cartesian interpretation, claiming that\nhe \u201dmight have added further experiments which would perhaps\nmake the matter quite clear\u201c (Letters, p. 76).\n\nWhat matters here is not who is right in this dispute, nor whether\nSpinoza's Cartesian view is in fact coherent, but Spinoza's strategy.\nFor it is hardly an evenhanded assessment of the experimental results.\nSpinoza shows considerable ingenuity in interpreting the results of\nBoyle's own experiments to be consistent with the Cartesian view, and\nhis own as (nearly, anyway) proof positive of it. But he shows no\ninclination to pursue the question whether his own experimental\nresults can be interpreted along the lines of Boyle's hypothesis,\nwhich they can be, easily enough, as Boyle's response (letter 11)\nshows. Indeed, Boyle complains overall that Spinoza's interpretations\nof the experimental results are wholly driven by Cartesian theory,\nrather than a fair attempt to adjudicate between the two alternatives.\nFor example, far from proving the need for the \u201dvery fine\nmatter\u201c of Cartesian physics, this conclusion has been\n\u201dassumed\u201c, by Spinoza, \u201dsimply from the hypothesis\nof the impossibility of a vacuum\u201c. In other aspects of his\ninterpretation, claims Boyle, Spinoza \u2018presupposes Descartes'\ntheory of fire\u201d. Now Boyle's readings of the experimental data\nare hardly less theory driven than are Spinoza's. But where they\ndiffer strategically is in the fact that since the Cartesian theory\nthat drives Spinoza's interpretations is derived by the method of pure\nrational reflection on perceptions that are a priori clear\nand distinct, Spinoza clearly grants it a privileged standing in the\ncourt of experimentation. On his view, to prove a conclusion that is\nat odds with one dictated by reason itself, like Descartes', one has\nto establish impossibility experimentally\u2014which cannot,\nof course, be done. So long as it is possible to interpret results as\nconsistent with a theory determined by rational reflection alone,\nthose results cannot weigh at all against the theory. Yet experimental\nresults that conform to rationally determined theory confirm it.\n\nIndeed, where there are properly philosophical arguments to be had for\na thesis, experimentation is superfluous. In assessing Boyle's\nexperiments designed to prove that all tangible properties depend on\nthe mechanical features of objects, Spinoza wonders why Boyle\nbothered, since this conclusion \u201chas already been abundantly\nproved by Verulam, and later Descartes\u201d. (Letter 6). Descartes\nhad proved this a priori from the fact that the sole nature\nof body is extension, whose sole attributes are size, shape and\nmotion. Moreover, ordinary, mundane observations offer as good proof\nas any that might be afforded by controlled observation. Boyle's\ncareful experiments could not add any weight to the evidence already\navailable from such ordinary phenomena as the facts that even cold\nsticks will spark a fire when rubbed together, that water makes sound\nwhen it comes to a moving boil, and that stirring and warming foul\nsmelling bodies make them smell yet worse. Spinoza's attitude towards\nexperimental observation seems to be, then, that it can have no weight\nagainst a theory based in sound a priori philosophical intuition and\ngeometrical demonstration, and is easy available, though not\nnecessary, to confirm the results of such pure theorizing.\nExperimentation can help us discover new phenomena, but it cannot help\nus to prove any scientific propositions we do not already know to be\ntrue. As Gabbey (1996) puts it, experimentation \u201ccannot uncover\nthe nature of things; sensory knowledge belongs to the imagination,\nthe knowledge of essences and causes to the intellect alone\u201d\n(Gabbey 1996, p. 171).\n",
