    "main_text": "Proofs for the existence of God (Allah) || An argument from temporal coming-to-be (hud\u016bth)\n2.1 An argument from temporal coming-to-be (hud\u016bth)\n\nMuslim theologians, that is, proponents of kal\u0101m, and even\ncertain philosophers like as Ab\u016b Y\u016bsuf al-Kind\u012b (d. ca.\n866), had several arguments for the existence of God, all of which in\nsome way appeal temporal coming-to-be (see, for example,\nAsh\u02bfar\u012b TAAT: 6\u20138; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n9\u201316; Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 27\u201341;\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b Summa, 1\u201325) and which fall under\nthe umbrella expression, \u2018kal\u0101m cosmological\nargument\u2019. William Lane Craig has defended and brought to the\nattention of contemporary philosophers of religion the kal\u0101m\ncosmological argument (see section in entry on\n cosmological arguments).\n In its simplest form, the argument runs like this:\n\nEverything that begins to exist after not having\nexisted has a cause for its existence.\nThe world began to exist after not having\nexisted.\nTherefore, the world has a cause for its\nexistence, which is God.\n\n\nPremise (1)\n is just a particular instance of the general principle that nothing\ncomes from nothing. Within the medieval Islamic world, the principle\nis associated with the notion of preponderation\n(tarj\u012b\u1e25), which at least within the context of the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, states that for any action, motion\nor change some cause or reason exist for that action or change.\n\nThe more controversial premise is\n (2),\n for unlike the theologians, certain philosophers, like\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd, maintained\nthat the world has existed infinitely into the past. Consequently,\nthese philosophers reject the world\u2019s coming to exist after some\npoint of not having existed. The theologians\u2019 response was\neither simply to claim that the intellect asserts that the existence\nof an infinity is rationally impossible or to show that positing an\ninfinity leads to consequences known to be rationally impossible.\nThose who took the latter strategy drew upon the arguments of the late\nNeoplatonic Christian philosopher, John Philoponus (d. 570; see entry\non\n Philoponus).\n Two examples should provide a sense of the general strategy.\n\nFirst, according to the astronomy of the time, the world consists of\nthe Earth, which was thought to be (approximately) at the center of\nthe cosmos, and the various celestial bodies\u2014the Moon, Sun, five\nvisible planets and stars\u2014that were believed to orbit the Earth.\nNow, assume that the world has existed infinitely into the past. In\nthat case, the various celestial bodies that apparently orbit the\nEarth would have all made an infinite number of revolutions; however,\nthe celestial bodies have different periods. For instance, the Moon\norbits the earth approximately once a month, that is, twelve times a\nyear, while the apparent revolution of the Sun is only once a year.\nConsequently, while the Sun has made an infinite number of apparent\nrevolutions around the Earth, the Moon has made twelve times the\nrotations of the Sun, that is, twelve times infinity, and so seemingly\na greater number than that of the Sun. Since it is assumed that there\nis nothing greater than infinity, reason recoils at the notion of a\nnumber greater than that which nothing is greater. The theologians,\nthen, conclude that the assumption of the world\u2019s existing\ninfinitely into the past leads to absurdity and so must be\nrejected.\n\nPhilosophers who accepted the eternity of the world rejected this\nargument, claiming that the infinity in question is only a potential\ninfinity and not an actual one, that is, one in which all the members\nof an actually infinite set would presently exist. As such, they\ncontinued, there does not exist actual sets of revolutions that can be\ncompared, which had led to the absurdity. The theologians\u2019\nsecond kind of argument cuts off this form of escape. First, they note\nthat for the philosophers, species are eternal, that is, for example,\nthere have always existed human into the infinite past and there will\nalways exists humans into the infinite future. They then continue that\nthe leading philosophers, like Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, believe that they\nhave demonstrated that the human soul continues to exist after the\ndeath of the\n body.[2]\n In that case, if the world together with the human species existed\ninfinitely into the past, then even if only one human a day were to\ndie, there would presently and actually exist an infinite number of\nhuman souls, and that number would increase infinitely as humans died\nmoving into the infinite future. In short, the distinction between\npotential and actual infinities does not save the philosophers from\nthe purportedly absurd consequences. Thus, the assumption that the\nworld has existed infinitely into the past must be rejected.\nConsequently, the world must have begun to exist after not having\nexisted, and so the second premise of the kal\u0101m cosmological\nargument is secured.\n\nWe set aside the philosophers\u2019 defense(s) of the thesis that the\nworld always has existed infinitely into the past and merely note that\nthis issue was one of the most vigorously debated one between\ntheologians and philosophers in the Islamicate world.\n",
