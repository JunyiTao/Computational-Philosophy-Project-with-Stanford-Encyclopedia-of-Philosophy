    "main_text": "Clarifications || Structure\n1.3 Structure\n\nMuch of what was said above about the need to constrain what counts as\nmeaning applies to structure as well. Janssen (1983) has a proof that we can turn\nany meaning assignment on a recursively enumerable set of expressions\ninto a compositional one, as long as we can replace the syntactic\noperations with different ones. If we insist\u2014as we\nshould\u2014that any acceptable semantic theory must respect what\nsyntax tells us about the structure of complex expressions, this\nresult says nothing about the possibility of providing an adequate\ncompositional semantics; cf. Westerst\u00e5hl\n 1998.[8]\n The moral of the result is that although commitment to\ncompositionality requires allegiance to no particular sect of\nsyntacticians, one cannot be oblivious to syntactic evidence in\nsemantic theorizing.\n\n(C)\n does not require the kind of tight correspondence between syntax and\nsemantics we intuitively associate with compositionality. To\nillustrate this, consider a view, according to which the meaning of a\ndeclarative sentence s is the set of possible worlds where\ns is true. According to such a view, tautologies are\nsynonymous, even though (since Rudolf presumably has some tautological\nbeliefs and lacks others) sentences resulting from embedding\ntautologies under \u2018Rudolf believes that\u2026\u2019 are not.\n(I also assume a straightforward semantics for propositional attitudes\nwithout hidden indexicals or tacit quantification.) Intuitively, this\nis a violation of compositionality. Still, the semantics is\nnot in conflict with\n (C):\n tautologies might differ structurally or in the meaning of their\nconstituents, which could explain how their embedding can yield\nnon-synonymous sentences; cf. Carnap 1947 and Lewis 1970.\n\nTo rule a semantic theory like this one non-compositional, we need to\ndemand that the meaning of a complex expression be determined by its\nimmediate structure, and the meanings of its\nimmediate constituents. (The immediate structure of an\nexpression is the syntactic mode its immediate constituents are\ncombined. e is an immediate constituent of \\(e'\\) iff e\nis a constituent of \\(e'\\) and \\(e'\\) has no constituent of which\ne is a constituent.)\n\n(C\\(_{\\textit{local}}\\))For\nevery\ncomplex expression e in L, the meaning of e in\nL is determined by the immediate structure of e in\nL and the meanings of the immediate constituents of e in\nL.\n\n\nCall the strengthened principle local compositionality, and\n (C)\nglobal compositionality; when unqualified,\n\u2018compositionality\u2019 should be taken as global. The local\nprinciple is more intuitive, and semanticists frequently presuppose\nit. In fact, some theorists assume not only\n(C\\(_{\\textit{local}}\\)),\nbut also that concatenation is uniformly interpreted as functional\napplication, or perhaps as conjunction; cf. Pietroski (2005, 2012).\nOthers insist that the relevant notion of structure\n(C\\(_{\\textit{local}}\\)) appeals to is the one apparent on the surface\nof sentences, and accordingly, our syntax should not postulate\nmovement or empty elements; cf. Jacobson (2002, 2012). Clearly, appeal\nto our ability to understand novel expressions in itself provides no\ndirect support for these strong claims.\n",
