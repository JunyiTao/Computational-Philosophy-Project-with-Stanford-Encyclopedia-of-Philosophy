    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nZhu Xi was born in Youqi in Fujian in October 1130. Many anecdotes\nattest that he was a highly precocious child. It was recorded that at\nage five he ventured to ask what lay beyond Heaven, and by eight he\nunderstood the significance of the Classic of Filiality\n(Xiaojing). As a youth, he was inspired by Mencius\u2019\nproposition that all people could become a sage. In Zhu Xi\u2019s\nchildhood, his father Zhu Song (1097\u20131143) arranged for several\nold friends to educate Zhu Xi after his passing. Consequently, Zhu Xi\nwas educated by several eclectic scholars who had delved into Daoism\nand Buddhism as well as Confucianism, and inclined him to be deep and\nwide-ranging in his intellectual predilections and cultural interests.\nLater he studied Chan (Zen) Buddhism with the monk Dao Qian of the\nKaishan Temple, and reputedly met with the Chan master Da Hui (Dahui\nZonggao,\n 1089\u20131163).[2]\n Traces of Huayan\u2019s holistic thought can also be discerned in\nthe formation of Zhu Xi\u2019s system (Makeham 2018). Remarkably, Zhu\npassed the official jinshi exam (the \u201cpresented\nscholar\u201d exam) at just nineteen, drawing on Chan Buddhism in his\n answers.[3]\n He continued to pursue Daoism and Buddhism until he met the\nNeo-Confucian master Li Tong (1093\u20131163) a decade later, and\nformally became his student in 1160. In fact, Zhu\u2019s father had\nrecommended that he conduct his advanced studies under Li Tong, but\nZhu postponed seeing Li for years until he finally admitted to himself\nthat he was no longer making progress in his eclectic cultivation and\nsuffered spiritual doubts. Li Tong was a master in the southern Yang\nShi (1053\u20131135) lineage of the Cheng brothers\u2019 school,\npartial to the teachings of Cheng Yi. Importantly, Li Tong convinced\nZhu of the cogency and superiority of the Confucian Way and\ncultivation. Meanwhile, having passed the jinshi examination,\nZhu was eligible to hold office, and had been assigned to several\nprefectural administrative posts. But, since he disagreed with central\ncourt policy on several major issues, he preferred to hold temple\nguardianships, which gave him the leisure to conduct Confucian studies\nand cultivation in earnest, and shielded him from the ruthless court\npolitics. Having chosen this career path, Zhu Xi had the leisure to\nstudy and reflect, so over time he made numerous contributions in\nclassical studies, historical inquiries, literary studies, and\nphilosophic reflections. He moreover developed into a man of letters\nand wrote subtle prose and elegant verse.\n\nA renowned teacher in later life, Zhu taught the classics and\nNeo-Confucian thought and practice to hundreds if not thousands of\nstudents. His oral discourses and discussions are preserved in the\nClassified Dialogues of Master Zhu (Zhuzi yulei),\nand his poetry, essays, correspondence, and other prose works are\ncollected in the Collected Works of Master Zhu (Zhuzi\nwenji). He also published critical, annotated editions of several\nclassics, including the Book of Change (Yijing) and\nthe Book of Odes (Shijing), essential works of\nNeo-Confucianism, including by Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai, and the Cheng\nbrothers, and a vital Neo-Confucian anthology, Reflections on\nThings at Hand (Jinsilu). He also edited and annotated\nan important early text of inner alchemy Daoism; the Cantong\nqi (Unity of the Three) by Wei Boyang (3rd\ncent. CE), which combines the cosmology of the Yijing and the\nDaoist teaching of wuwei (non-intentional action) with inner\nalchemy. Zhu Xi remained devoted to his spiritual and intellectual\nwork virtually to his last breath, pondering and discussing\nproblematic passages in the Great Learning during the last\nseveral days of his life. Throughout his life, Zhu Xi sought to\nreestablish the fundamental concepts and values of Confucianism to\nrestore China\u2019s cultural and political integrity as a Confucian\nsociety, especially since people in search of spiritual guidance and\nsolace were increasingly looking to Daoism and Buddhism rather than\nConfucianism, which was perceived as a state ideology and orthodoxy\nand had lost spiritual and ethical purchase. Moreover, Zhu believed\nthat the empire needed the spiritual \u00e9lan of\nConfucius\u2019 original ethical ideas and values to meet the\nchallenge of barbarian encroachments. His own sincere patriotism,\ncommitment to the tradition, and devotion to learning and scholarship\nhave remained an inspiration to this day in East Asia and throughout\nthe world.\n",
