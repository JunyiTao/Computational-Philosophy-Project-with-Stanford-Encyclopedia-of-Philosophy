    "main_text": "Two Dimensional Semantics\n10. Two Dimensional Semantics\n\nTwo-dimensional semantics is a variant of possible world semantics\nthat uses two (or more) kinds of parameters in truth evaluation,\nrather than possible worlds alone. For example, a logic of indexical\nexpressions, such as \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, and the like, needs to bring in the linguistic\ncontext (or context for short). Given a context \\(c = \\langle s, p,\nt\\rangle\\) where \\(s\\) is the speaker, \\(p\\) the place, and \\(t\\) the\ntime of utterance, then \u2018I\u2019 refers to \\(s\\),\n\u2018here\u2019 to \\(p\\), and \u2018now\u2019 to \\(t\\). So in the\ncontext \\(c = \\langle\\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on\n4/3/\\(2014\\rangle\\) \u2018I am here now\u2019 is T iff Jim Garson is\nin Houston, at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014.\n\nIn possible worlds semantics, a sentence\u2019s truth-value depended\non the world at which it is evaluated. However, indexicals bring in a\nsecond dimension \u2013 so we need to generalize again. Kaplan (1989)\ndefines the character of a sentence \\(B\\) to be a function\nfrom the set of (linguistic) contexts to the content of \\(B\\), where\nthe content, in turn, is simply the intension of \\(B\\), that is, a\nfunction from possible worlds to truth-values. Here, truth evaluation\nis doubly dependent \u2013 on both linguistic contexts and possible\nworlds.\n\nOne of Kaplan\u2019s most interesting observations is that some\nindexical sentences are contingent but at the same time analytically\ntrue. An example is (1).\n\n(1)  I am here now.\n\n\n\nJust from the meaning of the words, you can see that (1) must be true\nin any context \\(c = \\langle s, p, t\\rangle\\). After all, \\(c\\) counts\nas a linguistic context just in case \\(s\\) is a speaker who is at\nplace \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\). Therefore (1) is true at \\(c\\), and that\nmeans that the pattern of truth-values (1) has along the context\ndimension must be all Ts (given the possible world is held fixed).\nThis suggests that the context dimension is apt for tracking analytic\nknowledge obtained from the mastery of our language. On the other\nhand, the possible-worlds dimension keeps track of what is necessary.\nHolding the context fixed, there there are possible worlds where (1)\nis false. For example, when \\(c = \\langle\\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00\nP.M. CST on 4/3/\\(2014\\rangle\\), (1) fails at \\(c\\) in a possible\nworld where Jim Garson is in Boston at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. It\nfollows that \u2018I am here now\u2019 is a contingent analytic\ntruth. Therefore, two-dimensional semantics can handle situations\nwhere necessity and analyticity come apart.\n\nAnother example where bringing in two dimension is useful is in the\nlogic for an open future (Thomason, 1984; Belnap, et al., 2001). Here\none employs a temporal structure where many possible future histories\nextend from a given time. Consider (2).\n\n(2)  Joe will order a\nsea battle tomorrow. \n\n\nIf (2) is contingent, then there is a possible history where the\nbattle occurs the day after the time of evaluation and another one\nwhere it does not occur then. So to evaluate (2) you need to know two\nthings: what is the time \\(t\\) of evaluation, and which of the\nhistories \\(h\\) that run through \\(t\\) is the one to be considered. So\na sentence in such a logic is evaluated at a pair \\(\\langle t,\nh\\rangle\\).\n\nAnother problem resolved by two-dimensional semantics is the\ninteraction between \u2018now\u2019 and other temporal expressions\nlike the future tense \u2018it will be the case that\u2019. It is\nplausible to think that \u2018now\u2019 refers to the time of\nevaluation. So we would have the following truth condition:\n\n\\[\\tag{Now}\nv(\\text{Now} B, t)=\\mathrm{T} \\text{ iff } v(B, t)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nHowever this will not work for sentences like (3).\n\n(3)  At some point in\nthe future, everyone now living will be unknown. \n\n\nWith \\(\\mathrm{F}\\) as the future tense operator, (3) might be\ntranslated: \n\\[\\tag{\\(3'\\)}\n\\mathrm{F}\\forall x(\\text{Now} Lx \\rightarrow Ux).\n\\]\n\n\n(The correct translation cannot be \\(\\forall x(\\text{Now} Lx\n\\rightarrow \\mathrm{F}Ux)\\), with \\(\\mathrm{F}\\) taking narrow scope,\nbecause (3) says there is a future time when all things now living are\nunknown together, not that each living thing will be unknown in some\nfuture time of its own.) When the truth conditions for (3)\\('\\) are\ncalculated, using (Now) and the truth condition (\\(\\mathrm{F}\\)) for\n\\(\\mathrm{F}\\), it turns out that (3)\\('\\) is true at time \\(u\\) iff\nthere is a time \\(t\\) after \\(u\\) such that everything that is living\nat \\(t\\) (not \\(u\\)!) is unknown at \\(t\\). \n\\[\\tag{F}\nv(\\mathrm{F}B, t)=\\mathrm{T} \\text{ iff for some time } u\n \\text{ later than } t, v(B, u)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nTo evaluate (3)\\('\\) correctly, so that it matches what we mean by\n(3), we must make sure that \u2018now\u2019 always refers back to\nthe original time of utterance when \u2018now\u2019 lies in the\nscope of other temporal operators such as F. Therefore we need to keep\ntrack of which time is the time of utterance \\((u)\\) as well as which\ntime is the time of evaluation \\((t)\\). So our indices take the form\nof a pair \\(\\langle u, e\\rangle\\), where \\(u\\) is the time of\nutterance, and \\(e\\) is the time of evaluation. Then the truth\ncondition (Now) is revised to (2DNow). \n\\[\\tag{2DNow}\nv(\\text{Now} B, \\langle u, e\\rangle)=\\mathrm{T}\n \\text{ iff } v(B, \\langle u, u\\rangle)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nThis has it that the Now\\(B\\) is true at a time \\(u\\) of utterance and\ntime \\(e\\) of evaluation provided that \\(B\\) is true when \\(u\\) is\ntaken to be the time of evaluation. When the truth conditions for F,\n\\(\\forall\\), and \\(\\rightarrow\\) are revised in the obvious way (just\nignore the \\(u\\) in the pair), (3)\\('\\) is true at \\(\\langle u,\ne\\rangle\\) provided that there is a time \\(e'\\) later than \\(e\\) such\nthat everything that is living at \\(u\\) is unknown at \\(e'\\). By\ncarrying along a record of what \\(u\\) is during the truth calculation,\nwe can always fix the value for \u2018now\u2019 to the original time\nof utterance, even when \u2018now\u2019 is deeply embedded in other\ntemporal operators.\n\nA similar phenomenon arises in modal logics with an actuality operator\nA (read \u2018it is actually the case that\u2019). To properly\nevaluate (4) we need to keep track of which world is taken to be the\nactual (or real) world as well as which one is taken to be the world\nof evaluation.\n\n(4)  It is possible\nthat everyone actually living be unknown. \n\n\nThe idea of distinguishing different possible world dimensions in\nsemantics has had useful applications in philosophy. For example,\nChalmers (1996) has presented arguments from the conceivability of\n(say) zombies to dualist conclusions in the philosophy of mind.\nChalmers (2006) has deployed two-dimensional semantics to help\nidentify an a priori aspect of meaning that would support such\nconclusions.\n\nThe idea has also been deployed in the philosophy of language. Kripke\n(1980) famously argued that \u2018Water is H2O\u2019 is a posteriori\nbut nevertheless a necessary truth, for given that water just is H20,\nthere is no possible world where THAT stuff is (say) a basic element\nas the Greeks thought. On the other hand, there is a strong intuition\nthat had the real world been somewhat different from what it is, the\nodorless liquid that falls from the sky as rain, fills our lakes and\nrivers, etc. might perfectly well have been an element. So in some\nsense it is conceivable that water is not H20. Two dimensional\nsemantics makes room for these intuitions by providing a separate\ndimension that tracks a conception of water that lays aside the\nchemical nature of what water actually is. Such a \u2018narrow\ncontent\u2019 account of the meaning of \u2018water\u2019 can\nexplain how one may display semantical competence in the use of that\nterm and still be ignorant about the chemistry of water (Chalmers,\n2002).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n two-dimensional semantics.\n",
