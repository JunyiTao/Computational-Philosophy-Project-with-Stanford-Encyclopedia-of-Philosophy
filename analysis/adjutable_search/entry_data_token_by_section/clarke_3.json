    "main_text": "Major Themes in Clarke || Newtonianism and Anti-Naturalism\n2.1 Newtonianism and Anti-Naturalism\n\nThere is a widespread agreement that Newton influenced Clarke. Newton\nwas thirty years Clarke\u2019s senior, and their relationship (post-1704)\nmight best be thought of as a mentorship. Newton and Clarke likely\nheld similar views about God\u2019s role in the world, but Newton was\nhesitant to state these positions publicly, and he may have used the\nBoyle lectures to promote these views (Force 1984; 522\u2013526).\nMany have thought he supported Clarke\u2019s interpretations and\ndefenses on matters scientific and also theological (Jacob 1976; 242).\nIn private correspondence, such as the letters to Bentley of December\n10, 1692, and January 17, 1693, he entertains views similar to those\nthat Clarke would later proclaim. Whiston (1728) reports that when\nasked why he did not publicly announce them, Newton said, \u201cHe\nsaw those Consequences; but thought it better to let his Readers draw\nthem first of themselves,\u201d at least until the \u201cGeneral\nScholium\u201d was published in later editions of the\nPrincipia. However, it is also possible that Clarke\ninfluenced Newton. Newton, at least, endorsed publicly views that had\nbeen previously published by Clarke, especially in the \u201cGeneral\nScholium\u201d of 1713, which was seen to endorse Clarkean arguments\nabout the nature of God (Stewart 1996; Snobelen 2001, 14\u201318).\n\nOn scientific, philosophical, and especially theological grounds,\nClarke believed Newtonian natural philosophy to be superior to all\nalternatives. Clarke saw in Newtonianism a world that could only exist\nby a free act of God. Matter is dispersed sparingly throughout empty\nspace, gravity is universal to matter but not inherent in it, and the\nuniverse is ordered according to rules that are neither absolutely\nnecessary nor chaotic. Clarke concluded that the laws of nature do not\ndescribe the powers of matter, which is just dead mass constantly\npushed around, but modalities of operation of the divine power.\nClarke\u2019s position is similar to that of the occasionalists, who\nalso denied that matter had the power to move itself and that the only\nthing with such power is God. Matter has no power of self-motion, so\nto explain motion, one must appeal to immaterial souls (divine and\nhuman). Thus, nature is not a self-sufficient system; without direct\nand constant divine physical intervention planets would fly away from\ntheir orbits and atoms would break into their components. Thus, the\nnaturalist attempt to describe the world solely by the arrangement and\nmatter in motion is doomed to failure on scientific and metaphysical\ngrounds and must give way to a world with an active God. This is why\n\u201cthe foundations of natural religion had never been so deeply\nand firmly laid, as in the mathematical and experimental philosophy of\nthat great man\u201d (W4.582). Newton\u2019s natural philosophy could\nthus be the argumentative basis for Clarke\u2019s preferred religious and\nsocial views (Stewart 1981).\n\nFor three decades, Clarke was the leading voice on the metaphysical\nand theological implications of Newtonianism, confirmed when Newton\nhimself seemed to endorsed publicly the fundamentals of Clarke\u2019s\ninterpretation in the revisions to the Principia.\n",
