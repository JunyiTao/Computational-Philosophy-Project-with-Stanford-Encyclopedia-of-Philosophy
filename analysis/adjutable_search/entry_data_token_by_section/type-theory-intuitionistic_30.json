    "main_text": "Variants of the Theory || Univalent Foundations and Homotopy Type Theory\n7.2 Univalent Foundations and Homotopy Type Theory\nUnivalent foundations refer to Voevodsky\u2019s programme for a new\nfoundation of mathematics based on intuitionistic type theory and\nemploying ideas from homotopy theory. Here every type \\(A\\) is\nconsidered as a space, and the identity type \\(\\I(A,a,b)\\) is the space\nof paths from point \\(a\\) to point \\(b\\) in \\(A\\). Iterated identity types represent higher homotopies, e.g.\n\n \\[\\I(\\I(A,a,b),f,g)\\]\n\nis the space of homotopies between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\).\nThe notion of\nordinary set can be thought of as a discrete space \\(A\\) where\nall paths in \\(\\I(A,a,b)\\) are trivial loops.\n\n\nThe origin of these ideas\nwas the remarkable discovery by (Hofmann and Streicher 1998) that the axioms of\nintensional type theory do not force all proofs of an identity to be equal, that is, not all paths need to be trivial. This was\nshown by a model construction where each type is interpreted as a\ngroupoid. \n\nFurther connections between identity\ntypes and notions from homotopy theory and higher categories were\nsubsequently discovered by (Awodey and Warren 2009), (Lumsdaine 2010), and\n(van den Berg and Garner 2011). Voevodsky realized that the whole intensional intuitionistic type\ntheory could be modelled by a well-known category studied in homotopy\ntheory, namely the Kan simplicial sets. Inspired by this model he\nintroduced the univalence axiom. For a universe\n\\(\\U\\) of small types, this axiom states that the substitution map associated with\nthe \\(J\\)-operator\n\n\\[\\I(\\U,a,b) \\longrightarrow \\T(a) \\cong \\T(b)\\]\n\n\nis an equivalence. Equivalence (\\(\\cong\\)) here refers to a general notion of\nequivalence of higher dimensional objects, as in the\nsequence equal elements, isomorphic sets, equivalent groupoids,\nbiequivalent bigroupoids, etc. The univalence axiom expresses\nthat \u201ceverything is preserved by equivalence\u201d, thereby\nrealizing the informal categorical slogan that all categorical\nconstructions are preserved by isomorphism, and its generalization,\nthat all constructions of categories are preserved by equivalence of\ncategories, etc.\nThe axiom of univalence was originally justified by\nVoevodsky\u2019s simplical set model. This model is however not\nconstructive and (Bezem, Coquand and Huber 2014 [2013]) has more\nrecently proposed a model in Kan cubical sets.\nAlthough univalent foundations concern preservation of mathematical\nstructure in general, strongly inspired by category theory,\napplications within homotopy theory are particularly actively\ninvestigated. Intensional type theory extended with the univalence\naxiom and so called higher inductive types is therefore also called\n\u201chomotopy type theory\u201d. We refer to the entry on\n type theory for further details.\n",
