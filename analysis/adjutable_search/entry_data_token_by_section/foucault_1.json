    "main_text": "Intellectual Background\n2. Intellectual Background\n\nWe begin, however, with a sketch of the philosophical environment in\nwhich Foucault was educated. He entered the \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure (the standard launching pad for major French\nphilosophers) in 1946, during the heyday of existential phenomenology.\nMerleau-Ponty, whose lectures he attended, was a particularly\nimportant influence. Foucault shared Merleau-Ponty\u2019s interest in\nthe limits of language and expression, and in Saussure\u2019s\nstructuralist account of linguistic sense. Heidegger, Hegel and Marx\nwere also major interests, Hegel through the interpretation of his\nwork offered by Jean Hyppolite and Marx through the structuralist\nreading of Louis Althusser\u2014both teachers who had a strong impact\non Foucault at the \u00c9cole Normale. It is not surprising that\nFoucault\u2019s earliest works (his long \u201cIntroduction\u201d\nto Jacqueline Verdeaux\u2019 French translation of Traum und\nExistenz by Ludwig Binswanger, a Heideggerian psychiatrist, and\nMaladie mentale et personnalit\u00e9, a short book on\nmental illness) were written in the grip of, respectively,\nexistentialism and Marxism. But he soon turned away from both.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, working outside the University system, had no\npersonal influence on Foucault. But, as the French master-thinker of\nthe previous generation, he is always in the background. Similar to\nSartre, Foucault\u2019s work is characterized by deep antipathy for\nbourgeois society and culture and sympathy for marginalized groups\nsuch as the mad, homosexuals, and prisoners. They both also had strong\ninterests in literature and psychology as well as philosophy, and\nboth, after an early relative lack of political interest, became\ncommitted activists. But in the end, Foucault seemed to insist on\ndefining himself in contradiction to Sartre. Philosophically, he\nrejected what he saw as Sartre\u2019s privileging of the individual\nsubject as the starting point of all his analyses (which Foucault\nmocked as \u201ctranscendental narcissism\u201d). Personally and\npolitically, Foucault rejected Sartre\u2019s role as what he called a\n\u201cuniversal intellectual,\u201d judging society by appeals to\nuniversal moral principles, such as the inviolability of individual\nfreedom. There is, however, more than a hint of protesting too much in\nFoucault\u2019s rejection of Sartre, and the question of the relation\nof their work remains a fertile one.\n\nThree other factors were of much more positive significance for the\nyoung Foucault. First, there was the French tradition of history and\nphilosophy of science, particularly as represented by Georges\nCanguilhem, a powerful figure in the French University establishment,\nwhose work in the history and philosophy of biology provided a model\nfor much of Foucault\u2019s work in the history of the human\nsciences. Canguilhem sponsored Foucault\u2019s doctoral thesis on the\nhistory of madness and, throughout Foucault\u2019s career, remained\none of his most important and effective supporters. Canguilhem\u2019s\napproach to the history of science (an approach developed from the\nwork of Gaston Bachelard), provided Foucault with a strong sense (in\nsome ways Kuhnian avant la lettre, see entry on\n scientific revolutions, section 5.3)\n of the discontinuities in scientific history, along with a\n\u201crationalist\u201d understanding of the historical role of\nconcepts that made them independent of the phenomenologists\u2019\ntranscendental consciousness. Foucault found this understanding\nreinforced in the structuralist linguistics and psychology developed,\nrespectively, by Ferdinand de Saussure and Jacques Lacan, as well as\nin Georges Dum\u00e9zil\u2019s proto-structuralist work on\ncomparative religion. These anti-subjective standpoints provide the\ncontext for Foucault\u2019s marginalization of the subject in his\n\u201cstructuralist histories\u201d, The Birth of the\nClinic (on the origins of modern medicine) and The Order of\nThings (on the origins of the modern human sciences).\n\nIn a quite different vein, Foucault was enthralled by French\navant-garde literature, especially the writings of Georges Bataille\nand Maurice Blanchot, where he found the experiential concreteness of\nexistential phenomenology without what he came to see as dubious\nphilosophical assumptions about subjectivity. Of particular interest\nwas this literature\u2019s evocation of\n\u201climit-experiences,\u201d which push us to extremes where\nconventional categories of intelligibility begin to break down.\n\nThis philosophical milieu provided materials for the critique of\nsubjectivity and the corresponding \u201carchaeological\u201d and\n\u201cgenealogical\u201d methods of writing history that inform\nFoucault\u2019s projects of historical critique, to which we now\nturn.\n",
