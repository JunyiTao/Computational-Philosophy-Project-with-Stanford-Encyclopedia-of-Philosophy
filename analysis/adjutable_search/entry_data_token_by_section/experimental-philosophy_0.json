    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nExperimental philosophy is a relatively new approach, usually\nunderstood as beginning only in the early years of the 21st century.\nAt the heart of this new approach is the idea of pursuing\nphilosophical questions using methods more typically associated with\nthe social sciences.\n\nWithin the broad banner of experimental philosophy research, one finds\nwork using an enormous variety of methods and aims (see, e.g.,\nSchwitzgebel & Rust 2014; Meskin et al. 2013; Bartels &\nUrminsky 2011). Nonetheless, most research in experimental philosophy\nmakes use of a collection of closely connected methods that in some\nway involve the study of intuitions. The remainder of this section\naims to characterize the different projects experimental philosophers\nhave pursued using these methods and their relevance for broader\nquestions in philosophy.\n\nThe practice of exploring intuitions has its origins in a more\ntraditional philosophical approach that long predates the birth of\nexperimental philosophy (see the entry on\n intuition).\n Research within this more traditional approach often relies on the\nidea that we can make progress on one or another topic by looking at\nintuitions about that topic. For example, within epistemology, it has\nbeen suggested that we can make progress on questions about the nature\nof knowledge by looking at intuitions about whether certain states\ncount as knowledge. Similarly, within moral philosophy, it has been\nsuggested that we can make progress on questions about moral\nobligation by looking at intuitions about what actions certain agents\nare obligated to perform. Similar approaches have been advocated in\nnumerous other areas of philosophy.\n\nThere is a complex literature within the analytic tradition about how\nto understand this traditional method. Some argue that the study of\nintuitions gives us insight into concepts (Jackson 1998), others argue\nthat the study of intuitions gives us a more direct sort of insight\ninto the actual properties or relations those concepts pick out (Sosa\n2007), and still others argue that this whole way of conceiving of the\nproject is a mistaken one (e.g., Cappelen 2012).\n\nIt is commonplace to divide existing research in experimental\nphilosophy into distinct projects in accordance with their different\nrelationships to this prior tradition. Dividing things up in this way,\none arrives at three basic kinds of research in experimental\nphilosophy.\n\nFirst, some experimental philosophy research has a purely\n\u2018negative\u2019 relationship to this more traditional use of\nintuitions. Such research aims to provide evidence that the method\nused in the more traditional work is in some way flawed or unreliable.\nFor example, it has been argued that intuitions differ across\ndemographic factors such as gender or ethnicity, or that they are\nsubject to order effects, or that they can be influenced by incidental\nemotion (e.g., Weinberg et al. 2001; Buckwalter & Stich 2014; Swain et\nal. 2008; Cameron et al. 2013). To the extent that intuitions show\nthese effects, it is argued, we should not be relying uncritically on\nintuition as a method for addressing substantive philosophical\nquestions. This first project is called \u2018negative\u2019 in that\nit is not intended to make progress on the original philosophical\nquestion (e.g., about the nature of knowledge) but only to argue\nagainst a specific method for addressing that question (appeal to\nintuition).\n\nThis project has triggered a large and multi-faceted literature among\nphilosophers interested in its metaphilosophical implications (Brown\n2013b; Cappelen 2012; Deutsch 2015; Weinberg 2007; Weinberg et al.\n2010; Williamson 2007). This literature has explored the question as\nto whether empirical facts about the patterns in people\u2019s\nintuitions could give us reason to change our philosophical practices.\nMuch of this work is quite closely tied to prior philosophical work\nabout the role of intuition in philosophy more generally.\n\nSecond, some research in experimental philosophy aims to make further\nprogress on precisely the sorts of questions that motivated prior work\nwithin analytic philosophy. Thus, this research looks at epistemic\nintuitions as a way of making progress in epistemology, moral\nintuitions as a way of making progress in moral philosophy, and so\nforth. Experimental philosophers pursuing this second project have\noffered various different accounts of the way in which facts about\nintuitions could yield progress on these philosophical issues, but the\nmost common approach proceeds by advancing some specific hypothesis\nabout the underlying cognitive processes that generate intuitions in a\nparticular domain. The suggestion is then that this hypothesis can\nhelp us assess which intuitions in this domain are worthy of our trust\nand which should simply be dismissed or ignored (Gerken 2017; Leslie\n2013; Greene 2008; Nagel 2010).\n\nWork within this second project has inspired a certain amount of\nmetaphilosophical debate, but its main impact on the philosophical\nliterature has been not at the level of metaphilosophy but rather in\ndiscussions of individual philosophical questions. Thus, philosophers\ninterested in epistemic contextualism discuss experiments on\npeople\u2019s intuitions about knowledge (DeRose 2011), philosophers\ninterested in incompatibilism discuss experiments on people\u2019s\nintuitions about free will (Bj\u00f6rnsson & Pereboom 2014; Vargas\n2013), and philosophers interested in interventionist accounts of\ncausation discuss experiments on people\u2019s intuitions about\ncausation (Woodward 2014). Work in this vein typically does not focus\nprimarily on more abstract theories about the role of intuitions in\nphilosophy. Instead, it draws more on theories about the particular\ntopic under study (theories of knowledge, free will, causation).\n\nThe third type of research being conducted in experimental philosophy\nis not concerned either way with the kind of project pursued in more\ntraditional analytic philosophy; it is just doing something else\nentirely. Specifically, in many cases, experimental philosophers are\nnot looking at people\u2019s thoughts and feelings about some topic\nas a way of making progress on questions about that topic; they are\ninstead trying to make progress on questions that are directly\nabout people\u2019s thoughts and feelings themselves. For\nexample, much of the experimental philosophy research in moral\npsychology is concerned with questions that truly are about moral\npsychology itself.\n\nResearch in this third vein tends to be highly interdisciplinary.\nThus, work on any particular topic within this third vein tends to be\nat least relatively continuous with work on that same topic in other\ndisciplines (psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, etc.), and the\nimpact of such work is often felt just as much in those other\ndisciplines as in philosophy specifically.\n\nThe distinction between these projects has proven helpful within\nmetaphilosophical work on the significance of experimental philosophy,\nbut it should be noted that the metaphilosophical distinction between\nthese three projects does not correspond in any straightforward way to\nthe distinctions between the different concrete research programs\nexperimental philosophers pursue (on free will intuitions, on moral\nintuitions, on epistemic intuitions, etc.). Each of these concrete\nresearch programs can be relevant to a number of different projects,\nand indeed, it often happens that a single paper reports a result that\nseems relevant to more than one of these projects. Thus, as we review\nthe actual experimental research coming out of experimental\nphilosophy, we will need to turn away from the metaphilosophical\ndistinction between projects and turn instead to distinctions between\nconcrete research topics.\n",
