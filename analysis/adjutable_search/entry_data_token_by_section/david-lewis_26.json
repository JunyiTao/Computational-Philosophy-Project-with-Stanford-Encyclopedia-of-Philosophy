    "main_text": "Other Writings || Ethics\n7.5 Ethics\n\nLewis is obviously not as well known for his work in ethics as for his\nwork in other areas of philosophy. It was something of a surprise when\none of the volumes of his collected papers was called Papers in\nEthics and Social Philosophy (2000a). On the other hand, the\nexistence of this volume indicates that there is a large body of work\nthat Lewis put together in moral philosophy, very broadly construed.\nThere is very little secondary literature on Lewis\u2019s ethics.\nI\u2019m drawing heavily here on chapter 8 of Nolan (2005), and\nKeller (2015).\n\nAs Nolan suggests, the least inaccurate summary of Lewis\u2019s\nethical positions is that he was a\n virtue ethicist.\n Indeed, a focus on virtue, as opposed to consequences, plays a role\nin his defence of modal realism, as we saw in section 6.4. Nolan also\nnotes that this position is somewhat surprising. Most philosophers who\naccept views related to Lewis\u2019s about psychology and\ndecision-making (in particular, who accept a Humean story about\nbeliefs and desires being the basis for motivation, and who accept\nsome or other version of expected utility maximisation as the basis\nfor rational decision) have broadly consequentialist positions. But\nnot Lewis.\n\nLewis was also a\n value pluralist\n (1984a, 1989b, 1993b). Indeed, this was part of his objection to\nconsequentialism. He rejected the idea that there was one summary\njudgment we could make about the moral value of a person. In\n\u201cReply to McMichael\u201d (1978a) he complains about the\nutilitarian assumption that \u201cany sort or amount of evil can be\nneutralized, as if it had never been, by enough countervailing good\n\u2014and that the balancing evil and good may be entirely\nunrelated\u201d (1978a: 85).\n\nIn meta-ethics, Lewis defended a variety of\n subjectivism\n (1989b). Like many subjectivists, Lewis held that something is\nvaluable for us if and only if we would value it under ideal\ncircumstances. And he held, following Frankfurt (1971), that valuing\nsomething is simply desiring to desire it. What is distinctive about\nLewis\u2019s position is his view about what ideal circumstances are.\nHe thinks they are circumstances of \u201cfull imaginative\nacquaintance\u201d. This has some interesting consequences. In\nparticular, it allows Lewis to say that different goods have different\nconditions of full imaginative acquaintance. It might, he suggests, be\nimpossible to properly imagine instantiating several different values\nat once. And that in turn lets him argue that his value pluralism is\nconsistent with this kind of subjectivism, in a way that it might not\nbe consistent with other varieties of subjectivism.\n\nLewis also wrote several more papers in applied ethics. In two\ninteresting papers on\n tolerance\n (1989a, 1989d), he suggests that one reason for being tolerant, and\nespecially of being tolerant of speech we disapprove of, comes from\ngame-theoretic considerations. In particular, he thinks our motivation\nfor tolerance comes from forming a \u2018tacit treaty\u2019 with\nthose with differing views. If we agree not to press our numerical\nsuperiority to repress them when we are in the majority, they will do\nthe same. So tolerating opposing views may be an optimal strategy for\nanyone who isn\u2019t sure that they will be in the majority\nindefinitely. In these works it is easy to see the legacies of\nLewis\u2019s early work on philosophical lessons to be drawn from\ngame theory, and especially from the work of Thomas Schelling.\n",
