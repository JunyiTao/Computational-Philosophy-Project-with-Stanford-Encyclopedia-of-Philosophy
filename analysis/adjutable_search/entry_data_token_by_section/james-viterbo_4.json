    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Analogy of Being\n3.1 Analogy of Being\n\nThe concept of being, all the medievals agreed, is common. What was\ndebated was the nature of this commonness. According to James of\nViterbo, all commonness is founded on some agreement, and this\nagreement can be either merely nominal or grounded in reality.\nAgreement is nominal when the same name is predicated of wholly\ndifferent things, without there being any objective basis for the\napplication of the common name; such is the case of equivocal names.\nAgreement is real in the following two cases: (1) if it is based on\nsome essential resemblance between the many things to which a\nparticular concept applies, in which case the concept applies to these\nmany things by virtue of the self-same ratio and is said of\nthem univocally; or (2) if that concept is truly common to the many\nthings of which it is said, although it is not said of them in\nrelation to the same nature (ratio), but rather it is said in\na prior sense of one and in a posterior sense of others, insofar as\nthey are related in a certain way to the first. A concept that is\npredicated of things in this way is said to be analogous, and the\nagreement displayed by the things to which it applies is said to be an\nagreement of attribution (convenientia attributionis). James\nbelieves that it is according to this sense of analogy that being is\nsaid of God and creatures, and of substance and accident\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis I, q. 1, p. 25,\n674\u201380). For being is said in a prior sense of God and in a\nposterior sense of creatures by virtue of a certain relation between\nthe two; likewise, being is said first of substance and secondarily of\naccidents, on account of the relation of posteriority accidents have\nto substance. The reason why being is said in a prior sense of God and\nin a secondary sense of creatures and, hence, the reason why the\n\u2018ratio\u2019 or nature of being is different in the\ntwo cases is that being, in God, is \u201cthe very thing which God\nis\u201d (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 1, p.\n16, 412), whereas created being is only being through something added\nto it. From this first difference follows a second, namely, that\ncreated being is being by virtue of being related to an agent, whereas\nuncreated being has no relation. These two differences can be\nsummarized by saying that divine being is being through itself\n(per se), whereas created being is being through another\n(per aliud) (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis,\nq. 1, p. 16, 425\u20136). In sum, being is said of God and creature,\nbut according to a different ratio: it is said of God\naccording to the proper and perfect nature of being, but of creatures\nin a derivative or secondary way.\n",
