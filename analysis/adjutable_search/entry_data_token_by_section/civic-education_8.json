    "main_text": "The Good Democrat || Social Capital\n2.2 Social Capital\n\nThe concept of \u201csocial capital\u201d was introduced by the\nsociologist James S. Coleman to refer to the value that is inherent in\nsocial networks (see, e.g., Coleman, 1988). The political scientist\nRobert Putnam subsequently argued that democracies function well in\nproportion to the strength of their social capital (1994) and that\nsocial capital is declining in the United States (2000). In his book\nBowling Alone, Putnam explains, \u201cWhereas physical capital\nrefers to physical objects and human capital refers to properties of\nindividuals [such as their own skills], social capital refers to\nconnections among individuals\u2014social networks and the norms of\nreciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. In that sense\nsocial capital is closely related to what some have called\n\u2018civic virtue.\u2019 The difference is that \u2018social\ncapital\u2019 calls attention to the fact that civic virtue is most\npowerful when embedded in a dense network of reciprocal social\nrelations\u201d (Putnam 2000, p. 19).\n\nA related idea is \u201ccollective efficacy,\u201d as developed by\nthe sociologist Robert Sampson and colleagues. It is the use--or\nability to use--social networks to address common problems, such as\ncrime. Sampson finds that the level of collective efficacy strongly\npredicts the quality of life in communities (Sampson, 2012).\n\nIf governments and communities function much better when people have\nsocial networks and use them for public purposes, then civic education\nbecomes important and it is substantially about teaching people to\ncreate, appreciate, preserve, and use social networks. A pedagogical\napproach like\n Service Learning\n (see below) might be most promising for that purpose.\n\nElinor Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for her\nwork on how people overcome collective action problems, such as the\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons. These\nproblems are endemic and serious, sometimes leading to environmental\ncatastrophe and war. Ostrom, however, discovered many principles that\nallow people to overcome such problems. She wrote,\n\nAt any time that individuals may gain from the costly action of\nothers, without themselves contributing time and effort, they face\ncollective action dilemmas for which there are coping methods. When de\nTocqueville discussed the \u2018art and science of\nassociation,\u2019 he was referring to the crafts learned by those\nwho had solved ways of engaging in collective action to achieve a\njoint benefit. Some aspects of the science of association are both\ncounterintuitive and counterintentional, and thus must be taught to\neach generation as part of the culture of a democratic citizenry.\n(Ostrom 1998)\n\n\nOstrom believed that these principles could be taught explicitly and\nformally, but the traditional and most effective means for teaching\nthem were experiential. She argued that the tendency to centralize and\nprofessionalize management throughout the 20th century had deprived\nordinary people of opportunities to learn from experience, and thus\nour capacity to address collective action problems had weakened.\n\nAlong with her husband Vincent Ostrom, Elinor Ostrom developed the\nidea of polycentric governance, according to which we are citizens of\nmultiple, overlapping, and nested communities, from the smallest\nneighborhoods to the globe. Collective action problems are best\naddressed polycentrically, not reserved for national governments or\nparceled out neatly among levels of government. As president of the\nAmerican Political Science Association and in other prominent roles,\nOstrom advocated civic education that would teach people to address\ncollective action problems in multiple settings and scales.\n",
