    "main_text": "Objections to Internalist Alternatives to Classical Foundationalism || The Cognitive Penetration Objection\n5.1 The Cognitive Penetration Objection\n\nA recent objection to phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism involves\nappeal to cases of \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d, cases in which\npropositional attitudes (beliefs, fears, desires, etc.) that the\nsubject already has give rise to a related seeming. The objection\ncomes in two forms. The first is the \u201cillegitimate boost\u201d\nobjection. If I have prior justification to believe that P\n(e.g., that my car is in my garage), and that belief causes me to have\na seeming that P (e.g., the belief and expectation make it\nvisually seem to me that my car is in my garage when I glance quickly\nin the direction of my garage), dogmatism entails that the\nbelief\u2019s justification goes up. The usual reply here is that the\nrelevant claim is not counterintuitive. I gain no additional\njustification via the seeming if I have a good reason to suspect that\nmy having the seeming depends on my having the belief; but in the case\nwhere I have no such reason, it is not clearly counterintuitive to say\nthat I am justified. Tucker (2013: 14) gives a useful analogy to\ntestimony: if Bill and Jill both testify to me, at different times,\nthat there is free pizza on the quad, then both testimonies give me\nmore reason to believe than either of them separately, and this still\nholds if unbeknownst to me Jill tells me only because she\nheard it from Bill.\n\nThe second form of the \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d objection\nis sometimes called the \u201ctainted source\u201d objection (Huemer\n2013), and it arises from the fact that propositional attitudes other\nthan justified belief\u2014fears and desires, unjustified beliefs,\netc.\u2014can influence how things seem to us. Suppose, for example,\nthat Jill fears that Jack is angry with her, and that upon seeing Jack\nthat fear partly causes it to seem to her that Jack is angry with her\n(Siegel 2013). Many find it counterintuitive that Jill could acquire\njustification for her belief in this way. The natural suggestion is\nthat the etiology of the belief matters to its epistemic justification\n(see, e.g., Markie 2005, 2013; Goldman 2009; Lyons 2011; Siegel 2013).\nOnce again, there are some who do not share the intuition that the\nsubject\u2019s justification is affected by the belief\u2019s causal\nhistory when that causal history is not accessible to the subject\n(e.g., Huemer 2013). But at least some phenomenal conservatives admit\nto feeling the pull of the intuition in response to some of the cases,\nand attempt to account for it by saying that there is something else\nthat is epistemically bad in the situation\u2014e.g., while the\nbelief is epistemically justified, the agent is epistemically\nirresponsible, criticizable, or cognitively defective in some way\n(e.g., Skene 2013), or lacks the sort of justification that can turn\ntrue belief into knowledge (e.g., Tucker 2010). Some worry, however,\nthat not all the problematic \u201ctainted source\u201d cases can be\nhandled in these ways (see Markie 2013 and McGrath 2013.)\n",
