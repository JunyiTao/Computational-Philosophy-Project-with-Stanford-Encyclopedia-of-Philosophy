EPR Correlations and RCCP\n\nStandard non-relativistic quantum mechanics of finite degrees of\nfreedom predicts the famous EPR correlations (see entry on\n the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory),\n which have been observed in sophisticated physical measurements (see\nentry on\n Bell\u2019s theorem).\n These correlations are between events that are spacelike separated\n(hence causally independent according the special theory of\nrelativity). Thus, they can serve as evidence to assess the status of\nthe Common Cause Principle: These EPR correlations should have common\ncauses if the Common Cause Principle describes the physical world\ncorrectly.\n\nThe quantum probability space that predicts the EPR correlations does\nnot contain common causes for these correlations because this quantum\nprobability space is defined on a finite dimensional Hilbert space and\nsuch a quantum probability space is not purely non-atomic hence not\ncommon cause complete. The question of whether \u201chidden\u201d\ncommon causes for such correlations can in principle exist has been\nextensively discussed in a large literature. The first informal\ndiscussion seems to be von Neumann\u2019s letter to Schr\u00f6dinger\nin 1935 (Von Neumann 2005: 211\u2013213). In this letter von Neumann\ntakes the position that no correlation, including EPR-type quantum\ncorrelations, is problematic as long as one can find a common cause\nfor it\u2014although von Neumann does not use the term \u201ccommon\ncause\u201d, nor does he define any notion of common cause explicitly\n(R\u00e9dei 2006). The first technically explicit no-go theorem on\ncommon causes of EPR correlations is due to van Fraassen (1982). In\nthis paper it is assumed however that a single common cause explains\ndifferent correlations\u2014i.e., that common causes are\ncommon common causes. It turns out however that, given a set\n\\((A_i,B_i)\\) (\\(i=1,2,\\ldots\\)) of pairs of correlated events in a\nclassical probability measure space, requiring the existence of a\ncommon cause \\(C_i\\) for each correlated pair \\((A_i,B_i)\\) is a much\nweaker assumption than requiring the existence of a single C\nthat is the common cause of all correlated pairs \\((A_i,B_i)\\)\n(\\(i=1,2,\\ldots\\)): one can give examples of different correlations in\na classical probability measure space that cannot have the same common\ncause (Hofer-Szab\u00f3, R\u00e9dei, & Szab\u00f3 2002).\nThus if one aims at deriving no-go propositions on the existence of\ncommon causes of EPR correlations then one has to either argue that\nthe different correlations in the EPR-situation should have the same\ncommon cause or one should impose further conditions on the common\ncauses in addition to those in\n Reichenbach\u2019s definition (2)\u2013(5).\n\nThere are two types of such additional conditions, both motivated by\nthe specific features of the EPR-scenario: \u201cLocality\nconditions\u201d and requirements expressing what is called\n\u201cno-conspiracy\u201d. Furthermore, both locality and\nno-conspiracy come in two varieties: surface and\nhidden locality conditions on one hand and weak and\nstrong no-conspiracy conditions on the other. The content of\nthe surface locality condition is that \u201c\u2026 the probability\nof the outcome in one wing of the EPR correlation experiment is the\nsame no matter in which direction the measurement is carried out in\nthe other wing of the EPR experiment.\u201d (Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et\nal. 2013: 143).  The hidden locality conditions require that \n\n\n... given a pair of correlated outcomes of an EPR\ncorrelation experiment, the probability of the outcome in one wing of\nthe EPR correlation experiment be the same no matter in which\ndirection the measurement is carried out in the other wing of the EPR\nexperiment if the hypothetical common cause of this\ncorrelation also has happened. (Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al. 2013:\n144). \n\nThe weak no-conspiracy condition requires that any choice of\nthe direction in which a measurement is decided to be carried out in\nany wing of the EPR experimental setup is probabilistically\nindependent of the hypothetical common cause explaining the\ncorrelation in the chosen direction. The strong no-conspiracy\ncondition requires that any Boolean combination of choices of\nmeasurement directions in the two wings of the EPR experiment are\nprobabilistically independent of any Boolean combination of\nthe hypothetical common causes. (Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al. 2013:\n178). \n\n\nThe differences between the different versions of the locality and\nno-nonspiracy conditions are conceptually significant and they are\nalso crucial from the perspective of whether hypothetical common\ncauses of EPR correlations can be ruled out by no-go theorems: The\nsurface locality conditions are empirically testable due to the fact\nthat all the events involved in it are observable. The hidden locality\nconditions involve the unobserved, hypothetical common cause events\nand, as a consequence, these locality conditions are not testable\nindependently of the observation of the common causes. The\ninterpretation of the no-conspiracy conditions is somewhat\ncontroversial: it declares as an implausible conspiracy on the part of\nnature if common causes influenced not only the outcomes of the EPR\ncorrelation experiments but also the choices of measuring in\nparticular directions in the wings of the EPR experiment. These\nchoices, we feel, are free, depending on the experimenter\u2019s\ndecision.\n\nOne can show that weakly non-conspiratorial common cause\nexplanations of EPR correlations satisfying surface locality are\npossible. But strongly non-conspiratorial, hidden\nlocal common cause explanations of EPR correlations are ruled out\n(Hofer-Szab\u00f3 et al. 2013: 152, 163). These results show\nthat the EPR correlations cannot be regarded as strictly empirical\nevidence against the Common Cause Principle because the type of common\ncauses that can be ruled out have features by assumption that are not\nempirically testable (hidden locality and no-conspiracy)\u2014they\nare metaphysical in character.\n",
