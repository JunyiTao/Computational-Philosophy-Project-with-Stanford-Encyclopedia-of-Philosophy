    "main_text": "History of social choice theory || Arrow and his influence\n1.2 Arrow and his influence\n\nWhile Condorcet had investigated a particular voting method\n(majority voting), Arrow, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in\nEconomics in 1972, introduced a general approach to the study\nof preference aggregation, partly inspired by his teacher of logic,\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983), from whom he had learnt relation\ntheory as an undergraduate at the City College of New York (Suppes\n2005). Arrow considered a class of possible aggregation\nmethods, which he called social welfare functions, and asked\nwhich of them satisfy certain axioms or desiderata. He proved that,\nsurprisingly, there exists no method for aggregating the preferences\nof two or more individuals over three or more alternatives into\ncollective preferences, where this method satisfies five seemingly\nplausible axioms, discussed below.\n\nThis result, known as Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem,\nprompted much work and many debates in social choice theory and\nwelfare economics. William Riker (1920\u20131993), who inspired the\nRochester school in political science, interpreted it as a\nmathematical proof of the impossibility of populist democracy (e.g.,\nRiker 1982). Others, most prominently Amartya Sen (born 1933), who won\nthe 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize, took it to show that ordinal\npreferences are insufficient for making satisfactory social choices\nand that social decisions require a richer informational basis.\nCommentators also questioned whether Arrow\u2019s desiderata on an\naggregation method are as innocuous as claimed or whether they should\nbe relaxed.\n\nThe lessons from Arrow\u2019s theorem depend, in part, on how we\ninterpret an Arrovian social welfare function. The use of ordinal\npreferences as the \u2018aggreganda\u2019 may be easier to justify\nif we interpret the aggregation rule as a voting method than\nif we interpret it as a social evaluation method. Sen argued\nthat when a social planner seeks to rank different social alternatives\nin an order of social desirability (thereby employing some aggregation\nrule as a social evaluation method), it may be justifiable and even\nnecessary to use additional information over and above ordinal\npreferences, such as interpersonally comparable welfare measurements\n(e.g., Sen 1982) or information about people\u2019s capabilities to\nachieve valuable functionings (e.g., Sen 1992).\n\nArrow himself held the view\n\n\n\u2018that interpersonal comparison of utilities has no meaning and\n\u2026 that there is no meaning relevant to welfare comparisons in\nthe measurability of individual utility.\u2019 (1951/1963: 9)\n\n\nThis view was influenced by neoclassical economics, associated with\nscholars such as Vilfredo Pareto (1848\u20131923), Lionel Robbins\n(1898\u20131984), John Hicks (1904\u20131989), co-winner of the\nEconomics Nobel Prize with Arrow, and Paul Samuelson\n(1915\u20132009), another Nobel Laureate. Arrow\u2019s theorem\ndemonstrates the stark implications of the \u2018ordinalist\u2019\nassumptions of neoclassical thought. For a critique of this\nrestrictive ordinalist approach to welfare economics, see also the\nwork of Kotaro Suzumura (1944\u20132020) (e.g., Suzumura 2000).\n\nNowadays most social choice theorists have moved beyond the negative\ninterpretations of Arrow\u2019s theorem and are interested in the\ntrade-offs involved in finding satisfactory decision procedures and\nthe possibilities opened up by relaxing certain restrictive\nassumptions. Sen has promoted this \u2018possibilist\u2019\ninterpretation of social choice theory (e.g., in his 1998 Nobel\nlecture). Moreover, as Fabienne Peter has argued, by moving beyond the\nnarrow informational basis leading to the classic impossibility\nresults, social choice theory can become a more promising framework\nfor policy evaluation and offer resources for taking into account the\nsituated nature of people\u2019s agency, inequalities between them,\nand issues of gender (Peter 2003).\n\nIn contemporary social choice theory, it is perhaps fair to say,\nArrow\u2019s axiomatic method is more influential than his\nimpossibility theorem itself (on the axiomatic method, see Thomson\n2000). The paradigmatic kind of result in formal work is now the\n\u2018characterization theorem\u2019. Here the aim is to identify a\nset of plausible necessary and sufficient conditions that uniquely\ncharacterize a particular solution (or class of solutions) to a given\ntype of collective decision problem. An early example is Kenneth\nMay\u2019s (1952) characterization of majority rule, discussed\nbelow.\n",
