(This is easier to see than Heidegger\u2019s\nconverse claim\u2014that the aestheticization of art feeds back into\nand reinforces subjectivism\u2014so we will address it first.)\nBeing and Time does not undermine the subject/object dichotomy by\ntrying to advance the incredible thesis that the self really exists in\na continuous and unbroken unity with its world. Instead,\nHeidegger seeks to account for the fact that our fundamental, practical\nengagement with our worlds can easily break down in ways that generate\nthe perspective the subject/object dichotomy describes. Most of\nthe time, we encounter ourselves as immediately and unreflectively\nimmersed in the world of our concerns rather than as standing over\nagainst an \u201cexternal\u201d world of objects. Just think,\nfor example, of the way you ordinarily encounter a hammer when you are\nhammering with it, or a pen while you are writing with it, a bike while\nriding it, a car while driving it, or even, say, a freeway interchange\nas you drive over it for the umpteenth time. This all changes,\nhowever, when our practical engagement with the world of our concerns\nbreaks down. When the head flies off the hammer and will not go\nback on (and no other hammering implement is available to complete the\ntask at hand); when the pen we are writing with runs out of ink (and we\nhave no other); when our bike tire goes flat or our car breaks down in\nthe middle of a trip; when we find ourselves standing before an artwork\nthat we cannot make sense of; or, in general, when we are still\nlearning how to do something and encounter some unexpected difficulty\nwhich stops us in our tracks\u2014in all such cases what Heidegger\ncalls our ordinary, immediate \u201chands-on\u201d\n(zuhanden) way of coping with the world of our practical\nconcerns undergoes a \u201ctransformation\u201d (Umschlag)\nin which we come to experience ourselves as isolated subjects standing\nreflectively before a world of external objects, which we thereby come\nto experience as standing over against us in the mode of something\nobjectively \u201con hand\u201d (vorhanden) (BT 408\u20139/SZ 357\u20138).\n\n\nIn other words, Heidegger does not deny the reality of the\nsubject/object relation but, rather, points out that our experience of\nthis subject/object relation derives from and so\npresupposes a more fundamental level of experience, a\nprimordial modality of engaged existence in which self and world are\nunited rather than divided. Heidegger believes that modern\nphilosophy\u2019s failure to solve the problem of skepticism about the\nexternal world shows that those who begin with the subject/object\ndivide will never be able to bridge it subsequently (BT 249\u201350/SZ\n205\u20136). He thus insists that this more primordial level of\npractically engaged, \u201chands-on\u201d existence\u2014in which\nself and world are unified\u2014must be the starting point of any\ndescription of ordinary human experience that seeks to do justice to\nwhat such experience is really like, a phenomenological dictum\nHeidegger insists should also govern our attempts to describe our\nmeaningful encounters with works of art.\n",
