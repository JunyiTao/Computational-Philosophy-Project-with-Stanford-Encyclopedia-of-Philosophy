    "main_text": "Analytical Marxism || Bullshit\n1.3 Bullshit\n\nIn trying to characterise an intellectual current, it can help to\nidentify those it is opposed to, or consciously contrasts itself\nwith.\n\nCohen, Elster, and Roemer, all participated in an annual workshop\nusually known as the September Group. That Group initially also\nreferred to itself as the \u201cNon-Bullshit Marxism Group\u201d.\nThe label is intended both to be humorous\u2014there was even a faux\nheraldic crest complete with cod Latin tag \u201cMarxismus sine\nstercore tauri [Marxism without the shit of the bull]\u201d (G.\nCohen 2013: 94)\u2014and to convey some truth. It is also an\naggressive characterisation, in that it implies that some kinds of\nMarxism are of the bullshit variety.\n\nThe best-known philosophical discussion of bullshit is, of course,\nthat of Harry Frankfurt (2005). Cohen extended Frankfurt\u2019s\npioneering analysis to a variety of bullshit neglected in the\nlatter\u2019s original essay. A variety which: naturally inhabits the\nacademy and not ordinary life; consists of the output (the bullshit)\nnot the process (the bullshitting); is related to the (OED)\ndictionary definition of bullshit as \u201cnonsense\u201d or\n\u201crubbish\u201d; and which further specifies the relevant\nnonsense as being by nature unclarifiable (G. Cohen 2013: 107 fn.27).\nIt is the last of these characteristics\u2014the \u201cunclarifiable\nunclarity\u201d\u2014which appears central to this variety of\nbullshit, and which is purportedly celebrated by some of its producers\nand consumers.\n\nCohen goes on to affirm and defend the historical and empirical claim\nthat \u201cbullshit Marxism\u201d flourishes in French intellectual\nculture. (He had judged this second part of his discussion\nas \u201ctoo speculative\u201d, and it was only published\nposthumously [G. Cohen 2013: viii].) In the 1960s, he read a great\ndeal of French Marxism, especially work by Louis Althusser and his\nfollowers. At the time, Cohen found much of that material hard to\nunderstand, but located the blame for those difficulties entirely\nwithin himself. Moreover, whenever he finally managed to extract a\nreasonable idea from this Althusserian literature, he was\ninclined\u2014precisely because of that effort and\ninvestment\u2014to consider it more important and interesting than it\nactually was. This psychological mechanism\u2014\u201ca blend,\nperhaps\u201d of \u201cadaptive preference formation\u201d and\n\u201ccognitive dissonance reduction\u201d\u2014may be widespread\n(2013: 95). Despite this youthful attraction, Cohen did not succumb to\nAlthusserianism, because, as he puts it: \n\n\nI came to see that its reiterated affirmation of the value of\nconceptual rigour was not matched by conceptual rigour in its\nintellectual practices. (2013: 95) \n\n\nAnd Cohen explicitly identifies this youthful \u201cmisguided\nAlthusserian dalliance\u201d as lying behind his own subsequent and\nfierce intolerance of bullshit (2013: 95).\n\nThe same phenomenon\u2014the Althusserian promise of theoretical\nrigour, and the purported failure to deliver it in practice\u2014may\nalso have found biographical expression in Elster\u2019s early\ngraduate career. Not feeling at home with the Althusserian Marxists at\nthe Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Elster ended up writing his\ndissertation under Raymond Aron.\n\nIn a distinct but related account, Erik Olin Wright characterises\n\u201cfull-blown\u201d bullshit Marxism as beset by three\nintellectual \u201csins\u201d. First, \u201cobfuscation\u201d, understood\nas offering arguments and analyses which sound profound, but which are\nresistant to clarification. The objection here is not to the use of\ntechnical, or quasi-technical, vocabulary as such, but rather to its\nuse to obscure. Second, \u201cintellectual dishonesty\u201d,\nunderstood as the refusal variously: to clarify arguments in ways that\nare open to challenge; to acknowledge gaps in one\u2019s\nunderstanding or knowledge; or to concede that there exist reasonable\ngrounds for disagreement. This can take the form of what might be\ncharacterised as sincere dogmatism, but more often involves something\ncloser to \u201cbad faith\u201d, in which authors repress their\ngenuine doubts and qualifications when presenting their own views in\npublic. The third is an \u201cideological style of\nargumentation\u201d in which \u201ca correct understanding of a\nsubject\u201d is conflated with \u201cMarx\u2019s understanding of\nthat subject\u201d; that Marx endorsed such and such a claim being\ntreated as a conclusive argument in its favour (Kirby unpublished:\n24\u201325 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Wright\u2019s account of bullshit is more expansive than\nCohen\u2019s\u2014not least, in venturing into the character of the\nbullshitter\u2014but the idea of \u201cobfuscation\u201d looks to\nbe a close relative of \u201cunclarifiable unclarity\u201d.\n\nNote that the distinction between bullshit Marxism and non-bullshit\nMarxism is not an exhaustive one; that is, there are varieties of\nMarxism which are neither analytical nor bullshit. However, Cohen does\nprovocatively suggest that, once analytical Marxism has a clear\npresence in the world, what might be called \u201cpre-analytical\nMarxism\u201d is no longer a stable outcome\u2014it must tend to\n\u201ceither become analytical or become bullshit\u201d as the case\nmay be (G. Cohen 2000b: xxvi).\n",
