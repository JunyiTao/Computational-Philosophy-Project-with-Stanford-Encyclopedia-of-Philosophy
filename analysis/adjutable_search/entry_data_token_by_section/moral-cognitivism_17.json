    "main_text": "Problems, Objections and Response Strategies || The Embedding Problem\n4.1 The Embedding Problem\n\nNon-cognitivism as it is often presented is incomplete. It gives us an\naccount of the meanings of moral expressions in free standing\npredicative uses, and of the states of mind expressed when they are so\nused. But the identical expressions can be used in more complex\nsentences, sentences which embed such predications. Thus far we have\nnot considered what the expressions might mean when so used. We say\nthings such as the following:\n\nIt is true that lying is wrong.\n\nLying is not wrong.\n\nI wonder whether lying is wrong.\n\nI believe that lying is wrong.\n\nFred believes that lying is wrong.\n\nIs lying wrong?\n\nIf lying is wrong, he will be sure to do it.\n\nIf lying is wrong, then so is misleading truth-telling.\n\nSo, in addition to their analyses of unembedded predication,\nnon-cognitivists owe us an account of the meanings of more complex\nsentences or judgments such as these. Of course there are some\ndesiderata we would like an adequate account to fulfill. (1) One is\ncompositionality; the meaning of a complex sentence embedding a moral\nclaim should be a function of the meaning of its parts so as to\nexplain the ease with which speakers can understand novel normative\nsentences. (2) Another is that it should preserve and explain the\nlogical relations between moral judgements and other judgements which\nembed them, at least for central cases. And (3), we want the account\nnot to require implausible verdicts in attributing attitudes to people\nwho use the sentences. For example, if a non-cognitivist says the\nmeaning of \u2018Lying is wrong\u2019 is to express disfavor towards\nlying, that does not yet provide a good explanation of the attitude\nexpressed by the very same words used in many embedded contexts. When\nthose words occur in the antecedent of a conditional, or when a person\nsays, \u2018I wonder if lying is wrong\u2019 they they are typically\nnot being used to express such disapproval. The point here is not that\nthese desiderata cannot be satisfied. Leading contemporary\nnon-cognitivists have all tried to provide accounts. As it turns out,\nthe task is difficult and generates much controversy.\n\nGeach thought that the second and third desiderata would be especially\nhard to accomplish simultaneously. Normally we believe that the status\nof an argument as valid depends, at least in part, on the words not\nshifting in meaning as we move from premise to premise. But the\nsimplest story of the meaning of moral terms, that they are devices\nfor expressing pro and con attitudes, seems then to require that they\nmean something else when embedded in the antecedents of conditionals.\nConsider the following example from Geach (1965, 463):\n\n(P1) If tormenting the cat is bad, getting your little brother to do\nit is bad\n\n(P2) Tormenting the cat is bad.\n\nErgo, getting your little brother to torment the cat is\nbad.\n\nThe argument is valid. But if the entire meaning of \u2018tormenting\nthe cat is bad\u2019 in the second premise is well explained by\nsaying that it is suited for use in expressing disapproval of\ntormenting the cat, then that meaning cannot be the same as the\nmeaning it has in the first premise (which one might accept even if\none approves of tormenting cats). This doesn\u2019t show that the\nexpression is not being used emotively in the second premise; a\ndescriptivist can agree to that. But it does indicate that more will\nneed to be said to explain what is going on. For straightforwardly\ndescriptive arguments of the same form, the explanation of why the\nargument is valid relies on the idea that the phrase in the antecedent\nhas a constant meaning that it represents both unembedded and\nembedded. This is what Geach has called The Frege Point: \u201cA\nthought may have just the same content whether you assent to its truth\nor not; a proposition may occur in discourse now asserted, now\nunasserted, and yet be recognizably the same proposition\u201d (Geach\n1965, 449). As Geach saw it, if content did not remain constant across\nembedded and unembedded occurrences of predicative moral sentences, we\nwould routinely commit a fallacy of equivocation in arguments. (It is\ndue to Geach\u2019s invocation of Frege in this context that the\nembedding problem is often called the Frege-Geach problem. Searle 1962\nindependently raises a version of the same objection and some credit\nW. D. Ross (1939, 34\u201338) with an earlier yet statement of the\nobjection.)\n\nSemantic nonfactualism, the non-cognitivist commitment to the view\nthat moral judgments do not express propositions or predicate\nproperties, rules out one simple way of explaining matters. (But see\nthe discussion of hybrid theories below and in the supplementary\ndocument\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\n If there is no proposition expressed in normal predicative uses of\nmoral expressions we eliminate one candidate for a constant element\nthat generates relations of implication with other expressions\nembedding the same form of words. Arguably we need some other\ncandidate to provide the commonality. As Geach noted, it isn\u2019t\nplausibly the attitude expressed by the a free-standing sentence since\nthis feature doesn\u2019t always survive embedding as we saw. Perhaps\nit might be some predictable function of this attitude. That would\nserve the goal of providing a compositional semantics for the terms in\nquestion.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that semantic nonfactualism eliminates a candidate\nfor the constant element uniting embedded and unembedded uses of the\nsame normative expression. Such nonfactualism also serves to\ncomplicate the semantics, because it eliminates a straightforward and\neasy way of explaining how different beliefs can be inconsistent and\nhow one belief can commit one to another. On a standard model for\nbelief in general, belief content is propositional and two beliefs are\ninconsistent when their contents \u2013 the propositions they are\ndirected at \u2013 are inconsistent. And one belief logically commits\none to another when the content of the first entails the second. Those\ntwo ideas, plus an account of what it is for contents \u2013 that is\npropositions \u2013 to be inconsistent is all you need to explain the\nlogical relations among beliefs. It isn\u2019t even really important\nto this general point that the contents be propositions. The point is\nthat if you treat all beliefs as inheriting their logical properties\nfrom the logical properties of their contents in this way, you get a\nrelatively simple story about attitudinal inconsistency and\ncommitment.\n\nOnce you say that ordinary beliefs and moral beliefs represent\ndifferent types of attitude towards their contents (if they have\ncontents at all) you can\u2019t any longer tell the simple story.\nThis remains so even if the theory can allow moral attitudes to have\ncontents in some sense and even if these contents are the same kind of\nthing as the contents of ordinary beliefs. That\u2019s because the\ndifferent relations to those contents (taking different attitudes\ntowards them) will need to be taken into account. The resulting theory\nwill need more complicated inconsistency and inference-licensing\nrules. I\u2019ll use R. M. Hare\u2019s (1952) logic of phrastics and\nneustics to illustrate. Because it furthers my purpose in providing\nthis example I\u2019m going to assume that sincere speech acts using\nmoral terms express attitudes and that these attitudes are what we\nattribute when say they believe something about morality. This may be\nmore than Hare was committed to himself.\n\nHare thought we could model the logic of speech acts by employing one\nelement that represented a possible way things might be (the phrastic)\nand a second element that in effect gave instruction for how to\ninterpret the point of the representation (the neustic). For our\npurposes here we can think of the first element as the contents of the\nattitude expressed by the speech act and it would not distort the\ntheory too much to say they are propositions. On this way of\npresenting things, several different speech acts expressing a number\nof different attitudes will all involve the same phrastic. The\ndifferences between them will be represented by differences in the\nneustic. The belief that P will be expressed by a speech act\nwhich is represented by a neustic that reflects the status of\nassertion and a phrastic that represents P. A question about\nwhether P is the case will be represented by the same\nphrastic, but a different neustic \u2013 the one that represents the\nspeech act as a question rather than an assertion. The sentence which\nexpresses the thought that P is good (say) will also employ\nthis same phrastic. What distinguishes it from the first two is once\nagain the neustic which will reflect that this judgement is a\nuniversal prescription to bring about P. This means that we\ncannot compute the logical compatibility or incompatibility of two\njudgements by noting the compatibility or incompatibility of their\nphrastics which we are treating as their contents. The assertion of\nP and the attitude it expresses is different from the\nassertion that P is good and the attitude it expresses.\nStandard semantic theory captures this by assigning these judgements\ndifferent contents. Within the theory which treats the phrastic as the\ncontent, the difference must be captured by assigning them different\nneustics as a reflection that they\u2019re supposed to be different\nkinds of speech acts and to express different kinds of attitudes.\nThere isn\u2019t yet a problem with that. But insofar as the\njudgements clearly have different consistency conditions and involve\ndifferent logical commitments the resulting logic must now include\nprinciples that allow differences in attitude type to matter to\nconsistency and inconsistency.\n\nHare was aware of the point. And if we were dealing with only a few\ndifferent types of attitude and corresponding expressive speech act it\nshould be no difficulty at all. But once we introduce new sentences\njoining the terms we have so far with logical connectives we are\nlikely to need to postulate yet further attitude types and to need\nfurther principles to capture their logical properties. Such complex\nsentences express attitudes that don\u2019t reduce to the attitudes\nwhich would be expressed by either conjunct (Schroeder 2008c, 49). It\nwould thus be wrong to equate the attitude expressed with either\naccepting the one attitude or accepting the other. Relatedly, a speech\nact \u201casserting\u201d a disjunction with one normative disjunct\nand one non-normative disjunct should be a new kind of speech act. It\ndoesn\u2019t universally prescribe anything, nor (on the theory\nwe\u2019re working with) does it assert anything. And similarly for\nthe attitude expressed by that speech act. It will be a new type of\nstate of mind. So we\u2019ll need a new sort of neustic to capture\nthe kind of speech act this is. And we\u2019ll need additional rules\nto tell us about the logic of speech act types represented by those\nneustics.\n\nSchroeder (2008b, 2008c) dubs the distinction between inconsistencies\nthat involve one attitude-type directed towards inconsistent contents,\nA-type inconsistencies and contrasts them with B-type inconsistencies\nwhich postulate inconsistencies that stem from incoherences between\nthe attitude types in conjuction with their contents. For example\napproving of a proposition and disapproving of the same proposition is\ninconsistent (if it is) not in virtue of directing one and the same\nattitude at inconsistent propositions, but rather because two\nallegedly incompatible attitude-types are directed at the same\nproposition. And he notes that the clearest examples of genuine\ninconsistency \u2013 beliefs in contradictories and intentions to\npursue inconsistent courses of action \u2013 seem to be A-type. He\nfurther suggests that this would be a reason to prefer an A-type model\nif non-cognitivists could construct one.\n\nNon-cognitivists have developed various ingenious strategies for\nconstructing a theory that preserves the intuitive logical relations\nbetween normative attitudes, non-normative attitudes and various mixed\nattitudes, along with the sentences that express them. We will briefly\nsurvey some main variants below. For a more thorough survey see the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies,\n which can be read in place of the remainder of section 4.1.\n\nMuch of the recent innovation in developing non-cognitivist theories\nis motivated by a desire to address the embedding problem. In what\nremains of this section we will briefly survey three differing\napproaches to the task, which may also be combined. These are (1)\ndeveloping a logic of the sentences by explaining how that logic falls\nout of logical relations among the attitudes they express, (2)\nexploiting minimalism with regard to truth and related notions to\nprovide an account of certain locutions, and (3) allowing the\ndescriptive semantic component postulated by hybrid expressivist\ntheories to explain the logical relations among normative sentences\nand attitudes.\n4.1.1 A logic of attitudes\n\nThe idea behind a logic of attitudes is to change the normal order of\nexplanation to explain why normative sentences and attitudes bear the\nlogical relations that they do to other sentences and attitudes. As\nnoted above, standard cognitivist accounts of a domain of discourse\nwill explain the consistency or inconsistency of states of mind by\nciting the consistency or inconsistency of that state\u2019s content,\nthat is what it represents. The belief that dogs howl is inconsistent\nwith the belief that dogs don\u2019t howl because their contents\n(that dogs do or don\u2019t howl) are inconsistent with one another.\nAnd similarly for the sentences expressing those beliefs. Since\nnoncognitivists don\u2019t postulate such representational contents\nthey can\u2019t deploy that explanation. But they might still be able\nto do justice to the fact that normative judgments and sentences stand\nin logical relations to one another if they can explain how the\njudgments themselves stand in certain logical relations to to one\nanother and then go on to explain that the sentences are inconsistent\njust because they express judgments that are inconsistent.\n\nOne such approach has been to suggest that the complex moral or\nnormative judgments are higher order attitudes aimed at the judgements\nthat would be expressed by the sentences which they embed. These\nhigher order attitudes might either be complex beliefs (Blackburn\n1971) or further non-cognitive judgments (Blackburn 1984) expressed by\nthe corresponding complex sentences. The hope is that these judgments\nwill have rational connections to the other judgments that are likely\nto play a role in valid arguments. If all goes well, a kind of\npragmatic incoherence or irrationality will be involved when someone\naccepts the judgments of a valid argument so analyzed while at the\nsame time rejecting the conclusion. Such a speaker would be in a state\nsimilar to those uttering sentences of the sort that feature in\nMoore\u2019s paradox, such as \u2018It is raining but I don\u2019t\nbelieve that it is.\u2019\n\nA simple example of this sort of approach comes from Blackburn.\nConditionals express higher order attitudes towards accepting certain\nconjunctions of attitudes. \u201cIf lying is wrong, telling your\nlittle brother to lie is wrong,\u201d (when sincerely uttered)\nexpresses approval of making disapproval of getting one\u2019s\nbrother to lie \u201cfollow upon\u201d disapproval of lying.\n\n\u2026Anyone holding this pair [the above attitude, plus the\nattitude expressed by \u2018lying is wrong\u2019] must hold the\nconsequential disapproval: he is committed to disapproving of getting\nlittle brother to lie, for if he does not his attitudes clash. He has\na fractured sensibility which cannot itself be an object of approval.\n(Blackburn 1984, 195)\n\n\nLogical entailments involving moral judgments are explained as\nfollows: A constellation of attitudes which includes the attitudes\nexpressed by the conditional and by the seemingly assertive premises\nbut not those expressed by the conclusion is irrational, because it\ngoes against the purposes of moral discourse. Somewhat more\nsophisticated ways of developing this strategy can be worked out but\nthe basic idea is well exemplified in this proposal. The logic of\nattitudes strategy has met with much resistance on the part of\ncognitivists. One line of thought is that these proposals conflate\ngenuine inconsistency with mere pragmatic incoherence (Hale 1986;\nSchueler 1988; Brighouse 1990; Zangwill 1992; van Roojen 1996). And\nnon-cognitivists have responded with increasingly more sophisticated\nproposals about the logic of attitudes, including several proposals\nthat do not employ higher order attitudes (Baker & Woods 2015;\nBlackburn 1988b; Gibbard 1990, 2003; Horgan and Timmons 2006b;\nSchroeder 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, Silk 2015). These are discussed in more\ndetail in the supplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n4.1.2 Minimalism\n\nSome have suggested that minimalism or deflationism about truth or\ntruth aptness can allow non-cognitivists to bypass some of the above\ndebates. (Stoljar 1993) A very rough characterization of minimalism\nabout truth will hopefully suffice to explain. Minimalist theories are\noften presented by contrast with theories of truth according to which\ntruth is some sort of \u201csubstantial\u201d relation or property.\nFor example correspondence theories which claim that truth involves a\nreal relation between truth-bearers and reality are often cited as\nparadigm cases of a substantial theory of truth. Most minimalists\nabout truth suggest that truth is not such a substantial property.\nDifferent minimalists formulate their positive claims in somewhat\ndifferent ways. One version suggests that all you need to know to\nunderstand the \u2018is true\u2019 locution is that it is\nappropriate to use it in conjunction with any indicative sentence\nwhich is itself appropriate in the context of use. To call a sentence\ntrue is just to assert or affirm the sentence (Ramsey 1927). There are\nother variants besides this one. What we need to note is just that the\nsuggestion helps explain the meaning of normative sentences in only\none embedded context, namely the one in which it is embedded along in\nan \u2018is true\u2019 construction. Extensions of this minimalist\nstrategy have attempted to deploy minimal conceptions of other notions\nsuch as truth-aptness, proposition (Horwich 1990, 18\u201322) and\nmore besides to extend the account to normative sentences seeming to\nemploy these notions. The explanations allow noncognitivists to\nexplain our use of terms that seem to express realist commitments.\nStill it is a further step to conclude that this will enable\nnoncognitivists to use them to do the same explanatory work as\nrealists do when they use those terms. But in fact some minimalists\nhave even claimed that they do. Discussion of those proposals is found\nin the supplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n Some of the points about order of explanation in section\n 5.2\n below are also relevant to the issue of how much work minimalism can\nreally do.\n4.1.3 Piggybacking on the Descriptive Content in a Hybrid Theory\n\nWe noted earlier that non-cognitivists have long granted to evaluative\nutterances and thoughts some secondary \u201cdescriptive\nmeaning\u201d and that hybrid theorists have gone on to give that\ndescriptive content nearly co-equal status. One motivation for such\nviews is rooted in a strategy for solving the embedding problem:\nHybrid theorists hope to explain logical relations among moral\njudgements by using the descriptive component of meaning to do much of\nthe work. Hybrid theorists have differed over whether the\nnon-cognitive component is expressed semantically by some component of\nthe sentence or pragmatically. Still hybrid theorists tend to agree\nthat the belief contents are part of the semantic values of the\nsentences that express them (Jackson 1999, Barker 2000; Copp 2001;\nRidge 2006a, 2006b, 2014; Boisvert 2008; Copp 2009). This would seem\nto entail that these sentences are inconsistent with any judgement\nthat a sentence expressing only the belief component would be\ninconsistent with. Hybrid theorists can thus use the alleged\ndescriptive component of the meanings of moral judgments to generate\nmost of the required logical relations that moral judgements bear to\nother judgements, supplementing the basic account just enough to\naccount for complications introduced by the non-cognitive component of\nrelevant judgements.\n\nCognitivists have raised doubts about the adequacy of several of these\nproposals due to the manner in which the descriptive meaning is\ndetermined by many of these theories (van Roojen 2005; Schroeder 2009)\nand how they can be used to communicate the content they allegedly\nhave (Schroeder 2009). Hybrid theorists have, of course, resisted\nthese complaints (Alm 2007, Ridge 2007; Eriksson 2010). and hybrid\ntheories that take epithets and slurs as their model aren\u2019t\nsubject to the same objections (Copp 2001, 2009; Boisvert 2008). A\nmore thorough discussion of these issues can be found in the\nsupplementary document\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.\n",
