    "main_text": "Epistemology: Direct realism and the doctrine of immediate justification || Alternative interpretations of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\n2.4 Alternative interpretations of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\n\n\nThe foregoing reading, on which Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristic epistemological doctrine centrally involves the claim\nthat phenomenologically determinate cognitions immediately confer\nprima facie justification, is informed by one of a couple of\nsignificant lines of traditional interpretation of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ntexts; in particular, this reflects the interpretation of the\ncommentator P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra, which is arguably\npreferable both in terms of its exegetical adequacy to Kum\u0101rila,\nand in terms of its philosophical cogency. (See, however, McCrea 2018 for a different perspective on the matter.) There is, however, an\nalternative line of interpretation to be gleaned from the commentary\nof Kum\u0101rila\u2019s near-contemporary U\u1e43veka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n(whose commentary is referred to in the Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s engagements with Kum\u0101rila).  Among\nthe salient points of U\u1e43veka\u2019s reading is the worry that\nKum\u0101rila cannot, as has so far been suggested, have meant to\nargue that all phenomenologically credible cognitions are to\nbe credited with being truth-conducive; seemingly counter, then, to\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s own suggestion (quoted above) that \u201cthe validity\nof cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting of\ncognition,\u201d U\u1e43veka notes that the fact of \u201cbeing a\ncognition\u201d (bodhakatva) commonly characterizes both\nveridical and erroneous cognitions.\n\n\nU\u1e43veka worries, then, that if Kum\u0101rila is understood as\nsaying that a cognition\u2019s being truth-conducive follows simply\nfrom its being a cognition, there would be the unwanted\nconsequence that if one mistook the glint of mother-of-pearl for that\nof a piece of silver (a stock example of error in Indian philosophy),\nthis erroneous cognition would have to be credited as a\n\u201cveridical cognition\u201d (pram\u0101\u1e47a). (It\nmatters for this discussion that the word pram\u0101\u1e47a\nis equivocal, alternately referring to reliable doxastic practices, and\nto episodes of veridical cognition such as result from the\nexercise thereof.) U\u1e43veka\u2019s intuition, then, is that\n\u201cbeing a pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d can only\ncharacterize, as it were, the certified outcome of the\nepistemic process; he is therefore concerned to interpret\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine in such a way that \u201cbeing\nintrinsically truth-conducive\u201d ends up being predicated only of\nwhat are clearly veridical cognitions.\n\n\nTo that end, U\u1e43veka urges that Kum\u0101rila be understood as\narguing that what produces the truth-conduciveness intrinsic to some\ncognitions just is the causes of those cognitions that are\nveridical\u2014that, in other words, the point of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristic claim is that the truth-conduciveness of any\ncognition originates intrinsically, arising from the same\ncausal factors in virtue of which it is rightly said to be\nveridical. With respect, then, to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s claim\n(at codan\u0101 47) that \u201ca capacity not already\nexisting by itself cannot be produced by anything else,\u201d\nU\u1e43veka glosses Kum\u0101rila\u2019s \u201cby anything else\u201d as\nsuggesting that a cognition\u2019s capacity for truth-conduciveness cannot\nbe produced by anything over and above the causal factors\nrelevant to cognition. From the perspective of an interpretation informed by P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra, it thus seems that U\u1e43veka retains precisely the idea\nKum\u0101rila means to call into question, which is that veridical\ncognitions can be distinguished particularly with reference to the\ncauses thereof; for on U\u1e43veka\u2019s view, what distinguishes a\nveridical cognition of silver from mistaking mother-of-pearl for\nsuch is the fact that in the former case alone, silver really is\npresent as the\ncause of the cognition. U\u1e43veka thus takes it that what\nimmediately or \u201cintrinsically\u201d attaches to cognitions is to\nbe understood not in terms of what may be the case prima facie\n(not in terms of how cognitions may at first appear), but in\nterms of what we end up with. The status of truth-conducive cognitions\nas truth-conducive, then, is understood as by U\u1e43veka as \u201cintrinsic\u201d only in the sense that this status results from the same causes that give rise to the cognitions so characterized\u2014which means we can determine which cognitions those are by identifying the relevant causes.\n\n\nIn contrast to this interpretation of Kum\u0101rila, the\neleventh-century commentator\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra\u2014who also wrote an independent\nessay on the doctrine here in view\n(entitled Svata\u1e25pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47yanir\u1e47aya,\n\u201cAscertainment of Intrinsic Validity\u201d; see A. Subrahmanya\nShastri 1982, Arnold 2002)\u2014embraced just the view that\nU\u1e43veka thought so problematic. P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra emphasizes that it was\nprecisely Kum\u0101rila\u2019s point to argue that all\nphenomenologically credible cognitions\u2014all cognitions, that is,\nthat first present themselves as candidates for the status of reliable\nepistemic warrants\u2014should be thought intrinsically or\nimmediately to have that status. This is, on one view of the matter, because\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra takes the fact of any cognition\u2019s\n\u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) essentially to concern not\ntruth, but justification\u2014not, that is, the\noutcome of the epistemic process, but what gets it off the\nground in the first place. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s reference, then, to\nthe \u201ccapacity\u201d that cognitions immediately have in this\nregard is to be understood as a capacity for conferring\njustification\u2014a thought that\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra expresses by saying he takes\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine to affirm (against U\u1e43veka) not\nthat this status intrinsically exists (bhavati), but\nthat it intrinsically \u201cappears\u201d (bh\u0101ti). The\npoint of departure on this understanding of Kum\u0101rila, then, is the\nkind of epistemic claim that any cognition seems to a subject\nto make upon him.\n\n\nAmong the points P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra adduces in favor of\nthis interpretation is that U\u1e43veka cannot make sense of the\naccount of falsification that figures in Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nelaboration of his epistemology. On the reading of\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology proposed by U\u1e43veka,\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi says, Kum\u0101rila would have to be understood\nas claiming, with regard to cognitions that turn out to be overridden,\nthat their truth-status had changed. In other words, on the\nview that \u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) is intrinsically produced\n(i.e., by the same causes that produce the cognition), any subsequent\nrevision in judgment would have to consist in the actual transformation\nof the initially known state of affairs\u2014what had been\ntrue, that is, would now be false. Against this,\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra urges that \u201cthis doesn\u2019t\nmake sense, because of [the cognition\u2019s having been]\nnon-veridical from the outset.\u201d This rejoinder virtually amounts\nto the statement of a realist conception of truth:\u00a0 in cases where\nour initial cognition is overridden, the initial cognition was false\nall along; all that changes is our awareness thereof.\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi thus separates the (subjective, epistemic)\nstate of justification from the (objective) fact of\ntruth, and clarifies that what is intrinsic to cognition has\nto do with the former. This is why P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi can\ncoherently take the whole doctrine of intrinsic validity precisely to\ndepend on what U\u1e43veka took to be an unwanted\nconsequence:\u00a0 its being all determinately contentful\ncognitions that can reasonably be assumed immediately to confer\njustification.\n\n\nOn this reading, then, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine is to be\nunderstood as holding that it is characteristic of contentful\ncognitions immediately to confer justification, with the\nmediation of higher-order cognitions capable not of conferring anything\nessentially different in kind, but only of calling for revision. If,\nabsent the arising of any overriding cognition, the prima facie\njustification holds, then the initial cognition stands as veridical\nin virtue of the fact that it was truth-conducive\u2014in\nvirtue of the fact, as P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi puts this point, that\n\u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d (pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya)\nis the \u201cmotivator of the concept and the word\n\u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47abuddhi\u015babdayor bh\u0101vakatay\u0101).\nThis effectively reverses the direction of explanation favored by\nU\u1e43veka, who is instead concerned to argue that the status of\nbeing truth-conducive is caused by the same factors that cause\nveridical cognitions.\n\n\nIf it seems like settling for less thus to argue, with\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi, that defeasible justification is all that can\nbe yielded by our epistemic practices, he can rejoin by asking whether it could make sense to want anything more\nthan that; what could it look like, epistemically, not only to be\njustified in holding a belief, but also to know it is\ntrue? In fact, this is already just what one is entitled to\nthink in virtue of being justified, and it is hard to imagine what\nsense it could make to think we might be, with respect to any\nparticular belief, in a better epistemic position than already\nentitled to think it true. Indeed, it is arguably just the\npoint of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology thus to challenge the\nintuition that \u201cknowing\u201d could only consist in knowing\nthat one knows. Just, then, as with the influential efforts\nof contemporary \u201creformed epistemologists\u201d to undermine\nthe threat of \u201cevidentialist\u201d challenges (see, especially,\nAlston 1991, as well as Arnold 2005), Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\namounts to a critique of empiricist foundationalism\u2014one that\ngets its purchase largely by showing that the foundationalist impulse\nends up leading to intractable skeptical problems such as can only be\nforeclosed by an appeal to common sense.\n",
