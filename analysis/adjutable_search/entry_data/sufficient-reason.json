    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nSuppose you enter a farmers\u2019 market, pick out a few cucumbers\nand ask the merchant for the price. \u201cFive dollars a\npound\u201d. A bit expensive, you may think, but you pay. Before you\nleave the stand two other people approach the seller with the very\nsame question (\u201cHow much are the cucumbers?\u201d). \u201cA\ndollar a pound\u201d, she says to the one; \u201cTen dollars a\npound\u201d, she tells the other. At least two of you are likely to\nattack the merchant with a simple question: Why the price discrepancy?\nOf course, you may simply leave the place if you have a simple\nexplanation for the discrepancy (for example, that both you and the\nperson who was asked to pay ten dollars a pound belong to commonly\ndiscriminated minorities). You may also conclude that the seller is\njust out of her mind (or that she is just conducting a psychological\nexperiment). In all of these cases you will be entertaining an\nexplanation or reason for a fact that appears odd.\nBut what kinds of facts demand an explanation? Do all\nfacts\u2014including the most ordinary ones\u2014demand an\nexplanation? If you accept an unrestricted form of the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason (= PSR), you will require an explanation for\nany fact, or in other words, you will reject the possibility\nof any brute, or unexplainable, facts.\n\nA simple formulation of the principle is as follows:\n\n(1)\nFor every fact \\(F\\), there must be a sufficient reason why\n\\(F\\) is the case.\n\n\nThe term \u201cfact\u201d in the above formulation is not intended\nto express any commitment to an ontology of facts. Still, if one\nwishes to avoid such connotations, the principle can be formulated\nmore schematically:\n\n(2)\nFor every \\(x\\), there is a \\(y\\) such that \\(y\\)\nis the sufficient reason for \\(x\\) (formally:\n\\(\\forall x\\exists y\\, Ryx\\) [where\n\u201c\\(Ryx\\)\u201d denotes the binary relation of providing a\nsufficient reason]).\n\n\nThe PSR is, in fact, a family of principles which are\ngenerated by various restrictions of (2), and by ascriptions of\ndifferent degrees of modal strength to (2). To begin with, variants of\nthe PSR may differ according to how they restrict the kinds of\nthings that require a reason (the explananda). Thus, one might\nrestrict the PSR to only actual entities, or include possibilia as\nwell. Alternatively, one might formulate the PSR as requiring a\nsufficient reason for every (true) proposition or as pertaining to\nentities and their properties. A variant of the PSR restricted to\nentities might require an explanation for the existence and\nnon-existence of entities, or it might be further restricted by\nrequiring a reason only for the existence (or only for the\nnon-existence) of entities. A version of the PSR that is restricted to\npropositions might range over both contingent and necessary\npropositions, or it might be further restricted to only one of these\nsub-domains.\n\nSimilarly, different versions of the PSR issue from various ways of\nrestricting the kinds of things that count as providing a\nreason (the explanantia). It is likely (though not necessary)\nthat one\u2019s decision about the kinds of explananda that fall\nunder the range of the PSR will determine the kinds of things counted\nas explanantia.\n\nVariants of the PSR may be generated not only by placing restrictions\non the relata at stake (both the explananda and the explanantia), but\nalso on the notion of the relation at stake. Frequently, the relation\nof providing a reason is conceived as irreflexive, antisymmetric and\ntransitive, though each of these characteristics may be, and indeed\nhave been, challenged. The relation of providing a reason can be\nconceived as an ontological relation (as in contemporary discussions\nof ground), or as a purely epistemological relation.\n\nA modally strong version of the PSR will take the Principle as\nnecessary and obtaining in all possible worlds, while a weak modal\nversion will present the Principle as merely contingently true.\nAnother distinction can be drawn between a factive, as\nopposed to merely regulative, version of the Principle. A\nregulative version of the PSR would consider it as a condition for\nintelligibility (on a par with the Law of Non-Contradiction) and\nthus as guiding our studying of nature. The factive version simply\nstates that the Principle is true in actuality (or even in all\npossible worlds). The regulative and the factive versions differ in\nterms of allowing for the falsification of the principle. The factive\nversion could be easily refuted by a single counter-example. A\nproponent of the regulative variant of the PSR would argue that an\nempirical falsification of the PSR makes as little sense as an\nempirical falsification of the Law of Non-Contradiction. Encountering\na fact which seems to have no explanation, the proponent of\nthe regulative variant would respond by insisting that we must keep\nsearching for an explanation.\n\nA proponent of the unrestricted version of the PSR could argue that\none\u2019s choice of a specific variant of the PSR cannot be\narbitrary, on pain of inconsistency (i.e., one must provide a reason\nwhy to prefer one variant over others). Relying on this last point,\nshe may further contend that in the absence of compelling reasons to\nthe contrary, the unrestricted version of the Principle should be\nconsidered as default.\n\nOne of the most interesting questions regarding the PSR is why accept\nit at all. Insofar as the PSR stipulates that all things must be\nexplainable, it seems that the PSR itself demands an explanation.\nSeveral modern philosophers attempted to provide a proof for the PSR,\nthough so far these attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Another\nimportant question related to the PSR is the possibility of\nself-explanatory facts and self-caused entities; particularly, one\nmight wonder how these are distinguished from unexplainable, brute\nfacts and uncaused entities. One might also wonder whether the PSR\nallows for any primitive concepts that cannot be further\nexplained.\n\nA third crucial problem for proponents of the PSR is how to address\nthe Agrippan Trilemma between the apparently exhaustive three horns\nof: (i) acceptance of brute facts, (ii) acceptance of an infinite\nregress of explanation (or grounding), or (iii) acceptance of\nself-explanatory facts. Prima facie, each horn in the\ntrilemma undermines the position of the proponent of the PSR.\n\nFinally, the proponent of the PSR faces intriguing problems in\naddressing perfectly symmetrical states. We have seen that some\nvariants of the PSR require an explanation for the existence of\nthings (thus, assuming nonexistence as a \u201cdefault\u201d\nstate requiring no explanation), while other variants require an\nexplanation for both the existence and nonexistence of\nthings. Let us look quickly at the latter\n(\u201cdefault\u201d-free) variant. Specifically, we might wonder\nhow a proponent of the \u201cdefault\u201d-free variant of the PSR\nwould respond to a situation in which we have neither a reason for the\nexistence of \\(x\\), nor have a reason for the non-existence of\n\\(x\\)? A proponent of the PSR might indeed respond by denying the\npossibility of such a scenario (given the PSR and bivalence). A\nsimilar dilemma might be raised with regard to issues of identity:\ngiven the absence of a reason for the identity of \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\), as well as for their non-identity, should we assume either\nidentity or non-identity as a default\n position?[1]\n\nWith these general considerations in place, let us examine the\nhistorical role that the Principle has played. The term\n\u201cPrinciple of Sufficient Reason [principe de raison\nsuffisante/principium reddendae rationis]\u201d was coined by\nLeibniz, though Spinoza is thought by many scholars to have preceded\nLeibniz in appreciating the importance of the Principle and placing it\nat the center of his philosophical\n system.[2]\n The Principle seems at first sight to have a strong intuitive\nappeal\u2014we always ask for explanations\u2014yet it is taken by\nmany to be too bold and expensive due to the radical implications it\nseems to yield. Among the alleged consequences of the Principle are:\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles, necessitarianism, the relativity of\nspace and time, the existence of a self-necessitated Being (i.e.,\nGod), and the Principle of Plenitude.\n\nThough there are several important precursors who, as we will see,\nseem to advocate variants of the PSR before the modern period, we will\nbegin our discussion with the two main expositors of the Principle:\nSpinoza and Leibniz.\n2. Spinoza\n\nThe earliest statement of the PSR in Spinoza\u2019s writings appears in his\nfirst published work, the 1663 geometrical exposition of\nDescartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy (which may or may\nnot reflect Spinoza\u2019s own views at the time). The eleventh axiom of\nPart I of the book states:\n\nNothing exists of which it cannot be asked, what is the cause (or\nreason) [causa (sive ratio)], why it exists.\n\nIn a brief explanatory note to this axiom, Spinoza adds:\n\n\nSince existing is something positive, we cannot say that it has\nnothing as its cause (by Axiom 7). Therefore, we must assign some\npositive cause, or reason, why [a thing] exists\u2014either an\nexternal one, i.e., one outside the thing itself, or an internal one,\none comprehended in the nature and definition of the existing thing\nitself. (Geb.\n I/158/4\u20139)[3]\n\n\nAxiom 7, to which Spinoza appeals in the explanation, is a variant of\nthe \u201cex nihilo, nihil fit\u201d (\u201cfrom nothing,\nnothing comes\u201d) principle, and stipulates that an existing thing\nand its perfections (or qualities) cannot have nothing or a\nnon-existing thing as their cause. Interestingly, however, in another\nwork from this early period of his philosophical writing, the\nTreatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, Spinoza allows\nfor one unique item to be without a cause. In \u00a770 of this\ntreatise, Spinoza argues:\n\n\n[T]hat Thought is also called true which involves objectively the\nessence of some principle that does not have a cause, and is\nknown through itself and in itself. (II/26/33\u20134. Our\nemphasis)\n\n\nIt is not completely clear what \u201cthe principle\n[principium]\u201d at stake is, but given its qualification\nas \u201cknown through itself and in itself\u201d, it may refer to\nGod and indicate Spinoza\u2019s understanding of Descartes\u2019\nrather nuanced view\u2014in his Second Set of Replies\u2014according\nto which God does not need a cause in order to exist, but\nthere is a reason why God does not need a cause (AT VII:\n164\u201365; cf. Carraud 2002: Ch.\n 2).[4]\n\nAccording to some commentators Spinoza states a variant of the PSR\nalready at the opening of his major work, the Ethics. The\nsecond axiom of Part One of the book reads:\n\n\nE1a2: What cannot be conceived [concipi] through another,\nmust be conceived through itself.\n\n\nThe immediate implication of E1a2 is that everything is\n conceived.[5]\n Since, for Spinoza, to conceive something is to explain it (see\nE1p10s, E1p14d and Della Rocca 2008: 5) it seems that E1a2 amounts to\nthe claim that everything is explainable. Other commentators have also\nseen the PSR encoded in E1a3:\n\n\nFrom a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and\nconversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an\neffect to follow.\n\n\nIf we interpret \u201ceffect\u201d narrowly as something with a\ncause, then the second clause is trivial. If we interpret it more\nbroadly as anything that exists, obtains, happens (or whatever the\nrelata of causation are taken to be) has a cause, then the second\nclause contains a statement of a version of the PSR: everything has a\ncause (Garrett 1979 and Lin 2017).\n\nIn E1p11d2, Spinoza states explicitly a variant of the PSR: \u201cFor\neach thing there must be assigned a cause, or reason, both\nfor its existence and for its nonexistence\u201d. Similarly, in\nE1p8s2, Spinoza argues, \u201cif a certain number of individuals\nexists, there must be a cause why those individuals, and why neither\nmore nor fewer, exist.\u201d Spinoza\u2019s insistence that even the\nnon-existence of things must be explainable is crucial. It\nallows him, for example, to argue that were God not to exist, his\nnon-existence must be explainable. Since God is a substance, Spinoza\nargues, his existence or non-existence cannot be caused or explained\nexternally (Spinoza takes substances to be causally independent of\neach other); hence, were God not to exist, his own nature would have\nto be the cause of his non-existence, just as the nature of a\nsquare-circle is the cause of the non-existence of that thing. But\nsince God\u2019s nature is not a contradictory, his nature cannot\ninternally rule out his existence, and hence he must exist\n(E1p11d).\n\nThe scope of Spinoza\u2019s PSR and its role in his system is a\ncontroversial matter. A dominant trend in recent scholarship reads\nSpinoza\u2019s PSR as having unrestricted scope and playing a crucial\nrole in deriving many of his most important doctrines (e.g., Della\nRocca 2008). But this trend has recently been challenged by readers\nwho argue that Spinoza\u2019s PSR is restricted in scope to facts\nabout existence and nonexistence and that he rarely explicitly appeals\nto this principle in deriving his signature doctrines (e.g., Garber\n2015 and Lin 2019).\n\nCommentators who give a prominent role to the PSR in Spinoza\u2019s\nsystem frequently offer rational reconstructions of Spinoza\u2019s\narguments for his doctrines that find a crucial, if implicit, role for\nthe PSR. For example, some think that the PSR is the primary\nmotivation behind Spinoza\u2019s strict necessitarianism. On this reading,\nfor Spinoza, if there are two (or more) possible worlds, it would seem\nthat neither one would have a sufficient reason or cause (for\nif there were such a sufficient reason, this world would be\nnecessitated, and all other worlds would be impossible). In other\nwords, the PSR dictates that there is only one possible world (see\nDella Rocca (2008), 69\u201378, Lin (2011), 23\u201325, and Melamed\n(2021). Other commentators, (e.g., Lin 2019), deny that the PSR plays\nany role in Spinoza\u2019s arguments for necessitarianism, and still\nothers have denied that Spinoza is a necessitarian in the relevant\nsense (e.g. Curley 1969, and Curley and Walski 1999). Moreover, there\nare commentators who, while believing that the PSR is behind\nSpinoza\u2019s necessitarianism, suggest that, occasionally,\nSpinoza\u2019s endorsement of the PSR is in tension with other\nprinciples of his metaphysics, such as the priority of the infinite\n(see Melamed (2012b), and Melamed (2013a), xvii).\n\nSpinoza holds not only that the existence of things must be explained,\nbut he is also committed to the assertion that the essences of all\nthings follow necessarily from God\u2019s essence (E1p25 and E1p16).\nHe is thus committed to the claim that all essences have a cause and\nan explanation.\n\nOther Spinozistic doctrines that some commentators have alleged to\nfollow from his PSR are the Identity of Indiscernibles (E1p4. Although\nsee Lin 2019 for a dissenting view), substance monism (E1p11 and\nE1p14), and the rejection of free will (E1p32 and E2pp48\u201349). It\nhas also been argued that in E1p21d Spinoza implicitly relies on the\nPSR to infer a bold causal principle: a simple cause has one, and only\none, simple effect. Had the cause more than one effect, the difference\nbetween the two effects would be unexplainable insofar as each effect\nis supposed to be fully explained by the same cause. Thus, if we\nexperience a cause bringing about more than one effect, we should\nconclude that that the cause was not simple, but comprised of parts\n(so that the different parts contributed to the causation of the\ndifferent effects. See Melamed (2013a), 117\u2013119, and Melamed\n(2013b), 212\u2013213.\n\nRecently, Michael Della Rocca argued not only that the PSR\n\u201cprovide[s] the key to unlocking many of the mysteries of\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophical system\u201d (2008: 9), but that\nSpinoza requires the reduction of the most basic\nphilosophical concepts to reason or intelligibility. This alleged\n\u201cdouble use of the PSR\u201d stipulates (1) that everything\nmust be explainable, and (2) that it should be (ultimately) explained\nin terms of intelligibility. Hence, according to Della Rocca, Spinoza\nreduces his major philosophical concepts\u2014existence, causation,\nrightness, and power\u2014to intelligibility (2008: 8\u20139). While\nthis is a fascinating and bold reading of Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics,\nit seems to contradict his crucial doctrine of the causal and\nconceptual barrier between the attributes (E1p10 and E2p6). The\nreduction of any non-Thought item to intelligibility (presumably, a\nfeature of the attribute of\n thought[6])\n undermines the barrier between the attributes, and with it the entire\nedifice of Spinoza\u2019s ontology (see Della Rocca 2012:\n12\u201316; Melamed 2012a; and Melamed 2013a: xv and 196 n. 84).\nMoreover, some have noted that Della Rocca\u2019s arguments for\nspecific reductions, for example, the reduction of causation to\nintelligibility requires assumptions that Spinoza explicitly rejects\n(Lin 2019 and Melamed 2013, Ch. 3).\n\nOn the reading according to which Spinoza\u2019s PSR is unrestricted,\nhow would he respond to the Agrippan Trilemma? Clearly, on this\ninterpretation, Spinoza is unsympathetic to any acceptance of brute\nfacts. Yet he allows for some, restricted cases of self-explanation\nand infinite regress of explanation. Let us take a brief look at these\ntwo issues.\n\nSpinoza begins the Ethics with the definitions of causa\nsui (E1d1), and of substance as that which \u201cis conceived\nthrough itself\u201d (E1d3). Positing these reflexive definitions at\nthe outset might have been a calculated methodological move whose aim\nwas to bypass the challenging task of proving the legitimacy of these\nnotions. But since Spinoza considers his definitions as not merely\nstipulative (see TIE \u00a795 and Ep. 60), we may well ask for a\ndefense of the legitimacy of self-explanations.\n\nThe class of truths that Spinoza considers as self-explanatory are\ntruths that follow merely from the essence or\u2014what is\nthe same\u2014the nature of a thing. In E1p11d, Spinoza provides two\nexamples of self-explanation:\n\n\n[T]he very nature of a square circle indicates the reason why it does\nnot exist, viz. because it involves a contradiction\u2026, the\nreason why a substance exists also follows from its nature alone,\nbecause it involves existence.\n\n\nIn contrast, claims Spinoza, the existence (as well as the\nnon-existence) of a triangle (or any other thing that is not a\nsubstance) do no follow merely from the essence of the\ntriangle:\n\n\nThe reason why a circle or triangle exists, or why it does not exist,\ndoes not follow from the nature of these things, but from the order of\nthe whole of corporeal Nature. (E1p11d).\n\n\nThus, consider the following three propositions: (i) The triangle has\nthree angles, (ii) The substance exists, and (iii) The triangle\nexists. Proposition (i) is clearly self-explanatory, since the essence\nof the triangle (which contains the nature of the number three and the\nnature of an angle) is the sufficient reason for its having three\nangles (adding any other information is of no explanatory value).\nSpinoza considers proposition (ii) as self-explanatory as well. Notice\nthat Spinoza does not define substance (in E1d3) as existing by virtue\nof its essence, but rather derives this claim from the definition of\nsubstance (in E1p7 and E1p6). In contrast to (i) and (ii), the\nexistence of a triangle does not follow merely from its essence (since\nit is caused by entities external to the triangle, and therefore has\nto be explained through these external causes).\n\nLet us turn now to the question of the legitimacy of infinite regress.\nIn E1p28, Spinoza openly states that within each attribute there is an\ninfinite causal chain of finite modes:\n\n\nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence;\nand again, this cause also can neither exist nor be determined to\nproduce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an\neffect by another, which is also finite and has a determinate\nexistence, and so on, to infinity. [Italics added]\n\n\nEach link in this causal chain is preceded by infinitely many causes\nand is followed by infinitely many effects. Each link also provides at\nleast part of the explanation for the existence of the\nfollowing link. Is the existence of such an infinite regress\nconsistent with the PSR? Spinoza has no qualms about answering this\nquestion in the positive. We may legitimately ask what is the cause of\neach link in the chain, and the answer would be: the preceding link.\nSpinoza also thinks that we may\u2014indeed, should\u2014ask what is\nthe cause, or reason, for the existence of the entire infinite\nchain? He simply thinks that he can provide a clear answer to the\nlatter question as well: God (or the being which is the ground of its\nown existence). Consider the following passage from Spinoza\u2019s\ncelebrated \u201cLetter on the Infinite\u201d in which he criticizes\nproofs of the existence of God which rely on the impossibility of an\nactual infinity of causes and effects.\n\n\nIn passing I should like to note here that the more recent\nPeripatetics have, as I think, misunderstood the demonstration by\nwhich the Ancients tried to prove God\u2019s existence. For as I find\nit in a certain Jew, called Rab Chasdai, it runs as follows: if\nthere is an infinite regress of causes, then all things that\nare will also have been caused; but it does not pertain to anything\nwhich has been caused, to exist necessarily by the force of its own\nnature; therefore, there is nothing in Nature to whose essence it\npertains to exist necessarily; but the latter is absurd; therefore,\nthe former is also. Hence the force of this argument does not lie\nin the impossibility of there being an actual infinite or an infinite\nregress of causes, but only in the supposition that things which do\nnot exist necessarily by their own nature are not determined to exist\nby a thing which does necessarily exist by its own nature. [Ep.\n12| IV/61/15\u201362/10; italics added]\n\n\nIn this passage, Spinoza follows the late medieval Jewish philosopher\nHasdai Crescas in rejecting the Aristotelian ban on actual infinity\n(see Melamed 2014). For Spinoza (and Crescas) the existence of an\ninfinite regress of causes is perfectly legitimate. Yet, if all the\nitems in this infinite chain are contingent beings (i.e.,\n\u201cthings which do not exist necessarily by their own\n nature\u201d[7]),\n the chain itself remains a contingent being, and there must be a\nreason which explains its instantiation in reality. The ultimate\nreason for the instantiation of such an infinite chain of contingent\nbeings must, claims Spinoza, be a being whose existence is not\ncontingent (for otherwise, the chain will remain merely contingent and\nits instantiation in reality would not be sufficiently explained).\nThus, Spinoza allows for an infinite regress of causes (or\nexplanations) as long as the entire infinite chain is grounded in a\nbeing which exists by virtue of its mere essence.\n3. Leibniz\n\nNo philosopher is more closely associated with the PSR than Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). He was the first to call it by name\nand to recognize it as a major principle of philosophy. Still, Leibniz\nwas well aware of the similarity between his principle and\nSpinoza\u2019s claims. Thus, in a 1676 marginal note to his copy of\nSpinoza\u2019s \u201cLetter on the Infinite\u201d (which we have\njust discussed at the end of \u00a72), he writes: \u201cThis is\nrightly observed, and agrees with what I am accustomed to saying that\nnothing exists but that for whose existence a sufficient reason can be\nprovided\u201d (Leibniz, Labyrinth of the Continuum, 117/\nAiii71). Leibniz\u2019s treatment of the PSR is also noteworthy for\nits systematicity and the centrality that he accords it.\n\nLeibniz often presents it, along with the Principle of Contradiction,\nas a principle of \u201creasoning\u201d. For example, in the\nMonadology (1714) he writes:\n\n\n31. Our reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction, in virtue of which we judge that which involves a\ncontradiction to be false, and that which is opposed or contradictory\nto the false to be true.\n\n32. And that of sufficient reason, by virtue of which we consider that\nwe can find no true or existent fact [fait], no true\nassertion [\u00e9nonciation v\u00e9ritable], without\nthere being a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise,\nalthough most of the time these reasons cannot be known to us. (G VI,\n612/L 646)\n\n\nThese principles are characterized in what appears to be epistemic\nterms. They are principles of \u201cour reasoning\u201d. They\nconcern what we \u201cjudge\u201d or \u201cfind\u201d. And yet it\nis clear that Leibniz intends them to have metaphysical as well as\nepistemic import. In the case of the PSR, this will become more\nevident when we discuss how Leibniz understands the notion of a\nsufficient reason but it is already indicated in the passage quoted\nabove by the fact that Leibniz explicitly states that there are\nsufficient reasons for every truth or fact even if such reasons are\nunknowable by us. (The distinction between the epistemic and\nthe metaphysical collapses with respect to God because there can\nbe no gap between what an omniscient being knows and how things\nare.) \n\nThe scope of the PSR, as stated above, includes facts and truths.\nLeibniz sometimes, however, characterizes the scope of the principle\nin different terms. For example, he writes:\n\n\n[T]he principle of sufficient reason, namely, that nothing\nhappens [rien n\u2019arrive] without a reason. (G\nVII 356; LC L2; AG 321, our emphasis)\n\n\nThe PSR is here said to apply to what \u201chappens\u201d. This\nsuggests a version of the PSR that applies not to truths or facts but\nrather events: Every event has a sufficient reason.\n\nThese vacillations in the formulation of the PSR are not typically\ntaken to register indecision on Leibniz\u2019s part as to the scope\nof the PSR. Rather they are usually understood as indicating that\nLeibniz views the scope of the PSR to be very wide, perhaps even\nabsolutely general, but at least wide enough to encompass facts,\ntruths, and events (see Rodriguez-Pererya 2018).\n\nLeibniz associates the Principle of Contradiction and the PSR with a\nvariety of domains where each is especially important. For example,\nthere are domains where the truths of the domain depend on\none of the two principles. These domains are characterized modally:\nThe Principle of Contradiction rules over the domain of necessary\ntruths and the PSR rules over the domain of contingent truths (A 6 4\n1616/MP 75; G VII 355\u201356/LC 15\u201316).\n\nThere are also domains that are characterized in terms of subject\nmatter or areas of inquiry. The Principle of Contradiction allows us\nto study mathematics, whereas the PSR allows us to study metaphysics,\nnatural theology, and physics (G VII, 355\u20136; LC L2; AG 321). It\nis far from obvious that these two ways of assigning domains to the\nPrinciples are equivalent. For example, it would be natural to assume\nthat metaphysics and natural theology would include necessary\npropositions and thus the PSR would encroach upon the territory\nassigned to the Principle of Contradiction according to the modal\ncharacterization.\n\nWe must therefore distinguish distinct ways of associating the\nprinciples with various domains. The first way is to specify the\ndomain to which each principle applies. Leibniz appears to\nbelieve that, according to this approach, there is a single universal\ndomain and it is associated equally with each principle. There are no\ncontradictory contingent facts or truths and so the Principle of\nNoncontradiction applies to all contingent truths as well as\nall necessary truths. Likewise, it is usually assumed that, for\nLeibniz, every necessary truth has a sufficient reason (see Broad\n1975: 12 and 34 and Rodriguez-Pererya 2018). For example, mathematical\ntruths, might have sufficient reasons in the form of proofs that rest\non statements of identity. Thus the PSR applies to all\nnecessary truths as well as all contingent truths.\n\nThe second way of associating the principles with specific domains is\nto specify the domain of truths that is grounded on or\ndepends on each principle. According to Leibniz, only\ncontingent truths depend on and are grounded by the PSR. Likewise,\nLeibniz believes that only necessary truths depend on and are grounded\nby the Principle of Contradiction. What does it mean for some truths\nto depend on a principle? Leibniz is not explicit on this\npoint but we will get a better idea in the next section when we\nconsider the question of what counts as a sufficient reason.\n\nThe third way is to specify a domain of truths that can be\ninvestigated on the basis of each principle. For Leibniz, we\ncan know mathematical truths only on the basis of the Principle of\nContradiction and only metaphysical, theological, and physical truths\nrequire the PSR in order to be known. We will see in more detail in\nwhat way the PSR allows us to investigate these domains in the section\non applications.\n3.1 What is a Sufficient Reason?\n\nWhen Leibniz insists that every truth or fact requires a sufficient\nreason, what does he mean by \u201csufficient reason?\u201d In some\ntexts he suggests that sufficient reason is an \u201ca\npriori proof\u201d. This should not be understood in Kantian\nterms as a proof that doesn\u2019t require any input from sense\nexperience. Rather, Leibniz uses the term \u201ca\npriori\u201d in its original pre-Kantian meaning, which means an\nargument from causes to effects. An a priori proof is a proof\nthat reflects the causal order. Thus, a sufficient reason would be a\nproof that is both a demonstration\u2014a set of premises and a\nconclusion such that the former necessitate the later\u2013and a\ncausal explanation\u2014a statement of the causal antecedents of some\ntruth or event (see Adams 1994: 109). \n\nIn order to fully understand Leibniz\u2019s conception of a\nsufficient reason, we need to also understand his theory of truth and\nits relationship to his theory of modality. Let us begin with truth.\nTo keep things simple, we will focus only on categorical propositions\nof subject-predicate form. A proposition is true, according to\nLeibniz, just in case the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. Uncontroversially, the concept of the\npredicate unmarried is contained in the concept\nbachelor and it is this conceptual containment which explains\nthe truth of the statement bachelors are unmarried. But\nLeibniz makes the further highly controversial claim that all\ntrue statements are true for this reason, even statements like\nCaesar crossed the Rubicon. That is, this statement is true\nbecause the concept crossed the Rubicon is contained in the\nconcept of Caesar. This theory of truth is sometimes called the\nconceptual containment theory of truth. It has as a\nconsequence that all truths are analytic. But wouldn\u2019t such a\ntheory entail that all truths are necessary? After all, how could an\nanalytic truth be contingent?\n\nIn response to this worry, Leibniz develops an account of contingency\nin terms of infinite\n analysis.[8]\n Leibniz understands analysis as the process of replacing the terms of\na proposition with definitions or partial definitions. A demonstration\nresults when an identity is obtained through the process of analysis\nin a finite number of steps. Leibniz claims that all and only\nnecessary truths have a finite demonstration by analysis and all and\nonly contingent truths do not have a demonstration by analysis in a\nfinite number of steps. In this way, he preserves the distinction\nbetween necessary and contingent truths while also maintaining that\nall truths are analytic, that is, true in virtue of the meaning of the\nconcepts involved.\n\nThis has led some commenters to think that Leibniz gave up the account\nof sufficient reason as an a priori proof. If there were a\nproof or demonstration, it would reveal that the concept of the\npredicate was contained in the concept of the subject in a finite\nnumber of steps and hence every proposition would be necessary.\nLeibniz is not a necessitarian in his late philosophy and thus he\ncould not have accepted this consequence. Instead, he must have\nshifted from the conception of a sufficient reason as an a\npriori proof to that of an a priori proof sequence,\nwhere the latter notion is understood as an analysis that converges on\nan identity without reaching it in a finite number of steps (see\nSleigh 1983: 200). What it means for an analysis to converge on an\nidentity is, unfortunately, obscure. Nevertheless, there is some clear\nsense in which every contingent truth has a sufficient reason on this\nunderstanding. The sufficient reason why it is true that Caesar\ncrossed the Rubicon, for example, is that the concept crossing the\nRubicon is contained in the concept Caesar. The truth of\nthe proposition obtains in virtue of the concepts of the subject and\nthe predicate. Of course, this reason is undiscoverable by any finite\nhuman mind because it is buried too deeply in the concept of Caesar.\nOnly God, in his omniscience sees the conceptual connection between\nthem. It is enough for there to be such a connection for there be a\nsufficient reason.\n\nSuch a conception of the nature of a sufficient reason have led some\ncommentators to think that for Leibniz the PSR is a logical notion or\nthat it is a metaphysical notion that is ultimately reducible to logic\n(Couturat 1901: 123ff and Russell 1937: v). But the notion of a\nsufficient reason as a non-terminating proof sequence is not the only\nconception of a sufficient reason to be found in Leibniz. And other\nconceptions have a decidedly less logical and more metaphysical\nflavor.\n\nOne such characterization of a sufficient reason comes from\nLeibniz\u2019s conviction that in order to preserve the notion of\ncausal activity, without which substances are not really\nsubstances\u2014i.e., truly fundamental building blocks of reality.\nEach genuine substance, for Leibniz, has what he calls a\n\u201cprimitive active force\u201d. This force is the nature or\nessence of the substance. Now according to Leibniz, substances do\nnot causally interact with one another (see the entry\n Leibniz on causation).\n The changes that they undergo derive solely from their own natures or\nprimitive active force, which consequently determines the whole of its\nhistory. Many texts suggest that, for Leibniz, the sufficient reason\nfor any state of a substance is its primitive active force (NE\n65\u20136; T 400/G VI, 354; Mon. 18/G VI, 609\u2013610; G IV, 507; G\nIII, 72).\n\nIn many ways primitive active force plays the role of the concept of\nthe subject in the logical version of the PSR. Just as on the logical\nversion the PSR that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) is explained by the fact\nthat the concept of \\(F\\)-ness is in the concept of \\(a\\),\nso too on the metaphysical version of the PSR fact that \\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\) is explained by the primitive active force of \\(a\\)\nthat determines it to be \\(F\\). Whereas commentators such as\nCouturat and Russell emphasize the logical notion of a sufficient\nreason to the detriment of the metaphysical notion, other commentators\nsee the logical and the metaphysical as two equally fundamental\npresentations of the same datum (see Frankel 1994).\n\nAnother metaphysical characterization of a sufficient reason connects\nwith the Principle of the Best, which says that for any proposition\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) is true just in case \\(p\\) holds in the\nbest possible world (G VI.448/DM 22; Mon. 46, 53, 54/G VI,\n614\u2013616). Is the Principle of the Best a supplement to the PSR\nor a rival to the PSR? It is, in fact, a consequence of the PSR in\nconjunction with three additional assumptions: (1) the sufficient\nreason for every choice is that the chooser perceives it to be the\nbest; (2) God chooses the actual world; (3) God perceives something to\nbe what is best just in case it is the best.\n\nIn some texts, Leibniz suggests that the sufficient reason for\ncontingent truths cannot be found in the concepts or natures of\nthings. We must instead look to the Principle of the Best (Mon.\n36\u201338/G VI, 613). In other words the sufficient reason for any\ncontingent proposition of the form \u201c\\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\)\u201d is that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) is true in the best\npossible word. This appears to be an entirely different sort of reason\nthan the fact that \u201c\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d is analytic\nor that the nature of \\(a\\) determines that it is \\(F\\).\nThose latter reasons are to be found internal to the concept of the\nsubject or the nature of the substance. Reasons that advert to the\nPrinciple of the Best look outside the concept of the subject or the\nnature of the substance and make comparisons between worlds in terms\nof their relative perfections. It is possible that Leibniz thought\nthat these different conceptions of sufficient reasons were equivalent\nbut that they are so is far from obvious.\n3.2 Why Did Leibniz Believe the PSR?\n\nLeibniz argues for the PSR in three distinct ways: (1) from the\nconcept of a sufficient reason and the concept of a\n\u201crequisite\u201d; (2) from his theory of truth; and (3)\ninductively.\n\nIn some texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR is a conceptual truth that\nis derivable from the concepts of a sufficient reason and the concept\nof a requisite (A VI, ii, 483; see also G VII 393, LC L5.18; A\nVI.iii.133). The concept of a requisite is that of a necessary\ncondition. In this context, Leibniz defines a sufficient reason as a\nsufficient condition. If something exists, then all of its requisites\nhave been posited. Leibniz then asserts that if all of a things\nrequisites have been posited, then it exists. Thus, all of a\nthing\u2019s requisites are a thing\u2019s sufficient reason. The\nquestion-begging assumption is that all the necessary conditions for\nsomething to exist are jointly sufficient for it to exist. Anybody who\ndenies the PSR will not agree with this assumption and it is clearly\nnot encoded in the definitions of requisite and\nsufficient reason provided by Leibniz (for further\ndiscussion, see Harrop 2020).\n\nIn other texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR follows from the\nconceptual containment theory of truth (A VI.iv.1645/L 268; AG 31).\nEvery truth is such that the concept of the predicate is contained the\nconcept of the subject. This conceptual connection is the sufficient\nreason for the truth. Thus every truth has a sufficient reason.\n\nIt is worth noting that Leibniz believed the PSR before he developed\nhis conceptual containment Theory of Truth. In fact, the PSR is one of\nLeibniz\u2019s earliest and most stable philosophical commitments\n(see, for example, Leibniz\u2019s 1671 letter to Wedderkopf A\nII.ii.117f/L146). This observation has led some scholars to conclude\nthat rather than deriving the PSR from the conceptual containment\ntheory of truth, Leibniz was in fact led to the conceptual containment\ntheory from his antecedent commitment to the PSR. The conceptual\ncontainment theory explains how there could be a sufficient reason for\nevery truth by guaranteeing that there will be an explanation in terms\nof conceptual relations (see Adams 1994: 69). Moreover, in at least\none text, it is not at all clear whether, for Leibniz, the conceptual\ncontainment theory of truth motivates the PSR, or rather it is the PSR\nwhich motivates the conceptual containment theory of truth: see\nLeibniz, Philosophical Writings, 172).\n\nIn his Fifth paper to Clarke, Leibniz argues for the PSR inductively.\nHe says that there are many cases where a fact has a sufficient reason\nand no cases where fact is known not to have a sufficient reason. He\nthen says that it is reasonable to assume that the PSR holds in all\ncases where we do not know that sufficient reason. Leibniz describes\nthis as \u201cthe method of experimental philosophy, which proceeds\na posteriori\u201d (G VII 420; LC, L5.129).\n3.3 Applications\n\nLeibniz says that PSR is needed if we are to go beyond mathematics to\nmetaphysics and natural science. How does the PSR help in those\ndomains of inquiry? There is a general pattern of argument that\nLeibniz uses to establish conclusions using the PSR. First, he assumes\nthe falsity of what he wants to prove. Call the proposition to be\nproved \\(p\\). Then he tries to show that if \\(p\\) were\nfalse, there would be some fact or truth for which there could not be\nsufficient reason. But by the PSR, there is no such fact or truth.\nTherefore, \\(p\\) is true. Leibniz uses this template to argue for\na number of claims, including the indefinite extension of space\n(Labyrinth of the Continuum, 233), determinism\n(Leibniz-Stahl Controversy, 17), the impossibility of bare\noccult qualities and bare faculties (Philosophical Writings,\n172\u20133), the identity of indiscernibles, relationalism with\nrespect to space and time, and the existence of God. Let us briefly\nlook at how Leibniz uses the PSR to argue for each of the last three\ntheses.\n\nLeibniz presents arguments for the existence of God from the PSR in a\nnumber of different places (for example, The Ultimate Origination\nof Things, G VII 302\u20133; L 486\u20138. Monadology\n\u00a737). Suppose that God does not exist. If God does not exist,\nthen the only things that exist are contingent beings. Would the\nentire series of contingent things have an explanation? The\nexplanation of the entire series cannot be a member of the series\nsince then it would explain itself and no contingent thing is\nself-explanatory. But the explanation cannot be outside of the series\nbecause we have assumed that there is no non-contingent being, i.e.,\nGod. Thus if God did not exist, there would be something unexplained:\nthe series of contingent beings. Everything has an explanation.\nTherefore God exists (notice, the similarity to the argument for\nGod\u2019s existence Spinoza cites in the name of Crescas which we\nhave just discussed at the end of \u00a72 above. In fact, this proof\nby Leibniz appears in a 1676 gloss to his copy of Spinoza\u2019s\nletter discussing Crescas\u2019 proof. See Leibniz, The Labyrinth\nof the Continuum, 117).\n\nLeibniz also thinks that the PSR rules out the possibility that there\ncould be two or more indistinguishable, that is, indiscernible, things\n(A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). If there were two such things, God would have\ntreated them differently insofar as he has related them differently to\nthe rest of the world. For example, if there were two blades of grass\nthat were indiscernible from each other, then one blade would stand in\nspatial and temporal relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world,\nwhereas the other blade would stand in some other spatial and temporal\nrelation \\(R'\\) to the rest of the world. Why did God\nchoose to put the first blade relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the\nworld instead of \\(R'\\)? Leibniz claims that since they are\nindiscernible from each other, there could be no reason for\nGod to treat them differently. Thus if there were two indiscernible\nindividuals, then God would have acted for no reason. But there is a\nreason for everything. So, there are no indiscernible yet numerically\ndistinct things.\n\nFor similar reasons, Leibniz thinks that space and time cannot be\nsubstances or anything else absolute and must ultimately be a system\nof relations that obtain between bodies (e.g., LC, L, 3.5). This is\nbecause if space, for example, were absolute, then there would be\nspace points that were indiscernible from one another. God would treat\nthese space points differently from each other insofar as he orients\nhis creation in space one way rather than another. This would have to\nbe an arbitrary decision for the reasons outlined above. So, space and\ntime are not absolute (see Lin 2011).\n\nNext to the PSR, Leibniz also holds a complimentary principle\naccording to which nothing is without effects, or \u201cnothing is\nsterile\u201d (see, for example, Monadology \u00a769 and AG 38).\n4. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\n\nAt the beginning of this entry we have addressed briefly the question\nof motivating the PSR. The PSR demands that all facts must have a\nsufficient explanation, and were the PSR itself unmotivated, it would\nseem to simply refute itself. We have also seen that overall\nLeibniz\u2019s attempts to justify the PSR were not particularly\nsuccessful (in Spinoza\u2019s early works there is an attempt to\njustify the PSR, but he deserted this path in his later works). In\nthis section, we would like to discuss one of the most intriguing\nattempts to justify the PSR as an exceptionless methodological\nprinciple. The arguments we are about to discuss appear in\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s 1740 Institutions de\nphysique (Foundations of Physics) \u201costensibly a\ntextbook in physics for her son, but in reality, a highly original\nwork in natural philosophy\u201d (Detlefsen 2018, \u00a71). In this\nwork, Du Ch\u00e2telet attempts to provide a unified Newtonian\nnatural philosophy that is grounded in metaphysics. Just like Leibniz,\ndu Ch\u00e2telet views the principle of contradiction and the\nprinciple of sufficient reason as the two fundamental principles of\nphilosophy.\n\nImmediately after presenting the PSR, Du Ch\u00e2telet turns to\njustify the principle:\n\n\nIf we tried to deny this great principle, we would fall into strange\ncontradictions. For as soon as one accepts that something may happen\nwithout sufficient reason, one cannot be sure of anything, for\nexample, that a thing is the same as it was the moment before, since\nthis thing could change at any moment into another of a different\nkind; thus truths, for us, would exist only for an instant.\n\nFor example, I declare that all is still in my room in the state in\nwhich I left it, because I am certain that no one has entered since I\nleft; but if the principle of sufficient reason does not apply, my\ncertainty becomes a chimera since everything could have been thrown\ninto confusion in my room, without anyone having entered who was able\nto turn it upside down (Foundations of Physics, \u00a78| Du\nCh\u00e2telet 2009, 129)\n\n\nWithout the PSR, claims Du Ch\u00e2telet, we cannot be certain that\nthe unexperienced world has the continuity and unity we always assume.\nWere we not to assume the PSR, we should be seriously concerned about\nthe possibility of things appearing out of thin air and disappearing\ninto nothing. Without the PSR, we cannot assume the permanence of\nanything. The very fact that we are not concerned about the sudden\nappearance or disappearance of things, seems to indicate that we\nactually assume the PSR. Moreover, claims Du Ch\u00e2telet, our very\nfoundational notions of equality and identity, seem to assume the\nprinciple:\n\n\nWithout this principle there would not be identical things, for two\nthings are identical when one can substitute one for the other without\nany change to the properties which are being considered. This\ndefinition is accepted by everyone. Thus, for example, if I have a\nball made out of stone, and a ball of lead, and I am able to put the\none in the place of the other in a basin of a pair of scales without\nthe balance changing, I say that the weight of these balls is\nidentical, that is the same, and that they are identical in\nterms of weight. If something could happen without a sufficient\nreason, I would be unable to state that the weight of the balls is\nidentical, at the very instant when I find that it is identical, since\na change could happen in one and not the other for no reason at all\n(Foundations of Physics, \u00a78| Du Ch\u00e2telet 2009,\n129)\n\n\nWhen we compare two balls on a scale and infer that their weight is\nequal from the fact that neither side of the scale drops lower, we\nassume that the scales do not remain balanced without a reason.\nHowever, if thing could happen without reason, our inference would be\nunwarranted.\n\nAccording to some commentators, Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s last\nargument shows not only that everything must have a sufficient reason,\nbut also that this reason must be accessible to us (i.e.,\nhumans, or finite cognizers), at least in principle (Amijee 2021 and\nWells 2021). Here is why. Consider the scales scenario in a world in\nwhich the PSR obtains strictly (and we are aware of this), but some\nreasons are in principle inaccessible to us. In such a world, we could\nnot infer with certainty the equality of the balls from the horizontal\nstates of the scales, since we should consider the possibility of\ninterfering causes that are inaccessible to us.\n\nA version of the PSR which requires that all reasons must be\naccessible to humans is not easy to accept: why should we assume that\nthe nature of the world is such that it is cognitive accessible to any\nspecific being? Of course, an anthropocentric version of the PSR might\nbe warranted if one assumes that the world was created by a benevolent\ncreator who intentionally designed the world in such a manner that it\nwill always be accessible to human beings, but this cluster of heavy\npremises would be clearly rejected by many proponents of the PSR (such\nas Spinoza).\n\nSetting aside the question of whether Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s last\nargument indeed requires that reasons must be accessible to humans, it\nseems she does offer a promising line of motivating the PSR as a\nregulative rather than a factive principle (see \u00a71 above). \n5. The PSR before Spinoza and Leibniz\n\nThe PSR is nearly as old as philosophy itself. Anaximander, one of the\nearliest of the pre-Socratics, is usually credited\u2014on the basis\nof Aristotle\u2019s de Caelo, (b12\n295b10\u201316)\u2014with being the first to make use of it.\nAnaximander argues, we are told, that the Earth remains stationary in\nspace because it is located in the center of the universe and thus is\n\u201cindifferently\u201d related to any \u201cextreme\npoint\u201d. This indifference means that if it were to move in any\ndirection, it would do so without a reason. Since he concludes from\nthis that it does not move, we can assume that Anaximander believes\nthat motion in the absence of a reason is impossible.\n\nParmenides, another pre-Socratic, implicitly appeals to the PSR when\nhe claims that the world cannot have come into existence because then\nit would have come from nothing (Fragment B8 9\u201310). It is\nagainst the later alternative that Parmenides appears to wield the\nPSR. Nothing comes from nothing because if it did, then we could ask:\nwhy did it not come into existence at an earlier or a later time than\nit actually did? Parmenides appears to think that if the world comes\ninto existence from nothing, then there is no possible answer to this\nquestion. After all, prior to the coming-to-be of the world, there is\nnothing to explain its coming-to-be. Thus, its coming-to-be would be\nan arbitrary brute fact. There are no brute facts regarding\ncoming-to-be. So, the world did not come into existence from\nnothing.\n\nAnother ancient source for the PSR is Archimedes who writes:\n\n\nEqual weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights\nat unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the\nweight which is at the greater distance (On the Equilibrium of\nPlanes, 189).\n\n\nArchimedes assumes that if there is a balance such that there is no\ndifference between the weights and distances on either side, then\nneither side of the balance can move up or down. This is sometimes\ntaken to be an implicit application of the PSR and is cited by\nLeibniz in his correspondence with Clarke as a precedent for his own\nprinciple.\n\nIn the Islamic world, Avicenna appears to assume a version of the PSR\nwhen he claims that the existence or nonexistence of any non-necessary\npossible thing must have a cause outside itself. If it didn\u2019t,\nthen either the cause would be internal to the non-necessary possible\nthing (which Avicenna takes to be contrary to the nature of a (mere)\npossible being) or it doesn\u2019t have a cause at all.\nAvicenna\u2019s reasoning implicitly rejects this latter alternative\nand thus he appears to be committed that all existence and\nnonexistence has a cause (Avicenna, Metaphysics 1.6 \u00a71;\nAl-Shifa\u2019: Al-Ilahiyyat, 37; See Richardson\n747).\n\nIn the medieval Latin West, Peter Abelard argues that God must create\nthe best of all possible worlds in a way that both appears to\npresuppose some version of the PSR and anticipates Leibniz\u2019s\nreasoning on the subject. If God didn\u2019t, Abelard argues, there\nwould have to be some reason for it. But what reason could that be\nexcept God\u2019s injustice or jealousy? But God cannot be unjust or\njealous. So there is no possible reason for God making anything less\nthan the best. Everything has a reason. Thus God makes the best\npossible world (Op. cit. col. 1324b; McCallum 1948, 93).\nAbelard\u2019s opinion was rejected as heresy and mainstream opinion\nof philosophers during the Middle Ages in the Latin West appears to\nreject the PSR. God, on the mainstream medieval view, enjoys freedom\nof indifference with respect to his creation. Thus there is no\nsufficient reason for why God created what he did and the PSR slips\nfrom prominence until its early modern revival at the hands of Spinoza\nand Leibniz.\n\nSome great epistemological rationalists, such as Plato and Descartes,\nappear to endorse the unrestricted PSR but in fact do not. For\nexample, in the Timaeus Plato writes,\n\n\n[E]verything that comes to be must of necessity come to be by the\nagency of some cause, for it is impossible for anything to come to be\nwithout a cause. (28a4\u20135)\n\n\nThis passage appears to assert the unrestricted PSR. But Plato\nbelieves that there are things that are not among the things that\n\u201ccome to be,\u201d and some of these things have no cause\nor reason. For example, the Demiurge creates the world by imposing\norder on disorderly motion. The disorderly motion preexists the work\nof the Demiurge. It is uncaused and there is no reason for it.\n\nAt times, Descartes appears to endorse the unrestricted PSR. For\nexample, he argues for the existence of God in the third\nMediation on the basis of the principle that there must be at\nleast as much reality in the cause as in the effect. And he justifies\nthis causal principle by claiming that \u201cNothing comes from\nnothing\u201d. This appears to make him as much an adherent of the\nunrestricted PSR as Parmenides who, as we have seen, argues for his\nconclusions on the same basis. But elsewhere Descartes claims that God\ncreates the eternal truths, such as mathematical and metaphysical\ntruths (Letters to Mersenne, April 15, May 6, and 27, 1630; Fifth\nReplies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261). Moreover, he claims that God\ncreates these truths by an act of will which is free and indifferent.\nThus there can be no reason for the creation any of these truths. If\nmathematical and metaphysical truths are contingent and yet have no\nsufficient reason according to Descartes, then his philosophy imposes\nserious restrictions on any PSR.\n6. The PSR in Eighteenth-Century Philosophy and German Idealism\n\nHume\u2019s critique of causation presents an important challenge to\nthe PSR. In his Treatise of Human Nature (I, 3, 3) Hume\nconsiders several arguments which attempt to prove the \u201cgeneral\nmaxim in philosophy, that whatever begins to exist, must have a\ncause\u201d and finds all of them wanting. Hume argues that\nsince the ideas of cause and its effect are evidently distinct, we can\nclearly conceive or imagine an object without its cause. He takes the\nseparability of the two ideas to show that there is no necessary\nconceptual relation between the ideas of cause and effect insofar as\nconceiving the one without the other does not imply any contradiction\nor absurdity.\n\nChristian Wolff (1679\u20131754), the most influential German\nphilosopher of the first half of the eighteenth century, was a\nfollower of Leibniz and developed the latter\u2019s system. Like\nLeibniz, Wolff assigned to the PSR a central role in his system while\nattempting to avoid necessitarianism (or \u201cfatalism\u201d). Like\nSpinoza and Leibniz, Wolff demanded a reason for both the possibility\nof things [ratio essendi] (i.e., coherence of essence) and\nfor the actualization, or coming to be, of essences [ratio\nfiendi]. Wolff mildly criticized Leibniz for allegedly grounding\nthe PSR merely in experience and attempted to marshal several proofs\nfor the principle (Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the\nSoul of Human Beings, \u00a7\u00a730\u201331, 143;\nOntologia, \u00a7\u00a756\u201378; cf. Look 2001,\n210\u2013214). One of these proofs attempts to prove the PSR relying\non the principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (Rational\nThoughts on God, the World, and the Soul of Human Beings\n\u00a731), while the most famous proof attempts to derive the PSR from\nthe Law of Non-Contradiction. According to the latter, if a thing\n\\(A\\) is assumed to exist without reason, than \u201cnothing is\nposited that explains why \\(A\\) exists\u201d. This, according to\nWolff, would mean that \\(A\\) exists because of nothing\n(Ontologia, \u00a770), which Wolff claims to be absurd.\n(Wolff seems to be assuming here the ex nihilo nihi fit\nmaxim.) Kant criticized the proof claiming that it is based on an\nequivocal use of the term \u201cnothing\u201d (AK 1:398).\n\nLeonhard Euler, the great Swiss mathematician and a contemporary of\nWolff, warned against the \u201cwretched abuse\u201d of the PSR by\nthose who\n\n\nemploy it so dexterously that by means of it they are in a condition\nto demonstrate whatever suits their purpose, and to demolish whatever\nis raised against them. (Letters to German Princess, Letter\nXIII)\n\n\nAccording to Euler, many of the proofs which rely on the PSR amount to\nnothing over and above a petitio principii, while others\nderive carelessly the impossibility of things from our ignorance of\nthe causes of these things.\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), Kant claims to\nprovide a proof for the PSR by showing that\n\n\n[T]he PSR is the ground of possible experience, namely the objective\ncognition of appearances with regards to their relation in the\nsuccessive series of time. (B/246/A201)\n\n\nRelying on his transcendental method Kant argues in the \u201cSecond\nAnalogy of Experience\u201d that a certain version of the PSR is a\ncondition for the possibility of experience, and as a result also a\ncondition for the possibility of objects of experience. Yet, this\nargument also restricts the validity of the PSR to human experience,\ni.e., to things which appear in space and time. Any use of the PSR\nthat transgresses the boundaries of human experience is bound to\ngenerate antinomies.\n\nKant\u2019s view of space and time as exhibiting brute\ndifference (i.e., the non-identity of locations in space and time\ncannot be reduced to conceptual explanation) stands in sharp contrast\nto the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, and thereby also\nto the PSR. Salomon Maimon, Kant\u2019s rationalist critic, attempted\nto enforce rationalist strictures on Kant\u2019s philosophy by\narguing that Kant is unable to explain the necessary agreement of\nintuitions and concepts. According to Kant, intuitions and concepts\ncome from entirely different sources: sensibility and understanding.\nBut if this were the case, claims Maimon, we could not explain the\nconstant agreement between intuitions and concepts, which is necessary\nfor the possibility of experience. This agreement can be explained if\nwe reject the radical heterogeneity of intuitions and concepts, and\nview intuitions as disguised concepts. Thus, any difference exhibited\nin space and time must have its ground in the universal forms of our\nthought in general (Maimon, Essay on Transcendental\nPhilosophy, Ch. 1, p. 13). Maimon also argued that we must seek\nan explanation for the fact that we have two forms of\nintuition rather than one, and suggested that it is only the interplay\nbetween the two forms of intuition which allows us to exhibit\ndifference, by using a unity in one form to exhibit difference in the\nother form, i.e., conceive different times by concentrating on the\nchange occurring at the same location in space, or conceive different\nlocations in space at the same point in time (Essay, Ch. 1,\n 13\u201314).\n\nMaimon was probably the strictest adherer to an unrestricted version\nof the PSR among the German Idealists. For Maimon, satisfying the\ndemands of the PSR is the infinite task of both philosophy\nand science. Thus, in response to Maimonides\u2019 claim that crucial\nastronomical facts are poorly explained by science, Maimon writes:\n\n\nThe world may be, in terms of time, finite or infinite; still,\neverything in it (as consequences of the highest wisdom) must be\nexplainable through the principle of sufficient reason. How far\nwe can actually get in achieving this is beside the point. Those\nthings that Maimonides, working with the astronomy of his day,\nregarded as inexplicable, new discoveries (particularly Newton\u2019s\nsystem) equip us to explain quite well. The highest order in the\narrangement of the world\u2019s structure is for us a necessary idea\nof reason, which, through the use of reason with regard to objects of\nexperience, we can approach but never reach. (Maimon, 1792/3\n[2019, 170]; italics added).\n\n\nGround [Grund] and the Principle of Sufficient Ground\n[der Satz vom zureichenden Grund] play a significant role in\nHegel\u2019s Logic. For Hegel, the demand for ground provides a major\nsource of transition from one thing to another. It is, Hegel says,\n\u201cthe expulsion of itself from itself\u201d (Encyclopedia\nLogic, \u00a7121A). Ground, for Hegel, is the unity of identity\nand difference: the ground of \\(x\\) has to explain all features\nof \\(x\\), and in sense duplicates it, yet it must also be\ndifferent from \\(x\\) in order to have explanatory value and not\nbe a mere petitio principii.\n\nThe PSR is the subject of Schopenhauer\u2019s 1813 doctoral\ndissertation: The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. In this work, Schopenhauer provides a brief history of\nthe PSR, and then raises the questions of the justification for the\nPSR and the proper scope of the principle. Schopenhauer follows Wolff\nin distinguishing among four kinds of reasons, corresponding to four\nkinds of objects, and charges that much philosophical confusion arises\nfrom attempts to explain objects of one kind by reasoning that belongs\nto the other kind. These four kinds of explanation, or four variants\nof the PSR, share the very same ground. Along Kantian lines\nSchopenhauer suggests that it is the subject\u2019s activity in\nregularly connecting representations that is the ground of the PSR\n(The Fourfold Root, \u00a716).\n7. The PSR in Contemporary Philosophy\n\nIt has recently been proposed by Dasgupta that a version of the PSR\ncould be formulated in terms of grounds. Grounding is said to be a\nkind of explanation distinct from causal explanation. It is a\nmetaphysical or constitutive explanation. It is generally taken to be\nasymmetric, irreflexive, and transitive. Alleged examples of grounding\nrelations are: dispositions (e.g., fragility) are grounded in\ncategorical features (e.g., molecular structure); semantic facts\n(e.g., Jones means addition by \u201c+\u201d) are grounded\nby non-semantic facts (e.g., Jones is disposed to draw certain\ninferences); mental properties (e.g., pain) are grounded by physical\nproperties (e.g., c-fibers firing; see Rosen 2010 and Fine 2012). The\nproposal is formulated as follows:\n\n\nPSR: For every substantive fact \\(Y\\) there are some facts, the\n\\(X\\)s, such that (i) the \\(X\\)s ground \\(Y\\) and (ii)\neach one of the \\(X\\)s is autonomous. (Dasgupta 2016: 12)\n\n\nHere substantive means apt for grounding and\nautonomous means not apt for grounding. For example, perhaps\nessentialist facts are autonomous where essentialist facts are facts\nof the form: it is essential to \\(x\\) that \\(\\phi\\). The\nidea is that just as definitions are not apt for proof, essentialist\nfacts are not apt for grounding explanations, that is, they are\nautonomous (Dasgupta 2016: 6\u20139). The notion of an autonomous\nfact allows the adherent of this version of the PSR to avoid the\nAgrippan Trilemma without allowing for self-explanatory facts or\ninfinite regresses. Chains of explanation terminate with autonomous\nfacts, which are not brute because they are not apt for\nexplanation.\n\nFollowing Bolzano (Theory of Science: vol. II,\n259\u2013264), most contemporary theories of grounding affirm the\nirreflexivity of this relation (see Fine 2001: 15; Schaffer 2009: 364;\nand Rosen 2010: 115). More recently, Fine showed that given certain\nplausible premises, one may point out counterexamples to irreflexivity\n(Fine 2010; cf. Kr\u00e4mer 2013), and the issue has been further\nchallenged by Jenkins (2011).\n\nJonathan Schaffer has relied on the notion of ground to revive an\nAristotelian, structured metaphysics, i.e., a metaphysics which is\nordered by priority relations (Schaffer 2009), and to defend Priority\nMonism (see the entry on\n monism).\n In response, Michael Della Rocca (2014) has argued that strict\nadherence to the PSR\u2014and to Ockham\u2019s Razor (see the entry\non\n simplicity)\u2014undermines\n Schaffer\u2019s structured metaphysics (and Priority Monism), since\ninsofar as all the features of the grounded are already present in the\nground, the existence of the grounded is just redundant. (See also the\nentry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n More recently, in his audacious 2020 book, Della Rocca expanded his\nargument. Relying on what he takes to be a strict adherence to the\nPSR, and assisted by F.H. Bradley\u2019s critique of the reality of\nrelation, Della Rocca argues that we are entitled to assert only the\nexistence of undifferentiated being that stands in no relations of\ndistinction. According to Della Rocca, our major philosophical\nconcepts \u2013 substance, action, knowledge, meaning, and\nexplanation \u2013 fail to meet the strict requirements of the PSR.\nToward the end of the book, Della Rocca launches a powerful attack on\nthe widespread reliance on intuitions among analytic philosophers\n(Della Rocca, 2020, 260\u2013290).\n\nThe question of the justification for the employment of the PSR has\nbeen addressed in some recent literature (see, for example, Della\nRocca (2010)). Fatema Amijee has argued that from a practical point of\nview, participants in structural inquiry (i.e., an inquiry which\nattempts to explain why a given fact obtains) must assume the PSR as\nlong as they do not discover that any fact is brute. Since structural\ninquiry is intrinsically valuable (and assists us in discovering new\ntruths), it is rationally non-optional for us, and consequently, we\nmust be committed to the PSR (Amijee 2022).\n\nImplications for the PSR might also be discerned in recent discussions\nof surprisingness or strikingness, (although such\nimplications are not typically stated explicitly). These discussions,\nwhich cut across such diverse subfields as epistemology, philosophy of\nscience, metaethics, and philosophy of religion, have their origin in\nPaul Horwich\u2019s observation that there is an intuitive difference\nbetween an event or fact being unlikely and its being\nsurprising (Horwich 1982). For example, it is equally\nunlikely that, on a given occasion, a monkey typing randomly on a\ntypewriter will type the string \u2018sdlek93 91\u2019 and that it\nwill type \u2018I want a banana.\u2019 But although the\nprobabilities of both events are the same, the latter string is\nsurprising in a way that the former is not. The difference between\nsurprising events or facts and unlikely fact is sometimes thought to\nmap onto the distinction between events or facts that call out for\nexplanation and those that do not. How can we account for the\ndifference between the merely improbable\u2014which some believe does\nnot call out for explanation\u2014and the surprising\u2014which\ndoes? Often it is said that the surprising requires us to challenge\nour background beliefs and confirms hypotheses that are alternatives\nto those beliefs. Alternatively, that a theory T treats something\nsurprising as inexplicable is a reason to disbelieve T (White 2007;\nSchechter 2013). Thus, such inquiry is guided by the presumption that\nthe surprising is explicable. Principles such as these have led\nphilosophers to substantive conclusions as diverse as: (1) the\nuniverse was designed by an intelligent agent (White 2017; van Inwagen\n1993); (2) moral realism is false (Street 2006; Enoch 2011); (3) there\nexists a multiverse (Leslie 1989; Parfit 1998); and Platonism about\nmathematics is false (Field 1989, 2005). Unfortunately, we cannot\ndiscuss the details of the arguments from the improbable/surprising\ndistinction to these claims here. Nevertheless, this methodological\nassumption has interesting repercussions for the PSR. First of all,\nthose who advocate the distinction tend to suggest that, if the PSR is\ntrue, then it is so only in a restricted form. After all, the point of\nthe distinction is that some things call out for explanation and\nothers do not. But it also suggests that something like a restricted\nPSR is true. A principle that says that we have an epistemic\nreason to believe a hypothesis that would transform a surprising event\nof fact into an unsurprising one would only be truth conducive if we\nlived in a world in which events and facts are\u2014at least for the\nmost part\u2014explicable. Why this is so can be illuminated by\nanalogy with induction. As Hume observed, induction is truth conducive\nonly if nature is uniform (T. 1.3.6.4). So, by committing ourselves to\nthe method of induction, we thereby presuppose the truth of the\nprinciple of the uniformity of nature. Similarly, by taking\nourselves to have an epistemic reason to believe a theory because it\nrenders explicable what is otherwise surprising, we thereby presuppose\nthe truth of a restricted PSR. \n\nThe role of the PSR in ethics and political theory has not been\nseriously studied so far. Clearly, the PSR may be marshaled in order\nto question our reliance on mere intuitions. The repugnance of a\ncertain view cannot be taken at face value, but rather requires a\njustification. In the past, various conservative views relied merely\non the alleged repugnance of certain sexual acts (e.g., homosexuality,\ninterracial relations). The requirement to dig deeper and ask a person\nto justify her intuitions may help the person understand the maxims\nguiding her specific moral beliefs. Adherence to the PSR may also\nshift the onus of proof in the debate between those who consider our\npreferential evaluation of human beings over other things in nature as\nsimply brute (Williams 2006: 195) and those who insist that if human\nbeings have a special value, there must be a reason for the ascription\nof such value (Buss 2012: 343).\n",
