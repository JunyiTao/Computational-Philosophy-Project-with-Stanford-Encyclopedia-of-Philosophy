    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Essence and Existence, Universals and Individuals\n6.3 Essence and Existence, Universals and Individuals\n\nAmong the most influential philosophical doctrines of Arabic origin is\nthe distinction between essence (m\u0101hiyya,\nessentia) and existence (wuj\u016bd, ens),\nwhich the Latin West got to know from Avicenna\u2019s\nMetaphysics, chapters I.5 and V.1\u20132. The distinction\nwas very influential historically: it found adherents among\nphilosophers and theologians of the Arabic, Hebrew and Latin\ncultures. The essence-existence distinction was used by Avicenna in\nseveral metaphysical contexts, i.e., in the discussion of primary\nconcepts, of universals and of the first cause. The following\npresentation focuses on the context of universals. Avicenna\u2019s\ncore idea was to differentiate between two components of universals:\nessence and universality. The essence of \u201chorseness\u201d, to\nuse Avicenna\u2019s example (Metaphysics V.1), is in itself\nneither universal nor particular. Only existence, which in itself is\ndistinct from essence, adds universality or particularity, depending\nupon whether \u201chorseness\u201d exists in the mind, that is, as a\nuniversal, or in the exernal world, that is, as a particular. In some\nof his writings, Avicenna emphasizes that there is universality only\nif the essence is found in several objects in the external world\n(Marmura 1979, 49).\n\nThomas Aquinas adopts Avicenna\u2019s distinction already in his\nearly On Being and Essence (De ente et essentia IV).\nEssence can be considered either in itself or with respect to its\nexistence in the soul or in the particular things. Universality and\nparticularity are accidents of essence, which in itself is neither\nuniversal nor particular. Thomas Aquins adopts the expression\n\u201caccidents of essence\u201d from Averroes (Comm. magnum\nMetaph. IV.3). The universal, according to Thomas, is a\nnatura communis, which has existence only in the intellect.\nIndividuals are essences individuated by matter with quantitative\ndimensions, but only at the time of their origin; later individuation\nis due to the form. In later writings, Thomas develops his concept of\nessence and existence so that existence is that which actualizes\nessence (Summa theol. Ia q. 3 a. 4) (Wippel 1990; Black\n1999).\n\nAn influential defender of the real distinction between essence and\nexistence was Giles of Rome. Since he uses the terminology of\n\u201cthing\u201d (res) for both concepts, he was\ncriticized for turning \u201cexistence\u201d into a thing, which\nitself exists only if another thing \u201cexistence\u201d is added,\nand so on ad infinitum. This argument was voiced against the real\ndistinction by Siger of Brabant and Godfrey of Fontaines (Wippel\n1982), but it originally comes from Averroes, who flatly rejects\nAvicenna\u2019s distinction in his Long Commentary on the\nMetaphysics (IV.3).\n\nWhile some authors take the extreme position that there is only a\nmental distinction between essence and existence, Henry of Ghent\ndevelops a modified version of Avicenna\u2019s theory. He\ndistinguishes between essence in itself and as existing, that is,\nexisting in the mind or in the external world. But he attributes a\nspecific kind of existence to the essence in itself\n(Quodlibet I, 9 and III, 9): esse essentiae\n(\u201cessential being\u201d), which is the essence\u2019s eternal\nrelation to God as its cause. The esse existentiae, in\ncontrast, is the essence\u2019s actual existence. Henry thus develops\na theory of how essences exist prior to their actual existence in the\nmind or in the world, enlarging on a brief and tentative reference in\nAvicenna\u2019s Metaphysics I.5 to the \u201cproper\nexistence\u201d (esse proprium) of the essences.\n\nDuns Scotus is also inspired by the Avicennian idea that the common\nnature (natura communis), as Scotus calls it, is neither\ntruly universal nor truly particular in itself and that it is\nuniversal only as an object of the intellect. But Scotus\u2019\naccount of individuation differs: The common nature is particular only\nbecause of a second \u201creality\u201d in the object, a principle\nof individuation or contracting difference, which by later authors was\ncalled haecceitas (\u201cthisness\u201d). The distinction\nbetween the two \u201crealities\u201d nature and thisness is not\nreal, but formal in the sense that the two are different, but never\nexist apart from each other (Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, q.\n6).\n\nThe influence of Arabic metaphysics is much more extensive than these\nbrief references to a few well-known thinkers suggest. The influence\nof Avicenna and Averroes, especially on the subject of metaphysics and\non essence and existence, extends to many authors and over many\ncenturies, up to sixteenth-century Jesuit authors such as Benedictus\nPereira, Pedro da Fonseca and Francisco Su\u00e1rez (Leinsle 1985,\nch. 2)\n",
