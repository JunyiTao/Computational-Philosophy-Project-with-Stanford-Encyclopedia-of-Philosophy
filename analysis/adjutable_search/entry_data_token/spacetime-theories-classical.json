Introduction\n\nThings change. This is a platitude but still a crucial feature of the\nworld, and one which causes many philosophical perplexities \u2013\nsee for instance the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes.\n For Aristotle, motion (he would have called it\n\u2018locomotion\u2019) was just one kind of change, like\ngeneration, growth, decay, fabrication and so on. The atomists held on\nthe contrary that all change was in reality the motion of atoms into\nnew configurations, an idea that was not to begin to realize its full\npotential until the Seventeenth Century, particularly in the work of\nDescartes. (Of course, modern physics seems to show that the physical\nstate of a system goes well beyond the geometrical configuration of\nbodies. Fields, while perhaps determined by the states of bodies, are\nnot themselves configurations of bodies if interpreted literally, and\nin quantum mechanics bodies have \u2018internal states\u2019 such as\nparticle spin.)\n\nNot all changes seem to be merely the (loco)motions of bodies in\nphysical space. Yet since antiquity, in the western tradition, this\nkind of motion has been absolutely central to the understanding of\nchange. And since motion is a crucial concept in physical theories,\none is forced to address the question of what exactly it is. The\nquestion might seem trivial, for surely what is usually meant by\nsaying that something is moving is that it is moving relative\nto something, often tacitly understood between speakers. For instance:\nthe car is moving at 60mph (relative to the road and things along it),\nthe plane is flying (relative) to London, the rocket is lifting off\n(the ground), or the passenger is moving (to the front of the speeding\ntrain). Typically the relative reference body is either the\nsurroundings of the speakers, or the Earth, but this is not always the\ncase. For instance, it seems to make sense to ask whether the Earth\nrotates about its axis West-East diurnally or whether it is instead\nthe heavens that rotate East-West; but if all motions are to be\nreckoned relative to the Earth, then its rotation seems\nimpossible.\n\nBut if the Earth does not offer a unique frame of reference for the\ndescription of motion, then we may wonder whether any arbitrary object\ncan be used for the definition of motions: are all such motions on a\npar, none privileged over any other? It is unclear whether anyone has\nreally consistently espoused this view: Aristotle, perhaps, in the\nMetaphysics. Descartes and Leibniz are often thought to have\ndone so; however, as we\u2019ll see, those claims are suspect.\nPossibly Huygens, though the most recent and thorough reconstruction\nof his position (Stan 2016) indicates not. Mach at some moments\nperhaps. If this view were correct, then the question of whether the\nEarth or heavens rotate would be ill-formed, those alternatives being\nmerely different but equivalent expressions of the facts.\n\nHowever, suppose that, like Aristotle, you take ordinary language\naccurately to reflect the structure of the world. Then you could\nrecognize systematic everyday uses of \u2018up\u2019 and\n\u2018down\u2019 that require some privileged standards \u2013 uses\nthat treat things closer to a point at the center of the Earth as more\n\u2018down\u2019 and motions towards that point as\n\u2018downwards\u2019. Of course we would likely explain this usage\nin terms of the fact that we and our language evolved in a very\nnoticeable gravitational field directed towards the center of the\nEarth; but for Aristotle, as we shall see, this usage helped identify\nan important structural feature of the universe, which itself was\nrequired for the explanation of weight. Now a further question arises:\nhow should a structure, such as a preferred point in the universe,\nwhich privileges certain motions, be understood? What makes that point\nprivileged? One might expect that Aristotle simply identified it with\nthe center of the Earth, and so relative to that particular body;\nhowever, we shall soon see that he did not adopt that tacit convention\nas fundamental. So the question arises of whether the preferred point\nis somewhere picked out in some other way by the bodies in the\nuniverse \u2013 the center of the heavens perhaps? Or is it picked\nout quite independently of the arrangements of matter?\n\nThe issues that arise in this simple theory help to frame the debates\nbetween later physicists and philosophers concerning the nature of\nmotion; in this article, we will focus on the theories of Descartes,\nLeibniz, and Newton. In the companion entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: post-Newtonian theories,\n we study the approaches followed by Mach, Einstein, and certain\ncontemporary researchers. We will see that similar concerns pervade\nall these works: is there any kind of privileged sense of motion: a\nsense in which things can be said to move or not, not just relative to\nthis or that reference body, but \u2018truly\u2019? If so, can this\ntrue motion be analyzed in terms of motions relative to other bodies\n\u2013 to some special body, or to the entire universe perhaps? (And\nin relativity, in which distances, times and measures of relative\nmotion are frame-dependent, what relations are relevant?) If not, then\nhow is the privileged kind of motion to be understood, as relative to\nspace itself \u2013 something physical but non-material \u2013\nperhaps? Or can some kinds of motion be best understood as not being\nspatial changes \u2013 changes of relative location or of place\n\u2013 at all?\n2. Aristotle\n\nTo see that the problem of the interpretation of spatiotemporal\nquantities as absolute or relative is endemic to almost any kind of\nmechanics one can imagine, we can look to one of the simplest theories\n\u2013 Aristotle\u2019s account of natural motion (e.g., On the\nHeavens I.2). According to this theory it is because of their\nnatures, and not because of \u2018unnatural\u2019 forces, that that\nheavy bodies move down, and \u2018light\u2019 things (air and fire)\nmove up; it is their natures, or \u2018forms\u2019, that constitute\nthe gravity or weight of the former and the levity of the latter. This\naccount only makes sense if \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019\ncan be unequivocally determined for each body. According to Aristotle,\nup and down are fixed by the position of the body in question relative\nto the center of the universe, a point coincident with the center of\nthe Earth. That is, the theory holds that heavy bodies naturally move\ntowards the center, while light bodies naturally move away.\n\nDoes this theory involve absolute or merely relative quantities? It\ndepends on the nature of the center. If the center were identified\nwith the center of the Earth, then the theory could be taken to eschew\nabsolute quantities: it would simply hold that the natural motions of\nany body depend on its position relative to another, namely the Earth.\nBut Aristotle is explicit that the center of the universe is not\nidentical with, but merely coincident with the center of the Earth\n(e.g., On the Heavens II.14): since the Earth itself is\nheavy, if it were not at the center it would move there! So the center\nis not identified with any body, and so perhaps direction-to-center is\nan absolute quantity in the theory, not understood fundamentally as\ndirection to some body (merely contingently as such if some body\nhappens to occupy the center). But this conclusion is not clear\neither. In On the Heavens II.13, admittedly in response to a\ndifferent issue, Aristotle suggests that the center itself is\n\u2018determined\u2019 by the outer spherical shell of the universe\n(the aetherial region of the fixed stars). If this is what he intends,\nthen the natural law prescribes motion relative to another body after\nall \u2013 namely up or down with respect to the mathematical center\nof the stars.\n\nIt would be to push Aristotle\u2019s writings too hard to suggest\nthat he was consciously wrestling with the issue of whether mechanics\nrequired absolute or relative quantities of motion, but what is clear\nis that these questions arise in his physics and his remarks impinge\non them. His theory also gives a simple model of how they arise: a\nphysical theory of motion will say that \u2018under such-and-such\ncircumstances, motion of so-and-so a kind will occur\u2019 \u2013\nand the question of whether that kind of motion makes sense in terms\nof the relations between bodies alone arises automatically. Aristotle\nmay not have recognized the question explicitly, but we see it as one\nissue in the background of his discussion of the center of the\nuniverse.\n3. Descartes\n\nThe issues are, however, far more explicit in the entry on\n Descartes\u2019 physics;\n and since the form of his theory is different, the \u2018kinds of\nmotion\u2019 in question are quite different \u2013 as they change\nwith all the different theories that we discuss. For Descartes argued\nin his 1644 Principles of Philosophy (see Book II) that the\nessence of matter is extension (i.e., size and shape), because any\nother attribute of bodies could be imagined away without imagining\naway matter itself. But he also held that extension constitutes the\nnature of space, and hence he concluded that space and matter are one\nand the same thing. An immediate consequence of the identification is\nthe impossibility of the vacuum; if every region of space is a region\nof matter, then there can be no space without matter. Thus\nDescartes\u2019 universe is \u2018hydrodynamical\u2019 \u2013\ncompletely full of mobile matter of different sized pieces in motion,\nrather like a bucket full of water and lumps of ice of different\nsizes, which has been stirred around. Since fundamentally the pieces\nof matter are nothing but extension, the universe is in fact nothing\nbut a system of geometric bodies in motion without any\n gaps.[1]\n3.1 The Nature of Motion\n\nThe identification of space and matter poses a puzzle about motion: if\nthe space that a body occupies literally is the matter of the body,\nthen when the body \u2013 i.e., the matter \u2013 moves, so does the\nspace that it occupies. Thus it doesn\u2019t change place, which is\nto say that it doesn\u2019t move after all! Descartes resolved this\ndifficulty by taking all motion to be the motion of bodies relative to\none another, not a literal change of space.\n\nNow, a body has as many relative motions as there are bodies, but it\ndoes not follow that all are equally significant. Indeed, Descartes\nuses several different concepts of relational motion. First there is\n\u2018change of place\u2019, which is nothing but motion relative to\nthis or that arbitrary reference body (II.13). In this sense no motion\nof a body is privileged, since the speed, direction, and even curve of\na trajectory depends on the reference body, and none is singled out.\nNext, he discusses motion in \u2018the ordinary sense\u2019 (II.24).\nThis is often conflated with mere change of arbitrary place, but\nstrictly it differs because according to the rules of ordinary speech\none correctly attributes motion only to bodies whose motion is caused\nby some action, not to arbitrary relative motion. (For\ninstance, a person sitting on a speeding boat is ordinarily said to be\nat rest, since \u2018he feels no action in himself\u2019.) This\ndistinction is important in some passages, but arguably not in those\nthat we discuss. Finally, he defined motion \u2018properly\nspeaking\u2019 (II.25) to be \u2018the transference of one part of\nmatter or of one body, from the vicinity of those bodies immediately\ncontiguous to it and considered as at rest, into the vicinity of\n[some]\n others.\u2019[2]\n Since a body can only be touching one set of surroundings, Descartes\nargued (questionably) that this standard of motion was unique.\n\nWhat we see here is that Descartes, despite holding motion to be the\nmotion of bodies relative to one another, also held there to be a\nprivileged sense of motion; in a terminology sometimes employed by\nwriters of the period (see Rynasiewicz 2019, \u00a73), he held there\nto be a sense of \u2018true motion\u2019, over and above the merely\nrelative motions. In logical terms we can make the point this way:\nwhile moves-relative-to is a two-place predicate,\nmoves-properly-speaking is a one-place predicate. (And this,\neven though it is defined in terms of relative motion: let\ncontiguous-surroundings be a function from bodies to their\ncontiguous surroundings, then x\nmoves-properly-speaking is defined as x\nmoves-relative-to-contiguous-surroundings(x).)\n\nThis example illustrates why it is crucial to keep two questions\ndistinct: on the one hand, is motion to be understood in terms of\nrelations between bodies or by invoking something additional,\nsomething absolute; on the other hand, are all relative motions\nequally significant, or is there some \u2018true\u2019, privileged\nnotion of motion? Descartes\u2019 views show that eschewing absolute\nmotion is logically compatible with accepting true motion; which is of\ncourse not to say that his definitions of motion are themselves\ntenable.\n3.2 Motion and Dynamics\n\nThere is an interpretational tradition which holds that Descartes only\ntook the first, \u2018ordinary\u2019 sense of motion seriously, and\nintroduced the second notion to avoid conflict with the Catholic\nChurch. Such conflict was a real concern, since the censure of\nGalileo\u2019s Copernicanism took place only 11 years before\npublication of the Principles, and had in fact dissuaded\nDescartes from publishing an earlier work, The World. Indeed,\nin the Principles (III.28) he is at pains to explain how\n\u2018properly speaking\u2019 the Earth does not move, because it is\nswept around the Sun in a giant vortex of matter \u2013 the Earth\ndoes not move relative to its surroundings in the vortex.\n\nThe difficulty with the reading, aside from the imputation of\ncowardice to the old soldier, is that it makes nonsense of\nDescartes\u2019 mechanics, a theory of collisions. For instance,\naccording to his laws of collision if two equal bodies strike each\nother at equal and opposite velocities then they will bounce off at\nequal and opposite velocities (Rule I). On the other hand, if the very\nsame bodies approach each other with the very same relative\nspeed, but at different speeds then they will move off together in the\ndirection of the faster one (Rule III). But if the operative meaning\nof motion in the Rules is the ordinary sense, then these two\nsituations are just the same situation, differing only in the choice\nof reference frame, and so could not have different outcomes \u2013\nbouncing apart versus moving off together. It seems\ninconceivable that Descartes could have been confused in such a\ntrivial\n way.[3]\n\nThus Garber (1992, Chapter 6\u20138) proposes that Descartes actually\ntook the unequivocal notion of motion properly speaking to be the\ncorrect sense of motion in mechanics. Then Rule I covers the case in\nwhich the two bodies have equal and opposite motions relative to\ntheir contiguous surroundings, while Rule VI covers the case in\nwhich the bodies have different motions relative to those\nsurroundings \u2013 one is perhaps at rest in its surroundings.\nThat is, exactly what is needed to make the rules consistent is the\nkind of privileged, true, sense of motion provided by Descartes\u2019\nsecond definition. Insurmountable problems with the rules remain, but\nrejecting the traditional interpretation and taking motion properly\nspeaking seriously in Descartes\u2019 philosophy clearly gives a more\ncharitable reading.\n4. Newton\n\nNewton articulated a clearer, more coherent, and more physically\nplausible account of motion that any that had come before. Still, as\nwe will see, there have been a number of widely held misunderstandings\nof Newton\u2019s views, and it is not completely clear how best to\nunderstand the absolute space that he postulated.\n4.1 Newton Against the Cartesian Account of Motion \u2013 The Bucket\n\nIn an unpublished essay \u2013 De Gravitatione (Newton,\n2004) \u2013 and in a Scholium to the definitions given in\nhis 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\nNewton attacked both of Descartes\u2019 notions of motion as\ncandidates for the operative notion in mechanics. (Newton\u2019s\ncritique is studied in more detail in the entry\n Newton\u2019s views on space, time, and motion.)[4]\n\nThe most famous argument invokes the so-called \u2018Newton\u2019s\nbucket\u2019 experiment. Stripped to its basic elements one\ncompares:\n\na bucket of water hanging from a cord as the bucket is set\nspinning about the cord\u2019s axis, with\nthe same bucket and water when they are rotating at the same rate\nabout the cord\u2019s axis.\n\n\nAs is familiar from any rotating system, there will be a tendency for\nthe water to recede from the axis of rotation in the latter case: in\n(i) the surface of the water will be flat (because of the\nEarth\u2019s gravitational field) while in (ii) it will be concave.\nThe analysis of such \u2018inertial effects\u2019 due to rotation\nwas a major topic of enquiry of \u2018natural philosophers\u2019 of\nthe time, including Descartes and his followers, and they would\ncertainly have agreed with Newton that the concave surface of the\nwater in the second case demonstrated that the water was moving in a\nmechanically significant sense. There is thus an immediate problem for\nthe claim that proper motion is the correct mechanical sense of\nmotion: in (i) and (ii) proper motion is anti-correlated with\nthe mechanically significant motion revealed by the surface of the\nwater. That is, the water is flat in (i) when it is in motion relative\nto its immediate surroundings \u2013 the inner sides of the bucket\n\u2013 but curved in (ii) when it is at rest relative to its\nimmediate surroundings. Thus the mechanically relevant meaning of\nrotation is not that of proper motion. (You may have noticed a small\nlacuna in Newton\u2019s argument: in (i) the water is at rest and in\n(ii) in motion relative to that part of its surroundings constituted\nby the air above it. It\u2019s not hard to imagine small\nmodifications to the example to fill this gap.)\n\nNewton also points out that the height that the water climbs up the\ninside of the bucket provides a measure of the rate of rotation of\nbucket and water: the higher the water rises up the sides, the greater\nthe tendency to recede must be, and so the faster the water must be\nrotating in the mechanically significant sense. But suppose, very\nplausibly, that the measure is unique, that any particular height\nindicates a particular rate of rotation. Then the unique height that\nthe water reaches at any moment implies a unique rate of rotation in a\nmechanically significant sense. And thus motion in the sense of motion\nrelative to an arbitrary reference body is not the mechanical sense,\nsince that kind of rotation is not unique at all, but depends on the\nmotion of the reference body. And so Descartes\u2019 change of place\n(and for similar reasons, motion in the ordinary sense) is not the\nmechanically significant sense of motion.\n4.2 Absolute Space and Motion\n\nIn our discussion of Descartes we called the sense of motion operative\nin the science of mechanics \u2018true motion\u2019, and the phrase\nis used in this way by Newton in the Scholium. Thus\nNewton\u2019s bucket shows that true (rotational) motion is\nanti-correlated with, and so not identical with, proper motion (as\nDescartes proposed according to the Garber reading); and Newton\nfurther argues that the rate of true (rotational) motion is unique,\nand so not identical with change of place, which is multiple. Newton\nproposed instead that true motion is motion relative to a temporally\nenduring, rigid, 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which he dubbed\n\u2018absolute space\u2019. Of course, Descartes also defined motion\nas relative to an enduring 3-dimensional Euclidean space; the\ndifference is that Descartes\u2019 space was divided into parts (his\nspace was identical with a plenum of corpuscles) in motion, not a\nrigid structure in which (mobile) material bodies are\nembedded. So according to Newton, the rate of true rotation of the\nbucket (and water) is the rate at which it rotates relative to\nabsolute space. Or put another way, Newton effectively defines the\n1-place predicate x moves-absolutely as x\nmoves-relative-to absolute space; both Newton and Descartes offer\ncompeting 1-place predicates as analyses of x\nmoves-truly.\n4.2.1 Absolute Space vs. Galilean Relativity\n\nNewton\u2019s proposal for understanding motion solves the problems\nthat he posed for Descartes, and provides an interpretation of the\nconcepts of constant motion and acceleration that appear in his laws\nof motion. However, it suffers from two notable interpretational\nproblems, both of which were pressed forcefully by Leibniz (in the\nLeibniz-Clarke Correspondence, 1715\u20131716) \u2013 which is not\nto say that Leibniz himself offered a superior account of motion (see\n below).[5]\n First, according to this account, absolute velocity is a well-defined\nquantity: more simply, the absolute speed of a body is the rate of\nchange of its position relative to an arbitrary point of absolute\nspace. But the Galilean relativity of Newton\u2019s laws (see the\nentry on\n space and time: inertial frames)\n means that the evolution of a closed system would have been identical\nif it had been moving at a different (constant) overall velocity: as\nGalileo noted in his (see the entry on\n Galileo Galilei),\n an experimenter cannot determine from observations inside his cabin\nwhether his ship is at rest in harbor or sailing smoothly. Put another\nway, according to Newtonian mechanics, in principle Newton\u2019s\nabsolute velocity cannot be experimentally determined.\n\nSo in this regard absolute velocity is quite unlike acceleration\n(including rotation). Newtonian acceleration is understood in absolute\nspace as the rate of change of absolute velocity, and is, according to\nNewtonian mechanics, generally measurable; for instance by measuring\nthe height that the water ascends the sides of the\n bucket.[6]\n Leibniz argued (rather inconsistently, as we shall see) that since\ndifferences in absolute velocity are unobservable, they are not be\ngenuine differences at all; and hence that Newton\u2019s absolute\nspace, whose existence would entail the reality of such differences,\nmust also be a fiction. Few philosophers today would immediately\nreject a quantity as unreal simply because it was not experimentally\ndeterminable, but this fact does justify genuine doubts about the\nreality of absolute velocity, and hence of absolute space.\n4.2.2 The Ontology of Absolute Space\n\nThe second problem concerns the nature of absolute space. Newton quite\nclearly distinguished his account from Descartes\u2019 \u2013 in\nparticular with regards to absolute space\u2019s rigidity versus\nDescartes\u2019 \u2018hydrodynamical\u2019 space, and the\npossibility of the vacuum in absolute space. Thus absolute space is\ndefinitely not material. On the other hand, presumably it is supposed\nto be part of the physical, not mental, realm. In De\nGravitatione, Newton rejected both the traditional philosophical\ncategories of substance and attribute as suitable characterizations.\nAbsolute space is not a substance for it lacks causal powers and does\nnot have a fully independent existence, and yet it is not an attribute\nsince it would exist even in a vacuum, which by definition is a place\nwhere there are no bodies in which it might inhere. Newton proposes\nthat space is what we might call a \u2018pseudo-substance\u2019,\nmore like a substance than property, yet not quite a\n substance.[7]\n In fact, Newton accepted the principle that everything that exists,\nexists somewhere \u2013 i.e., in absolute space. Thus he viewed\nabsolute space as a necessary consequence of the existence of\nanything, and of God\u2019s existence in particular \u2013 hence\nspace\u2019s ontological dependence. Leibniz was presumably unaware\nof the unpublished De Gravitatione in which these particular\nideas were developed, but as we shall see, his later works are\ncharacterized by a robust rejection of any notion of space as a real\nthing rather than an ideal, purely mental entity. This is a view that\nattracts even fewer contemporary adherents, but there is something\ndeeply peculiar about a non-material but physical entity, a worry that\nhas influenced many philosophical opponents of absolute\n space.[8]\n5. Newtonian Absolute Space in the Twentieth Century\n\nThis article is largely a historical survey of prominent views.\nHowever, it is hard to fully understand those debates without knowing\nsomething about scientific and mathematical developments have changed\nrecent understanding of the issues. In particular, a spacetime\napproach can clarify the situation with which the interlocutors were\nwrestling, and help clarify their arguments. This is a point widely\nrecognized in the secondary literature, and indeed colors much of what\nis said there (for good and bad, as we shall touch on later). So a\nshort digression into these matters is important for engaging the\nliterature responsibly; that said, while \u00a77 presupposes this\nsection, the reader only interested in \u00a76 could skip this\nsection.\n5.1 The Spacetime Approach\n\nAfter the development of relativity theory (a topic that we address in\nthe companion article), and its interpretation as a spacetime\ntheory, it was realized that the notion of spacetime had applicability\nto a range of theories of mechanics, classical as well as\nrelativistic. In particular, there is a spacetime geometry \u2013\n\u2018Galilean\u2019 or \u2018neo-Newtonian\u2019 spacetime (the\nterms are interchangeable) \u2013 for Newtonian mechanics that solves\nthe problem of absolute velocity; an idea exploited by a number of\nphilosophers from the late 1960s onwards (e.g., Stein 1968, Earman\n1970, Sklar 1974, and Friedman 1983). For details the reader is\nreferred to the entry on\n spacetime: inertial frames,\n but the general idea is that although a spatial distance is\nwell-defined between any two simultaneous points of this spacetime,\nonly the temporal interval is well-defined between non-simultaneous\npoints. Thus things are rather unlike Newton\u2019s absolute space,\nwhose points persist through time and maintain their distances: in\nabsolute space the distance between p-now and q-then\n(where p and q are points) is just the distance\nbetween p-now and q-now. However, Galilean spacetime\nhas an \u2018affine connection\u2019 which effectively specifies for\nevery point of every continuous curve, the rate at which the curve is\nchanging from straightness at that point; for instance, the straight\nlines are picked out as those curves whose rate of change from\nstraightness is zero at every\n point.[9]\n\nSince the trajectories of bodies are curves in spacetime, the affine\nconnection determines the rate of change from straightness at every\npoint of every possible trajectory. The straight trajectories thus\ndefined can be interpreted as the trajectories of bodies moving\ninertially (i.e., without forces), and the rate of change from\nstraightness of any trajectory can be interpreted as the acceleration\nof a body following that trajectory. That is, Newton\u2019s First Law\ncan be given a geometric formulation as \u2018bodies on which no net\nforces act follow straight lines in spacetime\u2019; similarly, the\nSecond Law can be formulated as \u2018the rate of change from\nstraightness of a body\u2019s trajectory is equal to the forces\nacting on the body divided by its mass\u2019. The significance of\nthis geometry is that while acceleration is well-defined, velocity is\nnot \u2013 in accordance with the empirical determinability of\nacceleration (generally though not universally) but not of velocity,\naccording to Newtonian mechanics. Thus Galilean spacetime gives a very\nnice interpretation of the choice that nature makes when it decides\nthat the laws of mechanics should be formulated in terms of\naccelerations not velocities. (In fact, there are complications here:\nin light of Newton\u2019s Corollary VI mentioned above, one might\nwonder whether even Galilean spacetime is the appropriate spacetime\nstructure for Newtonian mechanics. Saunders (2013), for example,\nargues that in fact only a yet more impoverished spacetime structure\n\u2013 \u2018Newton-Huygens spacetime\u2019 \u2013 is needed.)\n5.2 Substantivalism\n\nPut another way, one can define the predicate x accelerates\nas trajectory(x)\nhas-non-zero-rate-of-change-from-straightness, where\ntrajectory maps bodies onto their trajectories in Galilean\nspacetime. And this predicate, defined this way, applies to the water\nin Newton\u2019s bucket if and only if it is rotating, according to\nNewtonian mechanics formulated in terms of the geometry of Galilean\nspacetime; it is the mechanically relevant sense of\naccelerate in this theory. But this theoretical formulation\nand definition have been given in terms of the geometry of spacetime,\nnot in terms of the relations between bodies; acceleration is\n\u2018absolute\u2019 in the sense that there is a preferred (true)\nsense of acceleration in mechanics and which is not defined in terms\nof the motions of bodies relative to one another. Note that this sense\nof \u2018absolute\u2019 is broader than that of motion relative to\nabsolute space, which we defined earlier. In the remainder of this\narticle we will use it in this new broader sense. The reader should be\naware that the term is used in many ways in the literature, and such\nequivocation often leads to significant misunderstanding.\n\nIf any of this analysis of motion is taken literally then one arrives\nat a position regarding the ontology of spacetime rather like that of\nNewton\u2019s regarding space: it is some kind of\n\u2018substantial\u2019 (or maybe pseudo-substantial) thing\nwith the geometry of Galilean spacetime, just as absolute space\npossessed Euclidean geometry. This view regarding the ontology of\nspacetime is usually called \u2018substantivalism\u2019 (Sklar,\n1974). The Galilean substantivalist usually sees themselves as\nadopting a more sophisticated geometry than Newton but sharing his\nsubstantivalism (though there is plenty of room for debate on\nNewton\u2019s exact ontological views; see DiSalle, 2002, and Slowik\n2016). The advantage of the more sophisticated geometry is that\nalthough it allows the absolute sense of acceleration apparently\nrequired by Newtonian mechanics to be defined, it does not allow one\nto define a similar absolute speed or velocity \u2013 x\naccelerates can be defined as a 1-place predicate in terms of\nthe geometry of Galilean spacetime, but not x moves in\ngeneral \u2013 and so the first of Leibniz\u2019s problems is\nresolved. Of course we see that the solution depends on a crucial\nshift from speed and velocity to acceleration as the relevant senses\nof \u2018motion\u2019: from the rate of change of position to the\nrate of rate of change.\n\nWhile this proposal solves the first kind of problem posed by Leibniz,\nit seems just as vulnerable to the second. While it is true that it\ninvolves the rejection of absolute space as Newton conceived it, and\nwith it the need to explicate the nature of an enduring space, the\npostulation of Galilean spacetime poses the parallel question of the\nnature of spacetime. Again, it is a physical but non-material\nsomething, the points of which may be coincident with material bodies.\nWhat kind of thing is it? Could we do without it? As we shall see\nbelow, some contemporary philosophers believe so.\n6. Leibniz\n\nThere is a \u2018folk-reading\u2019 of Leibniz that one often finds\neither explicitly or implicitly in the philosophy of physics\nliterature which takes account of only some of his remarks on space\nand motion. For instance, the quantities captured by Earman\u2019s\n(1999) \u2018Leibnizian spacetime\u2019 do not do justice to\nLeibniz\u2019s view of motion (as Earman acknowledges). But it is\nperhaps most obvious in introductory texts (e.g., Huggett 2000).\nAccording to this view, the only quantities of motion are relative\nquantities, relative velocity, acceleration and so on, and all\nrelative motions are equal, so there is no true sense of motion.\nHowever, Leibniz is explicit that other quantities are also\n\u2018real\u2019, and his mechanics implicitly \u2013 but obviously\n\u2013 depends on yet others. The length of this section is a\nmeasure, not so much of the importance of Leibniz\u2019s actual\nviews, but the importance of showing what the prevalent folk view\nleaves out regarding Leibniz\u2019s views on the metaphysics of\nmotion and interpretation of mechanics. (For further elaboration of\nthe following points the reader is referred to the entry on\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of physics.)\n\nThat said, we shall also see that no one has yet discovered a fully\nsatisfactory way of reconciling the numerous conflicting things that\nLeibniz says about motion. Some of these tensions can be put down\nsimply to his changing his mind (see Cover and Hartz 1988 or Arthur\n2013 for explications of how Leibniz\u2019s views on space\ndeveloped). However, we will concentrate on the fairly short period in\nthe mid 1680\u201390s during which Leibniz developed his theory of\nmechanics, and was most concerned with its interpretation. We will\nsupplement this discussion with the important remarks that he made in\nhis Correspondence with\n Samuel Clarke\n around 30 years later (1715\u20131716); this discussion is broadly\nin line with the earlier period, and the intervening period is one in\nwhich he turned to other matters, rather than one in which his views\non space were evolving dramatically.\n6.1 The Ideality of Space\n\nArguably, Leibniz\u2019s views concerning space and motion do not\nhave a completely linear logic, starting from some logically\nsufficient basic premises, but instead form a collection of mutually\nsupporting doctrines. If one starts questioning why Leibniz held\ncertain views \u2013 concerning the ideality of space, for instance\n\u2013 one is apt to be led in a circle. Still, exposition requires\nstarting somewhere, and Leibniz\u2019s argument for the ideality of\nspace in the Correspondence with Clarke is a good place to\nbegin. But bear in mind the caveats made here \u2013 this argument\nwas made later than a number of other relevant writings, and its\nlogical relation to Leibniz\u2019s views on motion is complex.\n\nLeibniz (LV.47 \u2013 this notation means Leibniz\u2019s Fifth\nletter, section 47, and so on) says that (i) a body comes to have the\n\u2018same place\u2019 as another once did, when it comes to stand\nin the same relations to bodies we \u2018suppose\u2019 to be\nunchanged (more on this later); (ii) that we can define \u2018a\nplace\u2019 to be that which any such two bodies have in common (here\nhe claims an analogy with the Euclidean/Eudoxan definition of a\nrational number in terms of an identity relation between ratios); and\nfinally that (iii) space is all such places taken together. However,\nhe also holds that properties are particular, incapable of\nbeing instantiated by more than one individual, even at different\ntimes; hence it is impossible for the two bodies to be in\nliterally the same relations to the unchanged bodies. Thus the thing\nthat we take to be the same for the two bodies \u2013 the place\n\u2013 is something added by our minds to the situation, and only\nideal. As a result, space, which is constructed from these ideal\nplaces, is itself ideal: \u2018a certain order, wherein the mind\nconceives the application of relations\u2019.\n\nContrast this view of space with those of Descartes and of Newton.\nBoth Descartes and Newton claim that space is a real, mind-independent\nentity; for Descartes it is matter, and for Newton a\n\u2018pseudo-substance\u2019, distinct from matter. And of course\nfor both, these views are intimately tied up with their accounts of\nmotion. Leibniz simply denies the mind-independent reality of space,\nand this too is bound up with his views concerning\n motion.[10]\n6.2 Force and the Nature of Motion\n\nSo far (apart from that remark about \u2018unchanged\u2019 bodies)\nwe have not seen Leibniz introduce anything more than relations of\ndistance between bodies, which is certainly consistent with the folk\nview of his philosophy. However, Leibniz sought to provide a\nfoundation for the Cartesian/mechanical philosophy in terms of the\nAristotelian/scholastic metaphysics of substantial forms (here we\ndiscuss the views laid out in Sections 17\u201322 of the 1686\nDiscourse on Metaphysics and the 1695 Specimen of\nDynamics, both in Garber and Ariew 1989). In particular, he\nidentifies primary matter with what he calls its \u2018primitive\npassive force\u2019 of resistance to changes in motion and to\npenetration, and the substantial form of a body with its\n\u2018primitive active force\u2019. It is important to realize that\nthese forces are not mere properties of matter, but actually\nconstitute it in some sense, and further that they are not themselves\nquantifiable. However, because of the collisions of bodies with one\nanother, these forces \u2018suffer limitation\u2019, and\n\u2018derivative\u2019 passive and active forces\n result.[11]\n Derivative passive force shows up in the different degrees of\nresistance to change of different kinds of matter (of \u2018secondary\nmatter\u2019 in scholastic terms), and apparently is measurable.\nDerivative active force, however, is considerably more problematic for\nLeibniz. On the one hand, it is fundamental to his account of motion\nand theory of mechanics \u2013 motion fundamentally is\npossession of force. But on the other hand, Leibniz endorses the\nmechanical philosophy, which precisely sought to abolish Aristotelian\nsubstantial form, which active force represents. Leibniz\u2019s goal\nwas to reconcile the two philosophies, by providing an Aristotelian\nmetaphysical foundation for modern mechanical science; as we shall\nsee, it is ultimately an open question exactly how Leibniz intended to\ndeal with the inherent tensions in such a view.\n6.2.1 Vis Viva and True Motion\n\nThe texts are sufficiently ambiguous to permit dissent, but arguably\nLeibniz intends that one manifestation of derivative active force is\nwhat he calls vis viva \u2013 \u2018living force\u2019.\nLeibniz had a famous argument with the Cartesians over the correct\ndefinition of this quantity. Descartes defined it as size\ntimes speed \u2013 effectively as the magnitude of the\nmomentum of a body. Leibniz gave a brilliant argument (repeated in a\nnumber of places, for instance Section 17 of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics) that it was size times\nspeed2 \u2013 so (proportional to) kinetic\nenergy. If the proposed identification is correct then kinetic energy\nquantifies derivative active force according to Leibniz; or looked at\nthe other way, the quantity of virtus (another term used by\nLeibniz for active force) associated with a body determines its\nkinetic energy and hence its speed. As far as the authors know,\nLeibniz never explicitly says anything conclusive about the relativity\nof virtus, but it is certainly consistent to read him (as\nRoberts 2003 does) to claim that there is a unique quantity of\nvirtus and hence \u2018true\u2019 (as we have been using\nthe term) speed associated with each body. At the very least, Leibniz\ndoes say that there is a real difference between possession and\nnon-possession of vis viva (e.g., in Section 18 of the\nDiscourse) and it is a small step from there to true, privileged\nspeed. Indeed, for Leibniz, mere change of relative position is not\n\u2018entirely real\u2019 (as we saw for instance in the\nCorrespondence) and only when it has vis viva as its\nimmediate cause is there some reality to\n it.[12]\n An alternative interpretation to the one suggested here might say\nthat Leibniz intends that while there is a difference between\nmotion/virtus and no motion/virtus, there is somehow\nno difference between any strictly positive values of those\nquantities.\n\nIt is important to emphasize two points about the preceding account of\nmotion in Leibniz\u2019s philosophy. First, motion in the everyday\nsense \u2013 motion relative to something else \u2013 is\nnot real. Fundamentally motion is possession of virtus,\nsomething that is ultimately non-spatial (modulo its interpretation as\nprimitive force limited by collision). If this reading is right\n\u2013 and something along these lines seems necessary if we\naren\u2019t simply to ignore important statements by Leibniz on\nmotion \u2013 then Leibniz is offering an interpretation of motion\nthat is radically different from the obvious understanding. One might\neven say that for Leibniz motion is not movement at all! (We will\nleave to one side the question of whether his account is ultimately\ncoherent.) The second point is that however we should understand\nLeibniz, the folk reading simply does not and cannot take account of\nhis clearly and repeatedly stated view that what is real in motion is\nforce not relative motion, for the folk reading allows\nLeibniz only relative motion (and of course additionally,\nmotion in the sense of force is a variety of true motion, again\ncontrary to the folk reading).\n6.3 Motion and Dynamics\n\nHowever, from what has been said so far it is still possible that the\nfolk reading is accurate when it comes to Leibniz\u2019s views on the\nphenomena of motion, the subject of his theory of mechanics. The case\nfor the folk reading is in fact supported by Leibniz\u2019s\nresolution of the tension that we mentioned earlier, between the\nfundamental role of force/virtus (which we will now take to\nmean mass times speed2) and its\nassociation with Aristotelian form. Leibniz\u2019s way out (e.g.,\nSpecimen of Dynamics) is to require that while considerations\nof force must somehow determine the form of the laws of motion, the\nlaws themselves should be such as not to allow one to determine the\nvalue of the force (and hence true speed). One might conclude that in\nthis case Leibniz held that the only quantities which can be\ndetermined are those of relative position and motion, as the folk\nreading says. But even in this circumscribed context, it is at best\nquestionable whether the interpretation is correct.\n6.3.1 Leibniz\u2019s Mechanics\n\nConsider first Leibniz\u2019s mechanics. Since his laws are what is\nnow (ironically) often called \u2018Newtonian\u2019 elastic\ncollision theory, it seems that they satisfy both of his requirements.\nThe laws include conservation of kinetic energy (which we identify\nwith virtus), but they hold in all inertial frames, so the\nkinetic energy of any arbitrary body can be set to any initial value.\nBut they do not permit the kinetic energy of a body to take on any\nvalues throughout a process. The laws are only Galilean relativistic,\nand so are not true in every frame. Furthermore, according to the laws\nof collision, in an inertial frame, if a body does not collide then\nits Leibnizian force is conserved while if (except in special cases)\nit does collide then its force changes. According to Leibniz\u2019s\nlaws one cannot determine initial kinetic energies, but one certainly\ncan tell when they change. At the very least, there are quantities of\nmotion implicit in Leibniz\u2019s mechanics \u2013 change in force\nand true speed \u2013 that are not merely relative; the folk reading\nis committed to Leibniz simply missing this obvious fact.\n6.3.2 The Equivalence of Hypotheses\n\nThat said, when Leibniz discusses the relativity of motion \u2013\nwhich he calls the \u2018equivalence of hypotheses\u2019 about the\nstates of motion of bodies \u2013 some of his statements do suggest\nthat he was confused in this way. For another way of stating the\nproblem for the folk reading is that the claim that relative motions\nalone suffice for mechanics and that all relative motions are on a par\nis a principle of general relativity, and could Leibniz \u2013 a\nmathematical genius \u2013 really have failed to notice that his laws\nhold only in special frames? Well, just maybe. On the one hand, when\nhe explicitly articulates the principle of the equivalence of\nhypotheses (for instance in Specimen of Dynamics) he tends to\nsay only that one cannot assign initial velocities on the\nbasis of the outcome of a collision, which requires only Galilean\nrelativity. However, he confusingly also claimed (On Copernicanism\nand the Relativity of Motion, also in Garber and Ariew 1989) that\nthe Tychonic and Copernican hypotheses were equivalent. But if the\nEarth orbits the Sun in an inertial frame (Copernicus), then there is\nno inertial frame according to which the Sun orbits the Earth (Tycho\nBrahe), and vice versa: these hypotheses are simply not Galilean\nequivalent (something else Leibniz could hardly have failed to\nrealize). So there is some textual support for Leibniz endorsing\ngeneral relativity for the phenomena, as the folk reading\nmaintains.\n\nA number of commentators have suggested solutions to the puzzle of the\nconflicting pronouncements that Leibniz makes on the subject: Stein\n1977 argues for general relativity, thereby imputing a\nmisunderstanding of his own laws to Leibniz; Roberts 2003 argues for\nGalilean relativity, thereby discounting Leibniz\u2019s apparent\nstatements to the contrary. Jauernig 2004 and 2008 points out that in\nthe Specimen, Leibniz claims that all motions are composed of\nuniform rectilinear motions: an apparently curvilinear motion is\nactually a series of uniform motions, punctuated by discontinuous\ncollisions. This observation allows one to restrict the scope of\nclaims of the kind \u2018no motions can be attributed on the basis of\nphenomena\u2019 to inertial motions, and so helps read Leibniz as\nmore consistently advocating Galilean relativity, the reading Jauernig\nfavors (see also Huggett\u2019s 2006 \u2018Can Spacetime Help Settle\nAny Issues in Modern Philosophy?\u2019, in the Other Internet\nResources, which was inspired by Jauernig\u2019s work). Note that\neven in a pure collision dynamics the phenomena distinguish a body in\nuniform rectilinear motion over time, from one that undergoes\ncollisions changing its uniform rectilinear motion over time: the laws\nwill hold in the frame of the former, but not in the frame of the\nlatter. That is, apparently contrary to what Jauernig says,\nLeibniz\u2019s account of curvilinear motion does not collapse\nGalilean relativity into general relativity. In that case,\nLeibniz\u2019s specific claims of the phenomenal equivalence of\nCopernican and Tychonic hypotheses still need to be accommodated.\n6.4 Where Did the Folk Go Wrong?\n\nSo the folk reading simply ignores Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics of\nmotion, it commits Leibniz to a mathematical howler regarding his\nlaws, and it is arguable whether it is the best rendering of his\npronouncements concerning relativity; it certainly cannot be accepted\nunquestioningly. However, it is not hard to understand the temptation\nof the folk reading. In his Correspondence with Clarke,\nLeibniz says that he believes space to be \u201csomething merely\nrelative, as time is, \u2026 an order of coexistences, as time is an\norder of successions\u201d (LIII.4), which is naturally taken to mean\nthat space is at base nothing but the distance and temporal relations\nbetween bodies. (Though even this passage has its subtleties, because\nof the ideality of space discussed above, and because in\nLeibniz\u2019s conception space determines what sets of relations are\npossible.) And if relative distances and times exhaust the\nspatiotemporal in this way, then shouldn\u2019t all\nquantities of motion be defined in terms of those relations?\n\nWe have seen two ways in which this would be the wrong conclusion to\ndraw. Force seems to involve a notion of speed that is not\nidentified with any relative speed. And (unless the equivalence of\nhypotheses is after all a principle of general relativity), the laws\npick out a standard of constant motion that need not be any constant\nrelative motion. Of course, it is hard to reconcile these quantities\nwith the view of space and time that Leibniz proposes \u2013 what is\nspeed in size times speed2 or\nconstant speed if not speed relative to some body or to\nabsolute space? Given Leibniz\u2019s view that space is literally\nideal (and indeed that even relative motion is not \u2018entirely\nreal\u2019) perhaps the best answer is that he took force\nand hence motion in its real sense not to be determined by\nmotion in a relative sense at all, but to be primitive monadic\nquantities. That is, he took x moves to be a 1-place\npredicate, but he believed that it could be fully analyzed in terms of\nstrictly monadic predicates: x moves iff x\npossesses-non-zero-derivative-active-force. And this reading\nexplains just what Leibniz took us to be supposing when we\n\u2018supposed certain bodies to be unchanged\u2019 in the\nconstruction of the idea of space: that they had no force, nothing\ncausing, or making real any motion.\n6.5 Leibniz\u2019s Response to Newton\u2019s Scholium\n\nIt\u2019s again helpful to compare Leibniz with Descartes and Newton,\nthis time regarding motion. Commentators often express frustration at\nLeibniz\u2019s response to Newton\u2019s arguments for absolute\nspace: \u201cI find nothing \u2026 in the Scholium that\nproves or can prove the reality of space in itself. However, I grant\nthat there is a difference between an absolute true motion of a body\nand a mere relative change \u2026\u201d (LV.53). Not only does\nLeibniz apparently fail to take the argument seriously, he then goes\non to concede the step in the argument that seems to require absolute\nspace! But with our understanding of Newton and Leibniz, we can see\nthat what he says makes perfect sense (or at least that it is not as\ndisingenuous as it is often taken to be).\n\nNewton argues in the Scholium that true motion cannot be\nidentified with the kinds of motion that Descartes considers; but both\nof these are purely relative motions, and Leibniz is in complete\nagreement that merely relative motions are not true (i.e.,\n\u2018entirely real\u2019). Leibniz\u2019s \u2018concession\u2019\nmerely registers his agreement with Newton against Descartes on the\ndifference between true and relative motion; he surely understood who\nand what Newton was refuting, and it was a position that he had\nhimself, in different terms, publicly argued against at length. But as\nwe have seen, Leibniz had a very different analysis of the difference\nto Newton\u2019s; true motion was not, for him, a matter of motion\nrelative to absolute space, but the possession of quantity of force,\nontologically prior to any spatiotemporal quantities at all. There is\nindeed nothing in the Scholium explicitly directed against\nthat view, and since it does potentially offer an alternative way of\nunderstanding true motion, it is not unreasonable for Leibniz to claim\nthat there is no deductive inference from true motion to absolute\nspace.\n7. \u2018Not-Newton\u2019 versus \u2018Be-Leibniz\u2019\n7.1 Non Sequiturs Mistakenly Attributed to Newton\n\nThe folk reading which belies Leibniz has it that he sought a theory\nof mechanics formulated in terms only of the relations between bodies.\nAs we\u2019ll see in the companion article, in the Nineteenth\nCentury, Ernst Mach indeed proposed such an approach, but Leibniz\nclearly did not; though certain similarities between Leibniz and Mach\n\u2013 especially the rejection of absolute space \u2013\nsurely helps explain the confusion between the two. But not only is\nLeibniz often misunderstood, there are influential misreadings of\nNewton\u2019s arguments in the Scholium, influenced by the\nidea that he is addressing Leibniz in some way. Of course the\nPrincipia was written 30 years before the\nCorrespondence, and the arguments of the Scholium\nwere not written with Leibniz in mind, but Clarke himself suggests\n(CIV.13) that those arguments \u2013 specifically those concerning\nthe bucket \u2013 are telling against Leibniz. That argument is\nindeed devastating to the parity of all relative motions, but we have\nseen that it is highly questionable whether Leibniz\u2019s\nequivalence of hypotheses amounts to such a view. That said, his\nstatements in the first four letters of the Correspondence\ncould understandably mislead Clarke on this point \u2013 it is in\nreply to Clarke\u2019s challenge that Leibniz explicitly denies the\nparity of relative motions. But, interestingly, Clarke does not\npresent a true version of Newton\u2019s argument \u2013 despite some\ninvolvement of Newton in writing the replies. Instead of the argument\nfrom the uniqueness of the rate of rotation, he argues that systems\nwith different velocities must be different because the effects\nobserved if they were brought to rest would be different.\nThis argument is of course utterly question begging against a view\nthat holds that there is no privileged standard of rest (the view\nClarke mistakenly attributes to Leibniz)!\n\nAs we discuss further in the companion article, Mach attributed to\nNewton the fallacious argument that because the surface of the water\ncurved even when it was not in motion relative to the bucket, it must\nbe rotating relative to absolute space. Our discussion of Newton\nshowed how misleading such a reading is. In the first place he also\nargues that there must be some privileged sense of rotation, and hence\nnot all relative motions are equal. Second, the argument is ad\nhominem against Descartes, in which context a disjunctive\nsyllogism \u2013 motion is either proper or ordinary or relative to\nabsolute space \u2013 is argumentatively legitimate. On the other\nhand, Mach is quite correct that Newton\u2019s argument in the\nScholium leaves open the logical possibility that the\nprivileged, true sense of rotation (and acceleration more generally)\nis some species of relative motion; if not motion properly speaking,\nthen relative to the fixed stars perhaps. (In fact Newton rejects this\npossibility in De Gravitatione (1962) on the grounds that it\nwould involve an odious action at a distance; an ironic position given\nhis theory of universal gravity.)\n7.2 The Best Explanation Argument Mistakenly Attributed to Newton\n\nThe kind of folk-reading of Newton that underlies much of the\ncontemporary literature replaces Mach\u2019s interpretation with a\nmore charitable one: for instance, Dasgupta 2015, is a recent\ninfluential presentation of the following dialectic, and its relation\nto\n symmetry\n arguments. According to this reading, Newton\u2019s point is that\nhis mechanics \u2013 unlike Descartes\u2019 [special\ncharacter:mdash] could explain why the surface of the\nrotating water is curved, that his explanation involves a privileged\nsense of rotation, and that absent an alternative hypothesis about its\nrelative nature, we should accept absolute space. But our discussion\nof Newton\u2019s argument showed that it simply does not have an\n\u2018abductive[special character:rsquo], \u2018best\nexplanation\u2019 form, but shows deductively, from Cartesian\npremises, that rotation is neither proper nor ordinary motion.\n\nThat is not to say that Newton had no understanding of how such\neffects would be explained in his mechanics. For instance, in\nCorollaries V and VI to the Definitions of the Principles he\nstates in general terms the conditions under which different states of\nmotion are not \u2013 and so by implication are \u2013\ndiscernible according to his laws of mechanics. Nor is it to say that\nNewton\u2019s contemporaries weren\u2019t seriously concerned with\nexplaining inertial effects. Leibniz, for instance, analyzed a\nrotating body (in the Specimen). In short, parts of a\nrotating system collide with the surrounding matter and are\ncontinuously deflected, into a series of linear motions that form a\ncurved path. (Though the system as Leibniz envisions it \u2013\ncomprised of a plenum of elastic particles of matter \u2013 is far\ntoo complex for him to offer any quantitative model based on this\nqualitative picture. So he had no serious alternative explanation of\ninertial effects.)\n7.3 Substantivalism and The Best Explanation Argument\n7.3.1 The Rotating Spheres\n\nAlthough the argument is then not Newton\u2019s, it is still an\nimportant response to the kind of relationism proposed by the\nfolk-Leibniz, especially when it is extended by bringing in a further\nexample from Newton\u2019s Scholium. Newton considered a\npair of identical spheres, connected by a cord, too far from any\nbodies to observe any relative motions; he pointed out that their rate\nand direction of rotation could still be experimentally determined by\nmeasuring the tension in the cord, and by pushing on opposite faces of\nthe two globes to see whether the tension increased or decreased. He\nintended this simple example to demonstrate that the project he\nintended in the Principia, of determining the absolute\naccelerations and hence gravitational forces on the planets from their\nrelative motions, was possible. However, if we further specify that\nthe spheres and cord are rigid and that they are the only\nthings in their universe, then the example can be used to point out\nthat there are infinitely many different rates of rotation all of\nwhich agree on the relations between bodies. Since there are no\ndifferences in the relations between bodies in the different\nsituations, it follows that the observable differences\nbetween the states of rotation cannot be explained in terms of the\nrelations between bodies. Therefore, a theory of the kind attributed\nto the folk\u2019s Leibniz cannot explain all the phenomena of\nNewtonian mechanics, and again we can argue abductively for absolute\n space.[13]\n\nThis argument is not Newton\u2019s, neither the premises nor\nconclusion, and must not be taken as a historically accurate reading,\nHowever, that is not to say that the argument is fallacious, and\nindeed many have found it attractive, particularly as a defense not of\nNewton\u2019s absolute space, but of Galilean spacetime. That is,\nNewtonian mechanics with Galilean spacetime can explain the phenomena\nassociated with rotation, while theories of the kind proposed by Mach\ncannot explain the differences between situations allowed by Newtonian\nmechanics; but these explanations rely on the geometric structure of\nGalilean spacetime \u2013 particularly its affine connection, to\ninterpret acceleration. And thus \u2013 the argument goes \u2013\nthose explanations commit us to the reality of spacetime: a manifold\nof points whose properties include the appropriate geometric ones.\nThis final doctrine, of the reality of spacetime with its component\npoints or regions, distinct from matter, with geometric properties, is\nwhat we earlier identified as \u2018substantivalism\u2019.\n7.3.2 Relationist Responses\n\nThere are two points to make about this line of argument. First, the\nrelationist could reply that they need not explain all situations\nwhich are possible according to Newtonian mechanics, because that\ntheory is to be rejected in favor of one which invokes only distance\nand time relations between bodies, but which approximates to\nNewton\u2019s if matter is distributed suitably. Such a relationist\nwould be following Mach\u2019s proposal, which we will discuss in the\nsequel article. Such a position would be satisfactory only to the\nextent that a suitable concrete replacement theory to Newton\u2019s\ntheory is developed; Mach never offered such a theory, but recently\nmore progress has been made (again, see the companion article for\ndiscussion).\n\nSecond, one must be careful in understanding just how the argument\nworks, for it is tempting to gloss it by saying that in Newtonian\nmechanics the affine connection is a crucial part of the explanation\nof the surface of the water in the bucket, and if the spacetime which\ncarries the connection is denied, then the explanation fails too. But\nthis gloss tacitly assumes that Newtonian mechanics can only be\nunderstood in a substantial Galilean spacetime; if an interpretation\nof Newtonian mechanics that does not assume substantivalism can be\nconstructed, then all Newtonian explanations can be given without\npostulating a connection in an ontologically significant sense. Both\nSklar (1974) and van Fraassen (1970) have made proposals along these\nlines.\n\nSklar proposes interpreting \u2018true\u2019 acceleration as a\nprimitive quantity not defined in terms of motion relative to\nanything, be it absolute space, a connection or other bodies. (Ray\n1991 points out the family resemblance between this proposal and\nLeibniz\u2019s suggestion that vis viva addresses\nNewton\u2019s Scholium arguments.) Van Fraassen proposes\nformulating mechanics as \u2018Newton\u2019s Laws hold in\nsome frame\u2019, so that the form of the laws and the\ncontingent relative motions of bodies \u2013 not absolute space or a\nconnection, or even any instantaneous relations \u2013 pick out a\nstandard of true motion, namely with respect to such an\n\u2018inertial frame\u2019. These proposals aim to keep the full\nexplanatory resources of Newtonian mechanics, and hence admit\n\u2018true acceleration\u2019, but deny any relations between bodies\nand spacetime itself. Like the actual Leibniz, they allow absolute\nquantities of motion, but claim that space and time themselves are\nnothing but the relations between bodies.\n\nSome may question how the laws can be such as to privilege frames\nwithout prior spacetime geometry. In reply, Huggett 2006 proposes that\nthe laws be understood as a Humean \u2018best system\u2019 (see the\nentry on\n laws of nature)\n for a world of bodies and their relations; the laws don\u2019t\nreflect prior geometric structure, but systematic regularities in\npatterns of relative motions. For obvious reasons, this proposal is\ncalled \u2018regularity relationism\u2019. (Several authors have\ndeveloped a similar approach to a variety of physical theories: for\ninstance, Vassallo & Esfeld 2016.) This approach is committed to\nthe idea that in some sense Newton\u2019s laws are capable of\nexplaining all the phenomena without recourse to spacetime geometry;\nthat the connection and the metrical properties are explanatorily\nredundant. This idea is also at the core of the \u2018Dynamical\nApproach\u2019, discussed in the companion article.\n\nAnother approach is to consider fully spatiotemporal relations. For\ninstance, Maudlin 1993 discusses the possibility of a \u2018Newtonian\nrelationism\u2019 which adds cross-temporal distance\nrelations, i.e., distances between bodies at distinct moments of time.\nWith such distances, relationists can capture (almost) the full\nstructure of Newtonian space, and time, including the affine structure\nrequired for Newton\u2019s first and second laws.\n8. Beyond Newton\n\nIn sum: we have seen how historical authors, from Aristotle through to\nNewtonian and Leibniz, tackled the puzzles of motion and change in\nphysical theorising. In a sequel entry on\n absolute and relational space and motion: post-Newtonian theories,\n we will see how post-Newtonian authors, from Mach through to Einstein\nand other contemporary physicists and philosophers, have brought new\nconceptual and technical resources to bear on (arguably) the selfsame\nissues. The sequel also includes a longer conclusion, reflecting on\nthe themes running through both articles.\n\nFor now we will just note that we have focussed on authors who made\ncontributions to the science of mechanics, and so a significant\nphilosophical lacuna is a discussion of Kant\u2019s views on space\nand motion.
