    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe relationship between feminism and transgender theory and politics\nis surprisingly fraught. The goal in this entry is to outline some of\nthe key philosophical issues at the intersections, and this can be\naccomplished only by attending to the history of feminist and trans\npolitics as it has unfolded in the U.S. \u201cTransgender\u201d as a\npolitics and \u201ctrans studies\u201d as a twin of \u201cqueer\nstudies\u201d (Stryker 2004) emerged in the early 1990s and this\nemergence is intertwined with feminist as well as queer theory and\npolitics. (These terms will be explained below.) Consequently, this\nentry will follow a roughly chronological order.\n\n\nOne major set of philosophical themes concerns competing conceptions\nof the self and its relation to the sexed body and to gender.\n(Biological sex is often distinguished from gender,\ntaken as the cultural roles assigned on the basis of sex). Is the self\nprior to the institution of gender identity? Is sex the\n\u201chardware\u201d on which the program of gender is run, or is sex\nitself thoroughly cultural? If the self is irrevocably immersed in\ncultural gender, how is resistance to gender oppression possible at\nall? Moreover, how should answers to these questions inform feminist\npolitics and theory? How should they inform trans politics and\ntheory?\n\n\nA related set of themes concerns the political and philosophical\ndifficulties in formulating a theory of gender oppression and\nstrategies for resistance when multiple modalities of oppression are\nrecognized: If trans people are oppressed as trans people and\nwomen are oppressed as women, then it would seem we need an\naccount of at least two different modalities of gender oppression. Do\nthese two different modalities lead to politics that are inevitably at\nodds with each other? And if so how could we then accommodate\nindividuals who are oppressed as woman and as trans people? How\nis coalition among non trans feminists and trans activists possible?\nWhere are the grounds of commonality? Where are the tensions?\n",
