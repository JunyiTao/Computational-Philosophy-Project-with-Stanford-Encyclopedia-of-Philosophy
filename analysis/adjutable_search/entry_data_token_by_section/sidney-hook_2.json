Hook\u2019s Defense of Ethical Naturalism\n\nHook\u2019s activist involvement in many of the major moral issues\nthat emerged in the political debates of the 1930s was connected to a\nmajor theoretical issue of ethical theory: the possibility of the\ndetermination and the justification of objective, normative\nstatements. In ethical theory, Hook aimed to provide a clear and\nconsistent formulation of Deweyan ethical naturalism. In his John\nDewey: An Intellectual Portrait of 1939, Hook began his\ndiscussion by quoting in full Dewey\u2019s view about the centrality\nof ethics for philosophy. Dewey wrote, \u201cthe central problem of\nphilosophy is the relation that exists between the beliefs about the\nnature of things due to natural science to beliefs about values\n\u2013 using that word to designate whatever is taken to have\nrightful authority in the direction of conduct.\u201d Dewey\ncontinued: \u201cthe problem of restoring integration and\nco-operation between man\u2019s beliefs about the world in which he\nlives and his beliefs about the values and purposes that should direct\nhis conduct is the deepest problem of modern life\u201d (Hook,\nJohn Dewey: An Intellectual Portrait, 1939, 128).\n\nIn his discussion of Dewey\u2019s ethical naturalism in the\n\u201cportrait,\u201d Hook proceeded to bring together different\nstrands of Dewey\u2019s ethical theory that had been developed\nthroughout his philosophical career, from his early textbook on ethics\nin 1908 through Human Nature and Conduct to The Quest for\nCertainty and concluding with The Theory of Valuation of\n1937. Hook stresses that a common feature of Dewey\u2019s diverse\npresentations of his ethical theory is the location and derivation of\nmorality within the scope of nature, particularly the understanding of\nhuman nature. Accordingly, for Dewey, there is an intimate connection,\nrather than a bifurcation, between value and fact, the\n\u201cought\u201d and the \u201cis,\u201d or the prescriptive and\nthe descriptive. A major argument of Dewey\u2019s for this\nconnection, which is the hallmark of his ethical naturalism, was\ndeveloped in the chapter on the \u201cConstruction of Good\u201d in\nThe Quest for Certainty. Hook shares the Deweyan naturalist\nview that is developed in that chapter that the term\n\u201cGood\u201d can be understood by reference to the\n\u201cdesirable\u201d. Emphasizing this naturalistic analysis, Hook,\nlike Dewey, recognized the prescriptive component in desirability.\n\u201cThe desirable\u201d refers to what ought to be\ndesired, not only to what could be desired or what\nis desired. Hook insisted that the prescriptive component is\nnot separated from the descriptive facts of desire. The connection\nbetween the desirable and the desired was not deemed to be a fallacy\nwhich overlooked the gulf between the \u201cought\u201d and the\n\u201cis,\u201d but a justified recognition of the way in which the\nmoral norms for human behavior were developed by recognizing the\nempirical needs, interests and desires of human beings. Dewey\nidentified phrases like \u201cthe desirable\u201d with similar\nterms, such as \u201clikeable\u201d and \u201cenjoyable.\u201d In\neach case, the dispositional term could not be reduced to a singular\nepisodic term. To claim that an object, event or experience was\nlikeable, desirable or enjoyable was not so much to claim that it had\nbeen liked, desired or enjoyed by a subject, but involved a species of\npredictive hypothesis, namely, that it could or would be enjoyed by\nother persons who possessed the relevant potential capacities. The\ndenial that statements about \u201cthe Good\u201d were subjective\nand the recognition that they involved a predictive hypothesis led to\nthe more general thesis that statements about the good, or normative\nstatements, were to be interpreted as statements regarding what would\nbe desired by persons who understood the nature of their desires and\nknew the consequences of their desires. Accordingly, ethical norms\nwere not subjective or relative but represented cognitive empirical\npredictions that could be verified or confirmed. They were hypotheses\nabout what would be liked or enjoyed or desired by persons who had\ninvestigated critically the nature of their desires, analyzed\nrationally the optimal means required to satisfy those desires and\nwere sensitive to the consequences of their desires. The derivation of\na fundamental moral term like \u201cGood\u201d from the empirical\nand experiential elements of human desires determined the naturalist\ncharacter of Deweyan ethics. While human desires could be perverse,\nsuch as malicious desires that would wreak havoc with the lives of\nother people, Hook\u2019s belief was that such perverse desires could\nnot withstand the tests required for normative acceptance. Without\nbeing able to appeal to an absolute intuitive exclusion of such\nmalicious desires or of perverse policies that were motivated by these\ndesires, Deweyan naturalism argued that such desires would not meet\nthe criteria for acceptance as norms. Such desires could be understood\nas incoherent, self-contradictory or self-destructive, and they would\ninevitably conflict with other desires as well as lead to\ncounter-productive consequences which would mandate their\nunacceptability. Thus, ethical norms were neither subjective\nexpressions of likes, preferences or desires nor intuitive absolutes\nthat were moral imperatives without any connection to human desires or\ninterests, but were empirical hypotheses regarding optimal norms for\nrealizing desirable ends. Accordingly, empirical statements were\ncognitive and could be shown in principle to be either true or\nfalse.\n\nIn his chapter on Dewey\u2019s ethical theory in Intellectual\nPortrait, Hook also stressed Dewey\u2019s belief that since\nnormative ethical statements were cognitive empirical hypotheses,\nscientific method could be used to mediate between conflicting\nhypotheses (Hook, John Dewey: An Intellectual Portrait, 1939,\nChapter VII, \u201cStandards, Ends, and Means\u201d). Thus Hook\nassumed that there was a method of verification for normative\nhypotheses by an appeal to their consequences. Hook\u2019s\nillustrations of this use of scientific method in ethics, however, are\ncharacteristically developed for cases of competing social, economic\nor educational policies. Even in these contexts, the question can be\nraised whether there is a blurring of the differences between the ways\nin which verification functions in scientific experiments and the ways\nverification can function in decisions evaluating social policy.\nFurther, even if it were conceded that it is possible to achieve a\nkind of \u201cverification\u201d or \u201cdisconfirmation\u201d of\npolicy decisions on such issues as the desirability of minimum wage\nlegislation or the prohibition of narcotics in American society,\nHook\u2019s critics were concerned about the distance between the\nnotion of \u201cmediation of conflicting opinions by an appeal to\nconsequence\u201d in such contexts of decision among policy options\nand the contexts of the emerging disputes over practices of racial\ngenocide or the use of concentration camps as instruments of\nideological rehabilitation. Consequently, Dewey\u2019s ethical\nempiricism was subject to continuous challenge during the 1930s and\n40s on the charge that it presupposed an optimistic interpretation of\nhuman nature which could not be sustained in light of the new\nrealities of totalitarianism and genocide.\n\nThe focus of Hook\u2019s concern in ethical theory over several\ndecades was the continuing defense of Deweyan ethical naturalism.\nDuring the decade of the 1940s, a number of ethical and political\nworks were written that represented reactions to the historical evils\nthat had emerged into public consciousness after the Second World War.\nThese works involved reconsiderations of the causes for the phenomena\nof human evil and of historical regression that were identified with\nthe institutions of \u201cthe concentration camp universe\u201d and\nof mass murder. These works generally involved a rejection of ethical\nnaturalism and the recurrent claim that the Deweyan approach reflected\nan excessively optimistic and unrealistic interpretation of human\nnature.\n\nThus at one pole, anti-naturalist ethical theories were derived from\ninterpretations of current historical phenomena. Some of the\nanti-naturalist doctrines in ethics developed theses that were\nanalogous to the religious doctrine of \u201coriginal sin.\u201d\nThis tendency was evidenced by the popularity achieved by the writings\nof theological critics of Deweyan ethical naturalism such as Reinhold\nNiebuhr in the 1950s. The dual theme of these works involved both a\ndescriptive interpretation of the perversity, malice and\nimperfectability of human nature, as well as an ontological or\nmeta-ethical thesis about the need for a non-natural, that is,\nreligious or rational-intuitionist basis and source for moral\nimperatives in human society and history.\n\nHook\u2019s defense of ethical naturalism against the anti-naturalist\nwritings that were related to contemporaneous historical events also\ninvolved him in the rejection of Existentialist ethical theory. The\nempiricism and objectivity that were hallmarks of Dewey\u2019s\nethical theory were antithetical to the Heideggerian or Sartrean\ninterpretation of normative ethical assertions as arbitrary\ncommitments which represent the choices of persons who bear the burden\nof freedom and self-consciousness. Hook defended the pragmatic view\nthat normative ethical judgments are evaluated and their truth or\nadequacy can be confirmed by an appeal to their consequences against\nthe Existentialist thesis that the only criteria available for\nevaluation of a person\u2019s moral commitments is one of their\nauthenticity to the agent\u2019s being engag\u00e9e in the\nsituation or accepting of the burden of responsibility for his\npersonal commitments. The darkened canvass of moral phenomenology that\nemerged during the decade of the 1940s, with its scenes of total war,\nseemingly absurd resistance, and irrational genocide, did not alter\nHook\u2019s identification with the moral naturalism that had been\ndeveloped as part of the moral canon of the earlier decades of the\ntwentieth century.\n\nAt the opposite pole of philosophical methodology, the focus of\ninquiry was not upon contemporaneous historical phenomena but upon the\nanalysis of language, particularly the constructed languages of logic\nand mathematics and upon the paradigm of knowledge as delineated in\nempirical discourse and the languages of the empirical sciences. At\nthis pole also, ethical naturalism was rejected in favor of an account\nof ethical statements as expressions of emotive attitude. From this\nperspective, ethical theory was not to be derived from interpretations\nof history and human nature but from an analysis of logical language\nand the nature of the languages of the empirical sciences. Dewey and\nHook believed that this interpretation of ethical language as\nexpressions of emotive attitude was not justified by an analysis of\nthe ways in which ethical propositions originated in human society or\nwere supported in the context of ethical practice. The ground for the\nemotivist position, in their view, was the logical positivist thesis\nthat there could be only two kinds of cognitive statements. One kind\nof statement was cognitively analytic, that is, a class of the\nstatements that were true or false by virtue of the rules of language.\nThe second kind of statement was cognitively empirical, that is, a\nclass of statements that are asserted to be true or false by virtue of\nsense experience. Statements that were neither analytically true (or\nfalse) nor empirically verifiable were thus non-cognitive, that is,\nneither true nor false. Expressions of emotive attitude like\n\u201cHoorah for Stanford!\u201d are exemplified as non-cognitive\nexpressions of emotive attitude. There may be special circumstances in\nwhich moral statements admit of analytical truth or falsity, just as\nthere are significant cases where moral statements are empirically\nverifiable and can be claimed to be probably true or probably false.\nYet, in the logical positivist account, since most moral statements do\nnot appear to be true or false by virtue of the rules of language or\nto be verifiable in the way in which statements are verifiable in the\nexperimental sciences, they must be understood as expressions of\nemotive attitude. Against emotivism, Dewey and Hook argued that the\npragmatic elucidation of moral statements considered them in the\ncontexts of their use in framing moral policy and argument, while the\nlogical positivist analysis of ethical statements did not derive from\nthe consideration of the actual contexts in which ethical statements\nas judgments of practice functioned and received their\njustification.\n\nWith reference to the debate in ethical theory between logical\npositivism and pragmatism, there is a relevant and seemingly\nparadoxical event that forms an interesting part of the historical\nrecord. Despite the significant differences that were evident between\nthe views of logical positivism and pragmatism in ethical theory, the\neditors of the Encyclopedia for Unified Science, a\nmultivolume work which had been projected to represent the\nauthoritative formulation of the position of logical positivism in\nseveral fields of philosophy, had decided to ask John Dewey to author\nthe essay on ethical theory. The invitation for Dewey to contribute to\nthe Encyclopedia was given by Otto Neurath in a meeting at\nDewey\u2019s home in New York City in 1937. Along with Neurath and\nDewey, Sidney Hook, who had emerged as previously noted as a major\nexpositor of Dewey\u2019s ethical theory and Ernest Nagel, who had\nplayed a major role in advancing the dialogue between American\npragmatism and European analytical philosophy, were present at the\ndiscussion. After Dewey had expressed an initial reluctance which\nstemmed from his perception of the distance between his own views and\nthose of Neurath in epistemology, Dewey consented to write the volume\nwhich was published in the Encyclopedia as Theory of\nValuation.\n\nIn that work, Dewey reiterated his strong disagreement with the view\nthat ethical statements could be relegated to a class of non-cognitive\nexpressions of emotive attitude. Dewey developed a distinction between\nmoral statements in their function as \u201cprizings\u201d in\ncontrast with their function as \u201cappraisals.\u201d Without\nmaking explicit reference to A.J. Ayer or any other logical\npositivist, Dewey suggested that the logical positivist doctrine that\nhad categorized ethical statements as expressions of emotive attitude\ncould be understood as an identification of the \u201cprizing\u201d\nfunction of moral statements. For Dewey, normative moral statements\ncould be interpreted more adequately as \u201cappraisals,\u201d that\nis, as statements which went beyond the expression of personal\nattitudes of prizing in order to assert cognitive claims about the\nvalues of entities or experiences that could be tested by other\npersons. Although \u201cprizings\u201d could be analogized to\nemotive attitudes, appraisals were understood as empirical statements\nwhose claims about the value of an object could be confirmed as true\nor false based upon intersubjective experience and upon their future\nempirical consequences.\n\nThe continuing debate on the issue of the linguistic status of\nnormative statements generated an effort to clarify the nature of\nethical disagreement as a means for the resolution of that debate. In\nC.L. Stevenson\u2019s Ethics in Language, the analysis of\nthe nature of ethical disagreement was considered as providing a\nmethod of mediation between pragmatist and logical positivist views in\nethical theory. In his graduate seminars on ethical theory, Hook made\nuse of Stevenson\u2019s Ethics in Language as the point of\ndeparture for his defense of pragmatic ethics against the criticisms\nthat derived from the analysis of moral language. Stevenson had\nlocated Dewey\u2019s interpretation of ethical norms within the broad\nframework of patterns of moral discourse. For Stevenson, dispute over\nDeweyan norms or appraisals would represent a pattern that he\nidentified as \u201cdisagreement-in-belief.\u201d For this kind of\ndisagreement Stevenson shared Dewey\u2019s view that scientific\nmethod provided a competent mode of adjudication. Normative\ndisagreement of this kind could be considered as a parallel to\nempirical disagreement on experimental scientific questions where true\ndecisions between conflicting hypotheses could be arrived at by an\nappeal to the evidence of their future consequences.\n\nStevenson sought to demonstrate, however, that moral disagreement was\nmore adequately represented by the linguistic pattern which he\nidentified as disagreement in attitude. For this kind of disagreement,\nStevenson shared the non-cognitivist conclusion of the logical\npositivists, according to which there would be no rational or\nscientific method for mediating among conflicting opinions by an\nappeal to their future consequences. Ethical disagreement of this type\ncould be brought to an end only by a change in attitude. Along the\nlines of Stevenson\u2019s approach, philosophers who rejected the\nethical naturalism of Dewey and Hook have examined the ways in which\ndisagreement in attitude can be related to different structures of\nperception, plural or diverse interpretive discourses, and conversion\nto alternative paradigms.\n\nIn examining the anti-naturalism in ethical theory that was derived\nfrom the analysis of language, Hook followed Dewey in stressing the\ndistinction between prizings and appraisals. Thus, in Hook\u2019s\nview, moral statements, like empirical scientific statements, were to\nbe considered as hypotheses whose truth or falsity would depend upon\ntheir confirmation by future experience. Consequently, this\nnaturalistic and empirical interpretation of ethical statements\ninvolved Hook in continuing debates with the proponents of competing\ninterpretations of ethical statements, such as C.L. Stevenson.\nStevenson had proposed two reasons in justification of his view that\nmoral disagreement was most fundamentally disagreement in attitude\nand, therefore, differentiated from scientific or empirical\ndisagreement. One reason, according to Stevenson, was that persons\ncould agree about all the facts that were relevant to a moral dispute\nand yet hold different attitudes on the issue so that they supported\ndifferent policies. The second reason cited by Stevenson was that a\ndisagreement was considered to be resolved when the persons involved\nin the dispute converged on an agreement in attitude even if they\nmaintained differing views about the facts. On the other hand, the\nmoral dispute was not resolved if persons who had agreed on the facts\ncontinued to disagree in their attitudes about the question at\nissue.\n\nHook provided naturalistic rebuttals to these two arguments advanced\nby Stevenson on the attitudinal interpretation of ethical statements.\nHook argued that in the case in which seeming agreement on all the\nfacts was conjoined with a continuing disagreement in attitude, it was\nnot legitimate to exclude the possibility of an undisclosed factual\ndisagreement. Future investigation might uncover disagreement about\nrelevant facts that could have an impact in changing attitudes.\nHook\u2019s claim is that the premise of Stevenson\u2019s argument,\nnamely, that all the facts relevant to attitudes in a moral\ndispute have been discovered, is not demonstrable. That is, there is\nno form of completeness theorem which would explicate the notion of\nall the facts. Thus, the pragmatic thesis that normative\nstatements are empirical appraisals that are open to confirmation by\nfuture consequences is not refuted by Stevenson\u2019s identification\nof disagreement in attitude, since the discovery of future facts may\nbring about a change in attitude.\n\nFurther, agreement in attitude by parties to a dispute does not\nnecessarily imply, as Stevenson suggests, that the moral dispute has\nbeen resolved. It is notorious that a resort to force by one\nprotagonist in a moral dispute can change the balance of power so that\nthe other party to the dispute must adopt a different attitude toward\nthe issue for prudential reasons. Yet the conclusion of such an\nepisode would be that the use of force had brought about a settlement\nof the dispute but not necessarily that it had resolved the ethical\ndisagreement. A change in attitude by a person who has been a party to\na dispute which results in the resolution of the conflict does not\nnecessarily mean that the moral issue which precipitated that conflict\nhas been satisfactorily resolved. The end of a dispute through the\nconvergence of attitudes differs in those cases where the change of\nattitude reflects the acceptance of the realities of power or is the\nproduct of conditioning, as in hypnotic submission, from those cases\nwhere the change of attitude has derived from convergence on the facts\nat issue in the dispute.\n\nIn this connection, it could be argued, apparently contra Stevenson,\nthat attitudes of extreme prejudice are virtually always defended by\nan appeal to reasons or facts as supporting the prejudicial attitude.\nA person who has an ethnic or racial prejudice does not simply express\nhis prejudicial attitude but tends to rationalize it by asserting\njustifying reasons in support of the attitude. It may be true that the\ndemonstration that these reasons are in point of fact false does not\ncustomarily lead to the abandonment or withdrawal of the prejudicial\nattitude. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of rationalization suggests that\nover the long run, the sustaining of even prejudicial attitudes\nrequires support by reasons. The demonstration that the supporting\nreasons are factually false tends to bring with it some degree of\nrevision in attitude.\n\nThe issues in the debate between the Stevenson variant of\nnon-naturalist emotivism and pragmatic naturalism were not resolved,\nbut the locus of the debate over ethical naturalism shifted. This\nshift occurred because of a new turn in the reigning methodology of\nphilosophy. The logical positivist focus on the language of science,\nlike the more generalized Deweyan focus on scientific method, was\nreplaced by the focus on understanding the rules governing the use of\nconceptual terms in ordinary language. In the context of ethical\nnaturalism, the analysis of the moral vocabulary involved the\nexplication or definition of \u201cGood\u201d as a term of\ncommendation for reasons. Thus the emotive aspects of the moral\nvocabulary could be interpreted by identifying the commendatory\ngoading or prescriptive functions of moral terms. At the same time,\nthe empirical or pragmatic aspects of the moral vocabulary could be\ninterpreted by identifying the way in which reasons were advanced in\nsupport of commendations or prescriptions. On the whole, Hook did not\nseek to develop a bridge between Deweyan naturalism and the works of\nordinary language philosophy. He recognized that the works of Austin\nand Ryle involved theses about the nature of mind and the nature of\nexperience which were compatible with and supportive of Dewey\u2019s\nnaturalism. Hook did not pursue, however, the defense of ethical\nnaturalism in the vocabulary and methodology that had been advanced by\nphilosophers of ethics like Stuart Hampshire and Philippa Foot.\nRather, Hook\u2019s pragmatism led him away from the ongoing debate\nin ethical theory toward the application of Deweyan naturalism and\nempiricism on contemporary issues in education, politics and\nsociety.\n",
