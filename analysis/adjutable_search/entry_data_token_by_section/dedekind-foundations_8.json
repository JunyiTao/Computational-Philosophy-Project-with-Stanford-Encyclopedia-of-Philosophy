    "main_text": "Methodology and Epistemology\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nWe started out by considering Dedekind\u2019s contributions to the\nfoundations of mathematics in his overtly foundational writings: the\ntwo booklets, Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen (1872) and\nWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen? (1888). We then added a\nsketch and preliminary analysis of the methodological innovations in\nhis more mainstream mathematical writings, from his work in algebraic\nnumber theory to other areas. We also noted that the logical and\nmetaphysical position in his foundational work is closely tied to his\nmore general methodological and epistemological perspective. In this\nsense, any attempt to distinguish sharply between his\n\u201cfoundational\u201d and his \nother \u201cmathematical\u201d\nwritings is misguided; Dedekind made foundationally relevant\ncontributions throughout his work. In fact, his case provides a good\nargument and illustration for a more general lesson. Namely, any\nstrict distinction between \n\u201cfoundational\u201d or\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d \nquestions about mathematics, on the one hand, and \n\u201cinner-mathematical\u201d or\n\u201cpractice-based\u201d questions, \non the other hand, is\ncounterproductive in the end, especially if one does not want to\nimpoverish both sides.\n\nIf we look at Dedekind\u2019s contributions from such a perspective, the\nsum total is impressive. He was not only one of the greatest\nmathematicians of the nineteenth century, but also one of its subtlest\nphilosophers of mathematics. With his structuralist views about the\nnature of mathematical entities and about how to investigate them, he\nwas far ahead of his time. He was even ahead of much current\nphilosophy of mathematics, especially with his sensitivity to both\nsides. This is not to say that his position is without problems.\nDedekind himself was troubled by the set-theoretic antinomies,\nespecially initially. And the twentieth century produced additional\nsurprises, such as G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems, that \nare difficult to accommodate for everyone. Moreover, the methodology of\nmathematics has developed further since his time, including attempts\nto reconcile and integrate \u201cconceptual\u201d and\n\u201ccomputational\u201d thinking, e.g., \nin computer-assisted\nproofs. Then again, is there a philosophical position available today\nthat answers all important questions about mathematics in a\nsatisfactory way? If not, updating and reviving a Dedekindian position\nmay be a worthwhile project.\n",
