    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions about Genetics || What Is the Relationship between Classical Genetics and Molecular Genetics?\n2.1 What Is the Relationship between Classical Genetics and Molecular Genetics?\n\nPhilosophy of science, throughout the early- and mid-twentieth\ncentury, was predominated by attention to examples, problems, and\nconcepts from physics. Not surprisingly, the philosophical insights\nproduced a vision of how science worked that was modeled on physics.\nScientific explanations, as one example, arose from the derivation of\nphenomena from physical laws of nature; rainbows are explained by\nreference to the laws of reflection and refraction, alongside the\nposition of the sun, the position of raindrops, and the position of\nthe person seeing the rainbow. Scientific progress, as another\nexample, proceeded by way of higher-level sciences reducing to\nlower-level sciences; thermodynamics (with its concepts of temperature\nand pressure), the thought went, was reduced to statistical mechanics\n(with its concepts of mean kinetic energy and force) (entries:\n scientific reduction;\n intertheory relations in physics;\n scientific progress;\n laws of nature;\n the structure of scientific theories).\n\nIn the 1960s, philosophers of science started turning their attention\nto biology in order to see how the philosophical insights applied\nthere. The earliest, influential example of this was Kenneth\nSchaffner\u2019s proposal for classical, Mendelian genetics reducing\nto molecular genetics (Schaffner 1969). The great successes of\nmolecular biology following Watson and Crick\u2019s discovery of the\ndouble-helical structure of DNA can be best understood, Schaffner\nargued, by recognizing how classical genetics was in the process of\nbeing reduced to the biochemical processes investigated by molecular\nbiologists. On this reading, the \u201cgene\u201d from classical\ngenetics was reduced to a sequence of amino acids in DNA, and other\nconcepts from classical genetics like \u201cdominance\u201d were\nlikewise being reconfigured in the language of biochemistry (entry:\n reductionism in biology).\n\nSchaffner\u2019s case for reduction in genetics invited philosophers\nto take a hard look at the theories and practices of biologists. A\nvariety of challenges to Schaffner\u2019s thesis ensued. David Hull\n(1974) claimed that there was no neat connection between classical\ngenetics\u2019 gene concept and molecular genetics\u2019 DNA\nsequence because there was no neat, one-to-one mapping between\nstretches of DNA and the traits that the classical geneticists\ninvestigated; instead, Hull thought it better to characterize\nmolecular genetics as having replaced classical genetics. Philip\nKitcher (1984) agreed with Hull that reduction was the wrong way to\nunderstand the relationship; however, he offered a different\nformulation of the correct way. Kitcher said it was best to understand\nclassical genetics and molecular genetics as operating on different,\nautonomous levels; classical geneticists investigated the transmission\nof traits by studying the cytological mechanisms of chromosomal\naction, while molecular geneticists investigated things like gene\nreplication and mutation by studying the molecular mechanisms of\nprotein synthesis (entries:\n molecular genetics;\n the unity of science).\n\nThe debate over the relationship between classical genetics and\nmolecular genetics didn\u2019t so much resolve itself as it did\nevolve into a series of new philosophical questions. That is, as\nphilosophers were working through the details of genetics to assess\nthe relationship between the older version and the newer one, they\nencountered a series of questions that demanded consideration: What\nexactly is a \u201cgene\u201d? And what do genes actually do?\nPhilosophers continued to consider the reduction question (for\nexamples of subsequent defenders of reduction, see Waters 1990;\nSchaffner 1993). But these other questions took on a life of their own\nand became legitimate targets of inquiry independent of the reduction\ndebate. Philosophy of biology professionally emerged as a unique\nsub-discipline of philosophy of science in the 1970s and 1980s as this\nunfolded (entry:\n philosophy of biology).\n",
