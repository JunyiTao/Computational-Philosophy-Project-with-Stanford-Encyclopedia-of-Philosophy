For\nexample:\n\n#We saw Zoe down in the dumps and her therapist did\ntoo.\n#Life and the 401 are highways.\n\n\nThe metaphors aren\u2019t very good and (68) and (69) are clearly\nzeugmatic. Given how many parts of speech can be used metaphorically,\nslavish obedience to the test would postulate massive and\nunconstrained ambiguity in natural language. (See Camp 2006) The\nnatural answer is to restrict the use of the test to cases in which\nthe words are used literally; but of course the tests are supposed to\nhelp us decide when we have literal, semantic difference and when we\ndon\u2019t. To add to the complication, metaphors that are used in\nsimilar manners over time tend to become \u2018dead\u2019\nmetaphors \u2013 literally ambiguities that took a causal path through\nmetaphor. \u2018Deadline\u2019 is a pretty clear case of a metaphor\nthat has died. Since the passing of the non-literal into the\nstandardized literal is not exactly a transition whose time of\noccurrence is obvious, it will be difficult in some cases to tell what\nhas been lexicalized as a different meaning and what has not (think,\nagain, of \u2018deadline\u2019 as a case, which once meant a line\nthe crossing of which would result in your death. Think of that next\ntime you are late with a paper\u2026) \n",
