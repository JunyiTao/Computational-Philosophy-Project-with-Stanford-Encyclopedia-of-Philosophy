Definition(s)\n\nFew things in biology have been more extensively discussed than the\ndefinition of life. It is frustrating so little progress has been made\non the topic in the face of so much research, theory, and\ndebate. There are many reasons for this failure: disagreements about\nhow abstract or specific definitions should be, different commitments\nas to what ought to be included in a definition, and even disagreement\nabout the nature of definitions themselves. This section covers the\nnature and role of definitions. Each of these has been used in approaching\nthe question of life.\nHistorically, when philosophers and scientists define a concept,\nthe aim is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions. These\ntheoretical definitions (also\ncalled real, ideal or philosophical\ndefinitions) are often impractical or fragile as they can be\nchallenged with a single imagined counterexample. A classic case is\nthe definition of \u201cbachelors\u201d as \u201cunmarried\nmales.\u201d It is trivial to find examples that fit this definition\nwithout intuitively being bachelors: male dogs, baby boys, widowers,\netc. Similarly, for any definition of life, one can either show living\ncases that are left out of the definition or non-living cases that are\nincluded by it. Life is organized, but so are geological\nformations. Life processes energy, but so does fire. Life evolves\nusing complex biochemistry, but so do prions. Life is self-sustaining,\nbut parasites are not. Life is at thermodynamic disequilibrium, but so\nis much else. As we\u2019ll see shortly, perhaps theoretical\ndefinitions are too rigid a standard. The real world is far too\ncomplex for limited criteria to decide every marginal case.\nNon-philosophers are typically quite frustrated by the\nback-and-forth that results from theoretical definitions. To that end,\nsome favor operational (or working) definitions,\nones that work in practice to narrow down the range of phenomena under\nconsideration.  This approach is often not considered a kind of\ndefinition by philosophers (see Gupta 2021). Operational definitions\ntend to be philosophically shallow. For example, NASA\u2019s\noperational definition of life as \u201ca self-sustaining chemical\nsystem capable of Darwinian evolution\u201d (Joyce 1994) might\ninclude viruses while excluding mules. The lack of depth of an\noperational definition can frustrate theoretically minded people,\nincluding other scientists.\nThere are several other conceptions of definition, as well. The\nnominal (also lexicographer or dictionary)\ndefinition is determined by analyzing usage. It will not work for\ncutting edge or controversial issues because such definitions follow\nthe slow process of cultural acceptance rather than provide guidance\nto researchers at the forefront of these debates. Scholars are more\nlikely to quote a dictionary definition than be illuminated by\none.\nThere are also demonstrative or ostensive\ndefinitions, which are concepts we can convey by mere shared\nobservations: \u201cthat is red\u201d while pointing at a red\nobject, for instance. Potter Stewart famously defined pornography in\nthis manner by saying \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d (Stewart\n1964). Knowledge by ostension may reflect epistemic access to a\nnatural kind, although this may feel indistinguishable from an\ninternalized cultural category. There is huge variation among what\nscientists consider \u2018life,\u2019 even among objects on Earth,\nlike viruses and prions, which suggests this kind of definition is not\nviable for this target.\nThen there are stipulative definitions, which are terms introduced\nand defined by fiat. A circle in Euclidean geometry can be defined as a\nround plane figure whose boundary consists of infinite points\nequidistant to a single other point. There are no possible\ncounterexamples to this definition, given the axioms of Euclidean\ngeometry. This approach provides little refuge in the real world.\nConsider an attempt to define swans as \u201cwhite birds with long\nnecks.\u201d By stipulation, storks, great egrets, and many cranes\nwould be swans, while Australia\u2019s black swans would not. Such a\nquick and dirty definition seems to define the category out of hand and\nperhaps only works within accepted axioms or theories. Life could be\nstipulated as \u201ccarbon-based reproducing entities,\u201d which\nwould rule out silicon-based life by fiat. Such a definition merely\npushes the debate to the scenarios in which the stipulated definition\ngoes against intuitive notions.\nThe 20th century saw some steps away from definitions toward\nalternative views of concepts,\nnotably prototypes, exemplars, and\ntheories (Machery 2009). Prototype concepts are\nabstract features shared by most, but not all members of a category\n(Rosch & Mervis 1975; Rosch 1978; Hampton 1979, 2006; Smith\n2002). The definitions of life in biology textbooks might be\ncharitably understood as prototype concepts.  So, too, are the\nproperty cluster natural kinds popular in philosophy of biology (Boyd\n1991, 1999, 2010; Diguez 2013; Slater 2015). Exemplars are\nconcepts built around similarity to a particular individual case\n(Medin & Schaffer 1978, Nosofsky 1986). Both prototypes and\nexemplar concepts rely on similarity to paradigmatic cases, with the\nformer being an imagined ideal and the latter being a real instance\n(Komatsu 1992). For similarity-based concepts to work in scientific\ncases such as life, we need an account of which similarities matter,\nhow much, and why. In contrast to similarity-based concepts, the\nrequirements of theory concepts are somewhat more\nnebulous. Theory concepts are modeled on scientific theories\nand thus reflect their diversity (Carey 1985, Murphy & Medin 1985,\nGopnik & Meltzoff 1997). At the core, theory concepts rely on\nexplanations for why the members of a category share certain\nproperties. Marginal cases of life, such as viruses, prions, or\nprotocells, might be included in some theories of life but not\nothers.\nIn sum, there are many potential approaches to definitions, each\nwith different benefits, drawbacks, and standards of success. Much more\ncould be said about these and other possible approaches, but this will\nsuffice for our purposes. Some of the disagreements about defining life\ndissolve upon clarifying which type of definition or concept is being\nused. Many of the explicit attempts to define life have focused on\neither operational and philosophical definitions, while often not\nacknowledging or misunderstanding the distinction between these. One\nwill note these two definitions are at cross-purposes \u2013\noperational definitions can be quick and dirty, but philosophical\ndefinitions seek to give necessary and sufficient conditions. Less work\nhas been done on life as a non-definitional concept, although that is\nperhaps changing.\n1.1 Definitions of Life from Antiquity to Darwin\n\n\nThis subsection briefly explores historical definitions of life. There\nare more in depth treatments of the matter, to which an interested\nreader should turn (Bedau & Cleland 2010, Riskin 2015, Mix 2018).\nApproaches to this issue vary widely across historians, philosophers,\nand scientists, so some skepticism about any individual author\u2019s\napproach to the topic is warranted.\nWe begin with the Greeks. In several dialogues, notably the\nPhaedrus, Timeaus, and Republic, Plato\ndivided life into three parts: vegetable life, animal life, and\nrational life. All living creatures possessed the first in the form of\nnutrition and reproduction, animals were additionally capable of\nsensation and locomotion, and humans also had rational souls.\nPlato\u2019s subsequent influence in Christian theology may be\napparent in spirit if not in detail. In Christian theology, human life\nwas not only rational, but also involved an eternal, spiritual soul and\nan internal, conscious life.\nPlato\u2019s student, Aristotle, had a different notion in which\nliving things had an appropriate form, material, and goal-directedness\n(De Anima, 412a1\u2013416b). Aristotle held life to be a\nform of self-motion, perpetuation, or self-alteration (Byers 2006). For\nAristotle, the capacity to resist internal and external perturbations\nwas the essential distinction between living beings and non-living\nobjects. Other features were accidental. This quest for demarcating the\nessential from the accidental for life has persisted to this day in\nsearches for theoretical definitions of life as well as in attacks\nagainst those not interested in such definitions.\nCenturies later, Descartes drew a sharper distinction between animal\nlife and rational life than between inanimate objects and animal life.\nThis was a turn away from medieval approaches, which had taken the gap\nbetween vegetables and animals to be broader. For Descartes, animals\nare analogous to complex clocks and lack the inner or spiritual life\ncentral to the human experience (Descartes 2010/1664). As such,\nDescartes\u2019 category of life neither mapped onto Greek conceptions\nnor current conceptual frameworks. The mechanistic view developed by\nDescartes and his followers is often thought to be continuous with\ncurrent scientific thinking, but this is perhaps anachronistic, as much\nof the theoretical underpinning separating animal life and rational\nlife is no longer accepted.\n The responses to Descartes came to be grouped under the\nheading \u2018vitalism.\u2019 Vitalism, which spanned three\ncenturies, was a heterogenous philosophical position unified by\nadherents\u2019 doubt of a fully mechanistic view of life. Vitalists\nhad ontologies of defining features of life as varied as immaterial\ncauses, particular arrangements of matter, a special life fluid, a\nparticular end goal, or even mental forces. A whiggish history of\nbiology will declare the death of vitalism with Friedrich\nW\u00f6hler\u2019s synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate. The\nsuggestion is that if biological chemicals can be produced from mere\nchemistry, then biology is also mere chemistry. Although this was an\nimportant step, many chemists already had accepted a mechanistic world\nview, and many other researchers continued to develop vitalist theories\nwell into the 20th century (Bergson 1959, Driesch 1905/1914).\n1.2 Contemporary Definitions of Life\n\n\nThe 20th century largely saw the mechanist/vitalist divide\ndissipate. Despite the difficulties described above about definitions,\nhundreds of scientists, philosophers, and others have tried their hand\nat defining life. Much of the interest is motivated by new science and\nnew technologies \u2013 including artificial life, synthetic biology,\norigins of life, and astrobiology \u2013 which complicate the issue\nby violating some of the traditional groupings of properties\nassociated with life. There are numerous books, articles, and\nworkshops on the nature of life (P\u00e1lyi et al. 2002, Popa 2004,\nBedau & Cleland 2010).\n\n\n\n\nPopa\u00a02004\nTrifonov\u00a02011\nMalaterre\u00a0& Chartier\u00a02019\n\nMatter & Energy\n\nMechanistic: pragmatic interpretations that see life\nas a complex machine, including thermodynamic approaches\nEnergy: relating to terms like force\n\n\nMaterial-Related: those based on biochemistry and other\nfeature of life on Earth\nMatter: relating to terms like\norganic, material, and molecules\n1.\u00a0Matter/Energy, including the categories:\n\n\nHolistic Definitions: function- and purpose-related\ndescriptions that treat life as a collective property\nSystem: relating to terms: systems,\norganization, organism, order, network, etc.\n1a.

Some recent attempts at meta-categories\nfor life definitions. Each column is one account\u2019s categories,\nthe rows are lined up according to rough similarity.\n\n There are perhaps thousands of competing definitions proposed\nacross hundreds of articles. A true survey of that variety would be\nbeyond the scope of this article and beyond your patience as a reader.\nNevertheless, some broad categories have been proposed that might\noffer some insight into current contending definitions. Table 1\nsummarizes three of the most rigorous attempts this century to\ncategorize definitions of life.\n\nEach of these authors used different approaches to arrive at their\ncategories. Popa 2004 and Trifonov 2011 attempted to reverse engineer\nthe categories from dozens of definitions collected from many dozens of\nexperts, while Malaterre and Chartier 2019 conducted a more extensive,\ntext-mining approach across 30,000 scientific articles selected from\njournals that published pieces in biology. As one can see, there are\nareas of rough overlap, but each categorization scheme has its own\nunique categories as well.\nMost of the definitions considered by these authors straddle some of\nthese distinctions and are often ambiguous as to whether they are\nintended to be theoretical definitions, operational definitions, or\nsomething else. For example, Popa 2004 considers definitions ranging\nfrom Oparin 1961\u2019s \u201cAny system capable of replication and\nmutation is alive\u201d to Schulze-Makuch et al. 2002:\n\nWe propose to define living systems as those that are: (1)\ncomposed of bounded micro-environments in thermodynamic equilibrium\nwith their surroundings; (2) capable of transforming energy to maintain\ntheir low-entropy states; and (3) able to replicate structurally\ndistinct copies of themselves from an instructional code perpetuated\nindefinitely through time despite the demise of the individual carrier\nthrough which it is transmitted. \nCategorizing definitions such as these\nnecessarily requires some choices and reasonable people can disagree\nabout whether each belongs in one or more categories.\nThe takeaway from current understandings of the definition of life\nis that there is no consensus forthcoming in the near future. One concern is that these are summaries of attempts to define a category for which there is only loose agreement.\nMany scientists disagree as to the phenomena a definition of life is\nintended to unify. Some scientists would include prions, viruses, and\nentities only hypothesized to exist in the origin of life, while others\nwould completely reject them. Some might accept digital organisms as\nalive, others would deny this approach. Conceptual equivocation could\nhave significant costs for research. One field recently quantified this\ncost, suggesting it is more than a merely theoretical concern (Trombley\nand Cottenie 2019). Given the diversity described above, one may be\ntempted to adopt a definitional pluralism: there are many ways to be\nalive. For some reason, that approach is not common in the\nliterature.\n2. Definitional Skepticism\n\nNearly everybody agrees there is a distinction between life and\nnon-life, typically understood as a difference in kind rather than one\nof degree. Furthermore, most people involved accept that life is some\nsort of natural kind, rather than a human psychological concept. That\nsaid, a common theme in recent philosophical work has been to express\nskepticism of life definitions as a goal. The literature on the\ndefinition of life is vast, repetitive, and utterly inconclusive.\nPhilosophers have disagreed as to the ultimate source of the lack of\nconsensus, citing unstated assumptions in either the definer\u2019s\napproach or the question itself. Note that many scientists are less\nlikely to be skeptical of the goal of defining life, though also more\nresistant to engaging in the philosophical debate.\nOne skeptical view has arisen from the observation that theoretical\ndefinitions of life presume a theory of life (Cleland and Chyba 2002,\nBenner 2010, Cleland 2019). Although it is not obvious that the authors\nallude to the theory-theory of concepts, described in section 1, a\ncommon analogy is to early chemical theory. According to this analogy,\nearly alchemists likened the alchemists\u2019 Aqua regia\n(\u201croyal water\u201d) and Aqua fortis (\u201cstrong\nwater\u201d). Development of atomic theory revealed, Cleland argues,\nthat the true nature of water was H2O, while the other\n\u2018waters\u2019 were  HNO3 + 3 HCl and\nHNO3, respectively. Cleland advocates avoiding definitions altogether,\nfearing they will blind us to new instances of life, and instead opts\nfor tentative criteria, which she believes avoid the implicit dogma of\neven operational definitions.\nOther authors have pointed out that the explanandum of life is\nitself up for debate (Tsokolov 2009, Mix 2020, Parke 2020). According\nto Emily Parke, some accept life as applying to individuals, whereas\nother definitions apply to collectives first (including entire planets)\nand individuals derivatively. Relatedly, most believe life is some kind\nof entity rather than some kind of relation or process (but see\nNicholson and Dupr\u00e9 2018). Parke also points out that some\ndefinitions seek a material basis, perhaps limiting life\u2019s\nsubstrate to the biochemistry we know on Earth, while others are\nfunctional. Sagan famously worried about biochemical definitions\nbecause they were prone to \u2018Earth Chauvinism\u2019 for\nprivileging our own biochemistry (1970). Other authors take our\nbiochemistry to be independently justified as universal (Pace 2001,\nBenner et al. 2004, but see Bains 2004). Finally, Parke distinguishes\nbetween those that seek clean boundaries and those that accept the\npossibility of a continuum of \u2018lifelikeness.\u2019\nOther authors have advocated a kind of quietism about definitions,\nmaintaining that folk concepts need not match up with scientific ones\n(Machery 2011), any definitions would not change scientific practice\n(Szostak 2012), advocated a radical conceptual rethinking (Mariscal\n& Doolittle 2020), or denied the distinction between life & non-life entirely (Jabr 2013).\nThis last position of eliminativism could be expanded as it helps\nillustrate all other life skeptical positions. Cowie 2009 classifies\neliminativist goals as either linguistic or ontological. Ontological\neliminativists don\u2019t believe the objects they are eliminating\ntruly exist. We\u2019re all eliminativists about something, perhaps\nghosts or fairies. Linguistic/conceptual eliminativists, on the other\nhand are merely suspicious of theoretical terms or concepts, what\nRamsey 2020 calls \u2018category dissolution\u2019 or \u2018conceptual fragmentation.\u2019 In essence, it\u2019s not that\nthere aren\u2019t living things, it\u2019s just that the category life is heterogeneous rather than a natural kind. According to Cowie, one can deny that anything matching our theoretical definition of life\nactually exists in the world while still accepting it as a useful fiction. Conversely, one may think scientific theories about life are fruitless or that the term is too vague and confused to be useful, without doubting life exists. If we accept any of these\nalternatives, we should perhaps avoid ever using the term\n\u2018life\u2019 in isolation and instead reference Metabolic Life and Evolutionary Life and all the other conceptions.\n At play in these various forms of skepticism are several\nunderlying assumptions. Among other disagreements, researchers disagree\nabout what life is, whether it is a natural kind with an essence or a\nhuman construct; they disagree as to the purpose of defining life,\nespecially if it will not change scientific practice; and they disagree\nas to the features of life that are relevant and the ones that are mere\nconsequences. When researchers hold unstated assumptions such as these,\nthey are liable to mistake the source of their disagreement.\n3. Artificial and Synthetic Life\n\n\nThe rest of this article will focus on uses of the various life\nconcepts. Some of the definitions described above are derived from, or\nnecessary for, specific scientific and societal purposes. This section\nfocuses on artificial and synthetic life.\nIn principle, most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe\nlife can be created, but there is broad disagreement as to what needs\nto be recreated for something to be life. In functional approaches,\nmere formal organization sufficiently similar to organisms may be\nenough. Complexly configured robots (\u201chardware\u201d) or computer programs (\u201csoftware\u201d) might qualify. This view is known as Strong Artificial Life (A-Life for short) and has received much of the same pushback as the Strong Artificial Intelligence\napproach before it (Sober 1991, Boden 1999, Brooks 2001). Those who\nreject the Strong A-Life view believe that functional approaches miss\nsome of the essential features of biology for either epistemic or\nontological reasons. Epistemic objections might be consistent with the\npossibility of Strong A-Life, but doubt that we have the knowledge to\nrecreate the relevant biological functions in a digital framework.\nConversely, most of the objections to Strong A-Life have been\nontological, resting on the view that representations cannot be\nequivalent to that which they represent and that perhaps life requires chemical embodiment, ruling Strong A-Life impossible by fiat.\nWeak A-Life approaches, on the other hand, don\u2019t presume the\nontological equivalence of structurally similar circuits and cells.\nInstead, proponents suggest the more modest goal of developing a deeper\nunderstanding of life as we know it by exploring the effects of various\nparameters in simulations, effectively placing life in a broader\ncontext of possible biology (Langton 1989, 1995). For example, in the\nTerra program, software was pitted against other software for\nprocessing power (Ray 1993). Unexpected by the researchers at the time,\nsoftware parasitism evolved: software would co-opt the reproductive\nprocessing of other software. Policing mechanisms also evolved, leading\nto an arms race between free-riders and the software trying to stop\nthem.\nWhether one accepts the strong or weak interpretation of A-Life,\nthese in silico approaches are cheaper than equivalent work done in\nreal organisms. They also offer possibilities that are not available in\nordinary biology, such as programming alternative parameters to take\nthe place of laws of nature and exploring relationships across deep\ntime and space quickly and efficiently.\nAnother approach worth highlighting is that of synthetic life\n(\u201cwetware\u201d). Less conceptually troubled, synthetic life can\nalso address some questions of A-Life, while allowing for a finer grain\nof realism. Synthetic life approaches have explored creating\nself-replication (Lincoln & Joyce 2009), minimal genomes (Koonin\n2000, Hutchinson et al. 2016), a chemical evolution (Gromski et al.\n2020), and other projects. Not all synthetic biology is in the business\nof investigating life as it could be, as not all computer programming\nis A-Life. Nevertheless, the tools developed by both can be\nilluminating. By exploring possibilities, scientists can discover\npreviously hidden relationships, revealing which aspects of life are\nmore or less plausible than expected.\n4. Origin(s) of Life\n\n\nInextricable from the question of life\u2019s nature is the\nquestion of its origin. Ancient and modern thinkers accepted that life\noften arose spontaneously from non-life. Two centuries of experiments\neventually overturned this widely accepted view, culminating in Louis\nPasteur\u2019s swan-neck bottle experiments. Since then, the puzzle of\nLife\u2019s origin has been one of the biggest and most important in\nall of science.\nDarwin was famously silent about the problem, although in a letter\nto his friend Joseph Hooker, Darwin confided that he imagined life\noriginating in \u201csome warm little pond\u201d (see \nOther Internet Resources below; and  Peret\u00f3 et al. 2009).\nSubsequent work on the subject was sparse until the 1920s when\nAlexander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane independently proposed hypotheses\nfor life\u2019s origin in then plausible early Earth conditions\n(Haldane 1929; Oparin 2010/1936). As a graduate student in the 1950s,\nStanley Miller tested the proposal, discovering dozens of amino acids\nin the mixture (1953). Since then, the field of origins-of-life studies\nhas expanded dramatically.\nOur earliest reliable records of this planet, some 3.5 billion years\nago, contain distinctive evidence of microbial fossils, including\ndistinctive shapes that correlate to the sizes and shapes of current\nprokaryotes, as well as carbon-ratios distinctive to life as we know it\n(Schopf 1993, Schopf et al. 2017). Many analyses have pushed our\nconfidence in life\u2019s earlier origin significantly further back,\nsuggesting that basically as soon as Earth was not molten, it was\nfilled with life (Pearce et al. 2018, Lineweaver 2020). How life\nstarted and why it started so quickly remains one of the most pressing\nopen questions in science.\nThere are many open philosophical issues in origins of life\nresearch. Several of these are centered around the explanandum in\nquestion and epistemological limits to our knowledge. Researchers\ndiffer, for example, as to whether the purpose of origins-of-life\nresearch is to discover how life could have originated or how it did\noriginate (Scharf et al. 2015, Mariscal et al. 2019). Some steps in the\nprocess could have been chancy, others could have been deterministic\nbut highly contingent, still others could have been the only way life\never originates anywhere in the Universe.\nThere are several broad approaches to investigating the origin of\nlife. \u201cBottom-Up\u201d approaches begin with pre-biotic chemistry and explore how it could withstand stressors in order\nfor lifelike entities to form and evolve. At present, there are many\nunsolved problems, most notably that most energetically favorable interactions would\nconsume the proto-life forms involved. Scientists have cleverly\nattempted to ease the problem by relaxing assumptions: perhaps the\nenvironment provided our first boundaries (Koonin 2009), or perhaps it\nprovided porto-genetic material (Mathis et al. 2017), all of this could\nhave occurred in a viscous solvent instead of a cell (He et al. 2017),\nor on a surface (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user 1988), or using a variety of\nentities that eventually became encapsulated (Eigen & Schuster\n1977). Nevertheless, the gulf between the pre-biotic chemistry and the\nsimplest life forms is still huge and any number of explanations only\naccount for a tiny portion of the conceptual distance.\nAnother approach, \u201cTop-Down,\u201d uses current taxa to infer\nthe nature and timing of the origin of life on Earth. To do so, we take\ncurrent examples of life on Earth and trace their ancestry, by\ncomparing the nearly hundred shared genes, primarily associated with\nbiological translation (Koonin 2011). All life shares a last universal\ncommon ancestor, \u201cLUCA\u201d for short. There may have been\nseveral origins of life, but our evidence is insufficient to\ndistinguish this scenario from a single origin. Nevertheless, at least\none origin, presumably in Earthly pre-biotic conditions, led to the\nexistence of LUCA, an important constraint upon theorizing about the\norigin of life. It is widely expected that LUCA was merely one creature\nin a larger population and existed long after the origin of the first\norganism. There are also a variety of concerns with respect to LUCA:\nwhether it was simple or complex (Mariscal & Doolittle 2015);\nwhether it had a membrane that resembled any of the current membranes\n(Koonin 2011); whether the genes it contained were ancestors of our own\ngenes or subsequently acquired (Doolittle & Brown 1994, Woese &\nFox 1977; Woese 1998); whether its genome was made of DNA (Forterre\n2006a), whether it was a heterotroph or autotroph; where it lived; and\nwhen it lived.\nThe gap between Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches is huge: untold\ngenerations passed between pre-biotic chemistry and LUCA. We may never\nbe able to solve Life\u2019s origin, but each step brings us closer to\nunderstanding the trajectory.\n5. Search For Life\n\n\nEven the most pessimistic analyses of the likelihood of life\nsuggests life on Earth is not unique (Frank & Sullivan 2016). Many\nscientists take that as a good reason to search for life elsewhere in\nthe Universe. The current search for life elsewhere focuses on two\nextremes: the chemical byproducts of life and the technological signals\nof intelligent life. The social interactions of alien populations might\nbe interesting, but they are hard to study as of yet. Thus, we search\nfor biosignatures that might uniquely identify life from a great\ndistance. We\u2019ll take each in turn.\nBiosignatures, as the name implies, are purported to be markers of\nlife. Chemical biosignatures are compounds either rarely or never\nproduced without the assistance of life on Earth. Finding biosignatures\nthus implies a material conception of life, likely in the form of\nbiochemistry, metabolism, or thermodynamics. There have been many\nattempts to detect biosignatures, primarily on Mars. These approaches\ninclude experiments done on planetary surfaces, observations from Earth\nor low-earth orbit, and study of meteors and other debris from nearby\nplanetary bodies.\nMore practically, satellite or telescope observations of other\nplanets have been used to search for gasses outside of thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Methane has been sporadically detected on Mars since 2004\n(Formisano et al. 2004, Webster et al. 2018) with an accompanying claim\nof formaldehyde detection (Peplow 2005). Venus has also been a source\nof attention, with phosphine gas detected in the clouds above Venus\n(Greaves et al. 2020). A controversial finding, it nevertheless caught\nthe scientific imagination. Future scientific research is expected to\naccelerate this method of observation, especially with new data gathered by the new\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With its equipment, JWST is able to image exoplanets at  resolutions allowing the detection of gas biomarkers in the atmospheres of exoplanets (Loeb & Maoz 2013).\nBy contrast, there have been scarce attempts to detect\nchemical life while on the surface of another planet. In 1975, NASA\nsent the Viking landers to Mars, tasked with a variety of scientific\nexperiments including some that were purported to detect life if it was\npresent. One, the Labeled Release Experiment, did, but its results were\ninconsistent with the other on-board experiments, so the result was\ndeemed inconclusive (Levin & Straat 1976, Ezell & Ezell 1984).\nThe current Perseverence rover on Mars is able to assess\ncertain biosignatures and upcoming missions by NASA, the Chinese\nNational Space Administration, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration\nAgency all seek to determine whether Mars has evidence of past or\ncurrent life.\nIt is not obvious that life on Mars would be a separate origin than\nlife on Earth, as the two planets exchange tons of rocks each year and\nit is at least theoretically possible that life could have formed on\none planet and been subsequently transferred to the other (McKay 2010).\nSince Mars is a smaller body than Earth, it coalesced before Earth and\nthus it is conceivable that life might have formed there first,\nalthough this is a relatively marginal view in the astrobiology\ncommunity. Meteorites from Mars and other planetary bodies have\nalso been the source of purported biosignatures. The Martian meteorite\nALH84001 was instrumental in forming the science of astrobiology in\n1996, after NASA scientists discovered bacteria-like structures (McKay\net al. 1996). Subsequent meteorites have also garnered scientific\ninterest (e.g. White et al. 2014).\nThe other major attempt to search for life, that of searching for\nintelligence, more readily captures the imagination. The search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has been ongoing for centuries\n(Dick  1982). Fierce debates between those that took Earth to be\nunique and those that took it to be one of a plurality of worlds\npersisted for millennia (and still do, to some extent). Advocates of\nthe plurality of worlds view searched their telescopes for evidence. A\nfamous instance is Percival Lowell\u2019s drawings of Martian canals\nin the 1890s. Influenced by the mid-1800s observations of what appeared\nto be channels criss-crossing Mars, Lowell drew a series of canals\nbased on his observations. Science fiction soon picked up the\nobservation and conjectured a dying civilization, hoping to squeeze\nwater out of the last bits of remaining ice in the Martian poles.\nPartially driven by the science fiction following Lowell\u2019s\ndrawings, the early 20th century saw increased interest in detecting\nradio signals from Outer Space. This interest accelerated after the\nlaunch of Sputnik in 1957 and was more systematically and formally\napproached starting in the late 1970s. SETI research has not been\npublicly funded since 1994, but private and public donors, as well as\nacademic and lay researchers have kept the program going since. There\nare many technical challenges to the search: space is unimaginably\nhuge, signals are weak, possibilities of interstellar communication are\nmyriad, and our searches can only cover an insignificant portion of the\ntask.\nMore controversially, many dozens of messages have been sent into\nOuter Space since 1974. A few have been in the form of physical objects\naboard spacecraft, but most have been radio signals aimed at promising\nstars or star clusters. sometimes called Active SETI or METI (Messaging\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence). Although the practice continues due to\nits low cost and relative ease, many philosophers, scientists, and\npolicy experts have come out against the practice largely due to the\nrisk of broadcasting our presence to potentially hostile forces on\nbehalf of future generations that cannot consent (Smith 2020).\n6. The Macro and the Micro Perspectives\n\n\nScientists grow more concerned about philosophical questions when\nscientific limitations or conceptual choices are made apparent to them.\nThose scientists who study deep time, deep space, abstract issues, or\nquestions of ethics are often keenly aware of the philosophical choices\nthat influence their research from identification of research question\nto interpretation of the data. This section briefly goes through\nother scientific contexts in which how life is defined is relevant,\nwhich address scales well below and well above the organism level.\nThere are several biological entities for which it is an open\nquestion as to whether they are alive. Viruses, for example, are units\nof genetic material encased in a protein coat. It is unknown whether all\nviruses share common ancestor (Koonin et al. 2006, Moreira and\nL\u00f3pez Garcia 2009) nor how they originated, be it escaped\ntransposable elements, reduced cells, or some ancestral third option\n(Forterre 2006b). The status of viruses as living is mired with controversy, with some people holding virons to be alive, others\nbelieving them not to be, and a third camp has them as living only in\nthe context of an infected cell, but a mere \u2018seed\u2019\notherwise (Forterre 2010).\nThere are other entities in the \u201ctwilight zone of\nmicrobiology,\u201d including transposable elements, viroids,\nunculturable (but putatively existing) microbes, organisms in\nvegetative states, and prions (Postgate 1999). The problems facing each\nof these are similar: several of them can evolve by natural selection,\nare biochemically complex, but lack other properties associated with\nlife. For example, prions are protein products of life that can fold\nother prions in a way that allows for cumulative evolution (Li et al.\n2010). They are rarely included in the category \u2018life\u2019 due\nto their inactivity in most settings and rather simple origin as a\nmisfold of a functional protein.\nIf there is a twilight zone of microbiology, there is also a\ntwilight zone of ecology. Organisms form populations, species,\nlineages, clades, and ecosystems. The status of each of these is an\nopen question, but they have many of the same features associated with\nlife as described above. Perhaps the strongest case can be made for\neusocial insects, such as some ants, bees, wasps, and termites. In\nseveral species, there are rigid distinctions between the castes that\nreproduce and those that do not, with many of the latter serving the\nrole of caring for the young (H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson 2009). One\nmight note that entities above the organism level are as a rule less\nintegrated and connected than the organisms that comprise them. This is\nperhaps a general feature of life: from the perspective of every item\nin the biological hierarchy, its parts are much more homogenous than it\nis. Our cells seem much more integrated and self-contained than our\nbodies, so, too, are individual insects more self-contained than the\ncolonies to which they belong.\nMost controversial has been the case of Gaia. Gaia is a term from\nGreek mythology; she is a personification of the planet Earth. In 1979,\nJames Lovelock, revived the concept in his book, Gaia: A New Look\nat Life on Earth. In his view, the Earth-wide set of interlocking\necosystems could be viewed as a single entity. One insight of\nLovelock\u2019s was already mentioned in the previous section:\nplanet-wide interactions are the scale that matters in detecting life\nelsewhere. Lovelock\u2019s book sparked controversy centered around\nthe plausibility of his model of the Earth as a self-regulating\nhomeostatic system. In the view of many at the time, it was an\ninaccurate description: Earth could not evolve in principle,  and\nthe subsequent ontological move of granting Earth the status of life\nwas unmotivated (Doolittle 1981). Recent attempts to revitalize the\nnotion of Gaia on a more theoretic footing involve both abiotic and\nbiotic regulatory mechanisms and natural selection acting at the level\nof clades (Lenton et al. 2018, Doolittle 2019). Regardless of current\nattempts at a theoretical justification, the thought of Earth as a\nliving entity motivated many in the environmental movement and the idea\nremains a common reference.\n7. Ethics, Law, and Politics\n\n\nThe term \u2018life\u2019 is important outside of biology. Often,\nthe focus is not on the concept of life or life in general, but on the\nstatus of individual living entities. Typically, the focus is on the\nbeginning and end stages of individual lives, which raises legal,\nreligious, and moral questions. The start of an individual life\nhas been the source of contraception and abortion discussions \n(Noonan 1967, Dellapenna 1978). Unfortunately, developmental biology\ndoes not provide an uncontroversial starting point for when\n\u2018life\u2019 begins (Maienschein 2014). The end of individual lives was also a heated debate in the 20th century as new technologies were\nable to keep human bodies alive long after they would have died in\nnature (DeGrazia 2016).\nAny discussion of defining life in these contexts should begin by\ndistinguishing between life and other phenomena that are often\nconflated with it in public discourse, such as sentience, personhood,\nand moral considerability. It\u2019s unclear how much ontological,\nepistemic, or moral weight the category of life has independently of\nother properties. Attributing moral worth to non-living entities is\nstill a minority position in environmental or comparative philosophy\n(but see Leopold 1949, Basl 2019). Thus, a starting position might be\nthat life is a prerequisite for moral considerability. Nonetheless,\nmost humans don\u2019t mind killing bacteria for the sake of\ncleanliness and many people eat or wear the flesh of animals. So, in\nmany discussions, life is only valuable when it is the vehicle for\nother equally nebulous properties like sentience, personhood, or\nimmaterial souls.\nIf any living entities have a distinct moral or ontological status,\nmost philosophers would accept that humans are among them (Rolston\n1975, Goodpaster 1978). In these contexts, it matters when individual\nhumans come into being and acquire such a status in their own right, be\nit conception, birth, or some time period in between. Considered\nopinions differ as to when this occurs and in virtue of what, be it\nmere possibility of self-sustained life, sentience, or other features.\nThere is still a rampant pro-life/pro-choice split in cultural\npolitics, which is somewhat lessened in European countries (Corbella\n2020). There are equivalent, but less tendentious analogues in the\ncontexts of euthanasia, the death penalty, war, and the prevention of\ndeath and disease. In these debates, both ethical and metaphysical\ncommitments matter.\nThe public questions of life are often raised by new technologies.\nIn the abortion discussion above, for example, new techniques to end\npregnancies, from birth control to abortion procedures, as well as new\nmedical technologies facilitating premature deliveries made the topic\nmore contentious. Other technological innovations also raise questions\nabout life. One such area is that of transhumanism  (c.f. More and\nVita-More 2013). Transhumanism is the movement aimed toward the use of\ntechnology for the human enhancement of social, psychological, and\nphysical lives. These can range from prosthetics to implants or from\npharmaceuticals to mental \u2018uploading.\u2019 There are\nbioconservatives, who argue against transhumanism for practical, moral,\nor aesthetic reasons. There are also posthumanists, who look forward to\na world in which humans are replaced or eliminated by subsequent\nartificial intelligence. The debate over whether such posthumans might\nbe \u2018alive\u2019 is similar in structure to the artificial life\ndiscussion in section 3. Bioconservatives also argue against this view.\nAmong the topics in these debates are whether a particular technology\ncounts as therapy or enhancement, whether the risks of alteration\noutweigh the benefits, whether certain goals of transhumanism are even\npossible, and which alterations will affect the moral or ontological\nstatus of the people that receive them.\nThat life is a source of ethical, legal, and political controversy\nis to be expected. And although it is beyond the scope of this article\nto adjudicate these debates, advocates ought to be aware of the deep\nvagueness in biology and disagreement within philosophy with respect to\nwhat life is, what an individual living organism is, when individual\nlives begin or end, and what features of life ground moral\nconsiderability.\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nAlthough the conceptual terrain of life concepts is well covered,\nthere is no accepted view as yet. This is unlikely to change given the\ndisciplinary backgrounds, explanatory values, and theoretical\ncommitments of the stakeholders involved. A wide range of practices\nrely on competing conceptions of life: including artificial life,\norigins-of-life research, the search for life, and other projects\ndescribed above.\nFuture scientific discoveries or inventions may break this impasse,\nas they have in other cases of theoretical gridlock. The development of\natomic theory, discussed in section 2, created new categorical\ndivisions that scientists accepted as more real than the categories of\nthe ancients or alchemists. With this conceptual fragmentation, old\ncategories were discarded and new ones accepted. One can imagine\nsomething similar happening in the case of life: many discoveries might show\na clear cluster of how complex, lifelike entities can form from\nprebiotic chemistry, eventually winning over the majority of the\nscientific and philosophical community (e.g. Weber 2007, 2010).\nConversely, a simple decision might be made based on shared values\nor explanatory goals. The example of death may be illustrative. After\ndecades of debate, a new decision, not a discovery, was made.\nPhysicians concluded the irreversibility of death was the most\nimportant property for their purposes. They adopted the concept of\nwhole-brain death as their operational criterion (DeGrazia 2016). The\nfacts on the ground did not change, but the shared understanding\ndid.\nFinally, perhaps life will be accepted as a polysemous concept with\neach definitional cluster applying to a subset of the whole:\nbiochemical life, evolutionary life, metabolic life, etc. Researchers\nmay rely on context, accept some miscommunication, or simply stipulate\nthe kind of life they mean. The example of planets, discussed in Brusse\n2016 may help make this point. There was always a huge diversity within\nthe category planet, which included the Sun and Moon until the\nRenaissance. In the early 1800s, asteroids were discovered. Initially,\nthey were considered planets, they were demoted to \u2018minor\u2019\nplanets a few decades later, then simply \u2018asteroids\u2019 after\nthe 1950s. Pluto was discovered in 1930, recognized as the smallest\nplanet by the 1970s. From 1992 until 2006, many objects similar to\nPluto were discovered until astronomers decided that the term planet\nactually covered at least two distinct, but scientifically interesting\ncategories: typical planets and dwarf planets. Similarly, perhaps some\nof the categories described in section 1.2 will form the basis of\naccepted sub-categories of life.\nIt is still an open question as to how long the current situation\nwill persist before a discovery forces a scientific reckoning or a\ndecision obviates the need. For now, the debate continues.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aristotle, <em>De Anima</em> (selections), in  M.A. Bedau &amp;\nC.E.
