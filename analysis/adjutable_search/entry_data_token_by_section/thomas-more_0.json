Introduction\n\nAccording to Erasmus, the young Thomas More \u201cdevoted himself to\nthe study of Greek literature and philosophy\u201d, and\n\n\n[a]s a youth even worked on a dialogue in which he supported\nPlato\u2019s doctrine of communalism, extending it even to wives. (23\nJuly 1519 letter to Ulrich von Hutten [EW 1372.6\u20137;\n1373.93\u201396])\n\n\nCommenting on the older More, Erasmus described him as having a\n\u201cclearly philosophic character\u201d (late 1532 letter to John\nFaber [EW 1378.56]) and a home that could rightly be called\n\u201canother Platonic academy\u201d but which gave first place to\npiety, Scripture, and the wisest and most saintly Church Fathers (late\n1532 [EW 1380.51] and 22 May <1518> letter to William\nGonell [EW 289\u201390]). It was also a home in which his\ndaughters received the same education as his son (c. September 1521\nletter to Guillaume Bud\u00e9 [EW 1375\u201376]). As the\nMore scholar Elizabeth McCutcheon recently summarized the education of\nMore\u2019s daughters, it was\n\n\nbased on a study of Greek and Latin texts, \u2026 all the liberal\nand humane arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, poetry, mathematics,\nphilosophy, and astronomy) as well as theology and medicine.\n(McCutcheon 2022: 130)\n\n\nBoth Erasmus and Richard Pace described More as a second Democritus,\nthe \u201claughing philosopher\u201d (Curtis 2006b: 91, 94). Pace\nreported about More that \u201c[t]here is no school of philosophy he\ndoesn\u2019t approve of in part\u201d but added that his special\ntalent was for revealing the \u201cridiculous\u201d (Pace:\n105)\u2014a special focus, as we will see, of More\u2019s epigrams.\nFor Socrates, ridiculous people (a common theme of the young More) are\nthose who are mistaken about themselves, those who have not followed\nthe Delphic \u201cknow thyself\u201d prescript (Plato,\nPhilebus 48c). More wrote that his favorite comic dialogue\nwriter, Lucian, used \u201cSocratic irony\u201d (<1506> letter\nto Thomas Ruthall [EW 20.59]), and he praised Lucian for\n\u201cfulfill[ing] the Horatian maxim and combining delight with\ninstruction\u201d while \u201c[r]efraining from the arrogant\npronouncements of the philosophers as well as from the wanton wiles of\nthe poets\u201d (<1506> [EW 20.7\u201311]). Erasmus\nshared More\u2019s admiration for Lucian, who\n\n\nso effectively portrays the manners, emotions, and pursuits of men, as\nif with a painter\u2019s vivid brush, not so much inviting us to read\nabout them as to see them with our own eyes, that \u2026 there is\nnot a comedy, or a satire, that challenges comparison with his\ndialogues. (June 1506 letter to Christopher Urswick [CWE\n2.116.51\u201355])\n\n\nMore studied Greek with the Italian-educated classical scholars\nWilliam Grocyn, Thomas Linacre, and William Lily, and was\n\u201cfaithful to Aristotelian realism\u201d (CW 6: 534; 23\nOctober <1504> letter to John Colet [EW\n270.75\u201378]; 21 October 1515 letter to Martin Dorp [EW\n412.31\u201332]; Barron 2011: 11; McConica 2011: 25\u201326; Curtis\n2011: 72). More presents a \u201cphilosophically sophisticated\u201d\ntreatment of dialectic and language in his \u201cLetter to\nDorp\u201d (Kinney 1981: 180; EW 391\u2013416), where he\nexplains that the meanings of words depend on custom and common usage\n(EW 398, CW 15: 35) and that true dialectics is an\n\u201cintellectual exercise\u201d whose \u201cgoal is the truth and\nnot winning a quarrel\u201d (EW 407.59\u201360,\n67\u201368; CW 15: 75). Nonetheless, in that same letter\nMore shows his characteristic independence of mind by saying that he\nesteems Aristotle \u201cmore than many, but still along with\nmany\u201d (EW 411.80\u201381, SL 52).\n\nHis early biographer Thomas Stapleton remarked that among\n\u201cphilosophers [More] read especially Plato\u201d and that\n\u201cin his own works he imitated Plato\u2019s manner of\nwriting\u201d (1588 [1928: 15]). This imitation has been noted in\nrecent studies of Utopia (Sch\u00f6n 2022; Nelson 2004;\nBaker-Smith 1994; Duncan 1979) but rarely in writings on More\u2019s\nother Socratic dialogues, although his \u201cdialogic\u201d cast of\nmind has long been recognized in various studies (recently: Gardner\nRodgers 2011: 243; also E. McCutcheon 2011: 58\u201359; Renner 2018:\n51, 54\u201362).\n",
