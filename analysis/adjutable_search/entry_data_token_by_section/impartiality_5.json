On the plausible and popular assumption that a\nmoral theory must be deeply impartial, consequentialism meets this\ncriterion with flying colors. And consequentialists have typically\nbeen adept at exploiting this fact with powerful rhetoric\n(Godwin\u2019s famous query, \u2018what magic is there in the\npronoun \u2018my\u2019?\u2019 being a noteworthy example.) On the\nother hand, the impartial demands of consequentialism are so strict\nand so extreme that many critics have found them unacceptable:\nconsequentialism, they claim, simply demands too much and must\ntherefore be rejected (Scheffler 1982, Slote 1985, Williams 1981).\n\nOne form of this worry is a version of what we referred to above as\nthe problem of morally admirable partiality. The common-sense view is\nthat it is permissible for an agent to be partial toward herself; that\nis, to treat her own projects and concerns as if they had special\nsignificance (Scheffler 1982). (From her point of view, of course,\nthey do have special significance.) This sort of self-concern, then,\nconstitutes a form of partiality which seems, from the vantage point\nof common sense, to be morally endorsed. Similarly, certain sorts of\npartiality directed toward other people \u2013 friends, family\nmembers, and the like \u2013 are also forbidden by consequentialist\nimpartiality, but regarded as justifiable, and in many cases\nadmirable, from the standpoint of common sense (Blum 1980, Cottingham\n1983, Kekes 1981, Keller 2013, Slote 1985). A related concern focuses\nnot on morality per se but on the needs and conditions of\nagenthood and personal flourishing. James Griffin, for example, writes\nthat \u201cMany prudential values involve commitments\u2014to\nparticular persons, institutions, causes, and careers. One cannot live\na prudentially good life, one cannot fully flourish, without becoming\nin large measure partial. That partiality then becomes part of one; it\nis not something one can psychologically enter into and exit from at\nwill\u201d (Griffin 1996, 85). Bernard Williams argues that, in\nprohibiting an agent from seeing their own persona projects and\ncommitments as no more significant than those of any other agent,\nconsequentialist theories violate the integrity of agents and\nundermine any reason they might have for being moral (Williams 1973,\n1981; cf. Hurley 2009). (It should be noted that Williams sees Kantian\ndeontological theories as to some degree vulnerable to these\nobjections as well.)\n\nThere are a number of possible responses to this objection. First, a\nconsequentialist might argue that any genuinely impartial\nmoral theory will make extreme demands of agents\u2014at least, if we\nunderstand the concept of impartiality correctly. This strategy faces\na serious difficulty: namely, it at least seems to be the case that\ncertain non-consequentialist moral theories \u2013 in particular,\ndeontological theories \u2013 also incorporate impartial elements in\na fundamental manner, and yet make demands on the moral agent which\nare considerably less extreme than those of consequentialism. Thus,\nwhile some consequentialists (e.g. Brink 1989) have argued that the\ntruth of consequentialism can be logically derived more or less\ndirectly from the requirement that morality be impartial, this seems\nto be a mistake (Scheffler 1992, 105\u2013109). Of course, it is open\nto the consequentialist either to deny that deontological moral\ntheories are genuinely impartial (Kagan 1989; Scheffler 1982, 1985),\nor to argue that, properly understood, any plausible ethical theory\nwill be seen to make demands comparable to those made by\nconsequentialism (Brink 1989, Ashford 2000). Both of these strategies,\nhowever, face difficulties; as we will see in section 4, there is in\nfact a very strong case in favor of viewing at least some\ndeontological theories as genuinely and fundamentally impartial\n\u2013 a case which nevertheless does not prohibit us from viewing\nsuch theories as less demanding than their consequentialist\nrivals.\n\nA consequentialist adopting this strategy also presumably needs to\nshow that human agents are capable of living up to the kinds\nof demands placed on us by consequentialism (or else to argue that it\ndoes not matter whether or not we are capable). As James Griffin\nwrites, our \u201cnatural perhaps genetic partiality limits our will.\nSome acts fall just outside the motivational range of a normal human\nbeing. Since ought implies can, what lies outside\nnatural human motivation does not even enter contention for being a\nmoral requirement. Norms are not fashioned in a vacuum; they are cut\nto fit agents like us\u201d (Griffin 1990, 129). While Kagan (1989)\nargues on behalf of consequentialists that available empirical\nevidence supports the view that humans, given sufficient information\nand vivid representations, can be brought to overcome their inherent\ntendencies to be partial, Griffin regards the evidence as\ninsufficient, concluding that \u201ccomplete impartiality is beyond\nhuman capacity\u201d (Griffin 1996, 92).\n\nA second possible consequentialist response is to argue that those who\nobject to consequentialism on the grounds that it is too demanding are\nplacing too much importance on the role of morality in practical\nreasoning (Brink 1989; Wolf 1982, 1992). If moral considerations\ndominated practical reasoning \u2013 if, that is, they were the only\nor at any rate by far the most significant considerations in\ndetermining our actions \u2013 then consequentialism would be\nuntenable, on account of its demanding too much. But when put in their\nproper place then in the larger scheme of practical reasons and\nrequirements, the extreme demands of consequentialist morality will no\nlonger seem threatening. To borrow a pair of phrases from David Brink,\nwhat appear to be \u2018moral worries\u2019 about the tendency of\nconsequentialism to make excessive moral demands, might really be\n\u2018worries about morality\u2019 \u2013 worries, that is, about\nwhether or not we have reason to act as morality requires. Whether the\nview of morality presupposed by this strategy is true, however, is\nquestionable; at the very least, it does not seem to be the case that\nthe majority of those who have defended consequentialism as a\nnormative theory of ethics have intended it to be viewed as a theory\nthat could be frequently or easily overridden or ignored (see Railton\n1984, Miller 1992 Chapter 10, Jollimore 2001 Chapter 3). One possible\nexception is Alastair Norcross (2006a, 2006b), who has proposed a\nmodification of utilitarianism he calls \u201cscalar\nutilitarianism,\u201d which ranks possible actions in terms of moral\nrightness but makes no claim as to which acts are morally required.\nSince scalar utilitarianism sees rightness as a matter of degree\nrather than as a binary property, and refrains from identifying any\naction as required, he claims that it avoids the demandingness\nobjection and related objections.\n\nA third strategy is perhaps the best known and most frequently\nemployed. It is argued that, given a reasonable and accurate view of\nhuman nature and the abilities of agents, it will be seen that what\nconsequentialism requires is not a radically different sort\nof life from the one most of us currently live; rather,\nconsequentialism will require (in most cases, at least) only\nreasonable, and relatively minor, adjustments in our current\nlifestyles. In particular, it is argued that consequentialism permits\nthe agent both to give preference to her own projects and concerns,\nand to favor particular other individuals (friends, family members,\netc.), and that all this is consistent with the agent\u2019s having\nas her overriding project the maximizing of the good. The locus\nclassicus of this argument is found in Mill\u2019s\nUtilitarianism:\n\nThe objectors to utilitarianism cannot always be charged with\nrepresenting it in a discreditable light. On the contrary, those among\nthem who entertain anything like a just idea of its disinterested\ncharacter, sometimes find fault with its standard as being too high\nfor humanity. They say it is exacting too much to require that people\nshall always act from the inducement of promoting the general\ninterests of society. But this is to mistake the very meaning of a\nstandard of morals, and to confound the rule of action with the motive\nof it [\u2026] The great majority of good actions are intended, not\nfor the benefit of the world, but for that of individuals, of which\nthe good of the world is made up; and the thoughts of the most\nvirtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular\npersons concerned, except so far as is necessary to assure himself\nthat in benefiting them he is not violating the rights \u2013 that\nis, the legitimate and authorized expectations \u2013 of any one\nelse. The multiplication of happiness is, according to the utilitarian\nethics, the object of virtue: the occasions on which any person\n(except one in a thousand) has it in his power to do this on an\nextended scale, in other words, to be a public benefactor, are but\nexceptional; and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider\npublic utility; in every other case, private utility, the interest or\nhappiness of some few persons, is all he has to attend to. (Mill 1992\n[1861], 64\u201366)\n\n\nEven Godwin (1801 [1968]) endorses a version of this argument, writing\nthat\n\nTrue wisdom will recommend to us individual attachments [\u2026]\nsince it is the object of virtue to produce happiness; and since the\nman who lives in the midst of domestic relations will have many\nopportunities of conferring pleasure, minute in the detail, yet not\ntrivial in the amount. (Quoted in Cannold, et al., 1995)\n\n\n(This position, it will be noted, appears to be in some amount of\ntension with the more extreme consequentialist position attributed to\nGodwin in section 2.3).\n\nMore recent versions of this argument follow Mill\u2019s basic\nstrategy. Peter Railton (1984) argues that a\n\u2018sophisticated\u2019 consequentialist will develop patterns of\ndecision-making that do not, except on rare occasions, refer\nexplicitly to consequentialist aims and goals, and that both the\npsychology and the outward behavior of such an individual will be\nsimilar to that of the typical non-consequentialist. Similarly, Frank\nJackson (1991) argues that the most efficient strategy for a dedicated\nconsequentialist is to concentrate on small groups of particular\npersons, rather than trying to promote the well-being of humanity at\nlarge, and that this will involve the formation of close personal\nrelationships with other individuals. Others who have deployed\nversions of this argument include Bales (1971), Brink (1989), and\nPettit & Brennan (1986).\n\nThe evaluation of this consequentialist strategy is a difficult issue.\nConsequentialists are surely correct to point out that obsessive\nconsequentialist strategizing is likely, at a certain point, to turn\ncounter-productive, and that a consequentialist agent is therefore\nwell-advised to develop more moderate approaches. On the other hand,\nMill and many other consequentialists seem to underestimate the amount\nof good that a dedicated consequentialist agent might be able to\ncontribute, and thus, to underestimate the amount of good that she\nwill be required to contribute. Moreover, our powers to influence the\nlives of strangers have increased considerably since Mill\u2019s day.\nAs Susan Wolf writes, \u201c[T]his argument is simply unconvincing in\nlight of the empirical circumstances of our world. The gain in\nhappiness that would accrue to oneself and one\u2019s neighbors by a\nmore well-rounded, richer life than that of the moral saint would be\npathetically small in comparison to the amount by which one could\nincrease the general happiness if one devoted oneself explicitly to\nthe care of the sick, the downtrodden, the starving, and the\nhomeless\u201d (Wolf 1982, 428; see also Singer 1972). This thought\nis borne out by the empirical facts. If we look at the lives of actual\n\u2018effective altruists,\u2019 who are motivated by a commitment\nto make as great a contribution to general well-being as possible, we\nfind that such people have indeed found it necessary to transform\ntheir lives in fairly radical ways and to make large sacrifices in\nterms of time, money, and comfort, and often in terms of relationships\nand personal happiness (see examples in MacFarquhar 2015).\n\nMoreover, even if a theory such as Railton\u2019s sophisticated\nconsequentialism can allow a sophisticated consequentialist agent to\nsometimes knowingly bring about less than maximally good consequences,\nsuch a theory must nonetheless insist that each particular act of\ndoing so is indeed morally wrong \u2013 an insistence which seems\ncontrary to our moral intuitions (Jollimore 2001). It is not clear,\nthen, that an appeal to the limits of human powers can succeed in\nconverting what is a fundamentally radical moral theory into a\ncomfortably conservative one.\n",
