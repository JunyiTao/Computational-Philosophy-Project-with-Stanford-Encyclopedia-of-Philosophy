    "main_text": "Brutalism\n4. Brutalism\n\nAs Unger originally states it, the puzzle relies on a contentious\nprinciple of mereology. In particular, it assumes mereological\nUniversalism, the view that for any objects, there is an object that\nhas all of them as its fusion. (That is, it has each of those objects\nas parts, and has no parts that do not overlap at least one of the\noriginal objects.) Without this assumption, the Problem of the Many\nmay have an easy solution. The cloud in the sky is the object\nup there that is a fusion of water droplets. There are many other sets\nof water droplets, other than the set of water droplets that compose\nthe cloud, but since the members of those sets do not compose an\nobject, they do not compose a cloud.\n\nThere are two kinds of theories that imply that only one of the sets\nof water droplets is such that there exists a fusion of its atoms.\nFirst, there are principled restrictions on composition,\ntheories that say that the xs compose an object y\niff the xs are F, for some natural property\nF. Secondly, there are brutal theories, which say\nit\u2019s just a brute fact that in some cases the xs\ncompose an object, and in others they do not. It would be quite hard\nto imagine a principled theory solving the Problem of the Many, since\nit is hard to see what the principle could be. (For a more detailed\nargument for this, set against a somewhat different backdrop, see\nMcKinnon 2002.) But a brutal theory could work. And such a theory has\nbeen defended. Ned Markosian (1998) argues that not only does\nbrutalism, the doctrine that there are brute facts about when the\nxs compose a y, solve the Problem of the Many, the\naccount of composition it implies fits more naturally with our\nintuitions about composition.\n\nIt seems objectionable, in some not easy-to-pin-down way, to rely on\nbrute facts in just this way. Here is how Terrence Horgan puts the\nobjection:\n\nIn particular, a good metaphysical theory or scientific theory should\navoid positing a plethora of quite specific, disconnected, sui\ngeneris, compositional facts. Such facts would be ontological\ndanglers; they would be metaphysically queer. Even though explanation\npresumably must bottom out somewhere, it is just not credible\u2014or\neven intelligible\u2014that it should bottom out with specific\ncompositional facts which themselves are utterly unexplainable and\nwhich do not conform to any systematic general principles. (Horgan\n1993: 694\u20135)\n\n\nOn the other hand, this kind of view does provide a particularly\nstraightforward solution to the Problem of the Many. As Markosian\nnotes, if we have independent reason to view favourably the idea that\nfacts about when some things compose an object are brute facts, which\nhe thinks is provided by our intuitions about cases of composition and\nnon-composition, the very simplicity of this solution to the Problem\nof the Many may count as an argument in favour of brutalism.\n",
