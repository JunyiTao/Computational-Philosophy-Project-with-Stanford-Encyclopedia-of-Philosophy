The different natures of men and women\n\nTo demonstrate that women are superior in nature to men, Marinella has\nto establish that it is possible for members of the same species to\nhave souls that are the same in kind and yet different in merit. She\nacknowledges the widely accepted view that a species form is the same\nin every individual: \n\n\n\u2026if we speak as philosophers, we will say that man\u2019s soul\nis equally noble to woman\u2019s because both are of the same species\nand therefore of the same nature and substance, (1601b, 55);\n\n\nand \n\n\n\u2026if we wished to apply the common reasoning, we would say that\nwomen\u2019s souls are equal to men\u2019s. (1601b, 57)\n\n\nShe is adverting here to Moderata Fonte and again to Agrippa, who had\nbegun his Proclamation by claiming that God \n\n\nhas attributed to both man and woman an identical soul, which sexual\ndifference does not at all affect\u2026Thus, there is no preeminence\nof nobility of one sex over the other by reason of the nature of the\nsoul; rather, inwardly free, each is equal in dignity, (Agrippa 1529,\n43);\n\n\nshe likely also has in mind Castiglione, who wrote\n\n\nthe male will not be more perfect than the female as regards their\nformal substance, because the one and the other are included under the\nspecies man, and that in which the one differs from the other is an\naccident and is not of the essence. (Castiglione 1528, 214) \n\n\nShe agrees that women have the same rational souls as men, and belong\nto the same species, but denies that it follows from this that their\nsouls are no nobler than the souls of men. That is, she argues, on the\nbasis of the theory of causation that she set out, that\n\n\nit is not impossible that within the same species there should be\nsouls that are from birth nobler and more excellent than\nothers\u2026I say that women\u2019s souls were created nobler than\nmen\u2019s. (1601b, 55) \n\n\nMarinella quite explicitly rejects, then, the idea that men and women\nmust be equal in nobility because they belong to the same species; but\nshe also anticipates the objection that because the species essence,\nthe rational faculty of soul, is the same in every individual person,\nwe might expect that men and women would be equal in worth. It\nfollows, and again she recognizes this, that she must assert that the\nform of a species is not without diversity, and so she explicitly\nargues for variations in the idea or form or soul of the human\nspecies. \u201cWomen\u2019s souls can, therefore, be nobler and more\nprized in their creation than men\u2019s,\u201d (1601b, 57). In\nlight of what she has said about ideas in the mind of God as\nproductive causes of created beings, this must mean: the idea of woman\n(or perhaps the ideas of individual women) in the mind of God is an\nidea of something with a nobler and better purpose, with the result\nthat the creature produced is nobler and more excellent. This is\nconsistent with the claim that men and women have the same rational\nsouls, if we allow that the human soul is constituted by something\nmore than the faculty of reason, and so two human (and hence rational)\nsouls might be put to different purposes. Marinella seeks to show that\nthe purposes to which a rational soul is put will depend, at least in\npart, on the desires of the rational agent.\n\nThe question she confronts is, then, if men and women have souls that\nmake them the same in species\u2014the same in rational\ncapacity\u2014how can women be superior to men? Marinella\u2019s\nanswer depends on distinctions in the faculties of soul, and in\nparticular on a distinction between the rational part and the desiring\npart, in which moral virtues are located. She aims to show that women\nare morally superior to men, and that this causes them to be\n\u201ceven better than men at learning the same arts and\nsciences,\u201d (1601b, 83). That is, her argument is that the moral\nsuperiority of women has an impact on their rational faculties, which\ncauses them to be intellectually superior (better at the same arts and\nsciences) although they are created with the same rational faculty.\nThe argument depends ultimately on Marinella\u2019s views about the\ncausal role of bodily temperature on the soul\u2019s functions, and\nabout the moral status of the actions that issue from the soul\u2019s\nfunctioning, views that will be elaborated in the following section.\nBut Marinella produces a variety of kinds of evidence that, with\nrespect to the moral virtues, and especially with respect to the\ncontrol of the passions, women are superior. First, she claims that\nwomen are superior to men with respect to a variety of individual\nmoral and intellectual virtues, and provides evidence in the form of\nexamples of excellent women who manifest these virtues (\u201cIt is a\nfact known to everyone that women are continent and temperate, for we\nnever see or read about them getting drunk or spending all day in\ntaverns, as dissolute men do, nor do they give themselves\nunrestrainedly to other pleasures,\u201d (1601b, 94).) Second, she\npoints out that since men, whatever they might say about\nwomen, treat women with signs of honor, and since \u201cnobody honors\nanother person unless they know that the person has some gift or\nquality that is superior to his own\u201d (1601b, 69), we should\nconclude that men themselves recognize the superiority of women. But,\nas we will see in the next section, she ultimately traces the moral\nsuperiority of women, which is responsible for their intellectual\nsuperiority, to differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nbodies.\n\nMarinella clearly suggests, then, that both deliberative and\nspeculative reason are exercised more effectively by women because of\nthe moral advantages of their sex. Granting that women and men have\nthe same rational faculties of soul, if women are morally superior to\nmen, they will also thereby attain intellectual superiority, making\nthem better at learning the same arts and sciences. Although the souls\nof women are \u201cstill nobler\u201d than those of men with respect\nin particular to the moral faculty, that nobility will have an impact\non the rational faculty with the result that women are better than men\nintellectually and not only morally.\n\nSo while Marinella asserts (on the authority of Aristotle and\nscripture) that we can know the souls of men and women to be forms of\nthe same species, rational souls, and equal in that respect, she also\ninsists that this fundamental sameness allows nonetheless for\ndistinctions in merit. Women\u2019s souls are superior to those of\nmen, because the moral character of women makes their faculty of\ndesire, and ultimately also their faculty of reason, better than\nmen\u2019s. The superiority of women\u2019s desires she traces to\ntheir temperate physiology, and she takes the proof of the superiority\nof their souls to be manifested in the beauty of their bodies.\n",
