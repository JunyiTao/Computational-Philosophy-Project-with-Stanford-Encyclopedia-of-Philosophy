    "main_text": "Philosophical Positions || Aristotle and Anti-determinism\n4. Influence\n\nAmmonius was chiefly influential as the founder of the school of\nAristotle-interpretation in Alexandria. Nearly all the principal\ncommentators who came after him were his pupils or his pupils\u2019\npupils. He gave a model for the method of exegesis of Aristotle and\nPlato and his lecturing style made an impression on students. His\ncommentary on De Interpretatione was particularly important\nand served as a source for Stephanus and other commentators. In its\ntranslation by William of Moerbeke, this work was influential on\nAquinas and thus on medieval and later Aristotelian philosopy and\nsemantics (cf., e.g., Fortier 2012). Ammonius\u2019 new set of\nintroductions to philosophy and the study of Aristotle, once adopted\nand adapted by his Alexandrian students\u2014Olympiodorus, Elias,\nDavid, Pseudo-Elias, and Philoponus, were also transferred to other\nlanguages and cultures. Importantly, a number of his and his\nstudents\u2019 works were studied and translated into Persian, Arabic\nand Syriac, where Ammonius\u2019 influence was carried forward (cf.\nthe brief overview of the diffusion of Ammonius\u2019 new curriculum\nand its introductions in Sorabji 2016c, 49\u201353, also with further\nliterature on the translations of works from Ammonius\u2019 school).\nAs an example of this diffusion, take the larger commentary on the\nCategories by Sergius of Reshaina (d. 536), who studied with\nAmmonius at Alexandria and later became a physician in his home city\n(see Hugonnard-Roche 2004 and Watt 2010, both with further\nliterature).\n",
