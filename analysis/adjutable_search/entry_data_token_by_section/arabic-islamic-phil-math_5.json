We also need to take some further steps.\nFollowing Aristotle and Euclid, most (if not all) Muslim philosophers\nbelieve in foundationalist/axiomatic accounts of epistemology,\naccording to which all instances of knowledge are eventually built\nupon the foundations (mab\u0101di\u2019) of basic concepts\nand propositions which can be known directly and immediately.\nNon-basic concepts and propositions can be derived from basic ones by\ndefinitions (ta\u02bf\u0101r\u012bf or\n\u1e25ud\u016bd) and syllogisms\n(qiy\u0101s\u0101t), respectively. This means that after\nacquiring the conceptual components of a proposition P we\nstill need to take the following three steps:\n\nordering and combining the acquired concepts to form\nP as a structured unity,\nassenting to the truth (ta\u1e63d\u012bq) of\nfoundational propositions, and\nestablishing the truth of P with some\nsyllogisms from the foundational propositions.\n\n\nFor Avicenna, the faculty of imagination plays crucial roles in steps\n(1) and (3). Imagination enables us to arrive at meaningful\npropositions by exploring our storage of previously grasped concepts\nand combining them to make various ordered structures of concepts (and\nto examine whether or not they form a meaningful proposition).\nMoreover, imagination enables us to consider combinations of\npropositions in order to find the suitable (series of consecutive)\nsyllogism(s) which can lead us to the desired proposition. The most\ncrucial part of this process is to find suitable middle terms for the\nsyllogisms which can lead us to the desired conclusion. In\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy, the faculty of imagination undertakes\nthis search operation. An immediate question regarding this view is\nhow imagination, as a bodily faculty, can entertain universal concepts\nthat are supposed to be fully immaterial intelligible entities.\nVarious possible answers to this question are investigated by, among\nothers, Gutas (2001), Adamson (2004), and Black (2013). In Ibn\nal-Haytham\u2019s philosophy, this is the faculty of distinction that\nplays the central role regarding (1) and (3). (More on (3) will be\nsaid in the next section).\n\nThings get more complicated when we turn to\n (2).\n Following the ancient Greek tradition, Muslim philosophers categorize\nthe foundational principles of the demonstrative sciences into three\ngroups: common notions/axioms (al-u\u1e63\u016bl\nal-muta\u02bf\u0101rafa), hypotheses (al-u\u1e63\u016bl\nal-maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bfa), and postulates\n(mu\u1e63\u0101dar\u0101t). Roughly speaking, common notions\nare the most obvious propositions that we can know\u2014the first\nprinciples that we grasp. Hypotheses and postulates are not as obvious\nas axioms. They in principle need to be proved. These two groups of\nprinciples are usually distinguished based on the epistemic attitude\nof the student who is learning them. Hypotheses are the foundational\nprinciples that seem plausible to the student even though she has no\nproof for them. By contrast, postulates seem dubious to the student,\nin the sense that she might have some feelings and ideas against the\nplausibility of these principles. The most often repeated example of\npostulates in the works of medieval Muslim thinkers is probably the\nparallel postulate of Euclidean geometry. This classification is\ndefended by, among others, al-Nayr\u012bz\u012b (d. 922; in Besthorn\n& Heiberg 1893: 14\u201326), al-F\u0101r\u0101bi\n(Al-Man\u1e6diq, chaps. 87\u201390), Avicenna\n(al-Burh\u0101n, chap. I.12), and al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\n(As\u0101s al-\u02beiqtib\u0101s, chap. V.1.15).\n\nSince mathematical hypotheses and postulates must eventually be proved\nbased on previously known propositions, it seems that the epistemic\nstatus of mathematical propositions depends, in the end, on how we\ngrasp the most obvious of these principles. In other words, it seems\nthat all mathematical propositions can be derived from axioms through\nthe fully a priori (= sense-experience-independent) mechanism\nof demonstrative syllogism.\n\nMuslim thinkers have no consensus regarding the epistemic status of\nthe principles of mathematics and the cognitive mechanisms through\nwhich we assent to the truth of these principles. For example, it can\nbe shown that, according to Avicenna, every basic proposition of\nmathematics is included in either awwal\u012by\u0101t\n(primary data) or fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t (or, more\ncompletely, muqaddam\u0101t fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t\nal-qiy\u0101s, which is translated to \u2018data with built-in\nsyllogisms\u2019 by Gutas (2012)). \u2018The whole is greater than\nthe part\u2019 and \u2018four is even\u2019 are two of the most\nfamous examples, respectively, of awwal\u012by\u0101t and\nfi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t. According to Avicenna,\nawwal\u012by\u0101t have no middle terms and, therefore, no\nsyllogism can be made to demonstrate them. They are too basic and\nobvious to need a proof (or to be provable at all). As soon as we\ngrasp all the concepts from which an awwal\u012b proposition\nis constituted, we immediately assent to the truth of that\nproposition. These propositions are self-evident and necessary. No one\ncan have a rational doubt about them. Unlike\nawwal\u012by\u0101t, fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t have\nmiddle terms and must be proved. However, the syllogism through which\na fi\u1e6dr\u012b proposition must be established is so\nsimple that as soon as the minor term (i.e., subject) and the major\nterm (i.e., predicate) are grasped, the middle term appears in the\nmind and the truth of that proposition is assented to. For example,\nimmediately after grasping the concepts four\nand even, the concept divisible-by-two\nappears in our mind and we can\naffirm the fact that \u2018(every) four is even\u2019 through the\nfollowing syllogism (Mousavian & Ardeshir 2018):\n\n\n(Every) four is divisible by two.\n\n(Every) divisible by two is even.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\n(Every) four is even.\n\n\nThe truths of both awwal\u012by\u0101t and\nfi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t are assented to through the natural\noperation (fi\u1e6dra) of the intellect. So, after grasping\nthe conceptual components of them, we can grasp these propositions\nwithout appealing to the data we receive from our sense experiences.\nThese propositions are constituted from non-a priori\nconcepts. But after we grasp the conceptual components of them, these\npropositions can be justified through a priori mechanisms. We\nshould be cautious, however, that a priority does not entail\ninnateness in the sense of being given at birth. Avicenna rejects that\nwe possess any instance of propositional knowledge at birth. (For\ndifferent views regarding the epistemic status of the Avicennian\nawwal\u012by\u0101t and fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t,\nsee Zarepour 2020a; 2020c; Gutas 2020.)\n\nMore or less similar accounts of the basic propositions of mathematics\ncan be found in philosophers like al-F\u0101r\u0101bi and\nal-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. However, both some of Avicenna\u2019s\ncontemporaries and some post-Avicennian thinkers took a more empirical\nand/or more skeptical approach to the truth of mathematical\npropositions. For example, in his first commentary on Euclid\u2019s\nElements, Shar\u1e25 mus\u1ea1\u0304dar\u0101t,\nIbn al-Haytham follows the mainstream view that basic propositions of\nmathematics are self-evident, necessary, and rationally indubitable.\nBut, in his second commentary, \u1e24all shuk\u016bk\n([Doubts]), he endorses a more empirical position and argues that we\nacquire these instances of knowledge by facing frequent use of them in\ndaily life. Consider, for example, the common notion \u2018things\nwhich correspond with one another are equal to one another\u2019. Ibn\nal-Haytham says that we accept this proposition because we have\nrepeatedly seen that when a body is mapped or superposed upon another\nbody and the lengths of them do not exceed each other, our intellect\n(\u02bfaql) judges that these bodies (or, more precisely,\ntheir lengths) are equal. Without having such experiences, we could\nnot come to assent to the truth of this axiom. Therefore, our\nknowledge of such axioms is somewhat sense-experience-dependent (Ibn\nal-Haytham [Doubts]: 31; R. Rashed 2019).\n\nIn his Optics (Sabra 1989), Ibn al-Haytham puts forward an\ninteresting treatment of the principle \u2018the whole is greater\nthan the part\u2019, which has striking similarities with\nAvicenna\u2019s treatment of fi\u1e6dr\u012by\u0101t. He\nargues that this principle can be proved through the following\nargument:\n\n\nThe whole exceeds the part.\n\nEverything which exceeds something else is greater than it.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\nThe whole is greater than the part.\n\n\nThe premises themselves of this argument must be justified through the\noperation of the intellect or the faculty of distinction (to use Ibn\nal-Haytham\u2019s own terminology) upon the data we receive through\nour senses (Sabra 1989: vol. I, 133\u201334; Ighbariah & Wagner\n2018). The traces of these attitudes towards the axioms and common\nnotions can be found in the works of Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b and some of later mutikallim\u016bn\n(Morrison 2014: 220\u201322; Hasan 2017: sec. 2.4.2; Ighbariah and\nWagner 2018: 66\u201368).\n",
