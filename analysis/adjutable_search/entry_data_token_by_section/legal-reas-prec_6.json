    "main_text": "The Justifications for Precedent || Consistency\n3.1 Consistency\n\n\nThe argument from consistency is related to arguments in favour of\n\u2018formal\u2019 justice, i.e., that two cases which are the same\n(in relevant respects) should be treated in the same way. It would\nsimply be inconsistent to treat them differently. In the case of\nprecedent this argument is said to favour following the earlier case:\nassuming that one cannot change the earlier decision (because it is\ntoo late to appeal, or the party to the case has reasonably relied\nupon it, etc), the only way to ensure consistency is for later\ndecision-makers to treat the earlier decision as a precedent. The\nclaim of consistency is also sometimes put in terms of\n\u2018equality\u2019: to treat the later case differently to the\nfirst would be to fail to treat the parties before the courts\nequally. This argument is made independently of other concerns such as\nparties' expectations or community perceptions of the court\nprocess or the problem of moral disagreement. Arguments of this kind\ncertainly have weight in some circumstances. If a legal system is\nmorally legitimate and has authority over those subject to it, then it\nis inconsistent for one person to be treated less or more favourably\nby the law than another person whose situation is legally\nindistinguishable. Other things being equal, legal decisions should be\nconsistent across time and/or decision-makers. A later case should\nonly be treated differently to an earlier case when the law itself has\nbeen changed (by the legislator or the courts, including cases where\nthe court overrules an earlier decision in reaching a decision on the\ncase before it) So concerns of consistency provide some justification\nfor treating earlier decisions as sources of law, rather than\napproaching each question anew when it arises again.\n\n\nThis fact does not, however, support a doctrine of following earlier\ndecisions even when they are wrong, i.e., for having a strong\npractice of stare decisis. If the earlier decision was wrong\nthen the person subject to it may have been treated more or less\nfavourably than they should have been treated. If they were treated\nmore favourably then clearly that should have been corrected (e.g. on\nappeal). If it was not corrected then the person had an undeserved\nslice of good fortune. But that a mistake was made in the earlier case\nis not\u2014in itself\u2014an argument for repeating the mistake in\nthe later case. The first litigant did not deserve their outcome, even\nif for reasons of the finality of legal processes they are entitled to\nretain it. Equality does not demand the repetition of mistakes. On the\nother hand, if the original litigant was treated less favourably than\nthey deserved then again that mistake should be corrected if it can be\n(e.g. by appeal, or, if that is too late, by remedial legislation or\nby executive action such as pardon or ex gratia payments),\nbut it is no reason for treating a later litigant unfavourably as\nwell. Taken in isolation from other considerations (such as\nexpectations and predictability), equality does not support the\nbindingness of incorrect decisions.\n\n\nBy contrast, arguments of equality bite where the court in the\noriginal case was confronted with a situation where the correct\noutcome was indeterminate, i.e., where more than one outcome was\npossible in light of the legally permissible arguments. This may be\ndue to each outcome being equally well supported by reason, or by the\noutcomes being supported by different, incommensurable, values. In\nsome of these cases the law has closure rules to settle the matter,\ne.g. in favour of criminal defendants, but in others there are no\nclosure rules as to the appropriate substantive result to endorse. A\npossible illustration of such indeterminacy is the position of a\nperson who quite innocently buys stolen goods. In some legal systems\nthe purchaser acquires good title to those goods, whereas in others\n(such as the Common Law) she does not. Here, arguably, the merits of\nthe two innocent parties (the purchaser and the original owner) are on\na par, and all the law can do is choose which one is to prevail.  So\nwhere an outcome is underdetermined there are arguments of equality\nfor later courts following the earlier decision rather than adopting\nany of the other possible solutions. None of this, of course, is an\nargument for following earlier decisions that were wrongly decided,\nsince these are cases where the earlier court did not make a mistake,\nbut took one permissible option.\n",
