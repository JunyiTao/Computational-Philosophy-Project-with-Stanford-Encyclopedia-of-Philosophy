    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism || Reductive explanations of ethical supervenience\n4.1 Reductive explanations of ethical supervenience\n\nAs\n Section 3.2\n explained, some philosophers have argued that the supervenience of\nthe ethical entails that the ethical can be reduced. These arguments\nare quite controversial, but it is perhaps less controversial that a\nsuccessful reduction of the ethical properties would suffice to\nexplain the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical.\n\nConsider first a reductive account that identifies the ethical\nproperties with some natural or supernatural property. Assuming that\nnatural and supernatural properties are among the base properties, the\nsupervenience of rightness on the base properties would be easily\nexplained on this view: because rightness is identical to a base\nproperty, on this view, there clearly cannot be a difference in\nrightness without some difference in base properties.\n\nIf essentialist explanations are legitimate, essentialist reduction\nagain appears to be a straightforward way of explaining the\nsupervenience of the ethical. Part of the idea of essence is that\nnecessarily, nothing can survive the loss of one of its essential\nproperties. So if rightness had an essentialist real definition purely\nin terms of base properties, then it would be clear why there could be\nno difference in rightness without a difference in base\nproperties.\n\nIn light of this, neither Hume\u2019s dictum nor anti-brutalism\nappear to cast doubt on either sort of reductive theory, for both\ntheories are able to explain supervenience, and hence avoid commitment\nto a brute necessary connection between the ethical properties and the\nbase properties.\n\nTerence Horgan and Mark Timmons claim that even if the ethical realist\nendorses reduction, they face a further explanatory burden before they\ncan fully explain supervenience: \u201cEven if goodness, for\ninstance, is identical to some specific natural property, there\nremains the task of explaining why this natural property,\nrather than any other one(s), counts as the correct referent of the\nterm \u2018goodness\u2019\u201d (1992, 230; emphasis in original).\nThis is a fair explanatory demand, if we interpret it as the familiar\nchallenge to provide a plausible theory of reference for ethical terms\n(a demand that Horgan and Timmons have pressed incisively). However\nthis challenge does not appear to have anything distinctive to do with\nsupervenience. Either the reductive naturalistic realist can explain\nthe reference of \u2018wrong,\u2019 in which case she can also\nexplain supervenience, or she cannot explain the reference of\n\u2018wrong,\u2019 in which case her view is implausible for reasons\nthat have nothing to do with supervenience.\n",
