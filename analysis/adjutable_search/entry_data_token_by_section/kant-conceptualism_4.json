    "main_text": "Frame I: Conceptual Content || Concepts and Conceptual Synthesis\n3.2 Concepts and Conceptual Synthesis\n\nAccording to Conceptualism, the cognitive relation of an intuition to\nan object is, in some sense, conceptual. A version of this claim is\nseemingly articulated by Kant at B137, quoted above, in which it is a\nsynthesis by concepts that constitutes what Kant calls a\n\u201cdeterminate relation\u201d (bestimmten Beziehung) to\nan object. After first discussing what Kant means by\n\u201csynthesis\u201d here we\u2019ll go on to address the\nprospects and problems facing an account of intuition as dependent on\nconceptual synthesis.\n\nKant distinguishes between two basic classes of mental processing. The\nfirst is association, which is carried out by sensibility, and\nspecifically the imagination. Association is primarily a passive\nprocess by which the mind comes to connect representations due to the\nrepeated exposure of the subject to certain kinds of regularities. One\nmight (e.g.) associate chicken soup with being ill, because one only\never had chicken soup when one was ill. Association is thus capable of\nengendering content-sensitive connections between a subject\u2019s\nmental states, though such connections depend entirely on the local\nand contingent circumstances in which the subject comes to have such\nstates. This is part of why Kant denies that association could ever\naccount for our ability to represent universality or necessity.\n\nThe second kind of mental processing is \u201ccombination\u201d\n(Verbindung) or \u201csynthesis\u201d, carried out by the\nintellect broadly conceived (i.e., the \u201chigher\u201d cognitive\nfaculties of understanding, judgment, and reason). Kant characterizes\nsynthesis as that activity by which the understanding \u201cruns\nthrough\u201d and \u201cgathers together\u201d representations\ngiven to it by sensibility in order to form concepts, judgments, and\nultimately, for any cognition (in its \u201cproper\u201d sense) at\nall to take place (A77-8/B102-3). Synthesis is not something we are\nalways, or even typically, aware of doing. As Kant says, it is\n\u201ca blind though indispensable function of the soul\u2026of\nwhich we are only seldom even conscious (A78/B103).\u201d Kant\ntypically contrasts synthesis with other ways in which representations\nmight be related, most importantly, by association (e.g., B139-40). In\ncontrast with association, synthesis is a fundamentally active\nprocess, dependent upon the mind\u2019s spontaneity, and is the means\nby which genuine judgment is possible. Moreover, at least by the time\nof Kant\u2019s writing of the B-Deduction of the first\nCritique, he is clear that judgments, as outcomes of\nsynthesis, are unique in our mental economy in that they are complex\nrepresentations that possess the capacity to be true or false. As\nKant\u2019s discussion in \u00a719 of the B-Deduction shows, a\njudgment isn\u2019t simply a \u201crepresentation of a relation\nbetween two concepts\u201d (B140), which doesn\u2019t rule out mere\nassociation between concepts, but is rather a representation of an\nobjectively valid relationship in virtue of which the judgment may be\nseen as an objective claim to truth (B142).\n\nSynthesis is carried out by the unitary subject of representation on\nrepresentations that are either given to it in sensibility (i.e.,\nintuition and/or sensation) or produced by it via the intellect (e.g.,\nin an act of judgment). When synthesis is carried out on\nrepresentations forming the content of a concept or judgment, it is\ncalled \u201cintellectual\u201d synthesis; when carried out by the\nimagination on material provided by sensibility (i.e., on intuition\nand sensation), it is called \u201cfigurative\u201d synthesis\n(B150-1). In the Critique of Pure Reason Kant discusses in\nsome depth the synthesis performed on representations provided by\nsensibility, and discusses three central kinds of synthesis\u2014viz.\napprehension, reproduction (or imagination), and recognition (or\nconceptualization) (A98-110/B159-61). Though Kant discusses these\nforms of synthesis in a way that suggests they are discrete types of\nmental acts, it is also plausible that they always go together (Paton\n1936: 271\u2013272; Kemp Smith 2003: 245\u2013246), or at least that\nthe first two forms must always occur together, with the third being\n(perhaps) an optional addition (Brook 1997; Allais 2009).\n\nGiven that Kant distinguishes between intellectual and figurative\nsynthesis, what does it then mean to claim that an intuition\nconstitutively depends on conceptual synthesis for its relation to an\nobject?\n\nKant describes a concept as a \u201cfunction\u201d\n(Funktion), which he characterizes as \u201cthe unity of the\nact through which different representations are ordered under a common\none\u201d (A68/B93). Concepts are merely \u201cpredicates of\npossible judgments\u201d (A69/B94) \u201cgrounded on the spontaneity\nof thinking\u201d and the faculty of understanding \u201ccan make no\nother use of these concepts than that of judging by means of\nthem\u201d (A68/B93).\n\nFrom these passages we can conclude that concepts are (i)\nactualizations of the spontaneity of (the power of) thought through\nwhich (ii) different representations are ordered under a common one.\nThis ordering is carried out specifically by means of (iii) a\njudgment. Hence, an act of conceptualization is an act of\nsubordinating one representation \u201cunder\u201d another, as a\nspecies (or the members thereof) is to its genus (or the members\nthereof), and it is this subordination relation that is captured in\nthe cognitive activity of judging (Paton 1936: 285; Strawson 1966: 94;\nPippin 1982: 33; Longuenesse 1998: ch. 4; Engstrom 2019:\n245\u2013252).\n\nHow, on this view of conceptual activity in judgment, is the\nconceptualization of sensory material in intuition supposed to work?\nAccording to one prominent interpretation\u2014call this\n\u2018judgmentalism\u2019 (Land 2015b)\u2014intuition requires a\njudgment on the part of the subject, that things are experientially\nthus-and-so (Strawson 1970; Carl 1992: 165). However, this\ninterpretation of Kant generates some straightforward problems\n(Gr\u00fcne 2009: \u00a72.2; Land 2015b). First, Kant\u2019s\nconception of judgment seems to require predication (and in this sense\nconcepts are predicates of possible judgments). However, a sensible\nsynthesis carried out by concepts does not seem equivalent to the\nmaking of a judgment, rather it seems that Kant has in mind something\nlike the formation of a sensory image (e.g., B154, B162). Indeed, in a\n1791 letter Kant explicitly denies that intuitions are related to\nobjects via an act of judgment or, relatedly, by the subsumption of\nthe intuition under a concept (C 11:311). Second, Kant emphasizes that\nthere are two distinctively different kinds of synthesis\u2014viz.\nthe \u201cintellectual\u201d synthesis generative of conceptual\njudgment, and the \u201cfigurative\u201d synthesis generative of\nexperience (in Kant\u2019s sense of \u201cexperience\u201d; see\nB151). If the judgmentalist view were correct, then it is difficult to\nsee how Kant could maintain such a distinction between varieties of\nsynthesis. Third, there is at least a prima facie circularity\nto the judgmentalist account, which construes conceptual judgment as a\nnecessary condition of the generation of intuition, and Kant\u2019s\naccount of concept formation, which construes all concepts (even the a\npriori categories) as the result of reflection, which itself\npresupposes sensory intuition (Ginsborg 2006b; Gr\u00fcne 2009;\nAnderson 2015: ch. 13).\n\nSuch problems have lead some (e.g., Sellars 1968; McDowell 1996;\nLonguenesse 1998; Haag 2007; Gr\u00fcne 2009) to argue that the\ndependence of intuition on conceptual representation must be\nunderstood in a way other than that of application of a concept in\njudgment (or the subordination of an intuition under a concept). This\nentry examines below one way such an alternative view might proceed\n(and challenges it faces) before discussing further extensions of it\nin the context of the second way of framing the debate about the\nrelation between intuition and concept.\n",
