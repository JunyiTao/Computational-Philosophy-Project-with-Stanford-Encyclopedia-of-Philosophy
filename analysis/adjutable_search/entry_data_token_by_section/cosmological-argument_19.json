    "main_text": "An Inductive Cosmological Argument\n9. Necessary Being\n\nFinally, even if the cosmological argument is sound or cogent, the\ndifficult task remains to show, as part of natural theology, that the\nnecessary being to which the cosmological argument concludes is the\nGod of religion, and if so, of which religion. Rowe suggests that the\ncosmological argument has two parts, one to establish the existence of\na first cause or necessary being, the other that this necessary being\nis God (1975: 6). It is unclear, however, whether the second\ncontention is an essential part of the cosmological argument. Although\nAquinas was quick to make the identification between God and the first\nmover or first cause (growing out of his contention that philosophy is\nthe handmaiden of theology, such that in philosophy faith seeks\nunderstanding, not confirmation), such identification seems to go\nbeyond the causal reasoning that informs the argument (although one\ncan argue that it is consistent with the larger picture of God and his\nproperties that Aquinas paints in his Summae). Some\n(Rasmussen, O\u2019Connor, Koons) have plowed ahead in developing\nthis stage 2 process by showing how and what\nproperties\u2014simplicity, unity, omnipotence, omniscience,\ngoodness, and so on\u2014might follow from the concept of a necessary\nbeing. It \u201chas implications that bring it into the neighborhood\nof God as traditionally conceived\u201d (O\u2019Connor 2008: 67).\nOthers have proposed a method of correlation, where to give any\nreligious substance to the concept of a necessary being, one conducts\na lengthy discussion of the supreme beings found in the diverse\nreligions and carefully correlates the properties of a necessary being\nwith those of a religious being. This is done to discern\ncompatibilities and incompatibilities (Attfield 1975).\n\nRegardless of the connection of a necessary being with religion, it is\nnecessary to flesh out the nature of the necessary being if one is to\nhold that the cosmological argument is informative. As O\u2019Connor\nnotes, the mere concept of a necessary being is \u201cquite\nthin\u201d. Along with classical Islamic defenders of the argument\n(e.g., al-Baghdadi, c. 1000), O\u2019Connor (2008: 88) concludes that\nthere is a necessary connection between a personal necessary being and\nits nature. He suggests that there is not a contingent but a\n\u201csubtle entailment relation\u201d between certain essential\nproperties like being perfectly powerful, perfectly free, and\nperfectly knowledgeable. For example, the \n\n\nextent of power seems to be a function of at least two variables: the\namount of work that can be performed in a single task and the range of\ntasks one is able to perform in a given circumstance.\u2026 Perfect\npower and freedom would require an essentially unlimited knowledge,\ncorresponding to the unlimited range of possibilities. (2008: 89) \n\n\nA necessary being must also be causally independent for its existence\nand thus transcendent (2008: 92). Similarly, Swinburne ties\nGod\u2019s perfection to his simplicity that, as we have seen,\nfunctions centrally in his argument.\n\nTwo notions of necessity are found in the conclusion to the deductive\nargument: \u201cNecessarily, a necessary being exists\u201d. The\nfirst is conditional necessity: the proposition is necessary given\nthat the premises are true and the argument valid. The other use\nconcerns what is meant by \u201cnecessary being\u201d.\nO\u2019Connor writes that God is absolutely necessary, by which he\nmeans that God is \u201cabsolutely invulnerable to\nnonexistence\u201d (2008: 70). \n\n\nThe concept of a necessary being is of one that could not have failed\nto exist, absolutely speaking. For such a being to be possible, it\nmust be such that it would exist in every possible circumstance,\nincluding the actual one. That\u2019s precisely why the question of\nits existence cannot arise, thereby ending the regress of explanation\nnonarbitrarily. (O\u2019Connor 2013: 42) \n\n\nFor him necessary existence is necessarily tied up with a particular\nnature (otherwise the existence would be contingent) but not\nderivative from it; God\u2019s existence entails his nature (2008:\n88). God\u2019s necessity is not logical (for there is no\ncontradiction in denying that such a being exists) but made possible\non explanatory grounds (the cosmological argument). However, we might\ninquire, if God could not have failed to exist, how does an absolutely\nnecessary being differ from a logically necessary being?\nO\u2019Connor goes on to argue that God\u2019s absolute necessity\ndoes not invoke the ontological argument. He agrees that by modal\nAxiom S5, if it is possible that a necessary being exists, it\nnecessarily exists (2008: 71), but denies that this invokes the\nontological argument, since it \u201cgives no reason to think that\nthe nature in question is genuinely possible, and not merely logically\nconsistent\u201d. However, one might wonder, what would one have to\nestablish to show that the existence of a necessary being understood\nin this sense is genuinely possible? (see Plantinga, God, Freedom,\nand Evil, 1967: 112). Gale himself admits that, given this view\nof necessity and S5, the ontological argument works although we\ndon\u2019t know how to properly construct it (Gale and Pruss 1999:\n462).\n\nOne way to understand the necessary being is as factually or\nmetaphysically necessary. In this understanding, the necessary being\nis \u201csheer, ultimate, unconditioned reality, without beginning or\nend\u201d (Hick 1960: 730). God\u2019s necessity refers to his\naseity, in that God does not depend on anything else for his\nexistence. It is from God\u2019s aseity that his eternity\nfollows.\n\n\nGod is not one fact amongst others, but is related asymmetrically to\nall other facts as that which determines them. This is the ultimate\ngiven circumstance, which it is not possible to go with either\nquestion or explanation. For to explain something means either to\nassign a cause to it or to show its place within some wider context in\nrelation to which it is no longer puzzling to us. However, the idea of\nthe self-existent Creator of everything other than himself is the idea\nof a reality which is beyond the scope of these explanatory\nprocedures. (Hick 1960: 733\u201334)\n\n\nGiven this reading of \u201cnecessary being\u201d, God as the\nnecessary being possesses metaphysical or factual necessity and\nlogical contingency (Hick 1960; Swinburne 2004: 79). If the necessary\nbeing exists at any time, then necessarily it exists at all times. If\nthe necessary being does not exist, it cannot come into existence.\nNothing can bring it into existence or cause it to cease to exist.\nThus, if God exists now, it is not coherent to suppose that any agent\ncan make it false that God exists (Swinburne 2004: 249, 266).\nO\u2019Connor objects that if the necessary being is contingent, it\njust happens to exist (2008: 70; see White (1979) for further\nobjections). However, one might reply that God does not just happen to\nexist; God exists because of his nature (although his nature does not\nprecede his existence).\n\nFurther considerations beyond the scope of the cosmological argument\nare in order to discern the relationship between a necessary being and\nthe properties often associated with a religious Ultimate. While\ndefenders of the cosmological argument point to the relevance and\nimportance of connecting the necessary being with natural theology,\ncritics find themselves freed from such endeavors.\n\nAfter all is presented and developed, it is clear that every thesis\nand argument we have considered, whether in support or critical of the\ncosmological argument, is seriously contested. Perhaps that is as it\nshould be when trying to answer the difficult questions whether the\nuniverse is contingent or necessary, caused or eternal, and if caused,\nwhy it exists or what brought it into being. \n",
