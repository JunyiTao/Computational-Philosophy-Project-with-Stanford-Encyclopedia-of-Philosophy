    "main_text": "Freedom to philosophize\n6. Usefulness and significance of Ramism\n\nSome of Ramus\u2019 opponents called him usuarius or\nusurarius. Both words derive etymologically from the Latin verb\nuti, to use or to receive benefit from. The second term,\nusurarius, is directly related to usura, interest.\nIts application to Ramus was, no doubt, intended as a criticism,\nindicating that he was strutting around in borrowed finery, perhaps\ncombined with an imputation of avarice. According to Nancelius, his\nfortune was modest but still substantial enough for him to defray the\ncosts of endowing a professorship (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita:\n243). By insisting that studies should be useful, humanists were\nattacking the scholastics for promoting what they regarded as a\nuseless curriculum. Ramus, along with other humanists, often ridiculed\nthe meaningless rules and facts that young students were compelled to\nmemorize (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 212; cf. Ong 1958:\n321n). It is easy to see why such unsatisfactory practices in the\nuniversities were condemned and why a humanist like Ramus was deeply\nunsympathetic toward the bad Latin which scholastics regularlarly and\ndeliberately employed in disputations to express their logical type of\nlinguistic arguments: \n\n\nIncredible as it seems, it is nevertheless true and can be found in\npublished books that at this famous university there have been\nteachers who stubbornly maintained and defended the view that Ego\namat (\u2018I loves\u2019) is as correct as Ego amo\n(\u2018I love\u2019). (Ramus, Scholae grammaticae, in\nScholae in liberales artes, col. 15)\n\n\nAs we have seen, Ramus wanted the study of every art to be directed\ntoward practice. There was no point in memorizing rules unless one\nalso learned how to use them. In this respect he was a pioneer in the\nfield of pedagogy. When lecturing, he would not rattle off one\nparagraph after another, but instead would comment on the text page by\npage, a habit which earned him the nickname paginarius, the\n\u201cpage man\u201d. He set out to reform the curriculum, and he\nwrote books that would fit in with the new demands of the age. Not\nsurprisingly, his innovative ideas attracted interest from those\noutside the universities. The king of France and other rulers were\nkeen to hire well-educated officials for their expanding\nadministrations, enabling them to reduce their dependence on the\nchurch. They therefore lent their enthusiastic support to Ramus\u2019\ncall for useful studies.\n\nAs a humanist, Ramus was also interested in including the humanities\nwithin the encyclopedia of learning. He himself intended to edit and\ncomment on every speech of Cicero. His lectures were famous and,\naccording to Nancelius, his spoken Latin was eloquent (Nancelius\nPetri Rami Vita: 207). Although he did not want rhetoric and\nphilosophy to be confused as arts, he certainly wanted logic and\nrhetoric to be integral parts of the student\u2019s practice in every\ndiscipline; and he specifically wanted to make logic more useful for\nthe humanities (see\n \u00a73.4\n above).\n\nRamus was neither a bad logician nor a bad philosopher. Nonetheless,\nhis work in these fields does not earn him a prominent\nplace in the history of logic or philosophy. But this was not what he\nset out to achieve. His goal was to reform university teaching of the\narts; and he deserves to be regarded as a pedagogical trailblazer,\neven though he perhaps lacked the originality and creativity of a\nthinker such as Jan Amos Comenius (1592\u20131670).\n\nNancelius reminds us that Ramus was accused by his opponents of \n\n\nintroducing poets and orators into the schools, and of claiming that\nyou could derive from them the benefit not only of speaking well, but\nthe sure practice of the whole philosophy, especially ethics, rhetoric\nand logic. (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 213) \n\n\nIt was not, in any case, his originality that brought him to a\nposition of eminence among his contemporaries. The reason for his\nenormous impact, within both the university and the wider society, was\nhis capacity to perceive new needs and to respond to new demands. His\nprogram of educational reform was, for instance, well suited to the\nReformation but even more so to the demands of the early modern\nstates, which needed better educated officials and manufacturers,\ncraftsmen and businessmen. Because Ramist logic made possible a more\nconcise presentation of different questions, it proved more\nadvantageous than scholasticism to Protestant theologians, who began\nto set out their doctrines in the form of loci or brief\npassages on a specific topic. Toward the end of the sixteenth century,\nseveral Protestant professors tried to combine the ideas of Ramus with\nthose of the Lutheran educational reformer Philipp Melanchthon\n(1497\u20131560).\n\nRamus appealed to statesmen and to humanists on account of his\nendeavors to promote the humanities, especially the study of ancient\nculture and languages. His anti-scholastic and anti-Aristotelian\noutbursts attracted other groups who, sometimes erroneously, regarded\nhim as an ally. The emphasis which he and other humanists laid on the\nusefulness of studies was a means to transform learned culture and\nadjust it to the new demands of modern states.\n\nFor the last 50 years Ramus has been at the center of considerable\nscholarly interest and activity. Modern scholars are divided on some\nbasic points. There are those such as Bruy\u00e8re-Robinet who strongly\ndisagree with Ong\u2019s disparaging opinion about Ramus as a philosopher\nand think instead that his departure from the Aristotelian tradition\nand all his writings stemmed from a Platonic ontological outlook,\nwhich he never abandoned. From such a point of view, Ramus was a\nconsistent philosopher and creator of a coherent system. Thus, his\ncensure of Aristotle was not directed only against scholastic abuse of\nAristotelianism.\n Other scholars, however, are not so sure on this point and have\nresearched Ramus from other perspectives. The focus has gradually\nshifted from examining Ramus\u2019 own works \u2014 even if several\nof his books have been edited, and various aspects of his textbooks,\nlectures and commentaries have been explored \u2014 to tracing their\nsignificance and influence.\nStudies have been devoted to his followers and to the political and\nsocial context in which he developed his ideas and not least to a\nbetter understanding of the impact his writings and his program had on\nthe education in early-modern Europe. We now know more about Ramus\u2019\nown pedagogical ideas and his radical ambition to reform higher\neducation, as well as his political outlook, at least in general\nterms. We also know that, contrary to early assumptions, his ideas did\nnot have a confessional impact. His pedagogical program was not\ncarried out primarily at Reformed universities. Undoubtedly, however,\nhis violent death made him into a martyr for the Reformers and even\nfor other Protestants. Indeed, it was not at old and well-established\nuniversities that professors lectured from the Ramist textbooks but\ninstead at poorer and less renowned schools such as gymnasia\nor gymnasia illustria. From this perspective, the importance\nof Ramus\u2019 program cannot be overestimated. In small Hanseatic cities\nand imperial counties and principalities, it became possible, thanks\nto the Ramist curriculum, to found schools and teach young students,\nin an adequate way, to fulfill a variety of future positions. Of\ncourse, the new pedagogical forms and syllabuses were not well\nreceived by everyone in the republic of learning. As has already been\nnoted, the humanists had difficulties accepting such condensed studies\nof classical literature, and anyone interested in digging deep into\nphilosophical problems was likely to find concise Ramist summaries\ninsufficient. As Hotson had demonstrated, this resistance did not\ndefeat the impact of the Ramist textbooks, but it did change it. At\nthe end of the 16th century, several authors and professors tried to\ncombine Ramist doctrine and the best of his ideas with a more thorough\noutline of Aristotelian philosophy, in order to produce a kind of\ncompendium or systematized presentation from which students could\nefficiently benefit in a relatively short space of time. Instead of\nspending several years reading Aristotle\u2019s treatises, lengthy\ncommentaries or other ancient texts, a host of poor university\nstudents could study the Ramist compendia which replaced these\nworks. This sometimes makes it difficult to decide if a certain author\nshould be categorized as a Ramist, a semi-Ramist or\na Philippo-Ramist; but Wilson has suggested a conceivable way\nto determine if a logical textbook puts forward what she identifies as\na more Aristotelian logic of stasis or rather, in the Ramist manner, a\nlogic of dynamism. With the latter Wilson means a focusing on the\nmoving parts of logic like verbs rather than on nouns which the\nAristotelian textbooks seemed to prefer. She demonstrates a short way\nto arbitrate which of the two practices gain the upper hand by looking\non the system of chapters in the textbooks, of which those more\ncharacteristic of Aristotelianism begin with the predicables\nand the predicaments while the Ramist ones rather start\nwith inventio and then the headings cause, form, end and\neffect and so on. The inclination to either dynamism or stasis would\nthen be discernible even in all those textbooks that in a different\nextent were mixtures of a Ramist and an Aristotelian logic (Wilson\n2019; cf. Feingold 2001 & Freedman 1993).\nStudies of Ramus\u2019 influence on learned and pedagogical programs\nhave been devoted to his many adherents in early modern Europe and to\nthe different circumstances in which these individuals developed his\ncurriculum. In Northern and Central Europe, Ramus\u2019 textbooks, both in\nLatin and in the vernacular, were frequently used and admired but they\nalso aroused resistance (Reid and Wilson 2011; Knight and Wilson\n2019).\nThere is also an increasing scholarly concentration on the\ninfluence of Ramus and Ramism on vernacular literature. The famous\n1555 edition of his dialectic in French was followed by others in\nvarious different vernaculars. And by employing the vernacular the\nworks of the Pl\u00e9iade and of Ramus converged in Paris. Even\nthough scholars have tried to find more substantial links to the\nPl\u00e9iade in other fields, few have been found. Frequent studies\non grammar and in particular on Ramus\u2019 and Talon\u2019s many rhetoric\ntextbooks have encouraged studies and debates about their impact on\nliterature and culture. Inspired by Tuve\u2019s classic work on\nmetaphysical imagery, scholars have discussed what consequence of\nRamus\u2019 putting the arts of rhetoric and dialectic into common practice\nmay have had.\nAnother controversy concerns Ramus\u2019 impact on literature and the\nhumanities. Grafton and Jardine have argued that Ramism meant a step\naway from humanism toward a kind of pragmatism; but against these\nconclusions, Henderson has maintained that even if Ramus wanted to\nachieve too much with his one method, his ambition had been to\nunite rhetoric with philosophy, including moral philosophy. On\nthe other hand, Sharratt has pinpointed Ramus\u2019 lack of literary\nsensibility as a reason why he never succeeded in making his philosophy\na part of the humanist tradition. At English educational institutions,\nRamism often was considered a threat to the humanities (Grafton &\nJardine 1986, Henderson 1999, Couzinet 2015, Sharratt 1976 &\nFeingiold 2001).\n",
