    "main_text": "Semantic representation || Which semantics in practice?\n3.4 Which semantics in practice?\n\nHaving surveyed three rather different brands of semantics, we are\nleft with the question of which of these brands serves best in\ncomputational linguistic practice. It should be clear from what has\nbeen said above that the choice of semantic \u201ctool\u201d will depend on the\ncomputational goals of the practitioner. If the goal, for example, is\nto create a dialogue-based problem-solving system for circuit fault\ndiagnosis, emergency response, medical contingencies, or vacation\nplanning, then an approach based on logical (or at least symbolic)\nrepresentations of the dialogue, underlying intentions, and relevant\nconstraints and knowledge is at present the only viable option. Here it\nis of less importance whether the symbolic representations are based on\nsome presumed logical semantics for language, or some theory of mental\nrepresentation\u2014as long as they are representations that can be\nreasoned with. The most important limitations that disqualify\nsubsymbolic and statistical representations of meaning for such\npurposes are their very limited inferential reach and response\ncapabilities. They provide classifications or one-shot inferences\nrather than reasoning chains, and they do not generate plans,\njustifications, or extended linguistic responses. However, both neural\nnet techniques and statistical techniques can help to improve semantic\nprocessing in dialogue systems, for example by disambiguating word\nsenses,  or recognizing which of several standard plans is being\nproposed or followed, on the basis of observed utterances or actions.\nOn the other hand, if the computational goal is to demonstrate\nhuman-like performance in a biologically plausible (or biologically\nvalid!) model of some form of language-related behavior, such as\nlearning to apply words correctly to perceived objects or\nrelationships, or learning to judge concept similarity, or to assess\nthe tone (underlying sentiment) of a discourse segment, then symbolic\nrepresentations need not play any role in the computational modeling.\n(However, to the extent that language is symbolic, and is a cognitive\nphenomenon, subsymbolic theories must ultimately explain how language\ncan come about.) In the case of statistical semantics, practical\napplications such as question-answering based on large textual\nresources, retrieval of documents relevant to a query, or machine\ntranslation are at present greatly superior to logical systems that\nattempt to fully understand both the query or text they are confronted\nwith and the knowledge they bring to bear on the task. But some of the\ntrends pointed out above in trying to link subsymbolic and statistical\nrepresentations with symbolic ones indicate that a gradual convergence\nof the various approaches to semantics is taking place.\n\n",
