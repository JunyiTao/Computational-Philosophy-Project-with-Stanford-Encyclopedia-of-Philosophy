    "main_text": "\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is an alternative to truth-condition\nsemantics. It is based on the fundamental assumption that the central\nnotion in terms of which meanings are assigned to certain expressions\nof our language, in particular to logical constants, is that of\nproof rather than truth. In this sense\nproof-theoretic semantics is semantics in terms of proof.\nProof-theoretic semantics also means the semantics of proofs,\ni.e., the semantics of entities which describe how we arrive at\ncertain assertions given certain assumptions. Both aspects of\nproof-theoretic semantics can be intertwined, i.e. the semantics of\nproofs is itself often given in terms of proofs.\n\nProof-theoretic semantics has several roots, the most specific one\nbeing Gentzen\u2019s remarks that the introduction rules in his\ncalculus of natural deduction define the meanings of logical\nconstants, while the elimination rules can be obtained as a\nconsequence of this definition (see section\n 2.2.1).\n More broadly, it belongs to what Prawitz called general proof\ntheory (see section\n 1.1).\n Even more broadly, it is part of the tradition according to which the\nmeaning of a term should be explained by reference to the way it is\nused in our language.\n\nWithin philosophy, proof-theoretic semantics has mostly figured under\nthe heading \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d. This terminology follows\nDummett, who claimed that the theory of meaning is the basis of\ntheoretical philosophy, a view which he attributed to Frege. The term\n\u201cproof-theoretic semantics\u201d was proposed by\nSchroeder-Heister (1991; used already in the 1980s in lectures in\nStockholm) in order not to leave the term \u201csemantics\u201d to\ndenotationalism alone\u2014after all, \u201csemantics\u201d is the\nstandard term for investigations dealing with the meaning of\nlinguistic expressions. Furthermore, unlike \u201ctheory of\nmeaning\u201d, the term \u201cproof-theoretic semantics\u201d\ncovers philosophical and technical aspects likewise. In 1999, the\nfirst conference with this title took place in T\u00fcbingen, the\nsecond and third in 2013 and 2019, respectively. Many others have\nfollowed at various places. The first textbook with this title\nappeared in 2015 (Francez 2015).\n",
