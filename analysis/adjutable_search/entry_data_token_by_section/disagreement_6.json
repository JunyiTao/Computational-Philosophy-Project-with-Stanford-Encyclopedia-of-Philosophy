    "main_text": "Peer Disagreements || The Steadfast View\n5.2 The Steadfast View\n\n\nOn the spectrum of views on the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement, the Equal Weight View and the Steadfast View lie on\nopposite ends. While the Equal Weight View is quite conciliatory, the\nSteadfast View maintains that sticking to one\u2019s guns in a case\nof peer disagreement can be rational. That is, discovering a peer\ndisagreement does not mandate any doxastic change. While the Equal\nWeight View may be seen to emphasize intellectual humility, the\nSteadfast View emphasizes having the courage of your convictions.\nDifferent motivations for Steadfast Views can be seen to reject\ndistinct aspects of the Equal Weight View. We have organized the\nvarious motivations for the Steadfast View according to which aspect\nof the Equal Weight View it (at least primarily) rejects.\n5.2.1 Denying Defeat\n\nDefeat has been rejected by defenders of the Steadfast View\nin a number of ways. First, Defeat has been denied with an\nappeal to private evidence. Peter van Inwagen (1996) has defended the\nSteadfast View by maintaining that in cases of peer disagreement one\ncan appeal to having an incommunicable insight or special evidence\nthat the other party lacks. The basic idea is that if I have access to\na special body of evidence that my peer lacks access to, then\nrealizing that my peer disagrees with me need not give me a reason to\nthink that I\u2019ve made any mistake. After all, my peer\ndoesn\u2019t have everything that I have to work with regarding an\nevaluation of \\(P\\) and it can be reasonable to think that if the peer\nwere to be aware of everything that I am aware of, she would also\nshare my opinion on the matter. Further, some evidence is undoubtedly\nprivate. While I can tell my peer about my intuitions or my\nexperiences, I cannot give him my intuitions or experiences. Given our\nlimitations, peers can never fully share their evidence. However, if\nthe evidence isn\u2019t fully shared, then my peer evaluating his\nevidence one way needn\u2019t show that I have mis-evaluated my\nevidence. Our evidence is importantly different. While van\nInwagen\u2019s claims may entail that the two disagreeing parties are\nnot actually peers due to their evidential differences, these\nconsideration may be used to resist Defeat at least on looser\nconceptions of peerhood that do not require evidential equality.\n\n\nA related argument is made by Huemer (2011), who argues for an\nagent-centered account of evidence. On this account, an experience\nbeing your own evidentially counts for more than someone\nelse\u2019s experience. So, with this conception of evidence in hand\nthere will be an important evidential asymmetry even in cases where\nboth parties share all their evidence.\n\n\nDefenders of the Equal Weight View have noted that these\nconsiderations cut both ways (see Feldman 2006). For\ninstance, while you may not be able to fully share your evidence with\nyour peer, these same considerations motivate that your peer similarly\ncannot fully share his or her evidence with you. So, the symmetry that\nmotivated the Equal Weight View may still obtain since both parties\nhave private evidence. A relevant asymmetry only obtains if one has\nspecial reason to believe that their body of private evidence is\nprivileged over their peer\u2019s, and the mere fact that it is\none\u2019s own would not do this. Feldman\u2019s Dean on the Quad\ncase can also help make this clear.\n\nDean on the Quad. \nSuppose you and I are standing by the window looking out on the\nquad. We think we have comparable vision and we know each other to be\nhonest. I seem to see what looks to me like the dean standing out in\nthe middle of the quad. (Assume that this is not something odd.\nHe\u2019s out there a fair amount.) I believe that the dean is\nstanding on the quad. Meanwhile, you seem to see nothing of the kind\nthere. You think that no one, and thus not the dean, is standing in\nthe middle of the quad. We disagree. Prior to our saying anything,\neach of us believes reasonably. Then I say something about the\ndean\u2019s being on the quad, and we find out about our\nsituation. (2007, 207\u2013208.)\n\n\nFeldman takes this case to be one where both parties should\nsignificantly conciliate even though it is clear that both possess\nprivate evidence. While both parties can report about their\nexperience, neither party can give their experience to the other. The\nexperiential evidence possessed by each party is private. So, if\nconciliation is still called for, we have reason to question the\nsignificance of private evidence.\n\n\nSecond, Defeat has been denied by focusing on how things seem\nto the subject. Plantinga (2000a) has argued that there is a sense of\njustification that is simply doing the best that one can. Plantinga\nnotes that despite all the controlled variables an important asymmetry\nremains even in cases of peer disagreement. In cases where I believe\n\\(P\\) and I discover that my peer disbelieves \\(P\\), often \\(P\\) will\ncontinue to seem true to me. That is, there is an important\nphenomenological difference between the two peers\u2014different\nthings seem true to them. Plantinga claims that given that we are\nfallible epistemic creatures some amount of epistemic risk is\ninevitable, and given this, we can do no better than believe in\naccordance with what seems true to us. So, applied to cases of peer\ndisagreement, even upon learning that my peer disbelieves \\(P\\), so\nlong as \\(P\\) continues to seem true to me, it is rational for me to\ncontinue to believe. Any reaction to the disagreement will contain\nsome epistemic risk, so I might as well go with how things seem to\nme. A similar defense of Steadfast Views which emphasizes the\nphenomenology of the subject can be found in Henderson et\nal. 2017.\n\n\nWhile an individual may not be to blame for continuing to believe as\nthings seem to them, defenders of the Equal Weight View have claimed\nthat the notion of epistemic justification at issue here is distinct. Sometimes doing the best one can is insufficient, and\nwhile some epistemic risk is inevitable, it does not follow that the\noptions are equally risky. While your belief may still seem true to\nyou having discovered the disagreement, other things that seem true to\nyou are relevant as well. For instance, it will seem to you that your\ninterlocutor is an epistemic peer (that they are in an equally good\nepistemic position on the matter) and that they disagree with you.\nThose additional seeming states have epistemological import. In\nparticular, they give you reason to doubt that the truth about the\ndisputed belief is as it seems to you. The mere fact that your belief\ncontinues to seem true to you is unable to save its justificatory\nstatus. Consider the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo most, line \\(B\\) seems to be longer, but a careful measurement\nreveals that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are of equal lengths. Despite knowing of\nthe illusion, however, line \\(B\\) continues to seem longer to many.\nNevertheless, given that it also seems that a reliable measuring\nindicates that the lines are of equal length, one is not justified in\nbelieving that \\(B\\) is longer, despite it continuing to seem that\nway. This result holds even when we appreciate our fallibility and\nthe fallibility of measuring instruments. A parallel account appears\nto apply to cases of peer disagreement. Even if your original belief\ncontinues to seem true to you, you have become aware of information\nthat significantly questions that seeming state. Further, we can\nimagine a scenario where \\(P\\) seems true to me and I subsequently\ndiscover 10,000 peers and superiors on the issue that disagree with me\nabout \\(P\\).  Nevertheless, when I contemplate \\(P\\), it still seems\ntrue to me. In such a case, sticking to my guns about \\(P\\) seems to\nneither be doing the best that I can nor the reasonable thing to\ndo.\n\n\nThird, Defeat has been denied by denying that peer opinions about\n\\(P\\) are evidence that pertains to \\(P\\). Kelly (2005) distinguishes\nthe following three claims:\n\nProposition \\(P\\) is true.\nBody of evidence \\(E\\) is good evidence that\n\\(P\\) is true.\nA competent peer believes \\(P\\) on the basis\nof \\(E\\).\n\n\n\nKelly (2005) argues that while 3 is evidence for 2 it is not evidence\nfor 1. If 3 is not evidence for 1, then in learning 3 (by discovering\nthe peer disagreement) one does not gain any evidence relevant to the\ndisputed proposition. If learning of the peer disagreement\ndoesn\u2019t affect one\u2019s evidence relevant to the disputed\nproposition, then such a discovery makes no change for which doxastic\nattitude is justified for the peers to take toward the target\nproposition. On this view, the discovery of peer disagreement makes no\ndifference for what you should believe about the disputed\nproposition.\n\n\nWhy think that 3 is not evidence for 1? Kelly (2005) cites several\nreasons. First, when people cite their justification for their\nbeliefs, they do not typically cite things like 3. We typically treat\nthe fact that someone believes a proposition as the result of\nthe evidence for that proposition, not as another piece of\nevidence for that proposition. Second, since people form beliefs on\nthe basis of a body of evidence, to count their belief as yet another\npiece of evidence would amount to double-counting that original body\nof evidence. On this line of thought, one\u2019s belief that \\(P\\)\nserves as something like a place-holder for the evidence upon which\none formed the belief. So, to count both the belief and the original\nevidence would be to double-count the original evidence, and\ndouble-counting is not a legitimate way of counting.\n\n\nDefenders of the Equal Weight View have responded by claiming that the\nimpropriety in citing one\u2019s own belief as evidence for the\nproposition believed can be explained in ways that do not require that\none\u2019s belief is not in fact evidence. For instance, it could be\nthat conversational maxims would be violated since the fact that one\nbelieves the proposition is already understood to be the case by the\nother party. Alternatively, citing one\u2019s own belief as evidence\nmay exhibit hubris in a way that many would want to avoid. Finally, it\nseems clear that someone else\u2019s belief that \\(P\\) can be\nevidence for \\(P\\), so denying that the subject\u2019s belief can be\nevidence for the subject entails a kind of relativity of evidence that\nsome reject.  Regarding the double-counting, it has been argued that\nthe fact that a reliable evidential evaluator has evaluated a body of\nevidence to support a proposition is a new piece of evidence, one that\nat least enhances the support between the body of evidence and the\ntarget proposition. For instance, that a forensic expert evaluates the\nrelevant forensic evidence to support the defendant\u2019s guilt\nappears to be an additional piece of evidence in favor of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt, rather than a mere repetition of that initial\nforensic evidence.\n\n\nFinally, Defeat has been denied by appealing to epistemic\npermissiveness. The Equal Weight View, and Defeat in\nparticular, has been thought to rely on the Uniqueness Thesis.\n\nUniqueness Thesis: For any body of evidence, \\(E\\),\nand proposition, \\(P\\), \\(E\\) justifies at most one competitor\ndoxastic attitude toward \\(P\\).\n\n\nIf a body of evidence can only support one doxastic attitude between\nbelief, disbelief, and suspension of judgment with respect to \\(P\\),\nand two people who share their evidence disagree about \\(P\\), then one\nof them must have an unjustified attitude. So, if the Uniqueness\nThesis is true, there is a straightforward route\nto Defeat. However, if evidence is permissive, allowing for\nmultiple distinct justified attitudes toward the same proposition,\nthen discovering that someone has evaluated your shared evidence\ndifferently than you have need not give you any reason to think that\nyou have made a mistake. If evidence is permissive, then you may both\nhave justified responses to the shared evidence even though you\ndisagree. So, another way to motivate the Steadfast View is to endorse\nevidential permissiveness. For reasons to reject or doubt the\nUniqueness Thesis, see Ballantyne and Coffman 2011, Conee 2009,\nFrances 2014, Goldman 2010, Kelly 2010, Kopec 2015, Raleigh 2017,\nRosen 2001, and Rosa 2012.\n\n\nDefenses of the Equal Weight View either defend the Uniqueness Thesis\n(see Dogramici and Horowitz 2016, Greco and Hedden 2016, Matheson\n2011, White 2005, White 2013) or argue that the Equal Weight View is\nnot actually committed to evidential uniqueness (see Christensen 2009,\nChristensen 2016, Cohen 2013, Lee 2003, Levinstein 2017, Peels and\nBooth 2014, and Henderson et al 2017).\n5.2.2 Denying Equal Weight\n\n\nThe Steadfast View has also been motivated by denying Equal\nWeight. If your peer\u2019s opinion about \\(P\\) does not count\nfor as much as your own opinion, then you may not need to make any\ndoxastic conciliation. While most find it implausible that your own\nopinion can count for more merely because it is your own, a related\nand more plausible defense comes from appealing to self-trust. Enoch\n(2010), Foley (2001), Pasnau (2015), Schafer (2015), Wedgwood (2007;\n2010), and Zagzebski (2012) have all appealed to self-trust in\nresponding to peer disagreements. Foley emphasizes the essential and\nineliminable role of first-personal reasoning. Applied to cases of\ndisagreement, Foley claims, \u201cI am entitled to make what I can of\nthe conflict using the faculties, procedures, and opinions I have\nconfidence in, even if these faculties, procedures, and opinions are\nthe very ones being challenged by others\u201d (2001, 79). Similarly,\nWedgwood asserts that it is rational to have a kind of egocentric\nbias\u2014a fundamental trust in one\u2019s own faculties and mental\nstates. On this account, while peer disagreements have a kind of\nsymmetry from the third-person perspective, neither party occupies\nthat perspective.  Rather, each party to the disagreement has a\nfirst-person perspective from which it is rational to privilege\nitself. Self-trust is fundamental and the trust that one must place in\none\u2019s own faculties and states simply cannot be given to\nanother.\n\n\nOpponents have rejected the epistemic importance of the first-person\nperspective (see Bogardus 2013b and Rattan 2014). While\nthe first-person perspective is ineliminable, it is not infallible.\nFurther, there are reasons from the first-person perspective to make\ndoxastic conciliation. It is my evidence the supports that my\ninterlocutor is my peer and my evidence about what she\nbelieves which call for doxastic change. So, conciliation can be seen\nto be called for from within the first-person perspective. One\nneedn\u2019t, and indeed cannot, abandon one\u2019s own perspective\nin dealing with disagreement. There are also worries concerning what\nsuch an emphasis on self-trust would permit. If self-trust is relevant\nin cases of peer disagreement, it is difficult to see how it is not\nrelevant in cases of novice-expert disagreement. However, most\nmaintain that when the novice learns that the expert disagrees he\nshould make some doxastic movement if not completely defer. So,\nself-trust cannot be the ultimate deciding factor in all cases of\ndisagreement.\n5.2.3 The Right Reasons View\n\n\nA final motivation for the Steadfast View comes from re-evaluating the\nevidential support relations in a case of peer disagreement. It will\nbe helpful here to distinguish between two kinds of evidence.\n\n\nFirst-Order Evidence: First-order evidence for \\(P\\) is evidence\nthat directly pertains to \\(P\\).\n\nHigher-Order Evidence: Higher-order evidence for \\(P\\) is evidence\nabout one\u2019s evidence for \\(P\\).\n\n\n\nSo, the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, and the\nproblem of evil are all items of first-order evidence regarding\nGod\u2019s existence, whereas the fact that a competent evaluator of\nsuch evidence finds it to on balance support God\u2019s existence is a\npiece of higher-order evidence that God exists. That a competent\nevidential evaluator has evaluated a body of evidence to support a\nproposition is evidence that the body of evidence in question does in\nfact support that proposition.\n\n\nApplied to cases of peer disagreement, the first-order evidence is\nthe evidence directly pertaining to the disputed proposition, and each\npeer opinion about the disputed proposition is the higher-order\nevidence (it is evidence that the first-order evidence supports the\nrespective attitudes).\n\n\nThe Right Reasons View is a steadfast view of peer disagreement that\nemphasizes the role of the shared first-order evidence in peer\ndisagreements. Following Kelly (2005) we can represent the discovery of\na peer disagreement as follows:\n\nAt \\(t\\), my body of evidence consists of \\(E\\) (the original first-order\nevidence for \\(P\\)).\nAt \\(t'\\), having discovered the peer disagreement, my body of\nevidence consists of the following:\n\n  \n\\(E\\) (the original first-order evidence for \\(P\\)).\nThe fact that I am competent and believe \\(P\\) on the basis of \n\\(E\\).\nThe fact that my peer is competent and believes not-\\(P\\) on the \nbasis of \\(E\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Right Reasons View, the two pieces of higher-order\nevidence (ii) and (iii) are to be accorded equal weight. Having\nweighed (ii) and (iii) equally, they neutralize in my total body of\nevidence at t\u2019. However, with (ii) and (iii) neutralized, I am\nleft with (i) and am justified in believing what (i) supports. The\nRight Reasons View then notes that what I am justified in believing at\n\\(t\\) and what I am justified in believing at t\u2019 is exactly the\nsame. In both cases what I should believe is entirely a matter of what\n\\(E\\) supports, so what matters in a case of peer disagreement is what\nthe first-order evidence supports. If I believed in accordance with my\nevidence at \\(t\\), then learning of the peer disagreement does nothing\nto alter what I should believe about \\(P\\) at \\(t_2\\). Having rightly\nresponded to my reasons at \\(t\\), nothing epistemically changes\nregarding what attitude I should have toward \\(P\\).\n\n\nThis argument for the Right Reasons View has been responded to in\nseveral ways. Kelly (2010) has since rejected the argument, claiming\nthat when a greater proportion of one\u2019s evidence supports\nsuspending judgment some conciliation will be called for. Since the\nhigher-order evidence calls for suspending judgment regarding the\ndisputed proposition, there will be a conciliatory push even if the\noriginal first order evidence still plays an important role in what\nattitude is justified. Others have responded to the argument by\nrejecting Kelly\u2019s original description of the case (see Matheson\n2009). If my evidence at \\(t\\) includes not only the first-order\nevidence, but also the higher-order evidence about myself (ii), then\neven if the new piece of higher-order evidence gained at \\(t'\\),\n(iii), cancels out (ii) this will still call for some doxastic\nconciliation from \\(t\\) to \\(t'\\). Alternatively, (ii) and (iii) can\nbe seen to together call for a suspension of judgment over whether\n\\(E\\) supports \\(P\\). Some have argued that a justified suspension of\njudgment over whether your evidence supports \\(P\\) has it that your\ntotal evidence supports a suspension of judgment toward \\(P\\) (see\nFeldman 2006 and Matheson 2015a). See Lasonen-Aarnio 2014 for an\nalternative view of the impact of higher-order evidence.\n\n\nA more recent defense of the Right Reasons View is found in\nTitelbaum 2015. Titelbaum argues for the Fixed Point Thesis \u2013\nthat mistakes about rationality are mistakes of rationality. In other\nwords, it is always a rational mistake to have a false belief about\nrationality. So, on this view a false belief about what attitude is\nrational does not \u2018trickle down\u2019 to affect the rationality\nof the lower-level belief. Given this, if an individual\u2019s initial\nresponse to the evidence is rational, no amount of misleading\nhigher-order evidence affects the rationality of that belief. A correct\nresponse to the first-order evidence remains correct regardless of what\nhigher-order evidence is added.\n\n\nA remaining problem for the Right Reasons View is its verdicts in\nparadigm cases of peer disagreement. Many have the strong intuition\nthat conciliation is the Restaurant Check Case regardless of whether\nyou correctly evaluated the first-order evidence.\n",
