    "main_text": "QBism || Measurement\n1.3 Measurement\n\nThose who believe that a quantum state completely describes the system\nto which it is assigned and that this state always evolves linearly\n(e.g., according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation) face the notorious\nquantum measurement problem: Application of quantum theory to the\ninteraction between a quantum system and a quantum measuring device\nwould almost always leave these in a state that describes the\nmeasurement as having no outcome, contrary to the direct experience of\ncountless experimentalists (see entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory,\n \u00a74).\n\nSome have followed Dirac (1930) and von Neumann (1932) in assuming\nthat a measurement is a physical process in which a quantum state\nalmost never evolves linearly but rather changes discontinuously and\nstochastically into one of a variety of possible states, each of which\nmay describe its outcome. But attempts to state precisely when such a\nprocess occurs and to verify its occurrence experimentally have been\nunsuccessful, and many understand quantum theory as excluding its\noccurrence.\n\nQBists avoid this problem by denying that a quantum state (even\nincompletely) describes the system to which it assigned. Any user of\nquantum theory assigns his or her personal quantum state on the basis\nof available information, subject only to the normative constraints of\nquantum-Bayesian coherence. This state assignment need conform neither\nto \u201cthe way that system really is\u201d, nor to the state\nassignments of other users. Quantum mechanics is a single user theory,\nand any coincidence among states assigned by different users is just\nthat\u2014coincidence. An agent may reassign a state on the basis of\nnewly acquired information, perhaps described as observation of the\noutcome of a measurement. When this happens, the new state is often\nnot continuous with the old state. This represents no physical\ndiscontinuity associated with measurement, but merely reflects the\nagent\u2019s updated epistemic state in the light of experience.\n\nNevertheless, in certain circumstances different users may be expected\nto come to assign similar or even identical quantum states by updating\ntheir prior credences to take account of common (though never\nidentical) experiences, some of which each may describe as experiences\nof the outcomes of quantum measurements on systems. Because QBists\ntake the quantum state to have the role of representing an\nagent\u2019s epistemic state they may avail themselves of personalist\nBayesian arguments purporting to show the convergence of priors on\nupdating in the light of common information. Also, just as de Finetti\nshowed that a subjectivist agent\u2019s credences may evolve as if\nrefining estimates of an unknown objective probability, QBists (Caves,\nFuchs, and Schack 2002b) have shown that the credences of a user of\nquantum theory may evolve as if refining his or her assignment of an\nunknown objective quantum state.\n\nJ.S. Bell (2004) argued forcefully that the word\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d has no place in a formulation of quantum\nmechanics with any pretension to physical precision. QBists frequently\nuse this word in formulating their view, but unlike Bohr and his\nCopenhagen followers they do not think of a measurement as a purely\nphysical process, but as describing an agent\u2019s action on the\nworld that results in a specific experience of it. They view quantum\ntheory not as offering descriptions of the world involving the\nimprecise physical term \u201cmeasurement\u201d, but as an\nintellectual tool for helping its users interact with the world to\npredict, control, and understand their experiences of it. Fuchs (2010,\n Other Internet Resources)\n and Mermin (2017) are quite explicit and unapologetic that a\nthoroughgoing QBist presentation of quantum theory would speak of\nagents, their actions and their experiences\u2014all primitive terms\nthey take neither to require nor to admit of precise physical\nspecification.\n",
