    "main_text": "Skeptical Ideas in Early and Classical Greek Philosophy || Aristotle\n2.3 Aristotle\n\nAristotle engages, at several points in his works, with the\nMeno Problem. For example, Aristotle points out that, for\nsuccessful investigation to proceed, one first needs a well-formulated\nquestion. One needs to know the knot in order to untie it. In order to\nknow what to look for and recognize it when one finds it, one needs to\nfirst think one\u2019s way through the difficulties involved, and\nthereby formulate a question. If one does, then one shall be able to\nrecognize the solution once one hits upon it (Met. 3.1,\n995a24\u2013b4). These ideas are highly relevant to Hellenistic\ndiscussions. The skeptic is an investigator, and one anti-skeptical\ncharge says that, if indeed a skeptic knew nothing, they could not\neven formulate the questions they investigate. Interpreters have\nemphasized a contrast between Aristotle and the skeptics. For\nAristotle, formulating puzzles and thinking one\u2019s way through\nthem puts one in a better position, such that one gets clear about how\nmatters are. This may be different for the skeptics: engagement with\ndifferent angles of philosophical problems leads them to suspension of\njudgment (Long 2006, Code 2010). Other scholars argue that the\nskeptics\u2019 way of thinking through puzzles improves their\ncognitive condition even though they do not settle for an answer to a\ngiven question (Vogt 2012a, ch. 5). Also, scholars point to modes of\nthinking in Plato and Aristotle that are not primarily concerned with\nresults. In contemplation, a cognizer may think again and again\nthrough the same kinds of matters, and yet doing so presumably\nimproves their cognitive condition (Olfert 2014).\n\nIn Posterior Analytics I.1, Aristotle says that all teaching\nand learning comes about through things we already know. When we\nphrase questions, we already have \u2018That-Knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018What-Knowledge.\u2019 For example, when we ask questions about\ntriangles, we need to know that there are triangles (otherwise we\nwould not have questions about their properties). We also need to have\na notion of what triangles are (we draw a triangle, not a square, when\nwe phrase a question about its properties). Another way in which\nAristotle addresses the Meno Problem conceives of particular\nperceptions as the starting-points of investigation. Complex cognitive\nactivities arise from simpler ones. Many particular perceptions lead\nto memory, to experience, and eventually to expert understanding\n(Met. 1.1, An. Post. II.19). With the\ngeneralizations of memory, experience, and expertise comes the ability\nto investigate. With respect to skepticism, the important point here\nis that the starting-points of investigation are not themselves in\nneed of justification.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle engages with the Protagorean claim that, as\nAristotle puts it, all seemings (dokounta) and appearances\n(phainomena) are true (Met 4.5). If this were so,\nAristotle says, everything would have to be true and false at the same\ntime. Aristotle argues that earlier thinkers arrived at such views\nbecause they identified being solely with the perceptual (4.5,\n1010a1\u20133). Caught up in this assumption, they did not see who or\nwhat was going to judge between conflicting sense perceptions. For\nexample, it seemed unsatisfactory to dismiss the views of sick and mad\npeople simply on the grounds that they are in the minority, thereby\nconsidering as true what appears to the greater number of people.\nSimilarly, Aristotle reports that these earlier thinkers looked at the\nways in which things appear differently to different kinds of living\nbeings, and to one person at different times (4.5,\n1099b1\u201311).\n\nIn Metaphysics 4.4, Aristotle notes that some people consider\nit possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and for someone to\nbelieve so (he refers to a range of positions, all of which in some\nway are related to denial of the Principle of Non-Contradiction; see\nCastagnoli 2010, I.5.4). Against this, Aristotle says it is the\nfirmest of principles that things cannot be and not be at the same\ntime. To deny this shows a lack of training. With adequate training,\none recognizes for which things proof should be sought, and for which\nit ought not to be sought (see also An. Post. I.3). It is\nimpossible that there be demonstration for everything. Otherwise\ndemonstration would go on ad infinitum. Scholars often refer\nto this point when discussing the skeptical modes of argument. The\nskeptics might be guilty of what, from Aristotle\u2019s perspective,\nwould be a mistake of exactly this kind (on this theme in later\nAristotelian logic, cf. Malink 2020).\n\nAristotle continues in a way that is highly relevant to discussions of\nskeptical language and action. A person who wishes to deny that things\ncannot be and not be at the same time has two options. Either they say\nnothing, or they talk to us. In the first case, there is no need for\nus to refute them. This person is like a plant\u2014they do not talk.\nIn the second case, either their utterance signifies something, or it\nsignifies nothing. If it signifies something, then they say that\nsomething is so-and-so (which Aristotle takes to be self-defeating for\nthem). If it signifies nothing, then it does not qualify as speech.\nEven though they make an utterance, the person is in effect not\nspeaking with us (or to themselves). Aristotle also explains the\nplant-metaphor in terms of action (1008b10-30). A person who believes\nnothing is like a plant because they cannot act. Pursuit and avoidance\ntestify to the fact that people have beliefs. (On Aristotle and\nskepticism, see the papers collected in Irwin 1995.)\n",
