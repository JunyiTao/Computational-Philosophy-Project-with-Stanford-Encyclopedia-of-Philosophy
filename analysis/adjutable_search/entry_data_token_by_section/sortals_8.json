The kitten does not go out of existence when it becomes\nadult, but it is no longer a kitten. Evaluating (5) is very difficult\nsince there is no consensus on whether kinds have essences (Quine\nwould say \u201cnone\u201d) and there is no consensus among those\nwho assert the existence of essences as to what they are. Contemporary versions of sortal essentialism provide a possible solution to these problems, particularly the theories of Brody (1980) and Wiggins (1967, 1980, and 2001). Another possible influential solution is offered by the essentialism of origin, such as the one proposed in Forbes (1985) or Salmon (1981) (for a discussion of these theories, see Robertson (1998, 2000)). Minimalist essentialism (Mackie 2006) is an alternative to those two forms of essentialism.\n\nIn a different direction, Wiggins in his later writings gives examples\nto show that criteria of individuation and persistence are\ninsufficient to count objects under a sortal, and thus some\nexpressions meet conditions 3\u20135 but\nnot 1\u20132.\n\n\n\u2026the concept crown gives a satisfactory way of answering\nidentity-questions for crowns. But there is no universally applicable\ndefinite way of counting crowns. The Pope\u2019s crown is made of\ncrowns. There is no definite answer, when the Pope is wearing his\ncrown, to the question \u201chow many crowns does he have on his head\u201d\n(1980: 73; 2001: 75)\n\n\nIn a footnote to the same pages, Wiggins gives a list of other\nexamples of terms which permit individuation but not counting:\n\u201cwave, volume of fluid, worm, garden, crystal, piece of string,\nword-token, machine\u201d. Wiggins continues by explaining that, on\nhis view, his account does not disagree with Strawson\u2019s but\ncorrects and enlarges it (2001: 75). We find it puzzling that Wiggins\ndismisses \u201canimal\u201d as a sortal but is willing to include\n\u201cmachine\u201d which seems at least as problematic\n",
