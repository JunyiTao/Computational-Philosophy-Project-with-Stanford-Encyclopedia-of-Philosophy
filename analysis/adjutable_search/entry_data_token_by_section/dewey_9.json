    "main_text": "Experience and Metaphysics || The Development of \u201cExperience\u201d\n3.1 The Development of \u201cExperience\u201d\n\nDewey\u2019s notion of \u201cexperience\u201d evolved over the\ncourse of his career. Initially, it contributed to his idealism and\npsychology. After he developed instrumentalism in Chicago during the\n1890\u2019s, Dewey moved to Columbia, revising and expanding the\nconcept in 1905 with a historically significant essay, \u201cThe\nPostulate of Immediate Empiricism\u201d (PIE, MW3). Further\ndevelopments show up in \u201cThe Subject-matter of Metaphysical\nInquiry\u201d (1915, MW8) and the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to\nEssays in Experimental Logic (1916, MW10) which consolidated\nand advanced his view that \u201cexperience\u201d was more than just\nway to rebut subjectivism in psychology, but was also factored into\nmetaphysical accounts of existence and nature (Dykhuizen 1973:\n175\u201376). Dewey\nadvanced this in the1923 Carus Lectures, revised and expanded in his\nmetaphysical magnum opus, Experience and Nature (1925,\nrevised edition, 1929; EN, LW1). Many other significant\nelaborations on experience follow, notably in Art as\nExperience (1934b, AE,\n LW10).[8]\n Because experience is pivotal across his philosophical oeuvre,\ninterested readers should track its functions in other sections of\nthis entry; here, experience is treated concisely, with a focus upon\nDewey\u2019s philosophical method and metaphysics.\n\nTo begin, why was experience such an important concept that it\npenetrated Dewey\u2019s very approach to philosophy? Keep three\ninfluences in mind. First, recall that Dewey inherited from Darwin the\nidea of nature as a complex congeries of changing, transactional\nprocesses without fixed ends; in this context, experience means the\nundergoing and doing of organisms-in-environments, \u201ca matter of\nfunctions and habits, of active adjustments and readjustments, of\ncoordinations and activities, rather than of states of\nconsciousness\u201d (\u201cA Short Catechism Concerning\nTruth\u201d, MW6: 5).  Second, recall that Dewey took from James a\nradically empirical approach to philosophy\u2014the insistence that\nperspectival experience, including that called personal,\nemotional, or temperamental, was philosophically\nrelevant and worth factoring into abstract and logical theories.\nFinally, recall that Dewey accepted from Hegel experience as\nmanifested in particular social, historical, and cultural modes. Not\nonly is the self constituted through experiential transactions with\nthe community, but this recognition vitiates the Cartesian model of\nthe simple, atomic self and methods based upon that presumption.\nPhilosophy may start where we start, personally\n\u2014 with complex, symbolic, and cultural forms\u2014and then\narticulate further emergences from them.\n\nThese three major influences, plus Dewey\u2019s own discoveries,\nconvinced him that \u201cexperience\u201d was the linch-pin to a\nbroader theory of nature and humanity\u2019s axiological place within\nit. More than just another node in a system, experience also amounted\nto a metaphilosophical method, a way of doing philosophy.\nWithin this Weltanschauung, philosophy was not a rational\nbridge to transcend life, but was equipment for living. Thus,\nclarifying what experience meant assumed the greatest importance,\ninsofar as this was vital to philosophy earning back its status as a\nwisdom which might aid survival, growth, and flourishing.\n\nIt should be noted that \u201cexperience\u201d, both as sheer\nterminology and as Dewey deployed the concept, generated much\nconfusion and debate. Dewey recognized this and commented about it\ntoward the end of his\n life.[9]\n Decades later, one of the Dewey\u2019s foremost philosophical\ncelebrants, Richard Rorty, lambasted Dewey for both the term and (what\nRorty perceived as) Dewey\u2019s\n intentions.[10]\n (Rorty 1977, 1995, 2006)\nNevertheless, since the term lives on, both in Dewey\u2019s work and\nin everyday discourse, it deserves continued analysis.\n",
