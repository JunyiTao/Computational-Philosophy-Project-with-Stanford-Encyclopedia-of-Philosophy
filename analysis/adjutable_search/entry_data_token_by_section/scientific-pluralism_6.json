On the philosophical side, key\nissues are the benefits of disciplinary integration as well as\nepistemic, ontological, and social tensions of such integration\nprocesses.\n\nCooperation between scientists was already a central concern in the\nInternational Encyclopedia of Unified Science. For Neurath,\nthe motivation for connecting laws of different scientific fields was\nexplicitly practical. Taking the example of the control of a forest\nfire, he argues that a successful intervention requires connecting\nchemical, biological and sociological laws, and the unity of the\nlanguage of science was supposed to facilitate these connections\n(Neurath 1983). In his contribution to the Encyclopedia,\nDewey emphasizes the societal need for cooperation between scientists\nworking in different fields, calling for\n\n\nunifying the efforts of all those who exercise in their own affairs\nthe scientific methods so that these efforts may gain the force which\ncomes from united efforts. (Dewey 1938/1955: 32 [1988: 274])\n\n\nFor Dewey, this social form of connection between scientists was more\nimportant than unifying their language.\n\nIntegration of distinct disciplines may take various forms, depending\non the object of integration: explanations, models, experimental\nmethods, bodies of data, concepts, theoretical frameworks, instruments\nand tools, research infrastructures, etc. (Hacking 1992b; Rueger 2005;\nO\u2019Malley 2013; Grantham 2004). It is commonly assumed that\nintegration constitutes a standard of success of interdisciplinary\nendeavors (Holbrook 2013). However, this assumption has been\nchallenged on the ground that interdisciplinary success can sometimes\nbe achieved without integration of disciplines. Heterogenous actors\ncan cooperate in interdisciplinary \u201ctrading zones\u201d\n(Galison 1997) in which actors \u201chammer out a local coordination,\ndespite vast global differences\u201d (1997: 783). Case studies such\nas evolutionary game theory show that productive interdisciplinary\ninteractions can develop while fields keep developing distinct\nconcepts, methods, explanations, and ontologies (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff\n2016).\n\nAnother line of debate about interdisciplinary interactions relates to\n\u201cimperialist\u201d incursions of one discipline into other ones\n(M\u00e4ki 2013; Clarke & Walsh 2013). For example, economic and\nevolutionary models of human behavior are commonly criticized as\nimperialistic and inadequate attempts to expand the explanatory scope\nof models beyond their disciplinary boundaries. Evolutionary models of\ngender behavior constitute a prominent case as they run the risk of\nobscuring social negotiations of gender norms through a narrow focus\non evolutionary adaptations. Scientific pluralists commonly contrast\nsuch a scientific imperialism with inclusive perspectives on human\nbehavior that emphasize the value of diverse qualitative and\nquantitative methods from both social and natural sciences\n(Dupr\u00e9 2002; Longino 2013). At the same time, the distinction\nbetween inadequate scientific imperialism and productive\ninterdisciplinary exchange remains contested and allows for\nheterogenous formulations (M\u00e4ki, Walsh, & Fern\u00e1ndez\nPinto 2017).\n\nInteractions between academic and non-academic stakeholders have\nbecome another growing concern that is reflected in frameworks of\ntransdisciplinarity, citizen science, participatory research, public\nengagement, open science, and so on. The notion of transdisciplinary\nemerged in the 1970s (Jantsch 1972) and has been driven by policy\ndemands of research at the interface of science and society. For\nexample, a recent OECD report on 50 years of transdisciplinarity\nclaims a \u201cparadigm shift in research practice\u201d (2020: 9)\nthat orients research towards complex multi-stakeholder interactions\nin addressing equally complex challenges such as climate change, food\nsecurity, global health, and sustainable energy production.\nPhilosophers of science have more recently connected debates about\nscientific pluralism with transdisciplinary appeals to epistemic and\nsocial diversity (Koskinen & M\u00e4ki 2016). Epistemologically,\ntransdisciplinarity comes with opportunities of accessing novel\nsources of non-academic expertise but also raises complex questions\nabout vastly different methods of knowledge production between\nacademic and non-academic actors (Bedessem & Ruphy 2020; Gibbs\n2015). Politically, transdisciplinarity promises more inclusive\nresearch that reflects the concerns of heterogeneous stakeholders but\nalso often reproduces existing hierarchies and colonial legacies in\nthe relations between stakeholders and the organization collaborative\nprocesses (Healy 2019; Ludwig & El-Hani 2020).\n",
