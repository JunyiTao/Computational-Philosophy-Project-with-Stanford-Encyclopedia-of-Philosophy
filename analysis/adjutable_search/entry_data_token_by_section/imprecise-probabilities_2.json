    "main_text": "Introduction || Some important distinctions\n1.2 Some important distinctions\nThere are a number of distinctions that it is important to make in\nwhat follows.\nAn important parameter in an IP theory is the normative force the\ntheory is supposed to have. Is imprecision obligatory or is it merely\npermissible? Is it always permissible/obligatory, or only\nsometimes? Or we might be interested in a purely descriptive project\nof characterising the credal states of actual agents, with no interest\nin normative questions. This last possibility will concern us little\nin this article.\nIt is also helpful to distinguish belief itself from the\nelicitation of that belief and also from your introspective access to\nthose beliefs. The same goes for other attitudes (values, utilities\nand so on). It may be that you have beliefs that are not amenable to\n(precise) elicitation, in practice or even in principle. Likewise,\nyour introspective access to your own beliefs might be imperfect. Such\nimperfections could be a source of\nimprecision. Bradley (2009)\ndistinguishes many distinct sources of imperfect introspection. The\nimperfection could arise from your unawareness of the prospect in\nquestion, the boundedness of your reasoning, ignorance of relevant\ncontingencies, or because of conflict in your evidence or in your\nvalues (pp. 240\u2013241). See Bradley and\nDrechsler (2014) for further discussion of types of\nuncertainty.\nThere are a variety of aspects of a body of evidence that could\nmake a difference to how you ought to respond to it. We can\nask how much evidence there is (weight of evidence). We can\nask whether the evidence is balanced or whether it tells heavily in\nfavour of one hypothesis over another (balance of evidence). Evidence\ncan be balanced because it is incomplete: there simply isn\u2019t\nenough of it. Evidence can also be balanced if it\nis conflicted: different pieces of evidence favour different\nhypotheses. We can further ask whether evidence tells us\nsomething specific\u2014like that the bias of a coin is 2/3\nin favour of heads\u2014or unspecific\u2014like that the bias of a\ncoin is between 2/3 and 1 in favour of heads. This specificity should\nbe distinguished from vagueness or indeterminacy of evidence: that a\ncoin has bias about 2/3 is vague but specific, while that a\ncoin has bias definitely somewhere between 2/3 and 1 is determinate\nbut unspecific. Likewise, a credal state could be indeterminate,\nfuzzy, or it could be unspecific, or it could be both. It seems like\ndeterminate but unspecific belief states will be rarer than\nindeterminate ones.\nIsaac Levi (1974, 1985) makes a\ndistinction between \u201cimprecise\u201d credences and\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d credences (the scare quotes are indicating\nthat these aren\u2019t uses of the terms \u201cimprecise\u201d and\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d that accord with the usage I adopt in this\narticle). The idea is that there are two distinct kinds of belief\nstate that might require a move to an IP representation of belief. An\n\u201cimprecise\u201d belief in Levi\u2019s terminology is an imperfectly\nintrospected or elicited belief in mine, while an\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d belief is a (possibly) perfectly\nintrospected belief that is still indeterminate or unspecific (or\nboth). Levi argues that the interesting phenomenon is\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d credence. Walley\n(1991) also emphasises the distinction between cases where\nthere is a \u201ccorrect\u201d but unknown probability from cases of\n\u201cindeterminacy\u201d.\nThere is a further question about the interpretation of IP that\ncross-cuts the above. This is the question of whether we\nunderstand \\(P\\) as a \u201ccomplete\u201d\nor \u201cexhaustive\u201d representation of your beliefs, or whether\nwe take the representation to be incomplete or non-exhaustive. Let\u2019s\ntalk in terms of the betting interpretation for a moment. The\nexhaustive/non-exhaustive distinction can be drawn by asking the\nfollowing question: does \\(P\\) capture all\nand only your dispositions to bet or\ndoes \\(P\\) only partially capture your\ndispositions to bet? Walley emphasises this distinction and suggests\nthat most models are non-exhaustive.\nPartly because of Levi\u2019s injunction to distinguish\n\u201cimprecise\u201d from \u201cindeterminate\u201d belief, some\nhave objected to the use of the term \u201cimprecise\nprobability\u201d. Using the above distinction between indeterminate,\nunspecific and imperfectly introspected belief, we can keep separate\nthe categories Levi wanted to keep separate all without using the term\n\u201cimprecise\u201d. We can then use \u201cimprecise\u201d as an\numbrella term to cover all these cases of lack of\nprecision. Conveniently, this allows us to stay in line with the\nwealth of formal work on \u201cImprecise Probabilities\u201d which\nterm is used to cover cases of indeterminacy. This usage goes back at\nleast to Peter Walley\u2019s influential book Statistical Reasoning\nwith Imprecise Probabilities (Walley\n1991).\nSo, \u201cImprecise\u201d is not quite right, but neither is\n\u201cProbability\u201d since the formal theory of IP is really\nabout previsions (sort of expectations) rather than just\nabout probability (expectations of indicator functions). Helpfully, if\nI abbreviate Imprecise Probability to \u201cIP\u201d then I can\nexploit some useful ambiguities.\n",
