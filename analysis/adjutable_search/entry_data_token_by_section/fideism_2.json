    "main_text": "A Brief History of \u201cFideism\u201d || Sin, Skepticism, and Kant: Theological and Philosophical Roots\n2.1 Sin, Skepticism, and Kant: Theological and Philosophical Roots\n\nThe term \u201cfideism\u201d appears to have entered the\nphilosophical lexicon by way of theology in the late nineteenth\ncentury. It was originally used in reference to a movement within\nRoman Catholic thought, also known as traditionalism, which\nemphasized, over against rationalism, the role of tradition as the\nmedium by means of which divine revelation is communicated, and which\nwas sometimes conjoined with a conservative social and political\nagenda. Although of late modern vintage, the term\n\u201cfideism\u201d has since been applied retrospectively to\nthinkers at least as far back as the second century C.E.\n\nTertullian is frequently cited in this connection as a textbook\nfideist. Developing a theme articulated by Paul in his First Letter to\nthe Corinthians, Tertullian insisted that the truth of Christianity\ncould be disclosed only by revelation, and that it must necessarily\nremain opaque to unregenerate philosophical\n reason.[1]\n In an oft-quoted passage he maintains (against Marcion) that the\nBiblical narrative of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection \u201cis\nby all means to be believed, because it is absurd\u2026[T]he fact is\ncertain, because it is impossible\u201d (525).\n\nHowever, the conception of Tertullian as anti-rational is not\nsupported by contemporary scholarship. Contrary to popular belief,\nwhat Tertullian said is not credo quia absurdum but\ncredible est quia ineptum est. Tertullian\u2019s point seems\nto have been that the incarnation represents a paradox: salvation\nrequires both that God become human and that God remain wholly other.\nHis quarrel was not with reason per se, but with\nphilosophical hubris. Eric Osborne writes, \u201cNot only did he\nnever say \u2018credo quia absurdum\u2019, but he never\nmeant anything like it and never abandoned the claims of Athens upon\nJerusalem\u201d (28). Tertullian, Osborne concludes, was a\n\u201cmost improbable fideist\u201d (29).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, efforts to reconcile Christian doctrine with\nAristotelian logic \u2013 newly reintroduced into European thought via\nthe translation of Aristotle\u2019s corpus from Greek and\nArabic \u2013 gave rise to a family of positions that Sheila Delany\ngroups together under the label \u201cskeptical fideism.\u201d By\ndistinguishing the revealed truths of the Christian religion, which\ncan be accepted only via what they posited as a distinct faculty of\nfaith, from the knowledge-claims to which the dialectical method is\nrelevant, thirteenth-century thinkers like Boetius of Dacia and his\ncolleague Siger de Brabant sought a theo-philosophico rapprochement\n(Delany, 13\u201317). Pragmatically, this appeal to faith was in the\nservice less of safeguarding Christian faith than of loosening\necclesiastical constraints on philosophy. Summarizing these\ndevelopments, Delany writes:\n\nWith the separation of truths as their declaration of independence,\nprogressive scholars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were\nable to pursue their arguments as far as logically possible. Skeptical\nfideism offered a way of saving both faith and reason, for while faith\nwas no longer to be supported by reason, neither was it to be denied\nout of hand. As a separate mode of perception it could remain valid on\nits own terms, neither requiring proof nor infringing on it (21).\n\n\nThe freedom claimed for philosophy was nevertheless a \u201climited\nfreedom\u201d: \u201cIndeed logic was still restrained by the very\ndevice that freed it, for as long as doctrine was acknowledged to be\nsupreme, and God\u2019s will the highest cause, then reason and\nexperience could attain only relative validity\u201d (Delany,\n21).\n\nMoreover, theology had reasons of its own to be suspicious of\nexperience and (what passes for) reason. Of central importance in this\nregard is the idea that one\u2019s rational faculties can be damaged\nby sin. Although this idea was articulated by a variety of early\nChristian theologians including Tertullian and Augustine (and has\nobvious analogues in classical virtue theory), it came to be given\nspecial attention within the Protestant tradition. The reformers held\nthat the human intellect had been corrupted by humanity\u2019s fall\nfrom grace, and that consequently the truth of Christianity could be\napprehended only by faith. Protestant theologians from Luther and\nCalvin to Karl Barth have thus affirmed the priority of faith not only\nto \u201cworks\u201d but also to natural theology.\n\nWithin Roman Catholicism, by contrast, greater weight has\ncharacteristically been given to the classic arguments for God\u2019s\nexistence. (It is, however, doubtful that these arguments were\nhistorically ever intended as freestanding proofs that would be\nconvincing to atheists. For an illuminating discussion of the\nfunctions of such arguments in pre-modern and early-modern contexts,\nsee Clayton, Parts II and III.) This theological division thus\nrepresents part of the context for the debate over fideism. It is\ninteresting in this connection to note that the Roman Catholic\nMagisterium has repeatedly condemned fideism. Absent from the\ndocuments of Vatican I, the term makes what seems to be its first\nappearance in a papal encyclical in 1907, in Pius X\u2019s\nPascendi Dominici Gregis (see Other Internet Resources),\nwhere fideism is referenced in the context of a more sweeping critique\nof \u201cmodernist\u201d\n theology.[2]\n More recently, in the 1998 encyclical Fides et Ratio (see\nOther Internet Resources), John Paul II warned of \u201ca resurgence\nof fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of\nrational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding\nof faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God\u201d\n(\u00a755), and in Caritas In Veritate (2009, see Other\nInternet Resources), his third encyclical, Benedict XVI writes,\n\u201cTruth frees charity from the constraints of an emotionalism\nthat deprives it of relational and social content, and of a fideism\nthat deprives it of human and universal breathing-space\u201d\n(\u00a73). This emphasis on reason in general, and on natural theology\nin particular, may help in part to explain how the term\n\u201cfideism\u201d has come to function within Roman Catholic\ntheology largely as a term of opprobrium.\n\nOn the other hand \u2013 and in a sort of ironic twist \u2013 the\ncounter-Reformation also launched a defense of Catholicism that some\nhistorians have described as fideistic. The Protestant Reformation\ncoincided with the re-discovery in Europe of the ancient skeptical\narguments of Sextus Empiricus, Cicero, and Diogenes Laertius, and as\nRichard H. Popkin has demonstrated, these arguments were quickly\nappropriated by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Catholic\nphilosophers and theologians \u2013 including Erasmus, Montaigne,\nPierre Charron, and Petrus Gassendi (as well as by Protestant thinkers\nlike Pierre Bayle) \u2013 who deployed them in the religious\ncontroversies of the\n period.[3]\n Their contention was simple, if something of an ignoratio\nelenchi: since skepticism undermines any reason for becoming a\nProtestant, one should remain a Catholic on the basis of faith alone\n(Popkin 1992, 122\u2013123).\n\nBut although the Protestant reformers and these \u201cnouveaux\nPyrrhoniens\u201d both relied on skeptical arguments to deflate the\npretensions of philosophical \u201creason,\u201d they tended to draw\nsomewhat different conclusions about the role and nature of faith. In\nthe face of uncertainty the latter counseled their readers to remain\nloyal to the prevailing religious conventions of the time \u2013 in\nthis case Roman Catholicism. But they tended to eschew the religious\nenthusiasm characteristic of the more pietistic Protestant sects.\nTheirs was thus a temperate and tentative faith, grounded in action\nrather than doctrine. If they were fideistic, they were nevertheless\nnot dogmatic. According to the reformed view, by contrast, the domain\nof faith is characterized by fervor and passionate commitment:\nskepticism thus ultimately gives way to certainty and religious\nassurance of a kind unassailable by philosophical doubt. In his book\nGod and Skepticism, Terence Penelhum calls the latter view\n\u201cevangelical fideism,\u201d and he distinguishes it from the\n\u201cconformist fideism\u201d that identifies faith with loyalty to\na tradition (15\u201316).\n\nThe theological developments in the nineteenth century in reference to\nwhich the term \u201cfideism\u201d was first used had their\nphilosophical inspiration not simply in the skepticism of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, however, but also, and more\nimmediately, in Immanuel Kant\u2019s critical philosophy. For Kant,\nGod\u2019s existence was a postulate of\npractical \u2013 rather than pure \u2013 reason. Accordingly,\nKant rejected the traditional \u201cproofs\u201d of God\u2019s\nexistence \u2013 the cosmological, teleological, and ontological\narguments \u2013 in favor of a moral argument. Thus, although Kant\nfamously championed the conception of a thoroughly\n\u201crational\u201d (i.e., moral) version of Christianity \u2013 a\n\u201creligion within the limits of reason alone\u201d \u2013 he also\nplaced religious belief outside the domain of what can be known by\nmeans of speculative philosophy. In this way, he \u201cfound it\nnecessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for\nfaith\u201d (1929, 29).\n\nThe earliest documented uses of the term \u201cfideism\u201d are to\nbe found in French theology. Thomas D. Carroll has located references\nto fid\u00e9isme from as early as 1854 (2008, 10); however,\nthe term appears to have entered into broader circulation in the\nliterature a quarter-century later, when it came to be used\npejoratively in reference to Catholic traditionalism by theologians\nseeking to revive the Thomistic synthesis of reason and faith.\n\nAt around the same time or shortly thereafter, Carroll argues, the\nterm appears to have originated independently in the work of the\nFrench Protestant theologians Eug\u00e8ene M\u00e9n\u00e9goz\n(1838\u20131921) and Auguste Sabatier (1839\u20131901), who (unlike\nthe Catholic traditionalists of whom it was predicated by their\ncritics) applied it to themselves. M\u00e9n\u00e9goz and Sabatier\nboth sought to distinguish faith \u2013 understood in terms of\nsomething akin to Schleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute\ndependence \u2013 from propositional belief, arguing that salvation\ndepends on the former, rather than on assent to any particular\ndoctrine. Because of Sabatier\u2019s emphasis on religious symbols,\nthis view was sometimes called\n \u201csymbolo-fideism.\u201d[4]\n\nAs Carroll observes, the projection of the term \u201cfideism\u201d\nahistorically \u2013 onto thinkers as removed from the context in which\nit originated as Tertullian \u2013 is potentially the source of much\nconfusion, given that the meanings of key terms like\n\u201cfaith\u201d and \u201creason\u201d vary dramatically from\none context to another. Moreover, the term\u2019s presently\nwidespread pejorative connotations render \u201cfideism\u201d\nproblematic as a descriptive category.\n",
