    "main_text": "Cardinal Payoffs and Impure PDs\n3. Cardinal Payoffs and Impure PDs\n\nIf the game specifies absolute (as opposed to relative) payoffs, then\nuniversal cooperation may not be a pareto optimal outcome even in the\ntwo person PD. For under some conditions both players do better by\nadopting a mixed strategy of cooperating with probability\n\\(p\\) and defecting with probability \\((1-p)\\). This point is\nillustrated in the graphs below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nHere the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes represent the utilities of Row and\nColumn. The four outcomes entered in the matrix of the second section\nare represented by the labeled dots. Conditions PD3a and PD3b (see\n above)\n ensure that \\((\\bC,\\bD)\\) and \\((\\bD,\\bC)\\) lie northwest and\nsoutheast of \\((\\bD,\\bD)\\), and PD3c is reflected in the fact that\n\\((\\bC,\\bC)\\) lies northeast of \\((\\bD,\\bD)\\). Suppose first that\n\\((\\bD,\\bD)\\) and \\((\\bC,\\bC)\\) lie on opposite sides of the line\nbetween \\((\\bC,\\bD)\\) and \\((\\bD,\\bC)\\), as in the graph on the left.\nThen the four points form a convex quadrilateral, and the payoffs of\nthe feasible outcomes of mixed strategies are represented by all the\npoints on or within this quadrilateral. Of course a player can really\nonly get one of four possible payoffs each time the game is played,\nbut the points in the quadrilateral represent the expected\nvalues of the payoffs to the two players. If Row and Column\ncooperate with probabilities \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) (and defect with\nprobabilities \\(p^*=1-p\\) and \\(q^*=1-q\\)), for example, then the\nexpected value of the payoff to Row is \\(p^*qT+pqR+p^*q^*P+pq^*S\\). A\nrational self-interested player, according to a standard view, should\nprefer a higher expected payoff to a lower one. In the graph on the\nleft the payoff for universal cooperation (with probability one) is\npareto optimal among the payoffs for all mixed strategies. In the\ngraph on the right, however, where both \\((\\bD, \\bD)\\) and \\((\\bC,\n\\bC)\\) lie southwest of the line between \\((\\bC, \\bD)\\) and \\((\\bD,\n\\bC)\\), the story is more complicated. Here the payoffs of the\nfeasible outcome lie within a figure bounded on the northeast by three\ndistinct curve segments, two linear and one concave. Notice that\n\\((\\bC, \\bC)\\) is now in the interior of the region bounded by solid\nlines, indicating that there are mixed strategies that provide both\nplayers a higher expected payoff than \\((\\bC, \\bC)\\). It is important\nto note that we are talking about independent mixed strategies here.\nRow and Column use private randomizing devices and have no\ncommunication. If they were able to correlate their mixed strategies,\nso as to ensure, say \\((\\bC, \\bD)\\) with probability \\(p\\) and \\((\\bD,\n\\bC)\\) with probability \\(p^*\\), the set of feasible solutions would\nextend up to (and include) the dotted line between \\((\\bC, \\bD)\\) and\n\\((\\bD, \\bC)\\). The point here is that, even confined to independent\nstrategies, there are some games satisfying PD3 in which both players\ncan both do better than they do with universal cooperation. A PD in\nwhich universal cooperation is pareto optimal may be called a pure PD.\n(This phenomenon is identified in Kuhn and Moresi and applied to moral\nphilosophy in Kuhn 1996.) A pure PD is characterized by adding to PD3\nthe following condition.\n\n(P) \\((T_r - R_r)(T_c -\nR_c) \\le (R_r - S_r)(R_c - S_c)\\)\n\n\nIn a symmetric game \\(P\\) reduces to the simpler condition \n\n(RCA) \\(R \\ge\n\\tfrac{1}{2}(T+S)\\)\n\n\n(named after the authors Rapoport, Chammah and Axelrod who employed\nit).\n",
